group $G$. Invariance of such a Lagrangian under the action of\n$G$ leads to the symmetry-reduced Euler-Lagrange equations called the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e equations. In this case, the invariant Lagrangian is defined\non the Lie algebra of the group and its Euler-Poincar\\'e equations are defined\non the dual Lie algebra, where dual is defined by the operation of taking\nvariational derivative. On the Hamiltonian side, the Euler-Poincar\\'e equations\nare Lie-Poisson and they possess accompanying momentum maps, which encode both\ntheir conservation laws and the geometry of their solution space.\n  The standard Euler-Poincar\\'e examples are treated, including particle\ndynamics, the rigid body, the heavy top and geodesic motion on Lie groups.\nAdditional topics deal with Fermat's principle, the $\\mathbb{R}^3$ Poisson\nbracket, polarized optical traveling waves, deformable bodies (Riemann\nellipsoids) and shallow water waves, including the integrable shallow water\nwave systems associated with geodesic motion on the diffeomorphisms. The\nlectures end with the semidirect-product Euler-Poincar\\'e reduction theorem for\nideal fluid dynamics. This theorem introduces the Euler--Poincar\\'e variational\nprinciple for incompressible and compressible motions of ideal fluids, with\napplications to geophysical fluids. It also leads to their Lie-Poisson\nHamiltonian formulation.\n", "  We have experimentally realized a hybrid trap for ultracold paramagnetic\nrubidium and diamagnetic ytterbium atoms by combining a bichromatic optical\ndipole trap for ytterbium with a Ioffe-Pritchard-type magnetic trap for\nrubidium. In this hybrid trap, sympathetic cooling of five different ytterbium\nisotopes through elastic collisions with rubidium was achieved. A strong\ndependence of the interspecies collisional cross section on the mass of the\nytterbium isotope was observed.\n", "  We study DC charge and spin transport through a weakly coupled quantum dot,\ndriven by a non-adiabatic periodic change of system parameters. We generalize\nthe model of Tien and Gordon to simultaneously oscillating voltages and tunnel\ncouplings. When applying our general result to the two-parameter charge pumping\nin quantum dots, we find interference effects between the oscillations of the\nvoltage and tunnel couplings. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility to\nelectrically pump a spin current in presence of a static magnetic field.\n", "  We study the performance of achromatic half-wave plates (AHWP) as a function\nof their construction parameters, the detection bandwidth of a power detector\noperating in the millimeter wave band, and the spectral shape of the incident\nradiation. We focus particular attention on the extraction of the degree of\nincident polarization and its orientation angle from the intensity measured as\na function of AHWP rotation angle, which we call the IVA (intensity versus\nangle). We quantify the phase offset of the IVA and point to potential\nsystematic errors in the extraction of this offset in cases where the incident\nspectrum is not sufficiently well known. We show how the phase offset and\nmodulation efficiency of the AHWP depend on the relative angles between the\nplates in the stack and find that high modulation efficiency can be achieved\nwith alignment accuracy of few degrees.\n", "  We have produced ultracold heteronuclear YbRb$^*$ molecules in a combined\nmagneto-optical trap by photoassociation. The formation of electronically\nexcited molecules close to the dissociation limit was observed by trap loss\nspectroscopy in mixtures of $^{87}$Rb with $^{174}$Yb and $^{176}$Yb. The\nmolecules could be prepared in a series of vibrational levels with resolved\nrotational structure, allowing for an experimental determination of the\nlong-range potential in the electronically excited state.\n", "  We study Andreev reflection in a normal conductor-molecule-superconductor\njunction using a first principles approach. In particular, we focus on a family\nof molecules consisting of a molecular backbone and a weakly coupled side\ngroup. We show that the presence of the side group can lead to a Fano resonance\nin the Andreev reflection. We use a simple theoretical model to explain the\nresults of the numerical calculations and to make predictions about the\npossible sub-gap resonance structures in the Andreev reflection coefficient.\n", "  We study the coherent transport of heavy holes through a one-dimensional ring\nin the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit interaction of holes, cubic\nin the in-plane components of momentum, gives rise to an angular momentum\ndependent spin texture of the eigenstates and influences transport. We analyze\nthe dependence of the resulting differential conductance of the ring on hole\npolarization of the leads and the signature of the textures in the\nAharonov-Bohm oscillations when the ring is in a perpendicular magnetic field.\nWe find that the polarization-resolved conductance reveals whether the dominant\nspin-orbit coupling is of Dresselhaus or Rashba type, and that the cubic\nspin-orbit coupling can be distinguished from the conventional linear coupling\nby observing the four-peak structure in the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations.\n", "  Interactions between light and conducting nanostructures can result in a\nvariety of novel and fascinating phenomena. These properties may have wide\napplications, but their underlying mechanisms have not been completely\nunderstood. From calculations of surface charge density waves on conducting\ngratings and by comparing them with classical surface plasmons, we revealed a\ngeneral yet concrete picture about coupling of light to free electron\noscillation on structured conducting surfaces that can lead to oscillating\nsubwavelength charge patterns (i.e., spoof surface plasmons but without the\ndispersion property of classical surface plasmons). New wavelets emitted from\nthese light sources then destructively interfere to form evanescent waves. This\nprinciple, usually combined with other mechanisms (e.g. resonance), is mainly a\ngeometrical effect that can be universally involved in light scattering from\nall periodic and nonperiodic structures containing free electrons, including\nperfect conductors. The spoof surface plasmon picture may provide clear\nguidelines for developing metamaterial-based nano-optical devices.\n", "  In this paper are reviewed various designs of advanced, multi-aperture\noptical systems dedicated to high angular resolution imaging or to the\ndetection of exo-planets by nulling interferometry. A simple Fourier optics\nformalism applicable to both imaging arrays and nulling interferometers is\npresented, allowing to derive their basic theoretical relationships as\nconvolution or cross correlation products suitable for fast and accurate\ncomputation. Several unusual designs, such as a super-resolving telescope\nutilizing a mosaicking observation procedure or a free-flying, axially\nrecombined interferometer are examined, and their performance in terms of\nimaging and nulling capacity are assessed. In all considered cases, it is found\nthat the limiting parameter is the diameter of the individual telescopes. The\nentire study is only valid in the frame of first-order geometrical optics and\nscalar diffraction theory. Furthermore, it is assumed that all entrance\nsub-apertures are optically conjugated with their associated exit pupils, a\nparticularity inducing an instrumental behavior comparable with those of\ndiffraction gratings.\n", "  We prove nonintegrability of a model Hamiltonian system defined on the Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{su}_3$ suitable for investigation of connections between\nclassical and quantum characteristics of chaos.\n", "  The propagation and transmission of Bessel beams through nano-layered\nstructures has been discussed recently. Within this framework we recognize the\nformation of unguided diffraction-free waves with the spot size approaching and\noccasionally surpassing the limit of a wavelength when a Bessel beam of any\norder n is launched onto a thin material slab with grazing incidence. Based on\nthe plane-wave representation of cylindrical waves, a simple model is\nintroduced providing an exact prescription of the transverse pattern of this\ntype of diffraction-suppressed localized waves. Potential applications in\nsurface science are put forward for consideration.\n", "  We study the relaxation of a single electron spin in a circular gate-tunbable\nquantum dot in gapped graphene. Direct coupling of the electron spin to\nout-of-plane phonons via the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling leads to a\nrelaxation time T_1 which is independent of the B-field at low fields. We also\nfind that Rashba spin-orbit induced admixture of opposite spin states in\ncombination with the emission of in-plane phonons provides various further\nrelaxation channels via deformation potential and bond-length change. In the\nabsence of valley mixing, spin relaxation takes place within each valley\nseparately and thus time-reversal symmetry is effectively broken, thus\ninhibiting the van Vleck cancellation at B=0 known from GaAs quantum dots. Both\nthe absence of the van Vleck cancellation as well as the out-of-plane phonons\nlead to a behavior of the spin relaxation rate at low magnetic fields which is\nmarkedly different from the known results for GaAs. For low B-fields, we find\nthat the rate is constant in B and then crosses over to ~B^2 or ~B^4 at higher\nfields.\n", "  We prove a Nekhoroshev type theorem for the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\n$$ iu_t=-\\Delta u+V\\star u+\\partial_{\\bar u}g(u,\\bar u)\\, \\quad x\\in \\T^d, $$\nwhere $V$ is a typical smooth potential and $g$ is analytic in both variables.\nMore precisely we prove that if the initial datum is analytic in a strip of\nwidth $\\rho>0$ with a bound on this strip equals to $\\eps$ then, if $\\eps$ is\nsmall enough, the solution of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation above\nremains analytic in a strip of width $\\rho/2$ and bounded on this strip by\n$C\\eps$ during very long time of order $ \\eps^{-\\alpha|\\ln \\eps|^\\beta}$ for\nsome constants $C> 0$, $\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta<1$.\n", "  This article reviews recent developments in the physics of quantized vortices\nin superfluid helium and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Quantized vortices\nappear in low-temperature quantum condensed systems as the direct product of\nBose-Einstein condensation. Quantized vortices were first discovered in\nsuperfluid 4He in the 1950s, and have since been studied with a primary focus\non the quantum hydrodynamics of this system. Since the discovery of superfluid\n3He in 1972, quantized vortices characteristic of the anisotropic superfluid\nhave been studied theoretically and observed experimentally using rotating\ncryostats. The realization of atomic Bose-Einstein condensation in 1995 has\nopened new possibilities, because it became possible to control and directly\nvisualize condensates and quantized vortices. Historically, many ideas\ndeveloped in superfluid 4He and 3He have been imported to the field of cold\natoms and utilized effectively. Here, we review and summarize our current\nunderstanding of quantized vortices, bridging superfluid helium and atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates. This review article begins with a basic\nintroduction, which is followed by discussion of modern topics such as quantum\nturbulence and vortices in unusual cold atom condensates.\n", "  Free space propagation and conventional optical systems such as lenses and\nmirrors all perform spatial unitary transforms. However, the subset of\ntransforms available through these conventional systems is limited in scope. We\npresent here a unitary programmable mode converter (UPMC) capable of performing\nany spatial unitary transform of the light field. It is based on a succession\nof reflections on programmable deformable mirrors and free space propagation.\nWe first show theoretically that a UPMC without limitations on resources can\nperform perfectly any transform. We then build an experimental implementation\nof the UPMC and show that, even when limited to three reflections on an array\nof 12 pixels, the UPMC is capable of performing single mode tranforms with an\nefficiency greater than 80% for the first 4 modes of the TEM basis.\n", "  We studied the edge states and transverse electron focusing in the presence\nof spin-orbit interaction in a two dimensional electron gas. Assuming strong\nspin-orbit coupling we derived semiclassical quantization conditions to\ndescribe the dispersion of the edge states. Using the dispersion relation we\nthen make predictions about certain properties of the focusing spectrum.\nComparison of our analytical results with quantum mechanical transport\ncalculations reveals that certain features of the focusing spectrum can be\nquite well understood in terms of the interference of the edge states while the\nexplanation of other features seems to require a different approach.\n", "  Quantum graphs can be extended to scattering systems when they are connected\nby leads to infinity. It is shown that for certain extensions, the scattering\nmatrices of isospectral graphs are conjugate to each other and their poles\ndistributions are therefore identical. The scattering matrices are studied\nusing a recently developed isospectral theory. At the same time, the scattering\napproach offers a new insight on the mentioned isospectral construction.\n", "  We present a novel way of realizing the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson\nmechanism at all orders in perturbation theory, for the doublet-triplet\nsplitting in supersymmetric grand unified theories. The global symmetries of\nthe Higgs sector are attributed to a non-vectorlike Higgs content, which is\nconsistent with unbroken supersymmetry in a scenario with flat extra dimensions\nand branes. We also show how in such a model one can naturally obtain a\nrealistic pattern for the Standard Model fermion masses and mixings.\n", "  We present a description of entanglement in composite quantum systems in\nterms of symplectic geometry. We provide a symplectic characterization of sets\nof equally entangled states as orbits of group actions in the space of states.\nIn particular, using Kostant-Sternberg theorem, we show that separable states\nform a unique Kaehler orbit, whereas orbits of entanglement states are\ncharacterized by different degrees of degeneracy of the canonical symplectic\nform on the complex projective space. The degree of degeneracy may be thus used\nas a new geometric measure of entanglement and we show how to calculate it for\nvarious multiparticle systems providing also simple criteria of separability.\nThe presented method is general and can be applied also under different\nadditional symmetry conditions stemming, eg. from the indistinguishability of\nparticles.\n", "  Recently, the use of Bessel beams in evaluating the possibility of using them\nfor a new generation of GPR (ground penetrating radar) systems has been\nconsidered. Therefore, an analysis of the propagation of Bessel beam in\nconducting media is worthwhile. We present here an analysis of this type.\nSpecifically, for normal incidence we analyze the propagation of a Bessel beam\ncoming from a perfect dielectric and impinging on a conducting medium, i.e. the\npropagation of a Bessel beam generated by refracted inhomogeneous waves. The\nremarkable and unexpected result is that the incident Bessel beam does not\nchange its shape even when propagating in the conducting medium.\n", "  In this article, we study the coupling of the Einstein field equations of\ngeneral relativity to a family of models of nonlinear electromagnetic fields.\nThe family comprises all covariant electromagnetic models that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: they are derivable from a sufficiently regular Lagrangian,\nthey reduce to the linear Maxwell model in the weak-field limit, and their\ncorresponding energy-momentum tensors satisfy the dominant energy condition.\nOur main result is a proof of the global nonlinear stability of the 1 +\n3-dimensional Minkowski spacetime solution to the coupled system for any member\nof the family, which includes the linear Maxwell model. This stability result\nis a consequence of a small-data global existence result for a reduced system\nof equations that is equivalent to the original system in our wave coordinate\ngauge. Our analysis of the spacetime metric components is based on a framework\nrecently developed by Lindblad and Rodnianski, which allows us to derive\nsuitable estimates for tensorial systems of quasilinear wave equations with\nnonlinearities that satisfy the weak null condition. Our analysis of the\nelectromagnetic fields, which satisfy quasilinear first-order equations, is\nbased on an extension of a geometric energy-method framework developed by\nChristodoulou, together with a collection of pointwise decay estimates for the\nFaraday tensor developed in the article. We work directly with the\nelectromagnetic fields, and thus avoid the use of electromagnetic potentials.\n", "  We study the spin exchange between two electrons localized in separate\nquantum dots in graphene. The electronic states in the conduction band are\ncoupled indirectly by tunneling to a common continuum of delocalized states in\nthe valence band. As a model, we use a two-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian which\nwe subsequently transform into an effective spin Hamiltonian by way of a\ntwo-stage Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We then compare our result to that\nfrom a Coqblin-Schrieffer approach as well as to fourth order perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  In this paper we consider solutions to the linear wave equation on higher\ndimensional Schwarzschild black hole spacetimes and prove robust nondegenerate\nenergy decay estimates that are in principle required in a nonlinear stability\nproblem. More precisely, it is shown that for solutions to the wave equation\n\\Box_g\\phi=0 on the domain of outer communications of the Schwarzschild\nspacetime manifold (M^n_m, g) (where n >= 3 is the spatial dimension, and m > 0\nis the mass of the black hole) the associated energy flux E[\\phi](\\Sigma_\\tau)\nthrough a foliation of hypersurfaces (\\Sigma_\\tau) (terminating at future null\ninfinity and to the future of the bifurcation sphere) decays,\nE[\\phi](\\Sigma_\\tau) <= CD/\\tau^2, where C is a constant only depending on n\nand m, and D < \\infty is a suitable higher order initial energy on \\Sigma_0;\nmoreover we improve the decay rate for the first order energy to\nE[\\partial_t\\phi](\\Sigma_\\tau^R) <= CD/\\tau^(4-2\\delta) for any \\delta > 0\nwhere \\Sigma_\\tau^R denotes the hypersurface (\\Sigma_\\tau) truncated at an\narbitrarily large fixed radius R < \\infty provided the higher order energy\nD_\\delta on \\Sigma_0 is finite. We conclude our paper by interpolating between\nthese two results to obtain the pointwise estimate |\\phi|_{\\Sigma_\\tau^R} <= (C\nD'_\\delta) / \\tau^(3/2-\\delta). In this work we follow the new physical-space\napproach to decay for the wave equation of Dafermos and Rodnianski.\n", "  By tooling an spot-illuminated surface to control the flow of specular glints\nunder motion, one can produce holographic view-dependent imagery. This paper\npresents the differential equation that governs the shape of the specular\nsurfaces, and illustrates how solutions can be constructed for different kinds\nof motion, lighting, host surface geometries, and fabrication constraints,\nleading to some novel forms of holography.\n", "  As grown ZnO:Si nanocomposites of different compositional ratios were\nfabricated by thermal evaporation techniques. These films were subjected to\npost deposition annealing under high vacuum at a temperature of $\\rm 250C^o$\nfor 90min. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of annealed samples have shown\nmarked improvements both in terms of intensity and broadening. For the first\ntime in ZnO:Si nanocomposite films we see huge UV, red and orange peaks at 310,\n570 and 640nm. Structural and Raman analysis show formation of a Zn-Si-O shell\naround ZnO nano clusters wherein on heating $\\rm Zn_2SiO_4$ compound forms. The\nnew emissions are due to $\\rm Zn_2SiO_4$ which completes white light spectrum.\n", "  We study equations on a principal bundle over a compact complex manifold\ncoupling a connection on the bundle with a Kahler structure on the base. These\nequations generalize the conditions of constant scalar curvature for a Kahler\nmetric and Hermite-Yang-Mills for a connection. We provide a moment map\ninterpretation of the equations and study obstructions for the existence of\nsolutions, generalizing the Futaki invariant, the Mabuchi K-energy and geodesic\nstability. We finish by giving some examples of solutions.\n", "  The inner structure of the attractor appearing when the\nVarley-Gradwell-Hassell population model bifurcates from regular to chaotic\nbehaviour is studied. By algebraic and geometric arguments the coexistence of a\ncontinuum of neutrally stable limit cycles with different periods in the\nattractor is explained.\n", "  In this paper, we give a construction of the global Chern-Simons functions\nfor toric Calabi-Yau stacks of dimension three using strong exceptional\ncollections. The moduli spaces of sheaves on such stacks can be identified with\ncritical loci of these functions. We give two applications of these functions.\nFirst, we prove Joyce's integrality conjecture of generalized DT invariants on\nlocal surfaces. Second, we prove a dimension reduction formula for virtual\nmotives, which leads to two recursion formulas for motivic Donaldson-Thomas\ninvariants.\n", "  A theory of linearly elastic orthotropic shells is presented, with potential\napplication to the continuous modeling of Carbon NanoTubes. Two relevant\nfeatures are: the selected type of orthotropic response, which should be\nsuitable to capture differences in chirality; the possibility of accounting for\nthickness changes due to changes in inter-wall separation to be expected in\nmulti-wall CNTs. A simpler version of the theory is also proposed, in which\northotropy is preserved but thickness changes are excluded, intended for\npossible application to single-wall CNTs. Another feature of both versions of\nthe present theory is boundary-value problems of torsion, axial traction,\nuniform inner pressure, and rim flexure, can be solved explicitly in closed\nform. Various directions of ongoing further research are indicated.\n", "  The school choice mechanism design problem focuses on assignment mechanisms\nmatching students to public schools in a given school district. The well-known\nGale Shapley Student Optimal Stable Matching Mechanism (SOSM) is the most\nefficient stable mechanism proposed so far as a solution to this problem.\nHowever its inefficiency is well-documented, and recently the Efficiency\nAdjusted Deferred Acceptance Mechanism (EADAM) was proposed as a remedy for\nthis weakness. In this note we describe two related adjustments to SOSM with\nthe intention to address the same inefficiency issue. In one we create possibly\nartificial coalitions among students where some students modify their\npreference profiles in order to improve the outcome for some other students.\nOur second approach involves trading cliques among students where those\ninvolved improve their assignments by waiving some of their priorities. The\ncoalition method yields the EADAM outcome among other Pareto dominations of the\nSOSM outcome, while the clique method yields all possible Pareto optimal Pareto\ndominations of SOSM. The clique method furthermore incorporates a natural\nsolution to the problem of breaking possible ties within preference and\npriority profiles. We discuss the practical implications and limitations of our\napproach in the final section of the article.\n", "  We report on the generation of high-order optical vortices by spiral phase\nmirrors. The phase mirrors are produced by direct machining with a diamond tool\nand are shown to produce high-quality optical vortices with topological charges\nranging from 1 to 1000 at a wavelength of 532 nm. The direct machining\ntechnique is flexible and offers the promise of high-precision, large-diameter\nspiral phase mirrors that are compatible with high optical powers.\n", "  We present a description of locally equivalent states in terms of symplectic\ngeometry. Using the moment map between local orbits in the space of states and\ncoadjoint orbits of the local unitary group we reduce the problem of local\nunitary equivalence to an easy part consisting of identifying the proper\ncoadjoint orbit and a harder problem of the geometry of fibers of the moment\nmap. We give a detailed analysis of the properties of orbits of \"equally\nentangled states\". In particular we show connections between certain symplectic\nproperties of orbits such as their isotropy and coisotropy with effective\ncriteria of local unitary equivalence.\n", "  We discuss a cosmological model in which the string gauge field coupled\nuniversally to matter gives rise to an extra centripetal force and will have\nobservable signatures on cosmological and astronomical observations. Several\ntests are performed using data including galaxy rotation curves of 22 spiral\ngalaxies of varied luminosities and sizes, and perihelion precessions of\nplanets in the solar system.\n  The rotation curves of the same group of galaxies are independently fit using\na dark matter model with the generalized Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) profile\nand the string model. A Remarkable fit of galaxy rotation curves is achieved\nusing the one-parameter string model as compared to the three-parameter dark\nmatter model with the NFW profile. The average $\\chi^2$ value of the NFW fit is\n9\\% better than that of the string model at a price of two more free\nparameters. Furthermore, from the string model, we can give a dynamical\nexplanation for the phenomenological Tully-Fisher relation. We are able to\nderive a relation between field strength, galaxy size and luminosity, which can\nbe verified with data from the 22 galaxies.\n  To further test the hypothesis of the universal existence of the string gauge\nfield, we apply our string model to the solar system. Constraint on the\nmagnitude of the string field in the solar system is deduced from the current\nranges for any anomalous perihelion precession of planets allowed by the latest\nobservations. The field distribution resembles a dipole field originating from\nthe Sun. The string field strength deduced from the solar system observations\nis of a similar magnitude as the field strength needed to sustain the\nrotational speed of the Sun inside the Milky Way. This hypothesis can be tested\nfurther by future observations with higher precision.\n", "  A method to estimate the time-dependent correlation via an empirical bias\nestimate of the time-delayed mutual information for a time-series is proposed.\nIn particular, the bias of the time-delayed mutual information is shown to\noften be equivalent to the mutual information between two distributions of\npoints from the same system separated by infinite time. Thus intuitively,\nestimation of the bias is reduced to estimation of the mutual information\nbetween distributions of data points separated by large time intervals. The\nproposed bias estimation techniques are shown to work for Lorenz equations data\nand glucose time series data of three patients from the Columbia University\nMedical Center database.\n", "  We discuss scattering from pairs of isospectral quantum graphs constructed\nusing the method described in [1, 2]. It was shown in [3] that scattering\nmatrices of such graphs have the same spectrum and polar structure, provided\nthat infinite leads are attached in a way which preserves the symmetry of\nisospectral construction. In the current paper we compare this result with the\nconjecture put forward by Okada et al. [4] that the pole distribution of\nscattering matrices in the exterior of isospectral domains in R^2 are\ndifferent.\n", "  It is known that knot homologies admit a physical description as spaces of\nopen BPS states. We study operators and algebras acting on these spaces. This\nleads to a very rich story, which involves wall crossing phenomena, algebras of\nclosed BPS states acting on spaces of open BPS states, and deformations of\nLandau-Ginzburg models.\n  One important application to knot homologies is the existence of \"colored\ndifferentials\" that relate homological invariants of knots colored by different\nrepresentations. Based on this structure, we formulate a list of properties of\nthe colored HOMFLY homology that categorifies the colored HOMFLY polynomial. By\ncalculating the colored HOMFLY homology for symmetric and anti-symmetric\nrepresentations, we find a remarkable \"mirror symmetry\" between these\ntriply-graded theories.\n", "  We study theoretically the entanglement of two-photon states in the ground\nstate of the intersubband cavity system, the so-called polariton vacuum. The\nsystem consists of a sequence of doped quantum wells located inside a\nmicrocavity and the photons can interact with intersubband excitations inside\nthe quantum wells. Using an explicit solution for the ground state of the\nsystem, operated in the ultrastrong coupling regime, a post-selection is\nintroduced, where only certain two-photon states are considered and analyzed\nfor mode entanglement. We find that a fast quench of the coupling creates\nentangled photons and that the degree of entanglement depends on the absolute\nvalues of the in-plane wave vectors of the photons. Maximally entangled states\ncan be generated by choosing the appropriate modes in the post-selection.\n", "  Studying the jamming transition of granular and colloidal systems, has lead\nto a proliferation of theoretical and numerical results formulated in the\nlanguage of the eigenspectrum of the dynamical matrix for these disordered\nsystem. Only recently however, these modes have been accessed experimentally in\ncolloidal and granular media, computing the eigenmodes of the covariance matrix\nof the particle positions. At the same time new conceptual and methodological\nquestions have appeared, regarding the interpretation of these results. In the\npresent paper, we first give an overview of the theoretical framework which is\nappropriate to discuss the interpretation of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of\nthe correlation matrix in terms of the vibrational properties of these systems.\n  We then illustrate several aspects of the statistical and data analysis\ntechniques which are necessary to extract reliable results from experimental\ndata. Concentrating on the case of hard sphere simulations, colloidal and\ngranular experiments, we discuss how to test the existence of a metastable\nstate, the statistical independence of the sampling, the effect of the\nexperimental resolution, and the harmonic hypothesis underlying the approach,\nhighlighting both its promises and limitations.\n", "  We model spin blockade for optically excited electrons and holes in a charged\nsemiconductor quantum dot. We study the case where the quantum dot is initially\ncharged with a single electron and is then filled with an additional, optically\nexcited electron-hole pair, thus forming a charged exciton (trion). To make\ncontact with recent experiments, we model an optical pump-probe setup, in which\nthe two lowest quantum dot levels (s and p shells) are photo excited. Using the\nLindblad master equation, we calculate the differential transmission spectrum\nas a function of the pump-probe time delay. Taking into account both spin\nconserving and spin-flip intraband relaxation processes, we find that the\npresence of the ground-state electron spin leads to an optical spin blockade at\nshort delay times which is visible as a crossover between two exponential\ndecays of the differential transmission. To make predictions for future\nexperiments, we also study the dependence of the spin-blockade on an external\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We study the time evolution of the Weyl symbol of a solution of the time\ndependent Hartree Fock equation, assuming that for t=0, it has a Weyl symbol\nwhich is integrable in the phase space, such as all its derivatives. We prove\nthat the solution has the same property for all t, and we give an asymptotic\nexpansion, in L1 sense, of this Weyl symbol.\n", "  We study the photoluminescence spectra of n-doped InP bulk wafers, both in\nthe reflection and the transmission geometries relative to the excitation beam.\nFrom the observed spectra we estimate the spatial distribution of minority\ncarriers allowing for the spectral filtering due to re-absorption of\nluminescence in the wafer. This distribution unambiguously demonstrates a\nnon-exponential drop-off with distance from the excitation region. Such a\nbehavior evidences an anomalous photon-assisted transport of minority carriers\nenhanced owing to the high quantum efficiency of emission. It is shown that the\ntransport conforms very well to the so-called Levy-flights process\ncorresponding to a peculiar random walk that does not reduce to diffusion. The\nindex gamma of the Levy flights distribution is found to be in the range gamma\n= 0.64 to 0.79, depending on the doping. Thus, we propose the high-efficiency\ndirect-gap semiconductors as a remarkable laboratory system for studying the\nanomalous transport.\n", "  Power symmetric matrices defned and studied by R. Sinkhorn (1981) and their\ngeneralization by R.B. Bapat, S.K. Jain and K. Manjunatha Prasad (1999) have\nbeen utilized to give positive block matrices with trace one possessing\npositive partial transpose, the so-called PPT states. Another method to\nconstruct such PPT states is given, it uses the form of a matrix unitarily\nequivalent to its transpose obtained by S.R. Garcia and J.E. Tener (2012).\nEvolvement or suppression of separability or entanglement of various levels for\na quantum dynamical semigroup of completely positive maps has been studied\nusing Choi-Jamiolkowsky matrix of such maps and the famous Horodecki's criteria\n(1996). A Trichotomy Theorem has been proved, and examples have been given that\ndepend mainly on generalized Choi maps and clearly distinguish the levels of\nentanglement breaking.\n", "  In this note, we present a natural proof of a recent and surprising result of\nGregory Berkolaiko (arXiv 1110.5373) interpreting the \"Courant nodal defect\" of\na Schr\\\"odinger operator on a finite graph as a Morse index associated to the\ndeformations of the operator by switching on a magnetic field. This proof is\ninspired by a nice paper of Miroslav Fiedler published in 1975.\n", "  We derive the dispersion relation for linearized small-amplitude gravity\nwaves for various choices of non-constant vorticity. To the best of our\nknowledge, this relation is only known explicitly in the case of constant\nvorticity. We provide a wide range of examples including polynomial,\nexponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic vorticity functions.\n", "  In recent years, the BCFW construction provided a very powerful tool for\ncomputing scattering amplitudes as well as it shed light on the perturbation\ntheory structure. In this talk, we discuss the long-standing issue of the\nboundary term arising when the amplitudes do not vanish as some momenta are\ntaken to infinity along some complex direction. In particular, we provide a new\nset of on-shell recursion relations valid for such theories and discuss its\nconsequences on our understanding on the perturbation theory structure of the\nS-Matrix.\n", "  We show how D-instanton corrections modify the dilaton-axion profile emitted\nby an O7/D7 system turning it into the non-singular F-theory background which\ncorresponds to the effective coupling on a D3 probe.\n", "  We study the spontaneous motion, binary collisions, and collective dynamics\nof \"polar disks\", i.e. purpose-built particles which, when vibrated between two\nhorizontal plates, move coherently along a direction strongly correlated to\ntheir intrinsic polarity. The motion of our particles, although nominally\nthree-dimensional and complicated, is well accounted for by a two-dimensional\npersistent random walk. Their binary collisions are spatiotemporally extended\nevents during which multiple actual collisions happen, yielding a weak average\neffective alignment. We show that this well-controlled, \"dry active matter\"\nsystem can display collective motion with orientationally-ordered regions of\nthe order of the system size. We provide evidence of strong number density in\nthe most ordered regimes observed. These results are discussed in the light of\nthe limitations of our system, notably those due to the inevitable presence of\nwalls.\n", "  We present a perturbative derivation of the T-system that is believed to\nencode the exact spectrum of planar N=4 SYM. The T-system is understood as an\noperator identity between some special line operators, the quantum transfer\nmatrices. By computing the quantum corrections in the process of fusion of\ntransfer matrices, we show that the T-system holds up to first order in a\nsemi-classical expansion. This derivation does not rely on any assumption. We\nalso discuss the extension of the proof to other theories, including models\ndescribing string theory on various AdS spaces.\n", "  Using a recently developed off-shell formulation for general 4D N=2\nsupergravity-matter systems, we propose a construction to generate higher\nderivative couplings. We address here mainly the interactions of tensor and\nvector multiplets, but the construction is quite general. For a certain\nsubclass of terms, the action is naturally written as an integral over 3/4 of\nthe Grassmann coordinates of superspace.\n", "  The conjectured holographic duality between vector models with quartic\ninteraction and higher-spin field theory in the bulk is reviewed, with emphasis\non some versions and generalisations (higher dimensions, beyond the singlet\nsector, etc) which have not been much investigated yet. The strongest form of\nthe conjecture assumes that it holds for any (not necessarily large) number of\nmassless scalar fields and for any value of the coupling constant. Since the\nquartic interaction is of double-trace type, the exact duality (for any value\nof the coupling constant) automatically follows from its validity at the\nGaussian fixed point (for vanishing coupling constant). The validity of the\nlatter also implies that unbroken higher spin symmetries should prevent quantum\ncorrections in the bulk.\n", "  We review recent important topics in quantized vortices and quantum\nturbulence in atomic Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs). They have previously\nbeen studied for a long time in superfluid helium. Quantum turbulence is\ncurrently one of the most important topics in low-temperature physics. Atomic\nBECs have two distinct advantages over liquid helium for investigating such\ntopics: quantized vortices can be directly visualized and the interaction\nparameters can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance. A general introduction\nis followed by a description of the dynamics of quantized vortices,\nhydrodynamic instability, and quantum turbulence in atomic BECs.\n", "  We study the cohomology and hence $K$-theory of the aperiodic tilings formed\nby the so called 'cut and project' method, i.e., patterns in $d$ dimensional\nEuclidean space which arise as sections of higher dimensional, periodic\nstructures. They form one of the key families of patterns used in quasicrystal\nphysics, where their topological invariants carry quantum mechanical\ninformation. Our work develops both a theoretical framework and a practical\ntoolkit for the discussion and calculation of their integral cohomology, and\nextends previous work that only successfully addressed rational cohomological\ninvariants. Our framework unifies the several previous methods used to study\nthe cohomology of these patterns. We discuss explicit calculations for the main\nexamples of icosahedral patterns in $R^3$ -- the Danzer tiling, the\nAmmann-Kramer tiling and the Canonical and Dual Canonical $D_6$ tilings,\nincluding complete computations for the first of these, as well as results for\nmany of the better known 2 dimensional examples.\n", "  We give a global algebraic description of the four-form flux in F-theory. We\npresent how to compute its D3-tadpole and how to calculate the number of\nfour-dimensional chiral states at the intersection of 7-branes directly in\nF-theory. We check that, in the weak coupling limit, we obtain the same results\nas using perturbative type IIB string theory. We develop these techniques in\nfull generality. However, they can be readily applied to concrete models, as we\nshow in an explicit example.\n", "  E3-instantons that generate non-perturbative superpotentials in IIB N=1\ncompactifications are more frequent than currently believed. Worldvolume fluxes\nwill typically lift the E3-brane geometric moduli and their fermionic\nsuperpartners, leaving only the two required universal fermionic zero-modes. We\nconsistently incorporate SL(2, Z) monodromies and world-volume fluxes in the\neffective theory of the E3-brane fermions and study the resulting zero-mode\nspectrum, highlighting the relation between F-theory and perturbative IIB\nresults. This leads us to a IIB derivation of the index for generation of\nsuperpotential terms, which reproduces and generalizes available results.\nFurthermore, we show how worldvolume fluxes can be explicitly constructed in a\none-modulus compactification, such that an E3-instanton has exactly two\nfermonic zero-modes. This construction is readily applicable to numerous\nscenarios.\n", "  Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) is a noninvasive treatment for a\nvariety of musculoskeletal ailments. A shock wave is generated in water and\nthen focused using an acoustic lens or reflector so the energy of the wave is\nconcentrated in a small treatment region where mechanical stimulation enhances\nhealing. In this work we have computationally investigated shock wave\npropagation in ESWT by solving a Lagrangian form of the isentropic Euler\nequations in the fluid and linear elasticity in the bone using high-resolution\nfinite volume methods. We solve a full three-dimensional system of equations\nand use adaptive mesh refinement to concentrate grid cells near the propagating\nshock. We can model complex bone geometries, the reflection and mode conversion\nat interfaces, and the the propagation of the resulting shear stresses\ngenerated within the bone. We discuss the validity of our simplified model and\npresent results validating this approach.\n", "  We give a pedagogical introduction to D-brane instanton effects in vacuum\nconfigurations with open and unoriented strings. We focus on quiver gauge\ntheories for unoriented D-branes at orbifold singularities and describe in some\ndetail the Z_3 case, where both `gauge' and `exotic' instantons can generate\nnon-perturbative super potentials, and the Z_5 case, where supersymmetry\nbreaking may arise from the combined effect of `gauge' instantons and a FI\nD-term.\n", "  Inspired by quantum information theory, we look for representations of the\nbraid groups $B_n$ on $V^{\\otimes (n+m-2)}$ for some fixed vector space $V$\nsuch that each braid generator $\\sigma_i, i=1,...,n-1,$ acts on $m$ consecutive\ntensor factors from $i$ through $i+m-1$. The braid relation for $m=2$ is\nessentially the Yang-Baxter equation, and the cases for $m>2$ are called\ngeneralized Yang-Baxter equations. We observe that certain objects in ribbon\nfusion categories naturally give rise to such representations for the case\n$m=3$. Examples are given from the Ising theory (or the closely related\n$SU(2)_2$), $SO(N)_2$ for $N$ odd, and $SU(3)_3$. The solution from the\nJones-Kauffman theory at a $6^{th}$ root of unity, which is closely related to\n$SO(3)_2$ or $SU(2)_4$, is explicitly described in the end.\n", "  We investigate a two-electron double quantum dot with both spin and valley\ndegrees of freedom as they occur in graphene, carbon nanotubes, or silicon, and\nregard the 16-dimensional space with one electron per dot as a four-qubit logic\nspace. In the spin-only case, it is well known that the exchange coupling\nbetween the dots combined with arbitrary single-qubit operations is sufficient\nfor universal quantum computation. The presence of the valley degeneracy in the\nelectronic band structure alters the form of the exchange coupling and in\ngeneral leads to spin-valley entanglement. Here, we show that universal quantum\ncomputation can still be performed by exchange interaction and single-qubit\ngates in the presence of the additional (valley) degree of freedom. We present\nan explicit pulse sequence for a spin-only controlled-NOT consisting of the\ngeneralized exchange coupling and single-electron spin and valley rotations. We\nalso propose state preparations and projective measurements with the use of\nadiabatic transitions between states with (1,1) and (0,2) charge distributions\nsimilar to the spin-only case, but with the additional requirement of\ncontrolling the spin and the valley Zeeman energies by an external magnetic\nfield. Finally, we demonstrate a universal two-qubit gate between a spin and a\nvalley qubit, allowing universal gate operations on the combined spin and\nvalley quantum register.\n", "  Pyramidal quantum dots (QDs) grown in inverted recesses have demonstrated\nover the years an extraordinary uniformity, high spectral purity and strong\ndesign versatility. We discuss recent results, also in view of the\nStranski-Krastanow competition and give evidence for strong perspectives in\nquantum information applications for this system. We examine the possibility of\ngenerating entangled and indistinguishable photons, together with the need for\nthe implementation of a, regrettably still missing, strategy for electrical\ncontrol.\n", "  We show that the non-parabolic confinement potential is responsible for the\nnon-monotonic behavior and sign change of the exciton fine-structure splitting\n(FSS) in optically active self-assembled quantum dots. This insight is\nimportant for the theoretical understanding and practical control by electric\nfields of the quantum state of the emitted light from a biexciton cascade\nrecombination process. We find that a hard-wall (box) confinement potential\nleads to a FSS that is in better agreement with experimentally measured FSS\nthan a harmonic potential. We then show that a finite applied electric field\ncan be used to remove the FSS entirely, thus allowing for the creation of\nmaximally entangled photons, being vital to the growing field of quantum\ncommunication and quantum key distribution.\n", "  We have investigated the correlation between the microwave loss and\npatterning method for coplanar waveguide titanium nitride resonators fabricated\non Si wafers. Three different methods were investigated: fluorine- and\nchlorine-based reactive ion etches and an argon-ion mill. At high microwave\nprobe powers the reactive etched resonators showed low internal loss, whereas\nthe ion-milled samples showed dramatically higher loss. At single-photon powers\nwe found that the fluorine-etched resonators exhibited substantially lower loss\nthan the chlorine-etched ones. We interpret the results by use of numerically\ncalculated filling factors and find that the silicon surface exhibits a higher\nloss when chlorine-etched than when fluorine-etched. We also find from\nmicroscopy that re-deposition of silicon onto the photoresist and side walls is\nthe probable cause for the high loss observed for the ion-milled resonators\n", "  We consider a semiclassical $2\\times 2$ matrix Schr\\\"odinger operator of the\nform $P=-h^2\\Delta {\\bf I}_2 + {\\rm diag}(V_1(x), V_2(x)) +hR(x,hD_x)$, where\n$V_1, V_2$ are real-analytic, $V_2$ admits a non degenerate minimum at 0, $V_1$\nis non trapping at energy $V_2(0)=0$, and $R(x,hD_x)=(r_{j,k}(x,hD_x))_{1\\leq\nj,k\\leq 2}$ is a symmetric off-diagonal $2\\times 2$ matrix of first-order\npseudodifferential operators with analytic symbols. We also assume that $V_1(0)\n>0$. Then, denoting by $e_1$ the first eigenvalue of $-\\Delta + \\la\nV_2\"(0)x,x\\ra /2$, and under some ellipticity condition on $r_{1,2}$ and\nadditional generic geometric assumptions, we show that the unique resonance\n$\\rho_1$ of $P$ such that $\\rho_1 = V_2(0) + (e_1+r_{2,2}(0,0))h + {\\mathcal\nO}(h^2)$ (as $h\\rightarrow 0_+$) satisfies, $$ \\Im \\rho_1 =\n-h^{n_0+(1-n_\\Gamma)/2}f(h,\\ln\\frac1{h})e^{-2S/h}, $$ where $f(h,\\ln\\frac1{h})\n\\sim \\sum_{0\\leq m\\leq\\ell} f_{\\ell,m}h^\\ell(\\ln\\frac1{h})^m$ is a symbol with\n$f_{0,0}>0$, $S>0$ is the so-called Agmon distance associated with the\ndegenerate metric $\\max(0, \\min(V_1,V_2))dx^2$, between 0 and $\\{V_1\\leq 0\\}$,\nand $n_0\\geq 1$, $n_{\\Gamma}\\geq 0$ are integers that depend on the geometry.\n", "  We present an alternative application of discrete Morse theory for\ntwo-particle graph configuration spaces. In contrast to previous constructions,\nwhich are based on discrete Morse vector fields, our approach is through Morse\nfunctions, which have a nice physical interpretation as two-body potentials\nconstructed from one-body potentials. We also give a brief introduction to\ndiscrete Morse theory. Our motivation comes from the problem of quantum\nstatistics for particles on networks, for which generalized versions of anyon\nstatistics can appear.\n", "  We describe an all-optical scheme for spin manipulation in the ground-state\ntriplet of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond.\nVirtual optical excitation from the 3A_2 ground state into the 3E excited state\nallows for spin rotations by virtue of the spin-spin interaction in the\ntwo-fold orbitally degenerate excited state. We derive an effective Hamiltonian\nfor optically induced spin-flip transitions within the ground state spin\ntriplet due to off-resonant optical pumping. Furthermore, we investigate the\nspin qubit formed by the Zeeman sub-levels with spin projection m_S = 0 and m_S\n= -1 along the NV axis around the ground state level anticrossing with regard\nto full optical control of the electron spin.\n", "  We use the geometry of the moment map to investigate properties of pure\nentangled states of composite quantum systems. The orbits of equally entangled\nstates are mapped by the moment map on coadjoint orbits of local\ntransformations (unitary transformations which do not change entanglement),\nthus the geometry of coadjoint orbits provides a partial classification of\ndifferent entanglement classes. To achieve the full classification a further\nstudy of fibers of the moment map is needed. We show how this can be done\neffectively in the case of the bipartite entanglement by employing Brion's\ntheorem. In particular, we presented the exact description of the partial\nsymplectic structure of all local orbits for two bosons, fermions and\ndistinguishable particles.\n", "  We establish the family rigidity and vanishing theorems on the equivariant\n$K$-theory level for the Witten type operators on String$^c$ manifolds\nintroduced by Chen-Han-Zhang.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally the existence of a purely elastic fingering\ninstability which arises when air penetrates into an elastomer confined in a\nHele-Shaw cell. Fingers appear sequentially and propagate within the bulk of\nthe material as soon as a critical strain, independent of the elastic modulus,\nis exceeded. Their width depends non-linearly on the distance between the\nconfining glass plates. A key element in the driving force of the instability\nis the adhesion of layers of gels to the plates, which results in a\nconsiderable expense of elastic energy during the growth of the air bubble.\n", "  We study the long-time behavior of the 3-dimensional repulsive nonlinear\nHartree equation with an external attractive Coulomb potential $-Z/|x|$, which\nis a nonlinear model for the quantum dynamics of an atom. We show that, after a\nsufficiently long time, the average number of electrons in any finite ball is\nalways smaller than 4Z (respectively 2Z in the radial case). This is a\ntime-dependent generalization of a celebrated result by E.H. Lieb on the\nmaximum negative ionization of atoms in the stationary case. Our proof involves\na novel positive commutator argument (based on the cubic weight $|x|^3$) and\nour findings are reminiscent of the RAGE theorem. In addition, we prove a\nsimilar universal bound on the local kinetic energy. In particular, our main\nresult means that, in a weak sense, any solution is attracted to a bounded set\nin the energy space, whatever the size of the initial datum. Moreover, we\nextend our main result to Hartree--Fock theory and to the linear many-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for atoms.\n", "  We analyze form the topological perspective the space of all SLOCC\n(Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication) classes of pure\nstates for composite quantum systems. We do it for both distinguishable and\nindistinguishable particles. In general, the topology of this space is rather\ncomplicated as it is a non-Hausdorff space. Using geometric invariant theory\n(GIT) and momentum map geometry we propose a way to divide the space of all\nSLOCC classes into mathematically and physically meaningful families. Each\nfamily consists of possibly many `asymptotically' equivalent SLOCC classes.\nMoreover, each contains exactly one distinguished SLOCC class on which the\ntotal variance (a well defined measure of entanglement) of the state Var[v]\nattains maximum. We provide an algorithm for finding critical sets of Var[v],\nwhich makes use of the convexity of the momentum map and allows classification\nof such defined families of SLOCC classes. The number of families is in general\ninfinite. We introduce an additional refinement into finitely many groups of\nfamilies using the recent developments in the momentum map geometry known as\nNess stratification. We also discuss how to define it equivalently using the\nconvexity of the momentum map applied to SLOCC classes. Moreover, we note that\nthe Morse index at the critical set of the total variance of state has an\ninterpretation of number of non-SLOCC directions in which entanglement\nincreases and calculate it for several exemplary systems. Finally, we introduce\nthe SLOCC-invariant measure of entanglement as a square root of the total\nvariance of state at the critical point and explain its geometric meaning.\n", "  We present a general algorithm for finding all classes of pure multiparticle\nstates equivalent under Stochastic Local Operations and Classsical\nCommunication (SLOCC). We parametrize all SLOCC classes by the critical sets of\nthe total variance function. Our method works for arbitrary systems of\ndistinguishable and indistinguishable particles. We also discuss the Morse\nindices of critical points which have the interpretation of the number of\nindependent non-local perturbations increasing the variance and hence\nentanglement of a state. We illustrate our method by two examples.\n", "  From a coarse-grained perspective the motif of a self-activating species,\nactivating a second species which acts as its own repressor, is widely found in\nbiological systems, in particular in genetic systems with inherent oscillatory\nbehavior. Here we consider a specific realization of this motif as a genetic\ncircuit, in which genes are described as directly producing proteins, leaving\nout the intermediate step of mRNA production. We focus on the effect that\ninherent time scales on the underlying fine-grained scale can have on the\nbifurcation patterns on a coarser scale in time. Time scales are set by the\nbinding and unbinding rates of the transcription factors to the promoter\nregions of the genes. Depending on the ratio of these rates to the decay times\nof the proteins, the appropriate averaging procedure for obtaining a\ncoarse-grained description changes and leads to sets of deterministic\nequations, which differ in their bifurcation structure. In particular the\ndesired intermediate range of regular limit cycles fades away when the binding\nrates of genes are of the same order or less than the decay time of at least\none of the proteins. Our analysis illustrates that the common topology of the\nwidely found motif alone does not necessarily imply universal features in the\ndynamics.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator on a compact hypersurface in \\mathds{R}^{n+1} as it is flattened into\na singular double-sided flat hypersurface. We show that the limit spectral\nproblem corresponds to the Dirichlet and Neumann problems on one side of this\nflat (Euclidean) limit, and derive an explicit three-term asymptotic expansion\nfor the eigenvalues where the remaining two terms are of orders\n\\varepsilon^2\\log\\varepsilon and \\varepsilon^2.\n", "  In this paper we prove uniqueness for an inverse boundary value problem\n(IBVP) arising in electrodynamics. We assume that the electromagnetic\nproperties of the medium, namely the magnetic permeability, the electric\npermittivity and the conductivity, are described by continuously differentiable\nfunctions.\n", "  In this paper we are discussing the question how a continuous quantum system\ncan be simulated by mean field fluctuations of a finite number of qubits. On\nthe kinematical side this leads to a convergence result which states that\nappropriately chosen fluctuation operators converge in a certain weak sense\n(i.e. we are comparing expectation values) to canonical position and momentum\nQ, P of one-degree of freedom, continuous quantum system. This result is\nsubstantially stronger than existing methods which rely either on central limit\ntheorem arguments (and are therefore restricted to the Gaussian world) or are\nvalid only if the states of the ensembles are close to the \"fully polarized\"\nstate. Dynamically this relationship keeps perfectly intact (at least for small\ntimes) as long as the continuous system evolves according to a quadratic\nHamiltonian. In other words we can approximate the corresponding (Heisenberg\npicture) time evolution of the canonical operators Q, P up to arbitrary\naccuracy by the appropriately chosen time evolution of fluctuation operators of\nthe finite systems.\n", "  We consider the one dimensional focusing (cubic) Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (NLS) in the semiclassical limit with exponentially decaying\ncomplex-valued initial data, whose phase is multiplied by a real parameter. We\nprove smooth dependence of the asymptotic solution on the parameter. Numerical\nresults supporting our estimates of important quantities are presented.\n", "  In this paper we consider the time dependent one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with multiple Dirac delta potentials {of different strengths}. We\nprove that the classical dispersion property holds under some restrictions on\nthe strengths and on the lengths of the finite intervals. The result is\nobtained in a more general setting of a Laplace operator on a tree with\n$\\delta$-coupling conditions at the vertices. The proof relies on a careful\nanalysis of the properties of the resolvent of the associated Hamiltonian. With\nrespect to the analysis done in \\cite{MR2858075} for Kirchhoff conditions, here\nthe resolvent is no longer in the framework of Wiener algebra of almost\nperiodic functions, and its expression is harder to analyze.\n", "  The spin of a single electron in a suspended carbon nanotube can be read out\nby using its coupling to the nano-mechanical motion of the nanotube. To show\nthis, we consider a single electron confined within a quantum dot formed by the\nsuspended carbon nanotube. The spin- orbit interaction induces a coupling\nbetween the spin and one of the bending modes of the suspended part of the\nnanotube. We calculate the response of the system to pulsed external driving of\nthe mechanical motion using a Jaynes-Cummings model. To account for resonator\ndamping, we solve a quantum master equation, with parameters comparable to\nthose used in recent experiments, and show how information of the spin state of\nthe system can be acquired by measuring its mechanical motion. The latter can\nbe detected by observing the current through a nearby charge detector.\n", "  We formulate low Mach number fluctuating hydrodynamic equations appropriate\nfor modeling diffusive mixing in isothermal mixtures of fluids with different\ndensity and transport coefficients. These equations eliminate the fluctuations\nin pressure associated with the propagation of sound waves by replacing the\nequation of state with a local thermodynamic constraint. We demonstrate that\nthe low Mach number model preserves the spatio-temporal spectrum of the slower\ndiffusive fluctuations. We develop a strictly conservative finite-volume\nspatial discretization of the low Mach number fluctuating equations in both two\nand three dimensions and construct several explicit Runge-Kutta temporal\nintegrators that strictly maintain the equation of state constraint. The\nresulting spatio-temporal discretization is second-order accurate\ndeterministically and maintains fluctuation-dissipation balance in the\nlinearized stochastic equations. We apply our algorithms to model the\ndevelopment of giant concentration fluctuations in the presence of\nconcentration gradients, and investigate the validity of common simplifications\nsuch as neglecting the spatial non-homogeneity of density and transport\nproperties. We perform simulations of diffusive mixing of two fluids of\ndifferent densities in two dimensions and compare the results of low Mach\nnumber continuum simulations to hard-disk molecular dynamics simulations.\nExcellent agreement is observed between the particle and continuum simulations\nof giant fluctuations during time-dependent diffusive mixing.\n", "  Modeling of ion transport via plasma membrane needs identification and\nquantitative understanding of the involved processes. Brief characterization of\nmain ion transport systems of a yeast cell (Pma1, Ena1, TOK1, Nha1, Trk1, Trk2,\nnon-selective cation conductance) and determining the exact number of molecules\nof each transporter per a typical cell allow us to predict the corresponding\nion flows. In this review a comparison of ion transport in small yeast cell and\nseveral animal cell types is provided. The importance of cell volume to surface\nratio is emphasized. The role of cell wall and lipid rafts is discussed in\nrespect to required increase in spatial and temporal resolution of\nmeasurements. Conclusions are formulated to describe specific features of ion\ntransport in a yeast cell. Potential directions of future research are outlined\nbased on the assumptions.\n", "  We want to find the cosmological constant influence on cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) temperature due to moving linear cosmic strings. Considering\nthe space-time metric of a linear cosmic string in an accelerated expanding\nuniverse, the Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect, as an important mechanism in\nproducing temperature discontinuity in the CMB, is considered and its\nmodification due to the effect of the cosmological constant is calculated. The\nresult shows that a positive cosmological constant (i.e. the presence of cosmic\nstrings in an accelerated expanding universe) weakens the discontinuity in\ntemperature so that more strong resolution is needed to detect the\ncorresponding influences on the CMB power spectrum and anisotropy.\n", "  We show that in the absence of a magnetic field the spectrum of the magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operator in an annulus depends on the cosine of the flux\nassociated with the magnetic potential. This result follows from an analysis of\na singularity in the wave trace for this Schr\\\"odinger operator, and hence\nshows that even in the absence of a magnetic field the magnetic potential can\nchange the asymptotics of the Schr\\\"odinger spectrum, i.e. the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect takes place. We also study the Aharonov-Bohm effect for the magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operator on a torus.\n", "  We describe a geometric theory of Virasoro constraints in generalized\nDrinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies. Solutions of Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies are\nsuccinctly described by giving a principal bundle on a complex curve together\nwith the data of a Higgs field near infinity. String solutions for these\nhierarchies are defined as points having a big stabilizer under a certain Lie\nalgebra action. We characterize principal bundles coming from string solutions\nas those possessing connections compatible with the Higgs field near infinity.\nWe show that tau-functions of string solutions satisfy second-order\ndifferential equations generalizing the Virasoro constraints of 2d quantum\ngravity.\n", "  In this paper, we shed light on relations between three concepts studied in\nrepresentations theory, algebraic geometry and quantum information theory.\nFirst - spherical actions of reductive groups on projective spaces. Second -\nsecant varieties of homogeneous projective varieties, and the related notions\nof rank and border rank. Third - quantum entanglement. Our main result concerns\nthe relation between the problem of the state reconstruction from its reduced\none-particle density matrices and the minimal number of separable summands in\nits decomposition. More precisely, we show that sphericity implies that states\nof a given rank cannot be approximated by states of a lower rank. We call\nstates for which such approximation is possible exceptional states. For three,\nimportant from quantum entanglement perspective cases of distinguishable,\nfermionic and bosonic particles, we also show that non-sphericity implies the\nexistence of exceptional states. Remarkably, the exceptional states belong to\nnon-bipartite entanglement classes. In particular, we show that the $W$-type\nstates and their appropriate modifications are exceptional states stemming from\nthe second secant variety for three cases above. We point out that the\nexistence of the exceptional states is a physical obstruction for deciding the\nlocal unitary equivalence of states by means of the one-particle reduced\ndensity matrices. Finally, for a number of systems of distinguishable particles\nwith known orbit structure we list all exceptional states and discuss their\npossible importance in entanglement theory.\n", "  We consider a class of equations with the fractional differentiation operator\n$D^\\alpha$, $\\alpha >0$, for complex-valued functions $x\\mapsto f(|x|_K)$ on a\nnon-Archimedean local field $K$ depending only on the absolute value $|\\cdot\n|_K$. We introduce a right inverse $I^\\alpha$ to $D^\\alpha$, such that the\nchange of an unknown function $u=I^\\alpha v$ reduces the Cauchy problem for an\nequation with $D^\\alpha$ (for radial functions) to an integral equation whose\nproperties resemble those of classical Volterra equations. This contrasts much\nmore complicated behavior of $D^\\alpha$ on other classes of functions.\n", "  We derive an exact expression for the time-averaged electromagnetic energy\ninside a chiral dispersive sphere irradiated by a plane wave. The dispersion\nrelations correspond to a chiral metamaterial consisting of uncoupled\nsingle-resonance helical resonators. Using a field decomposition scheme and a\ngeneral expression for the electromagnetic energy density in bi-anisotropic\nmedia, we calculate the Lorenz-Mie solution for the internal fields in a medium\nthat is simultaneously magnetic and chiral. We also obtain an explicit\nanalytical relation between the internal electromagnetic field and the\nabsorption cross-section. This result is applied to demonstrate that strong\nchirality leads to an off-resonance field enhancement within weakly absorb.ing\nspheres.\n", "  A generalized eigenvalue algorithm for tridiagonal matrix pencils is\npresented. The algorithm appears as the time evolution equation of a\nnonautonomous discrete integrable system associated with a polynomial sequence\nwhich has some orthogonality on the support set of the zeros of the\ncharacteristic polynomial for a tridiagonal matrix pencil. The convergence of\nthe algorithm is discussed by using the solution to the initial value problem\nfor the corresponding discrete integrable system.\n", "  We construct quasimodes for the Klein-Gordon equation on the black hole\nexterior of Kerr-Anti-de Sitter (Kerr-AdS) spacetimes. Such quasi-modes are\nassociated with time-periodic approximate solutions of the Klein Gordon\nequation and provide natural candidates to probe the decay of solutions on\nthese backgrounds. They are constructed as the solutions of a semi-classical\nnon-linear eigenvalue problem arising after separation of variables, with the\n(inverse of the) angular momentum playing the role of the semi-classical\nparameter. Our construction results in exponentially small errors in the\nsemi-classical parameter. This implies that general solutions to the Klein\nGordon equation on Kerr-AdS cannot decay faster than logarithmically. The\nlatter result completes previous work by the authors, where a logarithmic decay\nrate was established as an upper bound.\n", "  A uniform asymptotic theory of the free-space paraxial propagation of\ncoherent flattened Gaussian beams is proposed in the limit of nonsmall Fresnel\nnumbers. The pivotal role played by the error function in the mathematical\ndescription of the related wavefield is stressed.\n", "  We present a scheme for full quantum state tomography tailored for two spin\nqubits in a double quantum dot. A set of 15 quantum states allows to determine\nthe density matrix in this two-qubit space by projective measurement. In this\npaper we choose a set gained from mutually unbiased bases. We determine how\nthose 15 projections can be represented by charge measurements after a\nspin-to-charge conversion and the application of quantum gates. The quantum\ngates include exchange-based gates as well as rotations by electron spin\nresonance (ESR). We assume the experimental realization of ESR operations to be\nmore difficult than the exchange gate operation. Therefore, it is an important\nresult that the ESR gates are limited by a pi/2 rotation for one of the\nelectron spins per measurement.\n", "  We consider the hyperboloidal initial value problem for the cubic focusing\nwave equation. Without symmetry assumptions, we prove the existence of a\nco-dimension 4 Lipschitz manifold of initial data that lead to global solutions\nin forward time which do not scatter to free waves.\n", "  Vibrated polar disks have been used experimentally to investigate collective\nmotion of driven particles, where fully-ordered asymptotic regimes could not be\nreached. Here we present a model reproducing quantitatively the single, binary\nand collective properties of this granular system. Using system sizes not\naccessible in the laboratory, we show in silico that true long-range order is\npossible in the experimental system. Exploring the model's parameter space, we\nfind a phase diagram qualitatively different from that of dilute or point-like\nparticle systems.\n", "  We develop a full characterization of abelian quantum statistics on graphs.\nWe explain how the number of anyon phases is related to connectivity. For\n2-connected graphs the independence of quantum statistics with respect to the\nnumber of particles is proven. For non-planar 3-connected graphs we identify\nbosons and fermions as the only possible statistics, whereas for planar\n3-connected graphs we show that one anyon phase exists. Our approach also\nyields an alternative proof of the structure theorem for the first homology\ngroup of n-particle graph configuration spaces. Finally, we determine the\ntopological gauge potentials for 2-connected graphs.\n", "  We address the question of which convex shapes, when packed as densely as\npossible under certain restrictions, fill the least space and leave the most\nempty space. In each different dimension and under each different set of\nrestrictions, this question is expected to have a different answer or perhaps\nno answer at all. As the problem of identifying global minima in most cases\nappears to be beyond current reach, in this paper we focus on local minima. We\nreview some known results and prove these new results: in two dimensions, the\nregular heptagon is a local minimum of the double-lattice packing density, and\nin three dimensions, the directional derivative (in the sense of Minkowski\naddition) of the double-lattice packing density at the point in the space of\nshapes corresponding to the ball is in every direction positive.\n", "  In this paper we show all possible ramps where an object can move with\nconstant speed under the effect of gravity and friction. The planar ramp are\nvery easy to describe, just rotate a curve with velocity vector\n(tanh(as),sech(as)). Recall that tanh(as)^2+sech^2(as) = 1. Therefore, the\nsolution of the planar constant speed problem is connected with easy to\ndescribe examples of curves with arc-length parameter. For ramps in the space,\nwe show that there are as many ramps as tangent unit vector fields in the south\nhemisphere. A video explaining these results can be found at\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBrvbb0efVk\n", "  We study the dynamical behaviour of the quantum cellular automaton of Refs.\n[1, 2], which reproduces the Dirac dynamics in the limit of small wavevectors\nand masses. We present analytical evaluations along with computer simulations,\nshowing how the automaton exhibits typical Dirac dynamical features, as the\nZitterbewegung and the scattering behaviour from potential that gives rise to\nthe so-called Klein paradox. The motivation is to show concretely how pure\nprocessing of quantum information can lead to particle mechanics as an emergent\nfeature, an issue that has been the focus of solid-state, optical and\natomic-physics quantum simulator.\n", "  The Jamming of soft spheres at zero temperature, the J-point, has been\nextensively studied both numerically and theoretically and can now be\nconsidered as a safe location in the space of models, where a street lamp has\nbeen lit up. However, a recent work by Ikeda et al, 2013 reveals that, in the\nTemperature/Packing fraction parameter space, experiments on colloids are\nactually rather far away from the scaling regime illuminated by this lamp. Is\nit that the J-point has little to say about real system? What about granular\nmedia? Such a-thermal, frictional, systems are a-priori even further away from\nthe idealized case of thermal soft spheres. In the past ten years, we have\nsystematically investigated horizontally shaken grains in the vicinity of the\nJamming transition. We discuss the above issue in the light of very recent\nexperimental results. First, we demonstrate that the contact network exhibits a\nremarkable dynamics, with strong heterogeneities, which are maximum at a\npacking fraction phi star, distinct and smaller than the packing fraction phi\ndagger, where the average number of contact per particle starts to increase.\nThe two cross-overs converge at point J in the zero mechanical excitation\nlimit. Second, a careful analysis of the dynamics on time scales ranging from a\nminute fraction of the vibration cycle to several thousands of cycles allows us\nto map the behaviors of this shaken granular system onto those observed for\nthermal soft spheres and demonstrate that some light of the J-point street-lamp\nindeed reaches the granular universe.\n", "  We show that multipartite mixed bipartite CC and CQ states are geometrically\nand topologically distinguished in the space of states. They are characterized\nby non-vanishing Euler-Poincar\\'{e} characteristics on the topological side and\nby the existence of symplectic structure on the geometric side.\n", "  We present a ray transfer matrix for a spiral phase plate. Using this matrix,\nwe determine the stability of an optical resonator made of two spiral phase\nplates, and trace stable ray orbits in the resonator. Our results should be\nrelevant to laser physics, optical micromanipulation, quantum information and\noptomechanics.\n", "  A method for active control of the spatial profile of a laser beam using\nadaptive thermal lensing is described. A segmented electrical heater was used\nto generate thermal gradients across a transmissive optical element, resulting\nin a controllable thermal lens. The segmented heater also allows the generation\nof cylindrical lenses, and provides the capability to steer the beam in both\nhorizontal and vertical planes. Using this device as an actuator, a feedback\ncontrol loop was developed to stabilize the beam size and position.\n", "  We examine the influence of nuclear spins on the performance of optically\ninduced rotations of single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots. We\nconsider Raman type optical transitions between electron spin states and take\ninto account the additional effect of the Overhauser field. We calculate\naverage fidelities of rotations around characteristic axes in the presence of\nnuclear spins analytically with perturbation theory up to second order in the\nOverhauser field. Moreover, we calculate the fidelity using numerical averaging\nover the nuclear field distribution, including arbitrary orders of the\nhyperfine interaction.\n", "  We study the long-time dynamics of complex-valued modified Korteweg-de Vries\n(mKdV) solitons, which are recognized because they blow-up in finite time. We\nestablish stability properties at the H^1 level of regularity, uniformly away\nfrom each blow-up point. These new properties are used to prove that mKdV\nbreathers are H^1 stable, improving our previous result, where we only proved\nH^2 stability. The main new ingredient of the proof is the use of a B\\\"acklund\ntransformation which links the behavior of breathers, complex-valued solitons\nand small real-valued solutions of the mKdV equation. We also prove that\nnegative energy breathers are asymptotically stable. Since we do not use any\nmethod relying on the Inverse Scattering Transformation, our proof works even\nunder rough perturbations, provided a corresponding local well-posedness theory\nis available.\n", "  In this paper we show that the new approach to the embedding of the\ninflationary potentials into supergravity, presented in a quite recent paper\n[11] of Ferrara, Kallosh, Linde and Porrati can be formulated within the\nframework of standard matter coupled supergravity, without the use of the new\nminimal auxiliary set and of conformal compensators. The only condition is the\nexistence of a translational Peccei Quinn isometry of the scalar Kahler\nmanifold. We suggest that this embedding strategy based on a nilpotent gauging\namounts to a profound Copernican Revolution. The properties of the inflaton\npotential are encoded in the geometry of some homogeneous one-dimensional\nKahler manifolds that now should be regarded as the primary object, possibly\nproviding a link with microscopic physics. We present a simple and elegant\nformula for the curvature of the Kahler manifold in terms of the potential.\nMost relevant consequence of the new strategy is that all the integrable\npotentials quite recently classified in a paper [7] that we have coauthored,\nare automatically embedded into supergravity and their associated Kahler\nmanifolds demand urgent study. In particular one integrable potential that\nprovides the best fit to PLANCK data seems to have inspiring geometrical\nproperties deserving further study.\n", "  Thanks to an approach inspired from Burq-Lebeau \\cite{bule}, we prove\nstochastic versions of Strichartz estimates for Schr\\\"odinger with harmonic\npotential. As a consequence, we show that the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith quadratic potential and any polynomial non-linearity is almost surely\nlocally well-posed in $L^{2}(\\R^{d})$ for any $d\\geq 2$. Then, we show that we\ncan combine this result with the high-low frequency decomposition method of\nBourgain to prove a.s. global well-posedness results for the cubic equation:\nwhen $d=2$, we prove global well-posedness in $\\H^{s}(\\R^{2})$ for any $s>0$,\nand when $d=3$ we prove global well-posedness in $\\H^{s}(\\R^{3})$ for any\n$s>1/6$, which is a supercritical regime. Furthermore, we also obtain almost\nsure global well-posedness results with scattering for NLS on $\\R^{d}$ without\npotential. We prove scattering results for $L^2-$supercritical equations and\n$L^2-$subcritical equations with initial conditions in $L^2$ without additional\ndecay or regularity assumption.\n", "  In this paper we derive acoustic metrics in the (3+1)-dimensional Abelian\nHiggs model with higher derivative terms. We have found acoustic metrics that\nare conformally related to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om and Kerr-Newman metrics.\nThe universal aspects of area products which depend only on quantized\nquantities such as conserved electric charge and angular momentum are also\naddressed. We relate these areas with entanglement entropy of acoustic black\nholes in BEC systems. We also have shown there is an equivalence between\nmicroscopic descriptions of axisymmetric acoustic black hole entropy in a BEC\nsystem in four and two dimensions. Particularly, the system seems to develop an\nanalogue of the Kerr/CFT correspondence.\n", "  We show that double-charged optical vortices can be generated with the help\nof Kerr electrooptic effect in either single crystals or isotropic media,\nincluding gaseous and liquid ones. We analyze possibilities for the vortex\ngeneration via the Kerr effect for different point group of symmetry and\nformulate the appropriate conditions. We prove that the crystals, textures and\nthe isotropic media most suitable for the generation of double-charged optical\nvortices should belong to the symmetry groups 622, 6mm, 6/mmm, 6, 6/m, inf/m,\ninf, inf 2, inf mm, inf/mmm, inf/inf/mmm, and inf/inf2.\n", "  In this article, we state the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions around a singular\nvalue of hyperbolic type of the principal symbol of a self-adjoint\nsemiclassical Toeplitz operator on a compact connected K\\\"{a}hler surface.\nThese conditions allow the description of the spectrum of the operator in a\nfixed size neighbourhood of the singularity. We provide numerical computations\nfor three examples, each associated to a different topology.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear Hartree equation for an interacting gas containing\ninfinitely many particles and we investigate the large-time stability of the\nstationary states of the form $f(-\\Delta)$, describing an homogeneous Fermi\ngas. Under suitable assumptions on the interaction potential and on the\nmomentum distribution $f$, we prove that the stationary state is asymptotically\nstable in dimension 2. More precisely, for any initial datum which is a small\nperturbation of $f(-\\Delta)$ in a Schatten space, the system weakly converges\nto the stationary state for large times.\n", "  Let $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ be irrational and $[0;a_1,a_2,\\cdots]$ be the continued\nfraction expansion of $\\alpha$. Let $H_{\\alpha,V}$ be the Sturm Hamiltonian\nwith frequency $\\alpha$ and coupling $V$, $\\Sigma_{\\alpha,V}$ be the spectrum\nof $H_{\\alpha,V}$. The fractal dimensions of the spectrum have been determined\nby Fan, Liu and Wen (Erg. Th. Dyn. Sys.,2011) when $\\{a_n\\}_{n\\ge1}$ is\nbounded. The present paper will treat the most difficult case, i.e,\n$\\{a_n\\}_{n\\ge1}$ is unbounded. We prove that for $V\\ge24$, $$ \\dim_H\\\n\\Sigma_{\\alpha,V}=s_*(V)\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\bar{\\dim}_B\\\n\\Sigma_{\\alpha,V}=s^*(V), $$ where $s_*(V)$ and $s^*(V)$ are lower and upper\npre-dimensions respectively. By this result, we determine the fractal\ndimensions of the spectrums for all Sturm Hamiltonians.\n  We also show the following results: $s_*(V)$ and $s^*(V)$ are Lipschitz\ncontinuous on any bounded interval of $[24,\\infty)$; the limits $s_*(V)\\ln V$\nand $s^*(V)\\ln V$ exist as $V$ tend to infinity, and the limits are constants\nonly depending on $\\alpha$; $s^\\ast(V)=1$ if and only if\n$\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}(a_1\\cdots a_n)^{1/n}=\\infty,$ which can be compared with\nthe fact: $s_\\ast(V)=1$ if and only if $\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}(a_1\\cdots\na_n)^{1/n}=\\infty$(Liu and Wen, Potential anal. 2004).\n", "  Character formulas for Lie superalgebras have been shown to have important\napplications to number theory and combinatorics. We prove the Kac-Wakimoto\ncharacter formula for the general linear Lie superalgebra gl(m|n). This formula\nspecializes to the well-known Kac-Weyl character formula when the modules are\ntypical and to the Weyl denominator identity when the module is trivial. We\nalso prove a determinantal character formula for KW-modules using the\nKac-Wakimoto character formula.\n", "  We study the problem of partially ordered phases with periodically arranged\ndisordered (paramagnetic) sites on the pyrochlore lattice, a network of\ncorner-sharing tetrahedra. The periodicity of these phases is characterized by\none or more wave vectors k=(1/2 1/2 1/2). Starting from a general microscopic\nHamiltonian including anisotropic nearest-neighbor exchange, long-range dipolar\ninteractions and second- and third-nearest neighbor exchange, we identify using\nstandard mean-field theory (s-MFT) an extended range of interaction parameters\nthat support partially ordered phases. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations\nignored in s-MFT are responsible for the selection of one particular partially\nordered phase, e.g. the \"4-k\" phase over the \"1-k\" phase. We suggest that the\ntransition into the 4-k phase is continuous with its critical properties\ncontrolled by the cubic fixed point of a Ginzburg-Landau theory with a\n4-component vector order-parameter. By combining an extension of the\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer method originally used to study fluctuations in spin\nglasses with parallel-tempering Monte-Carlo simulations, we establish the phase\ndiagram for different types of partially ordered phases. Our results elucidate\nthe long-standing puzzle concerning the origin of the 4-k partially ordered\nphase observed in the Gd2Ti2O7 dipolar pyrochlore antiferromagnet below its\nparamagnetic phase transition temperature.\n", "  At small lattice spacing QCD simulations are expected to become stuck in a\nsingle topological sector. Observables evaluated in a fixed topological sector\ndiffer from their counterparts in full QCD, i.e. at unfixed topology, by volume\ndependent corrections. We investigate these corrections in the two-flavor\nSchwinger model, which is in several aspects similar to QCD, using Wilson\nfermions. We also try to remove these corrections by suitable extrapolations to\ninfinite volume.\n", "  In this paper we provide a definition of the D-map, namely of the\nmathematical construction implicitly utilized by supergravity that associates\nan axial symmetric Kahler surface to every positive definite potential function\nV(phi). The properties of the D-map are discussed in general. Then the D-map is\napplied to the list of integrable cosmological potentials classified by us in a\nprevious publication with A. Sagnotti. Several interesting geometrical and\nanalytical properties of the manifolds in the image of this D-map are\ndiscovered and illustrated. As a by-product of our analysis we demonstrate the\nexistence of (integrable) Starobinsky-like potentials that can be embedded into\nsupergravity. Some of them follow from constant curvature Kahler manifolds. In\nthe quest for a microscopic interpretation of inflaton dynamics we present the\nAriadne's thread provided by a new mathematical concept that we introduce under\nthe name of axial symmetric descendants of one dimensional special Kahler\nmanifolds. By means of this token we define a clearcut algorithm that to each\npotential function V(phi) associates a unique 4th order Picard-Fuchs equation\nof restricted type. Such an equation encodes information on the chiral ring of\na superconformal field theory to be sought for, unveiling in this way a\nmicroscopic interpretation of the inflaton potential. We conjecture that the\nphysical mechanism at the basis of the transition from a special manifold to\nits axial symmetric descendant is probably the construction of an Open String\ndescendant of a Closed String model.\n", "  We provide an informal up-to-date review of the tensor track approach to\nquantum gravity. In a long introduction we describe in simple terms the\nmotivations for this approach. Then the many recent advances are summarized,\nwith emphasis on some points (Gromov-Hausdorff limit, Loop vertex expansion,\nOsterwalder-Schrader positivity...) which, while important for the tensor track\nprogram, are not detailed in the usual quantum gravity literature. We list open\nquestions in the conclusion and provide a rather extended bibliography.\n", "  It is known that using the Gaussian beam approximation one can show that\nthere exist solutions of the wave equation on a general globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian manifold whose energy is localised along a given null geodesic for a\nfinite, but arbitrarily long time. In this paper, we show that the energy of\nsuch a localised solution is determined by the energy of the underlying null\ngeodesic. This result opens the door to various applications of Gaussian beams\non Lorentzian manifolds that do not admit a globally timelike Killing vector\nfield. In particular we show that trapping in the exterior of Kerr or at the\nhorizon of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole necessarily leads to a\n`loss of derivative' in a local energy decay statement. We also demonstrate the\nobstruction formed by the red-shift effect at the event horizon of a\nSchwarzschild black hole to scattering constructions from the future (where the\nred-shift turns into a blue-shift): we construct solutions to the backwards\nproblem whose energies grow exponentially for a finite, but arbitrarily long\ntime. Finally, we give a simple mathematical realisation of the heuristics for\nthe blue-shift effect near the Cauchy horizon of sub-extremal and extremal\nblack holes: we construct a sequence of solutions to the wave equation whose\ninitial energies are uniformly bounded, whereas the energy near the Cauchy\nhorizon goes to infinity.\n", "  With a parametric form of the equation of state parameter of dark energy, a\nquintessence potential has been reconstructed. The potential is found to be a\ngeneralization of a double exponential potential. The constraints on the\nparameters are obtained by maximum likelihood analysis using observational\nHubble data, type Ia supernova data, baryon acoustic oscillation data and the\nCMB shift parameter data. Th emodel shows preference towards the phantom\nbehaviour of dark energy.\n", "  This paper puts the theory of quasi-Hamiltonian reduction in the framework of\nshifted symplectic structures developed by Pantev, To\\\"{e}n, Vaqui\\'{e} and\nVezzosi. We compute the symplectic structures on mapping stacks and show how\nthe AKSZ topological field theory defined by Calaque allows one to neatly\npackage the constructions used in quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. Finally, we\nexplain how a prequantization of character stacks can be obtained purely\nlocally.\n", "  We have investigated electronic and magnetic properties of ultrathin\nSrRuO$_{3}$ (SRO) film grown on (111) SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate using the {\\it ab\ninitio} electronic structure calculations. Ru-terminated SRO (111) film suffers\nfrom strong surface atomic relaxations, while SrO$_{3}$-terminated one\npreserves the surface structure of ideal perovskites. Both Ru- and\nSrO$_{3}$-terminated SRO (111) film show unexpected interlayer\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) structure at the surface, but with different characters\nand mechanisms. The AFM structure for the former results from the large surface\natomic relaxation, whereas that for the latter results from the truncated film\neffect. Interestingly, for the SrO$_{3}$-termination case, the half-metallic\nnature emerges despite the interlayer AFM structure. Upon reducing the\nthickness, the collapsing behavior of magnetic anisotropy from out-of-plane to\nin-plane easy axis is found to occur for the Ru-termination case, which,\nhowever, does not pertain to SrO$_{3}$-termination case.\n", "  I show that Aristotelian physics is a correct and non-intuitive approximation\nof Newtonian physics in the suitable domain (motion in fluids), in the same\ntechnical sense in which Newton theory is an approximation of Einstein's\ntheory. Aristotelian physics lasted long not because it became dogma, but\nbecause it is a very good empirically grounded theory. The observation suggests\nsome general considerations on inter-theoretical relations.\n", "  We performed systematic thermal conductivity measurements on heavily\nhole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals with 0.747 $\\leq x \\leq$\n0.974. At $x$ = 0.747, the $\\kappa_0/T$ is negligible, indicating nodeless\nsuperconducting gap. A small residual linear term $\\kappa_0/T$ ($\\approx$ 0.035\nmW/K$^2$ cm) appears at $x$ = 0.826, and it increases slowly up to $x$ = 0.974,\nfollowed by a drastic increase of more than 20 times to the pure KFe$_2$As$_2$\n($x$ = 1.0). This doping dependence of $\\kappa_0/T$ clearly shows that the\nnodal gap appears near $x = 0.8$, likely associated with the change of Fermi\nsurface topology. The small values of $\\kappa_0/T$ from $x$ = 0.826 to 0.974\nsupport a \"$\\curlyvee$\"-shaped nodal $s$-wave gap recently revealed by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments at $x$ = 0.9.\nFurthermore, the drastic increase of $\\kappa_0/T$ from $x$ = 0.974 to 1.0 is\ninconsistent with a symmetry-imposed $d$-wave gap in KFe$_2$As$_2$, and the\npossible nodal gap structure in KFe$_2$As$_2$ is discussed.\n", "  Effective topological field theories describe the properties of Dirac\nfermions in the low-energy regime. In this work, we introduce a new emergent\ngravity model by considering Dirac fermions invariant under local de Sitter\ntransformations in four-dimensional open manifolds. In the context of Cartan\ngeometry, fermions couple to spacetime through a $Spin(5)$ Cartan connection\nthat can be decomposed in spin connection and tetrads. In presence of a\ngravitational instanton background, we show that the corresponding effective\ntopological field theory becomes a dynamical gravitational theory with a\npositive cosmological constant and Barbero-Immirzi parameter. At classical\nlevel and in absence of matter, this theory is compatible with general\nrelativity.\n", "  Entanglement purification allows the creation of qubit pairs of arbitrarily\nhigh fidelity with respect to a maximally entangled state, starting from a\nlarger number of low-fidelity pairs. Purification requires quantum memory, a\nrole for which electron spins are well suited. However, using existing\nrecurrence protocols involving symmetric local two-qubit operations for spin\nqubits turns out to be rather unpractical. We present an efficient purification\nprotocol requiring only a single pulsed Heisenberg- or XY-type exchange\ninteraction between two qubit pairs. In contrast to known protocols, we allow\nfor asymmetric bilateral two-qubit operations where the two communication\nparties operate differently on their qubits. In the optimal version of our\nprotocol, the local two-qubit interactions in the case of Heisenberg exchange\ncorrespond to the $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate and its inverse.\n", "  We consider a harmonic chain perturbed by an energy conserving noise and show\nthat after a space-time rescaling the energy-energy correlation function is\ngiven by the solution of a skew-fractional heat equation with exponent 3/4.\n", "  We revisit the medium-induced coherent radiation associated to hard and\nforward (small angle) scattering of an energetic parton through a nuclear\nmedium. We consider all $1\\to 1$ hard forward processes ($g \\to g$, $q \\to q$,\n$q \\to g$ and $g \\to q$), and derive the energy spectrum of induced coherent\nradiation rigorously to all orders in the opacity expansion and for the\nspecific case of a Coulomb scattering potential. We obtain a simple general\nformula for the induced coherent spectrum, which encompasses the results\ncorresponding to previously known special cases.\n", "  In this paper, we study the future causally geodesically complete solutions\nof the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system. Under the a priori\nassumption that the scalar field $\\phi$ scatters locally in the scale-invariant\nbounded-variation (BV) norm, we prove that $\\phi$ and its derivatives decay\npolynomially. Moreover, we show that the decay rates are sharp. In particular,\nwe obtain sharp quantitative decay for the class of global solutions with small\nBV norms constructed by Christodoulou. As a consequence of our results, for\nevery future causally geodesically complete solution with sufficiently regular\ninitial data, we show the dichotomy that either the sharp power law tail holds\nor that the spacetime blows up at infinity in the sense that some scale\ninvariant spacetime norms blow up.\n", "  We consider chiral liquids, that is liquids consisting of massless fermions\nand right-left asymmetric. In such media, one expects existence of\nelectromagnetic current flowing along an external magnetic field, associated\nwith the chiral anomaly. The current is predicted to be dissipation-free. We\nconsider dynamics of chiral liquids, concentrating on the issues of possible\ninstabilities and infrared sensitivity. Instabilities arise, generally\nspeaking, already in the limit of vanishing electromagnetic constant,\n$\\alpha_{el}\\to 0$. In particular, liquids with non-vanishing chiral chemical\npotential might decay into right-left asymmetric states containing vortices.\n", "  Constructing renormalizable models on non-commutative spaces constitutes a\nbig challenge. Only few examples of renormalizable theories are known, such as\nthe scalar Grosse-Wulkenhaar model. Gauge fields are even more difficult, since\nnew renormalization techniques are required which are compatible with the\ninherently non-local setting on the one hand, and also allow to properly treat\nthe gauge symmetry on the other hand. In this proceeding (which is based on my\ntalk given at the ``Workshop on Noncommutative Field Theory and Gravity'' in\nCorfu/Greece, September 8 -- 15, 2013), I focus on this last point and present\nnew extensions to existing renormalization schemes (which are known to work for\ngauge field theories in commutative space) adapted to non-commutative Moyal\nspace.\n", "  A quantum system can behave as a wave or as a particle, depending on the\nexperimental arrangement. When for example measuring a photon using a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second\nbeam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted.\nThe decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after\nthe photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler's famous\ndelayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this\nexperiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam\nsplitter is itself still a classical object. Here we propose and realize a\nvariant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment. We configure a\nsuperconducting quantum circuit as a Ramsey interferometer, where the element\nthat acts as the first beam-splitter can be put in a quantum superposition of\nits active and inactive states, as verified by the negative values of its\nWigner function. We show that this enables the wave and particle aspects of the\nsystem to be observed with a single setup, without involving an ancilla that is\nnot itself a part of the interferometer. We also study the transition of this\nquantum beam-splitter from a quantum to a classical object due to decoherence,\nas observed by monitoring the interferometer output.\n", "  We present a general scheme for synthesizing a spatially periodic magnetic\nfield, or a magnetic lattice (ML), for ultracold atoms using pulsed gradient\nmagnetic fields. Both the period and the depth of the artificial ML can be\ntuned, immune to atomic spontaneous emission often encountered in optical\nlattices. The effective Hamiltonian for our 2-dimensional ML has not been\ndiscussed previously in condensed matter physics. Its band structures show\ninteresting features which can support topologically nontrivial phases. The\ntechnical requirements for implementing our protocol are readily available in\ntoday's cold atom experiments. Realization of our proposal will significantly\nexpand the repertoire for quantum simulation with ultracold atoms.\n", "  The recent phase sensitive measurements in the superconducting $B$-phase of\nUPt$_3$ provide strong evidence for the triplet, chiral $k_z(k_x \\pm ik_y)^2$\npairing symmetries, which endow the Cooper pairs with orbital angular momentum\nprojections $L _z= \\pm 2$ along the $c$-axis. In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface. At the transition from the $B$-phase to\nthe $A$-phase, the time reversal symmetry is restored, and only the line node\nsurvives inside the $A$-phase. As both line and double-Weyl point nodes possess\nlinearly vanishing density of states, we show that weak disorder acts as a\nmarginally relevant perturbation. Consequently, an infinitesimal amount of\ndisorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole, while giving rise to a\ndiffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy. The\nresulting diffusive phase exhibits $T$-linear specific heat, and an anomalous\nthermal Hall effect. We predict that the low temperature thermodynamic and\ntransport properties display a crossover between a ballistic thermal Hall\nsemimetal and a diffusive thermal Hall metal.\n", "  We study ground-state properties of a two-site, two-electron Holstein model\ndescribing two molecules coupled indirectly via electron-phonon interaction by\nusing both exact diagonalization and self-consistent diagrammatic many-body\nperturbation theory. The Hartree and self-consistent Born approximations used\nin the present work are studied at different levels of self-consistency. The\ngoverning equations are shown to exhibit multiple solutions when the\nelectron-phonon interaction is sufficiently strong whereas at smaller\ninteractions only a single solution is found. The additional solutions at\nlarger electron-phonon couplings correspond to symmetry-broken states with\ninhomogeneous electron densities. A comparison to exact results indicates that\nthis symmetry breaking is strongly correlated with the formation of a bipolaron\nstate in which the two electrons prefer to reside on the same molecule. The\nresults further show that the Hartree and partially self-consistent Born\nsolutions obtained by enforcing symmetry do not compare well with exact\nenergetics, while the fully self-consistent Born approximation improves the\nqualitative and quantitative agreement with exact results in the same symmetric\ncase. This together with a presented natural occupation number analysis\nsupports the conclusion that the fully self-consistent approximation describes\npartially the bipolaron crossover. These results contribute to better\nunderstanding how these approximations cope with the strong localizing effect\nof the electron-phonon interaction.\n", "  We have investigated the pressure-induced spin-state transition in Co$^{2+}$\nsystems in terms of a competition between the Hund's exchange energy ($J$) and\nthe crystal-field splitting ($\\Delta_{CF}$). First, we show the universal\nmetastability of the low-spin state in octahedrally coordinated Co$^{2+}$\nsystems. Then we present the strategy to search for a Co$^{2+}$ system, for\nwhich the mechanism of spin-state and metal-insulator transitions is governed\nnot by the Mott physics but by $J$ vs. $\\Delta_{CF}$ physics. Using CoCl$_{2}$\nas a prototypical Co$^{2+}$ system, we have demonstrated the pressure-induced\nspin-state transition from high-spin to low-spin, which is accompanied with\ninsulator-to-metal and antiferromagnetic to half-metallic ferromagnetic\ntransitions. Combined with metastable character of Co$^{2+}$ and the high\ncompressibility nature of CoCl$_{2}$, the transition pressure as low as 27 GPa\ncan be identified on the basis of $J$ vs. $\\Delta_{CF}$ physics.\n", "  In this pedagogical mini course the basics of the derivation of the\nnoncommutative structures appearing in string theory are reviewed. First we\ndiscuss the well established appearance of the noncommutative Moyal-Weyl\nstar-product in the correlation functions of open string vertex operators on a\nmagnetized D-brane. Second, we will review the most recent attempts to\ngeneralize these concepts to the closed string moving in a nongeometric flux\nbackground.\n", "  Semiconductor microcavity systems strongly coupled to quantum wells are now\nreceiving a great deal of attention because of their ability to efficiently\ngenerate coherent light by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of an\nexciton-polariton gas. Since the exciton polaritons are composite quasi-bosonic\nparticles, many fundamental features arise from their original constituents,\ni.e., electrons, holes and photons. As a result, not only equilibrium phases\ntypified by the BEC but also nonequilibrium lasing phases can be achieved. In\nthis contribution, we describe a framework which can treat such equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium phases in a unified way.\n", "  Experimental determination of entanglement is important not only to\ncharacterize the state and use it in quantum information, but also in\nunderstanding complicated phenomena such as phase transitions. In this paper we\nshow that in many cases, it is possible to determine entanglement of a two\nqubit state, as represented by concurrence, with a few observables, most of\nwhich are local. In particular, rank 1 and rank 2 states need exclusively\nmeasurement of local observables while rank 3 states need measurement of just\none correlation observable in addition to local observables. Only the rank 4\nstates are shown to require a more detailed tomography. The analysis also sheds\nlight on the other measure, non separability since it is a lower bound on\nconcurrence.\n", "  In the noncommutative geometry approach to the standard model, an extra\nscalar field - initially suggested by particle physicist to stabilize the\nelectroweak vacuum - makes the computation of the Higgs mass compatible with\nthe 126 GeV experimental value. We give a brief account on how to generate this\nfield from the Majorana mass of the neutrino, following the principles of\nnoncommutative geometry.\n", "  Most real networks are characterized by connectivity patterns that evolve in\ntime following complex, non-Markovian, dynamics. Here we investigate the impact\nof this ubiquitous feature by studying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\nand Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity driven\nnetworks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and non-Markovian). We show\nthat while memory inhibits the spreading process in SIR models, where the\nepidemic threshold is moved to larger values, it plays the opposite effect in\nthe case of the SIS, where the threshold is lowered. The heterogeneity in tie\nstrengths, and the frequent repetition of connections that it entails, allows\nin fact less virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local\nclusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture by\nevaluating the threshold of both processes in a real temporal network. Our\nfindings confirm the important role played by non-Markovian network dynamics on\ndynamical processes\n", "  We determine the shear viscosity of a hot and dense Yukawa-Fermi gas, using\nthe standard Green-Kubo relation, according to which the shear viscosity is\ngiven by the retarded correlator of the traceless part of viscous\nenergy-momentum tensor. We approximate this retarded correlator using a\none-loop skeleton expansion, and express the bosonic and fermionic shear\nviscosities, $\\eta_{b}$ and $\\eta_{f}$, in terms of bosonic and fermionic\nspectral widths, $\\Gamma_{b}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\pm}$. Here, the subscripts $\\pm$\ncorrespond to normal and collective (plasmino) excitations of fermions. We\nstudy, in particular, the effect of these excitations on thermal properties of\n$\\eta_{f}[\\Gamma_{\\pm}]$. To do this, we determine first the dependence of\n$\\Gamma_{b}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\pm}$ on momentum $p$, temperature $T$, chemical\npotential $\\mu$ and $\\xi_{0}\\equiv m_{b}^{0}/m_{f}^{0}$, in a one-loop\nperturbative expansion in the orders of the Yukawa coupling. Here, $m_{b}^{0}$\nand $m_{f}^{0}$ are $T$ and $\\mu$ independent bosonic and fermionic masses,\nrespectively. We then numerically determine $\\eta_{b}[\\Gamma_{b}]$ and\n$\\eta_{f}[\\Gamma_{\\pm}]$, and study their thermal properties. It turns out that\nwhereas $\\Gamma_{b}$ and $\\Gamma_{+}$ decrease with increasing $T$ or $\\mu$,\n$\\Gamma_{-}$ increases with increasing $T$ or $\\mu$. This behavior\nqualitatively changes by adding thermal corrections to $m_{b}^{0}$ and\n$m_{f}^{0}$, while the difference between $\\Gamma_{+}$ and $\\Gamma_{-}$ keeps\nincreasing with increasing $T$ or $\\mu$. Moreover, $\\eta_{b}$ ($\\eta_{f}$)\nincreases (decreases) with increasing $T$ or $\\mu$. We show that the effect of\nplasminos on $\\eta_{f}$ becomes negligible with increasing (decreasing) $T$\n($\\mu$).\n", "  We construct the elliptic Painlev\\'e equation and its higher dimensional\nanalogs as the action of line bundles on 1-dimensional sheaves on\nnoncommutative surfaces.\n", "  In this paper three notions of emergent geometry arising from the study of\ngauge/gravity duals are discussed. The unifying theme behind these notions of\nemergent geometry is that one can derive properties of the effective action of\na probe or excitation around some configuration in gauge theory which can be\nargued to be localized at a particular position in the gravity dual, and match\nthis description to various degrees of accuracy in the gravity dual. The three\nexamples discussed are giant gravitons in $AdS_5\\times S^5$, open strings\nstretching between these giants and the probe dynamics of a D0 brane in the\npresence of a thermal matrix configuration of the BFSS matrix model.\n", "  We study the fine structure of long-time quantum noise in correlation\nfunctions of AdS/CFT systems. Under standard assumptions of quantum chaos for\nthe dynamics and the observables, we estimate the size of exponentially small\noscillations and trace them back to geometrical features of the bulk system.\nThe noise level is highly suppressed by the amount of dynamical chaos and the\namount of quantum impurity in the states. This implies that, despite their\nmissing on the details of Poincare recurrences, `virtual' thermal AdS phases do\ncontrol the overall noise amplitude even at high temperatures where the thermal\nensemble is dominated by large AdS black holes. We also study EPR correlations\nand find that, in contrast to the behavior of large correlation peaks, their\nnoise level is the same in TFD states and in more general highly entangled\nstates.\n", "  We describe quasi-Hopf twist deformations of flat closed string\ncompactifications with non-geometric R-flux using a suitable cochain twist, and\nconstruct nonassociative deformations of fields and differential calculus. We\nreport on our new findings in using this formalism to construct perturbative\nnonassociative field theories on these backgrounds. We describe the\nmodifications to the usual classification of Feynman diagrams into planar and\nnon-planar graphs. The example of phi(4) theory is studied in detail and the\none-loop contributions to the two-point function are calculated.\n", "  We review and explain the relation between U-dual branes in string theory and\nmixed symmetry tensors of various degrees. In certain cases these mixed\nsymmetry tensors can be related to diverse types of fluxes that play an\nimportant role in compactifications of string theory.\n", "  Matrix models are a promising candidate for a nonperturbative formulation of\nthe superstring theory. It is possible to study how the standard model and\nother phenomenological models appear from the matrix model, and estimate the\nprobability distribution of their appearance. This article mainly addresses\nstudies in toroidal compactifications with magnetic fluxes.\n", "  The electron spin is a promising qubit candidate for quantum computation and\nquantum information. Here we propose and analyze a mechanically-induced single\nelectron spin resonance, which amounts to a rotation of the spin about the\n$x$-axis in a suspended carbon nanotube. The effect is based on the coupling\nbetween the spin and the mechanical degree of freedom due to the intrinsic\ncurvature-induced spin-orbit coupling. A rotation about the $z$-axis is\nobtained by the off-resonant external electric driving field. Arbitrary-angle\nrotations of the single electron spin about any axis in the $x$-$z$ plane can\nbe obtained with a single operation by varying the frequency and the strength\nof the external electric driving field. With multiple steps combining the\nrotations about the $x$- and $z$-axes, arbitrary-angle rotations about\narbitrary axes can be constructed, which implies that any single-qubit gate of\nthe electron spin qubit can be performed. We simulate the system numerically\nusing a master equation with realistic parameters.\n", "  We review briefly the motivations for introducing additional group-theoretic\ndata in tensor models, leading to the richer framework of group field theories,\nthemselves a field theory formulation of loop quantum gravity. We discuss how\nthese data give to the GFT amplitudes the structure of lattice gauge theories\nand simplicial gravity path integrals, and make their quantum geometry\nmanifest. We focus in particular on the non-commutative flux/algebra\nrepresentation of these models.\n", "  We elaborate on the predictions of the imaginary Starobinsky model of\ninflation coupled to matter, where the inflaton is identified with the\nimaginary part of the inflaton multiplet suggested by the Supergravity\nembedding of a pure R + R^2 gravity. In particular, we study the impact of\nhigher-order curvature terms and show that, depending on the parameter range,\none may find either a quadratic model of chaotic inflation or monomial models\nof chaotic inflation with fractional powers between 1 and 2.\n", "  The characterization of the DBI action of a Dp-brane using the generalized\ngeometry is discussed. It is shown that the DBI action is invariant under the\ndiffeomorphism and B-transformation of the generalized tangent bundle of the\ntarget space. The symmetry is realized non-linearly on the fluctuation of the\nD-brane.\n", "  We review recent developments in the type IIB matrix model, which was\nconjectured to be a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. In the\nfirst part we review the recent results for the Euclidean model, which suggest\nthat SO(10) symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the second part we review the\nrecent results for the Lorentzian model. In particular, we discuss Monte Carlo\nresults, which suggest that (3+1)-dimensional expanding universe emerges\ndynamically. We also discuss some results suggesting the emergence of\nexponential expansion and the power-law expansion at later times. The behaviors\nat much later times are studied by the classical equation of motion. We discuss\na solution representing 3d expanding space, which suggests a possible solution\nto the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  In this paper, we investigated quantum correlation in SU (2) invariant\nquantum spin systems by local quantum uncertainty(LQU). These states are\ninvariant under global rotations of both subsystems and in real physical\nsystems, such states arise from thermal equilibrium states of isotropic spin\nsystems. We derive an analytic expression for the LQU of (2j +1)*2 and (2j\n+1)*3 quantum spin systems with SU (2) symmetry.\n", "  Using transport measurements, we investigate multicomponent quantum Hall (QH)\nferromagnetism in dual-gated rhombohedral trilayer graphene (r-TLG), in which\nthe real spin, orbital pseudospin and layer pseudospins of the lowest Landau\nlevel form spontaneous ordering. We observe intermediate quantum Hall plateaus,\nindicating a complete lifting of the degeneracy of the zeroth Landau level (LL)\nin the hole-doped regime. In charge neutral r-TLG, the orbital degeneracy is\nbroken first, and the layer degeneracy is broken last and only the in presence\nof an interlayer potential U. In the phase space of U and filling factor, we\nobserve an intriguing hexagon pattern, which is accounted for by a model based\non crossings between symmetry-broken LLs.\n", "  In this work we present the architecture and results of a fully digital Front\nEnd Electronics (FEE) read out system developed for the GALILEO array. The FEE\nsystem, developed in collaboration with the Advanced Gamma Tracking Array\n(AGATA) collaboration, is composed of three main blocks: preamplifiers,\ndigitizers and preprocessing electronics. The slow control system contains a\ncustom Linux driver, a dynamic library and a server implementing network\nservices. The digital processing of the data from the GALILEO germanium\ndetectors has demonstrated the capability to achieve an energy resolution of\n1.53 per mil at an energy of 1.33 MeV.\n", "  Modern Tokamaks have evolved from the initial axisymmetric circular plasma\nshape to an elongated axisymmetric plasma shape that improves the energy\nconfinement time and the triple product, which is a generally used figure of\nmerit for the conditions needed for fusion reactor performance. However, the\nelongated plasma cross section introduces a vertical instability that demands a\nreal-time feedback control loop to stabilize the plasma vertical position and\nvelocity. At the Tokamak \\`a Configuration Variable (TCV) in-vessel poloidal\nfield coils driven by fast switching power supplies are used to stabilize\nhighly elongated plasmas. TCV plasma experiments have used a PID algorithm\nbased controller to correct the plasma vertical position. In late 2013\nexperiments a new optimal real-time controller was tested improving the\nstability of the plasma.\n  This contribution describes the new optimal real-time controller developed.\nThe choice of the model that describes the plasma response to the actuators is\ndiscussed. The high order model that is initially implemented demands the\napplication of a mathematical order reduction and the validation of the new\nreduced model. The lower order model is used to derive the time optimal control\nlaw. A new method for the construction of the switching curves of a bang-bang\ncontroller is presented that is based on the state-space trajectories that\noptimize the time to target of the system.\n  A closed loop controller simulation tool was developed to test different\npossible algorithms and the results were used to improve the controller\nparameters.\n  The final control algorithm and its implementation are described and\npreliminary experimental results are discussed.\n", "  (Abridged) We propose a new method to estimate the Bondi (hot gas) accretion\nrates, \\dot M_B, onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of\nelliptical galaxies. It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not\nwell-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple\nassumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic\nequilibrium, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the\nvirial temperature. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in\nnearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs).\nWe find a correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets\nassociated with the SMBHs over four orders of magnitude in \\dot M_B. For most\ngalaxies, the accretion rates are large enough to account for the jet powers.\nOur results indicate that the feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN)\ncorrelates with the properties of the hot gas surrounding the SMBHs. We also\nfind that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates.\nThis may explain the hyper masses (~ 10^10 M_sun) of some of the SMBHs.\nComparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN\nsuggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient\ncompared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way, even when their Eddington\naccretion ratio, \\dot M_B/\\dot M_Edd, exceeds 0.01. Lastly, we find a tight\ncorrelation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of\ncool cores. Their relation is linear and the power generated by the Bondi\naccretion is large enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool\ncores. Although the `classical' Bondi accretion model is a greatly\noversimplified one, the correlations we find here demonstrate that the\naccretion onto the SMBHs reflects broadly the properties of the Bondi\naccretion.\n", "  We demonstrate the measurement and manipulation of the temperature of cold CO\nmolecules in a microchip environment. Through the use of time-resolved spatial\nimaging, we are able to observe the phase-space distribution of the molecules,\nand hence deduce the corresponding temperature. We do this both by observing\nthe expansion of the molecular ensemble in time and through the use of\nnumerical trajectory simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the adiabatic\ncooling of the trapped molecular sample and discuss this process.\n", "  We describe measurements of the motional sidebands produced by a mechanical\noscillator (with effective mass 43 ng and resonant frequency 705 kHz) that is\nplaced in an optical cavity and cooled close to its quantum ground state. The\nred and blue sidebands (corresponding to Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering)\nfrom a single laser beam are recorded simultaneously via a heterodyne\nmeasurement. The oscillator's mean phonon number n is inferred from the ratio\nof the sidebands, and reaches a minimum value of 0.84 +- 0.22 (corresponding to\na mode temperature T = 28 +- 7 microK). We also infer n from the calibrated\narea of each of the two sidebands, and from the oscillator's total damping. The\nvalues of n inferred from these four methods are in close agreement. The\nbehavior of the sidebands as a function of the oscillator's temperature agrees\nwell with theory that includes the quantum fluctuations of both the cavity\nfield and the mechanical oscillator.\n", "  The Fe(1+x)Sb compound has been synthesized close to stoichiometry with x =\n0.023(8). The compound was investigated by 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy in the\ntemperature range 4.2 - 300 K. The antiferromagnetic ordering temperature was\nfound as 232 K i.e. much higher than for the less stoichiometric material.\nRegular iron was found to occupy two different positions in proportion 2:1.\nThey differ by the electric quadrupole coupling constants and both of them\nexhibit extremely anisotropic electric field gradient tensor (EFG) with the\nasymmetry parameter equal one. The negative component of both EFGs is aligned\nwith the c-axis of the hexagonal unit cell, while the positive component is\naligned with the <120> direction. Hence, a model describing deviation from the\nNiAs P63/mmc symmetry group within Fe-planes has been proposed. Spectra in the\nmagnetically ordered state could be explained by introduction of the\nincommensurate spin spirals propagating through the iron atoms in the direction\nof the c-axis with a complex pattern of the hyperfine magnetic fields\ndistributed within a-b plane. Hyperfine magnetic field pattern of spirals due\nto major regular iron is smoothed by the spin polarized itinerant electrons,\nwhile the minor regular iron exhibits hyperfine field pattern characteristic of\nthe highly covalent bonds to the adjacent antimony atoms. The excess\ninterstitial iron orders magnetically at the same temperature as the regular\niron, and magnetic moments of these atoms are likely to form two-dimensional\nspin glass with moments lying in the a-b plane. The upturn of the hyperfine\nfield for minor regular iron and interstitial iron is observed below 80 K.\nMagneto-elastic effects are smaller than for FeAs, however the recoilless\nfraction increases significantly upon transition to the magnetically ordered\nstate.\n", "  The tensor track is a background-independent discretization of quantum\ngravity which includes a sum over all topologies. We discuss how to define a\nfunctional renormalization group flow and the Wetterich equation in the\ncorresponding theory space. This space is different from the Einsteinian theory\nspace of asymptotic safety. It includes all fixed-rank tensor-invariant\ninteractions, hence generalizes matrix models and the (Moyal) non-commutative\nfield theory space.\n", "  A detailed study of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima model and its extensions is\npresented. These simple nonlinear partial differential equations suggested for\nboth Rossby waves in the atmosphere and also drift waves in a\nmagnetically-confined plasma exhibit some remarkable and nontrivial properties,\nwhich in their qualitative form survive in more realistic and complicated\nmodels, and as such form a conceptual basis for understanding the turbulence\nand zonal flow dynamics in real plasma and geophysical systems. Two idealised\nscenarios of generation of zonal flows by small-scale turbulence are explored:\na modulational instability and turbulent cascades.\n  A detailed study of the generation of zonal flows by the modulational\ninstability reveals that the dynamics of this zonal flow generation mechanism\ndiffer widely depending on the initial degree of nonlinearity. A numerical\nproof is provided for the extra invariant in Rossby and drift wave turbulence\n-zonostrophy and the invariant cascades are shown to be characterised by the\nzonostrophy pushing the energy to the zonal scales.\n  A small scale instability forcing applied to the model demonstrates the\nwell-known drift wave - zonal flow feedback loop in which the turbulence which\ninitially leads to the zonal flow creation, is completely suppressed and the\nzonal flows saturate. The turbulence spectrum is shown to diffuse in a manner\nwhich has been mathematically predicted.\n  The insights gained from this simple model could provide a basis for\nequivalent studies in more sophisticated plasma and geophysical fluid dynamics\nmodels in an effort to fully understand the zonal flow generation, the\nturbulent transport suppression and the zonal flow saturation processes in both\nthe plasma and geophysical contexts as well as other wave and turbulence\nsystems where order evolves from chaos.\n", "  The paper offers physical bases of earth EM emission in the earthquake\npreparation period.\n", "  The strongest version of the gauge/gravity duality conjecture relates the 1/N\ncorrection in super Yang-Mills theory and the quantum correction in superstring\ntheory. We perform a quantitative test of this conjecture at finite\ntemperature, by studying the D0-brane matrix quantum mechanics and the black\nzero-brane in type IIA superstring theory. We find good agreement, which\nstrongly suggests that the super Yang-Mills theory does provide us with a\nnonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity through the gauge/gravity\nduality.\n", "  In this paper we address the general problem of including inflationary models\nexhibiting Starobinsky-like potentials into (symmetric) $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupergravities. This is done by gauging suitable abelian isometries of the\nhypermultiplet sector and then truncating the resulting theory to a single\nscalar field. By using the characteristic properties of the global symmetry\ngroups of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities we are able to make a general\nstatement on the possible $\\alpha$-attractor models which can obtained upon\ntruncation. We find that in symmetric $\\mathcal{N}=2$ models group theoretical\nconstraints restrict the allowed values of the parameter $\\alpha$ to be\n$\\alpha=1,\\,\\frac{2}{3},\\, \\frac{1}{3}$. This confirms and generalizes results\nrecently obtained in the literature. Our analysis heavily relies on the\nmathematical structure of symmetric $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities, in\nparticular on the so called $c$-map connection between Quaternionic K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds starting from Special K\\\"ahler ones. A general statement on the\npossible consistent truncations of the gauged models, leading to\nStarobinsky-like potentials, requires the essential help of Tits Satake\nuniversality classes. The paper is mathematically self-contained and aims at\npresenting the involved mathematical structures to a public not only of\nphysicists but also of mathematicians. To this end the main mathematical\nstructures and the general gauging procedure of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities\nis reviewed in some detail.\n", "  In the presence of an active medium incorporated in a Penning trap, the\nmoving electrons can become bunched, as they get enough energy, they escape the\ntrap forming an optical injector. These bunched electrons can enter next PASER\nsection filled with the same active medium to be accelerated. In this paper,\nelectron dynamics in the presence of gas mixture active medium incorporated in\na penning trap is analyzed by developing an idealized 1D model. We further\nevaluate the energy exchange occurring as the train of electrons traversing the\nnext PASER section. The results show that the oscillating electrons can be\nbunched at the resonant frequency of the active medium. The influence of the\ntrapped time and the population inversion are analyzed, which shows that the\nlonger the electrons are trapped, the more energy from the medium the\naccelerated electrons get, and with the increase of the population inversion,\nthe decelerated electrons virtually unchanged but the accelerated electrons\nmore than double their peak energy values. What is more, the simulation results\nshow that the gas active medium need lower population inversion to bunch the\nelectrons compared to the solid active medium. So the experimental condition is\neasy to be achieved.\n", "  We study, within QCD collinear factorization and including BFKL resummation\nat the next-to-leading order, the production of Mueller-Navelet jets at LHC\nwith center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The adopted jet vertices are calculated in\nthe approximation of small aperture of the jet cone in the\npseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane. We consider several representations of\nthe dijet cross section, differing only beyond the next-to-leading order, to\ncalculate a few observables related with this process. We use various methods\nof optimization to fix the energy scales entering the perturbative calculation\nand compare thereafter our results with the experimental data from the CMS\ncollaboration.\n", "  Many biological phenomena such as locomotion, circadian cycles, and breathing\nare rhythmic in nature and can be modeled as rhythmic dynamical systems.\nDynamical systems modeling often involves neglecting certain characteristics of\na physical system as a modeling convenience. For example, human locomotion is\nfrequently treated as symmetric about the sagittal plane. In this work, we test\nthis assumption by examining human walking dynamics around the steady-state\n(limit-cycle). Here we adapt statistical cross validation in order to examine\nwhether there are statistically significant asymmetries, and even if so, test\nthe consequences of assuming bilateral symmetry anyway. Indeed, we identify\nsignificant asymmetries in the dynamics of human walking, but nevertheless show\nthat ignoring these asymmetries results in a more consistent and predictive\nmodel. In general, neglecting evident characteristics of a system can be more\nthan a modeling convenience---it can produce a better model.\n", "  We clarify relations between the higher dimensional quantum Hall effect and\nA-class topological insulator. In particular, we elucidate physical\nimplications of the higher dimensional non-commutative geometry in the context\nof A-class topological insulator. This presentation is based on\narXiv:1403.5066.\n", "  Computing the renormalized masses and S-matrix elements in string theory,\ninvolving states whose masses are not protected from quantum corrections,\nrequires defining off-shell amplitude with certain factorization properties.\nWhile in the bosonic string theory one can in principle construct such an\namplitude from string field theory, there is no fully consistent field theory\nfor type II and heterotic string theory. In this paper we give a practical\nconstruction of off-shell amplitudes satisfying the desired factorization\nproperty using the formalism of picture changing operators. We describe a\nsystematic procedure for dealing with the spurious singularities of the\nintegration measure that we encounter in superstring perturbation theory. This\nprocedure is also useful for computing on-shell amplitudes, as we demonstrate\nby computing the effect of Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms in four dimensional\nheterotic string theory compactifications using this formalism.\n", "  In a recent work by Cuetara et al. (Phys. Rev. E 89, 052119 (2014)), the\nauthors claimed that if a system is prepared under suitable initial conditions,\nthen the total entropy production (EP) for the system and reservoirs can be\nexpressed in terms of physically measurable quantities. However, the backward\nprotocol used in their work is not time-reversed of the forward protocol so\nthat the quantity obtained from the ratio of the forward and backward path\nprobabilities is neither the total EP nor any measurable quantity. We propose a\nsuitable setup which satisfies their pursuit. We also provide a theoretical\nbackground as to what quantity satisfies the fluctuation theorem depending on\nthe intial conditions chosen for the forward and backward processes.\n", "  In \\cite{Os} a general spectral approximation theory was developed for\ncompact operators on a Banach space which does not require that the operators\nbe self-adjoint and also provides a first order correction term. Here we extend\nsome of the results of that paper to nonlinear eigenvalue problems. We present\nexamples of its application that arise in electromagnetics.\n", "  A Maple code is presented for algebraic collective model (ACM) calculations.\nThe ACM is an algebraic version of the Bohr model of the atomic nucleus, in\nwhich all required matrix elements are derived by exploiting the model's\nSU(1,1) x SO(5) dynamical group. This paper reviews the mathematical\nformulation of the ACM, and serves as a manual for the code.\n  The code enables a wide range of model Hamiltonians to be analysed. This\nrange includes essentially all Hamiltonians that are rational functions of the\nmodel's quadrupole moments $q_M$ and are at most quadratic in the corresponding\nconjugate momenta $\\pi_N$ ($-2\\le M,N\\le 2$). The code makes use of expressions\nfor matrix elements derived elsewhere and newly derived matrix elements of the\noperators $[\\pi\\otimes q \\otimes\\pi]_0$ and $[\\pi\\otimes\\pi]_{LM}$. The code is\nmade efficient by use of an analytical expression for the needed SO(5)-reduced\nmatrix elements, and use of SO(5)$\\,\\supset\\,$SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients\nobtained from precomputed data files provided with the code.\n", "  We extend our recently developed inversion method to extract excited state\npotentials from fluorescence line positions and line strengths. We consider a\nprevious limitation of the method arising due to insufficient input data in\ncases where the relatively weaker emission data are not experimentally\navailable. We develop a solution to this problem by \"regenerating\" these weak\ntransition lines via applying a model potential, e.g. a Morse potential. The\nresult of this procedure, illustrated for the Q-branch emission from the lowest\nthree vibrational levels of the B($^1 \\Pi)$ state of LiRb, is shown to have an\nerror of $0.29$ cm$^{-1}$ in the classically allowed region and a global error\nof $5.67$ cm$^{-1}$ for $V\\le E(\\nu'=10)$. The robustness of this procedure is\nalso demonstrated by considering the statistical error in the measured line\nintensities.\n", "  The effect of anomalous magnetic moment of quarks on thermodynamic properties\nof the chiral condensate is studied, using of a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio\nmodel at finite temperature $T$, chemical potential $\\mu$, and in the presence\nof a uniform magnetic field $eB$. To this purpose, the Schwinger linear-in-$B$\nansatz for the quark anomalous magnetic moment in term of the nonperturbative\nBohr magneton is considered. In a two-dimensional flavor space, it leads to the\ncorrection $\\hat{T}_{Sch}=\\hat{\\kappa}\\hat{Q} eB$ in the energy dispersion\nrelation of quarks. Here, $\\hat{Q}$ is the quark charge matrix. We consider\nthree different sets for $\\hat{\\kappa}$, and numerically determine the\ndependence of the constituent quark mass on $T,\\mu$ and $eB$ for fixed\n$\\hat{\\kappa}$. By exploring the complete phase portrait of this model in\n$T$-$\\mu$, $\\mu$-$eB$, and $T$-$eB$ phase spaces for various fixed $eB$, $T$,\n$\\mu$ and $\\hat{\\kappa}$, we observe that inverse magnetic catalysis occurs for\nlarge enough $\\hat{\\kappa}$. Moreover, in the regime of weak magnetic fields,\nthe phenomenon of reentrance of chiral symmetry broken and restored phases\noccurs for $T, \\mu$ and $eB$ dependent $\\hat{\\kappa}$.\n", "  Benford's law is a statistical inference to predict the frequency of\nsignificant digits in naturally occurring numerical databases. In such\ndatabases this law predicts a higher occurrence of the digit 1 in the most\nsignificant place and decreasing occurrences to other larger digits. Although\ncounter-intuitive at first sight, Benford's law has seen applications in a wide\nvariety of fields like physics, earth-science, biology, finance etc. In this\nwork, we have explored the use of Benford's law for various spectroscopic\napplications. Although, we use NMR signals as our databases, the methods\ndescribed here may also be extended to other spectroscopic techniques. In\nparticular, with the help of Benford analysis, we demonstrate the detection of\nweak NMR signals and spectral corrections. We also explore a potential\napplication of Benford analysis in the image-processing of MRI data.\n", "  We show the dielectrophoretic actuation of single-crystal diamond\nnanomechanical devices. Gradient radio-frequency electromagnetic forces are\nused to achieve actuation of both cantilever and doubly clamped beam\nstructures, with operation frequencies ranging from a few MHz to ~50MHz.\nFrequency tuning and parametric actuation are also studied.\n", "  We present a protocol based on continuous-variable quantum teleportation and\nGaussian post- selection that can be used to correct errors introduced by a\nlossy channel. We first show that the global transformation enacted by the\nprotocol is equivalent to an effective system composed of a noiseless\namplification (or attenuation), and an effective quantum channel, which can in\ntheory have no loss and an amount of thermal noise arbitrarily small, hence\ntending to an identity channel. An application of our protocol is the\nprobabilistic purification of quantum non-Gaussian states using only Gaussian\noperations.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the vacuum densities for a massive scalar field\nwith general curvature coupling in background of a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime\ncorresponding to a cylindrical tube with a hemispherical cap. A complete set of\nmode functions is constructed and the positive-frequency Wightman function is\nevaluated for both the cylindrical and hemispherical subspaces. On the base of\nthis, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and energy-momentum\ntensor are investigated. The mean field squared and the normal stress are\nfinite on the boundary separating two subspaces, whereas the energy density and\nthe parallel stress diverge as the inverse power of the distance from the\nboundary. For a conformally coupled field, the vacuum energy density is\nnegative on the cylindrical part of the space. On the hemisphere, it is\nnegative near the top and positive close to the boundary. In the case of\nminimal coupling the energy density on the cup is negative. On the tube it is\npositive near the boundary and negative at large distances. Though the\ngeometries of the subspaces are different, the Casimir pressures on the\nseparate sides of the boundary are equal and the net Casimir force vanishes.\nThe results obtained may be applied to capped carbon nanotubes described by an\neffective field theory in the long-wavelength approximation.\n", "  We theoretically study the interplay of spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions\nin dynamical nuclear polarization in two-electron semiconductor double quantum\ndots near the singlet $(S)$ - triplet $(T_+)$ anticrossing. The goal of the\nscheme under study is to extend the singlet $(S)$ - triplet $(T_0)$ qubit\ndecoherence time $T_2^{*}$ by dynamically transferring the polarization from\nthe electron spins to the nuclear spins. This polarization transfer is achieved\nby cycling the electron spins over the $S-T_+$ anticrossing. Here, we\ninvestigate, both quantitatively and qualitatively, how this hyperfine mediated\ndynamical polarization transfer is influenced by the Rashba and Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interaction. In addition to $T_2^*$, we determine the singlet return\nprobability $P_s$, a quantity that can be measured in experiments. Our results\nsuggest that the spin-orbit interaction establishes a mechanism that can\npolarize the nuclear spins in the opposite direction compared to hyperfine\nmediated nuclear spin polarization. In materials with relatively strong\nspin-orbit coupling, this interplay of spin-orbit and hyperfine mediated\nnuclear spin polarizations prevents any notable increase of the $S-T_0$ qubit\ndecoherence time $T_2^{*}$.\n", "  Cell migration is important in many biological processes, including embryonic\ndevelopment, cancer metastasis, and wound healing. In these tissues, a cell's\nmotion is often strongly constrained by its neighbors, leading to glassy\ndynamics. While self-propelled particle models exhibit a density-driven glass\ntransition, this does not explain liquid-to-solid transitions in confluent\ntissues, where there are no gaps between cells and therefore the density is\nconstant. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new type of rigidity\ntransition that occurs in the well-studied vertex model for confluent tissue\nmonolayers at constant density. We find the onset of rigidity is governed by a\nmodel parameter that encodes single-cell properties such as cell-cell adhesion\nand cortical tension, providing an explanation for a liquid-to-solid\ntransitions in confluent tissues and making testable predictions about how\nthese transitions differ from those in particulate matter.\n", "  Photo-induced magnetic force between nanostructures, at optical frequencies,\nis investigated theoretically. Till now optical magnetic effects are not used\nin scanning probe microscopy because of the vanishing natural magnetism with\nincreasing frequency. On the other hand, artificial magnetism in engineered\nnanostructures led to the development of measurable optical magnetism. Here,\ntwo examples of nanoprobes that are able to generate strong magnetic dipolar\nfields at optical frequency are investigated: first an ideal magnetically\npolarizable nanosphere and then a circular cluster of silver nanospheres that\nhas a loop-like collective plasmonic resonance equivalent to a magnetic dipole.\nMagnetic forces are evaluated based on nanostructure polarizabilities, i.e.\ninduced magnetic dipoles, and magnetic-near field evaluations. As an initial\nassessment on the possibility of a magnetic nanoprobe to detect magnetic\nforces, we consider two identical magnetically polarizable nanoprobes and\nobserve magnetic forces in the order of piconewtons thereby bringing it within\ndetection limits of conventional atomic force microscopes at ambient pressure\nand temperature. The detection of magnetic force is a promising method in\nstudying optical magnetic transitions that can be the basis of innovative\nspectroscopy applications.\n", "  We exhibit the intriguing phenomena of \"Less is More\" using a set of\nmultipartite entangled states. We consider the quantum communication protocols\nfor the {\\em exact} teleportation, superdense coding, and quantum key\ndistribution. We find that sometimes {\\em less} entanglement is {\\em more}\nuseful. To understand this phenomena we obtain a condition that a resource\nstate must satisfy to communicate a $n$-qubit pure state with $m$ terms. We\nfind that the an appropriate partition of the resource state should have a\nvon-Neumann entropy of ${\\rm log}_{2} m$. Furthermore, it is shown that some\nstates may be suitable for exact superdense coding, but not for exact\nteleportation.\n", "  We find a rather unique extension of inflationary scenario which avoids\nselfreproduction and thus resolves the problems of multiverse, predictability\nand initial conditions. In this theory the amplitude of the cosmological\nperturbations is expressed entirely in terms of the total duration of\ninflation.\n", "  We present second-order molecular cluster perturbation theory (MCPT(2)), a\nlinear scaling methodology to calculate arbitrarily large systems with explicit\ncalculation of individual wavefunctions in a coupled-cluster framework. This\nnew MCPT(2) framework uses coupled-cluster perturbation theory and an expansion\nin terms of molecular dimer interactions to obtain molecular wavefunctions that\nare infinite-order in both the electronic fluctuation operator and all possible\ndimer (and products of dimers) interactions. The MCPT(2) framework has been\nimplemented in the new SIA/Aces4 parallel architecture, making use of the\nadvanced dynamic memory control and fine grained parallelism to perform very\nlarge explicit molecular cluster calculations. To illustrate the power of this\nmethod, we have computed energy shifts, lattice site dipole moments, and\nharmonic vibrational frequencies via explicit calculation of the bulk system\nfor the polar and non-polar polymorphs of solid hydrogen fluoride. The explicit\nlattice size (without using any periodic boundary conditions) was expanded up\nto 1,000 HF molecules, with 32,000 basis functions and 10,000 electrons. Our\nobtained HF lattice site dipole moments and harmonic vibrational frequencies\nagree well with the existing literature.\n", "  We discuss unimodular gravity at a classical level, and in terms of its\nextension into the UV through an appropriate path integral representation.\nClassically, unimodular gravity is simply a gauge fixed version of General\nRelativity (GR), and as such it yields identical dynamics and physical\npredictions. We clarify this and explain why there is no sense in which it can\n\"bring a new perspective\" to the cosmological constant problem. The quantum\nequivalence between unimodular gravity and GR is more of a subtle question, but\nwe present an argument that suggests one can always maintain the equivalence up\nto arbitrarily high momenta. As a corollary to this, we argue that whenever\ninequivalence is seen at the quantum level, that just means we have defined two\ndifferent quantum theories that happen to share a classical limit.\n", "  The breaking of orbital degeneracy on a transition metal cation and the\nresulting unequal electronic occupations of these orbitals provide a powerful\nlever over electron density and spin ordering inmetal oxides. Here, we use ab\ninitio calculations to show that reversibly modulating the orbital populations\non Mn atoms can be achieved at ferroelectric/manganite interfaces by the\npresence of ferroelectric polarization on the nanoscale. The change in orbital\noccupation can be as large as 10%, greatly exceeding that of bulk manganites.\nThis reversible orbital splitting is in large part controlled by the\npropagation of ferroelectric polar displacements into the interfacial region, a\nstructural motif absent in the bulk and unique to the interface. We use\nepitaxial thin film growth and scanning transmission electron microscopy to\nverify this key interfacial polar distortion and discuss the potential of\nreversible control of orbital polarization via nanoscale ferroelectrics.\n", "  When dealing with the classical limit of two quantum mechanical oscillators\non a noncommutative configuration space, the limits corresponding to the\nremoval of configuration-space noncommutativity and position-momentum\nnoncommutativity do not commute. We address this behaviour from the point of\nview of the phase-space localisation properties of the Wigner functions of\ncoherent states under the two limits.\n", "  We experimentally study the energy-temperature relationship of a harmonically\ntrapped Bose-Einstein condensate by transferring a known quantity of energy to\nthe condensate and measuring the resulting temperature change. We consider two\nmethods of heat transfer, the first using a free expansion under gravity and\nthe second using an optical standing wave to diffract the atoms in the\npotential. We investigate the effect of interactions on the thermodynamics and\ncompare our results to various finite temperature theories.\n", "  We study the Sivers asymmetry in semi-inclusive hadron production in deep\ninelastic scattering. We concentrate on the contribution from the photon-gluon\nfusion channel at ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_{em}^2 \\alpha_s)$, where three-gluon\ncorrelation functions play a major role within the twist-3 collinear\nfactorization formalism. We establish the correspondence between such a\nformalism with three gluon correlation functions and the usual transverse\nmomentum dependent (TMD) factorization formalism at moderate hadron transverse\nmomenta. We derive the coefficient functions used in the usual TMD evolution\nformalism related to the quark Sivers function expansion in terms of the\nthree-gluon correlation functions. We further perform the next-to-leading order\ncalculation for the transverse-momentum-weighted spin-dependent differential\ncross section, and identify the off-diagonal contribution from the three-gluon\ncorrelation functions to the QCD collinear evolution of the twist-3 Qiu-Sterman\nfunction.\n", "  We have investigated non-equilibrium properties of proper uniaxial\nSn$_2$P$_2$(Se$_x$S$_{1-x}$)$_6$ ferroelectrics with the Type II incommensurate\nphase above Lifshitz point $x_{\\rm LP} \\sim 0.28$. We measured dielectric\nsusceptibility with cooling and heating rate ranging 0.002-0.1~K/min, and\nhigh-resolution ultrasound experiments and hypersound Brillouin scattering. For\nsamples with $x \\geqslant 0.28$ clear anomalies were observed at incommensurate\nsecond order transition ($T_i$) and at first order lock-in transition ($T_c$)\nin the regime of very slow cooling rate, whereas the intermediate IC phase is\nnot observed when the rate is faster then 0.1~K/min. In general, increasing the\ncooling rate leads to smearing the anomaly at $T_c$. We explain this effect in\nterms of Kibble-Zurek model for non-equilibrium second order phase transitions.\nIn the ferroelectrics with strongly nonlinear local potential cooling rate\ndefines concentration of domain walls and their size: domain width decreases\nwhen cooling rate increases. At certain conditions the size of domain is\ncomparable to the incommensurate phase modulation period, which lies in\nmicrometer scale in the vicinity of Lifshitz point and leads to pinning of the\nmodulation period by domain wall.\n", "  Electric-field noise near surfaces is a common problem in diverse areas of\nphysics, and a limiting factor for many precision measurements. There are\nmultiple mechanisms by which such noise is generated, many of which are poorly\nunderstood. Laser-cooled, trapped ions provide one of the most sensitive\nsystems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance\nrange 30 - 3000 $\\mu$m from the surface. Over recent years numerous experiments\nhave reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion\nheating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for\nthe observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an\nextensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in\nion traps, and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured\nmechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of\nmultiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical\nconsiderations, complicate the interpretation of these results. It is thus the\npurpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from\nthe existing data, and which important questions are still open. In so doing it\nprovides a framework for future investigations of surface-noise processes.\n", "  We study and construct spacetimes, dubbed planar AdS-dS-wormholes, satisfying\nthe null energy condition and having two asymptotically AdS boundaries\nconnected through a (non-traversable) inflating wormhole. As for other\nwormholes, it is natural to expect dual descriptions in terms of two\ndisconnected CFTs in appropriate entangled states. But for our cases certain\nexpected bulk entangling surfaces used by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT)\nprescription to compute CFT entropy do not exist. In particular, no real\ncodimension-2 extremal surface can run from one end of the wormhole to the\nother. According to HRT, the mutual information between any two finite-sized\nsubregions (one in each CFT) must then vanish at leading order in large $N$ --\nthough the leading-order mutual information per unit area between the two CFTs\ntaken as wholes may be nonzero. Some planar AdS-dS-wormholes also fail to have\nplane-symmetric surfaces that would compute the total entropy of either CFT. We\nsuggest this to remain true of less-symmetric surfaces so that the HRT entropy\nis ill-defined and some modified prescription is required. It may be possible\nto simply extend HRT or the closely-related maximin construction by a limiting\nprocedure, though complex extremal surfaces could also play an important role.\n", "  A projective geometry is an equivalence class of torsion free connections\nsharing the same unparametrised geodesics; this is a basic structure for\nunderstanding physical systems. Metric projective geometry is concerned with\nthe interaction of projective and pseudo-Riemannian geometry. We show that the\nBGG machinery of projective geometry combines with structures known as\nYang-Mills detour complexes to produce a general tool for generating invariant\npseudo-Riemannian gauge theories. This produces (detour) complexes of\ndifferential operators corresponding to gauge invariances and dynamics. We\nshow, as an application, that curved versions of these sequences give geometric\ncharacterizations of the obstructions to propagation of higher spins in\nEinstein spaces. Further, we show that projective BGG detour complexes generate\nboth gauge invariances and gauge invariant constraint systems for partially\nmassless models: the input for this machinery is a projectively invariant gauge\noperator corresponding to the first operator of a certain BGG sequence. We also\nconnect this technology to the log-radial reduction method and extend the\nlatter to Einstein backgrounds.\n", "  We devise an efficient algorithm for the symbolic calculation of irreducible\nangular momentum and spin (LS) eigenspaces within the $n$-fold antisymmetrized\ntensor product $\\wedge^n V_u$, where $n$ is the number of electrons and $u =\n\\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{p}, \\mathrm{d},\\dots$ denotes the atomic subshell. This is\nan essential step for dimension reduction in configuration-interaction (CI)\nmethods applied to atomic many-electron quantum systems. The algorithm relies\non the observation that each $L_z$ eigenstate with maximal eigenvalue is also\nan $\\boldsymbol{L}^2$ eigenstate (equivalently for $S_z$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{S}^2$), as well as the traversal of LS eigenstates using the\nlowering operators $L_-$ and $S_-$. Iterative application to the remaining\nstates in $\\wedge^n V_u$ leads to an implicit simultaneous diagonalization. A\ndetailed complexity analysis for fixed $n$ and increasing subshell number $u$\nyields run time $\\mathcal{O}(u^{3n-2})$. A symbolic computer algebra\nimplementation is available online.\n", "  For any toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold with transverse A-singularities, we prove\nRuan's crepant resolution conjecture and the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas\ncorrespondence.\n", "  The ${\\cal R}^2$ scale invariant gravity theory coupled to conformally\ninvariant matter is investigated. We show that in the non-supersymmetric case\nthe conformally coupled scalars belong to an $SO(1, 1+n)/SO(1+n)$ manifold,\nwhile in the supersymmetric case the scalar manifold becomes isomorphic to the\nK\\\"ahlerian space ${\\cal M}_n$=$SU(1, 1+n)/ U(1)\\times SU(1+n)$. In both cases\nwhen the underlying scale symmetry is preserved the vacuum corresponds to de\nSitter space. Once the scale symmetry is broken by quantum effects, a\ntransition to flat space becomes possible. We argue that the scale violating\nterms are induced by anomalies related to a $U(1)_R$ symmetry. The anomaly is\nresolved via the gauging of a Peccei-Quinn axion shift symmetry. The theory\ndescribes an inflationary transition from de Sitter to flat Minkowski space,\nvery similar to the Starobinsky inflationary model. The extension to metastable\nde Sitter superstring vacua is also investigated. The scalar manifold is\nextended to a much richer manifold, but it contains always ${\\cal M}_n$ as a\nsub-manifold. In superstrings the metastability is induced by axions that cure\nthe anomalies in chiral $N=1$ (or even $N=0$) supersymmetric vacua via a\nGreen-Schwarz/Peccei-Quinn mechanism generalized to four dimensions. We present\nsome typical superstring models and discuss the possible stabilization of the\nno-scale modulus.\n", "  Membrane deformation inside living cells is crucial for the proper shaping of\nvarious intracellular organelles and is necessary during the fission/fusion\nprocesses that allow membrane recycling and transport (e.g. endocytosis).\nProteins that induce membrane curvature play a key role in such processes,\nmostly by adsorbing to the membrane and forming a scaffold that deforms the\nmembrane according to the curvature of the proteins. In this paper we explore\nthe possibility of membrane tube destabilisation through a pearling mechanism\nenabled by the combined effects of the adsorbed curved proteins and the actin\npolymerization they may recruit. The pearling instability can furthermore serve\nas the initiation for fission of the tube into vesicles. We find that adsorbed\nproteins are more likely to stabilise the tubes, while the actin polymerization\ncan provide the additional constrictive force needed for the robust\ninstability. We discuss the relevance of the theoretical results to in-vivo and\nin-vitro experiments.\n", "  The spin transport and spin-to-charge current conversion properties of\nbismuth are investigated using permalloy/copper/bismuth (Py/Cu/Bi)lateral spin\nvalve structures. The spin current is strongly absorbed at the surface of Bi,\nleading to ultra-short spin diffusion lengths. A spin-to-charge current\nconversion is measured, which is attributed to the inverse Rashba-Edelstein\neffect at the Cu/Bi interface. The spin-current-induced charge current is found\nto change direction with increasing temperature. A theoretical analysis relates\nthis behavior to the complex spin structure and dispersion of the surface\nstates at the Fermi energy. The understanding of this phenomenon opens novel\npossibilities to exploit spin-orbit coupling to create, manipulate, and detect\nspin currents in 2D systems.\n", "  In this paper, we outline a method to compute supersymmetric one-loop\nintegrands in ten-dimensional SYM theory. It relies on the constructive\ninterplay between their cubic-graph organization and BRST invariance of the\nunderlying pure spinor superstring description. The five- and six-point\namplitudes are presented in a manifestly local form where the kinematic\ndependence is furnished by BRST-covariant expressions in pure spinor\nsuperspace. At five points, the local kinematic numerators are shown to satisfy\nthe BCJ duality between color and kinematics leading to supergravity amplitudes\nas a byproduct. At six points, the sources of the hexagon anomaly are\nidentified in superspace as systematic obstructions to BRST invariance. Our\nresults are expected to reproduce any integrated SYM amplitude in dimensions\n$D< 8$.\n", "  Scattering of electromagnetic fields by a defect layer embedded in a\nslow-light periodically layered ambient medium exhibits phenomena markedly\ndifferent from typical scattering problems. In a slow-light periodic medium,\nconstructed by Figotin and Vitebskiy, the energy velocity of a propagating mode\nin one direction slows to zero, creating a \"frozen mode\" at a single frequency\nwithin a pass band, where the dispersion relation possesses a flat inflection\npoint. The slow-light regime is characterized by a $3\\!\\times\\!3$ Jordan block\nof the log of the $4\\!\\times\\!4$ monodromy matrix for EM fields in a periodic\nmedium at special frequency and parallel wavevector. The scattering problem\nbreaks down as the 2D rightward and leftward mode spaces intersect in the\nfrozen mode and therefore span only a 3D subspace $\\mathring{V}$ of the 4D\nspace of EM fields.\n  Analysis of pathological scattering near the slow-light frequency and\nwavevector is based on the interaction between the flux-unitary transfer matrix\n$T$ across the defect layer and the projections to the rightward and leftward\nspaces, which blow up as Laurent-Puiseux series. Two distinct cases emerge: the\ngeneric, non-resonant case when $T$ does not map $\\mathring{V}$ to itself and\nthe quadratically growing mode is excited; and the resonant case, when\n$\\mathring{V}$ is invariant under $T$ and a guided frozen mode is resonantly\nexcited.\n", "  The classical approach for studying atmospheric variability is based on\ndefining a background state and studying the linear stability of the small\nfluctuations around such a state. Weakly non-linear theories can be constructed\nusing higher order expansions terms. While these methods have undoubtedly great\nvalue for elucidating the relevant physical processes, they are unable to\nfollow the dynamics of a turbulent atmosphere. We provide a first example of\nextension of the classical stability analysis to a non-linearly evolving\nquasi-geostrophic flow. The so-called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) provide\na covariant basis describing the directions of exponential expansion and decay\nof perturbations to the non-linear trajectory of the flow. We use such a\nformalism to re-examine the basic barotropic and baroclinic processes of the\natmosphere with a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane two-layer model in a periodic\nchannel driven by a forced meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. We\nexplore three settings of $\\Delta T$, representative of relatively weak\nturbulence, well-developed turbulence, and intermediate conditions. We\nconstruct the Lorenz energy cycle for each CLV describing the energy exchanges\nwith the background state. A positive baroclinic conversion rate is a necessary\nbut not sufficient condition of instability. Barotropic instability is present\nonly for few very unstable CLVs for large values of $\\Delta T$. Slowly growing\nand decaying hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes closely mirror the properties of the\nbackground flow. Following classical necessary conditions for\nbarotropic/baroclinic instability, we find a clear relationship between the\nproperties of the eddy fluxes of a CLV and its instability. CLVs with positive\nbaroclinic conversion seem to form a set of modes for constructing a reduced\nmodel of the atmosphere dynamics.\n", "  We present a hydrodynamic model of flocking that generalizes the familiar\nToner-Tu equations to incorporate turning inertia of well-polarized flocks. The\ncontinuum equations controlled by only two dimensionless parameters,\norientational inertia and alignment strength, are derived by coarse graining\nthe inertial spin model recently proposed by Cavagna et al. The interplay\nbetween orientational inertia and bend elasticity of the flock yields\nanisotropic spin waves that mediate the propagation of turning information\nthroughout the flock. The coupling between spin current density to the local\nvorticity field through a nonlinear friction gives rise to a hydrodynamic mode\nwith angular-dependent propagation speed at long wavelength. This mode goes\nunstable as a result of the growth of bend and splay deformations augmented by\nthe spin wave, signaling the transition to complex spatio-temporal patterns of\ncontinuously turning and swirling flocks.\n", "  Continuing on our previous work [ArXiv:1212.2644], we develop semi-implicit\nnumerical methods for solving low Mach number fluctuating hydrodynamic\nequations appropriate for modeling diffusive mixing in isothermal mixtures of\nfluids with different densities and transport coefficients. We treat viscous\ndissipation implicitly using a recently-developed variable-coefficient Stokes\nsolver [ArXiv:1308.4605]. This allows us to increase the time step size\nsignificantly compared to the earlier explicit temporal integrator. For\nviscous-dominated flows, such as flows at small scales, we develop a scheme for\nintegrating the overdamped limit of the low Mach equations, in which inertia\nvanishes and the fluid motion can be described by a steady Stokes equation. We\nalso describe how to incorporate advanced higher-order Godunov advection\nschemes in the numerical method, allowing for the treatment of fluids with high\nSchmidt number including the vanishing mass diffusion coefficient limit. We\nincorporate thermal fluctuations in the description in both the inertial and\noverdamped regimes. We apply our algorithms to model the development of giant\nconcentration fluctuations during the diffusive mixing of water and glycerol,\nand compare numerical results with experimental measurements. We find good\nagreement between the two, and observe propagative (non-diffusive) modes at\nsmall wavenumbers (large spatial scales), not reported in published\nexperimental measurements of concentration fluctuations in fluid mixtures. Our\nwork forms the foundation for developing low Mach number fluctuating\nhydrodynamics methods for miscible multi-species mixtures of chemically\nreacting fluids.\n", "  The generation of random numbers is a task of paramount importance in modern\nscience. A central problem for both classical and quantum randomness generation\nis to estimate the entropy of the data generated by a given device. Here we\npresent a protocol for self-testing quantum random number generation, in which\nthe user can monitor the entropy in real-time. Based on a few general\nassumptions, our protocol guarantees continuous generation of high quality\nrandomness, without the need for a detailed characterization of the devices.\nUsing a fully optical setup, we implement our protocol and illustrate its\nself-testing capacity. Our work thus provides a practical approach to quantum\nrandomness generation in a scenario of trusted but error-prone devices.\n", "  We describe a collective state atomic interferometer (COSAIN) with the signal\nfringe as a function of phase-difference or rotation narrowed by $\\sqrt{N}$\ncompared to a conventional interferometer - $N$ being the number of atoms -\nwithout entanglement. This effect arises from the interferences among\ncollective states, and is a manifestation of interference at a Compton\nfrequency of ten nonillion Hz, or a de Broglie wavelength of ten attometer, for\n$N=10^6$ and $v = 300 m/s$. The population of the collective state of interest\nis detected by a null measurement scheme, in which an event corresponding to\ndetection of zero photons corresponds to the system being in that particular\ncollective state. The signal is detected by collecting fluorescence through\nstimulated Raman scattering of Stokes photons, which are emitted predominantly\nagainst the direction of the probe beam, for a high enough resonant optical\ndensity. The sensitivity of the ideal COSAIN is found to be given by the\nstandard quantum limit. However, when detection efficiency and collection\nefficiency are taken into account, the detection scheme of the COSAIN increases\nthe quantum efficiency of detection significantly in comparison to a typical\nconventional Raman atomic interferometer employing fluorescence detection,\nyielding a net improvement in stability by as much as a factor of $10$. We\ndiscuss how the inhomogeneities arising from the non-uniformity in experimental\nparameters affect the COSAIN signal. We also describe an alternate experimental\nscheme to enhance resonant optical density in a COSAIN by using cross-linearly\npolarized counter-propagating Raman beams.\n", "  Hybrid organic/inorganic interfaces have been widely reported to host\nemergent properties that go beyond those of their single constituents. Coupling\nmolecules to the recently discovered topological insulators, which possess a\nlinearly dispersing and spin-momentum--locked Dirac fermions, may offer a\npromising platform towards new functionalities. Here, we report a scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of the prototypical interface\nbetween MnPc molecules and a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. MnPc is found to bind stably\nto the substrate through its central Mn atom. The adsorption process is only\naccompanied with a minor charge transfer across the interface, resulting in a\nmoderately n-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. More remarkably, topological states\nremain completely unaffected by the presence of the molecules, as evidenced by\nthe absence of scattering patterns around adsorption sites. Interestingly, we\nshow that, while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals closely resembles those of MnPc in\nthe gas phase, a new hybrid states emerges through interaction with the\nsubstrate. Our results pave the way towards hybrid organic--topological\ninsulator heterostructures, which may unveil a broad range of exciting and\nunknown phenomena.\n", "  Understanding and controlling the electronic as well as ro-vibrational motion\nand, thus, the entire chemical dynamics in molecules is the ultimate goal of\nultrafast laser and imaging science. In photochemistry, laser-induced\ndissociation has become a valuable tool for modification and control of\nreaction pathways and kinetics. Here, we present a pump-probe study of the\ndissociation dynamics of H$_2^+$ using ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and\nnear-infrared (IR) laser pulses. The reaction kinematics can be controlled by\nvarying the pump-probe delay. We demonstrate that the nuclear motion through\nthe transition state can be reduced to isolated pairs of initial vibrational\nstates. The dynamics is well reproduced by intuitive semi-classical\ntrajectories on a time-dependent potential curve. From this most fundamental\nscenario we gain insight in the underlying mechanisms which can be applied as\ndesign principles for molecular quantum control, particularly for ultrafast\nreactions involving protons.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) are a new class of quantum materials that\nexhibit spin momentum locking (SML) of massless Dirac fermions in the surface\nstates. Usually optical methods, such as angle and spin-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, have been employed to observe the helical spin polarization in\nthe surface states of three-dimensional (3D) TIs up to room temperatures.\nRecently, spin polarized surface currents in 3D TIs were detected by electrical\nmethods using ferromagnetic (FM) contacts in a lateral spin-valve measurement\ngeometry. However, probing the spin texture with such electrical approaches is\nso far limited to temperatures below 125K, which restricts its application\npotential. Here we demonstrate the room temperature electrical detection of the\nspin polarization on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ due to SML by employing spin\nsensitive FM tunnel contacts. The current-induced spin polarization on the\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ surface is probed at room temperature by measuring a spin-valve\nsignal while switching the magnetization direction of the FM detector. The spin\nsignal increases linearly with current bias, reverses sign with current\ndirection, exhibits a weak temperature dependence and decreases with higher TI\nthickness, as predicted theoretically. Our results demonstrate the electrical\ndetection of the spin polarization on the surface of 3D TIs, which could lead\nto innovative spin-based quantum information technology at ambient\ntemperatures.\n", "  The nonlinear theory of anomalous diffusion is based on particle interactions\ngiving an explicit microscopic description of diffusive processes leading to\nsub-, normal, or super-diffusion as a result competitive effects between\nattractive and repulsive interactions. We present the explicit analytical\nsolution to the nonlinear diffusion equation which we then use to compute the\ncorrelation function which is experimentally measured by correlation\nspectroscopy. The theoretical results are applicable in particular to the\nanalysis of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of marked molecules in\nbiological systems. More specifically we consider the case of fluorescently\nlabeled lipids and we find that the nonlinear correlation spectrum reproduces\nvery well the experimental data indicating sub-diffusive molecular motion of\nlipid molecules in the cell membrane.\n", "  The results of an experimental investigation of a sphere performing torsional\noscillations in a Stokes flow are presented. A novel experimental set up was\ndeveloped which enabled the motion of the sphere to be remotely controlled\nthrough application of an oscillatory magnetic field. The response of the\nsphere to the applied field was characterised in terms of the viscous, magnetic\nand gravitational torques acting on the sphere. A mathematical model of the\nsystem was developed and good agreement was found between experimental and\ntheoretical results. The flow resulting from the motion of the sphere was\nmeasured and the fluid velocity was found to have an inverse square dependence\non radial distance from the sphere. Agreement between measurements and the\nanalytical solution for the fluid velocity indicates that the flow may be\nconsidered Stokesian.\n", "  The present work is an extensive study of the viable stable solutions of\nchameleon scalar field models leading to possibilities of an accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. It is found that for various combinations of the\nchameleon field potential $V(\\phi)$ and the coupling $f(\\phi)$ of the chameleon\nfield with matter, a stable solution for an accelerated expansion is quite\npossible. The investigation provides a diagnostics for the stability criteria\nfor all sorts of combinations of $V(\\phi)$ and $f(\\phi)$.\n", "  We report the crystal growth of a new compound, Yb3Os4Ge13, by using a\nBi-flux method. X-ray diffraction measurement shows that it crystallizes in the\nquasi-skutterudite-type caged structure with a cubic space group of Pm-3n (No.\n223). Magnetic measurements reveal almost fully localized Yb f-moments above\n120 K. The resistivity exhibits a crossover from metallic to insulating\nbehavior with a logarithmic increase below ~ 40 K. The specific heat\ncoefficient shows a rapid upturn below ~5 K and exceeds 2 J mol-1 K-2 at 2 K.\nOur experimental analysis and electronic band structure calculations\ndemonstrate that Yb3Os4Ge13 exhibits the Kondo effect due to strong\nhybridization of the localized Yb f-moments with the p-electrons of the\nsurrounding Ge-cages.\n", "  We demonstrate the trapping of elastic particles by the large gradient force\nof a single acoustical beam in three dimensions. Acoustical tweezers can push,\npull and accurately control both the position and the forces exerted on a\nunique particle. Forces in excess of 1 micronewton were exerted on polystyrene\nbeads in the sub-millimeter range. A beam intensity less than 50 Watts/cm$^2$\nwas required ensuring damage-free trapping conditions. The large spectrum of\nfrequencies covered by coherent ultrasonic sources provide a wide variety of\nmanipulation possibilities from macro- to microscopic length scales. Our\nobservations could open the way to important applications, in particular in\nbiology and biophysics at the cellular scale and for the design of acoustical\nmachines in microfluidic environments.\n", "  We examine the effect of an external guide field and current sheet thickness\non the growth rates and nature of three dimensional unstable modes of an\nelectron current sheet driven by electron shear flow. The growth rate of the\nfastest growing mode drops rapidly with current sheet thickness but increases\nslowly with the strength of the guide field. The fastest growing mode is\ntearing type only for thin current sheets (half thickness $\\approx d_e$, where\n$d_e=c/\\omega_{pe}$ is electron inertial length) and zero guide field. For\nfinite guide field or thicker current sheets, fastest growing mode is\nnon-tearing type. However growth rates of the fastest 2-D tearing mode and 3-D\nnon-tearing mode are comparable for thin current sheets ($d_e < $half thickness\n$ < 2\\,d_e$) and small guide field (of the order of the asymptotic value of the\ncomponent of magnetic field supporting electron current sheet). It is shown\nthat the general mode resonance conditions for electron-magnetohydrodynamic\n(EMHD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tearing modes depend on the effective\ndissipation mechanism (electron inertia and resistivity in cases of EMHD and\nMHD, respectively). The usual tearing mode resonance condition\n($\\mathbf{k}.\\mathbf{B}_0=0$, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector and\n$\\mathbf{B}_0$ is equilibrium magnetic field) can be recovered from the general\nresonance conditions in the limit of weak dissipation. Necessary conditions\n(relating current sheet thickness, strength of the guide field and wave\nnumbers) for the existence of tearing mode are obtained from the general mode\nresonance conditions.\n", "  Algorithmic cooling is a method that employs thermalization to increase qubit\npurification level, namely it reduces the qubit-system's entropy. We utilized\ngradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), an optimal control algorithm, to\nimplement algorithmic cooling in liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance.\nVarious cooling algorithms were applied onto the three qubits of\n$^{13}$C$_2$-trichloroethylene, cooling the system beyond Shannon's entropy\nbound in several different ways. In particular, in one experiment a carbon\nqubit was cooled by a factor of 4.61. This work is a step towards potentially\nintegrating tools of NMR quantum computing into in vivo magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We present eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of trapped acoustic-inertial\noscillations of thin accretion disks for a Schwarzschild black hole and a\nrapidly rotating Newtonian star (a Maclaurin spheroid). The results are derived\nin the formalism of Nowak and Wagoner (1991) with the assumption that the\noscillatory motion is parallel to the midplane of the disk. The first four\nradial modes for each of five azimuthal modes $m = 0$ through $m = 4$ are\npresented. The frequencies and wavefunctions of the lowest modes may be\naccurately approximated by the Airy function.\n", "  Ultracold Fermi gases subject to tight transverse confinement offer a highly\ncontrollable setting to study the two-dimensional (2D) BCS to\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid crossover. Achieving the 2D regime\nrequires confining particles to their transverse ground state which presents\nchallenges in interacting systems. Here, we establish the conditions for an\ninteracting Fermi gas to behave kinematically 2D. Transverse excitations are\ndetected by measuring the transverse expansion rate which displays a sudden\nincrease when the atom number exceeds a critical value $N_{2D}$ signifying a\ndensity driven departure from 2D kinematics. For weak interactions $N_{2D}$ is\nset by the aspect ratio of the trap. Close to a Feshbach resonance, however,\nthe stronger interactions reduce $N_{2D}$ and excitations appear at lower\ndensity.\n", "  Incremental stiffness characterizes the variation of a material's force\nresponse to a small deformation change. Typically materials have an incremental\nstiffness that is fixed and positive, but recent technologies, such as\nsuper-lenses, low frequency band gap materials and acoustic cloaks, are based\non materials with zero, negative or extremely high incremental stiffness. So\nfar, demonstrations of this behavior have been limited either to a narrow range\nof frequencies, temperatures, stiffness or to specific deformations. Here we\ndemonstrate a mechanism to tune the static incremental stiffness that overcomes\nthose limitations. This tunability is achieved by driving a nonlinear defect\nmode in a lattice. As in thermal expansion, the defect's vibration amplitude\naffects the force at the boundary, hence the lattice's stiffness. By using the\nhigh sensitivities of nonlinear systems near bifurcation points, we tune the\nmagnitude of the incremental stiffness over a wide range: from positive, to\nzero, to arbitrarily negative values. The particular deformation where the\nincremental stiffness is modified can be arbitrarily selected varying the\ndefect's driving frequency. We demonstrate this experimentally in a compressed\narray of spheres and propose a general theoretical model.\n", "  We derive the complete set of off-shell nilpotent (s^2_{(a)b} = 0) and\nabsolutely anticommuting (s_b s_{ab} + s_{ab} s_b = 0)\nBecchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) (s_b) as well as anti-BRST symmetry\ntransformations (s_{ab}) corresponding to the combined Yang-Mills and\nnon-Yang-Mills symmetries of the (2 + 1)-dimensional Jackiw-Pi model within the\nframework of augmented superfield formalism. The absolute anticommutativity of\nthe (anti-)BRST symmetries is ensured by the existence of two sets of\nCurci-Ferrari (CF) type of conditions which emerge naturally in this formalism.\nThe presence of CF conditions enables us to derive the coupled but equivalent\nLagrangian densities. We also capture the (anti-)BRST invariance of the coupled\nLagrangian densities in the superfield formalism. The derivation of the\n(anti-)BRST transformations of the auxiliary field \\rho is one of the key\nfindings which can neither be generated by the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges\nnor by the requirements of the nilpotency and/or absolute anticommutativity of\nthe (anti-)BRST transformations. Finally, we provide a bird's-eye view on the\nrole of auxiliary field for various massive models and point out few striking\nsimilarities and some glaring differences among them.\n", "  We investigate dijet production from proton-nucleus collisions at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) as a means for observing superfast quarks in nuclei with\nBjorken $x>1$. Kinematically, superfast quarks can be identified through\ndirectly measurable jet kinematics. Dynamically, their description requires\nunderstanding several elusive properties of nuclear QCD, such as nuclear forces\nat very short distances, as well as medium modification of parton distributions\nin nuclei. In the present work, we develop a model for nuclear parton\ndistributions at large $x$ in which the nuclear dynamics at short distance\nscales are described by two- and three-nucleon short range correlations (SRCs).\nNuclear modifications are accounted for using the color screening model, and an\nimproved description of the EMC effect is reached by using a structure function\nparametrization that includes higher-twist contributions. We apply QCD\nevolution at the leading order to obtain nuclear parton distributions in the\nkinematic regime of the LHC, and based on the obtained distributions calculate\nthe cross section for dijet production. We find not only that superfast quarks\ncan be observed at the LHC, but also that they provide sensitivity to the\npractically unexplored three-nucleon SRCs in nuclei. Additionally, the LHC can\nextend our knowledge of the EMC effect to large $Q^2$ where higher-twist\neffects are negligible.\n", "  The dynamic magnetic behaviors of the spin-1 Blume-Capel Ising bilayer system\n(BCIS) are studied in an oscillating external magnetic field on a two-layer\nsquare lattice by utilizing the mean field theory based on Glauber-type\nstochastic dynamics (DMFT). The dynamic equations describing the\ntime-dependencies of the average magnetizations are obtained with the Master\nequation. The dynamic phases in this system are found by solving these dynamic\nequations. The temperature dependence of the dynamic order parameters is\nexamined to characterize the nature (continuous or discontinuous) of the phase\ntransitions and to obtain the dynamic phase transition points (DPT). The\ndynamic phase diagrams are shown for ferromagnetic / ferromagnetic,\nantiferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic\ninteractions in the plane of the reduced temperature versus magnetic field\namplitude and they display dynamic tricritical and reentrant behavior as well\nas the dynamic triple point.\n", "  We study the Poiseuille flow of a soft-glassy material above the jamming\npoint, where the material flows like a complex fluid with Herschel- Bulkley\nrheology. Microscopic plastic rearrangements and the emergence of their spatial\ncorrelations induce cooperativity flow behavior whose effect is pronounced in\npresence of confinement. With the help of lattice Boltzmann numerical\nsimulations of confined dense emulsions, we explore the role of geometrical\nroughness in providing activation of plastic events close to the boundaries. We\nprobe also the spatial configuration of the fluidity field, a continuum\nquantity which can be related to the rate of plastic events, thereby allowing\nus to establish a link between the mesoscopic plastic dynamics of the jammed\nmaterial and the macroscopic flow behaviour.\n", "  The long wavelength limit of a recent microscopic phase field crystal (PFC)\ntheory of a binary alloy mix- ture is used to derive an analytical\napproximation for the segregation coefficient as a function of the interface\nvelocity, and relate it to the two-point correlation function of the liquid and\nthe thermodynamic properties of solid and liquid phases. Our results offer the\nfirst analytic derivation of solute segregation and solute drag de- rived from\na microscopic model, and analytically support recent molecular dynamics and\nfully numerical PFC simulations. Our analytical result also provides an\nindependent framework, motivated from classical density functional theory, from\nwhich to elucidate the fundamental nature of solute drag, which is still highly\ncontested in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the possible implications of the measured value of the scalar\ntilt $n_s$ for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in slow-roll, single-field\ninflationary models. The measured value of the tilt satisfies $n_s -1\\sim\n1/N_*$, where $N_* \\sim 60$ is the number of $e$-folds for observationally\nrelevant scales. If this is not a coincidence and the scaling holds for\ndifferent values of $N$, it strongly suggests that either $r$ is as big as\n$10^{-1}$ (a possibility in tension with the recent data), or smaller than\n$10^{-2}$ and exponentially dependent on $n_s$. A large region of the\n($n_s$,$r$) plane is not compatible with this scaling.\n", "  The average geomagnetic activity during sunspot minimum has been continuously\ndecreasing in the last four cycles. The geomagnetic activity is caused by both\ninterplanetary disturbances - coronal mass ejections and high speed solar wind\nstreams, and the background solar wind over which these disturbances ride. We\nshow that the geomagnetic activity in cycle minimum does not depend on the\nnumber and parameters of coronal mass ejections or high speed solar wind\nstreams, but on the background solar wind. The background solar wind has two\ncomponents: slower and faster. The source of the slower component is the\nheliospheric current sheet, and of the faster one the polar coronal holes. It\nis supposed that the geomagnetic activity in cycle minimum is determined by the\nthickness of the heliospheric current sheet which is related to the portions of\ntime the Earth spends in slow and in fast solar wind. We demonstrate that it is\nalso determined by the parameters of these two components of the background\nsolar wind which vary from cycle to cycle.\n", "  Recently Neil Ross and Peter Selinger analyzed the problem of approximating\nz- rotations by means of single-qubit Clifford+T circuits. Their main\ncontribution is a deterministic-search technique which allowed them to make\napproximating circuits shallower. We adapt the deterministic-search technique\nto the case of Pauli+V circuits and prove similar results. Because of the\nrelative simplicity of the Pauli+V framework, we use much simpler geometric\nmethods.\n", "  The concept of Fourier synthesis is heavily employed in both consumer\nelectronic products and fundamental research. In the latter, pulse shaping is\nkey to dynamically initialize, probe and manipulate the state of classical or\nquantum systems. In nuclear magnetic resonance, for instance, shaped pulses\nhave a long-standing tradition and the underlying fundamental concepts have\nsubsequently been successfully extended to optical frequencies and even to\nimplement quantum gate operations. Transferring these paradigms to\nnanomechanical systems requires tailored nanomechanical waveforms. Here, we\nreport on an additive Fourier synthesizer for nanomechanical waveforms based on\nmonochromatic surface acoustic waves. As a proof of concept, we electrically\nsynthesize four different elementary nanomechanical waveforms from a\nfundamental surface acoustic wave at $ f_1 \\sim 150$ MHz using a superposition\nof up to three discrete harmonics $f_n$. We employ these shaped pulses to\ninteract with an individual sensor quantum dot and detect their deliberately\nand temporally modulated strain component via the opto-mechanical quantum dot\nresponse. Importantly, and in contrast to the direct mechanical actuation by\nbulk piezoactuators, surface acoustic waves provide much higher frequencies (>\n20 GHz) to resonantly drive mechanical motion. Thus, our technique uniquely\nallows coherent mechanical control of localized vibronic modes of\noptomechanical crystals, even in the quantum limit when cooled to the\nvibrational ground state.\n", "  We present a next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of $t\\bar{t}$ production\nin hadronic collisions interfaced to shower generators according to the POWHEG\nmethod. We start from an NLO result from previous work, obtained in the zero\nwidth limit, where radiative corrections to both production and decays are\nincluded. The POWHEG interface required an extension of the POWHEG BOX\nframework, in order to deal with radiation from the decay of resonances. This\nextension is fully general (i.e. it can be applied in principle to any process\nconsidered in the zero width limit), and is here applied for the first time. In\norder to perform a realistic simulation, we introduce finite width effects\nusing different approximations, that we validated by comparing with published\nexact NLO results. We have interfaced our POWHEG code to the PYTHIA8 shower\nMonte Carlo generator. At this stage, we dealt with novel issues related to the\ntreatment of resonances, especially with regard to the initial scale for the\nshower that needs to be set appropriately. This procedure affects, for example,\nthe fragmentation function of the b quark, that we have studied with particular\nattention. We believe that the tool presented here improves over previous\ngenerators for all aspects that have to do with top decays, and especially for\nthe study of issues related to top mass measurements that involve B hadrons or\nb jets. The work presented here also constitutes a first step towards a fully\nconsistent matching of NLO calculations involving intermediate resonances\ndecaying into coloured particles, with parton showers.\n", "  We focus on a special type of domain walls appearing in the Landau-Lifshitz\ntheory for soft ferromagnetic films. These domain walls are divergence-free\n$S^2$-valued transition layers that connect two directions in $S^2$ (differing\nby an angle $2\\theta$) and minimize the Dirichlet energy. Our main result is\nthe rigorous derivation of the asymptotic structure and energy of such\n\"asymmetric\" domain walls in the limit $\\theta \\to 0$. As an application, we\ndeduce that a supercritical bifurcation causes the transition from symmetric to\nasymmetric walls in the full micromagnetic model.\n", "  We extend and apply a rigorous renormalisation group method to study critical\ncorrelation functions, on the 4-dimensional lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^4$, for the\nweakly coupled $n$-component $|\\varphi|^4$ spin model for all $n \\geq 1$, and\nfor the continuous-time weakly self-avoiding walk. For the $|\\varphi|^4$ model,\nwe prove that the critical two-point function has $|x|^{-2}$ (Gaussian) decay\nasymptotically, for $n \\ge 1$. We also determine the asymptotic decay of the\ncritical correlations of the squares of components of $\\varphi$, including the\nlogarithmic corrections to Gaussian scaling, for $n \\geq 1$. The above extends\npreviously known results for $n = 1$ to all $n \\ge 1$, and also observes new\nphenomena for $n > 1$, all with a new method of proof. For the continuous-time\nweakly self-avoiding walk, we determine the decay of the critical generating\nfunction for the \"watermelon\" network consisting of p weakly mutually- and\nself-avoiding walks, for all $p \\ge 1$, including the logarithmic corrections.\nThis extends a previously known result for $p = 1$, for which there is no\nlogarithmic correction, to a much more general setting. In addition, for both\nmodels, we study the approach to the critical point and prove existence of\nlogarithmic corrections to scaling for certain correlation functions. Our\nmethod gives a rigorous analysis of the weakly self-avoiding walk as the $n =\n0$ case of the $|\\varphi|^4$ model, and provides a unified treatment of both\nmodels, and of all the above results.\n", "  Motivated by an experimental interest we investigate by the means of\natomistic Molecular Dynamics simulation the ability of density-independent,\nempiric density-dependent, and recently proposed embedded-atom force fields for\nliquid mercury to predict the surface tension of the free surface of liquid\nmercury at the temperature of 293~K. The effect of the density dependence of\nthe studied models on the liquid-vapor coexistence and surface tension is\ndiscussed in detail. In view of computational efficiency of the\ndensity-independent model we optimize its functional form to obtain higher\nsurface tension values in order to improve agreement with experiment. The\nresults are also corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations and semi-analytic\nestimations of the liquid-vapor coexistence density.\n", "  We prove a general lower bound to the spectral gap of the Davies generator\nfor Hamiltonians that can be written as the sum of commuting Pauli operators.\nThese Hamiltonians, defined on the Hilbert space of $N$-qubits, serve as one of\nthe most frequently considered candidates for a self-correcting quantum memory.\nA spectral gap bound on the Davies generator establishes an upper limit on the\nlife time of such a quantum memory and can be used to estimate the time until\nthe system relaxes to thermal equilibrium when brought into contact with a\nthermal heat bath. The bound can be shown to behave as $\\lambda \\geq {\\cal\nO}(N^{-1}\\exp(-2\\beta \\, \\overline{\\epsilon}))$, where $\\overline{\\epsilon}$ is\na generalization of the well known energy barrier for logical operators.\nParticularly in the low temperature regime we expect this bound to provide the\ncorrect asymptotic scaling of the gap with the system size up to a factor of\n$N^{-1}$. Furthermore, we discuss conditions and provide scenarios where this\nfactor can be removed and a constant lower bound can be proven\n", "  We use 12 large quasar group (LQG) samples to investigate the homogeneity of\n$0.5\\lesssim z \\lesssim 2$ Universe ($z$ denotes the redshift). We calculate\nthe bias factor $b$ and the two-point correlation function $\\xi_{{\\rm LQG}}$\nfor such groups for three different density profiles of the LQG dark matter\nhalos, i.e. the isothermal profile, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, and\nthe (gravitational) lensing profile. We consider the $\\Lambda$CDM concordance\nmodel of our Universe with $\\Omega_m=0.28$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.72$, the Hubble\nconstant $H_0=100h~$km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $h=0.72$ in our calculations.\nDividing the samples into three redshift bins, we find that the LQGs with\nhigher redshift are more biased and correlated than those with lower redshift.\nThe redshift-increasing LQG correlation amplitudes we find is incompatible with\nthat predicted by the standard theory of structure growth. The homogeneity\nscale $R_H$ of the LQG distribution is also deduced. It is defined as the\ncomoving radius of the sphere inside which the number of LQGs $N(<r)$ is\nproportional to $r^3$ within $1\\%$, or equivalently above which the correlation\ndimension of the sample $D_2$ is within $1\\%$ of $D_2=3$. For the NFW dark\nmatter halo profile, the homogeneity scales of the LQG distribution are\n$R_H\\simeq 224$ $h^{-1}$Mpc for $0.5< z\\leq 1$, $R_H\\simeq 316$ $h^{-1}$Mpc for\n$1< z\\leq 1.5$, and $R_H\\simeq 390$ $h^{-1}$Mpc for $1.5< z\\lesssim 2$. These\nvalues are above the characteristic sizes of the LQG samples in each bin,\nimplying the validity of the cosmological principle on the LQG scale, i.e. a\nlength range of $200\\sim 400~h^{-1}$Mpc and a mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{14}$M$_\\odot$. ...\n", "  We study strings associated with minimal 6d SCFTs, which by definition have\nonly one string charge and no Higgs branch. These theories are labelled by a\nnumber n with 1 <= n <= 8 or n = 12. Quiver theories have previously been\nproposed which describe strings of SCFTs for n = 1, 2. For n > 2 the strings\ninteract with the bulk gauge symmetry. In this paper we find a quiver\ndescription for the n = 4 string using Sen's limit of F-theory and calculate\nits elliptic genus with localization techniques. This result is checked using\nthe duality of F-theory with M-theory and topological string theory whose\nrefined BPS partition function captures the elliptic genus of the SCFT strings.\nWe use the topological string theory to gain insight into the elliptic genus\nfor other values of n.\n", "  We investigate $U(1)^{\\,n}$ supersymmetric Born-Infeld Lagrangians with a\nsecond non-linearly realized supersymmetry. The resulting non-linear structure\nis more complex than the square root present in the standard Born-Infeld\naction, and nonetheless the quadratic constraints determining these models can\nbe solved exactly in all cases containing three vector multiplets. The\ncorresponding models are classified by cubic holomorphic prepotentials. Their\nsymmetry structures are associated to projective cubic varieties.\n", "  We present an updated model of light and charge yields from nuclear recoils\nin liquid xenon with a simultaneously constrained parameter set. A global\nanalysis is performed using measurements of electron and photon yields compiled\nfrom all available historical data, as well as measurements of the ratio of the\ntwo. These data sweep over energies from 1 - 300 keV and external applied\nelectric fields from 0 - 4060 V/cm. The model is constrained by constructing\nglobal cost functions and using a gradient descent minimizer, a simulated\nannealing algorithm, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to optimize and\nfind confidence intervals on all free parameters in the model. This analysis\ncontrasts with previous work in that we do not unnecessarily exclude data sets\nnor impose artificially conservative assumptions, do not use spline functions,\nand reduce the number of parameters used in NEST v0.98. We report our results\nand the calculated best-fit charge and light yields. These quantities are\ncrucial to understanding the response of liquid xenon detectors in the energy\nregime important for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark\nmatter particles.\n", "  This paper presents the applications of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (as part\nof spectral decomposition) to analyze the bipartivity index of graphs as well\nas to predict the set of vertices that will constitute the two partitions of\ngraphs that are truly bipartite and those that are close to being bipartite.\nThough the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector (called the\nprincipal eigenvalue and principal eigenvector) are typically used in the\nspectral analysis of network graphs, we show that the smallest eigenvalue and\nthe smallest eigenvector (called the bipartite eigenvalue and the bipartite\neigenvector) could be used to predict the bipartite partitions of network\ngraphs. For each of the predictions, we hypothesize an expected partition for\nthe input graph and compare that with the predicted partitions. We also analyze\nthe impact of the number of frustrated edges (edges connecting the vertices\nwithin a partition) and their location across the two partitions on the\nbipartivity index. We observe that for a given number of frustrated edges, if\nthe frustrated edges are located in the larger of the two partitions of the\nbipartite graph (rather than the smaller of the two partitions or equally\ndistributed across the two partitions), the bipartivity index is likely to be\nrelatively larger.\n", "  We study the diffusion of epidemics on networks that are partitioned into\nlocal communities. The gross structure of hierarchical networks of this kind\ncan be described by a quotient graph. The rationale of this approach is that\nindividuals infect those belonging to the same community with higher\nprobability than individuals in other communities. In community models the\nnodal infection probability is thus expected to depend mainly on the\ninteraction of a few, large interconnected clusters. In this work, we describe\nthe epidemic process as a continuous-time individual-based\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model using a first-order mean-field\napproximation. A key feature of our model is that the spectral radius of this\nsmaller quotient graph (which only captures the macroscopic structure of the\ncommunity network) is all we need to know in order to decide whether the\noverall healthy-state defines a globally asymptotically stable or an unstable\nequilibrium. Indeed, the spectral radius is related to the epidemic threshold\nof the system. Moreover we prove that, above the threshold, another\nsteady-state exists that can be computed using a lower-dimensional dynamical\nsystem associated with the evolution of the process on the quotient graph. Our\ninvestigations are based on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition\nand of its recent and rather flexible generalization, that of almost equitable\npartition.\n", "  Nanoscale and power-efficient electro-optic (EO) modulators are essential\ncomponents for optical interconnects that are beginning to replace electrical\nwiring for intra- and inter-chip communications. Silicon-based EO modulators\nshow sufficient figures of merits regarding device footprint, speed, power\nconsumption and modulation depth. However, the weak electro-optic effect of\nsilicon still sets a technical bottleneck for these devices, motivating the\ndevelopment of modulators based on new materials. Graphene, a two-dimensional\ncarbon allotrope, has emerged as an alternative active material for\noptoelectronic applications owing to its exceptional optical and electronic\nproperties. Here, we demonstrate a high-speed graphene electro-optic modulator\nbased on a graphene-boron nitride (BN) heterostructure integrated with a\nsilicon photonic crystal nanocavity. Strongly enhanced light-matter interaction\nof graphene in a submicron cavity enables efficient electrical tuning of the\ncavity reflection. We observe a modulation depth of 3.2 dB and a cut-off\nfrequency of 1.2 GHz.\n", "  We study a 2-functor that assigns to a bimodule category over a finite\nk-linear tensor category a k-linear abelian category. This 2-functor can be\nregarded as a category-valued trace for 1-morphisms in the tricategory of\nfinite tensor categories. It is defined by a universal property that is a\ncategorification of Hochschild homology of bimodules over an algebra. We\npresent several equivalent realizations of this 2-functor and show that it has\na coherent cyclic invariance.\n  Our results have applications to categories associated to circles in\nthree-dimensional topological field theories with defects. This is made\nexplicit for the subclass of Dijkgraaf-Witten topological field theories.\n", "  In recent work, Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations were derived for the\n\"Yard-Sale Model\" of asset exchange. For the version of the model without\nredistribution, it was conjectured, based on numerical evidence, that the\ntime-asymptotic state of the model was oligarchy -- complete concentration of\nwealth by a single individual. In this work, we prove that conjecture by\ndemonstrating that the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality commonly used\nby economists, is an $H$ function of both the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck\nequations for the model.\n", "  We recently predicted that the interatomic Coulombic electron capture (ICEC)\nprocess, a long-range electron correlation driven capture process, is\nachievable in gated double quantum dots (DQDs). In ICEC an incoming electron is\ncaptured by one QD and the excess energy is used to remove an electron from the\nneighboring QD. In this work we present systematic full three-dimensional\nelectron dynamics calculations in quasi-one dimensional model potentials that\nallow for a detailed understanding of the connection between the DQD geometry\nand the reaction probability for the ICEC process. We derive an effective\none-dimensional approach and show that its results compare very well with those\nobtained using the full three-dimensional calculations. This approach\nsubstantially reduces the computation times. The investigation of the\nelectronic structure for various DQD geometries for which the ICEC process can\ntake place clarify the origin of its remarkably high probability in the\npresence of two-electron resonances.\n", "  We study the ergodic properties of a two-dimensional self-gravitating system\nusing molecular dynamics simulations. We apply three different tests for\nergodicity: a direct method comparing the time average of a particle momentum\nand position to the respective ensemble average, sojourn times statistics and\nthe dynamical functional method. For comparison purposes they are also applied\nto a short-range interacting system and to the Hamiltonian mean-field model.\nOur results show that a two-dimensional self-gravitating system takes a very\nlong time to establish ergodicity. If a Kac factor is used in the potential\nenergy, such that the total energy is extensive, then this time is independent\nof particle number, and diverges with $\\sqrt{N}$ without a Kac factor.\n", "  We study the evolutionary conditions for Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in\na H-alpha solar surge observed in NOAA AR 8227 on 1998 May 30. The jet with\nspeeds in the range of 45-50 km/s, width of 7 Mm, and electron number density\nof 3.83 x 10^{10} cm^{-3} is assumed to be confined in a twisted magnetic flux\ntube embedded in a magnetic field of 7 G. The temperature of the plasma flow is\nof the order of 10^5 K while that of its environment is taken to be 2 x 10^6 K.\nThe electron number density of surrounding magnetized plasma has a typical for\nthe TR/lower corona region value of 2 x 10^{9} cm^{-3}. Under these conditions,\nthe Alfven speed inside the jet is equal to 78.3 km/s. We model the surge as a\nmoving magnetic flux tube for two magnetic field configurations: (i) a twisted\ntube surrounded by plasma with homogeneous background magnetic field, and (ii)\na twisted tube which environment is plasma with also twisted magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field twist in given region is characterized by the ratio of\nazimuthal to the axial magnetic field components evaluated at the flux tube\nradius. The numerical studies of appropriate dispersion relations of MHD modes\nsupported by the plasma flow in both magnetic field configurations show that\nunstable against Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can only be the MHD waves with\nhigh negative mode numbers and the instability occurs at sub-Alfvenic critical\nflow velocities in the range of 25-50 km/s.\n", "  Classical objectivity as a property of quantum states---a view proposed to\nexplain the observer-independent character of our world from quantum theory, is\nan important step in bridging the quantum-classical gap. It was recently\nderived in terms of spectrum broadcast structures for small objects embedded in\nnoisy photon-like environments. However, two fundamental problems have arisen:\na description of objective motion and applicability to other types of\nenvironments. Here we derive an example of objective states of motion in\nquantum mechanics by showing a formation of dynamical spectrum broadcast\nstructures in the celebrated, realistic model of decoherence---Quantum Brownian\nMotion. We do it for realistic, thermal environments and show their\nnoise-robustness. This opens a potentially new method of studying\nquantum-to-classical transition.\n", "  We summarise the Topical Workshop on Top Quark Differential Distributions\n2014, which took place in Cannes immediately before the annual Top2014\nconference. The workshop was motivated by the availability of top quark\ndifferential distributions at NNLO and the forthcoming LHC 13 TeV data. The\nmain goal of the workshop was to explore the impact of improved calculations of\ntop quark production on precision LHC measurements, PDF determinations and\nsearches for physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as finding ways in\nwhich the high precision data from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb can be used to further\nrefine theoretical predictions for top production.\n", "  We present a survey of $z\\sim3$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within the fields\nof the VLT LBG Redshift Survey. The data encompasses 5 independent survey\nfields co-spatial with spectroscopic LBG data and covering a larger total area\nthan previously analysed for LAE number counts and clustering. This affords an\nimproved analysis over previous work by minimising the effects of cosmic\nvariance and allowing the cross-clustering analysis of LAEs and LBGs. Our\nphotometric sample consists of $\\approx600$ LAE candidates, over an area of\n1.07~deg$^2$, with equivalent widths of $\\gtrsim65$~\\AA\\ and a flux limit of\n$\\approx2\\times10^{-17}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. From spectroscopic follow-up,\nwe measured a success rate of $78\\pm18\\%$. We find the $R$-band continuum\nluminosity function to be $\\sim10\\times$ lower than the luminosity function of\nLBGs at this redshift, consistent with previous studies. Exploiting the large\narea of the survey, we estimate the LAE auto-correlation function and find a\nclustering length of $r_0=2.86\\pm0.33~h^{-1}$~Mpc, low compared to the $z\\sim3$\nLBG population, but somewhat higher than previous LAE measurements. This\ncorresponds to a median halo mass of $M_{\\rm\nDM}=10^{11.0\\pm0.3}~h^{-1}~$M$_{\\odot}$. We present an analysis of clustering\nlength versus continuum magnitude and find that the measurements for LAEs and\nLBGs are consistent at faint magnitudes. Our combined dataset of LAEs and LBGs\nallows us to measure, for the first time, the LBG-LAE cross-correlation,\nfinding a clustering length of $r_0=3.29\\pm0.57~h^{-1}$~Mpc and a LAE halo mass\nof $10^{11.1\\pm0.4}~h^{-1}$~M$_{\\odot}$. Overall, we conclude that LAEs inhabit\nprimarily low mass halos, but form a relatively small proportion of the galaxy\npopulation found in such halos.\n", "  The anomalous $WW\\gamma$ coupling is probed through $e\\gamma\\rightarrow \\nu\nW$ at the ILC. With a spectacular single lepton final state, this process is\nwell suited to study the above coupling. Cross section measurements can probe\n$\\delta \\kappa_\\gamma$ to about $\\pm 0.004$ for a luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$\nat $500$ GeV center-of-mass energy with unpolarized electron beam. The limits\nderivable on $\\lambda_\\gamma$ from the total cross section are comparatively\nmore relaxed. Exploiting the energy-angle double distribution of the secondary\nmuons, kinematic regions sensitive to these couplings are identified. The\nderivable limit on $\\lambda_\\gamma < 0$ could be improved to a few per-mil,\nfocusing on such regions. More importantly, the angular distributions at fixed\nenergy values, and energy distribution at fixed angles present very interesting\npossibility of distinguishing the case of $\\lambda_\\gamma <0$ and\n$\\lambda_\\gamma \\ge 0$.\n", "  Dipolar bilayers with antiparallel polarization, i.e. opposite polarization\nin the two layers, exhibit liquid-like rather than gas-like behavior. In\nparticular, even without external pressure a self-bound liquid puddle of\nconstant density will form. We investigate the symmetric case of two identical\nlayers, corresponding to a two-component Bose system with equal partial\ndensities. The zero-temperature equation of state $E(\\rho)/N$, where $\\rho$ is\nthe total density, has a minimum, with an equilibrium density that decreases\nwith increasing distance between the layers. The attraction necessary for a\nself-bound liquid comes from the inter-layer dipole-dipole interaction that\nleads to a mediated intra-layer attraction. We investigate the regime of\nnegative pressure towards the spinodal instability, where the bilayer is\nunstable against infinitesimal fluctuations of the total density, conformed by\ncalculations of the speed of sound of total density fluctuations.\n", "  Fully exploiting the silicon photonics platform requires a fundamentally new\napproach to realize high-performance laser sources that can be integrated\ndirectly using wafer-scale fabrication methods. Direct band gap III-V\nsemiconductors allow efficient light generation but the large mismatch in\nlattice constant, thermal expansion and crystal polarity makes their epitaxial\ngrowth directly on silicon extremely complex. Here, using a selective area\ngrowth technique in confined regions, we surpass this fundamental limit and\ndemonstrate an optically pumped InP-based distributed feedback (DFB) laser\narray grown on (001)-Silicon operating at room temperature and suitable for\nwavelength-division-multiplexing applications. The novel epitaxial technology\nsuppresses threading dislocations and anti-phase boundaries to a less than 20nm\nthick layer not affecting the device performance. Using an in-plane laser\ncavity defined by standard top-down lithographic patterning together with a\nhigh yield and high uniformity provides scalability and a straightforward path\ntowards cost-effective co-integration with photonic circuits and III-V FINFET\nlogic.\n", "  The formation of velocity vortices and density clusters is an intriguing\nphenomenon of freely cooling granular flows. In this work, the critical length\nscale $L_c$ for the onset of instability is determined via stability analysis\nof the linearized Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations of $d$-dimensional\ngranular binary mixtures at moderate densities. In contrast to previous\nattempts, the analysis is not restricted to nearly elastic systems since it\ntakes into account the nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients and\nthe cooling rate on the collisional dissipation. As expected from previous\nresults obtained in the very dilute regime, linear stability shows $d-1$\ntransversal (shear) modes and a longitudinal (\"heat\") mode to be unstable with\nrespect to long enough wavelength excitations. The theoretical predictions also\nshow that the origin of the instability is driven by the transversal component\nof the velocity field that becomes \\emph{unstable} when the system length\n$L>L_c$. An explicit expression of $L_c$ is obtained in terms of the masses and\ndiameters of the mixture, the composition, the volume fraction and the\ncoefficients of restitution. Previous results derived in the limit of both\nmechanically equivalent particles and low-density mixtures are consistently\nrecovered. Finally, a comparison with previous theoretical works which neglect\nthe influence of dissipation on the transport coefficients shows quantitative\ndiscrepancies for strong dissipation.\n", "  During inflation, the geometry of spacetime is described by a (quasi-)de\nSitter phase. Inflationary observables are determined by the underlying (softly\nbroken) de Sitter isometry group SO(1, 4) which acts like a conformal group on\nR^3: when the fluctuations are on super-Hubble scales, the correlators of the\nscalar fields are constrained by conformal invariance. Heavy fields with mass m\nlarger than the Hubble rate H correspond to operators with imaginary dimensions\nin the dual Euclidean three-dimensional conformal field theory. By making use\nof the dS/CFT correspondence we show that, besides the Boltzmann suppression\nexpected from the thermal properties of de Sitter space, the generic effect of\nheavy fields in the inflationary correlators of the light fields is to\nintroduce power-law suppressed corrections of the form O(H^2/m^2). This can be\nseen, for instance, at the level of the four-point correlator for which we\nprovide the correction due to a massive scalar field exchange.\n", "  In inertial confinement fusion the target implosion non-uniformity is\nintroduced by a driver beams' illumination non-uniformity, a fuel target\nalignment error in a fusion reactor, the target fabrication defect, et al. For\na steady operation of a fusion power plant the target implosion should be\nrobust against the implosion non-uniformities. In this paper the requirement\nfor the implosion uniformity is first discussed. The implosion uniformity\nshould be less than a few percent. A study on the fuel hotspot dynamics is also\npresented and shows that the stagnating plasma fluid provides a significant\nenhancement of vorticity at the final stage of the fuel stagnation. Then\nnon-uniformity mitigation mechanisms of the heavy ion beam (HIB) illumination\nare also briefly discussed in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). A density valley\nappears in the energy absorber, and the large-scale density valley also works\nas a radiation energy confinement layer, which contributes to a radiation\nenergy smoothing. In HIF a wobbling heavy ion beam illumination was also\nintroduced to realize a uniform implosion. In the wobbling HIBs illumination,\nthe illumination non-uniformity oscillates in time and space on a HIF target.\nThe oscillating-HIB energy deposition may contribute to the reduction of the\nHIBs' illumination non-uniformity by its smoothing effect on the HIB\nillumination non-uniformity and also by a growth mitigation effect on the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability.\n", "  Valley pseudospin, the quantum degree of freedom characterizing the\ndegenerate valleys in energy bands, is a distinct feature of two-dimensional\nDirac materials. Similar to spin, the valley pseudospin is spanned by a time\nreversal pair of states, though the two valley pseudospin states transform to\neach other under spatial inversion. The breaking of inversion symmetry induces\nvarious valley-contrasted physical properties; for instance, valley-dependent\ntopological transport is of both scientific and technological interests.\nBilayer graphene (BLG) is a unique system whose intrinsic inversion symmetry\ncan be controllably broken by a perpendicular electric field, offering a rare\npossibility for continuously tunable valley-topological transport. Here, we\nused a perpendicular gate electric field to break the inversion symmetry in\nBLG, and a giant nonlocal response was observed as a result of the topological\ntransport of the valley pseudospin. We further showed that the valley transport\nis fully tunable by external gates, and that the nonlocal signal persists up to\nroom temperature and over long distances. These observations challenge\ncontemporary understanding of topological transport in a gapped system, and the\nrobust topological transport may lead to future valleytronic applications.\n", "  A conduction-cooled superconducting magnet producing a transverse field of 4\nTesla has been designed for the new generation multi-field coupling measurement\nsystem, which was used to study the mechanical behavior of superconducting\nsamples at cryogenic temperature and intense magnetic fields. Considering\nexperimental costs and coordinating with system of strain measurements by\ncontactless signals (nonlinear CCD optics system), the racetrack type for the\ncoil winding was chosen in our design, and a compact cryostat with a two-stage\nGM cryocooler was designed and manufactured for the superconducting magnet. The\nmagnet was composed of a pair of flat racetrack coils wound by NbTi/Cu\nsuperconducting composite wires, a copper and stainless steel combinational\nform and two Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy superconducting current leads. All the coils were\nconnected in series and can be powered with a single power supply. The maximum\ncentral magnetic field is 4 T. In order to support the high stress and uniform\nthermal distribution in the superconducting magnet, a detailed finite element\n(FE) analysis has been performed. The detailed design of superconducting\nracetrack magnet system is described in this paper.\n", "  Valley is a useful degree of freedom for non-dissipative electronics since\nvalley current that can flow even in an insulating material does not accompany\nelectronic current. We use dual-gated bilayer graphene in the Hall bar geometry\nto electrically control broken inversion symmetry or Berry curvature as well as\nthe carrier density to generate and detect the pure valley current. We find a\nlarge nonlocal resistance and a cubic scaling between the nonlocal resistance\nand the local resistivity in the insulating regime at zero-magnetic field and\n70 K as evidence of the pure valley current. The electrical control of the\nvalley current in the limit of zero conductivity allows non-dissipative\ninduction of valley current from electric field and thus provides a significant\ncontribution to the advancement of non-dissipative electronics.\n", "  We present the calculation of the $Z_H \\to \\gamma H$ decay in the context of\nthe Littlest Higgs model at one-loop level. Our calculations include the\ncontributions of fermions, scalars and gauge bosons in accordance with the most\nrecent experimental constraints on the parameters space of the model. We find\nbranching ratios of the order of $10^{-5}$ for the energy scale $f=2,3,4$ TeV\non the $0.1<c<0.9$ region. In order to provide a complementary study we\ncalculated the production cross section of the $Z_H$ boson in $pp$ collisions\nat Large Hadron Collider with a center of mass energy of 14 TeV. By using the\nintegrated luminosity projected for the Large Hadron Collider in the last stage\nof operation, we estimated the number of events for this process. Moreover, we\nanalyze the SM background for the Higgs-photon associated production and found\nthat the $pp\\to Z_H X \\to \\gamma H$ production is above the SM background.\n", "  We propose and compare six different ways of mapping the modified $q$-voter\nmodel to complex networks. Considering square lattices, Barab\\'asi-Albert,\nWatts-Strogatz and real Twitter networks, we ask the question if always a\nparticular choice of the group of influence of a fixed size $q$ leads to\ndifferent behavior at the macroscopic level. Using Monte Carlo simulations we\nshow that the answer depends on the relative average path length of the network\nand for real-life topologies the differences between the considered mappings\nmay be negligible.\n", "  Zero- to ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) provides a new\nregime for the measurement of nuclear spin-spin interactions free from effects\nof large magnetic fields, such as truncation of terms that do not commute with\nthe Zeeman Hamiltonian. One such interaction, the magnetic dipole-dipole\ncoupling, is a valuable source of spatial information in NMR, though many terms\nare unobservable in high-field NMR, and the coupling averages to zero under\nisotropic molecular tumbling. Under partial alignment, this information is\nretained in the form of so-called residual dipolar couplings. We report zero-\nto ultra-low-field NMR measurements of residual dipolar couplings in\nacetonitrile-2-$^{13}$C aligned in stretched polyvinyl acetate gels. This\nrepresents the first investigation of dipolar couplings as a perturbation on\nthe indirect spin-spin $J$-coupling in the absence of an applied magnetic\nfield. As a consequence of working at zero magnetic field, we observe terms of\nthe dipole-dipole coupling Hamiltonian that are invisible in conventional\nhigh-field NMR. This technique expands the capabilities of zero- to\nultra-low-field NMR and has potential applications in precision measurement of\nsubtle physical interactions, chemical analysis, and characterization of local\nmesoscale structure in materials.\n", "  Density Functional Theory calculations traditionally suffer from an inherent\ncubic scaling with respect to the size of the system, making big calculations\nextremely expensive. This cubic scaling can be avoided by the use of so-called\nlinear scaling algorithms, which have been developed during the last few\ndecades. In this way it becomes possible to perform ab-initio calculations for\nseveral tens of thousands of atoms or even more within a reasonable time frame.\nHowever, even though the use of linear scaling algorithms is physically well\njustified, their implementation often introduces some small errors.\nConsequently most implementations offering such a linear complexity either\nyield only a limited accuracy or, if one wants to go beyond this restriction,\nrequire a tedious fine tuning of many parameters. In our linear scaling\napproach within the BigDFT package, we were able to overcome this restriction.\nUsing an ansatz based on localized support functions expressed in an underlying\nDaubechies wavelet basis -- which offers ideal properties for accurate linear\nscaling calculations -- we obtain an amazingly high accuracy and a universal\napplicability while still keeping the possibility of simulating large systems\nwith only a moderate demand of computing resources.\n", "  We define and study a set of operators that compute statistical properties of\nthe Brownian Loop Soup, a conformally invariant gas of random Brownian loops\n(Brownian paths constrained to begin and end at the same point) in two\ndimensions. We prove that the correlation functions of these operators have\nmany of the properties of conformal primaries in a conformal field theory, and\ncompute their conformal dimension. The dimensions are real and positive, but\nhave the novel feature that they vary continuously as a periodic function of a\nreal parameter. We comment on the relation of the Brownian Loop Soup to the\nfree field, and use this relation to establish that the central charge of the\nLoop Soup is twice its intensity.\n", "  We report on the effects of ionizing radiation on 65nm CMOS transistors held\nat approximately -20C during irradiation. The pattern of damage observed after\na total dose of 1 Grad is similar to damage reported in room temperature\nexposures, but we observe less damage than was observed at room temperature.\n", "  I retrace the developments from Hagedorn's concept of a limiting temperature\nfor hadronic matter to the discovery and characterization of the quark-gluon\nplasma as a new state of matter. My recollections begin with the transformation\nmore than 30 years ago of Hagedorn's original concept into its modern\ninterpretation as the \"critical\" temperature separating the hadron gas and\nquark-gluon plasma phases of strongly interacting matter. This was followed by\nthe realization that the QCD phase transformation could be studied\nexperimentally in high-energy nuclear collisions. I describe here my personal\neffort to help develop the strangeness experimental signatures of quark and\ngluon deconfinement and recall how the experimental program proceeded soon to\ninvestigate this idea, at first at the SPS, then at RHIC, and finally at LHC.\nAs it is often the case, the experiment finds more than theory predicts, and I\nhighlight the discovery of the \"perfectly\" liquid quark-gluon plasma at RHIC. I\nconclude with an outline of future opportunities, especially the search for a\ncritical point in the QCD phase diagram.\n", "  We show that the duality orbits of extremal black holes in supergravity\ntheories with symmetric scalar manifolds can be derived by studying the\nstabilizing subalgebras of suitable representatives, realized as bound states\nof specific weight vectors of the corresponding representation of the duality\nsymmetry group. The weight vectors always correspond to weights that are real,\nwhere the reality properties are derived from the Tits-Satake diagram that\nidentifies the real form of the Lie algebra of the duality symmetry group. Both\nN=2 magic Maxwell-Einstein supergravities and the semisimple infinite sequences\nof N=2 and N=4 theories in D=4 and 5 are considered, and various results,\nobtained over the years in the literature using different methods, are\nretrieved. In particular, we show that the stratification of the orbits of\nthese theories occurs because of very specific properties of the\nrepresentations: in the case of the theory based on the real numbers, whose\nsymmetry group is maximally non-compact and therefore all the weights are real,\nthe stratification is due to the presence of weights of different length, while\nin the other cases it is due to the presence of complex weights.\n", "  We consider the Higgs Lepton Flavor Violating process $h \\rightarrow \\tau\n\\mu$, in which CMS found a $2.5 \\sigma$ excess of events, from a model\nindependent perspective, and find that it is difficult to generate this\noperator without also obtaining a sizeable Wilson coefficient for the dipole\noperators responsible for tau radiative decay, constrained by BABAR to\n${BR}(\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma)< 4.4 \\times 10^{-8} $. We then survey a set\nof representative models for new physics, to determine which ones are capable\nof evading this problem. We conclude that, should this measurement persist as a\nsignal, type-III Two Higgs Doublet Models and Higgs portal-like models are\nfavored, while SUSY and Composite Higgs models are unlikely to explain it.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of a previously published realization of\nPopper's experiment using entangled ghost imaging. Our analysis, which is based\non optical diffraction integrals, shows that, for the configuration previously\ndescribed, the transverse spread of an unmeasured particle (the signal photon\nhere) does not increase in inverse proportion to the width of its virtual\nconfinement when its entangled twin is confined in transverse dimension by a\nphysical slit. Rather we show that the spread of the unmeasured particle\ncarries no dependence on the width of its virtual confinement in the published\nconfiguration. Instead, it spreads geometrically at a rate determined by the\nnumerical aperture of the ghost imaging system. We further propose an\nalternative configuration for which the spread of the unmeasured particle does\nincrease in inverse proportion to the width of its virtual confinement. We\ndiscuss the relation of these results to the predictions of Popper.\n", "  We show that the metastable, symmetry-breaking ground states of quantum\nmany-body Hamiltonians have vanishing quantum mutual information between\nmacroscopically separated regions, and are thus the most classical ones among\nall possible quantum ground states. This statement is obvious only when the\nsymmetry-breaking ground states are simple product states, e.g. at the\nfactorization point. On the other hand, symmetry-breaking states are in general\nentangled along the entire ordered phase, and to show that they actually\nfeature the least macroscopic correlations compared to their symmetric\nsuperpositions is highly non trivial. We prove this result in general, by\nconsidering the quantum mutual information based on the $2-$R\\'enyi\nentanglement entropy and using a locality result stemming from quasi-adiabatic\ncontinuation. Moreover, in the paradigmatic case of the exactly solvable\none-dimensional quantum $XY$ model, we further verify the general result by\nconsidering also the quantum mutual information based on the von Neumann\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  During the inflationary epoch,geometry of the universe may be described by\nquasi-de Sitter space. On the other hand,maximally extended de Sitter metric in\nthe comoving coordinates accords with a special FLRW model with positive\nspatial curvature,so in this article we focus on the positively curved\ninflationary paradigm.For this purpose,first we derive the power spectra of\ncomoving curvature perturbation and primordial gravitational waves in a\npositively curved FLRW universe according to the slowly rolling inflationary\nsenario. It can be shown that the curvature spectral index in this model\nautomatically has a small negative running parameter which is compatible with\nobservational measurements.Then,by taking into account the curvature factor,we\ninvestigate the relative amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations.It\nwould be clarified that the tensor-scalar ratio for this model against the\nspatially flat one,depends on the waelength of the perturbative models\ndirectly.\n", "  Using simple methods of asymptotic analysis it is shown that for a quantum\nharmonic oscillator in n-th energy eigenstate the probability of tunneling into\nthe classically forbidden region obeys an unexpected but simple asymptotic\nformula: the leading term is inversely proportional to the cube root of n.\n", "  In the latter half of the last century, it became evident that there exists\nan ever increasing number of different states of the so-called elementary\nparticles. The usual reductionist approach to this problem was to search for a\nsimpler infrastructure, culminating in the formulation of the quark model and\nquantum chromodynamics. In a complementary, completely novel approach, Hagedorn\nsuggested that the mass distribution of the produced particles follows a\nself-similar composition pattern, predicting an unbounded number of states of\nincreasing mass. He then concluded that such a growth would lead to a limiting\ntemperature for strongly interacting matter. We discuss the conceptual basis\nfor this approach, its relation to critical behavior, and its subsequent\napplications in different areas of high energy physics.\n", "  In the present article explicit expressions for the decay rate and energy\nlevel shifts of an atom in the presence of an ideal conducting wedge, two\nparallel plates and a half-sheet are obtained in the frame work of the\ncanonical quantization approach. The angular and radial dependence of the decay\nrate for different atomic polarizations of an excited atom and also of the\nenergy level shifts are depicted and discussed. The consistency of the present\napproach in some limiting cases is investigated by comparing the relevant\nresults obtained here to the previously reported results.\n", "  Thermal waves are caused by pure diffusion: their amplitude is decreased by\nmore than a factor of 500 within a propagation distance of one wavelength. The\ndiffusion equation, which describes the temperature as a function of space and\ntime, is linear. For every linear equation the superposition principle is\nvalid, which is known as Huygens principle for optical or mechanical wave\nfields. This limits the spatial resolution, like the Abbe diffraction limit in\noptics. The resolution is the minimal size of a structure which can be detected\nat a certain depth. If an embedded structure at a certain depth in a sample is\nsuddenly heated, e.g. by eddy current or absorbed light, an image of the\nstructure can be reconstructed from the measured temperature at the sample\nsurface. To get the resolution the image reconstruction can be considered as\nthe time reversal of the thermal wave. This inverse problem is ill-conditioned\nand therefore regularization methods have to be used taking additional\nassumptions like smoothness of the solutions into account. In the present work\nfor the first time methods of non-equilibrium statistical physics are used to\nsolve this inverse problem without the need of such additional assumptions and\nwithout the necessity to choose a regularization parameter. For reconstructing\nsuch an embedded structure by thermal waves the resolution turns out to be\nproportional to the depth and inversely proportional to the natural logarithm\nof the signal-to-noise ratio. This result could be derived from the diffusion\nequation by using a delta-source at a certain depth and setting the entropy\nproduction caused by thermal diffusion equal to the information loss. No\nspecific model about the stochastic process of the fluctuations and about the\ndistribution densities around the mean values was necessary to get this result.\n", "  Given a mixed hyperspectral data set, linear unmixing aims at estimating the\nreference spectral signatures composing the data - referred to as endmembers -\ntheir abundance fractions and their number. In practice, the identified\nendmembers can vary spectrally within a given image and can thus be construed\nas variable instances of reference endmembers. Ignoring this variability\ninduces estimation errors that are propagated into the unmixing procedure. To\naddress this issue, endmember variability estimation consists of estimating the\nreference spectral signatures from which the estimated endmembers have been\nderived as well as their variability with respect to these references. This\npaper introduces a new linear mixing model that explicitly accounts for spatial\nand spectral endmember variabilities. The parameters of this model can be\nestimated using an optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers. The performance of the proposed unmixing method is\nevaluated on synthetic and real data. A comparison with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms designed to model and estimate endmember variability allows the\ninterest of the proposed unmixing solution to be appreciated.\n", "  We report on our studies of fractal butterflies in biased bilayer graphene in\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime. We have considered the case\nwhen the external periodic potential is present in one layer and have\nillustrated the effect of varying both the periodic potential strength and the\nbias voltage on the FQHE and the butterfly energy gaps. Interestingly, the\nbutterfly spectra exhibits remarkable phase transitions between the FQHE gap\nand the butterfly gap for chiral electrons in bilayer graphene, by varying\neither the periodic potential strength or the bias voltage. We also find that,\nin addition to those phase transitions, by varying the bias voltage one can\nessentially control the periodic potential strength experienced by the\nelectrons.\n", "  We use analytic conformal bootstrap methods to determine the anomalous\ndimensions and OPE coefficients for large spin operators in general conformal\nfield theories in four dimensions containing a scalar operator of conformal\ndimension $\\Delta_\\phi$. It is known that such theories will contain an\ninfinite sequence of large spin operators with twists approaching\n$2\\Delta_\\phi+2n$ for each integer $n$. By considering the case where such\noperators are separated by a twist gap from other operators at large spin, we\nanalytically determine the $n$, $\\Delta_\\phi$ dependence of the anomalous\ndimensions. We find that for all $n$, the anomalous dimensions are negative for\n$\\Delta_\\phi$ satisfying the unitarity bound. We further compute the first\nsubleading correction at large spin and show that it becomes universal for\nlarge twist. In the limit when $n$ is large, we find exact agreement with the\nAdS/CFT prediction corresponding to the Eikonal limit of a 2-2 scattering with\ndominant graviton exchange.\n", "  The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project has been\nproposed for the survey and study of cosmic rays. In the LHAASO project, the\nWater Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) is one of major detectors for searching\ngamma ray sources. A Charge-to-Time Convertor (QTC) ASIC (Application\nSpecification Integrated Circuit) fabricated in Global Foundry 0.35 {\\mu}m CMOS\ntechnology, has been developed for readout of Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) in\nthe WCDA. This paper focuses on the evaluation of this front-end readout ASIC\nperformance. Test results indicate that the time resolution is better than 400\nps and the charge resolution is better than 1% with large input signals and\nremains better than 15% @ 1 Photo Electron (P.E.), both beyond the application\nrequirement. Moreover, this ASIC has a weak ambient temperature dependence, low\ninput rate dependence and high channel-to-channel isolation.\n", "  The deterministic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation has been used to\ninvestigate the nonlinear dynamics of magnetization and the specific loss power\nin magnetic nanoparticles with uniaxial anisotropy driven by a rotating\nmagnetic field. We propose a new type of applied field, which is\n\"simultaneously rotating and alternating\", i.e. the direction of the rotating\nexternal field changes periodically. We show that a more efficient heat\ngeneration by magnetic nanoparticles is possible with this new type of applied\nfield and we suggest its possible experimental realization in cancer therapy\nwhich requires the enhancement of loss energies.\n", "  Here we show that the zero point energy associated to the quantum spin\nfluctuations of a non- collinear spin texture produce Casimir-like magnetic\nfields. We study the effect of these Casimir fields on the topologically\nprotected non-collinear spin textures known as skyrmions. We calculate the zero\npoint energy, to the lowest order in the spin wave expansion, in a Heisenberg\nmodel with Dzyalonshinkii-Moriya interactions chosen so that the classical\nground state displays skyrmion textures, that disappear upon application of a\nstrong enough magnetic field. Our calculations show that the Casimir magnetic\nfield contributes a 10 percent of the total Zeeman energy necessary to delete\nthe skyrmion texture with an applied field, and is thereby an observable\neffect.\n", "  The functions and elasticities of the cell are largely related to the\nstructures of the cytoskeletons underlying the lipid bi-layer. Among various\ncell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal\nstructure. Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a\ntwo dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other\nproteins) and edges of spectrins. Recent experiments focusing on the malaria\ninfected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation\nof spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. Here\nwe rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the\nworm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium\nTheory (EMT) for the network elasticity. We specifically focus on how the\ndisorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity.\nAnalytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of\nthe membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but\nhas a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance\ndistributions. These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and\nmicropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs. The model may, from a molecular\nlevel, provide guidelines for future identification of new treatment methods\nfor RBC related diseases, such as malaria infection.\n", "  We study rotating thermal states of a massless quantum fermion field inside a\ncylinder in Minkowski space-time. Two possible boundary conditions for the\nfermion field on the cylinder are considered: the spectral and MIT bag boundary\nconditions. If the radius of the cylinder is sufficiently small, rotating\nthermal expectation values are finite everywhere inside the cylinder. We also\nstudy the Casimir divergences on the boundary. The rotating thermal expectation\nvalues and the Casimir divergences have different properties depending on the\nboundary conditions applied at the cylinder. This is due to the local nature of\nthe MIT bag boundary condition, while the spectral boundary condition is\nnonlocal.\n", "  We describe how to apply the transport method to compute inflationary\nobservables in a broad range of multiple-field models. The method is efficient\nand encompasses scenarios with curved field-space metrics, violations of\nslow-roll conditions and turns of the trajectory in field space. It can be used\nfor an arbitrary mass spectrum, including massive modes and models with\nquasi-single-field dynamics. In this note we focus on practical issues. It is\naccompanied by a Mathematica code which can be used to explore suitable models,\nor as a basis for further development.\n", "  Coupled nonlinear oscillators can exhibit a wide variety of patterns. We\nstudy the Brusselator as a prototypical autocatalytic reaction diffusion model.\nWorking in the limit of strong nonlinearity provides a clear timescale\nseparation that leads to a canard explosion in a single Brusselator. In this\nhighly nonlinear regime it is numerically found that rings of coupled\nBrusselators do not follow the predictions from Turning analysis. We find that\nthe behavior can be explained using a piecewise linear approximation.\n", "  The recently established threshold theorem for energy critical wave maps\nstates that wave maps with energy less than that of the ground state (i.e., a\nminimal energy nontrivial harmonic map) are globally regular and scatter on\n(1+2)-dimensional Minkowski space. In this note we give a refinement of this\ntheorem when the target is a closed orientable surface by taking into account\nan additional invariant of the problem, namely the topological degree. We show\nthat the sharp energy threshold for global regularity and scattering is in fact\ntwice the energy of the ground state for wave maps with degree zero, whereas\nwave maps with nonzero degree necessarily have at least the energy of the\nground state. We also give a discussion on the formulation of a refined\nthreshold conjecture for the energy critical $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills equation on\n(1+4)-dimensional Minkowski space.\n", "  Materials with high carrier mobility showing large magnetoresistance (MR)\nhave recently received much attention because of potential applications in\nfuture high-performance magneto-electric devices. Here, we report on the\ndiscovery of an electron-hole-compensated half-Heusler semimetal LuPtBi that\nexhibits an extremely high electron mobility of up to 79000 cm2/Vs with a\nnon-saturating positive MR as large as 3200% at 2 K. Remarkably, the mobility\nat 300 K is found to exceed 10500 cm2/Vs, which is among the highest values\nreported in three-dimensional bulk materials thus far. The clean Shubnikov-de\nHaas quantum oscillation observed at low temperatures and the first-principles\ncalculations together indicate that the high electron mobility is due to a\nrather small effective carrier mass caused by the distinctive band structure of\nthe crystal. Our finding provide a new approach for finding large,\nhigh-mobility MR materials by designing an appropriate Fermi surface topology\nstarting from simple electron-hole-compensated semimetals.\n", "  D3-branes wrapping constant curvature Riemann surfaces give rise to 2D N =\n(0,2) SCFTs, where the superconformal fixed-points are mapped to vacua of 3D N\n=2 U(1)^3 gauged supergravity. In this work we determine the fermionic\nsupersymmetry variations of the theory and present all supersymmetric\nsolutions. For spacetimes with a timelike Killing vector, we identify new\ntimelike warped AdS_3 (G\\\"odel) and timelike warped dS_3 critical points. We\noutline the construction of numerical solutions interpolating between\nfixed-points, demonstrate that these flows are driven by an irrelevant scalar\noperator in the SCFT and identify the inverse of the superpotential as a\ncandidate c-function. We further classify all spacetimes with a null Killing\nvector, in the process producing loci in parameter space where null-warped\nAdS_3 vacua with Schrodinger z=2 symmetry exist. We construct\nnon-supersymmetric spacelike warped AdS_3 geometries based on D3-branes.\n", "  We report novel interference effects in wave packet scattering of identical\nparticles incident on the same side of a resonant barrier, different from those\nobserved in Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments. These include significant changes in\nthe mean number of transmissions and full counting statistics, as well as\n\"bunching\" and \"anti-bunching\" effects in the all-particles transmission\nchannel. With several resonances involved, pseudo-resonant driving of the\ntwo-level system in the barrier, may result in sharp enhancement of scattering\nprobabilities for certain values of temporal delay between the particles.\n", "  We propose a novel SIR epidemic model which is driven by the transmission of\ninfection packets in networks. Specifically, infected nodes generate and\ndeliver infection packets causing the spread of the epidemic, while recovered\nnodes block the delivery of infection packets, and this inhibits the epidemic\nspreading. The efficient routing protocol governed by a control parameter\n$\\alpha$ is used in the packet transmission. We obtain the maximum\ninstantaneous population of infected nodes, the maximum population of ever\ninfected nodes, as well as the corresponding optimal $\\alpha$ through\nsimulation. We find that generally more balanced load distribution leads to\nmore intense and wide spread of an epidemic in networks. Increasing either\naverage node degree or homogeneity of degree distribution will facilitate\nepidemic spreading. When packet generation rate $\\rho$ is small, increasing\n$\\rho$ favors epidemic spreading. However, when $\\rho$ is large enough, traffic\ncongestion appears which inhibits epidemic spreading.\n", "  We use F-theory to classify possibly all six-dimensional superconformal field\ntheories (SCFTs). This involves a two step process: We first classify all\npossible tensor branches allowed in F-theory (which correspond to allowed\ncollections of contractible spheres) and then classify all possible\nconfigurations of seven-branes wrapped over them. We describe the first step in\nterms of \"atoms\" joined into \"radicals\" and \"molecules,\" using an analogy from\nchemistry. The second step has an interpretation via quiver-type gauge theories\nconstrained by anomaly cancellation. A very surprising outcome of our analysis\nis that all of these tensor branches have the structure of a linear chain of\nintersecting spheres with a small amount of possible decoration at the two\nends. The resulting structure of these SCFTs takes the form of a generalized\nquiver consisting of ADE-type nodes joined by conformal matter. A collection of\nhighly non-trivial examples involving E8 small instantons probing an ADE\nsingularity is shown to have an F-theory realization. This yields a\nclassification of homomorphisms from ADE subgroups of SU(2) into E8 in purely\ngeometric terms, largely matching results obtained in the mathematics\nliterature from an intricate group theory analysis.\n", "  We quantify the prior information to infer the optimal characteristics for a\nconstrained thermodynamic process of maximum work extraction for a pair of\nnon-identical finite systems. The total entropy of the whole system remains\nconserved. The ignorance is assumed about the final temperature of the finite\nsystems and then a prior distribution is assigned to the unknown temperatures.\nWe derive the estimates of efficiency for this reversible model of heat engine\nwith incomplete information. The estimates show good agreement with efficiency\nat optimal work for arbitrary sizes of systems, however the estimates become\nexact when one of the reservoir becomes very large in comparison to the other.\n", "  We introduce numerical optimization of multi-site support functions in the\nlinear-scaling DFT code CONQUEST. Multi-site support functions, which are\nlinear combinations of pseudo-atomic orbitals on a target atom and those\nneighbours within a cutoff, have been recently proposed to reduce the number of\nsupport functions to the minimal basis while keeping the accuracy of a large\nbasis [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 4813]. The coefficients were\ndetermined by using the local filter diagonalization (LFD) method [Phys. Rev.\nB, 2009, 80, 205104]. We analyse the effect of numerical optimization of the\ncoefficients produced by the LFD method. Tests on crystalline silicon, a\nbenzene molecule and hydrated DNA systems show that the optimization improves\nthe accuracy of the multi-site support functions with small cutoffs. It is also\nconfirmed that the optimization guarantees the variational energy minimizations\nwith multi-site support functions.\n", "  The Solar Simulations for the Atacama Large Millimeter Observatory Network\n(SSALMON) was initiated in 2014 in connection with two ALMA development\nstudies. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a powerful\nnew tool, which can also observe the Sun at high spatial, temporal, and\nspectral resolution. The international SSALMONetwork aims at coordinating the\nfurther development of solar observing modes for ALMA and at promoting\nscientific opportunities for solar physics with particular focus on numerical\nsimulations, which can provide important constraints for the observing modes\nand can aid the interpretation of future observations. The radiation detected\nby ALMA originates mostly in the solar chromosphere - a complex and dynamic\nlayer between the photosphere and corona, which plays an important role in the\ntransport of energy and matter and the heating of the outer layers of the solar\natmosphere. Potential targets include active regions, prominences, quiet Sun\nregions, flares. Here, we give a brief overview over the network and potential\nscience cases for future solar observations with ALMA.\n", "  At radio wavelengths, scattering in the interstellar medium distorts the\nappearance of astronomical sources. Averaged over a scattering ensemble, the\nresult is a blurred image of the source. However, Narayan & Goodman (1989) and\nGoodman & Narayan (1989) showed that for an incomplete average, scattering\nintroduces refractive substructure in the image of a point source that is both\npersistent and wideband. We show that this substructure is quenched but not\nsmoothed by an extended source. As a result, when the scatter-broadening is\ncomparable to or exceeds the unscattered source size, the scattering can\nintroduce spurious compact features into images. In addition, we derive\nefficient strategies to numerically compute realistic scattered images, and we\npresent characteristic examples from simulations. Our results show that\nrefractive substructure is an important consideration for ongoing missions at\nthe highest angular resolutions, and we discuss specific implications for\nRadioAstron and the Event Horizon Telescope.\n", "  In the previous paper \\cite{L-Z}, for a characteristic problem with not\nnecessarily small initial data given on a complete null cone decaying like that\nin the work \\cite{Ch-K} of the stability of Minkowski spacetime by\nChristodoulou and Klainerman, we proved the local existence in retarded time,\nwhich means the solution to the vacuum Einstein equations exists in a uniform\nfuture neighborhood, while the global existence in retarded time is the weak\ncosmic censorship conjecture. In this paper, we prove that the local existence\nin retarded time still holds when the data is assumed to decay slower, like\nthat in Bieri's work \\cite{Bie} on the extension to the stability of Minkowski\nspacetime. Such decay guarantees the existence of the limit of the Hawking mass\non the initial null cone, when approaching to infinity, in an optimal way.\n", "  Isolating ground-based interferometric gravitational wave observatories from\nenvironmental disturbances is one of the great challenges of the advanced\ndetector era. In order to directly observe gravitational waves, the detector\ncomponents and test masses must be highly inertially decoupled from the ground\nmotion not only to sense the faint strain of space-time induced by\ngravitational waves, but also to maintain the resonance of the very sensitive 4\nkm interferometers.\n  This article presents the seismic isolation instrumentation and strategy\ndeveloped for Advanced LIGO interferometers. It reviews over a decade of\nresearch on active isolation in the context of gravitational wave detection,\nand presents the performance recently achieved with the Advanced LIGO\nobservatory. Lastly, it discusses prospects for future developments in active\nseismic isolation and the anticipated benefits to astrophysical gravitational\nwave searches.\n  Beyond gravitational wave research, the goal of this article is to provide\ndetailed isolation strategy guidelines for sensitive ground-based physics\nexperiments that may benefit from similar levels of inertial isolation.\n", "  An experimental model of transmission of ocean waves by an ice floe is\npresented. Thin plastic plates with different material properties and\nthicknesses are used to model the floe. Regular incident waves with different\nperiods and steepnesses are used, ranging from gently-sloping to storm-like\nconditions. A wave gauge is used to measure the water surface elevation in the\nlee of the floe. The depth of wave overwash on the floe is measured by a gauge\nin the centre of the floe's upper surface. Results show transmitted waves are\nregular for gently-sloping incident waves but irregular for storm-like incident\nwaves. The proportion of the incident wave transmitted is shown to decrease as\nincident wave steepness increases, and to be at its minimum for an incident\nwavelength equal to the floe length. Further, a trend is noted for transmission\nto decrease as the mean wave height in the overwash region increases.\n", "  Recent experiments show that charge-density-wave correlations are prevalent\nin underdoped cuprate superconductors. The correlations are short ranged at\nweak magnetic fields but their intensity and spatial extent increase rapidly at\nlow temperatures beyond a crossover field. Here we consider the possibility of\nlong-range charge-density-wave order in a model of a layered system where such\norder competes with superconductivity.We show that in the clean limit,\nlow-temperature long-range order is stabilized by arbitrarily weak magnetic\nfields. This apparent discrepancy with the experiments is resolved by the\npresence of disorder. Like the field, disorder nucleates halos of\ncharge-density wave, but unlike the former it also disrupts interhalo\ncoherence, leading to a correlation length that is always finite. Our results\nare compatible with various experimental trends, including the onset of longer\nrange correlations induced by interlayer coupling above a characteristic field\nscale.\n", "  The exact solutions of the complete Dirac equation for fermions moving in\nideal Aharonov-Bohm rings are used for deriving the exact expressions of the\nrelativistic partial currents. It is show that as in the non-relativistic case\nthese currents can be related to the derivative of the fermion energy with\nrespect to the flux parameter. A specific relativistic effect is the saturation\nof the partial currents for high values of the total angular momentum. Based on\nthis property, the total relativistic persistent current at $T=0$ is evaluated\ngiving its analytical expression and showing how this depend on the ring\nparameters.\n", "  We show that low density homogeneous phases of self propelled hard disks\nexhibit a transition from isotropic to polar collective motion, albeit of a\nqualitatively distinct class from the Vicsek one. In the absence of noise, an\nabrupt discontinuous transition takes place between the isotropic phase and a\nfully polar absorbing state. Increasing the noise, the transition becomes\ncontinuous at a tri-critical point. We explain all our numerical findings in\nthe framework of Boltzmann theory, on the basis of the binary scattering\nproperties. We show that the qualitative differences observed between the\npresent and the Vicsek model at the level of their phase behavior, take their\norigin in the complete opposite physics taking place during scattering events.\nWe argue that such differences will generically hold for systems of\nself-propelled particles with repulsive short range interactions.\n", "  A brief history of the observation of the onset of deconfinement - the\nbeginning of the creation of quark gluon plasma in nucleus-nucleus collisions\nwith increasing collision energy - is presented. It starts with the measurement\nof hadron mass spectrum and the Hagedorn's hypothesis of the limiting\ntemperature of hadronic matter (the Hagedorn temperature). Then the conjecture\nthat the Hagedorn temperature is the phase transition temperature was\nformulated with the crucial Hagedorn participation. It was confirmed by the\nobservation of the onset of deconfinement in lead-lead collisions at the CERN\nSPS energies.\n", "  In wavelet based electron structure calculations introducing a new, finer\nresolution level is usually an expensive task, this is why often a two-level\napproximation is used with very fine starting resolution level. This process\nresults in large matrices to calculate with and a large number of coefficients\nto be stored. In our previous work we have developed an adaptively refining\nsolution scheme that determines the indices, where refined basis functions are\nto be included, and later a method for predicting the next, finer resolution\ncoefficients in a very economic way. In the present contribution we would like\nto determine, whether the method can be applied for predicting not only the\nfirst, but also the other, higher resolution level coefficients. Also the\nenergy expectation values of the predicted wave functions are studied, as well\nas the scaling behaviour of the coefficients in the fine resolution limit.\n", "  Pseudopotentials, tight-binding models, and $k\\cdot p$ theory have stood for\nmany years as the standard techniques for computing electronic states in\ncrystalline solids. Here we present the first new method in decades, which we\ncall atomistic $k\\cdot p$ theory. In its usual formulation, $k\\cdot p$ theory\nhas the advantage of depending on parameters that are directly related to\nexperimentally measured quantities, however it is insensitive to the locations\nof individual atoms. We construct an atomistic $k\\cdot p$ theory by defining\nenvelope functions on a grid matching the crystal lattice. The model parameters\nare matrix elements which are obtained from experimental results or {\\it ab\ninitio} wave functions in a simple way. This is in contrast to the other\natomistic approaches in which parameters are fit to reproduce a desired\ndispersion and are not expressible in terms of fundamental quantities. This\nfitting is often very difficult. We illustrate our method by constructing a\nfour-band atomistic model for a diamond/zincblende crystal and show that it is\nequivalent to the $sp^3$ tight-binding model. We can thus directly derive the\nparameters in the $sp^3$ tight-binding model from experimental data. We then\ntake the atomistic limit of the widely used eight-band Kane model and compute\nthe band structures for all III-V semiconductors not containing nitrogen or\nboron using parameters fit to experimental data. Our new approach extends\n$k\\cdot p$ theory to problems in which atomistic precision is required, such as\nimpurities, alloys, polytypes, and interfaces. It also provides a new approach\nto multiscale modeling by allowing continuum and atomistic $k\\cdot p$ models to\nbe combined in the same system.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating the principal components of a\npopulation correlation matrix from a limited number of measurement data. Using\na combination of random matrix and information-theoretic tools, we show that\nall the eigenmodes of the sample correlation matrices are informative, and not\nonly the top ones. We show how this information can be exploited when prior\ninformation about the principal component, such as whether it is localized or\nnot, is available by mapping the estimation problem onto the search for the\nground state of a spin-glass-like effective Hamiltonian encoding the prior.\nResults are illustrated numerically on the spiked covariance model.\n", "  We study the variation of word frequencies in Russian literary texts. Our\nfindings indicate that the standard deviation of a word's frequency across\ntexts depends on its average frequency according to a power law with exponent\n$0.62,$ showing that the rarer words have a relatively larger degree of\nfrequency volatility (i.e., \"burstiness\").\n  Several latent factors models have been estimated to investigate the\nstructure of the word frequency distribution. The dependence of a word's\nfrequency volatility on its average frequency can be explained by the asymmetry\nin the distribution of latent factors.\n", "  We investigate the evolutionary aspects of some integrable soliton models\nwhose Lagrangians are derived from the pullback of a volume-form to a\ntwo-dimensional target space. These models are known to have infinitely many\nconserved quantities and support various types of exact analytic solutions with\nnontrivial topology. In particular, we show that, in spite of the fact that\nthey admit nice smooth solutions, wave propagation about these solutions will\nalways be ill-posed. This is related to the fact that the corresponding\nEuler-Lagrange equations are not of hyperbolic type.\n", "  We propose that detailed data on the star formation history of a dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy (dSph) may be used to estimate the evolution of the total\nmass M_g(t) for cold gas in its star-forming disk. Using Fornax as an\nillustrative example, we estimate its M_g(t) and the corresponding net gas flow\nrate Delta F(t) assuming a global star formation rate psi(t) =\nlambda_*(t)[M_g(t)/M_sun]^alpha consistent with observations of nearby\ngalaxies. We identify the onset of the transition in Delta F(t) from a net\ninflow to a net outflow as the time t_sat at which the Fornax halo became a\nMilky Way satellite and estimate the evolution of its total mass M_h(t) at t <\nt_sat using the median halo growth history in the LambdaCDM cosmology and its\npresent mass within the half-light radius derived from observations. We examine\nthree different cases of alpha = 1, 1.5, and 2, and justify the corresponding\nlambda_*(t) by comparing the gas mass fraction f_g(t) = M_g(t)/M_h(t) at t <\nt_sat with results from simulations of gas accretion by halos in a reionized\nuniverse. We find that the Fornax halo grew to M_h(t_sat) ~ 2x10^9 M_sun at\nt_sat ~ 5 or 8 Gyr, in broad agreement with previous studies using data on its\nstellar kinematics and its orbital motion. We describe qualitatively the\nevolution of Fornax as a satellite and discuss potential extension of our\napproach to other dSphs.\n", "  Synchronization of networked oscillators is known to depend fundamentally on\nthe interplay between the dynamics of the graph's units and the microscopic\narrangement of the network's structure. For non identical elements, the lack of\nquantitative tools has hampered so far a systematic study of the mechanisms\nbehind such a collective behavior. We here propose an effective network whose\ntopological properties reflect the interplay between the topology and dynamics\nof the original network. On that basis, we are able to introduce the\n\"synchronization centrality\", a measure which quantifies the role and\nimportance of each network's node in the synchronization process. In\nparticular, we use such a measure to assess the propensity of a graph to\nsynchronize explosively, thus indicating a unified framework for most of the\ndifferent models proposed so far for such an irreversible transition. Taking\nadvantage of the predicting power of this measure, we furthermore discuss a\nstrategy to induce the explosive behavior in a generic network, by acting only\nupon a small fraction of its nodes.\n", "  Entropy has been a common index to quantify the complexity of time series in\na variety of fields. Here, we introduce increment entropy to measure the\ncomplexity of time series in which each increment is mapped into a word of two\nletters, one letter corresponding to direction and the other corresponding to\nmagnitude. The Shannon entropy of the words is termed as increment entropy\n(IncrEn). Simulations on synthetic data and tests on epileptic EEG signals have\ndemonstrated its ability of detecting the abrupt change, regardless of\nenergetic (e.g. spikes or bursts) or structural changes. The computation of\nIncrEn does not make any assumption on time series and it can be applicable to\narbitrary real-world data.\n", "  We analyze new possible applications of the trapping mechanism of\nsufficiently slow-speed particles by an electromagnetic potential well\ndeepening with time (up to a certain limit) which was recently established by\nauthor from basic relations of classical mechanics. It is assumed that given\nparticles are under conditions of the high vacuum and forces acting on these\nparticles are not dissipative. Such wells may be created by means of an\nelectromagnetic field (in particular radiation) with a fixed spatial\ndistribution but with a nondecreasing strength in time. Trapping and\nlocalization of particles in such electromagnetic traps are analyzed on example\nof typical laser beams. Obtained results may be used in high resolution\nspectroscopy of various particles (including also atoms and molecules in\ndefinite cases).\n", "  The D-brane superpotential is very important in the low energy effective\ntheory. As the generating function of all disk instantons from the worldsheet\npoint of view, it plays a crucial role in deriving some important properties of\nthe compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. By using the GKZ-generalized hypergeometric\nsystem, we will calculate the B-brane superpotentials of two non-fermat type\ncompact Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties,respectively. Then\naccording to the mirror symmetry, we obtain the A-model superpotentials and the\nOoguri-Vafa invariants for the mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n", "  We derive anomalous equations of state for nonrelativistic 2D complex bosonic\nfields with contact interactions, using Fujikawa's path-integral approach to\nanomalies and scaling arguments. In the process, we derive an anomalous virial\ntheorem for such systems. The methods used are easily generalizable for other\n2D systems, including fermionic ones, and of different spatial dimensionality,\nall of which share a classical $SO(2,1)$ Schrodinger symmetry. The discussion\nis of a more formal nature and is intended mainly to shed light on the\nstructure of anomalies in 2D many-body systems. The anomaly corrections to the\nvirial theorem and equation of state - pressure relationship - may be\nidentified as the Tan contact term. The practicality of these ideas rests upon\nbeing able to compute in detail the Fujikawa Jacobian that contains the\nanomaly. This and other conceptual issues, as well as some recent developments,\nare discussed at the end of the paper.\n", "  This is a short review of methods and results of calculations of fission\nbarriers and fission half-lives of even-even superheavy nuclei. An approvable\nagreement of the following approaches is shown and discussed: The\nmacroscopic-microscopic approach based on the stratagem of the shell correction\nto the liquid drop model and a vantage point of microscopic energy density\nfunctionals of Skyrme and Gogny type selfconsistently calculated within\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method. Mass parameters are calculated in the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov cranking approximation. A short part of the paper is\ndevoted to the nuclear fission dynamics. We also discuss the predictive power\nof Skyrme functionals applied to key properties of the fission path of\n$^{266}$Hs. It applies the standard techniques of error estimates in the\nframework of a $\\chi^2$ analysis.\n", "  Discretizing an analytic function on a uniform real-space grid is often done\nvia a straightforward collocation method. This is ubiquitous in all areas of\ncomputational physics and quantum chemistry. An example in Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) is given by the external potential or the pseudo-potential\ndescribing the interaction between ions and electrons. The accuracy of the\ncollocation method used is therefore very important for the reliability of\nsubsequent treatments like self-consistent field solutions of the electronic\nstructure problems. By construction, the collocation method introduces\nnumerical artifacts typical of real-space treatments, like the so-called\negg-box error, that may spoil the numerical stability of the description when\nthe real-space grid is too coarse. As the external potential is an input of the\nproblem, even a highly precise computational treatment cannot cope this\ninconvenience. We present in this paper a new quadrature scheme that is able to\nexactly preserve the moments of a given analytic function even for large grid\nspacings, while reconciling with the traditional collocation method when the\ngrid spacing is small enough. In the context of real-space electronic structure\ncalculations, we show that this method improves considerably the stability of\nthe results for large grid spacings, opening the path towards reliable\nlow-accuracy DFT calculations with reduced number of degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this article we investigate the Fresnel diffraction characteristics of the\nhybrid optical element which is a combination of a spiral phase plate (SPP)\nwith topological charge p and a thin lens with focal length f, named the\nhelical lens (HL). As incident a Gaussian laser beam is treated, having its\nwaist a distance from the HL plane and its axis passing through the centre of\nthe HL. It is shown that the SPP introduces a phase singularity of p-th order\nto the incident beam, while the lens transforms the beam characteristic\nparameters. The output light beam is analyzed in detail: its characteristic\nparameters and focusing properties, amplitude and intensity distributions and\nthe vortex rings profiles and radii, at any z distance behind the HL plane, as\nwell as in the near and far field.\n", "  Creation of Cold Dark Matter (CCDM), in the context of Einstein Field\nEquations, leads to a negative creation pressure, which can be used to explain\nthe accelerated expansion of the Universe. Recently, it has been shown that the\ndynamics of expansion of such models can not be distinguished from the\nconcordance $\\Lambda$CDM model, even at higher orders in the evolution of\ndensity perturbations, leading at the so called \"dark degeneracy\". However,\ndepending on the form of the CDM creation rate, the inclusion of spatial\ncurvature leads to a different behavior of CCDM when compared to $\\Lambda$CDM,\neven at background level. With a simple form for the creation rate, namely,\n$\\Gamma\\propto\\frac{1}{H}$, we show that this model can be distinguished from\n$\\Lambda$CDM, provided the Universe has some amount of spatial curvature.\nObservationally, however, the current limits on spatial flatness from CMB\nindicate that neither of the models are significantly favored against the other\nby current data, at least in the background level.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism demands an initial adiabatic stage before an\nimpulse stage to have a frozen correlation length that generates topological\ndefects in a cooling phase transition. Here we study such a driven critical\ndynamics but with an initial condition that is near the critical point and that\nis far away from equilibrium. In this case, there is no initial adiabatic stage\nat all and thus adiabaticity is broken. However, we show that there again\nexists a finite length scale arising from the driving that divides the\nevolution into three stages. A relaxation--finite-time scaling--adiabatic\nscenario is then proposed in place of the adiabatic--impulse--adiabatic\nscenario of the original Kibble-Zurek mechanism. A unified scaling theory,\nwhich combines finite-time scaling with critical initial slip, is developed to\ndescribe the universal behavior and is confirmed with numerical simulations of\na two-dimensional classical Ising model.\n", "  We present a new model for calculating locomotion costs in breath-hold\ndivers. Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that\nthe diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,\nthe buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous\nstudies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which\nalternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case\nin mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these\nprolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy\ncost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare\nthem with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into\naccount the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion\ntransformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the\ncorresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them\nwith observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through\nneutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the\npresence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the\nbuoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy\ncost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,\n2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the\nenergy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model\nconfirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other\nbreath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for\nexample). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of\noptimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings\n(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal\nspeed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can\nbe further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers\nclose to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for\nthe observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive\nenergy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a\nreduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n", "  We study the static behavior of a gas of atoms held in a one-dimensional\nlattice where two distinct electronically high-lying Rydberg states are\nsimultaneously excited by laser light. We focus on a situation where\ninteractions of van-der-Waals type take place only among atoms that are in the\nsame Rydberg state. We analytically investigate at first the so-called\nclassical limit of vanishing laser driving strength. We show that the system\nexhibits a surprisingly complex ground state structure with a sequence of\ncompatible to incompatible transitions. The incompatibility between the species\nleads to mutual frustration, a feature which pertains also in the quantum\nregime. We perform an analytical and numerical investigation of these features\nand present an approximative description of the system in terms of a\nRokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonian which permits the analytical understanding of the\nfrustration effects even beyond the classical limit.\n", "  We propose a method for tailoring the frequency spectrum of bright squeezed\nvacuum by generating it in a nonlinear interferometer, consisting of two\ndown-converting nonlinear crystals separated by a dispersive medium. Due to a\nfaster dispersive spreading of higher-order Schmidt modes, the spectral width\nof the radiation at the output is reduced as the length of the dispersive\nmedium is increased. Preliminary results show 30\\% spectral narrowing.\n", "  Constituents of complex systems interact with each other and self-organize to\nform complex networks. Empirical results show that the link formation process\nof many real networks follows either the global principle of popularity or the\nlocal principle of similarity or a tradeoff between the two. In particular, it\nhas been shown that in social networks individuals exhibit significant\nhomophily when choosing their collaborators. We demonstrate, however, that in\npopulations in which there is a division of labor, skill complementarity is an\nimportant factor in the formation of socioeconomic networks and an individual's\nchoice of collaborators is strongly affected by heterophily. We analyze 124\nevolving virtual worlds of a popular \"massively multiplayer online role-playing\ngame\" (MMORPG) in which people belong to three different professions and are\nallowed to work and interact with each other in a somewhat realistic manner. We\nfind evidence of heterophily in the formation of collaboration networks, where\npeople prefer to forge social ties with people who have professions different\nfrom their own. We then construct an economic model to quantify the heterophily\nby assuming that individuals in socioeconomic systems choose collaborators that\nare of maximum utility. The results of model calibration confirm the presence\nof heterophily. Both empirical analysis and model calibration show that the\nheterophilous feature is persistent along the evolution of virtual worlds. We\nalso find that the degree of complementarity in virtual societies is positively\ncorrelated with their economic output. Our work sheds new light on the\nscientific research utility of virtual worlds for studying human behaviors in\ncomplex socioeconomic systems.\n", "  We present a comprehensive approach to the dynamics of heavy quarks in a\nquark gluon plasma, including the possibility of bound state formation and\ndissociation. In this exploratory paper, we restrict ourselves to the case of\nan Abelian plasma, but the extension of the techniques used to the non Abelian\ncase is straightforward. A chain of well defined approximations leads\neventually to a generalized Langevin equation, where the force and the noise\nterms are determined from a correlation function of the equilibrium plasma, and\ndepend explicitly on the configuration of the heavy quarks. We solve the\nLangevin equation for various initial conditions, various numbers of heavy\nquark-antiquark pairs, and various temperatures of the plasma. Results of\nsimulations illustrate various expected phenomena: dissociation of bound states\nas a result of combined effects of screening of the potential and collisions\nwith the plasma constituent, formation of bound pairs (recombination) that\noccurs when enough heavy quarks are present in the system.\n", "  We present a high order, Fourier penalty method for the Maxwell's equations\nin the vicinity of perfect electric conductor boundary conditions. The approach\nrelies on extending the smooth non-periodic domain of the equations to a\nperiodic domain by removing the exact boundary conditions and introducing an\nanalytic forcing term in the extended domain. The forcing, or penalty term is\nchosen to systematically enforce the boundary conditions to high order in the\npenalty parameter, which then allows for higher order numerical methods. We\npresent an efficient numerical method for constructing the penalty term, and\ndiscretize the resulting equations using a Fourier spectral method. We\ndemonstrate convergence orders of up to 3.5 for the one-dimensional Maxwell's\nequations, and show that the numerical method does not suffer from dispersion\n(or pollution) errors. We also illustrate the approach in two dimensions and\ndemonstrate convergence orders of 2.5 for transverse magnetic modes and 1.5 for\nthe transverse electric modes. We conclude the paper with numerous test cases\nin dimensions two and three including waves traveling in an irregular\nwaveguide, and scattering off of a windmill-like geometry.\n", "  A power allocation to active and reactive power in stochastic resonance is\ndiscussed for energy harvesting from mechanical noise. It is confirmed that\nactive power can be increased at stochastic resonance, in the same way of the\nrelationship between energy and phase at an appropriate setting in resonance.\n", "  Empirical networks of weighted dyadic relations often contain noisy edges\nthat alter the global characteristics of the network and obfuscate the most\nimportant structures therein. Graph pruning is the process of identifying the\nmost significant edges according to a generative null model, and extracting the\nsubgraph consisting of those edges. Here, we focus on integer-weighted graphs\ncommonly arising when weights count the occurrences of an \"event\" relating the\nnodes. We introduce a simple and intuitive null model related to the\nconfiguration model of network generation, and derive two significance filters\nfrom it: the Marginal Likelihood Filter (MLF) and the Global Likelihood Filter\n(GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each\nedge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights whereas the latter is\nan ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We\napply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports\nand recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore,\ncompared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters\nextract a larger and significantly sparser giant component.\n", "  Quantum simulation methods based on density-functional theory are currently\ndeemed unfit to cope with atomic heat transport within the Green-Kubo\nformalism, because quantum-mechanical energy densities and currents are\ninherently ill-defined at the atomic scale. We show that, while this difficulty\nwould also affect classical simulations, thermal conductivity is indeed\ninsensitive to such ill-definedness by virtue of a sort of gauge invariance\nresulting from energy extensivity and conservation. Based on these findings, we\nderive an expression for the adiabatic energy flux from density-functional\ntheory, which allows heat transport to be simulated using ab-initio equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics. Our methodology is demonstrated by comparing its\npredictions with those of classical equilibrium and ab-initio non-equilibrium\n(M\\\"uller-Plathe) simulations for a liquid-Argon model, and finally applied to\nheavy water at ambient conditions.\n", "  The cosmic microwave background can measure the inflaton potential only if\ninflation lasts sufficiently long before the time of horizon crossing of\nobservable fluctuations, such that non-linear effects in the time evolution of\nGreen's functions lead to a loss of memory of initial conditions for the\nultraviolet tail of the spectrum. Within a derivative expansion of the quantum\neffective action for an interacting scalar field we discuss the most general\nsolution for the correlation function, including arbitrary pure and mixed\nquantum states. In this approximation no loss of memory occurs - cosmic\nmicrowave observations see the initial spectrum at the beginning of inflation,\nprocessed only mildly by the scale-violating effects at horizon crossing\ninduced by the inflaton potential.\n", "  The dual harmonic system has been widely used in high intensity proton\nsynchrotrons to suppress the space charge effect, as well as reduce the beam\nloss. To investigate the longitudinal beam dynamics in the dual rf system, the\npotential well, the sub-buckets in the bunch and the multi-solutions of the\nphase equation have been studied theoretically. Based on these theoretical\nstudis, the optimization of bunching factor and rf voltage waveform are made\nfor the dual harmonic rf system in the upgrade phase of the CSNS/RCS. In the\noptimization process, the simulation with space charge effect is done by using\na newly developed code C-SCSIM.\n", "  Entanglement distillation refers to the task of transforming a collection of\nweakly entangled pairs into fewer highly entangled ones. It is a core\ningredient in quantum repeater protocols, needed to transmit entanglement over\narbitrary distances in order to realise quantum key distribution schemes.\nUsually, it is assumed that the initial entangled pairs are i.i.d. distributed\nand uncorrelated with each other, an assumption that might not be reasonable at\nall in any entanglement generation process involving memory channels. Here, we\nintroduce a framework that captures entanglement distillation in the presence\nof natural correlations arising from memory channels. Conceptually, we bring\ntogether ideas from condensed-matter physics - that of renormalisation and of\nmatrix-product states and operators - with those of local entanglement\nmanipulation, Markov chain mixing, and quantum error correction. We identify\nmeaningful parameter regions for which we prove convergence to maximally\nentangled states, arising as the fixed points of a matrix-product operator\nrenormalisation flow.\n", "  A generalized macroscopic nonlocal theory of sound propagation in\nrigid-framed porous media saturated with a viscothermal fluid has been recently\nproposed, which takes into account both temporal and spatial dispersion. Here,\nwe consider applying this theory capable to describe resonance effects, to the\ncase of sound propagation through an array of Helmholtz resonators whose\nunusual metamaterial properties such as negative bulk moduli, have been\nexperimentally demonstrated. Three different calculations are performed,\nvalidating the results of the nonlocal theory, relating to the\nfrequency-dependent Bloch wavenumber and bulk modulus of the first normal mode,\nfor 1D propagation in 2D or 3D periodic structures.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs particle at 125 GeV is demanding a detailed\nknowledge of the properties of this fundamental component of the Standard\nModel. To that aim various proposals of electron and muon colliders have been\nput forward for precision studies of the partial widths of the various decay\nchannels. It is shown that in the case of a Higgs factory through a muon\ncollider, sizeable radiative effects - of order of 50% - must be carefully\ntaken into account for a precise measurement of the leptonic and total widths\nof the Higgs particle. Similar effects do not apply in the case of Higgs\nproduction in electron-positron colliders.\n", "  Generation of anomalously energetic suprathermal electrons was observed in\nsimulation of a high- voltage dc discharge with electron emission from the\ncathode. An electron beam produced by the emission interacts with the\nnonuniform plasma in the discharge via a two-stream instability. Efficient\nenergy transfer from the beam to the plasma electrons is ensured by the plasma\nnonuniformity. The electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and\nphase speed gradually decrease towards anode. The short waves near the anode\naccelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies. The sheath near the\nanode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma. These\nelectrons travel through the plasma, reflect near the cathode, and enter the\naccelerating area again but with a higher energy than before. Such particles\nare accelerated to energies much higher than after the first acceleration. This\nmechanism plays a role in explaining earlier experimental observations of\nenergetic suprathermal electrons in similar discharges.\n", "  In this paper we present an experiment where we measured the quantum\ncoherence of a quasiparticle injected at a well-defined energy above the Fermi\nsea into the edge states of the integer quantum Hall regime. Electrons are\nintroduced in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer after passing through a\nquantum dot that plays the role of an energy filter. Measurements show that\nabove a threshold injection energy, the visibility of the quantum interferences\nis almost independent of the energy. This is true even for high energies, up to\n130~$\\mu$eV, well above the thermal energy of the measured sample. This result\nis in strong contradiction with our theoretical predictions, which instead\npredict a continuous decrease of the interference visibility with increasing\nenergy. This experiment raises serious questions concerning the understanding\nof excitations in the integer quantum Hall regime.\n", "  We dimensionally reduce the bosonic sector of 10D Euclidean type IIA\nsupergravity over a Calabi-Yau three-fold. The resulting theory describes the\nbosonic sector of 4D, N = 2 Euclidean supergravity coupled to vector- and\nhyper-multiplets.\n  We show that the scalar target manifold of the vector-multiplets is\nprojective special para-Kahler, and is therefore of split signature, whereas\nthe target manifold of the hyper-multiplets is (positive-definite) quaternionic\nKahler.\n", "  For an exact quantitative description of spectral properties of synchrotron\nradiation (SR), the concept of effective width of the spectrum is introduced.\nIn the most interesting case, which corresponds to the ultrarelativistic limit\nof SR, the effective width of the spectrum is calculated for the polarization\ncomponents, and new physically important quantitative information on the\nstructure of spectral distributions is obtained. For the first time, the\nspectral distribution for the circular polarization component of the SR for the\nupper half-space is obtained within classical theory.\n", "  The existence of Dark Matter (DM) in the form of Strongly Interacting Massive\nParticles (SIMPs) may be motivated by astrophysical observations that challenge\nthe classical Cold DM scenario. Other observations greatly constrain, but do\nnot completely exclude, the SIMP alternative. The signature of SIMPs at the LHC\nmay consist of neutral, hadron-like, trackless jets produced in pairs. We show\nthat the absence of charged content can provide a very efficient tool to\nsuppress dijet backgrounds at the LHC, thus enhancing the sensitivity to a\npotential SIMP signal. We illustrate this using a simplified SIMP model and\npresent a detailed feasibility study based on simulations, including a\ndedicated detector response parametrization. We evaluate the expected\nsensitivity to various signal scenarios and tentatively consider the exclusion\nlimits on the SIMP elastic cross section with nucleons.\n", "  Hybrid structures synthesized from different materials have attracted\nconsiderable attention because they may allow not only combination of the\nfunctionalities of the individual constituents but also mutual control of their\nproperties. To obtain such a control an interaction between the components\nneeds to be established. For coupling the magnetic properties, an exchange\ninteraction has to be implemented which typically depends on wave function\noverlap and is therefore short-ranged, so that it may be compromised across the\ninterface. Here we study a hybrid structure consisting of a ferromagnetic\nCo-layer and a semiconducting CdTe quantum well, separated by a thin (Cd,Mg)Te\nbarrier. In contrast to the expected p-d exchange that decreases exponentially\nwith the wave function overlap of quantum well holes and magnetic Co atoms, we\nfind a long-ranged, robust coupling that does not vary with barrier width up to\nmore than 10 nm. We suggest that the resulting spin polarization of the holes\nis induced by an effective p-d exchange that is mediated by elliptically\npolarized phonons.\n", "  In this note we compute the expectation value of a circular BPS Wilson loop\nin the higher rank totally symmetric and antisymmetric representations of SU(N)\nin the $\\hat{A}_1$ quiver $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFT, using a matrix model. We\ndiscuss the connection with a recent conjecture stating that expectation values\nof observables in this sector are obtained from $\\mathcal{N = 4}$ SYM by a\nuniversal renormalization of the `t Hooft coupling.\n", "  A class of models of dark sectors consider new very weak interaction between\nthe ordinary and dark matter transmitted by U'(1) gauge bosons A' (dark\nphotons) mixing with our photons. If such A's exist, they could be searched for\nin a light-shining-through-a-wall experiment with a high energy electron beam\nfrom the CERN SPS. The proposed search scheme suggests detection of the e+e-\npairs produced in the A' -> e+e- decay with a very small opening angle.\nCoordinate chambers based on the thin-wall drift tubes with a minimal material\nbudget and a two-hit resolution for e+ and e- tracks separated by more than 0.5\nmm are considered as an option for detecting such pairs.\n", "  Although the inflationary paradigm is the most widely accepted explanation\nfor the current cosmological observations, it does not necessarily correspond\nto what actually happened in the early stages of our Universe. To decide on\nthis issue, two paths can be followed: first, all the possible predictions it\nmakes must be derived thoroughly and compared with available data, and second,\nall imaginable alternatives must be ruled out. Leaving the first task to all\nother contributors of this volume, we concentrate here on the second option,\nfocusing on the bouncing alternatives and their consequences.\n", "  The cosmological models called $\\alpha$-attractors provide an excellent fit\nto the latest observational data. Their predictions $n_{s} = 1-2/N$ and $r =\n12\\alpha/N^{2}$ are very robust with respect to the modifications of the\ninflaton potential. An intriguing interpretation of $\\alpha$-attractors is\nbased on a geometric moduli space with a boundary: a Poincare disk model of a\nhyperbolic geometry with the radius $\\sqrt{3\\alpha}$, beautifully represented\nby the Escher's picture Circle Limit IV. In such models, the amplitude of the\ngravitational waves is proportional to the square of the radius of the Poincare\ndisk.\n", "  In the study of the capacity problem for multiple access channels (MACs), a\nlower bound on the error probability obtained by Han plays a crucial role in\nthe converse parts of several kinds of channel coding theorems in the\ninformation-spectrum framework. Recently, Yagi and Oohama showed a tighter\nbound than the Han bound by means of Polyanskiy's converse. In this paper, we\ngive a new bound which generalizes and strengthens the Yagi-Oohama bound, and\ndemonstrate that the bound plays a fundamental role in deriving extensions of\nseveral known bounds. In particular, the Yagi-Oohama bound is generalized to\ntwo different directions; i.e, to general input distributions and to general\nencoders. In addition we extend these bounds to the quantum MACs and apply them\nto the converse problems for several information-spectrum settings.\n", "  The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy of crystalline color superconductors is\nimportant for understanding the nature of the phase transition to the normal\nquark matter and predicting the preferred crystal structure. So far the GL free\nenergy at zero temperature has only been evaluated up to the sixth order in the\ncondensate. To give quantitative reliable predictions we need to evaluate the\nhigher-order terms. In this work, we present a new derivation of the GL free\nenergy by using the discrete Bloch representation of the fermion field. This\nderivation introduces a simple matrix formalism without any momentum\nconstraint, which may enable us to calculate the GL free energy to arbitrary\norder by using a computer.\n", "  In the presence of a magnetic field and an external periodic potential, the\nLandau level spectrum of a two-dimensional electron gas exhibits a fractal\npattern in the energy spectrum which is described as the Hofstadter's\nbutterfly. In this work, we develop a Hartree-Fock theory to deal with the\nelectron-electron interaction in the Hofstadter's butterfly state in a\nfinite-size graphene with periodic boundary conditions, in which we include\nboth spin and valley degrees of freedom. We then treat the butterfly state as\nan electron crystal so that we could obtain the order parameters of the crystal\nin the momentum space and also in an infinite sample. The excitation gaps\nobtained in the infinite sample is comparable to those in the finite-size\nstudy, and agree with a recent experimental observation.\n", "  Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) may be broken in superconductors with three or\nmore condensates interacting repulsively, yielding two degenerate states\nspecified by chirality of gap functions. We consider a loop of such\nsuperconductor with two halves occupied by the two states with opposite\nchiralities. Fractional flux plateaus are found in magnetization curve\nassociated with free-energy minima, where the two domain walls between the two\nhalves accommodate different inter-component phase kinks leading to finite\nwinding numbers in a part of the whole condensates around the loop. Fractional\nflux plateaus form pairs with their heights related to the flux quantum {\\Phi}0\n= hc/2e. This phenomenon is a clear evidence of time-reversal symmetry broken\n(TRSB) superconductivity, which in a general point of view provides a novel\nchance to explore relative phase difference, phase kink and soliton in\nubiquitous multi-component superconductivity such as that in iron pnicitides.\n", "  We present a possible explanation for the deep sub-threshold, $\\phi$ and\n$\\Xi^-$ production yields measured with the HADES experiment in Ar+KCl\nreactions at $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.76$ A GeV and present predictions for Au+Au\nreactions at $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.23$ A GeV. To explain the surprisingly high\nyields of $\\phi$ and $\\Xi^-$ hadrons we propose new decay channels for high\nmass baryon resonances. These new decay channels are constrained by elementary\n$\\mathrm{p+p}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{p+p+}\\phi$ cross sections, and $\\Xi^-$\nproduction in p+Nb. Based on the fits to the elementary reactions one obtains a\nsatisfactorily description of $\\phi$ and $\\Xi^-$ production in deep\nsub-threshold Ar+KCl reactions as well as the observed nuclear transparency\nratio in proton induced $\\phi$ production in cold nuclear matter. The results\nimplicate that no new medium effects are required to describe the rare strange\nparticle production data in low energy nuclear collisions.\n", "  Electrically driven single-photon emitting devices have immediate\napplications in quantum cryptography, quantum computation and single-photon\nmetrology. Mature device fabrication protocols and the recent observations of\nsingle defect systems with quantum functionalities make silicon carbide (SiC)\nan ideal material to build such devices. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication\nof bright single photon emitting diodes. The electrically driven emitters\ndisplay fully polarized output, superior photon statistics (with a count rate\nof $>$300 kHz), and stability in both continuous and pulsed modes, all at room\ntemperature. The atomic origin of the single photon source is proposed. These\nresults provide a foundation for the large scale integration of single photon\nsources into a broad range of applications, such as quantum cryptography or\nlinear optics quantum computing.\n", "  The low-background, VUV-sensitive 3-inch diameter photomultiplier tube R11410\nhas been developed by Hamamatsu for dark matter direct detection experiments\nusing liquid xenon as the target material. We present the results from the\njoint effort between the XENON collaboration and the Hamamatsu company to\nproduce a highly radio-pure photosensor (version R11410-21) for the XENON1T\ndark matter experiment. After introducing the photosensor and its components,\nwe show the methods and results of the radioactive contamination measurements\nof the individual materials employed in the photomultiplier production. We then\ndiscuss the adopted strategies to reduce the radioactivity of the various PMT\nversions. Finally, we detail the results from screening 216 tubes with\nultra-low background germanium detectors, as well as their implications for the\nexpected electronic and nuclear recoil background of the XENON1T experiment.\n", "  The singular values squared of the random matrix product $Y = G_r G_{r-1}\n\\cdots G_1 (G_0 + A)$, where each $G_j$ is a rectangular standard complex\nGaussian matrix while $A$ is non-random, are shown to be a determinantal point\nprocess with correlation kernel given by a double contour integral. When all\nbut finitely many eigenvalues of $A^*A$ are equal to $bN$, the kernel is shown\nto admit a well-defined hard edge scaling, in which case a critical value is\nestablished and a phase transition phenomenon is observed. More specifically,\nthe limiting kernel in the subcritical regime of $0<b<1$ is independent of $b$,\nand is in fact the same as that known for the case $b=0$ due to Kuijlaars and\nZhang. The critical regime of $b=1$ allows for a double scaling limit by\nchoosing $b = (1-\\tau/\\sqrt{N})^{-1}$, and for this the critical kernel and\noutlier phenomenon are established. In the simplest case $r=0$, which is\nclosely related to non-intersecting squared Bessel paths, a distribution\ncorresponding to the finite shifted mean LUE is proven to be the scaling limit\nin the supercritical regime of $b>1$ with two distinct scaling rates. Similar\nresults also hold true for the random matrix product $T_r T_{r-1} \\cdots T_1\n(G_0 + A)$, with each $T_j$ being a truncated unitary matrix.\n", "  Our Sun, primarily composed of ionized hydrogen and helium, has a surface\ntemperature of 5777~K and a radius $R_\\odot \\approx 696,000$ km. In the outer\n$R_\\odot/3$, energy transport is accomplished primarily by convection. Using\ntypical convective velocities $u\\sim100\\,\\rm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and kinematic\nviscosities of order $10^{-4}$ m$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, we obtain a Reynolds number $Re\n\\sim 10^{14}$. Convection is thus turbulent, causing a vast range of scales to\nbe excited. The Prandtl number, $Pr$, of the convecting fluid is very low, of\norder $10^{-7}$\\,--\\,$10^{-4}$, so that the Rayleigh number ($\\sim Re^2 Pr$) is\non the order of $10^{21}\\,-\\,10^{24}$. Solar convection thus lies in\nextraordinary regime of dynamical parameters, highly untypical of fluid flows\non Earth. Convective processes in the Sun drive global fluid circulations and\nmagnetic fields, which in turn affect its visible outer layers (\"solar\nactivity\") and, more broadly, the heliosphere (\"space weather\"). The precise\ndetermination of the depth of solar convection zone, departures from\nadiabaticity of the temperature gradient, and the internal rotation rate as a\nfunction of latitude and depth are among the seminal contributions of\nhelioseismology towards understanding convection in the Sun. Contemporary\nhelioseismology, which is focused on inferring the properties of\nthree-dimensional convective features, suggests that transport velocities are\nsubstantially smaller than theoretical predictions. Furthermore,\nhelioseismology provides important constraints on the anisotropic Reynolds\nstresses that control the global dynamics of the solar convection zone. This\nreview discusses the state of our understanding of convection in the Sun, with\na focus on helioseismic diagnostics. We present our considerations with the\ninterests of fluid dynamicists in mind.\n", "  We determine the next-to-leading order renormalization group equations for\nthe Two-Higgs-Doublet model with a softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry and CP\nconservation in the scalar potential. We use them to identify the parameter\nregions which are stable up to the Planck scale and find that in this case the\nquartic couplings of the Higgs potential cannot be larger than 1 in magnitude\nand that the absolute values of the S-matrix eigenvalues cannot exceed 2.5 at\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking scale. Interpreting the 125 GeV resonance as\nthe light CP-even Higgs eigenstate, we combine stability constraints,\nelectroweak precision and flavour observables with the latest ATLAS and CMS\ndata on Higgs signal strengths and heavy Higgs searches in global parameter\nfits to all four types of $Z_2$ symmetry. We quantify the maximal deviations\nfrom the alignment limit and find that in type II and Y the mass of the heavy\nCP-even (CP-odd) scalar cannot be smaller than 340 GeV (360 GeV). Also, we\npinpoint the physical parameter regions compatible with a stable scalar\npotential up to the Planck scale. Motivated by the question how natural a Higgs\nmass of 125 GeV can be in the context of a Two-Higgs-Doublet model, we also\naddress the hierarchy problem and find that the Two-Higgs-Doublet model does\nnot offer a perturbative solution to it beyond 5 TeV.\n", "  The dynamics of fronts, such as chemical reaction fronts, propagating in\ntwo-dimensional fluid flows can be remarkably rich and varied. For\ntime-invariant flows, the front dynamics may simplify, settling in to a steady\nstate in which the reacted domain is static, and the front appears \"frozen\".\nOur central result is that these frozen fronts in the two-dimensional fluid are\ncomposed of segments of burning invariant manifolds---invariant manifolds of\nfront-element dynamics in $xy\\theta$-space, where $\\theta$ is the front\norientation. Burning invariant manifolds (BIMs) have been identified previously\nas important local barriers to front propagation in fluid flows. The relevance\nof BIMs for frozen fronts rests in their ability, under appropriate conditions,\nto form global barriers, separating reacted domains from nonreacted domains for\nall time. The second main result of this paper is an understanding of\nbifurcations that lead from a nonfrozen state to a frozen state, as well as\nbifurcations that change the topological structure of the frozen front. Though\nthe primary results of this study apply to general fluid flows, our analysis\nfocuses on a chain of vortices in a channel flow with an imposed wind. For this\nsystem, we present both experimental and numerical studies that support the\ntheoretical analysis developed here.\n", "  It is demonstrated here that growth stress has a substantial effect on the\ndielectric constant of zirconia thin films. The correct combination of\nparameters - phase, texture and stress - is shown to yield films with high\ndielectric constant and best reported equivalent oxide thickness of 0.8 nm. The\nstress effect on dielectric constant is twofold, firstly, by the effect on\nphase transitions and secondly by the effect on interatomic distances. We\ndiscuss and explain the physical mechanisms involved in the interplay between\nthe stress, phase changes and the dielectric constant in detail.\n", "  Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation is the most important numerical tool in\nplasma physics. However, its long-term accuracy has not been established. To\novercome this difficulty, we developed a canonical symplectic PIC method for\nthe Vlasov-Maxwell system by discretizing its canonical Poisson bracket. A fast\nlocal algorithm to solve the symplectic implicit time advance is discovered\nwithout root searching or global matrix inversion, enabling applications of the\nproposed method to very large-scale plasma simulations with many, e.g.,\n$10^{9}$, degrees of freedom. The long-term accuracy and fidelity of the\nalgorithm enables us to numerically confirm Mouhot and Villani's theory and\nconjecture on nonlinear Landau damping over several orders of magnitude using\nthe PIC method, and to calculate the nonlinear evolution of the reflectivity\nduring the mode conversion process from extraordinary waves to Bernstein waves.\n", "  We review the ubiquitous presence in multiparticle production processes of\nquasi-power law distributions (i.e., distributions following pure power laws\nfor large values of the argument but remaining finite, usually exponential, for\nsmall values). Special emphasis is placed on the conjecture that this reflects\nthe presence in the produced hadronic systems of some intrinsic fluctuations.\nIf described by parameter q they form, together with the scale parameter $T$\n(\"temperature\"), basis of Tsallis distribution, ${f(X)\\sim [1 -\n(1-q)X/T]^{1/(1-q)}}$, frequently used to describe the relevant distributions\n(the X being usually a transverse momentum). We discuss the origin of such\nquasi-power law behavior based on our experience with the description of\nmultiparticle production processes. In particular, we discuss Tsallis\ndistribution with complex nonextensivity parameter q and argue that it is\nneeded to describe log-oscillations as apparently observed in recent data on\nlarge momentum distributions in very high energy p-p collisions.\n", "  We have carried out dc magnetization (M), heat-capacity (C) and dielectric\nstudies down to 2K for the compound GdCrTiO5, crystallizing in orthorhombic\nPbam structure, in which well-known multiferroics RMn2O5 (R= Rare-earths) form.\nThe points of emphasis are: (i) The magnetic ordering temperature of Cr appears\nto be suppressed compared to that in isostructural Nd counterpart, NdCrTiO5,\nfor which the Neel temperature is about 21 K. This finding on the Gd compound\nsuggests that Nd 4f orbital plays a role on the magnetism of Cr in contrast to\na proposal long ago. (ii) Dielectric constant does not exhibit any notable\nfeature below about 30 K in the absence of external magnetic field, but a peak\nappears and gets stronger with the application of external magnetic fields,\nsupporting the existence of magnetodielectric coupling. (iii) The dielectric\nanomalies appear even near 100 K, which can be attributed to short-range\nmagnetic-order. We also observe a gain in spectral weight below about 150 K in\nRaman spectra in the frequency range 150 to 400 cm-1, which could be magnetic\nin origin supporting short-range magnetic order. It is of interest to explore\nwhether geometrically frustration plays any role on the dielectric properties\nof this family, as in the case of RMn2O5.\n", "  We present a versatile scheme for creating topological Bogoliubov excitations\nin weakly interacting bosonic systems. Our proposal relies on a background\nstationary field that consists of a Kagome vortex lattice, which breaks\ntime-reversal symmetry and induces a periodic potential for Bogoliubov\nexcitations. In analogy to the Haldane model, no external magnetic field or net\nflux is required. We construct a generic model based on the two-dimensional\n(2D) nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and demonstrate the emergence of\ntopological gaps crossed by chiral Bogoliubov edge modes. Our scheme can be\nrealized in a wide variety of physical systems ranging from nonlinear optical\nsystems to exciton-polariton condensates.\n", "  The complete spectrum of plasmons of the two interpenetrating plasma streams\nis found in a closed analytic form. The orientation of the wave vector with\nrespect to the stream direction is arbitrary and the plasmas, which are assumed\nto be collisionless and spatially homogeneous, can be nonrelativistic,\nrelativistic or even ultrarelativistic. Our results apply to the\nelectromagnetic plasma of electrons and passive ions and to the quark-gluon\nplasma governed by QCD.\n", "  New results for the double spin asymmetry $A_1^{\\rm p}$ and the proton\nlongitudinal spin structure function $g_1^{\\rm p}$ are presented. They were\nobtained by the COMPASS collaboration using polarised 200 GeV muons scattered\noff a longitudinally polarised NH$_3$ target. The data were collected in 2011\nand complement those recorded in 2007 at 160\\,GeV, in particular at lower\nvalues of $x$. They improve the statistical precision of $g_1^{\\rm p}(x)$ by\nabout a factor of two in the region $x\\lesssim 0.02$. A next-to-leading order\nQCD fit to the $g_1$ world data is performed. It leads to a new determination\nof the quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin, $\\Delta \\Sigma$ ranging\nfrom 0.26 to 0.36, and to a re-evaluation of the first moment of $g_1^{\\rm p}$.\nThe uncertainty of $\\Delta \\Sigma$ is mostly due to the large uncertainty in\nthe present determinations of the gluon helicity distribution. A new evaluation\nof the Bjorken sum rule based on the COMPASS results for the non-singlet\nstructure function $g_1^{\\rm NS}(x,Q^2)$ yields as ratio of the axial and\nvector coupling constants $|g_{\\rm A}/g_{\\rm V}| = 1.22 \\pm 0.05~({\\rm stat.})\n\\pm 0.10~({\\rm syst.})$, which validates the sum rule to an accuracy of about\n9\\%.\n", "  TiZrV film is mainly applied in the ultra-high vacuum pipe of storage ring.\nThin film coatings of palladium which was added onto the TiZrV film to increase\nthe service life of nonevaporable getters and enhance pumping speed for H2, was\ndeposited on the inner face of stainless steel pipes by dc magnetron sputtering\nusing argon gas as the sputtering gas. The TiZrV-Pd film properties were\ninvestigated by atomic force microscope (AFM), scanning electron microscope\n(SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The\ngrain size of TiZrV and Pd film were about 0.42~1.3 nm and 8.5~18.25 nm\nrespectively. It was found that the roughness of TiZrV films was small, about\n2~4 nm, for Pd film it is large, about 17~19 nm. PP At. % of Pd in TiZrV/Pd\nfilms varied from 86.84 to 87.56 according to the XPS test results.\n", "  We study the near-threshold photoproduction of $\\eta^\\prime$ mesons from\nnuclei in coincidence with forward going protons in the kinematical conditions\nof the Crystal Barrel/TAPS experiment, recently performed at ELSA. The\ncalculations have been performed within a collision model based on the nuclear\nspectral function. The model accounts for both the primary ${\\gamma}p \\to\n{\\eta^\\prime}p$ process and the two-step intermediate nucleon rescattering\nprocesses as well as the effect of the nuclear $\\eta^\\prime$ mean-field\npotential. We calculate the exclusive $\\eta^\\prime$ kinetic energy\ndistributions for the $^{12}$C($\\gamma$, ${\\eta^\\prime}p$) reaction for\ndifferent scenarios of $\\eta^\\prime$ in-medium modification. We find that the\nconsidered two-step rescattering mechanism plays an insignificant role in\n${\\eta^\\prime}p$ photoproduction off the carbon target. We also demonstrate\nthat the calculated $\\eta^\\prime$ kinetic energy distributions in primary\nphoton--proton ${\\eta^\\prime}p$ production reveal strong sensitivity to the\ndepth of the real ${\\eta^\\prime}$ potential at normal nuclear matter density\n(or to the ${\\eta^\\prime}$ in-medium mass shift) in the studied incident photon\nenergy regime. Therefore, such observables may be useful to help determine the\nabove ${\\eta^\\prime}$ in-medium renormalization from the comparison of the\nresults of our calculations with the data from the CBELSA/TAPS experiment. In\naddition, we show that these distributions are also strongly influenced by the\nmomentum-dependent optical potential, which the outgoing participant proton\nfeels inside the carbon nucleus. This potential should be taken into account in\nthe analysis of these data with the aim to obtain information on the\n${\\eta^\\prime}$ modification in cold nuclear matter.\n", "  Signature change at high density has been obtained as a possible consequence\nof deformed space-time structures in models of loop quantum gravity. This\narticle provides a conceptual discussion of implications for cosmological\nscenarios, based on an application of mathematical results for mixed-type\npartial differential equations (the Tricomi problem). While the effective\nequations from which signature change has been derived are shown to be locally\nregular and therefore reliable, the underlying theory of loop quantum gravity\nmay face several global problems in its semiclassical solutions.\n", "  The curved space-time around current loops and solenoids carrying arbitrarily\nlarge steady electric currents is obtained from the numerical resolution of the\ncoupled Einstein-Maxwell equations in cylindrical symmetry. The artificial\ngravitational field associated to the generation of a magnetic field produces\ngravitational redshift of photons and deviation of light. Null geodesics in the\ncurved space-time of current loops and solenoids are also presented. We finally\npropose an experimental setup, achievable with current technology of\nsuperconducting coils, that produces a phase shift of light of the same order\nof magnitude than astrophysical signals in ground-based gravitational wave\nobservatories.\n", "  The paper by Landau and Lifshitz on vortex sheets in rotating superfluid\nappeared in 1955 almost at the same time when Feynman published his paper on\nquantized vortices in superfluid 4He. For a long time this paper has been\nconsidered as an error. But 40 years later the vortex sheets have been detected\nin chiral superfluid 3He-A in the rotating cryostat constructed in the Olli\nLounasmaa Low Temperature Laboratory (Otaniemi, Finland). The equation derived\nby Landau and Lifshits for the distance between the vortex sheets as a function\nof the angular velocity of rotation has been experimentally confirmed, which is\nthe triumph of the theory. We discuss different configurations of the vortex\nsheets observed and to be observed in superfluid 3He-A.\n", "  It is shown that the standard methods of computing excited states in\ntruncated spaces must yield wave functions that, beyond truncation, are in\nprinciple veered away from the exact, and a remedy is demonstrated via a\npresented functional, F$_n$, obeying a minimization principle for excited\nstates. It is further demonstrated that near avoided crossings, between two\nMCSCF 'flipped roots' the wave function that leads to the excited state has the\nlowest F$_n$.\n", "  This study examines Quaternion Dirac solutions for an infinite square well.\nThe quaternion result does not recover the complex result within a particular\nlimit. This raises the possibility that quaternionic quantum mechanics may not\nbe understood as a correction to complex quantum mechanics, but it may also be\na structure that can be used to study phenomena that cannot be described\nthrough the framework of complex quantum mechanics.\n", "  (Bi)multi-partite interaction patterns are commonly observed in real world\nsystems which have inhibitory and excitatory couplings. We hypothesize these\nstructural interaction pattern to be stable and naturally arising in the course\nof evolution. We demonstrate that a random structure evolves to the\n(bi)multi-partite structure by imposing stability criterion through\nminimization of the largest eigenvalue in the genetic algorithm devised on the\ninteracting units having inhibitory and excitatory couplings. The evolved\ninteraction patterns are robust against changes in the initial network\narchitecture as well as fluctuations in the interaction weights.\n", "  We consider the $X(3872)$ resonance as a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $D\\bar D^*$ hadronic\nmolecule. According to heavy quark spin symmetry, there will exist a partner\nwith quantum numbers $2^{++}$, $X_{2}$, which would be a $D^*\\bar D^*$ loosely\nbound state. The $X_{2}$ is expected to decay dominantly into $D\\bar D$, $D\\bar\nD^*$ and $\\bar D D^*$ in $d$-wave. In this work, we calculate the decay widths\nof the $X_{2}$ resonance into the above channels, as well as those of its\nbottom partner, $X_{b2}$, the mass of which comes from assuming heavy flavor\nsymmetry for the contact terms. We find partial widths of the $X_{2}$ and\n$X_{b2}$ of the order of a few MeV. Finally, we also study the radiative\n$X_2\\to D\\bar D^{*}\\gamma$ and $X_{b2} \\to \\bar B B^{*}\\gamma$ decays. These\ndecay modes are more sensitive to the long-distance structure of the resonances\nand to the $D\\bar D^{*}$ or $B\\bar B^{*}$ final state interaction.\n", "  We has set up a light scattering spectrometer to study the depolarization of\nlight scattering in linear alkylbenzene. From the scattering spectra it can be\nunambiguously shown that the depolarized part of light scattering belongs to\nRayleigh scattering. The additional depolarized Rayleigh scattering can make\nthe effective transparency of linear alkylbenzene much better than it was\nexpected. Therefore sufficient scintillation photons can transmit through the\nlarge liquid scintillator detector of JUNO. Our study is crucial to achieving\nthe unprecedented energy resolution 3\\%/$\\sqrt{E\\mathrm{(MeV)}}$ for JUNO\nexperiment to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy. The spectroscopic method\ncan also be used to judge the attribution of the depolarization of other\norganic solvents used in neutrino experiments.\n", "  The announcement by BICEP2 of the detection of B-mode polarization consistent\nwith primordial gravitational waves with a tensor-to-scalar ratio,\n$r=0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, challenged predictions from most inflationary models\nof a lower value for $r$. More recent results by Planck on polarized dust\nemission show that the observed tensor modes signal is compatible with pure\nforeground emission. A more significant constraint on $r$ was then obtained by\na joint analysis of Planck, BICEP2 and Keck Array data showing an upper limit\nto the tensor to scalar ratio $r\\le 0.12$, excluding the case $r=0$ with low\nstatistical significance. Forthcoming measurements by BICEP3, the Keck Array,\nand other CMB polarization experiments, open the possibility for making the\nfundamental measurement of $r$. Here we discuss how $r$ sets the scale for\nmodels where the dark matter is created at the inflationary epoch, the\ngenerically called super-heavy dark matter models. We also consider the\nconstraints on such scenarios given by recent data from ultrahigh energy cosmic\nray observatories which set the limit on super-heavy dark matter particles\nlifetime. We discuss how super-heavy dark matter can be discovered by a precise\nmeasurement of $r$ combined with future observations of ultra high energy\ncosmic rays.\n", "  The infinite dimensional half-filled Hubbard model can be mapped exactly with\nno additional constraint onto a model of free fermions coupled in a $Z_2$\ngauge-invariant manner to auxiliary Ising spins in a transverse field. In this\nslave-spin representation, the zero-temperature insulator-to-metal transition\ntranslates into spontaneous breaking of the local $Z_2$ gauge symmetry, which\nis not forbidden in infinite dimensions, thus endowing the Mott transition of\nan order parameter that is otherwise elusive in the original fermion\nrepresentation. We demonstrate this interesting scenario by exactly solving the\neffective spin-fermion model by dynamical mean-field theory both at zero and at\nfinite temperature.\n", "  When circularly polarized wave scatters off a sphere, the scattered field\nforms a vortex with spiraling energy flow. This is due to the transformation of\nspin angular momentum into orbital one. Here we demonstrate that during this\nscattering an anomalous force can be induced that acts in a direction\nperpendicular to the propagation of incident wave. The appearance of this\nlateral force is made possible by the presence of an interface in the vicinity\nof scattering object. Besides radiation pressure and tractor-beam pulling\nforces, this lateral force is another type of non-conservative force that can\nbe produced with unstructured light beams.\n", "  Magnetars are proposed to be peculiar neutron stars which could power their\nX-ray radiation by super-strong magnetic fields as high as $\\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G.\nHowever, no direct evidence for such strong fields is obtained till now, and\nthe recent discovery of low magnetic field magnetars even indicates that some\nmore efficient radiation mechanism than magnetic dipole radiation should be\nincluded. In this paper, quantum vacuum friction (QVF) is suggested to be a\ndirect consequence of super-strong {\\em surface} fields, therefore the magnetar\nmodel could then be tested further through the QVF braking. Pulsars' high\nsurface magnetic field interacting with the quantum vacuum result in a\nsignificantly high spindown rate ($\\dot{P}$). It is found that QVF dominates\nthe energy loss of pulsars when pulsar's rotation period and its first\nderivative satisfy the relationship $P^3\\cdot\n\\dot{P}>0.63\\times10^{-16}\\xi^{-4}$s$^2$, where $\\xi$ is the ratio of the\nsurface magnetic field over diploe magnetic field. In the \"QVF $+$\nmagnetodipole\" joint braking scenario, the spindown behavior of magnetars\nshould be quite different from that in the pure magnetodipole model. We are\nexpecting these results could be tested by magnetar candidates, especially the\nlow magnetic field ones, in the future.\n", "  The correlation of on- and off-shell Higgs boson production at the LHC in $gg\n\\to h^* \\to ZZ$ to bound the Higgs width, under specific model-dependent\nassumptions, has recently received a lot of attention. As off-shell cross\nsection measurements in this channel suffer from a small signal yield, large\nbackgrounds, and theoretical uncertainties, we propose an alternative\ncomplementary constraint which is only possible through the combination of LEP\nand LHC measurements. Previous precision electroweak measurements at LEP allow\nfor the determination of indirect constraints on Higgs couplings to vector\nbosons by considering one-loop processes involving virtual Higgs exchange. As\nthe Higgs is off-shell in these diagrams we venture that LEP can be interpreted\nas an off-shell `Higgs Factory'. By combining these LEP constraints with\ncurrent LHC 8 TeV Higgs measurements a stronger limit on the Higgs width can be\nachieved than with LHC data alone for models with rescaled Higgs couplings.\nLooking to the future, avoiding ambiguities arising due to new physics\nmodifications of the $hGG$ coupling, a theoretically more robust constraint can\nbe achieved by correlating LEP measurements with WBF Higgs production followed\nby Higgs decays to $WW$ and $ZZ$. This method for indirectly constraining the\nHiggs width is very effective for specific BSM scenarios and is highly\ncomplementary to other proposed methods. The limits we obtain particularly\nhighlight the power of a concrete LEP+LHC combination, not only limited to\nHiggs width measurements.\n", "  We present the characterization of 8-12 GHz whispering gallery mode\nresonators machined in high-quality sapphire crystals elaborated with different\ngrowth techniques. These microwave resonators are intended to constitute the\nreference frequency of ultra-stable Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators. We\nconducted systematic tests near 4 K on these crystals to determine the unloaded\nQ-factor and the turnover temperature for whispering gallery modes in the 8-12\nGHz frequency range. These characterizations show that high quality sapphire\ncrystals elaborated with the Heat Exchange or the Kyropoulos growth technique\nare both suitable to meet a fractional frequency stability better than 1x10-15\nfor 1 s to 10.000 s integration times.\n", "  We demonstrate high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon\ndetectors (SNSPDs) fabricated from MoSi thin-films. We measure a maximum system\ndetection efficiency (SDE) of 87 +- 0.5 % at 1542 nm at a temperature of 0.7 K,\nwith a jitter of 76 ps, maximum count rate approaching 10 MHz, and polarization\ndependence as low as 3.4 +- 0.7 % The SDE curves show saturation of the\ninternal efficiency similar to WSi-based SNSPDs at temperatures as high as 2.3\nK. We show that at similar cryogenic temperatures, MoSi SNSPDs achieve\nefficiencies comparable to WSi-based SNSPDs with nearly a factor of two\nreduction in jitter.\n", "  A realistic mission scenario for the deflection of fictitious asteroid\n2015PDC is investigated that makes use of the ion beam shepherd concept as\nprimary deflection technique. The article deals with the design of a low thrust\nrendezvous trajectory to the asteroid, the estimation of the propagated\ncovariance ellipsoid and the outcome of a slow-push deflection starting from\nthree worst case scenarios (impacts in New Delhi, Dhaka and Teheran).\nDisplacing the impact point towards very low populated areas, as opposed to\nfull deflection, is found to be the simplest and most effective mitigation\napproach. Mission design, technical and political aspects are discussed.\n", "  Ultracold atoms confined by engineered magnetic or optical potentials are\nideal systems for studying phenomena otherwise difficult to realize or probe in\nthe solid state because their atomic interaction strength, number of species,\ndensity, and geometry can be independently controlled. This review focuses on\nquantum transport phenomena in atomic gases that mirror and oftentimes either\nbetter elucidate or show fundamental differences with those observed in\nmesoscopic and nanoscopic systems. We discuss significant progress in\nperforming transport experiments in atomic gases, contrast similarities and\ndifferences between transport in cold atoms and in condensed matter systems,\nand survey inspiring theoretical predictions that are difficult to verify in\nconventional setups. These results further demonstrate the versatility offered\nby atomic systems in the study of nonequilibrium phenomena and their promise\nfor novel applications.\n", "  X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism\n(XMCD) were used to probe the oxidation state and element specific magnetic\nmoments of Mn in Heusler compounds with different crystallographic structure.\nThe results were compared with theoretical calculations, and it was found that\nin full Heusler alloys, Mn is metallic (oxidation state near 0) on both\nsublattices. The magnetic moment is large and localized when octahedrally\ncoordinated by the main group element, consistent with previous theoretical\nwork, and reduced when the main group coordination is tetrahedral. By contrast,\nin the half Heusler compounds the magnetic moment of the Mn atoms is large and\nthe oxidation state is +1 or +2. The magnetic and electronic properties of Mn\nin full and half Heusler compounds are strongly dependent on the structure and\nsublattice, a fact that can be exploited to design new materials.\n", "  We calculate properties of the ground and excited states of nuclei in the\nnobelium region for proton and neutron numbers of 92 <= Z <= 104 and 144 <= N\n<= 156, respectively. We use three different energy-density-functional (EDF)\napproaches, based on covariant, Skyrme, and Gogny functionals, each within two\ndifferent parameter sets. A comparative analysis of the results obtained for\nodd-even mass staggerings, quasiparticle spectra, and moments of inertia allows\nus to identify single-particle and shell effects that are characteristic to\nthese different models and to illustrate possible systematic uncertainties\nrelated to using the EDF modelling\n", "  Starting from a short review of spaces of generalized sections of vector\nbundles, we give a concise systematic description, in precise geometric terms,\nof Leray densities, principal value densities, propagators and elementary\nsolutions of field equations in flat spacetime. We then sketch a partly\noriginal geometric presentation of free quantum fields and show how propagators\narise from their graded commutators in the boson and fermion cases.\n", "  We study the dynamical properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of\nself-propelled dumbbells with only repulsive interactions. After summarizing\nthe behavior of the translational and rotational mean-square displacements in\nthe homogeneous phase that we established in a previous study, we analyze their\nfluctuations. We study the dependence of the probability distribution functions\nin terms of the P\\'eclet number, describing the relative role of active forces\nand thermal fluctuations, and of particle density.\n", "  We present observations of the emission of XUV continua in the 20-37 eV\nregion by high harmonic generation (HHG) with $4$-$7\\ \\mathrm{fs}$ pulses\nfocused onto a Kr gas jet. The underlying mechanism relies on coherent control\nof the relative delays and phases between individually generated attosecond\npulse, achievable by adjusting the chirp of the driving pulses and the\ninteraction geometry. Under adequate negative chirp and phase matching\nconditions, the resulting interpulse interference yields a continuum XUV\nspectrum, which is due to both microscopic and macroscopic (propagation)\ncontributions. This technique opens the route for modifying the phase of\nindividual attosecond pulses and for the coherent synthesis of XUV continua\nfrom multicycle driving laser pulses without the need of an isolated attosecond\nburst.\n", "  The complete quasi-particle spectrum of a magnetized electromagnetic plasma\nis systematically explored at zero and nonzero temperatures. To this purpose,\nthe general structure of the one-loop corrected propagator of magnetized\nfermions is determined, and the dispersion relations arising from the pole of\nthis propagator are numerically solved. It turns out that in the lowest Landau\nlevel, where only one spin direction is allowed, the spectrum consists of one\npositively (negatively) charged fermionic mode with positive (negative) spin.\nIn contrast, in higher Landau levels, as an indirect consequence of the double\nspin degeneracy of fermions, the spectrum consists of two massless collective\nmodes with left- and right-chiralities. The mechanism through which these new\ncollective excitations are created in a uniform magnetic field is similar to\nthe production mechanism of dynamical holes (plasminos) at finite temperature\nand zero magnetic fields. Whereas cold magnetized plasminos appear for moderate\nmagnetic fields and for all positive momenta of propagating fermions, hot\nmagnetized plasminos appear only in the limit of weak magnetic fields and soft\nmomenta.\n", "  The most common search channel for heavy neutral Higgses in models with an\nextension of the Standard Model Higgs sector is $A/H^0\\rightarrow \\tau\\tau$,\nwhich becomes ineffective when new decay modes of $A/H^0$ open. In this paper,\nwe analyzed two such channels involving charged Higgses in the final states:\n$A/H^0 \\rightarrow W^\\pm H^\\mp$ and $H^0 \\rightarrow H^+H^-$. With the\nconsequent decay of $H^\\pm\\rightarrow \\tau\\nu$, we found that the limits for\n$\\sigma\\times{BR}(gg \\rightarrow A/H^0 \\rightarrow W^\\pm H^\\mp)\\times\n{BR}(H^\\pm \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu)$ vary from 30 to 10 fb for $m_{A/H^0}$ between\n300 and 1000 GeV for 95% C.L. exclusion, and about 80 to 30 fb for 5$\\sigma$\ndiscovery. For $H^+H^-$ mode, 95% C.L. limits on $\\sigma\\times {BR}(gg\\to\nH^0\\to H^+ H^-)\\times {BR}^2(H^\\pm\\to \\tau\\nu)$ vary from 9 to 4 fb for\n$m_{H^0}$ between 400 and 1000 GeV, while the 5$\\sigma$ reach is about 20 to 10\nfb. We further interpret the cross section limits in the Type II 2HDM parameter\nspace. While $A\\rightarrow W^\\pm H^\\mp$ offers great sensitivity in both\n$\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha)$ versus $\\tan\\beta$ and $m_A$ versus $\\tan\\beta$ parameter\nspace, $H^0\\rightarrow H^+ H^-$ can cover most of the parameter space for\n$H^0$. Reach in $H^0\\rightarrow W^\\pm H^\\mp$ is more limited, especially for\n$m_{H^0}>2 m_{H^\\pm}$. It is, however, complementary to $H^0\\rightarrow H^+\nH^-$ when ${BR}(H^0\\rightarrow H^+ H^-)$ is accidentally suppressed.\n", "  Cross sections for the production of pairs of photons plus two additional\njets produced from double parton scattering in high-energy proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC are calculated for the first time. The estimates are\nbased on the theoretical perturbative QCD predictions for the productions of\n\\gamma\\gamma at next-to-next-to-leading-order, jet + jet and \\gamma + jet at\nnext-to-leading-order, for their corresponding single-scattering cross\nsections. The cross sections and expected event rates for \\gamma\\gamma + 2 jets\nfrom double parton scattering, after typical acceptance and selections, are\ngiven for proton-proton collisions with the center-of-mass energies of 13 TeV\nand an integrated luminosity of 100 fb-1 planned for the following two years,\nand also center-of-mass energies of 14 TeV with 3000 fb-1 of integrated\nluminosity as LHC designed.\n", "  We present the results from the first ensemble prediction model for major\nsolar flares (M and X classes). The primary aim of this investigation is to\nexplore the construction of an ensemble for an initial prototyping of this new\nconcept. Using the probabilistic forecasts from three models hosted at the\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center (NASA-GSFC) and the NOAA forecasts, we\ndeveloped an ensemble forecast by linearly combining the flaring probabilities\nfrom all four methods. Performance-based combination weights were calculated\nusing a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm that applies a decision threshold $P_{th}$\nto the combined probabilities and maximizing the Heidke Skill Score (HSS).\nUsing the data for 13 recent solar active regions between years 2012 - 2014, we\nfound that linear combination methods can improve the overall probabilistic\nprediction and improve the categorical prediction for certain values of\ndecision thresholds. Combination weights vary with the applied threshold and\nnone of the tested individual forecasting models seem to provide more accurate\npredictions than the others for all values of $P_{th}$. According to the\nmaximum values of HSS, a performance-based weights calculated by averaging over\nthe sample, performed similarly to a equally weighted model. The values\n$P_{th}$ for which the ensemble forecast performs the best are 25 \\% for\nM-class flares and 15 \\% for X-class flares. When the human-adjusted\nprobabilities from NOAA are excluded from the ensemble, the ensemble\nperformance in terms of the Heidke score, is reduced.\n", "  Successful realization of spin-orbit coupling in atomic gases by the NIST\nscheme opens the prospect of studying the effects of spin-orbit coupling on\nmany-body physics in an unprecedentedly controllable way. Here we derive the\nlinearized hydrodynamic equations for the normal atomic gases of the spin-orbit\ncoupling by the NIST scheme with zero detuning. We show that the hydrodynamics\nof the system crucially depends on the momentum susceptibilities which can be\nmodified by the spin-orbit coupling. We reveal the effects of the spin-orbit\ncoupling on the sound velocities and the dipole mode frequency of the gases by\napplying our formalism to the ideal Fermi gas. We also discuss the\ngeneralization of our results to other situations.\n", "  The drag force law acting on a moving circular disk in a two-dimensional\ngranular medium is analyzed based on the discrete element method (DEM). It is\nremarkable that the drag force on the moving disk in moderate dense and pure\ntwo-dimensional granular medium can be well reproduced by a perfect fluid with\nseparation from the surface of the tracer. A yield force, being independent of\nthe moving speed of the disk, appears if a dry friction between the granular\ndisks and the bottom plate exists. The perfect fluidity is violated in this\ncase. The yield force and the drag force diverge at the jamming point.\n", "  We study out-of equilibrium properties of a quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs\ntwo-dimensional electron gas. By means of single electron counting experiments,\nwe measure the distribution of work and dissipated heat of the driven quantum\ndot and relate these quantities to the equilibrium free energy change, as it\nhas been proposed by C. Jarzynski [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf78}, 2690 (1997)]. We\ndiscuss the influence of the degeneracy of the quantized energy state on the\nfree energy change as well as its relation to the tunnel rates between the dot\nand the reservoir.\n", "  A novel semi-Lagrangian method is introduced to solve numerically the Euler\nequation for ideal incompressible flow in arbitrary space dimension. It\nexploits the time-analyticity of fluid particle trajectories and requires, in\nprinciple, only limited spatial smoothness of the initial data. Efficient\ngeneration of high-order time-Taylor coefficients is made possible by a\nrecurrence relation that follows from the Cauchy invariants formulation of the\nEuler equation (Zheligovsky & Frisch, J. Fluid Mech. 2014, 749, 404-430).\nTruncated time-Taylor series of very high order allow the use of time steps\nvastly exceeding the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit, without compromising the\naccuracy of the solution. Tests performed on the two-dimensional Euler equation\nindicate that the Cauchy-Lagrangian method is more - and occasionally much more\n- efficient and less prone to instability than Eulerian Runge-Kutta methods,\nand less prone to rapid growth of rounding errors than the high-order Eulerian\ntime-Taylor algorithm. We also develop tools of analysis adapted to the\nCauchy-Lagrangian method, such as the monitoring of the radius of convergence\nof the time-Taylor series. Certain other fluid equations can be handled\nsimilarly.\n", "  We consider the adjacency matrix of the ensemble of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random\ngraphs which consists of graphs on $N$ vertices in which each edge occurs\nindependently with probability $p$. We prove that in the regime $pN \\gg 1$\nthese matrices exhibit bulk universality in the sense that both the averaged\n$n$-point correlation functions and distribution of a single eigenvalue gap\ncoincide with those of the GOE. Our methods extend to a class of random\nmatrices which includes sparse ensembles whose entries have different\nvariances.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the linear stability of a stellar accretion disk,\nhaving a stratified morphology. The study is performed in the framework of\nideal magneto-hydrodynamics and therefore it results in a characterization of\nthe linear unstable magneto-rotational modes. The peculiarity of the present\nscenario consists of adopting the magnetic flux function as the basic dynamical\nvariable. Such a representation of the dynamics allows to make account of the\nco-rotation theorem as a fundamental feature of the ideal plasma equilibrium,\nevaluating its impact on the perturbation evolution too. According to the\nAlfvenic nature of the Magneto-rotational instability, we consider an\nincompressible plasma profile and perturbations propagating along the\nbackground magnetic field. Furthermore, we develop a local perturbation\nanalysis, around fiducial coordinates of the background configuration and\ndealing with very small scale of the linear dynamics in comparison to the\nbackground inhomogeneity size. The main issue of the present study is that the\ncondition for the emergence of unstable modes is the same in the stratified\nplasma disk, as in the case of a thin configuration. Such a feature is the\nresult of the cancelation of the vertical derivative of the disk angular\nfrequency from the dispersion relation, which implies that only the radial\nprofile of the differential rotation is responsible for the trigger of growing\nmodes.\n", "  Considerations of local atomic level stresses associated with each atom\nrepresent a particular approach to address structures of disordered materials\nat the atomic level. We studied structural correlations in a two-dimensional\nmodel liquid using molecular dynamics simulations in the following way. We\ndiagonalized the atomic level stress tensors of every atom and investigated\ncorrelations between the eigenvalues and orientations of the eigenvectors of\ndifferent atoms as a function of distance between them. It is demonstrated that\nthe suggested approach can be used to characterize structural correlations in\ndisordered materials. In particular, we found that changes in the stress\ncorrelation functions on decrease of temperature are the most pronounced for\nthe pairs of atoms with separation distance that corresponds to the first\nminimum in the pair density function. We also show that the angular\ndependencies of the stress correlation functions previously reported in [Phys.\nRev. E v.91, 032301 (2015)] related not to the alleged anisotropies of the\nEshelby's stress fields, but to the rotational properties of the stress\ntensors.\n", "  Self-propulsion of cellular microswimmers generates flow signatures, commonly\nclassified as pusher- and puller-type, which characterize hydrodynamic\ninteractions with other cells or boundaries. Using experimentally measured beat\npatterns, we compute that flagellated alga and sperm oscillate between pusher\nand puller. Beyond a typical distance of 100 um from the swimmer, inertia\nattenuates oscillatory micro-flows. We show that hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween swimmers oscillate in time and are of similar magnitude as stochastic\nswimming fluctuations.\n", "  The upgrade project of Hefei Light Source storage ring is under way. In this\npaper, the broadband impedances of resistive wall and coated ceramic vacuum\nchamber were calculated using the analytic formula, the wake fields and\nimpedances of other designed vacuum chambers have been simulated by the CST\ncode, and then the broadband impedances model was obtained. Using the\ntheoretical formula, longitudinal and transverse single bunch instabilities\nwere discussed. With the carefully-designed vacuum chamber, we find that the\nthresholds of the beam instabilities are higher than the beam current goal.\n", "  Electron cooler is used to improve the quality of the beam in synchrotron,\nhowever it also introduces nonlinear electromagnetic field, which cause\ntuneshift, tunespread and may drive resonances leading to beam loss. In this\npaper the tuneshift and the tunespread caused by nonlinear electromagnetic\nfield of the hollow electron beam was investigated, and the resonance driving\nterms of the nonlinear electromagnetic field was analysed. The differences were\npresented comparing with the solid electron beam. The calculations were\nperformed for $^{238}U^{32+}$ ions of energy 1.272MeV stored in CSRm, using the\nparameters given in table1. The conclusion is that in this situation nonlinear\nfield caused by the hollow electron beam do not lead to serious resonances.\n", "  The general analytical expressions for the thermal radiative and\nthermodynamic properties of a real-body are obtained in a finite range of\nfrequencies at different temperatures. The frequency dependence of the spectral\nemissivity is represented as a power series. The Stefan-Boltzmann law, total\nenergy density, number density of photons, Helmholtz free energy density,\ninternal energy density, enthalpy density, entropy density, heat capacity at\nconstant volume, pressure, and total emissivity are expressed in terms of the\npolylogarithm functions. The general expressions for the thermal radiative and\nthermodynamic functions are applied for the study of thermal radiation of\nliquid and solid zirconium carbide. These functions are calculated using\nexperimental data for the frequency dependence of the normal spectral\nemissivity in the visible-near infrared range at the melting (freezing) point.\nThe gaps between the thermal radiative and thermodynamic functions of liquid\nand solid zirconium carbide are observed. The general analytical expressions\nobtained can easily be presented in wavenumber domain.\n", "  The statistical study of voids in the matter distribution promises to be an\nimportant tool for precision cosmology, but there are known discrepancies\nbetween theoretical models of voids and the voids actually found in large\nsimulations or galaxy surveys. The empirical properties of observed voids are\nalso not well understood. In this paper, we study voids in an N-body\nsimulation, using the ZOBOV watershed algorithm. As in other studies, we use\nsets of subsampled dark matter particles as tracers to identify voids, but we\nuse the full-resolution simulation output to measure dark matter densities at\nthe identified locations. Voids span a wide range of sizes and densities, but\nthere is a clear trend towards larger voids containing deeper density minima, a\ntrend which is expected for all watershed void finders. We also find that the\ntracer density at void locations is usually smaller than the true density, and\nthat this relationship depends on the sampling density of tracers. We show that\nfits given in the literature fail to match the observed density profiles of\nvoids. The average enclosed density contrast within watershed voids varies\nwidely with both the size of the void and the minimum density within it, but is\nalways far from the shell crossing threshold expected from theoretical models.\nVoids with deeper density minima also show much broader density profiles. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results for the excursion set approach to\nmodelling such voids.\n", "  We describe this paper as a Sentimental Journey from Hydrodynamics to\nSupergravity. Beltrami equation in three dimensions that plays a key role in\nthe hydrodynamics of incompressible fluids has an unsuspected relation with\nminimal supergravity in seven dimensions. We show that just D=7 supergravity\nand no other theory with the same field content but different coefficients in\nthe lagrangian, admits exact two-brane solutions where Arnold-Beltrami fluxes\nin the transverse directions have been switched on. The rich variety of\ndiscrete groups that classify the solutions of Beltrami equation, namely the\neigenfunctions of the *d operator on a three-torus, are by this newly\ndiscovered token injected into the brane world. A new quite extensive playing\nground opens up for supergravity and for its dual gauge theories in three\ndimensions, where all classical fields and all quantum composite operators will\nbe assigned to irreducible representations of discrete crystallographic groups.\n", "  The iterative random subdivision of rectangles is used as a generation model\nof networks in physics, computer science, and urban planning. However, these\nresearches were independent. We consider some relations in them, and derive\nfundamental properties for the average lifetime depending on birth-time and the\nbalanced distribution of rectangle faces.\n", "  We present a new network model accounting for multidimensional assortativity.\nEach node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of a\nlink between two nodes depends on common features. We do not fix a priori the\ntotal number of possible features. The bipartite network of the nodes and the\nfeatures evolves according to a stochastic dynamics that depends on three\nparameters that respectively regulate the preferential attachment in the\ntransmission of the features to the nodes, the number of new features per node,\nand the power-law behavior of the total number of observed features. Our model\nalso takes into account a mechanism of triadic closure. We provide theoretical\nresults and statistical estimators for the parameters of the model. We validate\nour approach by means of simulations and an empirical analysis of a network of\nscientific collaborations.\n", "  The diagonal spin-spin correlations $ \\langle \\sigma_{0,0}\\sigma_{N,N}\n\\rangle $ of the Ising model on a triangular lattice with general couplings in\nthe three directions are evaluated in terms of a solution to a three-variable\nextension of the sixth Painlev\\'e system, namely a Garnier system. This\nidentification, which is accomplished using the theory of bi-orthogonal\npolynomials on the unit circle with regular semi-classical weights, has an\nadditional consequence whereby the correlations are characterised by a simple\nsystem of coupled, nonlinear recurrence relations in the spin separation $ N\n\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} $. These later recurrence relations are an example of\nthe discrete Garnier equations which, in turn, are extensions to the \"discrete\nPainlev\\'e V\" system.\n", "  We consider the possibility that quark and gluon distributions in the medium\ncreated in high energy heavy ion collisions may be modified by a power law tail\nat energies much higher than the temperature. We parametrize such a tail by\nTsallis distributions with an exponent motivated by phenomenology. These\ndistributions are characterized by an effective temperature scale that we\nassume to evolve in time like the temperature for thermal distributions. We\nfind that including such a tail increases the rates for photon production and\nsignificantly delays the emission times for photons of a fixed energy. We argue\nthat these effects are sufficiently large that they should be able to account\nfor photon yields and flow patterns seen in LHC and RHIC experiments.\n", "  We first review the Coset Space Dimensional Reduction (CSDR) programme and\npresent the best model constructed so far based on the $\\mathcal{N} = 1$,\n$10$-dimensional $E_8$ gauge theory reduced over the nearly-K\\\"ahler manifold\n$SU(3)/U(1)\\times U(1)$ with the additional use of the Wilson flux mechanism.\nThen we present the corresponding programme in the case that the extra\ndimensions are considered to be fuzzy coset spaces and the best model that has\nbeen constructed in this framework too. In both cases the best model appears to\nbe the trinification GUT $SU(3)^3$.\n", "  We characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum of the one-dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger operators $h=-\\Delta+v$ acting on $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}_+)$ in terms\nof the limiting behavior of the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker and Thouless conductances\nof the associated finite samples. The finite sample is defined by restricting\n$h$ to a finite interval $[1,L]\\cap\\mathbb{Z}_+$ and the conductance refers to\nthe charge current across the sample in the open quantum system obtained by\nattaching independent electronic reservoirs to the sample ends. Our main result\nis that the conductances associated to an energy interval $I$ are non-vanishing\nin the limit $L\\to\\infty$ iff ${\\rm sp}_{\\rm ac}(h)\\cap I=\\emptyset$. We also\ndiscuss the relationship between this result and the Schr\\\"odinger Conjecture.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the spin diffusion length typically reflects\nthe scattering mechanism responsible for spin relaxation. Within non-magnetic\nmetals it is reasonable to expect the Elliot-Yafet mechanism to play a role and\nthus the temperature dependence of the spin diffusion length might be inversely\nproportional to resistivity. In lateral spin valves measurements have found\nthat at low temperatures the spin diffusion length unexpected decreases. By\nmeasuring the transport properties of lateral Py/Cu/Py spin valves fabricated\nwith different purities of Cu, we extract a spin diffusion length which shows\nthis suppression below 30K only in the presence of the Kondo effect. We have\ncalculated the spin-relaxation rate and isolated the contributions from\nmagnetic impurities. We find the spin-flip probability of a magnetic impurity\nto be 34%. Our semi-quantitative analysis demonstrates the dominant role of\nKondo scattering in spin relaxation, even in low concentrations of order 1\np.p.m., and hence accounts for the reduction in spin diffusion length observed\nby ourselves and others.\n", "  Searching for Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is one of the most\nimportant missions for hadron colliders. As a landmark of BSM physics, the MSSM\nHiggs sector at the LHC is expected to be tested up to the scale of the\ndecoupling limit of O(1) TeV, except for a wedge region centered around\n$\\tan\\beta \\sim 3 -10$, which has been known to be difficult to probe. In this\narticle, we present a dedicated study testing the decoupled MSSM Higgs sector,\nat the LHC and a next-generation $pp$-collider, proposing to search in channels\nwith associated Higgs productions, with the neutral and charged Higgs further\ndecaying into $tt$ and $tb$, respectively. In the case of neutral Higgs we are\nable to probe for the so far uncovered wedge region via $pp\\to bb H/A \\to\nbbtt$. Additionally, we cover the the high $\\tan\\beta$ range with $pp\\to bb H/A\n\\to bb\\tau\\tau$. The combination of these searches with channels dedicated to\nthe low $\\tan\\beta$ region, such as $pp\\to H/A \\to tt$ and $pp\\to tt H/A \\to\ntttt$ potentially covers the full $\\tan\\beta$ range. The search for charged\nHiggs has a slightly smaller sensitivity for the moderate $\\tan\\beta$ region,\nbut additionally probes for the higher and lower $\\tan\\beta$ regions with even\ngreater sensitivity, via $pp\\to tb H^\\pm \\to tbtb$. While the LHC will be able\nto probe the whole $\\tan\\beta$ range for Higgs masses of O(1) TeV by combining\nthese channels, we show that a future 100 TeV $pp$-collider has a potential to\npush the sensitivity reach up to $\\sim \\mathcal O(10)$ TeV. In order to deal\nwith the novel kinematics of top quarks produced by heavy Higgs decays, the\nmultivariate Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method is applied in our collider\nanalyses. The BDT-based tagging efficiencies of both hadronic and leptonic\ntop-jets, and their mutual fake rates as well as the faking rates by other jets\n($h$, $Z$, $W$, $b$, etc.) are also presented.\n", "  The paper deals with the problem of dynamics of externally driven open\nquantum systems. Using the path integral methods we found an analytical\nexpression for time-dependent density matrix of two externally driven coupled\nquantum oscillators interacting with different baths of oscillators. It is\nshown that at the zeroing of external forces the density matrix becomes\nidentical to the previously obtained one for freely developing coupled\noscillators. Mean values of observables are computed by using the Hermitian\npart of the matrix. All elements of the covariance matrix composed by\ncoordinates and momenta of two driven coupled oscillators are calculated. The\ntime-dependent mean values, dispersions and covariances of coordinates of\ncoupled oscillators at given external forces are numerically studied. It is\nshown that the larger the coupling constant the larger is the disturbances of\nthe second oscillator due to external action on the first oscillator. Coupled\ndynamics of forced oscillators at relatively large coupling constant is\ndemonstrated at different thermodynamic conditions.\n", "  Plasma velocity and magnetic field measurements from the Voyager 2 mission\nare used to study solar wind turbulence in the slow solar wind at two different\nheliocentric distances, 5 and 29 astronomical units, sufficiently far apart to\nprovide information on the radial evolution of this turbulence. The magnetic\nhelicity and the cross-helicity, which express the correlation between the\nplasma velocity and the magnetic field, are used to characterize the\nturbulence. Wave number spectra are computed by means of the Taylor hypothesis\napplied to time resolved single point Voyager 2 measurements. The overall\npicture we get is complex and difficult to interpret. A substantial decrease of\nthe cross-helicity at smaller scales (over 1-3 hours of observation) with\nincreasing heliocentric distance is observed. At 5 AU the only peak in the\nprobability density of the normalized residual energy is negative, near -0.5.\nAt 29 AU the probability density becomes doubly peaked, with a negative peak at\n-0.5 and a smaller peak at a positive values of about 0.7. A decrease of the\ncross-helicity for increasing heliocentric distance is observed, together with\na reduction of the unbalance toward the magnetic energy of the energy of the\nfluctuations. For the smaller scales, we found that at 29 AU the normalized\npolarization is small and positive on average (about 0.1), it is instead zero\nat 5 AU. For the larger scales, the polarization is low and positive at 5 AU\n(average around 0.1) while it is negative (around - 0.15) at 29 AU.\n", "  We simulate the collective dynamics in spin lattices with long range\ninteractions and collective decay in one, two and three dimensions. Starting\nfrom a dynamical mean-field approach derived by local factorization of the\ndensity operator we improve the numerical approximation of the full master\nequation by including pair correlations at any distance. This truncations\nenable us to drastically increase the number of spins in our numerical\nsimulations from about ten spins in case of the full quantum model to several\nten-thousands in the mean-field approximation and a few hundreds if pair\ncorrelations are included. Extensive numerical tests help us identify\ninteraction strengths and geometric configurations where these approximations\nperform well and allow us to state fairly simple error estimates. By simulating\nsystems of increasing size we show that in one and two dimensions we can\ninclude as many spins as needed to capture the properties of infinite size\nsystems with high accuracy, while in 3D the method does not converge to desired\naccuracy within the system sizes we can currently implement. Our approach is\nwell suited to give error estimates of magic wavelength optical lattices for\natomic clock applications and corresponding super radiant lasers.\n", "  Hybrid graphene-topological insulator (TI) devices were fabricated using a\nmechanical transfer method and studied via electronic transport. Devices\nconsisting of bilayer graphene (BLG) under the TI Bi$_2$Se$_3$ exhibit\ndifferential conductance characteristics which appear to be dominated by\ntunneling, roughly reproducing the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ density of states. Similar\nresults were obtained for BLG on top of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, with 10-fold greater\nconductance consistent with a larger contact area due to better surface\nconformity. The devices further show evidence of inelastic phonon-assisted\ntunneling processes involving both Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and graphene phonons. These\nprocesses favor phonons which compensate for momentum mismatch between the TI\n$\\Gamma$ and graphene $K, K'$ points. Finally, the utility of these tunnel\njunctions is demonstrated on a density-tunable BLG device, where the\ncharge-neutrality point is traced along the energy-density trajectory. This\ntrajectory is used as a measure of the ground-state density of states.\n", "  We study compactification of 6 dimensional (1,0) theories on T^2. We use\ngeometric engineering of these theories via F-theory and employ mirror symmetry\ntechnology to solve for the effective 4d N=2 geometry for a large number of the\n(1,0) theories including those associated with conformal matter. Using this we\nshow that for a given 6d theory we can obtain many inequivalent 4d N=2 SCFTs.\nSome of these respect the global symmetries of the 6d theory while others\nexhibit SL(2,Z) duality symmetry inherited from global diffeomorphisms of the\nT^2. This construction also explains the 6d origin of moduli space of 4d affine\nADE quiver theories as flat ADE connections on T^2. Among the resulting 4d N=2\nCFTs we find theories whose vacuum geometry is captured by an LG theory (as\nopposed to a curve or a local CY geometry). We obtain arbitrary genus curves of\nclass S with punctures from toroidal compactification of (1,0) SCFTs where the\ncurve of the class S theory emerges through mirror symmetry. We also show that\ntoroidal compactification of the little string version of these theories can\nlead to class S theories with no punctures on arbitrary genus Riemann surface.\n", "  We provide a rigorous solution to the problem of constructing a structural\nevolution for a network of coupled identical dynamical units that switches\nbetween specified topologies without constraints on their structure. The\nevolution of the structure is determined indirectly, from a carefully built\ntransformation of the eigenvector matrices of the coupling Laplacians, which\nare guaranteed to change smoothly in time. In turn, this allows to extend the\nMaster Stability Function formalism, which can be used to assess the stability\nof a synchronized state. This approach is independent from the particular\ntopologies that the network visits, and is not restricted to commuting\nstructures. Also, it does not depend on the time scale of the evolution, which\ncan be faster than, comparable to, or even secular with respect to the the\ndynamics of the units.\n", "  The behavior of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solutions under a constant\nexternal electric field (E) was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.\nOur dynamic MD simulations have indicated that the irreversible nucleation\nprocess towards crystallization is accelerated by a moderate E, but retarded or\neven prohibited under a stronger E, which can be understood by the competition\nbetween self-diffusion and drift motion. The former increases with E resulting\nin the acceleration of the nucleation process, and the latter tears oppositely\ncharged ions more apart under a stronger E leading to the deceleration of\nnucleation. Moreover, our steady-state MD simulations have indicated that a\nfirst-order phase transition happens in saturated solutions only when the\napplied E is below a certain threshold Ec, and the ratio of crystallized ions\ndoes not change with the electric field. The magnitude of Ec increases with\nconcentration, because larger clusters are easy to form in a more concentrated\nsolution and require a stronger E to dissociate them.\n", "  Black phosphorus has been recently rediscovered as a new and interesting\ntwo-dimensional material due to its unique electronic and optical properties.\nHere, we study the linear and nonlinear optical properties of black phosphorus\nthin films, indicating that both linear and nonlinear optical properties are\nanisotropic and can be tuned by the film thickness. Then we employ the\nnonlinear optical property of black phosphorus for ultrafast (pulse duration\ndown to ~786 fs in mode-locking) and large-energy (pulse energy up to >18 nJ in\nQ-switching) pulse generation in fiber lasers at the near-infrared\ntelecommunication band ~1.5 {\\mu}m. Our results underscore relatively large\noptical nonlinearity in black phosphorus and its prospective for ultrafast\npulse generation, paving the way to black phosphorus based nonlinear and\nultrafast photonics applications (e.g., ultrafast all-optical\nswitches/modulators, frequency converters etc.).\n", "  We investigated the conductance and shot noise properties of\nquasiparticle-transport through a superconducting barrier in graphene. Based on\nthe Blonder, Tinkham, and Klapwijk (BTK) formulation, the theory to investigate\nthe transport properties in the superconductive graphene is developed. In\ncomparison, we considered the two cases that are the transport in the presence\nand absence of the specular Andreev reflection. It is shown that the\nconductance and shot noise exhibit essentially different features in the two\ncases. It is found that the shot noise is suppressed as a result of more\ntunneling channels contributing to the transport when the superconducting gate\nis applied. The dependence of the shot noise behavior on the potential strength\nand the width of the superconducting barrier differs in the two cases. In the\npresence of the specular Andreev reflection, the shot noise spectrum is more\nsensitive to the potential strength and the width of the superconducting\nbarrier. In both of the two cases, total transmission occurs at a certain\nparameter setting, which contributes greatly to the conductance and suppresses\nthe shot noise at the same time.\n", "  Modern cryptography is largely based on complexity assumptions, for example,\nthe ubiquitous RSA is based on the supposed complexity of the prime\nfactorization problem. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand how\na quantum computer would eventually weaken these algorithms. In this paper, one\nfollows Feynman's prescription for a computer to simulate the physics\ncorresponding to the algorithm of factoring a large number $N$ into primes.\nUsing Dirac-Jordan transformation theory one translates factorization into the\nlanguage of quantum hermitical operators, acting on the vectors of the Hilbert\nspace. This leads to obtaining the ensemble of factorization of $N$ in terms of\nthe Euler function $\\varphi(N)$, that is quantized. On the other hand,\nconsidering $N$ as a parameter of the computer, a Quantum Mechanical Prime\nCounting Function $\\pi_{QM}(x)$, where $x$ factorizes $N$, is derived. This\nfunction converges to $\\pi(x)$ when $N\\gg x$. It has no counterpart in analytic\nnumber theory and its derivation relies on semiclassical quantization alone.\n", "  Sharp metal corners and tips support plasmons localized on the scale of the\ncurvature radius -- superlocalized plasmons. We analyze plasmonic properties of\nnanoparticles with small and sharp corner- and tip-shaped surface perturbations\nin terms of hybridization of the superlocalized plasmons, which frequencies are\ndetermined by the perturbations shape, and the ordinary plasmons localized on\nthe whole particle. When the frequency of a superlocalized plasmon gets close\nto that of the ordinary plasmon, their strong hybridization occurs and\nfacilitates excitation of an optical hot-spot near the corresponding\nperturbation apex. The particle is then employed as a nano-antenna that\nselectively couples the free-space light to the nanoscale vicinity of the apex\nproviding precise local light enhancement by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have emerged as promising\nquantum solid-state systems, with applications ranging from quantum information\nprocessing to magnetic sensing. One of the most useful properties of NVs is the\nability to read their ground-state spin projection optically at room\ntemperature. This work provides a theoretical analysis of Purcell enhanced NV\noptical coupling, through which we find optimal parameters for maximal Signal\nto Noise Ratio (SNR) of the optical spin-state readout. We conclude that a\ncombined increase in spontaneous emission (through Purcell enhancement) and in\noptical excitation could significantly increase the readout SNR.\n", "  Here we formulate scenario of emergent universe from particle creation\nmechanism in spatially flat braneworld models. We consider an isotropic and\nhomogeneous universe in Braneworld cosmology and universe is considered as a\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamical system with dissipation due to particle\ncreation mechanism. Assuming the particle creation rate as a function of the\nHubble parameter , we formulate emergent scenario in RS2 and DGP models of\nBraneworld.\n", "  Thermalization is investigated for the one-dimensional anisotropic\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with dimerized nearest-neighbor interactions\nthat break integrability. For this purpose the time evolution of local operator\nexpectation values after an interacting quench is calculated directly with the\nChebyshev polynomial expansion, and the deviation of the diagonal from the\ncanonical thermal ensemble value is calculated for increasing system size for\nthese operators. The spatial and spin symmetries of the Hamiltonian are taken\ninto account to divide it into symmetry subsectors. The rate of thermalization\nis found to weaken with the dimerization parameter as the Hamiltonian evolves\nbetween two integrable limits, the non-dimerized and the fully dimerized where\nthe chain breaks up into isolated dimers. This conclusion is supported by the\ndistribution of the local operator off-diagonal elements between the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian with respect to their energy difference, which\ndetermines the strength of temporal fluctuations. The off-diagonal elements\nhave a low-energy peak for small dimerization which facilitates thermalization,\nand originates in the reduction of spatial symmetry with respect to the\nnon-dimerized limit. For increasing dimerization their distribution changes and\ndevelops a single low-energy maximum that relates to the fully dimerized limit\nand slows down thermalization.\n", "  The unique forward LHCb acceptance opens the possibility for performing\nprecision Standard Model (SM) processes in a kinematical regime beyond the\nreach of both ATLAS and CMS experiments. In this article we discuss the\nfeasibility of performing $W^{\\pm}j$ measurements with 14 TeV LHCb data, and\nfind that the leptonic asymmetry at high pseudorapidity, with appropriate cuts\non the associated jet, can provide a factor of three reduction on the $d$ quark\nPDF uncertainty in a region of Bjorken $x > 0.5$.\n", "  We study a translation invariant spin model in a three-dimensional regular\nlattice, called the cubic code model, in the presence of arbitrary extensive\nperturbations. Below a critical perturbation strength, we show that most states\nwith finite energy are localized; the overwhelming majority of such states have\nenergy concentrated around a finite number of defects, and remain so for a time\nthat is near-exponential in the distance between the defects. This phenomenon\nis due to an emergent superselection rule and does not require any disorder. An\nextensive number of local integrals of motion for these finite energy sectors\nare identified as well. Our analysis extends more generally to systems with\nimmobile topological excitations.\n", "  We have performed fully-kinetic simulations of X-B and O-X-B mode conversion\nin one and two dimensional setups using the PIC code EPOCH. We have recovered\nthe linear dispersion relation for electron Bernstein waves by employing\nrelatively low amplitude incoming waves. The setups presented here can be used\nto study non-linear regimes of X-B and O-X-B mode conversion.\n", "  Ultrathin membranes have drawn much attention due to their unprecedented\nspatial resolution for DNA nanopore sequencing. However, the high translocation\nvelocity (3000-50000 nt/ms) of DNA molecules moving across such membranes\nlimits their usability. To this end, we have introduced a viscosity gradient\nsystem based on room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) to control the dynamics\nof DNA translocation through a nanometer-size pore fabricated in an atomically\nthin MoS2 membrane. This allows us for the first time to statistically identify\nall four types of nucleotides with solid state nanopores. Nucleotides are\nidentified according to the current signatures recorded during their transient\nresidence in the narrow orifice of the atomically thin MoS2 nanopore. In this\nnovel architecture that exploits high viscosity of RTIL, we demonstrate\nsingle-nucleotide translocation velocity that is an optimal speed (1-50 nt/ms)\nfor DNA sequencing, while keeping the signal to noise ratio (SNR) higher than\n10. Our findings pave the way for future low-cost and rapid DNA sequencing\nusing solid-state nanopores.\n", "  A study of QCD coherence is presented based on a sample of about 397000\n$e^+e^-$ hadronic annihilation events collected at $\\sqrt{s}=91$ GeV with the\nOPAL detector at LEP. The study is based on four recently proposed observables\nthat are sensitive to coherence effects in the perturbative regime. The\nmeasurement of these observables is presented, along with a comparison with the\npredictions of different parton shower models. The models include both\nconventional parton shower models and dipole antenna models. Different ordering\nvariables are used to investigate their influence on the predictions.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional weakly interacting ultracold Bose gas whose\nconstituents are two-level atoms. We study the effects of a synthetic\ndensity-dependent gauge field that arises from laser-matter coupling in the\nadiabatic limit with a laser configuration such that the single-particle\nzero-order vector potential corresponds to a constant synthetic magnetic field.\nWe find a new exotic type of current non-linearity in the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation which affects the dynamics of the order parameter of the condensate.\nWe investigate the rotational properties of this system, focusing in particular\non the physical conditions that make the nucleation of a quantized vortex in\nthe system energetically favourable with respect to the non rotating solution.\nWe point out that two different physical interpretations can be given to this\nnew non linearity: firstly it can be seen as a local modification of the mean\nfield coupling constant, whose value depends on the angular momentum of the\ncondensate. Secondly, it can be interpreted as a density modulated angular\nvelocity given to the cloud. Looking at the problem from both of these\nviewpoints, we analyze the physical conditions that make a single vortex state\nenergetically favourable. In the Thomas-Fermi limit, we show that the effect of\nthe new nonlinearity is to induce a rotation to the condensate, where the\ntransition from non-rotating to rotating states depends on the density of the\ncloud.\n", "  We discuss a hydrodynamical description of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov\nline at large but finite $N_c$ for Yang-Mills theory in even and odd space-time\ndimensions. The hydro-static solutions for the eigenvalue densities are shown\nto interpolate between a uniform distribution in the confined phase and a\nlocalized distribution in the de-confined phase. The resulting critical\ntemperatures are in overall agreement with those measured on the lattice over a\nbroad range of $N_c$, and are consistent with the string model results at\n$N_c=\\infty$. The stochastic relaxation of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line\nout of equilibrium is captured by a hydrodynamical instanton. An estimate of\nthe probability of formation of a Z(N$_c)$ bubble using a piece-wise sound wave\nis suggested.\n", "  We develop a general perturbative computation of finite-frequency quantum\nnoise which applies, in particular, to both good or weakly transmitting\nstrongly correlated conductors coupled to a generic environment. Under a\nminimal set of hypotheses, we show that the noise can be expressed through the\nnon-equilibrium DC current only, generalizing a non-equilibrium fluctuation\ndissipation relation. We use this relation to derive explicit predictions for\nthe non equilibrium finite frequency noise for a single channel conductor\nconnected to an arbitrary Ohmic environment.\n", "  Recent tests performed on the D-Wave Two quantum annealer have revealed no\nclear evidence of speedup over conventional silicon-based technologies. Here,\nwe present results from classical parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations\ncombined with isoenergetic cluster moves of the archetypal benchmark problem-an\nIsing spin glass-on the native chip topology. Using realistic uncorrelated\nnoise models for the D-Wave Two quantum annealer, we study the best-case\nresilience, i.e., the probability that the ground-state configuration is not\naffected by random fields and random-bond fluctuations found on the chip. We\nthus compute classical upper-bound success probabilities for different types of\ndisorder used in the benchmarks and predict that an increase in the number of\nqubits will require either error correction schemes or a drastic reduction of\nthe intrinsic noise found in these devices. We outline strategies to develop\nrobust, as well as hard benchmarks for quantum annealing devices, as well as\nany other computing paradigm affected by noise.\n", "  We present a general geometrical approach to the problem of escape from a\nmetastable state in the presence of noise. The accompanying analysis leads to a\nsimple condition, based on the norm of the drift field, for determining whether\ncaustic singularities alter the escape trajectories when detailed balance is\nabsent. We apply our methods to systems lacking detailed balance, including a\nnanomagnet with a biaxial magnetic anisotropy and subject to a spin transfer\ntorque. The approach described within allows determination of the regions of\nexperimental parameter space that admit caustics.\n", "  We develop the theory of irregular conformal blocks of the Virasoro algebra.\nIn previous studies, expansions of irregular conformal blocks at regular\nsingular points were obtained as degeneration limits of regular conformal\nblocks; however, such expansions at irregular singular points were not clearly\nunderstood. This is because precise definitions of irregular vertex operators\nhad not been provided previously. In this paper, we present precise definitions\nof irregular vertex operators of two types and we prove that one of our vertex\noperators exists uniquely. Then, we define irregular conformal blocks with at\nmost two irregular singular points as expectation values of given irregular\nvertex operators. Our definitions provide an understanding of expansions of\nirregular conformal blocks and enable us to obtain expansions at irregular\nsingular points.\n  As an application, we propose conjectural formulas of series expansions of\nthe tau functions of the fifth and fourth Painlev\\'e equations, using\nexpansions of irregular conformal blocks at an irregular singular point.\n", "  Failure of amorphous solids is fundamental to various phenomena, including\nlandslides and earthquakes. Recent experiments indicate that highly plastic\nregions form elongated structures that are especially apparent near the maximal\nshear stress $\\Sigma_{\\max}$ where failure occurs. This observation suggested\nthat $\\Sigma_{\\max}$ acts as a critical point where the length scale of those\nstructures diverges, possibly causing macroscopic transient shear bands. Here\nwe argue instead that the entire solid phase ($\\Sigma<\\Sigma_{\\max}$) is\ncritical, that plasticity always involves system-spanning events, and that\ntheir magnitude diverges at $\\Sigma_{\\max}$ independently of the presence of\nshear bands. We relate the statistics and fractal properties of these\nrearrangements to an exponent $\\theta$ that captures the stability of the\nmaterial, which is observed to vary continuously with stress, and we confirm\nour predictions in elastoplastic models.\n", "  We theoretically study the optical tomography of maximally entangled states\ngenerated at the output modes of a beam splitter. We consider even and odd\ncoherent states in one of the input modes and vacuum state in the other input\nmode of the beam splitter. We have shown that the signatures of entanglement\ncan be observed directly in the optical tomogram of the state, without\nreconstructing the density matrix of the system. Two distinct types of optical\ntomograms are observed in any one of the output modes of the beam splitter\nbased on the quadrature measurement in the other output mode if the output\nmodes are entangled. The different features shown by the optical tomograms are\nverified by investigating the photon number statistics of the corresponding\nstate.\n", "  Optical trapping is an indispensable tool in physics and the life sciences.\nHowever, there is a clear trade off between the size of a particle to be\ntrapped, its spatial confinement, and the intensities required. This is due to\nthe decrease in optical response of smaller particles and the diffraction limit\nthat governs the spatial variation of optical fields. It is thus highly\ndesirable to find techniques that surpass these bounds. Recently, a number of\nexperiments using nanophotonic cavities have observed a qualitatively different\ntrapping mechanism described as \"self-induced back-action trapping\" (SIBA). In\nthese systems, the particle motion couples to the resonance frequency of the\ncavity, which results in a strong interplay between the intra-cavity field\nintensity and the forces exerted. Here, we provide a theoretical description\nthat for the first time captures the remarkable range of consequences. In\nparticular, we show that SIBA can be exploited to yield dynamic reshaping of\ntrap potentials, strongly sub-wavelength trap features, and significant\nreduction of intensities seen by the particle, which should have important\nimplications for future trapping technologies\n", "  We study theoretically the erosion threshold of a granular bed forced by a\nviscous fluid. We first introduce a novel model of interacting particles driven\non a rough substrate. It predicts a continuous transition at some threshold\nforcing $\\theta_c$, beyond which the particle current grows linearly $J\\sim\n\\theta-\\theta_c$, in agreement with experiments. The stationary state is\nreached after a transient time $t_{\\rm conv}$ which diverges near the\ntransition as $t_{\\rm conv}\\sim |\\theta-\\theta_c|^{-z}$ with $z\\approx 2.5$.\nThe model also makes quantitative testable predictions for the drainage\npattern: the distribution $P(\\sigma)$ of local current is found to be extremely\nbroad with $P(\\sigma)\\sim J/\\sigma$, spatial correlations for the current are\nnegligible in the direction transverse to forcing, but long-range parallel to\nit. We explain some of these features using a scaling argument and a mean-field\napproximation that builds an analogy with $q$-models. We discuss the\nrelationship between our erosion model and models for the depinning transition\nof vortex lattices in dirty superconductors, where our results may also apply.\n", "  We introduce a simple approach to fabricate aligned carbon nanotube (ACNT)\ndevice for broadband polarization control in fiber laser systems. The ACNT\ndevice was fabricated by pulling from as-fabricated vertically-aligned carbon\nnanotube arrays. Their anisotropic property is confirmed with optical and\nscanning electron microscopy, and with polarized Raman and absorption\nspectroscopy. The device was then integrated into fiber laser systems (at two\ntechnologically important wavelengths of 1 and 1.5 um) for polarization\ncontrol. We obtained a linearly-polarized light output with the maximum\nextinction ratio of ~12 dB. The output polarization direction could be fully\ncontrolled by the ACNT alignment direction in both lasers. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that ACNT device is applied to polarization\ncontrol in laser systems. Our results exhibit that the ACNT device is a simple,\nlow-cost, and broadband polarizer to control laser polarization dynamics, for\nvarious photonic applications (such as material processing, polarization\ndiversity detection in communications), where the linear polarization control\nis necessary.\n", "  The chromospheric response to the input of flare energy is marked by extended\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) ribbons and hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints. These are\nusually explained as the result of heating and bremsstrahlung emission from\naccelerated electrons colliding in the dense chromospheric plasma. We present\nevidence of impulsive heating of flare ribbons above 10 MK in a two-ribbon\nflare. We analyse the impulsive phase of SOL2013-11-09T06:38, a C2.6 class\nevent using data from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board of Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to derive the temperature, emission measure and\ndifferential emission measure of the flaring regions and investigate the\nevolution of the plasma in the flaring ribbons. The ribbons were visible at all\nSDO/AIA EUV/UV wavelengths, in particular, at 94 and 131 \\AA\\ filters,\nsensitive to temperatures of 8 MK and 12 MK. Time evolution of the emission\nmeasure of the plasma above 10 MK at the ribbons has a peak near the HXR peak\ntime. The presence of hot plasma in the lower atmosphere is further confirmed\nby RHESSI imaging spectroscopy analysis, which shows resolved sources at 11-13\nMK associated with at least one ribbon. We found that collisional beam heating\ncan only marginally explain the necessary power to heat the 10 MK plasma at the\nribbons.\n", "  Superconducting spintronics has emerged in the last decade as a promising new\nfield that seeks to open a new dimension for nanoelectronics by utilizing the\ninternal spin structure of the superconducting Cooper pair as a new degree of\nfreedom. Its basic building blocks are spin-triplet Cooper pairs with equally\naligned spins, which are promoted by proximity of a conventional superconductor\nto a ferromagnetic material with inhomogeneous macroscopic magnetization. Using\nlow-energy muon spin rotation experiments, we find an entirely unexpected novel\neffect: the appearance of a magnetization in a thin layer of a non-magnetic\nmetal (gold), separated from a ferromagnetic double layer by a 50 nm thick\nsuperconducting layer of Nb. The effect can be controlled by either temperature\nor by using a magnetic field to control the state of the remote ferromagnetic\nelements and may act as a basic building block for a new generation of quantum\ninterference devices based on the spin of a Cooper pair.\n", "  Based on the $SU(3)_{F}$ gauge family symmetry model which was proposed to\nexplain the observed mass and mixing pattern of neutrinos, we investigate the\nsymmetry breaking, the mixing pattern in quark and lepton sectors, and the\ncontribution of the new gauge bosons to some flavour changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) processes at low energy. With the current data of the mass differences\nin the neutral pseudo-scalar $P^{0}-\\bar{P}^{0}$ systems, we find that the\n$SU(3)_{F}$ symmetry breaking scale can be as low as 300TeV and the mass of the\nlightest gauge boson be about $100$TeV. Other FCNC processes, such as the\nlepton flavour number violation process $\\mu^{-}\\rightarrow e^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$\nand the semi-leptonic rare decay $K\\rightarrow \\pi \\bar{\\nu} \\nu$, contain\ncontributions via the new gauge bosons exchanging. With the constrains got from\n$P^0-\\bar{P}^0$ system, we estimate that the contribution of the new physics is\naround $10^{-16}$, far below the current experimental bounds.\n", "  In this paper we apply the time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method\nto explore a midified single- and double-slit diffraction of matter waves. By\nusing a simplified model of two electrons prepared in the ground state of an\natom (molecule) and then suddenly released we are able to calculate the\ndiffraction patterns in one spatial dimension in close correspondence with the\nnumerically exact results. Through the Coulomb repulsion the one electron\nserves as an environment for the other thus introducing decoherence in the\nquantum state which is easily quantified. It is demonstrated that the set of\nsingle particle wave functions yield by TDQMC can be used to directly construct\ndensity matrix for that particle without tracing out the other particles from\nthe density matrix of the whole system. In this way it is possible to build\nexplicitly time-dependent density matrices for different components of a\ncomplex quantum system straight within the TDQMC algorithm which may widen our\nunderstanding of quantum dynamics in many-body systems.\n", "  We measure the intrinsic relation between velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) and\nluminosity ($L$) for massive, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at redshift $z \\sim\n0.55$. We achieve unprecedented precision by using a sample of 600,000 galaxies\nwith spectra from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the\nthird Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), covering a range of stellar masses\n$M_* \\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. We deconvolve the effects of photometric\nerrors, limited spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio, and red--blue galaxy\nconfusion using a novel hierarchical Bayesian formalism that is generally\napplicable to any combination of photometric and spectroscopic observables. For\nan L-$\\sigma$ relation of the form $L \\propto \\sigma^{\\beta}$, we find $\\beta =\n7.8 \\pm 1.1$ for $\\sigma$ corrected to the effective radius, and a very small\nintrinsic scatter of $s = 0.047 \\pm 0.004$ in $\\log_{10} \\sigma$ at fixed $L$.\nNo significant redshift evolution is found for these parameters. The evolution\nof the zero-point within the redshift range considered is consistent with the\npassive evolution of a galaxy population that formed at redshift $z=2-3$,\nassuming single stellar populations. An analysis of previously reported results\nseems to indicate that the passively-evolved high-mass L-$\\sigma$ relation at\n$z\\sim0.55$ is consistent with the one measured at $z=0.1$. Our results, in\ncombination with those presented in Montero-Dorta et al. (2014), provide a\ndetailed description of the high-mass end of the red sequence (RS) at\n$z\\sim0.55$. This characterization, in the light of previous literature,\nsuggest that the high-mass RS distribution corresponds to the \"core\" elliptical\npopulation.\n", "  Parity violation in a chiral, four-atom molecule is discussed. Given the\ngeometrical positions of the four atoms, we calculate the anapole moment of it.\nThis problem was first discussed by Khriplovich and Pospelov. We give a\ndetailed derivation for it so that it can be more accessible to wider range of\nscientists. We correct errors in their results and generalize their initial\nstate to |s_{1/2}\\rangle and |p_{1/2}\\rangle states. We also discuss realistic\ncandidates of the chiral molecules to which this approach can be applied.\n", "  In this paper, we study several issues in the linear equation-of-motion (EoM)\nand in-in approaches of computing the two-point correlation functions in\nmulti-field inflation. We prove the equivalence between this EoM approach and\nthe first-principle in-in formalism. We check this equivalence using several\nexplicit examples, including cases with scale-invariant corrections and\nscale-dependent features. Motivated by the explicit proof, we show that the\nusual procedures in these approaches can be extended and applied to some\ninteresting model categories beyond what has been studied in the literature so\nfar. These include the density perturbations with strong couplings and\ncorrelated multi-field initial states.\n", "  We use the canonical description of T-duality as well as the formulation of\nT-duality in terms of chiral currents to investigate the geometric and\nnon-geometric faces of closed string backgrounds originating from principal\ntorus bundles with constant H-flux. Employing conformal field theory\ntechniques, the non-commutative and non-associative structures among\ngeneralized coordinates in the so called Q-flux and R-flux backgrounds emerge\nby gauging the Abelian symmetries of an enlarged Rocek-Verlinde sigma-model and\nprojecting the associated chiral currents of the enlarged theory to the T-dual\ncoset models carrying non-geometric fluxes.\n", "  We present in this paper a new Bayesian semi-blind approach for foreground\nremoval in observations of the 21-cm signal with interferometers. The\ntechnique, which we call HIEMICA (HI Expectation-Maximization Independent\nComponent Analysis), is an extension of the Independent Component Analysis\n(ICA) technique developed for two-dimensional (2D) CMB maps to\nthree-dimensional (3D) 21-cm cosmological signals measured by interferometers.\nThis technique provides a fully Bayesian inference of power spectra and maps\nand separates the foregrounds from signal based on the diversity of their power\nspectra. Only relying on the statistical independence of the components, this\napproach can jointly estimate the 3D power spectrum of the 21-cm signal and,\nthe 2D angular power spectrum and the frequency dependence of each foreground\ncomponent, without any prior assumptions about foregrounds. This approach has\nbeen tested extensively by applying it to mock data from interferometric 21-cm\nintensity mapping observations under idealized assumptions of instrumental\neffects. We also discuss the impact when the noise properties are not known\ncompletely. As a first step toward solving the 21 cm power spectrum analysis\nproblem we compare the semi-blind HIEMICA technique with the commonly used\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). Under the same idealized circumstances the\nproposed technique provides significantly improved recovery of the power\nspectrum. This technique can be applied straightforwardly to all 21-cm\ninterferometric observations, including epoch of reionization measurements, and\ncan be extended to single-dish observations as well.\n", "  We demonstrate an experimental method for direct 2D and 3D imaging of\nmagnetic radio-frequency (rf) field distribution in metal-dielectric structures\nbased on traveling wave (TW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high\nfield (> 7T). The typical apparatus would include an ultra-high field whole\nbody or small bore MRI scanner, waveguide elements filled with MRI active\ndielectrics with predefined electric and magnetic properties, and TW rf\ntransmit-receive probes. We validated the technique by obtaining TW\nmagnetic-resonance (MR) images of the magnetic field distribution of the rf\nmodes of circular waveguide filled with deionized water in a 16.4 T small-bore\nMRI scanner and compared the MR images with numerical simulations. Our MRI\ntechnique opens up a practical non-perturbed way of imaging of previously\ninaccessible rf field distribution of modes inside of various shapes metal\nwaveguides with inserted dielectric objects, including waveguide mode\nconverters and transformers.\n", "  In this contribution to the study of one dimensional point potentials, we\nprove that if we take the limit $q\\to 0$ on a potential of the type\n$v_0\\delta({y})+{2}v_1\\delta'({y})+w_0\\delta({y}-q)+ {2} w_1\\delta'({y}-q)$, we\nobtain a new point potential of the type ${u_0} \\delta({y})+{2 u_1}\n\\delta'({y})$, when $ u_0$ and $ u_1$ are related to $v_0$, $v_1$, $w_0$ and\n$w_1$ by a law having the structure of a group. This is the Borel subgroup of\n$SL_2({\\mathbb R})$. We also obtain the non-abelian addition law from the\nscattering data. The spectra of the Hamiltonian in the exceptional cases\nemerging in the study are also described in full detail. It is shown that for\nthe $v_1=\\pm 1$, $w_1=\\pm 1$ values of the $\\delta^\\prime$ couplings the\nsingular Kurasov matrices become equivalent to Dirichlet at one side of the\npoint interaction and Robin boundary conditions at the other side.\n", "  Power density constraints are limiting the performance improvements of modern\nCPUs. To address this we have seen the introduction of lower-power, multi-core\nprocessors, but the future will be even more exciting. In order to stay within\nthe power density limits but still obtain Moore's Law performance/price gains,\nit will be necessary to parallelize algorithms to exploit larger numbers of\nlightweight cores and specialized functions like large vector units. Example\ntechnologies today include Intel's Xeon Phi and GPGPUs.\n  Track finding and fitting is one of the most computationally challenging\nproblems for event reconstruction in particle physics. At the High Luminosity\nLHC, for example, this will be by far the dominant problem. The need for\ngreater parallelism has driven investigations of very different track finding\ntechniques including Cellular Automata or returning to Hough Transform. The\nmost common track finding techniques in use today are however those based on\nthe Kalman Filter. Significant experience has been accumulated with these\ntechniques on real tracking detector systems, both in the trigger and offline.\nThey are known to provide high physics performance, are robust and are exactly\nthose being used today for the design of the tracking system for HL-LHC.\n  Our previous investigations showed that, using optimized data structures,\ntrack fitting with Kalman Filter can achieve large speedup both with Intel Xeon\nand Xeon Phi. We report here our further progress towards an end-to-end track\nreconstruction algorithm fully exploiting vectorization and parallelization\ntechniques in a realistic simulation setup.\n", "  The ability to read, use and develop code efficiently and successfully is a\nkey ingredient in modern particle physics. We report the experience of a\ntraining program, identified as \"Advanced Programming Concepts\", that\nintroduces software concepts, methods and techniques to work effectively on a\ndaily basis in a HEP experiment or other programming intensive fields. This\npaper illustrates the principles, motivations and methods that shape the\n\"Advanced Computing Concepts\" training program, the knowledge base that it\nconveys, an analysis of the feedback received so far, and the integration of\nthese concepts in the software development process of the experiments as well\nas its applicability to a wider audience.\n", "  It is analyzed the hydrodynamics of carriers (charge and heat motion) and\nphonons (heat motion) in semiconductors in the presence of constant electric\nfields. This is done in terms of a so-called Higher-Order Generalized\nHydrodynamics (HOGH), also referred to as Mesoscopic Hydro-Thermodynamics\n(MHT), that is, covering phenomena involving motions displaying variations\nshort in space and fast in time and being arbitrarily removed from equilibrium,\nas it is the case in modern electronic devices. The particular case of a MHT of\norder 1 is described, covering wire samples from macro to nano sizes. Electric\nand thermal conductivities are obtained. As the size decreases towards the\nnanometric scale, the MHT of order 1 produces results that in some cases\ngreatly differ from those of the usual hydro-thermodynamics. The so-called\nMaxwell times associated to the different fluxes present in MHT are evidenced\nand analyzed; they have a quite relevant role in determining the\ncharacteristics of the motion.\n", "  We present a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of native defects in\ngraphene islands grown by ultra-high vacuum (UHV) decomposition of ethylene on\nCu(111). We characterize these defects through a survey of their apparent\nheights, atomic-resolution imaging, and detailed tunneling spectroscopy. Bright\ndefects that occur only in graphene regions are identified as C site point\ndefects in the graphene lattice and are most likely single C vacancies. Dark\ndefect types are observed in both graphene and Cu regions, and are likely point\ndefects in the Cu surface. We also present data showing the importance of bias\nand tip termination to the appearance of the defects in STM images and the\nability to achieve atomic resolution. Finally, we present tunneling\nspectroscopy measurements probing the influence of point defects on the local\nelectronic landscape of graphene islands.\n", "  We determine the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha)$ correction to the energy spectrum of\nelectrons produced in the decay of muons bound in atoms. We focus on the\nhigh-energy end of the spectrum that constitutes a background for the\nmuon-electron conversion and will be precisely measured by the upcoming\nexperiments Mu2e and COMET. The correction suppresses the background by about\n15\\%.\n", "  Solar flares are energetic events taking place in the Sun's atmosphere, and\ntheir effects can greatly impact the environment of the surrounding planets. In\nparticular, eruptive flares, as opposed to confined flares, launch coronal mass\nejections into the interplanetary medium, and as such, are one of the main\ndrivers of space weather. After briefly reviewing the main characteristics of\nsolar flares, we summarize the processes that can account for the build up and\nrelease of energy during their evolution. In particular, we focus on the\ndevelopment of recent 3D numerical simulations that explain many of the\nobserved flare features. These simulations can also provide predictions of the\ndynamical evolution of coronal and photospheric magnetic field. Here we present\na few observational examples that, together with numerical modelling, point to\nthe underlying physical mechanisms of the eruptions.\n", "  We present numerical simulations in 3D settings where coronal rain phenomena\ntake place in a magnetic configuration of a quadrupolar arcade system. Our\nsimulation is a magnetohydrodynamic simulation including anisotropic thermal\nconduction, optically thin radiative losses, and parametrised heating as main\nthermodynamical features to construct a realistic arcade configuration from\nchromospheric to coronal heights. The plasma evaporation from chromospheric and\ntransition region heights eventually causes localised runaway condensation\nevents and we witness the formation of plasma blobs due to thermal instability,\nthat evolve dynamically in the heated arcade part and move gradually downwards\ndue to interchange type dynamics. Unlike earlier 2.5D simulations, in this case\nthere is no large scale prominence formation observed, but a continuous coronal\nrain develops which shows clear indications of Rayleigh-Taylor or interchange\ninstability, that causes the denser plasma located above the transition region\nto fall down, as the system moves towards a more stable state. Linear stability\nanalysis is used in the non-linear regime for gaining insight and giving a\nprediction of the system's evolution. After the plasma blobs descend through\ninterchange, they follow the magnetic field topology more closely in the lower\ncoronal regions, where they are guided by the magnetic dips.\n", "  We argue that the dimensionality of the space of quantum systems' states\nshould be considered as a legitimate resource for quantum information tasks.\nThe assertion is supported by the fact that quantum states with discord-like\ncapacities can be obtained from classically correlated states in spaces of\ndimension large enough. We illustrate things with some simple examples that\njustify our claim.\n", "  The presence of extra scalar singlets is a feature of several motivated\nextensions of the Standard Model, and the mixing of such a singlet with the\nHiggs boson is allowed to be quite large by current experiments. In this paper\nwe perform a thorough phenomenological study of this possibility. We consider\nboth direct and indirect searches, and we quantify the current constraints as\nwell as the prospects for future hadron and lepton machines - from the\nforthcoming LHC run up to a futuristic 100 TeV proton-proton collider. The\ndirect reaches are obtained extrapolating the current limits with a technique\nthat we discuss and check with various tests. We find a strong complementarity\nbetween direct and indirect searches, with the former dominating for lower\nvalues of the singlet mass. We also find that the trilinear Higgs coupling can\nhave sizeable deviations from its Standard Model value, a fact for which we\nprovide an analytical understanding. The results are first presented in a\ngeneral scalar singlet extension of the Standard Model, taking advantage of the\nvery small number of parameters relevant for the phenomenology. Finally, we\nspecify the same analysis to a few most natural models, i.e. the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, Twin Higgs and Composite Higgs.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution of the Collins\nazimuthal asymmetries in $e^+e^-$ annihilations and semi-inclusive hadron\nproduction in deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) processes. All the relevant\ncoefficients are calculated up to the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) order\naccuracy. By applying the TMD evolution at the approximate NLL order in the\nCollins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism, we extract transversity distributions\nfor $u$ and $d$ quarks and Collins fragmentation functions from current\nexperimental data by a global analysis of the Collins asymmetries in\nback-to-back di-hadron productions in $e^+e^-$ annihilations measured by BELLE\nand BABAR Collaborations and SIDIS data from HERMES, COMPASS, and JLab HALL A\nexperiments. The impact of the evolution effects and the relevant theoretical\nuncertainties are discussed. We further discuss the TMD interpretation for our\nresults, and illustrate the unpolarized quark distribution, transversity\ndistribution, unpolarized quark fragmentation and Collins fragmentation\nfunctions depending on the transverse momentum and the hard momentum scale. We\nmake detailed predictions for future experiments and discuss their impact.\n", "  I investigate $^{10}$B+$\\alpha$ cluster states of $^{14}$N with a\n$^{10}$B+$\\alpha$ cluster model. Near the $\\alpha$-decay threshold energy, I\nobtain $K^\\pi=3^+$ and $K^\\pi=1^+$ rotational bands having\n$^{10}$B($3^+$)+$\\alpha$ and $^{10}$B($1^+$)+$\\alpha$ components, respectively.\nI assign the band-head state of the $K^\\pi=3^+$ band to the experimental $3^+$\nat $E_x$=13.19 MeV of $^{14}$N observed in $\\alpha$ scattering reactions by\n$^{10}$B and show that the calculated $\\alpha$-decay width is consistent with\nthe experimental data. I discuss an $\\alpha$-cluster motion around the $^{10}$B\ncluster and show that $^{10}$B+$\\alpha$ cluster states contain significant\ncomponents of a linear-chain 3$\\alpha$ configuration, in which an $\\alpha$\ncluster is localized in the longitudinal direction around the deformed $^{10}$B\ncluster.\n", "  A complex quantum system can be constructed by coupling simple quantum\nelements to one another. For example, trapped-ion or superconducting quantum\nbits may be coupled by Coulomb interactions, mediated by the exchange of\nvirtual photons. Alternatively quantum objects can be coupled by the exchange\nof real photons, particularly when driven within resonators that amplify\ninteractions with a single electro-magnetic mode. However, in such an open\nsystem, the capacity of a coupling channel to convey quantum information or\ngenerate entanglement may be compromised. Here, we realize phase-coherent\ninteractions between two spatially separated, near-ground-state mechanical\noscillators within a driven optical cavity. We observe also the noise imparted\nby the optical coupling, which results in correlated mechanical fluctuations of\nthe two oscillators. Achieving the quantum backaction dominated regime opens\nthe door to numerous applications of cavity optomechanics with a complex\nmechanical system. Our results thereby illustrate the potential, and also the\nchallenge, of coupling quantum objects with light.\n", "  Chains of magnetic atoms placed on the surface of an s-wave superconductor\nwith large spin-orbit coupling provide a promising platform for the realization\nof topological superconducting states characterized by the presence of Majorana\nzero-energy modes. In this work we study the properties of the one-dimensional\nchain of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states induced by magnetic impurities using a\nrealistic model for the magnetic atoms that include the presence of multiple\nscattering channels. These channels are mixed by the spin-orbit coupling and,\nvia the hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states at different sites of the\nchain, result in a multi-band structure for the chain. We obtain the\ntopological phase diagram for such band structure. We identify the parameter\nregimes for which the different bands lead to a topological phase and show that\nthe inclusion of higher bands can greatly enlarge the phase space for the\nrealization of topological states.\n", "  We conjecture a closed-form expression for the Schur limit of the\nsuperconformal index of two infinite series of Argyres-Douglas (AD)\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs): the (A_1,A_{2n-3}) and the (A_1,D_{2n})\ntheories. While these SCFTs can be realized at special points on the Coulomb\nbranch of certain N=2 gauge theories, their superconformal R symmetries are\nemergent, and hence their indices cannot be evaluated by localization. Instead,\nwe construct the (A_1, A_{2n-3}) and (A_1, D_{2n}) indices by using a relation\nto two-dimensional q-deformed Yang-Mills theory and data from the class S\nconstruction. Our results generalize the indices derived from the torus\npartition functions of the two-dimensional chiral algebras associated with the\n(A_1, A_3) and (A_1, D_4) SCFTs. As checks of our conjectures, we study the\nconsistency of our results with an S-duality recently discussed by us in\ncollaboration with Giacomelli and Papageorgakis, we reproduce known Higgs\nbranch relations, we check consistency with a series of renormalization group\nflows, and we verify that the small S^1 limits of our indices reproduce\nexpected Cardy-like behavior. We will discuss the S^1 reduction of our indices\nin a separate paper.\n", "  The spectrum of Prokushkin--Vasiliev Theory is puzzling in light of the\nGaberdiel--Gopakumar conjecture because it generically contains an additional\nsector besides higher-spin gauge and scalar fields. We find the unique\ntruncation of the theory avoiding this problem to order 2 in perturbations\naround AdS$_3$. The second-order backreaction on the physical gauge sector\ninduced by the scalars is computed explicitly. The cubic action for the\nphysical fields is determined completely. We comment on a different higher-spin\ntheory without such additional fields at $\\lambda=1$.\n", "  We study the SU(3) gluon propagator in renormalizable $R_\\xi$ gauges\nimplemented on a symmetric lattice with a total volume of (3.25 fm)$^4$ for\nvalues of the guage fixing parameter up to $\\xi=0.5$. As expected, the\nlongitudinal gluon dressing function stays constant at its tree-level value\n$\\xi$. Similar to the Landau gauge, the transverse $R_\\xi$ gauge gluon\npropagator saturates at a non-vanishing value in the deep infrared for all\nvalues of $\\xi$ studied. We compare with very recent continuum studies and\nperform a simple analysis of the found saturation with a dynamically generated\neffective gluon mass.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that a polarized nuclear spin modifies the\ndynamic behavior of a neighboring electronic spin. Specifically, an\nout-of-phase component appears in the electronic spin-echo signal. This\ncomponent is proportional to the nuclear spin degree of polarization and\nstrongly depends on the nuclear polarization direction. When the electronic\nspin is surrounded by a polarized nuclear spin bath, the spin-echo quadrature\nmanifests a characteristic frequency related only to the nuclear spins\nabundance and their collective polarization. We use this analysis to propose a\nnovel measurement method for the local nuclear spin bath of a single electronic\nspin. We quantify the realistic experimental regimes at which the scheme is\nefficient. Our proposal has potential applications for quantum sensing schemes,\nand opens a route for a systematic study of polarized mesoscopical-systems.\n", "  In this study, terahertz (THz) absorption and transmission of monolayer\nMoS$_{2}$ was calculated under different carrier concentrations. Results showed\nthat the THz absorption of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ is very small even under high\ncarrier concentrations and large incident angle. Equivalent loss of the THz\nabsorption is the total sum of reflection and absorption that is one to three\ngrades lower than that of graphene. The monolayer MoS$_{2}$ transmission is\nmuch larger than that of the traditional GaAs and InAs two-dimensional electron\ngas. The field-effect tubular structure formed by the monolayer\nMoS$_{2}$-insulation-layer-graphene is investigated. In this structure the THz\nabsorption of graphene to reach saturation under low voltage. Meantime, the\nmaximum THz absorption of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ was limited to approximately 5\\%.\nThus, monolayer MoS$_{2}$ is a kind of ideal THz Transparent Electrodes.\n", "  We investigate Yang-Lee zeros of grand partition functions as truncated\nfugacity polynomials of which coefficients are given by the canonical partition\nfunctions $Z(T,V,N)$ up to $N \\leq N_{\\text{max}}$. Such a partition function\ncan be inevitably obtained from the net-baryon number multiplicity distribution\nin relativistic heavy ion collisions, where the number of the event beyond\n$N_{\\text{max}}$ has insufficient statistics, as well as canonical approaches\nin lattice QCD. We use a chiral random matrix model as a solvable model for\nchiral phase transition in QCD and show that the closest edge of the\ndistribution to real chemical potential axis is stable against cutting the tail\nof the multiplicity distribution. The similar behavior is also found in lattice\nQCD at finite temperature for Roberge-Weiss transition. In contrast, such a\nstability is found to be absent in the Skellam distribution which does not have\nphase transition. We compare the number of $N_{\\text{max}}$ to obtain the\nstable Yang-Lee zeros with those of critical higher order cumulants.\n", "  Hamiltonian integration methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are\ndeveloped by a Hamiltonian splitting technique. The Hamiltonian functional is\nsplit into five parts, i.e., the electrical energy, the magnetic energy, and\nthe kinetic energy in three Cartesian components. Each of the subsystems is a\nHamiltonian system with respect to the Morrison-Marsden-Weinstein Poisson\nbracket and can be solved exactly. Compositions of the exact solutions yield\nPoisson structure preserving, or Hamiltonian, integration methods for the\nVlasov-Maxwell equations, which have superior long-term fidelity and accuracy.\n", "  We study a class of two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric gauge theories,\ngiven by semichiral multiplets coupled to the standard vector multiplet. In the\nUV, these theories are traditional gauge theories deformed by a gauged\nWess-Zumino term. In the IR, they give rise to nonlinear sigma models on\nnoncompact generalized K\\\"ahler manifolds, which contain a three-form flux H\nand whose metric is not K\\\"ahler. We place these theories on S^2 and compute\ntheir partition function exactly with localization techniques. We find that the\ncontribution of instantons to the partition function that we define is\ninsensitive to the deformation, and discuss our results from the point of view\nof the generalized K\\\"ahler target space.\n", "  A recently obtained set of the equations for leading-order (3+1)D anisotropic\nhydrodynamics is tested against exact solutions of the Boltzmann equation with\nthe collisional kernel treated in the relaxation time approximation. In order\nto perform the detailed comparisons, the new anisotropic hydrodynamics\nequations are reduced to the boost-invariant and transversally homogeneous\ncase. The agreement with the exact solutions found using the new anisotropic\nhydrodynamics equations is similar to that found using previous, less general,\nformulations of anisotropic hydrodynamics. In addition, we find that, when\ncompared to a state-of-the-art second-order viscous hydrodynamics framework,\nleading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics better reproduces the exact solution\nfor the pressure anisotropy and gives comparable results for the bulk pressure\nevolution. Finally, we compare the transport coefficients obtained using\nlinearized anisotropic hydrodynamics with results obtained using second-order\nviscous hydrodynamics.\n", "  Owing to their thermal emission, tidal disruption events (TDEs) were\nregularly detected in the soft X-rays and sometimes in the optical. Only a few\nTDEs have been detected at hard X-rays: two are high redshift beamed events,\none of which occurred at the core of a nearby galaxy, and the most recent one\nis of a different nature, involving a compact object in the Milky Way. The aims\nof this work are to obtain a first sample of hard X-ray-selected unbeamed TDEs,\nto determine their frequency and to probe whether TDEs usually or exceptionally\nemit at hard X-ray energies. We performed extensive searches for hard X-ray\nflares at positions in over 53000 galaxies, up to a distance of 100 Mpc in the\nSwift BAT archive. Light curves were extracted and parametrized. The quiescent\nhard X-ray emission was used to exclude persistently active galactic nuclei.\nSignificant flares from non-active galaxies were derived and checked for\npossible contamination. We found a sample of nine TDE candidates, which\ntranslates into a rate of $2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,{\\rm galaxy}^{-1}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$\nabove the BAT detection limit. This rate is consistent with those observed by\nXMM-Newton at soft X-rays and in the optical from SDSS observations, and is as\nexpected from simulations. We conclude that hard X-ray emission should be\nubiquitous in un-beamed TDEs and that electrons should be accelerated in their\naccretion flow.\n", "  We study the electronic and magnetic structures of the newly-discovered\ncompound KCr$_3$As$_3$. The non-magnetic state has five Fermi surface sheets\ninvolving respectively three quasi-one-dimensional and two three-dimensional\nenergy bands. However, the ground state is magnetic, exhibiting a novel\ninterlayer antiferromagnetic order where the basic block-spin state of a unit\nCr triangle retains a high spin magnitude. Moreover, its Fermi surface involves\nthree one-dimensional sheets only, providing evidence for local moments in this\ncompound due to the reduced dimensionality. By fitting a twisted spin tube\nmodel the magnetic frustrations caused by local moments are found to be\nrelaxed, leading to gapless spin excitations. A frustration-induced transition\nto the disordered low block-spin state is expected upon increasing the\nintralayer exchange interaction.\n", "  In this paper we study the solution space structure of model RB, a standard\nprototype of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs) with growing domains. Using\nrigorous the first and the second moment method, we show that in the solvable\nphase close to the satisfiability transition, solutions are clustered into\nexponential number of well-separated clusters, with each cluster contains\nsub-exponential number of solutions. As a consequence, the system has a\nclustering (dynamical) transition but no condensation transition. This picture\nof phase diagram is different from other classic random CSPs with fixed domain\nsize, such as random K-Satisfiability (K-SAT) and graph coloring problems,\nwhere condensation transition exists and is distinct from satisfiability\ntransition. Our result verifies the non-rigorous results obtained using cavity\nmethod from spin glass theory, and sheds light on the structures of solution\nspaces of problems with a large number of states.\n", "  Currently, no light source exists which is both narrow-band and speckle-free\nwith sufficient brightness for full-field imaging applications. Light emitting\ndiodes (LEDs) are excellent spatially incoherent sources, but are tens of\nnanometers broad. Lasers on the other hand can produce very narrow-band light,\nbut suffer from high spatial coherence which leads to speckle patterns which\ndistort the image. Here we propose the use of random Raman laser emission as a\nnew kind of light source capable of providing short-pulsed narrow-band\nspeckle-free illumination for imaging applications.\n", "  The Hofstadter energy spectrum provides a uniquely tunable system to study\nemergent topological order in the regime of strong interactions. Previous\nexperiments, however, have been limited to the trivial case of low Bloch band\nfilling where only the Landau level index plays a significant role. Here we\nreport measurement of high mobility graphene superlattices where the complete\nunit cell of the Hofstadter spectrum is accessible. We observe coexistence of\nconventional fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) states together with the\ninteger QHE states associated with the fractal Hofstadter spectrum. At large\nmagnetic field, a new series of states appear at fractional Bloch filling\nindex. These fractional Bloch band QHE states are not anticipated by existing\ntheoretical pictures and point towards a new type of many-body state.\n", "  We analyze the magnetic form factor of Cu$^{2+}$ in low-dimensional quantum\nmagnets by taking the metal-ligand hybridization into account explicitly. In\nthis analysis we use the form of magnetic Wannier orbitals, derived from the\nfirst-principles calculations, and identify the contributions of different\natomic sites. Having performed local density approximation calculations for\ncuprates with different types of ligand atoms, we discuss the influence of the\non-site Coulomb correlations on the structure of the magnetic orbital. The\ntypical composition of Wannier functions for copper oxides, chlorides and\nbromides is defined and related to features of the magnetic form factor. We\npropose easy-to-use approximations of the partial orbital contributions to the\nmagnetic form factor in order to give a microscopic explanation for the results\nobtained in previous first-principles studies.\n", "  We investigate T-duality of a closed string moving in a weakly curved\nbackground of the second order. A previously discussed weakly curved background\nconsisted of a flat metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond\nfield with an infinitesimal strength. The background here considered differs\nfrom the above in a coordinate dependent metric of the second order.\nConsequently, the corresponding Ricci tensor is nonzero. As this background\ndoes not posses the global shift symmetry the generalized Buscher T-dualization\nprocedure is not applicable to it. We redefine it and make it applicable to\nbackgrounds without the global symmetry.\n", "  We propose a parametrization for intepreting some of the presently available\ndata of the $B^{\\pm} \\to K^{\\pm} p {\\bar p}$ decay, in particular those by LHCb\nand Belle collaborations. The model is inspired by the well-known current and\ntransition contributions, usually assumed in this kind of decay. However, in\nthe light of considerations about the dominant graphs and about final state\ninteractions, we modify some parameters of the model, determining them by means\nof a best fit to data. We show the results, which we discuss in some detail.\nMoreover we give some predictions on other observables relative to the decays.\n", "  The Encircled Energy Fraction and its quantiles, notably the Half Energy\nWidth, are routinely used to characterize the quality of X-ray optical systems.\nThey are however always quoted without a statistical error. We show how\nnon-parametric statistical methods can be used to redress this situation, and\nwe discuss how the knowledge of the statistical error can be used to speed up\nthe characterization efforts for future X-ray observatories.\n", "  We consider here the effects of inertia on the instability of a flat liquid\nfilm under the effects of capillary and intermolecular forces (van der Waals\ninteraction). Firstly, we perform the linear stability analysis within the long\nwave approximation, which shows that the inclusion of inertia does not produce\nnew regions of instability other than the one previously known from the usual\nlubrication case. The wavelength, $\\lambda_m$, corresponding to he maximum\ngrowth, $\\omega_m$, and the critical (marginal) wavelength do not change at\nall. The most affected feature of the instability under an increase of the\nLaplace number is the noticeable decrease of the growth rates of the unstable\nmodes. In order to put in evidence the effects of the bidimensional aspects of\nthe flow (neglected in the long wave approximation), we also calculate the\ndispersion relation of the instability from the linearized version of the\ncomplete Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation. Unlike the long wave approximation, the\nbidimensional model shows that $\\lambda_m$ can vary significantly with inertia\nwhen the aspect ratio of the film is not sufficiently small. We also perform\nnumerical simulations of the nonlinear N-S equations and analyze to which\nextent the linear predictions can be applied depending on both the amount of\ninertia involved and the aspect ratio of the film.\n", "  We studied structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a cubic\nperovskite BaFeO$_{3-\\delta}$ ($0 \\le \\delta \\le 0.5$) within the density\nfunctional theory using a generalized gradient approximation and a GGA+U\nmethod. According to our calculations, BaFeO$_3$ in its stoichiometric cubic\nstructure should be half-metallic and strongly ferromagnetic, with extremely\nhigh Curie temperature ($T_C$) of 700 - 900 K. However, a such estimate of\n$T_C$ disagrees with all available experiments, which report that $T_C$ of the\nBaFeO$_3$ and undoped BaFeO$_{3-\\delta}$ films varies between 111 K and 235 K\nor, alternatively, that no ferromagnetic order was detected there. Fitting the\ncalculated x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra to the experimental\nfeatures seen for BaFeO$_3$, we concluded that the presence of oxygen vacancies\nin our model enables a good agreement. Thus, the relatively low $T_C$ measured\nin BaFeO$_3$ can be explained by oxygen vacancies intrinsically presented in\nthe material. Since iron species near the O vacancy change their oxidation\nstate from $4+$ to $3+$, the interaction between Fe$^{4+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$, which\nis antiferromagnetic, weakens the effective magnetic interaction in the system,\nwhich is predominantly ferromagnetic. With increasing $\\delta$ in\nBaFeO$_{3-\\delta}$, its $T_C$ decreases down to the critical value when the\nmagnetic order becomes antiferromagnetic. Our calculations of the electronic\nstructure of BaFeO$_{3-\\delta}$ illustrate how the ferromagnetism originates\nand also how one can keep this cubic perovskite robustly ferromagnetic far\nabove the room temperature.\n", "  Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that few-MeV\nelectrons can be produced by focusing tightly few-cycle radially-polarized\nlaser pulses in a low-density atomic gas. In particular, it is observed that\nfor the few-TW laser power needed to reach relativistic electron energies,\nlongitudinal attosecond microbunching occurs naturally, resulting in\nfemtosecond structures with high-contrast attosecond density modulations. The\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that in the relativistic\nregime the leading pulse of these attosecond substructures survives to\npropagation over extended distances, suggesting that it could be delivered to a\ndistant target, with the help of a properly designed transport beamline.\n", "  An ultracold Fermi atomic gas at unitarity presents universal properties that\nin the diluted limit can be well described by a contact interaction. By\nemploying a guide function with correct boundary conditions and making simple\nmodifications to the sampling procedure we are able to handle for the first\ntime a true contact interaction in a quantum Monte Carlo calculation. The\nresults are obtained with small variances. Our calculations for the Bertsch and\ncontact parameters are in excellent agreement with published experiments. The\npossibility of using a more faithfully description of ultracold atomic gases\ncan help uncover features yet unknown of the ultracold atomic gases. In\naddition, this work paves the way to perform quantum Monte Carlo calculations\nfor systems interacting with contact interactions, where in many cases the\ndescription using potentials with finite effective range might not be accurate.\n", "  Motivated by recent discovery of strongly spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional\n(2D) electron gas near the surface of Rashba semiconductors BiTeX (X=Cl, Br,\nI), we calculate thermoelectric responses of spin polarization in 2D Rashba\nmodel using an exact solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for elastic\nscattering. When the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ lies below the band crossing point we\nfind a non-Edelstein electric-field induced spin polarization which is linear\nin $E_{F}$. We show that the Mott-like relation between spin polarizations\ninduced by the temperature gradient and electric field breaks down\nsignificantly when $E_{F}$ lies in the vicinity of the band crossing point. As\nthe temperature tends to zero, the temperature-gradient induced spin\npolarization vanishes. These results differ from previous ones obtained by\nrelaxation time approximations.\n", "  We have considered an equilibrium ensemble of large Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi\ntopological random networks with fixed vertex degree and two types of vertices,\nblack and white, prepared randomly with the bond connection probability, $p$.\nThe network energy is a sum of all unicolor triples (either black or white),\nweighted with chemical potential of triples, $\\mu$. Minimizing the system\nenergy, we see for some positive $\\mu$ formation of two predominantly unicolor\nclusters, linked by a \"string\" of $N_{bw}$ black-white bonds. We have\ndemonstrated that the system exhibits critical behavior manifested in emergence\nof a wide plateau on the $N_{bw}(\\mu)$-curve, which is relevant to a spinodal\ndecomposition in 1st order phase transitions. In terms of a string theory, the\nplateau formation can be interpreted as an entanglement between baby-universes\nin 2D gravity. We have conjectured that observed classical phenomenon can be\nconsidered as a toy model for the chiral condensate formation in quantum\nchromodynamics.\n", "  We study theoretically the effects of pump-spot size and location on photon\ncondensates. By exploring the inhomogeneous molecular excitation fraction, we\nmake clear the relation between spatial equilibration, gain clamping and\nthermalization in a photon condensate. This provides a simple understanding of\nseveral recent experimental results. We find that as thermalization breaks\ndown, gain clamping is imperfect, leading to \"transverse spatial hole burning\"\nand multimode condensation. This opens the possibility of engineering the gain\nprofile to control the condensate structure.\n", "  Fractals such as the Cantor set can be equipped with intrinsic arithmetic\noperations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) that map the\nfractal into itself. The arithmetics allows one to define calculus and algebra\nintrinsic to the fractal in question, and one can formulate classical and\nquantum physics within the fractal set. In particular, fractals in space-time\ncan be generated by means of homogeneous spaces associated with appropriate Lie\ngroups. The construction is illustrated by explicit examples.\n", "  Broadband single photons are usually considered not to couple efficiently to\natomic gases because of the large mismatch in bandwidth. Contrary to this\nintuitive picture, here we demonstrate that the interaction of ultrashort\nsingle photons with a dense resonant atomic sample deeply modifies the temporal\nshape of their wavepacket mode without degrading their non-classical character,\nand effectively generates zero-area single-photon pulses. This is a clear\nsignature of strong transient coupling between single broadband (THz-level)\nlight quanta and atoms, with intriguing fundamental implications and possible\nnew applications to the storage of quantum information.\n", "  A new measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_{\\mu}\n\\equiv (g-2)/2$, will be performed at the Fermi National Accelerator\nLaboratory. The most recent measurement, performed at Brookhaven National\nLaboratory and completed in 2001, shows a 3.3-3.6 standard deviation\ndiscrepancy with the Standard Model predictions for $a_\\mu$. The new\nmeasurement will accumulate 21 times those statistics, measuring $a_\\mu$ to 140\nppb and reducing the uncertainty by a factor of 4.\n  The data acquisition system for this experiment must have the ability to\nrecord deadtime-free records from 700 $\\mu$s muon spills at a raw data rate of\n18 GB per second. Data will be collected using 1296 channels of $\\mu$TCA-based\n800 MSPS, 12 bit waveform digitizers and processed in a layered array of\nnetworked commodity processors with 24 GPUs working in parallel to perform a\nfast recording and processing of detector signals during the spill. The system\nwill be controlled using the MIDAS data acquisition software package. The\ndescribed data acquisition system is currently being constructed, and will be\nfully operational before the start of the experiment in 2017.\n", "  We observe chimeralike states in an ensemble of oscillators using a type of\nglobal coupling consisting of two components: attractive and repulsive\nmean-field feedback. We identify existence of two types of chimeralike states\nin a bistable Li\\'{e}nard system; in one type, both the coherent and the\nincoherent populations are in chaotic states (called as chaos-chaos chimeralike\nstates) and, in another type, the incoherent population is in periodic state\nwhile the coherent population has irregular small oscillation. Interestingly,\nwe also recorded a metastable state in a parameter regime of the Li\\'{e}nard\nsystem where the coherent and noncoherent states migrates from one to another\npopulation. To test the generality of the coupling configuration, we present\nanother example of bistable system, the van der Pol-Duffing system where the\nchimeralike states are observed, however, the coherent population is periodic\nor quasiperiodic and the incoherent population is of chaotic in nature.\nFurthermore, we apply the coupling to a network of chaotic R\u007f\\\"ossler system\nwhere we find the chaos-chaos chimeralike states.\n", "  We describe a one-parameter family of new holographic RG flows that start\nfrom $AdS_4 \\times S^7$ and go to $\\widehat{AdS_5} \\times {\\cal B}_6$, where\n${\\cal B}_6$ is conformal to a K\\\"ahler manifold and $\\widehat{AdS_5}$ is\nPoincar\\'e $AdS_5$ with one spatial direction compactified and fibered over\n${\\cal B}_6$. The new solutions \"flow up dimensions,\" going from the\n$(2+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory on M2 branes in the UV to a\n$(3+1)$-dimensional field theory on intersecting M5 branes in the infra-red.\nThe M2 branes completely polarize into M5 branes along the flow and the\nPoincar\\'e sections of the $\\widehat{AdS_5}$ are the $(3+1)$-dimensional common\nintersection of the M5 branes. The emergence of the extra dimension in the\ninfra-red suggests a new strongly-coupled phase of the M2 brane and ABJM\ntheories in which charged solitons are becoming massless. The flow solution is\nfirst analyzed by finding a four-dimensional $N \\! = \\! 2$ supersymmetric flow\nin $N \\! = \\! 8$ gauged supergravity. This is then generalized to a one\nparameter family of non-supersymmetric flows. The infra-red limit of the\nsolutions appears to be quite singular in four dimensions but the uplift to\neleven-dimensional supergravity is remarkable and regular (up to orbifolding).\nOur construction is a non-trivial application of the recently derived uplift\nformulae for fluxes, going well beyond the earlier constructions of stationary\npoints solutions. The eleven-dimensional supersymmetry is also analyzed and\nshows how, for the supersymmetric flow, the M2-brane supersymmetry in the UV is\npolarized entirely into M5-brane supersymmetry in the infra-red.\n", "  Twisted magnetic fields should be ubiquitous in flare-producing active\nregions where the magnetic fields are strongly non-potential. It has been shown\nthat reconnection in helical magnetic coronal loops results in plasma heating\nand particle acceleration distributed within a large volume, including the\nlower coronal and chromospheric sections of the loops. This scenario can be an\nalternative to the standard flare model, where particles are accelerated only\nin a small volume located in the upper corona. We use a combination of MHD\nsimulations and test-particle methods, which describe the development of kink\ninstability and magnetic reconnection in twisted coronal loops using resistive\ncompressible MHD, and incorporate atmospheric stratification and large-scale\nloop curvature. The resulting distributions of hot plasma let us estimate\nthermal X-ray emission intensities. The electric and magnetic fields obtained\nare used to calculate electron trajectories using the guiding-centre\napproximation. These trajectories combined with the MHD plasma density\ndistributions let us deduce synthetic HXR bremsstrahlung intensities. Our\nsimulations emphasise that the geometry of the emission patterns produced by\nhot plasma in flaring twisted coronal loops can differ from the actual geometry\nof the underlying magnetic fields. The twist angles revealed by the emission\nthreads (SXR) are consistently lower than the field-line twist present at the\nonset of the kink-instability. HXR emission due to the interaction of energetic\nelectrons with the stratified background are concentrated at the loop\nfoot-points in these simulations, even though the electrons are accelerated\neverywhere within the coronal volume of the loop. The maximum of HXR emission\nconsistently precedes that of SXR emission, with the HXR light-curve being\napproximately proportional to the temporal derivative of the SXR light-curve.\n", "  For a ultrathin NiO(001) film of 4 monolayers (ML) thickness grown on\nAg(001), the vibrational properties have been determined by high-resolution\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). For the well-ordered\npseudomorphically grown film, nine phonon modes have been identified and their\ndispersions have been revealed along the Gamma-X high-symmetry direction. The\ncomparison with phonon data for a 25 ML thick NiO(001) film shows that the NiO\n(001) phonon properties are already fully developed at 4 ML. Significant\ndifferences are found for the surface-localized phonon S6 which has an\nincreased dispersion for the ultrathin film. The dipole-active Fuchs-Kliewer\nphonon-polariton exhibits a narrower lineshape than the mode found for a\nsingle-crystal surface, which might hint to a reduced antiferromagnetic\ncoupling in the ultrathin film.\n", "  In the present study we investigate magnetic reconnection in twisted magnetic\nfluxtubes with different initial configurations. In all considered cases,\nenergy release is triggered by the ideal kink instability, which is itself the\nresult of applying footpoint rotation to an initially potential field. The main\ngoal of this work is to establish the influence of the field topology and\nvarious thermodynamic effects on the energy release process. Specifically, we\ninvestigate convergence of the magnetic field at the loop footpoints,\natmospheric stratification, as well as thermal conduction. In all cases, the\napplication of vortical driving at the footpoints of an initally potential\nfield leads to an internal kink instability. With the exception of the curved\nloop with high footpoint convergence, the global geometry of the loop change\nlittle during the simulation. Footpoint convergence, curvature and atmospheric\nstructure clearly influences the rapidity with which a loop achieves\ninstability as well as the size of the subsequent energy release. Footpoint\nconvergence has a stabilising influence and thus the loop requires more energy\nfor instability, which means that the subsequent relaxation has a larger\nheating effect. Large-scale curvature has the opposite result: less energy is\nneeded for instability and so the amount of energy released from the field is\nreduced. Introducing a stratified atmosphere gives rise to decaying wave\nphenomena during the driving phase, and also results in a loop that is less\nstable.\n", "  Flow of a thin viscous film down a flat inclined plane becomes unstable to\nlong wave interfacial fluctuations when the Reynolds number based on the mean\nfilm thickness becomes larger than a critical value (this value decreases as\nthe angle of inclination with the horizontal increases, and in particular\nbecomes zero when the plate is vertical). Control of these interfacial\ninstabilities is relevant to a wide range of industrial applications including\ncoating processes and heat or mass transfer systems. This study considers the\neffect of blowing and suction through the substrate in order to construct from\nfirst principles physically realistic models that can be used for detailed\npassive and active control studies of direct relevance to possible experiments.\nTwo different long-wave, thin-film equations are derived to describe this\nsystem; these include the imposed blowing/suction as well as inertia, surface\ntension, gravity and viscosity. The case of spatially periodic blowing and\nsuction is considered in detail and the bifurcation structure of forced steady\nstates is explored numerically to predict that steady states cease to exist for\nsufficiently large suction speeds since the film locally thins to zero\nthickness giving way to dry patches on the substrate. The linear stability of\nthe resulting nonuniform steady states is investigated for perturbations of\narbitrary wavelengths, and any instabilities are followed into the fully\nnonlinear regime using time-dependent computations. The case of small amplitude\nblowing/suction is studied analytically both for steady states and their\nstability. Finally, the transition between travelling waves and non-uniform\nsteady states is explored as the suction amplitude increases.\n", "  Treating the gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak and\nstrong forces, we present a quantum field theory of gravity based on spin and\nscaling gauge symmetries. A biframe spacetime is initiated to describe such a\nquantum gravity theory. The gravifield sided on both locally flat noncoordinate\nspacetime and globally flat Minkowski spacetime is an essential ingredient for\ngauging global spin and scaling symmetries. The locally flat gravifield\nspacetime spanned by the gravifield is associated with a noncommutative\ngeometry characterized by a gauge-type field strength of the gravifield. A\ncoordinate-independent and gauge-invariant action for the quantum gravity is\nbuilt in the gravifield basis. In the coordinate basis, we derive equations of\nmotion for all quantum fields including the gravitational effect and obtain\nbasic conservation laws for all symmetries. The equation of motion for\ngravifield tensor is deduced in connection directly with the total\nenergy-momentum tensor. When the spin and scaling gauge symmetries are broken\ndown to a background structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling\nsymmetries, we obtain exact solutions by solving equations of motion for the\nbackground fields in a unitary basis. The massless graviton and massive spinon\nresult as physical quantum degrees of freedom. The resulting Lorentz-invariant\nand conformally flat background gravifield space-time is characterized by a\ncosmic vector with a nonzero cosmological mass scale. The conformal size of the\nUniverse becomes singular at the cosmological horizon and turns out to be\ninflationary. A mechanism for quantum inflation is demonstrated to generate the\ninflation of the early Universe. Two types of gravity equation result, one is\nas the extension to Einstein's equation of general relativity, and the other is\na new one that characterizes spinon dynamics.\n", "  Classical age-structured mass-action models such as the McKendrick-von\nFoerster equation have been extensively studied but they are structurally\nunable to describe stochastic fluctuations or population-size-dependent birth\nand death rates. Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent\nprocesses using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a\npopulation's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size\ndependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent\npopulation dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity\nsuch as the Logistic equation) cannot be easily extended to take into account\nage-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic\nderivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting\nage-structured populations. By defining multiparticle probability density\nfunctions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic\nevolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the\nfully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of\nthe corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a\nBBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple\nlimits and compared with their corresponding mean-field results. Our results\ngeneralize both deterministic models and existing master equation approaches by\nproviding an intuitive and efficient way to simultaneously model age- and\npopulation-dependent stochastic dynamics applicable to the study of demography,\nstem cell dynamics, and disease evolution.\n", "  Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) based solar cells have shown\nimpressive power conversion efficiencies of above 20%. However, the microscopic\nmechanism of the high photovoltaic performance is yet to be fully understood.\nParticularly, the dynamics of CH3NH3+ cations and their impact on relevant\nprocesses such as charge recombination and exciton dissociation are still\npoorly understood. Here, using elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering\ntechniques and group theoretical analysis, we studied rotational modes of the\nCH3NH3+ cation in CH3NH3PbI3. Our results show that, in the cubic (T > 327K)\nand tetragonal (165K < T < 327K) phases, the CH3NH3+ ions exhibit four-fold\nrotational symmetry of the C-N axis (C4) along with three-fold rotation around\nthe C-N axis (C3), while in orthorhombic phase (T < 165K) only C3 rotation is\npresent. Around room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times for the\nC4 rotation is found to be ps while for the C3 rotation ps. The -dependent\nrotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain\nactivation energies. Our data show a close correlation between the C4\nrotational mode and the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity. Our\nfindings on the rotational dynamics of CH3NH3+ and the associated dipole have\nimportant implications on understanding the low exciton binding energy and slow\ncharge recombination rate in CH3NH3PbI3 which are directly relevant for the\nhigh solar cell performance.\n", "  Electromagnetic waves are ideal candidates for transmitting information in a\nquantum network as they can be routed rapidly and efficiently between locations\nusing optical fibers or microwave cables. Yet linking quantum-enabled devices\nwith cables has proved difficult because most cavity or circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics (cQED) systems used in quantum information processing can only\nabsorb and emit signals with a specific frequency and temporal envelope. Here\nwe show that the temporal and spectral content of microwave-frequency\nelectromagnetic signals can be arbitrarily manipulated with a flexible aluminum\ndrumhead embedded in a microwave circuit. The aluminum drumhead simultaneously\nforms a mechanical oscillator and a tunable capacitor. This device offers a way\nto build quantum microwave networks using separate and otherwise mismatched\ncomponents. Furthermore, it will enable the preparation of non-classical states\nof motion by capturing non-classical microwave signals prepared by the most\ncoherent circuit QED systems.\n", "  The worldwide need to replace 3He for the neutron detection has triggered R&D\non new technologies and methods. A promising one is based on commercial solid\nstate silicon detectors coupled with thin neutron converter layers containing\n6Li. After proving the feasibility of this technique, we characterized the\nbehavior of such a detector with different converter layer thicknesses. In this\npaper we also disentangle other contributions to the overall spectrum shape\nobserved with this kind of detector, proving that its detection efficiency can\nbe made reasonably high and that the gamma/neutron discrimination capability is\ncomparable to the one of 3He tubes.\n", "  Formation dynamics of the nanojets and nanocrowns induced on the surface of\nthe Cu supported films of different thickness under the impact of tightly\nfocused femtosecond pulses was studied in detail. We show that the single-shot\nfs-pulse irradiation of the 120-nm-thick Cu film results in formation of a\nsingle nanojet, which splits at increased pulse energy into two and then into a\nplurality of periodically arranged nanospikes eventually acquiring the form of\nthe so-called nanocrown. The number of nanospike in the nanocrown was found to\nbe linearly dependent on the pulse energy and nanocrown radius. The key role of\nsubsurface boiling occurring on the metal film-substrate interface in the\nformation process of crown-like nanostructures was revealed by comparing the\nobtained results with the formation dynamics studied for thinner 60-nm and\n20-nm-thick Cu films. In addition, the applicability of the fabricated\nnanostructures as low-cost substrate for photoluminescence signal enhancement\nof the organic dyes is also discussed in this paper.\n", "  Laser induced ultrafast demagnetization is the process whereby the magnetic\nmoment of a ferromagnetic material is seen to drop significantly on a timescale\nof $10-100$s of femtoseconds due to the application of a strong laser pulse. If\nthis phenomenon can be harnessed for future technology, it offers the\npossibility for devices operating at speeds several orders of magnitude faster\nthan at present. A key component to successful transfer of such a process to\ntechnology is the controllability of the process, i.e. that it can be tuned in\norder to overcome the practical and physical limitations imposed on the system.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-orbit mediated form of ultrafast\ndemagnetization recently investigated [arXiv:1406.6607] by ab-initio\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can be controlled. To do so we\nuse quantum optimal control theory (OCT) to couple our TDDDT simulations to the\noptimization machinery of OCT. We show that a laser pulse can be found which\nmaximizes the loss of moment within a given time interval while subject to\nseveral practical and physical constraints. Furthermore we also include a\nconstraint on the fluence of the laser pulses and find the optimal pulse that\ncombines significant demagnetization with a desire for less powerful pulses.\nThese calculations demonstrate optimal control is possible for spin-orbit\nmediated ultrafast demagnetization and lay the foundation for future\noptimizations/simulations which can incorporate even more constraints.\n", "  We test the ability of large scale velocity fields inferred from geomagnetic\nsecular variation data to produce the global magnetic field of the Earth.Our\nkinematic dynamo calculations use quasi-geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from\ngeomagnetic field models which, as such, incorporate flow structures that are\nEarth-like and may be important for the geodynamo.Furthermore, the QG\nhypothesis allows straightforward prolongation of the flow from the core\nsurface to the bulk.As expected from previous studies, we check that a simple\nquasi-geostrophic flow is not able to sustain the magnetic field against ohmic\ndecay.Additional complexity is then introduced in the flow, inspired by the\naction of the Lorentz force.Indeed, on centenial time-scales, the Lorentz force\ncan balance the Coriolis force and strict quasi-geostrophy may not be the best\nansatz.When the columnar flow is modified to account for the action of the\nLorentz force, magnetic field is generated for Elsasser numbers larger than\n0.25 and magnetic Reynolds numbers larger than 100.This suggests that our large\nscale flow captures the relevant features for the generation of the Earth's\nmagnetic field and that the invisible small scale flow may not be directly\ninvolved in this process.Near the threshold, the resulting magnetic field is\ndominated by an axial dipole, with some reversed flux patches.Time-dependence\nis also considered, derived from principal component analysis applied to the\ninverted flows.We find that time periods from 120 to 50 years do not affect the\nmean growth rate of the kinematic dynamos.Finally we notice the footprint of\nthe inner-core in the magnetic field generated deep in the bulk of the shell,\nalthough we did not include one in our computations.\n", "  We detect variability of the Fe Ka emission line in the spectrum of X-ray\npulsar 4U 1626-67, correlated with changes in its luminosity and in the shape\nof its pulse profile. Analysis of archival Chandra and RXTE observations\nrevealed the presence of an intrinsically narrow Fe Ka emission line in the\nspectrum obtained during the source's current high luminosity period. However,\nthe line was not present during an XMM-Newton observation seven years earlier,\nwhen the source was ~three times fainter. The line is resolved by the high\nenergy grating of Chandra at the 98% confidence level, and its small intrinsic\nwidth, sigma=36.4 (-/+ 11.3,15.3)eV, suggests reflection off an accretion disk\nat the radius R~7.5(-/+ 3.8,8.2)x10^8cm assuming a Keplerian disk, viewed at an\ninclination angle of 20deg. This value is consistent with the radius of the\nmagnetosphere of the pulsar, suggesting that the line originates near the inner\nedge of a disk that is truncated by the magnetic field of the neutron star.\nTiming analysis of the XMM-Newton and RXTE data revealed a major change in the\npulse profile of the source from a distinct double peaked shape during the high\nluminosity state when the line was present, to a much more complex multi-peak\nstructure during the low luminosity state. We argue that the appearance of the\nline and the change in the shape of the pulse profile are correlated and are\nthe result of a major change in the emission diagram of the accretion column,\nfrom a pencil-beam pattern at low luminosity, to a fan-beam pattern at high\nluminosity.\n", "  Nanodot deposition on a side surface of a rectangular sample and digital\nimage correlation are used to quantify the in-plane strain fields associated\nwith the propagation of a shear band in a PdNiP bulk metallic glass,induced by\nrolling. Within the resolution of the method related to an average inter-dot\ndistance of 100 nm, deformation is found to be highly localized at the shear\nbands, while alternating areas with a size of 100 - 400 nm with opposite local\nshear strains are found. This phenomenon substantiates a local stick-slip\nnature of shear band propagation during the metallic glass deformation, even\nduring rolling.\n", "  The effective-surface approximation is extended taking into account\nderivatives of the symmetry-energy density per particle with respect to the\nmean particle density. The isoscalar and isovector particle densities in this\nextended effective-surface approximation are derived. The improved expressions\nof the surface symmetry energy, in particular, its surface tension coefficients\nin the sharp-edged proton-neutron asymmetric nuclei take into account important\ngradient terms of the energy density functional. For most Skyrme forces the\nsurface symmetry-energy constants and the corresponding neutron skins and\nisovector stiffnesses are calculated as functions of the Swiatecki derivative\nof the nongradient term of the symmetry-energy density per particle with\nrespect to the isoscalar density. Using the analytical isovector surface-energy\nconstants in the framework of the Fermi-liquid droplet model we find energies\nand sum rules of the isovector giant-dipole resonance structure in a reasonable\nagreement with the experimental data, and they are compared with other\ntheoretical approaches.\n", "  The fast decay of carrier inversion in photoexcited graphene has been\nattributed to optical phonon emission and Auger recombination. Plasmon emission\nprovides another pathway that, as we show here, drives the carrier relaxation\ndynamics on ultrafast timescales. In studying the nonequilibrium relaxation\ndynamics we find that plasmon emission effectively converts inversion into hot\ncarriers, whose energy is then extracted by optical phonon emission. This\nmechanism not only explains the observed fs-lifetime of inversion but also\noffers the prospect for atomically thin ultrafast plasmon emitters.\n", "  We study the behaviour of double-stranded RNA under twist and tension using\noxRNA, a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA. Introducing explicit\nsalt-dependence into the model allows us to directly compare our results to\ndata from recent single-molecule experiments. The model reproduces extension\ncurves as a function of twist and stretching force, including the buckling\ntransition and the behaviour of plectoneme structures. For negative\nsupercoiling, we predict denaturation bubble formation in plectoneme end-loops,\nsuggesting preferential plectoneme localisation in weak base sequences. OxRNA\nexhibits a positive twist-stretch coupling constant, in agreement with recent\nexperimental observations.\n", "  We test the hypothesis of non-radiative neutrinos decay using the latest\nIceCube data. Namely, we calculate the track-to-shower ratio expected in\nIceCube for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy taking into account\nthe uncertainties in neutrino oscillation parameters. We show that the subset\nof data with energy above 60 TeV actually excludes the possibility of a\nneutrinos decay at the 1 sigma level of significance for both neutrino mass\nhierarchies.\n", "  We construct the gravitational energy-momentum tensor in general relativity\nthrough the Noether theorem. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that the\nconstructed quantity can vary as a tensor under the general coordinate\ntransformation. Furthermore, we verify that the energy-momentum conservation is\nsatisfied because one of the two indices of the energy-momentum tensor should\nbe in the local Lorentz frame. It is also shown that the gravitational energy\nand the matter one cancel out in certain space-times.\n", "  The top quark is the heaviest of all known elementary particles. It was\ndiscovered in 1995 by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron. With the\nstart of the LHC in 2009, an unprecedented wealth of measurements of the top\nquark's production mechanisms and properties have been performed by the ATLAS\nand CMS collaborations, most of these resulting in smaller uncertainties than\nthose achieved previously. At the same time, huge progress was made on the\ntheoretical side yielding significantly improved predictions up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. Due to the vast amount of\nevents containing top quarks, a variety of new measurements became feasible and\nopened a new window to precisions tests of the Standard Model and to\ncontributions of new physics. In this review, originally written for a recent\nbook on the results of LHC Run 1, top-quark measurements obtained so far from\nthe LHC Run 1 are summarised and put in context with the current understanding\nof the Standard Model.\n", "  Rainfall from ice-free cumulus clouds requires collisions of large numbers of\nmicroscopic droplets to create every raindrop. The onset of rain showers can be\nsurprisingly rapid, much faster than the mean time required for a single\ncollision. Large-deviation theory is used to explain this observation.\n", "  The decorrelation of the orientation of the event-plane angles in the initial\nstate of relativistic Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions, the \"torque effect,\" is\nstudied in a model of entropy deposition in the longitudinal direction\ninvolving fluctuations of the longitudinal source profile on large scales. The\nradiation from a single wounded nucleon is asymmetric in space-time rapidity.\nIt is assumed that the extent in rapidity of the region of deposited entropy is\nrandom. Fluctuations in the deposition of entropy from each source increase the\nevent-plane decorrelation: for Pb-Pb collisions they improve the description of\nthe data, while for p-Pb collisions the mechanism is absolutely essential to\ngenerate any sizable decorrelation. We also show that the experimental data for\nrank-four flow may be explained via folding of the elliptic flow. The results\nsuggest the existence of long range fluctuations in the space-time distribution\nof entropy in the initial stages of relativistic nuclear collisions.\n", "  Microscopic relaxation timescales are estimated from the autocorrelation\nfunctions obtained by dynamic light scattering experiments for Laponite\nsuspensions with different concentrations ($C_{L}$), added salt concentrations\n($C_{S}$) and temperatures ($T$). It has been shown in an earlier work [Soft\nMatter, 10, 3292-3300 (2014)] that the evolutions of relaxation timescales of\ncolloidal glasses can be compared with molecular glass formers by mapping the\nwaiting time ($t_{w}$) of the former with the inverse of thermodynamic\ntemperature ($1/T$) of the latter. In this work, the fragility parameter $D$,\nwhich signifies the deviation from Arrhenius behavior, is obtained from fits to\nthe time evolutions of the structural relaxation timescales. For the Laponite\nsuspensions studied in this work, $D$ is seen to be independent of $C_{L}$ and\n$C_{S}$, but is weakly dependent on $T$. Interestingly, the behavior of $D$\ncorroborates the behavior of fragility in molecular glass formers with respect\nto equivalent variables. Furthermore, the stretching exponent $\\beta$, which\nquantifies the width $w$ of the spectrum of structural relaxation timescales is\nseen to depend on $t_{w}$. A hypothetical Kauzmann time $t_{k}$, analogous to\nthe Kauzmann temperature for molecular glasses, is defined as the timescale at\nwhich $w$ diverges. Corresponding to the Vogel temperature defined for\nmolecular glasses, a hypothetical Vogel time $t^{\\infty}_{\\alpha}$ is also\ndefined as the time at which the structural relaxation time diverges.\nInterestingly, a correlation is observed between $t_{k}$ and\n$t^{\\infty}_{\\alpha}$, which is remarkably similar to that known for fragile\nmolecular glass formers. A coupling model that accounts for the\n$t_{w}$-dependence of the stretching exponent is used to analyse and explain\nthe observed correlation between $t_{k}$ and $t^{\\infty}_{\\alpha}$.\n", "  We study a single impurity driven by a constant force through a 1D Bose gas\nusing a Lieb-Liniger based approach. Our calculaton is exact in the interaction\namongst the particles in the Bose gas, and is perturbative in the interaction\nbetween the gas and the impurity. In contrast to previous studies of this\nproblem, we are able to handle arbitrary interaction strength for the Bose gas.\nWe find very good agreement with recent experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,\n150601 (2009)].\n", "  We present here an analysis of the influence of the frequency dependence of\nthe Raman laser light shifts on the phase of a Raman-type atom gravimeter.\nFrequency chirps are applied to the Raman lasers in order to compensate gravity\nand ensure the resonance of the Raman pulses during the interferometer. We show\nthat the change in the Raman light shift when this chirp is applied only to one\nof the two Raman lasers is enough to bias the gravity measurement by a fraction\nof $\\mu$Gal ($1~\\mu$Gal~=~$10^{-8}$~m/s$^2$). We also show that this effect is\nnot compensated when averaging over the two directions of the Raman wavevector\n$k$. This thus constitutes a limit to the rejection efficiency of the\n$k$-reversal technique. Our analysis allows us to separate this effect from the\neffect of the finite speed of light, which we find in perfect agreement with\nexpected values. This study highlights the benefit of chirping symmetrically\nthe two Raman lasers.\n", "  Orbit determination is possible for a chaotic orbit of a dynamical system,\ngiven a finite set of observations, provided the initial conditions are at the\ncentral time. In a simple discrete model, the standard map, we tackle the\nproblem of chaotic orbit determination when observations extend beyond the\npredictability horizon. If the orbit is hyperbolic, a shadowing orbit is\ncomputed by the least squares orbit determination. We test both the convergence\nof the orbit determination iterative procedure and the behaviour of the\nuncertainties as a function of the maximum number $n$ of map iterations\nobserved. When the initial conditions belong to a chaotic orbit, the orbit\ndetermination is made impossible by numerical instability beyond a\ncomputability horizon, which can be approximately predicted by a simple\nformula. Moreover, the uncertainty of the results is sharply increased if a\ndynamical parameter is added to the initial conditions as parameter to be\nestimated. The uncertainty of the dynamical parameter decreases like $n^a$ with\n$a<0$ but not large (of the order of unity). If only the initial conditions are\nestimated, their uncertainty decreases exponentially with $n$. If they belong\nto a non-chaotic orbit the computational horizon is much larger, if it exists\nat all, and the decrease of the uncertainty is polynomial in all parameters,\nlike $n^a$ with $a\\simeq 1/2$. The Shadowing Lemma does not dictate what the\nasymptotic behaviour of the uncertainties should be. These phenomena have\nsignificant implications, which remain to be studied, in practical problems of\norbit determination involving chaos, such as the chaotic rotation state of a\ncelestial body and a chaotic orbit of a planet-crossing asteroid undergoing\nmany close approaches.\n", "  A successful description of hadron-hadron collision data demands a profound\nunderstanding of quantum chromodynamics. Inevitably, the complexity of\nstrong-interaction phenomena requires the use of a large variety of theoretical\ntechniques -- from perturbative cross-section calculations up to the modelling\nof exclusive hadronic final states. Together with the unprecedented precision\nof the data provided by the experiments in the first running period of the LHC,\na solid foundation of hadron-hadron collision physics at the TeV scale could be\nestablished that allowed the discovery of the Higgs boson and that is vital for\nestimating the background in searches for new phenomena. This chapter on\nstudies of quantum chromodynamics at the LHC is part of a recent book on the\nresults of LHC Run 1 and presents the advances in theoretical methods\nside-by-side with related key measurements in an integrated approach.\n", "  Two iron-chalcogenide superconductors Li(x)[C5H5N](y)Fe(2-z)Se2 and\nCs(x)Fe(2-z)Se2 in the as-prepared and annealed state have been investigated by\nmeans of the Moessbauer spectroscopy versus temperature. Multi-component\nspectra are obtained. One can see a non-magnetic component due to iron located\nin the unperturbed Fe-Se sheets responsible for superconductivity. Remaining\ncomponents are magnetically ordered even at room temperature. There is some\nmagnetically ordered iron in Fe-Se sheets perturbed by presence of the iron\nvacancies. Additionally, one can see iron dispersed between sheets in the form\nof magnetically ordered high spin trivalent ions, some clusters of above ions,\nand in the case of pyridine intercalated compound in the form of alpha-Fe\nprecipitates. Pyridine intercalated sample shows traces of superconductivity in\nthe as-prepared state, while cesium intercalated sample in the as-prepared\nstate does not show any superconductivity. Superconductors with transition\ntemperatures being 40 K and 25 K, respectively, are obtained upon annealing.\nAnnealing leads to removal/ordering of the iron vacancies within Fe-Se sheets,\nwhile clusters of alpha-Fe grow in the pyridine intercalated sample.\n", "  Imaging of the Bragg reflected x-ray beam is proposed and validated as an\nin-situ method for characterization of performance of double-crystal\nmonochromators under the heat load of intense synchrotron radiation. A sequence\nof images is collected at different angular positions on the reflectivity curve\nof the second crystal and analyzed. The method provides rapid evaluation of the\nwavefront of the exit beam, which relates to local misorientation of the\ncrystal planes along the beam footprint on the thermally distorted first\ncrystal. The measured misorientation can be directly compared to results of\nfinite element analysis. The imaging method offers an additional insight on the\nlocal intrinsic crystal quality over the footprint of the incident x-ray beam.\n", "  We have performed scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) study\nand first-principles calculations to investigate the atomic structure and\nelectronic properties of silicon nanoribbons (SiNRs) grown on Ag(110). Despite\nof the extensive research on SiNRs in the last decades, its atomic structure is\nstill not fully understood so far. In this report we determine that the\nstructure of SiNRs/Ag(110) is armchair silicene nanoribbon with reconstructed\nedges. Meanwhile, pronounced quantum well states (QWS) in SiNRs were observed\nand their energy spectrum was systematically measured. The QWS are due to the\nconfinement of quasiparticles perpendicular to the nanoribbon and can be well\nexplained by the theory of one-dimensional (1D) 'particle-in-a-box' model in\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  The problem of the lower bound on the radiation Q for an arbitrarily shaped\nfinite size antenna of non-zero volume is formulated in terms of equivalent\nelectric and magnetic currents densities distributed on a closed surface\ncoinciding with antenna exterior surface. When these equivalent currents\nradiate in free space, the magnetic current augments the electric current, so\nthat the fields interior to the surface vanish. In contrast to approaches based\nsolely on electric currents, the proposed technique ensures no stored energy\ninterior to the antenna exterior surface, and thus, allows the fundamental\nlower bound on Q to be determined. To facilitate the computation of the bound,\nnew expressions for the stored energy, radiated power, and Q of coupled\nelectric and magnetic source currents in free space are derived.\n", "  Thanks to its intrinsic ability to preserve spin coherence, graphene is a\nprime material for spintronics. In this review article, we summarize recent\nachievements related to spintronics in graphene quantum dots and motivate this\nfield from a spintronics and a materials science point of view. We focus on\ntheory but also discuss recent experiments. The main sources of spin\ndecoherence are interactions with lattice excitations and the hyperfine\ninteraction with present nuclear spins. We explain effective spin-phonon\ncoupling in detail and present a generic power law for the spin relaxation time\nT1 as a function of the magnetic field. For specific cases, we discuss spin\nrelaxation in detail. The Heisenberg exchange interaction is paramount for\ncoherent spin qubit operation and addressed in the context of magnetism in\ngraphene nano flakes. Nuclear spins in the host and surrounding material can be\nconsidered by several means and the influence of 13C nuclei has been studied in\ndetail. Impressive advances in general spintronics and the fabrication of\ngraphene devices are likely to spark significant advances in spintronics with\ngraphene quantum dots in the near future.\n", "  Dissolved oxygen in sea water is a major factor affecting marine habitats and\nbiogeochemical cycles. Oceanic zones with oxygen deficits represent significant\nportions of the area and volume of the oceans and are thought to be expanding.\nThe Peruvian oxygen minimum zone is one of the most pronounced and lies in a\nregion of strong mesoscale activity in the form of vortices and frontal\nregions, whose effect in the dynamics of the oxygen minimum zone is largely\nunknown. Here, we study this issue from a modeling approach and a Lagrangian\npoint of view, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical simulation of the\nPeruvian oxygen minimum zone and finite-size Lyapunov exponent fields to\nunderstand the link between mesoscale dynamics and oxygen variations. Our\nresults show that, at depths between 380 and 600 meters, mesoscale structures\nhave a relevant dual role. First, their mean positions and paths delimit and\nmaintain the oxygen minimum zone boundaries. Second, their high frequency\nfluctuations entrain oxygen across these boundaries as eddy fluxes that point\ntowards the interior of the oxygen minimum zone and are one order of magnitude\nlarger than mean fluxes. We conclude that these eddy fluxes contribute to the\nventilation of the oxygen minimum zone.\n", "  In this paper, a fermionic hierarchical model is defined, inspired by the\nKondo model, which describes a 1-dimensional lattice gas of spin-1/2 electrons\ninteracting with a spin-1/2 impurity. This model is proved to be exactly\nsolvable, and is shown to exhibit a Kondo effect, i.e. that, if the interaction\nbetween the impurity and the electrons is antiferromagnetic, then the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the impurity is finite in the 0-temperature limit, whereas it\ndiverges if the interaction is ferromagnetic. Such an effect is therefore\ninherently non-perturbative. This difficulty is overcome by using the exact\nsolvability of the model, which follows both from its fermionic and\nhierarchical nature.\n", "  We investigate the horizon structure and ergosphere in a rotating Bardeen\nregular black hole, which has an additional parameter ($g$) due to magnetic\ncharge, apart from mass ($M$) and rotation parameter ($a$). Interestingly, for\neach value of parameter $g$, there exist a critical rotation parameter\n($a=a_{E}$), which corresponds to an extremal black hole with degenerate\nhorizons, while for $a<a_{E}$ describes a non-extremal black hole with two\nhorizons, and no black hole for $a>a_{E}$. We find that the extremal value\n$a_E$ is also influenced by the parameter $g$ and so is the ergosphere. While\nthe value of $a_E$ remarkably decreases when compared with the Kerr black hole,\nthe ergosphere becomes more thick with increase in $g$. We also study collision\nof two equal mass particle near the horizon of this black hole, and explicitly\nbring out the effect of parameter $g$. The center-of-mass energy ($E_{CM}$) not\nonly depends on rotation parameter $a$, but also on parameter $g$. It is\ndemonstrated that the $E_{CM}$ could be arbitrary high in the extremal cases\nwhen one of the colliding particle has critical angular momentum, thereby\nsuggesting that the rotating Bardeen regular black hole can act as a particle\naccelerator.\n", "  We extend the recent gravitational decoherence analysis of Pikovski et al. to\nan individual mesoscopic system with internal state characterized by a coherent\nsuperposition of energy eigenstates. We express the Pikovski et al. effect\ndirectly in terms of the energy variance, and show that the interferometric\nvisibility is bounded from below. Hence unlike collisional decoherence, the\nvisibility does not approach zero at large times, although for a large system\nit can become very small.\n", "  In order to stabilize Majorana excitations within vortices of proximity\ninduced topological superconductors, it is mandatory that the Dirac point\nmatches the Fermi level rather exactly, such that the conventionally confined\nstates within the vortex are well separated from the Majorana-type excitation.\nHere, we show by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy that\n(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin films with $x=0.94$ prepared by\nmolecular beam epitaxy and transferred in ultrahigh vacuum from the molecular\nbeam epitaxy system to the photoemission setup matches this condition. The\nDirac point is within 10 meV around the Fermi level and we do not observe any\nbulk bands intersecting the Fermi level.\n", "  We present multi-epoch, time-resolved optical spectroscopic observations of\nthe dwarf nova HT Cas, obtained during 1986, 1992, 1995 and 2005 with the aim\nto study the properties of emission structures in the system. We determined\nthat the accretion disc radius, measured from the double-peaked emission line\nprofiles, is persistently large and lies within the range of 0.45-0.52a, where\na is the binary separation. This is close to the tidal truncation radius\nr_max=0.52a. This result contradicts with previous radius measurements. An\nextensive set of Doppler maps has revealed a very complex emission structure of\nthe accretion disc. Apart from a ring of disc emission, the tomograms display\nat least three areas of enhanced emission: the hot spot from the area of\ninteraction between the gas stream and the disc, which is superposed on the\nelongated spiral structure, and the extended bright region on the leading side\nof the disc, opposite to the location of the hot spot. The position of the hot\nspot in all the emission lines is consistent with the trajectory of the gas\nstream. However, the peaks of emission are located in the range of distances\n0.22-0.30a, which are much closer to the white dwarf than the disc edge. This\nsuggests that the outer disc regions have a very low density, allowing the gas\nstream to flow almost freely before it starts to be seen as an emission source.\nWe have found that the extended emission region in the leading side of the disc\nis always observed at the very edge of the large disc. Observations of other\ncataclysmic variables, which show a similar emission structure in their\ntomograms, confirm this conclusion. We propose that the leading side bright\nregion is caused by irradiation of tidally thickened sectors of the outer disc\nby the white dwarf and/or hot inner disc regions.\n", "  Oxide heterostructures are of great interest both for fundamental and\napplicative reasons. In particular the two-dimensional electron gas at the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ or LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces displays many different\nphysical properties and functionalities. However there are clear indications\nthat the interface electronic state is strongly inhomogeneous and therefore it\nis crucially relevant to investigate possible intrinsic electronic mechanisms\nunderlying this inhomogeneity. Here the electrostatic potential confining the\nelectron gas at the interface is calculated self-consistently, finding that the\nelectron confinement at the interface may induce phase separation, to avoid a\nthermodynamically unstable state with a negative compressibility. This provides\na generic robust and intrinsic mechanism for the experimentally observed\ninhomogeneous character of these interfaces.\n", "  Recent studies on the Lorentzian version of the type IIB matrix model show\nthat (3+1)D expanding universe emerges dynamically from (9+1)D space-time\npredicted by superstring theory. Here we study a bosonic matrix model obtained\nby omitting the fermionic matrices. With the adopted simplification and the\nusage of a large-scale parallel computer, we are able to perform Monte Carlo\ncalculations with matrix size up to $N=512$, which is twenty times larger than\nthat used previously for the studies of the original model. When the matrix\nsize is larger than some critical value $N_{\\rm c}\\simeq 110$, we find that\n(3+1)D expanding universe emerges dynamically with a clear large-$N$ scaling\nproperty. Furthermore, at sufficiently late times, we observe a power-law\nbehavior $t^{1/2}$ of the spatial extent with respect to time $t$, which is\nreminiscent of the expanding behavior of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse in the radiation dominated era. We discuss possible implications of\nthis result on the original model including fermionic matrices.\n", "  Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand characterization\nneeded in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered\nin the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the\nnumber of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and\ndestination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of\nthis law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another\npopular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which\nargues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only\nthe role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between\nthem. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two\napproaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them\nagainst empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different\ncountries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities\nlaws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the\nprobability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called\ntrip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the\ncommuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We\nshow that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities\nlaws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network\nand to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting\ncommuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different\napproaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since\ntheir only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.\n", "  In the dispersive regime of qubit-cavity coupling, classical cavity drive\npopulates the cavity, but leaves the qubit state unaffected. However, the\ndispersive Hamiltonian is derived after both a frame transformation and an\napproximation. Therefore, to connect to external experimental devices, the\ninverse frame transformation from the dispersive frame back to the lab frame is\nnecessary. In this work, we show that in the lab frame the system is best\ndescribed by an entangled state known as the dressed coherent state, and thus\neven in the dispersive regime, entanglement is generated between the qubit and\nthe cavity. Also, we show that further qubit evolution depends on both the\namplitude and phase of the dressed coherent state, and use the dressed coherent\nstate to calculate the measurement contrast of a recently developed dispersive\nreadout protocol.\n", "  Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill have formulated a way of encoding a qubit into\nan oscillator such that the qubit is protected against small shifts\n(translations) in phase space. The idea underlying this encoding is that error\nprocesses of low rate can be expanded into small shift errors. The qubit space\nis defined as an eigenspace of two mutually commuting displacement operators\n$S_p$ and $S_q$ which act as large shifts/translations in phase space. We\npropose and analyze the approximate creation of these qubit states by coupling\nthe oscillator to a sequence of ancilla qubits. This preparation of the states\nuses the idea of phase estimation where the phase of the displacement operator,\nsay $S_p$, is approximately determined. We consider several possible forms of\nphase estimation. We analyze the performance of repeated and adapative phase\nestimation as the simplest and experimentally most viable schemes given a\nrealistic upper-limit on the number of photons in the oscillator. We propose a\ndetailed physical implementation of this protocol using the dispersive coupling\nbetween a transmon ancilla qubit and a cavity mode in circuit-QED. We provide\nan estimate that in a current experimental set-up one can prepare a good code\nstate from a squeezed vacuum state using $8$ rounds of adapative phase\nestimation, lasting in total about $4 \\mu$ sec., with $94\\%$ (heralded) chance\nof success.\n", "  We investigate the eigenvalue density in ensembles of large sparse Bernoulli\nrandom matrices. We demonstrate that the fraction of linear subgraphs just\nbelow the percolation threshold is about 95\\% of all finite subgraphs, and the\ndistribution of linear chains is purely exponential. We analyze in detail the\nspectral density of ensembles of linear subgraphs, discuss its ultrametric\nnature and show that near the spectrum boundary, the tail of the spectral\ndensity exhibits a Lifshitz singularity typical for Anderson localization. We\nalso discuss an intriguing connection of the spectral density to the Dedekind\n$\\eta$-function. We conjecture that ultrametricity is inherit to complex\nsystems with extremal sparse statistics and argue that a number-theoretic\nultrametricity emerges in any rare-event statistics.\n", "  We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the protocol dependence of\nthe jamming transition for frictionless spherical particles that interact via\npurely repulsive contact forces. We study isostatic jammed disk packings\nobtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show\nthat for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either\nprotocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing\ndepends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain\nrequired to induce jamming in initially unjammed packings from the measured\nprobability to jam at packing fraction $\\phi$ from isotropic compression. We\ncompare our predictions to results from numerical simulations of jamming and\nfind quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over\nwhich strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit\nfor frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.\n", "  Radiative two-photon cascades from biexcitons in semiconductor quantum dots\nunder resonant two-photon excitation are promising candidates for the\ngeneration of photon pairs. In this work, we propose a scheme to obtain\ntwo-photon emission that allows to operate under very intense driving fields.\nThis approach relies on the Purcell enhancement of two-photon virtual\ntransitions between states of the biexciton dressed by the laser. The richness\nprovided by the biexcitonic level structure allows to reach a variety of\nregimes, from antibunched and bunched photon pairs with polarization orthogonal\nto the driving field, to polarization entangled two-photon emission. This\nevidences that the general paradigm of two-photon emission from a ladder of\ndressed states can find interesting, particular implementations in a variety of\nsystems.\n", "  Focusing light inside scattering media in a freely addressable fashion is\nchallenging, as the wavefront of the scattered light is highly disordered.\nRecently developed ultrasound-guided wavefront shaping methods are addressing\nthis challenge, albeit with relatively low modulation efficiency and resolution\nlimitations. In this paper, we present a new technique, time-reversed\nultrasound microbubble encoded (TRUME) optical focusing, which is able to focus\nlight with improved efficiency and sub-ultrasound wavelength resolution. This\nmethod ultrasonically destructs microbubbles, and measures the wavefront change\nto compute and render a suitable time-reversed wavefront solution for focusing.\nWe demonstrate that the TRUME technique can create an optical focus at the site\nof bubble destruction with a size of ~2 microns. Due to the nonlinear\npressure-to-destruction response, the TRUME technique can break the addressable\nfocus resolution barrier imposed by the ultrasound focus. We experimentally\ndemonstrate a 2-fold addressable focus resolution improvement in a microbubble\naggregate target.\n", "  We propose a relativistic Jeff=3/2 semimetal with 4d1 or 5d1 electrons on a\ncubic lattice when the strong spin-orbital coupling takes over the Hunds'\ncoupling. A relativistic spinor with spin 3/2 is historically called\nRarita-Schwinger spinor. In the massless case, the right- and left-handed\nchiral degrees of freedom of the Rarita-Schwinger spinors are independent. In\nthe lattice model that we propose, the right- and left- handed gapless points\nin Brillouin zone are separated. We call this linearly dispersed semimetal\nRarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal, similar to Weyl semimetal for spin 1/2\nsystems. There is a network of gapless Fermi arcs in the surface Brillouin zone\nif n1+n2+n3 is even for the normal vector (n1,n2,n3) of the surface while the\nsurface is insulator if n1+n2+n3 is odd.\n", "  In the paper the spectral temporal evolution of a steeply rising\nsubmillimeter (THz) burst occurred on 2003 November 2 was investigated in\ndetail for the first time. Observations show that the flux density of the THz\nspectrum increased steeply with frequency above 200 GHz. Their average rising\nrates reached a value of 235 sfu/GHz (corresponding spectral index $\\alpha$ of\n4.8) during the burst. The flux densities reached about 4,000 and 70,000 sfu at\n212 and 405 GHz at maximum phase, respectively. The emissions at 405 GHz\nmaintained continuous high level that they exceed largely the peak values of\nthe microwave (MW) spectra during the main phase. Our studies suggest that only\nenergetic electrons with a low-energy cutoff of $\\sim$1 MeV and number density\nof $\\sim$$10^{6}$--$10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ can produce such strong and steeply\nrising THz component via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on numerical\nsimulations of burst spectra in the nonuniform magnetic field case. The\nelectron number density $N$, derived from our numerical fits to the THz\ntemporal evolution spectra, increased substantially from $8\\times10^{6}$ to\n$4\\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e., $N$ value increased 50 times during the rise\nphase. During the decay phase it decreased to $7\\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e.,\ndecreased about five times from the maximum phase. The total electron number\ndecreased an order of magnitude from the maximum phase to the decay phase.\nNevertheless the variation amplitude of $N$ is only about one time in the MW\nemission source during this burst, and the total electron number did not\ndecrease but increased by about 20$\\%$ during the decay phase. Interestingly,\nwe find that the THz source radius decreased by about 24$\\%$ while the MW\nsource one, on the contrary, increased by 28$\\%$ during the decay phase.\n", "  In the study of networked systems such as biological, technological, and\nsocial networks the available data are often uncertain. Rather than knowing the\nstructure of a network exactly, we know the connections between nodes only with\na certain probability. In this paper we develop methods for the analysis of\nsuch uncertain data, focusing particularly on the problem of community\ndetection. We give a principled maximum-likelihood method for inferring\ncommunity structure and demonstrate how the results can be used to make\nimproved estimates of the true structure of the network. Using\ncomputer-generated benchmark networks we demonstrate that our methods are able\nto reconstruct known communities more accurately than previous approaches based\non data thresholding. We also give an example application to the detection of\ncommunities in a protein-protein interaction network.\n", "  We discovered uniaxial oriented centers in silicon carbide having unusual\nperformance. Here we demonstrate that the family of silicon-vacancy related\ncenters with $S= 3/2$ in rhombic 15R-SiC crystalline matrix possess unique\ncharacteristics such as ODMR contrast and optical spin alignment existing at\ntemperatures up to 250$^\\circ$C. Thus the concept of optically addressable\nsilicon vacancy related centers with half integer ground spin state is extended\nto the wide class of SiC rhombic polytypes. The structure of these centers,\nwhich is a fundamental problem for quantum applications, has been established\nusing high frequency ENDOR. It has been shown that a family of siliconvacancy\nrelated centers is a negatively charged silicon vacancy in the paramagnetic\nstate with the spin $S= 3/2$, V$_\\textrm{Si}^-$, perturbed by neutral carbon\nvacancy in non-paramagnetic state, V$_\\textrm{C}^0$, having no covalent bond\nwith the silicon vacancy and located adjacently to the silicon vacancy on the c\ncrystal axis.\n", "  We propose a simple conjecture for the functional form of the asymptotic\nbehavior of work distributions for driven overdamped Brownian motion of a\nparticle in confining potentials. This conjecture is motivated by the fact that\nthese functional forms are independent of the velocity of the driving for all\npotentials and protocols, where explicit analytical solutions for the work\ndistributions have been derived in the literature. To test the conjecture, we\nuse Brownian dynamics simulations and a recent theory developed by Engel and\nNickelsen (EN theory), which is based on the contraction principle of large\ndeviation theory. Our tests suggest that the conjecture is valid for potentials\nwith a confinement equal to or weaker than the parabolic one, both for\nequilibrium and for nonequilibrium distributions of the initial particle\nposition. In addition we obtain a new analytical solution for the asymptotic\nbehavior of the work distribution for the V-potential by application of the EN\ntheory, and we extend this theory to nonequilibrated initial particle\npositions.\n", "  We study the entropy production in a macroscopic nonequilibrium system that\nundergoes an order-disorder phase transition. Entropy production is a\ncharacteristic feature of nonequilibrium dynamics with broken detailed balance.\nIt is found that the entropy production rate per particle vanishes in the\ndisordered phase and becomes positive in the ordered phase following critical\nscaling laws. We derive the scaling relations for associated critical\nexponents. Our study reveals that a nonequilibrium ordered state is sustained\nat the expense of macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking with an extensive\nentropy production while a disordered state costs only a subextensive entropy\nproduction.\n", "  We derive a set of equations expressing the parameters of the magnetic\ninteractions characterizing a strongly correlated electronic system in terms of\nsingle-electron Green's functions and self-energies. This allows to establish a\nmapping between the initial electronic system and a spin model including up to\nquadratic interactions between the effective spins, with a general interaction\n(exchange) tensor that accounts for anisotropic exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction and other symmetric terms such as dipole-dipole interaction. We\npresent the formulas in a format that can be used for computations via\nDynamical Mean Field Theory algorithms.\n", "  We present a study of patterns, formed in drying drops of aqueous gelatin\nsolution containing sodium sulphate. The patterns are highly complex,\nconsisting of a hierarchical sequence of rings which form concentric bands as\nwell as dendritic crystalline aggregates. When the preparation of the complex\nfluid is done by mixing an aqueous solution of the salt with an aqueous\nsolution of gelatin prepared separately, another feature is observed in the\npattern on the dried out drop. This is a viscous fingering pattern, superposed\non the series of rings. We try to explain the origin of these two features from\na simple physical approach.\n", "  Graphene has attracted increasing interests due to its remarkable properties,\nhowever, the zero band gap of monolayer graphene might limit its further\nelectronic and optoelectronic applications. Herein, we have successfully\nsynthesized monolayer silicon-doped graphene (SiG) in large area by chemical\nvapor deposition method. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurements evidence silicon atoms are doped into graphene\nlattice with the doping level of 3.4 at%. The electrical measurement based on\nfield effect transistor indicates that the band gap of graphene has been opened\nby silicon doping, which is around 0. 28 eV supported by the first-principle\ncalculations, and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the\nwork function of SiG is 0.13 eV larger than that of graphene. Moreover, the\nSiG/GaAs heterostructure solar cells show an improved power conversion\nefficiency of 33.7% in average than that of graphene/GaAs solar cells, which\nare attributed to the increased barrier height and improved interface quality.\nOur results suggest silicon doping can effectively engineer the band gap of\nmonolayer graphene and SiG has great potential in optoelectronic device\napplications.\n", "  We show that accounting for internal character among interacting,\nheterogeneous entities generates rich phase transition behavior between\nisolation and cohesive dynamical grouping. Our analytical and numerical\ncalculations reveal different critical points arising for different\ncharacter-dependent grouping mechanisms. These critical points move in opposite\ndirections as the population's diversity decreases. Our analytical theory helps\nexplain why a particular class of universality is so common in the real world,\ndespite fundamental differences in the underlying entities. Furthermore, it\ncorrectly predicts the non-monotonic temporal variation in connectivity\nobserved recently in one such system.\n", "  Dependence of the energy of ions accelerated during interaction of the laser\npulse obliquelly incident on the thin foil target on the laser polarization is\nstudied experimentally and theoretically. We found that the ion energy being\nmaximal for the p-polarization gradually decreases when the pulse becomes\ns-polarized. The experimentally found dependences of the ion energy are\nexplained by invoking the anomalous electron heating which results in high\nelectrostatic potential formation at the target surface. Anomalous heating of\nelectrons beyond the energy of quiver motion in the laser field is described\nwithin the framework of theoretical model of driven oscillator with a step-like\nnonlinearity. We have demonstrated that the electron anomalous heating can be\nrealized in two regimes: nonlinear resonance and stochastic heating, depending\non the extent of stochasticity. We have found the accelerated ion energy\nscaling determined by the laser intensity, pulse duration, polarization angle\nand incident angle.\n", "  We consider hydrodynamic limits of interacting particles systems with open\nboundaries, where the exterior parameters change in a time scale slower than\nthe typical relaxation time scale. The limit deterministic profiles evolve\nquasi-statically. These limits define rigorously the thermodynamic quasi static\ntransformations also for transition between non-equilibrium stationary states.\nWe study first the case of the symmetric simple exclusion, where duality can be\nused, and then we use relative entropy methods to extend to other models like\nzero range systems. Finally we consider a chain of anharmonic oscillators in\ncontact with a thermal Langevin bath with a temperature gradient and a slowly\nvarying tension applied to one end.\n", "  Within the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), we discuss the\nequation of state (EOS) and quark number densities of 2+1 flavors, that is to\nsay, $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. The chemical equilibrium and electric charge\nneutrality conditions are used to constrain the chemical potential of different\nquarks. The EOS in the cases of 2 flavors and 2+1 flavors are discussed, and\nthe quark number densities, the pressure, and energy density per baryon are\nalso studied. The results show that there is a critical chemical potential for\neach flavor of quark, at which the quark number density turns to nonzero from\n0; and furthermore, the system with 2+1 flavors of quarks is more stable than\nthat with 2 flavors in the system. These discussion may provide some useful\ninformation to some research fields, such as the studies related to the QCD\nphase transitions or compact stars.\n", "  We investigate multi-wave mixing associated with the strongly pump depleted\nregime of induced modulation instability (MI) in optical fibers. For a complete\ntransfer of pump power into the sideband modes, we theoretically and\nexperimentally demonstrate that it is necessary to use a much lower seeding\nmodulation frequency than the peak MI gain value. Our analysis shows that a\nrecord 95 % of the input pump power is frequency converted into the comb of\nsidebands, in good quantitative agreement with analytical predictions based on\nthe simplest exact breather solution of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We generalize the Persson contact mechanics and rubber friction theory to the\ncase where both surfaces have surface roughness. The solids can be rigid,\nelastic or viscoelastic, and can be homogeneous or layered. We calculate the\ncontact area, the viscoelastic contribution to the friction force, and the\naverage interfacial separation as a function of the sliding speed and the\nnominal contact pressure. We illustrate the theory with numerical results for a\nrubber block sliding on a road surface. We find that with increasing sliding\nspeed, the influence of the roughness on the rubber block decreases, and for\ntypical sliding speeds involved in tire dynamics it can be neglected.\n", "  We study the effects of stochastic thermal fluctuations on the instability of\nthe free surface of a flat liquid film upon a solid substrate. These\nfluctuations are represented as a standard Brownian motion that can be added to\nthe deterministic equation for the film thickness within the lubrication\napproximation. Here, we consider that while the noise term is white in time, it\nis coloured in space. This allows for the introduction of a finite correlation\nlength in the description of the randomized intermolecular interaction.\nTogether with the expected spatial periodicity of the flow, we find a\ndimensionless parameter, $\\beta$, that accounts for the relative importance of\nthe spatial correlation. We perform here the linear stability analysis (LSA) of\nthe film under the influence of both terms, and find the corresponding power\nspectra for the amplitudes of the normal modes of the instability. We compare\nthis theoretical result with the numerical simulations of the complete\nnon-linear problem, and find a good agreement for early times. For late times,\nwe find that the stochastic LSA predictions on the dominant wavelength remains\nbasically valid. We also use the theoretical spectra to fit experimental data\nfrom a nanometric melted copper film, and find the corresponding times of the\nevolution as well as the values of the parameter, $\\beta$.\n", "  The electroweak sector may play a crucial role in discovering supersymmetry.\nWe systematically investigate the patterns of the MSSM-like electroweakinos,\nwhen the neutralino relic abundance $\\Omega_\\chi h^2\\leq 0.12$, that is, also\nadmitting for multi-component Dark Matter, in a broad range of the parameter\nspace. We find that for a very large range of parameters the Direct Detection\nexperiments are/will be sensitive to underabundant neutralinos, in spite of the\nstrong rescaling of the flux factor. The second general conclusion is that the\nbound $\\Omega_\\chi h^2\\leq 0.12$ together with the LUX (XENON1T) limits for the\nneutralino spin independent scattering cross sections constrain the\nelectroweakino spectrum so that the mass differences between the NLSP and the\nLSP are smaller than 40 (10) GeV, respectively, with important implications for\nthe collider searches. The future Direct Detection experiments and the high\nluminosity LHC run will probe almost the entire range of the LSP and NLSP mass\nspectrum that is consistent with the bound $\\Omega_\\chi h^2\\leq 0.12$.\n", "  We conjecture an embedding operator which assigns, to any 2n+1 hermitian\nmatrices, a 2n-dimensional hypersurface in flat (2n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean\nspace. This corresponds to precisely defining a fuzzy D(2n)-brane corresponding\nto N D0-branes. Points on the emergent hypersurface correspond to zero\neigenstates of the embedding operator, which have an interpretation as coherent\nstates underlying the emergent noncommutative geometry. Using this\ncorrespondence, all physical properties of the emergent D(2n)-brane can be\ncomputed. We apply our conjecture to noncommutative flat and spherical spaces.\nAs a by-product, we obtain a construction of a rotationally symmetric flat\nnoncommutative space in 4 dimensions.\n", "  We present two complementary models to study stationary nonlinear solutions\nin one-dimensional plasmonic slot waveguides made of a finite-thickness\nnonlinear dielectric core surrounded by metal regions. The considered\nnonlinearity is of focusing Kerr type. In the first model, it is assumed that\nthe nonlinear term depends only on the transverse component of the electric\nfield and that the nonlinear refractive index change is small compared to the\nlinear part of the refractive index. This first model allows us to describe\nanalytically the field profiles in the whole waveguide using Jacobi elliptic\nspecial functions. It also provides a closed analytical formula for the\nnonlinear dispersion relation. In the second model, the full dependency of the\nKerr nonlinearity on the electric field components is taken into account and no\nassumption is required on the amplitude of the nonlinear term. The disadvantage\nof this approach is that the field profiles must be computed numerically.\nNevertheless analytical constraints are obtained to reduce the parameter space\nwhere the solutions of the nonlinear dispersion relations are sought.\n", "  The characteristic identity formalism discussed in our recent articles is\nfurther utilized to derive matrix elements of type 2 unitary irreducible\n$gl(m|n)$ modules. In particular, we give matrix element formulae for all\ngl(m|n) generators, including the non-elementary generators, together with\ntheir phases on finite dimensional type 2 unitary irreducible representations.\nRemarkably, we find that the type 2 unitary matrix element equations coincide\nwith the type 1 unitary matrix element equations for non-vanishing matrix\nelements up to a phase.\n", "  We present an update of the CLUMPY code for the calculation of the\nastrophysical J-factors (from dark matter annihilation/decay) for any Galactic\nor extragalactic dark matter halo including substructures: halo-to-halo\nconcentration scatter may now be enabled, boost factors can include several\nlevels of substructures, and triaxiality is a new option for dark matter\nhaloes. This new version takes advantage of the CFITSIO and HEALPix libraries\nto propose FITS output maps using the HEALPix pixelisation scheme. Skymaps for\n$\\gamma$-ray and $\\nu$ signals from generic annihilation/decay spectra are now\ndirect outputs of CLUMPY. Making use of HEALPix routines, smoothing by a\nuser-defined instrumental Gaussian beam and computing the angular power\nspectrum of the maps is now possible. In addition to these improvements, the\nmain novelty is the implementation of a Jeans analysis module, to obtain dark\nmatter density profiles from kinematic data in relaxed spherical systems (e.g.,\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies). The code is also interfaced with the GreAT toolkit\ndesigned for Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, from which probability density\nfunctions and credible intervals can be obtained for velocity dispersions, dark\nmatter profiles, and J-factors.\n", "  Topological superconductors possess a nodeless superconducting gap in the\nbulk and gapless zero energy modes, known as \"Majorana zero modes\", at the\nboundary of a finite system. In this work, we introduce a new class of\ntopological superconductors, which are protected by nonsymmorphic crystalline\nsymmetry and thus dubbed \"topological nonsymmorphic crystalline\nsuperconductors\". We construct an explicit Bogoliubov-de Gennes type of model\nfor this superconducting phase in the D class and show how Majorana zero modes\nin this model are protected by glide symmetry. Furthermore, we generalize the\nclassification of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline superconductors to the\nclasses with time reversal symmetry, including the DIII and BDI classes, in two\ndimensions. Our theory provides a guidance to search for new topological\nsuperconducting materials with nonsymmorphic crystal structures.\n", "  Contrary to a wide-spread commonplace, an exact, ray-based treatment holding\nfor any kind of monochromatic wave-like features (such as diffraction and\ninterference) is provided by the structure itself of the Helmholtz equation.\nThis observation allows to dispel - in apparent violation of the Uncertainty\nPrinciple - another commonplace, forbidding an exact, trajectory-based approach\nto Wave Mechanics.\n", "  We study a sigma-model with target space the flag manifold U(3)/U(1)^3. A\npeculiarity of the model is that the complex structure on the target space\nenters explicitly in the action. We describe the classical solutions of the\nmodel for the case when the worldsheet is a sphere CP^1.\n", "  We describe the results of the two methods we developed to calculate the\nstationary nonlinear solutions in one-dimensional plasmonic slot waveguides\nmade of a finite-thickness nonlinear dielectric core surrounded by metal\nregions. These two methods are described in detail in the preceding article\n[Walasik et al., submitted]. For symmetric waveguides, we provide the nonlinear\ndispersion curves obtained using the two methods and compare them. We describe\nthe well known low-order modes and the higher-modes that were not described\nbefore. All the modes are classified into two families: modes with and without\nnodes. We also compare nonlinear modes with nodes with the linear modes in\nsimilar linear slot waveguides with a homogeneous core. We recover the symmetry\nbreaking Hopf bifurcation of the first symmetric nonlinear mode toward an\nasymmetric mode and we show that one of the higher modes also exhibits a\nbifurcation. We study the behavior of the bifurcation of the fundamental mode\nas a function of the permittivities of a metal and a nonlinear core. We\ndemonstrate that the bifurcation can be obtained at low power levels in\nstructures with optimized parameters. Moreover, we provide the dispersion\ncurves for asymmetric nonlinear slot waveguides. Finally, we give results\nconcerning the stability of the fundamental symmetric mode and the asymmetric\nmode that bifurcates from it using both theoretical argument and numerical\npropagation simulations from two different full-vector methods. We investigate\nalso the stability properties of the first antisymmetric mode using our two\nnumerical propagation methods.\n", "  Probabilistic quantum state transformations can be characterized by the\ndegree of state separation they provide. This, in turn, sets limits on the\nsuccess rate of these transformations. We consider optimum state separation of\ntwo known pure states in the general case where the known states have arbitrary\na priori probabilities. The problem is formulated from a geometric perspective\nand shown to be equivalent to the problem of finding tangent curves within two\nfamilies of conics that represent the unitarity constraints and the objective\nfunctions to be optimized, respectively. We present the corresponding\nanalytical solutions in various forms. In the limit of perfect state\nseparation, which is equivalent to unambiguous state discrimination, the\nsolution exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking\nphase transition. We also propose a linear optics implementation of separation\nwhich is based on the dual rail representation of qubits and single-photon\nmultiport interferometry.\n", "  It is well-known that there is a geometric correspondence between\nhigh-frequency quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and null geodesics (spherical photon\norbits). In this paper, we generalize such correspondence to charged scalar\nfield in Kerr-Newman space-time. In our case, the particle and black hole are\nall charged, so one should consider non-geodesic orbits. Using the WKB\napproximation, we find that the real part of quasi-normal frequency corresponds\nto the orbits frequency, the imaginary part of the frequency corresponds to the\nLyapunov exponent of these orbits and the eigenvalue of angular equation\ncorresponds to carter constant. From the properties of the imaginary part of\nquasi-normal frequency of charged massless scalar field, we can still find that\nthe QNMs of charged massless scalar field possess the zero damping modes in\nextreme Kerr-Newman spacetime under certain condition which has been fixed in\nthis paper.\n", "  We present a systematic method to introduce free parameters in sets of\nmutually unbiased bases. In particular, we demonstrate that any set of m real\nmutually unbiased bases in dimension N>2 admits the introduction of (m-1)N/2\nfree parameters which cannot be absorbed by a global unitary operation. As\nconsequence, there are m=k+1 mutually unbiased bases in every dimension N=k^2\nwith k^3/2 free parameters, where k is even. We construct the maximal set of\ntriplets of mutually unbiased bases for two-qubits systems and triplets,\nquadruplets and quintuplets of mutually unbiased bases with free parameters for\nthree-qubits systems. Furthermore, we study the richness of the entanglement\nstructure of such bases and we provide the quantum circuits required to\nimplement all these bases with free parameters in the laboratory. Finally, we\nfind the upper bound for the maximal number of real and complex mutually\nunbiased bases existing in every dimension. This proof is simple, short and it\nconsiders basic matrix algebra.\n", "  In this work, we address the recent experiment [S. Tewari et al.,\narXiv:1503.05057v1], where the suppression of phase coherence of a\nsingle-electron wave packet created at the edge of a quantum Hall (QH) system\nat filling factor 2 has been investigated with the help of an electronic\nMach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer. The authors of the experiment have observed\nan unexpected behavior of phase coherence, that saturates at high energies\ninstead of vanishing, presumably suggesting the relaxation of a wave packet to\nthe ground state before it arrives to the MZ interferometer. Here, we\ntheoretically investigate this situation using the model of edge states [I. P.\nLevkivskyi, E. V. Sukhorukov, Phys. Rev. B 78, 045322 (2008)], which accounts\nfor the strong Coulomb interaction between the two electron channels at the\nedge of a QH system. We conclude that the observed phenomenon cannot be\nexplained within this model for the reason that under an assumption of\nlinearity of the electron spectrum at low energies the system remains\nintegrable in terms of the collective charge excitations, and therefore full\nrelaxation to the ground state is not possible, despite strong interactions. As\na result, the degree of the phase coherence decreases with energy of the\ninitial state in a power-law manner. Since this does not happen in the\nexperiment, a new physical phenomenon may take place at the edge of a QH state,\nwhich deserves further investigations. We support our findings by calculating\nthe energy distribution and the Wigner function of the outgoing non-equilibrium\nstate of the single-electron wave packet.\n", "  TAUOLA is a Monte Carlo generator dedicated to generating tau-lepton decays\nand it is used in the analysis of experimental data both at B-factories and\nLHC. TAUOLA is a long-term project that started in the 90's and has been under\ndevelopment up to now. In this note we discuss the status of the predominant\nhadronic tau-lepton decays into two ($Br \\simeq 25.52\\%$) and three pions ($Br\n\\simeq 18.67\\%$).\n", "  Supersymmetric flux compactification of F-theory in the geometric phase\nyields numerous vacua, and provides an ensemble of low-energy effective\ntheories with different symmetry, matter multiplicity and Lagrangian\nparameters. Theoretical tools have already been developed so that we can study\nhow the statistics of flux vacua depend on the choice of symmetry and some of\nLagrangian parameters. In this article, we estimate the fraction of i) vacua\nthat have a U(1) symmetry for spontaneous R-parity violation, and ii) those\nthat realise ideas which achieve hierarchical eigenvalues of the Yukawa\nmatrices. We also learn a lesson that the number of flux vacua is reduced very\nmuch when the unbroken $U(1)_Y$ symmetry is obtained from a non-trivial\nMordell--Weil group, while it is not when $U(1)_Y$ is in SU(5) unification. It\nalso turns out that vacua with an approximate U(1) symmetry forms a locus of\naccumulation points of the flux vacua distribution.\n", "  The quark production in classical color fields is investigated with a focus\non the induction of an electromagnetic current by produced quarks. We show that\nthe color SU(2) and the SU(3) theories lead significantly different results for\nthe electromagnetic current. In uniform SU(2) color fields, the net\nelectromagnetic current is not generated, while in SU(3) color fields the net\ncurrent is induced depending on the color direction of background fields. Also\nthe numerical study of the quark production in inhomogeneous color fields is\ndone. Motivated by gauge field configurations provided by the color glass\ncondensate framework, we introduce an ensemble of randomly distributed color\nelectric fluxtubes. The spectrum of photons emitted from the quarks by a\nclassical process is shown.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the dodecahedron possesses a number\nof ground state magnetization discontinuities in a field at the classical and\nquantum level, even though it lacks magnetic anisotropy. Here the model is\nconsidered for two dodecahedra coupled antiferromagnetically along one of their\nfaces, as a first step to determine the magnetic response of collections of\nfullerene molecules. The magnetic response is determined from the competition\namong the intra-, interdodecahedra exchange and magnetic field energies. At the\nclassical level the discontinuities of the isolated dodecahedron are\nrenormalized by the interdodecahedral coupling, while new ones show up, with\nthe maximum number of ground state discontinuities being six for a specific\nrange of the coupling. In the full quantum limit where the individual spin\nmagnitude s=1/2, there are two ground state discontinuities originating in the\nsingle discontinuity of the isolated dodecahedron, and another one due to the\nintermolecular coupling, generating a total of three discontinuities which come\none right after the other. These results show that the magnetic response of\nmore than one dodecahedra interacting together is quite richer than the one of\na single dodecahedron.\n", "  In this work we develop the Spectral Ewald Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics\n(SEASD), a novel computational method for dynamic simulations of polydisperse\ncolloidal suspensions with full hydrodynamic interactions. SEASD is based on\nthe framework of Stokesian Dynamics (SD) with extension to compressible\nsolvents, and uses the Spectral Ewald (SE) method [Lindbo & Tornberg, J.\nComput. Phys. 229 (2010) 8994] for the wave-space mobility computation. To meet\nthe performance requirement of dynamic simulations, we use Graphic Processing\nUnits (GPU) to evaluate the suspension mobility, and achieve an order of\nmagnitude speedup compared to a CPU implementation. For further speedup, we\ndevelop a novel far-field block-diagonal preconditioner to reduce the far-field\nevaluations in the iterative solver, and SEASD-nf, a polydisperse extension of\nthe mean-field Brownian approximation of Banchio & Brady [J. Chem. Phys. 118\n(2003) 10323]. We extensively discuss implementation and parameter selection\nstrategies in SEASD, and demonstrate the spectral accuracy in the mobility\nevaluation and the overall $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ computation scaling. We\npresent three computational examples to further validate SEASD and SEASD-nf in\nmonodisperse and bidisperse suspensions: the short-time transport properties,\nthe equilibrium osmotic pressure and viscoelastic moduli, and the steady shear\nBrownian rheology. Our validation results show that the agreement between SEASD\nand SEASD-nf is satisfactory over a wide range of parameters, and also provide\nsignificant insight into the dynamics of polydisperse colloidal suspensions.\n", "  We attempt to propose a method for automatically detecting the solar filament\nchirality and barb bearing. We first introduce the unweighted undirected graph\nconcept and adopt the Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm to recognize the\nfilament spine. Then, we use the polarity inversion line (PIL) shift method for\nmeasuring the polarities on both sides of the filament, and employ the\nconnected components labeling method to identify the barbs and calculate the\nangle between each barb and the spine to determine the bearing of the barbs,\ni.e., left or right. We test the automatic detection method with H-alpha\nfiltergrams from the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) H-alpha archive and\nmagnetograms observed with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Four filaments are automatically detected\nand illustrated to show the results. The barbs in different parts of a filament\nmay have opposite bearings. The filaments in the southern hemisphere (northern\nhemisphere) mainly have left-bearing (right-bearing) barbs and positive\n(negative) magnetic helicity, respectively. The tested results demonstrate that\nour method is efficient and effective in detecting the bearing of filament\nbarbs. It is demonstrated that the conventionally believed one-to-one\ncorrespondence between filament chirality and barb bearing is not valid. The\ncorrect detection of the filament axis chirality should be done by combining\nboth imaging morphology and magnetic field observations.\n", "  Metallic thin-walled round tubes are widely used as energy absorption\nelements. However, lateral splash of the round tubes under impact loadings\nreduces the energy absorption efficiency and may cause secondary damages.\nTherefore, it is necessary to assemble and fasten round tubes together by\nboundary constraints and/or fasteners between tubes, which increases the time\nand labor cost and affects the mechanical performance of round tubes. In an\neffort to break through this limitation, a novel self-locked energy-absorbing\nsystem has been proposed in this paper. The proposed system is made up of\nthin-walled tubes with dumbbell-shaped cross section, which are specially\ndesigned to interlock with each other and thus provide lateral constraint under\nimpact loadings. Both finite element simulations and impact experiment\ndemonstrated that without boundary constraints or fasteners between tubes, the\nproposed self-locked energy-absorbing system can still effectively attenuate\nimpact loads while the round tube systems fail to carry load due to the lateral\nsplashing of tubes. Furthermore, the optimal geometric design for a single\ndumbbell-shaped tube and the optimal stacking arrangement for the system are\ndiscussed, and a general guideline on the structural design of the proposed\nself-locked energy absorbing system is provided.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the impact of the defect-limited carrier\nlifetime on the performance of germanium (Ge) light sources, specifically LEDs\nand lasers. For Ge LEDs, we show that improving the material quality can offer\neven greater enhancements than techniques such as tensile strain, the leading\napproach for enhancing Ge light emission. Even for Ge that is so heavily\nstrained that it becomes a direct bandgap semiconductor, the ~1 ns\ndefect-limited carrier lifetime of typical epitaxial Ge limits the LED internal\nquantum efficiency to less than 10%. In contrast, if the epitaxial Ge carrier\nlifetime can be increased to its bulk value, internal quantum efficiencies\nexceeding 90% become possible. For Ge lasers, we show that the defect-limited\nlifetime becomes increasing important as tensile strain is introduced, and that\nthis defect-limited lifetime must be improved if the full benefits of strain\nare to be realized. We conversely show that improving the material quality\nsupersedes much of the utility of n-type doping for Ge lasers.\n", "  A very general cosmological consideration suggests that, along with galactic\ndark matter halos, much smaller dark matter structures may exist. These\nstructures are usually called 'clumps', and their mass extends to $10^{-6}\nM_\\odot$ or even lower. The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time. Recent observations favor a cored profile for low-mass\nastrophysical halos. We consider cored clumps and show that they are\nsignificantly less firm than the standard NFW ones. In contrast to the standard\nscenario, the cored clumps should have been completely destroyed inside $\\sim\n20$~{kpc} from the Milky Way center. The dwarf spheroidals should not contain\nany dark matter clumps. On the other hand, even under the most pessimistic\nassumption about the clump structure, the clumps should have survived in the\nMilky Way at a distance exceeding $50$~{kpc} from the center, as well as in\nlow-density cosmic structures. There they significantly boost the dark matter\nannihilation. We show that at least $~70\\%$ of the clumps endured the\nprimordial structure formation should still exist untouched in the present-day\nUniverse.\n", "  Milz and Strunz recently reported substantial evidence to further support the\npreviously conjectured separability probability of $\\frac{8}{33}$ for two-qubit\nsystems ($\\rho$) endowed with Hilbert-Schmidt measure. Additionally, they found\nthat along the radius ($r$) of the Bloch ball representing either of the two\nsingle-qubit subsystems, this value appeared constant (but jumping to unity at\nthe locus of the pure states, $r=1$). Further, they also observed (personal\ncommunication) such separability probability $r$-invariance, when using, more\nbroadly, random induced measure ($K=3,4,5,\\ldots$), with $K=4$ corresponding to\nthe (symmetric) Hilbert-Schmidt case. Among the findings here is that this\ninvariance is maintained even after splitting the separability probabilities\ninto those parts arising from the determinantal inequality $|\\rho^{PT}|\n>|\\rho|$ and those from $|\\rho| > |\\rho^{PT}| >0$, where the partial transpose\nis indicated. The nine-dimensional set of generic two-re[al]bit states endowed\nwith Hilbert-Schmidt measure is also examined, with similar $r$-invariance\nconclusions. Contrastingly, two-qubit separability probabilities based on the\nBures (minimal monotone) measure {\\it diminish} with $r$. Moreover, we study\nthe forms that the separability probabilities take as joint (bivariate)\nfunctions of the radii ($r_A, r_B$) of the Bloch balls of {\\it both}\nsingle-qubit subsystems. Here, a form of Bloch radii {\\it repulsion} for\nseparable two-qubit systems emerges in {\\it all} our several analyses.\nSeparability probabilities tend to be smaller when the lengths of the two radii\nare closer. In Appendix A, we report certain companion analytic results for the\nmuch-investigated, more amenable (7-dimensional) $X$-states model.\n", "  We discuss reductions of general N=1 four dimensional gauge theories on S^2.\nThe effective two dimensional theory one obtains depends on the details of the\ncoupling of the theory to background fields, which can be translated to a\nchoice of R-symmetry. We argue that, for special choices of R-symmetry, the\nresulting two dimensional theory has a natural interpretation as an N=(0,2)\ngauge theory. As an application of our general observations, we discuss\nreductions of N=1 and N=2 dualities and argue that they imply certain two\ndimensional dualities.\n", "  We point out that there is a parameter region in supersymmetry with heavy\nscalars and higgsinos, in which the heavier of bino and wino becomes long-lived\nas a consequence of the heavy higgsinos. In this region these electroweak\ngaugino sectors are secluded from each other with very small mixings that are\ninversely proportional to the higgsino mass. We revisit the bino and bino\ndecays and provide simple formulae for the partial decay rates and the\nlifetimes in the limit of heavy higgsinos. We discuss the collider signatures\nof the long-lived binos and winos in this scenario.\n", "  Pressure Wave Systems GmbH has developed a dry compressor for GM and pulse\ntube cryocoolers. The concept is based on hydraulically driven metal bellows in\nwhich the Helium working gas is compressed. The system is operated in the\nregion of 1 kW of electrical input power and has been successfully tested with\na SHI RDK-101D GM cryocooler cold head. Set-up, performance and reliability of\nthe compressor system will be discussed.\n", "  While the 12C(a,g)16O reaction plays a central role in nuclear astrophysics,\nthe cross section at energies relevant to hydrostatic helium burning is too\nsmall to be directly measured in the laboratory. The beta-delayed alpha\nspectrum of 16N can be used to constrain the extrapolation of the E1 component\nof the S-factor; however, with this approach the resulting S-factor becomes\nstrongly correlated with the assumed beta-alpha branching ratio. We have\nremeasured the beta-alpha branching ratio by implanting 16N ions in a segmented\nSi detector and counting the number of beta-alpha decays relative to the number\nof implantations. Our result, 1.49(5)e-5, represents a 24% increase compared to\nthe accepted value and implies an increase of 14% in the extrapolated S-factor.\n", "  Materials with very low DC magnetic susceptibility have many scientific\napplications. To our knowledge however, relatively little research has been\nconducted with the goal to produce a totally nonmagnetic material. This phrase\nin our case means after spatially averaging over macroscopic volumes, it\npossesses an average zero DC magnetic susceptibility. We report measurements of\nthe DC magnetic susceptibility of three different types of nonmagnetic\nmaterials at room temperature: (I) solutions of paramagnetic salts and\ndiamagnetic liquids, (II) liquid gallium-indium alloys and (III) pressed powder\nmixtures of tungsten and bismuth. The lowest measured magnetic susceptibility\namong these candidate materials is in the order of 10^-9 cgs volume\nsusceptibility units, about two orders of magnitude smaller than distilled\nwater. In all cases, the measured concentration dependence of the magnetic\nsusceptibility is consistent with that expected for the weighted sum of the\nsusceptibilities of the separate components within experimental error. These\nresults verify the Wiedemann additivity law and thereby realize the ability to\nproduce materials with small but tunable magnetic susceptibility. For our\nparticular scientific application, we are also looking for materials with the\nlargest possible number of neutrons and protons per unit volume. The\ngallium-indium alloys fabricated and measured in this work possess to our\nknowledge the smallest ratio of volume magnetic susceptibility to nucleon\nnumber density per unit volume for a room temperature liquid, and the\ntungsten-bismuth pressed powder mixtures possess to our knowledge the smallest\nratio of volume magnetic susceptibility to nucleon number density per unit\nvolume for a room temperature solid. This ratio is a figure of merit for a\ncertain class of precision experiments that search for possible exotic\nspin-dependent forces of Nature.\n", "  Recently, we reported an ion trap experiment with an integrated\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) [Phys. Rev. Appl. 2, 034013 (2014)]\nfocussing on the improvement of mass resolution and detection limit due to\nsample preparation at millikelvin temperatures. The system utilizes a\nradio-frequency (RF) ion trap with asymmetric drive for storing and\nmanipulating laser-cooled ions and features radial extraction into a compact\n$275$ mm long TOF drift tube. The mass resolution exceeds $m / \\Delta m = 500$,\nwhich provides isotopic resolution over the whole mass range of interest in\ncurrent experiments and constitutes an improvement of almost an order of\nmagnitude over other implementations. In this manuscript, we discuss the\nexperimental implementation in detail, which is comprised of newly developed\ndrive electronics for generating the required voltages to operate RF trap and\nTOFMS, as well as control electronics for regulating RF outputs and\nsynchronizing the TOFMS extraction.\n", "  This paper is devoted to study the analytic models of anisotropic compact\nstars in $f(T)$ gravity (where $T$ is torsion scalar), with non-diagonal\ntetrad. By taking the anisotropic source inside the spherically symmetric star,\nthe equations of motions have been derived in the context of $f(T)$ gravity.\nKrori and Barua metric which satisfies the physical requirement of a realistic\nstar, has been applied to describe the compact objects like strange stars. We\nuse the power law form of $f(T)$ model to determine explicit relations of\nmatter variables. Further, we have found the anisotropic behavior, energy\nconditions, stability and surface redshift of stars. Using the masses and radii\nof 4$U$1820-30, Her X-1, SAX J 1808-3658, we have determined the constants\ninvolved in metric components. Finally we discuss the graphical behavior of the\nanalytic description of strange star candiddates.\n", "  We study N=1 theories on Hermitian manifolds of the form M^4=S^1xM^3 with M^3\na U(1) fibration over S^2, and their 3d N=2 reductions. These manifolds admit\nan Heegaard-like decomposition in solid tori D^2xT^2 and D^2xS^1. We prove that\nwhen the 4d and 3d anomalies are cancelled the matrix integrands in the Coulomb\nbranch partition functions can be factorised in terms of 1-loop factors on\nD^2xT^2 and D^2xS^1 respectively. By evaluating the Coulomb branch matrix\nintegrals we show that the 4d and 3d partition functions can be expressed as\nsums of products of 4d and 3d holomorphic blocks.\n", "  The peculiar features of quantum magnetism sometimes forbid the existence of\ngapped `featureless' paramagnets which are fully symmetric and\nunfractionalized. The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is an example of such a\nconstraint, but it is not known what the most general restriction might be. We\nfocus on the existence of featureless paramagnets on the spin-1 square lattice\nand the spin-1 and spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice with spin rotation and space\ngroup symmetries in 2+1D. Although featureless paramagnet phases are not ruled\nout by any existing theorem, field theoretic arguments disfavor their\nexistence. Nevertheless, by generalizing the construction of Affleck, Kennedy,\nLieb and Tasaki to a class we call `slave-spin' states, we propose featureless\nwave functions for these models. The featureless-ness of the spin-1 slave-spin\nstates on the square and honeycomb lattice are verified both analytically and\nnumerically, but the status of the spin-1/2 honeycomb state remains unclear.\n", "  The impact of lattice type, period, porosity and thickness of two-dimensional\nsilicon phononic crystals on the reduction of thermal conductance by coherent\nmodification of phonon dispersion is investigated using the theory of\nelasticity and finite element method. Increase in the period and porosity of\nthe phononic crystal affects the group velocity and phonon density of states\nand, as a consequence, reduces the in-plane thermal conductance of the\nstructure as compared to unpatterned membrane. This reduction does not depend\nsignificantly on the lattice type and thickness of phononic crystals. Moreover,\nthe reduction is strongly temperature dependent and strengthens as the\ntemperature is increased.\n", "  We propose a simple preferential attachment model of growing network using\nthe complementary probability of Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA) model, i.e., $\\Pi(k_i)\n\\propto 1-\\frac{k_i}{\\sum_j k_j}$. In this network, new nodes are\npreferentially attached to not well connected nodes. Numerical simulations, in\nperfect agreement with the master equation solution, give an exponential degree\ndistribution. This suggests that the power law degree distribution is a\nconsequence of preferential attachment probability together with \"rich get\nricher\" phenomena. We also calculate the average degree of a target node at\ntime t $(<k_s(t)>)$ and its fluctuations, to have a better view of the\nmicroscopic evolution of the network, and we also compare the results with BA\nmodel.\n", "  Spin injection and detection in Co60Fe40-based all-metallic lateral\nspin-valves have been studied at both room and low temperatures. The obtained\nspin signals amplitudes have been compared to that of identical Ni80Fe20-based\ndevices. The replacement of Ni80Fe20 by CoFe allows increasing the spin signal\namplitude by up to one order of magnitude, thus reaching 50 m{\\Omega} at room\ntemperature. The spin signal dependence with the distance between the\nferromagnetic electrodes has been analyzed using both a 1D spin transport model\nand finite elements method simulations. The enhancement of the spin signal\namplitude when using CoFe electrodes can be explained by a higher effective\npolarization.\n", "  The ideal black body fully absorbs all incident rays, that is, all\npropagating waves created by arbitrary sources. The known idealized realization\nof a black body is the perfectly matched layer (PML), widely used in numerical\nelectromagnetics. However, ideal black bodies and PMLs do not interact with\nevanescent fields existing near any finite-size source, and the energy stored\nin these fields cannot be harvested. Here we introduce the concept of the ideal\nconjugate matched layer (CML), which fully absorbs energy of both propagating\nand evanescent fields of sources acting as an ideal sink for electromagnetic\nenergy. Conjugate matched absorbers have exciting application potentials, as\nresonant attractors of electromagnetic energy into the absorber volume. We\nderive the conditions on the constitutive parameters of media which can serve\nas CML materials, numerically study the performance of planar and cylindrical\nCML and discuss possible realizations of such materials as metal-dielectric\ncomposites.\n", "  Discrete potentials can describe properly the liquid vapor boundary that is\nnecessary to model the adsorption of gas molecules in mesoporous systems with\ncomputer simulations. Although there are some works in this subject, the\nsimulations are still highly time - consuming. Here we show that an efficient\nalternative is to use the three - dimensional Ising model, which allows one to\nmodel large systems, with geometries as complex as required that accurately\nrepresent the liquid vapor boundary. In particular, we report molecular\nsimulations of cylindrical pores of two different geometry, using a discrete\npotential. The effect of the length of the pore in the hysteresis loop for a\nfinite pore and infinite one is studied in detail. Lastly, we compare our\npredictions with experimental results and find excellent agreement between the\narea of the hysteresis loop predicted for the finite pore and that found in\nadsorption/desorption experiments.\n", "  We report on the spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and spin Seebeck effect\n(SSE) in multiferroic CoCr2O4 (CCO) spinel thin films with Pt contacts. We\nobserve a large enhancement of both signals below the spin-spiral (Ts = 28 K)\nand the spin lock-in transitions (T_{lock_in} = 14 K). The SMR and SSE response\nin the spin lock-in phase are one order of magnitude larger than those observed\nat the ferrimagnetic transition temperature (Tc = 94 K), which indicates that\nthe interaction between spins at the Pt|CCO interface is more efficient in the\nnon-collinear magnetic state below Ts and T_{lock-in}. At T > Tc, magnetic\nfield-induced SMR and SSE signals are observed, which can be explained by a\nhigh interface susceptibility. Our results show that the spin transport at the\nPt|CCO interface is sensitive to the magnetic phases but cannot be explained\nsolely by the bulk magnetization.\n", "  We present a method to semiclassically compute the pair creation rate of\nbosons and fermions in de Sitter spacetime. The results in the bosonic case\nagree with the ones in the literature. We find that for the constant electric\nfield the fermionic and bosonic pair creation rate are the same. This analogy\nof bosons and fermions in the semiclassical limit is known from several flat\nspacetime examples.\n", "  We provide new methods to straightforwardly obtain compact and analytic\nexpressions for epsilon-expansions of functions appearing in both field and\nstring theory amplitudes. An algebraic method is presented to explicitly solve\nfor recurrence relations connecting different epsilon-orders of a power series\nsolution in epsilon of a differential equation. This strategy generalizes the\nusual iteration by Picard's method. Our tools are demonstrated for generalized\nhypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we match the epsilon-expansion of\nspecific generalized hypergeometric functions with the underlying Drinfeld\nassociator with proper Lie algebra and monodromy representations. We also apply\nour tools for computing epsilon-expansions for solutions to generic first-order\nFuchsian equations (Schlesinger system). Finally, we set up our methods to\nsystematically get compact and explicit alpha'-expansions of tree-level\nsuperstring amplitudes to any order in alpha'.\n", "  van der Waals (vdW) interaction plays a fundamental role in the\nsurface-molecules related phenomena. Tuning of the correlated charge\nfluctuation in the vdW complex is a plausible way to modulate the molecules\ninteraction at the atomic surface. We report vdW interaction tunability of the\ngraphene-CO$_2$ complex by combining the first principle calculations with the\nvdW exchange correlation density functionals and the time evaluation\nmeasurements of CO$_2$ molecules adsorption/desorption on graphene under an\nexternal electric field. The field-dependent charge transfer within the complex\nunveils the controllable tuning of CO$_2$ from acceptor to donor. Meanwhile the\nconfiguration of the adsorbed molecule - the equilibrium distance from graphene\nand O-C-O bonding angle - is modified accordingly. The range of electrical\ntunability is a unique feature for each type of molecules.\n", "  Mutual forces can be induced between coupled structures when illuminated by\nexternal acoustic waves. In this Letter, we propose a concept of asymmetric\ninteraction between two coupled plate-like structures, which is generated by\noppositely incident plane waves. Besides the striking contrast in magnitude,\nthe mutual force induced by one of the incidences can be tuned extremely strong\ndue to the resonant excitation of the flexural plate modes. The highly\nasymmetric interaction with enhanced strength in single side should be\npotentially useful, such as in designing ultrasound instruments and sensors.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the statistical properties of\nthree-dimensional dissipative turbulent flows at scales larger than the forcing\nscale. Our results indicate that the large scale flow can be described to a\nlarge degree by the truncated Euler equations with the predictions of the zero\nflux solutions given by absolute equilibrium theory, both for helical and\nnon-helical flows. Thus, the functional shape of the large scale spectra can be\npredicted provided that scales sufficiently larger than the forcing length\nscale but also sufficiently smaller than the box size are examined. Deviations\nfrom the predictions of absolute equilibrium are discussed.\n", "  In the solar corona, magnetic flux rope is believed to be a fundamental\nstructure accounts for magnetic free energy storage and solar eruptions. Up to\nthe present, the extrapolation of magnetic field from boundary data is the\nprimary way to obtain fully three-dimensional magnetic information of the\ncorona. As a result, the ability of reliable recovering coronal magnetic flux\nrope is important for coronal field extrapolation. In this paper, our coronal\nfield extrapolation code (CESE-MHD-NLFFF, Jiang & Feng 2012) is examined with\nan analytical magnetic flux rope model proposed by Titov & Demoulin (1999),\nwhich consists of a bipolar magnetic configuration holding an semi-circular\nline-tied flux rope in force-free equilibrium. By using only the vector field\nin the bottom boundary as input, we test our code with the model in a\nrepresentative range of parameter space and find that the model field is\nreconstructed with high accuracy. Especially, the magnetic topological\ninterfaces formed between the flux rope and the surrounding arcade, i.e., the\n\"hyperbolic flux tube\" and \"bald patch separatrix surface\", are also reliably\nreproduced. By this test, we demonstrate that our CESE-MHD-NLFFF code can be\napplied to recovering magnetic flux rope in the solar corona as long as the\nvector magnetogram satisfies the force-free constraints.\n", "  Multi-loop scattering amplitudes in N=4 Yang-Mills theory possess cluster\nalgebra structure. In order to develop a computational framework which exploits\nthis connection, we show how to construct bases of Goncharov polylogarithm\nfunctions, at any weight, whose symbol alphabet consists of cluster coordinates\non the $A_n$ cluster algebra. Using such a basis we present a new expression\nfor the 2-loop 6-particle NMHV amplitude which makes some of its cluster\nstructure manifest.\n", "  We investigate quasi-periodic coronal pulsations during the decay phase of an\nX 3.2 class flare on 14 May 2013, using soft X-ray data from the RHESSI\nsatellite. Periodogram analyses of soft X-ray light curves show that 53 s and\n72 s periods co-exist in the 3-6, 6-12 and 12-25 KeV energy bands. Considering\nthe typical length of the flaring loop system and observed periodicities, we\nfind that they are associated with multiple (first two harmonics) of fast\nmagnetoacoustic sausage waves. The phase relationship of soft X-ray emissions\nin different energy bands using cross-correlation technique show that these\nmodes are standing in nature as we do not find the phase lag. Considering the\nperiod ratio, we diagnose the local plasma conditions of the flaring region by\ninvoking MHD seismology. The period ratio P1/2P2 is found to be 0.65, which\nindicates that such oscillations are most likely excited in longitudinal\ndensity stratified loops.\n", "  Ag atoms have been deposited on 3x3 silicene and R3xR3 silicene films by\nmolecular beam epitaxy method in ultrahigh vacuum. Using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we found that Ag atoms do not form chemical\nbonds with both 3x3 silicene and R3xR3 silicene films,which is due to\nchemically inert surface of silicene. On 3x3 silicene films, Ag atoms mostly\nform into stable flat top Ag islands. In contrast, Ag atoms form nanoclusters\nand glide on silicene films, suggesting more inert nature. Raman spectroscopy\nsuggests that there is more sp2 hybridization in R3xR3 than in\nR7xR7/3x3silicene films\n", "  We have applied the graphical user interfaced close binary system analysis\nprogram WinFitter to an intensive study of Kepler 91 using all the available\nphotometry from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) at the Caltech website:\nhttp://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu . Our fitting function for the tidal\ndistortion derives from the relevant Radau equation and includes terms up to\nthe fifth power of the fractional radius. This results in a systematic\nimprovement in the mass ratio estimation over that of Lillo Box et al (2014a)\nand our derived value for the mass ratio is in close agreement with that\ninferred from recent high-resolution spectroscopic data. It is clear that the\ndata analysis in terms of simply an eclipsing binary system is compromised by\nthe presence of significant other causes of light variation, in particular\nnon-radial pulsations. We apply a low-frequency filtering procedure to separate\nout some of this additional light variation. Whilst the derived eccentricity\nappears then reduced, an eccentric effect remains in the light curve. We\nconsider how this may be maintained in spite of likely frictional effects\noperating over a long time. There are also indications of the possible effects\nof Trojan or other period-resonant mass concentrations. Suggestions of a\npossible secular period variation are briefly discussed.\n", "  A sensitivity of the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider in a search for the rare\ndecay $\\eta \\rightarrow e^+ e^-$ has been studied. The inverse reaction $e^+\ne^- \\rightarrow \\eta$ is proposed for this search. We have analyzed a data\nsample with an integrated luminosity of 108 nb$^{-1}$ collected with the SND\ndetector in the center-of-mass energy range 520-580 MeV and found no background\nevents for the reaction $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow \\eta$ in the decay mode\n$\\eta\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0\\pi^0$. In the absence of background, a sensitivity to ${\\cal\nB}(\\eta \\rightarrow e^+ e^-)$ of $10^{-6}$ can be reached during two weeks of\nVEPP-2000 operation. Such a sensitivity is better than the current upper limit\non ${\\cal B}(\\eta \\rightarrow e^+ e^-)$ by a factor of 2.3.\n", "  We present an experimental and theoretical study exploring surface effects on\nthe evolution of the metal-insulator transition in the model Mott-Hubbard\ncompound Cr-doped V$_2$O$_3$. We find a microscopic domain formation that is\nclearly affected by the surface crystallographic orientation. Using scanning\nphotoelectron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find that surface defects\nact as nucleation centers for the formation of domains at the\ntemperature-induced isostructural transition and favor the formation of\nmicroscopic metallic regions. A density functional theory plus dynamical mean\nfield theory study of different surface terminations shows that the surface\nreconstruction with excess vanadyl cations leads to doped, and hence more\nmetallic surface states, explaining our experimental observations.\n", "  Four-wave mixing in atomic vapor allows for the generation of\nmulti-spatial-mode states of light containing many pairs of two-mode entangled\nvacuum beams. This in principle can be used to send independent secure keys to\nmultiple parties simultaneously using a single light source. In our experiment,\nwe demonstrate this spatial multiplexing of information by selecting three\nindependent pairs of entangled modes and performing continuous-variable\nmeasurements to verify the correlations between entangled partners. In this\nway, we generate three independent pairs of correlated random bit streams that\ncould be used as secure keys. We then demonstrate a classical four-party secret\nsharing scheme as an example for how this spatially multiplexed source could be\nused.\n", "  Fluctuating hydrodynamics has been successfully combined with several\ncomputational methods to rapidly compute the correlated random velocities of\nBrownian particles. In the overdamped limit where both particle and fluid\ninertia are ignored, one must also account for a Brownian drift term in order\nto successfully update the particle positions. In this paper, we present an\nefficient computational method for the dynamic simulation of Brownian\nsuspensions with fluctuating hydrodynamics that handles both computations and\nprovides a similar approximation as Stokesian Dynamics for dilute and\nsemidilute suspensions. This advancement relies on combining the fluctuating\nforce-coupling method (FCM) with a new midpoint time-integration scheme we\nrefer to as the drifter-corrector (DC). The DC resolves the drift term for\nfluctuating hydrodynamics-based methods at a minimal computational cost when\nconstraints are imposed on the fluid flow to obtain the stresslet corrections\nto the particle hydrodynamic interactions. With the DC, this constraint need\nonly be imposed once per time step, reducing the simulation cost to nearly that\nof a completely deterministic simulation. By performing a series of\nsimulations, we show that the DC with fluctuating FCM is an effective and\nversatile approach as it reproduces both the equilibrium distribution and the\nevolution of particulate suspensions in periodic as well as bounded domains. In\naddition, we demonstrate that fluctuating FCM coupled with the DC provides an\nefficient and accurate method for large-scale dynamic simulation of colloidal\ndispersions and the study of processes such as colloidal gelation.\n", "  We study the quantum evolution of a two-spin system described by the\nisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian in the external magnetic field. It is shown\nthat this evolution happens on a two-parametric closed manifold. The\nFubini-Study metric of this manifold is obtained. It is found that this is the\nmetric of the torus. The entanglement of the states which belong to this\nmanifold is investigated.\n", "  The jamming transition of particles with finite-range interactions is\ncharacterized by a variety of critical phenomena, including power law\ndistributions of marginal contacts. We numerically study a recently proposed\nsimple model of jamming, which is conjectured to lie in the same universality\nclass as the jamming of spheres in all dimensions. We extract numerical\nestimates of the critical exponents, {\\theta} = 0.451 $\\pm$ 0.006 and {\\gamma}\n= 0.404 $\\pm$ 0.004, that match the exponents observed in sphere packing\nsystems. We analyze finite-size scaling effects that manifest in a subcritical\ncutoff regime and size-independent, but protocol-dependent scaling curves. Our\nresults supports the conjectured link with sphere jamming, provide more precise\nmeasurements of the critical exponents than previously reported, and shed light\non the finite-size scaling behavior of continuous constraint satisfiability\ntransitions.\n", "  We reported the optical observations of GRB 121011A by 0.8-m TNT telescope at\nXinglong observatory, China. The light curve of optical afterglow shows a\nsmooth and featureless bump during the epoch of $\\sim$130 sec and $\\sim$5000\nsec with a rising index of $1.57\\pm0.28$ before the break time of $539\\pm44$\nsec, and a decaying index of about $1.29\\pm0.07$ up to the end of our\nobservations. Meanwhile, the X-ray light curve decays in a single power-law\nwith a slop of about $1.51\\pm0.03$ observed by $XRT$ onboard ${\\rm} Swift$ from\n100 sec to about 10000 sec after the burst trigger. The featureless optical\nlight curve could be understood as an onset process under the external-shock\nmodel. The typical frequency has been below or near the optical one before the\ndeceleration time, and the cooling frequency is located between the optical and\nX-ray wavelengths. The external medium density has a transition from a mixed\nstage of ISM and wind-type medium before the peak time to the ISM at the later\nphase. The joint-analysis of X-ray and optical light curves shows that the\nemission from both frequencies are consistent with the prediction of the\nstandard afterglow model without any energy injections, indicating that the\ncentral engine has stopped its activity and does not restart anymore after the\nprompt phase.\n", "  Cosmological models may result in future singularities. We show that, in the\nframework of dynamical varying speed of light theories, it is possible to\nregularize those singularities.\n", "  We study the collision of planar shock waves in AdS$_5$ as a function of\nshock profile. In the dual field theory the shock waves describe planar sheets\nof energy whose collision results in the formation of a plasma which behaves\nhydrodynamically at late times. We find that the post-collision stress tensor\nnear the light cone exhibits transient non-universal behavior which depends on\nboth the shock width and the precise functional form of the shock profile.\nHowever, over a large range of shock widths, including those which yield\nqualitative different behavior near the future light cone, and for different\nshock profiles, we find universal behavior in the subsequent hydrodynamic\nevolution. Additionally, we compute the rapidity distribution of produced\nparticles and find it to be well described by a Gaussian.\n", "  We utilize the relation between soliton solutions of the mKdV and the\ncombined mKdV-KdV equation and the Dirac equation to construct electrostatic\nfields which yield exact zero energy states of graphene.\n", "  We study the propagation of non-interacting polariton wavepackets. We show\nhow two qualitatively different concepts of mass that arise from the peculiar\npolariton dispersion lead to a new type of particle-like object from\nnon-interacting fields---much like self-accelerating beams---shaped by the Rabi\ncoupling out of Gaussian initial states. A divergence and change of sign of the\ndiffusive mass results in a \"mass wall\" on which polariton wavepackets bounce\nback. Together with the Rabi dynamics, this yield propagation of ultrafast\nsubpackets and ordering of a spacetime crystal.\n", "  The 3-d inverse scattering problem of the reconstruction of the unknown\ndielectric permittivity in the generalized Helmholtz equation is considered.\nThe main difference with the conventional inverse scattering problems is that\nonly the modulus of the scattering wave field is measured. The phase is not\nmeasured. The initializing wave field is the incident plane wave. On the other\nhand, in the previous recent works of the authors about the \"phaseless topic\"\nthe case of the point source was considered [20,21,22]. Two reconstruction\nprocedures are developed for a linearized case. However, the linearization is\nnot the Born approximation. This means that, unlike the Born approximation, our\nlinearization does not break down when the frequency tends to the infinity.\nApplications are in imaging of nanostructures and biological cells.\n", "  We report on the construction of a UHV compatible 40 mm active diameter\ndetector based on micro channel plates and assembled directly on the\nfeed-throughs of a DN63CF flange. It is based on the charge division technique\nand uses a standard two inch Si wafer as a collector. The front end electronic\nis placed directly on the air side of the flange allowing excellent immunity to\nnoise and a very good timing signal with reduced ringing. The important\naberrations are corrected empirically providing and absolute positioning\naccuracy of 500 $\\mu$m while a 150 $\\mu$m resolution is measured in the center.\n", "  We determine the structure of band and gaps in graphene encapsulated in\nhexagonal boron nitride and subjected to magnetic field of Abrikosov lattice of\nvortices in the underlying superconducting film. The spectrum features one\nnon-dispersive magnetic miniband at zero energy, separated by the largest gaps\nin the miniband spectrum from a pair of minibands resembling slightly broadened\nfirst Landau levels in graphene, suggesting the persistence of $\\nu = \\pm 2$\nquantum Hall effect states. Also, we identify occasional merging point of\nmagnetic minibands which feature Dirac-type dispersion at the consecutive\nminiband edges.\n", "  The (111) surface of SnTe hosts one isotropic $\\bar{\\Gamma}$-centered and\nthree degenerate anisotropic $\\bar{M}$- centered Dirac surface states. We\npredict that a nematic phase with spontaneously broken $C_3$ symmetry will\noccur in the presence of an external magnetic field when the $N=0$ $\\bar{M}$\nLandau levels are $1/3$ or $2/3$ filled. The nematic state phase boundary is\ncontrolled by a competition between intravalley Coulomb interactions that favor\na valley-polarized state, and weaker intervalley scattering processes that\nincrease in relative strength with magnetic field. An in-plane Zeeman field\nalters the phase diagram by lifting the three-fold $\\bar{M}$ Landau level\ndegeneracy, yielding a ground state energy with $2\\pi/3$ periodicity as a\nfunction of Zeeman-field orientation angle.\n", "  Between many prominent contributions of Markus Buttiker to mesoscopic\nphysics, the scattering theory approach to the electron transport and noise\nstands out for its elegance, simplicity, universality, and popularity between\ntheorists working in this field. It offers an efficient way to theoretically\ninvestigate open electron systems far from equilibrium. However, this method is\nlimited to situations where interactions between electrons can be ignored, or\nconsidered perturbatively. Fortunately, this is the case in a broad class of\nmetallic systems, which are commonly described by the Fermi liquid theory. Yet,\nthere exist another broad class of electron systems of reduced dimensionality,\nthe so-called Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, where interactions are effectively\nstrong and cannot be neglected even at low energies. Nevertheless, strong\ninteractions can be accounted exactly using the bosonization technique, which\nutilizes the free-bosonic character of collective excitations in these systems.\nIn the present work, we use this fact in order to develop the scattering theory\napproach to the bosonization of open quasi-one dimensional electron systems far\nfrom equilibrium.\n", "  The universal expression for the amplitude square |u_f M u_i|^2 for any\nmatrix of interaction M is derived. It has obvious covariant form. It allows\nthe avoidance of calculation of products of the Dirac's matrices traces and\nallows easy calculation of cross-sections of any different processes with\npolarized and unpolarized particles.\n", "  Dynamical scattering of binaries and triple systems of stars, planets, and\ncompact objects may produce highly inclined triple systems subject to\nKozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations, potentially leading to collisions, mergers, Type\nIa supernovae, and other phenomena. We present the results of more than 400\nmillion gravitational scattering experiments of binary-binary, triple-single,\nand triple-binary scattering. We compute the cross sections for all possible\noutcomes and explore their dependencies on incoming velocity, mass, semi-major\naxis, and eccentricity, including analytic fits and discussion of the velocity\ndependence. For the production of new triple systems by scattering we find that\ncompact triples are preferred, with ratios of outer to inner semi-major axes of\n~few--100, flat or quasi-thermal eccentricity distributions, and flat\ndistributions in cosine of the mutual inclination. Dynamically formed triples\nare thus subject to strong KL oscillations, the \"eccentric Kozai mechanism,\"\nand non-secular effects. For single and binary flyby encounters with triple\nsystems, we compute the cumulative cross section for changes to the mutual\ninclination, eccentricity, and semi-major axis ratio. We apply these results to\nscattering events in the field, open clusters, and globular clusters, and\nexplore the implications for Type Ia supernovae via collisions and mergers,\nstellar collisions, and the lifetime and dynamical isolation of triple systems\nundergoing KL oscillations. An Appendix provides an analysis of the velocity\ndependence of the collision cross section in binary-single scattering.\n", "  We study rotating thermal convection in spherical shells. We base our\nanalysis on a set of about 450 direct numerical simulations of the\n(magneto)hydrodynamic equations under the Boussinesq approximation. The Ekman\nnumber ranges from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$. The supercriticality of the\nconvection reaches about 1000 in some models. Four sets of simulations are\nconsidered: non-magnetic simulations and dynamo simulations with either\nfree-slip or no-slip flow boundary conditions. The non-magnetic setup with\nfree-slip boundaries generates the strongest zonal flows. Both non-magnetic\nsimulations with no-slip flow boundary conditions and self-consistent dynamos\nwith free-slip boundaries have drastically reduced zonal-flows. Suppression of\nshear leads to a substantial gain in heat-transfer efficiency, increasing by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases. Such efficiency enhancement occurs as long as the\nconvection is significantly influenced by rotation. At higher convective\ndriving the heat-transfer efficiency tends towards that of the classical\nnon-rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard system. Analysis of the latitudinal distribution\nof heat flow at the outer boundary reveals that the shear is most effective at\nsuppressing heat-transfer in the equatorial regions. Furthermore, we explore\nthe influence of the magnetic field on the {\\em non-zonal} flow components of\nthe convection. For this we compare the heat-transfer efficiency of no-slip\nnon-magnetic cases with that of the no-slip dynamo simulations. We find that at\n$E=10^{-5}$ magnetic field significantly affects the convection and a maximum\ngain of about 30\\% (as compared to the non-magnetic case) in heat-transfer\nefficiency is obtained for an Elsasser number of about 3. Our analysis\nmotivates us to speculate that convection in the polar regions in dynamos at\n$E=10^{-5}$ is probably in a `magnetostrophic' regime.\n", "  The preparation of a quantum degenerate gas of heteronuclear molecules has\nbeen an outstanding challenge. We use path integral Quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations to understand the role of interactions and finite temperature\neffects in the protocol currently employed to adiabatically prepare a\nlow-entropy gas of polar molecules in a lattice starting from an ultracold\nBose-Fermi mixture. We find that interspecies interactions affect the final\ntemperature of the mixture after the adiabatic loading procedure and\ndetrimentally limit the molecular peak filling. Our conclusions are in\nagreement with recent experimental measurements [1] and therefore are of\nimmediate relevance for the myriad experiments that aim to form molecules from\ndual-species atomic gases.\n", "  We present a classification of quantum public-key encryption protocols. There\nare six elements in quantum public-key encryption: plaintext, ciphertext,\npublic-key, private-key, encryption algorithm and decryption algorithm.\nAccording to the property of each element which is either quantum or classical,\nthe quantum public-key encryption protocols can be divided into 64 kinds. Among\n64 kinds of protocols, 8 kinds have already been constructed, 52 kinds can be\nproved to be impossible to construct and the remaining 4 kinds have not been\npresented effectively yet. This indicates that the research on quantum\npublic-key encryption protocol should be focus on the existed kinds and the\nunproposed kinds.\n", "  0.8 GeV proton inelastic scatterings from $^{40}$Ar nucleus are analyzed\nusing an optical potential model in the Dirac coupled channel formalism. A\nrotational collective model is used to obtain the transition optical potentials\nfor the low lying excited states of the rotational band. The optical potential\nparameters of a Woods-Saxon shape and the deformation parameters of the excited\nstates are searched phenomenologically to reproduce the experimental\ndifferential cross-section data by using the sequential iteration method. The\neffect of a multistep process is investigated by including the channel coupling\nbetween two excited states in addition to the couplings between the ground\nstate and the excited states. The calculated deformation parameters of the\nexcited states are compared with those obtained by using the nonrelativistic\ncalculations. The results of the Dirac coupled channel calculations are found\nto show pretty good agreements with the experimental data of the ground state\nand the low-lying excited states. The multistep excitation process via the\nchannel coupling with the second $2^+$ state is found to be important for the\nexcitation of the $4^+$ state at the inelastic scatterings from the deformed\nnucleus, $^{40}$Ar.\n", "  Dynamic correlations of quantum magnets provide valuable information.\nHowever, especially at finite temperature, many observations, e.g., by\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments, are not yet quantitatively\nunderstood. Generically, the elementary excitations of gapped quantum magnets\nare hardcore bosons because no two of them can occupy the same site. The\npreviously introduced diagrammatic Br\\\"uckner approach dealt with hardcore\nbosons of a single flavor at finite temperature. Here, this approach is\nextended to hardcore bosons of several kinds (flavors). The approach based on\nladder diagrams is gauged with so far unknown rigorous results for the thermal\noccupation function of multiflavored hardcore bosons in one dimension with\nnearest-neighbor hopping. For low temperatures, it works very well.\nFurthermore, we study to which extent the approach is a conserving\napproximation. Empirical evidence shows that this is true only in the\nsingle-flavor case.\n", "  Understanding how laser light scatters from realistic mirror surfaces is\ncrucial for the design, com- missioning and operation of precision\ninterferometers, such as the current and next generation of gravitational-wave\ndetectors. Numerical simulations are indispensable tools for this task but\ntheir utility can in practice be limited by the computational cost of\ndescribing the scattering process. In this paper we present an efficient method\nto significantly reduce the computational cost of optical simulations that\nincorporate scattering. This is accomplished by constructing a near optimal\nrepresentation of the complex, multi-parameter 2D overlap integrals that\ndescribe the scattering process (referred to as a reduced order quadrature). We\ndemonstrate our technique by simulating a near-unstable Fabry-Perot cavity and\nits control signals using similar optics to those installed in one of the LIGO\ngravitational-wave detectors. We show that using reduced order quadrature\nreduces the computational time of the numerical simulation from days to minutes\n(a speed-up of $\\approx 2750 \\times$) whilst incurring negligible errors. This\nsignificantly increases the feasibility of modelling interferometers with\nrealistic imperfections to overcome current limits in state-of-the-art optical\nsystems. Whilst we focus on the Hermite-Gaussian basis for describing the\nscattering of the optical fields, our method is generic and could be applied\nwith any suitable basis. An implementation of this reduced order quadrature\nmethod is provided in the open source interferometer simulation software\nFinesse.\n", "  A theory of image-potential states is presented for the general case where\nthese surface electronic states are resonant with a bulk continuum. The theory\nextends the multiple scattering approach of Echenique and Pendry into the\nstrong coupling regime while retaining independence from specific forms of\nsurface and bulk potentials. The theory predicts the existence of a\nwell-resolved series of resonances for arbitrary coupling strengths.\nSurprisingly, distinct image-potential resonances are thus expected to exist on\nalmost any metal surface, even in the limiting case of jellium.\n", "  We consider the touchdown of an elastic sheet as it adheres to a wall, which\nhas a dynamics that is limited by the viscous resistance provided by the\nsqueeze flow of the intervening liquid trapped between the two solid surfaces.\nThe dynamics of the sheet is described mathematically by elastohydrodynamic\nlubrication theory, coupling the elastic deformation of the sheet, the\nmicroscopic van der Waals adhesion and the viscous thin film flow. We use a\ncombination of numerical simulations of the governing partial differential\nequation and a scaling analysis to describe the self-similar solution of the\ntouchdown of the sheet as it approaches the wall. An analysis of the equation\nsatisfied by the similarity variables in the vicinity of the touchdown event\nshows that an entire sequence of solutions are allowed. However, a comparison\nof these shows that only the fundamental similarity solution is observed in the\ntime-dependent numerical simulations, consistent with the fact that it alone is\nstable. Our analysis generalizes similar approaches for rupture in capillary\nthin film hydrodynamics and suggests experimentally verifiable predictions for\na new class of singular flows linking elasticity, hydrodynamics and adhesion.\n", "  Resonant field amplification or error field penetration involves driving a\nweakly stable tearing perturbation in a rotating toroidal plasma. In this paper\nit is shown that the locking characteristics for modes with finite real\nfrequencies $\\omega_{r}$ are quite different from the conventional results. A\ncalculation of the tearing mode amplitude assuming modes with frequencies\n$\\pm\\omega_{r}$ in the plasma frame shows that it is maximized when the\nfrequency of the stable backward propagating mode ($-\\omega_{r}$) in the lab\nframe is zero, i.e. when $v=\\omega_{r}/k$. Even more importantly, the locking\ntorque is exactly zero at the mode phase velocity, with a pronounced peak at\njust higher rotation, leading to a locked state with plasma velocity $v$ just\nabove the mode phase velocity in the lab frame. Real frequencies\n$\\pm\\omega_{r}$, leading to a $v\\rightarrow-v$ symmetry, are known to occur due\nto the Glasser effect [A.H. Glasser, J.M. Greene, and J.M. Johnson, Phys.\nFluids {\\bf 19}, 567 (1976).] for modes in the resistive-inertial (RI) regime.\nThis therefore leads to locking of the plasma velocity to just above the phase\nvelocity. It is also shown that similar real frequencies occur over a range of\nparameters in the visco-resistive (VR) regime with pressure, and the locking\ntorque is similar to that in the RI regime. Real frequencies occur due to\ndiamagnetic effects in other tearing mode regimes and also show this effect,\nbut without the $v\\rightarrow-v$ symmetry. Nonlinear effects on the mode\namplitude and torque for weakly stable modes or large error fields are\ndiscussed. Also, the possibility of applying external fields of different\nhelicities to drive sheared flows in toroidal plasmas is discussed.\n", "  Despite the importance of Si:P delta-doped wires for modern nanoelectronics,\nthere are currently no computational models of electron transport in these\ndevices. In this paper we present a nonequilibrium Green's function model for\nelectronic transport in a delta-doped wire, which is described by a\ntight-binding Hamiltonian matrix within a single-band effective-mass\napproximation. We use this transport model to calculate the current-voltage\ncharacteristics of a number of delta-doped wires, achieving good agreement with\nexperiment. To motivate our transport model we have performed\ndensity-functional calculations for a variety of delta-doped wires, each with\ndifferent donor configurations. These calculations also allow us to accurately\ndefine the electronic extent of a delta-doped wire, which we find to be at\nleast 4.6 nm.\n", "  We investigate charge conductance and spin and valley polarization along with\nthe tunnelling magneto-resistance (TMR) in silicene junctions composed of\nnormal silicene and ferromagnetic silicene. We show distinct features of the\nconductances for parallel and anti-parallel spin configurations and the TMR, as\nthe ferromagnetic-normal-ferromagnetic (FNF) junction is tuned by an external\nelectric field. We analyse the behavior of the charge conductance and valley\nand spin polarizations in terms of the independent conductances of the\ndifferent spins at the two valleys and the band structure of ferromagnetic\nsilicene and show how the conductances are affected by the vanishing of the\npropagating states at one or the other valley. In particular, unlike in\ngraphene, the band structure at the two valleys are independently affected by\nthe spin in the ferromagnetic regions and lead to non-zero, and in certain\nparameter regimes, pure valley and spin polarizations, which can be tuned by\nthe external electric field. We also investigate the oscillatory behavior of\nthe TMR with respect to the strength of the barrier potential (both\nspin-independent and spin-dependent barriers) in the normal silicene region and\nnote that in some parameter regimes, the TMR can even go from positive to\nnegative values, as a function of the external electric field.\n", "  We investigate a mechanism for cooling a lead based on a process that\nreplaces hot electrons by cold ones. The central idea is that a double quantum\ndot with an inhomogeneous Zeeman splitting acts as energy filter for the\ntransported electrons. The setup is such that hot electrons with spin up are\nremoved, while cold electrons with spin down are added. The required\nnon-equilibrium condition is provided by the capacitive coupling of one quantum\ndot to the shot noise of a strongly biased quantum point contact in the\ntunnelling limit. Special attention is paid to the identification of an\noperating regime in which the net electrical current vanishes.\n", "  The effects of radiation reaction force on laser driven auto-resonant\nparticle acceleration scheme are studied using Landau-Lifshitz equation of\nmotion. These studies are carried out for both linear as well as circularly\npolarized laser fields in the presence of static axial magnetic field. From the\nparametric study, a radiation reaction dominated region has been identified in\nwhich the particle dynamics is greatly effected by this force. In the radiation\nreaction dominated region the two significant effects on particle dynamics are\nseen viz., (1) saturation in energy gain by the initially resonant particle,\n(2) net energy gain by a initially non-resonant particle which is caused due to\nresonance broadening. It has been further shown that with the optimum choice of\nparameters this scheme can be efficiently used to produce electrons with\nenergies in the range of hundreds of TeV. The quantum corrections to the\nLandu-Lifshitz equation of motion have also been taken into account. The\ndifference in the energy gain estimates of the particle by the quantum\ncorrected and classical Landu-Lifshitz equation are found to be insignificant\nfor the present day as well as upcoming laser facilities.\n", "  It was shown that the divalent rare earth ions (La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Lu, and Y) in\ncubic sites in alkaline earth fluorides are unstable with respect to electron\nautodetachment since its d1(eg) ground state is located in the conduction band\nwhich is consistent with the general tendency of these ions in various\ncompounds. The localization of doubly degenerate d1(eg) level in the conduction\nband creates a configuration instability around the divalent rare earth ion\nthat leading to the formation of anion vacancy in the nearest neighborhood, as\nwas reported in the previous paper [Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids\n74 (2013) 530-534]. Thus, the formation of the stable divalent ions as La, Ce,\nGd, Tb, Lu, and Y (PC+ centers) in CaF2 and SrF2 crystals during x-ray\nirradiation occurs via the formation of charged anion vacancies near divalent\nions (Re2+va), which lower the ground state of the divalent ion relative to the\nconductivity band. Photochromic effect occurs under thermally or optically\nstimulated electron transition from the divalent rare earth ion to the\nneighboring anion vacancy and reverse under ultraviolet light irradiation.\n", "  We performed coplanar waveguide-based broadband ferromagnetic resonance\nexperiments on the antiferromagnetic insulator MnF$_2$, while simultaneously\nrecording the DC voltage arising in a thin platinum film deposited onto the\nMnF$_2$. The antiferromagnetic resonance is clearly reflected in both the\ntransmission through the waveguide as well as the DC voltage in the Pt strip.\nThe DC voltage remains largely unaffected by field reversal and thus presumably\nstems from microwave rectification and/or heating effects. However, we identify\na small magnetic field orientation dependent contribution, compatible with\nantiferromagnetic spin pumping theory.\n", "  Decoherence of a central spin coupled to an interacting spin bath via\ninhomogeneous Heisenberg coupling is studied by two different approaches,\nnamely an exact equations of motion (EOMs) method and a Chebyshev expansion\ntechnique (CET). By assuming a wheel topology of the bath spins with uniform\nnearest-neighbor $XX$-type intrabath coupling, we examine the central spin\ndynamics with the bath prepared in two different types of bath initial\nconditions. For fully polarized baths in strong magnetic fields, the\npolarization dynamics of the central spin exhibits a collapse-revival behavior\nin the intermediate-time regime. Under an antiferromagnetic bath initial\ncondition, the two methods give excellently consistent central spin decoherence\ndynamics for finite-size baths of $N\\leq14$ bath spins. The decoherence factor\nis found to drop off abruptly on a short time scale and approach a finite\nplateau value which depends on the intrabath coupling strength\nnon-monotonically. In the ultrastrong intrabath coupling regime, the plateau\nvalues show an oscillatory behavior depending on whether $N/2$ is even or odd.\nThe observed results are interpreted qualitatively within the framework of the\nEOM and perturbation analysis. The effects of anisotropic spin-bath coupling\nand inhomogeneous intrabath bath couplings are briefly discussed. Possible\nexperimental realization of the model in a modified quantum corral setup is\nsuggested.\n", "  Non-topological solitons (Q-balls) are discussed in some stringy settings.\nOur main result is that the dielectric D-brane system of Myers admits\nnon-abelian Q-ball solutions on their world-volume, in which $N$ D$p$-branes\nrelax to the standard dielectric form outside the Q-ball, but assume a more\ndiffuse configuration at its centre. We also consider how Q-balls behave in the\nbulk of extra-dimensional theories, or on wrapped branes. We demonstrate that\nthey carry Kaluza-Klein charge and possess a corresponding Kaluza-Klein tower\nof states just as normal particles, and we discuss surface energy effects by\nfinding exact Q-ball solutions in models with a specific logarithmic potential.\n", "  A recently announced discovery by LHCb of a doublet of overlapping pentaquark\nresonances poses a question of what can be the origin of this doublet\nstructure. We attract attention to the fact that such degeneracy could\nnaturally arise if constituent \"baryon\" and \"meson\" were in the colored rather\nthan colorless states. This is an appealing possibility, also because in such a\ncase the pentaquark state would be no less \"elementary\" than the other hadrons,\nand would provide a chance for essentially new non-Abelian chemistry.\n", "  We present a Kadanoff-Baym formalism to study time-dependent phenomena for\nsystems of interacting electrons and phonons in the framework of many-body\nperturbation theory. The formalism takes correctly into account effects of the\ninitial preparation of an equilibrium state, and allows for an explicit\ntime-dependence of both the electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. The\nmethod is applied to investigate the charge neutral and non-neutral excitation\nspectra of a homogeneous, two-site, two-electron Holstein model. This is an\nextension of a previous study of the ground state properties in the Hartree\n(H), partially self-consistent Born (Gd) and fully self-consistent Born (GD)\napproximations published in Ref. [arXiv:1403.2968]. We show that choosing a\nhomogeneous ground state solution leads to unstable dynamics for a sufficiently\nstrong interaction, and that allowing a symmetry-broken state prevents this.\nThe instability is caused by the bifurcation of the ground state and understood\nphysically to be connected with the bipolaronic crossover of the exact system.\nThis mean-field instability persists in the partially self-consistent Born\napproximation but is not found for the fully self-consistent Born\napproximation. By understanding the stability properties, we are able to study\nthe linear response regime by calculating the density-density response function\nby time-propagation. This functions amounts to a solution of the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation with a sophisticated kernel. The results indicate that none of the\napproximations is able to describe the response function during or beyond the\nbipolaronic crossover for the parameters investigated. Overall, we provide an\nextensive discussion on when the approximations are valid, and how they fail to\ndescribe the studied exact properties of the chosen model system.\n", "  The demonstration and use of nonlocality, as defined by Bell's theorem, rely\nstrongly on dealing with non-detection events due to losses and detector\ninefficiencies. Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited.\nThe only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a\ncertain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited\ndetection efficiency, e.g. in each run of the experiment the overall detection\nefficiency is lower bounded by $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial\nscenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the\ninefficiencies. We analyze the set of possible correlations that fulfil Limited\nDetection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear\nBell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts violation of one\nof these inequalities for all $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be\ndemonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies. Finally we\npropose a generalized scheme that uses this characterization to deal with\ndetection inefficiencies, which interpolates between the two usual schemes,\npostselection and outcome assignment.\n", "  We present an analysis of the different types of noise from the detection and\ninterrogation laser in our strontium lattice clock. We develop a noise model\nshowing that in our setup quantum projection noise--limited detection is\npossible if more than 130~atoms are interrogated. Adding information about the\nnoise spectrum of our clock laser with sub-$10^{-16}$ fractional frequency\ninstability allows to infer the clock stability for different modes of\noperation. Excellent agreement with experimental observations for the\ninstability of the difference between two interleaved stabilizations is found.\nWe infer a clock instability of $1.6 \\times 10^{-16}/\\sqrt{\\tau / \\mathrm{s}}$\nas a function of averaging time $\\tau$ for normal clock operation.\n", "  The massive six-dimensional (6D) superparticle with manifest (n,0)\nsupersymmetry is shown to have a supertwistor formulation in which its \"hidden\"\n(0,n) supersymmetry is also manifest. The mass-shell constraint is replaced by\nSpin(5) spin-shell constraints which imply that the quantum superparticle has\nzero superspin, for n=1 it propagates the 6D Proca supermultiplet.\n", "  We provide a concise overview on transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton\ndistribution functions, their application to topical issues in high-energy\nphysics phenomenology, and their theoretical connections with QCD resummation,\nevolution and factorization theorems. We illustrate the use of TMDs via\nexamples of multi-scale problems in hadronic collisions. These include\ntransverse momentum q_T spectra of Higgs and vector bosons for low q_T, and\nazimuthal correlations in the production of multiple jets associated with heavy\nbosons at large jet masses. We discuss computational tools for TMDs, and\npresent an application of a new tool, TMDlib, to parton density fits and\nparameterizations.\n", "  We present a series of arguments against the results of the paper \"Universal\ndecoherence due to gravitational time dilation\" by Pikovski et al.\n(arXiv:1311.1095).\n", "  We present a development of a high precision, tunable far-infrared\n(terahertz) frequency-domain dielectric spectrometer for studying the dynamics\nof biomolecules in aqueous solutions in the gigahertz-to-terahertz frequency.\nAs a first application we report on the measurement of the absorption and\nrefractive index for liquid water in the frequency range from 5 GHz to 1.12 THz\n(0.17 to 37.36 cm-1 or 0.268 to 60 mm). The system provides a coherent\nradiation source with a power up to 20 mW in the gigahertz-to-terahertz region.\nThe power signal-to-noise ratio of our instrument reaches 1015 and the system\nachieves a spectral resolution of less than 100 Hz. The temperature of samples\ncan be controlled precisely with an error bars of 0.02 oC from above 0 oC to 90\noC. Given these attributes, our spectrometer provides unique capabilities for\nthe accurate measurement of even very strongly absorbing materials such as\naqueous solutions.\n", "  We calculate the one loop beta function for the would-be marginal coupling on\nthe world sheet of the k deformed sigma models associated to a quantum group\nwith q=exp(i pi/k). This includes the bosonic principal chiral models and\nsymmetric space sigma models but also the k deformed semi-symmetric space sigma\nmodel describing strings in a deformation of AdS_5 x S^5. The world sheet sigma\nmodel is a current-current deformation of the gauged WZW model for the\nsupergroup PSU(2,2|4) with level k. In the string theory context the beta\nfunction is shown to vanish because of the vanishing of the Killing form of\nPSU(2,2|4) which is another piece of evidence that the k deformed theories\ndefine consistent string theories.\n", "  We study chiral deformations of ${\\cal N}=2$ and ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric\ngauge theories obtained by turning on $\\tau_J \\,{\\rm tr} \\, \\Phi^J$\ninteractions with $\\Phi$ the ${\\cal N}=2$ superfield. Using localization, we\ncompute the deformed gauge theory partition function $Z(\\vec\\tau|q)$ and the\nexpectation value of circular Wilson loops $W$ on a squashed four-sphere. In\nthe case of the deformed ${\\cal N}=4$ theory, exact formulas for $Z$ and $W$\nare derived in terms of an underlying $U(N)$ interacting matrix model replacing\nthe free Gaussian model describing the ${\\cal N}=4$ theory. Using the AGT\ncorrespondence, the $\\tau_J$-deformations are related to the insertions of\ncommuting integrals of motion in the four-point CFT correlator and chiral\ncorrelators are expressed as $\\tau$-derivatives of the gauge theory partition\nfunction on a finite $\\Omega$-background. In the so called Nekrasov-Shatashvili\nlimit, the entire ring of chiral relations is extracted from the\n$\\epsilon$-deformed Seiberg-Witten curve. As a byproduct of our analysis we\nshow that $SU(2)$ gauge theories on rational $\\Omega$-backgrounds are dual to\nCFT minimal models.\n", "  We report the quantum phase diagram of a one-dimensional Coulomb wire\nobtained using the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. The exact knowledge\nof the nodal points of this system permits us to find the energy in an exact\nway, solving the sign problem which spoils fermionic calculations in higher\ndimensions. The results obtained allow for the determination of the stability\ndomain, in terms of density and temperature, of the one-dimensional Wigner\ncrystal. At low temperatures, the quantum wire reaches the quantum-degenerate\nregime, which is also described by the diffusion Monte Carlo method. Increasing\nthe temperature the system transforms to a classical Boltzmann gas which we\nsimulate using classical Monte Carlo. At large enough density, we identify a\none-dimensional ideal Fermi gas which remains quantum up to higher temperatures\nthan in two- and three-dimensional electron gases. The obtained phase diagram\nas well as the energetic and structural properties of this system are relevant\nto experiments with electrons in quantum wires and to Coulomb ions in\none-dimensional confinement.\n", "  We measure the cross-correlation between the galaxy density in the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) Science Verification data and the lensing of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) as reconstructed with the Planck satellite and the\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT). When using the DES main galaxy sample over the full\nredshift range $0.2 < z < 1.2$, a cross-correlation signal is detected at $6\n\\sigma$ and $4\\sigma$ with SPT and Planck respectively. We then divide the DES\ngalaxies into five photometric redshift bins, finding significant ($>$$2\n\\sigma$) detections in all bins. Comparing to the fiducial Planck cosmology, we\nfind the redshift evolution of the signal matches expectations, although the\namplitude is consistently lower than predicted across redshift bins. We test\nfor possible systematics that could affect our result and find no evidence for\nsignificant contamination. Finally, we demonstrate how these measurements can\nbe used to constrain the growth of structure across cosmic time. We find the\ndata are fit by a model in which the amplitude of structure in the $z<1.2$\nuniverse is $0.73 \\pm 0.16$ times as large as predicted in the LCDM Planck\ncosmology, a $1.7\\sigma$ deviation.\n", "  Pair production of new vector-like quarks in pp collisions is considered\nmodel independent as it is usually dominated by QCD production. We discuss the\ninterpretation of vector-like quark searches in the case that QCD is not the\nonly relevant production mechanism for the new quarks. In particular we\nconsider the effect of a new massive color octet vector boson with sizeable\ndecay branching ratio into the new quarks. We pay special attention to the\nsensitivity of the Large Hadron Collider experiments, both in run-1 and early\nrun-2, to differences in the kinematical distributions from the different\nproduction mechanisms. We have found that even though there can be significant\ndifferences in some kinematical distributions at the parton level, the\ndifferences are washed out at the reconstruction level. Thus, the published\nexperimental results can be reinterpreted in models with heavy gluons by simply\nrescaling the production cross section.\n", "  The Poisson geometry of a discrete string in three dimensional Euclidean\nspace is investigated. For this the Frenet frames are converted into a\nspinorial representation, the discrete spinor Frenet equa- tion is interpreted\nin terms of a transfer matrix formalism, and Poisson brackets are introduced in\nterms of the spinor components. The construction is then generalised, in a\nself-similar manner, into an infinite hierarchy of Poisson algebras. As an\nexample, the classical Virasoro (Witt) algebra that determines\nreparametrisation diffeomorphism along a continuous string, is identified as a\nparticular sub-algebra, in the hierarchy of the discrete string Poisson\nalgebra.\n", "  The NEXT experiment aims to observe the neutrinoless double beta decay of\nxenon in a high-pressure Xe136 gas TPC using electroluminescence (EL) to\namplify the signal from ionization. One of the main advantages of this\ntechnology is the possibility to reconstruct the topology of events with\nenergies close to Qbb. This paper presents the first demonstration that the\ntopology provides extra handles to reject background events using data obtained\nwith the NEXT-DEMO prototype.\n  Single electrons resulting from the interactions of Na22 1275 keV gammas and\nelectron-positron pairs produced by conversions of gammas from the Th228 decay\nchain were used to represent the background and the signal in a double beta\ndecay. These data were used to develop algorithms for the reconstruction of\ntracks and the identification of the energy deposited at the end-points,\nproviding an extra background rejection factor of 24.3 +- 1.4 (stat.)%, while\nmaintaining an efficiency of 66.7 +- 1% for signal events.\n", "  We derive the general Ward identities for scale and special conformal\ntransformations in theories of single field inflation. Our analysis is model\nindependent and based on symmetry considerations alone. The identities we\nobtain are valid to all orders in the slow roll expansion. For special\nconformal transformations, the Ward identities include a term which is\nnon-linear in the fields that arises due to a compensating spatial\nreparametrization. Some observational consequences are also discussed.\n", "  We report the spin-pump-induced spin transport properties of a pentacene film\nprepared by thermal evaporation. In a palladium(Pd)/pentacene/Ni80Fe20\ntri-layer sample, a pure spin-current is generated in the pentacene layer by\nthe spin-pumping of Ni80Fe20, which is independent of the conductance mismatch\nproblem in spin injection. The spin current is absorbed into the Pd layer,\nconverted into a charge current with the inverse spin-Hall effect in Pd, and\ndetected as an electromotive force. This is clear evidence for the pure spin\ncurrent at room temperature in pentacene films prepared by thermal evaporation.\n", "  Heavy fermion metals provide a prototype setting to study quantum\ncriticality. Experimentally, quantum critical points have been identified and\nstudied in a growing list of heavy fermion compounds. Theoretically, Kondo\ndestruction has provided a means to characterize a class of unconventional\nquantum critical points that goes beyond the Landau framework of\norder-parameter fluctuations. Among the prominent evidence for such local\nquantum criticality have been measurements in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. A rapid crossover\nis observed at finite temperatures in the isothermal field dependence of the\nHall coefficient and other transport and thermodynamic quantities, which\nspecifies a $T^*(B)$ line in the temperature ($T$)-magnetic field ($B$) phase\ndiagram. Here, we discuss what happens when temperature is raised, by analyzing\nthe ratio of the crossover width to the crossover position. With this ratio\napproaching unity at $T \\gtrsim 0.5$ K, YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at zero magnetic field\nbelongs to the quantum-critical fluctuation regime, where the single-particle\nspectral function has significant spectral weight at both the small and large\nFermi surfaces. This implies that, in this temperature range, any measurements\nsensitive to the Fermi surface will also see a significant spectral weight at\nthe large Fermi surface. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nexperiments recently reported for YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at $T>1$ K are consistent with\nthis expectation, and therefore support the association of the $T^*(B)$ line\nwith the physics of Kondo destruction.\n", "  We study an axially symmetric solution of a vortex in the Abelian-Higgs model\nat critical coupling in detail. Here we propose a new idea for a perturbative\nexpansion of a solution, where the winding number of a vortex is naturally\nextended to be a real number and the solution is expanded with respect to it\naround its origin. We test this idea on three typical constants contained in\nthe solution and confirm that this expansion works well with the help of the\nPad\\'e approximation. For instance, we analytically reproduce the value of the\nscalar charge of the vortex with an error of $O(10^{-6})$. This expansion is\nalso powerful even for large winding numbers.\n", "  Phenomenological explorations of heterotic strings have conventionally\nfocused primarily on the E8xE8 theory. We consider smooth compactifications of\nall three ten-dimensional heterotic theories to exhibit the many similarities\nbetween the non-supersymmetric SO(16)xSO(16) theory and the related\nsupersymmetric E8xE8 and SO(32) theories. In particular, we exploit these\nsimilarities to determine the bosonic and fermionic spectra of Calabi-Yau\ncompactifications with line bundles of the non-supersymmetric string. We use\nelements of four-dimensional supersymmetric effective field theory to\ncharacterize the non-supersymmetric action at leading order and determine the\nGreen-Schwarz induced axion-couplings. Using these methods we construct a\nnon-supersymmetric Standard Model(SM)-like theory. In addition, we show that it\nis possible to obtain SM-like models from the standard embedding using at least\nan order four Wilson line. Finally, we make a proposal of the states that live\non five branes in the SO(16)xSO(16) theory and find under certain assumptions\nthe surprising result that anomaly factorization only admits at most a single\nbrane solution.\n", "  We examine axino dark matter in the regime of a low reheating temperature T_R\nafter inflation and taking into account that reheating is a non-instantaneous\nprocess. This can have a significant effect on the dark matter abundance,\nmainly due to entropy production in inflaton decays. We study both thermal and\nnon-thermal production of axinos in the context of the MSSM with ten free\nparameters. We identify the ranges of the axino mass and the reheating\ntemperature allowed by the LHC and other particle physics data in different\nmodels of axino interactions. We confront these limits with cosmological\nconstraints coming the observed dark matter density, large structures formation\nand big bang nucleosynthesis. We find a number of differences in the\nphenomenologically acceptable values of the axino mass and the reheating\ntemperature relative to previous studies. In particular, an upper bound on the\naxino mass becomes dependent on T_R, reaching a maximum value at T_R~10^2 GeV.\nIf the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle is a wino or a higgsino, we\nobtain lower a limit of approximately 10 GeV for the reheating temperature. We\ndemonstrate also that entropy production during reheating affects the maximum\nallowed axino mass and lowest values of the reheating temperature.\n", "  It has long been suspected that the Global Navigation Satellite Systems exist\nin a background of complex resonances and chaotic motion; yet, the precise\ndynamical character of these phenomena remains elusive. Recent studies have\nshown that the occurrence and nature of the resonances driving these dynamics\ndepend chiefly on the frequencies of nodal and apsidal precession and the rate\nof regression of the Moon's nodes. Woven throughout the inclination and\neccentricity phase space is an exceedingly complicated web-like structure of\nlunisolar secular resonances, which become particularly dense near the\ninclinations of the navigation satellite orbits. A clear picture of the\nphysical significance of these resonances is of considerable practical interest\nfor the design of disposal strategies for the four constellations. Here we\npresent analytical and semi-analytical models that accurately reflect the true\nnature of the resonant interactions, and trace the topological organization of\nthe manifolds on which the chaotic motions take place. We present an atlas of\nFLI stability maps, showing the extent of the chaotic regions of the phase\nspace, computed through a hierarchy of more realistic, and more complicated,\nmodels, and compare the chaotic zones in these charts with the analytical\nestimation of the width of the chaotic layers from the heuristic Chirikov\nresonance-overlap criterion. As the semi-major axis of the satellite is\nreceding, we observe a transition from stable Nekhoroshev-like structures at\nthree Earth radii, where regular orbits dominate, to a Chirikov regime where\nresonances overlap at five Earth radii. From a numerical estimation of the\nLyapunov times, we find that many of the inclined, nearly circular orbits of\nthe navigation satellites are strongly chaotic and that their dynamics are\nunpredictable on decadal timescales.\n", "  Using exact diagonalization for non-interacting systems and density matrix\nrenormalization group for interacting systems we show that Li and Haldane's\nconjecture on the correspondence between the low-lying many-particle excitation\nspectrum and the entanglement spectrum holds for disordered ballistic\none-dimensional many-particle systems. In order to demonstrate the\ncorrespondence we develop a computational efficient way to calculate the ES of\nlow-excitation of non-interacting systems. We observe and explain the presence\nof an unexpected shell structure in the excitation structure. The low-lying\nshell are robust and survive even for strong electron-electron interactions.\n", "  We study transport properties of the helical edge channels of a quantum spin\nHall (QSH) insulator, in the presence of electron-electron interactions and\nweak, local Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The combination of the two allows for\ninelastic backscattering that does not break time-reversal symmetry (TRS),\nresulting in interaction-dependent power law corrections to the conductance.\nHere, we use a non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism to describe the situation of a\nlong, one-dimensional edge channel coupled to external reservoirs, where the\napplied bias is the leading energy scale. By calculating explicitly the\ncorrections to the conductance up to fourth order of the impurity strength, we\nanalyse correlated single- and two-particle backscattering processes on a\nmicroscopic level. Interestingly, we show that the modeling of the leads\ntogether with the breaking of Galilean invariance has important consequences on\nthe transport properties. Such breaking occurs, because the Galilean invariance\nof the bulk spectrum transforms into an emergent Lorentz invariance of the edge\nspectrum. With this broken Galilean invariance at the QSH edge, we find a\ncontribution to single particle backscattering with a very low power scaling,\nwhile in the presence of Galilean invariance the leading contribution would be\ndue to correlated two-particle backscattering only. This difference is further\nreflected in different values of the Fano factor of the shot noise, an\nexperimentally observable quantity. The described behaviour is specific to the\nRashba scatterer, and does not occur in the case of backscattering off a\ntime-reversal breaking, magnetic impurity.\n", "  We discuss the change of the Kondo effect in the Josephson junction formed by\nthe indirect coupling between a one-dimensional \\emph{DIII}-class topological\nand s-wave superconductors via a quantum dot. By performing the\nSchrieffer-Wolff transformation, we find that the single-electron occupation in\nthe quantum dot induces various correlation modes, such as the Kondo and\nsinglet-triplet correlations between the quantum dot and the $s$-wave\nsuperconductor and the spin exchange correlation between the dot and Majorana\ndoublet. Moreover, it plays a nontrivial role in modifying the Josephson\neffect, leading to the occurrence of anisotropic and high-order Kondo\ncorrelation. In addition, due to the quantum dot in the Kondo regime, extra\nspin exchange correlations contribute to the Josephson effect as well.\nNevertheless, if the \\emph{DIII}-class topological superconductor degenerates\ninto \\emph{D}-class because of the destruction of time-reversal invariance, all\nsuch terms will disappear completely. We believe that this work shows the\nfundamental difference between the \\emph{D}- and \\emph{DIII}-class topological\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We employ a high-order perturbative expansion to characterize the ground\nstate of the Mott phase of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We compute\nfor different integer filling factors the energy per lattice site, the\ntwo-point and density-density correlations, and expectation values of powers of\nthe on-site number operator determining the local atom number fluctuations\n(variance, skewness, kurtosis). We compare these expansions to numerical\nsimulations of the infinite-size system to determine their range of\napplicability. We also discuss a new sum rule for the density-density\ncorrelations that can be used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.\n", "  Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and ordinary difference systems\n(O$\\Delta$Ss) invariant under the actions of the Lie groups $\\mathrm{SL}_x(2)$,\n$\\mathrm{SL}_y(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SL}_x(2)\\times\\mathrm{SL}_y(2)$ of projective\ntransformations of the independent variables $x$ and dependent variables $y$\nare constructed. The ODEs are continuous limits of the O$\\Delta$Ss, or\nconversely, the O$\\Delta$Ss are invariant discretizations of the ODEs. The\ninvariant O$\\Delta$Ss are used to calculate numerical solutions of the\ninvariant ODEs of order up to five. The solutions of the invariant numerical\nschemes are compared to numerical solutions obtained by standard Runge-Kutta\nmethods and to exact solutions, when available. The invariant method performs\nat least as well as standard ones and much better in the vicinity of\nsingularities of solutions.\n", "  Novel thermal effects across the first order antiferromagnetic (AFM) -\nferromagnetic (FM) transition in an intermetallic alloy are reported. They show\ninstances of warming when heat is extracted from the sample, and cooling when\nheat is provided to the sample across AFM-FM transition in Ta doped $HfFe_2$,\nthus providing indisputable evidence of metastable supercooled AFM and\nsuperheated FM states, respectively. Such thermal effects in a magnetic solid\nprepared from commercially available materials has been reported for the first\ntime. The transition proceeds in multiple steps which is interpreted in the\nframework of quenched disorder broadening of AFM-FM transition and classical\nnucleation theory. Measurements in the presence of magnetic field conform to\nabove frame work.\n", "  Beam alignment is an important practical aspect of the application of\nsqueezed states of light. Misalignments in the detection of squeezed light\nresult in a reduction of the observable squeezing level. In the case of\nsqueezed vacuum fields that contain only very few photons, special measures\nmust be taken in order to sense and control the alignment of the essentially\ndark beam. The GEO600 gravitational wave detector employs a squeezed vacuum\nsource to improve its detection sensitivity beyond the limits set by classical\nquantum shot noise. Here, we present our design and implementation of an\nalignment sensing and control scheme that ensures continuous optimal alignment\nof the squeezed vacuum field at GEO 600 on long time scales in the presence of\nfree-swinging optics. This first demonstration of a squeezed light automatic\nalignment system will be of particular interest for future long-term\napplications of squeezed vacuum states of light.\n", "  We review and interpret a modern approach to laser theory, steady-state ab\ninitio laser theory (SALT), which treats lasing and amplification in a unified\nmanner as a non-unitary scattering problem described by a non-linear scattering\nmatrix. Within the semiclassical version of the theory the laser line has zero\nwidth as the lasing mode corresponds to the existence of an eigenvector of the\nS-matrix with diverging eigenvalue due to the occurrence of a pole of the\nscattering matrix on the real axis. In this approach the system is infinite\nfrom the outset and no distinction is made between cavity modes and modes of\nthe universe; lasing modes exist both in the cavity and in the external region\nas solutions satisfying Sommerfeld radiation boundary conditions. We discuss\nhow such solutions can be obtained by a limiting procedure in a finite box with\ndamping according to the limiting absorption principle. When the\nelectromagnetic and matter fields are treated as operators, quantum\nfluctuations enter the relevant correlation functions and a finite linewidth is\nobtained, via a generalization of SALT to include noise (N-SALT). N-SALT leads\nto an analytic formula for the linewidth that is more general than all previous\ncorrected versions of the Schawlow-Townes formula, and can be evaluated simply\nfrom knowledge of the semiclassical SALT modes. We derive a simpler version of\nthis formula which emphasizes that the noise is dominated by the fluctuations\nin the polarization of the gain medium and is controlled by the rate of\nspontaneous emission.\n", "  We determine the conditions for the existence of non-transverse factorizing\nmagnetic fields in general spin arrays with anisotropic XYZ couplings of\narbitrary range. It is first shown that a uniform maximally aligned completely\nseparable eigenstate can exist just for fields ${h}_s$ parallel to a principal\nplane and forming four straight lines in field space, with the alignment\ndirection different from that of ${h}_s$ and determined by the anisotropy. Such\nstate always becomes a non-degenerate ground state (GS) for sufficiently strong\n(yet finite) fields along these lines, in both ferromagnetic (FM) and\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) type systems. In AFM chains, this field coexists with\nthe non-transverse factorizing field ${h}'_s$ associated with a degenerate\nN\\'eel-type separable GS, which is shown to arise at a level crossing in a\nfinite chain. It is also demonstrated for arbitrary spin that pairwise\nentanglement reaches full range in the vicinity of both ${h}_s$ and ${h}'_s$,\nvanishing at ${h}_s$ but approaching small yet finite side-limits at ${h}'_s$,\nwhich are analytically determined. The behavior of the block entropy and\nentanglement spectrum in their vicinity is also analyzed.\n", "  We have constructed a Doppler-shifter-type pulsed ultra-cold neutron (UCN)\nsource at the Materials and Life Science Experiment Facility (MLF) of the Japan\nProton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). Very-cold neutrons (VCNs) with\n136-$\\mathrm{m/s}$ velocity in a neutron beam supplied by a pulsed neutron\nsource are decelerated by reflection on a m=10 wide-band multilayer mirror,\nyielding pulsed UCN. The mirror is fixed to the tip of a 2,000-rpm rotating arm\nmoving with 68-$\\mathrm{m/s}$ velocity in the same direction as the VCN. The\nrepetition frequency of the pulsed UCN is $8.33~\\mathrm{Hz}$ and the time width\nof the pulse at production is $4.4~\\mathrm{ms}$. In order to increase the UCN\nflux, a supermirror guide, wide-band monochromatic mirrors, focus guides, and a\nUCN extraction guide have been newly installed or improved. The\n$1~\\mathrm{MW}$-equivalent count rate of the output neutrons with longitudinal\nwavelengths longer than $58~\\mathrm{nm}$ is $1.6 \\times 10^{2}~\\mathrm{cps}$,\nwhile that of the true UCNs is $80~\\mathrm{cps}$. The spatial density at\nproduction is $1.4~\\mathrm{UCN/cm^{3}}$. This new UCN source enables us to\nresearch and develop apparatuses necessary for the investigation of the neutron\nelectric dipole moment (nEDM).\n", "  We introduce a systematic framework for counting and finding independent\noperators in effective field theories, taking into account the redundancies\nassociated with use of the classical equations of motion and integration by\nparts. By working in momentum space, we show that the enumeration problem can\nbe mapped onto that of understanding a polynomial ring in the field momenta.\nAll-order information about the number of independent operators in an effective\nfield theory is encoded in a geometrical object of the ring known as the\nHilbert series. We obtain the Hilbert series for the theory of N real scalar\nfields in (0+1) dimensions--an example, free of space-time and internal\nsymmetries, where aspects of our framework are most transparent. Although this\nis as simple a theory involving derivatives as one could imagine, it provides\nfruitful lessons to be carried into studies of more complicated theories: we\nfind surprising and rich structure from an interplay between integration by\nparts and equations of motion and a connection with SL(2,C) representation\ntheory which controls the structure of the operator basis.\n", "  Walls in discrete element method simulations of granular flows are sometimes\nmodeled as a closely packed monolayer of fixed particles, resulting in a rough\nwall rather than a geometrically smooth wall. An implicit assumption is that\nthe resulting rough wall differs from a smooth wall only locally at the\nparticle scale. Here we test this assumption by considering the impact of the\nwall roughness at the periphery of the flowing layer on the flow of\nmonodisperse particles in a rotating spherical tumbler. We find that varying\nthe wall roughness significantly alters average particle trajectories even far\nfrom the wall. Rough walls induce greater poleward axial drift of particles\nnear the flowing layer surface, but decrease the curvature of the trajectories.\nIncreasing the volume fill level in the tumbler has little effect on the axial\ndrift for rough walls, but increases the drift while reducing curvature of the\nparticle trajectories for smooth walls. The mechanism for these effects is\nrelated to the degree of local slip at the bounding wall, which alters the\nflowing layer thickness near the walls, affecting the particle trajectories\neven far from the walls near the equator of the tumbler. Thus, the proper\nchoice of wall conditions is important in the accurate simulation of granular\nflows, even far from the bounding wall.\n", "  In this letter, we present a detailed, all optical study of the influence of\ndifferent excitation schemes on the indistinguishability of single photons from\na single InAs quantum dot. For this study, we measure the Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference of consecutive photons from the spontaneous emission of an InAs\nquantum dot state under various excitation schemes and different excitation\nconditions and give a comparison.\n", "  We study the electronic structure of an ordered array of poly(para-phenylene)\nchains produced by surface-catalyzed dehalogenative polymerization of\n1,4-dibromobenzene on copper (110). The quantization of unoccupied molecular\nstates is measured as a function of oligomer length by scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, with Fermi level crossings observed for chains longer than ten\nphenyl rings. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a graphene-like\nquasi one-dimensional valence band as well as a direct gap of 1.15 eV, as the\nconduction band is partially filled through adsorption on the surface.\nTight-binding modelling and ab initio density functional theory calculations\nlead to a full description of the organic band-structure, including the k\ndispersion, the gap size and electron charge transfer mechanisms which drive\nthe system into metallic behaviour. Therefore the entire band structure of a\ncarbon-based conducting wire has been fully determined. This may be taken as a\nfingerprint of {\\pi}-conjugation of surface organic frameworks.\n", "  The Offline Software of the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nat CERN consists of 6M lines of in-house code, developed over a decade by\nnearly 1000 physicists, as well as a comparable amount of general use\nopen-source code. A critical ingredient to the success of the construction and\nearly operation of the WLCG was the convergence, around the year 2000, on the\nuse of a homogeneous environment of commodity x86-64 processors and Linux.\nApache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation\nand sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop,\nJenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other applications on a dynamically shared pool of\nnodes. We present how we migrated our continuos integration system to schedule\njobs on a relatively small Apache Mesos enabled cluster and how this resulted\nin better resource usage, higher peak performance and lower latency thanks to\nthe dynamic scheduling capabilities of Mesos.\n", "  This paper describes a programme to study the computing model in CMS after\nthe next long shutdown near the end of the decade.\n", "  We study theories which naturally select a vacuum with parametrically small\nElectroweak Scale due to finite temperature effects in the early universe. In\nparticular, there is a scalar with an approximate shift symmetry broken by a\ntechnically natural small coupling to the Higgs, and a temperature dependent\npotential. As the temperature of the universe drops, the scalar follows the\nminimum of its potential altering the Higgs mass squared parameter. The scalar\nalso has a periodic potential with amplitude proportional to the Higgs\nexpectation value, which traps it in a vacuum with a small Electroweak Scale.\nThe required temperature dependence of the potential can occur through strong\ncoupling effects in a hidden sector that are suppressed at high temperatures.\nAlternatively, it can be generated perturbatively from a one-loop thermal\npotential. In both cases, for the scalar to be displaced, a hidden sector must\nbe reheated to temperatures significantly higher than the visible sector.\nHowever this does not violate observational constraints provided the hidden\nsector energy density is transferred to the visible sector without disrupting\nbig bang nucleosynthesis. We also study how the mechanism can be implemented\nwhen the visible sector is completed to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel at a high scale. Models with a UV cutoff of 10 TeV and no fields taking\nvalues over a range greater than 10^12 GeV are possible, although the scalar\nmust have a range of order 10^8 times the effective decay constant in the\nperiodic part of its potential.\n", "  We perform model searches on smooth Calabi-Yau compactifications for both the\nsupersymmetric E8xE8 and SO(32) as well as for the non-supersymmetric\nSO(16)xSO(16) heterotic strings simultaneously. We consider line bundle\nbackgrounds on both favorable CICYs with relatively small h_11 and the Schoen\nmanifold. Using Gram matrices we systematically analyze the combined\nconsequences of the Bianchi identities and the tree-level\nDonaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau equations inside the Kahler cone. In order to evaluate\nthe model building potential of the three heterotic theories on the various\ngeometries, we perform computer-aided scans. We have generated a large number\nof GUT-like models (up to over a few hundred thousand on the various geometries\nfor the three heterotic theories) which become (MS)SM-like upon using a freely\nacting Wilson line. For all three heterotic theories we present tables and\nfigures summarizing the potentially phenomenologically interesting models which\nwere obtained during our model scans.\n", "  In the present work, we investigate how single- and multi-vortex-ring states\ncan emerge from a planar dark soliton in three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (confined in isotropic or anisotropic traps) through bifurcations.\nWe characterize such bifurcations quantitatively using a Galerkin-type\napproach, and find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with our\nBogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) analysis. We also systematically characterize the\nBdG spectrum of the dark solitons, using perturbation theory, and obtain a\nquantitative match with our 3D BdG numerical calculations. We then turn our\nattention to the emergence of single- and multi-vortex-ring states. We\nsystematically capture these as stationary states of the system and quantify\ntheir BdG spectra numerically. We find that although the vortex ring may be\nunstable when bifurcating, its instabilities weaken and may even eventually\ndisappear, for sufficiently large chemical potentials and suitable trap\nsettings. For instance, we demonstrate the stability of the vortex ring for an\nisotropic trap in the large chemical potential regime.\n", "  For a massless gas with constant cross section in a homogeneous,\nisotropically expanding spacetime we reformulate the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation as a set of non-linear coupled moment equations. For a particular\ninitial condition this set can be solved exactly, yielding the first analytical\nsolution of the Boltzmann equation for an expanding system. The non-equilibrium\nbehavior of this relativistic gas can be mapped onto that of a homogeneous,\nstatic non-relativistic gas of Maxwell molecules.\n", "  Positronium spectroscopy (n=1 hyperfine splitting, n=2 fine structure, and\nthe 1S-2S interval) has reached a precision of order 1 MHz. Vigorous ongoing\nefforts to improve the experimental results motivate the calculation of the\npositronium energy levels at order $m \\alpha^7$. In this work we present the\nresult for a complete class of such contributions--those involving virtual\nannihilation of positronium to three photons in an intermediate state. We find\nan energy shift of $2.6216(11) m \\alpha^7/(n \\pi)^3$ for the spin-triplet S\nstate with principal quantum number n.\n", "  We study the topological properties of the quantum phase space current in the\nHusimi representation, focusing on the dynamical differences, induced by these\nproperties, between the quantum and the classical flows. We show that the zeros\nof the Husimi function are stagnation points of the current and have a nonzero\ntopological charge. Due to overall charge conservation, new stagnation points\nwith opposite charge appear in pairs in the Husimi current and they have\nimportant roles in dynamical processes. As an example we show the topological\neffect of the zeros in the transmission rate of particle through a potential\nbarrier.\n", "  We investigate the structure and features of an ultralong-range triatomic\nRydberg molecule formed by a Rb Rydberg atom and a KRb diatomic molecule. In\nour numerical description, we perform a realistic treatment of the internal\nrotational motion of the diatomic molecule, and take into account the Rb($n,\nl\\ge 3$) Rydberg degenerate manifold and the energetically closest neighboring\nlevels with principal quantum numbers $n'>n$ and orbital quantum number\n$l\\le2$. We focus here on the adiabatic electronic potentials evolving from the\nRb($n, l\\ge 3$) and Rb($n=26, l=2$) manifolds. The directional properties of\nthe KRb diatomic molecule within the Rb-KRb triatomic Rydberg molecule are also\nanalyzed in detail.\n", "  Relativistic electron beam propagation in plasma is fraught with several\nmicro instabilities like two stream, filamentation etc., in plasma. This\nresults in severe limitation of the electron transport through a plasma medium.\nRecently, however, there has been an experimental demonstration of improved\ntransport of Mega Ampere of electron currents (generated by the interaction of\nintense laser with solid target) in a carbon nanotube structured solid target\n[Phys. Rev Letts. 108, 235005 (2012)]. This then suggests that the\ninhomogeneous plasma (created by the ionization of carbon nano tube structured\ntarget) helps in containing the growth of the beam plasma instabilities. This\nmanuscript addresses this issue with the help of a detailed analytical study\nand simulations with the help of 2-D Particle - In - Cell code. The study\nconclusively demonstrates that the growth rate of the dominant instability in\nthe 2-D geometry decreases when the plasma density is chosen to be\ninhomogeneous, provided the scale length 1/ks of the inhomogeneous plasma is\nless than the typical plasma skin depth (c/{\\omega}p0 ) scale. At such small\nscale lengths channelization of currents are also observed in simulation.\n", "  The lepton-sepcific (or type X) 2HDM (L2HDM) is an attractive new physics\ncandidate explaining the muon $g-2$ anomaly requiring a light CP-odd boson $A$\nand large $\\tan\\beta$. This scenario leads to $\\tau$-rich signatures, such as\n$3\\tau$, $4\\tau$ and $4\\tau+W/Z$, which can be readily accessible at the LHC.\nWe first study the whole L2HDM parameter space to identify allowed regions of\nextra Higgs boson masses as well as two couplings $\\lambda_{hAA}$ and $\\xi_h^l$\nwhich determine the 125 GeV Higgs boson decays $h\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $h\\to\nAA/AA^*(\\tau^+\\tau^-)$, respectively. This motivates us to set up two regions\nof interest: (A) $m_A \\ll m_{H} \\sim m_{H^\\pm}$, and (B) $m_A \\sim m_{H^\\pm}\n\\sim {\\cal O}(100) \\mbox{GeV} \\ll m_H$, for which derive the current\nconstraints by adopting the chargino-neutralino search at the LHC8, and then\nanalyze the LHC14 prospects by implementing $\\tau$-tagging algorithm. A\ncorrelated study of the upcoming precision determination of the 125 GeV Higgs\nboson decay properties as well as the observation of multi-tau events at the\nnext runs of LHC will be able to shed light on the L2HDM option for the muon\n$g-2$.\n", "  We present a solution of the full TDDFT eigenvalue equation in the linear\nresponse formalism exhibiting a linear-scaling computational complexity with\nsystem size, without relying on the simplifying Tamm-Dancoff approximation\n(TDA). The implementation relies on representing the occupied and unoccupied\nsubspace with two different sets of in situ optimised localised functions,\nyielding a very compact and efficient representation of the transition density\nmatrix of the excitation with the accuracy associated with a systematic basis\nset. The TDDFT eigenvalue equation is solved using a preconditioned\nconjugate-gradients algorithm that is very memory-efficient. The algorithm is\nvalidated on a test molecule and a good agreement with results obtained from\nstandard quantum chemistry packages is found, with the preconditioner yielding\na significant improvement in convergence rates. The method developed in this\nwork is then used to reproduce experimental results of the absorption spectrum\nof bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) in an organic solvent, where it is demonstrated\nthat the TDA fails to reproduce the main features of the low energy spectrum,\nwhile the full TDDFT equation yields results in good qualitative agreement with\nexperimental data. Furthermore, the need for explicitly including parts of the\nsolvent into the TDDFT calculations is highlighted, making the treatment of\nlarge system sizes necessary that are well within reach of the capabilities of\nthe algorithm introduced here. Finally, the linear-scaling properties of the\nalgorithm are demonstrated by computing the lowest excitation energy of BChl in\nsolution. The largest systems considered in this work are of the same order of\nmagnitude as a variety of pigment-protein complexes, opening up the possibility\nof studying their properties without having to resort to any semiclassical\napproximations to parts of the protein environment.\n", "  Multiple controllable spiking patterns are obtained in a 1310 nm Vertical\nCavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) in response to induced perturbations and\nfor two different cases of polarized optical injection, namely parallel and\northogonal. Achievement of reproducible spiking responses in VCSELs operating\nat the telecom wavelengths offers great promise for future uses of these\ndevices in ultrafast neuromorphic photonic systems for non-traditional\ncomputing applications.\n", "  We study the dynamics of networks with inhibitory and excitatory\nleaky-integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity in the\npresence of depressive and facilitating mechanisms. The dynamics is analyzed by\na Heterogeneous Mean-Field approximation, that allows to keep track of the\neffects of structural disorder in the network. We describe the complex behavior\nof different classes of excitatory and inhibitory components, that give rise to\na rich dynamical phase-diagram as a function of the fraction of inhibitory\nneurons. By the same mean field approach, we study and solve a global inverse\nproblem: reconstructing the degree probability distributions of the inhibitory\nand excitatory components and the fraction of inhibitory neurons from the\nknowledge of the average synaptic activity field. This approach unveils new\nperspectives in the numerical study of neural network dynamics and in the\npossibility of using these models as testbed for the analysis of experimental\ndata.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to understand the tendency to organization of the\nturbulence in two-dimensional ideal fluids. We show that nonlinear processes as\ninverse cascade of the energy and vorticity concentration are essentially\ndetermined by trajectory trapping or eddying. The statistics of the\ntrajectories of the vorticity elements is studied using a semianalytic method.\nThe separation of the positive and negative vorticity is due to the attraction\nproduced by a large scale vortex on the small scale vortices of the same sign.\nMore precisely, a large scale velocity is shown to determine average transverse\ndrifts, which have opposite orientations for positive and negative vorticity.\nThey appear in the presence of trapping and lead to energy flow to large scales\ndue to the increase of the circulation of the large vortex. Recent results on\ndrift turbulence evolution in magnetically confined plasmas are discussed in\norder to underline the idea that there is a link between the inverse cascade\nand trajectory trapping. The physical mechanisms are different in fluids and\nplasmas due to the different types of nonlinearities of the two systems, but\ntrajectory trapping has the main role in both cases.\n", "  We consider the problem of building an arbitrary $N\\times N$ real orthogonal\noperator using a finite set, $S$, of elementary quantum optics gates operating\non $m\\leq N$ modes - the problem of universality of $S$ on $N$ modes. In\nparticular, we focus on the universality problem of an $m$-mode beamsplitter.\nUsing methods of control theory and some properties of rotations in three\ndimensions, we prove that any nontrivial real 2-mode and \"almost\" any\nnontrivial real $3$-mode beamsplitter is universal on $m\\geq3$ modes.\n", "  We present perturbative analytical results of the Landau level quasienergy\nspectrum, autocorrelation function and out of plane pseudospin polarization for\na single graphene sheet subject to intense circularly polarized terahertz\nradiation. For the quasienergy spectrum, we find a striking non trivial\nlevel-dependent dynamically induced gap structure. This photoinduced modulation\nof the energy band structure gives rise to shifts of the revival times in the\nautocorrelation function and it also leads to modulation of the oscillations in\nthe dynamical evolution of the out of plane pseudospin polarization, which\nmeasures the angular momentum transfer between light and graphene electrons.\nFor a coherent state, chosen as an initial pseudospin configuration, the\ndynamics induces additional quantum revivals of the wave function that manifest\nas shifts of the maxima and minima of the autocorrelation function, with\nadditional partial revivals and beating patterns. These additional maxima and\nbeating patterns stem from the effective dynamical coupling of the static\neigenstates. We discuss the possible experimental detection schemes of our\ntheoretical results and their relevance in new practical implementation of\nradiation fields in graphene physics.\n", "  We describe a Josephson device composed of two superconductors separated by\ntwo interacting quantum dots in parallel, as a probe for Cooper pair splitting.\nIn addition to sequential tunneling of electrons through each dot, an\nadditional transport channel exists in this system: crossed Andreev reflection,\nwhere a Cooper pair from the source is split between the two dots and\nrecombined in the drain superconductor. Unlike non-equilibrium scenarios for\nCooper pair splitting which involves superconducting/normal metal \"forks\", our\nproposal relies on an Aharonov-Bohm measurement of the DC Josephson current\nwhen a flux is inserted between the two dots. We provide a path integral\napproach to treat arbitrary transparencies, and we explore all contributions\nfor the individual phases ($0$ or $\\pi$) of the quantum dots. We propose a\ndefinition of the Cooper pair splitting efficiency for arbitrary\ntransparencies, which allows us to find the phase associations which favor the\ncrossed Andreev process. Possible applications to experiments using nanowires\nas quantum dots are discussed.\n", "  Defect centers in diamond are exceptional solid-state quantum systems that\ncan have exceedingly long electron and nuclear spin coherence times. So far,\nsingle-qubit gates for the nitrogen nuclear spin, a two-qubit gate with a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin, and entanglement between nearby\nnitrogen nuclear spins have been demonstrated. Here, we develop a scheme to\nimplement a universal two-qubit gate between two distant nitrogen nuclear\nspins. Virtual excitation of an NV center that is embedded in an optical cavity\ncan scatter a laser photon into the cavity mode; we show that this process\ndepends on the nuclear spin state of the nitrogen atom. If two NV centers are\nsimultaneously coupled to a common cavity mode and individually excited,\nvirtual cavity photon exchange can mediate an effective interaction between the\nnuclear spin qubits, conditioned on the spin state of both nuclei, which\nimplements a universal controlled-$\\textit{Z}$ gate. We predict operation times\nbelow 100 nanoseconds, which is several orders of magnitude faster than the\ndecoherence time of nuclear spin qubits in diamond.\n", "  The authors' recent Nature Photonics article titled \"Compact Nano-Mechanical\nPlasmonic Phase Modulators\" [1] is reviewed which reports a new phase\nmodulation principle with experimental demonstration of a 23 {\\mu}m long\nnon-resonant modulator having 1.5 {\\pi} rad range with 1.7 dB excess loss at\n780 nm. Analysis showed that by decreasing all dimensions, a low loss,\nultra-compact {\\pi} rad phase modulator is possible. Application of this type\nof nano-mechanical modulator in a miniature 2 x 2 switch is suggested and an\noptical design numerically validated. The footprint of the switch is 0.5 {\\mu}m\nx 2.5 {\\mu}m.\n", "  We present a bilocal isomorphism between the algebra generated by a single\nreal twisted boson field and the algebra of the boson $\\beta\\gamma$ ghost\nsystem. As a consequence of this twisted vertex algebra isomorphism we show\nthat each of these two algebras possesses both an untwisted and a twisted\nHeisenberg bosonic currents, as well as three separate families of Virasoro\nfields. We show that this bilocal isomorphism generalizes to an isomorphism\nbetween the algebra generated by the twisted boson field with $2n$ points of\nlocalization and the algebra of the $2n$ symplectic bosons.\n", "  Starting from a full renormalised trajectory for the effective average action\n(a.k.a. infrared cutoff Legendre effective action) $\\Gamma_k$, we explicitly\nreconstruct corresponding bare actions, formulated in one of two ways. The\nfirst step is to construct the corresponding Wilsonian effective action $S^k$\nthrough a tree-level expansion in terms of the vertices provided by $\\Gamma_k$.\nIt forms a perfect bare action giving the same renormalised trajectory. A bare\naction with some ultraviolet cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ and infrared cutoff $k$\nnecessarily produces an effective average action $\\Gamma^\\Lambda_k$ that\ndepends on both cutoffs, but if the already computed $S^\\Lambda$ is used, we\nshow how $\\Gamma^\\Lambda_k$ can also be computed from $\\Gamma_k$ by a\ntree-level expansion, and that $\\Gamma^\\Lambda_k\\to\\Gamma_k$ as\n$\\Lambda\\to\\infty$. Along the way we show that Legendre effective actions with\ndifferent UV cutoff profiles, but which correspond to the same Wilsonian\neffective action, are related through tree-level expansions. All these\nexpansions follow from Legendre transform relationships that can be derived\nfrom the original one between $\\Gamma^\\Lambda_k$ and $S^k$.\n", "  We consider a generic framework where the Standard Model (SM) coexists with a\nhidden sector endowed with some additional gauge symmetry. When this symmetry\nis broken by a scalar field charged under the hidden gauge group, the\ncorresponding scalar boson generally mixes with the SM Higgs boson. In\naddition, massive hidden gauge bosons emerge and via the mixing, the observed\nHiggs-like mass eigenstate is the only known particle that couples to these\nhidden gauge bosons directly.\n  We study the LHC monojet signatures of this scenario and the corresponding\nconstraints on the gauge coupling of the hidden gauge group as well as the\nmixing of the Higgs scalars.\n", "  We propose thermally-populated domain walls (DWs) in an easy-plane\nferromagnetic insulator as robust spin carriers between two metals. The\nchirality of a DW, which serves as a topological charge, couples to the metal\nspin accumulation via spin-transfer torque and results in the\nchirality-dependent thermal nucleation rates of DWs at the interface. After\noverpopulated DWs of a particular (net) chirality diffuse and leave the\nferromagnet at the other interface, they reemit the spin current by spin\npumping. The conservation of the topological charge supports an algebraic decay\nof spin transport as the length of the ferromagnet increases; this is analogous\nto the decaying behavior of superfluid spin transport but contrasts with the\nexponential decay of magnon spin transport. We envision that similar spin\ntransport with algebraic decay may be implemented in materials with exotic spin\nphases by exploiting topological characteristics and the associated conserved\nquantities of their excitations.\n", "  Using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, we identify excitation induced\ndephasing as a major mechanism responsible for the breaking of the\nstrong-coupling between excitons and photons in a semiconductor microcavity.\nThe effects of dephasing are observed on the transmitted probe pulse spectrum\nas a density dependent broadening of the exciton-polariton resonances and the\nemergence of a third resonance at high excitation density. A striking asymmetry\nin the energy shift between the upper and the lower polaritons is also\nevidenced. Using the excitonic Bloch equations, we quantify the respective\ncontributions to the energy shift of many-body effects associated with Fermion\nexchange and photon assisted exchange processes and the contribution to\ncollisional broadening.\n", "  Several experimental studies have referred to the grain boundary (GB) defect\nas the origin of the ferromagnetism in ZnO. However, the mechanism of this\nhypothesis has never been confirmed. Present study investigates the atomic\nstructure and the effect of point defects in a ZnO GB using the GGA+U\napproximation. The relaxed GB possesses large periodicity and channels with 8\nand 10 numbered atoms having 4 and 3 fold coordination. Unlike O vacancy (VO),\nZn vacancy (VZn) is preferentially aggregated at the GB, relative to the\nbulk-like region, indicating the possibility of obtaining p-type conductivity\nin polycrystalline ZnO. Although no magnetization is obtained from point\ndefect-free GB, VZn induces spin polarization as large as 0.68 {\\mu}B/atom to\nthe O sites at the GB. Ferromagnetic exchange energy > 150 eV is obtained by\nincreasing the concentration of VZn and by the injection of holes into the\nsystem. Electronic structure analysis indicates that the spin polarization\nwithout external dopants originates from the O 2p orbitals, a common feature of\nd0 semiconductors.\n", "  We study the nature of the frictional jamming transition within the framework\nof rigidity percolation theory. Slowly sheared frictional packings are\ndecomposed into rigid clusters and floppy regions with a generalization of the\npebble game including frictional contacts. We discover a second-order\ntransition controlled by the emergence of a system-spanning rigid cluster\naccompanied by a critical cluster size distribution. Rigid clusters also\ncorrelate with common measures of rigidity. We contrast this result with\nfrictionless jamming, where the rigid cluster size distribution is noncritical.\n", "  We consider solvability of the generalized reaction-diffusion equation with\nboth space- and time-dependent diffusion and reaction terms by means of the\nsimilarity method. By introducing the similarity variable, the\nreaction-diffusion equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation.\nMatching the resulting ordinary differential equation with known exactly\nsolvable equations, one can obtain corresponding exactly solvable\nreaction-diffusion systems. Several representative examples of exactly solvable\nreaction-diffusion equations are presented.\n", "  The self-diffusion of two-dimensional small Ag islands (containing up to $10$\natoms) on Ag(111) surface has been studied using and self-learning kinetic\nMonte Carlo [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 24, 354004 (2012)] simulations. A\nvariety of concerted, multi-atom and single-atom processes were automatically\nrevealed in these simulations. The size dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficients, effective energy barriers as well as key diffusion processes\nresponsible for island diffusion are reported. In addition, we have compared\nactivation barriers for concerted diffusion processes with those obtained from\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.\n", "  Formation of low-resistance metal contacts is the biggest challenge that\nmasks the intrinsic exceptional electronic properties of 2D WSe2 devices. We\npresent the first comparative study of the interfacial properties between ML/BL\nWSe2 and Sc, Al, Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt contacts by using ab initio energy band\ncalculations with inclusion of the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects and\nquantum transport simulations. The interlayer coupling tends to reduce both the\nelectron and hole Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) and alters the polarity for\nWSe2-Au contact, while the SOC chiefly reduces the hole SBH. In the absence of\nthe SOC, Pd contact has the smallest hole SBH with a value no less than 0.22\neV. Dramatically, Pt contact surpasses Pd contact and becomes p-type Ohmic or\nquasi-Ohmic contact with inclusion of the SOC. Our study provides a theoretical\nfoundation for the selection of favorable metal electrodes in ML/BL WSe2\ndevices.\n", "  We calculate the transverse momentum dependence in the production of two\nback-to-back hadrons in electron-positron annihilations at the medium/large\nenergy scales of BES-III and BELLE experiments. We use the parameters of the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) fragmentation functions that were recently\nextracted from the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering multiplicities at\nlow energy from HERMES. TMD evolution is applied according to different\napproaches and using different parameters for the nonperturbative part of the\nevolution kernel, thus exploring the sensitivity of our results to these\ndifferent choices and to the flavor dependence of parton fragmentation\nfunctions. We discuss how experimental measurements could discriminate among\nthe various scenarios.\n", "  Detailed quantitative measurement of surface dynamics during thin film growth\nis a major experimental challenge. Here X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy\nwith coherent hard X-rays is used in a Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray\nScattering (i.e. Co-GISAXS) geometry as a new tool to investigate nanoscale\nsurface dynamics during sputter deposition of a-Si and a-WSi$_2$ thin films.\nFor both films, kinetic roughening during surface growth reaches a dynamic\nsteady state at late times in which the intensity autocorrelation function\n$g_2$(q,t) becomes stationary. The $g_2$(q,t) functions exhibit compressed\nexponential behavior at all wavenumbers studied. The overall dynamics are\ncomplex, but the most surface sensitive sections of the structure factor and\ncorrelation time exhibit power law behaviors consistent with dynamical scaling.\n", "  A Woods-Saxon equivalent to a double folding potential in the surface region\nis obtained for the heavy-ion scattering potential. The Woods-Saxon potential\nhas fixed geometry and was applied as a bare potential in the analysis of\nexperimental data of several systems. A new analytical formula for the position\nand height of the Coulomb barrier is presented, which reproduces the results\nobtained using double folding potentials. This simple formula has been applied\nto estimate the fusion cross section above the Coulomb barrier. A comparison\nwith experimental data is presented.\n", "  We consider in a quantum field theory framework the effects of a classical\nmagnetic field on the spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a free\nelectron. We derive formulae for the changes in the spin and OAM due to the\nintroduction of a general classical background field. We consider then a\nconstant magnetic field, in which case the relevant expressions of the effects\nbecome much simpler and conversions between spin and OAM become readily\napparent. An estimate of the expectation values for a realistic electron state\nis also given. Our findings may be of interest to researchers in spintronics\nand the field of quantum biology, where electron spin has been implicated on\nmacroscopic time and energy scales.\n", "  Point contacts provide simple connections between macroscopic particle\nreservoirs. In electric circuits, strong links between metals, semiconductors\nor superconductors have applications for fundamental condensed-matter physics\nas well as quantum information processing. However for complex, strongly\ncorrelated materials, links have been largely restricted to weak tunnel\njunctions. Here we study resonantly interacting Fermi gases connected by a\ntunable, ballistic quantum point contact, finding a non-linear current-bias\nrelation. At low temperature, our observations agree quantitatively with a\ntheoretical model in which the current originates from multiple Andreev\nreflections. In a wide contact geometry, the competition between superfluidity\nand thermally activated transport leads to a conductance minimum. Our system\noffers a controllable platform for the study of mesoscopic devices based on\nstrongly interacting matter.\n", "  The recent ALMA observations of the disc surrounding HL Tau reveal a very\ncomplex dust spatial distribution. We present a radiative transfer model\naccounting for the observed gaps and bright rings as well as radial changes of\nthe emissivity index. We find that the dust density is depleted by at least a\nfactor 10 in the main gaps compared to the surrounding rings. Ring masses range\nfrom 10-100 M$_{\\oplus}$ in dust, and, we find that each of the deepest gaps is\nconsistent with the removal of up to 40 M$_{\\oplus}$ of dust. If this material\nhas accumulated into rocky bodies, these would be close to the point of runaway\ngas accretion. Our model indicates that the outermost ring is depleted in\nmillimetre grains compared to the central rings. This suggests faster grain\ngrowth in the central regions and/or radial migration of the larger grains. The\nmorphology of the gaps observed by ALMA - well separated and showing a high\ndegree of contrast with the bright rings over all azimuths - indicates that the\nmillimetre dust disc is geometrically thin (scale height $\\approx$ 1 au at 100\nau) and that a large amount of settling of large grains has already occurred.\nAssuming a standard dust settling model, we find that the observations are\nconsistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of a few $10^{-4}$. We\nestimate the gas/dust ratio in this thin layer to be of the order of 5 if the\ninitial ratio is 100. The HCO$^+$ and CO emission is consistent with gas in\nKeplerian motion around a 1.7 $M_\\odot$ star at radii from $\\leq 10 - 120\\,$au.\n", "  We study the Fermi energy level dependence of nonlinear terahertz (THz)\ntransmission of gated multi-layer and single-layer graphene transferred onto\nsapphire and quartz substrates. The two samples represent two limits of\nlow-field impurity scattering: short-range neutral and long-range charged\nimpurity scattering, respectively. We observe an increase in the transmission\nas the field amplitude is increased due to intraband absorption bleaching\nstarting at fields above 8 kV/cm. This effect arises from a field-induced\nreduction in THz conductivity that depends strongly on the Fermi energy. We\naccount for intraband absorption using a free carrier Drude model that includes\nneutral and charged impurity scattering as well as optical phonon scattering.\nWe find that although the Fermi-level dependence in the monolayer and\nfive-layer samples is quite different, both exhibit a strong dependence on the\nfield amplitude that cannot be explained on the basis of an increase in the\nlattice temperature alone. Our results provide a deeper understanding of\ntransport in graphene devices operating at THz frequencies and in modest kV/cm\nfield strengths where nonlinearities exist.\n", "  The strong light-matter interaction in graphene over a broad frequency range\nhas opened up a plethora of photonics applications of graphene. The goal of\nthis paper is to present the voltage tunability of plasmons in gated single-\nand multi-layer graphene structures. Device concepts for plasmonic\ninterconnects and antennas and their performance for THz communication are\npresented. For the first time, the role of gate voltage and the thickness of\nthe gate dielectric on the characteristics of plasmon propagation in graphene\nare quantified by accounting for both the interface trap capacitance and the\nquantum capacitance. The gate voltage serves as a powerful knob to tweak the\ncarrier concentration and allows building electrically reconfigurable terahertz\ndevices. By optimizing the gate voltage to maximize the plasmon propagation\nlength in a gated multi-layer graphene geometry, we derive simple scaling\ntrends that give intuitive insight into device modeling and design.\n", "  We identify here possible occurrence of large deformations in the neutron-\nand proton-rich regions of the nuclear chart from extensive predictions of the\nvalues of the reduced quadrupole transition probability B-E2 for the transition\nfrom the ground state to the first 2+ state and the corresponding excitation\nenergy E2 of even-even nuclei in the recently developed Generalized\nDifferential Equation model exclusively meant for these physical quantities.\nThis is made possible from our analysis of the predicted values of these two\nphysical quantities and the corresponding deformation parameters derived from\nthem such as the quadrupole deformation beta-2, the ratio of beta-2 to the\nWeisskopf single-particle beta-2 and the intrinsic electric quadruplole moment\n, calculated for a large number of both known as well as hitherto unknown\neven-even isotopes of Oxygen to Fermium (Z=8 to 100). Our critical analysis of\nthe resulting data convincingly support possible existence of large\ncollectivity for the nuclides 30,32 Ne, 34 Mg, 60 Ti, 42,62,64 Cr, 50,68 Fe,\n52,72 Ni, 72,70,96 Kr, 74,76 Sr,78,80,106,108 Zr , 82,84,110,112 Mo, 140 Te,144\nXe, 148 Ba, 122 Ce, 128,156 Nd, 130,132,158,160 Sm and 138,162,164,166 Gd,\nwhose values of beta-2 are found to exceed 0.3 and even 0.4 in some cases. Our\nfindings of large deformations in the exotic neutron-rich regions support the\nexistence of another Island of Inversion in the heavy-mass region possibly\ncaused by breaking of the N=70 sub-shell closure.\n", "  X-ray fluorescence remote sensing technique plays a significant role in the\nchemical compositions research of the Moon. Here we describe the data analysis\nmethod for China's Chang'E-2 X-ray spectrometer (CE2XRS) in detail and present\nthe preliminary results: the first global Mg/Si and Al/Si maps on the lunar\nsurface. Our results show that the distributions of Mg/Si and Al/Si correlate\nwell with the terrains of the Moon. The higher Mg/Si ratio corresponding to the\nmare regions while the lower value corresponding to the highland terrains. The\nmap of Al/Si ratio shows a reverse relationship with the map of Mg/Si ratio.\n", "  Temporal networks come with a wide variety of heterogeneities, from\nburstiness of event sequences to correlations between timings of node and link\nactivations. In this paper, we set to explore the latter by using greedy walks\nas probes of temporal network structure. Given a temporal network (a sequence\nof contacts), greedy walks proceed from node to node by always following the\nfirst available contact. Because of this, their structure is particularly\nsensitive to temporal-topological patterns involving repeated contacts between\nsets of nodes. This becomes evident in their small coverage per step as\ncompared to a temporal reference model -- in empirical temporal networks,\ngreedy walks often get stuck within small sets of nodes because of correlated\ncontact patterns. While this may also happen in static networks that have\npronounced community structure, the use of the temporal reference model takes\nthe underlying static network structure out of the equation and indicates that\nthere is a purely temporal reason for the observations. Further analysis of the\nstructure of greedy walks indicates that burst trains, sequences of repeated\ncontacts between node pairs, are the dominant factor. However, there are larger\npatterns too, as shown with non-backtracking greedy walks. We proceed further\nto study the entropy rates of greedy walks, and show that the sequences of\nvisited nodes are more structured and predictable in original data as compared\nto temporally uncorrelated references. Taken together, these results indicate a\nrichness of correlated temporal-topological patterns in temporal networks.\n", "  We report on the observation of the Josephson effect between two strongly\ninteracting fermionic superfluids coupled through a thin tunneling barrier. We\nprove that the relative population and phase are canonically conjugate\ndynamical variables, coherently oscillating throughout the entire crossover\nfrom molecular Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) superfluids. We measure the plasma frequency and we extract the Josephson\ncoupling energy, both exhibiting a non-monotonic behavior with a maximum near\nthe crossover regime. We also observe the transition from coherent to\ndissipative dynamics, which we directly ascribe to the propagation of vortices\nthrough the superfluid bulk. Our results highlight the robust nature of\nresonant superfluids, opening the door to the study of the dynamics of\nsuperfluid Fermi systems in the presence of strong correlations and\nfluctuations.\n", "  The correction of the self-interaction error (SIE) that is inherent to all\nstandard density functional theory (DFT) calculations is an object of\nincreasing interest. In this article we apply the very recently developed\nFermi-orbital based approach for the self-interaction correction (FOSIC) to a\nset of different molecular systems. Our study covers systems ranging from\nsimple diatomic to large organic molecules. We focus our analysis on the direct\nestimation of the ionization potential from orbital eigenvalues.\n", "  We study impulse response in 1-D homogeneous micro-granular chains on a\nlinear elastic substrate. Micro-granular interactions are analytically\ndescribed by the Schwarz contact model which includes nonlinear compressive as\nwell as snap-to/from-contact adhesive effects forming a hysteretic loop in the\nforce deformation relationship. We observe complex transient dynamics,\nincluding disintegration of solitary pulses, local clustering and low- to\nhigh-frequency energy transfers resulting in enhanced energy dissipation. We\nstudy in detail the underlying dynamics of cluster formation in the impulsively\nloaded medium, and relate enhanced energy dissipation to the rate of cluster\nformation. These unusual and interesting dynamical phenomena are shown to be\nrobust over a range of physically feasible conditions, and are solely scale\neffects, since they are attributed to surface forces, which have no effect at\nthe macro-scale. We establish a universal relation between the re-clustering\nrate and the effective damping in these systems. Our findings demonstrate that\nscale effects generating new nonlinear features can drastically affect the\ndynamics and acoustics of micro-granular materials.\n", "  Ta/CoFeB/MgO trilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are expected to\nplay a key role in the next generation of current and electric field switched\nmemory and logic devices. In this study we use Kerr microscopy alongside\nelectrical transport measurement to gain insight into the underlying switching\nmechanisms of such devices. We find switching to be a stochastic, domain wall\ndriven process, the speed of which is strongly dependent on the switching\ncurrent. Kerr imaging shows domain nucleation at the edge of the device which\nmodelling reveals is likely assisted by the perpendicular component of the\nOersted field. Further domain growth, leading to magnetisation reversal may be\nassisted by spin torques.\n", "  High magnetic fields (> 1 T) are measured by NMR magnetometers with\nun-rivaled precision if the precessing spin sample provides long coherence\ntimes. The longest coherence times are found in diluted ${}^{3}$He samples,\nwhich can be hyperpolarized for sufficient signal strength. In order to have\nminimal influence on the homogeneity and value of the measured magnetic field\nthe optimal container for the ${}^{3}$He should be a perfect sphere. A fused\nsilica sphere with an inner diameter of 8 mm and an outer diameter of 12 mm was\nmade from two hemispheres by diffusion bonding leaving only a small hole for\ncleaning and evacuation. This hole was closed in vacuum by a CO${}_{2}$ laser\nand the inner volume was filled with a few mbars of ${}^3$He via wall\npermeation. NMR-measurements on such a sample had coherence times of 5 min.\nWhile the hemispheres were produced with < 1 $\\mu$m deviation from sphericity,\nthe bonding left a step of ca. 50 $\\mu$m at maximum. The influence of such a\nmismatch, its orientation and materials in the direct vicinity of the sample\nare analyzed by FEM-simulations and discussed in view of coherence times and\nabsolute fields.\n", "  We propose a combined reconstruction-classification method for simultaneously\nrecovering absorption and scattering in turbid media from images of absorbed\noptical energy. This method exploits knowledge that optical parameters are\ndetermined by a limited number of classes to iteratively improve their\nestimate. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach allows for\naccurate recovery of absorption and scattering in 2 and 3 dimensions, and\ndelivers superior image quality with respect to traditional reconstruction-only\napproaches.\n", "  An explicit evaluation of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistributions at leading twist is presented, in the framework of the Nambu-Jona\nLasinio model with Pauli-Villars regularization. The transverse momentum\ndependence of the obtained distributions is generated solely by the dynamics of\nthe model. Using these results, the so called generalized Boer-Mulders shift is\nstudied and compared with recent lattice data. The obtained agreement is very\nencouraging, in particular because no additional parameter has been introduced.\nA more conclusive comparison would require a precise knowledge of the QCD\nevolution of the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions under\nscrutiny.\n", "  Self-consistent (non-)abelian statistics in 2+1D are classified by modular\ntensor categories (MTC). In recent works, a simplified axiomatic approach to\nMTCs, based on fusion coefficients $N^{ij}_k$ and spins $s_i$, was proposed. A\nnumerical search based on these axioms led to a list of possible (non-)abelian\nstatistics, with rank up to $N=7$. However, there is no guarantee that all\nsolutions to the simplified axioms are consistent and can be realised by\nbosonic physical systems. In this paper, we use simple-current algebra to\naddress this issue. We explicitly construct many-body wave functions, aiming to\nrealize the entries in the list (\\ie realize their fusion coefficients\n$N^{ij}_k$ and spins $s_i$). We find that all entries can be constructed by\nsimple-current algebra plus conjugation under time reversal symmetry. This\nsupports the conjecture that simple-current algebra is a general approach that\nallows us to construct all (non-)abelian statistics in 2+1D. It also suggests\nthat the simplified theory based on $(N^{ij}_k,s_i)$ is a classifying theory at\nleast for simple bosonic 2+1D topological orders (up to invertible topological\norders).\n", "  We connect the rare fluctuations of an Equilibrium (EQ) process and the\ntypical fluctuations of a nonequilibrium (NE) stationary process. In the\nframework of large deviation theory, this observation allows us to introduce NE\nthermodynamic potentials. For continuous-time Markov chains, we identify the\nrelevant pairs of conjugated variables and propose two NE ensembles: one with\nfixed dynamics and fluctuating time-averaged variables, and another with fixed\ntime-averaged variables, but a fluctuating dynamics. Accordingly, we show that\nNE processes are equivalent to conditioned EQ processes ensuring that NE\npotentials are Legendre dual. We find a variational principle satisfied by the\nNE potentials that reach their maximum in the NE stationary state and whose\nfirst derivatives produce the NE equations of state, and second derivatives\nproduce the NE Maxwell relations generalizing the Onsager reciprocity\nrelations.\n", "  We discuss properties of interpolating geometries in three dimensional\ngravity in the presence of a chiral anomaly. This anomaly, which introduces an\nunbalance between left and right central charges, is protected under RG flows.\nFor this simple reason it is impossible to gap a system with such an anomaly.\nOur goal is to discuss how holography captures this basic and robust feature.\nWe demonstrate the absence of a mass gap by analysing the linearized spectrum\nand holographic entanglement entropy of these backgrounds in the context of\nAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$.\n", "  In the study of disordered models like spin glasses the key object of\ninterest is the rugged energy hypersurface defined in configuration space. The\nstatistical mechanics calculation of the Gibbs-Boltzmann Partition Function\ngives the information necessary to understand the equilibrium behavior of the\nsystem as a function of the temperature but is not enough if we are interested\nin more general aspects of the hypersurface: it does not give us, for instance,\nthe different degrees of ruggedness at different scales. In the context of the\nReplica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) approach we discuss here a rather simple\nextension that can provide a much more detailed picture. The attractiveness of\nthe method relies in that it is conceptually transparent and the additional\ncalculations are rather straightforward. We think that this approach reveals an\nultrametric organisation with many levels in models like p-spin glasses when we\ninclude saddle points. In this first paper we present the detailed calculations\nfor the spherical p-spin glass model where we discover that the corresponding\ndecreasing Parisi function $q(x)$ codes this hidden ultrametric organisation.\n", "  Many infrastructure networks have a modular structure and are also\ninterdependent. While significant research has explored the resilience of\ninterdependent networks, there has been no analysis of the effects of\nmodularity. Here we develop a theoretical framework for attacks on\ninterdependent modular networks and support our results by simulations. We\nfocus on the case where each network has the same number of communities and the\ndependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different\nnetworks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city\nhas its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within\nthe city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities.\nFor example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication\nnetwork, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent\nwill likely be in the same city. It has been shown that single networks are\nvery susceptible to the failure of the interconnected nodes (between\ncommunities) Shai et al. and that attacks on these nodes are more crippling\nthan attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al. In our example of cities\nthese nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both\ntreelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes\ndepending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where there are fewer\nmodules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates into modules\nin an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second\npercolation transition. (ii) When there are more modules with many\ninterconnections between them, the system undergoes a single transition.\nOverall, we find that modular structure can influence the type of transitions\nobserved in interdependent networks and should be considered in attempts to\nmake interdependent networks more resilient.\n", "  It is well known that annihilations in the homogeneous fluid of dark matter\n(DM) can leave imprints in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy\npower spectrum. However, the relevance of DM annihilations in halos for\ncosmological observables is still subject to debate, with previous works\nreaching different conclusions on this point. Also, all previous studies used a\nsingle type of parameterization for the astrophysical reionization, and\nincluded no astrophysical source for the heating of the intergalactic medium.\nIn this work, we revisit these problems. When standard approaches are adopted,\nwe find that the ionization fraction does exhibit a very particular (and\npotentially constraining) pattern, but the currently measurable optical depth\nto reionization is left almost unchanged: In agreement with the most of the\nprevious literature, for plausible halo models we find that the modification of\nthe signal with respect to the one coming from annihilations in the smooth\nbackground is tiny, below cosmic variance within currently allowed parameter\nspace. However, if different and probably more realistic treatments of the\nastrophysical sources of reionization and heating are adopted, a more\npronounced effect of the DM annihilation in halos is possible. We thus conclude\nthat within currently adopted baseline models the impact of the virialised DM\nstructures cannot be uncovered by CMB power spectra measurements, but a larger\nimpact is possible if peculiar models are invoked for the redshift evolution of\nthe DM annihilation signal or different assumptions are made for the\nastrophysical contributions. A better understanding (both theoretical and\nobservational) of the reionization and temperature history of the universe,\nnotably via the 21 cm signal, seems the most promising way for using halo\nformation as a tool in DM searches, improving over the sensitivity of current\ncosmological probes.\n", "  The calculation of finite temperature ESR spectra for concrete specified\ncrystal configurations is a very important issue in the study of quantum spin\nsystems. Although direct evaluation of the Kubo formula by means of numerical\ndiagonalization yields exact results, memory and CPU-time restrictions limit\nthe applicability of this approach to small system sizes. Methods based on the\ntime evolution of a single pure quantum state can be used to study larger\nsystems. One such method exploits the property that the expectation value of\nthe autocorrelation function obtained for a few samples of so-called thermal\ntypical states yields a good estimate of the thermal equilibrium value. In this\npaper, we propose a new method based on a Wiener-Khinchin-like theorem for\nquantum system. By comparison with exact diagonalization results, it is shown\nthat both methods yield correct results. As the Wiener-Khinchin-based method\ninvolves sampling over thermal typical states, we study the statistical\nproperties of the sampling distribution. Effects due to finite observation time\nare investigated and found to be different for the two methods but it is also\nfound that for both methods, the effects vanish as the system size increases.\nWe present ESR spectra of the one-dimensional XXZ Heisenberg chain of up to 26\nspins show that double peak structure due to the anisotropy is a robust feature\nof these spectra.\n", "  It was recently shown that the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear\nwavefunction allows the construction of a Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nelectronic system, in which the potential contains exactly the effect of\ncoupling to the nuclear degrees of freedom and any external fields. Here we\nstudy the exact potential acting on the electron in charge-resonance enhanced\nionization in a model one-dimensional H$_2^+$ molecule. We show there can be\nsignificant differences between the exact potential and that used in the\ntraditional quasistatic analyses, arising from non-adiabatic coupling to the\nnuclear system, and that these are crucial to include for accurate simulations\nof time-resolved ionization dynamics and predictions of the ionization yield.\n", "  We propose an extension of the concept of algebraic entropy, as introduced by\nBellon and Viallet for rational maps, to algebraic maps (or correspondences) of\na certain kind. The corresponding entropy is an index of the complexity of the\nmap. The definition inherits the basic properties from the definition of\nentropy for rational maps. We give an example with positive entropy, as well as\ntwo examples taken from the theory of Backlund transformations.\n", "  We calculate the massive Wilson coefficients for the heavy flavor\ncontributions to the non-singlet charged current deep-inelastic scattering\nstructure function $xF_3^{W^+}(x,Q^2)+xF_3^{W^-}(x,Q^2)$ in the asymptotic\nregion $Q^2 \\gg m^2$ to 3-loop order in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at general\nvalues of the Mellin variable $N$ and the momentum fraction $x$. Besides the\nheavy quark pair production also the single heavy flavor excitation $s\n\\rightarrow c$ contributes. Numerical results are presented for the charm quark\ncontributions and consequences on the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We introduce a new jet algorithm called XCone, for eXclusive Cone, which is\nbased on minimizing the event shape N-jettiness. Because N-jettiness partitions\nevery event into N jet regions and a beam region, XCone is an exclusive jet\nalgorithm that always returns a fixed number of jets. We use a new \"conical\ngeometric\" measure for which well-separated jets are bounded by circles of\nradius R in the rapidity-azimuth plane, while overlapping jet regions\nautomatically form nearest-neighbor \"clover jets\". This avoids the split/merge\ncriteria needed in inclusive cone algorithms. A key feature of XCone is that it\nsmoothly transitions between the resolved regime where the N signal jets of\ninterest are well separated and the boosted regime where they overlap. The\nreturned value of N-jettiness also provides a quality criterion of how\nN-jet-like the event looks. We also discuss the N-jettiness factorization\ntheorems that occur for various jet measures, which can be used to compute the\nassociated exclusive N-jet cross sections. In a companion paper, the physics\npotential of XCone is demonstrated using the examples of dijet resonances,\nHiggs decays to bottom quarks, and all-hadronic top pairs.\n", "  A recent paper argued that it is not possible to infer the energy scale of\ninflation from the amplitude of tensor fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground, because the usual connection is substantially altered if there are\na large number of universally coupled fields present during inflation, with\nmass less than the inflationary Hubble scale. We give a simple argument\ndemonstrating that this is incorrect.\n", "  The so-called quasi-Bell entangled coherent states in a thermal environment\nare studied. In the analysis, we assume thermal noise affects only one of the\ntwo modes of each state. First the matrix representation of the density\noperators of the quasi-Bell entangled coherent states in a thermal environment\nis derived. Secondly we investigate the entanglement property of one of the\nquasi-Bell entangled coherent states with thermal noise. At that time a lower\nbound of the entanglement of formation for the state is computed. Thirdly the\nminimax discrimination problem for two cases of the binary set of the\nquasi-Bell entangled coherent states with thermal noise is considered, and the\nerror probabilities of the minimax discrimination for the two cases are\ncomputed with the help of Helstrom's algorithm for finding the Bayes optimal\nerror probability of binary states.\n", "  This article reports the optimized experimental requirements to determine\nneutrino mass hierarchy using electron antineutrinos ($\\bar{\\nu}_e$) generated\nin a nuclear reactor. The features of the neutrino mass hierarchy can be\nextracted from the $|\\Delta m^{2}_{31}|$ and $|\\Delta m^{2}_{32}|$ oscillations\nby applying the Fourier sine and cosine transform to the $L/E$ spectrum. To\ndetermine the neutrino mass hierarchy above 90\\% probability, the requirements\non the energy resolution as a function of the baseline are studied at $\\sin\n2\\theta_{13}=0.1$. If the energy resolution of the neutrino detector is less\nthan $0.04/ \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}}$ and the determination probability obtained from\nBayes' theorem is above 90\\%, the detector needs to be located around 48--53 km\nfrom the reactor(s) to measure the energy spectrum of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$. These\nresults will be helpful for setting up an experiment to determine the neutrino\nmass hierarchy, which is an important problem in neutrino physics.\n", "  The temporal evolution of the entanglement between two qubits evolving by\nrandom interactions is studied analytically and numerically. Two different\ntypes of randomness are investigated. Firstly we analyze an ensemble of systems\nwith randomly chosen but time-independent interaction Hamiltonians. Secondly we\nconsider the case of a temporally fluctuating Hamiltonian, where the unitary\nevolution can be understood as a random walk on the SU (4) group manifold. As a\nby-product we compute the metric tensor and its inverse as well as the\nLaplace-Beltrami for SU (4).\n", "  In generalizing the special-relativistic one-component version of Eckart's\ncontinuum thermodynamics to general-relativistic space-times with Riemannian or\npost-Riemannian geometry, we consider the entropy production and other\nthemodynamical quantities such as the entropy flux and the Gibbs fundamental\nequation. We discuss equilibrium conditions in gravitational theories which are\nbased on such geometries. In particular, thermodynamic implications of the\nnon-symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor and the related spin balance\nequations are investigated, also for the special case of General Relativity.\n", "  Recently, Keating, Linden, and Wells \\cite{KLW} showed that the density of\nstates measure of a nearest-neighbor quantum spin glass model is approximately\nGaussian when the number of particles is large. The density of states measure\nis the ensemble average of the empirical spectral measure of a random matrix;\nin this paper, we use concentration of measure and entropy techniques together\nwith the result of \\cite{KLW} to show that in fact, the empirical spectral\nmeasure of such a random matrix is almost surely approximately Gaussian itself,\nwith no ensemble averaging. We also extend this result to a spherical quantum\nspin glass model and to the more general coupling geometries investigated by\nErd\\H{o}s and Schr\\\"oder.\n", "  The $m_T$-dependencies of the femto-scales, the so-called interferometry and\nsource radii, are investigated within the hydrokinetic model for different\ntypes of particle pairs - pion-pion, kaon-kaon, proton-proton and\nproton-lambda, - produced in Pb+Pb and $p+p$ collisions at the LHC. In\nparticular, such property of the femto-scales momentum behavior as\n$m_T$-scaling is studied for the systems with (w) and without (w/o) intensive\ntransverse flow, and also w and w/o re-scattering at the final afterburner\nstage of the matter evolution. The detail spatiotemporal description obtained\nwithin hydrokinetic model is compared with the simple analytical results for\nthe spectra and longitudinal interferometry radii depending on the effective\ntemperature on the hypersurface of maximal emission, proper time of such\nemission, and intensity of transverse flow. The derivation of the corresponding\nanalytical formulas and discussion about a possibility for their utilization by\nthe experimentalists for the simple femtoscopy data analysis is the main aim of\nthis theoretical investigation.\n", "  Rare decay modes of the newly discovered standard-model-like Higgs boson $h$\nmay test the flavor changing couplings in the leptoquark sector through the\nprocess $h \\to \\tau^\\mp\\mu^\\pm$. Motived by the recently reported excess in LHC\ndata from the CMS detector, we found that a predicted branching fraction Br($h\n\\to \\tau^\\mp\\mu^\\pm$) at the level of 1\\% is possible even though the coupling\nparameters are subjected to the stringent constraint from the null observation\nof $\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$, where the destructive cancellation among amplitudes is\nachievable by fine tuning.\n", "  We comprehensively analyse the theoretical prediction for the Lamb shift in\nmuonic hydrogen, and the associated determination of the proton radius. We use\neffective field theories. This allows us to relate the proton radius with\nwell-defined objects in quantum field theory, eliminating unnecessary model\ndependence. The use of effective field theories also helps us to organize the\ncomputation so that we can clearly state the parametric accuracy of the result.\nIn this paper we review all (and check several of) the contributions to the\nenergy shift of order $\\alpha^5$, as well as those that scale like\n$\\alpha^6\\times$logarithms in the context of non-relativistic effective field\ntheories of QED.\n", "  In a continuous search for the energy-efficient electronic switches, a great\nattention is focused on tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) demonstrating\nan abrupt dependence of the source-drain current on the gate voltage. Among all\nTFETs, those based on one-dimensional (1D) semiconductors exhibit the steepest\ncurrent switching due to the singular density of states near the band edges,\nthough the current in 1D structures is pretty low. In this paper, we propose a\nTFET based on 2D graphene bilayer which demonstrates a record steep\nsubthreshold slope enabled by van Hove singularities in the density of states\nnear the edges of conduction and valence bands. Our simulations show the\naccessibility of 3.5 x 10$^4$ ON/OFF current ratio with 150 mV gate voltage\nswing, and a maximum subthreshold slope of (20 {\\mu}V/dec)$^{-1}$ just above\nthe threshold. The high ON-state current of 0.8 mA/{\\mu}m is enabled by a\nnarrow (~ 0.3 eV) extrinsic band gap, while the smallness of the leakage\ncurrent is due to an all-electrical doping of the source and drain contacts\nwhich suppresses the band-tailing and trap-assisted tunneling.\n", "  In order for surface scattering models to be accurate they must necessarily\nsatisfy energy conservation and reciprocity principles. Roughness scattering\nmodels based on Kirchoff's approximation or perturbation theory do not satisfy\nthese criteria in all frequency ranges. Here we present a surface scattering\nmodel based on analysis of scattering from a layer of particles on top of a\nsubstrate in the dipole approximation which satisfies both energy conservation\nand reciprocity and is thus accurate in all frequency ranges. The model takes\ninto account the absorption in the substrate induced by the particles but does\nnot take into account the near-field interactions between the particles.\n", "  We theoretically analyze a system where two electrons are trapped separately\nin two quantum dots on a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT), subject to external\nac electric driving. An indirect mechanically-induced coupling of two distant\nsingle electron spins is induced by the interaction between the spins and the\nmechanical motion of the CNT. We show that a two-qubit iSWAP gate and arbitrary\nsingle-qubit gates can be obtained from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling.\nCombining the iSWAP gate and single-qubit gates, maximally entangled states of\ntwo spins can be generated in a single step by varying the frequency and the\nstrength of the external electric driving field. The spin-phonon coupling can\nbe turned off by electrostatically shifting the electron wave function on the\nnanotube.\n", "  The one-dimensional extended bosonic Hubbard model has been shown to exhibit\na variety of phases ranging from Mott insulator and superfluid to exotic\nsupersolids and Haldane insulators depending on the filling and the relative\nvalue of the contact ($U$) and near neighbor ($V$) interaction strengths. In\nthis paper we use the density matrix renormalization group and the time\nevolving block decimation numerical methods to study in detail the dynamics and\nexcitation spectra of this model in its various phases. In particular, we study\nin detail the behavior of the charge and neutral gaps which characterize the\nMott, charge density and Haldane insulating phases. We also show that in\naddition to the gapless modes at $k=0$, the supersolid phase exhibits gapless\nmodes at a finite $k$ which depends on the filling.\n", "  We show that the magnetic anisotropy in spinel-structure CoCr$_2$O$_4$ thin\nfilms exhibits a strain dependence in which compressive strain induces an\nout-of-plane magnetic easy axis and tensile strain an in-plane easy axis,\nexactly opposite to the behavior reported for the related compound\nCoFe$_2$O$_4$. We use density functional theory calculations within the LSDA+U\napproximation to reproduce and explain the observed behavior. Using\nsecond-order perturbation theory, we analyse the anisotropy tensor of the\nCo$^{2+}$ ions in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination, allowing us to\nextend our results to spinels with general arrangements of Co$^{2+}$ ions.\n", "  We study the CP violation effects from two types of neutrino mass matrices\nwith (i) $(M_\\nu)_{ee}=0$, and (ii) $(M_\\nu)_{ee}=(M_\\nu)_{e\\mu}=0$, which can\nbe realized by the high dimensional lepton number violating operators $\\bar\n\\ell_R^c\\gamma^\\mu L_L (D_\\mu \\Phi)\\Phi^2$ and $\\bar \\ell_R^c l_R\n(D_\\mu{\\Phi})^2\\Phi^2$, respectively. In (i), the neutrino mass spectrum is in\nthe normal ordering with the lightest neutrino mass within the range\n$0.002\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_0\\lesssim 0.007\\,{\\rm eV}$. Furthermore, for a given\nvalue of $m_0$, there are two solutions for the two Majorana phases\n$\\alpha_{21}$ and $\\alpha_{31}$, whereas the Dirac phase $\\delta$ is arbitrary.\nFor (ii), the parameters of $m_0$, $\\delta$, $\\alpha_{21}$, and $\\alpha_{31}$\ncan be completely determined. We calculate the CP violating asymmetries in\nneutrino-antineutrino oscillations for both mass textures of (i) and (ii),\nwhich are closely related to the CP violating Majorana phases.\n", "  We have investigated the temperature and magnetic field dependence of\nmagnetization ($M$), specific heat ($C_p$), and relative sample length change\n($\\Delta L/L_0$) for understanding the field-induced metamagnetic transitions\nin quasi-one-dimensional monoclinic ($\\alpha$ phase) and triclinic ($\\gamma$\nphase) CoV$_2$O$_6$ spin chains. With the application of external magnetic\nfield, a sharp peak emerges in $C_p$($T$) below $T_N$$=$15 K in $\\alpha$ phase\nand a hump-like feature appears above $T_N$$=$6.5 K in $\\gamma$ phase due to\nthe field-induced ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic transitions, respectively.\nStrong field dependence of linear thermal expansion and large positive\nmagnetostriction have been observed in $\\alpha$ phase. Though magnetization\ndata indicate strong spin-orbit coupling for both phases, other measurements\nshow that this effect is very weak for the $\\gamma$ phase.\n", "  We propose a versatile and efficient method to generate a broad class of\ncomplex entangled states of many atoms via the detection of a single photon.\nFor an atomic ensemble contained in a strongly coupled optical cavity\nilluminated by weak single- or multi-frequency light, the atom-light\ninteraction entangles the frequency spectrum of a transmitted photon with the\ncollective spin of the atomic ensemble. Simple time-resolved detection of the\ntransmitted photon then projects the atomic ensemble into a desired pure\nentangled state. This method can be implemented with existing technology,\nyields high success probability per trials, and can generate complex entangled\nstates such as multicomponent Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states with high fidelity.\n", "  We study the statistical properties of charge and energy transport in\nelectron conducting junctions with electron-phonon interactions, specifically,\nthe thermoelectric efficiency and its fluctuations. The system comprises donor\nand acceptor electronic states, representing a two-site molecule or a double\nquantum dot system. Electron transfer between metals through the two molecular\nsites is coupled to a particular vibrational mode which is taken to be either\nharmonic or anharmonic- a truncated (two-state) spectrum. Considering these\nmodels we derive the cumulant generating function in steady state for charge\nand energy transfer, correct to second-order in the electron-phonon\ninteraction, but exact to all orders in the metal-molecule coupling strength.\nThis is achieved by using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach\n(harmonic mode) and a kinetic quantum master equation method (anharmonic mode).\nFrom the cumulant generating function we calculate the charge current and its\nnoise and the large deviation function for the thermoelectric efficiency. We\ndemonstrate that at large bias the charge current, differential conductance,\nand the current noise can identify energetic and structural properties of the\njunction. We further examine the operation of the junction as a thermoelectric\nengine and show that while the macroscopic thermoelectric efficiency is\nindifferent to the nature of the mode (harmonic or anharmonic), efficiency\nfluctuations do reflect this property.\n", "  We compare the performance of two very different parallel gravitational\n$N$-body codes for astrophysical simulations on large GPU clusters, both\npioneer in their own fields as well as in certain mutual scales - NBODY6++ and\nBonsai. We carry out the benchmark of the two codes by analyzing their\nperformance, accuracy and efficiency through the modeling of structure\ndecomposition and timing measurements. We find that both codes are heavily\noptimized to leverage the computational potential of GPUs as their performance\nhas approached half of the maximum single precision performance of the\nunderlying GPU cards. With such performance we predict that a speed-up of\n$200-300$ can be achieved when up to 1k processors and GPUs are employed\nsimultaneously. We discuss the quantitative information about comparisons of\ntwo codes, finding that in the same cases Bonsai adopts larger time steps as\nwell as relative energy errors than NBODY6++, typically ranging from $10-50$\ntimes larger, depending on the chosen parameters of the codes. While the two\ncodes are built for different astrophysical applications, in specified\nconditions they may overlap in performance at certain physical scale, and thus\nallowing the user to choose from either one with finetuned parameters\naccordingly.\n", "  Pressure induced electronic topological transitions in the wide band gap\nsemiconductor Sb2S3 (Eg = 1.7-1.8 eV) with similar crystal symmetry (SG: Pnma)\nto its illustrious analog, Sb2Se3, has been studied using Raman spectroscopy,\nresistivity and the available literature on the x-ray diffraction studies. In\nthis report, the vibrational and the transport properties of Sb2S3 have been\nstudied up to 22 GPa and 11 GPa, respectively. We observed the softening of\nphonon modes Ag(2), Ag(3) and B2g and a sharp anomaly in their line widths at 4\nGPa. The resistivity studies also shows an anomaly around this pressure. The\nchanges in resistivity as well as Raman line widths can be ascribed to the\nchanges in the topology of the Fermi surface which induces the electron-phonon\nand the strong phonon-phonon coupling, indicating a clear evidence of the\nelectronic topological transition (ETT) in Sb2S3. The pressure dependence of\na/c ratio plot obtained from the literature showed a minimum at ~ 5 GPa, which\nis consistent with our high pressure Raman and resistivity results. Finally, we\ngive the plausible reasons for the non-existence of a non-trivial topological\nstate in Sb2S3 at high pressures.\n", "  We study two realisations of the Fake Split Supersymmetry Model (FSSM), the\nsimplest model that can easily reproduce the experimental value of the Higgs\nmass for an arbitrarily high supersymmetry scale, as a consequence of swapping\nhiggsinos for equivalent states, fake higgsinos, with suppressed Yukawa\ncouplings. If the LSP is identified as the main Dark matter component, then a\nstandard thermal history of the Universe implies upper bounds on the\nsupersymmetry scale, which we derive. On the other hand, we show that\nrenormalisation group running of soft masses above the supersymmetry scale\nbarely constrains the model - in stark contrast to Split Supersymmetry - and\nhence we can have a \"Mega Split\" spectrum even with all of these assumptions\nand constraints, which include the requirements of a correct relic abundance, a\ngluino life-time compatible with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and absence of\nsignals in present direct detection experiments of inelastic dark matter. In an\nappendix we describe a related scenario, Fake Split Extended Supersymmetry,\nwhich enjoys similar properties.\n", "  We give a new formula for all tree-level correlators of boundary field\ninsertions in gauged N=8 supergravity in AdS_4; this is an analog of the\ntree-level S-matrix in anti-de Sitter space. The formula is written in terms of\nrational maps from the Riemann sphere to twistor space, with no reference to\nbulk perturbation theory. It is polynomial in the cosmological constant, and\nequal to the classical scattering amplitudes of supergravity in the flat space\nlimit. The formula is manifestly supersymmetric, independent of gauge choices\non twistor space, and equivalent to expressions computed via perturbation\ntheory at 3-point MHV-bar and n-point MHV. We also show that the formula\nfactorizes and obeys BCFW recursion in twistor space.\n", "  We study the $\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray luminosity and beaming effect for Fermi\nblazars. Our results are as follows. (i) There are significant correlations\nbetween $\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray luminosity and radio core luminosity, and between\n$\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray luminosity and $\\rm{R_{v}}$, which suggests that the\n$\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray emissions have strong beaming effect. (ii) Using the\n$\\rm{L_{ext}/M_{abs}}$ as an indicator of environment effects, we find that\nthere have no significant correlation between $\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray luminosity and\n$\\rm{L_{ext}/M_{abs}}$ for all sources when remove the effect of redshift.\nFSRQs considered alone also do not show a significant correlation, while BL\nLacs still show a significant correlation when remove the effect of redshift.\nThese results suggest that the $\\rm{\\gamma}$-ray emission may be affected by\nenvironment on the kiloparsec-scale for BL Lacs.\n", "  We develop a flexible quasiparticle theory of transport coefficients of hot\nhadronic matter at finite baryon density. We begin with a hadronic\nquasiparticle model which includes a scalar and a vector mean field.\nQuasiparticle energies and the mean fields depend on temperature and baryon\nchemical potential. Starting with the quasiparticle dispersion relation, we\nderive the Boltzmann equation and use the Chapman-Enskog expansion to derive\nformulas for the shear and bulk viscosities and thermal conductivity. We obtain\nboth relaxation time approximation formulas and more general integral\nequations. Throughout the work, we explicitly enforce the Landau-Lifshitz\nconditions of fit and ensure the theory is thermodynamically self-consistent.\nThe derived formulas should be useful for predicting the transport coefficients\nof the hadronic phase of matter produced in heavy-ion collisions at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and at other accelerators.\n", "  This work describes a new 1D hybrid approach for modeling atmospheric\npressure discharges featuring complex chemistry. In this approach electrons are\ndescribed fully kinetically using Particle-In-Cell/Monte-Carlo (PIC/MCC)\nscheme, whereas the heavy species are modeled within a fluid description.\nValidity of the popular drift-diffusion approximation is verified against a\n\"full\" fluid model accounting for the ion inertia and a fully kinetic PIC/MCC\ncode for ions as well as electrons. The fluid models require knowledge of the\nmomentum exchange frequency and dependence of the ion mobilities on the\nelectric field when the ions are in equilibrium with the latter. To this end an\nauxiliary Monte-Carlo scheme is constructed. It is demonstrated that the\ndrift-diffusion approximation can overestimate ion transport in simulations of\nRF-driven discharges with heavy ion species operated in the $\\gamma$ mode at\nthe atmospheric pressure or in all discharge simulations for lower pressures.\nThis can lead to exaggerated plasma densities and incorrect profiles provided\nby the drift-diffusion models. Therefore, the hybrid code version featuring the\nfull ion fluid model should be favored against the more popular drfit-diffusion\nmodel, noting that the suggested numerical scheme for the former model implies\nonly a small additional computational cost.\n", "  The recent advances in creating nearly degenerate quantum dipolar gases in\noptical lattices are opening the doors for the exploration of equilibrium\nphysics of quantum systems with anisotropic and long-range dipolar\ninteractions. In this paper we study the zero- and finite-temperature phase\ndiagrams of a system of hard-core dipolar bosons at half-filling, trapped in a\ntwo-dimensional optical lattice. The dipoles are aligned parallel to one\nanother and tilted out of the optical lattice plane by means of an external\nelectric field. At zero-temperature, the system is a superfluid at all tilt\nangles $\\theta$ provided that the strength of dipolar interaction is below a\ncritical value $V_c(\\theta)$. Upon increasing the interaction strength while\nkeeping $\\theta$ fixed, the superfluid phase is destabilized in favor of a\ncheckerboard or a stripe solid depending on the tilt angle. We explore the\nnature of the phase transition between the two solid phases and find evidence\nof a micro-emulsion phase, following the Spivak-Kivelson scenario, separating\nthese two solid phases. Additionally, we study the stability of these quantum\nphases against thermal fluctuations and find that the stripe solid is the most\nrobust, making it the best candidate for experimental observation.\n", "  We derive the relation between the amplitudes of short-baseline appearance\nand disappearance oscillations in 3+$N_{s}$ neutrino mixing schemes which is\nthe origin of the appearance-disappearance tension that is found from the\nanalysis of the existing data in any 3+$N_{s}$ neutrino mixing scheme. We\nillustrate the power of the relation to reveal the appearance-disappearance\ntension in the cases of 3+1 and 3+2 mixing using the results of global fits of\nshort-baseline neutrino oscillation data.\n", "  Classical scale invariance (CSI) may be one of the solutions for the\nhierarchy problem. Realistic models for electroweak symmetry breaking based on\nCSI require extended scalar sectors without mass terms, and the electroweak\nsymmetry is broken dynamically at the quantum level by the Coleman-Weinberg\nmechanism. We discuss discriminative features of these models. First, using the\nexperimental value of the mass of the discovered Higgs boson $h(125)$, we\nobtain an upper bound on the mass of the lightest additional scalar boson (~543\nGeV), which does not depend on its isospin and hypercharge. Second, a\ndiscriminative prediction on the Higgs-photon-photon coupling is given as a\nfunction of the number of charged scalar bosons, by which we can narrow down\npossible models using current and future data for the di-photon decay of\n$h(125)$. Finally, for the triple Higgs boson coupling a large deviation (~ +70\n%) from the SM prediction is universally predicted, which is independent of\nmasses, quantum numbers and even the number of additional scalars. These models\nbased on CSI can be well tested at LHC Run II and at future lepton colliders.\n", "  It is nearly impossible to separate two interleaved phonebooks when held by\ntheir spines. A full understanding of this astonishing demonstration of solid\nfriction in complex assemblies has remained elusive. In this Letter, we report\non experiments with controlled booklets and show that the force required\nincreases sharply with the number of sheets. A model captures the effect of the\nnumber of sheets, their thickness and the overlapping distance. Furthermore,\nthe data collapse onto a self-similar master curve with one dimensionless\namplification parameter. In addition to solving a long-standing familiar\nenigma, this model system provides a framework with which one can accurately\nmeasure friction forces and coefficients at low loads, and that has relevance\nto complex assemblies from the macro to the nanoscale.\n", "  We have used a photothermal technique, in which chopped light heats the front\nsurface of a small ( ~ 1 mm2) sample and the chopping frequency dependence of\nthermal radiation from the back surface is measured with a liquid nitrogen\ncooled infrared detector. In our system, the sample is placed directly in front\nof the detector within its dewar. Because the detector is also sensitive to\nsome of the incident light which leaks around or through the sample,\nmeasurements are made for the detector signal that is in quadrature with the\nchopped light. Results are presented for layered crystals of semiconducting\n6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pn) and for papers of\ncellulose nanofibrils coated with semiconducting\npoly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (NFC-PEDOT). For\nNFC-PEDOT, we have found that the transverse diffusivity, smaller than the\nin-plane value, varies inversely with thickness, suggesting that texturing of\nthe papers varies with thickness. For TIPS-pn, we have found that the\ninterlayer diffusivity is an order of magnitude larger than the in-plane value,\nconsistent with previous estimates, suggesting that low-frequency optical\nphonons, presumably associated with librations in the TIPS side-groups, carry\nmost of the heat.\n", "  Frequency conversion (FC) is an enabling process in many quantum information\nprotocols. Recently, it has been observed that upconversion efficiencies in\nsingle-photon, mode-selective FC are limited to around 80%.In this letter we\nargue that these limits can be understood as time-ordering corrections (TOCs)\nthat modify the joint conversion amplitude of the process. Furthermore we show,\nusing a simple scaling argument, that recently proposed cascaded FC protocols\nthat overcome the aforementioned limitations act as \"attenuators\" of the TOCs.\nThis observation allows us to argue that very similar cascaded architectures\ncan be used to attenuate TOCs in photon generation via spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion. Finally, by using the Magnus expansion, we argue that the\nTOCs, which are usually considered detrimental for FC efficiency, can also be\nused to increase the efficiency of conversion in partially mode selective FC.\n", "  Ising spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian near-neighbor interaction\ndistributions are studied through numerical simulations. The non-self-averaging\n(normalized inter-sample variance) parameter $U_{22}(T,L)$ for the spin glass\nsusceptibility (and for higher moments $U_{nn}(T,L)$) is reported for\ndimensions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. In each dimension $d$ the non-self-averaging\nparameters in the paramagnetic regime vary with the sample size L and the\ncorrelation length $\\xi(T,L)$ as $U_{nn}(\\beta,L) = [K_{d}\\xi(T,L)/L]^d$, and\nso follow a renormalization group law due to Aharony and Harris (1991).\nEmpirically, it is found that the $K_{d}$ values are independent of d to within\nthe statistics. The maximum values $[U_{nn}(T,L)]_{\\max}$ are almost\nindependent of L in each dimension, and remarkably the estimated thermodynamic\nlimit critical $[U_{nn}(T,L)]_{\\max}$ peak values are also\ndimension-independent to within the statistics and so are \"hyperuniversal\".\nThese results show that the form of the spin-spin correlation function\ndistribution at criticality in the large $L$ limit is independent of dimension\nwithin the ISG family. Inspection of published non-self-averaging data for 3D\nHeisenberg and XY spin glasses the light of the Ising spin glass\nnon-self-averaging results show behavior incompatible with a spin-driven\nordering scenario, but compatible with that expected on a chiral-driven\nordering interpretation.\n", "  Precision control over hybrid physical systems at the quantum level is\nimportant for the realization of many quantum-based technologies. In the field\nof quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various\nproposals discuss the possibility of hybrid architectures where specific tasks\nare delegated to the most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks,\nit may be advantageous to transfer information from a subsystem that has good\nmemory properties to another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting\ninformation between nodes in the network. For trapped-ions, a hybrid system\nformed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be\nexploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different\nelements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling,\ncreation of entanglement through dissipation, and quantum non-demolition (QND)\nmeasurement of one species with another. Here, we demonstrate an entangling\nquantum gate between ions of different elements which can serve as an important\nbuilding block of QIP, quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology,\nand quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate between a $^9$Be$^+$ ion and a\n$^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction\ngenerated by state-dependent forces induced with laser beams. Combined with\nsingle-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element\nentangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for\nuniversal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a Controlled-NOT\n(CNOT) gate and a SWAP gate. We further demonstrate the robustness of these\ngates against thermal excitation and show improved detection in quantum logic\nspectroscopy (QLS). We also observe a strong violation of a CHSH-type Bell\ninequality on entangled states composed of different ion species.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the pulsating string solutions in AdS3 x S3\nsupported by both RR and NS-NS fluxes. This background has recently been proved\nto be integrable. We find the dispersion relation between the energy,\noscillation number and other conserved charges when the NS-NS flux turned on is\nsmall. We further discuss the fate of the string solutions in pure RR and NS-NS\ncases.\n", "  We present a theoretical model to describe the double-resonant scattering\nprocess in arbitrary carbon nanotubes. We use this approach to investigate the\ndefect-induced $D$ mode in CNTs and unravel the dependence of the $D$-mode\nfrequency on the CNT diameter and on the energy of the resonant optical\ntransition. Our approach is based on the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice and\ngeometric considerations, hence the method is independent of the exact model\nthat is chosen to describe the electronic band structure or the phonon\ndispersion. We finally clarify the diameter dependence of this Raman mode that\nwas controversely discussed in the past and demonstrate that, depending on the\nexperimental conditions, in general two different dependencies can be measured.\nWe also prove that carbon nanotubes with arbitrary chiral index can exhibit a\n$D$ mode in their Raman spectrum, in contrast to previous symmetry-based\narguments. Furthermore, we give a direct quantification of the\ncurvature-induced phonon frequency corrections of the $D$-mode in carbon\nnanotubes with respect to graphite.\n", "  The richness of quantum theory's reversible dynamics is one of its unique\noperational characteristics, with recent results suggesting deep links between\nthe theory's reversible dynamics, its local state space and the degree of\nnon-locality it permits. We explore the delicate interplay between these\nfeatures, demonstrating that reversibility places strong constraints on both\nthe local and global state space. Firstly, we show that reversible dynamics are\ntrivial (composed of local transformations and permutations of subsytems) in\nmaximally non-local theories whose local state spaces satisfy a dichotomy\ncriterion; this applies to a range of operational models that have previously\nbeen studied, such as d-dimensional \"hyperballs\" and almost all regular\npolytope systems. By separately deriving a similar result for odd-sided\npolygons, we show that classical systems are the only regular polytope state\nspaces whose maximally non-local composites allow for non-trivial reversible\ndynamics. Secondly, we show that non-trivial reversible dynamics do exist in\nmaximally non-local theories whose state spaces are reducible into two or more\nsmaller spaces. We conjecture that this is a necessary condition for the\nexistence of such dynamics, but that reversible entanglement generation remains\nimpossible even in this scenario.\n", "  Generalized relative entropy, monotone Riemannian metrics, geodesic distance,\nand trace distance are all known to decrease under the action of quantum\nchannels. We give some new bounds on, and relationships between, the maximal\ncontraction for these quantities.\n", "  We present a local representation of the electronic dielectric response\nfunction, based on a spatial partition of the dielectric response into\ncontributions from each Wannier function using a generalized density functional\nperturbation theory. This procedure is fully ab initio, and therefore allows us\nto rigorously define local metrics, such as \"bond polarizability,\" on Wannier\ncenters. We show that the locality of the response function is determined by\nthe locality of three quantities: Wannier functions of the occupied manifold,\nthe density matrix, and the Hamiltonian matrix. In systems with a gap, the bare\ndielectric response is exponentially localized, which supports the physical\npicture of the dielectric response function as a collection of interacting\nlocal response that can be captured by a tight-binding model.\n", "  We formulate new integration rules for one-loop scattering equations\nanalogous to those at tree-level, and test them in a number of non-trivial\ncases for amplitudes in scalar $\\phi^3$-theory. This formalism greatly\nfacilitates the evaluation of amplitudes in the CHY representation at one-loop\norder, without the need to explicitly sum over the solutions to the loop-level\nscattering equations.\n", "  Within the next few years, Advanced LIGO and Virgo should detect\ngravitational waves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole\nmergers. These sources are also predicted to power a broad array of\nelectromagnetic transients. Because the electromagnetic signatures can be faint\nand fade rapidly, observing them hinges on rapidly inferring the sky location\nfrom the gravitational-wave observations. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for\ngravitational-wave parameter estimation can take hours or more. We introduce\nBAYESTAR, a rapid, Bayesian, non-Markov chain Monte Carlo sky localization\nalgorithm that takes just seconds to produce probability sky maps that are\ncomparable in accuracy to the full analysis. Prompt localizations from BAYESTAR\nwill make it possible to search electromagnetic counterparts of compact binary\nmergers.\n", "  Despite relevance to disparate areas such as cloud microphysics and\ntribology, major gaps in the understanding of the structures and phase\ntransitions of low-dimensional water ice remain. Here we report a first\nprinciples study of confined 2D ice as a function of pressure. We find that at\nambient pressure hexagonal and pentagonal monolayer structures are the two\nlowest enthalpy phases identified. Upon mild compression the pentagonal\nstructure becomes the most stable and persists up to \\textit{ca.} 2 GPa at\nwhich point square and rhombic phases are stable. The square phase agrees with\nrecent experimental observations of square ice confined within graphene sheets.\nWe also find a double layer AA stacked square ice phase, which clarifies the\ndifference between experimental observations and earlier force field\nsimulations. This work provides a fresh perspective on 2D confined ice,\nhighlighting the sensitivity of the structures observed to both the confining\npressure and width.\n", "  We propose and analyze Maxwell's demon based on a single qubit with avoided\nlevel crossing. Its operation cycle consists of adiabatic drive to the point of\nminimum energy separation, measurement of the qubit state, and conditional\nfeedback. We show that the heat extracted from the bath at temperature $T$ can\nideally approach the Landauer limit of $k_BT\\ln 2$ per cycle even in the\nquantum regime. Practical demon efficiency is limited by the interplay of\nLandau-Zener transitions and coupling to the bath. We suggest that an\nexperimental demonstration of the demon is fully feasible using one of the\nstandard superconducting qubits.\n", "  The boundary conditions for the ideal MHD equations on a plane dis-\ncontinuity surface are investigated. It is shown that, for a given mass flux\nthrough a discontinuity, its type depends only on the relation between inclina-\ntion angles of a magnetic field. Moreover, the conservation laws on a surface\nof discontinuity allow changing a discontinuity type with gradual (continu-\nous) changes in the conditions of plasma flow. Then there are the so-called\ntransition solutions that satisfy simultaneously two types of discontinuities.\nWe obtain all transition solutions on the basis of the complete system of\nboundary conditions for the MHD equations. We also found the expression\ndescribing a jump of internal energy of the plasma flowing through the dis-\ncontinuity. Firstly, this allows constructing a generalized scheme of possible\ncontinuous transitions between MHD discontinuities. Secondly, it enables the\nexamination of the dependence of plasma heating by plasma density and\nconfiguration of the magnetic field near the discontinuity surface, i.e., by\nthe type of the MHD discontinuity. It is shown that the best conditions for\nheating are carried out in the vicinity of a reconnecting current layer near\nthe areas of reverse currents. The result can be helpful in explaining the\ntemperature distributions inside the active regions in the solar corona during\nflares observed by modern space observatories in soft and hard X-rays.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied the quantum transmission characteristics of\none-dimensional photonic crystal with and without defect layer by the quantum\ntheory approach, and compared the calculation results of classical with quantum\ntheory. We have found some new quantum effects in the one-dimensional photonic\ncrystal. When the incident angle $\\theta=0$, there is no quantum effect. When\nthe incident angle $\\theta\\neq0$, we find there are obvious quantum effect with\nthe incident angle increase. At the incident angle $\\theta\\neq0$, there are\nalso quantum effect with the change of thickness and refractive indexes of\nmedium $B$ or $A$. We think the new quantum effect of photonic crystal shall\nhelp us to design optical devices.\n", "  Spin-orbit spin transfer torque allows an efficient control of magnetization\nby an in-plane current. Recent experiments found that the spin-orbit torque has\nstrong dependence on the magnetization angle [Garello et al., Nature\nNanotechnol. 8, 587 (2013); Qiu et al., Sci. Rep. 4, 4491 (2014)]. We\ntheoretically investigate magnetization switching and domain wall motion in a\nperpendicularly magnetized layer, induced by angle-dependent spin-orbit torque.\nWe obtain analytic expressions of the switching current and domain wall\nvelocity, in agreement with numerical results. Based on the expressions, we\nfind that the spin-orbit torque increasing with the polar angle of\nmagnetization is beneficial for both switching and domain wall motion. Our\nresult will serve as a guideline to design and interpret switching and domain\nwall experiments based on spin-orbit torque.\n", "  In this paper we proceed to study the high energy behavior of a scattering\namplitudes in the Yang-Mills theory with the Higgs mechanism for the gauge\nboson mass. The spectrum of the $j$-plane singularities of the $t$-channel\npartial waves, and corresponding eigenfunctions of the BFKL equation in leading\nlog approximation (LLA), were previously calculated by us numerically in\narXiv:1401.4671 . Here we develop a semiclassical approach and investigate the\ninfluence of the impact parameter exponential decrease, existing in this model,\non the high energy asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitude. This\napproach is much simpler than the numerical calculations, and reproduces our\nearlier numerical results. The analytical (semianalytical) solutions which have\nbeen found in this paper, can be used to incorporate correctly the large impact\nparameter behavior in the framework of CGC/saturation approach. This behaviour\nis interesting as provides the high energy amplitude for the electroweak\ntheory, which can be measured experimentally.\n", "  Cross sections for top quarks provide very interesting physics opportunities,\nbeing both sensitive to new physics and also perturbatively tractable due to\nthe large top quark mass. Rigorous factorization theorems for top cross\nsections can be derived in several kinematic scenarios, including the boosted\nregime in the peak region that we consider here. In the context of the\ncorresponding factorization theorem for $e^+e^-$ collisions we extract the last\nmissing ingredient that is needed to evaluate the cross section differential in\nthe jet-mass at two-loop order, namely the matching coefficient at the scale\n$\\mu\\simeq m_t$. Our extraction also yields the final ingredients needed to\ncarry out logarithmic resummation at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order\n(or N$^3$LL if we ignore the missing 4-loop cusp anomalous dimension). This\ncoefficient exhibits an amplitude level rapidity logarithm starting at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ due to virtual top quark loops, which we treat using\nrapidity renormalization group (RG) evolution. Interestingly, this rapidity RG\nevolution appears in the matching coefficient between two effective theories\naround the heavy quark mass scale $\\mu\\simeq m_t$.\n", "  The apparent unification of gauge couplings in Grand Unified Theories around\n10$^{16}$ GeV is one of the strong arguments in favor of Supersymmetric\nextensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, an analysis of the\nmeasurements of the strong coupling running from the CMS experiment at the LHC\nis combined with a \"traditional\" gauge coupling unification analysis using data\nat the Z peak. This approach places powerful constraints on the possible scales\nof new physics and on the parameters around the unification scale. A\nsupersymmetric analysis without GUT threshold corrections describes the CMS\ndata well and provides perfect unification. The favored scales are $M_{SUSY}\\\n=\\ 2820\\ +670\\ -540$ GeV and $M_{GUT}\\ =\\ 1.05 \\pm 0.06 \\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV. For\nzero or small threshold corrections the scale of new physics may be well within\nLHC reach.\n", "  We investigate numerically the clustering behavior of a system of phase\noscillators with positive and negative couplings under a periodic external\ndriving field with a bimodal distribution of driving phases. The phase\ndistribution and the mean speed of the traveling state, as well as the order\nparameter for synchronization, are computed as the driving amplitude is varied.\nWe observe that the periodically-driven system can also host traveling states\nfor parameters in the same range as those for the case of a system without a\ndriving field. The traveling speed is found to depend non-monotonically on the\ndriving amplitude. In particular, oscillators divide into four clusters and\nmove in pairs. Further, depending on the driving amplitude, two kinds of\ntraveling mode arise: pairs of clusters traveling in the same direction\n(symmetric mode) and in opposite directions (antisymmetric mode). In the latter\ncase (antisymmetric traveling mode), the average phase speed of the whole\nsystem apparently vanishes. A phenomenological argument for such behavior is\ngiven.\n", "  We consider the fluctuations of a time-integrated particle current around an\natypical value in a generic stochastic Markov process involving classical\nparticles with two-site interaction and hardcore repulsion on a finite\none-dimensional lattice with open boundaries. We address the question of which\ninteractions one has to impose on such process to make the atypical value of\nthe current typical. It is known that a corresponding effective stochastic\nMarkov process might exist whose typical value of the current is equal to the\natypical value of the current in the original process within a\ntime-translational invariant regime. This effective process has, in principle,\nnon-local transition rates. Nevertheless, it turns out that under some\nconditions the stochastic generator of the effective process has the same\ndynamical rules as the stochastic generator of the original process. We find\nthese conditions and show that our approach can be generalized to any\ntime-integrated observable.\n", "  We show that harmonic vibrations in amorphous silicon can be decomposed to\ntransverse and longitudinal components in all frequency range even in the\nabsence of the well defined wave vector ${\\bf q}$. For this purpose we define\nthe transverse component of the eigenvector with given $\\omega$ as a component,\nwhich does not change the volumes of Voronoi cells around atoms. The\nlongitudinal component is the remaining orthogonal component. We have found the\nlongitudinal and transverse components of the vibrational density of states for\nnumerical model of amorphous silicon. The vibrations are mostly transverse\nbelow 7 THz and above 15 THz. In the frequency interval in between the\nvibrations have a longitudinal nature. Just this sudden transformation of\nvibrations at 7 THz from almost transverse to almost longitudinal ones explains\nthe prominent peak in the diffusivity of the amorphous silicon just above 7\nTHz.\n", "  We analyze the effective $g^*$ factors and their dependence on the\norientation of the external magnetic field for a quantum point contact defined\nin the two-dimensional electron gas. The paper simulates the experimental\nprocedure for evaluation of the effective Land\\'e factors from the\ntransconductance of a biased device in external magnetic field. The\ncontributions of the orbital effects of the magnetic field, the\nelectron-electron interaction and spin-orbit (SO) coupling are studied. The\nanisotropy of the $g^*$ factors for the in-plane magnetic field orientation,\nwhich seems counterintuitive from the perspective of the effective SO magnetic\nfield, is explained in an analytical model of the constriction as due to the\nSO-induced subband mixing. The asymmetry of the transconductance as a function\nof the gate voltage is obtained in agreement with the experimental data and the\nresults are explained as due to the depletion of the electron gas within the\nquantum point contact constriction and the related reduction of the screening\nas described within the DFT approach. The results for transconductance and the\n$g^*$ factors are in a good agreement with the experimental data [Phys. Rev. B\n{\\bf 81}, 041303, 2010].\n", "  Clarifying the locality properties of higher-spin gravity is a pressing task,\nbut notoriously difficult due to the absence of a weakly-coupled flat regime.\nThe simplest non-trivial case where this question can be addressed is the\nquartic self-interaction of the AdS scalar field present in the higher-spin\nmultiplet. We investigate this issue in the context of the holographic duality\nbetween the minimal bosonic higher-spin theory on AdS$_4$ and the free\n$O\\left(N\\right)$ vector model in three dimensions. In particular, we determine\nthe exact explicit form of the derivative expansion of the bulk scalar quartic\nvertex. The quartic vertex is obtained from the field theory four-point\nfunction of the operator dual to the bulk scalar, by making use of our previous\nresults for the Witten diagrams of higher-spin exchanges. This is facilitated\nby establishing the conformal block expansions of both the boundary four-point\nfunction and the dual bulk Witten diagram amplitudes. We show that the vertex\nwe find satisfies a generalised notion of locality.\n", "  We calculate the two-loop correction to the dispersion relation for\nworldsheet modes of the BMN string in AdS(n) x S(n) x T(10-2n) for n=2,3,5. For\nthe massive modes the result agrees with the exact dispersion relation derived\nfrom symmetry considerations with no correction to the interpolating function\nh. For the massless modes in AdS(3) x S(3) x T(4) however our result does not\nmatch what one expects from the corresponding symmetry based analysis. We also\nderive the S-matrix for massless modes up to the one-loop order. The scattering\nphase is given by the massless limit of the Hernandez-Lopez phase. In addition\nwe compute a certain massless S-matrix element at two loops and show that it\nvanishes suggesting that the two-loop phase in the massless sector is zero.\n", "  High angular resolution spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) has revealed a remarkable population of galaxies hosting dwarf Seyfert\nnuclei with an unusually large broad-line region (BLR). These objects are\nremarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the size of the BLR can, in some cases,\nrival those seen in the most luminous quasars. Secondly, the size of the BLR is\nnot correlated with the central continuum luminosity, an observation that\ndistinguishes them from their reverberating counterparts. Collectively, these\nearly results suggest that non-reverberating dwarf Seyferts are a heterogeneous\ngroup and not simply scaled versions of each other. Careful inspection reveals\nbroad H Balmer emission lines with single peaks, double peaks, and a\ncombination of the two, suggesting that the broad emission lines are produced\nin kinematically distinct regions centered on the black hole (BH). Because the\ngravitational field strength is already known for these objects, by virtue of\nknowing their BH mass, the relationship between velocity and radius may be\nestablished, given a kinematic model for the BLR gas. In this way, one can\ndetermine the inner and outer radii of the BLRs by modeling the shape of their\nbroad emission line profiles. In the present contribution, high quality spectra\nobtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) are used to\nconstrain the size of the BLR in the dwarf Seyfert nuclei of M81, NGC 3998, NGC\n4203, NGC 3227, NGC 4051, and NGC 3516.\n", "  Wire-grid polarisers are versatile and scalable components which can be\nengineered to achieve small sizes and extremely high extinction ratios. Yet the\nmeasured performances are always significantly below the predicted values\nobtained from numerical simulations. Here we report on a detailed comparison\nbetween theoretical and experimental performances. We show that the discrepancy\ncan be explained by the true shape of the plasmonic structures. Taking into\naccount the fabrication details, a new optimisation model enables us to achieve\nexcellent agreement with the observed response and to re-optimise the grating\nparameters to ensure experimental extinction ratios well above 1,000 at 850 nm.\n", "  An effective field model is introduced here within the micromagnetics\nformulation, to study roughness in magnetic structures, by considering\nsub-exchange length roughness levels as a perturbation on a smooth structure.\nThis allows the roughness contribution to be separated, which is found to give\nrise to an effective configurational anisotropy for both edge and surface\nroughness, and accurately model its effects with fine control over the\nroughness depth without the explicit need to refine the computational cellsize\nto accommodate the roughness profile. The model is validated by comparisons\nwith directly roughened structures for a series of magnetization switching and\ndomain wall mobility simulations and found to be in excellent agreement for\nroughness levels up to the exchange length. The model is further applied to\nvortex domain wall mobility simulations with surface roughness, which is shown\nto significantly modify domain wall movement and result in dynamic pinning and\nstochastic creep effects.\n", "  We demonstrate Feshbach optimized photoassociation (FOPA) into the $0_{g}^{-}\n(5$S$_{1/2}+5$P$_{1/2}$) state in $^{85}$Rb$_{2}$. FOPA uses the enhancement of\nthe amplitude of the initial atomic scattering wave function due to a Feshbach\nresonance to increase the molecular formation rate from photoassociation. We\nobserve three vibrational levels, $v=$127, 140, and 150, with previously\nunmeasured binding energies of 256, 154, and 96 cm$^{-1}$. We measure the\nfrequency, central magnetic field position, and magnetic field width of each\nFeshbach resonance. Our findings experimentally confirm that this technique can\nmeasure vibrational levels lower than those accessible to traditional\nphotoassociative spectroscopy.\n", "  In this work we investigate the entropic information-measure in the context\nof braneworlds with non-constant curvature. The braneworld entropic information\nis studied for gravity modified by the squared of the Ricci scalar, besides the\nusual Einstein-Hilbert term. We showed that the minimum value of the brane\nconfigurational entropy provides a stricter bound on the parameter that is\nresponsible for the $F(R)$ model to differ from the Einstein-Hilbert standard\none. Our results are moreover consistent to a negative bulk cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  We describe the features of magnonic crystals based upon antiferromagnetic\nelements. Our main results are that with a periodic modulation of either\nmagnetic fields or system characteristics, such as the anisotropy, it is\npossible to tailor the spin wave spectra of antiferromagnetic systems into a\nband-like organization that displays a segregation of allowed and forbidden\nbands. The main features of the band structure, such as bandwidths and\nbandgaps, can be readily manipulated. Our results provide a natural link\nbetween two steadily growing fields of spintronics: antiferromagnetic\nspintronics and magnonics.\n", "  We study conditions for formation of recollimation shocks in jets interacting\nwith stellar winds in high-mass X-ray binaries. We show the existence of a\ncritical jet power, dependent on the wind rate and velocity and the jet\nvelocity, above which a recollimation shock is not formed. For jet powers below\ncritical, we derive the location of the shock. We show that surface shocks may\nstill exist above the critical power, but only occupy a small volume of the jet\nand do not significantly alter the jet opening angle. We test these prediction\nby 3-D numerical simulations, which confirm the existence and the value of the\ncritical power. We apply our results to Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3.\n", "  We present results from a numerical solution of the next-to-leading order\n(NLO) Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation in coordinate space in the large Nc\nlimit. We show that the solution is not stable for initial conditions that are\nclose to those used in phenomenological applications of the leading order\nequation. We identify the problematic terms in the NLO kernel as being related\nto large logarithms of a small parent dipole size, and also show that rewriting\nthe equation in terms of the \"conformal dipole\" does not remove the problem.\nOur results qualitatively agree with expectations based on the behavior of the\nlinear NLO BFKL equation.\n", "  We discuss the eight independent spin observables for the $W$ boson in terms\nof its vector and tensor polarizations and identify the angular distributions\nand asymmetries able to separate them in collider experiments. The results are\napplied to the study of polarized top quark decays and diboson resonances.\nThese novel observables are of great value for disentangling new physics\nmechanisms in $W$ boson production.\n", "  The potential of optimum selection of modulation and forward error correction\n(FEC) overhead (OH) in future transparent nonlinear optical mesh networks is\nstudied from an information theory perspective. Different network topologies\nare studied as well as both ideal soft-decision (SD) and hard-decision (HD) FEC\nbased on demap-and-decode (bit-wise) receivers. When compared to the de-facto\nQPSK with 7% OH, our results show large gains in network throughput. When\ncompared to SD-FEC, HD-FEC is shown to cause network throughput losses of 12%,\n15%, and 20% for a country, continental, and global network topology,\nrespectively. Furthermore, it is shown that most of the theoretically possible\ngains can be achieved by using one modulation format and only two OHs. This is\nin contrast to the infinite number of OHs required in the ideal case. The\nobtained optimal OHs are between 5% and 80%, which highlights the potential\nadvantage of using FEC with high OHs.\n", "  Accurate three dimensional reconstructions of atomic positions, and full\nquantification of the information contained in atom probe tomography data\nrelies on understanding the physical processes taking place during field\nevaporation of atoms from needle-shaped specimens. However, the modeling\nframework for atom probe tomography has remained qualitative at best. Building\non the continuum field models previously developed, we introduce a more\nphysical approach with the selection of evaporation events based on density\nfunctional theory calculations. This new model reproduces key features observed\nexperimentally in terms of sequence of evaporation, desorption maps, and depth\nresolution, and provides insights into the physical limit for spatial\nresolution.\n", "  Black holes are found to exist in gravitational theories with the presence of\nquadratic curvature terms and behave differently from the Schwarzschild\nsolution. We present an exhaustive analysis for determining the quasinormal\nmodes of a test scalar field propagating in a new class of black hole\nbackgrounds in the case of pure Einstein-Weyl gravity. Our result shows that\nthe field decay of quasinormal modes in such a non-Schwarzschild black hole\nbehaves similarly to the Schwarzschild one, but the decay slope becomes much\nsmoother due to the appearance of the Weyl tensor square in the background\ntheory. We also analyze the frequencies of the quasinormal modes in order to\ncharacterize the properties of new back holes, and thus, if these modes can be\nthe source of gravitational waves, the underlying theories may be testable in\nfuture gravitational wave experiments. We briefly comment on the issue of\nquantum (in)stability in this theory at linear order.\n", "  An outstanding challenge of theoretical electronic structure is the\ndescription of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in molecules and solids.\nRenewed interest in resolving this is in part motivated by the technological\npromise of layered systems including graphite, transition metal\ndichalcogenides, and more recently, black phosphorus, in which the interlayer\ninteraction is widely believed to be dominated by these types of forces. We\nreport a series of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations for bulk black\nphosphorus and related few-layer phosphorene, which elucidate the nature of the\nforces that bind these systems and provide benchmark data for the energetics of\nthese systems. We find a significant charge redistribution due to the\ninteraction between electrons on adjacent layers. Comparison to density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations indicate not only wide variability even\namong different vdW corrected functionals, but the failure of these functionals\nto capture the trend of reorganization predicted by QMC. The delicate interplay\nof steric and dispersive forces between layers indicate that few-layer\nphosphorene presents an unexpected challenge for the development of vdW\ncorrected DFT.\n", "  Three kinds of identities involving non-commutating operators and Euler and\nBernoulli polynomials are studied. The first identity, as given by Bender and\nBettencourt, expresses the nested commutator of the Hamiltonian and momentum\noperators as the commutator of the momentum and the shifted Euler polynomial of\nthe Hamiltonian. The second one, due to J.-C. Pain, links the commutators and\nanti-commutators of the monomials of the position and momentum operators. The\nthird appears in a work by Figuieira de Morisson and Fring in the context of\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. In each case, we provide several proofs and\nextensions of these identities that highlight the role of Euler and Bernoulli\npolynomials.\n", "  We consider baryogenesis in a model which has a CP invariant Lagrangian, CP\ninvariant initial conditions and does not spontaneously break CP at any of the\nminima. We utilize the fact that tunneling processes between CP invariant\nminima can break CP to implement baryogenesis. CP invariance requires the\npresence of two tunneling processes with opposite CP breaking phases and equal\nprobability of occurring. In order for the entire visible universe to see the\nsame CP violating phase, we consider a model where the field doing the\ntunneling is the inflaton.\n", "  Solar active region (AR) 11283 is a very magnetically complex region and it\nhas produced many eruptions. However, there exists a non-eruptive filament in\nthe plage region just next to an eruptive one in the AR, which gives us an\nopportunity to perform a comparison analysis of these two filaments. The\ncoronal magnetic field extrapolated using a CESE-MHD-NLFFF code (Jiang & Feng\n2013) reveals that two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) exist in the same\nextrapolation box supporting these two filaments, respectively. Analysis of the\nmagnetic field shows that the eruptive MFR contains a bald-patch separatrix\nsurface (BPSS) co-spatial very well with a pre-eruptive EUV sigmoid, which is\nconsistent with the BPSS model for coronal sigmoids. The magnetic dips of the\nnon-eruptive MFRs match H{\\alpha} observation of the non-eruptive filament\nstrikingly well, which strongly supports the MFR-dip model for filaments.\nCompared with the non-eruptive MFR/filament (with a length of about 200 Mm),\nthe eruptive MFR/filament is much smaller (with a length of about 20 Mm), but\nit contains most of the magnetic free energy in the extrapolation box and holds\na much higher free energy density than the non-eruptive one. Both the MFRs are\nweakly twisted and cannot trigger kink instability. The AR eruptive MFR is\nunstable because its axis reaches above a critical height for torus\ninstability, at which the overlying closed arcades can no longer confine the\nMFR stably. On the contrary, the quiescent MFR is very firmly held by its\noverlying field, as its axis apex is far below the torus-instability threshold\nheight. Overall, this comparison investigation supports that MFR can exist\nprior to eruption and the ideal MHD instability can trigger MFR eruption.\n", "  This talk discusses recent progress in some topics relevant for deep\ninelastic scattering at small x. We discuss first differences and similarities\nbetween conventional collinear factorization and the dipole picture of deep\ninelastic scattering. Many of the recent theoretical advances at small x are\nrelated to taking calculations in the nonlinear saturation regime to\nnext-to-leading order accuracy in the QCD coupling. On the experimental side\nsignificant recent progress has been made in exclusive and diffractive\nprocesses, in particular in ultraperipheral nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n", "  In the framework of the QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) we present the\nanalysis of all $B, B_{s}\\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ and $D, D_{s}\\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$\nform factors ($f^+, f^0$ and $f^T$) by including $m_{\\eta^{(\\prime)}}^2$\ncorrections in the leading (up to the twist-four) and next-to-leading order (up\nto the twist-three) in QCD, and two-gluon contributions to the form factors at\nthe leading twist. The SU(3)-flavour breaking corrections and the axial anomaly\ncontributions to the distribution amplitudes are also consistently taken into\naccount. The complete results for the $f^0$ and $f^T$ form factors of $B,B_s\n\\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ and $D, D_{s} \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ relevant for processes\nlike $B \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$ or $B_{s} \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} l^+\nl^-$ are given for the first time, as well as the two-gluon contribution to the\ntensor form factors. The values obtained for the $f^+$ form factors are as\nfollows: $f^+_{B\\eta}(0)= 0.168^{+0.042}_{-0.047}$, $|f^+_{B_s\\eta}(0)|=\n0.212^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$, $f^+_{B\\eta^\\prime}(0)= 0.130^{+0.036}_{-0.032}$,\n$f^+_{B_s\\eta^\\prime}(0)= 0.252^{+0.023}_{-0.020}$ and $f^+_{D\\eta}(0)=\n0.429^{+0.165}_{-0.141}$, $|f^+_{D_s\\eta}(0)|= 0.495^{+0.030}_{-0.029}$,\n$f^+_{D\\eta^\\prime}(0)= 0.292^{+0.113}_{-0.104}$, $f^+_{D_s\\eta^\\prime}(0)=\n0.558^{+0.047}_{-0.045}$. Also phenomenological predictions for semileptonic\n$B, B_{s}\\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ and $D, D_{s}\\to \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ decay modes are\ngiven.\n", "  Gauge-invariant twistor variables are found for the massive spinning particle\nwith N-extended local worldline supersymmetry, in spacetime dimensions D=3,4,6.\nThe twistor action is manifestly Lorentz invariant but the anticommuting spin\nvariables appear exactly as in the non-relativistic limit. This allows a simple\nconfirmation that the quantum N=2 spinning particle has either spin one or spin\nzero, and that N>2 is quantum inconsistent for D=4,6.\n", "  We study unconstrained control of a two-level quantum system and analyse\ncritical points of the objective functional which represents quantum average of\nsystem observable at some final time $T$. In Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 285,\n233-240 (2014) it was shown that all maxima and minima of the objective\nfunctional are global if $T\\ge \\pi$ (in suitable units). In the present work we\nshow that all maxima and minima are global as soon as $T\\ge \\pi/2$. Hence we\nreduce by the factor of two the minimal time for which traps, i.e., local but\nnot global maxima or minima of the objective functional, do not exist.\n", "  Motivated by recent intensive experimental efforts on searching for\nneutrinoless double-beta decays, we perform a detailed analysis of the physics\npotential of the experiments based on $^{76}\\mathrm{Ge}$. Assuming no signals,\ncurrent and future experiments could place a $90\\%$ lower limit on the half\nlife $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2} \\gtrsim 4\\times 10^{26}~{\\rm yr}$ and $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}\n\\gtrsim 7\\times 10^{27}~{\\rm yr}$, respectively. Then, how to report an\nevidence for neutrinoless double-beta decays is addressed by following the\nBayesian statistical approach. For the first time, we present a quantitative\ndescription of experimental power to distinguish between normal and inverted\nneutrino mass orderings. Taking an exposure of $10^{4}~{\\rm kg}\\cdot{\\rm yr}$\nand a background rate of $10^{-4}~{\\rm counts}/({\\rm keV}\\cdot{\\rm kg}\\cdot{\\rm\nyr})$, we find that a moderate evidence for normal neutrino mass ordering\n(i.e., with a Bayes factor ${\\cal B}$ given by $\\ln({\\cal B}) \\simeq 2.5$ or a\nprobability about $92.3\\%$ according to the Jeffreys scale) can be achieved if\nthe true value of effective neutrino mass $m^{}_{\\beta\\beta}$ turns out to be\nbelow $0.01~{\\rm eV}$.\n", "  Recent literature has seen an ongoing discussion on the limiting mass of\nstrongly magnetized white dwarfs, since such objects may prove to be a source\nof over-luminous type-Ia supernovae. In an earlier paper, we have presented the\nmass-radius relation of white dwarfs with a strong poloidal magnetic field in\nNewtonian gravity. The inclusion of effects such as general relativistic\ngravity and many-body corrections to the equation of state can alter the\nmass-radius relation and the maximum mass. In this work we estimate the extent\nto which these effects may modify the earlier results. We find that the general\nrelativistic effects tend to reduce the maximum mass by about 2% and many-body\ncorrections by another additional $\\sim$2%, for an assumed carbon composition.\nWe also explore field geometries that are purely toroidal or a mixture of\npoloidal and toroidal and find that the limiting mass of such equilibrium\nconfigurations can be substantially higher than in the case of a purely\npoloidal field.\n", "  latfield2 is a C++ library designed to simplify writing parallel codes for\nsolving partial differen- tial equations, developed for application to\nclassical field theories in particle physics and cosmology. It is a significant\nrewrite of the latfield framework, moving from a slab domain decomposition to a\nrod decomposition, where the last two dimension of the lattice are scattered\ninto a two dimensional process grid. Parallelism is implemented using the\nMessage Passing Interface (MPI) standard, and hidden in the basic objects of\ngrid-based simulations: Lattice, Site and Field. It comes with an integrated\nparallel fast Fourier transform, and I/O server class permitting computation to\ncontinue during the writing of large files to disk. latfield2 has been used for\nproduction runs on tens of thousands of processor elements, and is expected to\nbe scalable to hundreds of thousands.\n", "  When a relativistically intense linearly polarized laser pulse is incident on\nan overdense plasma, a dense electron layer is formed on the plasma edge which\nrelativistic motion results in high harmonic generation, ion acceleration and\nincoherent synchrotron emission of gamma-photons. Here we present a\nself-consistent analytical model that describes the edge motion and apply it to\nthe problem of incoherent synchrotron emission by ultrarelativistic plasma\nelectrons. The model takes into account both coherent radiation reaction from\nhigh harmonics and incoherent radiation reaction in the Landau-Lifshitz form.\nThe analytical results are in agreement with 3D particle-in-cell simulations in\na certain parameter region that corresponds to the relativistic electronic\nspring interaction regime.\n", "  The GERDA experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS)\nsearches for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76-Ge. In view of the GERDA\nPhase II data collection, four new 228-Th radioactive sources for the\ncalibration of the germanium detectors enriched in 76-Ge have been produced\nwith a new technique, leading to a reduced neutron flux from ( alpha; n )\nreactions. The gamma activities of the sources were determined with a total\nuncertainty of 4 percent using an ultra-low background HPGe detector operated\nunderground at LNGS. The emitted neutron flux was determined using a low\nbackground LiI(Eu) detector and a 3-He counter at LNGS. In both cases, a\nreduction of about one order of magnitude with respect to commercially\navailable 228-Th sources was obtained. Additionally, a specific leak test with\na sensitivity to leaks down to 10 mBq was developed to investigate the\ntightness of the stainless steel capsules housing the sources after their use\nin cryogenic environment.\n", "  A universal secondary relaxation process, known as the Johari-Goldstein (JG)\n$\\beta$-relaxation process, appears in glass formers. It involves all parts of\nthe molecule and is particularly important in glassy systems because of its\nvery close relationship with the $\\alpha$-relaxation process. However, the\nabsence of a J-G $\\beta$-relaxation mode in colloidal glasses raises questions\nregarding its universality. In the present work, we study the microscopic\nrelaxation processes in Laponite suspensions, a model soft glassy material, by\ndynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-relaxation\ntimescales are estimated from the autocorrelation functions obtained by DLS\nmeasurements for Laponite suspensions with different concentrations, salt\nconcentrations and temperatures. Our experimental results suggest that the\n$\\beta$-relaxation process in Laponite suspensions involves all parts of the\nconstituent Laponite particle. The ergodicity breaking time is also seen to be\ncorrelated with the characteristic time of the $\\beta$-relaxation process for\nall Laponite concentrations, salt concentrations and temperatures. The width of\nthe primary relaxation process is observed to be correlated with the secondary\nrelaxation time. The secondary relaxation time is also very sensitive to the\nconcentration of Laponite. We measure primitive relaxation timescales from the\n$\\alpha$-relaxation time and the stretching exponent ($\\beta$) by applying the\ncoupling model for highly correlated systems. The order of magnitude of the\nprimitive relaxation time is very close to the secondary relaxation time. These\nobservations indicate the presence of a J-G $\\beta$-relaxation mode for soft\ncolloidal suspensions of Laponite.\n", "  A search for the flavour-changing neutral-current decay $t\\to qZ$ is\npresented. Data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2012 from proton-proton\ncollisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$,\nare analysed. Top-quark pair-production events with one top quark decaying\nthrough the $t\\to qZ$ ($q=u,c$) channel and the other through the dominant\nStandard Model mode $t\\to bW$ are considered as signal. Only the decays of the\n$Z$ boson to charged leptons and leptonic $W$ boson decays are used. No\nevidence for a signal is found and an observed (expected) upper limit on the\n$t\\to qZ$ branching ratio of $7\\times 10^{-4}$ ($8\\times 10^{-4}$) is set at\nthe 95% confidence level.\n", "  We use the recently derived density of states for a particle confined to a\nspherical well in three dimensional fuzzy space to compute the thermodynamics\nof a gas of non-interacting fermions confined to such a well. Special emphasis\nis placed on non-commutative effects and in particular non-commutative\ncorrections to the thermodynamics at low densities and temperatures are\ncomputed where the non-relativistic approximation used here is valid.\nNon-commutative effects at high densities are also identified, the most\nprominent being the existence of a minimal volume at which the gas becomes\nincompressible. The latter is closely related to a low/high density duality\nexhibited by these systems, which in turn is a manifestation of an\ninfra-red/ultra violet duality in the single particle spectrum. Both\nnon-rotating and slowly rotating gasses are studied. Approximations are\nbenchmarked against exact numerical computations for the non-rotating case and\nseveral other properties of the gas are demonstrated with numerical\ncomputations. Finally, a non-commutative gas confined by gravity is studied and\nseveral novel features regarding the mass-radius relation, density and entropy\nare highlighted.\n", "  The exponential of an NxN matrix can always be expressed as a matrix\npolynomial of order N-1. In particular, a general group element for the\nfundamental representation of SU(N) can be expressed as a matrix polynomial of\norder N-1 in a traceless NxN hermitian generating matrix, with polynomial\ncoefficients consisting of elementary trigonometric functions dependent on N-2\ninvariants in addition to the group parameter. These invariants are just angles\ndetermined by the direction of a real N-vector whose components are the\neigenvalues of the hermitian matrix. Equivalently, the eigenvalues are given by\nprojecting the vertices of an (N-1)-simplex onto a particular axis passing\nthrough the center of the simplex. The orientation of the simplex relative to\nthis axis determines the angular invariants and hence the real eigenvalues of\nthe matrix.\n", "  Electronic image states around segmented carbon nanotubes can be confined and\nshaped along the nanotube axis by engineering the image potential. We show how\nseveral such image states can be prepared simultaneously along the same\nnanotube. The inter-electronic distance can be controlled a priori by\nengineering tubes of specific geometries. High sensitivity to external electric\nand magnetic fields can be exploited to manipulate these states and their\nmutual long-range interactions. These building blocks provide access to a new\nkind of tailored interacting quantum systems.\n", "  In light filamentation induced by axicon-generated, powerful Bessel beams,\nthe spatial propagation dynamics in the nonlinear medium determines the\ngeometry of the filament channel and hence its potential applications. We show\nthat the observed steady and unsteady Bessel beam propagation regimes can be\nunderstood in a unified way from the existence of an attractor and its\nstability properties. The attractor is identified as the nonlinear unbalanced\nBessel beam (NL-UBB) whose inward H\\\"ankel beam amplitude equals the amplitude\nof the linear Bessel beam that the axicon would generate in linear propagation.\nA simple analytical formula that determines de NL-UBB attractor is given.\nSteady or unsteady propagation depends on whether the attracting NL-UBB has a\nsmall, exponentially growing, unstable mode. In case of unsteady propagation,\nperiodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic dynamics after the axicon reproduces\nsimilar dynamics after the development of the small unstable mode into the\nlarge perturbation regime.\n", "  We interpret the 2 TeV excesses at the LHC in a left-right symmetric model\nwith Higgs doublets and spontaneous $D$-parity violation. The light neutrino\nmasses are understood via a linear seesaw, suppressed by a high $D$-parity\nbreaking scale, and the heavy neutrinos have a pseudo-Dirac character. In\naddition, with a suppressed right-handed gauge coupling $g_R / g_L \\approx 0.6$\nin an $SO(10)$ embedding, we can thereby interpret the observed $eejj$ excess\nat CMS. We show that it can be reconciled with the diboson and dijet excesses\nwithin a simplified scenario based on our model. Moreover, we find that the\nmixing between the light and heavy neutrinos can be potentially large which\nwould induce dominant non-standard contributions to neutrinoless double beta\ndecay via long-range $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ neutrino exchange.\n", "  We use a numerical method, the finite-mode approach, to study inhomogeneous\ncondensation in effective models for QCD in a general framework. Former\nlimitations of considering a specific ansatz for the spatial dependence of the\ncondensate are overcome. Different error sources are analyzed and strategies to\nminimize or eliminate them are outlined. The analytically known results for\n$1+1$ dimensional models (such as the Gross-Neveu model and extensions of it)\nare correctly reproduced using the finite-mode approach. Moreover, the NJL\nmodel in $3+1$ dimensions is investigated and its phase diagram is determined\nwith particular focus on the inhomogeneous phase at high density.\n", "  Integral field spectrographs are an important technology for exoplanet\nimaging, due to their ability to take spectra in a high-contrast environment,\nand improve planet detection sensitivity through spectral differential imaging.\nALES is the first integral field spectrograph capable of imaging exoplanets\nfrom 3-5$\\mu$m, and will extend our ability to characterize self-luminous\nexoplanets into a wavelength range where they peak in brightness. ALES is\ninstalled inside LBTI/LMIRcam on the Large Binocular Telescope, taking\nadvantage of existing AO systems, camera optics, and a HAWAII-2RG detector. The\nnew optics that comprise ALES are a Keplerian magnifier, a silicon lenslet\narray with diffraction suppressing pinholes, a direct vision prism, and\ncalibration optics. All of these components are installed in filter wheels\nmaking ALES a completely modular design. ALES saw first light at the LBT in\nJune 2015.\n", "  We study predictions of orbifold family unification models with $SU(9)$ gauge\ngroup on a six-dimensional space-time including the orbifold $T^2/Z_2$, and\nobtain relations among sfermion masses in the supersymmetric extension of\nmodels. The models have an excellent feature that just three families of the\nstandard model fermions exist in a pair of Weyl fermions in the $[9, 3]$\nrepresentation as four-dimensional zero modes, without accompanying any mirror\nparticles.\n", "  We study and realize asymmetric fiber-based cavities with optimized mode\nmatch to achieve high reflectivity on resonance. This is especially important\nfor mutually coupling two physical systems via light fields, e.g. in quantum\nhybrid systems. Our detailed theoretical and experimental analysis reveals that\non resonance the interference effect between the directly reflected\nnon-modematched light and the light leaking back out of the cavity can lead to\nlarge unexpected losses due to the mode filtering of the incoupling fiber.\nStrong restrictions for the cavity design result out of this effect and we show\nthat planar-concave cavities are clearly best suited. We validate our\nanalytical model using numerical calculations and demonstrate an experimental\nrealization of an asymmetric fiber Fabry-P\\'erot cavity with optimized\nparameters.\n", "  In this paper, we study interacting extended Chaplygin gas as dark matter and\nquintessence scalar field as dark energy with an effective $\\Lambda$-term in\nLyra manifold. As we know Chaplygin gas behaves as dark matter at the early\nuniverse while cosmological constant at the late time. Modified field equations\nare given and motivation of the phenomenological models discussed in details.\nFour different models based on the interaction term are investigated in this\nwork. Then, we consider other models where Extended Chaplygin gas and\nquintessence field play role of dark matter and dark energy respectively with\ntwo different forms of interaction between the extended Chaplygin gas and\nquintessence scalar field for both constant and varying $\\Lambda$. Concerning\nto the mathematical hardness of the problems we discuss results numerically and\ngraphically. Obtained results give us hope that proposed models can work as\ngood models for the early universe with later stage of evolution containing\naccelerated expansion.\n", "  The ExTrA facility, located at La Silla observatory, will consist of a\nnear-infrared multi-object spectrograph fed by three 60-cm telescopes. ExTrA\nwill add the spectroscopic resolution to the traditional differential\nphotometry method. This shall enable the fine correction of color-dependent\nsystematics that would otherwise hinder ground-based observations. With both\nthis novel method and an infrared-enabled efficiency, ExTrA aims to find\ntransiting telluric planets orbiting in the habitable zone of bright nearby M\ndwarfs. It shall have the versatility to do so by running its own independent\nsurvey and also by concurrently following-up on the space candidates unveiled\nby K2 and TESS. The exoplanets detected by ExTrA will be amenable to\natmospheric characterisation with VLTs, JWST, and ELTs and could give our first\npeek into an exo-life laboratory.\n", "  The SILCC project (SImulating the Life-Cycle of molecular Clouds) aims at a\nmore self-consistent understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) on small\nscales and its link to galaxy evolution. We present three-dimensional\n(magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of the ISM in a vertically stratified box\nincluding self-gravity, an external potential due to the stellar component of\nthe galactic disc, and stellar feedback in the form of an interstellar\nradiation field and supernovae (SNe). The cooling of the gas is based on a\nchemical network that follows the abundances of H+, H, H2, C+, and CO and takes\nshielding into account consistently. We vary the SN feedback by comparing\ndifferent SN rates, clustering and different positioning, in particular SNe in\ndensity peaks and at random positions, which has a major impact on the\ndynamics. Only for random SN positions the energy is injected in sufficiently\nlow-density environments to reduce energy losses and enhance the effective\nkinetic coupling of the SNe with the gas. This leads to more realistic velocity\ndispersions (\\sigma_HI ~ 0.8\\sigma_(300-8000K) ~ 10-20km/s, \\sigma_H\\alpha ~\n0.6\\sigma_(8000-3e5K) ~ 20-30km/s), and strong outflows with mass loading\nfactors of up to 10 even for solar neighbourhood conditions. Clustered SNe abet\nthe onset of outflows compared to individual SNe but do not influence the net\noutflow rate. The outflows do not contain any molecular gas and are mainly\ncomposed of atomic hydrogen. The bulk of the outflowing mass is dense (\\rho ~\n1e-25-1e-24g/cc) and slow (v ~ 20-40km/s) but there is a high-velocity tail of\nup to v ~ 500km/s with \\rho ~ 1e-28-1e-27g/cc.\n", "  Measurement of magnetic oscillations on thermodynamic quantities (like\nmagnetization and specific heat), is one of the experimental methods to access\nthe density of states of electronic systems. In the present paper we therefore\ntheoretically explore the oscillatory phenomena on the specific heat of\ngraphenes considering gapped and gapless cases in a quantized magnetic field.\nFurther situations is also considered, as the influence of impurities, Coulomb\ninteraction and phonons. We could then map the magnetic oscillations on the\nspecific heat of graphenes under these constraints and the obtained results are\na good starting point and guide for further experimental works.\n", "  In this and the accompanying paper the problem of the maximally achievable\nelongation in a tokamak is investigated. The work represents an extension of\nmany earlier studies, which were often focused on determining the elongation\nlimits due to (1) natural elongation in a simple applied pure vertical field or\n(2) axisymmetric stability in the presence of a perfectly conducting wall. The\nextension investigated here includes the effect of the vertical stability\nfeedback system which actually sets the maximum practical elongation limit in a\nreal experiment. A basic resistive wall stability parameter (gammatau) is\nintroduced to model the feedback system which although simple in appearance\nactually captures the essence of the feedback system. Elongation limits in the\npresence of feedback are then determined by calculating the maximum elongation\nagainst n=0 resistive wall modes for fixed gammatau. The results are obtained\nby means of a general formulation culminating in a variational principle which\nis particularly amenable to numerical analysis. The principle is valid for\narbitrary profiles but simplifies significantly for the Solov'ev profiles,\neffectively reducing the 2-D stability problem into a 1-D problem. The\naccompanying paper provides the numerical results and leads to a sharp answer\nof how much elongation is too much?\n", "  Are we alone? Answering this ageless question will be a major focus for\nastrophysics in coming decades. Our tools will include unprecedentedly large\nUV-Optical-IR space telescopes working with advanced coronagraphs and\nstarshades. Yet, these facilities will not live up to their full potential\nwithout better detectors than we have today. To inform detector development,\nthis paper provides an overview of visible and near-IR (VISIR;\n$\\lambda=0.4-1.8~\\mu\\textrm{m}$) detector needs for the Advanced Technology\nLarge Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST), specifically for spectroscopic\ncharacterization of atmospheric biosignature gasses. We also provide a brief\nstatus update on some promising detector technologies for meeting these needs\nin the context of a passively cooled ATLAST.\n", "  The analytic theory presented in Paper I is converted into a form convenient\nfor numerical analysis. A fast and accurate code has been written using this\nnumerical formulation. The results are presented by first defining a reference\nset of physical parameters based on experimental data from high performance\ndischarges. Numerically obtained scaling relations of maximum achievable\nelongation versus inverse aspect ratio are obtained for various values of\npoloidal beta, wall radius and feedback capability parameter in ranges near the\nreference values. It is also shown that each value of maximum elongation occurs\nat a corresponding value of optimized triangularity, whose scaling is also\ndetermined as a function of inverse aspect ratio. The results show that the\ntheoretical predictions of maximum elongation are slightly higher than\nexperimental observations for high performance discharges as measured by high\naverage pressure. The theoretical optimized triangularity values are noticeably\nlower. We suggest that the explanation is associated with the observation that\nhigh performance involves not only MHD considerations, but also transport as\ncharacterized by confinement time. Operation away from the MHD optimum may\nstill lead to higher performance if there are more than compensatory gains in\nthe confinement time. Unfortunately, while the empirical scaling of the\nconfinement time with the elongation has been determined, the dependence on the\ntriangularity has still not been quantified. This information is needed in\norder to perform more accurate overall optimizations in future experimental\ndesigns.\n", "  We investigate superfluid properties of a one-component Fermi gas with a\nuniaxially anisotropic $p$-wave pairing interaction, $U_x>U_y=U_z$ (where $U_i$\n($i=x,y,z)$ is a $p_i$-wave pairing interaction). This type of interaction is\nconsidered to be realized in a $^{40}$K Fermi gas. Including pairing\nfluctuations within a strong-coupling $T$-matrix theory, we determine the\n$p_x$-wave superfluid phase transition temperature $T^{p_x}_{\\rm c}$, as well\nas the other phase transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}^{p_x+ip_y}$ ($<T_{\\rm\nc}^{p_x}$), below which the superfluid order parameter has the $p_x+ip_y$-wave\nsymmetry. In the normal state near $T^{p_x}_{\\rm c}$, $p_x$-wave pairing\nfluctuations are shown to induce an anisotropic pseudogap phenomenon, where a\ndip structure in the angle-resolved density of states around $\\omega=0$ is the\nmost remarkable in the $p_x$ direction. In the $p_x$-wave superfluid phase\n($T_{\\rm c}^{p_x+ip_y}<T\\le T_{\\rm c}^{p_x}$), while the pseudogap in the $p_x$\ndirection continuously changes to the superfluid gap, the pseudogap in the\nperpendicular direction to the $p_x$ axis is found to continue developing,\nbecause of enhanced $p_y$-wave and $p_z$-wave pairing fluctuations around the\nnode of the $p_x$-wave superfluid order parameter. Since pairing fluctuations\nare always suppressed in the isotropic $s$-wave superfluid state, this\nphenomenon is peculiar to an unconventional Fermi superfluid with a nodal\nsuperfluid order parameter. Since the $p$-wave Fermi superfluid is the most\npromising non $s$-wave pairing state in an ultracold Fermi gas, our results\nwould contribute to understanding how the anisotropic pairing fluctuations, as\nwell as the existence of plural superfluid phases, affect many-body properties\nof this unconventional Fermi superfluid.\n", "  Deviations from Gaussian statistics of the cosmological density fluctuations,\nso-called primordial non-Gaussianities (NG), are one of the most informative\nfingerprints of the origin of structures in the universe. Indeed, they can\nprobe physics at energy scales inaccessible to laboratory experiments, and are\nsensitive to the interactions of the field(s) that generated the primordial\nfluctuations, contrary to the Gaussian linear theory. As a result, they can\ndiscriminate between inflationary models that are otherwise almost\nindistinguishable. In this short review, we explain how to compute the\nnon-Gaussian properties in any inflationary scenario. We review the theoretical\npredictions of several important classes of models. We then describe the ways\nNG can be probed observationally, and we highlight the recent constraints from\nthe Planck mission, as well as their implications. We finally identify well\nmotivated theoretical targets for future experiments and discuss observational\nprospects.\n", "  We demonstrate that flat-topped dissipative solitonic pulses, platicons, and\ncorresponding frequency combs can be excited in optical microresonators with\nnormal group velocity dispersion using either amplitude modulation of the pump\nor bichromatic pump. Soft excitation may occur in particular frequency range if\nmodulation depth is large enough and modulation frequency is close to the free\nspectral range of the microresonator.\n", "  We study the electron as a system composed by an electron and a photon, using\nlowest order perturbation theory. We derive the leading-twist\ntransverse-momentum-dependent distribution functions for both the electron and\nphoton in the dressed electron, thereby offering a three-dimensional\ndescription of the dressed electron in momentum space. To obtain the\ndistribution functions, we apply both the formalism of light-front wave\nfunction overlap representation and the diagrammatic approach. We perform the\ncalculations both in light-cone gauge and Feynman gauge, and we present a\ndetailed discussion of the role of the Wilson lines to obtain gauge-independent\nresults. We provide numerical results and plots for many of the computed\ndistributions.\n", "  Detailed knowledge about equilibration processes is of interest for various\nfields of physics, including heavy ion collision experiments and quantum\nquenched condensed matter systems. We study the approach to equilibrium at late\ntimes within two types of strongly coupled thermal systems in 3+1 dimensions:\nsystems in the presence of (i) a non-zero charge density, or (ii) a magnetic\nfield at vanishing charge density. Utilizing the gauge/gravity correspondence,\nwe map the aforementioned problem to the computation of quasinormal frequencies\naround two particular classes of black branes within the Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory. We compute (i) the tensor and vector quasinormal modes of\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black branes and (ii) the scalar, as well as tensor\nquasinormal modes of magnetic black branes. Some of these quasinormal modes\ncorrespond to the late-time relaxation of the above systems after starting with\ninitial pressure anisotropy. We provide benchmarks which need to be matched at\nlate-times by all holographic thermalization codes with the appropriate\nsymmetries.\n", "  We have characterised Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) using low energy\nprotons, UV-VIS absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. We have also\ndeveloped and validated a simulation model that describes the behaviour of WbLS\nin our detector configurations for proton beam energies of 2 GeV, 475 MeV, and\n210 MeV and for two WbLS compositions. Our results have enabled us to estimate\nthe light yield and ionisation quenching of WbLS, as well as to understand the\ninfluence of the wavelength shifting of Cerenkov light on our measurements.\nThese results are relevant to the suitability of water-based liquid\nscintillator materials for next generation intensity frontier experiments.\n", "  By analyzing preliminary experimental measurements of charge-balance\nfunctions from the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic-Heavy-Ion Collider\n(RHIC), it is found that pictures where balancing charges are produced in a\nsingle surge, and therefore separated by a single length scale, are\ninconsistent with data. In contrast, a model that assumes two surges, one\nassociated with the formation of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma and a second\nassociated with hadronization, provides a far superior reproduction of the\ndata. A statistical analysis of the model comparison finds that the two-surge\nmodel best reproduces the data if the charge production from the first surge is\nsimilar to expectations for equilibrated matter taken from lattice gauge\ntheory. The charges created in the first surge appear to separate by\napproximately one unit of spatial rapidity before emission, while charges from\nthe second wave appear to have separated by approximately a half unit or less.\n", "  There is a large body of literature investigating the static and dynamic\nproperties of polyelectrolytes due both to their widespread application in\nindustrial processes and their ubiquitous presence in biology. Because of their\nhighly charged nature, polyelectrolytes tend to alter the local dielectric\npermittivity of the solution within a few nanometers of their backbone. This\neffect has, however, been almost entirely ignored in both simulations and\ntheoretical work. In this article we apply our recently developed electrostatic\nsolver based on Maxwell's equations to examine the effects of the permittivity\nreduction in the vicinity of the polyelectrolyte. We first verify our new\napproach by calculating and comparing ion distributions around a linear fixed\npolyelectrolyte and find both quantitative and qualitative changes in the ion\ndistribution. Further simulations with an applied electric field show that the\nreduction in the local dielectric constant increases the mobility of the chains\nby approximately ten percent. More importantly, variations in the local\ndielectric constant lead to qualitatively different behavior of the\nconductivity.\n", "  To enable space-based quantum key distribution proposals the Centre for\nQuantum Technologies is developing a source of entangled photons ruggedized to\nsurvive deployment in space and greatly miniaturised so that it conforms to the\nstrict form factor and power requirements of a 1U CubeSat. The Small Photon\nEntangling Quantum System is an integrated instrument where the pump, photon\npair source and detectors are combined within a single optical tray and\nelectronics package that is no larger than 10 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm. This footprint\nenables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the CubeLab\nstructure aboard the International Space Station. We will discuss the\nchallenges and future prospects of CubeSat-based missions.\n", "  The Small Photon Entangling Quantum System is an integrated instrument where\nthe pump, photon pair source and detectors are combined within a single optical\ntray and electronics package that is no larger than 10cm x 10cm x 3cm. This\nfootprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the\nCubeLab facility within the International Space Station. The first mission is\nto understand the different environmental conditions that may affect the\noperation of an entangled photon source in low Earth orbit. This understanding\nis crucial for the construction of cost-effective entanglement based\nexperiments that utilize nanosatellite architecture. We will discuss the\nchallenges and lessons we have learned over three years of development and\ntesting of the integrated optical platform and review the perspectives for\nfuture advanced experiments.\n", "  We have investigated the gauge dependence of the vacuum expectation\nvalue(VEV) both in the $R_{\\xi }$ and the $\\overline{R_{\\xi }}$ gauge in the\n$\\overline{MS}$ scheme. We have found that, in case of the $R_{\\xi }$ gauge,\nthe gauge dependence of the VEV should be modified due to the presence of the\nparameter in the gauge function that should be identified as a VEV in the\nbroken symmetry phase. However the pole mass remains gauge independent.\n", "  We investigate the effectiveness of a microwave cavity as a mediator of\ninteractions between two resonant exchange (RX) qubits in semiconductor quantum\ndots (QDs) over long distances, limited only by the extension of the cavity.\nOur interaction model includes the orthonormalized Wannier orbitals constructed\nfrom Fock-Darwin states under the assumption of a harmonic QD confinement\npotential. We calculate the qubit-cavity coupling strength in a Jaynes Cummings\nHamiltonian, and find that dipole transitions between two states with an\nasymmetric charge configuration constitute the relevant RX quoit-cavity\ncoupling mechanism. The effective coupling between two RX qubits in a shared\ncavity yields a universal two-qubit iSWAP-gate with gate times on the order of\nnanoseconds over distances on the order of up to a millimeter.\n", "  The detection of photons produced during the avalanche development in gas\nchambers has been the subject of detailed studies in the past. The great\nprogresses achieved in last years in the performance of micro-pattern gas\ndetectors on one side and of photo-sensors on the other provide the possibility\nof making high granularity and very sensitive particle trackers. In this paper,\nthe results obtained with a triple-GEM structure read-out by a CMOS based\nsensor are described. The use of an He/CF$_4$ (60/40) gas mixture and a\ndetailed optimization of the electric fields made possible to obtain and very\nhigh GEM light yield. About 80 photons per primary electron were detected by\nthe sensor resulting in a very good capability of tracking both muons from\ncosmic rays and electrons from natural radioactivity.\n", "  We consider a chain of torsionally-coupled, planar pendula shaken\nhorizontally by an external sinusoidal driver. It has been known that in such a\nsystem, theoretically modeled by the discrete sine-Gordon equation, intrinsic\nlocalized modes, also known as discrete breathers, can exist. Recently, the\nexistence of multifrequency breathers via subharmonic driving has been\ntheoretically proposed and numerically illustrated by Xu {\\em et al.} in Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 90}, 042921 (2014). In this paper, we verify this prediction\nexperimentally. Comparison of the experimental results to numerical simulations\nwith realistic system parameters (including a Floquet stability analysis), and\nwherever possible to analytical results (e.g. for the subharmonic response of\nthe single driven-damped pendulum), yields good agreement. Finally, we report\non period-1 and multifrequency edge breathers which are localized at the open\nboundaries of the chain, for which we have again found good agreement between\nexperiments and numerical computations\n", "  We present a calculation of the finite volume corrections to meson masses and\ndecay constants in three flavour Partially Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory\n(PQChPT) through two-loop order in the chiral expansion for the flavour-charged\n(or off-diagonal) pseudoscalar mesons. The analytical results are obtained for\nthree sea quark flavours with one, two or three different masses. We reproduce\nthe known infinite volume results and the finite volume results in the\nunquenched case. The calculation has been performed using the supersymmetric\nformulation of PQChPT as well as with a quark-flow technique.\n  Partial analytical results can be found in the appendices. Some examples of\ncases relevant to lattice QCD are studied numerically. Numerical programs for\nall results are available as part of the CHIRON package.\n", "  The electronic correlation strength is a basic quantity that characterizes\nthe physical properties of materials such as transition metal oxides.\nDetermining correlation strengths requires both precise definitions and a\ncareful comparison between experiment and theory. In this paper we define the\ncorrelation strength via the magnitude of the electron self-energy near the\nFermi level. For the case of LaNiO$_3$, we obtain both the experimental and\ntheoretical mass enhancements $m^\\star/m$ by considering high resolution\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density\nfunctional + dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT) calculations. We use\nvalence-band photoemission data to constrain the free parameters in the theory,\nand demonstrate a quantitative agreement between the experiment and theory when\nboth the realistic crystal structure and strong electronic correlations are\ntaken into account. These results provide a benchmark for the accuracy of the\nDFT+DMFT theoretical approach, and can serve as a test case when considering\nother complex materials. By establishing the level of accuracy of the theory,\nthis work also will enable better quantitative predictions when engineering new\nemergent properties in nickelate heterostructures.\n", "  Electric-field modulation of magnetism in strain-mediated multiferroic\nheterostructures is considered a promising scheme for enabling memory and\nmagnetic microwave devices with ultralow power consumption. However, it is not\nwell understood how electric-field-induced strain influences magnetic\nrelaxation, an important physical process for device applications. Here we\ninvestigate resonant magnetization dynamics in ferromagnet/ferrolectric\nmultiferroic heterostructures, FeGaB/PMN-PT and NiFe/PMN-PT, in two distinct\nstrain states provided by electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase\ntransition. The strain not only modifies magnetic anisotropy but also magnetic\nrelaxation. In FeGaB/PMN-PT, we observe a nearly two-fold change in intrinsic\nGilbert damping by electric field, which is attributed to strain-induced tuning\nof spin-orbit coupling. By contrast, a small but measurable change in extrinsic\nlinewidth broadening is attributed to inhomogeneous ferroelastic domain\nswitching during the phase transition of the PMN-PT substrate.\n", "  We study segmented strings in flat space and in $AdS_3$. In flat space, these\nwell known classical motions describe strings which at any instant of time are\npiecewise linear. In $AdS_3$, the worldsheet is composed of faces each of which\nis a region bounded by null geodesics in an $AdS_2$ subspace of $AdS_3$. The\ntime evolution can be described by specifying the null geodesic motion of kinks\nin the string at which two segments are joined. The outcome of collisions of\nkinks on the worldsheet can be worked out essentially using considerations of\ncausality. We study several examples of closed segmented strings in $AdS_3$ and\nfind an unexpected quasi-periodic behavior. We also work out a WKB analysis of\nquantum states of yo-yo strings in $AdS_3$ and find a logarithmic term\nreminiscent of the logarithmic twist of string states on the leading Regge\ntrajectory.\n", "  The astrophysical rapid neutron capture process or `$r$ process' of\nnucleosynthesis is believed to be responsible for the production of\napproximately half the heavy element abundances found in nature. This\nmultifaceted problem remains one of the greatest open challenges in all of\nphysics. Knowledge of nuclear physics properties such as masses, $\\beta$-decay\nand neutron capture rates, as well as $\\beta$-delayed neutron emission\nprobabilities are critical inputs that go into calculations of $r$-process\nnucleosynthesis. While properties of nuclei near stability have been\nestablished, much still remains unknown regarding neutron-rich nuclei far from\nstability that may participate in the $r$ process. Sensitivity studies gauge\nthe astrophysical response of a change in nuclear physics input(s) which allows\nfor the isolation of the most important nuclear properties that shape the final\nabundances observed in nature. This review summarizes the extent of recent\nsensitivity studies and highlights how these studies play a key role in\nfacilitating new insight into the $r$ process. The development of these tools\npromotes a focused effort for state-of-the-art measurements, motivates\nconstruction of new facilities and will ultimately move the community towards\naddressing the grand challenge of `How were the elements from iron to uranium\nmade?'.\n", "  Based on the obtained earlier experimental conductivity graphs at detonation\nof five different high explosives, an analysis was performed which shows a\ncorrelation between the carbon content and the conductivity magnitude. An\nassumption was put forward that the conductivity in the whole detonation wave\nis provided by the contact mechanism along conductive carbon nanostructures.\n", "  Space-borne nulling interferometers have long been considered as the best\noption for searching and characterizing extra-solar planets located in the\nhabitable zone of their parent stars. Solutions for achieving deep starlight\nextinction are now numerous and well demonstrated. However they essentially aim\nat realizing an achromatic central null in order to extinguish the star. In\nthis communication is described a major improvement of the technique, where the\nachromatization process is extended to the entire fringe pattern. Therefore\nhigher Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and appreciable simplification of the\ndetection system should result. The basic principle of this Fully achromatic\nnulling interferometer (FANI) consists in inserting dispersive elements along\nthe arms of the interferometer. Herein this principle is explained and\nillustrated by a preliminary optical system design. The typical achievable\nperformance and limitations are discussed and some initial tolerance\nrequirements are also provided\n", "  We study the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor during thin\nshell collapse for a massive, real, scalar field theory. At tree-level, we find\nthermal, Hawking-type, behaviour for the energy flux. Using the\nSchwinger-Keldysh technique, we calculate two-loop corrections to the\ntree-level correlation functions and show that they exhibit secular growth,\nsuggesting the breakdown of the perturbation theory.\n", "  Starting from three minimal off-shell 4D, $\\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets, using\nconstructions solely defined within the confines of the four dimensional field\ntheory we show the existence of a \"gadget\" - a member of a class of metrics on\nthe representation space of the supermultiplets - whose values directly and\ncompletely correspond to the values of a metric defined on the 1d, $N$ = 4\nadinkra networks adjacency matrices corresponding to the projections of the\nfour dimensional supermultiplets.\n", "  A two-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas in harmonic trap under rotation is\nstudied by solving \"ab initio\" Kohn-Sham equations. The physical parameters\nused match those of ultracold gas of fermionic $^{23}Na^{40}K$ molecules, a\nprototype system of strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter, which has been\ncreated very recently. We find that, as the critical rotational frequency is\napproached and the system collapses into the lowest Landau level, an array of\ntightly packed quantum vortices develops, in spite of the non-superfluid\ncharacter of the system. In this state the system looses axial symmetry, and\nthe fermionic cloud boundaries assume an almost perfect square shape. At higher\nvalues of the filling factor the vortex lattice disappears, while the system\nstill exhibits square-shaped boundaries. At lower values of the filling factor\nthe fermions become instead localized in a \"Wigner cluster\" structure.\n", "  Testing the spatial variation of fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ indicated\nin [Webb et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 191101 (2011)] with terrestrial\nlaboratory atomic measurements requires at least $\\dot{\\alpha}/\\alpha \\sim\n10^{-19}~\\textrm{y}^{-1}$ sensitivity. We conduct a systematic search of atomic\nsystems for such a test that have all features of the best optical clock\ntransitions leading to possibility of the frequency measurements with\nfractional accuracy on the level of $10^{-18}$ or better and have a factor of\n100 extra enhancement of $\\alpha$-variation in comparisons to experimental\nfrequency ratio measurement accuracy. We identify the pair of actinide\nCf$^{15+}$ and Es$^{16+}$ ions as the best system for a test of spatial\n$\\alpha-$variation hypothesis as it satisfies both of these requirements and\nhave sufficiently simple electronic structure to allow for high-precision\npredictions of all atomic properties required for rapid experimental progress.\n", "  Dislocation based modeling of plasticity is one of the central challenges at\nthe crossover of materials science and continuum mechanics. Developing a\ncontinuum theory of dislocations requires the solution of two long standing\nproblems: (i) to represent dislocation kinematics in terms of a reasonable\nnumber of variables and (ii) to derive averaged descriptions of the dislocation\ndynamics (i.e. material laws) in terms of these variables. The kinematic\nproblem (i) was recently solved through the introduction of continuum\ndislocation dynamics (CDD), which provides kinematically consistent evolution\nequations of dislocation alignment tensors, presuming a given average\ndislocation velocity (Hochrainer (2015), Philos. Mag. 95 (12), 1321--1367). In\nthe current paper we demonstrate how a free energy formulation may be used to\nsolve the dynamic closure problem (ii) in CDD. We do so exemplarily for the\nlowest order CDD variant for curved dislocations in a single slip situation. In\nthis case, a thermodynamically consistent average dislocation velocity is found\nto comprise five mesoscopic shear stress contributions. For a postulated free\nenergy expression we identify among these stress contributions a back-stress\nterm and a line-tension term, both of which have already been postulated for\nCDD. A new stress contribution occurs which is missing in earlier CDD models\nincluding the statistical continuum theory of straight parallel edge\ndislocations (Groma et al. (2015), Acta Mater. 51, 1271-1281). Furthermore, two\nentirely new stress contributions arise from the curvature of dislocations.\n", "  A 20% substitution of Bi with La in the perovskite Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3\nsystem obtained under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions has been\nfound to induce an incommensurately modulated structural phase. The room\ntemperature X-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns of this phase were\nsuccessfully refined using the Imma(0,0,g)s00 superspace group (g=0.534(3))\nwith the modulation applied to Bi/La- and oxygen displacements. The modulated\nstructure is closely related to the prototype antiferroelectric structure of\nPbZrO3 which can be considered as the lock-in variant of the latter with g\n=0.5. Below T_N = 220 K, the neutron diffraction data provide evidence for a\nlong-range G-type antiferromagnetic ordering commensurate with the average Imma\nstructure. Based on a general symmetry consideration, we show that the\ndirection of the spins is controlled by the antisymmetric exchange imposed by\nthe two primary structural distortions, namely oxygen octahedral tilting and\nincommensurate atomic displacements. The tilting is responsible for the onset\nof a weak ferromagnetism, observed in magnetization measurements, whereas the\nincommensurate displacive mode is dictated by the symmetry to couple a\nspin-density wave. The obtained results demonstrate that antisymmetric exchange\nis the dominant anisotropic interaction in Fe3+ based distorted perovskites\nwith a nearly quenched orbital degree of freedom.\n", "  We simulate the electron transport in vertical bi-layer nanowire which can be\nfabricated in molecular beam epitaxy process with lateral confinement potential\nformed by means of cleaved overgrowth or surface oxidization methods giving\nrectangular and smooth side confinement, respectively. In calculations we take\ninto account interaction between charge carriers using DFT within local spin\ndensity approximation. If magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire axis,\npseudogaps are opened in energy dispersion relation E(k) what in conjunction\nwith spin Zeeman shift of spin-up and spin-down subbands allows for quite high\nspin polarization of conductance. We find that in nanowire with rectangular\nlateral confinement potential, electron density has two maximums localized at\nwire edges in each layers. This modificates strongly all magnetosubbands giving\nup to four energy minimums in lowest subband and considerably diminishes widths\nof pseudogaps what translates into low maximal spin polarization of\nconductance, not exceeding $40\\%$. This drawback is absent in wire with smooth\nlateral confinement. However, in order to gain a large spin polarization\nsimultaneous tuning of magnetic field as well as the Fermi energies in both\nlayers of nanowire are required.\n", "  We report progress in computing and analyzing all tree amplitudes in ABJM\ntheory. Inspired by the isomorphism between the orthogonal Grassmannian and the\npure spinor geometries, we adopt a new gauge, called u-gauge, for evaluating\nthe orthogonal Grassmannian integral for ABJM amplitudes. We carry out the\nintegral explicitly for the 8-point amplitude and obtain the complete\nsupersymmetric amplitude. The physical and spurious poles arise from the\nintegral as expected from on-shell diagrams. We also derive a double scalar\nsoft theorem of ABJM amplitudes and verify it for known amplitudes.\n", "  We consider the question of conformal invariance of the long-range Ising\nmodel at the critical point. The continuum description is given in terms of a\nnonlocal field theory, and the absence of a stress tensor invalidates all of\nthe standard arguments for the enhancement of scale invariance to conformal\ninvariance. We however show that several correlation functions, computed to\nsecond order in the epsilon expansion, are nontrivially consistent with\nconformal invariance. We proceed to give a proof of conformal invariance to all\norders in the epsilon expansion, based on the description of the long-range\nIsing model as a defect theory in an auxiliary higher-dimensional space. A\ndetailed review of conformal invariance in the d-dimensional short-range Ising\nmodel is also included and may be of independent interest.\n", "  In this article we discuss the formal structure of a generalized information\ntheory based on the extension of the probability calculus of Kolmogorov to a\n(possibly) non-commutative setting. By studying this framework, we argue that\nquantum information can be considered as a particular case of a huge family of\nnon-commutative extensions of its classical counterpart. In any conceivable\ninformation theory, the possibility of dealing with different kinds of\ninformation measures plays a key role. Here, we generalize a notion of state\nspectrum, allowing us to introduce a majorization relation and a new family of\ngeneralized entropic measures.\n", "  We theoretically study the atomic structure and energetics of silicon and\nsilicon-nitrogen impurities in graphene. Using density-functional theory, we\nget insight into the atomic structures of the impurities, evaluate their\nformation energies and assess their abundance in realistic samples. We find\nthat nitrogen, as well as oxygen and hydrogen, are trapped at silicon\nimpurities, considerably altering the electronic properties of the system.\nFurthermore, we show that nitrogen doping can induce local magnetic moments\nresulting in spin-dependent transport properties, even though neither silicon\nnor nitrogen impurities are magnetic by themselves. To simulate large systems\nwith many randomly distributed impurities, we derive tight-binding models that\ndescribe the effects of the impurities on graphene {\\pi} electron structure.\nThen by using the linear-scaling real-space Kubo-Greenwood method, we evaluate\nthe transport properties of large-scale systems with random distribution of\nimpurities, and find the fingerprint-like scattering cross sections for each\nimpurity type. The transport properties vary widely, and our results indicate\nthat some of the impurities can even induce strong localization in realistic\ngraphene samples.\n", "  We present meson-meson (Wilson loop) correlators in Z(2) center vortex models\nfor the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theory, i.e., a hypercubic lattice model\nof random vortex surfaces and a continuous 2+1 dimensional model of random\nvortex lines. In particular we calculate quadratic and circular Wilson loop\ncorrelators in the two models respectively and observe that their expectation\nvalues follow the area law and show string breaking behavior. Further we\ncalculate the catenary solution for the two cases and try to find indications\nfor minimal surface behavior or string surface tension leading to string\nconstriction.\n", "  We report the impact of silver addition on granularity of NdFeAsO0.8F0.2\nsuperconductor. The ac susceptibility and electrical resistivity under magnetic\nfield are measured to study the improvement in weak links of NdFeAsO0.8F0.2\nwith addition of Ag. The Ag free NdFeAsO0.8F0.2 compound shows\nsuperconductivity at around 51.8K. Typical two step superconducting transitions\ndue to the inter and intra grain contributions, induced from the combined\neffect of superconducting grains and the inter-granular weak-coupled medium\nrespectively are clearly seen in susceptibility plots. In comparison to the\npure NdFeAsO0.8F0.2 compound, the coupling between the superconducting grains\nis significantly improved for 20Ag silver doped sample, and the same is\ndeteriorated for higher Ag content i.e., for 30wt Ag sample. The magneto\ntransport measurements R(T)H of polycrystalline 20Ag doped NdFeAsO0.8F0.2,\nexhibited the upper critical filed [Hc2(0)] of up to 334Tesla, which is\nslightly higher than the one observed for pure NdFeAsO0.8F0.2. The flux flow\nactivation energy varies from 7143.38K to 454.77K with magnetic field ranging\nfrom 0Tesla to 14Tesla for 20wtAg doped NdFeAsO0.8F0.2. In this investigation,\nour results show that limited addition of Ag improves the granular coupling of\nsuperconducting grains of NdFeAsO0.8F0.2 compound.\n", "  We derive the boundary conditions for MoS$_2$ and similar transition-metal\ndichalcogenide honeycomb (2H polytype) monolayers with the same type of\n$\\mathbf{k}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian within the continuum model around\nthe K points. In an effective 2-band description, the electron-hole symmetry\nbreaking quadratic terms are also taken into account. We model the effect of\nthe edges with a linear edge constraint method that has been applied previously\nto graphene. Focusing mainly on zigzag edges, we find that different\nreconstruction geometries with different edge-atoms can generally be described\nwith one scalar parameter varying between 0 and $2\\pi$. We analyze the edge\nstates and their dispersion relation in MoS$_2$ in particular, and we find good\nagreement with the results of previous density functional theory calculations\nfor various edge types.\n", "  We consider a right-handed scalar neutrino as the inflaton which carries a\ngravitational coupling with a supersymmetric QCD sector responsible for\nbreaking supersymmetry dynamically. The framework suggests an inflaton\npotential which is a deformed version of the quadratic chaotic inflation\nleading to a flatter potential. We find that this deformation results a sizable\ntensor to scalar ratio which falls within the allowed region by PLANCK 2015. At\nthe same time supersymmetry breaking at the end of inflation can naturally be\ninduced in this set-up. The symmetries required to construct the framework\nallows the neutrino masses and mixing to be of right order.\n", "  A search for a high-mass Higgs boson $H$ is performed in the\n$H\\to{WW}\\to\\ell\\nu\\ell\\nu$ and $H\\to{WW}\\to\\ell\\nu{qq}$ decay channels, using\n$pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$, collected at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider. No evidence of a high-mass Higgs boson is found. Limits on\n$\\sigma_H\\times \\mathrm{BR}(H\\to{WW})$ as a function of the Higgs boson mass\n$m_H$ are determined in three different scenarios: one in which the heavy Higgs\nboson has a narrow width compared to the experimental resolution, one a width\nincreasing with the boson mass and modeled by the complex-pole scheme following\nthe same behavior as in the Standard Model, and one for intermediate widths.\nThe upper range of the search is $m_H=1500$ GeV for the narrow-width scenario\nand $m_H=1000$ GeV for the other two scenarios. The lower edge of the search\nrange is $200-300$ GeV and depends on the analysis channel and search scenario.\nFor each scenario, individual and combined limits from the two $WW$ decay\nchannels are presented. At $m_H = 1500$ GeV, the highest mass point tested,\n$\\sigma_H\\cdot\\mathrm{BR}(H\\rightarrow WW)$ for a narrow-width Higgs boson is\nconstrained to be less than 22 fb and 6.6 fb at the 95% CL for the gluon fusion\nand vector-boson fusion production modes, respectively.\n", "  We present the design, fabrication and initial characterization of a paddle\nnanocavity consisting of a suspended sub-picogram nanomechanical resonator\noptomechanically coupled to a photonic crystal nanocavity. The optical and\nmechanical properties of the paddle nanocavity can be systematically designed\nand optimized, and key characteristics including mechanical frequency easily\ntailored. Measurements under ambient conditions of a silicon paddle nanocavity\ndemonstrate an optical mode with quality factor $Q_o$ ~ 6000 near 1550 nm, and\noptomechanical coupling to several mechanical resonances with frequencies\n$\\omega_m/2\\pi$ ~ 12-64 MHz, effective masses $m_\\text{eff}$ ~ 350-650 fg, and\nmechanical quality factors $Q_m$ ~ 44-327. Paddle nanocavities are promising\nfor optomechanical sensing and nonlinear optomechanics experiments.\n", "  A class of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories are constructed\nand shown to encode the simplicial geometries in 4-dimensions. The gauge\ntheories are defined by applying the Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov construction in\n3d/3d correspondence to certain graph complement 3-manifolds. Given a gauge\ntheory in this class, the massive supersymmetric vacua of the theory contain\nthe classical geometries on a 4d simplicial complex. The corresponding 4d\nsimplicial geometries are locally constant curvature (either dS or AdS), in the\nsense that they are made by gluing geometrical 4-simplices of the same constant\ncurvature. When the simplicial complex is sufficiently refined, the simplicial\ngeometries can approximate all possible smooth geometries on 4-manifold. At the\nquantum level, we propose that a class of holomorphic blocks defined in\narXiv:1211.1986 from the 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories are wave functions\nof quantum 4d simplicial geometries. In the semiclassical limit, the asymptotic\nbehavior of holomorphic block reproduces the classical action of 4d\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity in the simplicial context.\n", "  Quantum sensors based on solid-state spins provide tremendous opportunities\nin a wide range of fields from basic physics and chemistry to biomedical\nimaging. However, integrating them into a scanning probe microscope to enable\npractical, nanoscale quantum imaging is a highly challenging task. Recently,\nthe use of single spins in diamond in conjunction with atomic force microscopy\ntechniques has allowed significant progress towards this goal, but\ngeneralisation of this approach has so far been impeded by long acquisition\ntimes or by the absence of simultaneous topographic information. Here we report\non a scanning quantum probe microscope which solves both issues, by employing a\nnano-spin ensemble hosted in a nanodiamond. This approach provides up to an\norder of magnitude gain in acquisition time, whilst preserving sub-100 nm\nspatial resolution both for the quantum sensor and topographic images. We\ndemonstrate two applications of this microscope. We first image nanoscale\nclusters of maghemite particles through both spin resonance spectroscopy and\nspin relaxometry, under ambient conditions. Our images reveal fast magnetic\nfield fluctuations in addition to a static component, indicating the presence\nof both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles. We next demonstrate a\nnew imaging modality where the nano-spin ensemble is used as a thermometer. We\nuse this technique to map the photo-induced heating generated by laser\nirradiation of a single gold nanoparticle in a fluid environment. This work\npaves the way towards new applications of quantum probe microscopy such as\nthermal/magnetic imaging of operating microelectronic devices and magnetic\ndetection of ion channels in cell membranes.\n", "  Developing an efficient and robust polarimeter for wide spectral ranges and\nspace applications is a main issue in many projects. As part of the UVMag\nconsortium created to develop UV facilities in space (e.g. the Arago mission\nproposed to ESA), we are studying an innovative concept of polarimeter that is\nrobust, simple, and efficient on a wide spectral range. The idea, based on the\narticle by Sparks et al. (2012), is to use polarization scramblers to create a\nspatial modulation of the polarization. Along the height of the wedges of the\nscramblers, the thickness of the birefringent material crossed by the light,\nand thus the retardance, vary continuously. This variation creates an intensity\nmodulation of the light related to the entrance polarization state. Analyzing\nthis modulation with a linear polarizer, and dispersing the light spectrally in\nthe orthogonal spatial direction, enables the measurement of the full Stokes\nvector over the entire spectrum. This determination is performed with a\nsingle-shot measurement and without any moving parts in the system. After a\nquick introduction to the concept and optical design, this article presents the\ntolerancing study of the optical bench using this spectropolarimeter. The\nimpact of different error sources, such as, birefringence uncertainty or\ndecenter of the wedges, is investigated.\n", "  Weak measurement [1,19] combined with quantum delayed-choice experiment that\nuse quantum beam splitter instead of the beam splitter give rise to a\nsurprising amplification effect, i.e., counterintuitive negative amplification\neffect. We show that this effect is caused by the wave and particle behaviours\nof the system to be and can't be explained by a semiclassical wave theory, due\nto the entanglement of the system and the ancilla in quantum beam splitter. The\namplification mechanism about wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics lead\nus to a scheme for implementation of weak measurement in optomechanical system.\n", "  The computational study of chemical reactions in complex, wet environments is\ncritical for applications in many fields. It is often essential to study\nchemical reactions in the presence of applied electrochemical potentials,\ntaking into account the non-trivial electrostatic screening coming from the\nsolvent and the electrolytes. As a consequence the electrostatic potential has\nto be found by solving the generalized Poisson and the Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation for neutral and ionic solutions, respectively. In the present work\nsolvers for both problems have been developed. A preconditioned conjugate\ngradient method has been implemented to the generalized Poisson equation and\nthe linear regime of the Poisson-Boltzmann, allowing to solve iteratively the\nminimization problem with some ten iterations of a ordinary Poisson equation\nsolver. In addition, a self-consistent procedure enables us to solve the\nnon-linear Poisson-Boltzmann problem. Both solvers exhibit very high accuracy\nand parallel efficiency, and allow for the treatment of different boundary\nconditions, as for example surface systems. The solver has been integrated into\nthe BigDFT and Quantum-ESPRESSO electronic-structure packages and will be\nreleased as an independent program, suitable for integration in other codes.\n", "  We calculate non-perturbative contributions to Yukawa couplings on D3-branes\nat orbifold singularities due to E3 and fractional E(-1) instantons which do\nnot intersect the visible sector branes. While distant E3 instantons on bulk\ncycles typically contribute to Yukawa couplings, we find that distant\nfractional E(-1) can also give rise to new Yukawa couplings. However,\nfractional E(-1) instantons only induce Yukawa couplings if they are located at\na singularity which shares a collapsed homologous two-cycle with the\nsingularity supporting the visible sector. The non-perturbative contributions\nto Yukawa couplings exhibit a different flavour structure than the tree-level\nYukawa couplings and, as a result, they can be sources of flavour violation.\nThis is particularly relevant for schemes of moduli stabilisation which rely on\nsuperpotential contributions from E3 instantons, such as KKLT or the Large\nVolume Scenario. As a byproduct of our analysis, we shed some new light on the\nproperties of annulus diagrams with matter field insertions in stringy\ninstanton calculus.\n", "  We theoretically study thermally-activated phase slips in superfluid spin\ntransport in easy-plane magnetic wires within the stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, which runs parallel to the\nLanger-Ambegaokar-McCumber-Halperin theory for thermal resistances in\nsuperconducting wires. To that end, we start by obtaining the exact solutions\nfor free-energy minima and saddle points. We provide an analytical expression\nfor the phase-slip rate in the zero spin-current limit, which involves detailed\nanalysis of spin fluctuations at extrema of the free energy. An experimental\nsetup of a magnetoeletric circuit is proposed, in which thermal phase slips can\nbe inferred by measuring nonlocal magnetoresistance.\n", "  In 2008 a Starting Grant project supported by the European Research Council\ntitled \"Nuclear reaction studies relevant to the astrophysical p-process\nnucleosynthesis\" was launched. After five years of successful research related\nto the experimental investigation of proton- and alpha-induced nuclear reaction\nfor the astrophysical p-process, the project came to an end. In this paper a\nsummary of the research and the most important achievements is given.\n", "  Recently an orthogonal basis of $\\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra (AFLT basis) labeled\nby $N$-tuple Young diagrams was found in the context of 4D/2D duality.\nRecursion relations among the basis are summarized in the form of an algebra\nSH$^c$ which is universal for any $N$. We show that it has an $\\mathfrak{S}_3$\nautomorphism which is referred to as triality. We study the level-rank duality\nbetween minimal models, which is a special example of the automorphism. It is\nshown that the nonvanishing states in both systems are described by $N$ or $M$\nYoung diagrams with the rows of boxes appropriately shuffled. The reshuffling\nof rows implies there exists partial ordering of the set which labels them. For\nthe simplest example, one can compute the partition functions for the partially\nordered set (poset) explicitly, which reproduces the Rogers-Ramanujan\nidentities. We also study the description of minimal models by SH$^c$. Simple\nanalysis reproduces some known properties of minimal models, the structure of\nsingular vectors and the $N$-Burge condition in the Hilbert space.\n", "  Multifunctional mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) have attracted\nsubstantial attention with regard to their high potential for targeted drug\ndelivery. For future clinical applications it is crucial to address safety\nconcerns and understand the potential immunotoxicity of these nanoparticles. In\nthis study, we assess the biocompatibility and functionality of multifunctional\nMSN in freshly isolated, primary murine immune cells. We show that the\nfunctionalized silica nanoparticles are rapidly and efficiently taken up into\nthe endosomal compartment by specialized antigen-presenting cells such as\ndendritic cells. The silica nanoparticles showed a favorable toxicity profile\nand did not affect the viability of primary immune cells from the spleen in\nrelevant concentrations. Cargo-free MSN induced only very low immune responses\nin primary cells as determined by surface expression of activation markers and\nrelease of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6, -12 and -1\\beta.\nIn contrast, when surface-functionalized MSN with a pH-responsive polymer\ncapping were loaded with an immune-activating drug, the synthetic Toll-like\nreceptor 7 agonist R848, a strong immune response was provoked. We thus\ndemonstrate that MSN represent an efficient drug delivery vehicle to primary\nimmune cells that is both non-toxic and non-inflammagenic, which is a\nprerequisite for the use of these particles in biomedical applications.\n", "  Magnetic clouds (MCs) are formed by flux ropes (FRs) launched from the Sun as\npart of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). They carry away an important amount of\nmagnetic flux and helicity. The main aim of this study is to quantify these\nquantities from insitu measurements of MCs at 1 AU. The fit of these data by a\nlocal FR model provides the axial magnetic field strength, the radius, the\nmagnetic flux and the helicity per unit length along the FR axis. We show that\nthese quantities are statistically independent of the position along the FR\naxis. We then derive the generic shape and length of the FR axis from two sets\nof MCs. These results improve the estimation of magnetic helicity. Next, we\nevaluate the total magnetic flux and helicity crossing the sphere of radius of\n1 AU, centered at the Sun, per year and during a solar cycle. We also include\nin the study two sets of small FRs which do not have all the typical\ncharacteristics of MCs. While small FRs are at least ten times more numerous\nthan MCs, the magnetic flux and helicity are dominated by the contribution from\nthe larger MCs. They carry in one year the magnetic flux of about 25 large\nactive regions and the magnetic helicity of 200 of them. MCs carry away an\namount of unsigned magnetic helicity comparable to the one estimated for the\nsolar dynamo and the one measured in emerging active regions.\n", "  We consider two remote parties connected to a relay by two quantum channels.\nTo generate a secret key, they transmit coherent states to the relay, where the\nstates are subject to a continuous-variable (CV) Bell detection. We study the\nideal case where Alice's channel is lossless, i.e., the relay is locally\nsituated in her lab and the Bell detection is performed with unit efficiency.\nThis configuration allows us to explore the optimal performances achievable by\nCV measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD). This\ncorresponds to the limit of a trusted local relay, where the detection loss can\nbe re-scaled. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by an experimental\nsimulation where 10^-4 secret bits per use can potentially be distributed at\n170km assuming ideal reconciliation.\n", "  We present results of a 3-month combined X-ray/UV/optical monitoring campaign\nof the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6814. The object was monitored by Swift from June\nthrough August 2012 in the X-ray and UV bands and by the Liverpool Telescope\nfrom May through July 2012 in B and V. The light curves are variable and\nsignificantly correlated between wavebands. Using cross-correlation analysis,\nwe compute the time lag between the X-ray and lower energy bands. These lags\nare thought to be associated with the light travel time between the central\nX-ray emitting region and areas further out on the accretion disc. The computed\nlags support a thermal reprocessing scenario in which X-ray photons heat the\ndisc and are reprocessed into lower energy photons. Additionally, we fit the\nlightcurves using CREAM, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for a standard disc.\nThe best-fitting standard disc model yields unreasonably high super-Eddington\naccretion rates. Assuming more reasonable accretion rates would result in\nsignificantly under-predicted lags. If the majority of the reprocessing\noriginates in the disc, then this implies the UV/optical emitting regions of\nthe accretion disc are farther out than predicted by the standard thin disc\nmodel. Accounting for contributions from broad emission lines reduces the lags\nin B and V by approximately 25% (less than the uncertainty in the lag\nmeasurements), though additional contamination from the Balmer continuum may\nalso contribute to the larger than expected lags. This discrepancy between the\npredicted and measured interband delays is now becoming common in AGN where\nwavelength-dependent lags are measured.\n", "  The development of efficient low-loss electro-optic and nonlinear components\nbased on silicon or its related compounds, such as nitrides and oxides, is\nexpected to dramatically enhance silicon photonics by eliminating the need for\nnon-CMOS-compatible materials. While bulk Si is centrosymmetric and thus\ndisplays no second-order (\\c{hi}(2)) effects, a body of experimental evidence\naccumulated in the last decade demonstrates that when a strain gradient is\npresent, a significant \\c{hi}(2) and Pockels coefficient can be observed. In\nthis work we connect a strain-gradient-induced \\c{hi}(2) with another\nstrain-gradient-induced phenomenon, the flexoelectric effect. We show that even\nin the presence of an extremely strong strain gradient, the degree by which a\nnonpolar material like Si can be altered cannot possibly explain the order of\nmagnitude of observed chi^(2) phenomena. At the same time, in a polar material\nlike SiN, each bond has a large nonlinear polarizability, so when the inversion\nsymmetry is broken by a strain gradient, a small (few degrees) re-orientation\nof bonds can engender chi^(2) of the magnitude observed experimentally. It is\nour view therefore that the origin of the nonlinear and electro-optic effects\nin strained Si structures lies in not in the Si itself, but in the material\nproviding the strain: the silicon nitride cladding.\n", "  We show that a hot rotating fluid of relativistic chiral fermions possesses a\nnew gapless collective mode associated with coherent propagation of energy\ndensity and chiral density waves along the axis of rotation. This mode, which\nwe call the Chiral Heat Wave, emerges due to a mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomaly. At finite density the Chiral Heat Wave couples to the Chiral Vortical\nWave while in the presence of an external magnetic field it mixes with the\nChiral Magnetic Wave. The coupling of the Chiral Magnetic and Chiral Vortical\nWaves is also demonstrated. We find that the coupled waves - which are coherent\nfluctuations of the vector, axial and energy currents - have generally\ndifferent velocities compared to the velocities of the individual waves.\n", "  We address the recent anomalies in semi-leptonic $B$-meson decays using a\nmodel of fermion masses based on the $U(2)$ flavor symmetry. The new\ncontributions to $b \\to s \\ell \\ell$ transitions arise due to a tree-level\nexchange of a $Z^\\prime$ vector boson gauging a $U(1)$ subgroup of the flavor\nsymmetry. They are controlled by a single parameter and are approximately\naligned to the Standard Model prediction, with constructive interference in the\n$e$-channel and destructive interference in the $\\mu$-channel. The current\nexperimental data on semi-leptonic $B$-meson decays can be very well reproduced\nwithout violating existing constraints from flavor violation in the quark and\nlepton sectors. Our model will be tested by new measurements of $b \\to s \\ell\n\\ell$ transitions and also by future electroweak precision tests, direct\n$Z^\\prime$ searches, and $\\mu$-$e$ conversion in nuclei.\n", "  We use the GALFORM semi-analytical model to study high density regions traced\nby radio galaxies and quasars at high redshifts. We explore the impact that\nbaryonic physics has upon the properties of galaxies in these environments.\nStar-forming emission-line galaxies (Ly{\\alpha} and H{\\alpha} emitters) are\nused to probe the environments at high redshifts. Radio galaxies are predicted\nto be hosted by more massive haloes than quasars, and this is imprinted on the\namplitude of galaxy overdensities and cross-correlation functions. We find that\nLy{\\alpha} radiative transfer and AGN feedback indirectly affect the clustering\non small scales and also the stellar masses, star- formation rates and gas\nmetallicities of galaxies in dense environments. We also investigate the\nrelation between protoclusters associated with radio galaxies and quasars, and\ntheir present- day cluster descendants. The progenitors of massive clusters\nassociated with radio galaxies and quasars allow us to determine an average\nprotocluster size in a simple way. Overdensities within the protoclusters are\nfound to correlate with the halo descendant masses. We present scaling\nrelations that can be applied to observational data. By computing projection\neffects due to the wavelength resolution of modern spectrographs and\nnarrow-band filters we show that the former have enough spectral resolution to\nmap the structure of protoclusters, whereas the latter can be used to measure\nthe clustering around radio galaxies and quasars over larger scales to\ndetermine the mass of dark matter haloes hosting them.\n", "  The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) is a strategic instrument\nof the LBT designed for high-sensitivity, high-contrast, and high-resolution\ninfrared (1.5-13 $\\mu$m) imaging of nearby planetary systems. To carry out a\nwide range of high-spatial resolution observations, it can combine the two\nAO-corrected 8.4-m apertures of the LBT in various ways including direct\n(non-interferometric) imaging, coronagraphy (APP and AGPM), Fizeau imaging,\nnon-redundant aperture masking, and nulling interferometry. It also has\nbroadband, narrowband, and spectrally dispersed capabilities. In this paper, we\nreview the performance of these modes in terms of exoplanet science\ncapabilities and describe recent instrumental milestones such as first-light\nFizeau images (with the angular resolution of an equivalent 22.8-m telescope)\nand deep interferometric nulling observations.\n", "  We performed neutron powder diffraction measurements on\n(Bi$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5+x}$)TiO$_3$ and (Bi$_{0.5+y}$Na$_{0.5}$)TiO$_3$ to study\nstructural evolution induced by the non-stoichiometry. Despite the\nnon-stoichiometry, the local structure ($r$$\\leq$ 3.5 {\\AA}) from the pair\ndistribution function analysis is barely affected by the sodium deficit of up\nto -5 mol%. With increasing pair distance, however, the atomic pair\ncorrelations weaken due to the disorder caused by the sodium deficiency.\nAlthough the sodium and the bismuth share the same crystallographic site, their\nnon-stoichiometry have rather opposite effects as revealed from a distinctive\ndistortion of the Bragg peaks. In addition, Rietveld refinement demonstrates\nthat the octahedral tilting is continually suppressed by the sodium deficit of\nup to -5 mol%. This is contrary to the effect of the bismuth deficiency, which\nenhances the octahedral tilting.\n", "  We propose an original analog method to perform instantaneous and\nquantitative spectral analysis of microwave signals. An ensemble of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers held in a diamond plate is pumped by a 532 nm\nlaser. Its photoluminescence is imaged through an optical microscope and\nmonitored by a digital camera. The microwave signal is converted to an\noscillating magnetic field in the area of the NV centers by a loop shaped\nantenna. Induced magnetic resonances are detected through a decrease of the NV\ncenters photoluminescence. A magnetic field gradient induces a Zeeman shift of\nthe resonances and transforms the frequency information into spatial\ninformation, which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the microwave signal\nin the entire frequency bandwidth of the device. The time dependent spectral\nanalysis of an amplitude modulated microwave signal is demonstrated over a\nbandwidth of 600 MHz, associated to a frequency resolution of 7 MHz and a\nrefresh rate of 4 ms. With such integration time, a field of a few hundreds of\n{\\mu}W can be detected. Since the optical properties of NV centers can be\nmaintained even in high magnetic field, we estimate that an optimized device\ncould allow frequency analysis in a range of 30 GHz, only limited by the\namplitude of the magnetic field gradient. In addition, an increase of the NV\ncenters quantity could lead both to an increase of the microwave sensitivity\nand to a decrease of the minimum refresh rate down to a few {\\mu}s.\n", "  We elaborate on the Green's functions that appeared in [1,2] when\ngeneralizing, from massless to massive particles, various equivalences between\nsoft theorems and Ward identities of large gauge symmetries. We analyze these\nGreen's functions in considerable detail and show that they form a hierarchy of\nfunctions which describe `boundary to bulk' propagators for large $U(1)$ gauge\nparameters, supertranslations and sphere vector fields respectively. As a\nconsistency check we verify that the Green's functions associated to the large\ndiffeomorphisms map the Poincare group at null infinity to the Poincare group\nat time-like infinity.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the dynamics of a heavy homogeneous ball moving\nunder the influence of dry friction on a fixed horizontal plane. We assume the\nball to slide without rolling. We demonstrate that the plane may be divided\ninto two regions, each characterized by a distinct coefficient of friction, so\nthat balls with equal initial linear and angular velocity will converge upon\nthe same point from different initial locations along a certain segment. We\nconstruct the boundary between the two regions explicitly and discuss possible\napplications to real physical systems.\n", "  Collective coherent scattering of laser light induces strong light forces\nbetween polarizable point particles. These dipole forces are strongly enhanced\nin magnitude and distance within the field of an optical waveguide so that at\nlow temperature the particles self-order in strongly bound regular patterns.\nThe stationary configurations typically exhibit super-radiant scattering with\nstrong particle and light confinement. Here we study collective excitations of\nsuch self-consistent crystalline particle-light structures as function of\nparticle number and pump strength. Multiple scattering and absorption modify\nthe collective particle-field eigenfrequencies and create eigenmodes of\nsurprisingly complex nature. For larger arrays this often leads to dynamical\ninstabilities and disintegration of the structures even if additional damping\nis present.\n", "  We derive a coarse-grained description of the dynamics of a nanoparticle\nimmersed in an isothermal simple fluid by performing a systematic coarse\ngraining of the underlying microscopic dynamics. As coarse-grained or relevant\nvariables we select the position of the nanoparticle and the \\emph{total} mass\nand momentum density field of the fluid, which are locally conserved slow\nvariables because they are defined to include the contribution of the\nnanoparticle. The theory of coarse graining based on the Zwanzing projection\noperator leads us to a system of stochastic \\emph{ordinary} differential\nequations (SODEs) that are closed in the relevant variables. We demonstrate\nthat our discrete coarse-grained equations are consistent with a\nPetrov-Galerkin finite-element discretization of a system of formal stochastic\n\\emph{partial} differential equations (SPDEs) which resemble previously-used\nphenomenological models based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. Under suitable\napproximations we obtain \\emph{closed} approximations of the coarse-grained\ndynamics in a manner which gives them a clear physical interpretation, and\nprovides \\emph{explicit} microscopic expressions for all of the coefficients\nappearing in the closure. Our work leads to a model for dilute nanocolloidal\nsuspensions that can be simulated effectively using feasibly short molecular\ndynamics simulations as input to a FEM fluctuating hydrodynamic solver.\n", "  We show that the optical force exerted on a finite size chiral sphere by a\nsurface plasmon mode has a component along a direction perpendicular to the\nplasmon linear momentum. We reveal how this chiral lateral force, pointing in\nopposite directions for opposite enantiomers, stems from an angular-to-linear\ncrossed momentum transfer involving the plasmon transverse spin angular\nmomentum density and mediated by the chirality of the sphere. Our multipolar\napproach allows us discussing the inclusion of the recoil term in the force on\na small sphere taken in the dipolar limit and observing sign inversions of the\nlateral chiral force when the size of the sphere increases.\n", "  It is shown that the semiclassical coherent state propagator takes its\nsimplest form when the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is replaced by its Weyl\nsymbol in defining the classical action, in that there is then no need of a\nSolari-Kochetov correction. It is also shown that such a correction exists if a\nsymbol other than the Weyl symbol is chosen, and that its form is different\ndepending on the symbol chosen. The various forms of the propagator based on\ndifferent symbols are shown to be equivalent provided the correspondingly\ncorrect Solari-Kochetov correction is included. All these results are shown for\nboth particle and spin coherent state propagators. The global anomaly in the\nfluctuation determinant is further elucidated by a study of the connection\nbewteen the discrete fluctuation determinant and the discrete Jacobi equation.\n", "  Combs are a simple caricature of various types of natural branched\nstructures, which belong to the category of loopless graphs and consist of a\nbackbone and branches. We study continuous time random walks on combs and\npresent a generic method to obtain their transport properties. The random walk\nalong the branches may be biased, and we account for the effect of the branches\nby renormalizing the waiting time probability distribution function for the\nmotion along the backbone. We analyze the overall diffusion properties along\nthe backbone and find normal diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and stochastic\nlocalization (diffusion failure), respectively, depending on the\ncharacteristics of the continuous time random walk along the branches.\n", "  New rotation laws have been recently found for general-relativistic\nself-gravitating stationary fluids. It was not clear whether they apply to\nsystems rotating with a constant linear velocity. In this paper we fill this\ngap. The answer is positive. That means, in particular, that these systems\nshould exhibit the recently discovered general-relativistic weak-field effects\nwithin rotating tori: the dynamic anti-dragging and the deviation from the\nKeplerian motion induced by the fluid selfgravity.\n", "  We present the results of new Suzaku observations of the Coma Cluster, the\nX-ray brightest, nearby, merging system hosting a well studied, typical giant\nradio halo. It has been previously shown that, on the western side of the\ncluster, the radio brightness shows a much steeper gradient compared to other\nazimuths. XMM-Newton and Planck revealed a shock front along the southern half\nof the region associated with this steep radio gradient, suggesting that the\nradio emission is enhanced by particle acceleration associated with the shock\npassage. Suzaku demonstrates for the first time that this shock front extends\nnorthwards, tracing the entire length of the western edge of the Coma radio\nhalo. The shock is detected both in the temperature and X-ray surface\nbrightness distributions and has a Mach number of around $\\mathcal{M}\\sim1.5$.\nThe locations of the surface brightness edges align well with the edge of the\nradio emission, while the obtained temperature profiles seem to suggest shocks\nlocated 125-185 kpc further out in radius. In addition, the shock strengths\nderived from the temperature and density jumps are in agreement when using\nextraction regions parallel to the radio halo edge, but become inconsistent\nwith each other when derived from radial profiles centred on the Coma Cluster\ncore. It is likely that, beyond mere projection effects, the geometry of the\nshock is more complex than a front with a single, uniform Mach number and an\napproximately spherically symmetric shape.\n", "  We consider superconducting nanowire proximity coupled to superconductor /\nferromagnet / superconductor junction, where the magnetization penetrates into\nsuperconducting segment in nanowire decaying as $\\sim\\exp[-\\frac{\\mid n\n\\mid}{\\xi}]$ with site index $n$ and the decay length $\\xi$. We tune chemical\npotential and spin-orbit coupling so that topological superconducting regime\nhosting Majorana fermion is realized for long $\\xi$. We find that when $\\xi$\nbecomes shorter, zero energy state at the interface between superconductor and\nferromagnet splits into two away from zero energy. Accordingly, the behavior of\nJosephson current is drastically changed due to this \"zero mode-non-zero mode\ncrossover\". By tuning the model parameters, we find an almost second-harmonic\ncurrent-phase relation, $\\sin2\\varphi$, with phase difference $\\varphi$. Based\non the analysis of Andreev bound state (ABS), we clarify that current-phase\nrelation is determined by coupling of the states within the energy gap. We find\nthat the emergence of crossing points of ABS is a key ingredient to generate\n$\\sin2\\varphi$ dependence in current-phase relation. We further study both the\nenergy and $\\varphi$ dependence of pair amplitudes in the ferromagnetic region.\nFor long $\\xi$, odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave component is dominant. The\nmagnitude of the odd-frequency pair amplitude is enhanced at the energy level\nof ABS.\n", "  Carbon monoxide (CO) is widely used as a tracer of molecular hydrogen (H2) in\nmetal-rich galaxies, but is known to become ineffective in low metallicity\ndwarf galaxies. Atomic carbon has been suggested as a superior tracer of H2 in\nthese metal-poor systems, but its suitability remains unproven. To help us to\nassess how well atomic carbon traces H2 at low metallicity, we have performed a\nseries of numerical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds that cover a wide\nrange of different metallicities. Our simulations demonstrate that in\nstar-forming clouds, the conversion factor between [CI] emission and H2 mass,\n$X_{\\rm CI}$, scales approximately as $X_{\\rm CI} \\propto Z^{-1}$. We recover a\nsimilar scaling for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, $X_{\\rm CO}$, but find that\nat this point in the evolution of the clouds, $X_{\\rm CO}$ is consistently\nsmaller than $X_{\\rm CI}$, by a factor of a few or more. We have also examined\nhow $X_{\\rm CI}$ and $X_{\\rm CO}$ evolve with time. We find that $X_{\\rm CI}$\ndoes not vary strongly with time, demonstrating that atomic carbon remains a\ngood tracer of H2 in metal-poor systems even at times significantly before the\nonset of star formation. On the other hand, $X_{\\rm CO}$ varies very strongly\nwith time in metal-poor clouds, showing that CO does not trace H2 well in\nstarless clouds at low metallicity.\n", "  The formalism of quantum state space geometry on manifolds of generalised\ncoherent states is proposed as a natural setting for the construction of\ngeometric dual descriptions of non-relativistic quantum systems. These state\nmanifolds are equipped with natural Riemannian and symplectic structures\nderived from the Hilbert space inner product. This approach allows for the\nsystematic construction of geometries which reflect the dynamical symmetries of\nthe quantum system under consideration. We analyse here in detail the two\ndimensional case and demonstrate how existing results in the AdS_2/CFT_1\ncontext can be understood within this framework. We show how the radial/bulk\ncoordinate emerges as an energy scale associated with a regularisation\nprocedure and find that, under quite general conditions, these state manifolds\nare asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions of a class of classical dilaton\ngravity models. For the model of conformal quantum mechanics proposed by de\nAlfaro et. al. the corresponding state manifold is seen to be exactly AdS_2\nwith a scalar curvature determined by the representation of the symmetry\nalgebra. It is also shown that the dilaton field itself is given by the quantum\nmechanical expectation values of the dynamical symmetry generators and as a\nresult exhibits dynamics equivalent to that of a conformal mechanical system.\n", "  We present an analytical model that characterizes two-photon transitions in\nthe presence of autoionising states. We applied this model to interpret\nresonant RABITT spectra, and show that, as a harmonic traverses a resonance,\nthe phase of the sideband beating significantly varies with photon energy. This\nphase variation is generally very different from the $\\pi$ jump observed in\nprevious works, in which the direct path contribution was negligible. We\nillustrate the possible phase profiles arising in resonant two-photon\ntransitions with an intuitive geometrical representation.\n", "  Bacteria predate plants and animals by billions of years. Today, they are the\nworld's smallest cells yet they represent the bulk of the world's biomass, and\nthe main reservoir of nutrients for higher organisms. Most bacteria can move on\ntheir own, and the majority of motile bacteria are able to swim in viscous\nfluids using slender helical appendages called flagella. Low-Reynolds-number\nhydrodynamics is at the heart of the ability of flagella to generate propulsion\nat the micron scale. In fact, fluid dynamic forces impact many aspects of\nbacteriology, ranging from the ability of cells to reorient and search their\nsurroundings to their interactions within mechanically and chemically-complex\nenvironments. Using hydrodynamics as an organizing framework, we review the\nbiomechanics of bacterial motility and look ahead to future challenges.\n", "  We measure the nonlinear refractive index coefficients in N$_2$, O$_2$ and Ar\nfrom visible through mid-infrared wavelengths (\\lambda = 0.4 - 2.4 {\\mu}m). The\nwavelengths investigated correspond to transparency windows in the atmosphere.\nGood agreement is found with theoretical models of $\\chi^{(3)}$. Our results\nare essential for accurately simulating the propagation of ultrashort mid-IR\npulses in the atmosphere.\n", "  Microstructure of reflection holographic grating fabricated via a\nphoto-isomerization process in an absorptive azopolymer film is analyzed. A\nsurface relief formation takes place on the film surface even in the reflection\nholographic configuration. The polarization-dependent diffraction efficiency\nand the polarization analysis reveal that the polarization grating structure\ninside the film strongly depends on the amount of optical absorption\nexperienced by the two writing beams. Theoretical analysis shows that the\nreflection polarization grating, while mimicking a cholesteric liquid crystal\nstructure, is composed of elliptic polarizations with the ellipticity going\nthrough a periodic modulation.\n", "  We characterize the pointer states generated by the master equation of\nquantum Brownian motion and derive stochastic equations for the dynamics of\ntheir trajectories in phase space. Our method is based on a Poissonian\nunraveling of the master equation whose deterministic part exhibits\nsoliton-like solutions that can be identified with the pointer states. In the\nsemiclassical limit, their phase space trajectories turn into those of\nclassical diffusion, yielding a clear picture of the induced quantum- classical\ntransition.\n", "  We consider a synchrotron radiation from a charged particle moving in a bound\norbit around a weakly magnetized Schwarzschild black hole (a static black hole\nimmersed into a constant uniform magnetic field) in its equatorial plane,\nperpendicular to the magnetic field. In particular, we study the case when the\nLorentz force acting on the charged particle is directed outward from the black\nhole. The particle is initially moving in a nongeodesic bound orbit which due\nto synchrotron radiation decays to a nongeodesic circular orbit. We study this\ntransition and calculate the radiated power and energy loss of the particle.\n", "  We prove the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC), a lower bound on the\nstress tensor in terms of the second variation in a null direction of the\nentropy of a region. The QNEC arose previously as a consequence of the Quantum\nFocussing Conjecture, a proposal about quantum gravity. The QNEC itself does\nnot involve gravity, so a proof within quantum field theory is possible. Our\nproof is somewhat nontrivial, suggesting that there may be alternative\nformulations of quantum field theory that make the QNEC more manifest.\n  Our proof applies to free and superrenormalizable bosonic field theories, and\nto any points that lie on stationary null surfaces. An example is Minkowski\nspace, where any point $p$ and null vector $k^a$ define a null plane $N$ (a\nRindler horizon). Given any codimension-2 surface $\\Sigma$ that contains $p$\nand lies on $N$, one can consider the von Neumann entropy $S_\\text{out}$ of the\nquantum state restricted to one side of $\\Sigma$. A second variation\n$S_\\text{out}^{\\prime\\prime}$ can be defined by deforming $\\Sigma$ along $N$,\nin a small neighborhood of $p$ with area $\\cal A$. The QNEC states that\n$\\langle T_{kk}(p) \\rangle \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi} \\lim_{{\\cal A}\\to\n0}S_\\text{out}^{ \\prime\\prime}/{\\cal A}$.\n", "  Two types of correlations between the radio and X-ray luminosities ($L_R$ and\n$L_X$) have been found in black hole X-ray binaries. For some sources, they\nfollow the `original' type of correlation which is described by a single\npower-law. Later it was found that some other sources follow a different\ncorrelation consisting of three power-law branches, with each branch having\ndifferent power-law indexes. In this work, we explain these two types of\ncorrelation under the coupled accretion--jet model. We attribute the difference\nbetween these two types of sources to the different value of viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha$. One possible reason for different $\\alpha$ is the different\nconfiguration of magnetic field in the accretion material coming from the\ncompanion stars. For the `single power-law' sources, their $\\alpha$ is high; so\ntheir accretion is always in the mode of advection-dominated accretion flow\n(ADAF) for the whole range of X-ray luminosity. For those `hybrid power-law'\nsources, the value of $\\alpha$ is small so their accretion mode changes from an\nADAF to a luminous hot accretion flow, and eventually to two-phase accretion as\nthe accretion rate increases. Because the dependence of radiative efficiency on\nthe mass accretion rate is different for these three accretion modes, different\npower-law indexes in the $L_R--L_X$ correlation are expected. Constraints on\nthe ratio of the mass loss rate into the jet and the mass accretion rate in the\naccretion flow are obtained, which can be tested in future by radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of jet formation.\n", "  We present a self-gravitating, analytic and globally regular Skyrmion\nsolution of the Einstein-Skyrme system with winding number w = 1, in presence\nof a cosmological constant. The static spacetime metric is the direct product\nRxS3 and the Skyrmion is the self-gravitating generalization of the static\nhedgehog solution of Manton and Ruback with unit topological charge. This\nsolution can be promoted to a dynamical one in which the spacetime is a\ncosmology of the Bianchi type-IX with time-dependent scale and squashing\ncoefficients. Remarkably, the Skyrme equations are still identically satisfied\nfor all values of these parameters. Thus, the complete set of field equations\nfor the Einstein-Skyrme-Lambda system in the topological sector reduces to a\npair of coupled, autonomous, nonlinear differential equations for the scale\nfactor and a squashing coefficient. These equations admit analytic bouncing\ncosmological solutions in which the universe contracts to a minimum\nnon-vanishing size, and then expands. A non-trivial byproduct of this solution\nis that a minor modification of the construction gives rise to a family of\nstationary, regular configurations in General Relativity with negative\ncosmological constant supported by an SU(2) nonlinear sigma model. These\nsolutions represent traversable AdS wormholes with NUT parameter in which the\nonly \"exotic matter\" required for their construction is a negative cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  Four quantities deducible from nuclear structure experiments have been\nclaimed to correlate to the slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy; the\nneutron skin thickness, the cross section of low-energy dipole (LED) mode,\ndipole polarizability $\\alpha_D$, and $\\alpha_D S_0$ (i.e. product of\n$\\alpha_D$ and the symmetry energy $S_0$). By the calculations in the\nHartree-Fock plus random-phase approximation with various effective\ninteractions, we compare the correlations between $L$ and these four\nquantities. The correlation derived from different interactions and the\ncorrelation from a class of interactions that are identical in the symmetric\nmatter as well as in $S_0$ are simultaneously examined. These two types of\ncorrelations may behave differently, as exemplified in the correlation of\n$\\alpha_D$ to $L$. It is found that the neutron skin thickness and\n$\\alpha_DS_0$ correlate well to $L$, and therefore are suitable for narrowing\ndown the value of $L$ via experiments. The LED emergence and upgrowth makes the\n$\\alpha_DS_0$-$L$ correlation strong, although these correlations are\ndisarranged when neutron halo appears in the ground state.\n", "  Finite 't Hooft coupling corrections to multiple physical observables in\nstrongly coupled $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma are examined, in an\nattempt to assess the stability of the expansion in inverse powers of the 't\nHooft coupling $\\lambda$. Observables considered include thermodynamic\nquantities, transport coefficients, and quasinormal mode frequencies. Although\nlarge $\\lambda$ expansions for quasinormal mode frequencies are notably less\nwell behaved than the expansions of other quantities, we find that a partial\nresummation of higher order corrections can significantly reduce the\nsensitivity of the results to the value of $\\lambda$.\n", "  We implemented a variation after projection (VAP) algorithm based on a\ntriaxially deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov vacuum state. This is the first\nprojected mean field study that includes all the quantum numbers (except\nparity), i.e., spin ($J$), isospin ($T$) and mass number ($A$). Systematic VAP\ncalculations with $JTA$-projection have been performed for the even-even\n$sd$-shell nuclei with the USDB Hamiltonian. All the VAP ground state energies\nare within 500 keV above the exact shell model values. Our VAP calculations\nshow that the spin projection has two important effects: (1) the spin\nprojection is crucial in achieving good approximation of the full shell model\ncalculation. (2) the intrinsic shapes of the VAP wavefunctions with spin\nprojection are always triaxial, while the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov methods\nlikely provide axial intrinsic shapes. Finally, our analysis suggests that one\nmay not be possible to associate an intrinsic shape to an exact shell model\nwave function.\n", "  We present a set of four three-dimensional, general relativistic, radiation\nMHD simulations of black hole accretion at super-critical mass accretion rates,\n$\\dot{M} > \\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$. We use these simulations to study how disk\nproperties are modified when we vary the black hole mass, the black hole spin,\nor the mass accretion rate. In the case of a non-rotating black hole, we find\nthat the total efficiency is of order $3\\%\\dot M c^2$, approximately a factor\nof two less than the efficiency of a standard thin accretion disk. The\nradiation flux in the funnel along the axis is highly super-Eddington, but only\na small fraction of the energy released by accretion escapes in this region.\nThe bulk of the $3\\%\\dot M c^2$ of energy emerges farther out in the disk,\neither in the form of photospheric emission or as a wind. In the case of a\nblack hole with a spin parameter of 0.7, we find a larger efficiency of about\n$8\\%\\dot M c^2$. By comparing the relative importance of advective and\ndiffusive radiation transport, we show that photon trapping is effective near\nthe equatorial plane. However, near the disk surface, vertical transport of\nradiation by diffusion dominates. We compare the properties of our fiducial\nthree-dimensional run with those of an equivalent two-dimensional axisymmetric\nmodel with a mean-field dynamo. The latter simulation runs nearly 100 times\nfaster than the three-dimensional simulation, and gives very similar results\nfor time-averaged properties of the accretion flow.\n", "  Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) provides new opportunities for high\nresolution X-ray imaging with simultaneous amplitude and phase contrast.\nExtensions to CDI broaden the scope of the technique for use in a wide variety\nof experimental geometries and physical systems. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a new extension to CDI that encodes additional information through\nthe use of a series of randomly coded masks. The information gained from the\nfew additional diffraction measurements removes the need for typical\nobject-domain constraints; the algorithm uses prior information about the masks\ninstead. The experiment is performed using a laser diode at 532.2 nm, enabling\nrapid prototyping for future X-ray synchrotron and even free electron laser\nexperiments. Diffraction patterns are collected with up to 15 different masks\nplaced between a CCD detector and a single sample. Phase retrieval is performed\nusing a convex relaxation routine known as \"PhaseCut\" followed by a variation\non Fienup's input-output algorithm. The reconstruction quality is judged via\ncalculation of phase retrieval transfer functions as well as by an object-space\ncomparison between reconstructions and a lens-based image of the sample. The\nresults of this analysis indicate that with enough masks (in this case 3 or 4)\nthe diffraction phases converge reliably, implying stability and uniqueness of\nthe retrieved solution.\n", "  A confining, symmetry-preserving, Dyson-Schwinger equation treatment of a\nvector-vector contact interaction is used to formulate Faddeev equations for\nthe nucleon and Delta-baryon in which the kernel involves dynamical\ndressed-quark exchange and whose solutions therefore provide momentum-dependent\nFaddeev amplitudes. These solutions are compared with those obtained in the\nstatic approximation and with a QCD-kindred formulation of the Faddeev kernel.\nThey are also used to compute a range of nucleon properties, amongst them: the\nproton's sigma-term; the large Bjorken-x values of separate ratios of\nunpolarised and longitudinally-polarised valence u- and d-quark parton\ndistribution functions; and the proton's tensor charges, which enable one to\ndirectly determine the effect of dressed-quark electric dipole moments (EDMs)\non neutron and proton EDMs.\n", "  We study in detail the hydrodynamic theories describing the transition to\ncollective motion in polar active matter, exemplified by the Vicsek and active\nIsing models. Using a simple phenomenological theory, we show the existence of\nan infinity of propagative solutions, describing both phase and microphase\nseparation, that we fully characterize. We also show that the same results hold\nspecifically in the hydrodynamic equations derived in the literature for the\nactive Ising model and for a simplified version of the Vicsek model. We then\nstudy numerically the linear stability of these solutions. We show that stable\nones constitute only a small fraction of them, which however includes all\nexisting types. We further argue that in practice, a coarsening mechanism leads\ntowards phase-separated solutions. Finally, we construct the phase diagrams of\nthe hydrodynamic equations proposed to qualitatively describe the Vicsek and\nactive Ising models and connect our results to the phenomenology of the\ncorresponding microscopic models.\n", "  We present the status of the laue project devoted to develop a technology for\nbuilding a 20 meter long focal length Laue lens for hard x-/soft gamma-ray\nastronomy (80 - 600 keV). The Laue lens is composed of bent crystals of Gallium\nArsenide (GaAs, 220) and Germanium (Ge, 111), and, for the first time, the\nfocusing property of bent crystals has been exploited for this field of\napplications. We show the preliminary results concerning the adhesive employed\nto fix the crystal tiles over the lens support, the positioning accuracy\nobtained and possible further improvements. The Laue lens petal that will be\ncompleted in a few months has a pass band of 80 - 300 keV and is a fraction of\nan entire Laue lens capable of focusing X-rays up to 600 keV, possibly\nextendable down to 20 - 30 keV with suitable low absorption crystal materials\nand focal length. The final goal is to develop a focusing optics that can\nimprove the sensitivity over current telescopes in this energy band by 2 orders\nof magnitude.\n", "  We investigate the crystal structure, transport and magnetic properties of\nFe-doped ferromagnetic semiconductor (Al1-x,Fex)Sb thin films up to x = 14%\ngrown by molecular beam epitaxy. All the samples show p-type conduction at room\ntemperature and insulating behavior at low temperature. The (Al1-x,Fex)Sb thin\nfilms with x lower or equal to 10% maintain the zinc blende crystal structure\nof the host material AlSb. The (Al1-x,Fex)Sb thin film with x = 10% shows\nintrinsic ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature (TC) of 40 K. In the\n(Al1-x,Fex)Sb thin film with x = 14%, a sudden drop of mobility and TC was\nobserved, which may be due to microscopic phase separation. The observation of\nferromagnetism in (Al,Fe)Sb paves the way to realize a spin-filtering tunnel\nbarrier that is compatible with well-established III-V semiconductor devices.\n", "  The surface potential and the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer are\nextremely important for designing future semiconductor devices based on the\nemerging two-dimensional (2D) phosphorene. Here, we directly measured the\nstrongly layer-dependent surface potential of mono- and few-layer phosphorene\non gold, which confirms with the reported theoretical prediction. At the same\ntime, we used an optical way - photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to probe the\ncharge transfer in phosphorene-gold hybrid system. We firstly observed highly\nanisotropic and layer-dependent PL quenching in the phosphorene-gold hybrid\nsystem, which is attributed to the highly anisotropic/layer-dependent\ninterfacial charge transfer.\n", "  We examine the origins of azimuthal correlations observed in high energy\nproton-nucleus collisions by considering the simple example of the scattering\nof uncorrelated partons off color fields in a large nucleus. We demonstrate how\nthe physics of fluctuating color fields in the color glass condensate (CGC)\neffective theory generates these azimuthal multiparticle correlations and\ncompute the corresponding Fourier coefficients v_n within different CGC\napproximation schemes. We discuss in detail the qualitative and quantitative\ndifferences between the different schemes. We will show how a recently\nintroduced color field domain model that captures key features of the observed\nazimuthal correlations can be understood in the CGC effective theory as a model\nof non-Gaussian correlations in the target nucleus.\n", "  The requirements to achieve high detection efficiency (above 50\\%) and\ngigahertz (GHz) frame rate for the proposed 42-keV X-ray free-electron laser\n(XFEL) at Los Alamos are summarized. Direct detection scenarios using C\n(diamond), Si, Ge and GaAs semiconductor sensors are analyzed. Single-photon\ncounting (SPC) mode and weak SPC mode using Si can potentially meet the\nefficiency and frame rate requirements and be useful to both photoelectric\nabsorption and Compton physics as the photon energy increases. Multilayer\nthree-dimensional (3D) detector architecture, as a possible means to realize\nSPC modes, is compared with the widely used two-dimensional (2D) hybrid planar\nelectrode structure and 3D deeply entrenched electrode architecture.\nDemonstration of thin film cameras less than 100-$\\mu$m thick with onboard thin\nASICs could be an initial step to realize multilayer 3D detectors and SPC modes\nfor XFELs.\n", "  Restructuring of electronic spectrum in a buckled silicene monolayer under\nsome applied voltage between its two sublattices and in presence of certain\nimpurity atoms is considered. A special attention is given to formation of\nlocalized impurity levels within the band gap and the to their collectivization\nat finite impurity concentration. It is shown that a qualitative restructuring\nof quasiparticle spectrum within the initial band gap and then specific\nmetal-insulator phase transitions are possible for such disordered system and\ncan be effectively controlled by variation of the electric field bias at given\nimpurity perturbation potential and concentration. Since these effects are\nexpected at low impurity concentrations but at not too low temperatures, they\ncan be promising for practical applications in nanoelectronics devices.\n", "  In this article we present a concrete proposal for spin squeezing the\nultracold ground state polar paramagnetic molecule OH, a system currently under\nfine control in the laboratory. In contrast to existing work, we consider a\nsingle, non-interacting molecule with angular momentum greater than $1/2$.\nStarting from an experimentally relevant effective Hamiltonian, we identify a\nparameter regime where different combinations of static electric and magnetic\nfields can be used to realize the single-axis twisting Hamiltonian of Kitagawa\nand Ueda [M. Kitagawa and M. Ueda, Phys. Rev. A 47, 5138 (1993)], the uniform\nfield Hamiltonian proposed by Law et al. [C. K. Law, H. T Ng and P. T. Leung,\nPhys. Rev. A 63, 055601 (2001)], and a model of field propagation in a Kerr\nmedium considered by Agarwal and Puri [G. S. Agarwal and R. R. Puri, Phys. Rev.\nA 39, 2969 (1989)]. To support our conclusions, we provide analytical\nexpressions as well as numerical calculations, including optimization of field\nstrengths and accounting for the effects of field misalignment. Our results\nhave consequences for applications such as precision spectroscopy, techniques\nsuch as magnetometry, and stereochemical effects such as the\norientation-to-alignment transition.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger's thought experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of\nboth alive and dead states reveals profound consequences of quantum mechanics\nand has attracted enormous interests. Here we propose a straightforward method\nto create quantum superposition states of a living microorganism by putting a\nsmall cryopreserved bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator. Our\nproposal is based on recent developments that the center-of-mass oscillation of\na 15-$\\mu$m-diameter aluminium membrane has been cooled to its quantum ground\nstate [Nature 475: 359 (2011)], and entangled with a microwave field [Science\n342: 710 (2013)]. A microorganism with a mass much smaller than the mass of the\nelectromechanical membrane will not significantly affect the quality factor of\nthe membrane and can be cooled to the quantum ground state together with the\nmembrane. Quantum superposition and teleportation of its center-of-mass motion\nstate can be realized with the help of superconducting microwave circuits. More\nimportantly, the internal states of a microorganism, such as the electron spin\nof a glycine radical, can be entangled with its center-of-mass motion and\nteleported to a remote microorganism. Our proposal can be realized with\nstate-of-art technologies. The proposed setup is a quantum-limited magnetic\nresonance force microscope. Since internal states of an organism contain\ninformation, our proposal also provides a scheme for teleporting information or\nmemories between two remote organisms.\n", "  We investigate the motion of test particles in the gravitational field of a\nstatic naked singularity generated by a mass distribution with quadrupole\nmoment. We use the quadrupole-metric ($q-$metric) which is the simplest\ngeneralization of the Schwarzschild metric with a quadrupole parameter. We\nstudy the influence of the quadrupole on the motion of massive test particles\nand photons and show that the behavior of the geodesics can drastically depend\non the values of the quadrupole parameter. In particular, we prove explicitly\nthat the perihelion distance depends on the value of the quadrupole. Moreover,\nwe show that an accretion disk on the equatorial plane of the quadrupole source\ncan be either continuous or discrete, depending on the value of the quadrupole.\nThe inner radius of the disk can be used in certain cases to determine the\nvalue of the quadrupole parameter. The case of a discrete accretion is\ninterpreted as due to the presence of repulsive gravity generated by the naked\nsingularity. Radial geodesics are also investigated and compared with the\nSchwarzschild counterparts.\n", "  We propose a two-loop induced neutrino mass model, in which we show some\nbench mark points to satisfy the observed neutrino oscillation, the constraints\nof lepton flavor violations, and the relic density in the co-annihilation\nsystem satisfying the current upper bound on the spin independent scattering\ncross section with nuclei. We also discuss new sources of muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment.\n", "  The fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method has attracted interest in\nrecent years as a way to calculate properties of solid materials with high\naccuracy. However, the framework for the calculation of properties such as\ntotal energies, atomization energies, and excited state energies is not yet\nfully established. Several outstanding questions remain as to the effect of\npseudopotentials, the magnitude of the fixed node error, and the size of\nsupercell finite size effects. Here, we consider in detail the semiconductors\nZnSe and ZnO and carry out systematic studies to assess the magnitude of the\nenergy differences arising from controlled and uncontrolled approximations in\nDMC. The former include time step errors and supercell finite size effects for\nground and optically excited states, and the latter include pseudopotentials,\nthe pseudopotential localization approximation, and the fixed node\napproximation. We find that for these compounds, the errors can be controlled\nto good precision using modern computational resources, and that quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations using Dirac-Fock pseudopotentials can offer good estimates\nof both cohesive energy and the gap of these systems. We do however observe\ndifferences in calculated optical gaps that arise when different\npseudopotentials are used.\n", "  In general the experiments on the linear optical properties of a single-layer\ntwo-dimensional atomic crystal are interpreted by modeling it as a homogeneous\nslab with an effective thickness. Here I fit the most remarkable experiments in\ngraphene optics by using the Fresnel coefficients, fixing both the surface\nsusceptibility and the surface conductivity of graphene. It is shown that the\nFresnel coefficients and the slab model are not equivalent. Experiments\nindicate that the Fresnel coefficients are able to simulate the overall\nexperiments here analyzed, while the slab model fails to predict absorption and\nthe phase of the reflected light.\n", "  We present a new set of three-body interaction models based on the\nBruch-McGee (BM) potential that are suitable for the study of the energy,\nstructural and elastic properties of solid 4He at high pressure. Our ab initio\nthree-body potentials are obtained from the fit to total energies and atomic\nforces computed with the van der Waals density functional theory method due to\nGrimme, and represent an improvement with respect to previously reported\nthree-body interaction models. In particular, we show that some of the\nintroduced BM parametrizations reproduce closely the experimental equation of\nstate and bulk modulus of solid helium up to a pressure of ~ 60 GPa, when used\nin combination with standard pairwise interaction models in diffusion Monte\nCarlo simulations. Importantly, we find that recent predictions reporting a\nsurprisingly small variation of the kinetic energy and Lindeman ratio on\nquantum crystals under increasing pressure are likely to be artifacts produced\nby the use of incomplete interaction models. Also, we show that the\nexperimental variation of the shear modulus, C44, at P < 25 GPa can be\nquantitatively described with the new set of three-body BM potentials. At\nhigher pressures, however, the agreement between our C44 results and\nexperiments deteriorates and thus we argue that higher order many-body terms in\nthe expansion of the atomic interactions probably are necessary in order to\nbetter describe elasticity in very dense solid 4He.\n", "  The thermodynamics of irreversible processes in continuous media predicts the\nexistence of a Magnetic Nernst effect that results from a magnetic analog to\nthe Seebeck effect in a ferromagnet and magnetophoresis occurring in a\nparamagnetic electrode in contact with the ferromagnet. Thus, a voltage that\nhas DC and AC components is expected across a Pt electrode as a response to the\ninhomogeneous magnetic induction field generated by magnetostatic waves of an\nadjacent YIG slab subject to a temperature gradient. The voltage frequency and\ndependence on the orientation of the applied magnetic induction field are quite\ndistinct from that of spin pumping.\n", "  We describe different Bayesian ensemble refinement methods, examine their\ninterrelation, and discuss their practical application. With ensemble\nrefinement, the properties of dynamic and partially disordered (bio)molecular\nstructures can be characterized by integrating a wide range of experimental\ndata, including measurements of ensemble-averaged observables. We start from a\nBayesian formulation in which the posterior is a functional that ranks\ndifferent configuration space distributions. By maximizing this posterior, we\nderive an optimal Bayesian ensemble distribution. For discrete configurations,\nthis optimal distribution is identical to that obtained by the maximum entropy\n\"ensemble refinement of SAXS\" (EROS) formulation. Bayesian replica ensemble\nrefinement enhances the sampling of relevant configurations by imposing\nrestraints on averages of observables in coupled replica molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We show that the strength of the restraint should scale linearly\nwith the number of replicas to ensure convergence to the optimal Bayesian\nresult in the limit of infinitely many replicas. In the \"Bayesian inference of\nensembles\" (BioEn) method, we combine the replica and EROS approaches to\naccelerate the convergence. An adaptive algorithm can be used to sample\ndirectly from the optimal ensemble, without replicas. We discuss the\nincorporation of single-molecule measurements and dynamic observables such as\nrelaxation parameters. The theoretical analysis of different Bayesian ensemble\nrefinement approaches provides a basis for practical applications and a\nstarting point for further investigations.\n", "  When an unmagnetized plasma comes in contact with a material surface, the\ndifference in mobility between the electrons and the ions creates a nonneutral\nlayer known as the Debye sheath (DS). However, in magnetic fusion devices, the\nopen magnetic field lines intersect the structural elements of the device with\nnear grazing incidence angles. The magnetic field tends to align the particle\nflow along its own field lines, thus counteracting the mechanism that leads to\nthe formation of the DS. Recent work using a fluid model [P. Stangeby, Nucl.\nFusion {\\bf 52}, 083012 (2012)] showed that the DS disappears when the\nincidence angle is smaller than a critical value (around $5^\\circ$ for\nITER-like parameters). Here, we study this transition by means of numerical\nsimulations of a kinetic model both in the collisionless and weakly collisional\nregimes. We show that the main features observed in the fluid model are\npreserved: for grazing incidence, the space charge density near the wall is\nreduced, the ion flow is subsonic, and the electric field and plasma density\nprofiles are spread out over several ion Larmor radii instead of a few Debye\nlengths as in the unmagnetized case. As there is no singularity at the DS\nentrance in the kinetic model, this phenomenon depends smoothly on the magnetic\nfield incidence angle and no particular critical angle arises. The simulation\nresults and the predictions of the fluid model are in good agreement, although\nsome discrepancies subsist, mainly due to the assumptions of isothermal closure\nand diagonality of the pressure tensor in the fluid model.\n", "  The electronic structure of the new diluted magnetic semiconductor\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($x=0.30$, $y=0.15$) in\nsingle crystal form has been investigated by angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). %High density of states of nondispersive bands composed\nof the Zn $3d$ orbitals are observed with ultraviolet incident light.\nMeasurements with soft x-rays clarify the host valence-band electronic\nstructure primarily composed of the As $4p$ states. Two hole pockets around the\n$\\Gamma$ point, a hole corrugated cylinder surrounding the $\\Gamma$ and Z\npoints, and an electron pocket around the Z point are observed, and explain the\nmetallic transport of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$. This\nis contrasted with Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As (GaMnAs), where it is located above the\nAs $4p$ valence-band maximum (VBM) and no Fermi surfaces have been clearly\nidentified. Resonance soft x-ray ARPES measurements reveal a nondispersive\n(Kondo resonance-like) Mn $3d$ impurity band near the Fermi level, as in the\ncase of GaMnAs. However, the impurity band is located well below the VBM,\nunlike the impurity band in GaMnAs, which is located around and above the VBM.\nWe conclude that, while the strong hybridization between the Mn $3d$ and the As\n$4p$ orbitals plays an important role in creating the impurity band and\ninducing high temperature ferromagnetism in both systems, the metallic\ntransport may predominantly occur in the host valence band in\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and in the impurity band in\nGaMnAs.\n", "  We study the time dependence of the decoherence factor (DF) of a qubit\nglobally coupled to an environmental spin system (ESS) which is driven across\nthe quantum critical point (QCP) by varying a parameter of its Hamiltonian in\ntime $t$ as $1 -t/\\tau$ or $-t/\\tau$, to which the qubit is coupled starting at\nthe time $t \\to -\\infty$; here, $\\tau$ denotes the inverse quenching rate. In\nthe limit of weak coupling, we analyze the time evolution of the DF in the\nvicinity of the QCP (chosen to be at $t=0$) and define three quantities,\nnamely, the generalized fidelity susceptibility $\\chi_F(\\tau)$ (defined right\nat the QCP), and the decay constants $\\alpha_1 (\\tau)$ and $\\alpha_2 (\\tau)$\nwhich dictate the decay of the DF at a small but finite $t$($>0$). Using a\ndimensional analysis argument based on the Kibble-Zurek healing length, we show\nthat $\\chi_F(\\tau)$ as well as $\\alpha_1 (\\tau)$ and $\\alpha_2(\\tau)$ indeed\nsatisfy universal power-law scaling relations with $\\tau$ and the exponents are\nsolely determined by the spatial dimensionality of the ESS and the exponents\nassociated with its QCP. Remarkably, using the numerical t-DMRG method, these\nscaling relations are shown to be valid in both the situations when the ESS is\nintegrable and non-integrable and also for both linear and non-linear variation\nof the parameter. Furthermore, when an integrable ESS is quenched far away from\nthe QCP, there is a predominant Gaussian decay of the DF with a decay constant\nwhich also satisfies a universal scaling relation.\n", "  We aim to unveil the most massive central cluster black holes in the\nuniverse. We present a new search strategy which is based on a black hole mass\ngain sensitive 'calorimeter' and which links the innermost stellar density\nprofile of a galaxy to the adiabatic growth of its central SMBH. In a first\nstep we convert observationally inferred feedback powers into SMBH growth rates\nby using reasonable energy conversion efficiency parameters, $\\epsilon$. In the\nmain part of this paper we use these black hole growth rates, sorted in\nlogarithmically increasing steps encompassing our whole parameter space, to\nconduct $N$-Body computations of brightest cluster galaxies with the newly\ndeveloped MUESLI software. For the initial setup of galaxies we use core-Sersic\nmodels in order to account for SMBH scouring. We find that adiabatically driven\ncore re-growth is significant at the highest accretion rates. As a result, the\nmost massive black holes should be located in BCGs with less pronounced cores\nwhen compared to the predictions of empirical scaling relations which are\nusually calibrated in less extreme environments. For efficiency parameters\n$\\epsilon<0.1$, BCGs in the most massive, relaxed and X-ray luminous galaxy\nclusters might even develop steeply rising density cusps. Finally, we discuss\nseveral promising candidates for follow up investigations, among them the\nnuclear black hole in the Phoenix cluster. Based on our results, it might have\na mass of the order of $10^{11} M_\\odot$.\n", "  We examine the effect of adding PT-symmetric gain and loss terms to quasi 1D\nlattices (ribbons) that possess flat bands. We focus on three representative\ncases: (a) The Lieb ribbon, (b) The kagome ribbon, and (c) The stub Ribbon. In\ngeneral we find that the effect on the flat band depends strongly on the\ngeometrical details of the lattice being examined. One interesting and novel\nresult that emerge from an analytical calculation of the band structure of the\nLieb ribbon including gain and loss, is that its flat band survives the\naddition of PT-symmetry for any amount of gain and loss, while for the other\ntwo lattices, any presence of gain and loss destroys the flat bands. For all\nthree ribbons, there are finite stability windows whose size decreases with the\nstrength of the gain and loss parameter. For the Lieb and kagome cases, the\nsize of this window converges to a finite value. The existence of finite\nstability windows, plus the constancy of the Lieb flat band are in marked\ncontrast to the behavior of a pure one-dimensional lattice.\n", "  The production of non-phi K+K- pairs by protons of 2.83 GeV kinetic energy on\nC, Cu, Ag, and Au targets has been investigated using the COSY-ANKE magnetic\nspectrometer. The K- momentum dependence of the differential cross section has\nbeen measured at small angles over the 0.2--0.9 GeV/c range. The comparison of\nthe data with detailed model calculations indicates an attractive K- -nucleus\npotential of about -60 MeV at normal nuclear matter density at a mean momentum\nof 0.5 GeV/c. However, this approach has difficulty in reproducing the\nsmallness of the observed cross sections at low K- momenta.\n", "  Velocity distribution functions link the micro- and macro-level theories of\nfluid flow through porous media. Here we study them for the fluid absolute\nvelocity and its longitudinal and lateral components relative to the\nmacroscopic flow direction in a model of a random porous medium. We claim that\nall distributions follow the power exponential law controlled by an exponent\n$\\gamma$ and a shift parameter $u_0$ and examine how these parameters depend on\nthe porosity. We find that $\\gamma$ has a universal value $1/2$ at the\npercolation threshold and grows with the porosity, but never exceeds 2.\n", "  We seek possible statistical consequences of the way a forcing term is added\nto the Navier--Stokes equations in the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of\nincompressible channel flow. Simulations driven by constant flow rate, constant\npressure gradient and constant power input are used to build large databases,\nand in particular to store the complete temporal trace of the wall-shear stress\nfor later analysis. As these approaches correspond to different dynamical\nsystems, it can in principle be envisaged that these differences are reflect by\ncertain statistics of the turbulent flow field. The instantaneous realizations\nof the flow in the various simulations are obviously different, but, as\nexpected, the usual one-point, one-time statistics do not show any appreciable\ndifference. However, the PDF for the fluctuations of the streamwise component\nof wall friction reveals that the simulation with constant flow rate presents\nlower probabilities for extreme events of large positive friction. The low\nprobability value of such events explains their negligible contribution to the\ncommonly computed statistics; however, the very existence of a difference in\nthe PDF demonstrates that the forcing term is not entirely uninfluential. Other\nstatistics for wall-based quantities (the two components of friction and\npressure) are examined; in particular spatio-temporal autocorrelations show\nsmall differences at large temporal separations, where unfortunately the\nresidual statistical uncertainty is still of the same order of the observed\ndifference. Hence we suggest that the specific choice of the forcing term does\nnot produce important statistical consequences, unless one is interested in the\nstrongest events of high wall friction, that are underestimated by a simulation\nrun at constant flow rate.\n", "  We focus on the probability distribution function (pdf) $P(\\Delta \\gamma;\n\\gamma)$ where $\\Delta \\gamma$ are the {\\em measured} strain intervals between\nplastic events in an athermal strained amorphous solids, and $\\gamma$ measures\nthe accumulated strain. The tail of this distribution as $\\Delta \\gamma\\to 0$\n(in the thermodynamic limit) scales like $\\Delta \\gamma^\\eta$. The exponent\n$\\eta$ is related via scaling relations to the tail of the pdf of the\neigenvalues of the {\\em plastic modes} of the Hessian matrix $P(\\lambda)$ which\nscales like $\\lambda^\\theta$, $\\eta=(\\theta-1)/2$. The numerical values of\n$\\eta$ or $\\theta$ can be determined easily in the unstrained material and in\nthe yielded state of plastic flow. Special care is called for in the\ndetermination of these exponents between these states as $\\gamma$ increases.\nDetermining the $\\gamma$ dependence of the pdf $P(\\Delta \\gamma; \\gamma)$ can\nshed important light on plasticity and yield. We conclude that the pdf's of\nboth $\\Delta \\gamma$ and $\\lambda$ are not continuous functions of $\\gamma$. In\nslowly quenched amorphous solids they undergo two discontinuous transitions,\nfirst at $\\gamma=0^+$ and then at the yield point $\\gamma=\\gamma_{_{\\rm Y}}$ to\nplastic flow. In quickly quenched amorphous solids the second transition is\nsmeared out due to the non existing stress peak before yield. The nature of\nthese transitions and scaling relations with the system size dependence of\n$\\langle \\Delta \\gamma\\rangle$ are discussed.\n", "  The results of our speckle interferometric observations of young binaries VY\nTau and XZ Tau are presented. For the first time, we found a relative\ndisplacement of VY Tau components as well as a preliminary orbit for XZ Tau. It\nappeared that the orbit is appreciably non-circular and is inclined by $i\n\\lesssim 47^o$ from the plane of the sky. It means that the rotation axis of XZ\nTau A and the axis of its jet are significantly non-perpendicular to the\norbital plane. We found that the average brightness of XZ Tau had been\nincreasing from the beginning of the last century up to the mid-thirties and\nthen it decreased by $\\Delta B > 2$ mag. The maximal brightness has been\nreached significantly later on the time of periastron passage. The total\nbrightness of XZ Tau's components varied in a non-regular way from 1970 to 1985\nwhen eruptions of hot gas from XZ Tau A presumably had occurred. In the early\nnineties the variations became regular following which a chaotic variability\nhad renewed. We also report that a flare activity of VY Tau has resumed after\n40 yr pause, parameters of the previous and new flares are similar, and the\nflares are related with the A component.\n", "  We use measurements from the Planck satellite mission and galaxy redshift\nsurveys over the last decade to test three of the basic assumptions of the\nstandard model of cosmology, $\\Lambda$CDM: the spatial curvature of the\nuniverse, the nature of dark energy and the laws of gravity on large scales. We\nobtain improved constraints on several scenarios that violate one or more of\nthese assumptions. We measure $w_0=-0.94\\pm0.17$ (18\\% measurement) and\n$1+w_a=1.16\\pm0.36$ (31\\% measurement) for models with a time-dependent\nequation of state, which is an improvement over current best constraints\n\\citep{Aubourg2014}. In the context of modified gravity, we consider popular\nscalar tensor models as well as a parametrization of the growth factor. In the\ncase of one-parameter $f(R)$ gravity models with a $\\Lambda$CDM background, we\nconstrain $B_0 < 1.36 \\times 10^{-5} $ (1$\\sigma$ C.L.), which is an\nimprovement by a factor of 4 on the current best \\citep{XU2015}. We provide the\nvery first constraint on the coupling parameters of general scalar-tensor\ntheory and stringent constraint on the only free coupling parameter of\nChameleon models. We also derive constraints on extended Chameleon models,\nimproving the constraint on the coupling by a factor of 6 on the current best\n\\citep{Hojjati2011} . We also measure $\\gamma = 0.612 \\pm 0.072$ (11.7\\%\nmeasurement) for growth index parametrization. We improve all the current\nconstraints by combining results from various galaxy redshift surveys in a\ncoherent way, which includes a careful treatment of scale-dependence introduced\nby modified gravity.\n", "  Hierarchical triple-star systems are expected to form frequently via close\nbinary-binary encounters in the dense cores of globular clusters. In a\nsufficiently inclined triple, gravitational interactions between the inner and\nouter binary can cause large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the\ninner orbit (\"Lidov-Kozai cycles\"), which can lead to a collision and merger of\nthe two inner components. In this paper we use Monte Carlo models of dense star\nclusters to identify all triple systems formed dynamically and we compute their\nevolution using a highly accurate three-body integrator which incorporates\nrelativistic and tidal effects. We find that a large fraction of these triples\nevolve through a non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binary\nto higher eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbation\ntheory (even including octupole-order terms). We place constraints on the\nimportance of Lidov-Kozai-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational wave\nsources detectable by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), for triples with an inner pair of\nstellar black holes; and (ii) blue straggler stars, for triples with\nmain-sequence-star components. We find a realistic aLIGO detection rate of\nblack hole mergers due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism of 1yr^-1, with about 20%\nof these having a finite eccentricity when they first chirp into the aLIGO\nfrequency band. While rare, these events are likely to dominate among eccentric\ncompact object inspirals that are potentially detectable by aLIGO. For blue\nstragglers, we find that the Lidov-Kozai mechanism can contribute only up to\n~10% of their total numbers in globular clusters.\n", "  In recent work, we analyzed the dynamics of spherical and nonspherical\nacoustic perturbations of the Michel flow, describing the steady radial\naccretion of a relativistic perfect fluid into a nonrotating black hole. We\nshowed that such perturbations undergo quasi-normal oscillations and computed\nthe corresponding complex frequencies as a function of the black hole mass M\nand the radius r_c of the sonic horizon. It was found that when r_c is much\nlarger than the Schwarzschild radius r_H = 2GM/c^2 of the black hole, these\nfrequencies scale like the surface gravity of the analogue black hole\nassociated with the acoustic metric.\n  In this work, we analyze the Newtonian limit of the Michel solution and its\nacoustic perturbations. In this limit, the flow outside the sonic horizon\nreduces to the transonic Bondi flow, and the acoustic metric reduces to the one\nintroduced by Unruh in the context of experimental black hole evaporation. We\nshow that for the transonic Bondi flow, Unruh's acoustic metric describes an\nanalogue black hole and compute the associated quasi-normal frequencies. We\nprove that they do indeed scale like the surface gravity of the acoustic black\nhole, thus providing an explanation for our previous results in the\nrelativistic setting.\n", "  Kinetic equations for magnetic nano particles dispersed in a viscous liquid\nare developed and analyzed numerically. Depending on the amplitude of an\napplied oscillatory magnetic field the particles orient their time averaged\nanisotropy axis perpendicular to the applied field for low magnetic field\namplitudes and nearly parallel to the direction of the field for high\namplitudes. The transition between these regions takes place in a narrow field\ninterval. In the low field region the magnetic moment is locked to some crystal\naxis and the energy absorption in an oscillatory driving field is dominated by\nviscous losses associated with particle rotation in the liquid. In the opposite\nlimit the magnetic moment rotates within the particle while its easy axis being\nnearly parallel to the external field direction oscillates. The kinetic\nequations are generalized to include thermal fluctuations. This leads to a\nsignificant increase of the power absorption in the low and intermediate field\nregion with a pronounced absorption peak as function of particle size. In the\nhigh field region, on the other hand, the inclusion of thermal fluctuations\nreduces the power absorption. The illustrative numerical calculations presented\nare performed for magnetic parameters typical for iron oxide.\n", "  The European Research Council has recently funded HOLMES, a project with the\naim of performing a calorimetric measurement of the electron neutrino mass\nmeasuring the energy released in the electron capture decay of 163Ho. The\nbaseline for HOLMES are microcalorimeters coupled to Transition Edge Sensors\n(TESs) read out with rf-SQUIDs, for microwave multiplexing purposes. A\npromising alternative solution is based on superconducting microwave\nresonators, that have undergone rapid development in the last decade. These\ndetectors, called Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), are\ninherently multiplexed in the frequency domain and suitable for even\nlarger-scale pixel arrays, with theoretical high energy resolution and fast\nresponse. The aim of our activity is to develop arrays of microresonator\ndetectors for X-ray spectroscopy and suitable for the calorimetric measurement\nof the energy spectra of 163Ho. Superconductive multilayer films composed by a\nsequence of pure Titanium and stoichiometric TiN layers show many ideal\nproperties for MKIDs, such as low loss, large sheet resistance, large kinetic\ninductance, and tunable critical temperature $T_c$. We developed Ti/TiN\nmultilayer microresonators with $T_c$ within the range from 70 mK to 4.5 K and\nwith good uniformity. In this contribution we present the design solutions\nadopted, the fabrication processes and the characterization results.\n", "  We investigate simple one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with open\nboundaries. We are interested in the average on-site residence time defined as\nthe time a particle spends on a given site before moving on to the next site.\nUsing mean-field theory, we obtain an analytical expression for the on-site\nresidence times. By comparing the analytic predictions with numerics, we\ndemonstrate that the mean-field significantly underestimates the residence time\ndue to the neglect of time correlations in the local density of particles. The\ntemporal correlations are particularly long-lived near the average shock\nposition, where the density changes abruptly from low to high. By using Domain\nwall theory (DWT), we obtain highly accurate estimates of the residence time\nfor different boundary conditions. We apply our analytical approach to\nresidence times in a totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP), TASEP\ncoupled to Langmuir kinetics (TASEP + LK), and TASEP coupled to mutually\ninteractive LK (TASEP + MILK). The high accuracy of our predictions is verified\nby comparing these with detailed Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We investigate a Lorentz-violating chiral model composed by two fermions, a\ncomplex scalar field and a gauge field. We show that by convenientely adjusting\nthe parameters of the model, it is possible to generate an unambiguous\nCarroll-Field-Jackiw term and, at the same time, provide the cancelation of the\nchiral anomaly. The renormalizability of the model is investigated and it is\nshown that the same counterterms needed in the symmetric phase also renormalize\nthe model with broken symmetry.\n", "  The Weyl semimetal is characterized by three-dimensional linear band touching\npoints called Weyl nodes. These nodes come in pairs with opposite chiralities.\nWe show that the coupling of circularly polarized photons with these chiral\nelectrons generates a Hall conductivity without any applied magnetic field in\nthe plane orthogonal to the light propagation. This phenomenon comes about\nbecause with all three Pauli matrices exhausted to form the three-dimensional\nlinear dispersion, the Weyl nodes cannot be gapped. Rather, the net influence\nof chiral photons is to shift the positions of the Weyl nodes. Interestingly,\nthe momentum shift is tightly correlated with the chirality of the node to\nproduce a net anomalous Hall signal. Application of our proposal to the\nrecently discovered TaAs family of Weyl semimetals leads to an\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the photoinduced Hall conductivity which is\nwithin the experimentally accessible range.\n", "  The elastoresistivity tensor $m_{ij,kl}$ characterizes changes in a\nmaterial's resistivity due to strain. As a fourth-rank tensor,\nelastoresistivity can be a uniquely useful probe of the symmetries and\ncharacter of the electronic state of a solid. We present a symmetry analysis of\n$m_{ij,kl}$ (both in the presence and absence of a magnetic field) based on the\ncrystalline point group, focusing for pedagogic purposes on the $D_{4h}$ point\ngroup (of relevance to several materials of current interest). We also discuss\nthe relation between $m_{ij,kl}$ and various thermodynamic susceptibilities,\nparticularly where they are sensitive to critical fluctuations proximate to a\ncritical point at which a point group symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the early stage of the generation of waves by a\nturbulent wind at the surface of a viscous liquid. The spatio-temporal\nstructure of the surface deformation is analyzed by the optical method Free\nSurface Synthetic Schlieren, which allows for time-resolved measurements with a\nmicrometric accuracy. Because of the high viscosity of the liquid, the flow\ninduced by the turbulent wind in the liquid remains laminar, with weak surface\ndrift velocity. Two regimes of deformation of the liquid-air interface are\nidentified. In the first regime, at low wind speed, the surface is dominated by\nrapidly propagating disorganized wrinkles, elongated in the streamwise\ndirection, which can be interpreted as the surface response to the pressure\nfluctuations advected by the turbulent airflow. The amplitude of these\ndeformations increases approximately linearly with wind velocity and are\nessentially independent of the fetch (distance along the channel). Above a\nthreshold in wind speed, the perturbations organize themselves spatially into\nquasi parallel waves perpendicular to the wind direction with their amplitude\nincreasing downstream. In this second regime, the wave amplitude increases with\nwind speed but far more quickly than in the first regime.\n", "  Leakage errors occur when a quantum system leaves the two-level qubit\nsubspace. Reducing these errors is critically important for quantum error\ncorrection to be viable. To quantify leakage errors, we use randomized\nbenchmarking in conjunction with measurement of the leakage population. We\ncharacterize single qubit gates in a superconducting qubit, and by refining our\nuse of Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse shaping along with\ndetuning of the pulses, we obtain gate errors consistently below $10^{-3}$ and\nleakage rates at the $10^{-5}$ level. With the control optimized, we find that\na significant portion of the remaining leakage is due to incoherent heating of\nthe qubit.\n", "  Intensive concerns about the biosafety of nanomaterials demand the systematic\nstudy of the mechanisms about their biological effects. Many biological effects\ncan be attributed to the interaction of nanomaterials with protein and their\nimpacts on protein function. On the other hand, nanomaterials exhibit the\npotential in a variety of biomedical applications, many of which also involve\nthe direct interaction with protein. In this paper, we review some recent\ncomputational studies about this subject, especially the interaction of carbon\nand gold nanomaterials. Besides the hydrophobic and {\\pi}-stacking\ninteractions, the interaction mode of carbon nanomaterials can be regulated by\ntheir functional groups. And the coating of gold nanomaterials also adjusts\ntheir interaction mode, in addition to the coordination interaction with\ncysteine's sulfur group and histidine's imidazole group. Moreover,\nnanomaterials can interact with multiple proteins and the impacts on protein\nactivity are attributed to a wide spectrum of mechanisms. The findings about\nthe mechanisms of nanomaterial-protein interaction can further guide the design\nand development of nanomaterial to realize the applications in disease\ndiagnosis and treatment.\n", "  Recent works have explored the properties of L\\'evy flights with resetting in\none-dimensional domains and have reported the existence of phase transitions in\nthe phase space of parameters which minimizes the Mean First Passage Time\n(MFPT) through the origin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 220602 (2014)]. Here we show\nhow actually an interesting dynamics, including also phase transitions for the\nminimization of the MFPT, can also be obtained without invoking the use of\nL\\'evy statistics but for the simpler case of random walks with exponentially\ndistributed flights of constant speed. We explore this dynamics both in the\ncase of finite and infinite domains, and for different implementations of the\nresetting mechanism to show that different ways to introduce resetting\nconsistently lead to a quite similar dynamics. The use of exponential flights\nhas the strong advantage that exact solutions can be obtained easily for the\nMFPT through the origin, so a complete analytical characterization of the\nsystem dynamics can be provided. Furthermore, we discuss in detail how the\nphase transitions observed in random walks with resetting are closely related\nto several ideas recurrently used in the field of random search theory, in\nparticular to other mechanisms proposed to understand random search in space as\nmortal random-walks or multi-scale random-walks. As a whole we corroborate that\none of the essential ingredients behind MFPT minimization lies in the\ncombination of multiple movement scales (whatever its origin).\n", "  We analyze nonlocally coupled networks of identical chaotic oscillators with\neither time-discrete or time-continuous dynamics (Henon map, Lozi map, Lorenz\nsystem). We hypothesize that chimera states, in which spatial domains of\ncoherent (synchronous) and incoherent (desynchronized) dynamics coexist, can be\nobtained only in networks of nonhyperbolic chaotic systems and cannot be found\nin networks of hyperbolic systems. This hypothesis is supported by analytical\nresults and numerical simulations for hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic cases.\n", "  We report a cascaded optical link of 1100 km for ultra-stable frequency\ndistribution over an Internet fiber network. The link is composed of four spans\nfor which the propagation noise is actively compensated. The robustness and the\nperformance of the link are ensured by five fully automated optoelectronic\nstations, two of them at the link ends, and three deployed on the field and\nconnecting the spans. This device coherently regenerates the optical signal\nwith the heterodyne optical phase locking of a low-noise laser diode. Optical\ndetection of the beat-note signals for the laser lock and the link noise\ncompensation are obtained with stable and low-noise fibered optical\ninterferometer. We show 3.5 days of continuous operation of the\nnoise-compensated 4-span cascaded link leading to fractional frequency\ninstability of 4x10-16 at 1-s measurement time and 1x10-19 at 2000 s. This\ncascaded link was extended to 1480-km with the same performance. This work is a\nsignificant step towards a sustainable wide area ultra-stable optical frequency\ndistribution and comparison network at a very high level of performance.\n", "  We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of two quaternary\nHeusler alloys CoFeCrGe (CFCG) and CoMnCrAl (CMCA), promising candidates for\nspintronics applications. Magnetization measurement shows the saturation\nmagnetization and transition temperature to be $3\\; \\mu_B$, $866$ K and $0.9 \\;\n\\mu_B$, $358$ K for CFCG and CMCA respectively. The magnetization values agree\nfairly well with our theoretical results and also obey the Slater-Pauling rule,\na prerequisite for half metallicity. A striking difference between the two\nsystems is their structure; CFCG crystallizes in fully ordered Y-type structure\nwhile CMCA has L2$_1$ disordered structure. The antisite disorder adds a\nsomewhat unique property to the second compound, which arises due to the\nprobabilistic mutual exchange of Al positions with Cr/Mn and such an effect is\npossibly expected due to comparable electronegativities of Al and Cr/Mn. {\\it\nAb-initio} simulation predicted a unique transition from half metallic\nferromagnet to metallic antiferromagnet beyond a critical excess amount of Al\nin the alloy.\n", "  Probabilities for two-neutron transfer reactions, $P_{\\rm 2n}$, are often\ndiscussed in comparison with the square of the corresponding probabilities for\none-neutron transfer process, $(P_{\\rm 1n})^2$, implicitly assuming that\n$(P_{\\rm 1n})^2$ provides the probability of two-neutron transfer reactions in\nthe absence of the pairing correlation. We use a schematic coupled-channels\nmodel, in which the transfers are treated as effective inelastic channels, and\ndemonstrate that this model leads to $P_{\\rm 2n}=(P_{\\rm 1n})^2/4$, rather than\n$P_{\\rm 2n}=(P_{\\rm 1n})^2$, in the pure sequential limit. We argue that a\nsimple model with spin-up and spin-down neutrons in a single-particle orbital\nalso leads to the same conclusion.\n", "  The transition to turbulence in a precessing cylindrical vessel is\nexperimentally investigated. Our measurements are performed for a {\nnearly-resonant} configuration with an initially laminar flow dominated by an\ninertial mode with azimuthal wave number $m=1$ superimposed on a solid body\nrotation. By increasing the precession ratio, we observe a transition from the\nlaminar to a non-linear regime, which then breakdowns to turbulence for larger\nprecession ratio. Our measurements show that the transition to turbulence is\nsubcritical, with a discontinuity of the wall-pressure and the power\nconsumption at the threshold $\\epsilon_{LT}$. The turbulence is self-sustained\nbelow this threshold, describing a bifurcation diagram with a hysteresis. In\nthis range of the control parameters, the turbulent flows can suddenly collapse\nafter a finite duration, leading to a definitive relaminarization of the flow.\nThe average lifetime $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ of the turbulence increases rapidly\nwhen $\\epsilon$ tends to $\\epsilon_{LT}$.\n", "  QCD sum rules serve as tools to investigate changing hadronic properties in a\nhot and/or dense nuclear medium. The role of chiral symmetry breaking and\nrestoration effects in a medium can be addressed also in the heavy-light meson\nsector. Thus, we consider Weinberg sum rules which refer to chiral partner\nmesons composed of a light and a heavy quark.\n", "  The optical aberrations of a system can be described in terms of the wave\naberrations, defined as the departure from the ideal spherical wavefront; or\nthe ray aberrations, which are in turn the deviations from the paraxial ray\nintersection measured in the image plane. The classical connection between the\ntwo descriptions is an approximation, the error of which has, so far, not been\nquantified analytically. We derive exact analytical equations for computing the\nwavefront surface, the aberrated ray directions, and the transverse ray\naberrations in terms of the wave aberrations (OPD) and the reference sphere. We\nintroduce precise conditions for a function to be an OPD function, show that\nevery such function has an associated wavefront, and study the error arising\nfrom the classical approximation. We establish strict conditions for the error\nto be small. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. Our results\nshow that large numerical apertures and high-frequency OPD functions yield\nlarger approximation errors.\n", "  The renormalizability of the Yang-Mills quantum field theory in\nfour-dimensional space-time is discussed in the background field formalism.\n", "  People in modern societies form different social networks through numerous\nmeans of communication. These communication networks reflect different aspects\nof human's societal structure. The billing records of calls among mobile phone\nusers enable us to construct a directed calling network (DCN) and its\nBonferroni network (SVDCN) in which the preferential communications are\nstatistically validated. Here we perform a comparative investigation of the\ncliques of the original DCN and its SVDCN constructed from the calling records\nof more than nine million individuals in Shanghai over a period of 110 days. We\nfind that the statistical properties of the cliques of the two calling networks\nare qualitatively similar and the clique members in the DCN and the SVDCN\nexhibit idiosyncratic behaviors quantitatively. Members in large cliques are\nfound to be spatially close to each other. Based on the clique degree profile\nof each mobile phone user, the most active users in the two calling networks\ncan be classified in to several groups. The users in different groups are found\nto have different calling behaviors. Our study unveils interesting\ncommunication behaviors among mobile phone users that are densely connected to\neach other.\n", "  We perform classical molecular dynamics to investigate the effects of\nmechanical strain on single-layer black phosphorus nanoresonators at different\ntemperatures. We find that the resonant frequency is highly anisotropic in\nblack phosphorus due to its intrinsic puckered configuration, and that the\nquality factor in the armchair direction is higher than in the zigzag direction\nat room temperature. The quality factors are also found to be intrinsically\nlarger than graphene and MoS2 nanoresonators. The quality factors can be\nincreased by more than a factor of two by applying tensile strain, with\nuniaxial strain in the armchair direction being most effective. However, there\nis an upper bound for the quality factor increase due to nonlinear effects at\nlarge strains, after which the quality factor decreases. The tension induced\nnonlinear effect is stronger along the zigzag direction, resulting in a smaller\nmaximum strain for quality factor enhancement.\n", "  The two key observables related to heavy quarks that have been measured in\nRHIC and LHC energies are the nuclear suppression factor $R_{AA}$ and the\nelliptic flow $v_2$. Simultaneous description of these two observables is a top\nchallenge for all the existing models. We have highlighted how a consistent\ncombination of four ingredients i.e the temperature dependence of the energy\nloss, full solution of the Boltzmann collision integral for the momentum\nevolution of heavy quark, hadronization by coalescence, then the hadronic\nrescattering, responsible to address a large part of such a puzzle. We have\nconsidered four different models to evaluate the temperature dependence of drag\ncoefficients of the heavy quark in QGP. All these four different models are set\nto reproduce the same $R_{AA}$ as of the experiments. We have shown that for\nthe same $R_{AA}$, the $v_2$ could be quite different depending on the\ninteraction dynamics as well as other ingredients.\n", "  We construct and analyze nonsupersymmetric SO(10) standard model extensions\nwhich explain dark matter (DM) through the fermionic Higgs portal. In these\nSO(10)-based models the DM particle is naturally stable since a $Z_2$ discrete\nsymmetry, the matter parity, is left at the end of the symmetry breaking chain\nto the standard model. Potentially realistic models contain the $\\bf{10}$ and\n$\\bf{45}$ fermionic representations from which a neutralino-like mass matrix\nwith arbitrary mixings can be obtained. Two different SO(10) breaking chains\nwill be analyzed in light of gauge coupling unification: the standard path\n$\\text{SU}(5)\\times U(1)_{X}$ and the left-right symmetry intermediate chain.\nThe former opens the possibility of a split supersymmetric-like spectrum with\nan additional (inert) scalar doublet, while the later requires additional\nexotic scalar representations associated to the breaking of the left-right\nsymmetry.\n", "  We build the minimal supergravity model where the nilpotent chiral goldstino\nsuperfield is coupled to a chiral matter superfield, realising a different\nnon-linear representation through a mixed nilpotency constraint. The model\ndescribes the spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry in the presence of a\ngenerically massive Majorana fermion, but in the absence of elementary scalars.\nThe sign and the size of the cosmological constant, the spectrum and the\nfour-fermion interactions are controlled by suitable parameters.\n", "  We reproduce the galaxy clustering catalogue from the SDSS-III Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey Final Data Release (BOSS DR11&DR12) with high\nfidelity on all relevant scales in order to allow a robust analysis of baryon\nacoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions. We have generated (6,000)\n12,288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light-cones corresponding to an\neffective volume of $\\sim192,000\\,[h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Gpc}]^3$ (the largest ever\nsimulated volume), including cosmic evolution in the redshift range from 0.15\nto 0.75. The mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue\nbased on the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11&DR12 galaxy\nclustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three steps.\nFirst, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object\ndistribution including nonlinear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the\nhalo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the\nvarious objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local\ndensity and non-local indicators (i.e., tidal field tensor eigenvalues and\nrelative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference\nsimulation applied to the corresponding PATCHY dark matter and galaxy\ndistribution. Finally, we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The\nresulting MultiDark PATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density,\nselection function, survey geometry, and in general within 1 $\\sigma$, for\narbitrary stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to $k=0.3\\,h\\,{\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$, the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and\nthe three-point statistics of the BOSS DR11&DR12 galaxy samples.\n", "  We present the micro-photoluminescence ($\\mu$PL) and micro-reflectance\ncontrast spectroscopy studies on thin films of MoSe2 with layer thicknesses\nranging from a monolayer (1L) up to 5L. The thickness dependent evolution of\nthe ground and excited state excitonic transitions taking place at various\npoints of the Brillouin zone is determined. Temperature activated energy shifts\nand linewidth broadenings of the excitonic resonances in 1L, 2L and 3L flakes\nare accounted for by using standard formalisms previously developed for\nsemiconductors. A peculiar shape of the optical response of the ground state\n(A) exciton in monolayer MoSe2 is tentatively attributed to the appearance of\nFano-type resonance. Rather trivial and clearly decaying PL spectra of\nmonolayer MoSe2 with temperature confirm that the ground state exciton in this\nmaterial is optically bright in contrast to a dark exciton ground state in\nmonolayer WSe2.\n", "  A nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is obtained in the continuous limit of a\none-dimensional lattice with an energy landscape of wells and barriers.\nInteraction is possible among particles in the same energy well. A parameter\n$\\gamma$, related to the barrier's heights, is introduced. Its value is\ndeterminant for the functional dependence of the mobility and diffusion\ncoefficient on particle concentration, but has no influence on the equilibrium\nsolution. A relation between the mean field potential and the microscopic\ninteraction energy is derived. The results are illustrated with classical\nparticles with interactions that reproduce fermion and boson statistics.\n", "  We report on the design of a serializer ASIC to be used in the ATLAS forward\nmuon detector for trigger data transmission. We discuss the performance of a\nprototype chip covering power dissipation, latency and stable operating line\nrate. Tests show that the serializer is capable of running at least at 5.76\nGbps with a bit error ratio below 1x10^{-15}, and a power consumption of 200 mW\nrunning at 4.8 Gbps. The latency between the start of loading 30 bits into the\nserializer to the transmission of the first bit from the serializer is measured\nto be about 6 ns.\n", "  We construct the spin flaglet transform, a wavelet transform to analyze spin\nsignals in three dimensions. Spin flaglets can probe signal content localized\nsimultaneously in space and frequency and, moreover, are separable so that\ntheir angular and radial properties can be controlled independently. They are\nparticularly suited to analyzing of cosmological observations such as the weak\ngravitational lensing of galaxies. Such observations have a unique 3D\ngeometrical setting since they are natively made on the sky, have spin angular\nsymmetries, and are extended in the radial direction by additional distance or\nredshift information. Flaglets are constructed in the harmonic space defined by\nthe Fourier-Laguerre transform, previously defined for scalar functions and\nextended here to signals with spin symmetries. Thanks to various sampling\ntheorems, both the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are theoretically\nexact when applied to bandlimited signals. In other words, in numerical\ncomputations the only loss of information is due to the finite representation\nof floating point numbers. We develop a 3D framework relating the weak lensing\npower spectrum to covariances of flaglet coefficients. We suggest that the\nresulting novel flaglet weak lensing estimator offers a powerful alternative to\ncommon 2D and 3D approaches to accurately capture cosmological information.\nWhile standard weak lensing analyses focus on either real or harmonic space\nrepresentations (i.e., correlation functions or Fourier-Bessel power spectra,\nrespectively), a wavelet approach inherits the advantages of both techniques,\nwhere both complicated sky coverage and uncertainties associated with the\nphysical modeling of small scales can be handled effectively. Our codes to\ncompute the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are made publicly\navailable.\n", "  We study the extended phase space thermodynamics for hairy AdS black hole\nsolutions to Einstein-Maxwell-$\\Lambda$ theory conformally coupled to a scalar\nfield in five dimensions. We find these solutions to exhibit van der Waals\nbehaviour in both the charged/uncharged cases, and reentrant phase transitions\nin the charged case. This is the first example of reentrant phase transitions\nin a five dimensional gravitational system which does not include higher\ncurvature corrections.\n", "  We describe a cryogenic instrumentation platform incorporating\ncommercially-available field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) configured to\noperate well beyond their specified temperature range. The instrument enables\nsignal routing, multiplexing, and complex digital signal processing at\ntemperatures approaching 4 kelvin and in close proximity to cooled devices or\ndetectors within the cryostat. The cryogenic performance of the system is\nevaluated, including clock speed, error rates, and power consumption. Although\nconstructed for the purpose of controlling and reading out quantum computing\ndevices with low latency, the instrument is generic enough to be of broad use\nin a range of cryogenic applications.\n", "  We report the observed photon bunching statistics of biexciton cascade\nemission at zero time delay in single quantum dots by second-order correlation\nfunction measurements under continuous wave excitation. It is found that the\nbunching phenomenon is independent of the biexciton binding energy when it\nvaries from 0.59 meV to nearly zero. The photon bunching takes place when the\nexciton photon is not spectrally distinguishable from biexciton photon, and\neither of them can trigger the start in a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss setup.\nHowever, if the exciton energy is spectrally distinguishable from the biexciton\nthe photon statistics becomes asymmetric and a cross-bunching lineshape is\nobtained. The theoretical calculations based on a model of three-level\nrate-equation analysis are consistent with the result of second-order\ncorrelation function measurements.\n", "  Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of zinc oxide (ZnO) samples with different\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment durations were measured to examine several\npoint defects on the surface of the films. These results suggest successful\noxidation through the reaction between oxygen radicals dissociated from H2O2\nand the ZnO surface. To further confirm the defect induced gain mechanism, we\nfabricate highly transparent Schottky diodes, and measure the key diode\ncharacteristics. Photocurrents are measured under different wavelengths, and\npossible explanations of the high optical gain within the ultraviolet (UV)\nregion are provided.\n", "  The neutron flux at low energy ($E_n\\leq15$ MeV) resulting from the\nradioactivity of the rock in the underground cavern of the India-based Neutrino\nObservatory is estimated using Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations. The\nneutron production rate due to the spontaneous fission of $^{235, 238}$U,\n$^{232}$Th and ($\\alpha, n$) interactions in the rock is determined employing\nthe actual rock composition. It is been shown that the total flux is equivalent\nto a finite size cylindrical rock ($D=L=140$ cm) element. The energy integrated\nneutron flux thus obtained at the centre of the underground tunnel is 2.76\n(0.47) $\\times 10^{-6}\\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. The estimated neutron flux is of\nthe same order ($\\sim10^{-6}\\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$)~as measured in other\nunderground laboratories.\n", "  Microbubbles, either in the form of free gas bubbles surrounded by a fluid or\nencapsulated bubbles used currently as contrast agents for medical echography,\nexhibit complex dynamics under specific acoustic excitations. Nonetheless,\nconsidering their micron size and the complexity of their interaction\nphenomenon with ultrasound waves, expensive and complex experiments and/or\nsimulations are required for their analysis. The behavior of a microbubble\nalong its equator can be linked to a system of coupled oscillators. In this\nstudy, the oscillatory behavior of a microbubble has been investigated through\nan acousto-mechanical analogy based on a ring-shaped chain of coupled pendula.\nObservation of parametric vibration modes of the pendula ring excited at\nfrequencies between $1$ and $5$ Hz is presented. Simulations have been carried\nout and show mode mixing phenomena. The relevance of the analogy between a\nmicrobubble and the macroscopic acousto-mechanical setup is discussed and\nsuggested as an alternative way to investigate the complexity of microbubble\ndynamics.\n", "  We perform saturated absorption spectroscopy on the D$\\_2$ line for room\ntemperature rubidium atoms immersed in magnetic fields within the 0.05-0.13 T\nrange. At those medium-high field values the hyperfine structure in the excited\nstate is broken by the Zeeman effect, while in the ground state hyperfine\nstructure and Zeeman shifts are comparable. The observed spectra are composed\nby a large number of absorption lines. We identify them as saturated\nabsorptions on two-level systems, on three-level systems in a V configuration\nand on four-level systems in a N or double-N configuration where two optical\ntransitions not sharing a common level are coupled by spontaneous emission\ndecays. We analyze the intensity of all those transitions within a unified\nsimple theoretical model. We concentrate our attention on the double-N\ncrossovers signals whose intensity is very large because of the symmetry in the\nbranching ratios of the four levels. We point out that these structures,\npresent in all alkali atoms at medium-high magnetic fields, have interesting\nproperties for electromagnetically induced transparency and slow light\napplications.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the structural, electronic,\nand optical properties of an $m$-plane (In,Ga)N/GaN quantum well structure\ngrown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. The sample has been structurally\ncharacterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy,\nand 3D atom probe tomography. The optical properties of the sample have been\nstudied by photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL spectroscopy, and polarized\nPL excitation spectroscopy. The PL spectrum consisted of a very broad PL line\nwith a high degree of optical linear polarization. To understand the optical\nproperties we have performed atomistic tight-binding calculations, and based on\nour initial atom probe tomography data, the model includes the effects of\nstrain and built-in field variations arising from random alloy fluctuations.\nFurthermore, we included Coulomb effects in the calculations. Our microscopic\ntheoretical description reveals strong hole wave function localization effects\ndue to random alloy fluctuations, resulting in strong variations in ground\nstate energies and consequently the corresponding transition energies. This is\nconsistent with the experimentally observed broad PL peak. Furthermore, when\nincluding Coulomb contributions in the calculations we find strong exciton\nlocalization effects which explain the form of the PL decay transients.\nAdditionally, the theoretical results confirm the experimentally observed high\ndegree of optical linear polarization. Overall, the theoretical data are in\nvery good agreement with the experimental findings, highlighting the strong\nimpact of the microscopic alloy structure on the optoelectronic properties of\nthese systems.\n", "  We propose a novel method to study flavor-changing neutral currents in the\n$e^+e^-\\to D^{*0}$ and $e^+e^-\\to B_{s}^* $ transitions, tuning the energy of\n$e^+e^-$- collisions to the mass of the narrow vector resonance $D^{*0}$ or $\nB_{s}^*$. We present a thorough study of both short-distance and long-distance\ncontributions to $e^+e^-\\to D^{*0}$ in the Standard Model and investigate\npossible contributions of new physics in the charm sector. This process, albeit\nvery rare, has clear advantages with respect to the $D^0 \\to e^+e^-$ decay: the\nhelicity suppression is absent, and a richer set of effective operators can be\nprobed. Implications of the same proposal for $B_{s}^*$ are also discussed.\n", "  Witnessing continuous-variable Bell nonlocality is a challenging endeavor,\nbut Bell himself showed how one might demonstrate this nonlocality. Though Bell\nnearly showed a violation using the CHSH inequality with sign-binned\nposition-momentum statistics of entangled pairs of particles measured at\ndifferent times, his demonstration is subject to approximations not realizable\nin a laboratory setting. Moreover, he doesn't give a quantitative estimation of\nthe maximum achievable violation for the wavefunction he considers. In this\narticle, we show how his strategy can be reimagined using the transverse\npositions and momenta of entangled photon pairs measured at different\npropagation distances, and we find that the maximum achievable violation for\nthe state he considers is actually very small relative to the upper limit of\n$2\\sqrt{2}$. Although Bell's wavefunction does not produce a large violation of\nthe CHSH inequality, other states may yet do so.\n", "  In this work we theoretically investigate transverse magnetic focussing in\ntwo dimensional electron and hole gasses with strong spin orbit interactions.\nWe present a general result for spin orbit interaction with singular winding\nnumbers in the adiabatic limit. We then present results for systems with two\nspin orbit interactions of different winding number appear, using the concrete\nand experimentally relevant case of an applied in-plane magnetic field in hole\nsystems with Rashba type interactions. We predict that the application of a\nlarge in-plane field is found to have a strong effect on the magnetic focussing\nspectrum.\n", "  A symmetry violation model is considered for a system that can spontaneously\nchoose between identical states which differ from each other only in weak\nproperties (R-L). Such mirror symmetry allows reproduction of observed\nqualitative properties of quark and lepton mixing matrices. The lepton mixing\nmatrix evidences in this case in favor of the inverse mass spectrum and the\nDirac nature of SM neutrino. Notwithstanding the Dirac properties of neutrino,\nan exchange of lepton numbers such as $e^{-}+\\mu^{+}\\rightarrow e^{+}+\\mu^{-}$\nis possible but with only leptons participating in the process.\n", "  We study supersymmetry of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions\ndeformed in the Omega-background. We take the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the\nbackground so that two-dimensional super Poincare symmetry is recovered. We\ncompute the deformed central charge of the superalgebra and study the 1/2 and\n1/4 BPS states. We obtain the Omega-deformed 1/2 and 1/4 BPS dyon equations\nfrom the deformed supersymmetry transformation and the Bogomol'nyi completion\nof the energy.\n", "  We study the case of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric perturbations of Hermitian\nHamiltonians with degenerate eigenvalues using the example of a triple-well\nsystem. The degeneracy complicates the question, whether or not a stationary\ncurrent through such a system can be established, i.e.\\ whether or not the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric states are stable. It is shown that this is only the\ncase for perturbations that do not couple to any of the degenerate states. The\nphysical explanation for the inhibition of stable currents is discussed.\nHowever, introducing an on-site interaction restores the capability to support\nstable currents.\n", "  We use ab initio simulations to investigate the incorporation of pyridine\nmolecules (C$_5$H$_5$N) in the van der Waals gaps of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. The\nintercalated pyridine molecules increase the separation distance between the\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ quintuple layers (QLs), suppressing the parity inversion of the\nelectronic states at the $\\Gamma$-point. We find that the intercalated region\nbecomes a trivial insulator. By combining the pristine Bi$_2$Se$_3$ region with\nthe one intercalated by the molecules, we have a non-trivial/trivial\nheterojunction characterized by the presence of (topologically protected)\nmetallic states at the interfacial region. Next we apply an external\ncompressive pressure to the system, and the results are (i) a decrease on the\nseparation distance between the QLs intercalated by pyridine molecules, and\n(ii) the metallic states are shifted toward the bulk region, turning the system\nback to insulator. That is, through a suitable tuning of the external pressure\nin Bi$_2$Se$_3$, intercalated by pyridine molecules, we can control its\ntopological properties; turning-on and -off the topologically protected\nmetallic states lying at the non-trivial/trivial interface.\n", "  We describe the oligosaccharides-exchange dynamics performed by so-called\nD-enzymes on polysaccharides. To mimic physiological conditions, we treat this\nprocess as an open chemical network by assuming some of the polymer\nconcentrations fixed (chemostatting). We show that three different long-time\nbehaviors may ensue: equilibrium states, nonequilibrium steady states, and\ncontinuous growth states. We dynamically and thermodynamically characterize\nthese states and emphasize the crucial role of conservation laws in identifying\nthe chemostatting conditions inducing them.\n", "  We compare polarization properties of the cyclotron, and relativistic dipole\nradiation of electrons moving in the magnetic field on a helix with\nultra-relativistic longitudinal and non-relativistic transverse velocity\ncomponents. The applicability of these models in the case of accretion onto a\nneutron star is discussed. The test, based on polarization observations is\nsuggested, to distinguish between the cyclotron, and relativistic dipole origin\nof features, observed in X-ray spectra of some X-ray sources, among which the\nHer X-1 is the most famous.\n", "  Two quantum field theories whose Hilbert spaces do not overlap cannot\ntransmit a signal to one another. From this simple principle, we deduce some\nhighly nontrivial consequences for holographic quantum gravity. These include:\n(1) certain cosmological bounces are forbidden, (2) generic singularities\ninside black holes cannot be resolved, and (3) traversable wormholes do not\nexist. At the classical level, this principle rules out certain types of naked\nsingularities and suggests that new singularity theorems should exist.\n", "  Using a quantum map version of one-dimensional Anderson model, the\nlocalization-delocalization transition of quantum diffusion induced by coherent\ndynamical perturbation is investigated in comparison with quantum standard map.\nExistence of critical phenomena, which depends on the number of frequency\ncomponent $M$, is demonstrated. Diffusion exponents agree with theoretical\nprediction for the transition, but the critical exponent of the localization\nlength deviates from it with increase in the $M$. The critical power\n$\\epsilon_c$ of the normalized perturbation at the transition point remarkably\ndecreases as $\\epsilon_c \\sim (M-1)^{-1}$.\n", "  We report calculations of energy levels and radiative rates ($A$-values) for\ntransitions in Cr-like Co IV and Ni V. The quasi-relativistic Hartree-Fock\n(QRHF) code is adopted for calculating the data although GRASP (general-purpose\nrelativistic atomic structure package) and flexible atomic code (FAC) have also\nbeen employed for comparison purposes. No radiative rates are available in the\nliterature to compare with our results, but our calculated energies are in\nclose agreement with those compiled by NIST for a majority of the levels.\nHowever, there are discrepancies for a few levels of up to 3\\%. The $A$-values\nare listed for all significantly contributing E1, E2 and M1 transitions, and\nthe corresponding lifetimes reported, although unfortunately no previous\ntheoretical or experimental results exist to compare with our data.\n", "  High-scale string inflationary models are in well-known tension with\nlow-energy supersymmetry. A promising solution involves models where the\ninflaton is the volume of the extra dimensions so that the gravitino mass\nrelaxes from large values during inflation to smaller values today. We describe\na possible microscopic origin of the scalar potential of volume modulus\ninflation by exploiting non-perturbative effects, string loop and higher\nderivative perturbative corrections to the supergravity effective action\ntogether with contributions from anti-branes and charged hidden matter fields.\nWe also analyse the relation between the size of the flux superpotential and\nthe position of the late-time minimum and the inflection point around which\ninflation takes place. We perform a detailed study of the inflationary dynamics\nfor a single modulus and a two moduli case where we also analyse the\nsensitivity of the cosmological observables on the choice of initial\nconditions.\n", "  I propose an expression for the electromagnetic wave impedance of a\ntwo-dimensional atomic crystal, and I deduce the Fresnel coefficients in terms\nof this quantity. It is widely known that a two-dimensional crystal can absorb\nlight, if its conductivity is different from zero. It is less emphasized that\nthey can also store a certain amount of electromagnetic energy. The concept of\nimpedance is useful to quantify this point.\n", "  The existence of strongly bound excitons is one of the hallmarks of the newly\ndiscovered atomically thin semi-conductors. While it is understood that the\nlarge binding energy is mainly due to the weak dielectric screening in two\ndimensions (2D), a systematic investigation of the role of screening on 2D\nexcitons is still lacking. Here we provide a critical assessment of a widely\nused 2D hydrogenic exciton model which assumes a dielectric function of the\nform {\\epsilon}(q) = 1 + 2{\\pi}{\\alpha}q, and we develop a quasi-2D model with\na much broader applicability. Within the quasi-2D picture, electrons and holes\nare described as in-plane point charges with a finite extension in the\nperpendicular direction and their interaction is screened by a dielectric\nfunction with a non-linear q-dependence which is computed ab-initio. The\nscreened interaction is used in a generalized Mott-Wannier model to calculate\nexciton binding energies in both isolated and supported 2D materials. For\nisolated 2D materials, the quasi-2D treatment yields results almost identical\nto those of the strict 2D model and both are in good agreement with ab-initio\nmany-body calculations. On the other hand, for more complex structures such as\nsupported layers or layers embedded in a van der Waals heterostructure, the\nsize of the exciton in reciprocal space extends well beyond the linear regime\nof the dielectric function and a quasi-2D description has to replace the 2D\none. Our methodology has the merit of providing a seamless connection between\nthe strict 2D limit of isolated monolayer materials and the more bulk-like\nscreening characteristics of supported 2D materials or van der Waals\nheterostructures.\n", "  We use the amplitude expansion in the phase field crystal framework to\nformulate an approach where the fields describing the microscopic structure of\nthe material are coupled to a hydrodynamic velocity field. The model is shown\nto reduce to the well known macroscopic theories in appropriate limits,\nincluding compressible Navier-Stokes and wave equations. Moreover, we show that\nthe dynamics proposed allows for long wavelength phonon modes and demonstrate\nthe theory numerically showing that the elastic excitations in the system are\nrelaxed through phonon emission.\n", "  We present a new effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian with next-to-leading\norder (NLO) spin-spin coupling for black hole binaries endowed with arbitrarily\noriented spins. The Hamiltonian is based on the model for parallel spins and\nequatorial orbits developed in [Physical Review D 90, 044018 (2014)], but\ndiffers from it in several ways. In particular, the NLO spin-spin coupling is\nnot incorporated by a redefinition of the centrifugal radius $r_c$, but by\nseparately modifying certain sectors of the Hamiltonian, which are identified\naccording to their dependence on the momentum vector. The gauge-fixing\nprocedure we follow allows us to reduce the 25 different terms of the NLO\nspin-spin Hamiltonian in Arnowitt-Deser-Misner coordinates to only 9 EOB terms.\nThis is an improvement with respect to the EOB model recently proposed in\n[Physical Review D 91, 064011 (2015)], where 12 EOB terms were involved.\nAnother important advantage is the remarkably simple momentum structure of the\nspin-spin terms in the effective Hamiltonian, which is simply quadratic up to\nan overall square root. Moreover, a Damour-Jaranowski-Sch\\\"afer-type gauge\ncould be established, thus allowing one to concentrate, in the case of circular\nand equatorial orbits, the whole spin-spin interaction in a single radial\npotential.\n", "  Cosmic-ray-muon spallation-induced radioactive isotopes with $\\beta$ decays\nare one of the major backgrounds for solar, reactor, and supernova relic\nneutrino experiments. Unlike in scintillator, production yields for cosmogenic\nbackgrounds in water have not been exclusively measured before, yet they are\nbecoming more and more important in next generation neutrino experiments\ndesigned to search for rare signals. We have analyzed the low-energy trigger\ndata collected at Super-Kamiokande-IV in order to determine the production\nrates of $^{12}$B, $^{12}$N, $^{16}$N, $^{11}$Be, $^9$Li, $^8$He, $^9$C,\n$^8$Li, $^8$B and $^{15}$C. These rates were extracted from fits to time\ndifferences between parent muons and subsequent daughter $\\beta$'s by fixing\nthe known isotope lifetimes. Since $^9$Li can fake an inverse-beta-decay\nreaction chain via a $\\beta + n$ cascade decay, producing an irreducible\nbackground with detected energy up to a dozen MeV, a dedicated study is needed\nfor evaluating its impact on future measurements; the application of a neutron\ntagging technique using correlated triggers was found to improve this $^9$Li\nmeasurement. The measured yields were generally found to be comparable with\ntheoretical calculations, except the cases of the isotopes $^8$Li/$^8$B and\n$^9$Li.\n", "  We investigate Lefschetz thimble structure of the complexified\npath-integration in the one-dimensional lattice massive Thirring model with\nfinite chemical potential. The lattice model is formulated with staggered\nfermions and a compact auxiliary vector boson (a link field), and the whole set\nof the critical points (the complex saddle points) are sorted out, where each\ncritical point turns out to be in a one-to-one correspondence with a singular\npoint of the effective action (or a zero point of the fermion determinant). For\na subset of critical point solutions in the uniform-field subspace, we examine\nthe upward and downward cycles and the Stokes phenomenon with varying the\nchemical potential, and we identify the intersection numbers to determine the\nthimbles contributing to the path-integration of the partition function. We\nshow that the original integration path becomes equivalent to a single\nLefschetz thimble at small and large chemical potentials, while in the\ncrossover region multi thimbles must contribute to the path integration.\nFinally, reducing the model to a uniform field space, we study the relative\nimportance of multiple thimble contributions and their behavior toward\ncontinuum and low-temperature limits quantitatively, and see how the rapid\ncrossover behavior is recovered by adding the multi thimble contributions at\nlow temperatures. Those findings will be useful for performing Monte-Carlo\nsimulations on the Lefschetz thimbles.\n", "  The probability of the formation and decay of a dinuclear system is\ninvestigated for a wide range of relative orbital angular momentum values. The\nmass and angular distributions of the quasifission fragments are studied to\nunderstand the reaction mechanisms of the heavy ion collision of\n$^{78}$Kr(10$A$ MeV) + $^{40}$Ca within dinuclear system model. The\nquasifission products are found to contribute to the mass-symmetric region of\nthe mass distribution in collisions with a large orbital angular momentum. The\nanalysis of mass and angular distributions of quasifission fragments shows the\npossibility of the $180^\\circ$ rotation of the system so that projectile-like\nproducts can be observed in the forward hemisphere with large cross sections,\nwhich can explain the phenomenon observed recently in the ISODEC experiment.\n", "  The emerging field of on-chip integration of nanophotonic devices and cold\natoms offers extremely-strong and pure light-matter interaction schemes, which\nmay have profound impact on quantum information science. In this context, a\nlong-standing obstacle is to achieve strong interaction between single atoms\nand single photons, while at the same time trap atoms in vacuum at large\nseparation distances from dielectric surfaces. In this work, we study new\nwaveguide geometries that challenge these conflicting objectives. The designed\nphotonic crystal waveguide is expected to offer a good compromise, which\nadditionally allows for easy manipulation of atomic clouds around the\nstructure, while being tolerant to fabrication imperfections.\n", "  In three papers Colbeck and Renner (Nature Communications 2:411, (2011);\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 108, 150402 (2012); arXiv:1208.4123) argued that \"no\nalternative theory compatible with quantum theory and satisfying the freedom of\nchoice assumption can give improved predictions\". We give a more precise\nversion of the formulation and proof of this remarkable claim. Our proof\nbroadly follows theirs, which relies on physically well motivated axioms, but\nto fill in some crucial details certain technical assumptions have had to be\nadded, whose physical status seems somewhat obscure.\n", "  We construct the Q-operator for generalised eight vertex models associated to\nhigher spin representations of the Sklyanin algebra, following Baxter's 1973\npaper. As an application, we prove the sum rule for the Bethe roots.\n", "  The strong $D^{*}_sD_{s}\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ and $B^{*}_sB_{s}\\eta^{(\\prime)}$\nvertices are studied and the relevant couplings are calculated in the context\nof the light-cone QCD sum rule method with twist-4 accuracy by including the\nnext-to-leading order corrections. In the analysis, both the quark and gluon\ncomponents of the $\\eta$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$ mesons and the axial anomaly\ncorrected higher twist distributions are included.\n", "  We present a quantum-field-theoretical framework based on path integrals and\nFeynman diagrams for the investigation of the quantum-optical properties of\none-dimensional waveguiding structures with embedded quantum impurities. In\nparticular, we obtain the Green's functions for a waveguide with an embedded\ntwo-level system in the single- and two-excitation sector for arbitrary\ndispersion relations. In the single excitation sector, we show how to sum the\ndiagrammatic perturbation series to all orders and thus obtain explicit\nexpressions for physical quantities such as the spectral density and the\nscattering matrix. In the two-excitation sector, we show that strictly linear\ndispersion relations exhibit the special property that the corresponding\ndiagrammatic perturbation series terminates after two terms, again allowing for\nclosed-form expressions for physical quantities. In the case of general\ndispersion relations, notably those exhibiting a band edge or waveguide cut-off\nfrequencies, the perturbation series cannot be summed explicitly. Instead, we\nderive a self-consistent T-matrix equation that reduces the computational\neffort to that of a single-excitation computation. This analysis allows us to\nidentify a Fano resonance between the occupied quantum impurity and a free\nphoton in the waveguide as a unique signature of the few-photon nonlinearity\ninherent in such systems. In addition, our diagrammatic approach allows for the\nclassification of different physical processes such as the creation of\nphoton-photon correlations and interaction-induced radiation trapping - the\nlatter being absent for strictly linear dispersion relations. Our framework can\nserve as the basis for further studies that involve more complex scenarios such\nas several and many-level quantum impurities, networks of coupled waveguides,\ndisordered systems, and non-equilibrium effects.\n"]}
