and\nthree-dimensional (3D) media for the case of a two-level model atom without\nlower-level polarization and assuming complete frequency redistribution. The\ntheoretical framework chosen for its formulation is the QED theory of Landi\nDegl'Innocenti (1983), which specifies the excitation state of the atoms in\nterms of the irreducible tensor components of the atomic density matrix. The\nself-consistent values of these density-matrix elements is to be determined by\nsolving jointly the kinetic and radiative transfer equations for the Stokes\nparameters. We show how to achieve this by generalizing to Non-LTE polarization\ntransfer the Jacobi-based ALI method of Olson et al. (1986) and the iterative\nschemes based on Gauss-Seidel iteration of Trujillo Bueno and Fabiani Bendicho\n(1995). These methods essentially maintain the simplicity of the\nLambda-iteration method, but their convergence rate is extremely high. Finally,\nsome 1D and 2D model calculations are presented that illustrate the effect of\nhorizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities on magnetic and non-magnetic resonance\nline polarization signals.\n", "  This chapter reviews progress in the field of massive star formation. It\nfocuses on evidence for accretion and current models that invoke high accretion\nrates. In particular it is noted that high accretion rates will cause the\nmassive young stellar object to have a radius much larger than its eventual\nmain sequence radius throughout much of the accretion phase. This results in\nlow effective temperatures which may provide the explanation as to why luminous\nyoung stellar objects do not ionized their surroundings to form ultra-compact H\nII regions. The transition to the ultra-compact H II region phase would then be\nassociated with the termination of the high accretion rate phase. Objects\nthought to be in a transition phase are discussed and diagnostic diagrams to\ndistinguish between massive young stellar objects and ultra-compact H II\nregions in terms of line widths and radio luminosity are presented.\n", "  We present numerical studies of the properties of the stellar velocity\ndistribution in galactic disks which have developed a saturated, two-armed\nspiral structure. In previous papers we used the Boltzmann moment equations\n(BME) up to second order for our studies of the velocity structure in\nself-gravitating stellar disks. A key assumption of our BME approach is the\nzero-heat flux approximation, i.e. the neglection of third order velocity\nterms. We tested this assumption by performing test particle simulations for\nstars in a disk galaxy subject to a rotating spiral perturbation. As a result\nwe corroborated qualitatively the complex velocity structure found in the BME\napproach. It turned out that an equilibrium configuration in velocity space is\nonly slowly established on a typical timescale of 5 Gyrs or more. Since many\ndynamical processes in galaxies (like the growth of spirals or bars)act on\nshorter timescales, pure equilibrium models might not be fully appropriate for\na detailed comparison with observations like the local Galactic velocity\ndistribution. Third order velocity moments were typically small and\nuncorrelated over almost all of the disk with the exception of the 4:1\nresonance region (UHR). Near the UHR (normalized) fourth and fifth order\nvelocity moments are still of the same order as the second and third order\nterms. Thus, at the UHR higher order terms are not negligible.\n", "  Stars form in embedded star clusters which play a key role in determining the\nproperties of a galaxy's stellar population. Physical mechanisms discussed in\nthis paper are runaway stars shot out from young clusters, binary-star\ndisruption in clusters, gas blow-out from clusters and the origin of thick\ngalactic disks. I emphasise that the SNIa rate per low-mass star depends on the\nstar-clusters formed in a galaxy and I discuss the IGIMF theory. Based on the\nIGIMF theory, the re-calibrated Halpha-luminosity--SFR relation implies dwarf\nirregular galaxies to have the same gas-depletion time-scale as major disk\ngalaxies, suggesting a major change in our understanding of dwarf-galaxy\nevolution. The IGIMF-theory also naturally leads to the observed radial Halpha\ncutoff in disk galaxies without a radial star-formation cutoff. It emerges that\nthe thorough understanding of the physics and distribution of star clusters may\nbe leading to a major paradigm shift in our understanding of galaxy evolution.\n", "  The near orthogonal distributions of dwarf elliptical (dE) and giant\nelliptical (E) galaxies in the mu_e-Mag and mu_e-log(R_e) diagrams have been\ninterpreted as evidence for two distinct galaxy formation processes. However,\ncontinuous, linear relationships across the alleged dE/E boundary at M_B = -18\nmag - such as those between central surface brightness (mu_0) and (i) galaxy\nmagnitude and (ii) light-profile shape (n) - suggest a similar, governing\nformation mechanism. Here we explain how these latter two linear trends\nnecessitate a different behavior for dE and E galaxies, exactly as observed, in\ndiagrams involving mu_e (and also <mu>_e). A natural consequence is that the\ndistribution of dEs and Es in Fundamental Plane type analyses that use the\nassociated intensity I_e, or <I>_e, are expected to appear different. Together\nwith other linear trends across the alleged dE/E boundary, such as those\nbetween luminosity and color, metallicity, and velocity dispersion, it appears\nthat the dEs form a continuous extension to the E galaxies. The presence of\npartially depleted cores in luminous (M_B < -20.5 mag) Es does however signify\nthe action of a different physical process at the centers (< ~300 pc) of these\ngalaxies.\n", "  Tests for the intrinsic shape of the luminosity distribution in elliptical\ngalaxies are discussed, with an emphasis on the uncertainties. Recent\ndeterminations of the ellipticity frequency function imply a paucity of nearly\nspherical galaxies, and may be inconsistent with the oblate hypothesis.\nStatistical tests based on the correlation of surface brightness, isophotal\ntwisting, and minor axis rotation with ellipticity have so far not provided\nstrong evidence in favor of the nearly oblate or nearly prolate hypothesis, but\nare at least qualitatively consistent with triaxiality. The possibility that\nthe observed deviations of elliptical galaxy isophotes form ellipses are due to\nprojection effects is evaluated. Dynamical instabilities may explain the\nabsence of elliptical galaxies flatter than about E6, and my also play a role\nin the lack of nearly-spherical galaxies.\n", "  Pulsating variable stars can be powerful tools to study the structure,\nformation and evolution of galaxies. I discuss the role that the Magellanic\nClouds' pulsating variables play in our understanding of the whole Magellanic\nSystem, in light of results on pulsating variables produced by extensive\nobserving campaigns like the MACHO and OGLE microlensing surveys. In this\ncontext, I also briefly outline the promise of new surveys and astrometric\nmissions which will target the Clouds in the near future.\n", "  During Solar Cycle 23, some active regions(ARs) produced extremely energetic\nflares and CMEs. These ARs are expected to be characteristically distinct as\ncompared to dormant ARs and quiet regions (QRs). It would be interesting to\nidentify whether the internal structure and dynamics of the ARs is related to\ntheir flaring/CME activity levels. For this investigation, we have obtained\nsub-surface velocity flows in several ARs and QRs using the ring diagram\ntechnique, and then derived the corresponding vorticity vector and kinetic\nhelicity density.\n", "  The project AMIGA (Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies)\nprovides a statistically significant sample of the most isolated galaxies in\nthe northern sky. Such a control sample is necessary to understand the role of\nthe environment in evolution and galaxy properties like the interstellar medium\n(ISM), star formation and nuclear activity. The data is publicly released under\na VO interface at http://amiga.iaa.es/. One of our main goals is the study of\nnuclear activity in non-interacting galaxies using different methods. We focus\non the well known radiocontinuum-far infrared (FIR) correlation in order to\nfindradio-excess galaxies which are candidates to host an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) and FIR colours to find obscured AGN candidates. We looked for\nthe existing information on nuclear activity in the V\\'eron-Cetty catalogue and\nin the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED). We also used the nuclear spectra from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey which allow us to determine the possible presence\nof an AGN and to study the properties of the underlying stellar populations. We\nproduced a final catalogue of AGN-candidate galaxies which will provide a\nbaseline for the study of the nuclear activity depending on the environment. We\nfind that the fraction of FIR selected AGN-candidates ranges between 7% and\n20%. There are no radio-excess galaxies in our sample above a factor 5 of radio\nexcess which is the lowest rate found in comparison with other samples in\ndenser environments. Finally, we obtained a fraction of about 22% of AGN using\nthe optical spectra, a significant fraction for a sample of isolated galaxies.\nWe conclude that the environment plays a crucial and direct role in triggering\nradio nuclear activity and not only via the density-morphology or the\ndensity-luminosity relations.\n", "  We present the first near infrared Hubble diagram for type II-P supernovae to\nfurther explore their value as distance indicators. We use a modified version\nof the standardised candle method which relies on the tight correlation between\nthe absolute magnitudes of type II-P supernovae and their expansion velocities\nduring the plateau phase. Although our sample contains only 12 II-P supernovae\nand they are necessarily local (z < 0.02), we demonstrate using near infrared\nJHK photometry that it may be possible to reduce the scatter in the Hubble\ndiagram to 0.1-0.15 magnitudes. While this is potentially similar to the\ndispersion seen for type Ia supernovae, we caution that this needs to be\nconfirmed with a larger sample of II-P supernovae in the Hubble flow.\n", "  This paper deals with the heat equation posed in a bounded regular domain\ncoupled with a dynamical boundary condition of reactive-diffusive type,\ninvolving the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We prove well-posedness of the problem\ntogether with regularity of the solutions.\n", "  It is now a commonplace observation that human society is becoming a coherent\nsuper-organism, and that the information infrastructure forms its emerging\nbrain. Perhaps, as the underlying technologies are likely to become billions of\ntimes more powerful than those we have today, we could say that we are now\nbuilding the lizard brain for the future organism.\n", "  The studies of the evolution of galaxies in Galaxy Clusters have as a\ntraditional complication the difficulty in establishing cluster membership of\nthose sources detected in the field of view. The determination of spectroscopic\nredshifts involves long exposure times when it is needed to reach the cluster\nperipherical regions of/or clusters at moderately large redshifts, while\nphotometric redshifts often present uncertainties too large to offer\nsignificant conclusions. The mapping of the cluster of galaxies with narrow\nband tunable filters makes it possible to reach large redshifts intervals with\nan accuracy high enough to establish the source membership of those presenting\nemission/absorption lines easily identifiable, as H alpha. Moreover, the\nwavelength scan can include other lines as [NII], [OIII] or $H_{\\beta}$\nallowing to distinguish those sources with strong stellar formation activity\nand those with an active galactic nuclei. All this makes it possible to\nestimate the stellar formation rate of the galaxies observed. This, together\nwith ancillary data in other wavelengths may lead to a good estimation of the\nstellar formation histories. It will shed new light over the galaxy evolution\nin clusters and will improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, especially\nin the outer cluster regions, usually less studied and with significant\nunexploited data that can not be correctly interpreted without redshift\ndetermination.\n", "  Support to Astronomy operations is an important and long-lived activity\nwithin INSA. Probably the best known (and traditional) INSA activities are\nthose related with real-time spacecraft operations: Ground station maintenance\nand operation (Ground station engineers and operators); spacecraft and payload\nreal-time operation (spacecraft and instruments controllers); computing\ninfrastructure maintenance (operators, analysts) and general site services.In\nthis paper, we'll show a different perspective, probably not so well-known,\npresenting some INSA recent activities at the European Space Astronomy Centre\n(ESAC) and NASA Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex (MDSCC) directly\nrelated to scientific operations. Basic lines of activity involved include:\nOperations support for science operations; system and software support for real\ntime systems; technical administration and IT support; R \\& D activities,\nradioastronomy (at MDSCC and ESAC) and scientific research projects. This paper\nis structured as follows: first, INSA activities in two ESA cornerstone\nastrophysics missions, XMM-Newton and Herschel, will be outlined. Then, our\nactivities related to Science infrastructure services, represented by the\nVirtual Observatory (VO) framework and the Science Archives development\nfacilities are briefly shown. Radio Astronomy activities will be described\nafterwards, and finally, a few research topics in which INSA scientists are\ninvolved will be also described.\n", "  We present a panchromatic study of luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar\nmass functions (SMFs) of galaxies in the core of the Shapley supercluster at\nz=0.048, in order to investigate how the dense environment affects the galaxy\nproperties, such as star formation (SF) or stellar masses. We find that while\nfaint-end slopes of optical and NIR LFs steepen with decreasing density, no\nenvironment effect is found in the slope of the SMFs. This suggests that\nmechanisms transforming galaxies in different environments are mainly related\nto the quench of SF rather than to mass-loss. The Near-UV (NUV) and Far-UV\n(FUV) LFs obtained have steeper faint-end slopes than the local field\npopulation, while the 24$\\mu$m and 70$\\mu$m galaxy LFs for the Shapley\nsupercluster have shapes fully consistent with those obtained for the local\nfield galaxy population. This apparent lack of environmental dependence for the\ninfrared (IR) LFs suggests that the bulk of the star-forming galaxies that make\nup the observed cluster IR LF have been recently accreted from the field and\nhave yet to have their SF activity significantly affected by the cluster\nenvironment.\n", "  In this review, I provide an overview of theoretical aspects related to the\nevolution of galaxies as a function of environment. I discuss the main physical\nprocesses at play, their characteristic time-scales and environmental\ndependency, and comment on their treatment in the framework of hierarchical\ngalaxy formation models. I briefly summarize recent results and the main open\nissues.\n", "  Superconducting cosmic string may admit shock-like discontinuities of the\ncurrent when the latter is spacelike (\"magnetic\" regime), while no shock at\ntimelike current (\"electric\" regime) was discovered in numerical simulations.\nWe find that the necessary and enough conditions for existence of stable shocks\nand show that the shock can be unstable in the presence of infinitesimal\nextrinsic perturbations of the string worldsheet. The shocks in the \"magnetic\"\nregime are not vulnerable to this instability but the shocks in the \"electric\"\nregime do not survive.\n", "  In the current era of data-intensive science, it is increasingly important\nfor researchers to be able to have access to published results, the supporting\ndata, and the processes used to produce them. Six years ago, recognizing this\nneed, the American Astronomical Society and the Astrophysics Data Centers\nExecutive Committee (ADEC) sponsored an effort to facilitate the annotation and\nlinking of datasets during the publishing process, with limited success. I will\nreview the status of this effort and describe a new, more general one now being\nconsidered in the context of the Virtual Astronomical Observatory.\n", "  During recent years, bibliometric studies have become increasingly important\nin evaluating individual scientists, institutes, and entire observatories. In\nastronomy, often librarians are involved in maintaining publication databases\nand compiling statistics for their institutions. In this paper, we present a\nlook behind the scenes to understand who is interested in bibliometric\nstatistics, which methodologies astronomy librarians apply, and what kind of\nfeatures next-generation bibliographies may include.\n", "  \"You don't look like a librarian\" is a phrase we often hear in the astronomy\ndepartment or observatory library. Astronomy librarians are a breed apart, and\nare taking on new and non-traditional roles as information technology evolves.\nThis talk will explore the future of librarians and librarianship through the\nlens of the recent talks given at the sixth \"Libraries and Information Services\nin Astronomy\" conference held in Pune, India in February 2010. We will explore\nthe librarian's universe, illustrating how librarians use new technologies to\nperform such tasks as bibliometrics, how we are re-fashioning our library\nspaces in an increasingly digital world and how we are confronting the brave\nnew world of open access, to name but a few topics.\n", "  We show that appealing to a Quark-Nova (QN) in a tight binary system\ncontaining a massive neutron star and a CO white dwarf (WD), a Type Ia\nexplosion could occur. The QN ejecta collides with the WD driving a shock that\ntriggers Carbon burning under degenerate conditions (the QN-Ia). The conditions\nin the compressed low-mass WD (M_WD < 0.9M_sun) in our model mimics those of a\nChandrasekhar mass WD. The spin-down luminosity from the QN compact remnant\n(the quark star) provides additional power that makes the QN-Ia light-curve\nbrighter and broader than a standard SN-Ia with similar 56Ni yield. In QNe-Ia,\nphotometry and spectroscopy are not necessarily linked since the kinetic energy\nof the ejecta has a contribution from spin-down power and nuclear decay.\nAlthough QNe-Ia may not obey the Phillips relationship, their brightness and\ntheir relatively \"normal looking\" light-curves means they could be included in\nthe cosmological sample. Light-curve fitters would be confused by the\ndiscrepancy between spectroscopy at peak and photometry and would correct for\nit by effectively brightening or dimming the QNe-Ia apparent magnitudes. Thus\nover- or under-estimating the true magnitude of these spin-down powered SNe-Ia.\nContamination of QNe-Ia in samples of SNe-Ia used for cosmological analyses\ncould systematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters if QNe-Ia are\nnumerous enough at high-redshift. The strong mixing induced by spin-down wind\ncombined with the low 56Ni yields in QNe-Ia means that these would lack a\nsecondary maximum in the i-band despite their luminous nature. We discuss\npossible QNe-Ia progenitors.\n", "  We demonstrate 32.5 Tbit/s 16QAM Nyquist WDM transmission over a total length\nof 227 km of SMF-28 without optical dispersion compensation. A number of 325\noptical carriers are derived from a single laser and encoded with\ndual-polarization 16QAM data using sinc-shaped Nyquist pulses. As we use no\nguard bands, the carriers have a spacing of 12.5 GHz equal to the Nyquist\nbandwidth of the data. We achieve a high net spectral efficiency of 6.4\nbit/s/Hz using a software-defined transmitter which generates the electrical\nmodulator drive signals in real-time.\n", "  The origin of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) is investigated in a global\ncosmological context by simultaneously following the evolution of the Milky Way\nGalaxy and its dwarf satellites. This approach enable to study the formation of\ndSphs in their proper birth environment and to reconstruct their own merging\nhistories. The proposed picture simultaneously accounts for several dSph and\nMilky Way properties, including the Metallicity Distribution Functions of\nmetal-poor stars. The observed features are interpreted in terms of physical\nprocesses acting at high redshifts.\n", "  Over the past two decades, every scholarly publisher has migrated at least\nthe mechanical aspects of their journal publishing so that they utilize digital\nmeans. The academy was comfortable with that for a while, but publishers are\nunder increasing pressure to adapt further. At the American Astronomical\nSociety (AAS), we think that means bringing our publishing program to the point\nof being fully digital, by establishing procedures and policies that regard the\ndigital objects of publication primarily. We have always thought about our\nelectronic journals as databases of digital articles, from which we can publish\nand syndicate articles one at a time, and we must now put flesh on those bones\nby developing practices that are consistent with the realities of article at a\ntime publication online. As a learned society that holds the long-term rights\nto the literature, we have actively taken responsibility for the preservation\nof the digital assets that constitute our journals, and in so doing we have not\nforsaken the legacy pre-digital assets. All of us who serve as the long-term\nstewards of scholarship must begin to evolve into fully digital publishers.\n", "  Recent determinations of the Hubble constant, H_0, at extremely low and very\nhigh redshifts based on the cosmic distance ladder (grounded with trigonometric\nparallaxes) and a cosmological model (applied to Planck 2013 data)\nrespectively, are revealing an intriguing discrepancy (nearly 9% or 2.4sigma)\nthat is challenging astronomers and theoretical cosmologists. In order to shed\nsome light on this problem, here we discuss a new determination of H_0 at\nintermediate redshifts (z ~ 1), using the following four cosmic probes: (i)\nmeasurements of the angular diameter distances (ADD) for galaxy clusters based\non the combination of Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray data (0.14 < z <\n0.89$), (ii) the inferred ages of old high redshift galaxies (OHRG) (0.62 < z <\n1.70), (iii) measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) (0.1 < z < 1.8), and\n(iv) the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature (z=0.35). In our analysis,\nassuming a flat LCDM cosmology and considering statistical plus systematic\nerrors we obtain H_0 = 74.1^{+2.2}_{-2.2} km/s.Mpc (1sigma) which is a 3%\ndetermination of the Hubble constant at intermediate redshifts. We stress that\neach individual test adopted here has error bars larger than the ones appearing\nin the calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder. However, the\nremarkable complementarity among the four tests works efficiently in reducing\ngreatly the possible degeneracy on the space parameter (Omega_m,h) ultimately\nproviding a value of H_0 that is in excellent agreement with the determination\nusing recessional velocities and distances to nearby objects.\n", "  This is a generalization of the procedure presented in [3] to construct\nsemisimple bi-flat $F$-manifolds $(M,\\nabla^{(1)},\\nabla^{(2)},\\circ,*,e,E)$\nstarting from homogeneous solutions of degree -1 of Darboux-Egorov-system. The\nLam\\'e coefficients $H_i$ involved in the construction are still homogeneous\nfunctions of a certain degree $d_i$ but we consider the general case $d_i\\ne\nd_j$. As a consequence the rotation coefficients $\\beta_{ij}$ are homogeneous\nfunctions of degree $d_i-d_j-1$. It turns out that any semisimple bi-flat $F$\nmanifold satisfying a natural additional assumption can be obtained in this\nway. Finally we show that three dimensional semisimple bi-flat $F$-manifolds\nare parametrized by solutions of the full family of Painlev\\'e VI.\n", "  A controversy is raging concerning the most physically meaningful definition\nof quark and gluon angular momentum, a question of importance in understanding\nthe internal structure of the nucleon. There are, in my, opinion, two principal\ncandidates: the Belinfante version, $\\bm{J}_{bel}$, which is gauge invariant,\nand the Canonical version, $ \\bm{J}_{can}$, which is non-gauge invariant, but\nwhich has a physically intuitive structure. I demonstrate the wholly unexpected\nresult that for quarks in a spin 1/2 nucleon the expectation value of\n$\\bm{J}_{bel}(\\textrm{quark})$ is equal to the expectation value of $\n\\bm{J}_{can}(\\textrm{quark})$ taken in the light-cone gauge $A^+=0$, with an\nanalogous result for gluons.\n", "  Normalized compression distance (NCD) is a parameter-free, feature-free,\nalignment-free, similarity measure between a pair of finite objects based on\ncompression. However, it is not sufficient for all applications. We propose an\nNCD of finite multisets (a.k.a. multiples) of finite objects that is also a\nmetric. Previously, attempts to obtain such an NCD failed. We cover the entire\ntrajectory from theoretical underpinning to feasible practice. The new NCD for\nmultisets is applied to retinal progenitor cell classification questions and to\nrelated synthetically generated data that were earlier treated with the\npairwise NCD. With the new method we achieved significantly better results.\nSimilarly for questions about axonal organelle transport. We also applied the\nnew NCD to handwritten digit recognition and improved classification accuracy\nsignificantly over that of pairwise NCD by incorporating both the pairwise and\nNCD for multisets. In the analysis we use the incomputable Kolmogorov\ncomplexity that for practical purposes is approximated from above by the length\nof the compressed version of the file involved, using a real-world compression\nprogram.\n  Index Terms--- Normalized compression distance, multisets or multiples,\npattern recognition, data mining, similarity, classification, Kolmogorov\ncomplexity, retinal progenitor cells, synthetic data, organelle transport,\nhandwritten character recognition\n", "  Compressed sensing has shown great potential in reducing data acquisition\ntime in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, a spread spectrum\ncompressed sensing MRI method modulates an image with a quadratic phase. It\nperforms better than the conventional compressed sensing MRI with variable\ndensity sampling, since the coherence between the sensing and sparsity bases\nare reduced. However, spread spectrum in that method is implemented via a shim\ncoil which limits its modulation intensity and is not convenient to operate. In\nthis letter, we propose to apply chirp (linear frequency-swept) radio frequency\npulses to easily control the spread spectrum. To accelerate the image\nreconstruction, an alternating direction algorithm is modified by exploiting\nthe complex orthogonality of the quadratic phase encoding. Reconstruction on\nthe acquired data demonstrates that more image features are preserved using the\nproposed approach than those of conventional CS-MRI.\n", "  We present a method for construction of approximate orbits of measures under\nthe action of cellular automata which is complementary to the local structure\ntheory. The local structure theory is based on the idea of Bayesian extension,\nthat is, construction of a probability measure consistent with given block\nprobabilities and maximizing entropy. If instead of maximizing entropy one\nminimizes it, one can develop another method for construction of approximate\norbits, at the heart of which is the iteration of finitely-dimensional maps,\ncalled minimal entropy maps. We present numerical evidence that minimal entropy\napproximation sometimes spectacularly outperforms the local structure theory in\ncharacterizing properties of cellular automata. Density response curve for\nelementary CA rule 26 is used to illustrate this claim.\n", "  We consider the problem of finding the density of 1's in a configuration\nobtained by $n$ iterations of a given cellular automaton (CA) rule, starting\nfrom disordered initial condition. While this problems is intractable in full\ngenerality for a general CA rule, we argue that for some sufficiently simple\nclasses of rules it is possible to express the density in terms of elementary\nfunctions. Rules asymptotically emulating identity are one example of such a\nclass, and density formulae have been previously obtained for several of them.\nWe show how to obtain formulae for density for two further rules in this class,\n160 and 168, and postulate likely expression for density for eight other rules.\nOur results are valid for arbitrary initial density. Finally, we conjecture\nthat the density of 1's for CA rules asymptotically emulating identity always\napproaches the equilibrium point exponentially fast.\n", "  Complex many-body interaction in perovskite manganites gives rise to a strong\ncompetition between ferromagnetic metallic and charge ordered phases with\nnanoscale electronic inhomogeneity and glassy behaviors. Investigating this\nglassy state requires high resolution imaging techniques with sufficient\nsensitivity and stability. Here, we present the results of a near-field\nmicrowave microscope imaging on the strain driven glassy state in a manganite\nfilm. The high contrast between the two electrically distinct phases allows\ndirect visualization of the phase separation. The low temperature microscopic\nconfigurations differ upon cooling with different thermal histories. At\nsufficiently high temperatures, we observe switching between the two phases in\neither direction. The dynamic switching, however, stops below the glass\ntransition temperature. Compared with the magnetization data, the phase\nseparation was microscopically frozen, while spin relaxation was found in a\nshort period of time.\n", "  In quantum error-correcting code (QECC), many quantum operations and\nmeasurements are necessary to correct errors in logical qubits. In the\nstabilizer formalism, which is widely used in QECC, generators $G_i (i=1,2,..)$\nconsist of multiples of Pauli matrices and perform encoding, decoding and\nmeasurement. In order to maintain encoding states, the stabilizer Hamiltonian\n$H_{\\rm stab}=-\\sum_i G_i$ is suitable because its ground state corresponds to\nthe code space. On the other hand, Hamiltonians of most solid-state qubits have\ntwo-body interactions and show their own dynamics. In addition solid-state\nqubits are fixed on substrate and qubit-qubit operation is restricted in their\nneighborhood. The main purpose of this paper is to show how to directly\ngenerate the stabilizer Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm stab}$ from conventional two-body\nHamiltonians with Ising interaction and XY interaction by applying a pulse\ncontrol method such as an NMR technique. We show that generation times of\n$H_{\\rm stab}$ for nine-qubit code, five-qubit code and Steane code are\nestimated to be less than 300 ns when typical experimental data of\nsuperconducting qubits are used, and sufficient pulse control is assumed. We\nalso show how to prepare encoded states from an initial state $|0....0>$. In\naddition, we discuss an appropriate arrangement of two- or three-dimensional\narrayed qubits.\n", "  We want to study the Casimir effect for a single conducting microscopic\ncylindrical cavity. The mathematical technique is based on the Green function\nof the geometry of the inside of the cavity, and the integral regularization is\nbased on the plasma frequency cutoff for real conductors. Using the symmetric\nelectromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, in terms of four potential, the total\nCasimir energy for the inside of the Cavity is calculated. Neglecting the\ncontribution of the external (outside of the cavity) Casimir energy based on\nthe reason recently presented in [1], the forces experienced by the lateral\nsurface of the cavity and its circular bases are calculated. The resulting\nexpressions show that these forces are repulsive. The numerical computation is\ndone for the real problem of a cavity with a basis of a radius in the same\norder of its height at the scale of 100 nanometers made of the best conducting\nmaterials already known.\n", "  In this paper we show that the energy eigenstates of supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics (SUSYQM) with non definite \"fermion\" number are entangled states.\nThey are \"physical states\" of the model provided that observables with odd\nnumber of spin variables are allowed in the theory like it happens in the\nJaynes-Cummings model. Those states generalize the so called \"spin spring\"\nstates of the Jaynes-Cummings model which have played an important role in the\nstudy of entanglement.\n", "  The modern form of the Moments Method applied to the calculation of the\nnuclear shell-model level density is explained and examples of the method at\nwork are given. The calculated level density practically exactly coincides with\nthe result of full diagonalization when the latter is feasible. The method\nprovides the pure level density for given spin and parity with spurious\ncenter-of-mass excitations subtracted. The presence and interplay of all\ncorrelations leads to the results different from those obtained by the\nmean-field combinatorics.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) hold great promise for realizing zero-energy\nMajorana states in solid-state systems. Recently, several groups reported\nexperimental data suggesting that signatures of Majorana modes in topological\ninsulator Josephson junctions (TIJJs) have -- indeed -- been observed. To\nverify this claim, one needs to study the topological properties of low-energy\nAndreev-bound states (ABS) in TIs of which the Majorana modes are a special\ncase. It has been shown theoretically that topologically non-trivial low-energy\nABS are also present in TIJJs with doped topological insulators up to some\ncritical level of doping at which the system undergoes a topological phase\ntransition. Here, we present first experimental evidence for this topological\ntransition in the bulk band of a doped TI. Our theoretical calculations, and\nnumerical modeling link abrupt changes in the critical current of top-gated\nTIJJs to moving the chemical potential in the charge-accumulation region on the\nsurface of the doped TI across a band-inversion point. We demonstrate that the\ncritical-current changes originate from a shift of the spatial location of\nlow-energy ABS from the surface to the boundary between topologically-trivial\nand band-inverted regions after the transition. The appearance of a decay\nchannel for surface ABS is related to the vanishing of the band effective mass\nin the bulk and thus exemplifies the topological character of surface ABS as\nboundary modes. Importantly, the mechanism suggest a means of manipulating\nMajorana modes in future experiments.\n", "  We define and study a noncommutative Fourier transform on every homogeneous\ncomplex bounded domain. We then give an application in noncommutative\ndifferential geometry by defining noncommutative Baumslag-Solitar tori.\n", "  We propose a one-dimensional electron model with parameters modulated\nadiabatically in closed cycles, which can continuously pump spin to leads. By\ndefining the spin-polarized Wannier functions, we show that the spin pump is\nprotected by the spin Chern numbers, so that it is stable to perturbations\nviolating the time-reversal symmetry and spin conservation. Our work\ndemonstrates the possibility and principle to realize topological spin pumps\nindependent of any symmetries, and also suggests a possible way to\nexperimentally observe the bulk topological invariants.\n", "  The lately proposed vacuum matter coupling model (arXiv:1303.6568) seems to\nbe able to provide solutions to a variety of problems in cosmology. This\ncoupling expressed by a transition term between vacuum energy and matter, but\nwe point out that an additional energy transition mechanism is necessary for\nfurther development of this model in order to explain observations.\n", "  Thin magnetic multilayered films containing FePt have attracted a lot of\nattention recently due to their possible usage in ultra-high density magnetic\nstorage. Although structure defects play a dramatic role in the magnetization\nprocess and influence magnetic properties in general this dependence haven't\nbeen studied thoroughly. The main aim of this work was to perform theoretical\ninvestigation of the magnetic properties of FePt and Fe/FePt thin films with\nhigh coercivity with respect to the structure defects such as anisotropy\nconstant, magnetization saturation, exchange constant fluctuations and easy\naxis deviation. For selected defect patterns the coercive field dependence on\nlayer thicknesses was analysed. Numerical study of the bilayer with hard\nmagnetic layer having the planar anisotropy was carried on using micromagnetic\ncalculations. Values of layers thickness have been found optimal for\nperspective applications, the dependence of the hysteresis loop shape upon the\nmagnetization process has been shown and analysed.\n", "  We develop and test with cosmological simulations a physically motivated\ntheory for how the interplay between gravity, pressure, cooling, and\nself-shielding set the redshift--dependent mass scale at which halos can\naccrete intergalactic gas. This theory provides a physical explanation for the\nhalo mass scale that can accrete unshocked intergalactic gas, which has been\nexplained with ad hoc criteria tuned to reproduce the results of a few\nsimulations. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive explanation for how this\nmass scale depends on the reionization redshift, the amplitude of the ionizing\nbackground, and the redshift. We show that accretion is inhibited onto more\nmassive halos than had been thought because previous studies had focused on the\ngas fraction of halos rather than the instantaneous mass that can accrete gas.\nA halo as massive as 10^11 Msun cannot accrete intergalactic gas at z=0, even\nthough typically its progenitors were able to accrete gas at higher redshifts.\nWe describe a simple algorithm that can be implemented in semi-analytic models,\nand we compare the predictions of this algorithm to numerical simulations.\n", "  We describe a home-built pneumatic shuttle suitable for the fast displacement\nof samples in the vicinity of a highly sensitive atomic magnetometer. The\nsamples are magnetized at 1 T using a Halbach assembly of magnets. The device\nenables the remote detection of free induction decay in ultra-low-field and\nzero-field NMR experiments, in relaxometric measurements and in other\napplications involving the displacement of magnetized samples within time\nintervals as short as a few tens of milliseconds. Other possible applications\nof fast sample shuttling exist in radiological studies, where samples have to\nbe irradiated and then analyzed in a 'cold' environment.\n", "  The ESR model has been recently proposed in several papers to offer a\npossible solution of the problems raising from the nonobjectivity of physical\nproperties in quantum mechanics (QM) (mainly the objectification problem of the\nquantum theory of measurement). This solution is obtained by embodying the\nmathematical formalism of QM into a broader mathematical framework and\nreinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional on detection rather than\nabsolute. We provide a new and more general formulation of the ESR model and\ndiscuss time evolution according to it, pointing out in particular that both\nlinear and nonlinear evolution may occur, depending on the physical\nenvironment.\n", "  Using 72 Short Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs) with well determined spectral data\nobserved by BATSE, we determine their redshift and the luminosity by applying\n$E_p$--$L_p$ correlation for SGRBs found by \\cite{tsutsui13}. For 53 SGRBs with\nthe observed flux brighter than $4 \\times 10^{-6}~{\\rm erg~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$, the\ncumulative redshift distribution up to $z=1$ agrees well with that of 22 {\\it\nSwift}~SGRBs. This suggests that the redshift determination by the $E_p$--$L_p$\ncorrelation for SGRBs works well. The minimum event rate at $z=0$ is estimated\nas $\\rho_{SGRB}(0) = 6.3_{-3.9}^{+3.1} \\times 10^{-10}~{\\rm\nevents~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ so that the minimum beaming angle is\n$0.6^\\circ-7.8^\\circ$ assuming the merging rate of $10^{-7}-4\\times\n10^{-6}~{\\rm events~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ suggested from the binary pulsar data.\nInterestingly, this angle is consistent with that for SGRB130603B of $\\sim\n4^\\circ-8^\\circ$\\citep{fong13b}. On the other hand, if we assume the beaming\nangle of $\\sim 6^\\circ$ suggested from four SGRBs with the observed value of\nbeaming angle, the minimum event rate including off-axis SGRBs is estimated as\n$\\rho_{SGRB,all}^{min}(0)=1.15_{-0.71}^{+0.57}\\times 10^{-7}~{\\rm\nevents~Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. If SGRBs are induced by coalescence of binary neutron\nstars (NSs) and/or black holes (BHs), this event rate leads to the minimum\ngravitational-wave detection rate of $\\rm 3.9_{-2.4}^{+1.9}\n(152_{-94}^{+75})~events~y^{-1}$ for NS-NS (NS-BH) binary, respectively, by a\nworldwide network with KAGRA, advanced-LIGO, advanced-Virgo, and GEO.\n", "  The in-plane thermal conductivity of iron-based superconductor\nCa$_{10}$(Pt$_{4-\\delta}$As$_8$)((Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ single\ncrystal (``10-4-8\", $T_c$ = 22 K) was measured down to 80 mK. In zero field,\nthe residual linear term $\\kappa_0/T$ is negligible, suggesting nodeless\nsuperconducting gaps in this multiband compound. In magnetic fields,\n$\\kappa_0/T$ increases rapidly, which mimics those of multiband superconductor\nNbSe$_2$ and LuNi$_2$B$_2$C with highly anisotropic gap. Such a field\ndependence of $\\kappa_0/T$ is an evidence for multiple superconducting gaps\nwith quite different magnitudes or highly anisotropic gap. Comparing with the\nLondon penetration depth results of\nCa$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)((Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ (``10-3-8\")\ncompound, the 10-4-8 and 10-3-8 compounds may have similar superconducting gap\nstructure.\n", "  We measured the low-temperature thermal conductivity of a new layered\nsuperconductor with quasi-one-dimensional characteristics, the ternary\ntelluride Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ with transition temperature $T_c \\approx$ 4.3\nK. The significant residual linear term of thermal conductivity in zero\nmagnetic field and its rapid field dependence provide evidences for nodes in\nthe superconducting gap. By measuring resistivity under pressures, we reveal a\nsuperconducting dome in the temperature-pressure phase diagram. The existence\nof gap nodes and superconducting dome suggests unconventional superconductivity\nin Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$, which may relate to a charge-density wave instability\nin this low-dimensional compound.\n", "  Non-Abelian quasiparticles have been predicted to exist in a variety of\ncondensed matter systems. Their defining property is that an adiabatic braid\nbetween two of them results in a nontrivial change of the quantum state of the\nsystem. To date, no experimental platform has reached the desired control over\nnon-Abelian quasiparticles to demonstrate this remarkable property. The\nsimplest non-Abelian quasiparticles -- the Majorana bound states (MBS) -- can\noccur in one-dimensional (1D) electronic nano-structures proximity-coupled to a\nbulk superconductor -- a platform that is being currently explored in great\ndepth both theoretically and experimentally. When tuned appropriately, such\nnano-wires can localize MBS at their ends, a pair of which forms a two-level\nsystem that is robust to local perturbations. This constitutes a topologically\nprotected qubit that can serve as the building block for a topological quantum\ncomputer. To implement braiding operations among the MBS, schemes that allow to\nmove MBS across wire networks have been explored theoretically. Here, we\npropose a simpler alternative setup, based on chains of magnetic adatoms on the\nsurface of a thin-film superconductor, in which the control over an externally\napplied magnetic field suffices to create and manipulate MBS. We consider\nspecific 1D patterns of adatoms, which can be engineered with\nscanning-tunneling-microscope based lateral atomic manipulation techniques, and\nshow that they allow for the creation, annihilation, adiabatic motion, and\nbraiding of pairs of MBS by varying the magnitude and orientation of the\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  The doubly charged Higgs bosons $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ searches at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) have been studied extensively and strong bound is available for\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}$ dominantly decaying into a pair of same-sign di-leptons. In this\npaper we point out that there is a large cavity in the light $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ mass\nregion left unexcluded. In particular, $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ can dominantly decay into\n$WW$ or $WW^*$ (For instance, in the type-II seesaw mechanism the triplet\nacquires a vacuum expectation value around 1 GeV.), and then it is found that\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}$ with mass even below $2m_W$ remains untouched by the current\ncollider searches. Searching for such a $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ at the LHC is the topic of\nthis paper. We perform detailed signal and background simulation, especially\nincluding the non-prompt $t\\bar{t}$ background which is the dominant one\nnevertheless ignored before. We show that such $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ should be\nobservable at the 14 TeV LHC with 10-30 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.\n", "  We derive an analytical gauge-invariant formula between the Polyakov loop\n$L_P$ and the Dirac eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ in QCD, i.e., $L_P \\propto \\sum_n\n\\lambda_n^{N_t -1} \\langle n|\\hat U_4|n \\rangle$, in ordinary periodic square\nlattice QCD with odd-number temporal size $N_t$.

This formula\nis a Dirac spectral representation of the Polyakov loop in terms of Dirac\neigenmodes $|n\\rangle$. Because of the factor $\\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$ in the Dirac\nspectral sum, this formula indicates negligibly small contribution of low-lying\nDirac modes to the Polyakov loop in both confinement and deconfinement phases,\nwhile these modes are essential for chiral symmetry breaking. Next, we find a\nsimilar formula between the Wilson loop and Dirac modes on arbitrary square\nlattices, without restriction of odd-number size. This formula suggests a small\ncontribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the string tension $\\sigma$, or the\nconfining force. These findings support no crucial role of low-lying Dirac\nmodes for confinement, i.e., no direct one-to-one correspondence between\nconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, which seems to be natural\nbecause heavy quarks are also confined even without light quarks or the chiral\nsymmetry.\n", "  Supersonic vortex plane and axisymmetric flows of non-viscous\nnon-heatconductive gas with arbitrary thermodynamic properties in the vicinity\nof a steady shock wave are studied. The differential equations describing the\ngas flow exterior to the discontinuity surface and the dynamic compatibility\nconditions at this discontinuity are used. The gas flow nonuniformity in the\nshock vicinity is described by the space derivatives of the gasdynamic\nparameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas\npressure, density, velocity vector. The derivatives with respect to the\ndirections of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and\nnormal to it are considered. Space derivatives of all gasdynamic parameters are\nexpressed through the flow nonisobaric factor along the streamline, the\nstreamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors. An\nalgorithm for these factors of the gas flow downstream a shock wave\ndetermination is developed. Examples of these factors calculation for imperfect\noxygen and thermodynamically perfect gas are presented. The influence\ncoefficients of the upstream flow factors on the downstream flow factors are\ncalculated. As an illustration for flows with upstream Mach number 5 it is\nshown that the flow vorticity factor is the most influenced by the\nthermodynamical gas properties. The gas flow in the vicinity of the shock is\ndescribed by the isolines of gasdynamic parameters. Uniform plane and\naxisymmetric flows on different distances from the axis of symmetry are\nexamined; the isobars, isopycnics, isotachs and isoclines are used to\ncharacterize the downstream flow behind a curved shock in an imperfect gas.\n", "  Electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) has been proposed as a way to\ngreatly enhance cross-phase modulation, with the possibility of leading to\nfew-photon-level optical nonlinearities. This enhancement grows as the\ntransparency window width, \\Delta_EIT, is narrowed. Decreasing \\Delta_EIT,\nhowever, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses\nof a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the\nnonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow\nEIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is\nnot only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its\nincreased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter\n(temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to\nprolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase\nshift that grows linearly with \\Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may\nsaturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the\ndetectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound. For many\npurposes, it is this detectability which is of interest, more than the absolute\nmagnitude of the peak phase shift. We present analytical expressions based on a\nlinear time-invariant model that accounts for the temporal behavior of the\ncross-phase modulation for several parameter ranges of interest. We conclude\nthat in order to optimize the detectability of the EIT-based cross-phase shift,\none should use the narrowest possible EIT window, and a signal pulse that is as\nbroadband as the excited state linewidth and detuned by half a linewidth.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that certain fluid-mechanical systems, namely\noil droplets bouncing on oil films, can mimic a wide range of quantum\nphenomena, including double-slit interference, quantization of angular momentum\nand Zeeman splitting. Here I investigate what can be learned from these systems\nconcerning no-go theorems as those of Bell and Kochen-Specker. In particular, a\nmodel for the Bell experiment is proposed that includes variables describing a\n'background' field or medium. This field mimics the surface wave that\naccompanies the droplets in the fluid-mechanical experiments. It appears that\nquite generally such a model can violate the Bell inequality and reproduce the\nquantum statistics, even if it is based on local dynamics only. The reason is\nthat measurement independence is not valid in such models. This opens the door\nfor local 'background-based' theories, describing the interaction of particles\nand analyzers with a background field, to complete quantum mechanics.\nExperiments to test these ideas are also proposed.\n", "  We suggest a possible approach to proving the M\\'ezard-Parisi formula for the\nfree energy in the diluted spin glass models, such as diluted K-spin or random\nK-sat model at any positive temperature. In the main contribution of the paper,\nwe show that a certain small modification of the Hamiltonian in any of these\nmodels forces all finite-RSB asymptotic Gibbs measures in the sense of the\noverlaps to satisfy the M\\'ezard-Parisi ansatz for the distribution of spins.\nUnfortunately, what is still missing is a description of the general full-RSB\nasymptotic Gibbs measures. If one could show that the general case can be\napproximated by finite-RSB case in the right sense then one could a posteriori\nremove the small modification of the Hamiltonian to recover the M\\'ezard-Parisi\nformula for the original model.\n", "  By performing neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations in spherical\nsymmetry (1D) and axial symmetry (2D) with different progenitor models by\nWoosley & Heger (2007) from 12 $M_{\\odot}$ to 100 $M_{\\odot}$, we find that all\n1D runs fail to produce an explosion and several 2D runs succeed. The\ndifference in the shock evolutions for different progenitors can be interpreted\nby the difference in their mass accretion histories, which are in turn\ndetermined by the density structures of progenitors. The mass accretion history\nhas two phases in the majority of the models: the earlier phase in which the\nmass accretion rate is high and rapidly decreasing and the later phase with a\nlow and almost constant accretion rate. They are separated by the so-called\nturning point, the origin of which is a change of the accreting layer. We argue\nthat shock revival will most likely occur around the turning point and hence\nthat its location in the $\\dot M$-$L_\\nu$ plane will be a good measure for the\npossibility of shock revival: if the turning point lies above the critical\ncurve and the system stays there for a long time, shock revival will obtain. In\naddition, we develop a phenomenological model to approximately evaluate the\ntrajectories in the $\\dot M$-$L_\\nu$ plane, which, after calibrating free\nparameters by a small number of 1D simulations, reproduces the location of the\nturning point reasonably well by using the initial density structure of\nprogenitor alone. We suggest the application of the phenomenological model to a\nlarge collection of progenitors in order to infer without simulations which\nones are more likely to explode.\n", "  Hamiltonian engineering is an important approach for quantum information\nprocessing, when appropriate materials do not exist in nature or are unstable.\nSo far there is no stable material for the Kitaev spin Hamiltonian with\nanisotropic interactions on a honeycomb lattice (A. Kitaev, Annals of Physics\nvol 321, 2 (2006)), which plays a crucial role in the realization of both\nAbelian and non-Abelian anyons. Here, we show how to dynamically realize the\nKitaev spin Hamiltonian from the conventional Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian using\na pulse-control technique. By repeating the same pulse sequence, the quantum\nstate is dynamically preserved. The effects of the spin-orbit interaction and\nthe hyperfine interaction are also investigated.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to adopt a multivector calculus scheme to\nstudy finite difference discretizations of Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for\nwhich Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind may be used to represent a set of\nsolutions. The development of a well-adapted discrete Clifford calculus\nframework based on spinor fields allows us to represent, using solely\nprojection based arguments, the solutions for the discretized Dirac equations\nfrom the knowledge of the solutions of the discretized Klein-Gordon equation.\nImplications of those findings on the interpretation of the lattice fermion\ndoubling problem is briefly discussed.\n", "  We study the structural, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties of the\npotentially multiferroic Aurivillius phase material Bi$_5$FeTi$_3$O$_{15}$\nusing first principles electronic structure calculations. Calculations are\nperformed both with PBE and PBEsol exchange correlation functionals. We\nconclude that PBE systematically overestimates the lattice constants and the\nmagnitude of the ferroelectric distortion, whereas PBEsol leads to good\nagreement with available experimental data. We then assess a potential site\npreference of the Fe$^{3+}$ cation by comparing 10 different distributions of\nthe perovskite $B$-sites. We find a slight preference for the \"inner\" site,\nconsistent with recent experimental observations. We obtain a large value of\n$\\sim$55 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$ for the spontaneous electric polarization, which is\nrather independent of the specific Fe distribution. Finally, we calculate the\nstrength of the magnetic coupling constants and find strong antiferromagnetic\ncoupling between Fe$^{3+}$ cations in nearest neighbor positions, whereas the\ncoupling between further neighbors is rather weak. This poses the question\nwhether magnetic long range order can occur in this system in spite of the low\nconcentration of magnetic ions.\n", "  We give a detailed physical argument for the area law for entanglement\nentropy in gapped phases of matter arising from local Hamiltonians. Our\napproach is based on renormalization group (RG) ideas and takes a resource\noriented perspective. We report four main results. First, we argue for the\n\"weak area law\": any gapped phase with a unique ground state on every closed\nmanifold obeys the area law. Second, we introduce an RG based classification\nscheme and give a detailed argument that all phases within the classification\nscheme obey the area law. Third, we define a special sub-class of gapped\nphases, \\textit{topological quantum liquids}, which captures all examples of\ncurrent physical relevance, and we rigorously show that TQLs obey an area law.\nFourth, we show that all topological quantum liquids have MERA representations\nwhich achieve unit overlap with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit and\nwhich have a bond dimension scaling with system size $L$ as $e^{c\n\\log^{d(1+\\delta)}(L)}$ for all $\\delta >0$. For example, we show that chiral\nphases in $d=2$ dimensions have an approximate MERA with bond dimension $e^{c\n\\log^{2(1+\\delta)}(L)}$. We discuss extensively a number of subsidiary ideas\nand results necessary to make the main arguments, including field theory\nconstructions. While our argument for the general area law rests on\nphysically-motived assumptions (which we make explicit) and is therefore not\nrigorous, we may conclude that \"conventional\" gapped phases obey the area law\nand that any gapped phase which violates the area law must be a dragon.\n", "  When Dirac electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are gapped,\nthe resulting quantum anomalous Hall effect leads to universal magneto-optical\nFaraday and Kerr effects in the low frequency limit. However, at higher\nfrequencies different excitations can leave their own fingerprints on the\nmagneto-optics and can therefore be probed. In particular, we investigate the\nrole of localized in-gap states---which inevitably appear in the presence of\ncharged impurities---on these higher frequency magneto-optical effects. We have\nshown that these states resonantly contribute to the Hall conductivity and are\nmagneto-optically active. These in-gap states lead to peculiar resonant\nsignatures in the frequency dependence of the Faraday and Kerr angles, distinct\nin character to the contribution of in-gap excitonic states, and can be probed\nin ellipsometry measurements.\n", "  The transition between low and high density phases is a typical feature of\nsystems with social interactions. This contribution focuses on simple\nevacuation design of one room with one entrance and one exit; four\npassing-through experiments were organized and evaluated by means of automatic\nimage processing. The phase of the system, determined by travel time and\noccupancy, is evaluated with respect to the inflow, a controlled boundary\ncondition. Critical values of inflow and outflow were described with respect to\nthe transition from low density to congested state. Moreover, microscopic\nanalysis of travel time is provided.\n", "  A fully analytical theory of a traveling soliton in a one-dimensional\nfermionic superfluid is developed within the framework of time-dependent\nself-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are solved exactly in the\nAndreev approximation. The soliton manifests itself in a kink-like profile of\nthe superconducting order parameter and hosts a pair of Andreev bound states in\nits core. They adjust to soliton's motion and play an important role in its\nstabilization. A phase jump across the soliton and its energy decrease with\nsoliton's velocity and vanish at the critical velocity, corresponding to the\nLandau criterion, where the soliton starts emitting quasiparticles and becomes\nunstable. The \"inertial\" and \"gravitational\" masses of the soliton are\ncalculated and the former is shown to be orders of magnitude larger than the\nlatter. This results in a slow motion of the soliton in a harmonic trap,\nreminiscent to the observed behavior of a soliton-like texture in related\nexperiments in cold fermion gases [T. Yefsah et al., Nature 499, 426, (2013)].\nFurthermore, we calculate the full non-linear dispersion relation of the\nsoliton and solve the classical equations of motion in a trap. The strong\nnon-linearity at high velocities gives rise to anharmonic oscillatory motion of\nthe soliton. A careful analysis of this anharmonicity may provide a means to\nexperimentally measure the non-linear soliton spectrum in superfluids.\n", "  Subscriber churn remains a top challenge for wireless carriers. These\ncarriers need to understand the determinants of churn to confidently apply\neffective retention strategies to ensure their profitability and growth. In\nthis paper, we look at the effect of peer influence on churn and we try to\ndisentangle it from other effects that drive simultaneous churn across friends\nbut that do not relate to peer influence. We analyze a random sample of roughly\n10 thousand subscribers from large dataset from a major wireless carrier over a\nperiod of 10 months. We apply survival models and generalized propensity score\nto identify the role of peer influence. We show that the propensity to churn\nincreases when friends do and that it increases more when many strong friends\nchurn. Therefore, our results suggest that churn managers should consider\nstrategies aimed at preventing group churn. We also show that survival models\nfail to disentangle homophily from peer influence over-estimating the effect of\npeer influence.\n", "  The formation of bars in disk galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturity\nof the population. Previous studies have found that the incidence of bars in\ndisks decreases from the local Universe to z ~ 1, and by z > 1 simulations\npredict that bar features in dynamically mature disks should be extremely rare.\nHere we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive disk\ngalaxies at z ~ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from CANDELS. From within\na sample of 876 disk galaxies identified by visual classification in Galaxy\nZoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. Selecting a sub-sample within the same\nregion of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than L*), we find\nthat the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5< z < 2 (f_bar = 10.7 +6.3\n-3.5% after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. We\ndiscuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existing\nsimulations and our current understanding of the way disk galaxies have evolved\nover the last 11 billion years.\n", "  We present the results of a study investigating the sizes and morphologies of\nredshift 4 < z < 8 galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-S, HUDF and HUDF parallel\nfields. Based on non-parametric measurements and incorporating a careful\ntreatment of measurement biases, we quantify the typical size of galaxies at\neach redshift as the peak of the log-normal size distribution, rather than the\narithmetic mean size. Parameterizing the evolution of galaxy half-light radius\nas $r_{50} \\propto (1+z)^n$, we find $n = -0.20 \\pm 0.26$ at bright\nUV-luminosities ($0.3L_{*(z=3)} < L < L_*$) and $n = -0.47 \\pm 0.62$ at faint\nluminosities ($0.12L_* < L < 0.3L_*$). Furthermore, simulations based on\nartificially redshifting our z~4 galaxy sample show that we cannot reject the\nnull hypothesis of no size evolution. We show that this result is caused by a\ncombination of the size-dependent completeness of high-redshift galaxy samples\nand the underestimation of the sizes of the largest galaxies at a given epoch.\nTo explore the evolution of galaxy morphology we first compare asymmetry\nmeasurements to those from a large sample of simulated single S\\'ersic\nprofiles, in order to robustly categorise galaxies as either `smooth' or\n`disturbed'. Comparing the disturbed fraction amongst bright ($M_{UV} \\leq\n-20$) galaxies at each redshift to that obtained by artificially redshifting\nour z~4 galaxy sample, while carefully matching the size and UV-luminosity\ndistributions, we find no clear evidence for evolution in galaxy morphology\nover the redshift interval 4 < z < 8. Therefore, based on our results, a bright\n($M_{UV} \\leq -20$) galaxy at z~6 is no more likely to be measured as\n`disturbed' than a comparable galaxy at z~4, given the current observational\nconstraints.\n", "  We calculate the contribution of the higher-twist Feynman diagrams to the\nlarge-$p_T$ inclusive gluon production cross-section in $\\pi p$ collisions in\ncase of the running coupling and frozen coupling approaches within perturbative\nand holographic QCD. The structure of infrared renormalon singularities of the\nhigher-twist subprocess cross-section is obtained and the resummed higher-twist\ncross- sections (Borel sum) with the ones obtained in the framework of the\nfrozen coupling approach and leading-twist cross-section are compared and\nanalyzed.\n", "  We introduce the dynamical sine-Gordon equation in two space dimensions with\nparameter $\\beta$, which is the natural dynamic associated to the usual quantum\nsine-Gordon model. It is shown that when $\\beta^2 \\in (0,\\frac{16\\pi}{3})$ the\nWick renormalised equation is well-posed. In the regime $\\beta^2 \\in (0,4\\pi)$,\nthe Da Prato-Debussche method applies, while for $\\beta^2 \\in\n[4\\pi,\\frac{16\\pi}{3})$, the solution theory is provided via the theory of\nregularity structures (Hairer 2013). We also show that this model arises\nnaturally from a class of $2+1$-dimensional equilibrium interface fluctuation\nmodels with periodic nonlinearities.\n  The main mathematical difficulty arises in the construction of the model for\nthe associated regularity structure where the role of the noise is played by a\nnon-Gaussian random distribution similar to the complex multiplicative Gaussian\nchaos recently analysed by Lacoin, Rhodes and Vargas (2013).\n", "  We argue that the pattern of the deviation from the Glauber approximation\nprediction for the centrality dependence of the rate of forward jet production\nobserved in pA collisions at the LHC provides the first experimental evidence\nthat parton configurations in the projectile proton containing a parton with\nlarge $x$ interact with a nuclear target with a significantly smaller than\naverage cross section and have smaller than average size. We implement the\neffects of fluctuations of the interaction strength and, using the ATLAS\nanalysis of how hadron production at backward rapidities depends on the number\nof wounded nucleons, make quantitative predictions for the centrality\ndependence of the jet production rate as a function of the $x$-dependent\ninteraction strength $\\sigma(x)$.\n  We find that \\sigma(x)\\sim 0.6 ~\\sigma_{tot}(pp) gives a good description of\nthe x=0.6 data and may shed a light on the origin of the EMC effect.\n", "  RHIC-STAR is a mid-rapidity collider experiment for studying high energy\nnuclear collisions. The main physics goals of STAR experiment are 1) studying\nthe properties of the strongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma, 2) explore the QCD\nphase diagram structure. In these proceedings, we will review the recent\nresults of heavy ion physics at STAR.\n", "  We study a black hole of mass $M$, enclosed within a spherical box, in\nequilibrium with its Hawking radiation. We show that the spacetime geometry\ninside the box is described by the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for radiation,\nexcept for a {\\em thin shell} around the horizon. We use the maximum entropy\nprinciple to show that the invariant width of the shell is of order $\\sqrt{M}$,\nits entropy is of order $M$ and its temperature of order $1/\\sqrt{M}$ (in\nPlanck units). Thus, the width of the shell is {\\em much larger} than the\nPlanck length. Our approach is to insist on thermodynamic consistency when\nclassical general relativity coexists with the Hawking temperature in the\ndescription of a gravitating system. No assumptions about an underlying theory\nare made and no restrictions are placed on the origins of the new physics near\nthe horizon. We only employ classical general relativity and the principles of\nthermodynamics. Our result is strengthened by an analysis of the trace anomaly\nassociated to the geometry inside the box, i.e., the regime where quantum field\neffects become significant corresponds to the shells of maximum entropy around\nthe horizon.\n", "  The Berry phase on the Fermi surface and its influence on the conserved spin\ncurrent in a two-dimensional system with generic $k$-linear spin-orbit\ninteraction are investigated. We calculate the response of the effective\nconserved spin current to the applied electric field, which is composed of\nconventional and spin torque currents, by using the Kubo formula. We find that\nthe conventional spin current is not determined by the Berry phase effect.\nRemarkably, the spin torque Hall current is found to be proportional to the\nBerry phase, and the longitudinal spin torque current vanishes because of the\nBerry phase effect. When the $k$-linear spin-orbit interaction dominates the\nsystem, the Berry phase on the Fermi surface maintains two invariant\nproperties. One is that the magnitude of the spin torque current protected by\nthe Berry phase is unchanged by a small fluctuation of energy dispersion. The\nother one is that the change in the direction of the applied electric field\ndoes not change the magnitude of the spin torque current even if the energy\ndispersion is not spherically symmetric; i.e., the Berry phase effect has no\ndependence on the two-dimensional material orientation. The spin torque current\nis a universal value for all $k$-linear systems, such as Rashba, Dresselhaus,\nand Rashba-Dresselhaus systems. The topological number attributed to the Berry\nphase on the Fermi surface represents the phase of the orbital chirality of\nspin in the $k$-linear system. The change in the topological number results in\na phase transition in which the orbital chirality of spin $s_z$ and $-s_z$ is\nexchanged. We found that the spin torque current can be experimentally\nmeasured.\n", "  Peer recommendation is a crowdsourcing task that leverages the opinions of\nmany to identify interesting content online, such as news, images, or videos.\nPeer recommendation applications often use social signals, e.g., the number of\nprior recommendations, to guide people to the more interesting content. How\npeople react to social signals, in combination with content quality and its\npresentation order, determines the outcomes of peer recommendation, i.e., item\npopularity. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we experimentally measure the effects\nof social signals in peer recommendation. Specifically, after controlling for\nvariation due to item content and its position, we find that social signals\naffect item popularity about half as much as position and content do. These\neffects are somewhat correlated, so social signals exacerbate the \"rich get\nricher\" phenomenon, which results in a wider variance of popularity. Further,\nsocial signals change individual preferences, creating a \"herding\" effect that\nbiases people's judgments about the content. Despite this, we find that social\nsignals improve the efficiency of peer recommendation by reducing the effort\ndevoted to evaluating content while maintaining recommendation quality.\n", "  Dilute germanium carbides (Ge1-xCx) offer a direct bandgap for compact\nsilicon photonics, but widely varying results have been reported. This work\nuses ab initio simulations with HSE06 hybrid functionals and spin-orbit\ncoupling to study the Ge1-xCx band structure behavior in the absence of\ndefects. Contrary to Vegard's law, the conduction band minimum at k=0 is\nconsistently found to decrease with increasing C content, while L and X valleys\nchange much more slowly. A vanishing bandgap was observed for all alloys with\nx>0.017. Conduction bands deviate from a constant-potential band anticrossing\nmodel except near the center of the Brillouin zone.\n", "  We show that the well-known \\v{C}erenkov Effect contains new phenomena\narising from the quantum nature of charged particles. The \\v{C}erenkov\ntransition amplitudes allow coupling between the charged particle and the\nemitted photon through their orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin, by\nscattering into preferred angles and polarizations. Importantly, the spectral\nresponse reveals a discontinuity immediately below a frequency cutoff that can\noccur in the optical region. Specifically, with proper shaping of electron\nbeams (ebeams), we predict that the traditional \\v{C}erenkov radiation angle\nsplits into two distinctive cones of photonic shockwaves. One of the shockwaves\ncan move along a backward cone, otherwise considered impossible for\n\\v{C}erenkov radiation in ordinary matter. Our findings are observable for\nebeams with realistic parameters, offering new applications including novel\nquantum optics sources, and open a new realm for \\v{C}erenkov detectors\ninvolving the spin and orbital angular momentum of charged particles.\n", "  We construct the first nontrivial examples of Calabi-Yau monopoles. Our main\ninterest on these, comes from Donaldson and Segal's suggestion\n\\cite{Donaldson2009} that it may be possible to define an invariant of certain\nnoncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds from these gauge theoretical equations. We\nfocus on the Stenzel metric on the cotangent bundle of the $3$-sphere $T^*\n\\mathbb{S}^3$ and study monopoles under a symmetry assumption. Our main result\nconstructs the moduli of these symmetric monopoles and shows that these are\nparametrized by a positive real number known as the mass of the monopole. In\nother words, for each fixed mass we show that there is a unique monopole which\nis invariant in a precise sense. Moreover, we also study the large mass limit\nunder which we give precise results on the bubbling behavior of our monopoles.\nTowards the end an irreducible $SU(2)$ Hermitian-Yang-Mills connection on the\nStenzel metric is constructed explicitly.\n", "  We study the question to what extent spectral information of a Schr\\\"odinger\noperator on a finite, compact metric graph subject to standard or $\\delta$-type\nmatching conditions can be recovered from a corresponding Titchmarsh-Weyl\nfunction on the boundary of the graph. In contrast to the case of ordinary or\npartial differential operators, the knowledge of the Titchmarsh-Weyl function\nis in general not sufficient for recovering the complete spectrum of the\noperator (or the potentials on the edges). However, it is shown that those\neigenvalues with sufficiently high (depending on the cyclomatic number of the\ngraph) multiplicities can be recovered. Moreover, we prove that under certain\nadditional conditions the Titchmarsh-Weyl function contains even the full\nspectral information.\n", "  We prove that the fluctuations of mesocopic linear statistics for orthogonal\npolynomial ensembles are universal in the sense that two measures with\nasymptotic recurrence coefficients have the same asymptotic mesoscopic\nfluctuations (under an additional assumption on the local regularity of one of\nthe measures). The convergence rate of the recurrence coefficients determines\nthe range of scales on which the limiting fluctuations are identical. Our main\ntool is an analysis of the Green's function for the associated Jacobi matrices.\nAs a particular consequence we obtain a Central Limit Theorem for the modified\nJacobi Unitary Ensembles on all mesosopic scales.\n", "  Over the past years it became evident that the quality factor of a\nsuperconducting cavity is not only determined by its surface preparation\nprocedure, but is also influenced by the way the cavity is cooled down.\nMoreover, different data sets exists, some of them indicate that a slow\ncool-down through the critical temperature is favourable while other data\nstates the exact opposite. Even so there where speculations and some models\nabout the role of thermo-currents and flux-pinning, the difference in behaviour\nremained a mystery. In this paper we will for the first time present a\nconsistent theoretical model which we confirmed by data that describes the role\nof thermo-currents, driven by temperature gradients and material transitions.\nWe will clearly show how they impact the quality factor of a cavity, discuss\nour findings, relate it to findings at other labs and develop mitigation\nstrategies which especially addresses the issue of achieving high quality\nfactors of so-called nitrogen doped cavities in horizontal test.\n", "  The large N dynamics of a subsector of d=0 interacting complex multi matrix\nsystems, which is naturally parametrized by a matrix valued radial coordinate,\nand which embodies the canonical AdS/CFT relationship between 't Hooft's\ncoupling constant and radius, is obtained. Unlike the case of the single\ncomplex matrix, for two or more complex matrices a new repulsive logarithmic\npotential is present, as a result of which the density of radial eigenvalues\nhas support on an hyper annulus. For the single complex matrix, the integral\nover the angular degrees of freedom of the Yang-Mills interaction can be\ncarried out exactly, and in the presence of an harmonic potential, the density\nof radial eigenvalues is shown to be of the Wigner type.\n", "  In this effort we exactly solve the fractional diffusion-advection equation\nfor solar cosmic-ray transport proposed in \\cite{LE2014} and give its {\\it\ngeneral solution} in terms of hypergeometric distributions. Also, we regain all\nthe results and approximations given in \\cite{LE2014} as {\\it particular cases}\nof our general solution.\n", "  It is well known that non-abelian Yang-Mills theories present non-trivial\nminima of the action, the so-called instantons. In the context of electroweak\ntheories these instanton solutions may induce violations of baryon and lepton\nnumber of the form $\\Delta B = \\Delta L = n_f$, with $n_f$ being the number of\nfamilies coupled to the gauge group. An interesting feature of these violations\nis that the flavor structure of the gauge couplings is inherited by the\ninstanton transitions. This effect is generally neglected in the literature. We\nwill show that the inclusion of flavor interactions in the instanton solutions\nmay be interesting in certain theoretical frameworks and will provide an\napproach to include these effects. In particular we will perform this\nimplementation in the non-universal $SU(2)_l \\otimes SU(2)_h \\otimes U(1)_Y$\nmodel that singularizes the third family. Within this framework, we will use\nthe instanton transitions to set a bound on the $SU(2)_h$ gauge coupling.\n", "  We prove using invariance under the modular $S$- and $ST$-transformations\nthat every unitary two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) of only\neven-spin operators (with no extended chiral algebra and with central charges\n$c,\\tilde{c}>1$) contains a primary operator with dimension $\\Delta_1$\nsatisfying $0 < \\Delta_1 < (c+\\tilde{c})/24 + 0.09280...$ After deriving both\nanalytical and numerical bounds, we discuss how to extend our methods to bound\nhigher conformal dimensions before deriving lower and upper bounds on the\nnumber of primary operators in a given energy range. Using the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$\ndictionary, the bound on $\\Delta_1$ proves the lightest massive excitation in\nappropriate theories of 3D matter and gravity with cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda < 0$ can be no heavier than $1/(8G_N)+O(\\sqrt{-\\Lambda})$; the bounds\non the number operators are related via AdS/CFT to the entropy of states in the\ndual gravitational theory. In the flat-space approximation, the limiting mass\nis exactly that of the lightest BTZ black hole.\n", "  We consider the interplay between magnetic skyrmions in an insulating thin\nfilm and the Dirac surface states of a 3D topological insulator (TI), coupled\nby proximity effect. The magnetic texture of skyrmions can lead to confinement\nof Dirac states at the skyrmion radius, where out of plane magnetization\nvanishes. This confinement can result in charging of the skyrmion texture. The\npresence of bound states is robust in an external magnetic field, which is\nneeded to stabilize skyrmions. It is expected that for relevant experimental\nparameters skyrmions will have a few bound states that can be tuned using an\nexternal magnetic field. We argue that these charged skyrmions can be\nmanipulated directly by an electric field, with skyrmion mobility proportional\nto the number of bound states at the skyrmion radius. Coupling skyrmionic thin\nfilms to a TI surface can provide a more direct and efficient way of\ncontrolling skyrmion motion in insulating materials. This provides a new\ndimension in the study of skyrmion manipulation.\n", "  We use alternative quantisation of the D3-D5 system to explore properties of\na strongly coupled anyon material at finite density and temperature. We study\nthe transport properties of the material and find both diffusion and massive\nholographic zero sound modes. By studying the anyon number conductivity we also\nfind evidence for the anyonic analogue of the metal-insulator transition.\n", "  We study the kinetic Kuramoto model for coupled oscillators with coupling\nconstant below the synchronization threshold. We manage to prove that, for any\nanalytic initial datum, if the interaction is small enough, the order parameter\nof the model vanishes exponentially fast, and the solution is asymptotically\ndescribed by a free flow. This behavior is similar to the phenomenon of Landau\ndamping in plasma physics. In the proof we use a combination of techniques from\nLandau damping and from abstract Cauchy-Kowalewskaya theorem.\n", "  This work addresses the problem of relaxation of open systems to\nquasi-equilibrium states. Time-dependent density matrix of two arbitrary\ncoupled quantum oscillators of arbitrary properties interacting with separate\nreservoirs is derived based on path integration. Temporal dynamics of spatial\nvariances and covariances of the oscillators from any given time up to\nquasi-equilibrium steady states is studied. It is demonstrated for general case\nthat asymptotic spatial variances of two arbitrary oscillators and their\ncovariances achieve stationary values in the long-time limit. A comparison of\nsteady state characteristics of coupled oscillators with those predicted by the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) is performed. It is shown that the larger\nthe difference in masses and eigenfrequencies of coupled oscillators, the\nsmaller are the deviations of stationary variances from those given by the FDT\nat fixed coupling strength and fixed difference in temperatures between thermal\nbaths. In framework of the model of the bilinear interaction and Ohmic\ndissipation and at any oscillators parameters the variances and covariances\nhave divergent character at strong couplings.\n", "  Computational mechanics quantifies structure in a stochastic process via its\ncausal states, leading to the process's minimal, optimal predictor---the\n$\\epsilon$-machine. We extend computational mechanics to communication channels\nbetween two processes, obtaining an analogous optimal model---the\n$\\epsilon$-transducer---of the stochastic mapping between them. Here, we lay\nthe foundation of a structural analysis of communication channels, treating\njoint processes and processes with input. The result is a principled structural\nanalysis of mechanisms that support information flow between processes. It is\nthe first in a series on the structural information theory of memoryful\nchannels, channel composition, and allied conditional information measures.\n", "  We summarize the status of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ determinations,\nincluding the long standing tension among exclusive and inclusive\ndeterminations. We also discuss $B$ meson semileptonic decays to excited states\nof the charm meson spectrum and leptonic and semileptonic $B$ decays into final\nstates which include $\\tau$ leptons.\n", "  We consider the so called hyperon puzzle of neutron star (NS). We employ\nSkyrme force models for the description of in-medium nucleon-nucleon,\nnucleon-Lambda hyperon ($N\\Lambda$), and Lambda-Lambda ($\\Lambda\\Lambda$)\ninteractions. A phenomenological finite-range force for the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$\ninteraction is considered as well. Equation of state (EoS) of NS matter is\nobtained in the framework of density functional theory, and\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are solved to obtain the mass-radius\nrelations of NSs. It has been generally known that the existence of hyperons in\nthe NS matter is not well supported by the recent discovery of large-mass NSs\n($M \\simeq 2 M_\\odot$) since hyperons make the EoS softer than the one without\nthem. For the selected interaction models, $N\\Lambda$ interactions reduce the\nmaximum mass of NS by about 30~\\%, while $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interactions can give\nabout 10~\\% enhancement. Consequently, we find that some Skyrme force models\npredict the maximum mass of NS consistent with the observation of $2 M_\\odot$\nNSs, and at the same time satisfy observationally constrained mass-radius\nrelations.\n", "  The flow of Ree-Eyring and Casson non-Newtonian fluids is investigated using\na variational principle to optimize the total stress. The\nvariationally-obtained solutions are compared to the analytical solutions\nderived from the Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch-Mooney equation and the results are\nfound to be identical within acceptable numerical errors and modeling\napproximations.\n", "  We compute Wigner functions for the harmonic oscillator including corrections\nfrom generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs), and study the corresponding\nmarginal probability densities and other properties. We show that the GUP\ncorrections to the Wigner functions can be significant, and comment on their\npotential measurability in the laboratory.\n", "  We consider the magnetic AC Stark effect for the quantum dynamics of a single\nparticle in the plane under the influence of an oscillating homogeneous\nelectric and a constant perpendicular magnetic field. We prove that the\nelectron cyclotron resonance is insensitive to impurity potentials.\n", "  Mirror manifolds to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds are encoded in algebraic\ncurves. The quantization of these curves leads naturally to quantum-mechanical\noperators on the real line. We show that, for a large number of local del Pezzo\nCalabi-Yau threefolds, these operators are of trace class. In some simple\ngeometries, like local P2, we calculate the integral kernel of the\ncorresponding operators in terms of Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm. Their\nspectral traces are expressed in terms of multi-dimensional integrals, similar\nto the state-integrals appearing in three-manifold topology, and we show that\nthey can be evaluated explicitly in some cases. Our results provide further\nverifications of a recent conjecture which gives an explicit expression for the\nFredholm determinant of these operators, in terms of enumerative invariants of\nthe underlying Calabi-Yau threefolds.\n", "  Identifying community structure in networks is an issue of particular\ninterest in network science. The modularity introduced by Newman and Girvan\n[Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004)] is the most popular quality function for\ncommunity detection in networks. In this study, we identify a problem in the\nconcept of modularity and suggest a solution to overcome this problem.\nSpecifically, we obtain a new quality function for community detection. We\nrefer to the function as Z-modularity because it measures the Z-score of a\ngiven division with respect to the fraction of the number of edges within\ncommunities. Our theoretical analysis shows that Z-modularity mitigates the\nresolution limit of the original modularity in certain cases. Computational\nexperiments using both artificial networks and well-known real-world networks\ndemonstrate the validity and reliability of the proposed quality function.\n", "  Motivated by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, covariance, and a minimum\nmeasurable time, we propose a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra and show\nthat this leads to corrections to all quantum mechanical systems. We also\ndemonstrate that such a deformation implies a discrete spectrum for time. In\nother words, time behaves like a crystal. As an application of our formalism,\nwe analyze the effect of such a deformation on the rate of spontaneous emission\nin a hydrogen atom.\n", "  The Collins-Williams Regge calculus models of FLRW space-times and Brewin's\nsubdivided models are applied to closed vacuum $\\Lambda$-FLRW universes. In\neach case, we embed the Regge Cauchy surfaces into 3-spheres in $\\mathbf{E}^4$\nand consider possible measures of Cauchy surface radius that can be derived\nfrom the embedding. Regge equations are obtained from both global variation,\nwhere entire sets of identical edges get varied simultaneously, and local\nvariation, where each edge gets varied individually. We explore the\nrelationship between the two sets of solutions, the conditions under which the\nRegge Hamiltonian constraint would be a first integral of the evolution\nequation, the initial value equation for each model at its moment of time\nsymmetry, and the performance of the various models. It is revealed that local\nvariation does not generally lead to a viable Regge model. It is also\ndemonstrated that the various models do satisfy their respective initial value\nequations. Finally, it is shown that the models reproduce the behaviour of the\ncontinuum model rather well initially, with performance improving as we\nincrease the number of tetrahedra used to construct the Regge Cauchy surface.\nEventually though, all models gradually fail to keep up with the continuum FLRW\nmodel's expansion, with the models with lower numbers of tetrahedra falling\naway more quickly. We believe this failure to keep up is due to the finite\nresolution of the Regge Cauchy surfaces trying to approximate an ever expanding\ncontinuum Cauchy surface; each Regge surface has a fixed number of tetrahedra\nand as the surface being approximated gets larger, the resolution would\ndegrade. Finally, we note that all Regge models end abruptly at a point when\nthe time-like struts of the skeleton become null, though this end-point appears\nto get delayed as the number of tetrahedra is increased.\n", "  We study up to 8-derivative terms in the Coulomb branch effective action of\n(1,1) little string theory, by collecting results of 4-gluon scattering\namplitudes from both perturbative 6D super-Yang-Mills theory up to 4-loop\norder, and tree-level double scaled little string theory (DSLST). In previous\nwork we have matched the 6-derivative term from the 6D gauge theory to DSLST,\nindicating that this term is protected on the entire Coulomb branch. The\n8-derivative term, on the other hand, is unprotected. In this paper we compute\nthe 8-derivative term by interpolating from the two limits, near the origin and\nnear the infinity on the Coulomb branch, numerically from SU(k) SYM and DSLST\nrespectively, for k=2,3,4,5. We discuss the implication of this result on the\nUV completion of 6D SYM as well as the strong coupling completion of DSLST. We\nalso comment on analogous interpolating functions in the Coulomb phase of\ncircle-compactified (2,0) little string theory.\n", "  Charge fluctuations in nano-circuits with capacitor components are shown to\ngive rise to a novel type of long-ranged interaction, which co-exist with the\nregular Casimir/van der Waals force. The developed theory distinguishes between\nthermal and quantum mechanical effects, and it is applied to capacitors\ninvolving graphene nanostructures. The charge fluctuations mechanism is\ncaptured via the capacitance of the system with geometrical and quantum\nmechanical components. The dependence on the distance separation, temperature,\nsize, and response properties of the system shows that this type of force can\nhave a comparable and even dominant effect to the Casimir interaction. Our\nresults strongly indicate that fluctuations induced interactions due to various\nthermodynamic quantities can have important thermal and quantum mechanical\ncontributions at the micro- and nanoscale.\n", "  We show that certain singularities of the Hamiltonian in the complex wave\nvector space can be used to identify topological quantum phase transitions for\n$1D$ chiral topological superconductors/superfluids in the BDI class. These\nsingularities fall into the category of the so-called exceptional points\n($EP$'s) studied in the context of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open\nquantum systems. We also propose a generic formula in terms of the properties\nof the $EP$'s to quantify the exact number of Majorana zero modes in a\nparticular chiral topological superconducting phase, given the values of the\nparameters appearing in the Hamiltonian. This formula serves as an alternative\nto the familiar integer ($\\mathbb{Z}$) winding number invariant characterizing\ntopological superconductor/superfluid phases in the chiral BDI class.\n", "  This programmatic paper lays down the possibility to reconcile the necessity\nto resum many-body correlations into the energy kernel with the fact that safe\nmulti-reference energy density functional (EDF) calculations cannot be achieved\nwhenever the Pauli principle is not strictly enforced, as is for example the\ncase when many-body correlations are parametrized under the form of empirical\ndensity dependencies. Our proposal is to exploit a newly developed ab initio\nmany-body formalism to guide the construction of safe, explicitly correlated\nand systematically improvable parametrizations of the {\\it off-diagonal} energy\nand norm kernels that lie at the heart of the nuclear EDF method. The many-body\nformalism of interest relies on the concepts of symmetry breaking {\\it and}\nrestoration that have made the fortune of the nuclear EDF method and is, as\nsuch, amenable to this guidance. After elaborating on our proposal, we briefly\noutline the project we plan to execute in the years to come.\n", "  We report the first application of critical cluster techniques to the Mott\nmetal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide. We show that the geometric\nproperties of the metallic and insulating puddles observed by scanning\nnear-field infrared microscopy are consistent with the system passing near\ncriticality of the random field Ising model as temperature is varied. The\nresulting large barriers to equilibrium may be the source of the unusually\nrobust hysteresis phenomena associated with the metal-insulator transition in\nthis system.\n", "  We use a set of hydrodynamical (Hydro) and dark matter only (DMonly)\nsimulations to calibrate the halo mass function (HMF). We explore the impact of\nbaryons, propose an improved parametrization for spherical overdensity masses\nand identify differences between our DMonly HMF and previously published HMFs.\nWe use the \\textit{Magneticum} simulations, which are well suited because of\ntheir accurate treatment of baryons, high resolution, and large cosmological\nvolumes of up to $(3818~\\textrm{Mpc})^3$. Baryonic effects globally decrease\nthe masses of galaxy clusters, which, at a given mass, results in a decrease of\ntheir number density. This effect vanishes at high redshift $z\\sim2$ and for\nhigh masses $M_{200\\textrm m}\\gtrsim10^{14}M\\odot$. We perform cosmological\nanalyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the South\nPole Telescope (SPT), \\textit{Planck}, and eROSITA. We pursue two main\nquestions: (1) What is the impact of baryons? -- For the SPT-like and the\n\\textit{Planck}-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results is\nnegligible. In the eROSITA-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impact\nleads to an underestimate of $\\Omega_\\textrm m$ by about $0.01$, which is\ncomparable to the expected uncertainty from eROSITA. (2) How does our DMonly\nHMF compare with previous work? -- For the \\textit{Planck}-like sample, results\nobtained using our DMonly HMF are shifted by\n$\\Delta(\\sigma_8)\\simeq\\Delta(\\sigma_8(\\Omega_\\textrm m/0.27)^{0.3})\\simeq0.02$\nwith respect to results obtained using the Tinker et al. (2008) fit. This\nsuggests that using our HMF would shift results from \\textit{Planck} clusters\ntoward better agreement with CMB anisotropy measurements. Finally, we discuss\nbiases that can be introduced through inadequate HMF parametrizations that\nintroduce false cosmological sensitivity.\n", "  Many recent studies have highlighted certain failures of the standard\nEulerian-space cosmological perturbation theory (SPT). Its problems include (1)\nnot capturing large-scale bulk flows [leading to an O(1) error in the 1-loop\nSPT prediction for the baryon acoustic peak in the correlation function], (2)\nassuming that the Universe behaves as a pressureless, inviscid fluid, and (3)\ntreating fluctuations on scales that are non-perturbative as if they were.\nRecent studies have highlighted the successes of perturbation theory in\nLagrangian space or theories that solve equations for the effective dynamics of\nsmoothed fields. Both approaches mitigate some or all of the aforementioned\nissues with SPT. We discuss these physical developments by specializing to the\nsimplified 1D case of gravitationally interacting sheets, which allows us to\nsubstantially reduces the analytic overhead and still (as we show) maintain\nmany of the same behaviors as in 3D. In 1D, linear-order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory (\"the Zeldovich approximation\") is exact up to shell\ncrossing, and we prove that n^{th}-order Eulerian perturbation theory converges\nto the Zeldovich approximation as n goes to infinity. In no 1D cosmology that\nwe consider (including a CDM-like case and power-law models) do these theories\ndescribe accurately the matter power spectrum on any mildly nonlinear scale. We\nfind that theories based on effective equations are much more successful at\ndescribing the dynamics. Finally, we discuss many topics that have recently\nappeared in the perturbation theory literature such as beat coupling, the shift\nand smearing of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, and the advantages of\nFourier versus configuration space. Our simplified 1D case serves as an\nintuitive review of these perturbation theory results.\n", "  Using conformal field theory (CFT) arguments we derive an infinite number of\nconstraints on the large spin expansion of the anomalous dimensions and\nstructure constants of higher spin operators. These arguments rely only on\nanaliticity, unitarity, crossing-symmetry and the structure of the conformal\npartial wave expansion. We obtain results for both, perturbative CFT to all\norder in the perturbation parameter, as well as non-perturbatively. For the\ncase of conformal gauge theories this provides a proof of the reciprocity\nprinciple to all orders in perturbation theory and provides a new \"reciprocity\"\nprinciple for structure constants. We argue that these results extend also to\nnon-conformal theories.\n", "  In this letter, we present the NNLL-NNLO transverse momentum Higgs\ndistribution arising from gluon fusion. In the regime $p_\\perp\\ll m_H$ we\ninclude the resummation of the large logs at next to next-to leading order and\nthen match on to the $\\alpha_s^2$ fixed order result near $p_\\perp \\sim m_h$.\nBy utilizing the rapidity renormalization group (RRG) we are able to smoothly\nmatch between the resummed, small $p_\\perp$ regime and the fixed order regime.\nWe give a detailed discussion of the scale dependence of the result including\nan analysis of the rapidity scale dependence. Our central value differs from\nprevious results, in the transition region as well as the tail, by an amount\nwhich is outside the error band. This difference is due to the fact that the\nRRG profile allows us to smoothly turn off the resummation.\n", "  An extension of the Standard Model with an additional Higgs singlet is\nanalyzed. Bounds on singlet admixture in 125 GeV h boson from electroweak\nradiative corrections and data on h production and decays are obtained.\nPossibility of double h production enhancement at 14 TeV LHC due to heavy higgs\ncontribution is considered.\n", "  We investigate, within Floquet theory, topological phases in the\nout-of-equilibrium system that consists of fermions in a circularly shaken\nhoneycomb optical lattice. We concentrate on the intermediate regime, in which\nthe shaking frequency is of the same order of magnitude as the band width, such\nthat adjacent Floquet bands start to overlap, creating a hierarchy of band\ninversions. It is shown that two-phonon resonances provide a topological phase\nthat can be described within the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model of HgTe quantum\nwells. This allows for an understanding of out-of-equilibrium topological\nphases in terms of simple band inversions, similar to equilibrium systems.\n", "  Objective: Improve the reconstructed image with fast and multi-class\ndictionaries learning when magnetic resonance imaging is accelerated by\nundersampling the k-space data. Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning\nmethod is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to providing\nadaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is\ndivided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and\ndictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with\nthe multi-class dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain\nimaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling\npatterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art\nmagnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are\nbetter suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared\nmethods. Besides, the computation of the proposed approach is much faster than\nthe typical K-SVD dictionary learning method in magnetic resonance image\nreconstruction. Significance: The proposed method can be exploited in\nundersapmled magnetic resonance imaging to reduce data acquisition time and\nreconstruct images with better image quality.\n", "  It is almost 80 years since Hans Bethe described the level density as a\nnon-interacting gas of protons and neutrons. In all these years, experimental\ndata were interpreted within this picture of a fermionic gas. However, the\nrenewed interest of measuring level density using various techniques calls for\na revision of this description. In particular, the wealth of nuclear level\ndensities measured with the Oslo method favors the constant-temperature level\ndensity over the Fermi-gas picture. From the basis of experimental data, we\ndemonstrate that nuclei exhibit a constant-temperature level density behavior\nfor all mass regions and at least up to the neutron threshold.\n", "  We aim at contributing to the resolution of three of the fundamental puzzles\nrelated to the still unsolved problem of the structure of the dense core of\ncompact stars (CS): (i) the hyperon puzzle: how to reconcile pulsar masses of\n$2\\,$M$_\\odot$ with the hyperon softening of the equation of state (EoS); (ii)\nthe masquerade problem: modern EoS for cold, high density hadronic and quark\nmatter are almost identical; and (iii) the reconfinement puzzle: what to do\nwhen after a deconfinement transition the hadronic EoS becomes favorable again?\nWe show that taking into account the compositeness of baryons (by excluded\nvolume and/or quark Pauli blocking) on the hadronic side and confining and\nstiffening effects on the quark matter side results in an early phase\ntransition to quark matter with sufficient stiffening at high densities which\nremoves all three present-day puzzles of CS interiors. Moreover, in this new\nclass of EoS for hybrid CS falls the interesting case of a strong first order\nphase transition which results in the observable high mass twin star\nphenomenon, an astrophysical observation of a critical endpoint in the QCD\nphase diagram.\n", "  We investigate the electronic specific heat of overdoped\nBaFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ single crystals in the superconducting\nstate using high-resolution nanocalorimetry. From the measurements, we extract\nthe doping dependence of the condensation energy, superconducting gap $\\Delta$,\nand related microscopic parameters. We find that the anomalous scaling of the\nspecific heat jump $\\Delta C \\propto T_{\\mathrm{c}}^3$, found in many\niron-based superconductors, in this system originates from a\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$-dependent ratio $\\Delta/k_\\mathrm{B}T_\\mathrm{c}$ in combination\nwith a doping-dependent density of states $N(\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{F})$. A clear\nenhancement is seen in the effective mass $m^{*}$ as the composition approaches\nthe value that has been associated with a quantum critical point at optimum\ndoping. However, a simultaneous increase in the superconducting carrier\nconcentration $n_\\mathrm{s}$ maintains the superfluid density, yielding an\napparent penetration depth $\\lambda$ that decreases with increasing\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$ without sharp divergence at the quantum critical point. Uemura\nscaling indicates that $T_\\mathrm{c}$ is governed by the Fermi temperature\n$T_\\mathrm{F}$ for this multi-band system.\n", "  We revisit two old and apparently little known papers by Basuev [2] [3] and\nshow that the results contained there yield strong improvements on current\nlower bounds of the convergence radius of the Mayer series for continuous\nparticle systems interacting via a very large class of stable and tempered\npotentials which includes the Lennard-Jones type potentials. In particular we\nanalyze the case of the classical Lennard-Jones gas under the light of the\nBasuev scheme and, using also some new results [33] on this model recently\nobtained by one of us, we provide a new lower bound for the Mayer series\nconvergence radius of the classical Lennard-Jones gas which improves by a\nfactor of the order $10^5$ on the current best lower bound recently obtained in\n[17].\n", "  We perform a weak-lensing study of the nearby cool-core galaxy clusters,\nHydra A ($z=0.0538$) and A478 ($z=0.0881$), of which brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs) host powerful activities of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For each\ncluster, the observed tangential shear profile is well described either by a\nsingle Navarro--Frenk--White model or a two-component model including the BCG\nas an unresolved point mass. For A478, we determine the BCG and its host-halo\nmasses from a joint fit to weak-lensing and stellar photometry measurements. We\nfind that the choice of initial mass functions (IMFs) can introduce a factor of\ntwo uncertainty in the BCG mass, whereas the BCG host halo mass is well\nconstrained by data. We perform a joint analysis of weak-lensing and stellar\nkinematics data available for the Hydra A cluster, which allows us to constrain\nthe central mass profile without assuming specific IMFs. We find that the\ncentral mass profile ($r<300$kpc) determined from the joint analysis is in\nexcellent agreement with those from independent measurements, including\ndynamical masses estimated from the cold gas disk component, X-ray hydrostatic\ntotal mass estimates, and the central stellar mass estimated based on the\nSalpeter IMF. The observed dark-matter fraction around the BCG for Hydra A is\nfound to be smaller than those predicted by adiabatic contraction models,\nsuggesting the importance of other physical processes, such as the the AGN\nfeedback and/or dissipationless mergers.\n", "  Particle-in-cell (PIC) is the most used algorithm to perform self-consistent\ntracking of intense charged particle beams. It is based on depositing\nmacro-particles on a grid, and subsequently solving on it the Poisson equation.\nIt is well known that PIC algorithms occupy intrinsic limitations as they\nintroduce numerical noise. Although not significant for short-term tracking,\nthis becomes important in simulations for circular machines over millions of\nturns as it may induce artificial diffusion of the beam.\n  In this work, we present a modeling of numerical noise induced by PIC\nalgorithms, and discuss its influence on particle dynamics. The combined effect\nof particle tracking and noise created by PIC algorithms leads to correlated or\ndecorrelated numerical noise. For decorrelated numerical noise we derive a\nscaling law for the simulation parameters, allowing an estimate of artificial\nemittance growth. Lastly, the effect of correlated numerical noise is\ndiscussed, and a mitigation strategy is proposed.\n", "  Classical correlations of ground states typically decay exponentially and\npolynomially, respectively for gapped and gapless short-ranged quantum spin\nsystems. In such systems, entanglement decays exponentially even at the quantum\ncritical points. However, quantum discord, an information-theoretic quantum\ncorrelation measure, survives long lattice distances. We investigate the\neffects of quenched disorder on quantum correlation lengths of quenched\naveraged entanglement and quantum discord, in the anisotropic XY and XYZ spin\nglass and random field chains. We find that there is virtually neither\nreduction nor enhancement in entanglement length while quantum discord length\nincreases significantly with the introduction of the quenched disorder.\n", "  In the present article we shall consider the torsional completion of a\ngravitational background that is filled with electrodynamically interacting\nmaterial fields, taken to be of fermionic type, eventually deriving properties\nlike the impossibility of singularities and the possibility of confinement,\nboth necessary for a correct quantum description.\n", "  Feedback in massive galaxies generally involves quenching of star formation,\na favored candidate being outflows from a central supermassive black hole. At\nhigh redshifts however, explanation of the huge rates of star formation often\nfound in galaxies containing AGN may require a more vigorous mode of star\nformation than attainable by simply enriching the gas content of galaxies in\nthe usual gravitationally-driven mode that is associated with the nearby\nUniverse. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that\nAGN-pressure-driven star formation potentially provides the positive feedback\nthat may be required to generate the accelerated star formation rates observed\nin the distant Universe.\n", "  The quantum mechanical counterpart of the famous Stoner-Wohlfarth model -- an\neasy-axis magnet in a tilted magnetic field -- is studied theoretically and\nthrough simulations, as a function of the spin-size $S$ in a sweeping\nlongitudinal field. Beyond the classical Stoner-Wohlfarth transition, the\nsweeping field-induced adiabatic change of states slows down as $S$ increases,\nleading to a dynamical quantum phase transition. This result is described as a\ncritical phenomenon associated with Landau-Zener tunneling gaps at metastable\nquasi-avoided crossings. Furthermore, a beating of the magnetization is\ndiscovered after the Stoner-Wohlfarth transition. The period of the beating,\nobtained analytically, arises from a new type of quantum phase factor.\n", "  We propose a semiclassical method to calculate S-matrix elements for\ntwo-stage gravitational transitions involving matter collapse into a black hole\nand evaporation of the latter. The method consistently incorporates\nback-reaction of the collapsing and emitted quanta on the metric. We illustrate\nthe method in several toy models describing spherical self-gravitating shells\nin asymptotically flat and AdS space-times. We find that electrically neutral\nshells reflect via the above collapse-evaporation process with probability\nexp(-B), where B is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the intermediate black\nhole. This is consistent with interpretation of exp(B) as the number of black\nhole states. The same expression for the probability is obtained in the case of\ncharged shells if one takes into account instability of the Cauchy horizon of\nthe intermediate Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Our semiclassical method opens\na new systematic approach to the gravitational S-matrix in the non-perturbative\nregime.\n", "  If quantum gravity respects the principles of quantum mechanics, suitably\ngeneralized, it may be that a more viable approach to the theory is through\nidentifying the relevant quantum structures rather than by quantizing classical\nspacetime. This viewpoint is supported by difficulties of such quantization,\nand by the apparent lack of a fundamental role for locality. In finite or\ndiscrete quantum systems, important structure is provided by tensor\nfactorizations of the Hilbert space. However, even in local quantum field\ntheory properties of the generic type III von Neumann algebras and of long\nrange gauge fields indicate that factorization of the Hilbert space is\nproblematic. Instead it is better to focus on the structure of the algebra of\nobservables, and in particular on its subalgebras corresponding to regions.\nThis paper suggests that study of analogous algebraic structure in gravity\ngives an important perspective on the nature of the quantum theory. Significant\ndepartures from the subalgebra structure of local quantum field theory are\nfound, working in the correspondence limit of long-distances/low-energies.\nParticularly, there are obstacles to identifying commuting algebras of\nlocalized operators. In addition to suggesting important properties of the\nalgebraic structure, this and related observations pose challenges to proposals\nof a fundamental role for entanglement.\n", "  We present a case study describing efforts to optimise and modernise \"Modal\",\nthe simulation and analysis pipeline used by the Planck satellite experiment\nfor constraining general non-Gaussian models of the early universe via the\nbispectrum (or three-point correlator) of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation. We focus on one particular element of the code: the projection of\nbispectra from the end of inflation to the spherical shell at decoupling, which\ndefines the CMB we observe today. This code involves a three-dimensional inner\nproduct between two functions, one of which requires an integral, on a\nnon-rectangular domain containing a sparse grid. We show that by employing\nseparable methods this calculation can be reduced to a one-dimensional\nsummation plus two integrations, reducing the overall dimensionality from four\nto three. The introduction of separable functions also solves the issue of the\nnon-rectangular sparse grid. This separable method can become unstable in\ncertain cases and so the slower non-separable integral must be calculated\ninstead. We present a discussion of the optimisation of both approaches. We\nshow significant speed-ups of ~100x, arising from a combination of algorithmic\nimprovements and architecture-aware optimisations targeted at improving thread\nand vectorisation behaviour. The resulting MPI/OpenMP hybrid code is capable of\nexecuting on clusters containing processors and/or coprocessors, with\nstrong-scaling efficiency of 98.6% on up to 16 nodes. We find that a single\ncoprocessor outperforms two processor sockets by a factor of 1.3x and that\nrunning the same code across a combination of both microarchitectures improves\nperformance-per-node by a factor of 3.38x. By making bispectrum calculations\ncompetitive with those for the power spectrum (or two-point correlator) we are\nnow able to consider joint analysis for cosmological science exploitation of\nnew data.\n", "  We statistically quantify the amount of substructure in the Milky Way stellar\nhalo using a sample of 4568 halo K giant stars at Galactocentric distances\nranging over 5-125 kpc. These stars have been selected photometrically and\nconfirmed spectroscopically as K giants from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's\nSEGUE project. Using a position-velocity clustering estimator (the 4distance)\nand a model of a smooth stellar halo, we quantify the amount of substructure in\nthe halo, divided by distance and metallicity. Overall, we find that the halo\nas a whole is highly structured. We also confirm earlier work using BHB stars\nwhich showed that there is an increasing amount of substructure with increasing\nGalactocentric radius, and additionally find that the amount of substructure in\nthe halo increases with increasing metallicity. Comparing to resampled BHB\nstars, we find that K giants and BHBs have similar amounts of substructure over\nequivalent ranges of Galactocentric radius. Using a friends-of-friends\nalgorithm to identify members of individual groups, we find that a large\nfraction (~33%) of grouped stars are associated with Sgr, and identify stars\nbelonging to other halo star streams: the Orphan Stream, the Cetus Polar\nStream, and others, including previously unknown substructures. A large\nfraction of sample K giants (more than 50%) are not grouped into any\nsubstructure. We find also that the Sgr stream strongly dominates groups in the\nouter halo for all except the most metal-poor stars, and suggest that this is\nthe source of the increase of substructure with Galactocentric radius and\nmetallicity.\n", "  The exact quantum entropy of BPS black holes can be evaluated using\nlocalization in supergravity. An important ingredient in this program, that has\nbeen lacking so far, is the one-loop effect arising from the quadratic\nfluctuations of the exact deformation (the $Q\\mathcal{V}$ operator). We compute\nthe fluctuation determinant for vector multiplets and hyper multiplets around\n$Q$-invariant off-shell configurations in four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupergravity with $AdS_{2} \\times S^{2}$ boundary conditions, using the\nAtiyah-Bott fixed-point index theorem and a subsequent zeta function\nregularization. Our results extend the large-charge on-shell entropy\ncomputations in the literature to a regime of finite charges. Based on our\nresults, we present an exact formula for the quantum entropy of BPS black holes\nin $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. We explain cancellations concerning\n$\\frac18$-BPS black holes in $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity that were observed in\narXiv:1111.1161. We also make comments about the interpretation of a\nlogarithmic term in the topological string partition function in the low energy\nsupergravity theory.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect in\nfemtosecond time resolution, that is, the time-dependent modulation of a\ndielectric function at around the band gap under an irradiation of an intense\nlaser field. We develop a pump-probe formalism in two distinct approaches:\nfirst-principles simulation based on real-time time-dependent density\nfunctional theory and analytic consideration of a simple two-band model. We\nfind that, while time-average modulation may be reasonably described by the\nstatic Franz-Keldysh theory, a remarkable phase shift is found to appear\nbetween the dielectric response and the applied electric field.\n", "  The exact quantum decay of a one-dimensional Bose gas with inverse-square\ninteractions is presented. The system is equivalent to a gas of particles\nobeying generalized exclusion statistics. We consider the expansion dynamics of\na cloud initially confined in a harmonic trap that is suddenly switched off.\nThe decay is characterized by analyzing the fidelity between the initial and\nthe time-evolving states, also known as the survival probability. It exhibits\nearly on a quadratic dependence on time that turns into a power-law decay,\nduring the course of the evolution. It is shown that the particle number and\nthe strength of interactions determine the power-law exponent in the latter\nregime, as recently conjectured. The nonexponential character of the decay is\nlinked to the many-particle reconstruction of the initial state from the\ndecaying products.\n", "  We use the techniques of supersymmetric localization to compute the BPS black\nhole entropy in N=2 supergravity. We focus on the n_v+1 vector multiplets on\nthe black hole near horizon background which is AdS_2 x S^2 space. We find the\nlocalizing saddle point of the vector multiplets by solving the localization\nequations, and compute the exact one loop partition function on the saddle\npoint. Furthermore, we propose the appropriate functional integration measure.\nThrough this measure, the one loop determinant is written in terms of the\nradius of the physical metric, which depends on the localizing saddle point\nvalue of the vector multiplets. The result for the one loop determinant is\nconsistent with the logarithmic corrections to the BPS black hole entropy from\nvector multiplets.\n", "  We compute the ground-state phase diagram of the Hubbard and frustrated\nHubbard models on the square lattice with density matrix embedding theory using\nclusters of up to 16 sites. We provide an error model to estimate the\nreliability of the computations and complexity of the physics at different\npoints in the diagram. We find superconductivity in the ground-state as well as\ncompetition between inhomogeneous charge, spin, and pairing states at low\ndoping. The estimated errors in the study are below T$_c$ in the cuprates and\non the scale of contributions in real materials that are neglected in the\nHubbard model.\n", "  We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in\nRealistic Environment (FIRE) project to study the galaxy mass-metallicity\nrelations (MZR) from z=0-6. These simulations include explicit models of the\nmulti-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. The simulations cover\nhalo masses Mhalo=10^9-10^13 Msun and stellar mass Mstar=10^4-10^11 Msun at z=0\nand have been shown to produce many observed galaxy properties from z=0-6. For\nthe first time, our simulations agree reasonably well with the observed\nmass-metallicity relations at z=0-3 for a broad range of galaxy masses. We\npredict the evolution of the MZR from z=0-6 as\nlog(Zgas/Zsun)=12+log(O/H)-9.0=0.35[log(Mstar/Msun)-10]+0.93 exp(-0.43 z)-1.05\nand log(Zstar/Zsun)=[Fe/H]-0.2=0.40[log(Mstar/Msun)-10]+0.67 exp(-0.50 z)-1.04,\nfor gas-phase and stellar metallicity, respectively. Our simulations suggest\nthat the evolution of MZR is associated with the evolution of stellar/gas mass\nfractions at different redshifts, indicating the existence of a universal\nmetallicity relation between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicities. In our\nsimulations, galaxies above Mstar=10^6 Msun are able to retain a large fraction\nof their metals inside the halo, because metal-rich winds fail to escape\ncompletely and are recycled into the galaxy. This resolves a long-standing\ndiscrepancy between \"sub-grid\" wind models (and semi-analytic models) and\nobservations, where common sub-grid models cannot simultaneously reproduce the\nMZR and the stellar mass functions.\n", "  We study the stellar population properties of the IRAC-detected $6 \\lesssim z\n\\lesssim 10$ galaxy candidates from the Spitzer UltRa Faint SUrvey Program\n(SURFS UP). Using the Lyman Break selection technique, we find a total of 16\nnew galaxy candidates at $6 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ with $S/N \\geq 3$ in at\nleast one of the IRAC $3.6\\mu$m and $4.5\\mu$m bands. According to the best mass\nmodels available for the surveyed galaxy clusters, these IRAC-detected galaxy\ncandidates are magnified by factors of $\\sim 1.2$--$5.5$. We find that the\nIRAC-detected $6 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ sample is likely not a homogeneous\ngalaxy population: some are relatively massive (stellar mass as high as $4\n\\times 10^9\\,M_{\\odot}$) and evolved (age $\\lesssim 500$ Myr) galaxies, while\nothers are less massive ($M_{\\text{stellar}}\\sim 10^8\\,M_{\\odot}$) and very\nyoung ($\\sim 10$ Myr) galaxies with strong nebular emission lines that boost\ntheir rest-frame optical fluxes. We identify two Ly$\\alpha$ emitters in our\nsample from the Keck DEIMOS spectra, one at $z_{\\text{Ly}\\alpha}=6.76$ (in\nRXJ1347) and one at $z_{\\text{Ly}\\alpha}=6.32$ (in MACS0454). We show that IRAC\n$[3.6]-[4.5]$ color, when combined with photometric redshift, can be used to\nidentify galaxies likely with strong nebular emission lines within certain\nredshift windows.\n", "  Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful technique to probe the\ndark components of the universe. To understand the measurement process of weak\nlensing and the associated systematic effects, image simulations are becoming\nincreasingly important. For this purpose we present a first implementation of\nthe $\\textit{Monte Carlo Control Loops}$ ($\\textit{MCCL}$; Refregier & Amara\n2014), a coherent framework for studying systematic effects in weak lensing. It\nallows us to model and calibrate the shear measurement process using image\nsimulations from the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig; Berge et al. 2013). We\napply this framework to a subset of the data taken during the Science\nVerification period (SV) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We calibrate the UFig\nsimulations to be statistically consistent with DES images. We then perform\ntolerance analyses by perturbing the simulation parameters and study their\nimpact on the shear measurement at the one-point level. This allows us to\ndetermine the relative importance of different input parameters to the\nsimulations. For spatially constant systematic errors and six simulation\nparameters, the calibration of the simulation reaches the weak lensing\nprecision needed for the DES SV survey area. Furthermore, we find a sensitivity\nof the shear measurement to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, and an\ninterplay between the magnitude-size and the pixel value diagnostics in\nconstraining the noise model. This work is the first application of the\n$\\textit{MCCL}$ framework to data and shows how it can be used to methodically\nstudy the impact of systematics on the cosmic shear measurement.\n", "  In this work, we study some physical aspects of unitary evolution of\nBianchi-I model. In particular, we study the behavior of the volume and the\nscale factor as a function of time for the Bianchi-I universe with\nultra-relativistic fluid ($\\alpha=1$). The expectation value of volume is shown\nnot to hit any singularity. We elucidate on the anisotropic nature of the\nsolution and physically interpret the wavefunction as a superposition of\ncollapsing universe and expanding universe mimicking Hartle-Hawking type\nwavefunction. The same analysis has been done for $\\alpha\\neq 1$ as well. The\nwork also comments on how to obtain Vilenkin type wavefunction representing an\nexpanding universe without that being superposed with a solution representing a\ncollapsing universe. We also point at a possible phase transition phenomenon\nfor $\\alpha\\neq1$ case with existence of a critical parameter.\n", "  Using the science verification data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) for a new\nsample of 106 X-Ray selected clusters and groups, we study the stellar mass\ngrowth of Bright Central Galaxies (BCGs) since redshift 1.2. Compared with the\nexpectation in a semi-analytical model applied to the Millennium Simulation,\nthe observed BCGs become under-massive/under-luminous with decreasing redshift.\nWe incorporate the uncertainties associated with cluster mass, redshift, and\nBCG stellar mass measurements into analysis of a redshift-dependent BCG-cluster\nmass relation, $m_{*}\\propto(\\frac{M_{200}}{1.5\\times\n10^{14}M_{\\odot}})^{0.24\\pm 0.08}(1+z)^{-0.19\\pm0.34}$, and compare the\nobserved relation to the model prediction. We estimate the average growth rate\nsince $z = 1.0$ for BCGs hosted by clusters of $M_{200, z}=10^{13.8}M_{\\odot}$,\nat $z=1.0$: $m_{*, BCG}$ appears to have grown by $0.13\\pm0.11$ dex, in tension\nat $\\sim 2.5 \\sigma$ significance level with the $0.40$ dex growth rate\nexpected from the semi-analytic model. We show that the buildup of extended\nintra-cluster light after $z=1.0$ may alleviate this tension in BCG growth\nrates.\n", "  We present the infrared (IR) and X-ray properties of a sample of 33 mid-IR\nluminous quasars ($\\nu$L(6 micron)>6x10$^{44}$ erg/s) at redshift z~1-3,\nidentified through detailed spectral energy distribution analyses of distant\nstar-forming galaxies, using the deepest IR data from Spitzer and Herschel in\nthe GOODS-Herschel fields. The aim is to constrain the fraction of obscured,\nand Compton-thick (CT, N$_H$>1.5x10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) quasars at the peak era\nof nuclear and star-formation activities. Despite being very bright in the\nmid-IR band, ~30% of these quasars are not detected in the extremely deep 2 Ms\nand 4 Ms Chandra X-ray data available in these fields. X-ray spectral analysis\nof the detected sources reveals that the majority (~67%) are obscured by column\ndensities N$_H$>10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$; this fraction reaches ~80% when including\nthe X-ray undetected sources (9 out of 33), which are likely to be the most\nheavily-obscured, CT quasars. We constrain the fraction of CT quasars in our\nsample to be ~24-48%, and their space density to be\n$\\Phi$=(6.7$\\pm$2.2)x10$^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. From the investigation of the quasar\nhost galaxies in terms of star-formation rates (SFRs) and morphological\ndistortions, as a sign of galaxy mergers/interactions, we do not find any\ndirect relation between SFRs and quasar luminosity or X-ray obscuration. On the\nother hand, there is tentative evidence that the most heavily-obscured quasars\nhave, on average, more disturbed morphologies than the\nunobscured/moderately-obscured quasar hosts, which preferentially live in\nundisturbed systems. However, the fraction of quasars with disturbed morphology\namongst the whole sample is ~40%, suggesting that galaxy mergers are not the\nmain fuelling mechanism of quasars at z~2.\n", "  We describe a percolation-type approach to modeling of the processes of aging\nand certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of\ninteracting cells. Tissues are considered as structures made of regular\nhealthy, senescent, dead (apoptotic) cells, and studied dynamically, with the\nongoing processes including regular cell division to fill vacant sites left by\ndead cells, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and other processes.\nStatistical-mechanics description can provide patterns of time dependence and\nsnapshots of morphological system properties. An illustrative application of\nthe developed theoretical modeling approach is reported, confirming recent\nexperimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended\nlifespan.\n", "  Recent experiments in optimally hole-doped iron arsenides have revealed a\nnovel magnetically ordered ground state that preserves tetragonal symmetry,\nconsistent with either a charge-spin density wave (CSDW), which displays a\nnon-uniform magnetization, or a spin-vortex crystal (SVC), which displays a\nnon-collinear magnetization. Here we show that, similarly to the partial\nmelting of the usual stripe antiferromagnet into a nematic phase, either of\nthese phases can also melt in two stages. As a result, intermediate\nparamagnetic phases with vestigial order appears: a checkerboard charge\ndensity-wave for the CSDW ground state, characterized by an Ising-like order\nparameter, and a remarkable spin-vorticity density-wave for the SVC ground\nstate -- a triplet d-density wave characterized by a vector chiral order\nparameter. We propose experimentally detectable signatures of these phases,\nshow that their fluctuations can enhance the superconducting transition\ntemperature, and discuss their relevance to other correlated materials.\n", "  We discuss the possible existence a spin singlet excitation with charge\n$\\pm2$ ($\\eta$-mode) originating the $A_{1g}$ Raman resonance in cuprate\nsuperconductors. This $\\eta$-mode relates the $d$-wave superconducting singlet\npairing channel to a $d$-wave charge channel. We show that the $\\eta$ boson\nforms a particle-particle bound state below the $2\\Delta$ threshold of the\nparticle-hole continuum where $\\Delta$ is the maximum $d$-wave gap. Within a\ngeneralized random phase approximation and Bethe-Salpether approximation study,\nwe find that this mode has energies similar to the resonance observed by\nInelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) below the superconducting (SC) coherent peak\nat $2\\Delta$ in various SC cuprates compounds. We show that it is a very good\ncandidate for the resonance observed in Raman scattering below the $2\\Delta$\npeak in the $A_{1g}$ symmetry. Since the $\\eta$-mode sits in the $S=0$ channel,\nit may be observable via Raman, X -ray or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy\nprobes.\n", "  We study the implications of non-standard Higgs Yukawa couplings to light\nquarks on Higgs-portal dark matter phenomenology. Saturating the present\nexperimental bounds on up-quark, down-quark, or strange-quark Yukawa couplings,\nthe predicted direct dark matter detection scattering rate can increase by up\nto four orders of magnitude. The effect on the dark matter annihilation cross\nsection, on the other hand, is subleading unless the dark matter is very light\n-- a scenario that is already excluded by measurements of the Higgs invisible\ndecay width. We investigate the expected size of corrections in\nmulti-Higgs-doublet models with natural flavor conservation, the type-II\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model, the Giudice-Lebedev model of light quark masses,\nminimal flavor violation new physics models, Randall-Sundrum, and composite\nHiggs models. We find that an enhancement in the dark matter scattering rate of\nan order of magnitude is possible. Finally, we point out that a discovery of\nHiggs-portal dark matter could lead to interesting bounds on the light-quark\nYukawa couplings.\n", "  We study the dominant effect of a long wavelength density perturbation\n$\\delta(\\lambda_L)$ on short distance physics. In the non-relativistic limit,\nthe result is a uniform acceleration, fixed by the equivalence principle, and\ntypically has no effect on statistical averages due to translational\ninvariance. This same reasoning has been formalized to obtain a \"consistency\ncondition\" on the cosmological correlation functions. In the presence of a\nfeature, such as the acoustic peak at $l_{\\rm BAO}$, this naive expectation\nbreaks down for $\\lambda_L<l_{\\rm BAO}$. We calculate a universal piece of the\nthree-point correlation function in this regime. The same effect is shown to\nunderlie the spread of the acoustic peak, and is calculable to all orders in\nthe long modes. This can be used to improve the result of perturbative\ncalculations - a technique known as \"infra-red resummation\" - and is explicitly\napplied to the one-loop calculation of power spectrum. Finally, the success of\nBAO reconstruction schemes is argued to be another empirical evidence for the\nvalidity of the results.\n", "  Recent N-body simulations have shown that Einasto radial profiles provide the\nmost accurate description of dark matter halos. Predictions based on the\ntraditional NFW functional form may fail to describe the structural properties\nof cosmic objects at the percent level required by precision cosmology. We\ncomputed the systematic errors expected for weak lensing analyses of clusters\nof galaxies if one wrongly models the lens density profile. Even though the NFW\nfits of observed tangential shear profiles can be excellent, viral masses and\nconcentrations of very massive halos (>~ 10^{15}M_Sun/h) can be over- and\nunderestimated by ~10 per cent, respectively. Misfitting effects also steepen\nthe observed mass-concentration relation, as observed in multi-wavelength\nobservations of galaxy groups and clusters. Based on shear analyses, Einasto\nand NFW halos can be set apart either with deep observations of exceptionally\nmassive structures (>~ 2\\times10^{15}M_Sun/h) or by stacking the shear profiles\nof thousands of group-sized lenses (>~ 10^{14}M_Sun/h).\n", "  The simulation of the neutron background for Phase II of the SIMPLE direct\ndark matter search experiment is fully reported with various improvements\nrelative to previous estimates. The model employs the Monte Carlo MCNP neutron\ntransport code, using as input a realistic geometry description, measured\nradioassays and material compositions, and tabulated (\\alpha,n) yields and\nspectra. Developments include the accounting of recoil energy distributions,\nconsideration of additional reactions and materials and examination of the\nrelevant (\\alpha,n) data. A thorough analysis of the simulation results is\nperformed that addresses an increased number of non-statistical uncertainties.\nThe referred omissions are seen to provide a net increase of 13$\\%$ in the\npreviously-reported background estimates whereas the non-statistical\nuncertainty rises to 25$\\%$. The final estimated recoil event rate is 0.372\n$\\pm$ 0.002 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.097 (non-stat.) evt/kgd resulting in insignificant\nchanges over the results of the experiment.\n", "  We present our current studies and our future plans on microscopic potential\nbased on effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and many-body theory. This\nframework treats in an unified way nuclear structure and reaction. It offers\nthe opportunity to link the underlying effective interaction to nucleon\nscattering observables. The more consistently connected to a variety of\nreaction and structure experimental data the framework will be, the more\nconstrained effective interaction will be. As a proof of concept, we present\nsome recent results for both neutron and proton scattered from spherical target\nnucleus, namely 40 Ca, using the Gogny D1S interaction. Possible fruitful\ncrosstalks between microscopic potential, phenomenological potential and\neffective interaction are exposed. We then draw some prospective plans for the\nforthcoming years including scattering from spherical nuclei experiencing\npairing correlations, scattering from axially deformed nuclei, and new\neffective interaction with reaction constraints.\n", "  At present the three major unknowns in neutrino oscillation parameters are\nthe mass hierarchy, the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and the CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$.\nIt is well known that the presence of hierarchy$-\\delta_{CP}$ and octant\ndegeneracies affects the unambiguous determination of these parameters. In this\npaper we show that a comprehensive way to study the remaining parameter\ndegeneracies is in the form of a generalized hierarchy-$\\theta_{23}$ -\n$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. We show that the wrong-hierarchy and/or wrong-octant\nsolutions can be further classified into eight different solutions depending on\nwhether they occur with the wrong or right value of $\\delta_{CP}$. These eight\nsolutions are different from the original eightfold degenerate solutions and\ncan exist, in principle, even if $\\theta_{13}$ is known. These multiple\nsolutions, apart from affecting the determination of the true hierarchy and\noctant, also affect the accurate estimation of $\\delta_{CP}$. We identify which\nof these eight different degenerate solutions can occur in the test\n($\\theta_{23} - \\delta_{CP}$) parameter space, taking the long-baseline\nexperiment NO$\\nu$A running in the neutrino mode as an example. The inclusion\nof the NO$\\nu$A antineutrino run removes the wrong-octant solutions appearing\nwith both right and wrong hierarchy. Adding T2K data to this resolves the wrong\nhierarchy -- right octant solutions to a large extent. The remaining wrong\nhierarchy solutions can be removed by combining NO$\\nu$A + T2K with atmospheric\nneutrino data. We demonstrate this using ICAL@INO as the prototype atmospheric\nneutrino detector. We find that the degeneracies can be resolved at the\n$2\\sigma$ level by the combined data set, for the true parameter space\nconsidered in the study.\n", "  It is shown that Quantum Mechanics is ambiguous when predicting relative\nfrequencies for an entangled system if the measurements of both subsystems are\nperformed in spatially separated events. This ambiguity gives way to unphysical\nconsequences: the projection rule could be applied in one or the other\ntemporal(?) order of measurements (being non local in any case), but symmetry\nof the roles of both subsystems would be broken.\n  An alternative theory is presented in which this ambiguity does not exist.\nObservable relative frequencies differ from those of orthodox Quantum\nMechanics, and a {\\it gendaken} experiment is proposed to falsify one or the\nother theory. In the alternative theory, each subsystem has an individual state\nin its own Hilbert space, and the total system state is direct product (rank\none) of both, so there is no entanglement. Correlation between subsystems\nappears through a hidden label that prescribes the output of arbitrary\nhypothetical measurements. Measurement is treated as a usual reversible\ninteraction, and this postulate allows to determine relative frequencies when\nthe value of a magnitude is known without in any way perturbing the system, by\nmeasurement of the correlated companion.\n  It is predicted the existence of an accompanying system, the de Broglie wave,\nintroduced in order to preserve the action reaction principle in indirect\nmeasurements, when there is no interaction of detector and particle. Some\naction on the detector, different from the one cause by a particle, should be\nobservable.\n", "  We motivate and introduce a class of \"hierarchical\" quantum superposition\nstates of $N$ coupled quantum oscillators. Unlike other well-known multimode\nphotonic Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states such as entangled coherent states, the\nhierarchical superposition states are characterized as two-branch\nsuperpositions of tensor products of single-mode Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states. In\naddition to analyzing the photon statistics and quasiprobability distributions\nof prominent examples of these nonclassical states, we consider their\nusefulness for high-precision quantum metrology of nonlinear optical\nHamiltonians and quantify their mode entanglement. We propose two methods for\ngenerating hierarchical superpositions in $N=2$ coupled microwave cavities\nwhich exploit currently existing quantum optical technology for generating\nentanglement between spatially separated electromagnetic field modes.\n", "  We construct a class of 3-point constants in the $sl(4)$ Toda conformal\ntheory $W_4$, extending the examples in Fateev and Litvinov. Their knowledge\nallows to determine the braiding/fusing matrix transforming 4-point conformal\nblocks of one fundamental, labelled by the 6-dimensional $sl(4)$\nrepresentation, and three partially degenerate vertex operators. It is a $3\n\\times 3$ submatrix of the generic $6 \\times 6$ fusing matrix consistent with\nthe fusion rules for the particular class of representations. We check a\nbraiding relation which has wider applications to conformal models with $sl(4)$\nsymmetry. The 3-point constants in dual regions of central charge are compared\nin preparation for a BPS like relation in the $\\hat{sl}(4)$ WZW model.\n", "  Compressed sensing has shown great potentials in accelerating magnetic\nresonance imaging. Fast image reconstruction and high image quality are two\nmain issues faced by this new technology. It has been shown that, redundant\nimage representations, e.g. tight frames, can significantly improve the image\nquality. But how to efficiently solve the reconstruction problem with these\nredundant representation systems is still challenging. This paper attempts to\naddress the problem of applying iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to\ntight frames based magnetic resonance image reconstruction. By introducing the\ncanonical dual frame to construct the orthogonal projection operator on the\nrange of the analysis sparsity operator, we propose a projected iterative\nsoft-thresholding algorithm (pISTA) and further accelerate it by incorporating\nthe strategy proposed by Beck and Teboulle in 2009. We theoretically prove that\npISTA converges to the minimum of a function with a balanced tight frame\nsparsity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves\nbetter reconstruction than the widely used synthesis sparse model and the\naccelerated pISTA converges faster or comparable to the state-of-art smoothing\nFISTA. One major advantage of pISTA is that only one extra parameter, the step\nsize, is introduced and the numerical solution is stable to it in terms of\nimage reconstruction errors, thus allowing easily setting in many fast magnetic\nresonance imaging applications.\n", "  We derive the explicit expression for the four-point correlation function of\nstress-energy tensors in four-dimensional N=4 superconformal theory. We show\nthat it has a remarkably simple and suggestive form allowing us to predict a\nlarge class of four-point correlation functions involving the stress-energy\ntensor and other conserved currents. We then apply the obtained results on the\ncorrelation functions to computing the energy-energy correlations, which\nmeasure the flow of energy in the final states created from the vacuum by a\nsource. We demonstrate that they are given by a universal function independent\nof the choice of the source. Our analysis relies only on N=4 superconformal\nsymmetry and does not use the dynamics of the theory.\n", "  We consider generic models of quintessence and we investigate the influence\nof massive neutrino matter with field-dependent masses on the matter power\nspectrum. In case of minimally coupled neutrino matter, we examine the effect\nin tracker models with inverse power-law and double exponential potentials. We\npresent detailed investigations for the scaling field with a steep exponential\npotential, non-minimally coupled to massive neutrino matter, and we derive\nconstraints on field-dependent neutrino masses from the observational data.\n", "  In recent years, several hacking attacks have broken the security of quantum\ncryptography implementations by exploiting the presence of losses and the\nability of the eavesdropper to tune detection efficiencies. We present a simple\nattack of this form that applies to any protocol in which the key is\nconstructed from the results of untrusted measurements performed on particles\ncoming from an insecure source or channel. Because of its generality, the\nattack applies to a large class of protocols, from standard prepare-and-measure\nto device-independent schemes. Our attack gives bounds on the critical\ndetection efficiencies necessary for secure quantum distribution, which show\nthat the implementation of most partly device independent solutions is, from\nthe point of view of detection efficiency, almost as demanding as fully\ndevice-independent ones. We also show how our attack implies the existence of a\nform of bound randomness, namely non-local correlations in which a\nnon-signalling eavesdropper can find out a posteriori the result of any\nimplemented measurement.\n", "  How sensitive are the predictions of inflation to pre-inflationary conditions\nwhen the number of efolds of inflation is not too large? In an attempt to\naddress this question, we consider a simple model where the inflationary era is\npreceded by an era dominated by a radiation fluid, which is coupled to the\ninflaton only gravitationally and which extends back to the Planck era. We show\nthat there is a natural generalized Bunch-Davies vacuum state for perturbations\nto the coupled inflaton-gravity-fluid system at early times. With this choice\nof initial state the model predicts interesting deviations from the standard\npower spectrum of single field slow-roll inflation at large scales. However,\nthe deviations are too small to be observable in near future CMB observations.\n", "  The order parameter and pairing mechanism for superconductivity in heavy\nfermion compounds are still poorly understood. Scanning tunneling microscopy\nand spectroscopy at ultra-low temperatures can yield important information\nabout the superconducting order parameter and the gap structure. Here, we study\nthe first heavy fermion superconductor, CeCu_2Si_2. Our data show the\nsuperconducting gap which is not fully formed and exhibits features that point\nto a multi-gap order parameter. Spatial mapping of the zero bias conductance in\nmagnetic field reveals the vortex lattice, which allows us to unequivocally\nlink the observed conductance gap to superconductivity in CeCu_2Si_2. The\nvortex lattice is found to be predominantly triangular with distortions at\nfields close to \\sim 0.7 H_{c2}.\n", "  A quantum field theoretical approach, in which a quantum probe is used to\ninvestigate the properties generic non-flat FLRW space-times is discussed. The\nprobe is identified with a conformally coupled massless scalar field defined on\na space-time with horizon and the procedure to investigate the local properties\nis realized by the use of Unruh-DeWitt detector and by the evaluation of the\nregularized quantum fluctuations. In the case of de Sitter space, the\ncoordinate independence of our results is checked, and the Gibbons-Hawking\ntemperature is recovered. A possible generalization to the electromagnetic\nprobe is also briefly indicated.\n", "  The luminous Type IIn Supernova (SN) 2010jl shows strong evidence for the\ninteraction of the SN ejecta with dense circumstellar material (CSM). We\npresent observations of SN 2010jl for $t \\sim 900$ d after its earliest\ndetection, including a sequence of optical spectra ranging from $t = 55$ to\n$909$ d. We also supplement our late time spectra and the photometric\nmeasurements in the literature with an additional epoch of new, late time\n$BVRI$ photometry. Combining available photometric and spectroscopic data, we\nderive a semi-bolometric optical light curve and calculate a total radiated\nenergy in the optical for SN 2010jl of $\\sim 3.5\\times10^{50}$ erg. We also\nexamine the evolution of the H$\\alpha$ emission line profile in detail and find\nevidence for asymmetry in the profile for $t \\gtrsim 775$ d that is not easily\nexplained by any of the proposed scenarios for this fascinating event. Finally,\nwe discuss the interpretations from the literature of the optical and\nnear-infrared light curves, and propose that the most likely explanation of\ntheir evolution is the formation of new dust in the dense, pre-existing CSM\nwind after $\\sim 300$ d.\n", "  Modern avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with high gain are good device candidates\nfor light readout from detectors applied in relativistic heavy ion collisions\nexperiments. The results of the investigations of the APDs properties from\nZecotek, Ketek and Hamamatsu manufacturers after irradiation using secondary\nneutrons from cyclotron facility U120M at NPI of ASCR in \\v{R}e\\v{z} are\npresented. The results of the investigations can be used for the design of the\ndetectors for the experiments at NICA and FAIR.\n", "  In order to investigate the mechanism of ferromagnetic ordering in the new\nn-type magnetic semiconductor (In,Fe)As co-doped with Be, we have performed\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)\nstudies of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic samples. The spectral line shapes\nsuggest that the ferromagnetism is intrinsic originating from Fe atoms\nincorporated into the Zinc-blende-type InAs lattice. The magnetization curves\nof Fe measured by XMCD were well reproduced by the superposition of a Langevin\nfunction representing superparamagnetic (SPM) behavior of nano-scale\nferromagnetic domains and a T-linear function representing Curie-Weiss\nparamagnetism even much above the Curie temperatures. The data at 20 K showed a\ndeviation from the Langevin behavior, suggesting a gradual establishment of\nmacroscopic ferromagnetism on lowering temperature. The existence of nano-scale\nferromagnetic domains indicated by the SPM behavior suggests spatial\nfluctuations of Fe concentration on the nano-scale.\n", "  In this study we explore the LHC's Run II potential to the discovery of heavy\nMajorana neutrinos, with luminosities between $30$ and $3000$ fb$^{-1}$ in the\n$l^{\\pm}l^{\\pm}j~j$ final state. Given that there exist many models for\nneutrino mass generation, even within the Type I seesaw framework, we use a\nsimplified model approach and study two simple extensions to the Standard\nModel, one with a single heavy Majorana neutrino, singlet under the Standard\nModel gauge group, and a limiting case of the left-right symmetric model. We\nthen extend the analysis to a future hadron collider running at $100$ TeV\ncenter of mass energies. This extrapolation in energy allows us to study the\nrelative importance of the resonant production versus gauge boson fusion\nprocesses in the study of Majorana neutrinos at hadron colliders. We analyze\nand propose different search strategies designed to maximize the discovery\npotential in either the resonant production or the gauge boson fusion modes.\n", "  There has been a persistent conundrum in attempts to model the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy elements by rapid neutron capture (the $r$-process).\nAlthough the location of the abundance peaks near nuclear mass numbers 130 and\n195 identify an environment of rapid neutron capture near closed nuclear\nshells, the abundances of elements just above and below those peaks are often\nunderproduced by more than an order of magnitude in model calculations. At the\nsame time there is a debate in the literature as to what degree the $r$-process\nelements are produced in supernovae or the mergers of binary neutron stars. In\nthis paper we propose a novel solution to both problems. We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers. In\nthis paradigm, the abundance peaks themselves are well reproduced by a\nmoderately neutron rich, main $r$-process environment such as that encountered\nin the magnetohydrodynamical jets in supernovae supplemented with a\nhigh-entropy, weakly neutron rich environment such as that encountered in the\nneutrino-driven-wind model to produce the lighter $r$-process isotopes.\nMoreover, we show that the relative contributions to the $r$-process abundances\nin both the solar-system and metal-poor stars from the weak, main, and\nfission-recycling environments required by this proposal are consistent with\nestimates of the relative Galactic event rates of core-collapse supernovae for\nthe weak and main $r$-process and neutron star mergers for the\nfission-recycling $r$-process.\n", "  The neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernova is investigated via\nnon-relativistic, two-dimensional (2D), neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations. For the transport of electron flavor neutrinos, we use the\ninteraction rates defined by Bruenn (1985) and the isotropic diffusion source\napproximation (IDSA) scheme, which decomposes the transported particles into\ntrapped particle and streaming particle components. Heavy neutrinos are\ndescribed by a leakage scheme. Unlike the \"ray-by-ray\" approach in some other\nmulti-dimensional supernova models, we use cylindrical coordinates and solve\nthe trapped particle component in multiple dimensions, improving the\nproto-neutron star resolution and the neutrino transport in angular and\ntemporal directions. We provide an IDSA verification by performing 1D and 2D\nsimulations with 15 and 20 $M_\\odot$ progenitors from Woosley et al.~(2007) and\ndiscuss the difference of our IDSA results with those existing in the\nliterature. Additionally, we perform Newtonian 1D and 2D simulations from\nprebounce core collapse to several hundred milliseconds postbounce with 11, 15,\n21, and 27 $M_\\odot$ progenitors from Woosley et al.~(2002) with the HS(DD2)\nequation of state. General relativistic effects are neglected. We obtain robust\nexplosions with diagnostic energies $E_{\\rm dig} \\gtrsim 0.1- 0.5$~B for all\nconsidered 2D models within approximately $100-300$ milliseconds after bounce\nand find that explosions are mostly dominated by the neutrino-driven\nconvection, although standing accretion shock instabilities are observed as\nwell. We also find that the level of electron deleptonization during collapse\ndramatically affect the postbounce evolution, e.g.~the ignorance of\nneutrino-electron scattering during collapse will lead to a stronger explosion.\n", "  Multifractal properties of wave functions in a disordered system can be\nderived from self-consistent theory of localization by Vollhardt and Woelfle. A\ndiagrammatic interpretation of results allows to obtain all scaling relations\nused in numerical experiments. The arguments are given that the one-loop Wegner\nresult for a space dimension d=2+\\epsilon may appear to be exact, so the\nmultifractal spectrum is strictly parabolical. The \\sigma-models are shown to\nbe deficient at the four-loop level and the possible reasons of that are\ndiscussed. The extremely slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit is\ndemonstrated. The open question on the relation between multifractality and a\nspatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient D(\\omega,q) is resolved in the\ncompromise manner due to ambiguity of the D(\\omega,q) definition. Comparison is\nmade with the extensive numerical material.\n", "  In the \"Higgs basis\" for a generic 2HDM, only one scalar doublet gets a\nnonzero vacuum expectation value and, under the criterion of minimal flavor\nviolation, the other one is fixed to be either color-singlet or color-octet,\nwhich are named as the type-III and type-C models, respectively. In this paper,\nthe charged-Higgs effects of these two models on $B_s^0-\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing are\nstudied. Firstly, we perform a complete one-loop computation of the\nelectro-weak corrections to the amplitudes of $B_s^0-\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing.\nTogether with the up-to-date experimental measurements, a detailed\nphenomenological analysis is then performed in the cases of both real and\ncomplex Yukawa couplings of charged scalars to quarks. The spaces of model\nparameters allowed by the current experimental data on $B_s^0-\\bar{B}_s^0$\nmixing are obtained and the differences between type-III and type-C models are\ninvestigated, which is helpful to distinguish between these two models.\n", "  We study the cross-correlation of distribution of galaxies, the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and X-ray power spectra of galaxies from current and\nupcoming surveys and show these to be excellent probes of the nature, i.e.\nextent, evolution and energetics, of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The\nSZ-galaxy cross-power spectrum, especially at large multipoles, depends on the\nsteepness of the pressure profile of the CGM. This property of the SZ signal\ncan, thus, be used to constrain the pressure profile of the CGM. The X-ray\ncross power spectrum also has a similar shape. However, it is much more\nsensitive to the underlying density profile. We forecast the detectability of\nthe cross-correlated galaxy distribution, SZ and X-ray signals by combining\nSouth Pole Telescope-Dark Energy Survey (SPT-DES) and eROSITA-DES/eROSITA-LSST\n(extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array-Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope) surveys, respectively. We find that, for the SPT-DES survey, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) peaks at high mass and redshift with SNR $\\sim 9$\naround $M_h\\sim 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ and $z\\sim 1.5\\hbox{--} 2$ for flat\ndensity and temperature profiles. The SNR peaks at $\\sim 6 (12 )$ for the\neROSITA-DES (eROSITA-LSST) surveys. We also perform a Fisher matrix analysis to\nfind the constraint on the gas fraction in the CGM in the presence or absence\nof an unknown redshift evolution of the gas fraction. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the cross-correlated SZ-galaxy and X-ray-galaxy power spectrum can be used\nas powerful probes of the CGM energetics and potentially discriminate between\ndifferent feedback models recently proposed in the literature; for example, one\ncan distinguish a `no active galactic nuclei feedback' scenario from a CGM\nenergized by `fixed-velocity hot winds' at greater than $3\\sigma$.\n", "  We study 203 (of 442) Swift AGN and Cluster Survey extended X-ray sources\nlocated in the SDSS DR8 footprint to search for galaxy over-densities in three\ndimensional space using SDSS galaxy photometric redshifts and positions near\nthe Swift cluster candidates. We find 104 Swift clusters with a >3sigma galaxy\nover-density. The remaining targets are potentially located at higher redshifts\nand require deeper optical follow-up observations for confirmation as galaxy\nclusters. We present a series of cluster properties including the redshift, BCG\nmagnitude, BCG-to-X-ray center offset, optical richness, and X-ray luminosity.\nWe also detect red sequences in ~85% of the 104 confirmed clusters. The X-ray\nluminosity and optical richness for the SDSS confirmed Swift clusters are\ncorrelated and follow previously established relations. The distribution of the\nseparations between the X-ray centroids and the most likely BCG is also\nconsistent with expectation. We compare the observed redshift distribution of\nthe sample with a theoretical model, and find that our sample is complete for z\n<~ 0.3 and is still 80% complete up to z ~= 0.4, consistent with the SDSS\nsurvey depth. These analysis results suggest that our Swift cluster selection\nalgorithm has yielded a statistically well-defined cluster sample for further\nstudying cluster evolution and cosmology. We also match our SDSS confirmed\nSwift clusters to existing cluster catalogs, and find 42, 23 and 1 matches in\noptical, X-ray and SZ catalogs, respectively, so the majority of these clusters\nare new detections.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of flavored dark matter (DM). DM stability\nis guaranteed by an accidental ${\\mathcal Z}_3$ symmetry, a subgroup of the\nstandard model (SM) flavor group that is not broken by the SM Yukawa\ninteractions. We consider an explicit realization where the quark part of the\nSM flavor group is fully gauged. If the dominant interactions between DM and\nvisible sector are through flavor gauge bosons, as we show for Dirac fermion\nflavored DM, then the DM mass is bounded between roughly $0.5$ TeV and $5$ TeV\nif the DM multiplet mass is split only radiatively. In general, however, no\nsuch relation exists. We demonstrate this using scalar flavored DM where the\nmain interaction with the SM is through the Higgs portal. For both cases we\nderive constraints from flavor, cosmology, direct and indirect DM detection,\nand collider searches.\n", "  We report computer simulations of the interaction of seeding particles with\nquantized vortices and with the normal fluid flow in thermal counterflow of\nsuperfluid $^4$He. We show that if the particle concentration is too large, the\nvortex tangle is significantly affected, posing problems in the interpretation\nof visualization experiments. The main effects are an increase in vortex line\ndensity and a change in polarization of the vortex tangle, caused by the action\nof the Stokes drag of the viscous normal fluid on the trapped particles. We\nargue that in the case of large particle concentration, typically used for the\nparticle image velocimetry technique, the tangle properties might become\nsignificantly changed. On the contrary, the particle tracking velocimetry\ntechnique that uses smaller particle concentration should not be appreciably\naffected.\n", "  We show that General Relativity coupled to a quantum field theory generically\nleads to non-local effects in the matter sector. These non-local effects can be\ndescribed by non-local higher dimensional operators which remarkably have an\napproximate shift symmetry. When applied to inflationary models, our results\nimply that small non-Gaussianities are a generic feature of models based on\nGeneral Relativity coupled to matter fields. However, these effects are too\nsmall to be observable in the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n", "  The past decade has seen the rise of various radio astronomy arrays,\nparticularly for low-frequency observations below 100MHz. These developments\nhave been primarily driven by interesting and fundamental scientific questions,\nsuch as studying the dark ages and epoch of re-ionization, by detecting the\nhighly red-shifted 21cm line emission. However, Earth-based radio astronomy\nbelow frequencies of 30MHz is severely restricted due to man-made interference,\nionospheric distortion and almost complete non-transparency of the ionosphere\nbelow 10MHz. Therefore, this narrow spectral band remains possibly the last\nunexplored frequency range in radio astronomy. A straightforward solution to\nstudy the universe at these frequencies is to deploy a space-based antenna\narray far away from Earths' ionosphere. Various studies in the past were\nprincipally limited by technology and computing resources, however current\nprocessing and communication trends indicate otherwise. We briefly present the\nachievable science cases, and discuss the system design for selected scenarios,\nsuch as extra-galactic surveys. An extensive discussion is presented on various\nsub-systems of the potential satellite array, such as radio astronomical\nantenna design, the on-board signal processing, communication architectures and\njoint space-time estimation of the satellite network. In light of a scalable\narray and to avert single point of failure, we propose both centralized and\ndistributed solutions for the ULW space-based array. We highlight the benefits\nof various deployment locations and summarize the technological challenges for\nfuture space-based radio arrays.\n", "  Stars with a different vertical motion relative to the galactic disk have a\ndifferent average acceleration. According to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)\ntheories they should therefore have a different average orbital velocity while\nrevolving around the Milky Way. We show that this property can be used to\nconstrain MOND theories by studying stars in the local neighborhood. With the\n{\\sc Hipparcos} dataset we can only place marginal constraints. However, the\nforthcoming {\\sc GAIA} catalogue with its significantly fainter cutoff should\nallow placing a stringent constraint.\n", "  We numerically construct asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in\nfour dimensions that contain only a single Killing vector field. These\nsolutions, which we coin black resonators, link the superradiant instability of\nKerr-AdS to the nonlinear weakly turbulent instability of AdS by connecting the\nonset of the superradiance instability to smooth, horizonless geometries called\ngeons. Furthermore, they demonstrate non-uniqueness of Kerr-AdS by sharing\nasymptotic charges. Where black resonators coexist with Kerr-AdS, we find that\nthe black resonators have higher entropy. Nevertheless, we show that black\nresonators are unstable and comment on the implications for the endpoint of the\nsuperradiant instability.\n", "  We study a class of four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories\nobtained from the six-dimensional (1,0) theory, on M5-branes on C^2/Z_k\norbifold singularity, compactified on a Riemann surface. This produces various\nquiver gauge theories whose matter contents are chiral. We classify the\nbuilding blocks associated to pairs-of-pants, and study the gauging of them as\nthe gluing of punctures. The Riemann surface picture makes the duality\ninvariance of the resulting quiver theories manifest: the theories associated\nto the same Riemann surface flow to the same nontrivial infrared fixed point.\nWe explicitly check this from the 't Hooft anomalies of the global symmetries\nand central charges.\n", "  We study the quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems,\nespecially the infinite dimensional bosonic systems in Fock space. We show that\ngiven the energy constraints, the relative entropy of coherence serves as a\nwell-defined quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems. Via\nusing the relative entropy of coherence, we also generalize the problem to\nmulti-mode Fock space and special examples are considered. It is shown that\nwith a finite average particle number, increasing the number of modes of light\ncan enhance the relative entropy of coherence. With the mean energy constraint,\nour results can also be extended to other infinite-dimensional systems.\n", "  Floquet topological insulators are systems in which the topology emerges out\nof equilibrium when a time periodic perturbation is applied. In these systems\none can define quasi-energy states which replace the quilibrium stationary\nstates. The system exhibits its non-trivial topology by developing edge\nlocalized quasi-energy states which lie in a gap of the quasi energy spectrum.\nThese states represent a non-equilibrium analogue of the topologically\nprotected edge-states in equilibrium topological insulators. In equilibrium\nthese edge-states lead to very specific transport properties, in particular the\ntwo-terminal conductivity of these systems is $2e^2/h$. Here we explore the\ntransport properties of the edge-states in a Floquet topological insulator. In\nstark contrast to the equilibrium result, we find that the two terminal\nconductivity of these edge states is significantly different from $2e^2/h$.\nThis fact notwithstanding, we find that for certain external potential\nstrengths the conductivity is smaller than $2e^2/h$ and robust to the effects\nof disorder and smooth changes to the Hamiltonian's parameters. This robustness\nis reminiscent of the robustness found in equilibrium topological insulators.\nWe provide an intuitive understanding of the reduction of the conductivity in\nterms of scattering by photons. This leads us to consider a previously proposed\nFloquet sum rule which recovers the equilibrium value of $2e^2/h$ for the\nconductivity when edge states are present. We show that this sum rule holds in\nour system using both numerical and analytic techniques.\n", "  Nanocrystalline materials are defined by their fine grain size, but details\nof the grain boundary character distribution should also be important. Grain\nboundary character distributions are reported for ball milled, sputter\ndeposited, and electrodeposited Ni and Ni-based alloys, all with average grain\nsizes of ~20 nm, to study the influence of processing route. The two deposited\nmaterials had nearly identical grain boundary character distributions, both\nmarked by a {\\Sigma}3 length percentage of 23-25%. In contrast, the ball milled\nmaterial had only 3% {\\Sigma}3-type grain boundaries and a large fraction of\nlow angle boundaries (16%), with the remainder being predominantly random high\nangle (73%). These grain boundary character measurements are connected to the\nphysical events that control their respective processing routes. Consequences\nfor material properties are also discussed with a focus on nanocrystalline\ncorrosion. As a whole, the results presented here show that grain boundary\ncharacter distribution, which has often been overlooked in nanocrystalline\nmetals, can vary significantly and influence material properties in profound\nways.\n", "  We present a simulation of the long-term evolution of a Population III\nsupernova remnant in a cosmological minihalo. Employing passive Lagrangian\ntracer particles, we investigate how chemical stratification and anisotropy in\nthe explosion can affect the abundances of the first low-mass, metal-enriched\nstars. We find that reverse shock heating can leave the inner mass shells at\nentropies too high to cool, leading to carbon-enhancement in the re-collapsing\ngas. This hydrodynamic selection effect could explain the observed incidence of\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars at low metallicity. We further explore\nhow anisotropic ejecta distributions, recently seen in direct numerical\nsimulations of core-collapse explosions, may translate to abundances in\nmetal-poor stars. We find that some of the observed scatter in the Population\nII abundance ratios can be explained by an incomplete mixing of supernova\nejecta, even in the case of only one contributing enrichment event. We\ndemonstrate that the customary hypothesis of fully-mixed ejecta clearly fails\nif post-explosion hydrodynamics prefers the recycling of some nucleosynthetic\nproducts over others. Furthermore, to fully exploit the stellar-archaeological\nprogram of constraining the Pop III initial mass function from the observed Pop\nII abundances, considering these hydrodynamical transport effects is crucial.\nWe discuss applications to the rich chemical structure of ultra-faint dwarf\nsatellite galaxies, to be probed in unprecedented detail with upcoming\nspectroscopic surveys.\n", "  We use advanced statistical tools of time-series analysis to characterize the\ndynamical complexity of the transition to optical wave turbulence in a fibre\nlaser. Ordinal analysis and the horizontal visibility graph applied to the\nexperimentally measured laser output intensity reveal the presence of temporal\ncorrelations during the transition from the laminar to the turbulent lasing\nregimes. Both methods unveil coherent structures with well defined time-scales\nand strong correlations both, in the timing of the laser pulses and in their\npeak intensities. Our approach is generic and may be used in other complex\nsystems that undergo similar transitions involving the generation of extreme\nfluctuations.\n", "  We study the viability of regions of large $\\tan \\beta$ within the framework\nof Fat Higgs/$\\lambda$-SUSY Models. We compute the one-loop effective potential\nto find the corrections to the Higgs boson mass due to the heavy non-standard\nHiggs bosons. As the tree level contribution to the Higgs boson mass is\nsuppressed at large $\\tan \\beta$, these one-loop corrections are crucial to\nraising the Higgs boson mass to the measured LHC value. By raising the Higgsino\nand singlino mass parameters, typical electroweak precision constraints can\nalso be avoided. We illustrate these new regions of Fat Higgs/$\\lambda$-SUSY\nparameter space by finding regions of large $\\tan \\beta$ that are consistent\nwith all experimental constraints including direct dark matter detection\nexperiments, relic density limits and the invisible decay width of the $Z$\nboson. We find that there exist regions around $\\lambda = 1.25, \\tan \\beta =\n50$ and a uniform psuedo-scalar $4~{\\rm TeV} \\lsim M_A \\lsim 8$~TeV which are\nconsistent will all present phenomenological constraints. In this region the\ndark matter relic abundance and direct detection limits are satisfied by a\nlightest neutralino that is mostly bino or singlino. As an interesting aside we\nalso find a region of low $\\tan \\beta$ and small singlino mass parameter where\na well-tempered neutralino avoids all cosmological and direct detection\nconstraints.\n", "  The random quantum Ashkin-Teller chain is studied numerically by means of\ntime-dependent Density-Matrix Renormalization Group. The critical lines are\nestimated as the location of the peaks of the integrated autocorrelation times,\ncomputed from spin-spin and polarization-polarization autocorrelation\nfunctions. Disorder fluctuations of magnetization and polarization are observed\nto be maximum on these critical lines. Entanglement entropy leads to the same\nphase diagram, though with larger Finite-Size effects. The decay of spin-spin\nand polarization-polarization autocorrelation functions provides numerical\nevidence of the existence of a double Griffiths phase when taking into account\nfinite-size effects. The two associated dynamical exponents z increase rapidly\nas the critical lines are approached, in agreement with the recent conjecture\nof a divergence at the two transitions in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We discuss consequences of assuming ($i$) that the (Majorana) neutrino mass\nmatrix $M_\\nu$ displays flavour antisymmetry, $S_\\nu^T M_\\nu S_\\nu=-M_\\nu$ with\nrespect to some discrete symmetry $S_\\nu$ contained in $SU(3)$ and ($ii$)\n$S_\\nu$ together with a symmetry $T_l$ of the Hermitian combination\n$M_lM_l^\\dagger$ of the charged lepton mass matrix forms a finite discrete\nsubgroup $G_f$ of $SU(3)$ whose breaking generates these symmetries. Assumption\n($i$) leads to at least one massless neutrino and allows only four textures for\nthe neutrino mass matrix in a basis with a diagonal $S_\\nu$ if it is assumed\nthat the other two neutrinos are massive. Two of these textures contain a\ndegenerate pair of neutrinos.Assumption ($ii$) can be used to determine the\nneutrino mixing patterns. We work out these patterns for two major group series\n$\\Delta(3 N^2)$ and $\\Delta(6 N^2)$ as $G_f$. It is found that all $\\Delta(6\nN^2)$ and $\\Delta(3 N^2)$ groups with even $N$ contain some elements which can\nprovide appropriate $S_\\nu$. Mixing patterns can be determined analytically for\nthese groups and it is found that only one of the four allowed neutrino mass\ntextures is consistent with the observed values of the mixing angles\n$\\theta_{13}$ and $\\theta_{23}$. This texture corresponds to one massless and a\ndegenerate pair of neutrinos which can provide the solar pair in the presence\nof some perturbations. The well-known groups $A_4$ and $S_4$ provide examples\nof the groups in respective series allowing correct $\\theta_{13}$ and\n$\\theta_{23}$. An explicit example based on $A_4$ and displaying a massless and\ntwo quasi degenerate neutrinos is discussed.\n", "  Semiconvection - mixing that occurs in regions that are stable when\nconsidering compositional gradients, but unstable when ignoring them - is shown\nto have the greatest potential impact on main sequence stars with masses in the\nrange 1.2 - 1.7 solar masses. We present the first stellar evolution\ncalculations using a prescription for semiconvection derived from extrapolation\nof direct numerical simulations of double-diffusive mixing down to stellar\nparameters. The dominant mode of semiconvection in stars is layered\nsemiconvection, where the layer height is an adjustable parameter analogous to\nthe mixing length in convection. The rate of mixing across the semiconvective\nregion is sensitively dependent on the layer height. We find that there is a\ncritical layer height that separates weak semiconvective mixing (where\nevolution is well-approximated by using the Ledoux criterion) from strong\nsemiconvective mixing (where evolution is well-approximated by using the\nSchwarzschild criterion). This critical layer height is much smaller than the\nminimum layer height expected from simulations so we predict that for realistic\nlayer heights, the evolution is nearly the same as a model ran with the\nSchwarzschild criterion. We also investigate the effects of compositional\ngradient smoothing, finding that it causes convective cores to artificially\nshrink in the absence of additional mixing beyond the convective boundary.\nLayered semiconvection with realistic layer heights provides enough such mixing\nthat stars will still evolve as if the Schwarzschild criterion is employed.\nFinally, we discuss the potential of detecting such semiconvection and its\nimplication on convective core sizes in solar-like oscillators.\n", "  The black hole information problem has motivated many proposals for new\nphysics. One idea, known as state-dependence, is that quantum mechanics must be\ngeneralized to describe the physics of black holes, and that fixed linear\noperators do not provide the fundamental description of experiences for\ninfalling observers. Instead, such experiences are to be described by operators\nwith an extra dependence on the global quantum state. We show that any\nimplementation of this idea strong enough to remove firewalls from generic\nstates requires massive violations of the Born rule. We also demonstrate a\nsense in which such violations are visible to infalling observers involved in\npreparing the initial state of the black hole. We emphasize the generality of\nour results; no details of any specific proposal for state-dependence are\nrequired.\n", "  We present an analysis of deep HST/WFC3 near-IR (NIR) imaging data of the\nglobular cluster M4. The best-photometry NIR colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nclearly shows the main sequence extending towards the expected end of the\nHydrogen-burning limit and going beyond this point towards fainter sources. The\nwhite dwarf sequence can be identified. As such, this is the deepest NIR CMD of\na globular cluster to date. Archival HST optical data were used for\nproper-motion cleaning of the CMD and for distinguishing the white dwarfs (WDs)\nfrom brown dwarf (BD) candidates. Detection limits in the NIR are around F110W\napprox 26.5 mag and F160W approx27 mag, and in the optical around F775W approx\n28 mag. Comparing our observed CMDs with theoretical models, we conclude that\nwe have reached beyond the H-burning limit in our NIR CMD and are probably just\nabove or around this limit in our optical-NIR CMDs. Thus, any faint NIR sources\nthat have no optical counterpart are potential BD candidates, since the optical\ndata are not deep enough to detect them. We visually inspected the positions of\nNIR sources which are fainter than the H-burning limit in F110W and for which\nthe optical photometry did not return a counterpart. We found in total five\nsources for which we did not get an optical measurement. For four of these five\nsources, a faint optical counterpart could be visually identified, and an upper\noptical magnitude was estimated. Based on these upper optical magnitude limits,\nwe conclude that one source is likely a WD, one source could either be a WD or\nBD candidate, and the remaining two sources agree with being BD candidates. For\nonly one source no optical counterpart could be detected, which makes this\nsource a good BD candidate. We conclude that we found in total four good BD\ncandidates.\n", "  The basic observational properties of \"coronal partings\" -- the special type\nof quasi-one-dimensional magnetic structures, identified by a comparison of the\ncoronal X-ray and EUV images with solar magnetograms -- are investigated. They\nrepresent the channels of opposite polarity inside the unipolar large-scale\nmagnetic fields, formed by the rows of magnetic arcs directed to the\nneighboring sources of the background polarity. The most important\ncharacteristics of the partings are discussed. It can be naturally assumed that\n-- from the evolutionary and spatial points of view -- the partings can\ntransform into the coronal holes and visa versa. The classes of global,\nintersecting, and complex partings are identified.\n", "  Quantum cellular automata (QCA) constitute space and time homogeneous\ndiscrete models for quantum field theories (QFTs). Although QFTs are defined\nwithout reference to particles, computations are done in terms of Feynman\ndiagrams, which are explicitly interpreted in terms of interacting particles.\nSimilarly, the easiest QCA to construct are quantum lattice gas automata\n(QLGA). A natural question then is, which QCA are not QLGA? Here we construct a\nnon-trivial example of such a QCA; it provides a simple model in $1+1$\ndimensions with no particle interpretation at the scale where the QCA dynamics\nare homogeneous.\n", "  With reaching to extremely high intensities of heavy-ion beams new\nrequirements for the detection system of the Dubna Gas-Filled Recoil Separator\n(DGFRS) will definitely be set. One of the challenges is how to apply the\nactive correlations method to suppress beam associated background products\nwithout significant losses in the whole long-term experiment efficiency value.\nDifferent scenarios and equations to develop the method according this\nrequirement are under consideration in the present paper. The execution time to\nestimate the dead time parameter associated with the optimal choice of the\nlife-time parameter is presented.\n", "  State-selected total cross sections and thermal rate coefficients are\ncomputed for the HD + $ortho$-/$para$-H$_2$ rotational energy transfer\ncollision at low temperatures: 2 K $\\lesssim$ T $\\lesssim$ 300 K. A modified\nH$_2$-H$_2$ potential energy surface (PES) devised by Hinde is used for this\npure quantum-mechanical dynamical computation. A comparison of the new results\nfor the HD + $ortho$-/$para$-H$_2$ scattering problem and previous calculations\ncomputed with the use of other older PESs is presented and discussed.\n", "  A monomer-dimer model with a short-range attractive interaction favoring\ncolinear dimers is considered on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Although our\nchoice of the chemical potentials results in more horizontal than vertical\ndimers, the horizontal dimers have no long-range traslational order - in\nagreement with the Heilmann-Lieb conjecture.\n", "  Social networking websites allow users to create and share content. Big\ninformation cascades of post resharing can form as users of these sites reshare\nothers' posts with their friends and followers. One of the central challenges\nin understanding such cascading behaviors is in forecasting information\noutbreaks, where a single post becomes widely popular by being reshared by many\nusers. In this paper, we focus on predicting the final number of reshares of a\ngiven post. We build on the theory of self-exciting point processes to develop\na statistical model that allows us to make accurate predictions. Our model\nrequires no training or expensive feature engineering. It results in a simple\nand efficiently computable formula that allows us to answer questions, in\nreal-time, such as: Given a post's resharing history so far, what is our\ncurrent estimate of its final number of reshares? Is the post resharing cascade\npast the initial stage of explosive growth? And, which posts will be the most\nreshared in the future? We validate our model using one month of complete\nTwitter data and demonstrate a strong improvement in predictive accuracy over\nexisting approaches. Our model gives only 15% relative error in predicting\nfinal size of an average information cascade after observing it for just one\nhour.\n", "  Topological insulators are candidates to open up a novel route in spin based\nelectronics. Different to traditional ferromagnetic materials, where the\ncarrier spin-polarization and magnetization are based on the exchange\ninteraction, the spin properties in topological insulators are based on the\ncoupling of spin- and orbit interaction connected to its momentum. Specific\nways to control the spin-polarization with light have been demonstrated: the\nenergy momentum landscape of the Dirac cone provides spin-momentum locking of\nthe charge current and its spin. The directionality of spin and momentum, as\nwell as control with light has been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate a\ncoherent femtosecond control of spin-polarization for states in the valence\nband at around the Dirac cone.\n", "  Two neutrino double beta decay of $^{76}$Ge to excited states of $^{76}$Se\nhas been studied using data from Phase I of the GERDA experiment. An array\ncomposed of up to 14 germanium detectors including detectors that have been\nisotopically enriched in $^{76}$Ge was deployed in liquid argon. The analysis\nof various possible transitions to excited final states is based on coincidence\nevents between pairs of detectors where a de-excitation $\\gamma$ ray is\ndetected in one detector and the two electrons in the other.\n  No signal has been observed and an event counting profile likelihood analysis\nhas been used to determine Frequentist 90\\,\\% C.L. bounds for three\ntransitions: ${0^+_{\\rm g.s.}-2^+_1}$: $T^{2\\nu}_{1/2}>$1.6$\\cdot10^{23}$ yr,\n${0^+_{\\rm g.s.}-0^+_1}$: $T^{2\\nu}_{1/2}>$3.7$\\cdot10^{23}$ yr and ${0^+_{\\rm\ng.s.}-2^+_2}$: $T^{2\\nu}_{1/2}>$2.3$\\cdot10^{23}$ yr. These bounds are more\nthan two orders of magnitude larger than those reported previously. Bayesian\n90\\,\\% credibility bounds were extracted and used to exclude several models for\nthe ${0^+_{\\rm g.s.}-0^+_1}$ transition.\n", "  We study an extension of the Standard Model featuring a hidden sector that\nconsists of a new scalar charged under a new SU$(N)_D$ gauge group, singlet\nunder all Standard Model gauge interactions, and coupled with the Standard\nModel only via a Higgs portal. We assume that the theory is classically\nconformal, with electroweak symmetry breaking dynamically induced via the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism operating in the hidden sector. Due to the symmetry\nbreaking pattern, the SU$(N)_D$ gauge group is completely Higgsed and the\nresulting massive vectors of the hidden sector constitute a stable dark matter\ncandidate. We perform a thorough scan over the parameter space of the model at\ndifferent values of $N=2$, $3$, and $4$, and investigate the phenomenological\nconstraints. We find that $N=2,3$ provide the most appealing model setting in\nlight of present data from colliders and dark matter direct search experiments.\nWe expect a heavy Higgs to be discovered at LHC by the end of Run II or the\n$N=3$ model to be ruled out.\n", "  The formula for the temperature dependence of the effective mass of a $^{4}%\n$He atom in the superfluid and normal phases is obtained.\\,\\,This expression\nfor the effective mass allows one to eliminate infra-red divergences, being\napplicable at all temperatures, except for a narrow fluctuation region\n0.97~$\\lesssim T/T_{\\rm c}\\leq1$.\\,\\,In the high and low temperature limits, as\nwell as in the interactionless limit, the obtained expression reproduces the\nwell known results.\\,\\,The temperature dependence of the heat capacity and the\nphase transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}\\approx$~2.18~K are calculated, by using\nthe formula obtained for the effective mass.\\,\\,In the framework of the\napproach proposed in this work, the small critical index $\\eta$ is determined\nin the random phase approximation.\\,\\,The obtained value corresponds to the\nwell known result.\n", "  A consistent interpretation of the Higgs data requires the same precision in\nthe Higgs boson masses and in the trilinear Higgs self-couplings, which are\nrelated through their common origin from the Higgs potential. In this work we\nprovide the two-loop corrections at order ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_t \\alpha_s)$ in the\napproximation of vanishing external momenta to the trilinear Higgs\nself-couplings in the CP-violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of\nthe Standard Model (NMSSM). In the top/stop sector two different\nrenormalization schemes have been implemented, the OS and the\n$\\overline{\\text{DR}}$ scheme. The two-loop corrections to the self-couplings\nare of the order of 10\\% in the investigated scenarios. The theoretical error,\nestimated both from the variation of the renormalization scale and from the\nchange of the top/stop sector renormalization scheme, has been shown to be\nreduced due to the inclusion of the two-loop corrections.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of time-dependent transport in a ballistic\ngraphene field effect transistor. We develop a model based on Floquet theory\ndescribing Dirac electron transmission through a harmonically driven potential\nbarrier. Photon-assisted tunneling results in excitation of quasibound states\nat the barrier. Under resonance condition, the excitation of the quasibound\nstates leads to promotion of higher-order sidebands and enhanced higher\nharmonics of the source-drain conductance. The resonances in the main\ntransmission channel are of the Fano form, while they are of the Breit-Wigner\nform for sidebands. We discuss the possibility of utilizing the resonances in\nprospective ballistic high-frequency devices, in particular frequency\nmultipliers.\n", "  Models of large-field inflation based on axion-like fields with shift\nsymmetries can be simple and natural, and make a promising prediction of\ndetectable primordial gravitational waves. The Weak Gravity Conjecture is known\nto constrain the simplest case in which a single compact axion descends from a\ngauge field in an extra dimension. We argue that the Weak Gravity Conjecture\nalso constrains a variety of theories of multiple compact axions including\nN-flation and some alignment models. We show that other alignment models entail\nsurprising consequences for how the mass spectrum of the theory varies across\nthe axion moduli space, and hence can be excluded if further conjectures hold.\nIn every case that we consider, plausible assumptions lead to field ranges that\ncannot be parametrically larger than the Planck scale. Our results are strongly\nsuggestive of a general inconsistency in models of large-field inflation based\non compact axions, and possibly of a more general principle forbidding\nsuper-Planckian field ranges.\n", "  About 30-50% of the baryons in the local Universe are unaccounted for and are\nlikely in a hot phase, 10^5.5-10^8 K. A hot halo (10^6.3 K) is detected around\nthe Milky Way through the O VII and O VIII resonance absorption and emission\nlines in the soft X-ray band. Current instruments are not sensitive enough to\ndetect this gas in absorption around other galaxies and galaxy groups, the two\nmost likely sites. We show that resonant line absorption by this hot gas can be\ndetected with current technology, with a collecting area exceeding about 300\ncm^2 and a resolution R > 2000. For a few notional X-ray telescope\nconfigurations that could be constructed as Explorer or Probe missions, we\ncalculate the differential number of O VII and O VIII absorbers as a function\nof equivalent width through redshift space, dN/dz. The hot halos of individual\nexternal galaxies produce absorption that should be detectable out to about\ntheir virial radii. For the Milky Way, one can determine the radial\ndistribution of density, temperature, and metallicity, after making optical\ndepth corrections. Spectroscopic observations can determine the rotation of a\nhot gaseous halo.\n", "  On the basis of the expression for the density matrix of interacting Bose\nparticles in the coordinate representation with regard for the direct three-\nand four-particle correlations [I.O.\\,\\,Vakarchuk and O.I.\\,\\,Hryhorchak,\nJ.\\,\\,Phys.\\,\\,Stud.\\,\\,\\textbf{3}, 3005 (2009)], the two-, three-, and\nfour-particle structure factors of liquid $^{4}$He in a wide temperature\ninterval were calculated in the approximation \"one sum over the wave\nvector\".\\,\\,In the low-temperature limit, the expression obtained for the\ntwo-particle structure factor transforms into the well-known one.\\,\\,In the\nhigh-temperature limit, the expressions for the two-, three-, and four-particle\nstructure factors are reduced to those for the ideal Bose gas.\\,\\,The results\nobtained can be applied to calculations of the thermodynamic functions of\nliquid $^{4}$He and to the determination of the temperature dependence of the\nfirst-sound velocity in a many-boson system.\n", "  We study a sample of ~10^4 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.8\nwith masses M_200 > 5x10^13 h_70^-1 M_sun, discovered in the second\nRed-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2). The depth and excellent image quality of\nthe RCS2 enable us to detect the cluster-mass cross-correlation up to z~0.7. To\nobtain cluster masses, concentrations and halo biases, we fit a cluster halo\nmodel simultaneously to the lensing signal and to the projected density profile\nof red-sequence cluster members, as the latter provides tight constraints on\nthe cluster miscentring distribution. We parametrise the mass-richness relation\nas M_200 = A x (N_200/20)^alpha, and find A = (15.0 +- 0.8) x 10^13 h_70^-1\nM_sun and alpha = 0.73 +- 0.07 at low redshift (0.2<z<0.35). At intermediate\nredshift (0.35<z<0.55), we find a higher normalisation, which points at a\nfractional increase of the richness towards lower redshift caused by the\nbuild-up of the red-sequence. The miscentring distribution is well constrained.\nOnly ~30% of our BCGs coincide with the peak of the dark matter distribution.\nThe distribution of the remaining BCGs are modelled with a 2D-Gaussian, whose\nwidth increases from 0.2 to 0.4 h_70^-1 Mpc towards higher masses; the ratio of\nwidth and r_200 is constant with mass and has an average value of 0.44 +- 0.01.\nThe mass-concentration and mass-bias relation agree fairly well with literature\nresults at low redshift, but have a higher normalisation at higher redshifts,\nwhich may be due to selection and projection effects. The concentration of the\nsatellite distribution decreases with mass and is correlated with the\nconcentration of the halo.\n", "  We study the many-body electronic state created by a time-dependent drive of\na mesoscopic contact. The many-body state is expressed manifestly in terms of\nsingle-electron and electron-hole quasiparticle excitations with the amplitudes\nand probabilities of creation which depend on the details of the applied\nvoltage. We experimentally probe the time dependence of the constituent\nelectronic states by using an analog of the optical Hong-Ou-Mandel correlation\nexperiment where electrons emitted from the terminals with a relative time\ndelay collide at the contact. The electron wave packet overlap is directly\nrelated to the current noise power in the contact. We have confirmed the time\ndependence of the electronic states predicted theoretically by measurements of\nthe current noise power in a tunnel junction under harmonic excitation.\n", "  We present the derivation of the NNLO two-parton final state contributions to\ntop pair production in the quark-antiquark channel proportionnal to the leading\ncolour factor $N_c^2$. Together with the three and four-parton NNLO\ncontributions presented in a previous publication, this enables us to complete\nthe phenomenologically most important NNLO corrections to top pair\nhadro-production in this channel. We derive this two-parton contribution using\nthe massive extension of the NNLO antenna subtraction formalism and implement\nthose corrections in a parton-level event generator providing full kinematical\ninformation on all final state particles. In addition, we also derive the heavy\nquark contributions proportional to $N_h$. Combining the new leading-colour and\nheavy quark contributions together with the light quark contributions derived\npreviously, we present NNLO differential distributions for LHC and Tevatron. We\nalso compute the differential top quark forward-backward asymmetry at Tevatron\nand find that our results are in good agreement with the measurements by the D0\ncollaboration.\n", "  The number of monomers, in a monomer-dimer mean-field model with an\nattractive potential, fluctuates according to the central limit theorem when\nthe parameters are outside the critical curve. At the critical point the model\nbelongs to the same universality class of the mean-field ferromagnet. Along the\ncritical curve the monomer and dimer phases coexist.\n", "  The first step when investigating time varying data is the detection of any\nreliable changes in star brightness. This step is crucial to decreasing the\nprocessing time by reducing the number of sources processed in later, slower\nsteps. Variability indices and their combinations have been used to identify\nvariability patterns and to select non-stochastic variations, but the\nseparation of true variables is hindered because of wavelength-correlated\nsystematics of instrumental and atmospheric origin, or due to possible data\nreduction anomalies. The main aim is to review the current inventory of\ncorrelation variability indices and measure the efficiency for selecting\nnon-stochastic variations in photometric data. The WFCAM Science Archive (WSA)\nwere used to test the different indices. We improve the panchromatic\nvariability indices and introduce a new set of variability indices for\npreselecting variable star candidates. Using the WFCAMCAL Variable Star\nCatalogue (WVSC1) we delimit the efficiency of each variability index. Moreover\nwe test new insights about these indices to improve the efficiency of detection\nof time-series data dominated by correlated variations. We propose five new\nvariability indices which display a high efficiency for the detection of\nvariable stars. We determine the best way to select variable stars using these\nand the current tool inventory. In addition, we propose an universal analytical\nexpression to select likely variables using the fraction-of-fluctuations on\nthese indices (f_fluc). The f_fluc can be used as an universal way to analyse\nphotometric data since it displays a only weak dependency with the instrument\nproperties. The variability indices computed in this new approach allow us to\nreduce misclassification and these will be implemented in an automatic\nclassifier which will be addressed in a forthcoming paper in this series.\n", "  In this letter we study the effect of time-reversal symmetric impurities on\nthe Josephson supercurrent through two dimensional helical metals such as on\ntopological insulator surface state. We show that contrary to the usual\nsuperconducting-normal metal-superconducting junctions, the suppression of\nsupercurrent in superconducting-helical metal-superconducting junction is\nmainly due to fluctuations of impurities in the junctions. Our results, which\nis a condensed matter realization of a part of the MSW effect for neutrinos,\nshows that the relationship between normal state conductance and critical\ncurrent of Josephson junctions is significantly modified for Josephson\njunctions on the surface of topological insulators. We also study the\ntemperature-dependence of supercurrent and present a two fluid model which can\nexplain some of recent experimental results in Josephson junctions on the edge\nof topological insulators.\n", "  Assuming a Euclid-like weak lensing data set, we compare different methods of\ndealing with its inherent parameter degeneracies. Including priors into a data\nanalysis can mask the information content of a given data set alone. However,\nsince the information content of a data set is usually estimated with the\nFisher matrix, priors are added in order to enforce an approximately Gaussian\nlikelihood. Here, we compare priorless forecasts to more conventional forecasts\nthat use priors. We find strongly non-Gaussian likelihoods for 2d-weak lensing\nif no priors are used, which we approximate with the DALI-expansion. Without\npriors, the Fisher matrix of the 2d-weak lensing likelihood includes unphysical\nvalues of $\\Omega_m$ and $h$, since it does not capture the shape of the\nlikelihood well. The Cramer-Rao inequality then does not need to apply. We find\nthat DALI and Monte Carlo Markov Chains predict the presence of a dark energy\nwith high significance, whereas a Fisher forecast of the same data set also\nallows decelerated expansion. We also find that a 2d-weak lensing analysis\nprovides a sharp lower limit on the Hubble constant of $h > 0.4$, even if the\nequation of state of dark energy is jointly constrained by the data. This is\nnot predicted by the Fisher matrix and usually masked in other works by a sharp\nprior on $h$. Additionally, we find that DALI estimates Figures of Merit in the\npresence of non-Gaussianities better than the Fisher matrix. We additionally\ndemonstrate how DALI allows switching to a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of\na highly curved likelihood with acceptance rates of $\\approx 0.5$, an effective\ncovering of the parameter space, and numerically effectively costless leapfrog\nsteps. This shows how quick forecasts can be upgraded to accurate forecasts\nwhenever needed. Results were gained with the public code from\nhttp://lnasellentin.github.io/DALI/\n", "  We present a self-consistent formalism for computing and understanding the\natmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist.\nStarting from the first law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that the van't\nHoff equation (which describes the equilibrium constant), Arrhenius equation\n(which describes the rate coefficients) and procedures associated with the\nGibbs free energy (minimisation, rescaling) have a common physical and\nmathematical origin. We address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium\nconstant, which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate coefficients,\nand restate its two definitions. By necessity, one of the equilibrium constants\nmust be dimensionless and equate to an exponential function involving the Gibbs\nfree energy, while the other is a ratio of rate coefficients and must therefore\npossess physical units. We demonstrate that the Arrhenius equation takes on a\nfunctional form that is more general than previously stated without recourse to\ntagging on ad hoc functional forms. Finally, we derive analytical models of\nchemical systems, in equilibrium, with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. We include\nacetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends, versus temperature and\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio, published in the literature. The rich variety of\nbehavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio\nis merely the outcome of stoichiometric book-keeping and not the direct\nconsequence of temperature or pressure variations.\n", "  We extend the recently constructed NS superstring field theories in the small\nHilbert space to give classical field equations for all superstring theories,\nincluding Ramond sectors. We also comment on the realization of supersymmetry\nin this framework.\n", "  In light of the forthcoming high precision quasielastic electron scattering\ndata from Jefferson Lab, it is timely for the various approaches to nuclear\nstructure to make robust predictions for the associated response functions.\nWith this in mind, we focus here on the longitudinal response function and the\ncorresponding Coulomb sum rule for isospin-symmetric nuclear matter at various\nbaryon densities. Using a quantum field-theoretic quark-level approach which\npreserves the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics, as well as exhibiting\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement, we find a dramatic\nquenching of the Coulomb sum rule for momentum transfers\n$\\left|\\mathbf{q}\\right| \\gtrsim 0.5\\,$GeV. The main driver of this effect lies\nin changes to the proton Dirac form factor induced by the nuclear medium. Such\na dramatic quenching of the Coulomb sum rule was not seen in a recent quantum\nMonte Carlo calculation for carbon, suggesting that the Jefferson Lab data may\nwell shed new light on the explicit role of QCD in nuclei.\n", "  We demonstrate a stable, mobile, dipolar or nondipolar three-dimensional\nmatter-wave soliton in the vortex core of a uniform nondipolar condensate. All\nintra- and inter-species contact interactions can be repulsive for a strongly\ndipolar soliton. For a weakly dipolar or nondipolar soliton, the intra-species\ncontact interaction in the soliton should be attractive for the formation of a\ncompact soliton. The soliton can propagate with a constant velocity along the\nvortex core without any deformation. Two such solitons undergo a quasi-elastic\ncollision at medium velocities. We illustrate the findings using realistic\ninteractions in a mean-field model of binary $^{87}$Rb-$^{85}$Rb and\n$^{87}$Rb-$^{164}$Dy systems.\n", "  This work is concerned with the theory of Graphical Representation for the\nIsing and Potts Models over general lattices with non-translation invariant\nexternal field. We explicitly describe in terms of the Random Cluster\nRepresentation the distribution function and, consequently, the expected value\nof a single spin for the Ising and $q$-states Potts Models with general\nexternal fields. We also consider the Gibbs States for the Edwards-Sokal\nRepresentation of the Potts Model with non-translation invariant magnetic field\nand prove a version of the FKG Inequality for the so called General Random\nCluster Model (GRC Model) with free and wired boundary conditions in the\nnon-translation invariant case.\n  Adding the amenability hypothesis on the lattice, we obtain the uniqueness of\nthe infinite connected component and the quasilocality of the Gibbs Measures\nfor the GRC Model with such general magnetic fields. As a final application of\nthe theory developed, we show the uniqueness of the Gibbs Measures for the\nFerromagnetic Ising Model with a positive power law decay magnetic field, as\nconjectured in [8].\n", "  Using straightforward linear algebra we derive response operators describing\nthe impact of small perturbations to finite state Markov processes. The results\ncan be used for studying empirically constructed - e.g. from observations or\nthrough coarse graining of model simulations - finite state approximation of\nstatistical mechanical systems. Recent results concerning the convergence of\nthe statistical properties of finite state Markov approximation of the full\nasymptotic dynamics on the SRB measure in the limit of finer and finer\npartitions of the phase space are suggestive of some degree of robustness of\nthe obtained results in the case of Axiom A system. Our findings give closed\nformulas for the linear and nonlinear response theory at all orders of\nperturbation and provide matrix expressions that can be directly implemented in\nany coding language, plus providing bounds on the radius of convergence of the\nperturbative theory. In particular, we relate the convergence of the response\ntheory to the rate of mixing of the unperturbed system. One can use the\nformulas obtained for finite state Markov processes to recover previous\nfindings obtained on the response of continuous time Axiom A dynamical systems\nto perturbations, by considering the generator of time evolution for the\nmeasure and for the observables. A very basic, low-tech, and computationally\ncheap analysis of the response of the Lorenz '63 model to perturbations\nprovides rather encouraging results regarding the possibility of using the\napproximate representation given by finite state Markov processes to compute\nthe system's response.\n", "  The target-space interpretation of the exact (in $\\alpha'$) reflection\ncoefficient for scattering from Euclidean black-hole horizons in classical\nstring theory is studied. For concreteness, we focus on the solvable $SL(2,\n\\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole. It is shown that it exhibits a fascinating\nUV/IR mixing, dramatically modifying the late-time behavior of general\nrelativity. We speculate that this might play an important role in the\nblack-hole information puzzle, as well as in clarifying features related with\nthe non-locality of Little String Theory.\n", "  We compute the hadronic production of top-antitop pairs in association with a\nHiggs boson at next-to-leading-order QCD, including the decay of the top and\nantitop quark into bottom quarks and leptons. Our computation is based on full\nleading and next-to-leading-order matrix elements for $e^+ \\nu_e\n\\mu^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu b \\bar{b} H(j)$ and includes all non-resonant contributions,\noff-shell effects and interferences. Numerical results for the integrated cross\nsection and several differential distributions are given for the LHC operating\nat 13 TeV using a fixed and a dynamical factorization and renormalization\nscale. The use of the dynamical instead of the fixed scale improves the\nperturbative stability in high-energy tails of most distributions, while the\nintegrated cross section is hardly affected differing by only about one per\ncent and leading to the same K factor of 1.17.\n", "  COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed\nQSOs aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological\nparameters, in particular H0. Given long and well sampled light curves of\nstrongly lensed QSOs, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques\nwhose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future\nmonitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing\ncompetition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in 2014. The aim of\nthe present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1,\nis double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement\ntechniques currently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and\nquality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To\nachieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection\nof the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement\nalgorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We show that\nour techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty\nestimates resulting in reduced chi2 values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide\nestimates for the number and precision of time-delay measurements that can be\nexpected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the\nphotometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the true time delay. We make our blind\nmeasurements on the TDC1 data publicly available\n", "  We study the shape dependence of entanglement entropy (EE) by deforming\nsymmetric entangling surfaces. We show that entangling surfaces with a\nrotational or translational symmetry extremize (locally) the EE with respect to\nshape deformations that break some of the symmetry (i.e. the 1st order\ncorrection vanishes). This result applies to EE and Renyi entropy for any QFT\nin any dimension. Using Solodukhin's formula in $4d$ and holography in any $d$,\nwe calculate the 2nd order correction to the universal EE for CFTs and simple\nsymmetric entangling surfaces. In all cases we find that the 2nd order\ncorrection is positive, and thus the corresponding symmetric entangling surface\nis a local minimum. Some of the results are extended to free massive fields and\nto 4d Renyi entropy.\n", "  Soft theorems for the form factors of 1/2-BPS and Konishi operator\nsupermultiplets are derived at tree level in N=4 SYM theory. They have a form\nidentical to the one in the amplitude case. For MHV sectors of stress tensor\nand Konishi supermultiplets loop corrections to soft theorems are considered at\none loop level. They also appear to have universal form in soft limit. Possible\ngeneralization of the on-shell diagrams to the form factors based on leading\nsoft behavior is suggested. Finally, we give some comments on inverse soft\nlimit and integrability of form factors in the limit $q^2\\to 0$\n", "  We report the measurement of cumulants ($C_n, n=1\\ldots4$) of the net-charge\ndistributions measured within pseudorapidity ($|\\eta|<0.35$) in Au$+$Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=7.7-200$ GeV with the PHENIX experiment at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The ratios of cumulants (e.g. $C_1/C_2$,\n$C_3/C_1$) of the net-charge distributions, which can be related to volume\nindependent susceptibility ratios, are studied as a function of centrality and\nenergy. These quantities are important to understand the quantum-chromodynamics\nphase diagram and possible existence of a critical end point. The measured\nvalues are very well described by expectation from negative binomial\ndistributions. We do not observe any nonmonotonic behavior in the ratios of the\ncumulants as a function of collision energy. The measured values of $C_1/C_2 =\n\\mu/\\sigma^2$ and $C_3/C_1 = S\\sigma^3/\\mu$ can be directly compared to lattice\nquantum-chromodynamics calculations and thus allow extraction of both the\nchemical freeze-out temperature and the baryon chemical potential at each\ncenter-of-mass energy.\n", "  I present a technical report indicating that the two methods used for\ncalculating characteristic functions for the work distribution in weakly driven\nquantum master equations are equivalent. One involves applying the notion of\nquantum jump trajectory [Phys. Rev. E 89, 042122 (2014)], while the other is\nbased on two energy measurements on the combined system and reservoir [Silaev,\net al., Phys. Rev. E 90, 022103 (2014)]. These represent backward and forward\nmethods, respectively, which adopt a very similar approach to that of the\nKolmogorov backward and forward equations used in classical stochastic theory.\nThe microscopic basis for the former method is also clarified. In addition, a\npreviously unnoticed equality related to the heat is also revealed.\n", "  We study the prompt production of the $\\chi_c(1^+)$ and $\\chi_b(1^+)$ mesons\nat high energies. Unlike $\\chi(0^+,2^+)$ production, $\\chi (1^+)$ mesons cannot\nbe created at LO via the fusion of two on-mass-shell gluons, that is\n$gg\\to\\chi_{c,b}(1^+)$ are not allowed. However, the available experimental\ndata show that the cross sections for $\\chi_c(1^+)$ and $\\chi_c(2^+)$ are\ncomparable. We therefore investigate four other $\\chi(1^+)$ production\nmechanisms: namely, (i) the standard NLO process $gg\\to\\chi_{c,b}(1^+)+g$, (ii)\nvia gluon virtuality, (iii) via gluon reggeization and, finally, (iv) the\npossibility to form $\\chi_{c,b}(1^+)$ by the fusion of three gluons, where one\nextra gluon comes from another parton cascade, as in the Double Parton\nScattering processes.\n", "  We give here a list of exact classical solutions of a large class of weakly\nnonlocal theories of gravity, which are unitary and super-renormalizable (or\nfinite) at quantum level. It is explicitly shown that flat and Ricci-flat\nspacetimes as well as maximally symmetric manifolds are exact solutions of the\nequation of motion. Therefore, well-known physical spacetimes like\nSchwarzschild, Kerr, (Anti-) de Sitter serve as solutions for standard matter\ncontent. In dimension higher than four we can also have Anti-de Sitter\nsolutions in the presence of positive cosmological constant. We pedagogically\nshow how to obtain these exact solutions. Furthermore, for another version of\nthe theory, written in the Weyl basis, Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nspacetimes are also exact solutions, when the matter content is given by\nconformal matter (radiation). We also comment on the presence of singularities\nand possible resolution of them in finite and conformally invariant theories.\n\"Delocalization\" is proposed as a way to solve the black hole singularity\nproblem. In order to solve the problem of cosmological singularities it seems\ncrucial to have a conformally invariant or asymptotically free quantum\ngravitational theory.\n", "  We report the discovery of a microlensing exoplanet OGLE-2012-BLG-0563Lb with\nthe planet-star mass ratio ~1 x 10^{-3}. Intensive photometric observations of\na high-magnification microlensing event allow us to detect a clear signal of\nthe planet. Although no parallax signal is detected in the light curve, we\ninstead succeed at detecting the flux from the host star in high-resolution\nJHK'-band images obtained by the Subaru/AO188 and IRCS instruments, allowing us\nto constrain the absolute physical parameters of the planetary system. With the\nhelp of a spectroscopic information about the source star obtained during the\nhigh-magnification state by Bensby et al., we find that the lens system is\nlocated at 1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8} kpc from us, and consists of an M dwarf\n(0.34^{+0.12}_{-0.20} M_sun) orbited by a Saturn-mass planet\n(0.39^{+0.14}_{-0.23} M_Jup) at the projected separation of\n0.74^{+0.26}_{-0.42} AU (close model) or 4.3^{+1.5}_{-2.5} AU (wide model). The\nprobability of contamination in the host star's flux, which would reduce the\nmasses by a factor of up to three, is estimated to be 17%. This possibility can\nbe tested by future high-resolution imaging. We also estimate the (J-Ks) and\n(H-Ks) colors of the host star, which are marginally consistent with a low\nmetallicity mid-to-early M dwarf, although further observations are required\nfor the metallicity to be conclusive. This is the fifth sub-Jupiter-mass\n(0.2<m_p/M_Jup<1) microlensing planet around an M dwarf with the mass well\nconstrained. The relatively rich harvest of sub-Jupiters around M dwarfs is\ncontrasted with a possible paucity of ~1--2 Jupiter-mass planets around the\nsame type of star, which can be explained by the planetary formation process in\nthe core-accretion scheme.\n", "  Minimal Flavour Violation in its strong or weak versions, based on $U(3)^3$\nand $U(2)^3$ respectively, allows suitable extensions of the Standard Model at\nthe TeV scale to comply with current flavour constraints in the quark sector.\nHere we discuss considerations analogous to MFV in the context of\n$SU(5)$-unification, showing the new effects/constraints that arise both in the\nquark as in the lepton sector, where quantitative statements can be made\ncontrolled by the CKM matrix elements. The case of supersymmetry is examined in\ndetail as a particularly motivated example. Third generation sleptons and\nneutralinos in the few hundred GeV range are shown to be compatible with\ncurrent constraints.\n", "  We consider a CFT defined on a static metric that is the product of time with\na smooth closed space of positive scalar curvature. We expect the theory to\nexhibit an energy gap and our aim is to investigate how that gap depends on the\ngeometry of the space. For a free conformal scalar it is straightforward to\nshow the gap normalised by the minimum value of the Ricci scalar of the space\nis minimised when the space is a sphere. Our main result is then to show using\ngeometric arguments that precisely the same result holds for fluctuations of a\nscalar operator in any holographic CFT. We prove this under the assumption that\nthe dual vacuum geometry is a smooth Einstein metric ending only on the\nconformal boundary, and then consider fluctuations of a minimally coupled\nmassive scalar field about this. We also argue the holographic CFT will have\nstates dual to small bulk black holes whose existence is related to the energy\ngap. We show the thermodynamic properties of these black holes obey a bound of\na similar nature to that of the scalar fluctuations - the ratio of CFT energy\nto a power of entropy for the states dual to black holes in the 'small' limit\nis bounded from below when appropriately normalised by the minimum Ricci scalar\nof the boundary space. Again the bound is saturated for a sphere.\n", "  Results are presented for the first measurement of the double-polarization\nhelicity asymmetry E for the $\\eta$ photoproduction reaction $\\gamma p\n\\rightarrow \\eta p$. Data were obtained using the FROzen Spin Target (FROST)\nwith the CLAS spectrometer in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, covering a range of\ncenter-of-mass energy W from threshold to 2.15 GeV and a large range in\ncenter-of-mass polar angle. As an initial application of these data, the\nresults have been incorporated into the J\\\"ulich model to examine the case for\nthe existence of a narrow $N^*$ resonance between 1.66 and 1.70 GeV. The\naddition of these data to the world database results in marked changes in the\npredictions for the E observable using that model. Further comparison with\nseveral theoretical approaches indicates these data will significantly enhance\nour understanding of nucleon resonances.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional effective action obtained by reducing\neleven-dimensional supergravity with higher-derivative terms on a background\nsolution including a warp-factor, an eight-dimensional compact manifold, and\nfluxes. The dynamical fields are K\\\"ahler deformations and vectors from the\nM-theory three-form. We show that the potential is only induced by fluxes and\nthe naive contributions obtained from higher-curvature terms on a Calabi-Yau\nbackground vanish once the back-reaction to the full solution is taken into\naccount. For the resulting three-dimensional action we analyse the K\\\"ahler\npotential and complex coordinates and show compatibility with N=2\nsupersymmetry. We argue that the higher-order result is also compatible with a\nno-scale condition. We find that the complex coordinates should be formulated\nas divisor integrals for which a non-trivial interplay between the warp-factor\nterms and the higher-curvature terms allow a derivation of the moduli space\nmetric. This leads us to discuss higher-derivative corrections to the M5-brane\naction.\n", "  We compute the leading double-soft behavior for gluons and for the scalars\nobtained by dimensional reduction of a higher dimensional pure gauge theory,\nfrom the scattering amplitudes of gluons and scalars living in the world-volume\nof a Dp-brane of the bosonic string. In the case of gluons, we compute both the\ndouble-soft behavior when the two soft gluons are contiguous as well as when\nthey are not contiguous. From our results, that are valid in string theory, one\ncan easily get the double-soft limit in gauge field theory by sending the\nstring tension to infinity.\n", "  The polarization direction of an electromagnetic field changes and eventually\nreaches a steady state when propagating through a birefringent material with\noff axis absorption or gain. The steady state orientation direction depends on\nthe magnitude of the absorption (gain) and the phase retardation rate. The\nchange in the polarization direction is experimentally demonstrated in weakly\ndoped ($0.05\\%$) Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals, where the light polarization,\nif initially aligned along the most strongly absorbing principal axis,\ngradually switch to a much less absorbing polarization state during the\npropagation. This means that the absorption coefficient, $\\alpha$, in\nbirefringent materials generally varies with length. This is important for,\ne.g., laser crystal gain media, highly absorbing and narrow band spectral\nfilters and quantum memories.\n", "  The Hyperboloidal Foliation Method (introduced by the authors in 2014) is\nextended here and applied to the Einstein equations of general relativity.\nSpecifically, we establish the nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime for\nself-gravitating massive scalar fields, while existing methods only apply to\nmassless scalar fields. First of all, by analyzing the structure of the\nEinstein equations in wave coordinates, we exhibit a nonlinear\nwave-Klein-Gordon model defined on a curved background, which is the focus of\nthe present paper. For this model, we prove here the existence of\nglobal-in-time solutions to the Cauchy problem, when the initial data have\nsufficiently small Sobolev norms. A major difficulty comes from the fact that\nthe class of conformal Killing fields of Minkowski space is significantly\nreduced in presence of a massive scalar field, since the scaling vector field\nis not conformal Killing for the Klein-Gordon operator. Our method relies on\nthe foliation (of the interior of the light cone) of Minkowski spacetime by\nhyperboloidal hypersurfaces and uses Lorentz-invariant energy norms. We\nintroduce a frame of vector fields adapted to the hyperboloidal foliation and\nwe establish several key properties: Sobolev and Hardy-type inequalities on\nhyperboloids, as well as sup-norm estimates which correspond to the sharp time\ndecay for the wave and the Klein-Gordon equations. These estimates allow us to\ncontrol interaction terms associated with the curved geometry and the massive\nfield, by distinguishing between two levels of regularity and energy growth and\nby a successive use of our key estimates in order to close a bootstrap\nargument.\n", "  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum is a near-perfect\nblackbody. The standard model of cosmology predicts small spectral distortions\nto this form, but no such distortion of the sky-averaged CMB spectrum has yet\nbeen measured. We calculate the largest expected distortion, which arises from\nthe inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons off hot, free electrons, known as\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We show that the predicted signal\nis roughly one order of magnitude below the current bound from the COBE-FIRAS\nexperiment, but can be detected at enormous significance ($\\gtrsim 1000\\sigma$)\nby the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). Although cosmic variance\nreduces the effective signal-to-noise to $230\\sigma$, this measurement will\nstill yield a sub-percent constraint on the total thermal energy of electrons\nin the observable universe. Furthermore, we show that PIXIE can detect subtle\nrelativistic effects in the sky-averaged tSZ signal at $30\\sigma$, which\ndirectly probe moments of the optical depth-weighted intracluster medium\nelectron temperature distribution. These effects break the degeneracy between\nthe electron density and temperature in the mean tSZ signal, allowing a direct\ninference of the mean baryon density at low redshift. Future spectral\ndistortion probes will thus determine the global thermodynamic properties of\nionized gas in the universe with unprecedented precision. These measurements\nwill impose a fundamental \"integral constraint\" on models of galaxy formation\nand the injection of feedback energy over cosmic time.\n", "  We continue the analysis of building open strings stretched between giant\ngravitons from $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM by going to second order in perturbation\ntheory using the three-loop dilatation generator from the field theory. In the\nprocess we build a Fock-like space of states using Cuntz oscillators which can\nbe used to access the excited open string states. We find a remarkable\ncancellation among the excited states that shows the ground state energy is\nconsistent with a fully relativistic dispersion relation.\n", "  In a setup of type IIB superstring compactification on an orientifold of a\n${\\mathbb T}^6/{\\mathbb Z}_4$ sixfold, the presence of geometric flux\n($\\omega$) and non-geometric fluxes ($Q, R$) is implemented along with the\nstandard NS-NS and RR three-form fluxes ($H, F$). After computing the F/D-term\ncontributions to the ${\\cal N}=1$ four dimensional effective scalar potential,\nwe rearrange the same into `suitable' pieces by using a set of new generalized\nflux orbits. Subsequently, we dimensionally oxidize the various pieces of the\ntotal four dimensional scalar potential to guess their ten-dimensional origin.\n", "  If large extra dimensions exist, the Planck scale may be as low as a TeV and\nmicroscopic black holes may be produced in high-energy particle collisions at\nthis energy scale. We simulate microscopic black hole formation at the Large\nHadron Collider and compare the simulation results with recent experimental\ndata by the Compact Muon Solenoid collaboration. The absence of observed black\nhole events in the experimental data allows us to set lower bounds on the\nPlanck scale and various parameters related to microscopic black hole formation\nfor a number ($3-6$) of extra dimensions. Our analysis sets lower bounds on the\nfundamental Planck scale ranging from 0.6 TeV to 4.8 TeV for black holes fully\ndecaying into Standard Model particles and 0.3 TeV to 2.8 TeV for black holes\nsettling down to a remnant, depending on the minimum allowed black hole mass at\nformation. Formation of black holes with mass less than 5.2 TeV to 6.5 TeV (SM\ndecay) and 2.2 TeV to 3.4 TeV (remnant) is excluded at 95\\% C.L. Our analysis\nshows consistency with and difference from the CMS results.\n", "  We have used public data from the Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS) to\ninvestigate the dwarf galaxy population of the Virgo cluster beyond what has\npreviously been discovered. We initially mask and smooth the data, and then use\nthe object detection algorithm Sextractor to make our initial dwarf galaxy\nselection. All candidates are then visually inspected to remove artefacts and\nduplicates. We derive Sextractor parameters to best select low surface\nbrightness galaxies using g band central surface brightness values of 22.5 to\n26.0 mag sq arc sec and exponential scale lengths of 3.0 - 10.0 arc sec to\nidentify 443 cluster dwarf galaxies - 303 of which are new detections. These\nnew detections have a surface density that decreases with radius from the\ncluster centre. We also apply our selection algorithm to 'background',\nnon-cluster, fields and find zero detections. In combination, this leads us to\nbelieve that we have isolated a cluster dwarf galaxy population. The range of\nobjects we are able to detect is limited because smaller scale sized galaxies\nare confused with the background, while larger galaxies are split into numerous\nsmaller objects by the detection algorithm. Using data from previous surveys\ncombined with our data, we find a faint end slope to the luminosity function of\n-1.35+/-0.03, which does not significantly differ to what has previously been\nfound for the Virgo cluster, but is a little steeper than the slope for field\ngalaxies. There is no evidence for a faint end slope steep enough to correspond\nwith galaxy formation models, unless those models invoke either strong feedback\nprocesses or use warm dark matter.\n", "  We extend our study of the pion scalar radius in two-flavour lattice QCD to\ninclude two additional lattice spacings as well as lighter pion masses,\nenabling us to perform a combined chiral and continuum extrapolation. We find\ndiscretisation artefacts to be small for the radius, and confirm the importance\nof the disconnected diagrams in reproducing the correct chiral behaviour. Our\nfinal result for the scalar radius of the pion at the physical point is\n$\\left\\langle r^2\\right\\rangle^\\pi_{\\rm S}=0.600\\pm0.052$ fm$^2$, corresponding\nto a value of $\\overline{\\ell}_4=4.54\\pm0.30$ for the low-energy constant\n$\\overline{\\ell}_4$ of NLO chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  We present a derivation of a generalized optimally-weighted estimator for the\nweak lensing magnification signal, including a calculation of errors. With this\nestimator, we present a local method for optimally estimating the local effects\nof magnification from weak gravitational lensing, using a comparison of number\ncounts in an arbitrary region of space to the expected unmagnified number\ncounts. We show that when equivalent lens and source samples are used, this\nestimator is simply related to the optimally-weighted correlation function\nestimator used in past work and vice-versa, but this method has the benefits\nthat it can calculate errors with significantly less computational time, that\nit can handle overlapping lens and source samples, and that it can easily be\nextended to mass-mapping. We present a proof-of-principle test of this method\non data from the CFHTLenS, showing that its calculated magnification signals\nagree with predictions from model fits to shear data. Finally, we investigate\nhow magnification data can be used to supplement shear data in determining the\nbest-fit model mass profiles for galaxy dark matter haloes. We find that at\nredshifts greater than z ~ 0.6, the inclusion of magnification can often\nsignificantly improve the constraints on the components of the mass profile\nwhich relate to galaxies' local environments relative to shear alone, and in\nhigh-redshift, low- and medium-mass bins, it can have a higher signal-to-noise\nthan the shear signal.\n", "  Some known constraints on Renormalization Group flow take the form of\ninequalities: in even dimensions they refer to the coefficient $a$ of the Weyl\nanomaly, while in odd dimensions to the sphere free energy $F$. In recent work\narXiv:1409.1937 it was suggested that the $a$- and $F$-theorems may be viewed\nas special cases of a Generalized $F$-Theorem valid in continuous dimension.\nThis conjecture states that, for any RG flow from one conformal fixed point to\nanother, $\\tilde F_{\\rm UV} > \\tilde F_{\\rm IR}$, where $\\tilde F=\\sin (\\pi\nd/2)\\log Z_{S^d}$. Here we provide additional evidence in favor of the\nGeneralized $F$-Theorem. We show that it holds in conformal perturbation\ntheory, i.e. for RG flows produced by weakly relevant operators. We also study\na specific example of the Wilson-Fisher $O(N)$ model and define this CFT on the\nsphere $S^{4-\\epsilon}$, paying careful attention to the beta functions for the\ncoefficients of curvature terms. This allows us to develop the $\\epsilon$\nexpansion of $\\tilde F$ up to order $\\epsilon^5$. Pade extrapolation of this\nseries to $d=3$ gives results that are around $2-3\\%$ below the free field\nvalues for small $N$. We also study RG flows which include an anisotropic\nperturbation breaking the $O(N)$ symmetry; we again find that the results are\nconsistent with $\\tilde F_{\\rm UV} > \\tilde F_{\\rm IR}$.\n", "  We present a new formula for all single trace tree amplitudes in four\ndimensional super Yang-Mills coupled to Einstein supergravity. Like the\nCachazo-He-Yuan formula, our expression is supported on solutions of the\nscattering equations, but with momenta written in terms of spinor helicity\nvariables. Supersymmetry and parity are both manifest. In the pure gravity and\npure Yang-Mills sectors, it reduces to the known twistor-string formulae. We\nshow that the formula behaves correctly under factorization and sketch how\nthese amplitudes may be obtained from a four-dimensional (ambi)twistor string.\n", "  Non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) involved in neutrino propagation\ninside Earth matter could potentially alter atmospheric neutrino fluxes. In\nthis work, we look at the impact of these NSI on the signal at the ICAL\ndetector to be built at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). We show how\nthe sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy of ICAL changes in the presence\nof NSI. The mass hierarchy sensitivity is shown to be rather sensitive to the\nNSI parameters $\\epsilon_{e\\mu}$ and $\\epsilon_{e\\tau}$, while the dependence\non $\\epsilon_{\\mu\\tau}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau}$ is seen to be very mild, once\nthe $\\chi^2$ is marginalised over oscillation and NSI parameters. If the NSI\nare large enough, the event spectrum at ICAL is expected to be altered and this\ncan be used to discover new physics. We calculate the lower limit on NSI\nparameters above which ICAL could discover NSI at a given C.L. from 10 years of\ndata. If NSI were too small, the null signal at ICAL can constrain the NSI\nparameters. We give upper limits on the NSI parameters at any given C.L. that\none is expected to put from 10 years of running of ICAL. Finally, we give C.L.\ncontours in the NSI parameter space that is expected to be still allowed from\n10 years of running of the experiment.\n", "  The galactic center excess of gamma ray photons can be naturally explained by\nlight Majorana fermions in combination with a pseudoscalar mediator. The NMSSM\nprovides exactly these ingredients. We show that for neutralinos with a\nsignificant singlino component the galactic center excess can be linked to\ninvisible decays of the Standard-Model-like Higgs at the LHC. We find\npredictions for invisible Higgs branching ratios in excess of 50 percent,\neasily accessible at the LHC. Constraining the NMSSM through GUT-scale boundary\nconditions only slightly affects this expectation. Our results complement\nearlier NMSSM studies of the galactic center excess, which link it to heavy\nHiggs searches at the LHC.\n", "  We study the partition function ${\\cal N}=1$ 5D $U(N)$ gauge theory with $g$\nadjoint hypermultiplets and show that for massless adjoint hypermultiplets it\nis equal to the partition function of a two dimensional topological field on a\ngenus $g$ Riemann surface. We describe the topological field theory by its\namplitudes associated with cap, propagator and pair of pants. These basic\namplitudes are open topological string amplitudes associated with certain\nCalabi-Yau threefolds in the presence of Lagrangian branes.\n", "  We use the Jansson-Farrar JF12 magnetic field configuration in the context of\npoint source searches by correlating the Telescope Array ultra-high energy\ncosmic ray data and the IceCube-40 neutrino candidates. As expected, we have\nfound no correlations, thus, we devote this paper to the study of the effect of\ndifferent magnetic field hypotheses on the minimum neutrino source flux\nstrength required for a $5\\sigma$ discovery and the derived $90\\%$ CL upper\nlimits. In this study we present a comparison between the JF12 field, that\nincludes a combination of regular and random field components, and the standard\nturbulent magnetic field used in previous correlation analyses. For a wider\nperspective, we also incorporate in our comparison the cases of no magnetic\nfield and the JF12 regular component alone and consider different power law\nindices $\\alpha=2,\\alpha=2.3$ for the neutrino point source flux. Collaterally,\na novel parameterisation of the JF12 random component is introduced. We have\nobserved that the discovery potential for a point source search is sensitive to\nchanges in the magnetic field assumptions, being the difference between the\nmodels mentioned before between 15% and 26%.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence relates Wilson loops in N=4 SYM theory to minimal\narea surfaces in AdS5xS5 space. If the Wilson loop is Euclidean and confined to\na plane (t,x) then the dual surface is Euclidean and lives in Minkowski AdS3.\nIn this paper we study such minimal area surfaces generalizing previous results\nobtained in the Euclidean case. Since the surfaces we consider have the\ntopology of a disk, the holonomy of the flat current vanishes which is\nequivalent to the condition that a certain boundary Schroedinger equation has\nall its solutions anti-periodic. If the potential for that Schroedinger\nequation is found then reconstructing the surface and finding the area become\nsimpler. In particular we write a formula for the Area in terms of the\nSchwarzian derivative of the contour. Finally an infinite parameter family of\nanalytical solutions using Riemann Theta functions is described. In this case,\nboth the area and the shape of the surface are given analytically and used to\ncheck the previous results.\n", "  We present first-principles calculations of the electronic band structure and\nspin-orbit effects in graphene functionalized with methyl molecules in dense\nand dilute limits. The dense limit is represented by a 2$\\times$2 graphene\nsupercell functionalized with one methyl admolecule. The calculated spin-orbit\nsplittings are up to $0.6$ meV. The dilute limit is deduced by investigating a\nlarge, 7$\\times$7, supercell with one methyl admolecule. The electronic band\nstructure of this supercell is fitted to a symmetry-derived effective\nHamiltonian, allowing us to extract specific hopping parameters including\nintrinsic, Rashba, and PIA (pseudospin inversion asymmetry) spin-orbit terms.\nThese proximity-induced spin-orbit parameters have magnitudes of about 1 meV,\ngiant compared to pristine graphene whose intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is\nabout 10 $\\mu$eV. We find that the origin of this giant local enhancement is\nthe $sp^3$ corrugation and the breaking of local pseudospin inversion symmetry,\nas in the case of hydrogen adatoms. Also similar to hydrogen, methyl acts as a\nresonant scatterer, with a narrow resonance peak near the charge neutrality\npoint. We also calculate STM-like images showing the local charge densities at\ndifferent energies around methyl on graphene.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Model,\nsupplied with appropriate symmetry breaking mechanisms, provides an Effective\nLagrangian (BHLS) which encompasses a large number of processes within a\nunified framework; a global fit procedure allows for a simultaneous description\nof the e+ e- annihilation into the 6 final states $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $\\pi^0\n\\gamma$, $\\eta \\gamma$, $\\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$, $K^+ K^-$, $K_l K_s$ and includes\nthe dipion spectrum in the {\\tau} decay and some more light meson decay partial\nwidths. The contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_{th}$ of\nthese annihilation channels over the range of validity of the HLS model (up to\n1.05 GeV) is found much improved compared to its partner derived from\nintegrating the measured spectra directly. However, most spectra for the\nprocess $e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ undergo overall scale uncertainties which\ndominate the other sources, and one may suspect some bias in the dipion\ncontribution to $a_{th}$. However, an iterated fit algorithm, shown to lead to\nunbiased results by a Monte Carlo study, is defined and applied succesfully to\nthe $e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ data samples from CMD2, SND, KLOE, BaBar and\nBESSIII. The iterated fit solution is shown to be further improved and leads to\na value for $a_{\\mu}$ different from $a_{exp}$ above the 4 $\\sigma$ level. The\ncontribution of the $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ intermediate state up to 1.05 GeV to $a_{th}$\nderived from the iterated fit benefits from an uncertainty about 3 times\nsmaller than the corresponding usual estimate. Therefore, global fit techniques\nare shown to work and lead to improved unbiased results.\n", "  We present a framework for the quantum enhanced estimation of multiple\nparameters corresponding to non-commuting unitary generators. Our formalism\nprovides a recipe for the simultaneous estimation of all three components of a\nmagnetic field. We propose a probe state that surpasses the precision of\nestimating the three components individually and discuss measurements that come\nclose to attaining the quantum limit. Our study also reveals that too much\nquantum entanglement may be detrimental to attaining the Heisenberg scaling in\nquantum metrology.\n", "  We argue, at a very basic effective field theory level, that higher dimension\noperators in scalar theories that break symmetries at scales close to their\nultraviolet completion cutoff, include terms that favour the breaking of\ntranslation (Lorentz) invariance, potentially resulting in striped, chequered\nboard or general crystal-like phases. Such descriptions can be thought of as\nthe effective low energy description of QCD-like gauge theories near their\nstrong coupling scale where terms involving higher dimension operators are\ngenerated. Our low energy theory consists of scalar fields describing operators\nsuch as $\\bar{q} q$ and $\\bar{q} F^{(2n)} q$. Such scalars can have kinetic\nmixing terms that generate effective momentum dependent contributions to the\nmass matrix. We show that these can destabilize the translationally invariant\nvacuum. It is possible that in some real gauge theory such operators could\nbecome sufficiently dominant to realize such phases and it would be interesting\nto look for them in lattice simulations. We present a holographic model of the\nsame phenomena which includes RG running. A key phenomenological motive to look\nat such states is recent work that shows that the non-linear response in $R^2$\ngravity to such short range fluctuations can mimic a cosmological constant.\nIntriguingly in a cosmology with such a Starobinsky inflation term, to generate\nthe observed value of the present day acceleration would require stripes at the\nelectroweak scale. Unfortunately, low energy phenomenological constraints on\nLorentz violation in the electron-photon system appear to strongly rule out any\nsuch possibility outside of a disconnected dark sector.\n", "  The unknown nature of dark energy motivates continued cosmological tests of\nlarge-scale gravitational physics. We present a new consistency check based on\nthe relative amplitude of non-relativistic galaxy peculiar motions, measured\nvia redshift-space distortion, and the relativistic deflection of light by\nthose same galaxies traced by galaxy-galaxy lensing. We take advantage of the\nlatest generation of deep, overlapping imaging and spectroscopic datasets,\ncombining the Red Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey (RCSLenS), the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the WiggleZ Dark\nEnergy Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We\nquantify the results using the \"gravitational slip\" statistic E_G, which we\nestimate as 0.48 +/- 0.10 at z=0.32 and 0.30 +/- 0.07 at z=0.57, the latter\nconstituting the highest redshift at which this quantity has been determined.\nThese measurements are consistent with the predictions of General Relativity,\nfor a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in a Universe dominated by a\ncosmological constant, which are E_G = 0.41 and 0.36 at these respective\nredshifts. The combination of redshift-space distortion and gravitational\nlensing data from current and future galaxy surveys will offer increasingly\nstringent tests of fundamental cosmology.\n", "  We use the scalar model with quartic interaction to illustrate how a\nnonperturbative variational technique combined with renormalization group (RG)\nproperties efficiently resums perturbative expansions in thermal field\ntheories. The resulting convergence and scale dependence of optimized\nthermodynamical quantities, here illustrated up to two-loop order, are\ndrastically improved as compared to standard perturbative expansions, as well\nas to other related methods such as the screened perturbation or (resummed)\nhard-thermal-loop perturbation, that miss RG invariance as we explain. Being\nvery general and easy to implement, our method is a potential analytical\nalternative to deal with the phase transitions of field theories such as\nthermal QCD.\n", "  We investigate the implication of the recent discovery of a Higgs-like\nparticle in the first phase of the LHC Run 1 on the Inert Higgs Doublet Model\n(IHDM). The determination of the Higgs couplings to SM particles and its\nintrinsic properties will get improved during the new LHC Run 2 starting this\nyear. The new LHC Run 2 would also shade some light on the triple Higgs\ncoupling. Such measurement is very important in order to establish the details\nof the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Given the importance of the\nHiggs couplings both at the LHC and $e^+e^-$\n  Linear Collider machines, accurate theoretical predictions are required. We\nstudy the radiative corrections to the triple Higgs coupling $hhh$ and to\n$hZZ$, $hWW$ couplings in the context of the IHDM. By combining several\ntheoretical and experimental constraints on parameter space, we show that extra\nparticles might modify the triple Higgs coupling near threshold regions.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of these corrections on the double Higgs\nproduction signal at the $e^+e^-$ LC and show that they can be rather\nimportant.\n", "  Filamentary structures are common in molecular clouds. Explaining how they\nfragment to dense cores is a missing step in understanding their role in star\nformation. We perform a case study of whether low-mass filaments are close-to\nhydrostatic prior to their fragmentation, and whether their fragmentation\nagrees with gravitational fragmentation models. For this, we study the 6.5 pc\nlong Musca molecular cloud that is an ideal candidate for a filament at an\nearly stage of fragmentation. We employ dust extinction mapping in conjunction\nwith near-infrared data from the NEWFIRM instrument, and 870 um dust continuum\nemission data from the LABOCA instrument, to estimate column densities. We use\nthe data to identify fragments from the cloud and to determine the radial\ndensity distribution of its filamentary part. We compare the cloud's morphology\nwith 13CO and C18O line emission observed with the APEX/SHeFI instrument. The\nMusca cloud is pronouncedly fragmented at its ends, but harbours a remarkably\nwell-defined, 1.6 pc long filament in its Center region. The line mass of the\nfilament is 21-31 Ms pc^-1 and FWHM 0.07 pc. Its radial profile can be fitted\nwith a Plummer profile that has the power-index of 2.6 \\pm 11%, flatter than\nthat of an infinite hydrostatic filament. The profile can also be fitted with a\nhydrostatic cylinder truncated by external pressure. These models imply a\ncentral density of 5-10 x 10^4 cm^-3. The fragments in the cloud have a mean\nseparation of 0.4 pc, in agreement with gravitational fragmentation. These\nproperties, together with the subsonic and velocity-coherent nature of the\ncloud, suggest a scenario in which an initially hydrostatic cloud is currently\ngravitationally fragmenting. The fragmentation has started a few tenths of a\nMyr ago from the cloud ends, leaving its center yet relatively non-fragmented,\npossibly because of gravitational focusing in a finite geometry.\n", "  We explore the properties of five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories\nliving on 5-brane webs in orientifold 7-plane backgrounds. These include\n$USp(2N)$ and $SO(N)$ gauge theories with fundamental matter, as well as\n$SU(N)$ gauge theories with symmetric and antisymmetric matter. We find a\nnumber of new 5d fixed point theories that feature enhanced global symmetries.\nWe also exhibit a number of new 5d dualities.\n", "  We present a weak-lensing analysis of the merging {\\em Frontier Fields} (FF)\ncluster Abell~2744 using new Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging. The wide-field lensing\nmass distribution reveals this cluster is comprised of four distinct\nsubstructures. Simultaneously modeling the two-dimensional reduced shear field\nusing a combination of a Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) model for the main core\nand truncated NFW models for the subhalos, we determine their masses and\nlocations. The total mass of the system is constrained as $M_\\mathrm{200c} =\n(2.06\\pm0.42)\\times10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$. The most massive clump is the southern\ncomponent with $M_\\mathrm{200c} = (7.7\\pm3.4)\\times10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$, followed\nby the western substructure ($M_\\mathrm{200c} =\n(4.5\\pm2.0)\\times10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$) and two smaller substructures to the\nnortheast ($M_\\mathrm{200c} = (2.8\\pm1.6)\\times10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$) and northwest\n($M_\\mathrm{200c} = (1.9\\pm1.2)\\times10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$). The presence of the\nfour substructures supports the picture of multiple mergers. Using a composite\nof hydrodynamical binary simulations we explain this complicated system without\nthe need for a \"slingshot\" effect to produce the northwest X-ray interloper, as\npreviously proposed. The locations of the substructures appear to be offset\nfrom both the gas ($87^{+34}_{-28}$ arcsec, 90\\% CL) and the galaxies\n($72^{+34}_{-53}$ arcsec, 90\\% CL) in the case of the northwestern and western\nsubhalos. To confirm or refute these findings, high resolution space-based\nobservations extending beyond the current FF limited coverage to the west and\nnorthwestern area are essential.\n", "  We show that compatibility of supersymmetry with exact semi-classics demands\nthat in calculating multi-instanton amplitudes, the \"separation\" quasi-zeromode\nmust be complexified and the integration cycles must be found by using complex\ngradient flow (or Picard-Lefschetz equations.) As a non-trivial application, we\nstudy $\\mathcal N=2$ extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Even though in\nthis case supersymmetry is unbroken, the instanton-anti-instanton amplitude\n(naively calculated) seems to contribute to the ground state energy. We show,\nhowever, that the instanton-anti-instanton event consists of two parts: a\nfermion-correlated and a scalar-correlated event. Although both of these\ncontributions are naively of the same sign and the latter is superficially\nhigher order in the perturbative coupling, we show that the two contributions\nexactly cancel when they are evaluated on Lefschetz thimbles due to their\nrelative Hidden Topological Angles (HTAs). This gives strong evidence that the\nsemi-classical expansion using Lefschetz thimbles is not only a meaningful\nprescription for higher order semi-classics, but a necessary one. This\ndeduction seems to be universal and applicable to both supersymmetric and\nnon-supersymmetric theories. In conclusion we speculate that similar\nconspiracies are responsible for the non-formation of certain molecular\ncontributions in theories where instantons have more than two fermionic\nzeromodes and do not contribute to the superpotential.\n", "  Generalized Kontsevich Matrix Model (GKMM) with a certain given potential is\nthe partition function of $r$-spin intersection numbers. We represent this GKMM\nin terms of fermions and expand it in terms of the Schur polynomials by\nboson-fermion correspondence, and link it with a Hurwitz partition function and\na Hodge partition by operators in a $\\widehat{GL}(\\infty)$ group. Then, from a\n$W_{1+\\infty}$ constraint of the partition function of $r$-spin intersection\nnumbers, we get a $W_{1+\\infty}$ constraint for the Hodge partition function.\nThe $W_{1+\\infty}$ constraint completely determines the Schur polynomials\nexpansion of the Hodge partition function.\n", "  We demonstrate plasmon assisted energy transfer between fluorophores located\nat distances up to $7 \\, \\mu$m on the top of a thin silver film. Thanks to the\nstrong confinement and large propagation length of surface plasmon polaritons,\nthe range of the energy transfer is almost two orders of magnitude larger than\nthe values reported in the literature so far. The parameters driving the energy\ntransfer range are thoroughly characterized and are in very good agreement with\ntheoretically expected values.\n", "  Suppose that a $d$-dimensional domain is filled with a gas of (in general,\ninteracting) diffusive particles with density $n_0$. A particle is absorbed\nwhenever it reaches the domain boundary. Employing macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory, we evaluate the probability ${\\mathcal P}$ that no particles are\nabsorbed during a long time $T$. We argue that the most likely gas density\nprofile, conditional on this event, is stationary throughout most of the time\n$T$. As a result, ${\\mathcal P}$ decays exponentially with $T$ for a whole\nclass of interacting diffusive gases in any dimension. For $d=1$ the stationary\ngas density profile and ${\\mathcal P}$ can be found analytically. In higher\ndimensions we focus on the simple symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and show\nthat $-\\ln {\\mathcal P}\\simeq D_0TL^{d-2} \\,s(n_0)$, where $D_0$ is the gas\ndiffusivity, and $L$ is the linear size of the system. We calculate the\nrescaled action $s(n_0)$ for $d=1$, for rectangular domains in $d=2$, and for\nspherical domains. Near close packing of the SSEP $s(n_0)$ can be found\nanalytically for domains of any shape and in any dimension.\n", "  We revisit the applications of integral geometry in AdS$_3$ and argue that\nthe metric of the kinematic space can be realized as the entanglement contour,\nwhich is defined as the additive entanglement density. From the renormalization\nof the entanglement contour, we can holographically understand the operations\nof disentangler and isometry in multi-scale entanglement renormalization\nansatz. Furthermore, a renormalization group equation of the long-distance\nentanglement contour is then derived. We then generalize this integral\ngeometric construction to higher dimensions and in particular demonstrate how\nit works in bulk space of homogeneity and isotropy.\n", "  Dark matter decays or annihilations that produce line-like spectra may be\nsmoking-gun signals. However, even such distinctive signatures can be mimicked\nby astrophysical or instrumental causes. We show that velocity spectroscopy-the\nmeasurement of energy shifts induced by relative motion of source and\nobserver-can separate these three causes with minimal theoretical\nuncertainties. The principal obstacle has been energy resolution, but upcoming\nexperiments will reach the required 0.1% level. As an example, we show that the\nimminent Astro-H mission can use Milky Way observations to separate possible\ncauses of the 3.5-keV line. We discuss other applications.\n", "  We derive the second-order hydrodynamic equation for reactive multi-component\nsystems from the relativistic Boltzmann equation. In the reactive system,\nparticles can change their species under the restriction of the imposed\nconservation laws during the collision process. Our derivation is based on the\nrenormalization group (RG) method, in which the Boltzmann equation is solved in\nan organized perturbation method as faithfully as possible and possible secular\nterms are resummed away by a suitable setting of the initial value of the\ndistribution function. The microscopic formulae of the relaxation times and the\nlengths are explicitly given as well as those of the transport coefficients for\nthe reactive multi-component system. The resultant hydrodynamic equation with\nthese formulae has nice properties that it satisfies the positivity of the\nentropy production rate and the Onsager's reciprocal theorem, which ensure the\nvalidity of our derivation.\n", "  We evaluate the high temperature limit of the free energy of spin glasses on\nthe hypercube with Hamiltonian $H_N(\\sigma) = \\sigma^T J \\sigma$, where the\ncoupling matrix $J$ is drawn from certain symmetric orthogonally invariant\nensembles. Our derivation relates the annealed free energy of these models to a\nspherical integral, and expresses the limit of the free energy in terms of the\nlimiting spectral measure of the coupling matrix $J$. As an application, we\nderive the limiting free energy of the Random Orthogonal Model (ROM) at high\ntemperatures, which confirms non-rigorous calculations of Marinari et al.\n(1994). Our methods also apply to other well-known models of disordered\nsystems, including the SK and Gaussian Hopfield models.\n", "  We investigate strong-coupling properties of a two-dimensional ultracold\nFermi gas in the normal state. Including pairing fluctuations within the\nframework of a $T$-matrix approximation, we calculate the distribution function\n$n({\\boldsymbol Q})$ of Cooper pairs in terms of the center of mass momentum\n${\\boldsymbol Q}$. In the strong-coupling regime, $n({\\boldsymbol Q}=0)$ is\nshown to exhibit a remarkable increase with decreasing the temperature in the\nlow temperature region, which agrees well with the recent experiment on a\ntwo-dimensional $^6$Li Fermi gas [M. G. Ries, {\\it et. al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 114}, 230401 (2015)]. Our result indicates that the observed remarkable\nincrease of the number of Cooper pairs with zero center of mass momentum can be\nexplained without assuming the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransition, when one properly includes pairing fluctuations that are enhanced\nby the low-dimensionality of the system. Since the BKT transition is a crucial\ntopic in two-dimensional Fermi systems, our results would be useful for the\nstudy toward the realization of this quasi-long-range order in an ultracold\nFermi gas.\n", "  We demonstrate control of the absolute phase of an optical lattice with\nrespect to a single trapped ion. The lattice is generated by off-resonant\nfree-space laser beams, we actively stabilize its phase by measuring its\nac-Stark shift on a trapped ion. The ion is localized within the standing wave\nto better than 2\\% of its period. The locked lattice allows us to apply\ndisplacement operations via resonant optical forces with a controlled direction\nin phase space. Moreover, we observe the lattice-induced phase evolution of\nspin superposition states in order to analyze the relevant decoherence\nmechanisms. Finally, we employ lattice-induced phase shifts for inferring the\nvariation of the ion position over 157~$\\mu$m range along the trap axis at\naccuracies of better than 6~nm.\n", "  Very sensitive 21cm HI measurements have been made at several locations\naround the Local Group galaxy M31 using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at an\nangular resolution of 9.1', with a 5$\\sigma$ detection level of $\\rm{N_{HI} =\n3.9 \\times 10^{17}~cm^{-2}}$ for a 30 $\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ line. Most of the HI in\na 12 square degree area almost equidistant between M31 and M33 is contained in\nnine discrete clouds that have a typical size of a few kpc and HI mass of\n$10^5$ M$_{\\odot}$. Their velocities in the Local Group Standard of Rest lie\nbetween -100 and +40 $\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$, comparable to the systemic velocities of\nM31 and M33. The clouds appear to be isolated kinematically and spatially from\neach other. The total HI mass of all nine clouds is $1.4 \\times 10^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$ for an adopted distance of 800 kpc with perhaps another $0.2 \\times\n10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ in smaller clouds or more diffuse emission. The HI mass of\neach cloud is typically three orders of magnitude less than the dynamical\n(virial) mass needed to bind the cloud gravitationally. Although they have the\nsize and HI mass of dwarf galaxies, the clouds are unlikely to be part of the\nsatellite system of the Local Group as they lack stars. To the north of M31,\nsensitive HI measurements on a coarse grid find emission that may be associated\nwith an extension of the M31 high-velocity cloud population to projected\ndistances of $\\sim 100$ kpc. An extension of the M31 high-velocity cloud\npopulation at a similar distance to the south, toward M33, is not observed.\n", "  Systems of D3-branes at orientifold singularities can receive\nnon-perturbative D-brane instanton corrections, inducing field theory operators\nin the 4d effective theory. In certain non-chiral examples, these systems have\nbeen realized as the infrared endpoint of a Seiberg duality cascade, in which\nthe D-brane instanton effects arise from strong gauge theory dynamics. We\npresent the first UV duality cascade completion of chiral D3-brane theories, in\nwhich the D-brane instantons arise from gauge theory dynamics. Chiral examples\nare interesting because the instanton fermion zero mode sector is topologically\nprotected, and therefore lead to more robust setups. As an application of our\nresults, we provide a UV completion of certain D-brane orientifold systems\nrecently claimed to produce conformal field theories with conformal invariance\nbroken only by D-brane instantons.\n", "  The abundance of galaxy clusters can constrain both the geometry and growth\nof structure in our Universe. However, this probe could be significantly\ncomplicated by recent claims of nonuniversality -- non-trivial dependences with\nrespect to the cosmological model and redshift. In this work we analyse the\ndependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establish\nif this can cause departures from universality. In order to explore this\ndependance, we use a set of different N-body cosmological simulations (Le\nSBARBINE simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the Planck\ncollaboration; this first suite of simulations is followed by a lower\nresolution set, carried out with different cosmological parameters. We identify\ndark matter haloes using a Spherical Overdensity algorithm with varying\noverdensity thresholds (virial, 2000rho_c, 1000rho_c, 500rho_c, 200rho_c and\n200rho_b) at all redshifts. We notice that, when expressed in term of the\nrescaled variable nu, the mass functionfor virial haloes is a nearly universal\nas a function of redshift and cosmology, while this is clearly not the case for\nthe other overdensities we considered. We provide fitting functions for the\nhalo mass function parameters as a function of overdensity, that allow to\npredict, to within a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a wide\nrange of halo definitions, redshifts and cosmological models. We then show how\nthe departures from universality associated with other halo definitions can be\nderived by combining the universality of the virial definition with the\nexpected shape of the density profile of halos.\n", "  The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity is studied in a holographic\nmodel of a non-fermi liquid that is amenable to both analytical and numerical\ncomputation. In the regime that dissipation dominates the DC conductivity, the\nAC conductivity is described well in the IR by a Drude peak despite the absence\nof quasiparticles. In the regime where pair-production-like processes dominate\nthe conductivity there is no Drude peak. A scaling tail is found for the AC\nconductivity that is independent of the charge density and momentum\ndissipation. Evidence is given that this scaling tail $\\sigma_{AC}\\sim\n\\omega^m$ appears generically in quantum critical holographic systems and the\nassociated scaling exponent $m$ is calculated in terms of the Lifshitz and\nconduction critical exponents.\n", "  We develop the conformal bootstrap program for six-dimensional conformal\nfield theories with $(2,0)$ supersymmetry, focusing on the universal four-point\nfunction of stress tensor multiplets. We review the solution of the\nsuperconformal Ward identities and describe the superconformal block\ndecomposition of this correlator. We apply numerical bootstrap techniques to\nderive bounds on OPE coefficients and scaling dimensions from the constraints\nof crossing symmetry and unitarity. We also derive analytic results for the\nlarge spin spectrum using the lightcone expansion of the crossing equation. Our\nprincipal result is strong evidence that the $A_1$ theory realizes the minimal\nallowed central charge $(c=25)$ for any interacting $(2,0)$ theory. This\nimplies that the full stress tensor four-point function of the $A_1$ theory is\nthe unique unitary solution to the crossing symmetry equation at $c=25$. For\nthis theory, we estimate the scaling dimensions of the lightest unprotected\noperators appearing in the stress tensor operator product expansion. We also\nfind rigorous upper bounds for dimensions and OPE coefficients for a general\ninteracting $(2,0)$ theory of central charge $c$. For large $c$, our bounds\nappear to be saturated by the holographic predictions obtained from\neleven-dimensional supergravity.\n", "  We consider a highly anisotropic $d=2$ Ising spin model whose precise\ndefinition can be found at the beginning of Section 2. In this model the spins\non a same horizontal line (layer) interact via a $d=1$ Kac potential while the\nvertical interaction is between nearest neighbors, both interactions being\nferromagnetic. The temperature is set equal to 1 which is the mean field\ncritical value, so that the mean field limit for the Kac potential alone does\nnot have a spontaneous magnetization. We compute the phase diagram of the full\nsystem in the Lebowitz-Penrose limit showing that due to the vertical\ninteraction it has a spontaneous magnetization. The result is not covered by\nthe Lebowitz-Penrose theory because our Kac potential has support on regions of\npositive codimension.\n", "  We probe the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor\nquantum dot (QD) via time- and temperature- dependent two-photon interference\n(TPI) experiments. An increase in temporal-separation between consecutive\nphoton emission events, reveals a decrease in TPI visibility on a nanosecond\ntimescale, theoretically described by a non-Markovian noise process in\nagreement with fluctuating charge-traps in the QD's vicinity. Phonon-induced\npure dephasing results in a decrease in TPI visibility from $(96\\pm4)\\,$\\% at\n10\\,K to a vanishing visibility at 40\\,K. In contrast to Michelson-type\nmeasurements, our experiments provide direct access to the time-dependent\ncoherence of a quantum emitter at a nanosecond timescale.\n", "  We construct the general form of an F-theory compactification with two U(1)\nfactors based on a general elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold with\nMordell-Weil group of rank two. This construction produces broad classes of\nmodels with diverse matter spectra, including many that are not realized in\nearlier F-theory constructions with U(1)xU(1) gauge symmetry. Generic U(1)xU(1)\nmodels can be related to a Higgsed non-Abelian model with gauge group\nSU(2)xSU(2)xSU(3), SU(2)^3xSU(3), or a subgroup thereof. The nonlocal\nhorizontal divisors of the Mordell-Weil group are replaced with local vertical\ndivisors associated with the Cartan generators of non-Abelian gauge groups from\nKodaira singularities. We give a global resolution of codimension two\nsingularities of the Abelian model; we identify the full anomaly free matter\ncontent, and match it to the unHiggsed non-Abelian model. The non-Abelian\nWeierstrass model exhibits a new algebraic description of the singularities in\nthe fibration that results in the first explicit construction of matter in the\nsymmetric representation of SU(3). This matter is realized on double point\nsingularities of the discriminant locus. The construction suggests a\ngeneralization to U(1)^k factors with k>2, which can be studied by Higgsing\ntheories with larger non-Abelian gauge groups.\n", "  Quasars powered by massive black holes (BHs) with mass estimates above a\nbillion solar masses have been identified at redshift 6 and beyond. The\nexistence of such BHs requires almost continuous growth at the Eddington limit\nfor their whole lifetime, of order of one billion years. In this paper, we\nexplore the possibility that positively skewed scale-dependent non-Gaussian\nprimordial fluctuations may ease the assembly of massive BHs. In particular,\nthey produce more low-mass halos at high redshift, thus altering the production\nof metals and ultra-violet flux, believed to be important factors in BH\nformation. Additionally, a higher number of progenitors and of nearly\nequal-mass halo mergers would boost the mass increase provided by BH-BH mergers\nand merger-driven accretion. We use a set of two cosmological simulations, with\neither Gaussian or scale-dependent non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations to\nperform a proof-of-concept experiment to estimate how BH formation and growth\nare altered. We estimate the BH number density and the fraction of halos where\nBHs form, for both simulations and for two popular scenarios of BH formation\n(remnants of the first generation of stars and direct collapse in the absence\nof metals and molecular hydrogen). We find that the fractions of halos where\nBHs form are almost identical, but that non-Gaussian primordial perturbations\nincrease the total number density of BHs for the both BH formation scenarios.\nWe also evolve BHs using merger trees extracted from the simulations and find\nthat non-Gaussianities increase both the BH masses and the number of the most\nmassive BHs.\n", "  We present fully nonlinear dissipative fluid dynamics simulations of a\ntrapped two-dimensional Fermi gas at unitarity using a Lattice Boltzmann\nalgorithm. We are able to simulate non-harmonic trapping potentials,\ntemperature-dependent viscosities as well as a discretized version of the\nballistic (non-interacting) behavior. Our approach lends itself to direct\ncomparison with experimental data, opening up the possibility of a precision\ndetermination of transport coefficients in the unitary Fermi gas. Furthermore,\nwe predict the presence of a non-hydrodynamic component in the quadrupole mode,\nwhich should be observable experimentally.\n", "  We measure the cosmic shear power spectrum on large angular scales by\ncross-correlating the shapes of ~9 million galaxies measured in the optical\nSDSS survey with the shapes of ~2.7x10^5 radio galaxies measured by the\noverlapping VLA-FIRST survey. Our measurements span the multipole range 10 < l\n< 130, corresponding to angular scales 2deg < {\\theta} < 20deg. On these\nscales, the shear maps from both surveys suffer from significant systematic\neffects that prohibit a measurement of the shear power spectrum from either\nsurvey alone. Conversely we demonstrate that a power spectrum measured by\ncross-correlating the two surveys is unbiased.\n  We measure an E-mode power spectrum from the data that is inconsistent with\nzero signal at the 99\\% confidence (~2.7{\\sigma}) level. The odd-parity B-mode\nsignal and the EB cross- correlation are both found to be consistent with zero\n(within 1{\\sigma}). These constraints are obtained after a careful error\nanalysis that accounts for uncertainties due to cosmic variance, random galaxy\nshape noise and shape measurement errors, as well as additional errors\nassociated with the observed large-scale systematic effects in the two surveys.\nOur constraints are consistent with the expected signal in the concordance\ncosmological model assuming recent estimates of the cosmological parameters\nfrom the Planck satellite, and literature values for the median redshifts of\nthe SDSS and FIRST galaxy populations.\n  The cross-power spectrum approach described in this paper represents a\npowerful technique for mitigating shear systematics and will be ideal for\nextracting robust results, with the exquisite control of systematics required,\nfrom future cosmic shear surveys with the SKA, LSST, Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA.\n", "  We propose two new simple lepton flavor models in the framework of the $S_4$\nflavor symmetry. The neutrino mass matrices, which are given by two complex\nparameters, lead to the inverted mass hierarchy. The charged lepton mass matrix\nhas the 1-2 lepton flavor mixing, which gives the non-vanishing reactor angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. These models predict the Dirac phase and the Majorana phases,\nwhich are testable in the future experiments. The predicted magnitudes of the\neffective neutrino mass for the neutrino-less double beta decay are in the\nregions as $32~\\text{meV}\\lesssim |m_{ee}|\\lesssim 49~\\text{meV}$ and\n$34~\\text{meV}\\lesssim |m_{ee}|\\lesssim 59~\\text{meV}$, respectively. These\nvalues are close to the expected reaches of the coming experiments. The total\nsum of the neutrino masses are predicted in both models as\n$0.0952~\\text{eV}\\lesssim \\sum m_i\\lesssim 0.101~\\text{eV}$ and\n$0.150~\\text{eV}\\lesssim \\sum m_i\\lesssim 0.160~\\text{eV}$, respectively.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) crystals, such as graphene and transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs), present a collection of unique and complementary\noptoelectronic properties. Assembling different 2D materials in vertical\nheterostructures enables the combination of these properties in one device,\nthus creating multi-functional optoelectronic systems with superior\nperformance. Here we demonstrate that graphene/WSe2/graphene heterostructures\nally the high photodetection efficiency of TMDs with a picosecond photoresponse\ncomparable to that of graphene, thereby optimizing both speed and efficiency in\na single photodetector. We follow in time the extraction of photoexcited\ncarriers in these devices using time-resolved photocurrent measurements and\ndemonstrate a photoresponse time as short as 5.5 ps, which we tune by applying\na bias and by varying the TMD layer thickness. Our study provides direct\ninsight into the physical processes governing the detection speed and quantum\nefficiency of these van der Waals (vdW) heterostuctures, such as out-of-plane\ncarrier drift and recombination. The observation and understanding of ultrafast\nand efficient photodetection demonstrate the potential of hybrid TMD-based\nheterostructures as a platform for future optoelectronic devices.\n", "  We show that for a class of two-loop diagrams, the on-shell part of the\nintegration-by-parts (IBP) relations correspond to exact meromorphic one-forms\non algebraic curves. Since it is easy to find such exact meromorphic one-forms\nfrom algebraic geometry, this idea provides a new highly efficient algorithm\nfor integral reduction. We demonstrate the power of this method via several\ncomplicated two-loop diagrams with internal massive legs. No explicit elliptic\nor hyperelliptic integral computation is needed for our method.\n", "  We demonstrate that in the large N approach developed by the authors in\ncollaboration with Bardeen, the parameters B_6^{(1/2)} and B_8^{(3/2)}\nparametrizing the K\\to\\pi\\pi matrix elements <Q_6>_0 and <Q_8>_2 of the\ndominant QCD and electroweak operators receive both negative O(1/N) corrections\nsuch that B_6^{(1/2)} < B_8^{(3/2)}<1 in agreement with the recent lattice\nresults of the RBC-UKQCD collaboration. We also point out that the pattern of\nthe size of the hadronic matrix elements of all QCD and electroweak penguin\noperators Q_i contributing to the K\\to \\pi \\pi amplitudes A_0 and A_2, obtained\nby this lattice collaboration, provides further support to our large N\napproach. In particular, a very precise lattice result for the matrix element\n<Q_8>_0 implies for the corresponding parameter B_8^{(1/2)}=1.0\\pm 0.2 to be\ncompared with large N value B_8^{(1/2)}=1.1\\pm 0.1. We discuss briefly the\nimplications of these findings for the ratio epsilon'/epsilon. In fact, with\nthe precise value for B_8^{(3/2)} from RBC-UKQCD collaboration, our upper bound\non B_6^{(1/2)} implies epsilon'/epsilon in the SM roughly by a factor of two\nbelow its experimental value (16.6\\pm 2.3)\\times 10^{-4}. We also briefly\ncomment on the parameter \\hat B_K and the \\Delta I=1/2$ rule.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the ratio epsilon'/epsilon within the Standard\nModel (SM) using a formalism that is manifestly independent of the values of\nleading (V-A)x(V-A) QCD penguin, and EW penguin hadronic matrix elements of the\noperators Q_4, Q_9, and Q_10, and applies to the SM as well as extensions with\nthe same operator structure. It is valid under the assumption that the SM\nexactly describes the data on CP-conserving K -> pi pi amplitudes. As a result\nof this and the high precision now available for CKM and quark mass parameters,\nto high accuracy epsilon'/epsilon depends only on two non-perturbative\nparameters, B_6^(1/2) and B_8^(3/2), and perturbatively calculable Wilson\ncoefficients. Within the SM, we are separately able to determine the hadronic\nmatrix element <Q_4>_0 from CP-conserving data, significantly more precisely\nthan presently possible with lattice QCD. Employing B_6^(1/2) = 0.57+-0.19 and\nB_8^(3/2) = 0.76+-0.05, extracted from recent results by the RBC-UKQCD\ncollaboration, we obtain epsilon'/epsilon = (1.9+-4.5) 10^-4, substantially\nmore precise than the recent RBC-UKQCD prediction and 2.9 sigma below the\nexperimental value (16.6+-2.3) 10^-4, with the error being fully dominated by\nthat on B_6^(1/2). Even discarding lattice input completely, but employing the\nrecently obtained bound B_6^(1/2) <= B_8^(3/2) <= 1 from the large-N approach,\nthe SM value is found more than 2 sigma below the experimental value. At\nB_6^(1/2) = B_8^(3/2) = 1, varying all other parameters within one sigma, we\nfind epsilon'/epsilon = (8.6+-3.2) 10^-4. We present a detailed anatomy of the\nvarious SM uncertainties, including all sub-leading hadronic matrix elements,\nbriefly commenting on the possibility of underestimated SM contributions as\nwell as on the impact of our results on new physics models.\n", "  We investigate strong-coupling corrections to the specific heat $C_V$ in the\nnormal state of an ultracold Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover region. A\nrecent experiment on a $^6$Li unitary Fermi gas [M. J. H. Ku, {\\it et. al.},\nScience {\\bf 335}, 563 (2012)] shows that $C_V$ is remarkably amplified near\nthe superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$, being similar to the\nwell-known $\\lambda$-structure observed in liquid $^4$He. Including pairing\nfluctuations within the framework of the strong-coupling theory developed by\nNozi\\`eres and Schmitt-Rink, we show that strong pairing fluctuations are\nsufficient to explain the anomalous behavior of $C_V$ observed in a $^6$Li\nunitary Fermi gas near $T_{\\rm c}$. We also show that there is no contribution\nfrom {\\it stable} preformed Cooper pairs to $C_V$ at the unitarity. This\nindicates that the origin of the observed anomaly is fundamentally different\nfrom the case of liquid $^{4}$He, where {\\it stable} $^4$He Bose atoms induce\nthe $\\lambda$-structure in $C_V$ near the superfluid instability. Instead, the\norigin is the suppression of the entropy $S$, near $T_{\\rm c}$, due to the\nincrease of {\\it metastable} preformed Cooper pairs. Our results indicate that\nthe specific heat is a useful quantity to study the effects of pairing\nfluctuations on the thermodynamic properties of an ultracold Fermi gas in the\nBCS-BEC crossover region.\n", "  We consider the single-handed spinor field in interaction with its own\ngravitational field described by the set of field equations given by Weyl field\nequations written in terms of derivatives that are covariant with respect to\nthe gravitational connection plus Einstein field equations soured with the\nenergy tensor of the spinor: for the Weyl spinor and the ensuing spacetime of\nWeyl-Lewis-Papapetrou structure, we will find all exact solutions. The obtained\nsolution for the metric tensor is that of a PP-wave spacetime while the spinor\nfield is a flag-dipole.\n", "  We discuss the role of Minkowski 3-forms in flux string vacua. In these vacua\nall internal closed string fluxes are in one to one correspondence with\nquantized Minkowski 4-forms. By performing a dimensional reduction of the\n$D=10$ Type II supergravity actions we find that the 4-forms act as auxiliary\nfields of the Kahler and complex structure moduli in the effective action. We\nshow that all the RR and NS axion dependence of the flux scalar potential\nappears through the said 4-forms. Gauge invariance of these forms then severely\nrestricts the structure of the axion scalar potentials. Combined with duality\nsymmetries it suggests that all perturbative corrections to the leading axion\nscalar potential $V_0$ should appear as an expansion in powers of $V_0$ itself.\nThese facts could have an important effect e.g. on the inflaton models based on\nF-term axion monodromy. We also suggest that the involved multi-branched\nstructure of string vacua provides for a new way to maintain interacting scalar\nmasses stable against perturbative corrections.\n", "  We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton\npairs produced, via $W$ and $Z/\\gamma^*$ decay, in hadronic collisions. At\nsmall values of $q_T$, we resum the logarithmically-enhanced perturbative QCD\ncontributions up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Resummed\nresults are consistently combined with the known ${\\mathcal O}(\\alpha_S^2)$\nfixed-order results at intermediate and large values of $q_T$. Our calculation\nincludes the leptonic decay of the vector boson with the corresponding spin\ncorrelations, the finite-width effects and the full dependence on the\nfinal-state lepton(s) kinematics. The computation is encoded in the numerical\nprogram DYRes, which allows the user to apply arbitrary kinematical cuts on the\nfinal-state leptons and to compute the corresponding distributions in the form\nof bin histograms. We present a comparison of our results with some of the\navailable LHC data. The inclusion of the leptonic decay in the resummed\ncalculation requires a theoretical discussion on the $q_T$ recoil due to the\ntransverse momentum of the produced vector boson. We present a $q_T$ recoil\nprocedure that is directly applicable to $q_T$ resummed calculations for\ngeneric production processes of high-mass systems in hadron collisions.\n", "  Temperature dependent measurements of 57Fe Mossbauer spectra on CaFe2As2\nsingle crystals in the tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal phases are reported.\nClear features in the temperature dependencies of the isomer shift, relative\nspectra area and quadrupole splitting are observed at the transition from the\ntetragonal to the collapsed tetragonal phase. From the temperature dependent\nisomer shift and spectral area data, an average stiffening of the phonon modes\nin the collapsed tetragonal phase is inferred. The quadrupole splitting\nincreases by ~25% on cooling from room temperature to ~100 K in the tetragonal\nphase and is only weakly temperature dependent at low temperatures in the\ncollapsed tetragonal phase, in agreement with the anisotropic thermal expansion\nin this material. In order to gain microscopic insight about these measurements\nwe perform ab initio density functional theory calculations of the electric\nfield gradient and the electron density of CaFe2As2 in both phases. By\ncomparing the experimental data with the calculations we are able to fully\ncharacterize the crystal structure of the samples in the collapsed-tetragonal\nphase through determination of the As z-coordinate. Based on the obtained\ntemperature dependent structural data we are able to propose charge saturation\nof the Fe - As bond region as the mechanism behind the stabilization of the\ncollapsed-tetragonal phase at ambient pressure.\n", "  A black brane solution to a Gauss-Bonnet massive gravity is introduced. In\nthe context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the viscosity to entropy ratio is found\nby the Green-Kubo formula. The result indicates violation of the well-known KSS\nbound as expected in a higher derivative theory. Setting mass zero gives back\nthe known viscosity to entropy ratio dependent on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling,\nwhile without Gauss-Bonnet term, a nonzero mass parameter doesn't contribute to\nthe ratio which saturates the bound of $1/4\\pi$.\n", "  We study the constraints that electroweak precision data can impose, after\nthe discovery of the Higgs boson by the LHC, on neutrinophilic\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models which comprise one extra $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ doublet\nand a new symmetry, namely a spontaneously broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or a softly\nbroken global $U(1)$. In these models the extra Higgs doublet, via its very\nsmall vacuum expectation value, is the sole responsible for neutrino masses. We\nfind that the model with a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is basically ruled out by\nelectroweak precision data, even if the model is slightly extended to include\nextra right-handed neutrinos, due to the presence of a very light scalar. While\nthe other model is still perfectly viable, the parameter space is considerably\nconstrained by current data, specially by the $T$ parameter. In particular, the\nnew charged and neutral scalars must have very similar masses.\n", "  We describe in detail how the spectrum of a single anti-D3-brane in\nfour-dimensional orientifolded IIB string models reproduces precisely the field\ncontent of a nilpotent chiral superfield with the only physical component\ncorresponding to the fermionic goldstino. In particular we explicitly consider\na single anti-D3-brane on top of an O3-plane in warped throats, induced by\n$(2,1)$ fluxes. More general systems including several anti-branes and other\norientifold planes are also discussed. This provides further evidence to the\nclaim that non-linearly realized supersymmetry due to the presence of\nantibranes in string theory can be described by supersymmetric theories\nincluding nilpotent superfields. Implications to the KKLT and related scenarios\nof de Sitter moduli stabilization, to cosmology and to the structure of soft\nSUSY-breaking terms are briefly discussed.\n", "  We theoretically investigate magnetic properties of a unitary Fermi gas in a\nharmonic trap. Including strong pairing fluctuations within the framework of an\nextended $T$-matrix approximation (ETMA), as well as effects of a trap\npotential within the local density approximation (LDA), we calculate the local\nspin susceptibility $\\chi(T,r)$ above the superfluid phase transition\ntemperature $T_{\\rm c}$. We show that the formation of preformed singlet Cooper\npairs anomalously suppresses $\\chi(T,r)$ in the trap center near $T_{\\rm c}$.\nWe also point out that, in the unitarity limit, the spin-gap temperature in a\nuniform Fermi gas can be evaluated from the observation of the spatial\nvariation of $\\chi(T,r)$. Since a real ultracold Fermi gas is always in a trap\npotential, our results would be useful for the study of how this spatial\ninhomogeneity affects thermodynamic properties of an ultracold Fermi gas in the\nBCS-BEC crossover region.\n", "  Differential cross sections of deep inelastic scattering of charged leptons\nfrom hadrons are investigated by using the gauge/string duality. We consider\nvector mesons derived from different holographic dual models obtaining a\ngeneral expression. We focus on the strongly coupled regime of dual gauge\ntheories for different values of the Bjorken parameter. We find new predictions\nwhich are particularly interesting for differential scattering cross sections\nof polarized leptons scattered off polarized vector mesons. We also carry out a\ndetailed comparison of the moments of the structure functions with lattice QCD\nresults.\n", "  We show that the classical S-matrix calculated from the recently proposed\nsuperstring field theories give the correct perturbative S-matrix. In the proof\nwe exploit the fact that the vertices are obtained by a field redefinition in\nthe large Hilbert space. The result extends to include the NS-NS subsector of\ntype II superstring field theory and the recently found equations of motions\nfor the Ramond fields. In addition, our proof implies that the S-matrix\nobtained from Berkovits' WZW-like string field theory then agrees with the\nperturbative S-matrix to all orders.\n", "  The LHCb has discovered two new states with preferred $J^P$ quantum numbers\n$3/2^-$ and $5/2^+$ from $\\Lambda_b$ decays. These new states can be\ninterpreted as hidden charm pentaquarks. It has been argued that the main\nfeatures of these pentaquarks can be described by diquark model. The diquark\nmodel predicts that the $3/2^-$ and $5/2^+$ are in two separate octet\nmultiplets of flavor $SU(3)$ and there is also an additional decuplet\npentaquark multiplet. Finding the states in these multiplets can provide\ncrucial evidence for this model. The weak decays of b-baryon to a light meson\nand a pentaquark can have Cabibbo allowed and suppressed decay channels. We\nfind that in the $SU(3)$ limit, for $U$-spin related decay modes the ratio of\nthe decay rates of Cabibbo suppressed to Cabibbo allowed decay channels is\ngiven by $|V_{cd}|^2/|V_{cs}|^2$. There are also other testable relations for\nb-baryon weak decays into a pentaquark and a light pseudoscalar. These\nrelations can be used as tests for the diquark model for pentaquark.\n", "  In the background of a charged AdS black hole, we consider a Dirac particle\nendowed with an arbitrary magnetic dipole moment. For non-zero charge and\ndipole coupling of the bulk fermion, we find that the dual boundary theory can\nbe plagued with superluminal modes. Requiring consistency of the dual CFT\namounts to constraining the strength of the dipole coupling by an upper bound.\nWe briefly discuss the implications of our results for the physics of\nholographic non-Fermi liquids.\n", "  The occurrence of low-amplitude flux variations in blazars on hourly\ntimescales, commonly known as microvariability, is still a widely debated\nsubject in high-energy astrophysics. Several competing scenarios have been\nproposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasma\ninstabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,\nand turbulence. In this letter we present the results of our detailed\ninvestigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected during\nrecent WEBT campaign in 2014, March 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. After\nseparating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum of\nthe blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with the\npolarization degree $\\sim (40-60)\\%$$\\pm (2-10)\\%$, and the electric vector\nposition angle $\\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned with\nrespect to the position angle of the radio jet. The microflare evolution in the\n$(Q,\\,U)$ Stokes parameter space exhibits a looping behavior with a\ncounter-clockwise rotation, meaning polarization degree decreasing with the\nflux (but higher in the flux decaying phase), and approximately stable\npolarization angle. The overall very high polarization degree of the flare, its\nsymmetric flux rise and decay profiles, and also its structured evolution in\nthe $Q-U$ plane, all imply that the observed flux variation corresponds to a\nsingle emission region characterized by a highly ordered magnetic field. As\ndiscussed in the paper, a small-scale but strong shock propagating within the\noutflow, and compressing a disordered magnetic field component, provides a\nnatural, though not unique, interpretation of our findings.\n", "  The Witten index counts the difference in the number of bosonic and fermionic\nstates of a quantum mechanical system. The Schur index, which can be defined\nfor theories with at least $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry in four dimensions is\na particular refinement of the index, dependent on one parameter $q$ serving as\nthe fugacity for a particular set of charges which commute with the hamiltonian\nand some supersymmetry generators. This index has a known expression for all\nLagrangian and some non-Lagrangian theories as a finite dimensional integral or\na complicated infinite sum. In the case of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with gauge group\n$U(N)$ we rewrite this as the partition function of a gas of $N$ non\ninteracting and translationally invariant fermions on a circle. This allows us\nto perform the integrals and write down explicit expressions for fixed $N$ as\nwell as the exact all orders large $N$ expansion.\n", "  We describe a general scenario, dubbed \"Inflatable Dark Matter\", in which the\ndensity of dark matter particles can be reduced through a short period of\nlate-time inflation in the early universe. The overproduction of dark matter\nthat is predicted within many otherwise well-motivated models of new physics\ncan be elegantly remedied within this context, without the need to tune\nunderlying parameters or to appeal to anthropic considerations. Thermal relics\nthat would otherwise be disfavored can easily be accommodated within this class\nof scenarios, including dark matter candidates that are very heavy or very\nlight. Furthermore, the non-thermal abundance of GUT or Planck scale axions can\nbe brought to acceptable levels, without invoking anthropic tuning of initial\nconditions. A period of late-time inflation could have occurred over a wide\nrange of scales from ~ MeV to the weak scale or above, and could have been\ntriggered by physics within a hidden sector, with small but not necessarily\nnegligible couplings to the Standard Model.\n", "  We prove that curved noncommutative tori, introduced by Dabrowski and Sitarz,\nare Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces and that they form a continuous\nfamily over the group of invertible matrices with entries in the commutant of\nthe quantum tori in the regular representation, when this group is endowed with\na natural length function.\n", "  Brueckner theory is used to investigate the properties of hyperons in nuclear\nmatter. The hyperon-nucleon interaction is taken from chiral effective field\ntheory at next-to-leading order with SU(3) symmetric low-energy constants.\nFurthermore, the underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction is also derived within\nchiral effective field theory. We present the single-particle potentials of\nLambda and Sigma hyperons in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter computed\nwith the continuous choice for intermediate spectra. The results are in good\nagreement with the empirical information. In particular, our calculation gives\na repulsive Sigma-nuclear potential and a weak Lambda-nuclear spin-orbit force.\n", "  We investigate the stability of four-dimensional dyonic soliton and black\nhole solutions of ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in anti-de\nSitter space. We prove that, in a neighbourhood of the embedded trivial\n(Schwarzschild-)anti-de Sitter solution, there exist non-trivial dyonic soliton\nand black hole solutions of the field equations which are stable under linear,\nspherically symmetric, perturbations of the metric and non-Abelian gauge field.\n", "  Till date, the only consistent description of the deconfinement phase of the\nSakai-Sugimoto model appears to be provided by the analysis of [1]\n(arXiv:1107.4048). The current version of the analysis, however, has a subtlety\nregarding the monodromy of quarks around the Euclidean time circle. In this\nnote, we revisit and resolve this issue by considering the effect of an\nimaginary baryon chemical potential on quark monodromies. With this ingredient,\nthe proposal of [1] for investigating finite temperature QCD using holography\nis firmly established. Additionally, our technique allows a holographic\ncomputation of the free energy as a function of the imaginary chemical\npotential in the deconfinement phase; we show that our result agrees with the\ncorresponding formula obtained from perturbative QCD, namely the Roberge-Weiss\npotential.\n", "  By compactifying gauge theories on a lower dimensional manifold, we often\nfind many interesting relationships between a geometry and a supersymmetric\nquantum field theory. In this paper we consider conformal field theories\nobtained from twisted compactification on a Riemann surface with a boundary.\nVarious kinds of supersymmetric boundary conditions are exchanged under\nS-duality. To consider these transformations one need to take into account\nboundary degrees of freedom. So we study how the degrees of freedom can be\nadded at the boundary of the Riemann surface. In this paper I show that this\nintroduction of the boundary fields can be done preserving supersymmetry by\nmeans of 2-dimensional superfields.\n", "  We study Modified Gravity (MG) theories by modelling the redshifted matter\npower spectrum in a spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB) basis. We use a fully\nnon-linear description of the real-space matter power-spectrum and include the\nlowest-order redshift-space correction (Kaiser effect), taking into account\nsome additional non-linear contributions. Ignoring relativistic corrections,\nwhich are not expected to play an important role for a shallow survey, we\nanalyse two different modified gravity scenarios, namely the generalised\nDilaton scalar-tensor theories and the $f({R})$ models in the large curvature\nregime. We compute the 3D power spectrum ${\\cal C}^s_{\\ell}(k_1,k_2)$ for\nvarious such MG theories with and without redshift space distortions, assuming\nprecise knowledge of background cosmological parameters. Using an all-sky\nspectroscopic survey with Gaussian selection function $\\varphi(r)\\propto\n\\exp(-{r^2 / r^2_0})$, $r_0 = 150 \\, h^{-1} \\, {\\textrm{Mpc}}$, and number\ndensity of galaxies $\\bar {\\textrm{N}} =10^{-4}\\;{\\textrm{Mpc}}^{-3}$, we use a\n$\\chi^2$ analysis, and find that the lower-order $(\\ell \\leq 25)$ multipoles of\n${\\cal C}^s_\\ell(k,k')$ (with radial modes restricted to $k < 0.2 \\, h\n\\,{\\textrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$) can constraint the parameter $f_{R_0}$ at a level of\n$2\\times 10^{-5} (3\\times 10^{-5})$ with $3 \\sigma$ confidence for $n=1(2)$.\nCombining constraints from higher $\\ell > 25$ modes can further reduce the\nerror bars and thus in principle make cosmological gravity constraints\ncompetitive with solar system tests. However this will require an accurate\nmodelling of non-linear redshift space distortions. Using a tomographic\n$\\beta(a)$-$m(a)$ parameterization we also derive constraints on specific\nparameters describing the Dilaton models of modified gravity.\n", "  The entanglement entropy of a generic $d$-dimensional conformal field theory\nreceives a regulator independent contribution when the entangling region\ncontains a (hyper)conical singularity of opening angle $\\Omega$, codified in a\nfunction $a^{(d)}(\\Omega)$. In arXiv:1505.04804, we proposed that for\nthree-dimensional conformal field theories, the coefficient $\\sigma$\ncharacterizing the smooth surface limit of such contribution\n($\\Omega\\rightarrow \\pi$) equals the stress tensor two-point function charge\n$C_{ T}$, up to a universal constant. In this paper, we prove this relation for\ngeneral three-dimensional holographic theories, and extend the result to\ngeneral dimensions. In particular, we show that a generalized coefficient\n$\\sigma^{ (d)}$ can be defined for (hyper)conical entangling regions in the\nalmost smooth surface limit, and that this coefficient is universally related\nto $C_{ T}$ for general holographic theories, providing a general formula for\nthe ratio $\\sigma^{ (d)}/C_{ T}$ in arbitrary dimensions. We conjecture that\nthe latter ratio is universal for general CFTs. Further, based on our recent\nresults in arXiv:1507.06997, we propose an extension of this relation to\ngeneral R\\'enyi entropies, which we show passes several consistency checks in\n$d=4$ and $d=6$.\n", "  High energy vibrational scattering in the binary systems UC and US is\nmeasured using time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering. A clear set of\nwell-defined peaks equally separated in energy is observed in UC, corresponding\nto harmonic oscillations of the light C atoms in a cage of heavy U atoms. The\nscattering is much weaker in US and only a few oscillator peaks are visible. We\nshow how the difference between the materials can be understood by considering\nthe neutron scattering lengths and masses of the lighter atoms. Monte Carlo ray\ntracing is used to simulate the scattering, with near quantitative agreement\nwith the data in UC, and some differences with US. The possibility of observing\nanharmonicity and anisotropy in the potentials of the light atoms is\ninvestigated in UC. Overall the observed data is well accounted for by\nconsidering each light atom as a single atom isotropic quantum harmonic\noscillator.\n", "  We derive the usual Oberbeck--Boussinesq approximation as a constitutive\nlimit of the full system describing the motion of an compressible linearly\nviscous fluid. To this end the starting system is written, using the Gibbs free\nenergy, in the variables $\\mathbf v, \\theta$ and $p$. The Oberbeck--Boussinesq\nsystem is then obtained as the thermal expansion coefficient $\\alpha$ and the\nisothermal compressibility coefficient $\\beta$ tend to zero.\n", "  The Omega-deformation is a harmonic trap, penning certain excitations near\nthe origin in a manner consistent with supersymmetry. Here we explore the\ndynamics of BPS monopoles and vortices in such a trap. We pay particular\nattention to monopoles in the Higgs phase, when they are confined to a vortex\nstring. Unusually for BPS solitons, the mass of these confined monopoles is\nquadratic in the topological charges. We compute an index theorem to determine\nthe number of collective coordinates of confined monopoles. Despite being\nrestricted to move on a line, we find that they have a rich dynamics. As the\nstrength of the trap increases, the number of collective coordinates can\nchange, sometimes with constituent monopoles disappearing, sometimes with new\nones emerging.\n", "  The Hamilton-Jacobi method in holography has produced important results both\nat a renormalization group (RG) fixed point and away from it. In this paper we\nuse the Hamilton-Jacobi method to compute the holographic trace anomaly for\nfour- and six-dimensional boundary conformal field theories (CFTs), assuming\nhigher-derivative gravity and interactions of scalar fields in the bulk. The\nscalar field contributions to the anomaly appear in CFTs with exactly marginal\noperators. Moving away from the fixed point, we show that the Hamilton-Jacobi\nformalism provides a deep connection between the holographic and the local RG.\nWe derive the local RG equation holographically, and verify explicitly that it\nsatisfies Weyl consistency conditions stemming from the commutativity of Weyl\nscalings. We also consider massive scalar fields in the bulk corresponding to\nboundary relevant operators, and comment on their effects to the local RG\nequation.\n", "  We show how the recently proposed XCone jet algorithm smoothly interpolates\nbetween resolved and boosted kinematics. When using standard jet algorithms to\nreconstruct the decays of hadronic resonances like top quarks and Higgs bosons,\none typically needs separate analysis strategies to handle the resolved regime\nof well-separated jets and the boosted regime of fat jets with substructure.\nXCone, by contrast, is an exclusive cone jet algorithm that always returns a\nfixed number of jets, so jet regions remain resolved even when (sub)jets are\noverlapping in the boosted regime. In this paper, we perform three LHC case\nstudies---dijet resonances, Higgs decays to bottom quarks, and all-hadronic top\npairs---that demonstrate the physics applications of XCone over a wide\nkinematic range.\n", "  The Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrom (AdS-RN) black hole in the canonical\nensemble undergoes a phase transition similar to the liquid-gas phase\ntransition, i.e. the isocharges on the entropy-temperature plane develop an\nunstable branch when the charge is smaller than a critical value. It was later\ndiscovered that the isocharges on the entanglement entropy-temperature plane\nalso exhibit the same van der Waals-like structure, for spherical entangling\nregions. In this paper, we present numerical results which sharpen this\nsimilarity between entanglement entropy and black hole entropy, by showing that\nboth of these entropies obey Maxwell's equal area law to an accuracy of around\n1 %. Moreover, we checked this for a wide range of size of the spherical\nentangling region, and the equal area law holds independently of the size. We\nalso checked the equal area law for AdS-RN in 4 and 5 dimensions, so the\nconclusion is not specific to a particular dimension. Finally, we repeated the\nsame procedure for a similar, van der Waals-like transition of the dyonic black\nhole in AdS in a mixed ensemble (fixed electric potential and fixed magnetic\ncharge), and showed that the equal area law is not valid in this case. Thus the\nequal area law for entanglement entropy seems to be specific to the AdS-RN\nbackground.\n", "  Properties of the Cauchy--Jost (known also as Cauchy--Baker--Akhiezer)\nfunction of the KPII equation are described. By means of the\n$\\bar\\partial$-problem for this function it is shown that all equations of the\nKPII hierarchy are given in a compact and explicit form, including equations on\nthe Cauchy--Jost function itself, time evolutions of the Jost solutions and\nevolutions of the potential of the heat equation.\n", "  Superstring perturbation theory based on the 1PI effective theory approach\nhas been useful for addressing the problem of mass renormalization and vacuum\nshift. We derive Ward identities associated with space-time supersymmetry\ntransformation in this approach. This leads to a proof of the equality of\nrenormalized masses of bosons and fermions and identities relating fermionic\namplitudes to bosonic amplitudes after taking into account the effect of mass\nrenormalization. This also relates unbroken supersymmetry to a given order in\nperturbation theory to absence of tadpoles of massless scalars to higher order.\nThe results are valid at the perturbative vacuum as well as in the shifted\nvacuum when the latter describes the correct ground state of the theory. We\napply this to SO(32) heterotic string theory on Calabi-Yau 3-folds where a one\nloop Fayet-Iliopoulos term apparently breaks supersymmetry at one loop, but\nanalysis of the low energy effective field theory indicates that there is a\nnearby vacuum where supersymmetry is restored. We explicitly prove that the\nperturbative amplitudes of this theory around the shifted vacuum indeed satisfy\nthe Ward identities associated with unbroken supersymmetry. We also test the\ngeneral arguments by explicitly verifying the equality of bosonic and fermionic\nmasses at one loop order in the shifted vacuum, and the appearance of two loop\ndilaton tadpole in the perturbative vacuum where supersymmetry is expected to\nbe broken.\n", "  We present a static, isotropic fluid solution around a black hole and its\neffects on the field equations and the horizon. We offer the solutions, their\ndescriptions and we comment on their shortcomings. We derive from the proposed\nmetric the density, the pressure, the equation of state, the temperature near\nand far of the black hole and the equation of state parameter. We show that for\na special case, when $r\\rightarrow\\ 0$ the solution behaves as\n$p=\\frac{\\rho}{3}$, the equation of state for radiation and for\n$r\\rightarrow\\infty$ we observe that $p=0$, the equation of state for dust.\n", "  Relativistic jets naturally occur in astrophysical systems that involve\naccretion onto compact objects, such as core collapse of massive stars in\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and accretion onto supermassive black holes in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.\n", "  We study process of radiative neutrino pair emission $|e\\rangle \\rightarrow\n|g \\rangle + \\gamma +\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ from coherently excited heavy ions (quantum\nmixture of two ionic states, the ground and an excited states) in circular\nmotion. Determination of the neutrino mass is found to be possible with\nsimultaneous detection of the photon and one of neutrinos in the pair down to\nthe level of the smallest neutrino mass of order 5 meV in the three flavor\nscheme.\n", "  We evaluate the gauge invariant, dynamically conserved charges, recently\nobtained from the integral form of the Yang-Mills equations, for the BPS\nmulti-dyon solutions of a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory associated to any compact\nsemi-simple gauge group G. Those charges are shown to correspond to the\neigenvalues of the next-to-leading term of the asymptotic form of the Higgs\nfield at spatial infinity, and so coinciding with the usual topological charges\nof those solutions. Such results show that many of the topological charges\nconsidered in the literature are in fact dynamical charges, which conservation\nfollows from the global properties of classical Yang-Mills theories encoded\ninto their integral dynamical equations. The conservation of those charges can\nnot be obtained from the differential form of Yang-Mills equations.\n", "  We consider the exact coupling constant dependence of extremal correlation\nfunctions of ${\\cal N} = 2$ chiral primary operators in 4d ${\\cal N} = 2$\nsuperconformal gauge theories with gauge group SU(N) and N_f=2N massless\nfundamental hypermultiplets. The 2- and 3-point functions, viewed as functions\nof the exactly marginal coupling constant and theta angle, obey the tt*\nequations. In the case at hand, the tt* equations form a set of complicated\nnon-linear coupled matrix equations. We point out that there is an ad hoc\nself-consistent ansatz that reduces this set of partial differential equations\nto a sequence of decoupled semi-infinite Toda chains, similar to the one\nencountered previously in the special case of SU(2) gauge group. This ansatz\nrequires a surprising new non-renormalization theorem in ${\\cal N} = 2$\nsuperconformal field theories. We derive a general 3-loop perturbative formula\nfor 2- and 3-point functions in the ${\\cal N} = 2$ chiral ring of the SU(N)\ntheory, and in all explicitly computed examples we find agreement with the tt*\nequations, as well as the above-mentioned ansatz. This is suggestive evidence\nfor an interesting non-perturbative conjecture about the structure of the\n${\\cal N} = 2$ chiral ring in this class of theories. We discuss several\nimplications of this conjecture. For example, it implies that the holonomy of\nthe vector bundles of chiral primaries over the superconformal manifold is\nreducible. It also implies that a specific subset of extremal correlation\nfunctions can be computed in the SU(N) theory using information solely from the\nS^4 partition function of the theory obtained by supersymmetric localization.\n", "  We report the properties of emission lines associated with the cascaded\nrecombination of a quadexciton in single GaAlAs/AlAs quantum dots, studied by\nmeans of polarization-resolved photoluminescence and single-photon correlation\nexperiments. It is found that photons which are emitted in a double-step 4X-3X\nprocess preserve their linear polarization, similarly to the case of conserved\npolarization of correlated photons in the 2X-X cascade. In contrast, an\nemission of either co-linear or cross-linear pairs of photons is observed for\nthe 3X-2X cascade. Each emission line associated with the quadexciton cascade\nshows doublet structure in the polarization-resolved photoluminescence\nexperiment. The maximum splitting is seen when the polarization axis is chosen\nalong and perpendicular to the [110] crystallographic direction. This effect is\nascribed to the fine structure splitting of the exciton and triexciton states\nin the presence of an anisotropic confining potential of ae dot. We also show\nthat the splitting in the triexciton state surpasses that in the exciton state\nby a factor up to eight and their ratio scales with the energy distance between\nthe 3X and X emission lines, thus, very likely, with a lateral size and/or a\ncomposition of the dot.\n", "  We use a systematic effective field theory setup to derive the $b\\bar{b}H$\nproduction cross section. Our result combines the merits of both fixed 4-flavor\nand 5-flavor schemes. It contains the full 4-flavor result, including the exact\ndependence on the $b$-quark mass, and improves it with a resummation of\ncollinear logarithms of $m_b/m_H$. In the massless limit, it corresponds to a\nreorganized 5-flavor result. While we focus on $b\\bar{b}H$ production, our\nmethod applies to generic heavy-quark initiated processes at hadron colliders.\nOur setup resembles the variable flavor number schemes known from heavy-flavor\nproduction in deep-inelastic scattering, but also differs in some key aspects.\nMost importantly, the effective $b$-quark PDF appears as part of the\nperturbative expansion of the final result where it effectively counts as an\n$O(\\alpha_s)$ object. The transition between the fixed-order (4-flavor) and\nresummation (5-flavor) regimes is governed by the low matching scale at which\nthe $b$-quark is integrated out. Varying this scale provides a systematic way\nto assess the perturbative uncertainties associated with the resummation and\nmatching procedure and reduces by going to higher orders. We discuss the\npractical implementation and present numerical results for the $b\\bar{b}H$\nproduction cross section at NLO+NLL. We also provide a comparison to the\ncorresponding predictions in the fixed 4-flavor and 5-flavor results and the\nSantander matching prescription. Compared to the latter, we find a slightly\nreduced uncertainty and a larger central value, with its central value lying at\nthe lower edge of our uncertainty band.\n", "  We consider QCD radiative corrections to top-quark pair production at hadron\ncolliders. We use the $q_T$ subtraction formalism to perform a\nfully-differential computation for this process. Our calculation is accurate up\nto the next-to-leading order in QCD perturbation theory and it includes all the\nflavour off-diagonal partonic channels at the next-to-next-to-leading order. We\npresent a comparison of our numerical results with those obtained with the\npublicly available numerical programs MCFM and Top++.\n", "  We derive superconformal partial waves for all scalar four-point functions on\na super Grassmannian space Gr(m|n,2m|2n) for all m,n. This family of four-point\nfunctions includes those of all (arbitrary weight) half BPS operators in both\nN=4 SYM (m=n=2) and in N=2 superconformal field theories in four dimensions\n(m=2,n=1) on analytic superspace. It also includes four-point functions of all\n(arbitrary dimension) scalar fields in non-supersymmetric conformal field\ntheories (m=2,n=0) on Minkowski space, as well as those of a certain class of\nrepresentations of the compact SU(2n) coset spaces. As an application we then\nspecialise to N=4 SYM and use these results to perform a detailed\nsuperconformal partial wave analysis of the four- point functions of arbitrary\nweight half BPS operators. We discuss the non-trivial separation of protected\nand unprotected sectors for the <2222>, <2233> and <3333> cases in an SU(N)\ngauge theory at finite N. The <2233> correlator predicts a non-trivial\nprotected twist four sector for <3333> which we can completely determine using\nthe knowledge that there is precisely one such protected twist four operator\nfor each spin.\n", "  The dispersive approach to QCD, which properly embodies the intrinsically\nnonperturbative constraints originating in the kinematic restrictions on\nrelevant physical processes and extends the applicability range of perturbation\ntheory towards the infrared domain, is briefly overviewed. The study of OPAL\n(update 2012) and ALEPH (update 2014) experimental data on inclusive tau lepton\nhadronic decay in vector and axial-vector channels within dispersive approach\nis presented.\n", "  We propose a scheme, based on \\Delta(27) flavor symmetry and supplemented by\nother discrete symmetries and inverse seesaw mechanism, where both the light\nneutrino masses and the deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing matrix can be\nlinked to the source of lepton number violation. The hierarchies of the charged\nleptons are explained. We find that the quark masses including their\nhierarchies and the mixing can also be constructed in a similar way.\n", "  Topological quantum phase transitions intrinsically intertwine\nself-similarity and topology of many-electron wave-functions, and divining them\nis one of the most significant ways to advance understanding in condensed\nmatter physics. Our focus is to investigate an unconventional class of the\ntransitions between insulators and Dirac semimetals whose description is beyond\nconventional pseudo relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian. At the transition without\nthe long-range Coulomb interaction, the electronic energy dispersion along one\ndirection behaves like a relativistic particle, linear in momentum, but along\nthe other direction it behaves like a non-relativistic particle, quadratic in\nmomentum. Various physical systems ranging from TiO${}_2$-VO${}_2$\nheterostructure to organic material $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)${}_2$ I${}_3$ under\npressure have been proposed to have such anisotropic dispersion relation. Here,\nwe discover a novel quantum criticality at the phase transition by\nincorporating the 1/r long-range Coulomb interaction. Unique interplay between\nthe Coulomb interaction and electronic critical modes enforces not only the\nanisotropic renormalization of the Coulomb interaction but also marginally\nmodified electronic excitation. In connection with experiments, we investigate\nseveral striking effects in physical observables of our novel criticality.\n", "  In 1993 Rosso and Jones computed for every simple, complex Lie algebra g_C\nand every colored torus knot in S^3 the value of the corresponding\nU_q(g_C)-quantum invariant by using the machinery of quantum groups. In the\npresent paper we derive a S^2 x S^1-analogue of the Rosso-Jones formula (for\ncolored torus ribbon knots) directly from a rigorous realization of the\ncorresponding (gauge fixed) Chern-Simons path integral. In order to compare the\nexplicit expressions obtained for torus knots in S^2 x S^1 with those for torus\nknots in S^3 one can perform a suitable surgery operation. By doing so we\nverify that the original Rosso-Jones formula is indeed recovered for every g_C.\n", "  Within the braneworld paradigm the tachyonic scalar field has been used to\ngenerate models that attempt to solve some of the open problems that physics\nfaces nowadays, both in cosmology and high energy physics as well. When these\nfield configurations are produced by the interplay of higher dimensional warped\ngravity with some matter content, braneworld models must prove to be {\\it\nstable} under the whole set of small fluctuations of the gravitational and\nmatter fields background, among other consistency tests. Here we present a\ncomplete proof of the stability under scalar perturbations of tachyonic thick\nbraneworlds with an embedded maximally symmetric 4D space-time, revealing its\nphysical consistency. This family of models contains a recently reported\ntachyonic de Sitter thick braneworld which possesses a series of appealing\nproperties. These features encompass complete regularity, asymptotic flatness\n(instead of being asymptotically dS or AdS) even when it contains a negative\nbulk cosmological constant, a relevant 3-brane with dS metric which naturally\narises from the full set of field equations of the 5D background (it is not\nimposed), qualitatively describing the inflationary epochs of our Universe, and\na graviton spectrum with a single zero mode bound state that accounts for the\n4D graviton localised on the brane and is separated from the continuum of\nKaluza-Klein massive graviton excitations by a mass gap. Gauge vector fields\nwith a single massless bound state in its mass spectrum are also localised on\nthis braneworld model a fact that allows us to recover the Coulomb's law of our\n4D world. All these properties of the above referred tachyonic braneworld\ntogether with the positive stability analysis provided in this work, constitute\na firm step towards the construction of realistic cosmological models within\nthe braneworld paradigm.\n", "  We investigate two types of chimera states, i.e., patterns consisting of\ncoexisting spatially separated domains with coherent and incoherent dynamics,\nin ring networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators with symmetry-breaking coupling,\nunder the influence of noise. Amplitude chimeras are characterized by\ntemporally periodic dynamics throughout the whole network, but spatially\nincoherent behavior with respect to the amplitudes in a part of the system;\nthey are long-living transients. Chimera death states generalize chimeras to\nstationary inhomogeneous patterns (oscillation death), which combine spatially\ncoherent and incoherent domains. We analyze the impact of random perturbations,\naddressing the question of robustness of chimera states in the presence of\nwhite noise. We further consider the effect of symmetries applied to random\ninitial conditions.\n", "  A cosmic axion, via the electromagnetic anomaly, induces an oscillating\nelectric dipole for the electron of frequency $m_a$ and strength\n$\\sim$(few)$\\times 10^{-32}$ e-cm, two orders of magnitude above the nucleon,\nand within a few orders of magnitude of the present standard model constant\nlimit. We give a detailed study of this phenomenon via the interaction of the\ncosmic axion, through the electromagnetic anomaly, with particular emphasis on\nthe decoupling limit of the axion, $\\partial_t a(t)\\propto m_a \\rightarrow 0$.\nThe analysis is subtle, and we find the general form of the action involves a\nlocal contact interaction and a nonlocal contribution, analogous to the\n\"transverse current\" in QED, that enforces the decoupling limit. We carefully\nderive the effective action in the Pauli-Schroedinger non-relativistic\nformalism, and in Georgi's heavy quark formalism adapted to the \"heavy\nelectron\" ($m_e>>m_a$). We compute the electric dipole radiation emitted by\nfree electrons, magnets and currents, immersed in the cosmic axion field, and\ndiscuss experimental configurations that may yield a detectable signal.\n", "  In this article, we present the scalar-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type\nand scalar-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type pentaquark configurations\nin the diquark model, and study the masses and pole residues of the\n$J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^\\pm$ hidden-charmed pentaquark states in details with the\nQCD sum rules by extending our previous work on the $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and\n${\\frac{5}{2}}^{+}$ hidden-charmed pentaquark states. We calculate the\ncontributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension-10 in the operator\nproduct expansion by constructing both the\nscalar-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type and\nscalar-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type interpolating currents. The\npresent predictions of the masses can be confronted to the LHCb experimental\ndata in the future.\n", "  The holographic dual of a gravitational theory around the de Sitter\nbackground is argued to be a Euclidean conformal gravity theory in one fewer\ndimensions. The measure for the holographic theory naturally includes a sum\nover topologies as well as conformal structures.\n", "  We show that the system of $k$ NS5-branes wrapping $\\mathbb{T}^4\\times S^1$\nhas non-trivial vacuum structure. Different vacua have different spectra of 1/4\nBPS states that carry momentum and winding around the $S^1$. In one vacuum,\nsuch states are described by black holes; in another, they can be thought of as\nperturbative BPS states in Double Scaled Little String Theory. In general, both\nkinds of states are present. We compute the degeneracy of perturbative BPS\nstates exactly, and show that it differs from that of the corresponding black\nholes. We comment on the implication of our results to the black hole\nmicrostate program, UV/IR mixing in Little String Theory, string\nthermodynamics, the string/black hole transition, and other issues.\n", "  We obtain the action for a curved superconformal abelian M5 brane with the\nbackground R-symmetry gauge field turned on. We then restrict ourselves to\nsuperconformal M5 brane on a sphere times flat Minkowski space. We choose\nR-symmetry SO(1,4) instead of SO(5), which enables us to partially twist on\nMinkowski space and replace it by some curved Lorentzian manifold. We obtain M5\nbrane actions on $M_{1,1} \\times S^4$ and $M_{1,2} \\times S^3$ where actions\nand all fields, including the background gauge field, are real. Dimensional\nreduction along time gives real 5d SYM actions with nonabelian generalizations.\n", "  Searches for pair-produced scalar leptoquarks are performed using 20\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data provided by the LHC and recorded by\nthe ATLAS detector at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. Events with two electrons (muons) and\ntwo or more jets in the final state are used to search for first\n(second)-generation leptoquarks. The results from two previously published\nATLAS analyses are interpreted in terms of third-generation leptoquarks\ndecaying to $b\\nu_{\\tau}\\bar{b}\\bar{\\nu_{\\tau}}$ and\n$t\\nu_{\\tau}\\bar{t}\\bar{\\nu_{\\tau}}$ final states. No statistically significant\nexcess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in any channel and\nscalar leptoquarks are excluded at 95% CL with masses up to $m_{\\mathrm{LQ1}}$\n< 1050 GeV for first-generation leptoquarks, $m_{\\mathrm{LQ2}}$ < 1000 GeV for\nsecond-generation leptoquarks, $m_{\\mathrm{LQ3}} < $ 625 GeV for\nthird-generation leptoquarks in the $b\\nu_{\\tau}\\bar{b}\\bar{\\nu_{\\tau}}$\nchannel, and 200 $< m_{\\mathrm{LQ3}} < $ 640 GeV in the\n$t\\nu_{\\tau}\\bar{t}\\bar{\\nu_{\\tau}}$ channel.\n", "  It was recently argued that quantum field theories possess one-form and\nhigher-form symmetries, labelled `generalized global symmetries.' In this\npaper, we describe how those higher-form symmetries can be understood\nmathematically as special cases of more general 2-groups and higher groups, and\ndiscuss examples of quantum field theories admitting actions of more general\nhigher groups than merely one-form and higher-form symmetries. We discuss\nanalogues of topological defects for some of these higher symmetry groups,\nrelating some of them to ordinary topological defects. We also discuss\ntopological defects in cases in which the moduli `space' (technically, a stack)\nadmits an action of a higher symmetry group. Finally, we outline a proposal for\nhow certain anomalies might potentially be understood as describing a\ntransmutation of an ordinary group symmetry of the classical theory into a\n2-group or higher group symmetry of the quantum theory, which we link to WZW\nmodels and bosonization.\n", "  We classify the complete set of dimension-5 operators relevant for the\nresonant production of a singlet of spin 0 or 2 linearly coupled to the\nStandard Model (SM). We compute the decay width of such states as a function of\nthe effective couplings, and provide the matching to various well-motivated New\nPhysics scenarios. We then investigate the possibility that one of these\nneutral resonances be at the origin of the excess in diboson production\nrecently reported by the ATLAS collaboration. We perform a shape analysis of\nthe excess under full consideration of the systematic uncertainties to extract\nthe width $\\Gamma_{\\rm tot}$ of the hypothetical resonance, finding it to be in\nthe range 26 GeV $<\\Gamma_{\\rm tot}<$ 144 GeV at 95\\% C.L. We then point out\nthat the three overlapping selections $WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$ reported by ATLAS follow\na joint trivariate Poisson distribution, which opens the possibility of a\nthorough likelihood analysis of the event rates. The background systematic\nuncertainties are also included in our analysis. We show that the data do not\nrequire $W\\!Z$ production and could thus in principle be explained by neutral\nresonances. We then use both the information on the width and the cross\nsection, which prove to be highly complementary, to test the effective\nLagrangians of singlet resonances. Regarding specific models, we find that\nneither scalars coupled via the Higgs-portal nor the Randall-Sundrum (RS)\nradion can explain the ATLAS anomaly. The RS graviton with all matter on the\ninfrared (IR) brane can in principle fit the observed excess, while the RS\nmodel with matter propagating in the bulk requires the presence of IR brane\nkinetic terms for the gauge fields.\n", "  We present a unified framework for the holographic computation of Virasoro\nconformal blocks at large central charge. In particular, we provide bulk\nconstructions that correctly reproduce all semiclassical Virasoro blocks that\nare known explicitly from conformal field theory computations. The results\nrevolve around the use of geodesic Witten diagrams, recently introduced in\narXiv:1508.00501, evaluated in locally AdS$_3$ geometries generated by\nbackreaction of heavy operators. We also provide an alternative computation of\nthe heavy-light semiclassical block -- in which two external operators become\nparametrically heavy -- as a certain scattering process involving higher spin\ngauge fields in AdS$_3$; this approach highlights the chiral nature of Virasoro\nblocks. These techniques may be systematically extended to compute corrections\nto these blocks and to interpolate amongst the different semiclassical regimes.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated the evolution of\nband-edges in few-layer phosphorene as a function of the number of P layers.\nOur results predict that monolayer phosphorene is an indirect band gap\nsemiconductor and its valence band edge is extremely sensitive to strain. Its\nband gap could undergo an indirect-to-direct transition under a lattice\nexpansion as small as 1% along zigzag direction. A semi-empirical interlayer\ncoupling model is proposed, which can well reproduce the evolution of valence\nband-edges obtained by first-principles calculations. We conclude that the\ninterlayer coupling plays a dominated role in the evolution of the band-edges\nvia decreasing both band gap and carrier effective masses with the increase of\nphosphorene thickness. A scrutiny of the orbital-decomposed band structure\nprovides a better understanding of the upward shift of valence band maximum\nsurpassing that of conduction band minimum.\n", "  We solve the Killing spinor equations of standard and massive IIA\nsupergravities for a Killing spinor whose isotropy subgroup in Spin(9, 1) is\nSU(4) and identify the geometry of the spacetime. We demonstrate that the\nKilling spinor equations impose some mild constraints on the geometry of the\nspacetime which include the existence of a time-like Killing vector field which\nleaves the fields and the Killing spinor invariant.\n", "  Spin-2 fields are often candidates in physics beyond the Standard Model\nnamely the models with extra-dimensions where spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons\ncouple to the fields of the SM. Also, in the context of Higgs searches, spin-2\nfields have been studied as an alternative to the scalar Higgs boson. In this\narticle, we present the complete three loop QCD radiative corrections to the\nspin-2 quark-antiquark and spin-2 gluon-gluon form factors in SU(N) gauge\ntheory with $n_f$ light flavors. These form factors contribute to both\nquark-antiquark and gluon-gluon initiated processes involving spin-2 particle\nin the hadronic reactions at the LHC. We have studied the structure of infrared\nsingularities in these form factors up to three loop level using Sudakov\nintegro-differential equation and found that the anomalous dimensions\noriginating from soft and collinear regions of the loop integrals coincide with\nthose of the electroweak vector boson and Higgs form factors confirming the\nuniversality of the infrared singularities in QCD amplitudes.\n", "  An accurate understanding of the phase diagram of dense hydrogen and helium\nmixtures is a crucial component in the construction of accurate models of\nJupiter, Saturn, and Jovian extrasolar planets. Though DFT based first\nprinciples methods have the potential to provide the accuracy and computational\nefficiency required for this task, recent benchmarking in hydrogen has shown\nthat achieving this accuracy requires a judicious choice of functional, and a\nquantification of the errors introduced. In this work, we present a quantum\nMonte Carlo based benchmarking study of a wide range of density functionals for\nuse in hydrogen-helium mixtures at thermodynamic conditions relevant for Jovian\nplanets. Not only do we continue our program of benchmarking energetics and\npressures, but we deploy QMC based force estimators and use them to gain\ninsights into how well the local liquid structure is captured by different\ndensity functionals. We find that TPSS, BLYP and vdW-DF are the most accurate\nfunctionals by most metrics, and that the enthalpy, energy, and pressure errors\nare very well behaved as a function of helium concentration. Beyond this, we\nhighlight and analyze the major error trends and relative differences exhibited\nby the major classes of functionals, and estimate the magnitudes of these\neffects when possible.\n", "  We show the link between U1 lattice gauge theories and the off-equilibrium\nthermodynamics of a large class of nonlinear oscillators networks. The coupling\nbetween the oscillators plays the role of a gauge field, or connection, on the\nnetwork. The thermodynamical forces that drive energy flows are expressed in\nterms of the curvature of the connection, analogous to a geometric phase. The\nmodel, which holds both close and far from equilibrium, predicts the existence\nof persistent energy and particle currents circulating in close loops through\nthe network. The predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations. Possible\nextension of the theory and experimental applications to nanoscale devices are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  We consider top-antitop quark ($t{\\bar t}$) production at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) with subsequent decay into dileptonic and lepton plus jets final\nstates. We present a set of leptonic angular correlations and distributions\nwith which experiments can probe all the independent coefficient functions of\nthe top-spin dependent parts of the $t{\\bar t}$ production spin density\nmatrices. We compute these angular correlations and distributions for LHC\ncenter-of-mass energies 8, 13, and 14 TeV within the Standard Model at\nnext-to-leading order in the QCD coupling including the mixed QCD-weak\ncorrections and for the transverse top-quark polarization and the $t{\\bar t}$\ncharge asymmetry also the mixed QCD-QED corrections. In addition we analyze and\ncompute the effects of new interactions on these observables in terms of a\ngauge-invariant effective Lagrangian which contains all operators relevant for\nhadronic $t{\\bar t}$ production up to mass dimension six.\n", "  We give a complete analysis of indirect determinations of the top quark mass\nin the Standard Model by introducing a systematic procedure to identify\nobservables that receive quantum corrections enhanced by powers of $M_t$. We\npropose to use flavour physics as a tool to extract the top quark mass.\nAlthough present data give only a poor determination, we show how future\ntheoretical and experimental progress in flavour physics can lead to an\naccuracy in $M_t$ well below 2 GeV. We revisit determinations of $M_t$ from\nelectroweak data, showing how an improved measurement of the $W$ mass leads to\nan accuracy well below 1 GeV.\n", "  We analyze electroweak baryogenesis during a two-step electroweak symmetry\nbreaking transition, wherein the baryon asymmetry is generated during the first\nstep and preserved during the second. Focusing on the dynamics of CP-violation\nrequired for asymmetry generation, we discuss general considerations for\nsuccessful two-step baryogenesis. Using a concrete model realization, we\nillustrate in detail the viability of this scenario and the implications for\npresent and future electric dipole moment (EDM) searches. We find that\nCP-violation associated with a partially excluded sector may yield the observed\nbaryon asymmetry while evading present and future EDM constraints.\n", "  We present the results of an investigation to determine the longitudinal\n(zonal) distributions and temporal evolution of ices on the surface of Triton.\nBetween 2002 and 2014, we obtained 63 nights of near-infrared (0.67-2.55\n$\\mu$m) spectra using the SpeX instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility\n(IRTF). Triton has spectral features in this wavelength region from N$_2$, CO,\nCH$_4$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O. Absorption features of ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) and\n$^{13}$CO are coincident at 2.405 $\\mu$m, a feature that we detect in our\nspectra. We calculated the integrated band area (or fractional band depth in\nthe case of H$_2$O) in each nightly average spectrum, constructed longitudinal\ndistributions, and quantified temporal evolution for each of the chosen\nabsorption bands. The volatile ices (N$_2$, CO, CH$_4$) show significant\nvariability over one Triton rotation and have well-constrained longitudes of\npeak absorption. The non-volatile ices (CO$_2$, H$_2$O) show poorly-constrained\npeak longitudes and little variability. The longitudinal distribution of the\n2.405 $\\mu$m band shows little variability over one Triton rotation and is\n97$\\pm$44$^{\\circ}$ and 92$\\pm$44$^{\\circ}$ out of phase with the 1.58 $\\mu$m\nand 2.35 $\\mu$m CO bands, respectively. This evidence indicates that the 2.405\n$\\mu$m band is due to absorption from non-volatile ethane. CH$_4$ absorption\nincreased over the period of the observations while absorption from all other\nices showed no statistically signifcant change. We conclude from these results\nthat the southern latitudes of Triton are currently dominated by non-volatile\nices and as the sub-solar latitude migrates northwards, a larger quantity of\nvolatile ice is coming into view.\n", "  We propose a method to calculate the two-dimensional (2D) fission-fragment\nyield $Y(Z,N)$ versus both proton and neutron number, with inclusion of\nodd-even staggering effects in both variables. The approach is to use Brownian\nshape-motion on a macroscopic-microscopic potential-energy surface which, for a\nparticular compound system is calculated versus four shape variables:\nelongation (quadrupole moment $Q_2$), neck $d$, left nascent fragment\nspheroidal deformation $\\epsilon_{\\rm f1}$, right nascent fragment deformation\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm f2}$ and two asymmetry variables, namely proton and neutron\nnumbers in each of the two fragments. The extension of previous models 1)\nintroduces a method to calculate this generalized potential-energy function and\n2) allows the correlated transfer of nucleon pairs in one step, in addition to\nsequential transfer. In the previous version the potential energy was\ncalculated as a function of $Z$ and $N$ of the compound system and its shape,\nincluding the asymmetry of the shape. We outline here how to generalize the\nmodel from the \"compound-system\" model to a model where the emerging fragment\nproton and neutron numbers also enter, over and above the compound system\ncomposition.\n", "  We introduce a new class of Composite Higgs models in which electroweak\nsymmetry is broken by a seesaw-like mechanism. If a global symmetry is broken\nsequentially at different scales, two sets of pseudo-Goldstone bosons will\narise, one set being typically heavier than the other. If two Composite Higgs\ndoublets mix, then the mass-squared of the lighter state can be driven\nnegative, and induce EWSB. We illustrate with the example $SO(6) \\rightarrow\nSO(5) \\rightarrow SO(4)$, and derive an estimate of the light Higgs potential.\nWe find that the introduction of an extra scale can ease many of the tensions\npresent in conventional Composite Higgs models, especially those related to\nfine-tuning. In particular we find that we can significantly raise the upper\nbound on the mass of the elusive top partners.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of 90 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs)\nin a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect by\nthe South Pole Telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-based\nfacilities. We infer the star formation rate (SFR) for the BCG in each cluster,\nbased on the UV and IR continuum luminosity, as well as the [O II] emission\nline luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systems\nwith SFR > 100 Msun/yr. We find that the BCG SFR exceeds 10 Msun/yr in 31 of 90\n(34%) cases at 0.25 < z < 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.\nAt z > 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decrease\nin the BCG SFR over the past ~9 Gyr. At low-z, we find that the specific star\nformation rate in BCGs is declining more slowly with time than for field or\ncluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling ICM\nin relaxed, cool core clusters. At z > 0.6, the correlation between cluster\ncentral entropy and BCG star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -\nis not present. Instead, we find that the most star-forming BCGs at high-z are\nfound in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. We investigate the\nrest-frame near-UV morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming BCGs\nusing data from the Hubble Space Telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetric\nUV morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. The high fraction of\nstar-forming BCGs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early times\nsuggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in BCGs may have\nrecently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to ICM cooling.\n", "  We derive a general expression for the probability of observing deviations\nfrom statistical isotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) if the\nprimordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian and extend to superhorizon scales. The\nprimary motivation is to properly characterize the monopole and dipole\nmodulations of the primordial power spectrum that are generated by the coupling\nbetween superhorizon and subhorizon perturbations. Unlike previous proposals\nfor generating the hemispherical power asymmetry, we do not assume that the\npower asymmetry results from a single large superhorizon mode. Instead, we\nextrapolate the observed power spectrum to superhorizon scales and compute the\npower asymmetry that would result from a specific realization of non-Gaussian\nperturbations on scales larger than the observable universe. Our study\nencompasses many of the scenarios that have been put forward as possible\nexplanations for the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry. We confirm our analytic\npredictions for the probability of a given power asymmetry by comparing them to\nnumerical realizations of CMB maps. We find that non-local models of\nnon-Gaussianity and scale-dependent local non-Gaussianity produce\nscale-dependent modulations of the power spectrum, thereby potentially\nproducing both a monopolar and a dipolar power modulation on large scales. We\nthen provide simple examples of finding the posterior distributions for the\nparameters of the bispectrum from the observed monopole and dipole modulations.\n", "  Redshifted H{\\sc\\,i} 21 cm emission from unresolved low-redshift large scale\nstructure is a promising window for ground-based Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n(BAO) observations. A major challenge for this method is separating the cosmic\nsignal from the foregrounds of Galactic and extra-Galactic origins that are\nstronger by many orders of magnitude than the former. The smooth frequency\nspectrum expected for the foregrounds would nominally contaminate only very\nsmall $k_\\parallel$ modes; however the chromatic response of the telescope\nantenna pattern at this wavelength to the foreground introduces non-smooth\nstructure, pervasively contaminating the cosmic signal over the physical scales\nof our interest. Such contamination defines a wedged volume in Fourier space\naround the transverse modes that is inaccessible for the cosmic signal. In this\npaper, we test the effect of this contaminated wedge on the future 21 cm BAO\nsurveys using Fisher information matrix calculation. We include the signal\nimprovement due to the BAO reconstruction technique that has been used for\ngalaxy surveys and test the effect of this wedge on the BAO reconstruction as a\nfunction of signal to noises and incorporate the results in the Fisher matrix\ncalculation. We find that the wedge effect expected at $z=1-2$ is very\ndetrimental to the angular diameter distances: the errors on angular diameter\ndistances increased by 3-4.4 times, while the errors on H(z) increased by a\nfactor of 1.5-1.6. We conclude that calibration techniques that clean out the\nforeground \"wedge\" would be extremely valuable for constraining angular\ndiameter distances from intensity-mapping 21 cm surveys.\n", "  We find new type II backgrounds with non-relativistic symmetries via\nnon-Abelian T-duality. First we consider geometries with Galilean symmetries in\ntype IIA, which have been identified as non-relativistic generalizations of the\nABJM background and massive IIA supergravities. We then consider the\nnon-Abelian T-duality transformation on the backgrounds with Lifshitz symmetry\nconstructed by Donos and Gauntlett. Using gauge/gravity duality we study\naspects of the field theory dual to these backgrounds.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of a correlated quantum dot in the mixed valence\nregime. We perform numerically exact calculations of the current after a\nquantum quench from equilibrium by rapidly applying a bias voltage in a wide\nrange of initial temperatures. The current exhibits short equilibration times\nand saturates upon the decrease of temperature at all times, indicating Kondo\nbehavior both in the transient regime and in steady state. The time-dependent\ncurrent saturation temperature matches the Kondo temperature at small times or\nsmall voltages; a substantially increased value is observed outside of linear\nresponse. These signatures are directly observable by experiments in the\ntime-domain.\n", "  We examine how corrections to $S$-state energy levels, $ E_{nS}$, in\nhydrogenic atoms due to the finite proton size are affected by moments of the\nproton charge distribution. The corrections to $E_{nS}$ are computed moment by\nmoment. The results demonstrate that the next-to-leading order term in the\nexpansion is of order $r_p / a_B $ times the size of the leading order $\n\\langle r_p^2 \\rangle $ term. Our analysis thus dispels any concern that the\nlarger relative size of this term for muonic hydrogen versus electronic\nhydrogen might account for the current discrepancy of proton radius\nmeasurements extracted from the two systems. Furthermore, the next-to-leading\norder term in powers of $r_p / a_B $ that we derive from a dipole proton form\nfactor is proportional to $\\langle r_p^3 \\rangle $, rather than $\\langle r_p^4\n\\rangle$ as would be expected from the scalar nature of the form factor. The\ndependence of the finite-size correction on $\\langle r_p^3 \\rangle $ and higher\nodd-power moments is shown to be a general result for any spherically symmetric\nproton charge distribution. A method for computing the moment expansion of the\nfinite-size correction to arbitrary order is introduced and the results are\ntabulated for principal quantum numbers up to $n=7$.\n", "  A huge swath of parameter space in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) has been ruled at after run I of the LHC. Various\nexclusion contours in the $m_{\\tilde{g}}-\\m_{\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}}$ plane were\nderived by the experimental collaborations, all based on three-body gluino\ndecay topologies. These limits are however extremely model dependent and do not\nalways reflect the level of exclusion. If the gluino-neutralino spectrum is\ncompressed, then the current mass limits can be drastically reduced. In such\nsituations, the radiative decay of the gluino $\\gino \\ra g \\neut{1}$ can be\ndominant and used as a sensitive probe of small mass splittings. We examine the\nsensitivity of constraints of some Run I experimental searches on this decay\nafter recasting them within the \\texttt{MadAnalysis5} framework. The recasted\nsearches are now part of the \\texttt{MadAnalysis5} Public Analysis Database. We\nalso design a dedicated search strategy and investigate its prospects to\nuncover this decay mode of the gluino at run II of the LHC. We emphasize that a\nmultijet search strategy may be more sensitive than a monojet one, even in the\ncase of very small mass differences.\n", "  We study the coupling of non-linear supersymmetry to supergravity. The\ngoldstino nilpotent superfield of global supersymmetry coupled to supergravity\nis described by a geometric action of the chiral curvature superfield R subject\nto the constraint (R-\\lambda)^2=0 with an appropriate constant \\lambda. This\nconstraint can be found as the decoupling limit of the scalar partner of the\ngoldstino in a class of f(R) supergravity theories.\n", "  When quark-gluon plasma emerges in the wake of a heavy-ion collision,\nmagnetic field created by the valence charges has already permitted the entire\ninteraction region. Evolution of this \"initial\" field in plasma is governed by\nMaxwell equations in electrically conducting medium. As the plasma expands\nexternal valence charges induce magnetic field that also contributes to the\ntotal magnetic field in plasma. We solve the initial value problem describing\nthese processes and argue that the initial magnetic field often dominates over\nthe one induced by the valence charges. In particular, it grows approximately\nproportional to the collision energy, unlike the induced component, which is\nenergy-independent. As a result, magnetic field has a significant\nphenomenological influence on quark-gluon plasma at the LHC energies over its\nentire lifetime.\n", "  Measurements of the $W$ boson mass are planned by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments, but for the time being, these may be unable to compete with the\ncurrent world average precision of 15~MeV, due to uncertainties in the PDFs. We\ndiscuss the potential of a measurement by the LHCb experiment based on the\ncharged lepton transverse momentum $p_T^{\\ell}$ spectrum in $W \\to \\mu\\nu$\ndecays. The unique forward acceptance of LHCb means that the PDF uncertainties\nwould be anti-correlated with those of $p_T^{\\ell}$ based measurements by ATLAS\nand CMS. We compute an average of ATLAS, CMS and LHCb measurements of $m_W$\nfrom the $p_T^{\\ell}$ distribution. Considering PDF uncertainties, this average\nis a factor of 1.3 more precise than an average of ATLAS and CMS alone. Despite\nthe relatively low rate of $W$ production in LHCb, we estimate that with the\nRun-II dataset, a measurement could be performed with sufficient experimental\nprecision to exploit this anti-correlation in PDF uncertainties. The modelling\nof the lepton-pair transverse momentum distribution in the neutral current\nDrell-Yan process could be a limiting factor of this measurement and will\ndeserve further studies.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the effect of the complete leading-order QED\ncorrections to the DGLAP equations in the perturbative evolution of parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs). This requires the extension of the purely QCD\nDGLAP evolution, including a PDF for the photons and, consistently, also for\nthe charged leptons $e^{\\pm}$, $\\mu^\\pm$ and $\\tau^\\pm$. We present the\nimplementation of the QED-corrected DGLAP evolution in the presence of photon\nand lepton PDFs in the APFEL program and, by means of different assumptions for\nthe initial scale PDFs, we produce for the first time PDF sets containing\ncharged lepton distributions. We also present phenomenological studies that aim\nto assess the impact of the presence of lepton PDFs in the proton for some\nrelevant SM (and BSM) processes at the LHC at 13 TeV and the FCC-hh at 100 TeV.\nThe impact of the photon PDF is also outlined for those processes.\n", "  We perform an updated analysis for the one-loop induced lepton flavor\nviolating radiative decays $l_i \\to l_j \\gamma$ in an extended mirror model.\nMixing effects of the neutrinos and charged leptons constructed with a\nhorizontal $A_4$ symmetry are also taken into account. Current experimental\nlimit and projected sensitivity on the branching ratio of $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$\nare used to constrain the parameter space of the model. Calculations of two\nrelated observables, the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the leptons,\nare included. Implications concerning the possible detection of mirror leptons\nat the LHC and the ILC are also discussed.\n", "  Laser gyroscopes making use of the Sagnac effect have been used as highly\naccurate rotation sensors for many years. First used in aerospace and defense\napplications, these devices have more recently been used for precision\nseismology and in other research settings. In particular, mid-sized (~1\nm-scale) laser gyros have been under development as tilt sensors to augment the\nadaptive active seismic isolation systems in terrestrial interferometric\ngravitational wave detectors. The most prevalent design is the \"active\"\ngyroscope, in which the optical ring cavity used to measure the Sagnac\ndegeneracy breaking is itself a laser resonator. In this article, we describe\nanother topology: a \"passive\" gyroscope, in which the sensing cavity is not\nitself a laser but is instead tracked using external laser beams. While subject\nto its own limitations, this design is free from the deleterious lock-in\neffects observed in active systems, and has the advantage that it can be\nconstructed using commercially available components. We demonstrate that our\ndevice achieves comparable sensitivity to those of similarly sized active laser\ngyroscopes.\n", "  The Kondo effect in condensed-matter systems manifests itself most sharply in\ntheir transport measurements. Here we propose an analogous transport signature\nof the orbital Kondo effect realized with ultracold atoms. Our system consists\nof imbalanced Fermi seas of two components of fermions and an impurity atom of\ndifferent species which is confined by an isotropic potential. We first apply a\n\\pi/2 pulse to transform two components of fermions into two superposition\nstates. Their interactions with the impurity atom then cause a \"transport\" of\nfermions from majority to minority superposition states, whose numbers can be\nmeasured after applying another 3\\pi/2 pulse. In particular, when the\ninteraction of one component of fermions with the impurity atom is tuned close\nto a confinement-induced p-wave or higher partial-wave resonance, the resulting\nconductance is shown to exhibit the Kondo signature, i.e., universal\nlogarithmic growth by lowering the temperature. The proposed transport\nmeasurement will thus provide a clear evidence of the orbital Kondo effect\naccessible in ultracold atom experiments and pave the way for developing new\ninsights into Kondo physics.\n", "  In this paper we consider the possibility of chiral (charge or spin density\nwave) symmetry breaking in graphene due to long-range Coulomb interaction by\ncomparing the results of the Bethe-Salpeter and functional\nrenormalization-group approaches. The former approach performs summation of\nladder diagrams in the particle-hole channel, and reproduces the results of the\nSchwinger-Dyson approach for the critical interaction strength of the quantum\nphase transition. The renormalization-group approach combines the effect of\ndifferent channels and allows to study the role of vertex corrections. The\ncritical interaction strength, which is necessary to induce the symmetry\nbreaking in the latter approach is found in the static approximation to be\n$\\alpha _{c}=e^{2}/(\\epsilon v_{F})\\approx 1.05$ without considering the Fermi\nvelocity renormalization, and $\\alpha _{c}=3.7$ with accounting the\nrenormailzation of the Fermi velocity. The latter value is expected to be\nhowever reduced, when the dynamic screening effects are taken into account,\nyielding the critical interaction, which is comparable to the one in freely\nsuspended graphene. We show that the vertex corrections are crucially important\nto obtain the mentioned values of critical interactions.\n", "  We study supervertices in six dimensional (2,0) supergravity theories, and\nderive supersymmetry non-renormalization conditions on the 4- and 6-derivative\nfour-point couplings of tensor multiplets. As an application, we obtain exact\nnon-perturbative results of such effective couplings in type IIB string theory\ncompactified on K3 surface, extending previous work on type II/heterotic\nduality. The weak coupling limit thereof, in particular, gives certain\nintegrated four-point functions of half-BPS operators in the nonlinear sigma\nmodel on K3 surface, that depend nontrivially on the moduli, and capture\nworldsheet instanton contributions.\n", "  We initiate the perturbative study of the S-matrix for the excitations on top\nof the GKP vacuum at strong coupling. Using the string sigma model action\nexpanded around the null cusp classical solution, we compute the tree-level\nS-matrix elements and compare them with the predictions from the asymptotic\nBethe Ansatz. We also check the factorization of the three-body S-matrix for\nvarious bosonic processes, finding precise agreement with the constraints\nimposed by integrability.\n", "  The global symmetry algebras of partially-massless (PM) higher-spin (HS)\nfields in (A)dS$_{d+1}$ are studied. The algebras involving PM generators up to\ndepth $2\\,(\\ell-1)$ are defined as the maximal symmetries of free conformal\nscalar field with $2\\,\\ell$ order wave equation in $d$ dimensions. We review\nthe construction of these algebras by quotienting certain ideals in the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of $(A)dS_{d+1}$ isometries. We discuss another\ndescription in terms of Howe duality and derive the formula for computing trace\nin these algebras. This enables us to explicitly calculate the bilinear form\nfor this one-parameter family of algebras. In particular, the bilinear form\nshows the appearance of additional ideal for any non-negative integer values of\n$\\ell-d/2\\,$, which coincides with the annihilator of the one-row $\\ell$-box\nYoung diagram representation of $\\mathfrak{so}_{d+2}\\,$. Hence, the\ncorresponding finite-dimensional coset algebra spanned by massless and PM\ngenerators is equivalent to the symmetries of this representation.\n", "  We determine the continuum limit of the curvature of the pseudocritical line\nof QCD with $n_f$=2+1 staggered fermions at nonzero temperature and quark\ndensity. We perform Monte Carlo simulations at imaginary baryon chemical\npotentials, adopting the HISQ/tree action discretization, as implemented in the\ncode by the MILC collaboration. Couplings are adjusted so as to move on a line\nof constant physics, as determined in Ref.~\\cite{Bazavov:2011nk}, with the\nstrange quark mass $m_s$ fixed at its physical value and a light-to-strange\nmass ratio $m_l/m_s=1/20$. The chemical potential is set at the same value for\nthe three quark species, $\\mu_l=\\mu_s\\equiv \\mu$. We attempt an extrapolation\nto the continuum using the results on lattices with temporal size up to\n$L_t=12$. Our estimate for the continuum value of the curvature $\\kappa$ at\nzero baryon density, $\\kappa=0.020(4)$, is compared with recent lattice results\nand with experimental determinations of the freeze-out curve.\n", "  According to various models, the orbital and the epicyclic frequencies of\nparticles moving on a circular orbit around compact objects are related to the\nquasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some pulsars or black\nhole candidates. It is expected that they originate from the inner edge of the\naccretion discs, deep into the gravitational field of the compact objects.\nConsidering the planned new generation X-ray timing observatories with large\ncollective areas, the quasi-periodic oscillations might be an excellent tool\nfor testing gravity in strong field regime and respectively alternative\ngravitational theories. We examine the orbital and the epicyclic frequencies of\na particle moving on a circular orbit around neutron or strange stars in $R^2$\ngravity. The case of slow rotation is considered too. The $R^2$ gravity results\nare compared to the General Relativistic case. We comment the deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, as well as the deviations due to rotation in both theories.\n", "  We analyze the magnetization at the interface between singlet and triplet\nsuperconductors and show that its direction and dependence on the phase\ndifference across the junction are strongly tied to the structure of the\ntriplet order parameter as well as to the pairing interactions. We consider\nequal spin helical, opposite spin chiral, and mixed symmetry pairing on the\ntriplet side and show that the magnetization vanishes at $\\phi=0$ only in the\nfirst case, follows approximately a $\\cos\\phi$ behavior for the second, and\nshows higher harmonics for the last configuration. We trace the origin of the\nmagnetization to the magnetic structure of the Andreev bound states near the\ninterface, and provide a symmetry-based explanation of the results. Our\nfindings can be used to control the magnetization in superconducting\nheterostructures and to test symmetries of spin-triplet superconductors.\n", "  Perturbative QCD calculations in the light-cone gauge have long suffered from\nthe ambiguity associated with the regularization of the poles in the gluon\npropagator. In this work we study sub-gauge conditions within the light-cone\ngauge corresponding to several known ways of regulating the gluon propagator.\nUsing the functional integral calculation of the gluon propagator, we rederive\nthe known sub-gauge conditions for the theta-function gauges and identify the\nsub-gauge condition for the principal value (PV) regularization of the gluon\npropagator's light-cone poles. The obtained sub-gauge condition for the PV case\nis further verified by a sample calculation of the classical Yang-Mills field\nof two collinear ultrarelativistic point color charges. Our method does not\nallow one to construct a sub-gauge condition corresponding to the well-known\nMandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription for regulating the gluon propagator poles.\n", "  We continue an examination of the microstate geometries program begun in\narXiv:1409.6017, focussing on the role of branes that wrap the cycles which\ndegenerate when a throat in the geometry deepens and a horizon forms. An\nassociated quiver quantum mechanical model of minimally wrapped branes exhibits\na non-negligible fraction of the gravitational entropy, which scales correctly\nas a function of the charges. The results suggest a picture of AdS_3/CFT_2\nduality wherein the long string that accounts for BTZ black hole entropy in the\nCFT description, can also be seen to inhabit the horizon of BPS black holes on\nthe gravity side.\n", "  We analyze soft and collinear gluon resummation effects at the N$^3$LL level\nfor Standard Model Higgs boson production via gluon fusion $gg\\to H$ and the\nneutral scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric\nextension at the N$^3$LL and NNLL level, respectively. We introduce refinements\nin the treatment of quark mass effects and subleading collinear gluon effects\nwithin the resummation. Soft and collinear gluon resummation effects amount to\nup to about 5% beyond the fixed-order results for scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs\nboson production.\n", "  We study 5d supersymmetric black holes which descend from strings of generic\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity in 6d. These strings have an F-theory\nrealization in 6d as D3 branes wrapping smooth genus $g$ curves in the base of\nelliptic 3-folds. They enjoy $(0,4)$ worldsheet supersymmetry with an extra\n$SU(2)_L$ current algebra at level $g$ realized on the left-movers. When the\nsmooth curves degenerate they lead to multi-string branches and we find that\nthe microscopic worldsheet theory flows in the IR to disconnected 2d CFTs\nhaving different central charges. The single string sector is the one with\nmaximal central charge, which when wrapped on a circle, leads to a 5d spinning\nBPS black hole whose horizon volume agrees with the leading entropy prediction\nfrom the Cardy formula. However, we find new phenomena where this branch meets\nother branches of the CFT. These include multi-string configurations which have\nno bound states in 6 dimensions but are bound through KK momenta when wrapping\na circle, as well as loci where the curves degenerate to spheres. These loci\nlead to black hole configurations which can have total angular momentum\nrelative to a Taub-Nut center satisfying $J^2 > M^3$ and whose number of\nstates, though exponentially large, grows much slower than those of the large\nspinning black hole.\n", "  We consider the BPS conditions of eleven dimensional supergravity, restricted\nto an appropriate ansatz for black holes in four non-compact directions.\nAssuming the internal directions to be described by a circle fibration over a\nK\\\"ahler manifold and considering the case where the complex structure moduli\nare frozen, we recast the resulting flow equations in terms of polyforms on\nthis manifold. The result is a set of equations that are in direct\ncorrespondence with those of gauged supergravity models in four dimensions\nconsistent with our simplifying assumptions. In view of this correspondence\neven for internal manifolds that do not correspond to known consistent\ntruncations, we comment on the possibility of obtaining gauged supergravities\nfrom reductions on K\\\"ahler manifolds.\n", "  The growth of galaxies is a key problem in understanding the structure and\nevolution of the universe. Galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination of\nstar formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshift\ndependent. Theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributions\nfrom the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint.\nExploiting the UltraVISTA catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of local\nultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, we\nquantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. We also compare our\nresults to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. At all\nredshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging from\nbeing isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within a\nprojected radius of 500 kpc. In models, progenitors have a systematically\nlarger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than in\nobservations, at all redshifts. Generally, in both observations and models, the\ninferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties.\nOverall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growth\nhistory of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z~2, both\nstar-formation and mergers at 1<z<2, and by mergers alone at z<1. Nonetheless,\ndetailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected mass\ngrowth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrect\nprogenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate and\nmass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.\n", "  The top quark flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) process is an excellent\nprobe to search for new physics in top sector since the Standard Model\nexpectation is extremely suppressed. We explore Higgs-mediated top quark FCNC,\nfocusing on $H$-$t$-$c$ Yukawa coupling $\\lambda_{ct}$ within the general two\nHiggs doublet model. After electroweak symmetry breaking the top quark FCNC\ncouplings are included in the charged Higgs Yukawa sector so that they\ncontribute to various processes in flavor physics. To probe $\\lambda_{ct}$, we\nstudy anomalous single top production and the same sign top pair production at\nthe LHC in association with flavor physics from the tree-level processes $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$, $B\\to \\tau \\nu$ as well as from the loop-level processes $B_d\n\\to X_s \\gamma$, $B_{d,s}-{\\overline B}_{d,s}$ mixing. We perform combined\nanalysis of all the constraints regarding the fine-tuning argument to fit the\ndata and discuss future prospect. The recently updated measurements on $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ still prefer large $\\lambda_{ct}$, but we show that the current\nbound on the same sign top pair production at the LHC gives the most\nsignificant upper bound on $\\lambda_{ct}$ to be less than $10\\sim30$ depending\non neutral heavy Higgs masses. We also find that for the given upper bound on\n$\\lambda_{ct}$, $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ put significant lower bound on\n$H$-$\\tau$-$\\tau$ Yukawa coupling, and the bound is proportional to the charged\nHiggs mass.\n", "  The soft photon theorem, in its standard form, requires corrections when the\nasymptotic particle states carry magnetic charges. These corrections are\ndeduced using electromagnetic duality and the resulting soft formula\nconjectured to be exact for all abelian gauge theories. Recent work has shown\nthat the standard soft theorem implies an infinity of conserved electric\ncharges. The associated symmetries are identified as `large' electric gauge\ntransformations. Here the magnetic corrections to the soft theorem are shown to\nimply a second infinity of conserved magnetic charges. The associated\nsymmetries are identified as `large' magnetic gauge transformations. The large\nmagnetic symmetries are naturally subsumed in a complexification of the\nelectric ones.\n", "  The random-cluster model, a correlated bond percolation model, unifies a\nrange of important models of statistical mechanics in one description,\nincluding independent bond percolation, the Potts model and uniform spanning\ntrees. By introducing a classification of edges based on their relevance to the\nconnectivity we study the stability of clusters in this model. We derive\nseveral exact relations for general graphs that allow us to derive\nunambiguously the finite-size scaling behavior of the density of bridges and\nnon-bridges. For percolation, we are also able to characterize the point for\nwhich clusters become maximally fragile and show that it is connected to the\nconcept of the bridge load. Combining our exact treatment with further results\nfrom conformal field theory, we uncover a surprising behavior of the variance\nof the number of (non-)bridges, showing that these diverge in two dimensions\nbelow the value $4\\cos^2{(\\pi/\\sqrt{3})}=0.2315891\\cdots$ of the cluster\ncoupling $q$. Finally, it is shown that a partial or complete pruning of\nbridges from clusters enables estimates of the backbone fractal dimension that\nare much less encumbered by finite-size corrections than more conventional\napproaches.\n", "  We examine the partition function of N=2* supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills\ntheory on the four-sphere in the large radius limit. We point out that the\nlarge radius partition function, at fixed N, is computed by saddle points lying\non particular walls of marginal stability on the Coulomb branch of the theory\non R^4. For N an even (odd) integer and \\theta_YM=0, (\\pi), these include a\npoint of maximal degeneration of the Donagi-Witten curve to a torus where BPS\ndyons with electric charge [N/2] become massless. We argue that the dyon\nsingularity is the lone saddle point in the SU(2) theory, while for SU(N) with\nN>2, we characterize potentially competing saddle points by obtaining the\nrelations between the Seiberg-Witten periods at such points. Using Nekrasov's\ninstanton partition function, we solve for the maximally degenerate saddle\npoint and obtain its free energy as a function of g_YM and N, and show that the\nresults are \"large-N exact\". In the large-N theory our results provide\nanalytical expressions for the periods/eigenvalues at the maximally degenerate\nsaddle point, precisely matching previously known formulae following from the\ncorrespondence between N=2* theory and the elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable\nmodel. The maximally singular point ceases to be a saddle point of the\npartition function above a critical value of the coupling, in agreement with\nthe recent findings of Russo and Zarembo.\n", "  We study how, as a result of the scanning of supersymmetry breaking during\nthe cosmological evolution, a relaxation mechanism can naturally determine a\nhierarchy between the weak scale and the masses of supersymmetric particles.\nSupersymmetry breaking is determined by QCD instanton effects, in an extremely\nminimal setup in which a single field drives the relaxation and breaks\nsupersymmetry. Since gauginos are lighter than the other supersymmetric\nparticles by a one-loop factor, the theory is a realisation of Split\nSupersymmetry free from the naturalness problem.\n", "  Models of 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity coupled to chiral multiplets with\nvanishing or positive scalar potential have been denoted as no-scale. Of\nparticular interest in the context of string theory are models which\nadditionally possess a shift-symmetry. In this case there exists a dual\ndescription of chiral models in terms of real linear multiplets. We classify\nall ungauged shift-symmetric no-scale supergravities in both formulations and\nverify that they match upon dualization. Additionally, we comment on the\nrealizations within effective supergravities descending from string\ncompactifications.\n", "  The late time optical and near-IR line profiles of many core-collapse\nsupernovae exhibit a red-blue asymmetry as a result of greater extinction by\ninternal dust of radiation emitted from the receding parts of the supernova\nejecta. We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust\non the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the\nmasses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al. (1989), the presence of an\nextended red scattering wing in late-time line profiles can also indicate dust\nformation. We find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily be\nflux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always be\nblue-shifted. We have collated optical spectra of SN 1987A from a variety of\narchival sources and have modelled the evolution of the H$\\alpha$ line from\ndays 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [OI] 6300,6363A doublet between days\n714 and 1478. A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we\nfind that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than\nsmoothly distributed dust models. Our line profile fits imply day 714 dust\nmasses of <3 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ for all grain types apart from very\nhigh albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07M$_{\\odot}$ can be\naccommodated. Large grain radii (>0.6$\\mu$m) are generally required to fit the\nline profiles even at the earlier epochs. We find that a large dust mass\n(>0.1M$_{\\odot}$) had formed by day 3604 and infer that the majority of the\npresent dust mass must have formed after this epoch. Our findings agree with\nrecent estimates from SED fits for the dust mass evolution of SN 1987A and\nsupport the inference that the majority of SN 1987A's dust formed many years\nafter the initial explosion.\n", "  Many methods exist for the construction of the Hilbert series describing the\nmoduli spaces of instantons. We explore some of the underlying group theoretic\nrelationships between these various constructions, including those based on the\nCoulomb branches and Higgs branches of SUSY quiver gauge theories, as well as\nthose based on generating functions derivable from the Weyl Character Formula.\nWe show how the character description of the reduced single instanton moduli\nspace of any Classical or Exceptional group can be deconstructed faithfully in\nterms of characters or modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials of its regular\nsemi-simple subgroups. We derive and utilise Highest Weight Generating\nfunctions, both for the characters of Classical or Exceptional groups and for\nthe Hall-Littlewood polynomials of unitary groups. We illustrate how the root\nspace data encoded in extended Dynkin diagrams corresponds to relationships\nbetween the Coulomb branches of quiver gauge theories for instanton moduli\nspaces and those for T(SU(N)) moduli spaces.\n", "  The existing equivalence between (generalized) BMS Ward identities with\nleading and subleading soft graviton theorems is extended to the case where the\nscattering particles are massive scalars. By extending the action of\ngeneralized BMS group off null infinity at late times, we show that there is a\nnatural action of such group not only on the radiative data at null infinity\nbut also on the scattering data of the massive scalar field. This leads to a\nformulation of Ward identities associated to the generalized BMS group when the\nscattering states are massive scalars or massless gravitons and we show that\nthese Ward identities are equivalent to the leading and subleading soft\ngraviton theorems.\n", "  Collective motion is one of the most ubiquitous behaviours displayed by\nsocial organisms and has led to the development of numerous models. Recent\nadvances in the understanding of sensory system and information processing by\nanimals impel to revise classical assumptions made in decisional algorithms. In\nthis context, we present a new model describing the three dimensional visual\nsensory system of fish that adjust their trajectory according to their\nperception field. Furthermore, we introduce a new stochastic process based on a\nprobability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on\na summation of influential vectors as it is classically assumed by most models.\nWe show that this model can spontaneously transits from consensus to choice. In\nparallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of\n10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these\nexperimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this\nperception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing\ncohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments. Finally, we discuss the\nadvances of this multilayer model and its possible outcomes in biological,\nphysical and robotic sciences.\n", "  The Galactic center is the closest region in which we can study star\nformation under extreme physical conditions like those in high-redshift\ngalaxies. We measure the temperature of the dense gas in the central molecular\nzone (CMZ) and examine what drives it. We mapped the inner 300 pc of the CMZ in\nthe temperature-sensitive J = 3-2 para-formaldehyde (p-H$_2$CO) transitions. We\nused the $3_{2,1} - 2_{2,0} / 3_{0,3} - 2_{0,2}$ line ratio to determine the\ngas temperature in $n \\sim 10^4 - 10^5 $cm$^{-3}$ gas. We have produced\ntemperature maps and cubes with 30\" and 1 km/s resolution and published all\ndata in FITS form. Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic center range from ~60\nK to > 100 K in selected regions. The highest gas temperatures T_G > 100 K are\nobserved around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr B2 cloud, the 20 km/s and\n50 km/s clouds, and in \"The Brick\" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit on\nthe cosmic ray ionization rate ${\\zeta}_{CR} < 10^{-14}$ 1/s. The dense\nmolecular gas temperature of the region around our Galactic center is similar\nto values found in the central regions of other galaxies, in particular\nstarburst systems. The gas temperature is uniformly higher than the dust\ntemperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the dense gas. Turbulent\nheating can readily explain the observed temperatures given the observed line\nwidths. Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in gas temperatures,\nso CMZ dense gas temperatures are not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas\ntemperatures previously observed to be high in the inner ~75 pc are confirmed\nto be high in the entire CMZ.\n", "  We present measurements of silica optomechanical resonators, known as bottle\nresonators, passively cooled in a cryogenic environment. These devices possess\na suite of properties that make them advantageous for preparation and\nmeasurement in the mechanical ground state, including high mechanical\nfrequency, high optical and mechanical quality factors, and optomechanical\nsideband resolution. Performing thermometry of the mechanical motion, we find\nthat the optical and mechanical modes demonstrate quantitatively similar\nlaser-induced heating, limiting the lowest average phonon occupation observed\nto just ~1500. Thermalization to the 9 mK thermal bath would facilitate quantum\nmeasurements on these promising nanogram-scale mechanical resonators.\n", "  We study neutrinoless double beta decay in left-right symmetric extension of\nthe standard model with type I and type II seesaw origin of neutrino masses.\nDue to the enhanced gauge symmetry as well as extended scalar sector, there are\nseveral new physics sources of neutrinoless double beta decay in this model.\nIgnoring the left-right gauge boson mixing and heavy-light neutrino mixing, we\nfirst compute the contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay for type I\nand type II dominant seesaw separately and compare with the standard light\nneutrino contributions. We then repeat the exercise by considering the presence\nof both type I and type II seesaw, having non-negligible contributions to light\nneutrino masses and show the difference in results from individual seesaw\ncases. Assuming the new gauge bosons and scalars to be around a TeV, we\nconstrain different parameters of the model including both heavy and light\nneutrino masses from the requirement of keeping the new physics contribution to\nneutrinoless double beta decay amplitude below the upper limit set by the GERDA\nexperiment and also satisfying bounds from lepton flavor violation, cosmology\nand colliders.\n", "  We demonstrate that the application of an external magnetic field could lead\nto an improved background rejection in neutrinoless double-beta (0nbb) decay\nexperiments using a high pressure xenon (HPXe) TPC. HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next\ngeneration of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy\nof neutrino masses.\n", "  We evaluate the measurement precision of the production cross section times\nthe branching ratio of the Higgs boson decaying into tau lepton pairs at the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC). We analyze various final states associated\nwith the main production mechanisms of the Higgs boson, the Higgs-strahlung and\nWW-fusion processes. The statistical precision of the production cross section\ntimes the branching ratio is estimated to be 2.6% and 6.9% for the\nHiggs-strahlung andWW-fusion processes, respectively, with the nominal\nintegrated luminosities assumed in the ILC Technical Design Report; the\nprecision improves to 1.0% and 3.4% with the running scenario including\npossible luminosity upgrades. The study provides a reference performance of the\nILC for future phenomenological analyses.\n", "  Hard-spin mean-field theory has recently been applied to Ising magnets,\ncorrectly yielding the absence and presence of an interface roughening\ntransition respectively in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions and producing the\nordering-roughening phase diagram for isotropic and anisotropic systems. The\napproach has now been extended to the effects of quenched random pinning\ncenters and missing bonds on the interface of isotropic and anisotropic Ising\nmodels in $d=3$. We find that these frozen impurities cause domain boundary\nroughening that exhibits consecutive thresholding transitions as a function\ninteraction of anisotropy. For both missing-bond and pinning-center impurities,\nfor moderately large values the anisotropy, the systems saturate to the\n\"solid-on-solid\" limit, exhibiting a single universal curve for the domain\nboundary width as a function of impurity concentration.\n", "  Inter-individual variability has various impacts in animal social behaviour.\nThis implies that not only collective behaviours have to be studied but also\nthe behavioural variability of each member composing the groups. To understand\nthose effects on group behaviour, we develop a quantitative methodology based\non automated ethograms and autonomous robots to study the inter-individual\nvariability among social animals. We choose chicks of \\textit{Gallus gallus\ndomesticus} as a classic social animal model system for their suitability in\nlaboratory and controlled experimentation. Moreover, even domesticated chicken\npresent social structures implying forms or leadership and filial imprinting.\nWe develop an imprinting methodology on autonomous robots to study individual\nand social behaviour of free moving animals. This allows to quantify the\nbehaviours of large number of animals. We develop an automated experimental\nmethodology that allows to make relatively fast controlled experiments and\nefficient data analysis. Our analysis are based on high-throughput data\nallowing a fine quantification of individual behavioural traits. We quantify\nthe efficiency of various state-of-the-art algorithms to automate data analysis\nand produce automated ethograms. We show that the use of robots allows to\nprovide controlled and quantified stimuli to the animals in absence of human\nintervention. We quantify the individual behaviour of 205 chicks obtained from\nhatching after synchronized fecundation. Our results show a high variability of\nindividual behaviours and of imprinting quality and success. Three classes of\nchicks are observed with various level of imprinting. Our study shows that the\nconcomitant use of autonomous robots and automated ethograms allows detailed\nand quantitative analysis of behavioural patterns of animals in controlled\nlaboratory experiments.\n", "  We investigate N$_f$ = 1 QCD in external magnetic fields on the lattice. The\nbackground field is introduced by means of the so-called Schrodinger\nfunctional. We adopt standard staggered fermions with constant bare mass $am =\n0.025$ and magnetic fields with constant magnetic flux up to $a^2 e H \\simeq\n2.3562$. We find that the the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration\ntemperatures do not depend on the strength of the applied magnetic field. Our\nmethod allow us to easily study the effects of the external magnetic fields on\nthe QCD thermodynamics. We determine the influences of applied magnetic fields\nto the free energy, pressure, and equation of state of strongly interacting\nmatter.\n", "  The 1-loop partition function of the handle-body solutions in the AdS$_3$\ngravity have been derived some years ago using the heat-kernel and the method\nof images. In the semiclassical limit, such partition function should\ncorrespond to the order $O (c^0)$ part in the partition function of dual\nconformal field theory on the boundary Riemann surface. The higher genus\npartition function could be computed by the multi-point functions in the\nRiemann sphere via sewing prescription. In the large central charge limit, to\nthe leading order of $c$, the multi-point function is further simplified to be\na summation over the product of two-point functions, which may form links. Each\nlink is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy class of the Schottky\ngroup of the Riemann surface. Moreover, the value of a link is determined by\nthe eigenvalue of the element in the conjugate class. This allows us to\nreproduce exactly the gravitational 1-loop partition function. The proof can be\ngeneralized to the higher spin gravity and its dual CFT.\n", "  We study lattice wave functions obtained from the SU(2)$_1$\nWess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. Following Moore and Read's\nconstruction, the Kalmeyer-Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state is defined as\na correlation function of primary fields. By an additional insertion of\nKac-Moody currents, we associate a wave function to each state of the conformal\nfield theory. These wave functions span the complete Hilbert space of the\nlattice system. On the cylinder, we study global properties of the lattice\nstates analytically and correlation functions numerically using a Metropolis\nMonte Carlo method. By comparing short-range bulk correlations, numerical\nevidence is provided that the states with one current operator represent edge\nstates in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the edge states with one\nKac-Moody current of lowest order have a good overlap with low-energy excited\nstates of a local Hamiltonian, for which the Kalmeyer-Laughlin state\napproximates the ground state. For some states, exact parent Hamiltonians are\nderived on the cylinder. These Hamiltonians are SU(2) invariant and nonlocal\nwith up to four-body interactions.\n", "  We propose a fusion formula for AdS/CFT worldsheet boundary S-matrices. We\nshow that, starting from the fundamental Y=0 boundary S-matrix, this formula\ncorrectly reproduces the two-particle bound-state boundary S-matrices.\n", "  Massive type IIA supergravity is shown to admit a consistent truncation on\nthe six-sphere to maximal supergravity in four dimensions with a dyonic ISO(7)\ngauging. We obtain the complete, non-linear embedding of all the $D=4$ fields\ninto the IIA metric and form potentials, and show its consistency. We first\nrewrite the IIA theory in an $\\textrm{SO}(1,3) \\times\n\\textrm{SL}(7)$--covariant way. Then, we employ an ${\\cal N}=8$\nSL(7)--covariant restriction of the $D=4$ tensor hierarchy in order to find the\nfull embedding. The redundant $D=4$ degrees of freedom introduced by the tensor\nhierarchy can be eliminated by writing the embedding in terms of the field\nstrengths and exploiting the restricted duality hierarchy. In particular,\nclosed expressions for the Freund-Rubin term are found using this technique\nwhich reveal a pattern valid for other truncations. Finally, we show that the\npresent ${\\cal N}=8$ truncation of massive IIA on $S^6$ and the ${\\cal N}=2$\ntruncation obtained when $S^6$ is equipped with its nearly-K\\\"ahler structure,\noverlap in the ${\\cal N}=1$, G$_2$--invariant sector of the former.\n", "  The STE-QUEST space mission will perform tests of the gravitational redshift\nin the field of the Sun and the Moon to high precision by frequency comparisons\nof clocks attached to the ground and separated by intercontinental distances.\nIn the absence of Einstein equivalence principle (EP) violation, the redshift\nis zero up to small tidal corrections as the Earth is freely falling in the\nfield of the Sun and Moon. Such tests are thus null tests, allowing to bound\npossible violations of the EP. Here we analyze the Sun/Moon redshift tests\nusing a generic EP violating theoretical framework, with clocks minimally\nmodelled as two-level atoms. We present a complete derivation of the redshift\n(including both GR and non-GR terms) in a realistic experiment such as the one\nenvisaged for STE-QUEST. We point out and correct an error in previous\nformalisms linked to the atom's recoil not being properly taken into account.\n", "  We discuss in detail the constraints on partial compositeness coming from\nflavour and CP violation in the leptonic sector. In a first part we present a\nformulation of partial compositeness in terms of a flavour symmetry group and a\nset of spurions, whose background values specify the symmetry breaking pattern.\nIn such a framework we construct the complete set of dimension-six operators\ndescribing lepton flavour violation and CP violation. By exploiting the\nexisting bounds, we derive limits on the compositeness scale in different\nscenarios, characterised by increasing restrictions on the spurion properties.\nWe confirm that in the most general case the compositeness scale should lie\nwell-above 10 TeV. However, if in the composite sector mass parameters and\nYukawa couplings are universal, such a bound can be significantly lowered,\nwithout necessarily reproducing the case of minimal flavour violation. The most\nsensitive processes are decays of charged leptons either of radiative type or\ninto three charged leptons, muon to electron conversion in nuclei and the\nelectric dipole moment of the electron. In a second part we explicitly compute\nthe Wilson coefficients of the relevant dimension-six operators in the\nso-called two-site model, embodying the symmetry breaking pattern discussed in\nour first part, and we compare the results with those of the general spurion\nanalysis.\n", "  We study the ionization dynamics of Ar clusters exposed to ultrashort\nnear-infrared (NIR) laser pulses for intensities well below the threshold at\nwhich tunnel ionization ignites nanoplasma formation. We find that the emission\nof highly charged ions up to Ar$^{8+}$ can be switched on with unit contrast by\ngenerating only a few seed electrons with an ultrashort extreme ultraviolet\n(XUV) pulse prior to the NIR field. Molecular dynamics simulations can explain\nthe experimental observations and predict a generic scenario where efficient\nheating via inverse bremsstrahlung and NIR avalanching are followed by resonant\ncollective nanoplasma heating. The temporally and spatially well-controlled\ninjection of the XUV seed electrons opens new routes for controlling\navalanching and heating phenomena in nanostructures and solids, with\nimplications for both fundamental and applied laser-matter science.\n", "  Recently, Johansson and Ochirov conjectured the form of a new colour\ndecomposition for QCD tree-level amplitudes. This note provides a proof of that\nconjecture. The proof is based on \"Mario World\" Feynman diagrams, which exhibit\nthe hierarchical Dyck structure previously found to be very useful when dealing\nwith multi-quark amplitudes.\n", "  Relic gravitational waves (RGWs) generated in the early Universe form a\nstochastic GW background, which can be directly probed by measuring the timing\nresiduals of millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we investigate the constraints\non the RGWs and on the inflationary parameters by the observations of current\nand potential future pulsar timing arrays. In particular, we focus on effects\nof various cosmic phase transitions (e.g. $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation, QCD\ntransition and SUSY breaking) and relativistic free-streaming gases (neutrinos\nand dark fluids) in the general scenario of the early Universe, which have been\nneglected in the previous works. We find that the phase transitions can\nsignificantly damp the RGWs in the sensitive frequency range of pulsar timing\narrays, and the upper limits of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ increase by a factor\n$\\sim 2$ for both current and future observations. However, the effects of\nfree-steaming neutrinos and dark fluids are all too small to be detected.\nMeanwhile, we find that, if the effective equation of state $w$ in the early\nUniverse is larger than $1/3$, i.e. deviating from the standard hot big bang\nscenario, the detection of RGWs by pulsar timing arrays becomes much more\npromising.\n", "  The nonlinear evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a popular test\nfor code verification. To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the\nliterature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with\nincreasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and\nseverely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test\nproblem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the\naccuracy of their simulations based on ad-hoc proxies, e.g., the existence of\nsmall-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed Kelvin-Helmholtz\nproblems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. We show that in\nmany cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in\nKelvin-Helmholtz problems. We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution\nusing both Athena, a Godunov code, and Dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code.\nProblems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively\nstraightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump\n(which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behavior and are\nmore computationally challenging. In the latter case, Athena simulations are\nprone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is\nseeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as\nresolution increases. Both Athena and Dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid\nsimulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which\ninduce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results\nhighlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated\nconvergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we\ninclude the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in\nthis paper in machine-readable form.\n", "  We present a catalog of GALEX Near-UV (NUV) and Far-UV (FUV) photometry for\nthe Palomar/MSU and SDSS DR7 spectroscopic M dwarf catalogs. The catalog\ncontains NUV measurements matched to 577 spectroscopically confirmed M dwarfs\nand FUV measurements matched to 150 spectroscopically confirmed M dwarfs. Using\nthese data, we find that NUV and FUV luminosities strongly correlate with\nH{\\alpha} emission, a typical indicator of magnetic activity in M dwarfs. We\nalso examine the fraction of M dwarfs with varying degrees of strong line\nemission at NUV wavelengths. Our results indicate that the frequency of M dwarf\nNUV emission peaks at intermediate spectral types, with at least ~30% of young\nM4-M5 dwarfs having some level of activity. For mid-type M dwarfs, we show that\nNUV emission decreases with distance from the Galactic plane, a proxy for\nstellar age. Our complete matched source catalog is available online.\n", "  A molecular wire containing an emitting molecular center is controllably\nsuspended between the plasmonic electrodes of a cryogenic scanning tunneling\nmicroscope. Passing current through this circuit generates an ultra narrow-line\nemission at an energy of ? 1.5 eV which is assigned to the fluorescence of the\nmolecular center. Control over the linewidth is obtained by progressively\ndetaching the emitting unit from the surface. The recorded spectra also reveal\nseveral vibronic peaks of low intensities that can be viewed as a fingerprint\nof the emitter. Surface-plasmon localized at the tip-sample interface are shown\nto play a major role on both excitation and emission of the molecular excitons.\n", "  We use non-Abelian T-duality to construct new N=1 solutions of type IIA\nsupergravity (and their M-theory lifts) that interpolate between AdS_5\ngeometries. We initiate a study of the holographic interpretation of these\nbackgrounds as RG flows between conformal fixed points. Along the way we give\nan elegant formulation of non-Abelian T-duality when acting on a wide class of\nbackgrounds, including those corresponding to such flows, in terms of their\nSU(2) structure.\n", "  We consider bipartite systems as versatile probes for the estimation of\ntransformations acting locally on one of the subsystems. We investigate what\nresources are required for the probes to offer a guaranteed level of\nmetrological performance, when the latter is averaged over specific sets of\nlocal transformations. We quantify such a performance via the average skew\ninformation, a convex quantity which we compute in closed form for bipartite\nstates of arbitrary dimensions, and which is shown to be strongly dependent on\nthe degree of local purity of the probes. Our analysis contrasts and\ncomplements the recent series of studies focused on the minimum, rather than\nthe average, performance of bipartite probes in local estimation tasks, which\nwas instead determined by quantum correlations other than entanglement. We\nprovide explicit prescriptions to characterize the most reliable states\nmaximizing the average skew information, and elucidate the role of state\npurity, separability and correlations in the classification of optimal probes.\nOur results can help in the identification of useful resources for sensing,\nestimation and discrimination applications when complete knowledge of the\ninteraction mechanism realizing the local transformation is unavailable, and\naccess to pure entangled probes is technologically limited.\n", "  Imaging and spectroscopy at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths are key frontiers in\nastronomy and cosmology. Large area spectral surveys with moderate spectral\nresolution (R=50-200) will be used to characterize large scale structure and\nstar formation through intensity mapping surveys in emission lines such as the\nCO rotational transitions. Such surveys will also be used to study the SZ\neffect, and will detect the emission lines and continuum spectrum of individual\nobjects. WSPEC is an instrument proposed to target these science goals. It is a\nchannelizing spectrometer realized in rectangular waveguide, fabricated using\nconventional high-precision metal machining. Each spectrometer is coupled to\nfree space with a machined feed horn, and the devices are tiled into a 2D array\nto fill the focal plane of the telescope. The detectors will be aluminum\nLumped-Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs). To target the CO lines\nand SZ effect, we will have bands at 135-175 GHz and 190-250 GHz, each\nNyquist-sampled at R~200 resolution. Here we discuss the instrument concept and\ndesign, and successful initial testing of a WR10 (i.e. 90 GHz) prototype\nspectrometer. We recently tested a WR5 (180 GHz) prototype to verify that the\nconcept works at higher frequencies, and also designed a resonant backshort\nstructure that may further increase the optical efficiency. We are making\nprogress towards integrating a spectrometer with a LEKID array and deploying a\nprototype device to a telescope for first light.\n", "  We show that band spectrum of topological insulators can be identified as the\nshape of D-branes in string theory. The identification is based on a relation\nbetween the Berry connection associated with the band structure and the\nADHM/Nahm construction of solitons whose geometric realization is available\nwith D-branes. We also show that chiral and helical edge states are identified\nas D-branes representing a noncommutative monopole.\n", "  The Kondo effect, which originates from the screening of a localized magnetic\nmoment by a spin-spin interaction, is widely observed in non-artificial\nmagnetic materials, artificial quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes. In devices\nbased on quantum dots or carbon nanotubes that target quantum information\napplications, the Kondo effect can be tuned by a gate voltage, a magnetic\nfield, or light. However, the manipulation of the Kondo effect in\nnon-artificial materials has not been thoroughly studied; in particular, the\nartificial creation of the Kondo effect remains unexplored. Per this subject\nstudy, however, a new route for the optical creation of the Kondo effect in the\nnon-artificial material $p$-type semiconductor CeZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$ is presented.\nThe Kondo effect emerges under visible-light illumination of the material by a\ncontinuous-wave laser diode and is ultimately revealed by photoinduced\nelectrical resistivity, which clearly exhibits a logarithmic temperature\ndependency. By contrast, a La-based compound (LaZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$) displays only\nnormal metallic behavior under similar illumination. The photoinduced Kondo\neffect, which occurs at higher temperatures when compared with the Kondo effect\nin artificial systems, provides a potential new range of operation for not only\nquantum information/computation devices but also for operation of magneto-optic\ndevices thereby expanding the range of device applications based on the Kondo\neffect.\n", "  We investigate the prospects of creating broad rotational wave packets by\nmeans of molecular interaction with long sequences of intense femtosecond\npulses. Using state-resolved rotational Raman spectroscopy of oxygen, subject\nto a sequence of more than 20 laser pulses with peak intensities exceeding\n$10^{13}$ W/cm$^{2}$ per pulse, we show that the centrifugal distortion is the\nmain obstacle on the way to reaching high rotational states. We demonstrate\nthat the timing of the pulses can be optimized to partially mitigate the\ncentrifugal limit. The cumulative effect of a long pulse sequence results in\nhigh degree of rotational coherence, which is shown to cause an efficient\nspectral broadening of probe light via cascaded Raman transitions.\n", "  Coherent optical bichromatic forces have been shown to be effective tools for\nrapidly slowing and cooling simple atomic systems. While previous estimates\nsuggest that these forces may also be effective for rapidly decelerating\nmolecules or complex atoms, a quantitative treatment for multilevel systems has\nbeen lacking. We describe detailed numerical modeling of bichromatic forces by\ndirect numerical solution for the time-dependent density matrix in the\nrotating-wave approximation. We describe both the general phenomenology of an\narbitrary few-level system and the specific requirements for slowing and\ncooling on a many-level transition in calcium monofluoride (CaF), one of the\nmolecules of greatest current experimental interest. We show that it should be\npossible to decelerate a cryogenic buffer-gas-cooled beam of CaF nearly to rest\nwithout a repumping laser and within a longitudinal distance of about 1 cm. We\nalso compare a full 16-level simulation for the CaF B$\\leftrightarrow$X system\nwith a simplified numerical model and with a semiquantitative estimate based on\n2-level systems. The simplified model performs nearly as well as the complete\nversion, whereas the 2-level model is useful for making order-of-magnitude\nestimates, but nothing more.\n", "  A survey of the inner Galaxy region of Galactic longitude l in [+15, +50]\ndegree and latitude b in [-4,+4] degree is performed using one-third of the\nHigh Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory operated during its\nconstruction phase. To address the ambiguities arising from unresolved sources\nin the data, we use a maximum likelihood technique to identify point source\ncandidates. Ten sources and candidate sources are identified in this analysis.\nEight of these are associated with known TeV sources but not all have\ndifferential fluxes compatible with previous measurements. Three sources are\ndetected with significances $>5\\,\\sigma$ after accounting for statistical\ntrials, and are associated with known TeV sources.\n", "  The renormalization group (RG) running of the neutrino mass operator is\nrequired for comparing the predictions of neutrino models at high energy with\nthe experimental data at low energies. In the type I seesaw scenario with n_G\nright-handed neutrinos, the RG running is also performed in the effective\ntheories above and between the thresholds given by the masses of the\nright-handed neutrinos. At these thresholds, the effective theories are\nmatched. When calculating the two-loop RG running, the matching has to be\nperformed at the one-loop level. In this work, we calculate the one-loop\nmatching formulae in the MSSM extended by n_G right-handed neutrinos using\nsupergraph techniques. Moreover we present a general formula for one-loop\nmatching of superpotential operators which can readily be applied to any\nsupersymmetric theory where chiral superfields are integrated out.\n", "  Extending the single photon transmission distance is a basic requirement for\nthe implementation of quantum communication on a global scale. In this work we\nreport the single photon exchange from a medium Earth orbit satellite (MEO) at\nmore than 7000 km of slanted distance to the ground station at the Matera Laser\nRanging Observatory. The single photon transmitter was realized by exploiting\nthe corner cube retro-reflectors mounted on the LAGEOS-2 satellite. Long\nduration of data collection is possible with such altitude, up to 43 minutes in\na single passage. The mean number of photons per pulse ({\\mu}sat) has been\nlimited to 1 for 200 seconds, resulting in an average detection rate of 3.0 cps\nand a signal to noise ratio of 1.5. The feasibility of single photon exchange\nfrom MEO satellites paves the way to tests of Quantum Mechanics in moving\nframes and to global Quantum Information.\n", "  We compute the new supersymmetric index of a large class of N=2 heterotic\ncompactifications with torsion, corresponding to principal two-torus bundles\nover warped K3 surfaces with H-flux. Starting from a UV description as a (0,2)\ngauged linear sigma-model with torsion, we use supersymmetric localization\ntechniques to provide an explicit expression of the index as a sum over the\nJeffrey-Kirwan residues of the one-loop determinant. We finally propose a\ngeometrical formula that gives the new supersymmetric index in terms of bundle\ndata, regardless of any particular choice of underlying two-dimensional theory.\n", "  We propose the use of optical lattice clocks operated with fermionic\nalkaline-earth-atoms to study spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in interacting\nmany-body systems. The SOC emerges naturally during the clock interrogation\nwhen atoms are allowed to tunnel and accumulate a phase set by the ratio of the\n\"magic\" lattice wavelength to the clock transition wavelength. We demonstrate\nhow standard protocols such as Rabi and Ramsey spectroscopy, that take\nadvantage of the sub-Hertz resolution of state-of-the-art clock lasers, can\nperform momentum-resolved band tomography and determine SOC-induced $s$-wave\ncollisions in nuclear spin polarized fermions. By adding a second\ncounter-propagating clock beam a sliding superlattice can be implemented and\nused for controlled atom transport and as a probe of $p$ and $s$-wave\ninteractions. The proposed spectroscopic probes provide clean and well-resolved\nsignatures at current clock operating temperatures.\n", "  Three-dimensional gravity coupled to pressureless dust is a field theory with\none local degree of freedom. In the canonical framework, the dust-time gauge\nencodes this physical degree of freedom as a metric function. We find that the\ndynamics of this field, up to spatial diffeomorphism flow, is independent of\nspatial derivatives and is therefore ultralocal. We also derive the linearized\nequations about flat spacetime, and show that the physical degree of freedom\nmay be viewed as either a traceless or a transverse mode.\n", "  We consider several geometric inequalities in general relativity involving\nmass, area, charge, and angular momentum for asymptotically hyperboloidal\ninitial data. We show how to reduce each one to the known maximal (or time\nsymmetric) case in the asymptotically flat setting, whenever a geometrically\nmotivated system of elliptic equations admits a solution.\n", "  The recent completion of Advanced LIGO suggests that gravitational waves\n(GWs) may soon be directly observed. Past searches for gravitational-wave\ntransients have been impacted by transient noise artifacts, known as glitches,\nintroduced into LIGO data due to instrumental and environmental effects. In\nthis work, we explore how waveform complexity, instead of signal-to-noise\nratio, can be used to rank event candidates and distinguish short duration\nastrophysical signals from glitches. We test this framework using a new\nhierarchical pipeline that directly compares the Bayesian evidence of explicit\nsignal and glitch models. The hierarchical pipeline is shown to have strong\nperformance, and in particular, allows high-confidence detections of a range of\nwaveforms at realistic signal-to-noise ratio with a two detector network.\n", "  In quantum field theories with topological sectors, a non-perturbative\nquantity of interest is the topological susceptibility chi_t. In principle it\nseems straightforward to measure chi_t by means of Monte Carlo simulations.\nHowever, for local update algorithms and fine lattice spacings, this tends to\nbe difficult, since the Monte Carlo history rarely changes the topological\nsector. Here we test a method to measure chi_t even if data from only one\nsector are available. It is based on the topological charges in sub-volumes,\nwhich we denote as slabs. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of these charges,\nthis method enables the evaluation of chi_t, as we demonstrate with numerical\nresults for non-linear sigma-models.\n", "  We investigate the motion of a single particle moving on a two-dimensional\nsquare lattice whose sites are occupied by right and left rotators. These left\nand right rotators deterministically rotate the particle's velocity to the\nright or left, respectively and \\emph{flip} orientation from right to left or\nfrom left to right after scattering the particle. We study three types of\nconfigurations of left and right rotators, which we think of as types of media,\nthrough with the particle moves. These are completely random (CR), random\nperiodic (RP), and completely periodic (CP) configurations. For CR\nconfigurations the particle's dynamics depends on the ratio $r$ of right to\nleft scatterers in the following way. For small $r\\simeq0$, when the\nconfiguration is nearly homogeneous, the particle subdiffuses with an exponent\nof 2/3, similar to the diffusion of a macromolecule in a crowded environment.\nAlso, the particle's trajectory has a fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq4/3$,\ncomparable to that of a self-avoiding walk. As the ratio increases to $r\\simeq\n1$, the particle's dynamics transitions from subdiffusion to anomalous\ndiffusion with a fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq 7/4$, similar to that of a\npercolating cluster in 2-d. In RP configurations, which are more structured\nthan CR configurations but also randomly generated, we find that the particle\nhas the same statistic as in the CR case. In contrast, CP configurations, which\nare highly structured, typically will cause the particle to go through a\ntransient stage of subdiffusion, which then abruptly changes to propagation.\nInterestingly, the subdiffusive stage has an exponent of approximately 2/3 and\na fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq4/3$, similar to the case of CR and RP\nconfigurations for small $r$.\n", "  We consider the quantum mechanics of an even number of space indexed\nhermitian matrices. Upon complexification, we show that a closed subsector\nnaturally parametrized by a matrix valued radial coordinate has a description\nin terms of non interacting $s$-state \"radial fermions\" with an emergent De\nAlfaro, Fubini and Furlan type potential, present only for two or more complex\nmatrices. The concomitant $AdS_2$ symmetry is identified. The large $N$\ndescription in terms of the density of radial eigenvalues is also described.\n", "  In arXiv:1407.7580 a mechanism to fix the closed string moduli in a de Sitter\nminimum was proposed: a D-term potential generates a linear relation between\nthe volumes of two rigid divisors which in turn produces at lower energies a\nrace-track potential with de Sitter minima at exponentially large volume. In\nthis paper, we systematically search for implementations of this mechanism\namong all toric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces with $h^{1,1}\\leq 4$ from the\nKreuzer-Skarke list. For these, topological data can be computed explicitly\nallowing us to find the subset of three-folds which have two rigid toric\ndivisors that do not intersect each other and that are orthogonal to\n$h^{1,1}-2$ independent four-cycles. These manifolds allow to find D7-brane\nconfigurations compatible with the de Sitter uplift mechanism and we find an\nabundance of consistent choices of D7-brane fluxes inducing D-terms leading to\na de Sitter minimum. Finally, we work out a couple of models in detail,\nchecking the global consistency conditions and computing the value of the\npotential at the minimum.\n", "  We show that the quantum nature of light can be used to hide a secret message\nwithin a photograph. Using this physical principle we achieve\ninformation-theoretic secure steganography, which had remained elusive until\nnow. The protocol is such that the digital picture in which the secret message\nis embedded is perfectly undistinguishable from an ordinary photograph. This\nimplies that, on a fundamental level, it is impossible to discriminate a\nprivate communication from an exchange of photographs.\n", "  Horndeski gravities are theories of gravity coupled to a scalar field, in\nwhich the action contains an additional non-minimal quadratic coupling of the\nscalar, through its first derivative, to the Einstein tensor or the analogous\nhigher-derivative tensors coming from the variation of Gauss-Bonnet or Lovelock\nterms. In this paper we study the thermodynamics of the static black hole\nsolutions in $n$ dimensions, in the simplest case of a Horndeski coupling to\nthe Einstein tensor. We apply the Wald formalism to calculate the entropy of\nthe black holes, and show that there is an additional contribution over and\nabove those that come from the standard Wald entropy formula. The extra\ncontribution can be attributed to unusual features in the behaviour of the\nscalar field. We also show that a conventional regularisation to calculate the\nEuclidean action leads to an expression for the entropy that disagrees with the\nWald results. This seems likely to be due to ambiguities in the subtraction\nprocedure. We also calculate the viscosity in the dual CFT, and show that the\nviscosity/entropy ratio can violate the $\\eta/S\\ge 1/(4\\pi)$ bound for\nappropriate choices of the parameters.\n", "  We suggest a new type of hill-top inflation originating from the initial\nconditions in the form of the microcanonical density matrix for the\ncosmological model with a large number of quantum fields conformally coupled to\ngravity. Initial conditions for inflation are set up by cosmological instantons\ndescribing underbarrier oscillations in the vicinity of the inflaton potential\nmaximum. These periodic oscillations of the inflaton field and cosmological\nscale factor are obtained within the approximation of two coupled oscillators\nsubject to the slow roll regime in the Euclidean time. This regime is\ncharacterized by rapid oscillations of the scale factor on the background of a\nslowly varying inflaton, which guarantees smallness of slow roll parameters\n$\\epsilon$ and $\\eta$ of the following inflation stage. A hill-like shape of\nthe inflaton potential is shown to be generated by logarithmic loop corrections\nto the tree-level asymptotically shift-invariant potential in the non-minimal\nHiggs inflation model and $R^2$-gravity. The solution to the problem of\nhierarchy between the Planckian scale and the inflation scale is discussed\nwithin the concept of conformal higher spin fields, which also suggests the\nmechanism bringing the model below the gravitational cutoff and, thus,\nprotecting it from large graviton loop corrections.\n", "  We present the finite temperature spectra of both bottomonium and charmonium,\nobtained from a consistent lattice QCD based potential picture. Starting point\nis the complex in-medium potential extracted on full QCD lattices with\ndynamical u,d and s quarks, generated by the HotQCD collaboration. Using the\ngeneralized Gauss law approach, vetted in a previous study on quenched QCD, we\nfit ${\\rm Re}[V]$ with a single temperature dependent parameter $m_D$, the\nDebye screening mass, and confirm the up to now tentative values of ${\\rm\nIm}[V]$. The obtained analytic expression for the complex potential allows us\nto compute quarkonium spectral functions by solving an appropriate\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. These spectra exhibit thermal widths, which are free\nfrom the resolution artifacts that plague direct reconstructions from Euclidean\ncorrelators using Bayesian methods. In the present adiabatic setting, we find\nclear evidence for sequential melting and derive melting temperatures for the\ndifferent bound states. Quarkonium is gradually weakened by both screening\n(${\\rm Re}[V]$) and scattering (${\\rm Im}[V]$) effects that in combination lead\nto a shift of their in-medium spectral features to smaller frequencies,\ncontrary to the mass gain of elementary particles at finite temperature.\n", "  We calculate the mean-field phase diagram of a zero-temperature, binary Bose\nmixture on a square optical lattice, where one species possesses a\nnon-negligible dipole moment. Remarkably, this system exhibits supersolidity\nfor anomalously weak dipolar interaction strengths, which are readily\naccessible with current experimental capabilities. The supersolid phases are\nrobust, in that they occupy large regions in the parameter space. Further, we\nidentify a first-order quantum phase transition between supersolid and\nsuperfluid phases. Our results demonstrate the rich features of the dipolar\nBose mixture, and suggest that this system is well-suited for exploring\nsupersolidity in the experimental setting.\n", "  The existence of quasi-bi-Hamiltonian structures for the Kepler problem is\nstudied. We first relate the superintegrability of the system with the\nexistence of two complex functions endowed with very interesting Poisson\nbracket properties and then we prove the existence of a quasi-bi-Hamiltonian\nstructure by making use of these two functions. The paper can be considered as\ndivided in two parts. In the first part a quasi-bi-Hamiltonian structure is\nobtained by making use of polar coordinates and in the second part a new\nquasi-bi-Hamiltonian structure is obtained by making use of the separability of\nthe system in parabolic coordinates.\n", "  The recent measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and\npolarization anisotropies made by the Planck satellite have provided impressive\nconfirmation of the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. However interesting hints\nof slight deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM have been found, including a $95 \\%$\nc.l. preference for a \"modified gravity\" structure formation scenario. In this\npaper we confirm the preference for a modified gravity scenario from Planck\n2015 data, find that modified gravity solves the so-called $A_{lens}$ anomaly\nin the CMB angular spectrum, and constrains the amplitude of matter density\nfluctuations to $\\sigma_8=0.815_{-0.048}^{+0.032}$, in better agreement with\nweak lensing constraints. Moreover, we find a lower value for the reionization\noptical depth of $\\tau=0.059\\pm0.020$ (to be compared with the value of $\\tau=\n0.079 \\pm 0.017$ obtained in the standard scenario), more consistent with\nrecent optical and UV data. We check the stability of this result by\nconsidering possible degeneracies with other parameters, including the neutrino\neffective number, the running of the spectral index and the amount of\nprimordial helium. The indication for modified gravity is still present at\nabout $95\\%$ c.l., and could become more significant if lower values of $\\tau$\nwere to be further confirmed by future cosmological and astrophysical data.\n", "  We consider a model in which a pseudo-scalar field $\\sigma$ rolls for some\ne-folds during inflation, sourcing one helicity of a gauge field. These fields\nare only gravitationally coupled to the inflaton, and therefore produce scalar\nand tensor primordial perturbations only through gravitational interactions.\nThese sourced signals are localized on modes that exit the horizon while the\nroll of $\\sigma$ is significant. We focus our study on cases in which the model\ncan simultaneously produce (i) a large gravitational wave signal, resulting in\nobservable B-modes of the CMB polarizations, and (ii) sufficiently small scalar\nperturbations, so to be in agreement with the current limits from temperature\nanisotropies. Different choice of parameters can instead lead to a localized\nand visible departure from gaussianity in the scalar sector, either at CMB or\nLSS scales.\n", "  Recent discoveries of circumbinary planets by Kepler mission provide\nmotivation for understanding their birthplaces - protoplanetary disks around\nstellar binaries with separations <1 AU. We explore properties and evolution of\nsuch circumbinary disks focusing on modification of their structure caused by\ntidal coupling to the binary. We develop a set of analytical scaling relations\ndescribing viscous evolution of the disk properties, which are verified and\ncalibrated using 1D numerical calculations with realistic inputs. Injection of\nangular momentum by the central binary suppresses mass accretion onto the\nbinary and causes radial distribution of the viscous angular momentum flux F_J\nto be different from that in a standard accretion disk around a single star\nwith no torque at the center. Disks with no mass accretion at the center\ndevelop F_J profile which is flat in radius. Radial profiles of temperature and\nsurface density are also quite different from those in disks around single\nstars. Damping of the density waves driven by the binary and viscous\ndissipation dominate heating of the inner disk (within 1-2 AU), pushing the\niceline beyond 3-5 AU, depending on disk mass and age. Irradiation by the\nbinary governs disk thermodynamics beyond ~10 AU. However, self-shadowing by\nthe hot inner disk may render central illumination irrelevant out to ~20 AU.\nSpectral energy distribution of a circumbinary disk exhibits a distinctive bump\naround 10 micron, which may facilitate identification of such disks around\nunresolved binaries. Efficient tidal coupling to the disk drives orbital\ninspiral of the binary and may cause low-mass and compact binaries to merge\ninto a single star within the disk lifetime. We generally find that\ncircumbinary disks present favorable sites for planet formation (despite wider\nzone of volatile depletion), in agreement with the statistics of Kepler\ncircumbinary planets.\n", "  A Monte Carlo (MC) study is performed to evaluate the surface tension $\\gamma\n$ of spherical membranes that may be regarded as the models of the lipid\nlayers. We use the canonical surface model defined on the self-avoiding\ntriangulated lattices. The surface tension $\\gamma $ is calculated by keeping\nthe total surface area $A$ constant during the MC simulations. In the\nevaluation of $\\gamma $, we use $A$ instead of the projected area $A_p$, which\nis unknown due to the fluctuation of the spherical surface without boundary.\nThe pressure difference ${\\it\\Delta}p $ between the inner and the outer sides\nof the surface is also calculated by maintaining the enclosed volume constant.\nUsing ${\\it\\Delta}p $ and the Laplace formula, we obtain the tension, which is\nconsidered to be equal to the frame tension $\\tau$ conjugate to $A_p$, and\ncheck whether or not $\\gamma $ is consistent with $\\tau$. We find reasonable\nconsistency between $\\gamma$ and $\\tau$ in the region of sufficiently large\nbending rigidity $\\kappa$ or sufficiently large $A/N$. It is also found that\n$\\tau$ becomes constant in the limit of $A/N\\to \\infty$ both in the tethered\nand fluid surfaces.\n", "  We propose a Lagrangian for the low-energy theory that resides at the\n(1+1)-dimensional intersection of N semi-infinite M2-branes ending orthogonally\non M M5-branes in ${\\mathbb R}^{1,2} \\times {\\mathbb C}^4/{\\mathbb Z}_k$ (for\narbitrary positive integers N,M,k). We formulate this theory as a 2d boundary\ntheory with explicit ${\\cal N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry that contains two\nsuperfields in the bi-fundamental representation of $U(N)\\times U(M)$\ninteracting with the (2+1)-dimensional $U(N)_k\\times U(N)_{-k}$ ABJM\nChern-Simons-matter theory in the bulk. We postulate that the boundary theory\nexhibits in the deep infrared supersymmetry enhancement to ${\\cal N}=(4,2)$, or\n${\\cal N}=(4,4)$ depending on the value of k. Arguments in favor of the\nproposal follow from the study of the open string theory of a U-dual type IIB\nHanany-Witten setup. To formulate the bulk-boundary interactions special care\nis taken to incorporate all the expected boundary effects on gauge symmetry,\nsupersymmetry, and other global symmetries.\n", "  We verify the self-duality of Green-Schwarz supercoset sigma models on AdS$_d\n\\times S^d $ backgrounds (d=2,3,5) under combined bosonic and fermionic\nT-dualities without gauge fixing kappa symmetry. We also prove this property\nfor superstrings on AdS$_d \\times S^d \\times S^d$ (d=2,3) described by\nsupercoset sigma models with the isometries governed by the exceptional Lie\nsupergroups $D(2,1;\\alpha)$ (d=2) and $D(2,1;\\alpha)\\times D(2,1;\\alpha)$\n(d=3), which requires an additional T-dualisation along one of the spheres.\nThen, by taking into account the contribution of non-supercoset fermionic modes\n(up to the second order), we provide evidence for the T-self-duality of the\ncomplete type IIA and IIB Green-Schwarz superstring theory on AdS$_d\\times S^d\n\\times T^{10-2d}$ (d=2,3) backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Finally,\napplying the Buscher-like rules to T-dualising supergravity fields, we prove\nthe T-self-duality of the whole class of the AdS$_d\\times S^d \\times M^{10-2d}$\nsuperbackgrounds with Ramond-Ramond fluxes in the context of supergravity.\n", "  We consider the basic radius changing conformal interface for a free compact\nboson. After investigating different theoretical aspects of this object we\nfocus on the fusion of this interface with conformal boundary conditions. At\nfractions of the self-dual radius there exist exceptional D-branes. It was\nargued in [1] that changing the radius in the bulk induces a boundary RG flow.\nFollowing [2] we conjecture that fusing the basic radius changing interface\n(that changes the radius from a fraction of the self-dual radius) with the\nexceptional boundary conditions gives the boundary condition which is the end\npoint of the RG flow considered in [1]. By studying the fusion singularities we\nrecover RG logarithms and see, in particular instances, how they get resummed\ninto power singularities. We discuss what quantities need to be calculated to\ngain full non-perturbative control over the fusion.\n", "  We present an experimental realization of a quantum digital signature\nprotocol which, together with a standard quantum key distribution link,\nincreases transmission distance to kilometre ranges, three orders of magnitude\nlarger than in previous realizations. The bit-rate is also significantly\nincreased compared with previous quantum signature demonstrations. This work\nillustrates that quantum digital signatures can be realized with optical\ncomponents similar to those used for quantum key distribution, and could be\nimplemented in existing optical fiber networks.\n", "  We discuss constraints imposed by soft limits for effective field theories\narising from symmetry breaking. In particular, we consider those associated\nwith anomalous conformal symmetry as well as duality symmetries in\nsupergravity. We verify these soft theorems for the dilaton effective action\nrelevant for the a-theorem, as well as the one-loop effective action for N=4\nsupergravity. Using the universality of leading transcendental coefficients in\nthe alpha' expansion of string theory amplitudes, we study the matrix elements\nof operator R^4 with half maximal supersymmetry. We construct the non-linear\ncompletion of R^4 that satisfies both single and double soft theorems up to\nseven points. This supports the existence of duality invariant completion of\nR^4.\n", "  We explore the phenomenology of scalar fields in the adjoint representation\nof SM gauge groups. We write a general set of dimension 5 effective operators\nin which SM adjoint scalars couple to pairs of standard model bosons. Using\nthese effective operators, we explore new possible decay channels of a scalar\ncolor octet into a gluon and a Z boson/ gluon and a photon. We recast several\nanalyses from Run I of the LHC to find constraints on an a scalar octet\ndecaying into these channels, and we project the discovery potential of color\noctets in our gluon+photon channel for the 14 TeV run of LHC.\n", "  We report the discovery of 13 confirmed two-image quasar lenses from a\nsystematic search for gravitationally lensed quasars in the SDSS-III Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We adopted a methodology similar to\nthat used in the SDSS Quasar Lens Search (SQLS). In addition to the confirmed\nlenses, we report 11 quasar pairs with small angular separations ($\\lesssim$2\")\nconfirmed from our spectroscopy, which are either projected pairs, physical\nbinaries, or possibly quasar lens systems whose lens galaxies have not yet been\ndetected. The newly discovered quasar lens system, SDSS J1452+4224 at\nzs$\\approx$4.8 is one of the highest redshift multiply imaged quasars found to\ndate. Furthermore, we have over 50 good lens candidates yet to be followed up.\nOwing to the heterogeneous selection of BOSS quasars, the lens sample presented\nhere does not have a well-defined selection function.\n", "  We calculate the energy of the state closest to threshold for two and three\nidentical, spinless particles confined to a cubic spatial volume with periodic\nboundary conditions and with zero total momentum in the finite-volume frame.\nThe calculation is performed in relativistic quantum field theory with\nparticles coupled via a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ interaction, and we work through order\n$\\lambda^3$. The energy shifts begin at ${\\cal O}(1/L^3)$, and we keep\nsubleading terms proportional to $1/L^4$, $1/L^5$ and $1/L^6$. These terms\nallow a non-trivial check of the results obtained from quantization conditions\nthat hold for arbitrary interactions, namely that of L\\\"uscher for two\nparticles and our recently developed formalism for three particles. We also\ncompare to previously obtained results based on non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  We revisit the issue of higher-dimensional counterterms for the N=(1,1)\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in six dimensions using the off-shell\nN=(1,0) and on-shell N=(1,1) harmonic superspace approaches. The second\napproach is developed in full generality and used to solve, for the first time,\nthe N=(1,1) SYM constraints in terms of N=(1,0) superfields. This provides a\nconvenient tool to write explicit expressions for the candidate counterterms\nand other N=(1,1) invariants and may be conducive to proving\nnon-renormalization theorems needed to explain the absence of certain\nlogarithmic divergences in higher-loop contributions to scattering amplitudes\nin N=(1,1) SYM.\n", "  In linear perturbation theory, all information about the growth of structure\nis contained in the Green's function, or equivalently, transfer function. These\nfunctions are generally computed using numerical codes or by phenomenological\nfitting formula anchored in accurate analytic results in the limits of large\nand small scale. Here we present a framework for analytically solving all\nscales, in particular the intermediate scales relevant for the baryon acoustic\noscillations (BAO). We solve for the Green's function and transfer function\nusing spherically-averaged overdensities and the approximation that the density\nof the coupled baryon-photon fluid is constant interior to the sound horizon.\n", "  Elliptic flow (v_2) values for identified particles at midrapidity in Au + Au\ncollisions measured by the STAR experiment in the Beam Energy Scan at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider at sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7--62.4 GeV are presented\nfor three centrality classes. The centrality dependence and the data at\nsqrt{s_{NN}}= 14.5 GeV are new. Except at the lowest beam energies we observe a\nsimilar relative v_2 baryon-meson splitting for all centrality classes which is\nin agreement within 15% with the number-of-constituent quark scaling. The\nlarger v_2 for most particles relative to antiparticles, already observed for\nminimum bias collisions, shows a clear centrality dependence, with the largest\ndifference for the most central collisions. Also, the results are compared with\nA Multiphase Transport Model and fit with a Blast Wave model.\n", "  The presence of magneto-acoustic waves in magnetic structures in the solar\natmosphere is well-documented. Applying the technique of solar\nmagneto-seismology (SMS) allows us to infer the background properties of these\nstructures. Here, we aim to identify properties of the observed\nmagneto-acoustic waves and study the background properties of magnetic\nstructures within the lower solar atmosphere. Using the Dutch Open Telescope\n(DOT) and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instruments, we\ncaptured two series of high-resolution intensity images with short cadence of\ntwo isolated magnetic pores. Combining wavelet analysis and empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD), we determined characteristic periods within the\ncross-sectional (i.e., area) and intensity time series. Then, by applying the\ntheory of linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we identified the mode of these\noscillations within the MHD framework. Several oscillations have been detected\nwithin these two magnetic pores. Their periods range from 3 to 20 minutes.\nCombining wavelet analysis and EMD enables us to confidently find the phase\ndifference between the area and intensity oscillations. From these observed\nfeatures, we concluded that the detected oscillations can be classified as slow\nsausage MHD waves. Further, we determined several key properties of these\noscillations such as the radial velocity perturbation, magnetic field\nperturbation and vertical wavenumber using solar magnetoseismology. The\nestimated range of the related wavenumbers reveals that these oscillations are\ntrapped within these magnetic structures. Our results suggest that the detected\noscillations are standing harmonics, and, this allows us to estimate the\nexpansion factor of the waveguides by employing SMS. The calculated expansion\nfactor ranges from 4-12.\n", "  The current paradigm foresees that relativistic jets are launched as\nmagnetically dominated flows, whose magnetic power is progressively converted\nto kinetic power of of the matter of the jet, until equipartition is reached.\nTherefore, at the end of the acceleration phase, the jet should still carry a\nsubstantial fraction ($\\approx$ half) of its power in the form of a Poynting\nflux. It has been also argued that, in these conditions, the best candidate\nparticle acceleration mechanism is efficient reconnection of magnetic field\nlines, for which it is predicted that magnetic field and accelerated\nrelativistic electron energy densities are in equipartition.Through the\nmodeling of the jet non--thermal emission, we explore if equipartition is\nindeed possible in BL Lac objects, i.e. low-power blazars with weak or absent\nbroad emission lines. We find that one-zone models (for which only one region\nis involved in the production of the radiation we observe) the particle energy\ndensity is largely dominating (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) over the magnetic\none. As a consequence, the jet kinetic power largely exceeds the magnetic\npower. Instead, if the jet is structured (i.e. made by a fast spine surrounded\nby a slower layer), the amplification of the IC emission due to the radiative\ninterplay between the two components allows us to reproduce the emission in\nequipartition conditions.\n", "  We consider two potential non-accelerator signatures of generalizations of\nthe well-studied constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). In\none generalization, the universality constraints on soft supersymmetry-breaking\nparameters are applied at some input scale $M_{in}$ below the grand unification\n(GUT) scale $M_{GUT}$, a scenario referred to as `sub-GUT'. The other\ngeneralization we consider is to retain GUT-scale universality for the squark\nand slepton masses, but to relax universality for the soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking contributions to the masses of the Higgs doublets. As\nwith other CMSSM-like models, the measured Higgs mass requires supersymmetric\nparticle masses near or beyond the TeV scale. Because of these rather heavy\nsparticle masses, the embedding of these CMSSM-like models in a minimal SU(5)\nmodel of grand unification can yield a proton lifetime consistent with current\nexperimental limits, and may be accessible in existing and future proton decay\nexperiments. Another possible signature of these CMSSM-like models is direct\ndetection of supersymmetric dark matter. The direct dark matter scattering rate\nis typically below the reach of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment if $M_{in}$ is\nclose to $M_{GUT}$, but may lie within its reach if $M_{in} \\lesssim 10^{11}$\nGeV. Likewise, generalizing the CMSSM to allow non-universal\nsupersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs offers extensive\npossibilities for models within reach of the LZ experiment that have long\nproton lifetimes.\n", "  We demonstrate that the electronic bandstructure extracted from\nquasi-particle interference spectroscopy [Nat. Phys. 9, 468 (2013)] and the\ntheoretically computed form of the superconducting gaps [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.\n111, 11663 (2014)] can be used to understand the $dI/dV$ lineshape measured in\nthe normal and superconducting state of CeCoIn$_5$ [Nat. Phys. 9, 474 92103)].\nIn particular, the $dI/dV$ lineshape, and the spatial structure of\ndefect-induced impurity states, reflects the existence of multiple\nsuperconducting gaps of $d_{x^2-y^2}$-symmetry. These results strongly support\na recently proposed microscopic origin of the unconventional superconducting\nstate.\n", "  The random energy model (REM) provides a solvable mean-field description of\nthe equilibrium spin glass transition. Its quantum sibling (the QREM), obtained\nby adding a transverse field to the REM, has similar properties and shows a\nspin glass phase for sufficiently small transverse field and temperature. In a\nrecent work, some of us have shown that the QREM further exhibits a many-body\nlocalization - delocalization (MBLD) transition when viewed as a closed quantum\nsystem, evolving according to the quantum dynamics. This phase encloses the\nfamiliar equilibrium spin-glass phase. In this paper we study in detail the\nMBLD transition within the forward-scattering approximation and replica\ntechniques. The predictions for the transition line are in good agreement with\nthe exact diagonalization numerics. We also observe that the structure of the\neigenstates at the MBLD critical point changes continuously with the energy\ndensity, raising the possibility of a family of critical theories for the MBLD\ntransition.\n", "  Measuring the angular clustering of galaxies as a function of redshift is a\npowerful method for extracting information from the three-dimensional galaxy\ndistribution. The precision of such measurements will dramatically increase\nwith ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys. However, these are also\nincreasingly sensitive to observational and astrophysical contaminants. Here,\nwe study the statistical properties of three methods proposed for controlling\nsuch systematics -- template subtraction, basic mode projection, and extended\nmode projection -- all of which make use of externally supplied template maps,\ndesigned to characterise and capture the spatial variations of potential\nsystematic effects. Based on a detailed mathematical analysis, and in agreement\nwith simulations, we find that the template subtraction method in its original\nformulation returns biased estimates of the galaxy angular clustering. We\nderive closed-form expressions that should be used to correct results for this\nshortcoming. Turning to the basic mode projection algorithm, we prove it to be\nfree of any bias, whereas we conclude that results computed with extended mode\nprojection are biased. Within a simplified setup, we derive analytical\nexpressions for the bias and discuss the options for correcting it in more\nrealistic configurations. Common to all three methods is an increased estimator\nvariance induced by the cleaning process, albeit at different levels. These\nresults enable unbiased high-precision clustering measurements in the presence\nof spatially-varying systematics, an essential step towards realising the full\npotential of current and planned galaxy surveys.\n", "  In this work we present a new subtraction method for next-to-leading order\ncalculations that is particularly convenient even when narrow resonances are\npresent. The method is particularly suitable for the implementation of\nnext-to-leading order calculations matched to parton shower generators. It\nallows at the same time for the inclusion of all finite width effects,\nincluding interferences, and for a consistent treatment of resonances in the\nshower approach, preserving the mass of resonances near their peak. We\nimplement our method, in a fully general and automatic way, within the POWHEG\nBOX framework, and illustrate it using as a test case the process of $p p \\to\n\\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu j_b j$, that is dominated by $t$-channel single top production.\n", "  There have been two distinct formalisms of thermodynamics of information: One\nis the measurement-feedback formalism, which concerns bipartite systems with\nmeasurement and feedback processes, and the other is the information reservoir\nformalism, which considers bit sequences as a thermodynamic fuel. In this\npaper, we derive a second-law-like inequality by applying the\nmeasurement-feedback formalism to information reservoirs, which provides a\nstronger bound of extractable work than any other known inequality in the same\nsetup. In addition, we demonstrate that the Mandal-Jarzynski model, which is a\nprominent model of the information reservoir formalism, is equivalent to a\nmodel obtained by the contraction of a bipartite system with autonomous\nmeasurement and feedback. Our results provide a unified view on the\nmeasurement-feedback and the information-reservoir formalisms.\n", "  Significant progress has been made recently in constraining the\nisospin-dependent parameters characterizing the SRC (short-range\ncorrelation)-modified single-nucleon momentum distribution in neutron-rich\nnucleonic matter using both experimental data and microscopic model\ncalculations. Using the constrained single-nucleon momentum distribution in a\nnonlinear relativistic mean field (RMF) model, we study the equation of state\n(EOS) of asymmetric nucleonic matter (ANM), especially the density dependence\nof nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho)$. Firstly, as a test of the\nmodel, the average nucleon kinetic energy extracted recently from\nelectron-nucleus scattering experiments using a neutron-proton dominance model\nis well reproduced by the RMF model incorporating effects of the SRC-induced\nhigh momentum nucleons, while it is significantly under predicted by the RMF\nmodel using a step function for the single-nucleon momentum distribution as in\nfree Fermi gas (FFG) models. Secondly, the kinetic symmetry energy of\nquasi-nucleons is found to be\n$E^{\\rm{kin}}_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho_0)=-16.94\\pm13.66\\,\\rm{MeV}$ which is\ndramatically different from the prediction of\n$E^{\\rm{kin}}_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho_0)\\approx 12.5$ MeV by FFG models at nuclear\nmatter saturation density $\\rho_0=0.16\\,\\rm{fm}^{-3}$. Thirdly, comparing the\nRMF calculations with and without the high momentum nucleons using two sets of\nmodel parameters both reproducing identically all empirically constraints on\nthe EOS of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and the symmetry energy of ANM at\n$\\rho_0$, the SRC-modified single-nucleon momentum distribution is found to\nmake the $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho)$ more concave around $\\rho_0$ by softening it\nsignificantly at both sub-saturation and supra-saturation densities, leading to\nan isospin-dependent incompressibility of ANM in better agreement with existing\nexperimental data.\n", "  The fine tuning of parameters required to reproduce our present day Universe\nsuggests that our Universe may simply be a region within an eternally inflating\nsuper-region. Many other regions beyond our observable Universe would exist\nwith each such region governed by a different set of physical parameters.\nCollision between these regions, if they occur, should leave signatures of\nanisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) but have not been seen. We\nanalyze the spectral properties of masked, foreground-cleaned maps between 100\nand 545 GHz constructed from the Planck dataset. Four distinct $\\sim2-4\\arcdeg$\nregions associated with CMB cold spots show anomalously strong 143 GHz emission\nbut no correspondingly strong emission at either 100 or 217 GHz. The signal to\nnoise of this 143 GHz residual emission is at the $\\gtrsim$6$\\sigma$ level\nwhich reduces to $3.2-5.4\\sigma$ after subtraction of remaining\nsynchrotron/free-free foregrounds. We assess different mechanisms for this\nresidual emission and conclude that although there is a 30\\% probability that\nnoise fluctuations may cause foregrounds to fall within 3$\\sigma$ of the\nexcess, there is less than a 0.5\\% probability that foregrounds can explain all\nthe excess. A plausible explanation is that the collision of our Universe with\nan alternate Universe whose baryon to photon ratio is a factor of $\\sim$4500\nlarger than ours, could produce enhanced Hydrogen Paschen-series emission at\nthe epoch of recombination. Future spectral mapping and deeper observations at\n100 and 217 GHz are needed to mitigate systematics arising from unknown\nGalactic foregrounds and to confirm this unusual hypothesis.\n", "  Compound strong gravitational lensing is a rare phenomenon, but a handful of\nsuch lensed systems are likely to be discovered in forthcoming surveys. In this\nwork, we use a double SIS lens model to analytically understand how the\nproperties of the system impact image multiplicity for the final source. We\nfind that up to six images of a background source can form, but only if the\nsecond lens is multiply imaged by the first and the Einstein radius of the\nsecond lens is comparable to, but does not exceed that of the first. We then\nbuild a model of compound lensing masses in the Universe, using SIE lenses, and\nassess how the optical depth for multiple imaging by a galaxy-galaxy compound\nlens varies with source redshift. For a source redshift of 4, we find optical\ndepths of $6 \\times 10^{-6}$ for multiple imaging and $5 \\times 10^{-8}$ for\nmultiplicity of 6 or greater. We find that extreme magnifications are possible,\nwith magnifications of 100 or more for $6 \\times 10^{-9}$ of $z=10$ sources\nwith 0.1 kpc radii. We show some of the image configurations that can be\ngenerated by compound lenses, and demonstrate that they are qualitatively\ndifferent to those generated by single-plane lenses; dedicated compound lens\nfinders will be necessary if these systems are to be discovered in forthcoming\nsurveys.\n", "  Chimera states, namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior,\nwere previously analyzed in complex networks. However, they have not been\nextensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider the neural network\nof the \\textit{C.elegans} soil worm, organized into six interconnected\ncommunities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed\nto be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with\nchemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the\ncoaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way\nthat chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized\nneurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of\ndesynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to\nthe Kuramoto order parameter $\\rho$, we also employ other measures of\ncoherence, such as the chimera-like $\\chi$ and metastability $\\lambda$ indices,\nwhich quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time,\nrespectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common\nfeatures with the \\textit{C.elegans} neural network. Similar results suggest\nthat under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in\nmodular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex\nmodular networks.\n", "  AdS black holes with hyperbolic horizons provide strong-coupling descriptions\nof thermal CFT states on hyperboloids. The low-temperature limit of these\nsystems is peculiar. In this note we show that, in addition to a large ground\nstate degeneracy, these states also have an anomalously large holographic\ncomplexity, scaling logarithmically with the temperature. We speculate on\nwhether this fact generalizes to other systems whose extreme infrared regime is\nformally controlled by Conformal Quantum Mechanics, such as various instances\nof near-extremal charged black holes.\n", "  We review the progress achieved in extracting the properties of hot and dense\nmatter from relativistic heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion\ncollider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the large hadron collider\n(LHC) at CERN. We focus on bulk properties of the medium, in particular the\nevidence for thermalization, aspects of the equation of state, transport\nproperties, as well as fluctuations and correlations. We also discuss the\nin-medium properties of hadrons with light and heavy quarks, and measurements\nof dileptons and quarkonia. This review is dedicated to the memory of Gerald E.\nBrown.\n", "  We present a new family of asymptotic AdS_3 x S^2 solutions to eleven\ndimensional supergravity compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. They originate\nfrom the backreaction of S^2-wrapped M2-branes, which play a central role in\nthe deconstruction proposal for the microscopic interpretation of the D4-D0\nblack hole entropy. We show that they are free of possible pathologies such as\nclosed timelike curves and discuss their holographic interpretation.\n", "  We study three dimensional systems where the parent metallic state contains a\nloop of Weyl or Dirac points. We introduce the minimal $\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{p}$\nHamiltonian , and discuss its symmetries. Guided by this symmetry analysis, we\nclassify the superconducting instabilities that may arise. For a doped Weyl\nloop material, we argue that - independent of microscopic details - the leading\nsuperconducting instability should be to a fully gapped chiral superconductor\nin three dimensions- an unusual state made possible only by the non-trivial\ntopology of the Fermi surface. This state - which we dub the `meron\nsuperconductor' - is neither fully topological nor fully trivial. Meanwhile, at\nperfect compensation additional states are possible (including some that are\nfully topological), but the leading instability depends on microscopic details.\nWe discuss the influence of disorder on pairing. In the presence of a spin\ndegeneracy (`Dirac loops') still more complex superconducting states can arise,\nincluding a `skyrmion' superconductor with topological properties similar to\nsuperfluid He III-B, which additionally breaks lattice rotation symmetry and\nexhibits nematic order.\n", "  PSR J2129-0429 is a \"redback\" eclipsing millisecond pulsar binary with an\nunusually long 15.2 hour orbit. It was discovered by the Green Bank Telescope\nin a targeted search of unidentified Fermi gamma-ray sources. The pulsar\ncompanion is optically bright (mean $m_R = 16.6$ mag), allowing us to construct\nthe longest baseline photometric dataset available for such a system. We\npresent ten years of archival and new photometry of the companion from LINEAR,\nCRTS, PTF, the Palomar 60-inch, and LCOGT. Radial velocity spectroscopy using\nthe Double-Beam Spectrograph on the Palomar 200-inch indicates that the pulsar\nis massive: $1.74\\pm0.18 M_\\odot$. The G-type pulsar companion has mass\n$0.44\\pm0.04 M_\\odot$, one of the heaviest known redback companions. It is\ncurrently 95\\% Roche-lobe filling and only mildly irradiated by the pulsar. We\nidentify a clear 13.1 mmag yr$^{-1}$ secular decline in the mean magnitude of\nthe companion as well as smaller-scale variations in the optical lightcurve\nshape. This behavior may indicate that the companion is cooling. Binary\nevolution calculations indicate that PSR J2129-0429 has an orbital period\nalmost exactly at the bifurcation period between systems that converge into\ntighter orbits as black widows and redbacks and those that diverge into wider\npulsar--white dwarf binaries. Its eventual fate may depend on whether it\nundergoes future episodes of mass transfer and increased irradiation.\n", "  We derive exact scaling relations for two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamic turbulence in the inertial range of scales. We consider both the\nenergy cascade towards large scales and the enstrophy cascade towards small\nscales. We illustrate these relations by numerical simulations of turbulent\nweakly compressible flows. Intriguingly, the fluid-gravity correspondence\nimplies that the gravitational field in spacetimes with anti-de Sitter\nasymptotics should exhibit similar scaling relations.\n", "  We report on a study that compares the properties of magnetic clouds (MCs)\nduring the first 73 months of solar cycles 23 and 24 in order to understand the\nweak geomagnetic activity in cycle 24. We find that the number of MCs did not\ndecline in cycle 24, although the average sunspot number is known to have\ndeclined by ~40%. Despite the large number of MCs, their geoeffectiveness in\ncycle 24 was very low. The average Dst index in the sheath and cloud portions\nin cycle 24 was -33 nT and -23 nT, compared to -66 nT and -55 nT, respectively\nin cycle 23. One of the key outcomes of this investigation is that the\nreduction in the strength of geomagnetic storms as measured by the Dst index is\na direct consequence of the reduction in the factor VBz (the product of the MC\nspeed and the out-of-the-ecliptic component of the MC magnetic field). The\nreduction in MC-to-ambient total pressure in cycle 24 is compensated for by the\nreduction in the mean MC speed, resulting in the constancy of the dimensionless\nexpansion rate at 1 AU. However, the MC size in cycle 24 was significantly\nsmaller, which can be traced to the anomalous expansion of coronal mass\nejections near the Sun reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2014a). One of the\nconsequences of the anomalous expansion seems to be the larger heliocentric\ndistance where the pressure balance between the CME flux ropes and the ambient\nmedium occurs in cycle 24.\n", "  Classical and quantum superintegrable systems have a long history and they\npossess more integrals of motion than degrees of freedom. They have many\nattractive properties, wide applications in modern physics and connection to\nmany domains in pure and applied mathematics. We overview two new families of\nsuperintegrable Kepler-Coulomb systems with non-central terms and\nsuperintegrable Hamiltonians with double singular oscillators of type $(n,N-n)$\nin $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We present their quadratic and polynomial\nalgebras involving Casimir operators of $so(N+1)$ Lie algebras that exhibit\nvery interesting decompositions $Q(3)\\oplus so(N-1)$, $Q(3)\\oplus so(n)\\oplus\nso(N-n)$ and the cubic Casimir operators. The realization of these algebras in\nterms of deformed oscillator enables the determination of a finite dimensional\nunitary representation. We present algebraic derivations of the degenerate\nenergy spectra of these systems and relate them with the physical spectra\nobtained from the separation of variables.\n", "  We study the equilibrium properties of the one-dimensional disordered\nBose-Hubbard model by means of a gauge-adaptive tree tensor network variational\nmethod suitable for systems with periodic boundary conditions. We compute the\nsuperfluid stiffness and superfluid correlations close to the superfluid to\nglass transition line, obtaining accurate locations of the critical points. By\nstudying the statistics of the exponent of the power-law decay of the\ncorrelation, we determine the boundary between the superfluid region and the\nBose glass phase in the regime of strong disorder and in the weakly interacting\nregion, not explored numerically before. In the former case our simulations are\nin agreement with previous Monte Carlo calculations.\n", "  We investigate interstellar extinction curve variations toward $\\sim$4\ndeg$^{2}$ of the inner Milky Way in $VIJK_{s}$ photometry from the OGLE-III and\n$VVV$ surveys, with supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and\n$F435W,F625W$ photometry. We obtain independent measurements toward $\\sim$2,000\nsightlines of $A_{I}$, $E(V-I)$, $E(I-J)$, and $E(J-K_{s})$, with median\nprecision and accuracy of 2%. We find that the variations in the extinction\nratios $A_{I}/E(V-I)$, $E(I-J)/E(V-I)$ and $E(J-K_{s})/E(V-I)$ are large\n(exceeding 20%), significant, and positively correlated, as expected. However,\nboth the mean values and the trends in these extinction ratios are drastically\nshifted from the predictions of Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how\n$R_{V}$ is varied. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of\nthe extinction curve has at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.\n$R_{V}$), which we conform with a principal component analysis. We derive a\nmedian value of $<A_{V}/A_{Ks}>=13.44$, which is $\\sim$60% higher than the\n\"standard\" value. We show that the Wesenheit magnitude $W_{I}=I-1.61(I-J)$ is\nrelatively impervious to extinction curve variations.\n  Given that these extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology,\nand that it is generally assumed that $R_{V}$ variations correctly capture\nvariations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in the\ndistance ladder from studies of type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may have been\nunderestimated. Moreover, the reddening maps from the Planck experiment are\nshown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by $\\sim$100%, and lack\nsensitivity to extinction curve variations.\n", "  The trace anomaly of conformal field theories in four dimensions is\ncharacterized by '$a$' and '$c$'-functions. The scaling properties of the\neffective action of a CFT in the presence of boundaries is shown to be\ndetermined by $a$, $c$ and two new functions (charges) related to boundary\neffects. The boundary charges are computed for different theories and different\nboundary conditions. One of the boundary charges depends on the bulk $c$\ncharge.\n", "  We consider the perturbative contributions to the R^4, D^4 R^4 and D^6 R^4\ninteractions in toroidally compactified type II string theory. These BPS\ninteractions do not receive perturbative contributions beyond genus three. We\nderive Poisson equations satisfied by these moduli dependent string amplitudes.\nThese T--duality invariant equations have eigenvalues that are completely\ndetermined by the structure of the integrands of the multi--loop amplitudes.\nThe source terms are given by boundary terms of the moduli space of Riemann\nsurfaces corresponding to both separating and non--separating nodes. These are\ndetermined directly from the string amplitudes, as well as from the logarithmic\ndivergences of maximal supergravity. We explicitly solve these Poisson\nequations in nine and eight dimensions.\n", "  Due to nowadays networks' sizes, the evaluation of a community detection\nalgorithm can only be done using quality functions. These functions measure\ndifferent networks/graphs structural properties, each of them corresponding to\na different definition of a community. Since there exists many definitions for\na community, choosing a quality function may be a difficult task, even if the\nnetworks' statistics/origins can give some clues about which one to choose.\n  In this paper, we apply a general methodology to identify different contexts,\ni.e. groups of graphs where the quality functions behave similarly. In these\ncontexts we identify the best quality functions, i.e. quality functions whose\nresults are consistent with expectations from real life applications.\n", "  We consider the problem of determining the initial state of integrable\nquantum field theory quenches in terms of the post-quench eigenstates. The\ncorresponding overlaps are a fundamental input to most exact methods to treat\nintegrable quantum quenches. We construct and examine an infinite integral\nequation hierarchy based on the form factor bootstrap, proposed earlier as a\nset of conditions deter- mining the overlaps. Using quenches of the mass and\ninteraction in Sinh-Gordon theory as a concrete example, we present theoretical\narguments that the state has the squeezed coherent form expected for integrable\nquenches, and supporting an Ansatz for the solution of the hierarchy. Moreover\nwe also develop an iterative method to solve numerically the lowest equation of\nthe hierarchy. The iterative solution along with extensive numerical checks\nperformed using the next equation of the hierarchy provide a strong numerical\nevidence that the proposed Ansatz gives a very good approximation for the\nsolution.\n", "  Via large and small $N_c$ relations we derive nonperturbative results about\nthe conformal window of two-index theories. Using Schwinger-Dyson methods as\nwell as four-loops results we estimate subleading corrections and show that\nnaive large number of colors extrapolations are unreliable when $N_c$ is less\nthan about six. Nevertheless useful nonperturbative inequalities for the size\nof the conformal windows, for any number of colors, can be derived. By further\nobserving that the adjoint conformal window is independent of the number of\ncolors we argue, among other things, that: The large $N_c$ two-index conformal\nwindow is twice the conformal window of the adjoint representation (which can\nbe determined at small $N_c$) expressed in terms of Dirac fermions; Lattice\nresults for adjoint matter can be used to provide independent information on\nthe conformal dynamics of two-index theories such as SU($N_c$) with two and\nfour symmetric Dirac flavors.\n", "  We numerically study a Bose-Hubbard ring of finite size with disorder\ncontaining a finite number of bosons that are subject to an on-site two-body\ninteraction. Our results show that moderate interactions induce dynamical\nthermalization in this isolated system. In this regime the individual many-body\neigenstates are well described by the standard thermal Bose-Einstein\ndistribution for well-defined values of the temperature and the chemical\npotential which depend on the eigenstate under consideration. We show that the\ndynamical thermalization conjecture works well both at positive and negative\ntemperatures. The relations to quantum chaos, quantum ergodicity and to the\nAberg criterion are also discussed.\n", "  The most general parametrization of the $tbW$ vertex includes a right\ncoupling $V_R$ that is zero at tree level in the standard model. This quantity\nmay be measured at the Large Hadron Collider where the physics of the top decay\nis currently investigated. This coupling is present in new physics models at\ntree level and/or through radiative corrections, so its measurement can be\nsensitive to non standard physics. In this paper we compute the leading\nelectroweak and QCD contributions to the top $V_R$ coupling in the standard\nmodel. This value is the starting point in order to separate the standard model\neffects and, then, search for new physics. We also propose observables that can\nbe addressed at the LHC in order to measure this coupling. These observables\nare defined in such a way that they do not receive tree level contributions\nfrom the standard model and are directly proportional to the right coupling.\nBounds on new physics models can be obtained through the measurements of these\nobservables.\n", "  As a means of examining the section condition and its possible solutions and\nrelaxations, we perform twistor transforms related to versions of exceptional\nfield theory with Minkowski signature. The spinor parametrisation of the\nmomenta naturally solves simultaneously both the mass-shell condition and the\n(weak) section condition. It is shown that the incidence relations for\nmulti-particle twistors force them to share a common section, but not to be\northogonal. The supersymmetric extension contains additional scalar fermionic\nvariables shown to be kappa-symmetry invariants. We speculate on some\nimplications, among them a possible relation to higher spin theory.\n", "  We study the semileptonic decay of $\\Lambda_c$ to $\\nu l^+$ and\n$\\Lambda(1405)$, where the $\\Lambda(1405)$ is seen in the invariant mass\ndistribution of $\\pi \\Sigma$. We perform the hadronization of the quarks\nproduced in the reaction in order to have a meson baryon pair in the final\nstate and then let these hadron pairs undergo final state interaction from\nwhere the $\\Lambda(1405)$ is dynamically generated. The reaction is\nparticularly suited to study this resonance because we show that it filters\nI=0. It is also free of tree level $\\pi \\Sigma$ production, which leads to a\nclean signal of the resonance with no background. This same feature has as a\nconsequence that one populates the state of the $\\Lambda(1405)$ with higher\nmass around 1420 MeV, predicted by the chiral unitary approach. We make\nabsolute predictions for the invariant mass distributions and find them within\nmeasurable range in present facilities. The implementation of this reaction\nwould allow us to gain insight into the existence of the predicted two\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ states and their nature as molecular states.\n", "  We analyze the pertubative contributions to the $D^4 R^4$ and $D^6 R^4$\ncouplings in the low-energy effective action of type II string theory\ncompactified on a torus $T^d$, with particular emphasis on two-loop\ncorrections. In general, it is necessary to introduce an infrared cut-off\n$\\Lambda$ to separate local interactions from non-local effects due to the\nexchange of massless states. We identify the degenerations of the genus-two\nRiemann surface which are responsible for power-like dependence on $\\Lambda$,\nand give an explicit prescription for extracting the $\\Lambda$-independent\neffective couplings. These renormalized couplings are then shown to be\neigenmodes of the Laplace operator with respect to the torus moduli, up to\ncomputable anomalous source terms arising in the presence of logarithmic\ndivergences, in precise agreement with predictions from U-duality. Our results\nfor the two-loop $D^6 R^4$ contribution also probe essential properties of the\nKawazumi-Zhang invariant\n", "  Thermodynamic quantities associated with black holes in Anti-de Sitter space\nobey an interesting identity when the cosmological constant is included as one\nof the dynamical variables, the generalized Smarr relation. We show that this\nrelation can easily be understood from the point of view of the dual\nholographic field theory. It amounts to the simple statement that the extensive\nthermodynamic quantities of a large $N$ gauge theory only depend on the number\nof colors, $N$, via an overall factor of $N^2$.\n", "  Recently the Schur index of ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM was evaluated in closed form to\nall orders including exponential corrections in the large $N$ expansion and for\nfixed finite $N$. This was achieved by identifying the matrix model which\ncalculates the index with the partition function of a system of free fermions\non a circle. The index can be enriched by the inclusion of loop operators and\nthe case of Wilson loops is particularly easy, as it amounts to inserting extra\ncharacters into the matrix model. The Fermi-gas approach is applied here to\nthis problem, the formalism is explored and explicit results at large $N$ are\nfound for the fundamental as well as a few other symmetric and antisymmetric\nrepresentations.\n", "  We present a comparison of two methods to compute the momentum spectrum and\nthe Schwinger pair creation rate for pulsed rotating electric fields: one based\nupon the real-time Dirac--Heisenberg--Wigner (DHW) formalism and a\nsemiclassical approximation based on a scattering ansatz. For the semiclassical\nmethod we propose to either perform numerical calculations or an additional\napproximation based on an analytical solution for the constant rotating field.\nWe find that both numerical methods are complementary with respect to\ncomputation time as well as accuracy. The approximate method shows the same\nqualitative features while being computationally much faster. We additionally\nfind that the unequal production of pairs in different spin states reported for\nconstant rotating fields with the scattering method is in agreement with the\nWigner function method.\n", "  We exactly compute the partition function for $U(2)_k\\times U(2)_{-k}$ ABJM\ntheory on $\\mathbb S^3$ deformed by mass $m$ and Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter\n$\\zeta $. For $k=1,2$, the partition function has an infinite number of\nLee-Yang zeros. For general $k$, in the decompactification limit the theory\nexhibits a quantum (first-order) phase transition at $m=2\\zeta $.\n", "  We study the dynamic changes of electron energy distribution (EED) through\nsystematically analysing the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 in different states. With\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique we model fourteen SEDs of 3C 279\nusing a leptonic model with a three-parameter log-parabola electron energy\ndistribution (EED). The 14 SEDs can be satisfactorily fitted with the one-zone\nleptonic model. The observed $\\gamma$ rays in 13 states are attributed to\nCompton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty torus.\nThe curved $\\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during 2-8 April 2014 is well\nexplained by the external Compton of dust radiation. It is found that there is\na clear positive correlation between the curvature parameter $b$ of the EED and\nthe electron peak energy $\\gamma'_{\\rm pk}$. No clear correlation between $b$\nand the synchrotron peak frequency $\\nu_{\\rm s}$ is found, due to the varied\nproduct of Doppler factor and fluid magnetic field from state to state. We\ninterpret the correlation of $b-\\gamma'_{\\rm pk}$ in a stochastic acceleration\nscenario. This positive correlation is in agreement with the prediction in the\nstage when the balance between acceleration and radiative cooling of the\nelectrons is nearly established in the case of the turbulence spectral index\n$q=2$.\n", "  We study the $\\bar B^0_s \\to J/\\psi K^+ K^-$, $\\bar B^0 \\to J/\\psi K^+ K^-$,\n$B^- \\to J/\\psi K^0 K^-$, $\\bar B^0 \\to J/\\psi \\pi^0 \\eta$ and $B^- \\to J/\\psi\n\\pi^- \\eta$ decays and compare their mass distributions with those obtained for\nthe $\\bar B^0_s \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and $\\bar B^0 \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+ \\pi^-$.\nThe approach followed consist in a factorization of the weak part and the\nhadronization part into a factor which is common to all the processes. Then\nwhat makes the reactions different are some trivial Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix elements and the weight by which the different pairs of mesons appear in\na primary step plus their final state interaction. These elements are part of\nthe theory and thus, up to a global normalization factor, all the invariant\nmass distributions are predicted with no free parameters. Comparison is made\nwith the limited experimental information available. Further comparison of\nthese results with coming LHCb measurements will be very valuable to make\nprogress in our understanding of the meson-meson interaction and the nature of\nthe low lying scalar meson resonances, $f_0(500), f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$.\n", "  The generalized CP transformations can only be consistently defined in the\ncontext of $\\Delta(3n^2)$ lepton symmetry if a certain subset of irreducible\nrepresentations are present in a model. We perform a comprehensive analysis of\nthe possible automorphisms and the corresponding CP transformations of the\n$\\Delta(3n^2)$ group. It is sufficient to only consider three automorphisms if\n$n$ is not divisible by 3 while additional eight types of CP transformations\ncould be imposed for the case of $n$ divisible by 3. We study the lepton mixing\npatterns which can be derived from the $\\Delta(3n^2)$ family symmetry and\ngeneralized CP in the semi-direct approach. The PMNS matrix is determined to be\nthe trimaximal pattern for all the possible CP transformations, and it can only\ntake two distinct forms.\n", "  An Abelian gauge theory describing dynamics of massive spin one bosons is\nconstructed. This is achieved by appending to the Maxwell action, a gauge\ninvariant mass term. The theory is quantised in temporal as well as Lorentz\ngauge, and the corresponding Hilbert spaces are constructed. In both the\ngauges, it is found that, the theory respects Lorentz invariance, locality,\ncausality and unitarity.\n", "  A possible solution of the notorious sign problem preventing direct Monte\nCarlo calculations for systems with non-zero chemical potential is to deform\nthe integration region in the complex plane to a Lefschetz thimble. We\ninvestigate this approach for a simple fermionic model. We introduce an easy to\nimplement Monte Carlo algorithm to sample the dominant thimble. Our algorithm\nrelies only on the integration of the gradient flow in the numerically stable\ndirection, which gives it a distinct advantage over the other proposed\nalgorithms. We demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the algorithm by\napplying it to an exactly solvable fermionic model and compare our results with\nthe analytical ones. We report a very good agreement for a certain region in\nthe parameter space where the dominant contribution comes from a single\nthimble, including a region where standard methods suffer from a severe sign\nproblem. However, we find that there are also regions in the parameter space\nwhere the contribution from multiple thimbles is important, even in the\ncontinuum limit.\n", "  Solutions to the strong CP problem typically introduce new scales associated\nwith the spontaneous breaking of symmetries. Absent any anthropic argument for\nsmall $\\bar\\theta$, these scales require stabilization against ultraviolet\ncorrections. Supersymmetry offers a tempting stabilization mechanism, since it\ncan solve the \"big\" electroweak hierarchy problem at the same time. One family\nof solutions to strong CP, including generalized parity models, heavy axion\nmodels, and heavy $\\eta^\\prime$ models, introduces $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ copies of\n(part of) the Standard Model and an associated scale of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking. We review why, without additional structure such as\nsupersymmetry, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking scale is unacceptably tuned. We then\nstudy \"SUZ$_2$\" models, supersymmetric theories with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ copies of\nthe MSSM. We find that the addition of SUSY typically destroys the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ protection of $\\bar\\theta=0$, even at tree level, once SUSY and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are broken. In theories like supersymmetric completions of the\ntwin Higgs, where $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ addresses the little hierarchy problem but not\nstrong CP, two axions can be used to relax $\\bar\\theta$.\n", "  The ATLAS collaboration (and also CMS) has recently reported an excess over\nStandard Model expectations for gauge boson pair production in the invariant\nmass region $1.8-2.2$ TeV. In the light of these results, we argue that such\nsignal might be the first manifestation of the production and further decay of\na heavy CP-even Higgs resulting from a type-I Two Higgs Doublet Model. We\ndemonstrate that in the presence of colored vector-like fermions, its gluon\nfusion production cross-section is strongly enhanced, with the enhancement\ndepending on the color representation of the new fermion states. Our findings\nshow that barring the color triplet case, any QCD \"exotic\" representation can\nfit the ATLAS result in fairly large portions of the parameter space. We have\nfound that if the diboson excess is confirmed and this mechanism is indeed\nresponsible for it, then the LHC Run-2 should find: (i) a CP-odd scalar with\nmass below $\\sim 2.3$ TeV, (ii) new colored states with masses below $\\sim 2$\nTeV, (iii) no statistically significant diboson events in the $W^\\pm Z$\nchannel, (iv) events in the triboson channels $W^\\pm W^\\mp\\,Z$ and $ZZZ$ with\ninvariant mass amounting to the mass of the CP-odd scalar.\n", "  Employing the covariant formalism, we derive the evolution equations for two\nscalar fields with non-canonical field space metric up to third order in\nperturbation theory. These equations can be used to derive predictions for\nlocal bi- and trispectra of multi-field cosmological models. Our main\napplication is to ekpyrotic models in which the primordial curvature\nperturbations are generated via the non-minimal entropic mechanism. In these\nmodels, nearly scale-invariant entropy perturbations are generated first due to\na non-minimal kinetic coupling between two scalar fields, and subsequently\nthese perturbations are converted into curvature perturbations. Remarkably, the\nentropy perturbations have vanishing bi- and trispectra during the ekpyrotic\nphase. However, as we show, the conversion process to curvature perturbations\ninduces local non-Gaussianity parameters $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ at levels that\nshould be detectable by near-future observations. In fact, in order to obtain a\nlarge enough amplitude and small enough bispectrum of the curvature\nperturbations, as seen in current measurements, the conversion process must be\nvery efficient. Interestingly, for such efficient conversions the trispectrum\nparameter $g_{NL}$ remains negative and typically of a magnitude ${\\cal\nO}(10^2) - {\\cal O}(10^3),$ resulting in a distinguishing feature of\nnon-minimally coupled ekpyrotic models.\n", "  The low-temperature electronic phase diagram of\nBa$_{1-x}$Na$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, obtained using high-resolution\nthermal-expansion and specific-heat measurements, is shown to be considerably\nmore complex than previously reported, containing nine different phases.\nBesides the magnetic $C_{2}$ and reentrant $C_{4}$ phases, we find evidence for\nan additional, presumably magnetic, phase below the usual SDW transition, as\nwell as a possible incommensurate magnetic phase. All these phases coexist and\ncompete with superconductivity, which is particularily strongly suppressed by\nthe $C_{4}$-magnetic phase due to a strong reduction of the electronic entropy\navailable for pairing in this phase.\n", "  In this work, we calculate leading-order anomalous dimension matrices for\ndimension-6 four-quark operators which appear in the operator product expansion\nof flavour non-diagonal and diagonal vector and axial-vector two-point\ncorrelation functions. The infrared renormalon structure corresponding to\nfour-quark operators is reviewed and it is investigated how the eigenvalues of\nthe anomalous dimension matrices influence the singular behaviour of the $u=3$\ninfrared renormalon pole. It is found that compared to the large-$\\beta_0$\napproximation where at most quadratic poles are present, in full QCD at $N_f=3$\nthe most singular pole is more than cubic with an exponent $\\kappa\\approx 3.2$.\n", "  The circular photon drag effect is observed in a bulk semiconductor. The\nphotocurrent caused by a transfer of both translational and angular momenta of\nlight to charge carriers is detected in tellurium in the mid-infrared frequency\nrange. Dependencies of the photocurrent on the light polarization and on the\nincidence angle agree with the symmetry analysis of the circular photon drag\neffect. Microscopic models of the effect are developed for both intra- and\ninter-subband optical absorption in the valence band of tellurium. The shift\ncontribution to the circular photon drag current is calculated. An observed\ndecrease of the circular photon drag current with increase of the photon energy\nis explained by the theory for inter-subband optical transitions. Theoretical\nestimates of the circular photon drag current agree with the experimental data.\n", "  We describe HEROIC, an upgraded version of the relativistic radiative\npost-processor code HERO described in a previous paper, but which now Includes\nComptonization. HEROIC models Comptonization via the Kompaneets equation, using\na quadratic approximation for the source function in the short characteristics\nradiation solver. It employs a simple form of accelerated lambda iteration to\nhandle regions of high scattering opacity. In addition to solving for the\nradiation field, HEROIC also solves for the gas temperature by applying the\ncondition of radiative equilibrium. We present benchmarks and tests of the\nComptonization module in HEROIC with simple 1D and 3D scattering problems. We\nalso test the ability of the code to handle various relativistic effects using\nmodel atmospheres and accretion flows in a black hole space-time. We present\ntwo applications of HEROIC to general relativistic MHD simulations of accretion\ndiscs. One application is to a thin accretion disc around a black hole. We find\nthat the gas below the photosphere in the multi-dimensional HEROIC solution is\nnearly isothermal, quite different from previous solutions based on 1D plane\nparallel atmospheres. The second application is to a geometrically thick\nradiation-dominated accretion disc accreting at 11 times the Eddington rate.\nThe multi-dimensional HEROIC solution shows that, for observers who are on axis\nand look down the polar funnel, the isotropic equivalent luminosity could be\nmore than ten times the Eddington limit, even though the spectrum might still\nlook thermal and show no signs of relativistic beaming.\n", "  We derive a time-domain mean-field equation to model the full temporal and\nspectral dynamics of light in singly resonant cavity-enhanced second-harmonic\ngeneration systems. We show that the temporal walk-off between the fundamental\nand the second-harmonic fields plays a decisive role under realistic\nconditions, giving rise to rich, previously unidentified nonlinear behaviour.\nThrough linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, we discover a new\nkind of quadratic modulation instability which leads to the formation of\noptical frequency combs and associated time-domain dissipative structures. Our\nnumerical simulations show excellent agreement with recent experimental\nobservations of frequency combs in quadratic nonlinear media [Phys. Rev. A 91,\n063839 (2015)]. Thus, in addition to unveiling a new, experimentally accessible\nregime of nonlinear dynamics, our work enables predictive modeling of frequency\ncomb generation in cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation systems.\n", "  The X-ray source RX J2015.6+3711 was discovered by ROSAT in 1996 and recently\nproposed to be a cataclysmic variable (CV). Here we report on an XMM-Newton\nobservation of RX J2015.6+3711 performed in 2014, where we detected a coherent\nX-ray modulation at a period of 7196+/-11 s, and discovered other significant\n(>6sigma) small-amplitude periodicities which we interpret as the CV spin\nperiod and the sidebands of a possible ~12 hr periodicity, respectively. The\n0.3-10 keV spectrum can be described by a power law (Gamma = 1.15+/-0.04) with\na complex absorption pattern, a broad emission feature at 6.60+/-0.01 keV, and\nan unabsorbed flux of (3.16+/-0.05)x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2. We observed a\nsignificant spectral variability along the spin phase, which can be ascribed\nmainly to changes in the density of a partial absorber and the power law\nnormalization. Archival X-ray observations carried out by the Chandra\nsatellite, and two simultaneous X-ray and UV/optical pointings with Swift,\nrevealed a gradual fading of the source in the soft X-rays over the last 13\nyears, and a rather stable X-ray-to-optical flux ratio (F_X/F_V ~1.4-1.7).\nBased on all these properties, we identify this source with a magnetic CV, most\nprobably of the intermediate polar type. The 2 hr spin period makes RX\nJ2015.6+3711 the second slowest rotator of the class, after RX J0524+4244\n(\"Paloma\", P_spin~2.3 hr). Although we cannot unambiguously establish the true\norbital period with these observations, RX J2015.6+3711 appears to be a key\nsystem in the evolution of magnetic CVs.\n", "  Rational CFT's are classified by an integer $\\ell$, the number of zeroes of\nthe Wronskian of their characters in moduli space. For $\\ell=0$ they satisfy\nnon-singular modular-invariant differential equations, while for $\\ell>0$ the\ncorresponding equations have singularities. We survey CFT's with two characters\nand $\\ell=0,2,3,4$ and verify the consistency, at the level of characters, of\nsome candidate theories with $\\ell\\ne 0$. For $\\ell=2$ there are seven\nconsistents sets of characters. We identify specific combinations of level-1\ncurrent algebras that are potential symmetries of the corresponding CFT's.\n", "  BosonSampling is an intermediate model of quantum computation where\nlinear-optical networks are used to solve sampling problems expected to be hard\nfor classical computers. Since these devices are not expected to be universal\nfor quantum computation, it remains an open question of whether any\nerror-correction techniques can be applied to them, and thus it is important to\ninvestigate how robust the model is under natural experimental imperfections,\nsuch as losses and imperfect control of parameters. Here we investigate the\ncomplexity of BosonSampling under photon losses---more specifically, the case\nwhere an unknown subset of the photons are randomly lost at the sources. We\nshow that, if $k$ out of $n$ photons are lost, then we cannot sample\nclassically from a distribution that is $1/n^{\\Theta(k)}$-close (in total\nvariation distance) to the ideal distribution, unless a\n$\\text{BPP}^{\\text{NP}}$ machine can estimate the permanents of Gaussian\nmatrices in $n^{O(k)}$ time. In particular, if $k$ is constant, this implies\nthat simulating lossy BosonSampling is hard for a classical computer, under\nexactly the same complexity assumption used for the original lossless case.\n", "  We propose a model intended to qualitatively capture the electron-electron\ninteraction physics of two-dimensional electron gases formed near\ntransition-metal oxide heterojunctions containing $t_{2g}$ electrons with a\ndensity much smaller than one electron per metal atom. Two-dimensional electron\nsystems of this type can be described perturbatively using a $GW$ approximation\nwhich predicts that Coulomb interactions enhance quasiparticle effective masses\nmore strongly than in simple two-dimensional electron gases, and that they\nreshape the Fermi surface, reducing its anisotropy.\n", "  We use photometry in the F220W, F250W, F330W, F435W filters from the High\nResolution Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys and photometry in the\nF555W, F675W, and F814W filters from the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2\naboard the Hubble Space Telescope to derive individual stellar reddenings and\nextinctions for stars in the HD 97950 cluster in the giant HII region NGC 3603.\nThe mean line-of-sight reddening for about a hundred main-sequence member stars\ninside the cluster is $E(F435W-F555W)=1.33\\pm0.12$ mag. After correcting for\nforeground reddening, the total to selective extinction ratio is\n$R_{F555W}=3.75\\pm0.87$ in the cluster. Within the standard deviation\nassociated with $E(\\rm \\lambda-F555W)/E(F435W-F555W)$ in each filter, the\ncluster extinction curve at ultraviolet wavelengths tends to be greyer than the\naverage Galactic extinction laws from Cardelli et al. (1989) and Fitzpatrick et\nal. (1999). It is closer to the extinction law derived by Calzetti et al.\n(2000) for starburst galaxies, where the 0.2175 $\\rm \\mu m$ bump is absent.\nThis indicates an anomalous extinction in the HD 97950 cluster, which may due\nto the clumpy dust distribution within the cluster, and the size of dust grains\nbeing larger than the average Galactic ISM.\n", "  (Abridged) The chemical behaviour of an ample sample of PNe in NGC6822 is\nanalyzed. Spectrophotometric data of 11 PNe and two H II regions were obtained\nwith the OSIRIS spectrograph attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Data for\nother 13 PNe and three H II regions were retrieved from the literature.\nPhysical conditions and chemical abundances of O, N, Ne, Ar and S were derived\nfor 19 PNe and 4 H II regions. Abundances in the PNe sample are widely\ndistributed showing 12+log(O/H) from 7.4 to 8.2 and 12+log(Ar/H) from 4.97 to\n5.80. Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities\nsimilar to the values of H II regions. The old objects are distributed in a\nlarger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was\nfound to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity. In\naddition, about 60% of the sample presents high ionization (He++/He >= 0.1),\npossessing a central star with effective temperature larger than 10^6 K.\nPossible biases in the sample are discussed. From comparison with stellar\nevolution models by A. Karakas's group of the observed N/O abundance ratios,\nour PNe should have had initial masses lower than 4 M_sun, although if the\ncomparison is made with Ne vs. O abundances, the initial masses should have\nbeen lower than 2 M_sun. It appears that these models of stars of 2-3 M_sun are\nproducing too much 22Ne in the stellar surface at the end of the AGB. On the\nother hand, the comparison with another set of stellar evolution models by P.\nVentura's group with a different treatment of convection and on the assumptions\nconcerning the overshoot of the convective core during the core H-burning\nphase, provided a reasonable agreement between N/O and Ne/H observed and\npredicted ratios if initial masses of more massive stars are of about 4 M_sun.\n", "  Interactions between different bound states in bosonic systems can lead to\npair creation. We study this process in detail by solving the Klein-Gordon\nequation on space-time grids in the framework of time-dependent quantum field\ntheory. By choosing specific external field configurations, two bound states\ncan become pseudodegenerate, which is commonly referred to as the\nSchiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect. These pseudodegenerate bound states, which have\ncomplex energy eigenvalues, are related to the pseudo-Hermiticity of the\nKlein-Gordon Hamiltonian. In this work, the influence of the\nSchiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect on pair production is studied. A generalized\nSchiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect, where several pairs of pseudodegenerate states\nappear, is found in combined electric and magnetic fields. The generalized\nSchiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect likewise triggers pair creation. The particle\nnumber in these situations obeys an exponential growth law in time enhancing\nthe creation of bosons, which cannot be found in fermionic systems.\n", "  It is known that the Fresnel wave surfaces of transparent biaxial media have\n4 singular points, located on two special directions. We show that, in more\ngeneral media, the number of singularities can exceed 4. In fact, a highly\nsymmetric linear material is proposed whose Fresnel surface exhibits 16\nsingular points. Because, for every linear material, the dispersion equation is\nquartic, we conclude that 16 is the maximum number of isolated singularities.\nThe identity of Fresnel and Kummer surfaces, which holds true for media with a\ncertain symmetry (zero skewon piece), provides an elegant interpretation of the\nresults. We describe a metamaterial realization for our linear medium with 16\nsingular points. It is found that an appropriate combination of metal bars,\nsplit-ring resonators, and magnetized particles can generate the correct\npermittivity, permeability, and magnetoelectric moduli. Lastly, we discuss the\narrangement of the singularities in terms of Kummer's (16,6)-configuration of\npoints and planes. An investigation parallel to ours, but in linear elasticity,\nis suggested for future research.\n", "  Minimizing decoherence due to coupling of a quantum system to its fluctuating\nenvironment is at the forefront of quantum information science and photonics\nresearch. Nature sets the ultimate limit, however, given by the strength of the\nsystem's coupling to the electromagnetic field. Here, we establish the ability\nto electronically control this coupling and $\\textit{enhance}$ the coherence\ntime of a quantum dot excitonic state. Coherence control is demonstrated on the\npositively charged exciton transition (an electron Coulomb-bound with two\nholes) in quantum dots embedded in a photonic waveguide by manipulating the\nelectron and hole wavefunctions through an applied lateral electric field. With\nincreasing field up to 15 kV cm$^{-1}$, the coherence time increases by a\nfactor of two from $\\sim1.4$ ns to $\\sim2.7$ ns. Numerical calculations reveal\nthat longer coherence arises from the separation of charge carriers by up to\n$\\sim6$ nm, which leads to a $30\\%$ weaker transition dipole moment. The\nability to electrostatically control the coherence time and transition dipole\nmoment opens new avenues for quantum communication and novel coupling schemes\nbetween distant qubits.\n", "  Supernova \"Refsdal,\" multiply imaged by cluster MACSJ1149.5+2223, represents\na rare opportunity to make a true blind test of model predictions in\nextragalactic astronomy, on a time scale that is short compared to a human\nlifetime. In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven\ngravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive\nspectroscopic follow-up observations by HST, the Very Large and the Keck\nTelescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree\nreasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between\nthe known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This\nagreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical\nuncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as\nstructure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We\nthen present the model predictions for the other appearances of SN \"Refsdal.\" A\nfuture image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image\nappeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be\ndetected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately\none third as bright as the brightest known image (i.e., H_AB~25.7 mag at peak\nand H_AB~26.7 mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit\nHST images. We will find out soon whether our predictions are correct.\n", "  We describe a stabilization mechanism for fuzzy $S^4_N$ in the Euclidean IIB\nmatrix model due to vacuum energy in the presence of a positive mass term. The\none-loop effective potential for the radius contains an attractive contribution\nattributed to supergravity, while the mass term induces a repulsive\ncontribution for small radius due to SUSY breaking. This leads to a\nstabilization of the radius. The mechanism should be pertinent to recent\nresults on the genesis of 3+1-dimensional space-time in the Minkowskian IIB\nmodel.\n", "  We consider the effects of impurities on topological insulators and\nsuperconductors. We start by identifying the general conditions under which the\neigenenergies of an arbitrary Hamiltonian H belonging to one of the\nAltland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes undergo a robust zero energy crossing as a\nfunction of an external parameter which can be, for example, the impurity\nstrength. We define a generalized root of \\det H, and use it to predict or rule\nout robust zero-energy crossings in all symmetry classes. We complement this\nresult with an analysis based on almost degenerate perturbation theory, which\nallows a derivation of the asymptotic low-energy behavior of the ensemble\naveraged density of states $\\rho \\sim E^\\alpha$ for all symmetry classes, and\nmakes it transparent that the exponent \\alpha\\ does not depend on the choice of\nthe random matrix ensemble. Finally, we show that a lattice of impurities can\ndrive a topologically trivial system into a nontrivial phase, and in particular\nwe demonstrate that impurity bands carrying extremely large Chern numbers can\nappear in different symmetry classes of two-dimensional topological insulators\nand superconductors. We use the generalized root of \\det H(k) to reveal a\nspiderweblike momentum space structure of the energy gap closings that separate\nthe topologically distinct phases in p_x + i p_y superconductors in the\npresence of an impurity lattice.\n", "  We extend the perturbative QCD formalism including the Glauber gluons, which\nhas been shown to accommodate the measured $B \\to \\pi \\pi$ and $B^0\\to\\rho^0\n\\rho^0$ branching ratios simultaneously, to the analysis of the $B \\to K \\pi$\nand $K \\bar K$ decays. It is observed that the convolution of the universal\nGlauber phase factors with the transverse-momentum-dependent kaon wave function\nreveals weaker (stronger) Glauber effects than in the pion ($\\rho$ meson) case\nas expected. Our predictions for the branching ratios and the direct CP\nasymmetries of the $B \\to K \\pi$ and $K \\bar K$ modes at next-to-leading-order\naccuracy agree well with data. In particular, the predicted difference of the\n$B^\\pm \\to K^\\pm \\pi^0$ and $B^0 \\to K^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$ direct CP asymmetries,\n$\\Delta A_{K\\pi}\\equiv A_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(K^\\pm \\pi^0)[0.021 \\pm 0.016] -\nA_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(K^\\pm \\pi^\\mp)[-0.081 \\pm 0.017] = 0.102 \\pm 0.023$, is\nconsistent with the measured $\\Delta A_{K\\pi} = 0.119 \\pm 0.022$ within\nuncertainties, and the known $B \\to K\\pi$ puzzle is resolved. The above $B \\to\n\\pi \\pi$, $K\\pi$ and $K \\bar K$ studies confirm that the Glauber gluons\nassociated with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons enhance the color-suppressed tree\namplitude significantly, but have a small impact on other topological\namplitudes.\n", "  We study the structure of the galaxy cluster Abell 523 (A523) at z=0.104\nusing new spectroscopic data for 132 galaxies acquired at the Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo, new photometric data from the Isaac Newton Telescope, and\nX-ray and radio data from the Chandra and Very Large Array archives. We\nestimate the velocity dispersion of the galaxy population, sigmaV=949 km/s, and\nthe X-ray temperature of the hot intracluster medium, kT=5.3 keV. We infer that\nA523 is a massive system: M200 about 7-9 x10E14 Msun. The analysis of the\noptical data confirms the presence of two subclusters, 0.75 Mpc apart, tracing\nthe SSW-NNE direction and dominated by the two brightest cluster galaxies (BCG1\nand BCG2). The X-ray surface brightness is strongly elongated towards the NNE\ndirection, and its peak is clearly offset from both the BCGs. We confirm the\npresence of a 1.3 Mpc large radio halo, elongated in the ESE-WNW direction and\nperpendicular to the optical/X-ray elongation. We detect a significant\nradio/X-ray offset and radio polarization, two features which might be the\nresult of a magnetic field energy spread on large spatial scales. A523 is found\nconsistent with most scaling relations followed by clusters hosting radio\nhaloes, but quite peculiar in the Pradio-LX relation: it is underluminous in\nthe X-rays or overluminous in radio. A523 can be described as a binary head--on\nmerger caught after a collision along the SSW-NNE direction. However, minor\noptical and radio features suggest a more complex cluster structure, with A523\nforming at the crossing of two filaments along the SSW-NNE and ESE-WNW\ndirections.\n", "  Massive stars shape their surroundings with mass loss from winds during their\nlifetimes. Fast ejecta from supernovae, from these massive stars, shocks this\ncircumstellar medium. Emission generated by this interaction provides a window\ninto the final stages of stellar evolution, by probing the history of mass loss\nfrom the progenitor. Here we use Chandra and Swift x-ray observations of the\ntype II-P/L SN 2013ej to probe the history of mass loss from its progenitor. We\nmodel the observed x-rays as emission from both heated circumstellar matter and\nsupernova ejecta. The circumstellar density profile probed by the supernova\nshock reveals a history of steady mass loss during the final 400 years. The\ninferred mass loss rate of $3 \\times 10^{-6} {\\rm \\; M_\\odot \\; yr^{-1}}$\npoints back to a 14 $M_\\odot$ progenitor. Soon after the explosion we find\nsignificant absorption of reverse shock emission by a cooling shell. The column\ndepth of this shell observed in absorption provides an independent and\nconsistent measurement of the circumstellar density seen in emission. We also\ndetermine the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration from x-rays produced by\nInverse Compton scattering of optical photons by relativistic electrons. Only\nabout 1 percent of the thermal energy is used to accelerate electrons. Our\nx-ray observations and modeling provides stringent tests for models of massive\nstellar evolution and micro-physics of shocks.\n", "  We present a general form of the effective spin-chain model for strongly\ninteracting atomic gases with an arbitrary spin in the one-dimensional(1D)\ntraps. In particular, for high-spin systems the atoms can collide in multiple\nscattering channels, and we find that the resulted form of spin-chain model\ngenerically follows the same structure as that of the interaction potentials.\nThis is a unified form working for any spin, statistics (Bose or Fermi) and\nconfinement potentials. We adopt the spin-chain model to reveal both the\nferromagnetic(FM) and anti-ferromagnetic(AFM) magnetic orders for strongly\ninteracting spin-1 bosons in 1D traps. We further show that by adding the\nspin-orbit coupling, the FM/AFM orders can be gradually destroyed and\neventually the ground state exhibits universal spin structure and contacts that\nare independent of the strength of spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We investigate the scalar sector in an extension of the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) containing a $SU(2)$ Higgs triplet of zero\nhypercharge and a gauge singlet beside the $SU(2)$ scalar doublets. In\nparticular, we focus on a scenario of this model which allows a light\npseudoscalar and/or a scalar below $100$ GeV, consistent with the most recent\ndata from the LHC and the earlier data from the LEP experiments. We analyze the\nexotic decay of the discovered Higgs $(h_{125})$ into two light (hidden) Higgs\nbosons present in the extension. The latter are allowed by the uncertainties in\nthe Higgs decay $h_{125}\\to WW^*$, $h_{125}\\to ZZ^*$ and $h_{125}\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$. The study of the parameter space for such additional\nscalars/pseudoscalars decay of the Higgs is performed in the gluon fusion\nchannel. The extra hidden Higgs bosons of the enlarged scalar sector, if they\nexist, will then decay into lighter fermion paris, i.e., $b\\bar{b}$,\n$\\tau\\bar{\\tau}$ and $\\mu\\bar{\\mu}$ via the mixing with the doublets. A\ndetailed simulation using PYTHIA of the $2b+2\\tau$, $\\geq 3\\tau$, $2b+2\\mu$ and\n$2\\tau+2\\mu$ final states is presented. From our analysis we conclude that,\ndepending on the selected benchmark points, such decay modes can be explored\nwith an integrated luminosity of 25 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC at a center of mass\nenergy of 13 TeV.\n", "  Galactic bulge microlensing surveys provide a probe of Galactic structure. We\npresent the first field-by-field comparison between microlensing observations\nand the Besan\\c{c}on population synthesis Galactic model. Using an updated\nversion of the model we provide maps of optical depth, average event duration\nand event rate for resolved source populations and for difference imaging (DIA)\nevents. We also compare the predicted event timescale distribution to that\nobserved. The simulation follows the selection criteria of the MOA-II survey\n(Sumi et al. 2013). We modify the Besan\\c{c}on model to include M dwarfs and\nbrown dwarfs. Our best fit model requires a brown dwarf mass function slope of\n$-0.4$. The model provides good agreement with the observed average duration,\nand respectable consistency with the shape of the timescale distribution\n(reduced $\\chi^2 \\simeq 2.2$). The DIA and resolved source limiting yields\nbracket the observed number of events by MOA-II ($2.17\\times$ and $0.83\\times$\nthe number observed, respectively). We perform a 2-dimensional fit to the event\nspatial distribution to predict the optical depth and event rate across the\nGalactic bulge. The most serious difficulty for the model is that it provides\nonly $\\sim 50\\%$ of the measured optical depth and event rate per star at low\nGalactic latitude around the inner bulge ($|b|<3{^\\circ}$). This discrepancy\nmost likely is associated with known under-estimated extinction and star counts\nin the innermost regions and therefore provides additional support for a\nmissing inner stellar population.\n", "  We comment on a simple way to accommodate translational symmetry breaking\ninto the recently proposed holographic model which features a superconducting\ndome-shaped region on the temperature-doping phase diagram.\n", "  We use a hydro-and-radiative-transfer code to explore the behavior of a very\nmassive star (VMS) after a giant eruption -- i.e., following a supernova\nimpostor event. Beginning with reasonable models for evolved VMSs with masses\nof $80~M_\\odot$ and $120~M_\\odot$, we simulate the change of state caused by a\ngiant eruption via two methods that explicitly conserve total energy: 1.\nSynthetically removing outer layers of mass of a few $M_\\odot$ while reducing\nthe energy of the inner layers. 2. Synthetically transferring energy from the\ncore to the outer layers, an operation that automatically causes mass ejection.\nOur focus is on the aftermath, not the poorly-understood eruption itself. Then,\nusing a radiation-hydrodynamic code in 1D with realistic opacities and\nconvection, the interior disequilibrium state is followed for about 200 years.\nTypically the star develops a $\\sim 400 ~\\rm{km}~\\rm{s}^{-1}$ wind with a mass\nloss rate that begins around $0.1 ~M_\\odot~\\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and gradually\ndecreases. This outflow is driven by $\\kappa$-mechanism radial pulsations. The\n1D models have regular pulsations but 3D models will probably be more chaotic.\nIn some cases a plateau in the mass-loss rate may persist about 200 years,\nwhile other cases are more like $\\eta$ Car which lost $>10~M_\\odot$ and then\nhad an abnormal mass loss rate for more than a century after its eruption. In\nour model, the post-eruption outflow carried more mass than the initial\neruption. These simulations constitute a useful preliminary reconnaissance for\n3D models which will be far more difficult.\n", "  We develop the BRST approach for all massless integer and half-integer higher\nspins in 4D Minkowski space, using the two component spinor nota- tion and\ndevelop the Lagrangian formulation for supersymmetric higher spin models. It is\nshown that the problem of second class constraints disappears and the BRST\nprocedure becomes much more simple than in tensorial nota- tion. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the BRST procedure automatically provides extra auxiliary\ncomponents that belong in the set of supersymmetry auxiliary components.\nFinally, we demonstrate how supersymmetry transfo- rmations are realized in\nsuch an approach. As a result, we conclude that the BRST approach to higher\nspin supersymmetric theories allows to derive both the Lagrangian and the\nsupersymmetry transformations. Although most part of the work is devoted to\nmassless component supersymmetric models, we also discuss generalization for\nmassive component supersymmetric models and for superfield models.\n", "  We analyse by numerical simulations and scaling arguments the avalanche\nstatistics of 1-dimensional elastic interfaces in random media driven at a\nsingle point. Both global and local avalanche sizes are power-law distributed,\nwith universal exponents given by the depinning roughness exponent $\\zeta$ and\nthe interface dimension $d$, and distinct from their values in the uniformly\ndriven case. A crossover appears between uniformly driven behaviour for small\navalanches, and point driven behaviour for large avalanches. The scale of the\ncrossover is controlled by the ratio between the stiffness of the pulling\nspring and the elasticity of the interface; it is visible both in the global\nand local avalanche-size distributions, as in the average spatial avalanche\nshape. Our results are relevant to model experiments involving locally driven\nelastic manifolds at low temperatures, such as magnetic domain walls or vortex\nlines in superconductors.\n", "  We present a detailed derivation of the recently suggested new type of\nhill-top inflation [arXiv:1509.07270] originating from the microcanonical\ndensity matrix initial conditions in cosmology driven by conformal field theory\n(CFT). The cosmological instantons of topology $S^1\\times S^3$, which set up\nthese initial conditions, have the shape of a garland with multiple periodic\noscillations of the scale factor of the spatial $S^3$-section. They describe\nunderbarrier oscillations of the inflaton and scale factor in the vicinity of\nthe inflaton potential maximum, which gives a sufficient amount of inflation\nrequired by the known CMB data. We build the approximation of two coupled\nharmonic oscillators for these garland instantons and show that they can\ngenerate inflation consistent with the parameters of the CMB primordial power\nspectrum in the non-minimal Higgs inflation model and in $R^2$ gravity. In\nparticular, the instanton solutions provide smallness of inflationary slow-roll\nparameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\eta<0$ and their relation $\\epsilon\\sim\\eta^2$\ncharacteristic of these two models. We present the mechanism of formation of\nhill-like inflaton potentials, which is based on logarithmic loop corrections\nto the asymptotically shift-invariant tree level potentials of these models in\nthe Einstein frame. We also discuss the role of $R^2$-gravity as an\nindispensable finite renormalization tool in the CFT driven cosmology, which\nguarantees the non-dynamical (ghost free) nature of its scale factor and\nspecial properties of its cosmological garland type instantons. Finally, as a\nsolution to the problem of hierarchy between the Planckian scale and the\ninflation scale we discuss the concept of a hidden sector of conformal higher\nspin fields.\n", "  We propose a new no-go theorem by proving the impossibility of constructing a\ndeterministic quantum circuit that iterates a unitary oracle by calling it only\nonce. Different schemes are provided to bypass this result and to approximately\nrealize the iteration. The optimal scheme is also studied. An interesting\nobservation is that for large number of iterations, a trivial strategy like\nusing the identity channel has the optimal performance, and preprocessing,\npostprocessing, or using resources like entanglement does not help at all.\nIntriguingly, the number of iterations, when being large enough, does not\naffect the performance of the proposed schemes.\n", "  We prove a c-theorem for holographic renormalization group flows in a\nSchrodinger spacetime that demonstrates that the effective radius L(r)\nmonotonically decreases from the UV to the IR, where r is the bulk radial\ncoordinate. This result assumes that the bulk matter satisfies the null energy\ncondition, but holds regardless of the value of the critical exponent z. We\nalso construct several numerical examples in a model where the Schrodinger\nbackground is realized by a massive vector coupled to a real scalar. The full\nSchrodinger group is realized when z=2, and in this case it is possible to\nconstruct solutions with constant effective z(r)=2 along the entire flow.\n", "  Nb3Sn wires are now very close to their final optimization but despite its\nclassical nature, detailed understanding of the role of Ta and Ti doping in the\nA15 is not fully understood. Long thought to be essentially equivalent in their\ninfluence on Hc2, they were interchangeably applied. Here we show that Ti\nproduces significantly more homogeneous chemical and superconducting\nproperties. Despite Ta-doped samples having a slightly higher Tc onset in\nzero-field, they always have a wider Tc-distribution. In particular, whereas\nthe Ta-doped A15 has a Tc-distribution extending from 18 down to 5-6 K (the\nlowest expected Tc for the binary A15 phase), the Ti-doped samples have no A15\nphase with Tc below 12 K. The much narrower Tc distribution in the Ti-doped\nsamples has a positive effect on their in-field Tc-distribution too, leading to\nan extrapolated Hc2(0) 2 Tesla larger than the Ta-doped one. Ti-doping also\nappears to be very homogeneous even when the Sn content is reduced in order to\ninhibit breakdown of the diffusion barriers in very high Jc conductors. The\nenhanced homogeneity of the Ti-doped samples appears to result from its\nassistance of rapid diffusion of Sn into the filaments and by its incorporation\ninto the A15 phase interchangeably with Sn on the Sn sites of the A15 phase.\n", "  We utilize zoom-in cosmological simulations to study the nature of violent\ndisc instability (VDI) in clumpy galaxies at high redshift, $z=1$--$5$. Our\nsimulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in Toomre instability, of\nlinear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disk. There, instability\nis characterised by a $Q$ parameter below unity, and lower when the disk is\nthick. Instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. Over long periods\nthey consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extended\nstructures, with new clumps forming in inter-clump regions. This is while the\ngalaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. We compute the local,\ntwo-component $Q$ parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a $\\sim1~{\\rm kpc}$\nscale to capture clumps of $10^{8-9}~{\\rm M}_\\odot$. The $Q<1$ regions are\nconfined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while the\ninter-clump regions show $Q$ significantly higher than unity. Tracing the\nclumps back to their relatively smooth Lagrangian patches, we find that $Q$\nprior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. This is unlike\nthe expectations from standard Toomre instability. We discuss possible\nmechanisms for high-$Q$ clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading to\nsmall clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clump\nformation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disk. Alternatively, the\nhigh-$Q$ non-linear VDI may be stimulated by the external perturbations such as\nmergers and counter-rotating streams. The high $Q$ may represent excessive\ncompressive modes of turbulence, possibly induced by tidal interactions.\n", "  We consider Yang-Mills theory on manifolds ${\\mathbb R}\\times X$ with a\n$d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $X$ of special holonomy admitting gauge\ninstanton equations. Instantons are considered as particle-like solutions in\n$d+1$ dimensions whose static configurations are concentrated on $X$. We study\nhow they evolve in time when considered as solutions of the Yang-Millsequations\non ${\\mathbb R}\\times X$ with moduli depending on time $t\\in{\\mathbb R}$. It is\nshown that in the adiabatic limit, when the metric in the $X$ direction is\nscaled down, the classical dynamics of slowly moving instantons corresponds to\na geodesic motion in the moduli space $\\cal M$ of gauge instantons on $X$.\nSimilar results about geodesic motion in the moduli space of monopoles and\nvortices in higher dimensions are briefly discussed.\n", "  Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) is used to evaluate the energy\nlevel alignment of a benzene molecule as it approaches a graphene sheet. Within\nCDFT the problem is conveniently mapped onto evaluating total energy\ndifferences between different charge-separated states, and it does not consist\nin determining a quasi-particle spectrum. We demonstrate that the simple local\ndensity approximation provides a good description of the level aligmnent along\nthe entire binding curve, with excellent agreement to experiments at an\ninfinite separation and to GW calculations close to the bonding distance. The\nmethod also allows us to explore the effects due to the presence of graphene\nstructural defects and of multiple molecules. In general all our results can be\nreproduced by a classical image charge model taking into account the finite\ndielectric constant of graphene.\n", "  In this letter, we outline a methodology to calculate microscopically mass\nand charge distributions of spontaneous fission yields. We combine the\nmulti-dimensional minimization of collective action for fission with stochastic\nLangevin dynamics to track the relevant fission paths from the ground-state\nconfiguration up to scission. The nuclear potential energy and collective\ninertia governing the tunneling motion are obtained with nuclear density\nfunctional theory in the collective space of shape deformations and pairing. We\nobtain a quantitative agreement with experimental data and find that both the\ncharge and mass distributions in the spontaneous fission of 240Pu are sensitive\nboth to the dissipation in collective motion and to adiabatic characteristics.\n", "  We develop a method of modified hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks,\nachieving complete immunity to the frequency shifts induced by the probing\nfields themselves. Using particular pulse sequences with tailored phases,\nfrequencies, and durations, we can derive an error signal centered exactly at\nthe unperturbed atomic resonance with a steep discriminant which is robust\nagainst variations in the probe shift. We experimentally investigate the scheme\nusing the magnetically-induced $^1$S$_0- ^3$P$_0$ transition in $^{88}$Sr,\ndemonstrating automatic suppression of a sizeable \\num{2e-13} probe Stark shift\nto below \\num{1e-16} even with very large errors in shift compensation.\n", "  Jet substructure observables play a central role at the Large Hadron Collider\nfor identifying the boosted hadronic decay products of electroweak scale\nresonances. The complete description of these observables requires\nunderstanding both the limit in which hard substructure is resolved, as well as\nthe limit of a jet with a single hard core. In this paper we study in detail\nthe perturbative structure of two prominent jet substructure observables,\n$N$-subjettiness and the energy correlation functions, as measured on\nbackground QCD jets. In particular, we focus on the distinction between the\nlimits in which two-prong structure is resolved or unresolved. Depending on the\nchoice of subjet axes, we demonstrate that at fixed order, $N$-subjettiness can\nmanifest myriad behaviors in the unresolved region: smooth tails, end-point\nsingularities, or singularities in the physical region. The energy correlation\nfunctions, by contrast, only have non-singular perturbative tails extending to\nthe end point. We discuss the effect of hadronization on the various\nobservables with Monte Carlo simulation and demonstrate that the modeling of\nthese effects with non-perturbative shape functions is highly dependent on the\n$N$-subjettiness axes definitions. Our study illustrates those regions of phase\nspace that must be controlled for high-precision jet substructure calculations,\nand emphasizes how such calculations can be facilitated by designing\nsubstructure observables with simple singular structures.\n", "  We present an analysis of the predictions made by the Galform semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation model for the evolution of the relationship between stellar\nmass and halo mass. We show that for the standard implementations of supernova\nfeedback and gas reincorporation used in semi-analytic models, this\nrelationship is predicted to evolve weakly over the redshift range 0<z<4.\nModest evolution in the median stellar mass versus halo mass (SHM) relationship\nimplicitly requires that, at fixed halo mass, the efficiency of stellar mass\nassembly must be almost constant with cosmic time. We show that in our model,\nthis behaviour can be understood in simple terms as a result of a constant\nefficiency of gas reincorporation, and an efficiency of SNe feedback that is,\non average, constant at fixed halo mass. We present a simple explanation of how\nfeedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) acts in our model to introduce a\nbreak in the SHM relation whose location is predicted to evolve only modestly.\nFinally, we show that if modifications are introduced into the model such that,\nfor example, the gas reincorporation efficiency is no longer constant, the\nmedian SHM relation is predicted to evolve significantly over 0<z<4.\nSpecifically, we consider modifications that allow the model to better\nreproduce either the evolution of the stellar mass function or the evolution of\naverage star formation rates inferred from observations.\n", "  A precise measurement of the Higgs boson couplings to bottom and top quarks\nis of paramount importance during the upcoming LHC runs. We present a\ncomprehensive analysis for the Higgs production process in association with a\nsemi-leptonically decaying top-quark pair and subsequent Higgs boson decay into\nbottom quarks. Due to the highly complex final state and large Standard Model\nbackgrounds, measuring the signal strength in this process is known to be\nchallenging. To maximise the sensitivity, we analyse different, statistically\nindependent, phase space regions, where one or more of the heavy resonances are\nboosted. This allows us to employ jet substructure techniques, which help to\nreduce large tt+X backgrounds. We find that combining several ttH(bb) phase\nspace regions will allow one to measure deviations of the Standard Model signal\nstrength of order 20% with 3 ab^{-1}.\n", "  We present a study that investigated a quantum dipolar gas in continuous\nspace where a potential lattice was imposed. Employing exact quantum Monte\nCarlo techniques, we analysed the ground state properties of the scrutinised\nsystem, varying the lattice depth and the dipolar interaction. For system\ndensities corresponding to a commensurate filling with respect to the optical\nlattice, we observed a simple crystal-to-superfluid quantum phase transition,\nbeing consistent with the physics of dipolar bosons in continuous space. In\ncontrast, an incommensurate density showed the presence of a supersolid phase.\nIndeed, such a result opens up the tempting opportunity to observe a\ndefect-induced supersolidity with dipolar gases in combination with a tunable\noptical lattice. Finally, the stability of the condensate was analysed at\nfinite temperature.\n", "  We study the impact of a hidden sector beyond the Standard Model, e.g. a\nHidden Valley model, on factorial moments and cumulants of multiplicity\ndistributions in multiparticle production with a special emphasis on the\nprospects for LHC results.\n", "  The riddle posed by super-Earths (1-4$R_\\oplus$, 2-20$M_\\oplus$) is that they\nare not Jupiters: their core masses are large enough to trigger runaway gas\naccretion, yet somehow super-Earths accreted atmospheres that weigh only a few\npercent of their total mass. We show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths\nformed late, as the last vestiges of their parent gas disks were about to\nclear. This scenario would seem to present fine-tuning problems, but we show\nthat there are none. Ambient gas densities can span many (up to 9) orders of\nmagnitude, and super-Earths can still robustly emerge after $\\sim$0.1-1 Myr\nwith percent-by-weight atmospheres. Super-Earth cores are naturally bred in\ngas-poor environments where gas dynamical friction has weakened sufficiently to\nallow constituent protocores to merge. So little gas is present at the time of\ncore assembly that cores hardly migrate by disk torques: formation of\nsuper-Earths can be in situ. The picture --- that close-in super-Earths form in\na gas-poor (but not gas-empty) inner disk, fed continuously by gas that bleeds\ninward from a more massive outer disk --- recalls the largely evacuated but\nstill accreting inner cavities of transitional protoplanetary disks. We also\naddress the inverse problem presented by super-puffs: an uncommon class of\nshort-period planets seemingly too voluminous for their small masses\n(4-10$R_\\oplus$, 2-6$M_\\oplus$). Super-puffs easily acquire their thick\natmospheres as dust-free, rapidly cooling worlds outside $\\sim$1 AU where\nnebular gas is colder, less dense, and therefore less opaque. Unlike\nsuper-Earths which can form in situ, super-puffs migrated in to their current\norbits; they are expected to form the outer links of mean-motion resonant\nchains, and to exhibit greater water content. We close by confronting\nobservations and itemizing remaining questions.\n", "  Kepler and K2 data analysis reported in the literature is mostly based on\naperture photometry. Because of Kepler's large, undersampled pixels and the\npresence of nearby sources, aperture photometry is not always the ideal way to\nobtain high-precision photometry and, because of this, the data set has not\nbeen fully exploited so far. We present a new method that builds on our\nexperience with undersampled HST images. The method involves a point-spread\nfunction (PSF) neighbour-subtraction and was specifically developed to exploit\nthe huge potential offered by the K2 \"super-stamps\" covering the core of dense\nstar clusters. Our test-bed targets were the NGC 2158 and M 35 regions observed\nduring the K2 Campaign 0. We present our PSF modeling and demonstrate that, by\nusing a high-angular-resolution input star list from the Asiago Schmidt\ntelescope as the basis for PSF neighbour subtraction, we are able to reach\nmagnitudes as faint as Kp~24 with a photometric precision of 10% over 6.5\nhours, even in the densest regions. At the bright end, our photometric\nprecision reaches ~30 parts-per-million. Our method leads to a considerable\nlevel of improvement at the faint magnitudes (Kp>15.5) with respect to the\nclassical aperture photometry. This improvement is more significant in crowded\nregions. We also extracted raw light curves of ~60,000 stars and detrended them\nfor systematic effects induced by spacecraft motion and other artifacts that\nharms K2 photometric precision. We present a list of 2133 variables.\n", "  This study is concerned with numerical linear stability analysis of liquid\nmetal flow in a square duct with thin electrically conducting walls subject to\na uniform transverse magnetic field. We derive an asymptotic solution for the\nbase flow which is valid not only for high but also moderate magnetic fields.\nThis solution shows that for low wall conductance ratios $c\\ll1,$ an extremely\nstrong magnetic field with the Hartmann number $Ha\\sim c^{-4}$ is required to\nattain the asymptotic flow regime considered in the previous studies. We use a\nvector stream function/vorticity formulation and a Chebyshev collocation method\nto solve the eigenvalue problem for three-dimensional small-amplitude\nperturbations in ducts with realistic wall conductance ratios $c=1,0.1,0.01$\nand Hartmann numbers up to $10^{4}.$ As for similar flows, instability in a\nsufficiently strong magnetic field is found to occur in the side-wall jets with\nthe characteristic thickness $\\delta\\sim Ha^{-1/2}.$ This results in the\ncritical Reynolds number and wavenumber increasing asymptotically with the\nmagnetic field as $Re_{c}\\sim110Ha^{1/2}$ and $k_{c}\\sim0.5Ha^{1/2}.$ The\nrespective critical Reynolds number based on the total volume flux in a square\nduct with $c\\ll1$ is $\\bar{Re}_{c}\\approx520.$ Although this value is somewhat\nlarger than$\\bar{Re}_{c}\\approx313$ found by Ting et al. (1991) for the\nasymptotic side-wall jet profile, it still appears significantly lower than the\nReynolds numbers at which turbulence is observed in experiments as well as in\ndirect numerical simulations of this type of flows.\n", "  The ability to transfer quantum information from one location to another with\nhigh fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science.\nUnfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or a\nparticle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time grows\nexponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we show\nthat the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniform\nchain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelity\nstate transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can be\ntuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\\propto\nN^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with large\namplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues.\nThe state transfer time scales as $t\\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$\napproaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to\\infty$; the error scales as\n$1-F\\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptotically\nperfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence of\nexternal control.\n", "  We investigate the center-of-mass momentum distribution $n_{\\boldsymbol Q}$\nof Cooper pairs and their first-order correlation function $g_1(r)$ in a\nstrongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas. Recently, the BKT\n(Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) transition was reported in a two-dimensional\n$^6$Li Fermi gas, based on (1) the observations of anomalous enhancement of\n$n_{{\\boldsymbol Q}={\\boldsymbol 0}}$ [M. G. Ries, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n114, 230401 (2015)], as well as (2) a power-law behavior of $g_1(r)$ [P. A.\nMurthy, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 010401 (2015)]. However, including\npairing fluctuations within a $T$-matrix approximation (TMA), we show that\nthese results can still be explained as strong-coupling properties of a\nnormal-state two-dimensional Fermi gas. Our results indicate the importance of\nfurther experimental observations, to definitely confirm the realization of the\nBKT transition in this system. Since the BKT transition has been realized in a\ntwo-dimensional ultracold Bose gas, our results would be useful for the\nachievement of this quasi-long range order in an ultracold Fermi gas.\n", "  A $6.8 \\ {\\rm nb^{-1}}$ sample of $pp$ collision data collected under\nlow-luminosity conditions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV by the ATLAS detector at the\nLarge Hadron Collider is used to study diffractive dijet production. Events\ncontaining at least two jets with $p_\\mathrm{T} > 20$ GeV are selected and\nanalysed in terms of variables which discriminate between diffractive and\nnon-diffractive processes. Cross sections are measured differentially in\n$\\Delta\\eta^F$, the size of the observable forward region of pseudorapidity\nwhich is devoid of hadronic activity, and in an estimator, $\\tilde{\\xi}$, of\nthe fractional momentum loss of the proton assuming single diffractive\ndissociation ($pp \\rightarrow pX$). Model comparisons indicate a dominant\nnon-diffractive contribution up to moderately large $\\Delta\\eta^F$ and small\n$\\tilde{\\xi}$, with a diffractive contribution which is significant at the\nhighest $\\Delta\\eta^F$ and the lowest $\\tilde{\\xi}$. The rapidity-gap survival\nprobability is estimated from comparisons of the data in this latter region\nwith predictions based on diffractive parton distribution functions.\n", "  We report the continuous and partially nondestructive measurement of optical\nphotons. For a weak light pulse traveling through a slow-light optical medium\n(signal), the associated atomic-excitation component is detected by another\nlight beam (probe) with the aid of an optical cavity. We observe strong\ncorrelations of $g^{(2)}_{sp}=4.4(5)$ between the transmitted signal and probe\nphotons. The observed (intrinsic) conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency\nranges between 13% and 1% (65% and 5%) for a signal transmission range of 2% to\n35%, at a typical time resolution of 2.5 $\\mu$s. The maximal observed\n(intrinsic) device nondestructive quantum efficiency, defined as the product of\nthe conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency and the signal transmission,\nis 0.5% (2.4%). The normalized cross-correlation function violates the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality, confirming the non-classical character of the\ncorrelations.\n", "  Recently, various authors have proposed that the first ultraviolet effect on\nthe gravitational collapse of massive stars to black holes is the transition\nbetween a black-hole geometry and a white-hole geometry, though their proposals\nare radically different in terms of their physical interpretation and\ncharacteristic time scales [1,2]. Several decades ago, it was shown by Eardley\nthat white holes are highly unstable to the accretion of small amounts of\nmatter, being rapidly turned into black holes [3]. Studying the crossing of\nnull shells on geometries describing the black-hole to white-hole transition,\nwe obtain the conditions for the instability to develop in terms of the\nparameters of these geometries. We conclude that transitions with long\ncharacteristic time scales are pathologically unstable: occasional\nperturbations away from the perfect vacuum around these compact objects, even\nif being imperceptibly small, suffocate the white hole explosion. On the other\nhand, geometries with short characteristic time scales are shown to be robust\nagainst perturbations, so that the corresponding processes could take place in\nreal astrophysical scenarios. This motivates a conjecture about the transition\namplitudes of different decay channels for black holes in a suitable\nultraviolet completion of general relativity.\n", "  We derive relations between viscosities and momentum conductivity in $2+1$\ndimensions by finding a generalization of holographic Ward identities for the\nenergy-momentum tensor. The generalization is novel in the sense that it goes\nbeyond the usual identities obtained from holographic renormalization. Our\nresults are consistent with previous field theory analysis. The main tools we\nuse are a constant `probability current' in the gravity dual, that we are able\nto define for any system of linear ODEs, and parity symmetry.\n", "  We study supersymmetric deformations of N = 4 quantum mechanics with a Kahler\ntarget space admitting a holomorphic isometry. We show that the twisted mass\ndeformation generalises to a deformation constructed from matrix-valued\nfunctions of the moment map, which obey the Nahm equations. We also explain how\nN = 4 supersymmetry implies that the Berry connection on the vacuum bundle for\nthis theory satisfies the BPS monopole equations. In the case where the target\nspace is a Riemann sphere, our analysis reduces to the standard Nahm\nconstruction of monopoles. This generalises an earlier result by Sonner and\nTong to the case of monopoles of magnetic charge greater than one.\n", "  Context. Blazars are among the most energetic objects in the Universe. In\n2008 August, Fermi/LAT detected the blazar PKS 1502+106 showing a rapid and\nstrong gamma-ray outburst followed by high and variable flux over the next\nmonths. This activity at high energies triggered an intensive multi-wavelength\ncampaign covering also the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray bands indicating that\nthe flare was accompanied by a simultaneous outburst at optical/UV/X-rays and a\ndelayed outburst at radio bands.\n  Aims: In the current work we explore the phenomenology and physical\nconditions within the ultra-relativistic jet of the gamma-ray blazar PKS\n1502+106. Additionally, we address the question of the spatial localization of\nthe MeV/GeV-emitting region of the source.\n  Methods: We utilize ultra-high angular resolution mm-VLBI observations at 43\nand 86 GHz complemented by VLBI observations at 15 GHz. We also employ\nsingle-dish radio data from the F-GAMMA program at frequencies matching the\nVLBI monitoring.\n  Results: PKS 1502+106 shows a compact core-jet morphology and fast\nsuperluminal motion with apparent speeds in the range 5--22 c. Estimation of\nDoppler factors along the jet yield values between ~7 up to ~50. This Doppler\nfactor gradient implies an accelerating jet. The viewing angle towards the\nsource differs between the inner and outer jet, with the former at ~3 degrees\nand the latter at ~1 degree, after the jet bends towards the observer beyond 1\nmas. The de-projected opening angle of the ultra-fast, magnetically-dominated\njet is found to be (3.8 +/- 0.5) degrees. A single jet component can be\nassociated with the pronounced flare both at high-energies and in radio bands.\nFinally, the gamma-ray emission region is localized at less than 5.9 pc away\nfrom the jet base.\n", "  The elegance of inflationary cosmology and cosmological perturbation theory\nends with the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the initial sources of\nlight that launched the phenomenologically rich process of cosmic reionization.\nHere we review the current understanding of early star formation, emphasizing\nunsolved problems and technical challenges. We begin with the first generation\nof stars to form after the Big Bang and trace how they influenced subsequent\nstar formation. The onset of chemical enrichment coincided with a sharp\nincrease in the overall physical complexity of star forming systems. Ab-initio\ncomputational treatments are just now entering the domain of the predictive and\nare establishing contact with local observations of the relics of this ancient\nepoch.\n", "  We review the observable consequences of the epoch of reionization (EoR) on\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB), and the resulting constraints on the\nEoR. We discuss how Thomson scattering with the free electrons produced during\nEoR equates to an optical depth for CMB photons. The optical depth measurements\nfrom the WMAP and Planck satellites, using large-scale CMB polarization power\nspectra, is one of the few current constraints on the timing of cosmic\nreionization. We also present forecasts for the precision with which the\noptical depth will be measured by future satellite missions. Second, we\nconsider the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, and how the kSZ power\nspectrum depends on the duration of reionization. We review current\nmeasurements of the kSZ power and forecasts for future experiments. Finally, we\nmention proposals to look for spectral distortions in the CMB that are related\nto the electron temperature at EoR, and ideas to map the variations in the\noptical depth across the sky.\n", "  The presence of elements heavier than helium (\"metals\") is of fundamental\nimportance for a large number of astrophysical processes occurring in planet,\nstar and galaxy formation; it also affects cosmic structure formation and\nevolution in several ways. Even a small amount of heavy elements can\ndramatically alter the chemistry of the gas, opening the path to complex\nmolecules. Metals might enhance the ability of the gas to radiate away its\nthermal energy, thus favoring the formation of gravitationally bound objects;\nthey can also condensate in a solid phase (dust grains), partly or totally\nblocking radiation from luminous sources. Finally, they represent useful\ntracers of energy deposition by stars and probe the physical properties of the\nenvironment by absorption or emission lines. Last, but certainly not least,\nlife -- as we know it on Earth -- is tightly related to the presence of at\nleast some of the heavy elements. In this pedagogical review I will concentrate\non the connection between early metal enrichment and cosmic reionization. As we\nwill see these two processes are intimately connected and their joint study\nmight turn out to be fundamental in understanding the overall evolution of the\nUniverse during the first billion years after the Big Bang, an epoch\ncorresponding to redshifts z>6.\n", "  One of the most exciting probes of the early phases of structure formation\nand reionization is the spin-flip line of neutral hydrogen, with a rest\nwavelength of 21 cm. This chapter introduces the physics of this transition and\nthe astrophysical parameters upon which it depends, including discussions of\nthe radiation fields that permeate the intergalactic medium that fix the\nbrightness of this transition. We describe the critical points in the evolution\nof the 21-cm background and focus on the sky-averaged brightness and the power\nspectrum as representative measurements. Finally, we include a discussion of\nobservations and the challenges they face in the near future.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies in the early universe provide us with perhaps the most\nnatural way of explaining the reionization of the universe. Current\nobservational results are sufficiently comprehensive, as to allow us to\napproximately calculate how the ionizing radiation from galaxies varies as a\nfunction of cosmic time. Important uncertainties in modeling reionization by\ngalaxies revolve around the escape fraction and its luminosity and redshift\ndependence, a possible truncation of the galaxy luminosity function at the\nfaint end, and an evolution in the production efficiency of Lyman-continuum\nphotons with cosmic time. Despite these uncertainties, plausible choices for\nthese parameters naturally predict a cosmic ionizing emissivity at z~6-10 whose\nevolution and overall normalization is in excellent agreement with that derived\nfrom current observational constraints. This strongly suggests that galaxies\nprovide the necessary photons to reionize the universe.\n", "  We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate\nenvironmental effects in galaxy evolution between $z\\sim0.5$ and $0.9$. The\nlarge number of spectroscopic redshifts over an area of about\n$10\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$ provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The\naccurate redshift measurements, with $\\sigma_z = 0.00047(1+z_\\mathrm{spec})$,\nallow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest- and highest-density\nenvironments, as defined in terms of spatial 3D density contrast. We estimate\nthe stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies residing in these two environments,\nand constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. We find that the\ngalaxy SMF in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured at\nlow densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter\n(less negative) slope at $z<0.8$. We normalise each SMF to the comoving volume\noccupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from different\nredshift bins. We observe an evolution of the SMF of VIPERS galaxies in high\ndensities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these\nresults to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures.\nWe discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite\ngalaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and\nenvironmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and therefore\ndifficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is well\ndescribed by the formalism introduced by Peng et al.~(2010), and is consistent\nwith the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal\nphysical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the\nSMF in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from\ndry mergers is considered. [Abridged]\n", "  A major goal of observational and theoretical cosmology is to observe the\nlargely unexplored time period in the history of our universe when the first\ngalaxies form, and to interpret these measurements. Early galaxies dramatically\nimpacted the gas around them in the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) by\nphotoionzing the gas during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This epoch likely\nspanned an extended stretch in cosmic time: ionized regions formed and grew\naround early generations of galaxies, gradually filling a larger and larger\nfraction of the volume of the universe. At some time -- thus far uncertain, but\nwithin the first billion years or so after the big bang -- essentially the\nentire volume of the universe became filled with ionized gas. The properties of\nthe IGM provide valuable information regarding the formation time and nature of\nearly galaxy populations, and many approaches for studying the first luminous\nsources are hence based on measurements of the surrounding intergalactic gas.\nThe prospects for improved reionization-era observations of the IGM and early\ngalaxy populations over the next decade are outstanding. Motivated by this, we\nreview the current state of models of the IGM during reionization. We focus on\na few key aspects of reionization-era phenomenology and describe: the redshift\nevolution of the volume-averaged ionization fraction, the properties of the\nsources and sinks of ionizing photons, along with models describing the spatial\nvariations in the ionization fraction, the ultraviolet radiation field, the\ntemperature of the IGM, and the gas density distribution.\n", "  Neutral diffuse intergalactic gas that existed during the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR) suppresses Lyman Alpha (Lya) flux emitted by background\ngalaxies. In this chapter I summarise the increasing observational support for\nthe claim that Lya photons emitted by galaxies at z>6 are suppressed by\nintervening HI gas. I describe key physical processes that affect Lya transfer\nduring the EoR. I argue that in spite of the uncertainties associated with this\ncomplex multiscale problem, the data on Lya emitting galaxies at z=0-6 strongly\nsuggests that the observed reduction in Lya flux from galaxies at z>6 is due to\nadditional intervening HI gas. The main question is what fraction of this\nadditional HI gas is in the diffuse neutral IGM. I summarise how future surveys\non existing and upcoming instruments are expected to reduce existing\nobservational uncertainties enormously. With these improved data we will likely\nbe able to nail down reionization with Lya emitting galaxies.\n", "  The central engine and jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remain\nmysterious. Here we suggest that observations on polarization evolution of\nearly optical afterglows may shed light on these questions. We first study the\ndynamics of a reverse shock and a forward shock that are generated during the\ninteraction of a relativistic jet and its ambient medium. The jet is likely\nmagnetized with a globally large-scale magnetic field from the central engine.\nThe existence of the reverse shock requires that the magnetization degree of\nthe jet should not be high ($\\sigma\\leq 1$), so that the jet is mainly composed\nof baryons and leptons. We then calculate the light curve and polarization\nevolution of an early optical afterglow, and find that when the polarization\nposition angle changes by $90^\\circ$ during the early afterglow, the\npolarization degree is zero for a toroidal magnetic field but is very likely to\nbe non-zero for an aligned magnetic field. This result would be expected to\nprovide a probe for the central engine of GRBs, because an aligned field\nconfiguration could originate from a magnetar central engine and a toroidal\nfield configuration could be produced from a black hole via the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism. Finally, for such two kinds of magnetic field\nconfigurations, we fit the observed data of the early optical afterglow of GRB\n120308A equally well.\n", "  The quark propagator is studied under a truncation scheme beyond the rainbow\napproximation by dressing the quark-gluon vertex non-perturbatively. It is\nfound that, in the chiral limit with dynamical symmetry breaking, the dynamical\nquark mass and the quark condensate are significantly enhanced due to the\nnon-Abelian contribution arising from the three-gluon interaction compared to\nthose under the rainbow approximation; and the critical strength of the\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking is much lowered. The Abelian contribution is\nmuch smaller than the non-Abelian contribution. A technical issue on removing\nthe ultraviolet divergences including the overlapping divergences is discussed.\n", "  We present preliminary results of the quasar survey in Large Sky Area Multi-\nObject Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) first data release (DR1), which\nincludes pilot survey and the first year regular survey. There are 3921 quasars\nidentified with reliability, among which 1180 are new quasars discovered in the\nsurvey. These quasars are at low to median redshifts, with highest z of 4.83.\nWe compile emission line measurements around the H{\\alpha}, H{\\beta}, Mg II,\nand C IV regions for the new quasars. The continuum luminosities are inferred\nfrom SDSS photo- metric data with model fitting as the spectra in DR1 are\nnon-flux-calibrated. We also compile the virial black hole mass estimates, and\nflags indicating the selec- tion methods, broad absorption line quasars. The\ncatalog and spectra for these quasars are available online. 28% of the 3921\nquasars are selected with optical- infrared colours independently, indicating\nthat the method is quite promising in completeness of quasar survey. LAMOST DR1\nand the on-going quasar survey will provide valuable data in the studies of\nquasars.\n", "  We present a fast and stable numerical technique to obtain the self-energy\nterms of electrodes for first-principles electron-transport calculations.\nAlthough first-principles calculations based on the real-space\nfinite-difference method are advantageous for execution on massively parallel\ncomputers, large-scale transport calculations are hampered by the computational\ncost and numerical instability of the computation of the self-energy terms.\nUsing the orthogonal complement vectors of the space spanned by the generalized\nBloch waves that actually contribute to transport phenomena, the computational\naccuracy of transport properties is significantly improved with a moderate\ncomputational cost. To demonstrate the efficiency of the present technique, the\nelectron-transport properties of a Stone-Wales (SW) defect in graphene and\nsilicene are examined. The resonance scattering of the SW defect is observed in\nthe conductance spectrum of silicene since the $\\sigma^\\ast$ state of silicene\nlies near the Fermi energy. In addition, we found that one conduction channel\nis sensitive to a defect near the Fermi energy, while the other channel is\nhardly affected. This characteristic behavior of the conduction channels is\ninterpreted in terms of the bonding network between the bilattices of the\nhoneycomb structure in the formation of the SW defect. The present technique\nenables us to distinguish the different behaviors of the two conduction\nchannels in graphene and silicene owing to its excellent accuracy.\n", "  Massive stars having a CO core of $\\sim$40-60 M$_\\odot$ experience\npulsational pair-instability (PPI) after carbon-burning. This instability\ninduces strong pulsations of the whole star and a part of outer envelope is\nejected. We investigate the evolution and mass ejection of metal-poor very\nmassive stars which experience PPI. We use stellar models with initial masses\nof 140, 200, and 250 M$_\\odot$ and the metallicity Z=0.004. Their masses\ndecrease to 54.09, 58.65, and 61.03 M$_\\odot$ before the neon-burning owing to\nmass-loss and He mass fraction at the surface becomes about 20%. During the PPI\nperiod of $\\sim$1-2000 yr, they experience six, four, and three pulsations,\nrespectively. The larger CO-core model has the longer PPI period and ejects the\nlarger amount of mass. Since almost all surface He has been lost by the\npulsations, these stars become Type Ic supernovae if they explode. Light curves\nduring the PPI stage and supernovae are investigated and are implicated in\nluminous supernovae. The luminosity created by the interaction of different PPI\nejecta becomes $M_{\\rm bol} \\sim -16$ to $-20$. The interaction between the\ncircumstellar shell ejected by PPI and the supernova ejecta can be more\nluminous. These luminous transients could be an origin of Type I superluminous\nsupernovae and supernovae with precursor.\n", "  Context. The Gaia project will determine positions, proper motions, and\nparallaxes for more than one billion stars in our Galaxy. It is known that\nGaia's two telescopes are affected by a small but significant variation of the\nbasic angle between them. Unless this variation is taken into account during\ndata processing, e.g. using on-board metrology, it causes systematic errors in\nthe astrometric parameters, in particular a shift of the parallax zero-point.\nPreviously, we suggested an early reduction of Gaia data for the subset of\nTycho-2 stars (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution; TGAS).\n  Aims. We aim to investigate whether quasars can be used to independently\nverify the parallax zero-point already in early data reductions. This is not\ntrivially possible as the observation interval is too short to disentangle\nparallax and proper motion for the quasar subset.\n  Methods. We repeat TGAS simulations but additionally include simulated Gaia\nobservations of quasars from ground-based surveys. All observations are\nsimulated with basic angle variations. To obtain a full astrometric solution\nfor the quasars in TGAS we explore the use of prior information for their\nproper motions.\n  Results. It is possible to determine the parallax zero-point for the quasars\nwith a few {\\mu}as uncertainty, and it agrees to a similar precision with the\nzero-point for the Tycho-2 stars. The proposed strategy is robust even for\nquasars exhibiting significant fictitious proper motion due to a variable\nsource structure, or when the quasar subset is contaminated with stars\nmisidentified as quasars.\n  Conclusions. Using prior information about quasar proper motions we could\nprovide an independent verification of the parallax zero-point in early\nsolutions based on less than one year of Gaia data.\n", "  We construct time-dependent charged black string solutions in\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. In the far region, the spacetime\napproaches a five-dimensional Kasner universe with a expanding\nthree-dimensional space and a shrinking extra dimension. Near the event\nhorizon, the spacetime is approximately static and has a smooth event horizon.\nWe also study the motion of test particles around the black string and show the\nexistence of quasi-circular orbits. Finally, we briefly discuss the stability\nof this spacetime.\n", "  We present grids of limb-darkening coefficients computed from non-LTE,\nline-blanketed TLUSTY model atmospheres, covering effective-temperature and\nsurface-gravity ranges of 15--55kK and 4.75 dex (cgs) down to the effective\nEddington limit, at 1x, 1x, 0.5x (LMC), 0.2x (SMC), and 0.1x solar. Results are\ngiven for the Bessell UBVRIJKHL, Sloan ugriz, Stromgren ubvy, WFCAM ZYJHK,\nHipparcos, Kepler, and Tycho passbands, in each case characterized by several\ndifferent limb-darkening `laws'. We examine the sensitivity of limb darkening\nto temperature, gravity, metallicity, microturbulent velocity, and wavelength,\nand make a comparison with LTE models. The dependence on metallicity is very\nweak, but limb darkening is a moderately strong function of log(g) in this\ntemperature regime.\n", "  \\Kepler has revolutionised our understanding of both exoplanets and their\nhost stars. Asteroseismology is a valuable tool in the characterisation of\nstars and \\Kepler is an excellent observing facility to perform\nasteroseismology. Here we select a sample of 35 \\Kepler solar-type stars which\nhost transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected solar-like\noscillations. Using available \\Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we\ncreate power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We\nidentify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging''\nusing a Bayesian MCMC framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of\nquality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We\nreport the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars\nand frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to\nthe high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance\nmatrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These\nfrequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain\ntight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.\n", "  Conditional preparation is a well-established technique for quantum state\nengineering of light. A general trend is to increase the number of heralding\ndetection events in such realization to reach larger photon-number states or\ntheir arbitrary superpositions. In contrast to pulsed implementations, where\ndetections only occur within the pulse window, for continuous-wave light the\ntemporal separation of the conditioning detections is an additional degree of\nfreedom and a critical parameter. Based on the theoretical study by A.E.B.\nNielsen and K. Molmer and on a continuous-wave two-mode squeezed vacuum from a\nnondegenerate optical parametric oscillator, we experimentally investigate the\ngeneration of two-photon state with tunable delay between the heralding events.\nThe present work illustrates the temporal multimode features in play for\nconditional state generation based on continuous-wave light sources.\n", "  We study the processes $\\gamma \\gamma \\to K^0_S K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ and $\\gamma\n\\gamma \\to K^+ K^- \\pi^0$ using a data sample of 519~$fb^{-1}$ recorded with\nthe BaBar detector operating at the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$\ncollider at center-of-mass energies at and near the $\\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n =\n2,3,4$) resonances. We observe $\\eta_c$ decays to both final states and perform\nDalitz plot analyses using a model-independent partial wave analysis technique.\nThis allows a model-independent measurement of the mass-dependence of the\n$I=1/2$ $K \\pi$ $\\mathcal{S}$-wave amplitude and phase. A comparison between\nthe present measurement and those from previous experiments indicates similar\nbehaviour for the phase up to a mass of 1.5 $GeV/c^2$. In contrast, the\namplitudes show very marked differences. The data require the presence of a new\n$a_0(1950)$ resonance with parameters $m=1931 \\pm 14 \\pm 22 \\ MeV/c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma=271 \\pm 22 \\pm 29 \\ MeV$.\n", "  We solve the two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations of black\nhole accretion with the presence of magnetic field. The field includes a\nturbulent component, whose role is represented by the viscosity, and a\nlarge-scale ordered component. The latter is further assumed to be evenly\nsymmetric with the equatorial plane. The equations are solved in the $r-\\theta$\nplane of a spherical coordinate by assuming time-steady and radially\nself-similar. An inflow-wind solution is found. Around the equatorial plane,\nthe gas is inflowing; while above and below the equatorial plane at a certain\ncritical $\\theta$ angle, $\\theta\\sim 47^{\\circ}$, the inflow changes its\ndirection of radial motion and becomes wind. The driving forces are analyzed\nand found to be the centrifugal force and the gradient of gas and magnetic\npressure. The properties of wind are also calculated. The specific angular\nmomentum of wind is found to be significantly larger than that of inflow, thus\nwind can transfer angular momentum outward. These analytical results are\ncompared to those obtained by the trajectory analysis based on MHD numerical\nsimulation data and good agreements are found.\n", "  We construct an entanglement witness for many-qubit systems, based on\nsymmetric two-body correlations with two measurement settings. This witness is\nable to detect the entanglement of some Dicke states for any number of\nparticles, and such detection exhibits some robustness against white noise and\nthermal noise under the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian. In addition, it\ndetects the entanglement of spin-squeezed states, with a detection strength\nthat approaches the maximal value for sufficiently large numbers of particles.\nAs spin-squeezed states can be experimentally generated, the properties of the\nwitness with respect to these states may be amenable to experimental\ninvestigation. Finally, we show that while the witness is unable to detect GHZ\nstates, it is instead able to detect superpositions of Dicke states with GHZ\nstates.\n", "  We present numerical analysis of steady states in a two-component (spinor)\ndriven-dissipative quantum fluid formed by condensed exciton-polaritons in an\nannular optically induced trap. We demonstrate that an incoherent ring-shaped\noptical pump creating the exciton-polariton confinement supports the existence\nof stationary and rotating azimuthon steady states with azimuthally modulated\ndensity. Such states can be imprinted by coherent light pulses with a defined\norbital angular momentum, as well as generated spontaneously in the presence of\nthermal noise.\n", "  Fossil groups are expected to be the final product of galaxy merging within\ngalaxy groups. In simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass at\nhigh redshift. This early formation allows for the innermost $M^\\ast$ galaxies\nto merge into a massive central galaxy. Then, they are expected to maintain\ntheir fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scale\nstructure. In this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightest\ngalaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.\nAs a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamically\nrelaxed. In order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, we\nsystematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxy\nsubstructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems with\nredshift $z \\le 0.25$. We apply a number of tests in order to investigate the\nsubstructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projected\npositions out to $R_{200}$. Moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with at\nleast 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructure\nin the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces.\nAdditionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around the\ncentral galaxies. We find that an important fraction of fossil systems show\nsubstructure. The fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since each\ntest is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. Our interpretation\nof the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed as\nexpected from simulations. Our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil\nsystems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but our\nconclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected in\nnon-fossil clusters. THIS ABSTRACT IS TRUNCATED.\n", "  We measure the evolution of the quiescent fraction and quenching efficiency\nof satellites around star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with stellar\nmass $\\log(M_{\\mathrm{cen}}/M_{\\odot})>10.5$ at $0.3<z<2.5$. We combine imaging\nfrom three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (ZFOURGE/CANDELS, UDS, and\nUltraVISTA), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample of\nsatellites with $\\log(M_{\\mathrm{sat}}/M_{\\odot})>9.3$. Satellites for both\nstar-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractions\ncompared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also\nobserve \"galactic conformity\": satellites around quiescent centrals are more\nlikely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals.\nIn our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\\gtrsim3\\sigma$ for\n$0.6<z<1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3<z<0.6$ and\n$1.6<z<2.5$. Therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has been\npresent for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite\nquenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but\ndoes not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass\nlimit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of\nstar-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent\ncentrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity\nsignal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6<z<0.9$. This is\nevidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation properties\nof the central as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects\nthat may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow\nfor continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are\nquenched.\n", "  Energetics of nuclear reaction is fundamentally important to understand the\nmechanism of pair instability supernovae (PISNe). Based on the hydrodynamic\nequations and thermodynamic relations, we derive exact expressions for energy\nconservation suitable to be solved in simulation. We also show that some\nformulae commonly used in the literature are obtained as approximations of the\nexact expressions. We simulate the evolution of very massive stars of ~100-320\nMsun with zero- and 1/10 Zsun, and calculate further explosions as PISNe,\napplying each of the exact and approximate formulae. The calculations\ndemonstrate that the explosion properties of PISN, such as the mass range, the\n56Ni yield, and the explosion energy, are significantly affected by applying\nthe different energy generation rates. We discuss how these results affect the\nestimate of the PISN detection rate, which depends on the theoretical\npredictions of such explosion properties.\n", "  The atmospheric electric fields in thunderclouds have been shown to\nsignificantly modify the intensity and polarization patterns of the radio\nfootprint of cosmic-ray-induced extensive air showers. Simulations indicated a\nvery non-linear dependence of the signal strength in the frequency window of\n30-80 MHz on the magnitude of the atmospheric electric field. In this work we\npresent an explanation of this dependence based on Monte-Carlo simulations,\nsupported by arguments based on electron dynamics in air showers and expressed\nin terms of a simplified model. We show that by extending the frequency window\nto lower frequencies additional sensitivity to the atmospheric electric field\nis obtained.\n", "  Context. The classification of young stellar objects (YSOs) is typically done\nusing the infrared spectral slope or bolometric temperature, but either can\nresult in contamination of samples. More accurate methods to determine the\nevolutionary stage of YSOs will improve the reliability of statistics for the\nembedded YSO population and provide more robust stage lifetimes. Aims. We aim\nto separate the truly embedded YSOs from more evolved sources. Methods. Maps of\nHCO+ J=4-3 and C18O J=3-2 were observed with HARP on the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope (JCMT) for a sample of 56 candidate YSOs in Perseus and Taurus in\norder to characterize emission from high (column) density gas. These are\nsupplemented with archival dust continuum maps observed with SCUBA on the JCMT\nand Herschel PACS to compare the morphology of the gas and dust in the\nprotostellar envelopes. The spatial concentration of HCO+ J=4-3 and 850 micron\ndust emission are used to classify the embedded nature of YSOs. Results.\nApproximately 30% of Class 0+I sources in Perseus and Taurus are not Stage I,\nbut are likely to be more evolved Stage II pre-main sequence (PMS) stars with\ndisks. An additional 16% are confused sources with an uncertain evolutionary\nstage. Conclusions. Separating classifications by cloud reveals that a high\npercentage of the Class 0+I sources in the Perseus star forming region are\ntruly embedded Stage I sources (71%), while the Taurus cloud hosts a majority\nof evolved PMS stars with disks (68%). The concentration factor method is\nuseful to correct misidentified embedded YSOs, yielding higher accuracy for YSO\npopulation statistics and Stage timescales. Current estimates (0.54 Myr) may\noverpredict the Stage I lifetime on the order of 30%, resulting in timescales\nof 0.38 Myr for the embedded phase.\n", "  Applying the Ashok-Denef-Douglas estimation method to elliptic Calabi-Yau\nfourfolds suggests that a single elliptic fourfold ${\\cal M}_{\\rm max}$ gives\nrise to ${\\cal O} (10^{272,000})$ F-theory flux vacua, and that the sum total\nof the numbers of flux vacua from all other F-theory geometries is suppressed\nby a relative factor of ${\\cal O} (10^{-3000})$. The fourfold ${\\cal M}_{\\rm\nmax}$ arises from a generic elliptic fibration over a specific toric threefold\nbase $B_{\\rm max}$, and gives a geometrically non-Higgsable gauge group of\n$E_8^9 \\times F_4^8 \\times (G_2 \\times SU(2))^{16}$, of which we expect some\nfactors to be broken by G-flux to smaller groups. It is not possible to tune an\n$SU(5)$ GUT group on any further divisors in ${\\cal M}_{\\rm max}$, or even an\n$SU(2)$ or $SU(3)$, so the standard model gauge group appears to arise in this\ncontext only from a broken $E_8$ factor. The results of this paper can either\nbe interpreted as providing a framework for predicting how the standard model\narises most naturally in F-theory and the types of dark matter to be found in a\ntypical F-theory compactification, or as a challenge to string theorists to\nexplain why other choices of vacua are not exponentially unlikely compared to\nF-theory compactifications on ${\\cal M}_{\\rm max}$.\n", "  Stars generally form in aggregates, some of which are bound ('clusters')\nwhile others are unbound and disperse on short ($\\sim10$ Myr) timescales\n('associations'). The fraction of stars forming in bound clusters ($\\Gamma$) is\na fundamental outcome of the star formation process. Recent observational and\ntheoretical work has suggested that $\\Gamma$ increases with the gas surface\ndensity ($\\Sigma$) or star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}$), both within galaxies and between different ones. However, a recent\npaper by Chandar et al. has challenged these results, showing that the $total$\nnumber of stellar aggregates per unit SFR does not vary systematically with the\nhost galaxy's absolute SFR. In this Letter, we show that no variations are\nexpected when no distinction is made between bound and unbound aggregates,\nbecause the sum of these two fractions should be close to unity. We also\ndemonstrate that any scaling of $\\Gamma$ with the absolute SFR is much weaker\nthan with $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$, due to the mass-radius-SFR relation of\nstar-forming 'main sequence' galaxies. The environmental variation of $\\Gamma$\nshould therefore be probed as a function of area-normalised quantities, such as\n$\\Sigma$ or $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$. We present a set of guidelines for meaningful\nobservational tests of cluster formation theories and show that these resolve\nthe reported discrepancy.\n", "  We consider a spinless fermionic $p\\pm ip$ superfluid living on a\ntwo-dimensional sphere. Using superfluid hydrodynamics we show that the ground\nstate necessarily exhibits topological defects: either a pair of elementary\nvortices or a domain wall between $p\\pm ip$ phases. In the topologically\nnontrivial BCS phase we identify the chiral fermion modes localized on the\ntopological defects and compute their low-energy spectrum.\n", "  We describe a method for forecasting errors in interferometric measurements\nof polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, based on\nthe use of the Fisher matrix calculated from the visibility covariance and\nrelation matrices. In addition to noise and sample variance, the method can\naccount for many kinds of systematic error by calculating an augmented Fisher\nmatrix, including parameters that characterize the instrument along with the\ncosmological parameters to be estimated. The method is illustrated with\nexamples of gain errors and errors in polarizer orientation. The augmented\nFisher matrix approach is applicable to a much wider range of problems beyond\nCMB interferometry.\n", "  The {\\it Kepler} light curve of KIC 4739791 exhibits partial eclipses,\ninverse O'Connell effect, and multiperiodic pulsations. Including a starspot on\neither of the binary components, the light-curve synthesis indicates that KIC\n4739791 is in detached or semi-detached configurations with both a short\norbital period and a low mass ratio. Multiple frequency analyses were performed\nin the light residuals after subtracting the binarity effects from the original\n{\\it Kepler} data. We detected 14 frequencies: six in the low-frequency region\n(0.1$-$2.3 d$^{-1}$) and eight in the high-frequency region (18.2$-$22.0\nd$^{-1}$). Among these, six high frequencies with amplitudes of 0.62$-$1.97\nmmag were almost constant over time for 200 d. Their pulsation periods and\npulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.048$-$0.054 d and 0.025$-$0.031 d,\nrespectively. In contrast, the other frequencies may arise from the alias\neffects caused by the orbital frequency or combination frequencies. We propose\nthat KIC 4739791 is a short-period R CMa binary with the lowest mass ratio in\nthe known classical Algols and that its primary component is a $\\delta$ Sct\npulsating star. Only four R CMa stars have been identified, three of which\nexhibit $\\delta$ Sct-type oscillations. These findings make KIC 4739791 an\nattractive target for studies of stellar interior structure and evolution.\n", "  We present a quantum simulation method that follows the dynamics of\nout-of-equilibrium many-body systems of electrons and oscillators in real time.\nIts cost is linear in the number of oscillators and it can probe timescales\nfrom attoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds. Contrary to Ehrenfest dynamics, it\ncan thermalize starting from a variety of initial conditions, including\nelectronic population inversion. While an electronic temperature can be defined\nin terms of a non-equilibrium entropy, a Fermi-Dirac distribution in general\nemerges only after thermalization. The time evolution of the populations is\nrationalized in terms of a kinetic model.\n", "  We study the relation between elliptic flow, $v_2$ and the initial\neccentricity, $\\varepsilon_2$, in heavy-ion collisions, using hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Significant deviations from linear eccentricity scaling are seen\nin more peripheral collisions. We identify the mechanism responsible for these\ndeviations as a cubic response, which we argue is a generic property of the\nhydrodynamic response to the initial density profile. The cubic response\nincreases elliptic flow fluctuations, thereby improving agreement of initial\ncondition models with experimental data.\n", "  Transport properties of a suspension of solid particles in a viscous gas are\nstudied. The dissipation in such systems arises from two sources: inelasticity\nin particle collisions and viscous dissipation due to the effect of the gas\nphase on the particles. Here, we consider a simplified case in which the mean\nrelative velocity between the gas and solid phases is taken to be zero, such\nthat \"thermal drag\" is the only remaining gas-solid interaction. Unlike the\nprevious more general treatment of the drag force [Garz\\'o \\emph{et al.}, J.\nFluid Mech. \\textbf{712}, 129 (2012)], here we take into account contributions\nto the (scaled) transport coefficients $\\eta^*$ (shear viscosity), $\\kappa^*$\n(thermal conductivity) and $\\mu^*$ (Dufour-like coefficient) coming from the\ntemperature-dependence of the (dimensionless) friction coefficient $\\gamma^*$\ncharacterizing the amplitude of the drag force. At moderate densities, the\nthermal drag model (which is based on the Enskog kinetic equation) is solved by\nmeans of the Chapman-Enskog method and the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients\nare determined in terms of the coefficient of restitution, the solid volume\nfraction and the friction coefficient. The results indicate that the effect of\nthe gas phase on $\\eta^*$ and $\\mu^*$ is non-negligible (especially in the case\nof relatively dilute systems) while the form of $\\kappa^*$ is the same as the\none obtained in the dry granular limit. Finally, as an application of these\nresults, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations is carried\nout to analyze the conditions for stability of the homogeneous cooling state. A\ncomparison with direct numerical simulations shows a good agreement for\nconditions of practical interest.\n", "  We developed an algorithm to find and characterize gravitationally lensed\ngalaxies (arcs) to perform a comparison of the observed and simulated arc\nabundance. Observations are from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with\nHubble (CLASH). Simulated CLASH images are created using the MOKA package and\nalso clusters selected from the high resolution, hydrodynamical simulations,\nMUSIC, over the same mass and redshift range as the CLASH sample. The\nalgorithm' s arc elongation accuracy, completeness and false positive rate are\ndetermined and used to compute an estimate of the true arc abundance. We derive\na lensing efficiency of $4 \\pm 1$ arcs (with length $\\ge 6\"$ and\nlength-to-width ratio $\\ge 7$) per cluster for the X-ray selected CLASH sample,\n$4 \\pm 1$ arcs per cluster for the MOKA simulated sample and $3 \\pm 1$ arcs per\ncluster for the MUSIC simulated sample. The observed and simulated arc\nstatistics are in full agreement. We measure the photometric redshifts of all\ndetected arcs and find a median redshift $z_s = 1.9$ with 33% of the detected\narcs having $z_s > 3$. We find that the arc abundance does not depend strongly\non the source redshift distribution but is sensitive to the mass distribution\nof the dark matter halos (e.g. the $c-M$ relation). Our results show that\nconsistency between the observed and simulated distributions of lensed arc\nsizes and axial ratios can be achieved by using cluster-lensing simulations\nthat are carefully matched to the selection criteria used in the observations.\n", "  The entanglement entropy in many gapless quantum systems receives a\ncontribution from corners in the entangling surface in 2+1d. It is\ncharacterized by a universal function $a(\\theta)$ depending on the opening\nangle $\\theta$, and contains pertinent low energy information. For conformal\nfield theories (CFTs), the leading expansion coefficient in the smooth limit\n$\\theta \\to \\pi$ yields the stress tensor 2-point function coefficient $C_T$ .\nLittle is known about $a(\\theta)$ beyond that limit. Here, we show that the\nnext term in the smooth limit expansion contains information beyond the 2- and\n3-point correlators of the stress tensor. We conjecture that it encodes 4-point\ndata, making it much richer. Further, we establish strong constraints on this\nand higher order smooth-limit coefficients. We also show that $a(\\theta)$ is\nlower-bounded by a non-trivial function multiplied by the central charge $C_T$\n, e.g. $a(\\pi/2) \\geq (\\pi^2 \\ln 2)C_T /6$. This bound for 90-degree corners is\nnearly saturated by all known results, including recent numerics for the\ninteracting Wilson-Fisher quantum critical points (QCPs). A bound is also given\nfor the R\\'enyi entropies. We illustrate our findings using O(N) QCPs, free\nboson and Dirac fermion CFTs, strongly coupled holographic ones, and other\nmodels. Exact results are also given for Lifshitz quantum critical points, and\nfor conical singularities in 3+1d.\n", "  We present a sample of local red giant stars observed using the New Mexico\nState University 1 m telescope with the APOGEE spectrograph, for which we\nestimate stellar ages and the age distribution from the high-resolution\nspectroscopic stellar parameters and accurate distance measurements from\nHipparcos. The high-resolution (R ~ 23,000), near infrared (H-band, 1.5-1.7\nmicron) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmospheric\nparameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and [alpha/M]). Due to the\nsmaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectra\nand accurate Hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate the\nstellar masses to within 40%. For red giants, the relatively rapid evolution of\nstars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on the\nmass. We examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relation\ndirectly and a Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a\nconstant star formation history (SFH). To improve the prior on the SFH, we use\na hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model SFH\nfrom the age probability distribution functions of the data. The results of an\nalpha dependent Gaussian SFH model shows a clear relation between age and\n[alpha/M] at all ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical\nBayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution function\nand determine ages for individual stars. The age-metallicity relation is flat,\nwith a slight decrease in [M/H] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread in\nmetallicity. For stars with ages < 1 Gyr we find a smaller spread, consistent\nwith radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on the\nolder stars.\n", "  Enhanced continuum brightness is observed in many flares (''white light\nflares''), yet it is still unclear which processes contribute to the emission.\nTo understand the transport of energy needed to account for this emission, we\nmust first identify both the emission processes and the emission source\nregions. Possibilities include heating in the chromosphere causing optically\nthin or thick emission from free-bound transitions of Hydrogen, and heating of\nthe photosphere causing enhanced H$^-$ continuum brightness. To investigate\nthese possibilities, we combine observations from IRIS, SDO/HMI, and the\nground-based FIRS instrument, covering wavelengths in the far-UV, near-UV,\nvisible, and infrared during the X1 flare SOL20140329T17:48. Fits of blackbody\nspectra to infrared and visible wavelengths are reasonable, yielding radiation\ntemperatures $\\sim$6000-6300 K. The NUV emission, formed in the upper\nphotosphere under undisturbed conditions, exceeds these simple fits during the\nflare, requiring extra emission from the Balmer continuum in the chromosphere.\nThus, the continuum originates from enhanced radiation from photosphere\n(visible-IR) and chromosphere (NUV). From the standard thick-target flare\nmodel, we calculate the energy of the nonthermal electrons observed by RHESSI\nand compare it to the energy radiated by the continuum emission. We find that\nthe energy contained in most electrons $>$40 keV, or alternatively, of\n$\\sim$10-20% of electrons $>$20 keV is sufficient to explain the extra\ncontinuum emission of $\\sim4-8 \\times 10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Also,\nfrom the timing of the RHESSI HXR and the IRIS observations, we conclude that\nthe NUV continuum is emitted nearly instantaneously when HXR emission is\nobserved with a time difference of no more than 15 s.\n", "  The intrinsic lifetime of the upper level in the bound-bound 3d$^9$4s$^2$\n$^2$D$_{3/2}$ $\\rightarrow$ 3d$^9$4s$^2$ $^2$D$_{5/2}$ radiative transition in\nNi$^-$ was measured to be 15.1 $\\pm$ 0.4 s. The experiment was performed at\ncryogenic temperatures in one of the ion-beam storage rings of the DESIREE\n(Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring Experiment) facility at Stockholm University.\nThe storage lifetime of the Ni$^-$ ion-beam was measured to be close to five\nminutes at a ring temperature of 13 K.\n", "  We model neutron star cooling, in particular the current rapid cooldown of\nthe neutron star Cas A, with a microscopic nuclear equation of state featuring\nstrong direct Urca processes and using compatible nuclear pairing gaps as well\nas effective masses. Several scenarios are possible to explain the features of\nCas A, but only large and extended proton $^1S_0$ gaps and small neutron\n$^3PF_2$ gaps are able to accommodate also the major part of the complete\ncurrent cooling data. We conclude that the possibility of strong direct Urca\nprocesses cannot be excluded from the cooling analysis.\n", "  Centaurus A is the most nearby powerful AGN, widely studied at all\nwavelengths. Molecular gas has been found in the halo at a distance of ~20 kpc\nfrom the galaxy centre, associated with HI shells. The molecular gas lies\ninside some IR and UV bright star-forming filaments that have recently been\nobserved in the direction of the radio jets. These archival data show that\nthere is dust and very weak star formation on scales of hundreds of parsecs.\n  On top of analysing combined archival data, we have performed searches of\nHCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) emission with ATCA at the interaction of the northern\nfilaments and the HI shell of Cen A. Measuring the dense gas is another\nindicator of star formation efficiency inside the filaments. However, we only\nderived upper limits of 1.6x10^3 K.km/s.pc^2 at 3 sigma in the synthesised beam\nof 3.1\".\n  We also compared the CO masses with the SFR estimates in order to measure a\nstar formation efficiency. Using a standard conversion factor leads to long\ndepletion times (7 Gyr). We then corrected the mass estimates from metallicity\neffect by using gas-to-dust mass ratio as a proxy. From MUSE data, we estimated\nthe metallicity spread (0.4-0.8 Zsun) in the filament, corresponding to\ngas-to-dust ratios of ~200-400. The CO/H2 conversion ratio is corrected for low\nmetallicity by a factor between 1.4 and 3.2. Such a low-metallicity correction\nleads to even more massive clouds with higher depletion times (16 Gyr). We\nfinally present ALMA observations that detect 3 unresolved CO(2-1) clumps of\nsize <37x21 pc and masses around 10^4 Msun. The velocity width of the CO\nemission line is ~10 km/s, leading to a rather high virial parameter. This is a\nhint of a turbulent gas probably powered by kinetic energy injection from the\nAGN jet/wind and leading to molecular gas reservoir not forming star\nefficiently.\n", "  We derive average radial gradients in the dust attenuation towards HII\nregions in 609 galaxies at z~1.4, using measurements of the Balmer decrement\nout to r~3kpc. The Balmer decrements are derived from spatially resolved maps\nof Halpha and Hbeta emission from the 3D-HST survey. We find that with\nincreasing stellar mass (M) both the normalization and strength of the gradient\nin dust attenuation increases. Galaxies with a mean mass of <log(M)> = 9.2Msun\nhave little dust attenuation at all radii, whereas galaxies with <log(M)>=\n10.2Msun have dust attenuation toward Halpha A(Halpha)~2mag in their central\nregions. We parameterize this as A(Halpha) = b + c log(r), with b = 0.9 + 1.0\nlog(M10), c = -1.9 - 2.2 log(M10), r in kpc, and M10 the stellar mass in units\nof 10^10Msun. This expression can be used to correct spatially resolved\nmeasurements of Halpha to radial distributions of star formation. When applied\nto our data, we find that the star formation rates in the central r<1kpc of\ngalaxies in the highest mass bin are ~ 6 Msun/yr, six times higher than before\ncorrection and approximately half of the total star formation rate of these\ngalaxies. If this high central star formation rate is maintained for several\nGyr, a large fraction of the stars in present-day bulges likely formed in-situ.\n", "  The nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 1277 is thought to host one of the largest\nblack holes known, however the black hole mass measurement is based on low\nspatial resolution spectroscopy. In this paper, we present Gemini Near-infrared\nIntegral Field Spectrometer observations assisted by adaptive optics. We map\nout the galaxy's stellar kinematics within ~440 pc of the nucleus with an\nangular resolution that allows us to probe well within the region where the\npotential from the black hole dominates. We find that the stellar velocity\ndispersion rises dramatically, reaching ~550 km/s at the center. Through\norbit-based, stellar-dynamical models we obtain a black hole mass of (4.9 \\pm\n1.6) x 10^9 Msun (1-sigma uncertainties). Although the black hole mass\nmeasurement is smaller by a factor of ~3 compared to previous claims based on\nlarge-scale kinematics, NGC 1277 does indeed contain one of the most massive\nblack holes detected to date, and the black hole mass is an order of magnitude\nlarger than expectations from the empirical relation between black hole mass\nand galaxy luminosity. Given the galaxy's similarities to the higher redshift\n(z~2) massive quiescent galaxies, NGC 1277 could be a relic, passively evolving\nsince that period. A population of local analogs to the higher redshift\nquiescent galaxies that also contain over-massive black holes may suggest that\nblack hole growth precedes that of the host galaxy.\n", "  SuperSpec is a novel on-chip spectrometer we are developing for multi-object,\nmoderate resolution (R = 100 - 500), large bandwidth (~1.65:1) submillimeter\nand millimeter survey spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies. The spectrometer\nemploys a filter bank architecture, and consists of a series of half-wave\nresonators formed by lithographically-patterned superconducting transmission\nlines. The signal power admitted by each resonator is detected by a lumped\nelement titanium nitride (TiN) kinetic inductance detector (KID) operating at\n100 - 200 MHz. We have tested a new prototype device that achieves the targeted\nR = 100 resolving power, and has better detector sensitivity and optical\nefficiency than previous devices. We employ a new method for measuring photon\nnoise using both coherent and thermal sources of radiation to cleanly separate\nthe contributions of shot and wave noise. We report an upper limit to the\ndetector NEP of $1.4\\times10^{-17}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$, within 10% of the photon\nnoise limited NEP for a ground-based R=100 spectrometer.\n", "  The M101 galaxy contains the best-known example of an ultraluminous supersoft\nsource (ULS), dominated by a thermal component at kT ~ 0.1 keV. The origin of\nthe thermal component and the relation between ULSs and standard (broad-band\nspectrum) ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are still controversial. We\nre-examined the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the M101 ULS using\narchival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We show that the X-ray\ntime-variability and spectral properties are inconsistent with standard disk\nemission. The characteristic radius R_{bb} of the thermal emitter varies from\nepoch to epoch between ~10,000 km and ~100,000 km; the colour temperature\nkT_{bb} varies between ~50 eV and ~140 eV; and the two quantities scale\napproximately as R_{bb} ~ T_{bb}^{-2}. In addition to the smooth continuum, we\nalso find (at some epochs) spectral residuals well fitted with thermal plasma\nmodels and absorption edges: we interpret this as evidence that we are looking\nat a clumpy, multi-temperature outflow. We suggest that at sufficiently high\naccretion rates and inclination angles, the super-critical, radiatively driven\noutflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely thermalizes the\nharder X-ray photons from the inner part of the inflow, removing the hard\nspectral tail. We develop a simple, spherically symmetric outflow model and\nshow that it is consistent with the observed temperatures, radii and\nluminosities. A larger, cooler photosphere shifts the emission peak into the\nfar-UV and makes the source dimmer in X-rays but possibly ultraluminous in the\nUV. We compare our results and interpretation with those of Liu et al. (2013).\n", "  Using the Tully-Fisher relation, we derive peculiar velocities for the 2MASS\nTully-Fisher Survey and describe the velocity field of the nearby Universe. We\nuse adaptive kernel smoothing to map the velocity field, and compare it to\nreconstructions based on the redshift space galaxy distributions of the 2MASS\nRedshift Survey (2MRS) and the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey\n(PSCz). With a standard $\\chi^2$ minimization fit to the models, we find that\nthe PSCz model provides a better fit to the 2MTF velocity field data than does\nthe 2MRS model, and provides a value of $\\beta$ in greater agreement with\nliterature values. However, when we subtract away the monopole deviation in the\nvelocity zeropoint between data and model, the 2MRS model also produces a value\nof $\\beta$ in agreement with literature values. We also calculate the `residual\nbulk flow': the component of the bulk flow not accounted for by the models.\nThis is $\\sim 250$ km/s when performing the standard fit, but drops to $\\sim\n150$ km/s for both models when the aforementioned monopole offset between data\nand models is removed. This smaller number is more in line with theoretical\nexpectations, and suggests that the models largely account for the major\nstructures in the nearby Universe responsible for the bulk velocity.\n", "  Our article is devoted to the study of the rare $B\\to K^\\ast\n\\ell^+\\ell^-$~decay where $\\ell=e,\\mu,\\tau$. We compute the relevant form\nfactors in the framework of the covariant quark model with infrared confinement\nin the full kinematical momentum transfer region. The calculated form factors\nare used to evaluate branching fractions and polarization observables in the\ncascade decay $B\\to K^\\ast(\\to K\\pi)\\ell^+\\ell^-$. We compare the obtained\nresults with available experimental data and the results from other theoretical\napproaches.\n", "  We explore the electron neutrino signals from light dark matter (DM)\nannihilation in the Sun for the large liquid scintillator detector JUNO. In\nterms of the spectrum features of three typical DM annihilation channels $\\chi\n\\chi \\rightarrow \\nu \\bar{\\nu},\\tau^+ \\tau^-, b \\bar{b}$, we take two sets of\nselection conditions to calculate the expected signals and atmospheric neutrino\nbackgrounds based on the Monte Carlo simulation data. Then the JUNO\nsensitivities to the spin independent DM-nucleon and spin dependent DM-proton\ncross sections are presented. It is found that the JUNO projected sensitivities\nare much better than the current spin dependent direct detection experimental\nlimits for the $\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ and $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ channels. In the spin\nindependent case, the JUNO will give the better sensitivity to the DM-nucleon\ncross section than the LUX and CDMSlite limits for the $\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ channel\nwith the DM mass lighter than 6.5 GeV. If the $\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ or $\\tau^+\n\\tau^-$ channel is dominant, the future JUNO results are very helpful for us to\nunderstand the tension between the DAMA annual modulation signal and other\ndirect detection exclusions.\n", "  We present a sample of 38 intervening Damped Lyman $\\alpha$ (DLA) systems\nidentified towards 100 $z>3.5$ quasars, observed during the XQ-100 survey. The\nXQ-100 DLA sample is combined with major DLA surveys in the literature. The\nfinal combined sample consists of 742 DLAs over a redshift range approximately\n$1.6 < z_{\\rm abs} < 5.0$. We develop a novel technique for computing\n$\\Omega_{\\rm HI}^{\\rm DLA}$ as a continuous function of redshift, and we\nthoroughly assess and quantify the sources of error therein, including fitting\nerrors and incomplete sampling of the high column density end of the column\ndensity distribution function. There is a statistically significant redshift\nevolution in $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}^{\\rm DLA}$ ($\\geq 3 \\sigma$) from $z \\sim 2$ to\n$z \\sim$ 5. In order to make a complete assessment of the redshift evolution of\n$\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$, we combine our high redshift DLA sample with absorption\nsurveys at intermediate redshift and 21cm emission line surveys of the local\nuniverse. Although $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}^{\\rm DLA}$, and hence its redshift\nevolution, remains uncertain in the intermediate redshift regime ($0.1 < z_{\\rm\nabs} < 1.6$), we find that the combination of high redshift data with 21cm\nsurveys of the local universe all yield a statistically significant evolution\nin $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ from $z \\sim 0$ to $z \\sim 5$ ($\\geq 3 \\sigma$). Despite\nits statistical significance, the magnitude of the evolution is small: a linear\nregression fit between $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ and $z$ yields a typical slope of\n$\\sim$0.17$\\times 10^{-3}$, corresponding to a factor of $\\sim$ 4 decrease in\n$\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ between $z=5$ and $z=0$.\n", "  We report the detection of a possible gamma-ray counterpart of the accreting\nmillisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The analysis of ~6 years of data from the\nLarge Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi-LAT)\nwithin a region of 15deg radius around the position of the pulsar reveals a\npoint gamma-ray source detected at a significance of ~6 sigma (Test Statistic\nTS = 32), with position compatible with that of SAX J1808.4-3658 within 95%\nConfidence Level. The energy flux in the energy range between 0.6 GeV and 10\nGeV amounts to (2.1 +- 0.5) x 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 and the spectrum is\nwell-represented by a power-law function with photon index 2.1 +- 0.1. We\nsearched for significant variation of the flux at the spin frequency of the\npulsar and for orbital modulation, taking into account the trials due to the\nuncertainties in the position, the orbital motion of the pulsar and the\nintrinsic evolution of the pulsar spin. No significant deviation from a\nconstant flux at any time scale was found, preventing a firm identification via\ntime variability. Nonetheless, the association of the LAT source as the\ngamma-ray counterpart of SAX J1808.4-3658 would match the emission expected\nfrom the millisecond pulsar, if it switches on as a rotation-powered source\nduring X-ray quiescence.\n", "  Characterization of the minute cosmic microwave background polarization\nsignature requires multi-frequency, high-throughput precision instrument\nsystems. We have previously described the detector fabrication of a 40 GHz\nfocal plane and now describe the fabrication of detector modules for\nmeasurement of the CMB at 90 GHz. The 90 GHz detectors are a scaled version of\nthe 40 GHz architecture where, due to smaller size detectors, we have\nimplemented a modular (wafer level) rather than the chip-level architecture.\nThe new fabrication process utilizes the same design rules with the added\nchallenge of increased wiring density to the 74 TES's as well as a new wafer\nlevel hybridization procedure. The hexagonally shaped modules are tile-able,\nand as such, can be used to form the large focal planes required for a\nspace-based CMB polarimeter. The detectors described here will be deployed in\ntwo focal planes with 7 modules each in the Johns Hopkins University led\nground-based Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) telescope.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a z=1.58 mature cluster around the\nhigh-redshift radio galaxy 7C1753+6311, first identified in the Clusters Around\nRadio-Loud AGN survey. Two-thirds of the excess galaxies within the central\n1Mpc lie on a red sequence with a colour that is consistent with an average\nformation redshift of zf~3. We show that 80+/-6% of the red sequence galaxies\nin the cluster core are quiescent, while the remaining 20% are red due to dusty\nstar formation. We demonstrate that the cluster has an enhanced quiescent\ngalaxy fraction that is three times that of the control field. We also show\nthat this enhancement is mass dependent: 91+/-9% of the M* >10^{10.5}Msun\ncluster galaxies are quiescent, compared to only 36+/-2% of field galaxies,\nwhereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies with lower masses is the same in the\ncluster and field environments. The presence of a dense core and a well-formed,\nquiescent red sequence suggest that this is a mature cluster. This means that\ndistant radio galaxies do not solely reside in young, uncollapsed\nprotoclusters, rather they can be found in clusters in a wide range of\nevolutionary states.\n", "  Ultraluminous supersoft sources (ULSs) are defined by a thermal spectrum with\ncolour temperatures ~0.1 keV, bolometric luminosities ~ a few 10^39 erg/s, and\nalmost no emission above 1 keV. It has never been clear how they fit into the\ngeneral scheme of accreting compact objects. To address this problem, we\nstudied a sample of seven ULSs with extensive Chandra and XMM-Newton coverage.\nWe find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermal\nemitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius or\ntemperature. We compare the physical parameters of ULSs with those of classical\nsupersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and of\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), thought to be super-Eddington stellar-mass\nblack holes. We argue that ULSs are the sub-class of ULXs seen through the\ndensest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. We suggest\nthat in ULSs, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick and\nforms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. Our model\npredicts that when the photosphere expands to >10,000 km and the temperature\ndecreases below approximately 50 eV, ULSs become brighter in the far-UV but\nundetectable in X-rays. Conversely, we find that harder emission components\nbegin to appear in ULSs when the fitted size of the thermal emitter is smallest\n(interpreted as a shrinking of the photosphere). The observed short-term\nvariability and absorption edges are also consistent with clumpy outflows. We\nsuggest that the transition between ULXs (with a harder tail) and ULSs (with\nonly a soft thermal component) occurs at blackbody temperatures of\napproximately 150 eV.\n", "  We present an attempt to formulate an action for the worldvolume theory of a\nsingle M5-brane, based on the splitting of the six worldvolume directions into\n2+4, which breaks manifest Lorentz invariance from $SO(1,5)$ to $SO(1,1)\\times\nSO(4)$. To this end, an action for the free six--dimensional (2,0) chiral\ntensor multiplet, and separately, a nonlinearly interacting chiral 2-form\naction are constructed. By studying the Lagrangian formulation for the chiral\n2-form with 2+4 splitting, it is suggested that, if exists, the modified\ndiffeomorphism of the theory on curved six--dimensional space--time is less\ntrivial than its 1+5 and 3+3 counterpart, thus hindering the coupling of the\nchiral 2-form to the induced metric on the worldvolume of the M5-brane. We\ndiscuss difficulties of further generalisation of the theory. Finally, in terms\nof Hamiltonian analysis, we show that the naively gauge-fixed\nfailed-PST-covariantised Lagrangian has the correct number of degrees of\nfreedom, and satisfies the hyper--surface deformation algebra.\n", "  Our goal is to provide a robust estimate of the metal content of the ICM in\nmassive clusters. We make use of published abundance profiles for a sample of\n~60 nearby systems, we include in our estimate uncertainties associated to the\nmeasurement process and to the almost total lack of measures in cluster\noutskirts. We perform a first, albeit rough, census of metals finding that the\nmean abundance of the ICM within r_180 is very poorly constrained, 0.06Z_sol <\nZ < 0.26Z_sol, and presents no tension with expectations. Similarly, the\nquestion of if and how the bulk of the metal content in clusters varies with\ncosmic time, is very much an open one. A solid estimate of abundances in\ncluster outskirts could be achieved by combining observations of the two\nexperiments which will operate on board Athena, the XIFU and the WFI, provided\nthey do not fall victim to the de-scoping process that has afflicted several\nspace observatories over the last decade.\n", "  Line-of-sight velocities of gas and stars can constrain dark matter (DM)\nwithin rotationally supported galaxies if they trace circular orbits\nextensively. Photometric asymmetries may signify non-circular motions,\nrequiring spectra with dense spatial coverage. Our integral-field spectroscopy\nof 178 galaxies spanned the mass range of the SAMI Galaxy Survey. We derived\ncircular speed curves (CSCs) of gas and stars from non-parametric Diskfit fits\nout to $r\\sim2r_e$. For 12/14 with measured H I profiles, ionized gas and H I\nmaximum velocities agreed. We fitted mass-follows-light models to 163 galaxies\nby approximating the radial starlight profile as nested, very flattened mass\nhomeoids viewed as a S\\'ersic form. Fitting broad-band SEDs to SDSS images gave\nmedian stellar mass/light 1.7 assuming a Kroupa IMF vs. 2.6 dynamically.\nTwo-thirds of the dynamical mass/light measures were consistent with\nstar+remnant IMFs. One-fifth required upscaled starlight to fit, hence\ncomparable mass of unobserved baryons and/or DM distributed similarly across\nthe SAMI aperture that came to dominate motions as the starlight CSC declined\nrapidly. The rest had mass distributed differently from starlight. Subtracting\nfits of S\\'ersic profiles to 13 VIKING Z-band images revealed residual weak\nbars. Near the bar PA, we assessed m = 2 streaming velocities, and found\ndeviations usually <30 km/s from the CSC; three showed no deviation. Thus,\nasymmetries rarely influenced our CSCs despite co-located shock-indicating,\nemission-line flux ratios in more than 2/3.\n", "  We perform a general analysis of axionic dark radiation produced from the\ndecay of the lightest modulus in the sequestered LARGE Volume Scenario. We\ndiscuss several cases depending on the form of the Kahler metric for visible\nsector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a de Sitter\nvacuum. The leading decay channels which determine dark radiation predictions\nare to hidden sector axions, visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending\non their mass. We show that in most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like\nmodels squarks and sleptons are heavier than the lightest modulus. Hence dark\nradiation predictions previously obtained for MSSM-like cases hold more\ngenerally also for split SUSY-like cases since the decay channel to SUSY\nscalars is kinematically forbidden. However the inclusion of string loop\ncorrections to the Kahler potential gives rise to a parameter space region\nwhere the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up, leading to a significant\nreduction of dark radiation production. In this case, the simplest model with a\nshift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress the excess of dark radiation $\\Delta\nN_{eff}$ to values as small as 0.14, in perfect agreement with current\nexperimental bounds. Depending on the exact mass of the SUSY scalars all values\nin the range 0.14 $\\lesssim \\Delta N_{eff} \\lesssim$ 1.6 are allowed.\nInterestingly dark radiation overproduction can be avoided also in the absence\nof a Giudice-Masiero coupling.\n", "  The main goal of this study is to compile a catalogue including the\nfundamental parameters of a complete sample of 277 star clusters (SCs) of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed in the Washington photometric system,\nincluding 82 clusters very recently studied by us. All the clusters' parameters\nsuch as radii, deprojected distances, reddenings, ages and metallicities have\nbeen obtained by appyling essentially the same procedures which are briefly\ndescribed here. We have used empirical cumulative distribution functions to\nexamine age, metallicity and deprojected distance distributions for different\ncluster subsamples of the catalogue. Our new sample made up of 82 additional\nclusters recently studied by us represents about a 40% increase in the total\nnumber of LMC SCs observed up to now in the Washington photometric system. In\nparticular, we report here the fundamental parameters obtained for the first\ntime for 42 of these clusters. We found that single LMC SCs are typically older\nthan multiple SCs. Both single and multiple SCs exhibit asymmetrical\ndistributions in log (age). We compared cluster ages derived through isochrone\nfittings obtained using different models of the Padova group. Although $t_G$\nand $t_B$ ages obtained using isochrones from Girardi et al. (2002) and Bressan\net al. (2012), respectively, are consistent in general terms, we found that\n$t_B$ values are not only typically larger than $t_G$ ages but also that\nBressan et al.'s age uncertainties are clearly smaller than the corresponding\nGirardi et al. values.\n", "  Pulsars are known to display short-term variability. Recently, examples of\nlonger-term emission variability have emerged that are often correlated with\nchanges in the rotational properties of the pulsar. To further illuminate this\nrelationship, we have developed techniques to identify emission and rotation\nvariability in pulsar data, and determine correlations between the two.\nIndividual observations may be too noisy to identify subtle changes in the\npulse profile. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to model noisy\nobservations and produce a continuous map of pulse profile variability.\nGenerally, multiple observing epochs are required to obtain the pulsar spin\nfrequency derivative ($\\dot{\\nu}$). GP regression is, therefore, also used to\nobtain $\\dot{\\nu}$, under the hypothesis that pulsar timing noise is primarily\ncaused by unmodelled changes in $\\dot{\\nu}$. Our techniques distinguish between\ntwo types of variability: changes in the total flux density versus changes in\nthe pulse shape. We have applied these techniques to 168 pulsars observed by\nthe Parkes radio telescope, and see that although variations in flux density\nare ubiquitous, substantial changes in the shape of the pulse profile are rare.\nWe reproduce previously published results and present examples of profile shape\nchanging in seven pulsars; in particular, a clear new example of correlated\nchanges in profile shape and rotation is found in PSR~J1602$-$5100. In the\nshape changing pulsars, a more complex picture than the previously proposed two\nstate model emerges. We conclude that our simple assumption that all timing\nnoise can be interpreted as $\\dot{\\nu}$ variability is insufficient to explain\nour dataset.\n", "  In area and depth, the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3$\\pi$ survey is unique among\nmany-epoch, multi-band surveys and has enormous potential for all-sky\nidentification of variable sources. PS1 has observed the sky typically seven\ntimes in each of its five bands ($grizy$) over 3.5 years, but unlike SDSS not\nsimultaneously across the bands. Here we develop a new approach for quantifying\nstatistical properties of non-simultaneous, sparse, multi-color lightcurves\nthrough light-curve structure functions, effectively turning PS1 into a $\\sim\n35$-epoch survey. We use this approach to estimate variability amplitudes and\ntimescales $(\\omega_r, \\tau)$ for all point-sources brighter than\n$r_{\\mathrm{P1}}=21.5$ mag in the survey. With PS1 data on SDSS Stripe 82 as\n``ground truth\", we use a Random Forest Classifier to identify QSOs and RR\nLyrae based on their variability and their mean PS1 and WISE colors. We find\nthat, aside from the Galactic plane, QSO and RR Lyrae samples of purity\n$\\sim$75\\% and completeness $\\sim$92\\% can be selected. On this basis we have\nidentified a sample of $\\sim 1,000,000$ QSO candidates, as well as an\nunprecedentedly large and deep sample of $\\sim$150,000 RR Lyrae candidates with\ndistances from $\\sim$10 kpc to $\\sim$120 kpc. Within the Draco dwarf\nspheroidal, we demonstrate a distance precision of 6\\% for RR Lyrae candidates.\nWe provide a catalog of all likely variable point sources and likely QSOs in\nPS1, a total of $25.8\\times 10^6$ sources.\n", "  We explore how well James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra will likely\nconstrain bulk atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets. We start by\nmodeling the atmospheres of archetypal hot Jupiter, warm Neptune, warm\nsub-Neptune, and cool super-Earth planets with clear, cloudy, or high mean\nmolecular weight atmospheres. Next we simulate the $\\lambda = 1 - 11$ $\\mu$m\ntransmission and emission spectra of these systems for several JWST instrument\nmodes for single transit and eclipse events. We then perform retrievals to\ndetermine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (CH$_4$, CO,\nCO$_2$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$) can be constrained. We find that $\\lambda = 1 - 2.5$\n$\\mu$m transmission spectra will often constrain the major molecular\nconstituents of clear solar composition atmospheres well. Cloudy or high mean\nmolecular weight atmospheres will often require full $1 - 11$ $\\mu$m spectra\nfor good constraints, and emission data may be more useful in cases of\nsufficiently high $F_p$ and high $F_p/F_*$. Strong temperature inversions in\nthe solar composition hot Jupiter atmosphere should be detectable with $1 -\n2.5+$ $\\mu$m emission spectra, and $1 - 5+$ $\\mu$m emission spectra will\nconstrain the temperature-pressure profiles of warm planets. Transmission\nspectra over $1 - 5+$ $\\mu$m will constrain [Fe/H] values to better than 0.5\ndex for the clear atmospheres of the hot and warm planets studied.\nCarbon-to-oxygen ratios can be constrained to better than a factor of 2 in some\nsystems. We expect that these results will provide useful predictions of the\nscientific value of single event JWST spectra until its on-orbit performance is\nknown.\n", "  The optical classification of a Seyfert galaxy and whether it is considered\nX-ray absorbed are often used interchangeably. But there are many borderline\ncases and also numerous examples where the optical and X-ray classifications\nappear to be in conflict. In this article we re-visit the relation between\noptical obscuration and X-ray absorption in AGNs. We make use of our \"dust\ncolor\" method (Burtscher et al. 2015) to derive the optical obscuration A_V and\nconsistently estimated X-ray absorbing columns using 0.3--150 keV spectral\nenergy distributions. We also take into account the variable nature of the\nneutral gas column N_H and derive the Seyfert sub-classes of all our objects in\na consistent way.\n  We show in a sample of 25 local, hard-X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies (log\nL_X / (erg/s) ~ 41.5 - 43.5) that there can actually be a good agreement\nbetween optical and X-ray classification. If Seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9 are\nconsidered unobscured, the threshold between X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed\nshould be chosen at a column N_H = 10^22.3 / cm^2 to be consistent with the\noptical classification.\n  We find that N_H is related to A_V and that the N_H/A_V ratio is\napproximately Galactic or higher in all sources, as indicated previously. But\nin several objects we also see that deviations from the Galactic ratio are only\ndue to a variable X-ray column, showing that (1) deviations from the Galactic\nN_H/A_V can simply be explained by dust-free neutral gas within the broad line\nregion in some sources, that (2) the dust properties in AGNs can be similar to\nGalactic dust and that (3) the dust color method is a robust way to estimate\nthe optical extinction towards the sublimation radius in all but the most\nobscured AGNs.\n", "  Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) are an extreme star-bursting\npopulation of galaxies that were far more common at earlier epochs than today.\nBased on spectroscopic and photometric measurements of LCBGs in massive (M\n>10^15 M_sun), intermediate redshift (0.5 < z < 0.9) galaxy clusters, we\npresent their rest-frame properties including star-formation rate, dynamical\nmass, size, luminosity, and metallicity. The appearance of these small, compact\ngalaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift helps explain the observed\nredshift evolution in the size-luminosity relationship among cluster galaxies.\nIn addition, we find the rest-frame properties of LCBGs appearing in galaxy\nclusters are indistinguishable from field LCBGs at the same redshift. Up to 35%\nof the LCBGs show significant discrepancies between optical and infrared\nindicators of star formation, suggesting that star formation occurs in obscured\nregions. Nonetheless, the star formation for LCBGs shows a decrease toward the\ncenter of the galaxy clusters. Based on their position and velocity, we\nestimate that up to 10% of cluster LCBGs are likely to merge with another\ncluster galaxy. Finally, the observed properties and distributions of the LCBGs\nin these clusters lead us to conclude that we are witnessing the quenching of\nthe progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies that dominate the number density\nof present-epoch galaxy clusters.\n", "  The classification \"early-type\" galaxy includes both elliptically- and\nlenticular-shaped galaxies. Theoretically, the spheroid-to-disc flux ratio of\nan early-type galaxy can assume any positive value, but in practice studies\noften consider only spheroid/disc decompositions in which the disc neatly\ndominates over the spheroid at large galaxy radii, creating an inner \"bulge\" as\nobserved in most spiral galaxies. Here we show that decompositions in which the\ndisc remains embedded within the spheroid, labelled by some as \"unphysical\",\ncorrectly reproduce both the photometric and kinematic properties of early-type\ngalaxies with intermediate-scale discs. Intermediate-scale discs have often\nbeen confused with large-scale discs and incorrectly modelled as such; when\nthis happens, the spheroid luminosity is considerably underestimated. This has\nrecently led to some surprising conclusions, such as the claim that a number of\ngalaxies with intermediate-scale discs (Mrk 1216, NGC 1277, NGC 1271, and NGC\n1332) host a central black hole whose mass is abnormally large compared to\nexpectations from the (underestimated) spheroid luminosity. We show that when\nthese galaxies are correctly modelled, they no longer appear as extreme\noutliers in the (black hole mass)-(spheroid mass) diagram. This not only\nnullifies the need for invoking different evolutionary scenarios for these\ngalaxies but it strengthens the significance of the observed (black hole\nmass)-(spheroid mass) correlation and confirms its importance as a fundamental\ningredient for theoretical and semi-analytic models used to describe the\ncoevolution of spheroids and their central supermassive black holes.\n", "  The coupled gravitational-electromagnetic quasinormal resonances of charged\nrotating Kerr-Newman black holes are explored. In particular, using the\nrecently published numerical data of Dias, Godazgar, and Santos [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 114, 151101 (2015)], we show that the characteristic relaxation times\n$\\tau\\equiv 1/\\Im\\omega_0$ of near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in the\nregime $Q/r_+\\leq 0.9$ are described, to a very good degree of accuracy, by the\nsimple universal relation $\\tau\\times T_{\\text{BH}}=\\pi^{-1}$ (here $Q, r_+$,\nand $T_{\\text{BH}}$ are respectively the electric charge, horizon radius, and\ntemperature of the Kerr-Newman black hole, and $\\omega_0$ is the fundamental\nquasinormal resonance of the perturbed black-hole spacetime).\n", "  We present results based on follow-up observations of the Type II-plateau\nsupernova (SN) 2013ej at 6 epochs spanning a total duration of $\\sim$37 d. The\n$R_{c}$-band linear polarimetric observations were carried out between the end\nof the plateau and the beginning of the nebular phases as noticed in the\nphotometric light curve. The contribution due to interstellar polarization\n(ISP) was constrained by using couple of approaches, i.e. based upon the\nobservations of foreground stars lying within 5\\arcmin\\, and 10$\\degr$ radius\nof the SN location and also investigating the extinction due to the Milky Way\nand host galaxy towards the SN direction. Our analysis revealed that in general\nthe intrinsic polarization of the SN is higher than the polarization values for\nthe foreground stars and exhibits an increasing trend during our observations.\nAfter correcting the ISP of $\\sim$0.6 per cent, the maximum intrinsic\npolarization of SN~2013ej is found to be 2.14 $\\pm$ 0.57 per cent. Such a\nstrong polarization has rarely been seen in Type II-P SNe. If this is the case,\ni.e., the `polarization bias' effect is still negligible, the polarization\ncould be attributed to the asymmetry of the inner ejecta of the SN because the\nISP towards the SN location is estimated to be, at most, 0.6 per cent.\n", "  We discuss here a purely hydrodynamical mechanism to invert the sign of the\nkinetic helicity, which plays a key role in determining the direction of\npropagation of cyclical magnetism in most models of dynamo action by rotating\nconvection. Such propagation provides a prominent, and puzzling constraint on\ndynamo models. In the Sun, active regions emerge first at mid-latitudes, then\nappear nearer the equator over the course of a cycle, but most previous\nglobal-scale dynamo simulations have exhibited poleward propagation (if they\nwere cyclical at all). Here, we highlight some simulations in which the\ndirection of propagation of dynamo waves is altered primarily by an inversion\nof the kinetic helicity throughout much of the interior, rather than by changes\nin the differential rotation. This tends to occur in cases with a low Prandtl\nnumber and internal heating, in regions where the local density gradient is\nrelatively small. We analyse how this inversion arises, and contrast it to the\ncase of convection that is either highly columnar (i.e., rapidly rotating) or\nlocally very stratified; in both of those situations, the typical profile of\nkinetic helicity (negative throughout most of the northern hemisphere) instead\nprevails.\n", "  Gaps between Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)\neducation and required workplace skills have been identified in industry,\nacademia, and government. Educators acknowledge the need to reform STEM\neducation to better prepare students for their future careers. We pursue this\ngrowing interest in the skills needed for STEM disciplines and ask whether\nframeworks for 21st century skills and engineering education cover all of\nimportant STEM competencies. In this study, we identify important STEM\ncompetencies and evaluate the relevance of current frameworks applied in\neducation using the standardized job-specific database operated and maintained\nby the United States Department of Labor. Our analysis of the importance of 109\nskills, types of knowledge and work activities, revealed 18 skills, seven\ncategories of knowledge, and 27 work activities important for STEM workers. We\ninvestigate the perspectives of STEM and non-STEM job incumbents, comparing the\nimportance of each skill, knowledge, and work activity for the two groups. We\naimed to condense dimensions of the 52 key areas by categorizing them according\nto the Katz and Kahn (1978) framework and testing for inter-rater reliability.\nOur findings show frameworks for 21st century skills and engineering education\ndo not encompass all important STEM competencies. Implications for STEM\neducation programs are discussed, including how they can bridge gaps between\neducation and important workplace competencies.\n", "  The infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of $z\\gtrsim 5$ quasars can\nbe reproduced by combining a low-metallicity galaxy template with a standard\nAGN template. The host galaxy is represented by Haro 11, a compact, moderately\nlow metallicity, star-bursting galaxy that shares typical features of high-$z$\ngalaxies. For the vast majority of $z\\gtrsim 5$ quasars, the AGN contribution\nis well modeled by a standard empirical template with the contamination of star\nformation in the infrared subtracted. Together, these two templates can\nseparate the contributions from the host galaxy and the AGN even in the case of\nlimited data points, given that this model has only two free parameters. Using\nthis method, we re-analyze 69 $z\\gtrsim 5$ quasars with extensive Herschel\nobservations, and derive their AGN luminosities $L_{\\rm AGN}$ in a range $\\sim\n(0.78-27.4) \\times10^{13}\\, L_{\\odot}$, the infrared luminosities from star\nformation $L_{\\rm SF,IR} \\sim (<1.5-25.7)\\times10^{12}\\, L_{\\odot}$, and the\ncorresponding star formation rates ${\\rm SFR}\\sim (<290-2650)\\, M_\\odot/{\\rm\nyr}$. The average infrared luminosity from star formation and the average total\nAGN luminosity of the $z\\gtrsim5$ quasar sample follows the correlation defined\nby quasars at $z < 2.6$. We assume these quasar host galaxies maintain a\nconstant average SFR ($\\sim620\\, M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$) during their mass assembly\nand estimate the stellar mass that could form till $z\\sim5-6$ to be $\\langle\nM_* \\rangle \\sim(3-5)\\times10^{11} M_\\odot$. Combining with the black hole (BH)\nmass measurements, this stellar mass is adequate to establish a BH-galaxy mass\nratio $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}$ at 0.1-1%, consistent with the local relation.\n", "  When inferring parameters from a Gaussian-distributed data set by computing a\nlikelihood, a covariance matrix is needed that describes the data errors and\ntheir correlations. If the covariance matrix is not known a priori, it may be\nestimated and thereby becomes a random object with some intrinsic uncertainty\nitself. We show how to infer parameters in the presence of such an estimated\ncovariance matrix, by marginalising over the true covariance matrix,\nconditioned on its estimated value. This leads to a likelihood function that is\nno longer Gaussian, but rather an adapted version of a multivariate\nt-distribution, which has the same numerical complexity as the multivariate\nGaussian. As expected, marginalisation over the true covariance matrix improves\ninference when compared with Hartlap et al.'s method, which uses an unbiased\nestimate of the inverse covariance matrix but still assumes that the likelihood\nis Gaussian.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of bright and faint galaxies in fossil and\nnon-fossil groups. We used mock galaxies constructed based on the Millennium\nrun simulation II. We identified fossil groups at redshift zero according to\ntwo different selection criteria, and then built reliable control samples of\nnon-fossil groups that reproduce the fossil virial mass and assembly time\ndistributions. The faint galaxies were defined as having r-band absolute\nmagnitudes in the range [-16,-11]. We analysed the properties of the bright and\nfaint galaxies in fossil and non-fossil groups during the past 8 Gyr. We\nobserved that the brightest galaxy in fossil groups is typically brighter and\nmore massive than their counterparts in control groups. Fossil groups developed\ntheir large magnitude gap between the brightest galaxies around 3.5 Gyr ago.\nThe brightest galaxy stellar masses of all groups show a notorious increment at\nthat time. By analysing the behaviour of the magnitude gap between the first\nand the second, third, and fourth ranked galaxies, we found that at earlier\ntimes, fossil groups comprised two large brightest galaxies with similar\nmagnitudes surrounded by much fainter galaxies, while in control groups these\nmagnitude gaps were never as large as in fossils. At early times, fossil groups\nin the faint population were denser than non-fossil groups, then this trend\nreversed, and finally they became similar at the present day. The mean number\nof faint galaxies in non-fossil systems increases in an almost constant rate\ntowards later times, while this number in fossil groups reaches a plateau at\n$z\\sim0.6$ that lasts $\\sim 2$ Gyr, and then starts growing again more rapidly.\nThe formation of fossil groups is defined at the very beginning of the groups\naccording to their galaxy luminosity sampling, which could be determined by\ntheir merging rate at early times.\n", "  We have derived new very accurate abundances of the Fe-group elements Sc\nthrough Zn (Z = 21-30) in the bright main-sequence turnoff star HD 84937, based\non high-resolution spectra covering the visible and ultraviolet spectral\nregions. New or recent laboratory transition data for 14 species of seven\nelements have been used. Abundances from more than 600 lines of non-Fe species\nhave been combined with about 550 Fe lines in HD 84937 to yield abundance\nratios of high precision. The abundances have been determined from both neutral\nand ionized transitions, which generally are in agreement with each other. We\nfind no substantial departures from standard LTE Saha ionization balance in\nthis [Fe/H] = -2.32 star. Noteworthy among the abundances are: [Co/Fe] = 0.14\nand [Cu/Fe] = -0.83, in agreement with past studies abundance trends in this\nand other low metallicity stars; and <[Sc,Ti,V/Fe]> = 0.31, which has not been\nnoted previously. A detailed examination of scandium, titanium, and vanadium\nabundances in large-sample spectroscopic surveys reveals that they are\npositively correlated in stars with [Fe/H] < -2; HD 84937 lies at the high end\nof this correlation. These trends constrain the synthesis mechanisms of\nFe-group elements. We also examine the GCE abundance trends of the Fe-group\nelements, including a new nucleosynthesis model with jet-like explosion\neffects.\n", "  We present a large class of new backgrounds that are solutions of type II\nsupergravity with a warped AdS${}_4$ factor, non-trivial axion-dilaton,\nB-field, and three- and five-form Ramond-Ramond fluxes. We obtain these\nsolutions by applying non-Abelian T-dualities with respect to SU(2) or\nSU(2)/U(1) isometries to reductions to 10d IIA of 11d sugra solutions of the\nform AdS${}_4 \\times Y^7$, with $Y^7 = S^7/\\mathbb{Z}_k, S^7, M^{1,1,1},\nQ^{1,1,1}$ and $N(1,1)$. The main class of reductions to IIA is along the Hopf\nfiber and leads to solutions of the form $AdS_4 \\times K_6$, where $K_6 $ is\nK\\\"ahler Einstein with $K_6=\\mathbb{CP}^3, S^2\\times \\mathbb{CP}^2, S^2\\times\nS^2 \\times S^2$; the first member of this class is dual to the ABJM field\ntheory in the 't Hooft limit. We also consider other less symmetric but susy\npreserving reductions along circles that are not the Hopf fiber. In the case of\n$N(1,1)$ we find an additional breaking of isometries in the NAT-dual\nbackground. To initiate the study of some properties of the field theory dual,\nwe explicitly compute the central charge holographically.\n", "  The kinetic power of radio jets is a quantity of fundamental importance to\nstudies of the AGN feedback process and radio galaxy physics. A widely used\nproxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical\nmethods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power\n(Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log(Q) = beta_L * log(L) + C. The\nregression slope has typically been found to be beta_L ~ 0.7 - 0.8. Here we\nshow that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by\nthe confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray\ncavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet\npower and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope beta_L ~ 0.3:\nsignificantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously\nused samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is\npresent when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we\nshow that beta_L is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio\ngalaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two\nclasses of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts beta_L\n(FRI) ~ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which beta_L(FRII) ~ 0.8.\nWe discuss the implications of our finding for studies of radio mode feedback,\nand radio galaxy physics.\n", "  We present and describe the astro-photometric catalog of more than 800,000\nsources found in the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP). HTTP is a Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) Treasury program designed to image the entire 30 Doradus\nregion down to the sub-solar (~0.5 solar masses) mass regime using the Wide\nField Camera 3 (WFC3) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). We observed 30\nDoradus in the near ultraviolet (F275W, F336W), optical (F555W, F658N, F775W),\nand near infrared (F110W, F160W) wavelengths. The stellar photometry was\nmeasured using point-spread function (PSF) fitting across all the bands\nsimultaneously. The relative astrometric accuracy of the catalog is 0.4 mas.\nThe astro-photometric catalog, results from artificial star experiments and the\nmosaics for all the filters are available for download. Color-magnitude\ndiagrams are presented showing the spatial distributions and ages of stars\nwithin 30 Dor as well as in the surrounding fields. HTTP provides the first\nrich and statistically significant sample of intermediate and low mass pre-main\nsequence candidates and allows us to trace how star formation has been\ndeveloping through the region. The depth and high spatial resolution of our\nanalysis highlight the dual role of stellar feedback in quenching and\ntriggering star formation on the giant HII region scale. Our results are\nconsistent with stellar sub-clustering in a partially filled gaseous nebula\nthat is offset towards our side of the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n", "  We performed extensive tests of the accuracy of atmospheric parameter\ndetermination for FGK stars based on the spectrum fitting procedure\nSpectroscopy Made Easy (SME). Our stellar sample consists of 13 objects,\nincluding the Sun, in the temperature range 5000--6600~K and metallicity range\n-1.4 -- +0.4. The analysed stars have the advantage of having parameters\nderived by interferometry. For each star we use spectra obtained with different\nspectrographs and different signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). For the fitting we\nadopted three different sets of constraints and test how the derived parameters\ndepend upon the spectral regions (masks) used in SME. We developed and\nimplemented in SME a new method for estimating uncertainties in the resulting\nparameters based on fitting residuals, partial derivatives, and data\nuncertainties. For stars in the 5700--6600 K range the best agreement with the\neffective temperatures derived by interferometry is achieved when spectrum\nfitting includes the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines, while for cooler stars the\nchoice of the mask does not affect the results. The derived atmospheric\nparameters do not strongly depend on spectral resolution and S/N of the\nobservations, while the uncertainties in temperature and surface gravity\nincrease with increasing effective temperature, with minima at 50~K in Teff and\n0.1~dex in log g, for spectra with S/N=150--200. A NLTE analysis of the\nTiI/TiII and FeI/FeII ionisation equilibria and abundances determined from the\natomic CI (NLTE) and molecular CH species supports the parameters we derived\nwith SME by fitting the observed spectra including the hydrogen lines.\n", "  Gamma-rays from hadronic collisions are expected from supernova remnants\n(SNRs) located near molecular clouds. The temperature on the shock interacting\nwith the dense environment quickly reaches $10^5$ K. The radiative losses of\nplasma become essential in the evolution of SNRs. They decrease the thermal\npressure and essentially increase the density behind the shock. The presence of\nambient magnetic field may considerably alter the behavior of the\npost-adiabatic SNRs comparing to hydrodynamic scenario. In the present paper,\nthe magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative shocks in magnetic field are\nperformed. High plasma compression due to the radiative losses results also in\nthe prominent increase of the strength of the tangential component of magnetic\nfield behind the shock and the decrease of the parallel one. If the strength of\nthe tangential field before the shock is higher than about $3\\mathrm{\\mu G}$ it\nprevents formation of the very dense thin shell. The higher the strength of the\ntangential magnetic field the larger the thickness and the lower the maximum\ndensity in the radiative shell. Parallel magnetic field does not affect the\ndistribution of the hydrodynamic parameters behind the shock. There are almost\nindependent channels of energy transformations: radiative losses are due to the\nthermal energy, the magnetic energy increases by reducing the kinetic energy.\nThe large density and high strength of the perpendicular magnetic field in the\nradiative shells of SNRs should result in considerable increase of the hadronic\ngamma-ray flux comparing to the leptonic one.\n", "  In this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early\nred-giant star KIC 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the\ndipole mixed modes obtained from {\\it Kepler} observations. In order to\novercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,\nwe present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to\nextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only\nthat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion\nresults generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we\nalso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with\na spatial resolution of $\\Delta r=0.001R$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharp\ndiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The\nresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of\nabout $\\langle\\Omega_c/2\\pi\\rangle=748\\pm18$~nHz and provide evidence for an\nangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of\nthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the\nrotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The\nangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning\nshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching\nan average value in the convective envelope of\n$\\langle\\Omega_s/2\\pi\\rangle=68\\pm22$~nHz. Hence, the core in KIC~4448777 is\nrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.\nWe conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient\nto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense\ncore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative\nregion and in the convective envelope.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) vary in their brightness across all wavelengths.\nMoreover, longer wavelength ultraviolet - optical continuum light curves appear\nto be delayed with respect to shorter wavelength light curves. A simple way to\nmodel these delays is by assuming thermal reprocessing of a variable point\nsource (a lamp post) by a blackbody accretion disc. We introduce a new method,\nCREAM (\\textbf{C}ontinuum \\textbf{RE}processed \\textbf{A}GN \\textbf{M}arkov\nChain Monte Carlo), that models continuum variations using this lamp post\nmodel. The disc light curves lag the lamp post emission with a time delay\ndistribution sensitive to the disc temperature-radius profile and inclination.\nWe test CREAM's ability to recover both inclination and product of black hole\nmass and accretion rate $\\mmdot$, and show that the code is also able to infer\nthe shape of the driving light curve. CREAM is applied to synthetic light\ncurves expected from 1000 second exposures of a 17th magnitude AGN with a 2m\ntelescope in Sloan g and i bands with signal to noise of 500 - 900 depending on\nthe filter and lunar phase. We also tests CREAM on poorer quality g and i light\ncurves with SNR = 100. We find in the high SNR case that CREAM can recover the\naccretion disc inclination to within an uncertainty of 5 degrees and an\n$\\mmdot$ to within 0.04 dex.\n", "  We used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the HerMES collaboration,\nperformed with the Herschel Observatory SPIRE multi-wavelength camera, to\nestimate the low-redshift, $0.02<z<0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions\n(LFs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\\,\\mu$m. SPIRE flux densities were also\ncombined with Spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to perform\na complete SED fitting analysis of SPIRE detected sources to calculate precise\nk-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\\,\\mu$m) luminosity\nfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statistical\nestimators. Integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the local\nluminosity density (LLD) and the comoving star formation rate density (SFRD)\nfor our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxy\nformation models. The luminosity functions show significant and rapid\nluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02<z<0.2$, with L$_{IR}^*\n\\propto (1+z)^{6.0\\pm0.4}$ and $\\Phi_{IR}^* \\propto (1+z)^{-2.1\\pm0.4}$,\nL$_{250}^* \\propto (1+z)^{5.3\\pm0.2}$ and $\\Phi_{250}^* \\propto\n(1+z)^{-0.6\\pm0.4}$ estimated using the IR bolometric and the 250$\\,\\mu$m LFs\nrespectively. Converting our IR LD estimate into an SFRD assuming a standard\nSalpeter IMF and including the unobscured contribution based on the UV\ndust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a SFRD scaling of\nSFRD$_0+0.08 z$, where SFRD$_0\\simeq (1.9\\pm 0.03)\\times 10^{-2}\n[\\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total SFRD estimate at\n$z\\sim0.02$.\n", "  We use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the Local Group to\nexplore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. We find that a number of simulated dwarfs form \"outside-in\", with an\nold, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentrated\nmetal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor or\nSextans. We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations\ndistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The\nspatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the\nold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population\nforms largely in situ. The older component results from a first episode of star\nformation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects of\nstellar feedback and reionization. The younger component forms when a late\naccretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. The effect of mergers is\nto disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasing\ntheir central density relative to the young population. We argue that\ndwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systems\nwith multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of age\nand metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.\n", "  To study the accretion phase for local massive galaxies, we search accreting\nsatellites around a massive compact galaxy (M_*~3.9x10^10Msun),\nspectroscopically confirmed (z_spec-1.9213) in the eXtreme Deep Field, which\nhas been originally reported in Szomoru et al. We detect 1369 satellite\ncandidates within the projected virial radius (rvir~300 kpc) of the compact\ngalaxy in the all-combined ACS image with 5sigma-limiting magnitude of\nmACS~30.6 ABmag, which corresponds to ~1.6x10^7M_sun at the redshift. The\nphotometric redshift measured with 12 multi-band images confirms 34 satellites\nout of the candidates. Most of the satellites are found to have the rest-frame\ncolors consistent with star forming galaxies. We investigate the relation\nbetween stellar mass and star formation rate (the star formation main\nsequence), and find the steeper slope at the low-mass end (<10^8M_sun), while\nmore massive satellites are consistently on the sequence reported in previous\nstudies. Within the uncertainties of star formation and photometric redshift,\nwe conjecture possible scenarios for the compact galaxy which evolves to a\nlocal massive galaxy by way of significant size and mass growth. While merging\nof the existing total stellar mass of the satellites is not enough to explain\nthe mass growth predicted by observations and simulations, the contribution by\nin-situ star formation in the satellites would compensate the deficit. Provided\nthat most satellites keep the observed in-situ star formation and then quench\nbefore they accrete by, e.g., environmental quenching, the compact galaxy would\nbecome a massive early-type galaxy consistent with the local size-mass\nrelation.\n", "  We confirm a 0.995 d periodic planetary transit-like signal, KOI 6705.01, in\nthe Kepler lightcurve of the star KIC 6423922. Optical and infrared spectra\nshow that this star is a mid M-type dwarf with an effective temperature $= 3327\n\\pm 60$K, metallicity [Fe/H] $= -0.08 \\pm 0.10$, radius $= 0.31 \\pm 0.03\nR_{\\odot}$, and mass $= 0.28 \\pm 0.05 M_{\\odot}$. The star is $\\approx 70$ pc\naway and its space motion, rotation period, and lack of H$\\alpha$ emission\nindicate it is an older member of the \"thin disk\" population. On the other\nhand, the star exhibits excess infrared emission suggesting a dust disk more\ntypical of a very young star. If the KOI 6705.01 signal is produced by a\nplanet, the transit depth of 60 ppm means its radius is only\n$0.26^{+0.034}_{-0.029} R_{\\oplus}$, or about the size of the Moon. However,\nthe duration ($\\gtrsim 3$~hr) and time variation of KOI 6705.01 are anomalous:\nthe signal was undetected in the first two years of the mission and increased\nthrough the latter two years. These characteristics require implausible orbits\nand material properties for any planet and rule out such an explanation,\nalthough a dust cloud is possible. We excluded several false positive scenarios\nincluding background stars, scattered light from stars that are nearby on the\nsky, and electronic cross-talk between detector readout channels. We find the\nmost likely explanation to be that KOI 6705.01 is a false positive created by\ncharge transfer inefficiency in a detector column on which KIC 6423922 and a\n1.99 d eclipsing binary both happened to fall.\n", "  We attempt to constrain the physical properties of the inner, gaseous disk of\nthe Herbig Be star BD+65 1637 using non-LTE, circumstellar disk codes and\nobserved spectra (3700 to 10,500 \\r{A}) from the ESPaDOnS instrument on CFHT.\nThe photoionizing radiation of the central star is assumed to be the sole\nsource of input energy for the disk. We model optical and near-infrared\nemission lines that are thought to form in this region using standard\ntechniques that have been successful in modeling the spectra of Classical Be\nstars. By comparing synthetic line profiles of hydrogen, helium, iron and\ncalcium with the observed line profiles, we try to constrain the geometry,\ndensity structure, and kinematics of the gaseous disk. Reasonable matches have\nbeen found for all line profiles individually; however, no disk density model\nbased on a single power-law for the equatorial density was able to\nsimultaneously fit all of the observed emission lines. Amongst the emission\nlines, the metal lines, especially the Ca II IR triplet, seem to require higher\ndisk densities than the other lines. Excluding the Ca II lines, a model in\nwhich the equatorial disk density falls as $10^{-10} (R_{*}/R)^3 g\\,cm^{-3}$\nseen at an inclination of 45{\\deg} for a $50\\,R_{*}$ disk provides reasonable\nmatches to the overall line shapes and strengths. The Ca II lines seem to\nrequire a shallower drop off as $10^{-10} (R_{*}/R)^2 g\\,cm^{-3}$ to match\ntheir strength. More complex disk density models are likely required to refine\nthe match to the BD+65 1637 spectrum.\n", "  From two observing runs during the 2014 summer at Calar Alto Observatory in\nAlmer\\'ia (Spain) and at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Granada (Spain), we were\nable to derive CCD photometry of the Trans-Neptunian Object 2008 OG$_{19}$. We\nanalyzed the time series and obtained a double-peaked light curve with a peak\nto valley amplitude of (0.437 $\\pm$ 0.011) mag and a rotational period of\n(8.727$\\pm$ 0.003) h. This implies that this object is very elongated, closely\nresembling Varuna's case. The photometry also allowed us to obtain an absolute\nmagnitude in R-band of (4.39 $\\pm$ 0.07) mag. From this result we estimated an\nequivalent diameter of 2008 OG$_{19}$ which is 619$^{+56}_{-113}$ km using an\naverage albedo for Scattered Disk Objects. Finally we interpreted the results\nunder the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and found a lower limit for the\ndensity of 544$^{+42}_{-4}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$. However, a more likely density is\n(609 $\\pm$ 4) kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$ using an aspect angle of 60$^\\circ$, which\ncorresponds to the most likely configuration for the spin axis with respect to\nthe observer assuming random orientations.\n", "  The Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP) is an experiment that harvests\nthe collective power of Europe's largest radio telescopes in order to increase\nthe sensitivity of high-precision pulsar timing. As part of the ongoing effort\nof the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), LEAP aims to go beyond the\nsensitivity threshold needed to deliver the first direct detection of\ngravitational waves. The five telescopes presently included in LEAP are: the\nEffelsberg telescope, the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, the Nan\\c cay radio\ntelescope, the Sardinia Radio Telescope and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope. Dual polarization, Nyquist-sampled time-series of the incoming radio\nwaves are recorded and processed offline to form the coherent sum, resulting in\na tied-array telescope with an effective aperture equivalent to a 195-m\ndiameter circular dish. All observations are performed using a bandwidth of 128\nMHz centered at a frequency of 1396 MHz. In this paper, we present the design\nof the LEAP experiment, the instrumentation, the storage and transfer of data,\nand the processing hardware and software. In particular, we present the\nsoftware pipeline that was designed to process the Nyquist-sampled time-series,\nmeasure the phase and time delays between each individual telescope and a\nreference telescope and apply these delays to form the tied-array coherent\naddition. The pipeline includes polarization calibration and interference\nmitigation. We also present the first results from LEAP and demonstrate the\nresulting increase in sensitivity, which leads to an improvement in the pulse\narrival times.\n", "  The mass discrepancy acceleration relation (MDAR) describes the coupling\nbetween baryons and dark matter (DM) in galaxies: the ratio of\ntotal-to-baryonic mass at a given radius anti-correlates with the acceleration\ndue to baryons. The MDAR has been seen as a challenge to the $\\Lambda$CDM\ngalaxy formation model, while it can be explained by Modified Newtonian\nDynamics. In this Letter we show that the MDAR arises in a $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology once observed galaxy scaling relations are taken into account. We\nbuild semi-empirical models based on $\\Lambda$CDM haloes, with and without the\ninclusion of baryonic effects, coupled to empirically motivated structural\nrelations. Our models can reproduce the MDAR: specifically, a mass-dependent\ndensity profile for DM haloes can fully account for the observed MDAR shape,\nwhile a universal profile shows a discrepancy with the MDAR of dwarf galaxies\nwith $\\rm M^{\\star}$$<$$\\rm10^{9.5}M_{\\odot}$, a further indication suggesting\nthe existence of DM cores. Additionally, we reproduce slope and normalization\nof the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) with 0.17 dex scatter. These\nresults imply that in $\\Lambda$CDM (i) the MDAR is driven by structural scaling\nrelations of galaxies and DM density profile shapes, and (ii) the baryonic\nfractions determined by the BTFR are consistent with those inferred from\nabundance-matching studies.\n", "  In this analysis we illustrate how the relatively new emission mechanism\nknown as spinning dust can be used to characterize dust grains in the\ninterstellar medium. We demonstrate this by using spinning dust emission\nobservations to constrain the abundance of very small dust grains (a $\\lesssim$\n10nm) in a sample of Galactic cold cores. Using the physical properties of the\ncores in our sample as inputs to a spinning dust model, we predict the expected\nlevel of emission at a wavelength of 1cm for four different very small dust\ngrain abundances, which we constrain by comparing to 1cm CARMA observations.\nFor all of our cores we find a depletion of very small grains, which we suggest\nis due to the process of grain growth. This work represents the first time that\nspinning dust emission has been used to constrain the physical properties of\ninterstellar dust grains.\n", "  We study a system of two quantum dots, each with several discrete levels,\nwhich are coherently coupled to a microwave oscillator. They are attached to\nelectronic leads and coupled to a phonon bath, both leading to inelastic\nprocesses. For a simpler system with a single level in each dot it has been\nshown that a population inversion can be created by electron tunneling, which\nin a resonance situation leads to lasing-type properties of the oscillator. In\nthe multi-level system several resonance situations may arise, some of them\nrelying on a sequence of tunneling processes which also involve non-resonant,\ninelastic transitions. The resulting photon number in the oscillator and the\ncurrent-voltage characteristic are highly sensitive to these properties and\naccordingly can serve as a probe for microscopic details.\n", "  The discovery of colour-kinematics duality has allowed great progress in our\nunderstanding of the UV structure of gravity. However, it has proven difficult\nto find numerators which satisfy colour-kinematics duality in certain cases. We\ndiscuss obstacles to building a set of such numerators in the context of the\nfive-gluon amplitude with all helicities positive at two loops. We are able to\novercome the obstacles by adding more loop momentum to our numerator to\naccommodate tension between the values of certain cuts and the symmetries of\ncertain diagrams. At the same time, we maintain control over the size of our\nansatz by identifying a highly constraining but desirable symmetry property of\nour master numerator. The resulting numerators have twelve powers of loop\nmomenta rather than the seven one would expect from the Feynman rules.\n", "  We predict cosmological constraints for forthcoming surveys using\nSuperluminous Supernovae (SLSNe) as standardisable candles. Due to their high\npeak luminosity, these events can be observed to high redshift (z~3), opening\nup new possibilities to probe the Universe in the deceleration epoch. We\ndescribe our methodology for creating mock Hubble diagrams for the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES), the \"Search Using DECam for Superluminous Supernovae\" (SUDSS) and\na sample of SLSNe possible from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),\nexploring a range of standardisation values for SLSNe. We include uncertainties\ndue to gravitational lensing and marginalise over possible uncertainties in the\nmagnitude scale of the observations (e.g. uncertain absolute peak magnitude,\ncalibration errors). We find that the addition of only ~100 SLSNe from SUDSS to\n3800 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from DES can improve the constraints on w and\nOmega_m by at least 20% (assuming a flat wCDM universe). Moreover, the\ncombination of DES SNe Ia and 10,000 LSST-like SLSNe can measure Omega_m and w\nto 2% and 4% respectively. The real power of SLSNe becomes evident when we\nconsider possible temporal variations in w(a), giving possible uncertainties of\nonly 2%, 5% and 14% on Omega_m, w_0 and w_a respectively, from the combination\nof DES SNe Ia, LSST-like SLSNe and Planck. These errors are competitive with\npredicted Euclid constraints, indicating a future role for SLSNe for probing\nthe high redshift Universe.\n", "  How a galaxy regulates its SNe energy into different\ninterstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxy\nevolution. Based on the JVLA D-configuration C- (6 GHz) and L-band (1.6 GHz)\ncontinuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparing\nmulti-wavelength properties of the CHANG-ES galaxies. The high-quality JVLA\ndata and edge-on orientation enable us for the first time to include the halo\ninto the energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. We find tight\ncorrelations of $L_{\\rm radio}$ with the mid-IR-based SFR. The normalization of\nour $I_{\\rm 1.6GHz}/{\\rm W~Hz^{-1}}-{\\rm SFR}$ relation is $\\sim$2-3 times of\nthose obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced IR\nextinction at high inclination. We also find tight correlations between $L_{\\rm\nradio}$ and the SNe energy injection rate $\\dot{E}_{\\rm SN(Ia+CC)}$, indicating\nthe energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for $\\sim0.1\\%$ of\n$\\dot{E}_{\\rm SN}$, comparable to the energy contained in CR electrons. The\nintegrated C-to-L-band spectral index is $\\alpha\\sim0.5-1.1$ for non-AGN\ngalaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. The\nlow-scatter $L_{\\rm radio}-{\\rm SFR}$/$L_{\\rm radio}-\\dot{E}_{\\rm SN (Ia+CC)}$\nrelationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at $\\sim2~\\sigma$ in L-band\n($1.132\\pm0.067$/$1.175\\pm0.102$) while consistent with linear in C-band\n($1.057\\pm0.075$/$1.100\\pm0.123$). The super-linearity could be naturally\nreproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. Using Chandra halo\nX-ray measurements, we find sub-linear $L_{\\rm X}-L_{\\rm radio}$ relations.\nThese results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst galaxy is\nclose to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher SFR tends to distribute\nan increased fraction of SNe energy into radio emission (than X-ray).\n", "  In the earliest phases of star-forming clouds, stable molecular species, such\nas CO, are important coolants in the gas phase. Depletion of these molecules on\ndust surfaces affects the thermal balance of molecular clouds and with that\ntheir whole evolution. For the first time, we study the effect of grain surface\nchemistry (GSC) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function\n(IMF). We follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat the\ngas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. We\nperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a pure\ngas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. The models\ndisplay different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. The equation of\nstate (EOS) of the gas becomes softer with CO freeze-out and the results show\nthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution history\nsuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.\nWhile the stellar mass distribution results in a different IMF when we consider\npure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the GSC, the divergence from a\npure gas-phase model is minimal. We find that the impact of freeze-out is\nbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. We also\nfind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate that\nthis may be a result from the changes in the EOS caused by the gas-dust thermal\ncoupling. We conclude that GSC plays a big role in the chemical composition of\nmolecular clouds and that surface processes are needed to accurately interpret\nobservations, however, that GSC does not have a significant impact as far as\nstar formation and the IMF is concerned.\n", "  We present a new method to identify luminous off-nuclear X-ray sources in the\noutskirts of galaxies from large public redshift surveys, distinguishing them\nfrom foreground and background interlopers. Using the 3XMM-DR5 catalog of X-ray\nsources and the SDSS DR12 spectroscopic sample of galaxies, with the help of\nthis off-nuclear cross-matching technique, we selected 98 sources with inferred\nX-ray luminosities in the range $10^{41} < L_{\\rm X} < 10^{44}\\,{\\rm\nerg\\,s}^{-1}$, compatible with hyperluminous X-ray objects (HLX). To validate\nthe method, we verify that it allowed us to recover known HLX candidates such\nas ESO 243$-$49 HLX$-$1 and M82 X$-$1. From a statistical study, we\nconservatively estimate that up to $71 \\pm 11$ of these sources may be fore- or\nbackground sources, statistically leaving at least 16 that are likely to be\nHLXs, thus providing support for the existence of the HLX population. We\nidentify two good HLX candidates and using other publicly available datasets,\nin particular the VLA FIRST in radio, UKIDSS in the near-infrared, GALEX in the\nultra-violet and CFHT Megacam archive in the optical, we present evidence that\nthese objects are unlikely to be foreground or background X-ray objects of\nconventional types, e.g. active galactic nuclei, BL Lac objects, Galactic X-ray\nbinaries or nearby stars. However, additional dedicated X-ray and optical\nobservations are needed to confirm their association with the assumed host\ngalaxies and thus secure their HLX classification.\n", "  W projection is a commonly-used approach to allow interferometric imaging to\nbe accelerated by Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), but it can require a huge\namount of storage for convolution kernels. The kernels are not separable, but\nwe show that they can be closely approximated by separable kernels. The error\nscales with the fourth power of the field of view, and so is small enough to be\nignored at mid to high frequencies. We also show that hybrid imaging algorithms\ncombining W projection with either faceting, snapshotting, or W stacking allow\nthe error to be made arbitrarily small, making the approximation suitable even\nfor high-resolution wide-field instruments.\n", "  We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 985 on multiple occasions to search for\nvariability in its UV and X-ray absorption features in order to establish their\nlocation and physical properties. We use XMM-Newton to obtain X-ray spectra\nusing the EPIC-pn camera, and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain UV spectra. Our observations are\nsimultaneous and span timescales of days to years. We find that the soft X-ray\nobscuration that absorbed the low energy continuum of NGC 985 in August 2013\ndiminished greatly by January 2015. The total X-ray column density decreased\nfrom 2.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 to ~6 x 10^21 cm^-2. We also detect broad, fast UV\nabsorption lines in COS spectra obtained during the 2013 obscuration event.\nLines of C III*, Ly alpha, Si IV and C IV with outflow velocities of -5970 km/s\nand a full-width at half-maximum of 1420 km/s are prominent in the 2013\nspectrum, but have disappeared in all but Ly alpha in the 2015 spectra. The\nionization state and the column density of the UV absorbing gas is compatible\nwith arising in the same gas as that causing the X-ray obscuration. The high\nvelocity of the UV-absorbing gas suggests that the X-ray obscurer and the\nassociated UV outflow are manifestations of an accretion disk wind.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical stability of the holographic system with two\norder parameters, which exhibits competition and coexistence of condensations.\nIn the linear regime, we have developed the gauge dependent formalism to\ncalculate the quasi-normal modes by gauge fixing, which turns out be\nconsiderably convenient. Furthermore, by giving different Gaussian wave packets\nas perturbations at the initial time, we numerically evolve the full nonlinear\nsystem until it arrives at the final equilibrium state. Our results show that\nthe dynamical stability is consistent with the thermodynamical stability.\nInterestingly, the dynamical evolution, as well as the quasi-normal modes,\nshows that the relaxation time of this model is generically much longer than\nthe simplest holographic system. We also find that the late time behavior can\nbe well captured by the lowest lying quasi-normal modes except for the\nnon-vanishing order towards the single ordered phase. To our knowledge, this\nexception is the first counter example to the general belief that the late time\nbehavior towards a final stable state can be captured by the lowest lying\nquasi-normal modes. In particular, a double relation is found for this\nexception in certain cases.\n", "  Emission-line stars are typically surrounded by dense circumstellar material,\noften in form of rings or disc-like structures. Line emission from forbidden\ntransitions trace a diversity of density and temperature regimes. Of particular\ninterest are the forbidden lines of [O I] {\\lambda}{\\lambda}6300, 6364 and [Ca\nII] {\\lambda}{\\lambda}7291, 7324. They arise in complementary, high-density\nenvironments, such as the inner-disc regions around B[e] supergiants. To study\nphysical conditions traced by these lines and to investigate how common they\nare, we initiated a survey of emission-line stars. Here, we focus on a sample\nof nine B[e] stars in different evolutionary phases. Emission of the [O I]\nlines is one of the characteristics of B[e] stars. We find that four of the\nobjects display [Ca II] line emission: for the B[e] supergiants V1478 Cyg and 3\nPup the kinematics obtained from the [O I] and [Ca II] line profiles agrees\nwith a Keplerian rotating disc scenario; the forbidden lines of the compact\nplanetary nebula OY Gem display no kinematical broadening beyond spectral\nresolution; the LBV candidate V1429 Aql shows no [O I] lines, but the profile\nof its [Ca II] lines suggests that the emission originates in its hot, ionized\ncircumbinary disc. As none of the B[e] stars of lower mass displays [Ca II]\nline emission, we conclude that these lines are more likely observable in\nmassive stars with dense discs, supporting and strengthening the suggestion\nthat their appearance requires high-density environments.\n", "  The proposed coordinate/field duality [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 163] is\napplied to the gauge and matter sectors of gauge theories. In the non-Abelian\ncase, due to indices originated from the internal space, the dual coordinates\nappear to be matrices. The dimensions and the transformations of the matrix\ncoordinates of gauge and matter sectors are different and are consistent to\nexpectations from lattice gauge theory and the theory of open strings equipped\nwith the Chan-Paton factors. It is argued that in the unbroken symmetry phase,\nwhere only proper collections of field components as colorless states are\ndetected, it is logical to assume that the same happens for the dual\ncoordinates, making matrix coordinates the natural candidates to capture the\ninternal dynamics of baryonic confined states. The proposed matrix coordinates\nhappen to be the same appearing in the bound-state of D0-branes of string\ntheory.\n", "  Optically bright, wide separation double (gravitationally lensed) quasars can\nbe easily monitored, leading to light curves of great importance in determining\nthe Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters, as well as the structure\nof active nuclei and halos of galaxies. Searching for new double quasars in the\nSDSS-III database, we discovered SDSS J1442+4055. This consists of two bright\nimages (18-19 magnitudes in the r band) of the same distant quasar at redshift\nz = 2.575. The two quasar images are separated by about 2.1 arcsec, show\nsignificant parallel flux variations and can be monitored from late 2015. We\nalso found other two double quasar candidates, SDSS J1617+3827 (z = 2.079) and\nSDSS J1642+3200 (z = 2.264), displaying evidence for the presence of a lensing\nobject and parallel flux variations, but requiring further spectroscopic\nobservations to be confirmed as lensed quasars.\n", "  We use the exact solutions for magnetoacoustic waves in a two dimensional\nisothermal atmosphere with uniform inclined magnetic field to calculate the\nwave reflection, transmission, and conversion of slow and fast waves incident\nfrom above ($z=\\infty$). This is relevant to the question of whether waves\nexcited by flares in the solar atmosphere can penetrate the Alfv\\'en/acoustic\nequipartition layer (which we identify as the canopy) to reach the photosphere\nwith sufficient energy to create sunquakes. It is found that slow waves above\nthe acoustic cutoff frequency efficiently penetrate (transmit) as acoustic\n(fast) waves if directed at a small attack angle to the magnetic field, with\nthe rest converting to magnetic (slow) waves, in accord with Generalized Ray\nTheory. This may help explain the compact nature of seismic sources of\nsunquakes identified using seismic holography. The incident slow waves can also\nefficiently transmit at low frequency in inclined field due to the reduction in\nacoustic cutoff frequency (ramp effect). Incident fast (magnetic) \"waves\" from\ninfinity with specified nonzero horizontal wavenumber are necessarily\nevanescent, but can carry energy to the equipartition level by tunnelling. It\nis found that this can then efficiently convert to acoustic (fast) energy that\ncan again reach the photosphere as a travelling wave. Overall, there appear to\nbe ample avenues for substantial compressive wave energy to penetrate the\ncanopy and impact the photosphere.\n", "  It has been suggested that the prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts consists\nof several components giving rise to the observed spectral shape. Here we\nexamine a sample of the 8 brightest, single pulsed {\\it Fermi} bursts whose\nspectra are modelled by using synchrotron emission as one of the components.\nFive of these bursts require an additional photospheric component (blackbody).\nIn particular, we investigate the inferred properties of the jet and the\nphysical requirements set by the observed components for these five bursts, in\nthe context of a baryonic dominated outflow, motivated by the strong\nphotospheric component. We find similar jet properties for all five bursts: the\nbulk Lorentz factor decreases monotonously over the pulses and lies between\n1000 and 100. This evolution is robust and can neither be explained by a\nvarying radiative efficiency nor a varying magnetisation of the jet assuming\nthe photosphere radius is above the coasting radius. Such a behaviour\nchallenges several dissipation mechanisms, e.g., the internal shocks.\nFurthermore, in all 8 cases the data clearly reject a fast-cooled synchrotron\nspectrum (in which a significant fraction of the emitting electrons have cooled\nto energies below the minimum injection energy), inferring a typical electron\nLorentz factor of $10^4 - 10^7$. Such values are much higher than what is\ntypically expected in internal shocks. Therefore, while the synchrotron\nscenario is not rejected by the data, the interpretation does present several\nlimitations that need to be addressed. Finally, we point out and discuss\nalternative interpretations.\n", "  In our first paper, we performed a detailed (i.e. bulge, disks, bars, spiral\narms, rings, halo, nucleus, etc.) decomposition of 66 galaxies, with directly\nmeasured black hole masses, $M_{BH}$, that had been imaged at $3.6~\\mu m$ with\nSpitzer. Our sample is the largest to date and, for the first time, the\ndecompositions were checked for consistency with the galaxy kinematics. We\npresent correlations between $M_{ BH}$ and the host spheroid (and galaxy)\nluminosity, $L_{sph}$ (and $L_{gal}$), and also stellar mass, $M_{*,sph}$.\nWhile most previous studies have used galaxy samples that were overwhelmingly\ndominated by high-mass, early-type galaxies, our sample includes 17 spiral\ngalaxies, half of which have $M_{BH} < 10^7~M_\\odot$, and allows us to better\ninvestigate the poorly studied low-mass end of the $M_{BH} - M_{*,sph}$\ncorrelation. The bulges of early-type galaxies follow $M_{BH} \\propto\nM_{*,sph}^{1.04 \\pm 0.10}$ and define a tight red sequence with intrinsic\nscatter $\\epsilon = 0.43 \\pm 0.06~dex$ and a median $M_{BH}/M_{*,sph}$ ratio of\n$0.68 \\pm 0.04\\%$, i.e.~a $\\pm 2\\sigma$ range of 0.1-5%. At the low-mass end,\nthe bulges of late-type galaxies define a much steeper blue sequence, with\n$M_{BH} \\propto M_{*,sph}^{2-3}$, indicating that gas-rich processes feed the\nblack hole more efficiently than the host bulge as they coevolve. We\nadditionally report that: i) our Sersic galaxy sample follows a less steep\nsequence than previously reported; ii) bulges with Sersic index $n<2$, argued\nby some to be pseudo-bulges, are not offset to lower $M_{BH}$ from the\ncorrelation defined by the current bulge sample with $n>2$; and iii) $L_{sph}$\nand $L_{gal}$ correlate equally well with $M_{BH}$, in terms of intrinsic\nscatter, only for early-type galaxies - once reasonable numbers of spiral\ngalaxies are included, the correlation with $L_{ sph}$ is better than that with\n$L_{gal}$.\n", "  We combine Spitzer and Herschel data of the star-forming region N11 in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud to produce detailed maps of the dust properties in the\ncomplex and study their variations with the ISM conditions. We also compare\nAPEX/LABOCA 870um observations with our model predictions in order to decompose\nthe 870um emission into dust and non-dust (free-free emission and CO(3-2) line)\ncontributions. We find that in N11, the 870um can be fully accounted for by\nthese 3 components. The dust surface density map of N11 is combined with HI and\nCO observations to study local variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratios. Our\nanalysis leads to values lower than those expected from the LMC low-metallicity\nas well as to a decrease of the gas-to-dust mass ratio with the dust surface\ndensity. We explore potential hypotheses that could explain the low observed\ngas-to-dust mass ratios (variations in the XCO factor, presence of CO-dark gas\nor of optically thick HI or variations in the dust abundance in the dense\nregions). We finally decompose the local SEDs using a Principal Component\nAnalysis (i.e. with no a priori assumption on the dust composition in the\ncomplex). Our results lead to a promising decomposition of the local SEDs in\nvarious dust components (hot, warm, cold) coherent with that expected for the\nregion. Further analysis on a larger sample of galaxies will follow in order to\nunderstand how unique this decomposition is or how it evolves from one\nenvironment to another.\n", "  We report on observations of the polarization of optical and {\\gamma}-ray\nphotons from the Crab nebula and pulsar system using the Galway Astronomical\nStokes Polarimeter (GASP), the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for\nSurveys (HST/ACS) and the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\nsatellite (Integral). These, when combined with other optical polarization\nobservations, suggest that the polarized optical emission and {\\gamma}-ray\npolarization changes in a similar manner. A change in the optical polarization\nangle has been observed by this work, from 109.5 \\pm 0.7\\deg in 2005 to 85.3\n\\pm 1.4 \\deg in 2012. On the other hand, the {\\gamma}-ray polarization angle\nchanged from 115 \\pm 11 \\deg in 2003-2007 to 80 \\pm 12 \\deg in 2012-2014.\nStrong flaring activities have been detected in the Crab nebula over the past\nfew years by the high energy {\\gamma}-ray missions Agile and Fermi, and\nmagnetic reconnection processes have been suggested to explain these\nobservations. The change in the polarized optical and {\\gamma}-ray emission of\nthe Crab nebula/pulsar as observed, for the first time, by GASP and Integral\nmay indicate that reconnection is possibly at work in the Crab nebula. We also\nreport, for the first time, a non-zero measure of the optical circular\npolarization from the Crab pulsar+knot system.\n", "  The theoretical and observed populations of pre-cataclysmic variables\n(pre-CVs) are dominated by systems with low-mass white dwarfs (WDs), while the\nWD masses in CVs are typically high. In addition, the space density of CVs is\nfound to be significantly lower than theoretical models. We investigate the\ninfluence of nova outbursts on the formation and (initial) evolution of CVs. In\nparticular, we calculate the stability of the mass transfer in case all the\nmaterial accreted on the WD is lost in classical novae, and part of the energy\nto eject the material comes from a common-envelope like interaction with the\ncompanion. In addition, we study the effect of an asymmetry in the mass\nejection, that may lead to small eccentricities in the orbit. We find that a\ncommon-envelope like ejection significantly decreases the stability of the mass\ntransfer, in particular for low-mass WD. Similarly, the influence of asymmetric\nmass loss can be important for short-period systems and even more so for\nlow-mass WD, but likely disappears long before the next nova outburst due to\norbital circularization. In both cases the mass-transfer rates increase, which\nmay lead to observable (and perhaps already observed) consequences for systems\nthat do survive to become CVs. However, a more detailed investigation of the\ninteraction between nova ejecta and the companion and the evolution of slightly\neccentric CVs is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.\n", "  We present a freely downloadable software package for modelling the dynamics\nof galaxies, which we call the Torus Mapper (TM). The package is based around\n`torus mapping', which is a non-perturbative technique for creating orbital\ntori for specified values of the action integrals. Given an orbital torus and a\nstar's position at a reference time, one can compute its position at any other\ntime, no matter how remote. One can also compute the velocities with which the\nstar will pass through any given point and the contribution it will make to the\ntime-averaged density there. A system of angle-action coordinates for the given\npotential can be created by foliating phase space with orbital tori. Such a\nfoliation is facilitated by the ability of TM to create tori by interpolating\non a grid of tori.\n  We summarise the advantages of using TM rather than a standard time-stepper\nto create orbits, and give segments of code that illustrate applications of TM\nin several contexts, including setting up initial conditions for an N-body\nsimulation. We examine the precision of the orbital tori created by TM and the\nbehaviour of the code when orbits become trapped by a resonance.\n", "  The journey from dust particle to planetesimal involves physical processes\nacting on scales ranging from micrometers (the sticking and restructuring of\naggregates) to hundreds of astronomical units (the size of the turbulent\nprotoplanetary nebula). Considering these processes simultaneously is essential\nwhen studying planetesimal formation. We develop a novel, global,\nsemi-analytical model for the evolution of the mass-dominating dust particles\nin a turbulent protoplanetary disk that takes into account the evolution of the\ndust surface density while preserving the essential characteristics of the\nporous coagulation process. This panoptic model is used to study the growth\nfrom submicron to planetesimal sizes in disks around Sun-like stars. For highly\nporous ices, unaffected by collisional fragmentation and erosion, rapid growth\nto planetesimal sizes is possible in a zone stretching out to\n${\\sim}10\\mathrm{~AU}$ for massive disks. When porous coagulation is limited by\nerosive collisions, the formation of planetesimals through direct coagulation\nis not possible, but the creation of a large population of aggregates with\nStokes numbers close to unity might trigger the streaming instability (SI).\nHowever, we find that reaching conditions necessary for SI is difficult and\nlimited to dust-rich disks, (very) cold disks, or disks with weak turbulence.\nBehind the snow-line, porosity-driven aggregation of icy grains results in\nrapid (${\\sim}10^{4}\\mathrm{~yr}$) formation of planetesimals. If erosive\ncollisions prevent this, SI might be triggered for specific disk conditions.\nThe numerical approach introduced in this work is ideally suited for studying\nplanetesimal formation and pebble delivery simultaneously and will help build a\ncoherent picture of the start of the planet formation process.\n", "  A fraction of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) shows bright emission in the\nUV and the blue part of the optical spectrum, which has been interpreted as\nevidence of recent star formation. Most of these results are based on the\nanalysis of broadband photometric data. Here, we study the optical spectra of a\nsample of 19 BCGs hosted by X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at 0.15 < z < 0.3, a\nsubset from the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project (CCCP) sample. We identify\nplausible star formation histories of the galaxies by fitting Simple Stellar\nPopulations (SSPs) as well as composite populations, consisting of a young\nstellar component superimposed on an intermediate/old stellar component, to\naccurately constrain their star formation histories. We detect prominent young\n(~200 Myr) stellar populations in 4 of the 19 galaxies. Of the four, the BCG in\nAbell 1835 shows remarkable A-type stellar features indicating a relatively\nlarge population of young stars, which is extremely unusual even amongst star\nforming BCGs. We constrain the mass contribution of these young components to\nthe total stellar mass to be typically between 1% to 3%, but rising to 7% in\nAbell 1835. We find that the four of the BCGs with strong evidence for recent\nstar formation (and only these four galaxies) are found within a projected\ndistance of 5 kpc of their host cluster's X-ray peak, and the diffuse, X-ray\ngas surrounding the BCGs exhibit a ratio of the radiative cooling-to-free-fall\ntime ($t_{c}/t_{ff}$) of < 10. These are also some of the clusters with the\nlowest central entropy. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the\nprecipitation-driven star formation and AGN feedback model, in which the\nradiatively cooling diffuse gas is subject to local thermal instabilities once\nthe instability parameter $t_{c}/t_{ff}$ falls below ~10, leading to the\ncondensation and precipitation of cold gas. [Abridged]\n", "  Penumbral microjets (PJs) are transient narrow bright features in the\nchromosphere of sunspot penumbrae, first characterized by Katsukawa et al\n(2007) using the \\CaII\\ H-line filter on {\\it Hinode}'s Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT). It was proposed that the PJs form as a result of reconnection between\ntwo magnetic components of penumbra (spines and interspines), and that they\ncould contribute to the transition region (TR) and coronal heating above\nsunspot penumbrae. We propose a modified picture of formation of PJs based on\nrecent results on internal structure of sunspot penumbral filaments. Using data\nof a sunspot from {\\it Hinode}/SOT, High Resolution Coronal Imager, and\ndifferent passbands of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the {\\it\nSolar Dynamics Observatory}, we examine whether PJs have signatures in the TR\nand corona. We find hardly any discernible signature of normal PJs in any AIA\npassbands, except a few of them showing up in the 1600 \\AA\\ images. However, we\ndiscovered exceptionally stronger jets with similar lifetimes but bigger sizes\n(up to 600 km wide) occurring repeatedly in a few locations in the penumbra,\nwhere evidence of patches of opposite polarity fields at the tails of some\npenumbral filaments is seen in Stokes-V images. These large tail PJs do display\nsignatures in the TR. Whether they have any coronal-temperature plasma is\nambiguous. We infer that none of the PJs, including the large tail PJs,\ndirectly heat the corona in ARs significantly, but any penumbral jet might\ndrive some coronal heating indirectly via generation of Alfv\\'en waves and/or\nbraiding of the coronal field.\n", "  We reinvestigate the structure of a steady axisymmetic force-free\nmagnetosphere around a Kerr black hole (BH). The BH magnetosphere structure is\ngoverned by a second-order differential equation of $A_\\phi$ depending on two\n`free' functions $\\Omega$ and $I$, where $A_\\phi$ is the $\\phi$ component of\nthe vector potential of the electromagnetic field, $\\Omega$ is the angular\nvelocity of the magnetic field lines and $I$ is the poloidal electric current.\nWhile the two functions $\\Omega$ and $I$ are not arbitrarily given, which need\nto be self-consistently determined along with the differential equation. Based\non the perturbation approach we proposed in paper I \\citep{Pan2015a}, in this\npaper, we self-consistently sort out two boundary conditions governing $\\Omega$\nand $I$, and interpret these conditions mathematically and physically. Making\nuse of the boundary conditions, we prove that all magnetic field lines crossing\nthe infinite-redshift surface also penetrate the event horizon. Furthermore, we\nargue that the BH Meissner effect does not work in force-free magnetosphere due\nto the perfect conductivity.\n", "  We study the horseshoe dynamics of a low-mass planet in a three-dimensional,\nglobally isothermal, inviscid disk. We find, as reported in previous work, that\nthe boundaries of the horseshoe region (separatrix sheets) have cylindrical\nsymmetry about the disk's rotation axis. We interpret this feature as arising\nfrom the fact that the whole separatrix sheets have a unique value of\nBernoulli's constant, and that this constant does not depend on altitude, but\nonly on the cylindrical radius, in barotropic disks. We next derive an\nexpression for the torque exerted by the horseshoe region onto the planet, or\nhorseshoe drag. Potential vorticity is not materially conserved as in\ntwo-dimensional flows, but it obeys a slightly more general conservation law\n(Ertel's theorem) which allows to obtain an expression for the horseshoe drag\nidentical to the expression in a two-dimensional disk. Our results are\nillustrated and validated by three-dimensional numerical simulations. The\nhorseshoe region is found to be slightly more narrow than previously\nextrapolated from two-dimensional analyses with a suitable softening length of\nthe potential. We discuss the implications of our results for the saturation of\nthe corotation torque, and the possible connection to the flow at the Bondi\nscale, which the present analysis does not resolve.\n", "  Context: Independent distance estimates are particularly useful to check the\nprecision of other distance indicators, while accurate and precise masses are\nnecessary to constrain evolution models. Aim: The goal is to measure the masses\nand distance of the detached eclipsing-binary TZ~For with a precision level\nlower than 1\\,\\% using a fully geometrical and empirical method. Method: We\nobtained the first interferometric observations of TZ~For with the VLTI/PIONIER\ncombiner, which we combined with new and precise radial velocity measurements\nto derive its three-dimensional orbit, masses, and distance. Results: The\nsystem is well resolved by PIONIER at each observing epoch, which allowed a\ncombined fit with eleven astrometric positions. Our derived values are in a\ngood agreement with previous work, but with an improved precision. We measured\nthe mass of both components to be $M_1 = 2.057 \\pm 0.001\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_2 =\n1.958 \\pm 0.001\\,M_\\odot$. The comparison with stellar evolution models gives\nan age of the system of $1.20 \\pm 0.10$\\,Gyr. We also derived the distance to\nthe system with a precision level of 1.1\\,\\%: $d = 185.9 \\pm 1.9$\\,pc. Such\nprecise and accurate geometrical distances to eclipsing binaries provide a\nunique opportunity to test the absolute calibration of the surface\nbrightness-colour relation for late-type stars, and will also provide the best\nopportunity to check on the future Gaia measurements for possible systematic\nerrors.\n", "  We combine Herschel/SPIRE sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existing\nmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,\noptically red galaxies detected in submm bands. We select a sample of galaxies\nin the redshift range 0.01$\\leq$z$\\leq$0.2, having >5$\\sigma$ detections in the\nSPIRE 250 micron submm waveband. Sources are then divided into two sub-samples\nof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their UV-optical colours. Galaxies in\nthe $red$ sample account for $\\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number of\nsources with stellar masses M$_{*}\\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ Solar-mass. Following\nvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\\gtrsim$30 per cent\nof them are early-type galaxies and $\\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. The\ncolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highly\ninclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellar\npopulation.\n  It is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$\nsources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the\n$\\Sigma_5$ parameter). From the analysis of the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of galaxies in our samples based on MAGPHYS, we find that galaxies in\nthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to those\nin the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). However, in\ncomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,\n$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. Besides galaxies\nin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower mean\nstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterparts\nin the $blue$ sample. Our results support a scenario where dust in early-type\nsystems is likely to be of an external origin.\n", "  Dynamical estimates of the mass surface density at the solar radius can be\nmade up to a height of 4 kpc using thick disk stars as tracers of the\npotential. We investigate why different Jeans estimators of the local surface\ndensity lead to puzzling and conflicting results. Using the Jeans equations, we\ncompute the vertical (F_z) and radial (F_R) components of the gravitational\nforce, as well as Gamma(z), defined as the radial derivative of V_c^2, with\nV_c^{2}= -RF_R. If we assume that the thick disk does not flare and that all\nthe components of the velocity dispersion tensor of the thick disk have a\nuniform radial scalelength of 3.5 kpc, Gamma takes implausibly large negative\nvalues, when using the currently available kinematical data of the thick disk.\nThis implies that the input parameters or the model assumptions must be\nrevised. We have explored, using a simulated thick disk, the impact of the\nassumption that the scale lengths of the density and velocity dispersions do\nnot depend on the vertical height z above the midplane. In the lack of any\ninformation about how these scale radii depend on z, we define a different\nstrategy. By using a parameterized Galactic potential, we find that acceptable\nfits to F_z, F_R and Gamma are obtained for a flaring thick disk and a\nspherical dark matter halo with a local density larger than 0.0064 M_sun\npc^{-3}. Disk-like dark matter distributions might be also compatible with the\ncurrent data of the thick disk. A precise measurement of Gamma at the midplane\ncould be very useful to discriminate between models.\n", "  We study oxygen abundance profiles of the gaseous disc components in\nsimulated galaxies in a hierarchical universe. We analyse the disc metallicity\ngradients in relation to the stellar masses and star formation rates of the\nsimulated galaxies. We find a trend for galaxies with low stellar masses to\nhave steeper metallicity gradients than galaxies with high stellar masses at z\n~0. We also detect that the gas-phase metallicity slopes and the specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) of our simulated disc galaxies are consistent with\nrecently reported observations at z ~0. Simulated galaxies with high stellar\nmasses reproduce the observed relationship at all analysed redshifts and have\nan increasing contribution of discs with positive metallicity slopes with\nincreasing redshift. Simulated galaxies with low stellar masses a have larger\nfraction of negative metallicity gradients with increasing redshift. Simulated\ngalaxies with positive or very negative metallicity slopes exhibit disturbed\nmorphologies and/or have a close neighbour. We analyse the evolution of the\nslope of the oxygen profile and sSFR for a gas-rich galaxy-galaxy encounter,\nfinding that this kind of events could generate either positive and negative\ngas-phase oxygen profiles depending on their state of evolution. Our results\nsupport claims that the determination of reliable metallicity gradients as a\nfunction of redshift is a key piece of information to understand galaxy\nformation and set constrains on the subgrid physics.\n", "  We explore the evolution of the Stellar Mass-Star Formation Rate-Metallicity\nRelation using a set of 256 COSMOS and GOODS galaxies in the redshift range\n1.90 < z < 2.35. We present the galaxies' rest-frame optical emission-line\nfluxes derived from IR-grism spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and\ncombine these data with star formation rates and stellar masses obtained from\ndeep, multi-wavelength (rest-frame UV to IR) photometry. We then compare these\nmeasurements to those for a local sample of galaxies carefully matched in\nstellar mass (7.5 < log(M*/Msol) < 10.5) and star formation rate (-0.5 <\nlog(SFR) < 2.5 in Msol yr^-1). We find that the distribution of z ~ 2.1\ngalaxies in stellar mass-SFR-metallicity space is clearly different from that\nderived for our sample of similarly bright (L_H\\b{eta} > 3 . 10^40 ergs s^-1)\nlocal galaxies, and this offset cannot be explained by simple systematic\noffsets in the derived quantities. At stellar masses above ~10^9 Msol and star\nformation rates above ~10 Msol yr^-1, the z ~ 2.1 galaxies have higher oxygen\nabundances than their local counterparts, while the opposite is true for\nlower-mass, lower-SFR systems.\n", "  NGC147, NGC185 and CassiopeiaII (CassII) have similar positions in the sky,\ndistances and measured line of sight velocities. This proximity in phase space\nsuggests that these three satellites of M31 form a subgroup within the Local\nGroup. Nevertheless, the differences in their star formation history and\ninterstellar medium, and the recent discovery of a stellar stream in NGC~147,\ncombined with the lack of tidal features in the other two satellites, are all\nindications of complex and diverse interactions between M31 and these three\nsatellites. We use a genetic algorithm to explore the different orbits that\nthese satellites can have and select six sets of orbits that could best explain\nthe observational features of the NGC147, NGC185 and CassII satellites. The\nparameters of these orbits are then used as a starting point for N-body\nsimulations. We present models for which NGC147, NGC185 and CassII are a bound\ngroup for a total time of at least one Gyr but still undergo different\ninteractions with M31 and as a result NGC147 has a clear stellar stream whereas\nthe other two satellites have no significant tidal features. This result shows\nthat it is possible to find solutions that reproduce the contrasting properties\nof the satellites and for which NGC147-NGC185-CassII have been gravitationally\nbound.\n", "  We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the HCN\\,(3--2) and\nHCO$^+$\\,(3--2) molecular lines toward the W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH) star-forming\ncomplexes. Infall and outflow motions in the W3(H$_2$O) have been characterized\nby observing HCN and HCO$^+$ transitions. High-velocity blue/red-shifted\nemission, tracing the outflow, show multiple knots, which might originate in\nepisodic and precessing outflows. `Blue-peaked' line profiles indicate that gas\nis infalling onto the W3(H$_2$O) dust core. The measured large mass accretion\nrate, 2.3$\\times$10$^{-3}$~M$_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, together with the small\nfree-fall time scale, 5$\\times$10$^{3}$~yr, suggest W3(H$_2$O) is in an early\nevolutionary stage of the process of formation of high-mass stars. For the\nW3(OH), a two-layer model fit to the HCN and HCO$^+$ spectral lines and\nSpizter/IRAC images support that the W3(OH) H{\\sc ii} region is expanding and\ninteracting with the ambient gas, with the shocked neutral gas being expanding\nwith an expansion timescale of 6.4$\\times$10$^{3}$~yr. The observations suggest\ndifferent kinematical timescales and dynamical states for the W3(H$_2$O) and\nW3(OH).\n", "  We quantify the effect of observational spectroscopic and asteroseismic\nuncertainties on regularised least squares (RLS) inversions for the radial\ndifferential rotation of Sun-like and subgiant stars. We first solved the\nforward problem to model rotational splittings plus the observed uncertainties\nfor models of a Sun-like star, HD 52265, and a subgiant star, KIC 7341231. We\nrandomly perturbed the parameters of the stellar models within the\nuncertainties of the spectroscopic and asteroseismic constraints and used these\nperturbed stellar models to compute rotational splittings. We experimented with\nthree rotation profiles: solid body rotation, a step function, and a smooth\nrotation profile decreasing with radius. We then solved the inverse problem to\ninfer the radial differential rotation profile using a RLS inversion and\nkernels from the best-fit stellar model.We found that the inversions for\nSun-like stars with solar-like radial differential rotation profiles are\ninsensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar models. We found that when the\nrotation rate below the convection zone is increased to six times that of the\nsurface rotation rate the inferred rotation profile excluded solid body\nrotation. With the current observational uncertainties, we found that\ninversions of subgiant stars are sensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar\nmodel. Our findings suggest that inversions for the radial differential\nrotation of subgiant stars would benefit from more tightly constrained stellar\nmodels. In Sun-like stars, the insensitivity of the inversions to stellar model\nuncertainties suggests that it may be possible to perform ensemble inversions\nfor the average radial differential rotation of many stars with a range of\nstellar types to better constrain the inversions.\n", "  Spatially resolved kinematics have been used to determine the dynamical\nstatus of star-forming galaxies with ambiguous morphologies, and constrain the\nimportance of galaxy interactions during the assembly of galaxies. However,\nmeasuring the importance of interactions or galaxy merger rates requires\nknowledge of the systematics in kinematic diagnostics and the visible time with\nmerger indicators. We analyze the dynamics of star-forming gas in a set of\nbinary merger hydrodynamic simulations with stellar mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:4.\nWe find that the evolution of kinematic asymmetries traced by star-forming gas\nmirrors morphological asymmetries derived from mock optical images, in which\nboth merger indicators show the largest deviation from isolated disks during\nstrong interaction phases. Based on a series of simulations with various\ninitial disk orientations, orbital parameters, gas fractions, and mass ratios,\nwe find that the merger signatures are visible for ~0.2-0.4 Gyr with kinematic\nmerger indicators but can be approximately twice as long for equal-mass mergers\nof massive gas-rich disk galaxies designed to be analogs of z~2-3 submillimeter\ngalaxies. Merger signatures are most apparent after the second passage and\nbefore the black holes coalescence, but in some cases they persist up to\nseveral hundred Myr after coalescence. About 20-60% of the simulated galaxies\nare not identified as mergers during the strong interaction phase, implying\nthat galaxies undergoing violent merging process do not necessarily exhibit\nhighly asymmetric kinematics in their star-forming gas. The lack of\nidentifiable merger signatures in this population can lead to an\nunderestimation of merger abundances in star-forming galaxies, and including\nthem in samples of star-forming disks may bias the measurements of disk\nproperties such as intrinsic velocity dispersion.\n", "  We present new deep photometry of the globular cluster system (GCS) around\nNGC 6166, the central supergiant galaxy in Abell 2199. HST data from the ACS\nand WFC3 cameras in F475W, F814W are used to determine the spatial distribution\nof the GCS, its metallicity distribution function (MDF), and the dependence of\nthe MDF on galactocentric radius and on GC luminosity. The MDF is extremely\nbroad, with the classic red and blue subpopulations heavily overlapped, but a\ndouble-Gaussian model can still formally match the MDF closely. The spatial\ndistribution follows a Sersic-like profile detectably to a projected radius of\nat least $R_{gc} = 250$ kpc. To that radius, the total number of clusters in\nthe system is N_{GC} = 39000 +- 2000, the global specific frequency is S_N =\n11.2 +- 0.6, and 57\\% of the total are blue, metal-poor clusters. The GCS may\nfade smoothly into the Intra-Cluster Medium of A2199; we see no clear\ntransition from the core of the galaxy to the cD halo or the ICM. The radial\ndistribution, projected ellipticity, and mean metallicity of the red\n(metal-richer) clusters match the halo light extremely well for R > 15 kpc,\nboth of them varying as \\sigma_{MRGC} ~ \\sigma_{light} ~ R^-1.8. By comparison,\nthe blue (metal-poor) GC component has a much shallower falloff \\sigma_{MPGC} ~\nR^-1.0 and a more nearly spherical distribution. This strong difference in\ntheir density distributions produces a net metallicity gradient in the GCS as a\nwhole that is primarily generated by the population gradient. With NGC 6166 we\nappear to be penetrating into a regime of high enough galaxy mass and rich\nenough environment that the bimodal two-phase description of GC formation is no\nlonger as clear or effective as it has been in smaller galaxies.\n", "  The emergence of the I-Love-Q relations, revealing that the moment of\ninertia, the tidal Love number (deformability) and the spin-induced quadrupole\nmoment of compact stars are, to high accuracy, interconnected in a universal\nway disregarding the wide variety of equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter,\nhas attracted much interest recently. However, the physical origin of these\nrelations is still a debatable issue. In the present paper, we focus on the\nI-Love relation for self-bound stars (SBSs) such as incompressible stars and\nquark stars. We formulate perturbative expansions for the moment of inertia,\nthe tidal Love number (deformability) and the I-Love relation of SBSs. By\ncomparing the respective I-Love relations of incompressible stars and a\nspecific kind of SBSs, we show analytically that the I-Love relation is, to\nrelevant leading orders in stellar compactness, stationary with respect to\nchanges in the EOS about the incompressible limit. Hence, the universality of\nthe I-Love relation is indeed attributable to the proximity of compact stars to\nincompressible stars, and the stationarity of the relation as unveiled here. We\nalso discover that the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability of a SBS\nwith finite compressibility are, to leading order in compactness, equal to\ntheir counterparts of an incompressible star with an adjusted compactness, thus\nleading to a novel explanation for the I-Love universal relation.\n", "  We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the $gg \\to W^+\nW^- \\to l^+_1 \\nu_1 l^-_2 \\bar \\nu_2$ process, mediated by a massless quark\nloop, at the LHC. This process first contributes to the hadroproduction of\n$W^+W^-$ at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$, but, nevertheless, has a sizable impact\non the total production rate. We find that the NLO QCD corrections to the $gg\n\\to W^+W^-$ process amount to ${\\cal O}(50)$%, and increase the NNLO QCD cross\nsections of $pp \\to W^+W^-$ by approximately two percent, at both the 8 TeV and\n13 TeV LHC. We also compute the NLO corrections to gluonic $W^+W^-$ production\nwithin a fiducial volume used by the ATLAS collaboration in their 8 TeV\nmeasurement of the $W^+W^-$ production rate and find that the QCD corrections\nare significantly smaller than in the inclusive case. While the current\nexperimental uncertainties are still too large to make these differences\nrelevant, the observed strong dependence of perturbative corrections on\nkinematic cuts underscores that extrapolation from a fiducial measurement to\nthe total cross section is an extremely delicate matter, and calls for the\ndirect comparison of fiducial volume measurements with corresponding\ntheoretical computations.\n", "  Eigenvalue distributions of properly regularized Wilson loop operators are\nused to study the transition from ultra-violet (UV) behavior to infra-red (IR)\nbehavior in gauge theories coupled to matter that potentially have an IR fixed\npoint (FP). We numerically demonstrate emergence of scale invariance in a\nmatrix model that describes $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to two flavors of\nmassless adjoint fermions in the large $N$ limit. The eigenvalue distribution\nof Wilson loops of varying sizes cannot be described by a universal lattice\nbeta-function connecting the UV to the IR.\n", "  We use linear perturbation theory to investigate how a groove in the phase\nspace of a disc galaxy changes the stellar disc's stability properties. Such a\ngroove is a narrow trough around a fixed angular momentum from which most stars\nhave been removed, rendering part of the disc unresponsive to spiral waves. We\nfind that a groove can dramatically alter a disc's eigenmode spectrum by giving\nrise to a set of vigorously growing eigenmodes. These eigenmodes are particular\nto the grooved disc and are absent from the original ungrooved disc's mode\nspectrum. We discuss the properties and possible origin of the different\nfamilies of new modes.\n  By the very nature of our technique, we prove that a narrow phase-space\ngroove can be a source of rapidly growing spiral patterns that are true\neigenmodes of the grooved disc and that no non-linear processes need to be\ninvoked to explain their presence in N-body simulations of disc galaxies. Our\nresults lend support to the idea that spiral structure can be a recurrent\nphenomenon, in which one generation of spiral modes alters a disc galaxy's\nphase space in such a way that a following generation of modes is destabilized.\n", "  We present time series photometry of 57 variable stars in the cluster region\nNGC 7380. The association of these variable stars to the cluster NGC 7380 has\nbeen established on the basis of two colour diagrams and colour-magnitude\ndiagrams. Seventeen stars are found to be main-sequence variables, which are\nmainly B type stars and are classified as slowly pulsating B stars, $\\beta$ Cep\nor $\\delta$ Scuti stars. Some of them may belong to new class variables as\ndiscussed by Mowlavi et al. (2013) and Lata et al. (2014). Present sample also\ncontains 14 pre-main-sequence stars, whose ages and masses are found to be\nmostly $\\lesssim$ 5 Myr and range 0.60 $\\lesssim M/M_{\\odot} \\lesssim$ 2.30 and\nhence should be T-Tauri stars. About half of the weak line T-Tauri stars are\nfound to be fast rotators with a period of $\\lesssim$ 2 days as compared to the\nclassical T-Tauri stars. Some of the variables belong to the field star\npopulation.\n", "  We compare the observed size distribution of circum stellar disks in the\nOrion Trapezium cluster with the results of $N$-body simulations in which we\nincorporated an heuristic prescription for the evolution of these disks. In our\nsimulations, the sizes of stellar disks are affected by close encounters with\nother stars (with disks). We find that the observed distribution of disk sizes\nin the Orion Trapezium cluster is excellently reproduced by truncation due to\ndynamical encounters alone. The observed distribution appears to be a sensitive\nmeasure of the past dynamical history of the cluster, and therewith on the\nconditions of the cluster at birth. The best comparison between the observed\ndisk size distribution and the simulated distribution is realized with a\ncluster of $N = 2500\\pm500$ stars with a half-mass radius of about 0.5\\,pc in\nvirial equilibrium (with a virial ratio of $Q = 0.5$, or somewhat colder $Q\n\\simeq 0.3$), and with a density structure according to a fractal dimension of\n$F \\simeq 1.6$. Simulations with these parameters reproduce the observed\ndistribution of circum stellar disks in about 0.2--0.5\\,Myr.\n", "  We investigate the upper chromosphere and the transition region of the\nsunspot umbra using the radio brightness temperature at 34 GHz (corresponding\nto 8.8-mm observations) as observed by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH).\nRadio free-free emission in the longer millimeter range is generated around the\ntransition region, and its brightness temperature yields the region's\ntemperature and density distribution. We use the NoRH data at 34 GHz by\napplying the Steer-CLEAN image synthesis. These data and the analysis method\nenable us to investigate the chromospheric structures in the longer millimeter\nrange with high spatial resolution and sufficient visibilities. We also perform\nsimultaneous observations of one sunspot using the NoRH and the Nobeyama 45-m\ntelescope operating at 115 GHz. We determine that 115-GHz emission mainly\noriginates from the lower chromosphere while 34-GHz emission mainly originates\nfrom the upper chromosphere and transition region. These observational results\nare consistent with the radio emission characteristics estimated from the\ncurrent atmospheric models of the chromosphere. On the other hand, the observed\nbrightness temperature of the umbral region is almost the same as that of the\nquiet region. This result is inconsistent with the current sunspot models,\nwhich predict a considerably higher brightness temperature of the sunspot umbra\nat 34 GHz. This inconsistency suggests that the temperature of the region at\nwhich the 34 GHz radio emission becomes optically thick should be lower than\nthat predicted by the models.\n", "  Kepler-454 (KOI-273) is a relatively bright (V = 11.69 mag), Sun-like\nstarthat hosts a transiting planet candidate in a 10.6 d orbit. From\nspectroscopy, we estimate the stellar temperature to be 5687 +/- 50 K, its\nmetallicity to be [m/H] = 0.32 +/- 0.08, and the projected rotational velocity\nto be v sin i <2.4 km s-1. We combine these values with a study of the\nasteroseismic frequencies from short cadence Kepler data to estimate the\nstellar mass to be 1.028+0:04-0:03 M_Sun, the radius to be 1.066 +/- 0.012\nR_Sun and the age to be 5.25+1:41-1:39 Gyr. We estimate the radius of the 10.6\nd planet as 2.37 +/- 0.13 R_Earth. Using 63 radial velocity observations\nobtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and\n36 observations made with the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we\nmeasure the mass of this planet to be 6.8 +/- 1.4M_Earth. We also detect two\nadditional non-transiting companions, a planet with a minimum mass of 4.46 +/-\n0.12 M_J in a nearly circular 524 d orbit and a massive companion with a period\n>10 years and mass >12.1M_J . The twelve exoplanets with radii <2.7 R_Earth and\nprecise mass measurements appear to fall into two populations, with those <1.6\nR_Earth following an Earth-like composition curve and larger planets requiring\na significant fraction of volatiles. With a density of 2.76 +/- 0.73 g cm-3,\nKepler-454b lies near the mass transition between these two populations and\nrequires the presence of volatiles and/or H/He gas.\n", "  We show that the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle embedded in the surface of\na solid can be switched by surface acoustic waves (SAW) in the GHz frequency\nrange via a universal mechanism that does not depend on the structure of the\nparticle and the structure of the substrate. It is based upon generation of the\neffective ac magnetic field in the coordinate frame of the nanoparticle by the\nshear deformation of the surface due to SAW. The magnetization reversal occurs\nvia a consecutive absorption of surface phonons of the controlled variable\nfrequency. We derive analytical equations governing this process and solve them\nnumerically for the practical range of parameters.\n", "  Disk accretion at high rate onto a white dwarf or a neutron star has been\nsuggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (SL) - a belt-like\nstructure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadily\nspreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. To assess\nits basic characteristics we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nof supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for\ncooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of\nthe SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large scale\nacoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the\ntransport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be\ncharacterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g.\n$\\alpha$-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have\nimportant implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low mass X-ray\nbinaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives\neffective re-arrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties\nof the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and\nsusceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this\nevolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of\nthe SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only\nat intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has\ndecelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is\ndominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. We speculate that\nthis latitudinal non-uniformity of mixing in accreting white dwarfs may be\nlinked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical novae ejecta.\n", "  We present VLT/SINFONI J, H+K spectra of seven close visual pairs in M dwarf\nbinary/triple systems, discovered or observed by the AstraLux M dwarf survey.\nWe determine the spectral types to within 1.0 subclasses from comparison to\ntemplate spectra and the strength of K-band water absorption, and derive\neffective temperatures. The results are compared to optical spectral types of\nthe unresolved binary/multiple systems, and we confirm that our photometric\nmethod to derive spectral types in the AstraLux M dwarf survey is accurate. We\nlook for signs of youth such as chromospheric activity and low surface gravity,\nand find an age in the range 0.25-1 Gyr for the GJ 852 system. Strong Li\nabsorption is detected in optical spectra of the triple system J024902 obtained\nwith FEROS at the ESO-MPG 2.2m telescope. The equivalent width of the\nabsorption suggests an age consistent with the beta Pic moving group. However,\nfurther observations are needed to establish group membership. Ongoing orbital\nmonitoring will provide dynamical masses and thus calibration of evolutionary\nmodels for low mass stars.\n", "  We are performing a series of observations with ground-based telescopes\ntoward Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) in the $\\lambda$ Orionis complex in\norder to systematically investigate the effects of stellar feedback. In the\nparticular case of PGCC G192.32-11.88, we discovered an extremely young Class 0\nprotostellar object (G192N) and a proto-brown dwarf candidate (G192S). G192N\nand G192S are located in a gravitationally bound bright-rimmed clump. The\nvelocity and temperature gradients seen in line emission of CO isotopologues\nindicate that PGCC G192.32-11.88 is externally heated and compressed. G192N\nprobably has the lowest bolometric luminosity ($\\sim0.8$ L$_{\\sun}$) and\naccretion rate (6.3$\\times10^{-7}$ M$_{\\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$) when compared with\nother young Class 0 sources (e.g. PACS Bright Red sources (PBRs)) in the Orion\ncomplex. It has slightly larger internal luminosity ($0.21\\pm0.01$ L$_{\\sun}$)\nand outflow velocity ($\\sim$14 km~s$^{-1}$) than the predictions of first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs). G192N might be among the youngest Class 0 sources,\nwhich are slightly more evolved than a FHSC. Considering its low internal\nluminosity ($0.08\\pm0.01$ L$_{\\odot}$) and accretion rate (2.8$\\times10^{-8}$\nM$_{\\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$), G192S is an ideal proto-brown dwarf candidate. The star\nformation efficiency ($\\sim$0.3\\%-0.4\\%) and core formation efficiency\n($\\sim$1\\%) in PGCC G192.32-11.88 are significantly smaller than in other giant\nmolecular clouds or filaments, indicating that the star formation therein is\ngreatly suppressed due to stellar feedback.\n", "  SDSS J1021+1744 is a detached, eclipsing white dwarf / M dwarf binary\ndiscovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Outside the primary eclipse, the\nlight curves of such systems are usually smooth and characterised by low-level\nvariations caused by tidal distortion and heating of the M star component.\nEarly data on SDSS J1021+1744 obtained in June 2012 was unusual in showing a\ndip in flux of uncertain origin shortly after the white dwarf's eclipse. Here\nwe present high-time resolution, multi-wavelength observations of 35 more\neclipses over 1.3 years, showing that the dip has a lifetime extending over\nmany orbits. Moreover the \"dip\" is in fact a series of dips that vary in depth,\nnumber and position, although they are always placed in the phase interval 1.06\nto 1.26 after the white dwarf's eclipse, near the L5 point in this system.\nSince SDSS J1021+1744 is a detached binary, it follows that the dips are caused\nby the transit of the white dwarf by material around the Lagrangian L5 point. A\npossible interpretation is that they are the signatures of prominences, a\nphenomenon already known from H-alpha observations of rapidly rotating single\nstars as well as binaries. What makes SDSS J1021+1744 peculiar is that the\nmaterial is dense enough to block continuum light. The dips appear to have\nfinally faded out around 2015 May after the first detection by Parsons et al.\nin 2012, suggesting a lifetime of years.\n", "  Inspired by the close-proximity pair of planets in the Kepler-36 system, we\nconsider two effects that may have important ramifications for the development\nof life in similar systems where a pair of planets may reside entirely in the\nhabitable zone of the hosting star. Specifically, we run numerical simulations\nto determine whether strong, resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet\ninteractions can cause large variations in planet obliquity---thereby inducing\nlarge variations in climate. We also determine whether or not resonant\ninteractions affect the rate of lithopanspermia between the planet pair---which\ncould facilitate the growth and maintenance of life on both planets. We find\nthat first-order resonances do not cause larger obliquity variations compared\nwith non-resonant cases. We also find that resonant interactions are not a\nprimary consideration in lithopanspermia. Lithopanspermia is enhanced\nsignificantly as the planet orbits come closer together---reaching nearly the\nsame rate as ejected material falling back to the surface of the originating\nplanet (assuming that the ejected material makes it out to the location of our\ninitial conditions). Thus, in both cases our results indicate that\nclose-proximity planet pairs in multihabitable systems are conducive to life in\nthe system.\n", "  Absorption of high-energy radiation in planetary thermospheres is believed to\nlead to the formation of planetary winds. The resulting mass-loss rates can\naffect the evolution, particularly of small gas planets. We present 1D,\nspherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the escaping atmospheres of\n18 hot gas planets in the solar neighborhood. Our sample only includes strongly\nirradiated planets, whose expanded atmospheres may be detectable via transit\nspectroscopy. The simulations were performed with the PLUTO-CLOUDY interface,\nwhich couples a detailed photoionization and plasma simulation code with a\ngeneral MHD code. We study the thermospheric escape and derive improved\nestimates for the planetary mass-loss rates. Our simulations reproduce the\ntemperature-pressure profile measured via sodium D absorption in HD 189733 b,\nbut show unexplained differences in the case of HD 209458 b. In contrast to\ngeneral assumptions, we find that the gravitationally more tightly bound\nthermospheres of massive and compact planets, such as HAT-P-2 b are\nhydrodynamically stable. Compact planets dispose of the radiative energy input\nthrough hydrogen Ly$\\alpha$ and free-free emission. Radiative cooling is also\nimportant in HD 189733 b, but it decreases toward smaller planets like GJ 436\nb. The simulations show that the strong and cool winds of smaller planets\nmainly cause strong Ly$\\alpha$ absorption but little emission. Compact and\nmassive planets with hot, stable thermospheres cause small absorption signals\nbut are strong Ly$\\alpha$ emitters, possibly detectable with the current\ninstrumentation. The absorption and emission signals provide a possible\ndistinction between these two classes of thermospheres in hot gas planets.\nAccording to our results, WASP-80 and GJ 3470 are currently the most promising\ntargets for observational follow-up aimed at detecting atmospheric Ly$\\alpha$\nabsorption signals.\n", "  Jupiter and Saturn play host to an impressive array of satellites, making it\nreasonable to suspect that similar systems of moons might exist around giant\nextrasolar planets. Furthermore, a significant population of such planets is\nknown to reside at distances of several Astronomical Units (AU), leading to\nspeculation that some moons thereof might support liquid water on their\nsurfaces. However, giant planets are thought to undergo inward migration within\ntheir natal protoplanetary disks, suggesting that gas giants currently\noccupying their host star's habitable zone formed further out. Here we show\nthat when a moon-hosting planet undergoes inward migration, dynamical\ninteractions may naturally destroy the moon through capture into a so-called\n\"evection resonance.\" Within this resonance, the lunar orbit's eccentricity\ngrows until the moon eventually collides with the planet. Our work suggests\nthat moons orbiting within about 10 planetary radii are susceptible to this\nmechanism, with the exact number dependent upon the planetary mass, oblateness\nand physical size. Whether moons survive or not is critically related to where\nthe planet began its inward migration as well as the character of inter-lunar\nperturbations. For example, a Jupiter-like planet currently residing at 1AU\ncould lose moons if it formed beyond 5AU. Cumulatively, we suggest that an\nobservational census of exomoons could potentially inform us on the extent of\ninward planetary migration, for which no reliable observational proxy currently\nexists.\n", "  We study the rest-frame optical properties of 74 luminous (L_bol=10^46.2-48.2\nerg/s), 1.5<z<3.5 broad-line quasars with near-IR (JHK) slit spectroscopy.\nSystemic redshifts based on the peak of the [OIII]5007 line reveal that\nredshift estimates from the rest-frame UV broad emission lines (mostly MgII)\nare intrinsically uncertain by ~ 200 km/s (measurement errors accounted for).\nThe overall full-width-at-half-maximum of the narrow [OIII] line is ~ 1000 km/s\non average. A significant fraction of the total [OIII] flux (~ 40%) is in a\nblueshifted wing component with a median velocity offset of ~ 700 km/s,\nindicative of ionized outflows within a few kpc from the nucleus; we do not\nfind evidence of significant [OIII] flux beyond ~ 10 kpc in our slit\nspectroscopy. The [OIII] line is noticeably more asymmetric and weaker than\nthat in typical less luminous low-z quasars. However, when matched in quasar\ncontinuum luminosity, low-z quasars have similar [OIII] profiles and strengths\nas these high-z systems. Therefore the exceptionally large width and\nblueshifted wing, and the relatively weak strength of [OIII] in high-z luminous\nquasars are mostly a luminosity effect rather than redshift evolution. The\nHbeta-[OIII] region of these high-z quasars displays a similar spectral\ndiversity and Eigenvector 1 correlations with anti-correlated [OIII] and\noptical FeII strengths, as seen in low-z quasars; but the average broad Hbeta\nwidth is larger by 25% than typical low-z quasars, indicating more massive\nblack holes in these high-z systems. These results highlight the importance of\nunderstanding [OIII] emission in the general context of quasar parameter space\nin order to understand quasar feedback in the form of [OIII] outflows. The\ncalibrated one-dimensional near-IR spectra are made publicly available, along\nwith a composite spectrum.\n", "  We show that a significant correlation (up to 5sigma) emerges between the\nbulge index, defined to be larger for larger bulge/disk ratio, in spiral\ngalaxies with similar luminosities in the Galaxy Zoo 2 of SDSS and the number\nof tidal-dwarf galaxies in the catalogue by Kaviraj et al. (2012).\n  In the standard cold or warm dark-matter cosmological models the number of\nsatellite galaxies correlates with the circular velocity of the dark matter\nhost halo. In generalized-gravity models without cold or warm dark matter such\na correlation does not exist, because host galaxies cannot capture in-falling\ndwarf galaxies due to the absence of dark-matter-induced dynamical friction.\nHowever, in such models a correlation is expected to exist between the bulge\nmass and the number of satellite galaxies, because bulges and tidal-dwarf\nsatellite galaxies form in encounters between host galaxies. This is not\npredicted by dark matter models in which bulge mass and the number of\nsatellites are a priori uncorrelated because higher bulge/disk ratios do not\nimply higher dark/luminous ratios. Hence, our correlation reproduces the\nprediction of scenarios without dark matter, whereas an explanation is not\nfound readily from the a priori predictions of the standard scenario with dark\nmatter. Further research is needed to explore whether some application of the\nstandard theory may explain this correlation.\n", "  We examine the redshift evolution of standard strong emission-line\ndiagnostics for Hbeta-selected star-forming galaxies using the local SDSS\nsample and a new z = 0.2 - 2.3 sample obtained from HST WFC3 grism and Keck\nDEIMOS and MOSFIRE data. We use the SDSS galaxies to show that there is a\nsystematic dependence of the strong emission-line properties on Balmer-line\nluminosity, which we interpret as showing that both the N/O abundance and the\nionization parameter increase with increasing line luminosity. Allowing for the\nluminosity dependence tightens the diagnostic diagrams and the metallicity\ncalibrations. The combined SDSS and high-redshift samples show that there is no\nredshift evolution in the line properties once the luminosity correction is\napplied, i.e., all galaxies with a given L(Hbeta) have similar strong\nemission-line distributions at all the observed redshifts. We argue that the\nbest metal diagnostic for the high-redshift galaxies may be a\nluminosity-adjusted version of the [NII]6584/Halpha metallicity relation.\n", "  Shadow observations are the only way to observe emission from the galactic\nhalo (GH) and/or the circumgalactic medium (CGM) free of any foreground\ncontamination from local hot bubble (LHB) and solar wind charge exchange\n(SWCX). We analyzed data from a shadow observation in the direction of the high\nlatitude, neutral hydrogen cloud MBM 16 with \\Suzaku. We found that all\nemission can be accounted for by foreground emission from LHB and SWCX, plus\npower law emission associated with unresolved point sources. The GH/CGM in the\ndirection of MBM 16 is negligible or inexistent in our observation, with upper\nlimits on the emission measure of 9.5x10^{-4} pc cm^{-6} (90% C.L.), at the\nlowest end of current estimates.\n", "  We report the observation of efficient and low-noise frequency conversion\nbetween two microwave modes, mediated by the motion of a mechanical resonator\nsubjected to radiation pressure. We achieve coherent conversion of more than\n$10^{12}~\\mathrm{photons/s}$ with a $95\\mathrm{\\%}$ efficiency and a\n$14~\\mathrm{kHz}$ bandwidth. With less than $10^{-1}~\\mathrm{photons \\cdot\ns^{-1}\\cdot Hz^{-1}}$ of added noise, this optomechanical frequency converter\nis suitable for quantum state transduction. We show the ability to operate this\nconverter as a tunable beam splitter, with direct applications for photon\nrouting and communication through complex quantum networks.\n", "  Recent observations have revealed a variety of young star clusters, including\nembedded systems, young massive clusters, and associations. We study the\nformation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination of\nsimulations and theoretical models. Our simulations start with a turbulent\nmolecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. The stars are assumed to\nform in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-fall\ntimes of the molecular cloud. The dynamical evolution of these stellar\ndistributions are continued by means of direct $N$-body simulations. The\nmolecular clouds typical for the Milky Way Galaxy tend to form embedded\nclusters which evolve to resemble open clusters. The associations were\ninitially considerably more clumpy, but lost their irregularity in about a\ndynamical time scale due to the relaxation process. The densest molecular\nclouds, which are absent in the Milky Way but are typical in starburst\ngalaxies, form massive young star clusters. They indeed are rare in the Milky\nWay. Our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds to\nopen clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. The mass-radius\nrelation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches the\nobservations. According to our calculations the time evolution of the half-mass\nradius for open clusters and associations follows $r_{\\rm h}/{\\rm\npc}=2.7(t_{\\rm age}/{\\rm pc})^{2/3}$, whereas for massive star clusters $r_{\\rm\nh}/{\\rm pc}=0.34(t_{\\rm age}/{\\rm Myr})^{2/3}$. Both trends are consistent with\nthe observed age-mass-radius relation for clusters in the Milky Way.\n", "  We suggest a model of the advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with\nmagnetically driven outflows to explain hysteretic state transition observed in\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when\nthe mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical\nmass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.\nOur calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic\noutflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional\nADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\\beta\\sim 4$ in the disk. This\ncan naturally explain the hysteretic state transition observed in XRBs.\n", "  We have performed new medium resolution spectroscopy, optical and near\ninfrared photometry to monitor the variability of the AGB carbon star V 381\nLac. Our observations revealed rapid and deep changes in the spectrum and\nextreme variability in the optical and near infrared bands. Most notably we\nobserved the change of NaI D lines from deep absorption to emission, and the\nprogressive growing of the [N II] doublet 6548-6584 A emission, strongly\nrelated to the simultaneous photometric fading. V381 Lac occupies regions of\n2MASS and WISE colour-colour diagrams typical of stars with dust formation in\nthe envelope. The general framework emerging from the observations of V381 Lac\nis that of a cool AGB carbon star undergoing episodes of high mass ejection and\nsevere occultation of the stellar photosphere reminiscent of those\ncharacterising the RCB phenomenon.\n  Comparing the Spectral Energy Distribution obtained with the theoretical\nmodel for AGB evolution with dust in the circumstellar envelope, we can\nidentify V381 Lac as the descendant of a star of initial mass ~2M_sun, in the\nfinal AGB phases, evolved into a carbon star by repeated Third Dredge Up\nepisodes. According to our model the star is moderately obscured (tau_10 ~0.22)\nby dust, mainly formed by amorphous carbon (~80%) and SiC (~20%), with dust\ngrain dimensions around ~0.2 micron and 0.08 micron respectively.\n", "  The blazar 3C 279 exhibited twin $\\gamma$-ray flares of similar intensity in\n2013 December and 2014 April. In this work, we present a detailed\nmulti-wavelength analysis of the 2013 December flaring event. Multi-frequency\nobservations reveal the uncorrelated variability patterns with X-ray and\noptical-UV fluxes peaking after the $\\gamma$-ray maximum. The broadband\nspectral energy distribution (SED) at the peak of the $\\gamma$-ray activity\nshows a rising $\\gamma$-ray spectrum but a declining optical-UV flux. This\nobservation along with the detection of uncorrelated variability behavior rules\nout the one-zone leptonic emission scenario. We, therefore, adopt two\nindependent methodologies to explain the SED: a time dependent lepto-hadronic\nmodeling and a two-zone leptonic radiative modeling approach. In the\nlepto-hadronic modeling, a distribution of electrons and protons subjected to a\nrandomly orientated magnetic field produces synchrotron radiation. Electron\nsynchrotron is used to explain the IR to UV emission while proton synchrotron\nemission is used to explain the high energy $\\gamma$-ray emission. A\ncombination of both electron synchrotron self Compton emission and proton\nsynchrotron emission is used to explain the X-ray spectral break seen during\nthe later stage of the flare. In the two-zone modeling, we assume a large\nemission region emitting primarily in IR to X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays to come\nprimarily from a fast moving compact emission region. We conclude by noting\nthat within a span of 4 months, 3C 279 has shown the dominance of a variety of\nradiative processes over each other and this reflects the complexity involved\nin understanding the physical properties of blazar jets in general.\n", "  A sample of 477 solar-type binaries within 67pc with projected separations\nlarger than 50AU is studied by a new statistical method. Speed and direction of\nthe relative motion are determined from the short observed arcs or known\norbits, and their joint distribution is compared to the numerical simulations.\nBy inverting the observed distribution with the help of simulations, we find\nthat average eccentricity of wide binaries is 0.59+-0.02 and the eccentricity\ndistribution can be modeled as f(e) ~= 1.2 e + 0.4. However, wide binaries\ncontaining inner subsystems, i.e. triple or higher-order multiples, have\nsignificantly smaller eccentricities with the average e = 0.52+-0.05 and the\npeak at e ~ 0.5. We find that the catalog of visual orbits is strongly biased\nagainst large eccentricities. A marginal evidence of eccentricity increasing\nwith separation (or period) is found for this sample. Comparison with\nspectroscopic binaries proves the reality of the controversial\nperiod-eccentricity relation. The average eccentricity does increase with\nbinary period, being 0.39 for periods from 10^2 to 10^3 days and 0.59 for the\nbinaries studied here (10^5 to 10^6 days).\n", "  The extraordinary activity at Enceladus' warm south pole indicates the\npresence of an internal global or local reservoir of liquid water beneath the\nsurface. While Tyler (2009, 2011) has suggested that the geological activity\nand the large heat flow of Enceladus could result from tidal heating triggered\nby a large obliquity of at least 0.05{\\deg}-0.1{\\deg}, theoretical models of\nthe Cassini state predict the obliquity to be two to three orders of magnitude\nsmaller for an entirely solid and rigid Enceladus. We investigate the influence\nof an internal subsurface ocean and of tidal deformations of the solid layers\non the obliquity of Enceladus. Our Cassini state model takes into account the\nexternal torque exerted by Saturn on each layer of the satellite and the\ninternal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of the\nliquid layer. As a new feature, our model also includes additional torques that\narise because of the periodic tides experienced by the satellite. We find that\nthe upper limit for the obliquity of a solid Enceladus is 0.00045 degrees and\nis negligibly affected by elastic deformations. The presence of an internal\nocean decreases this upper limit by 13.1%, elasticity attenuating this decrease\nby only 0.5%. Since the obliquity of Enceladus cannot reach Tyler's\nrequirement, obliquity tides are unlikely to be the source of the large heat\nflow of Enceladus. More likely, the geological activity at Enceladus' south\npole results from eccentricity tides. Even in the most favorable case, the\nupper limit for the obliquity of Enceladus corresponds to about two meters at\nmost at the surface of Enceladus. This is well below the resolution of Cassini\nimages. Control point calculations cannot be used to detect the obliquity of\nEnceladus, let alone to constrain its interior from an obliquity measurement.\n", "  We compare the properties of gas flows on both the near and far side of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using Hubble Space Telescope UV\nabsorption-line observations toward an AGN behind (transverse) and a star\nwithin (down-the-barrel) the LMC disk at an impact parameter of 3.2 kpc. We\nfind that even in this relatively quiescent region gas flows away from the disk\nat speeds up to $\\sim$100 km/s in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low\nand high ions. The symmetric absorption profiles combined with previous surveys\nshowing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the LMC and provide\ncompelling evidence that the LMC drives a global, large-scale outflow across\nits disk, which is the likely result of a recent burst of star formation in the\nLMC. We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase, ionized by both\nphotoionization (SiII and SiIII) and collisional ionization (SiIV and CIV). We\nestimate a total mass and outflow rate to be $>10^7$ Msun and $>0.4$ Msun/yr.\nSince the velocity of this large-scale outflow does not reach the LMC escape\nvelocity, the gas removal is likely aided by either ram-pressure stripping with\nthe Milky Way halo or tidal interactions with the surrounding galaxies,\nimplying that the environment of LMC-like or dwarf galaxies plays an important\nrole in their ultimate gas starvation. Finally we reassess the mass and\nplausible origins of the high-velocity complex toward the LMC given its\nnewly-determined distance that places it in the lower Milky Way halo and\nsky-coverage that shows it extends well beyond the LMC disk.\n", "  We report on OH maser emission toward G336.644-0.695 (IRAS 16333-4807), which\nis a H2O maser-emitting Planetary Nebula (PN). We have detected 1612, 1667 and\n1720 MHz OH masers at two epochs using the Australia Telescope Compact Array\n(ATCA), hereby confirming it as the seventh known case of an OH-maser-emitting\nPN. This is only the second known PN showing 1720 MHz OH masers after K 3-35\nand the only evolved stellar object with 1720 MHz OH masers as the strongest\ntransition. This PN is one of a group of very young PNe. The 1612 MHz and 1667\nMHz masers are at a similar velocity to the 22 GHz H2O masers, whereas the 1720\nMHz masers show a variable spectrum, with several components spread over a\nhigher velocity range (up to 36 km/s). We also detect Zeeman splitting in the\n1720 MHz transition at two epochs (with field strengths of ~2 to ~10 mG), which\nsuggests the OH emission at 1720 MHz is formed in a magnetized environment.\nThese 1720 MHz OH masers may trace short-lived equatorial ejections during the\nformation of the PN.\n", "  For the first time, we demonstrate how an MHD avalanche might occur in a\nmulti-threaded coronal loop. Considering 23 non-potential magnetic threads\nwithin a loop, we use 3D MHD simulations to show that only one thread needs to\nbe unstable in order to start an avalanche even when the others are below\nmarginal stability. This has significant implications for coronal heating in\nthat it provides for energy dissipation with a trigger mechanism. The\ninstability of the unstable thread follows the evolution determined in many\nearlier investigations. However, once one stable thread is disrupted, it\ncoalesces with a neighbouring thread and this process disrupts other nearby\nthreads. Coalescence with these disrupted threads then occurs leading to the\ndisruption of yet more threads as the avalanche develops. Magnetic energy is\nreleased in discrete bursts as the surrounding stable threads are disrupted.\nThe volume integrated heating, as a function of time, shows short spikes\nsuggesting that the temporal form of the heating is more like that of\n\\textit{nanoflares} than of constant heating.\n", "  M 2 has been claimed to posses three distinct stellar components that are\nenhanced in iron relative to each other. We use equivalent width measurements\nfrom 14 red giant branch stars from which Yong et al. detect a $\\sim$0.8 dex\nwide, trimodal iron distribution to redetermine the metallicity of the cluster.\nIn contrast to Yong et al., which derive atmospheric parameters following only\nthe classical spectroscopic approach, we perform the chemical analysis using\nthree different methods to constrain effective temperatures and surface\ngravities. When atmospheric parameters are derived spectroscopically, we\nmeasure a trimodal metallicity distribution, that well resembles that by Yong\net al. We find that the metallicity distribution from Fe II lines strongly\ndiffers from the distribution obtained from Fe I features when photometric\ngravities are adopted. The Fe I distribution mimics the metallicity\ndistribution obtained using spectroscopic parameters, while the Fe II shows the\npresence of only two stellar groups with metallicity [Fe/H]$\\simeq$-1.5 and\n-1.1 dex, which are internally homogeneous in iron. This finding, when coupled\nwith the high-resolution photometric evidence, demonstrates that M 2 is\ncomposed by a dominant population ($\\sim$99%) homogeneous in iron and a\nminority component ($\\sim$1%) enriched in iron with respect to the main cluster\npopulation.\n", "  The energy densities in magnetic fields and cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxies are\noften assumed to be in equipartition, allowing for an indirect estimate of the\nmagnetic field strength from the observed radio synchrotron spectrum. However,\nboth primary and secondary CRs contribute to the synchrotron spectrum, and the\nCR electrons also loose energy via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton. While\nclassical equipartition formulae avoid these intricacies, there have been\nrecent revisions that account for the extreme conditions in starbursts. Yet,\nthe application of the equipartition formula to starburst environments also\npresupposes that timescales are long enough to reach equilibrium. Here, we test\nequipartition in the central molecular zones (CMZs) of nearby starburst\ngalaxies by modeling the observed gamma-ray spectra, which provide a direct\nmeasure of the CR energy density, and the radio spectra, which provide a probe\nof the magnetic field strength. We find that in starbursts, the magnetic field\nenergy density is significantly larger than the CR energy density,\ndemonstrating that the equipartition argument is frequently invalid for CMZs.\n", "  We report results of a spectral and timing analysis of the poorly studied\ntransient X-ray pulsar 2S 1553-542 using data collected with the NuSTAR and\nChandra observatories and the Fermi/GBM instrument during an outburst in 2015.\nProperties of the source at high energies (>30 keV) are studied for the first\ntime and the sky position had been essentially improved. The source broadband\nspectrum has a quite complicated shape and can be reasonably described by a\ncomposite model with two continuum components - a black body emission with the\ntemperature about 1 keV at low energies and a power law with an exponential\ncutoff at high energies. Additionally an absorption feature at $\\sim23.5$ keV\nis discovered both in phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra and interpreted\nas the cyclotron resonance scattering feature corresponding to the magnetic\nfield strength of the neutron star $B\\sim3\\times10^{12}$ G. Based on the\nFermi/GBM data the orbital parameters of the system were substantially\nimproved, that allowed us to determine the spin period of the neutron star P =\n9.27880(3) s and a local spin-up $\\dot P \\simeq -7.5\\times10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$\ndue to the mass accretion during the NuSTAR observations. Assuming accretion\nfrom the disk and using standard torque models we have estimated the distance\nto the system $d=20\\pm4$ kpc.\n", "  HFG1 is the first well observed planetary nebula (PN) which reveals a\ncometary-like structure. Its main morphological features consist of a bow\nshaped shell, which surrounds the central star, accompanied by a long\ncollimated tail. In this study we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations modeling the formation of HFG1 from the interaction of the local\nambient medium with the mass outflows of its Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nprogenitor star. We attribute the cometary appearance of HFG1 to the systemic\nmotion of the PN with respect to the local ambient medium. Due to its vital\nimportance, we re-estimate the distance of HFG1 by modeling the spectral energy\ndistribution of its central star, V664 Cas, and we find a distance of $ 490 \\pm\n50$ pc. Our simulations show that none of our models with time invariant\nstellar wind and ambient medium properties are able to reproduce simultaneously\nthe extended bow shock and the collimated tail observed in HFG1. Given this, we\nincrease the complexity of our modeling considering that the stellar wind is\ntime variable. The wind description is based on the predictions of the AGB and\npost-AGB evolution models. Testing a grid of models we find that the properties\nof HFG1 are best reproduced by the mass outflows of a 3 Msun AGB star. Such a\nscenario is consistent with the current observed properties of V664 Cas primary\nstar, an O-type subdwarf, and bridges the evolutionary history of HFG1 central\nstar with the observables of the PN. We discuss the implications of our study\nin the understanding of the evolution of AGB/post-AGB stars towards the\nformation of O-type subdwarfs surrounded by PNe.\n", "  The properties of non-statistical equilibrium ionization of silicon and\noxygen ions are analyzed in this work. We focus on four solar targets (quiet\nsun, coronal hole, plage, quiescent active region, AR, and flaring AR) as\nobserved with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). IRIS is best\nsuited for this work due to the high cadence (up to 0.5s), high spatial\nresolution (up to 0.32\"), and high signal to noise ratios for O IV and Si IV.\nWe find that the observed intensity ratio between lines of three times ionized\nsilicon and oxygen ions depends on their total intensity and that this\ncorrelation varies depending on the region observed (quiet sun, coronal holes,\nplage or active regions) and on the specific observational objects present\n(spicules, dynamic loops, jets, micro-flares or umbra). In order to interpret\nthe observations, we compare them with synthetic profiles taken from 2D\nself-consistent radiative MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere, where the\nstatistical equilibrium or non-equilibrium treatment silicon and oxygen is\napplied. These synthetic observations show vaguely similar correlations as in\nthe observations, i.e. between the intensity ratios and their intensities, but\nonly in the non-equilibrium case do we find that (some of) the observations can\nbe reproduced. We conclude that these lines are formed out of statistical\nequilibrium. We use our time-dependent non-equilibrium ionization simulations\nto describe the physical mechanisms behind these observed properties.\n", "  In theory of superconducting junctions, Green's function has an important\nrole to obtain Andreev bound states, local density of states and Josephson\ncurrent in a systematic way. In this article, we show how to construct Green's\nfunction on the surface of topological insulator following McMillan's formalism\nwhere the energy spectrum of electrons obeys a linear dispersion. For a model\nof superconductor (S)/ferromagnet (F)/normal metal (N) junction, we show that\nthe generation of Majorana Fermion gives rise to the enhanced local density of\nstates and pair amplitude of odd-frequency pairing. We also derive an extended\nFurusaki-Tsukada's formula of d.c. Josephson current in S/F/S junctions. The\nobtained Josephson current depends on the direction and magnitude of the\nmagnetization.\n", "  IRAS 17256-3631 is a southern Galactic massive star forming region located at\na distance of 2 kpc. In this paper, we present a multiwavelength investigation\nof the embedded cluster, the HII region, as well as the parent cloud. Radio\nimages at 325, 610 and 1372 MHz were obtained using GMRT, India while the\nnear-infrared imaging and spectroscopy were carried out using UKIRT and Mt. Abu\nInfrared Telescope, India. The near-infrared K-band image reveals the presence\nof a partially embedded infrared cluster. The spectral features of the\nbrightest star in the cluster, IRS-1, spectroscopically agrees with a late O or\nearly B star and could be the driving source of this region. Filamentary H_2\nemission detected towards the outer envelope indicates presence of highly\nexcited gas. The parent cloud is investigated at far-infrared to millimeter\nwavelengths and eighteen dust clumps have been identified. The spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of these clumps have been fitted as modified blackbodies\nand the best-fit peak temperatures are found to range from 14-33 K, while the\ncolumn densities vary from 0.7-8.5x10^22 cm^-2. The radio maps show a cometary\nmorphology for the distribution of ionized gas that is density bounded towards\nthe north-west and ionization bounded towards the south-east. This morphology\nis better explained with the champagne flow model as compared to the bow shock\nmodel. Using observations at near, mid and far-infrared, submillimeter and\nradio wavelengths, we examine the evolutionary stages of various clumps.\n", "  We find a connection between logarithmic formation probabilities of two\ndisjoint intervals of quantum critical spin chains and the Casimir energy of\ntwo aligned needles in two dimensional classical critical systems. Using this\nconnection we provide a formula for the logarithmic formation probability of\ntwo disjoint intervals in generic $1+1$ dimensional critical systems. The\nquantity is depenedent on the full structure of the underlying conformal field\ntheory and so useful to find the universality class of the critical system. The\nconnection that we find also provides a very efficient numerical method to\ncalculate the Casimir energy between needles using quantum critical chains. The\nagreement between numerical results performed on critical transverse field\nIsing model and XX chain with our exact results is very good. We also comment\non the mutual R\\'enyi information of two disjoint intervals.\n", "  The Ngari (Ali) prefecture of Tibet, one of the highest areas in the world,\nhas recently emerged as a promising site for future astronomical observation.\nHere we use 31 years of reanalysis data from the Climate Forecast System\nReanalysis (CFSR) to examine the astroclimatology of Ngari, using the\nrecently-erected Ali Observatory at Shiquanhe (5~047~m above mean sea level) as\nthe representative site. We find the percentage of photometric night, median\natmospheric seeing and median precipitable water vapor (PWV) of the Shiquanhe\nsite to be $57\\%$, $0.8\"$ and 2.5~mm, comparable some of the world's best\nastronomical observatories. Additional calculation supports the Shiquanhe\nregion as one of the better sites for astronomical observations over the\nTibetan Plateau. Based on the studies taken at comparable environment at\nAtacama, extraordinary observing condition may be possible at the few\nvehicle-accessible 6~000~m heights in the Shiquanhe region. Such possibility\nshould be thoroughly investigated in future.\n", "  We present the catalog of optical and infrared counterparts of the Chandra\nCOSMOS-Legacy Survey, a 4.6 Ms Chandra program on the 2.2 square degrees of the\nCOSMOS field, combination of 56 new overlapping observations obtained in Cycle\n14 with the previous C-COSMOS survey. In this Paper we report the i, K, and 3.6\nmicron identifications of the 2273 X-ray point sources detected in the new\nCycle 14 observations. We use the likelihood ratio technique to derive the\nassociation of optical/infrared (IR) counterparts for 97% of the X-ray sources.\nWe also update the information for the 1743 sources detected in C-COSMOS, using\nnew K and 3.6 micron information not available when the C-COSMOS analysis was\nperformed. The final catalog contains 4016 X-ray sources, 97% of which have an\noptical/IR counterpart and a photometric redshift, while 54% of the sources\nhave a spectroscopic redshift. The full catalog, including spectroscopic and\nphotometric redshifts and optical and X-ray properties described here in\ndetail, is available online. We study several X-ray to optical (X/O)\nproperties: with our large statistics we put better constraints on the X/O flux\nratio locus, finding a shift towards faint optical magnitudes in both soft and\nhard X-ray band. We confirm the existence of a correlation between X/O and the\nthe 2-10 keV luminosity for Type 2 sources. We extend to low luminosities the\nanalysis of the correlation between the fraction of obscured AGN and the hard\nband luminosity, finding a different behavior between the optically and X-ray\nclassified obscured fraction.\n", "  Previous studies of the nonlinear regime of the magnetorotational instability\nin one particular type of shearing box model -- unstratified with no net\nmagnetic flux -- find that without explicit dissipation (viscosity and\nresistivity) the saturation amplitude decreases with increasing numerical\nresolution. We show that this result is strongly dependent on the vertical\naspect ratio of the computational domain $L_z/L_x$. When $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$,\nwe recover previous results. However, when the vertical domain is extended\n$L_z/L_x \\gtrsim 2.5$, we find the saturation level of the stress is greatly\nincreased (giving a ratio of stress to pressure $\\alpha \\gtrsim 0.1$), and\nmoreover the results are independent of numerical resolution. Consistent with\nprevious results, we find that saturation of the MRI in this regime is\ncontrolled by a cyclic dynamo which generates patches of strong toroidal field\nthat switches sign on scales of $L_x$ in the vertical direction. We speculate\nthat when $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$, the dynamo is inhibited by the small size of the\nvertical domain, leading to the puzzling dependence of saturation amplitude on\nresolution. We show that previous toy models developed to explain the MRI\ndynamo are consistent with our results, and that the cyclic pattern of toroidal\nfields observed in stratified shearing box simulations (leading to the\nso-called butterfly diagram) may also be related. In tall boxes the saturation\namplitude is insensitive to whether or not explicit dissipation is included in\nthe calculations, at least for large magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl number.\nFinally, we show MRI turbulence in tall domains has a smaller critical\n$\\rm{Pm}_c$, and an extended lifetime compared to $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$ boxes.\n", "  We model the vertical structure of magnetized accretion disks subject to\nviscous and resistive heating, and irradiation by the central star. We apply\nour formalism to the radial structure of magnetized accretion disks threaded by\na poloidal magnetic field dragged during the process of star formation\ndeveloped by Shu and coworkers. We consider disks around low mass protostars, T\nTauri, and FU Orionis stars. We consider two levels of disk magnetization,\n$\\lambda_{sys} = 4$ (strongly magnetized disks), and $\\lambda_{sys} = 12$\n(weakly magnetized disks). The rotation rates of strongly magnetized disks have\nlarge deviations from Keplerian rotation. In these models, resistive heating\ndominates the thermal structure for the FU Ori disk. The T Tauri disk is very\nthin and cold because it is strongly compressed by magnetic pressure; it may be\ntoo thin compared with observations. Instead, in the weakly magnetized disks,\nrotation velocities are close to Keplerian, and resistive heating is always\nless than 7\\% of the viscous heating. In these models, the T Tauri disk has a\nlarger aspect ratio, consistent with that inferred from observations. All the\ndisks have spatially extended hot atmospheres where the irradiation flux is\nabsorbed, although most of the mass ($\\sim 90-95$ \\%) is in the disk midplane.\nWith the advent of ALMA one expects direct measurements of magnetic fields and\ntheir morphology at disk scales. It will then be possible to determine the\nmass-to-flux ratio of magnetized accretion disks around young stars, an\nessential parameter for their structure and evolution. Our models contribute to\nthe understanding of the vertical structure and emission of these disks.\n", "  Globular clusters (GCs) can be considered discrete, long-lived, dynamical\ntracers that retain crucial information about the assembly history of their\nparent galaxy. In this paper, we present a new catalogue of GC velocities and\ncolours for the lenticular galaxy NGC 1023, we study their kinematics and\nspatial distribution, in comparison with the underlying stellar kinematics and\nsurface brightness profile, and we test a new method for studying GC\nproperties. Specifically, we decompose the galaxy light into its spheroid\n(assumed to represent the bulge + halo components) and disk components and use\nit to assign to each GC a probability of belonging to one of the two\ncomponents. Then we model the galaxy kinematics, assuming a disk and spheroidal\ncomponent, using planetary nebulae (PNe) and integrated stellar light. We use\nthis kinematic model and the probability previously obtained from the\nphotometry to recalculate for each GC its likelihood of being associated with\nthe disk, the spheroid, or neither. We find that the reddest GCs are likely to\nbe associated with the disk, as found for faint fuzzies in this same galaxy,\nsuggesting that the disk of this S0 galaxy originated at z ~ 2. The majority of\nblue GCs are found likely to be associated with the spheroidal (hot) component.\nThe method also allows us to identify objects that are unlikely to be in\nequilibrium with the system. In NGC1023 some of the rejected GCs form a\nsubstructure in phase space that is connected with NGC 1023 companion galaxy.\n", "  We present supporting evidence for the first association of a Fermi source,\n3FGLJ1330.0-3818, with the FR0 radio galaxy Tol1326-379. FR0s represent the\nmajority of the local radio loud AGN population but their nature is still\nunclear. They share the same properties of FRIs from the point of view of the\nnuclear and host properties, but they show a large deficit of extended radio\nemission. Here we show that FR0s can emit photons at very high energies.\nTol1326-379 has a GeV luminosity of $L_{>1~{\\rm GeV}} \\sim 2\\times10^{42}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, typical of FRIs, but with a steeper $\\gamma$-ray spectrum\n($\\Gamma=2.78\\pm 0.14$). This could be related to the intrinsic jet properties\nbut also to a different viewing angle.\n", "  We are entering an era of unprecedented quantities of data from current and\nplanned survey telescopes. To maximise the potential of such surveys, automated\ndata analysis techniques are required. Here we implement a new methodology for\nvariable star classification, through the combination of Kohonen Self\nOrganising Maps (SOM, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) and the more\ncommon Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning technique. We apply this\nmethod to data from the K2 mission fields 0-4, finding 154 ab-type RR Lyraes\n(10 newly discovered), 377 Delta Scuti pulsators, 133 Gamma Doradus pulsators,\n183 detached eclipsing binaries, 290 semi-detached or contact eclipsing\nbinaries and 9399 other periodic (mostly spot-modulated) sources, once class\nsignificance cuts are taken into account. We present lightcurve features for\nall K2 stellar targets, including their three strongest detected frequencies,\nwhich can be used to study stellar rotation periods where the observed\nvariability arises from spot modulation. The resulting catalogue of variable\nstars, classes, and associated data features are made available online. We\npublish our SOM code in Python as part of the open source PyMVPA package, which\nin combination with already available RF modules can be easily used to recreate\nthe method.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are an established and powerful test-bed for theories of both\ngalaxy evolution and cosmology. Accurate interpretation of cluster observations\noften requires robust identification of the location of the centre. Using a\nstatistical sample of clusters drawn from a suite of cosmological simulations\nin which we have explored a range of galaxy formation models, we investigate\nhow the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable -\nstars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by the\ngravitational potential. We explore several measures of cluster centre: the\nminimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centre\nif the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centre\nof BCG; and the peak and centroid of X-ray luminosity. We find that the centre\nof BCG correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potential\nthan the X-ray defined centres, while AGN feedback acts to significantly\nenhance the offset between the peak X-ray luminosity and minimum gravitational\npotential. These results highlight the importance of centre identification when\ninterpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoretical\npredictions and observational data.\n", "  We analyze two new sets of coagulation calculations for solid particles\norbiting within the terrestrial zone of a solar-type star. In models of\ncollisional cascades, numerical simulations demonstrate that the total mass,\nthe mass in 1 mm and smaller particles, and the dust luminosity decline with\ntime more rapidly than predicted by analytic models, $\\propto t^{-n}$ with $n\n\\approx$ 1.1-1.2 instead of 1. Size distributions derived from the numerical\ncalculations follow analytic predictions at radii less than 0.1 km but are\nshallower than predicted at larger sizes. In simulations of planet formation,\nthe dust luminosity declines more slowly than in pure collisional cascades,\nwith $n \\approx$ 0.5-0.8 instead of 1.1-1.2. Throughout this decline, giant\nimpacts produce large, observable spikes in dust luminosity which last roughly\n0.01-0.1 Myr and recur every 1-10 Myr. If most solar-type stars have Earth mass\nplanets with $a \\lesssim$ 1-2 AU, observations of debris around 1-100 Myr stars\nallow interesting tests of theory. Current data preclude theories where\nterrestrial planets form out of 1000 km or larger planetesimals. Although the\nobserved frequency of debris disks among $\\gtrsim$ 30 Myr old stars agrees with\nour calculations, the observed frequency of warm debris among 5-20 Myr old\nstars is smaller than predicted.\n", "  The well-observed acoustic halo is an enhancement in time-averaged Doppler\nvelocity and intensity power with respect to quiet-sun values which is\nprominent for weak and highly inclined field around the penumbra of sunspots\nand active regions. We perform 3D linear wave modelling with realistic\ndistributed acoustic sources in a MHS sunspot atmosphere and compare the\nresultant simulation enhancements with multi-height SDO observations of the\nphenomenon. We find that simulated halos are in good qualitative agreement with\nobservations. We also provide further proof that the underlying process\nresponsible for the halo is the refraction and return of fast magnetic waves\nwhich have undergone mode conversion at the critical $a=c$ atmospheric layer.\nIn addition, we also find strong evidence that fast-Alfv\\'en mode conversion\nplays a significant role in the structure of the halo, taking energy away from\nphotospheric and chromospheric heights in the form of field-aligned Alfv\\'en\nwaves. This conversion process may explain the observed \"dual-ring\" halo\nstructure at higher ($> 8 $ mHz) frequencies.\n", "  The optical radiation and polarization signatures in blazars are known to be\nhighly variable during flaring activities. It is frequently argued that shocks\nare the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability\nmodelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent\nmagnetic field evolution modeling, thus so far the associated optical\npolarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first\nsimultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures\nbased on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the\nblazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By\ncomparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly\nmagnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical\npolarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations. Hence an\nemission region with relatively strong magnetization is preferred. In such an\nenvironment, slow shocks may produce minor flares with either erratic\npolarization fluctuations or considerable polarization variations, depending on\nthe parameters; fast shocks can produce major flares with smooth PA rotations.\nIn addition, the magnetic fields in both cases are observed to actively revert\nto the original topology after the shocks. All these features are consistent\nwith observations. Future observations of the radiation and polarization\nsignatures will further constrain the flaring mechanism and the blazar emission\nenvironment.\n", "  We studied temporal changes of morphological and magnetic properties of a\nsuccession of four confined flares followed by an eruptive flare using the\nhigh-resolution New Solar Telescope (NST) operating at the Big Bear Solar\nObservatory (BBSO), Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms and\nAtmospheric Image Assembly (AIA) EUV images provided by Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). From the NST/Halpha and the SDO/AIA~304 A observations we\nfound that each flare developed a jet structure that evolved in a manner\nsimilar to evolution of the blowout jet : 1) an inverted-Y shape jet appeared\nand drifted away from its initial position; 2) jets formed a curtain-like\nstructure that consisted of many fine threads accompanied with subsequent\nbrightenings near the footpoints of the fine threads; and finally 3) the jet\nshowed a twisted structure visible near the flare maximum. Analysis of the HMI\ndata showed that both the negative magnetic flux and the magnetic helicity have\nbeen gradually increasing in the positive polarity region indicating the\ncontinuous injection of magnetic twist before and during the series of flares.\nBased on these results, we suggest that the continuous emergence of twisted\nmagnetic flux played an important role in producing a successive flares and\ndeveloping a series of blowout jets.\n", "  We investigated the effect of an external magnetic field on the diffusive\nspin transport by magnons in the magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG),\nusing a non-local magnon transport measurement geometry. We observed a decrease\nin magnon spin diffusion length $\\lambda_m$ for increasing field strengths,\nwhere $\\lambda_m$ is reduced from 9.6$\\pm1.2$ $\\mu$m at 10 mT to 4.2$\\pm0.6$\n$\\mu$m at 3.5 T at room temperature. In addition, we find that there must be at\nleast one additional transport parameter that depends on the external magnetic\nfield. Our results do not allow us to unambiguously determine whether this is\nthe magnon equilibrium density or the magnon diffusion constant. These results\nare significant for experiments in the more conventional longitudinal spin\nSeebeck geometry, since the magnon spin diffusion length sets the length scale\nfor the spin Seebeck effect as well and is relevant for its understanding.\n", "  This paper reports a new optical observation of 17P/Holmes one orbital period\nafter the historical outburst event in 2007. We detected not only a common dust\ntail near the nucleus, but also a long narrow structure that extended along the\nposition angle 274.6+/- 0.1 degree beyond the field of view of the Kiso Wide\nField Camera, i.e., >0.2 degree eastward and >2.0 degree westward from the\nnuclear position. The width of the structure decreased westward with increasing\ndistance from the nucleus. We obtained the total cross section of the long\nextended structure in the field of view, C= (2.3 +/- 0.5)x10^10 m^2. From the\nposition angle, morphology and the mass, we concluded that the long narrow\nstructure consists of materials ejected during the 2007 outburst. On the basis\nof the dynamical behavior of dust grains in the solar radiation field, we\nestimated that the long narrow structure would be composed of 1 mm-1 cm grains\nhaving an ejection velocity of >50 m/s. The velocity was more than one order of\nmagnitude faster than that of millimeter - centimeter grains from typical\ncomets around a heliocentric distance rh of 2.5 AU. We considered that sudden\nsublimation of a large amount of water ice (about 10^30 mol/s) would be\nresponsible for the high ejection velocity. We finally estimated a total mass\nof M=(4-8)x10^11 kg and a total kinetic energy of E=(1-6)x10^15 J for the 2007\noutburst ejecta, which are consistent with those of previous studies that\nconducted soon after the outburst.\n", "  We investigate the topological properties of the $SU(3)$ pure gauge theory by\nperforming numerical simulations at imaginary values of the $\\theta$ parameter.\nBy monitoring the dependence of various cumulants of the topological charge\ndistribution on the imaginary part of $\\theta$ and exploiting analytic\ncontinuation, we determine the free energy density up to the sixth order order\nin $\\theta$, $f(\\theta,T) = f(0,T) + {1\\over 2} \\chi(T) \\theta^2 (1 + b_2(T)\n\\theta^2 + b_4(T) \\theta^4 + O(\\theta^6))$. That permits us to achieve\ndeterminations with improved accuracy, in particular for the higher order\nterms, with control over the continuum and the infinite volume extrapolations.\nWe obtain $b_2=-0.0216(15)$ and $|b_4|\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{-4}$.\n", "  The next generation of space-based telescopes used for weak lensing surveys\nwill require exquisite point spread function (PSF) determination. Previously\nnegligible effects may become important in the reconstruction of the PSF, in\npart because of the improved spatial resolution. In this paper, we show that\nunresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the PSF\nand that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in the\nreconstruction process. We estimate the error in the reconstruction of the PSF\ndue to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with image\nsimulations for different PSFs and stellar populations. The simulations support\nour analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of\nthe multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the\nPSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the\ncomplex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple\nstars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity. Using image simulations, we\nalso show that the predicted error in the PSF shape is a theoretical limit that\ncan be reached only if large number of stars (up to thousands) are used\ntogether to build the PSF at any desired spatial position. For a lower number\nof stars, the PSF reconstruction is worse. Finally, we compute the effect of\nbinarity for different stellar magnitudes and show that bright stars alter the\nPSF size and ellipticity more than faint stars. This may affect the design of\nPSF calibration strategies and the choice of the related calibration fields.\n", "  We present hydrodynamic simulations of stellar wind-magnetosphere\ninteractions in hot Jupiters such as WASP-12b. For fiducial stellar wind rates\nwe find that a planetary magnetic field of a few G produces a large\nmagnetospheric cavity, which is typically 6-9 planetary radii in size. A bow\nshock invariably forms ahead of the magnetosphere, but the pre-shock gas is\nonly mildly supersonic (with typical Mach numbers of $\\simeq$1.6-1.8) so the\nshock is weak. This results in a characteristic signature in the ultraviolet\nlight curve: a broad absorption feature that leads the optical transit by\n10-20% in orbital phase. The shapes of our synthetic light-curves are\nconsistent with existing observations of WASP-12b, but the required near-UV\noptical depth ($\\tau \\sim 0.1$) can only be achieved if the shocked gas cools\nrapidly. We further show that radiative cooling is inefficient, so we deem it\nunlikely that a magnetospheric bow shock is responsible for the observed\nnear-UV absorption. Finally, we apply our model to two other well-studied hot\nJupiters (WASP-18b and HD209458b), and suggest that UV observations of more\nmassive short-period planets (such as WASP-18b) will provide a straightforward\ntest to distinguish between different models of circumplanetary absorption.\n", "  We present the detection of two H2C3O isomers, propynal and cyclopropenone,\ntoward various starless cores and molecular clouds, together with upper limits\nfor the third isomer propadienone. We review the processes controlling the\nabundances of H2C3O isomers in interstellar media showing that the reactions\ninvolved are gas-phase ones. We show that the abundances of these species are\ncontrolled by kinetic rather than thermodynamic effects.\n", "  One of the proposed explanations for the broad, double-peaked Balmer emission\nlines observed in the spectra of some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is that\nthey are associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries.\nHere, we test the binary broad-line region hypothesis through several decades\nof monitoring of the velocity structure of double-peaked H-alpha emission lines\nin 13 low-redshift, mostly radio-loud AGNs. This is a much larger set of\nobjects compared to an earlier test by Eracleous et al. (1997) and we use much\nlonger time series for the three objects studied in that paper. Although\nsystematic changes in radial velocity can be traced in many of their lines,\nthey are demonstrably not like those of a spectroscopic binary in a circular\norbit. Any spectroscopic binary period must therefore be much longer than the\nspan of the monitoring (assuming a circular orbit), which in turn would require\nblack hole masses that exceed by 1-2 orders of magnitude the values obtained\nfor these objects using techniques such as reverberation mapping and stellar\nvelocity dispersion. Moreover, the response of the double-peaked Balmer line\nprofiles to fluctuations of the ionizing continuum and the shape of the\nLy-alpha profiles are incompatible with a SMBH binary. The binary broad-line\nregion hypothesis is therefore disfavored. Other processes evidently shape\nthese line profiles and cause the long-term velocity variations of the double\npeaks.\n", "  We discuss the design and measured performance of a titanium nitride (TiN)\nmesh absorber we are developing for controlling optical crosstalk in\nhorn-coupled lumped-element kinetic inductance detector arrays for\nmillimeter-wavelengths. This absorber was added to the fused silica\nanti-reflection coating attached to previously-characterized, 20-element\nprototype arrays of LEKIDs fabricated from thin-film aluminum on silicon\nsubstrates. To test the TiN crosstalk absorber, we compared the measured\nresponse and noise properties of LEKID arrays with and without the TiN mesh.\nFor this test, the LEKIDs were illuminated with an adjustable, incoherent\nelectronic millimeter-wave source. Our measurements show that the optical\ncrosstalk in the LEKID array with the TiN absorber is reduced by 66\\% on\naverage, so the approach is effective and a viable candidate for future\nkilo-pixel arrays.\n", "  The low frequency quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed\nduring hard states of black hole binaries. Several studies have established\nvarious observational/empirical correlations between spectral parameters and\nQPO properties, indicating a close link between the two. However, the exact\nmechanism of generation of QPO is not yet well understood. In this paper, we\npresent our attempts to comprehend the connection between the spectral\ncomponents and the low frequency QPO observed in GRS 1915+105 using the data\nfrom NuSTAR. Detailed spectral modeling as well as the presence of the low\nfrequency QPO and its energy dependence during this observation have been\nreported by Miller et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2015) respectively. We\ninvestigate the compatibility of the spectral model and energy dependence of\nthe QPO by simulating light curves in various energy bands for small variation\nof the spectral parameters. The basic concept here is to establish connection,\nif any, between the QPO and the variation of either a spectral component or a\nspecific parameter, which in turn can shed some light on the origin of the QPO.\nWe begin with the best fit spectral model of Miller et al. (2013) and simulate\nthe light curve by varying the spectral parameter at frequencies close to the\nobserved QPO frequency in order to generate the simulated QPO. Further we\nsimulate similar light curves in various energy bands in order to reproduce the\nobserved energy dependence of RMS amplitude of the QPO. We find that the\nobserved trend of increasing RMS amplitude with energy can be reproduced\nqualitatively if the spectral index is assumed to be varying with the phases of\nthe QPO. Variation of any other spectral parameter does not reproduce the\nobserved energy dependence.\n", "  We present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the high Galactic\nlatitude (b=+50 deg) black hole X-ray binary (XRB) J1357.2-0933 in quiescence.\nOur broadband spectrum includes strictly simultaneous radio and X-ray\nobservations, and near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet data taken 1-2 days\nlater. We detect Swift J1357.2-0933 at all wavebands except for the radio\n(f_5GHz < 3.9 uJy/beam). Given current constraints on the distance (2.3-6.3\nkpc), its 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux corresponds to an Eddington ratio Lx/Ledd =\n4e-9 -- 3e-8 (assuming a black hole mass of 10 Msun). The broadband spectrum is\ndominated by synchrotron radiation from a relativistic population of outflowing\nthermal electrons, which we argue to be a common signature of short-period\nquiescent BHXBs. Furthermore, we identify the frequency where the synchrotron\nradiation transitions from optically thick-to-thin (approximately 2-5e14 Hz,\nwhich is the most robust determination of a 'jet break' for a quiescent BHXB to\ndate. Our interpretation relies on the presence of steep curvature in the\nultraviolet spectrum, a frequency window made observable by the low amount of\ninterstellar absorption along the line of sight. High Galactic latitude systems\nlike Swift J1357.2-0933 with clean ultraviolet sightlines are crucial for\nunderstanding black hole accretion at low luminosities.\n", "  We present a new morphological indicator designed for automated recognition\nof galaxies with faint asymmetric tidal features suggestive of an ongoing or\npast merger. We use this new indicator, together with preexisting diagnostics\nof galaxy structure to study the role of galaxy mergers in inducing\n(post-)starburst spectral signatures in local galaxies, and investigate whether\n(post-)starburst galaxies play a role in the build up of the `red sequence'.\nOur morphological and structural analysis of an evolutionary sample of 335\n(post-)starburst galaxies in the SDSS DR7 with starburst ages 0<tSB<0.6 Gyr,\nshows that 45% of galaxies with young starbursts (tSB<0.1 Gyr) show signatures\nof an ongoing or past merger. This fraction declines with starburst age, and we\nfind a good agreement between automated and visual classifications. The\nmajority of the oldest (post-)starburst galaxies in our sample (tSB~0.6Gyr)\nhave structural properties characteristic of early-type disks and are not as\nhighly concentrated as the fully quenched galaxies commonly found on the `red\nsequence' in the present day Universe. This suggests that, if (post-)starburst\ngalaxies are a transition phase between active star-formation and quiescence,\nthey do not attain the structure of presently quenched galaxies within the\nfirst 0.6 Gyr after the starburst.\n", "  TianQin is a proposal for a space-borne detector of gravitational waves in\nthe millihertz frequencies. The experiment relies on a constellation of three\ndrag-free spacecraft orbiting the Earth. Inter-spacecraft laser interferometry\nis used to monitor the distances between the test masses. The experiment is\ndesigned to be capable of detecting a signal with high confidence from a single\nsource of gravitational waves within a few months of observing time. We\ndescribe the preliminary mission concept for TianQin, including the candidate\nsource and experimental designs. We present estimates for the major\nconstituents of the experiment's error budget and discuss the project's overall\nfeasibility. Given the current level of technology readiness, we expect TianQin\nto be flown in the second half of the next decade.\n", "  We determine the evolution of a giant planet-disk system that orbits a member\nof a binary star system and is mildly inclined with respect to the binary\norbital plane. The planet orbit and disk are initially mutually coplanar. We\nanalyze the evolution of the planet and the disk by analytic means and\nhydrodynamic simulations. We generally find that the planet and the disk do not\nremain coplanar unless the disk mass is very large or the gap that separates\nthe planet from the disk is very small. The relative planet-disk tilt undergoes\nsecular oscillations whose initial amplitudes are typically of order the\ninitial disk tilt relative to the binary orbital plane for disk masses ~1% of\nthe binary mass or less. The effects of a secular resonance and the disk tilt\ndecay enhance the planet-disk misalignment. The secular resonance plays an\nimportant role for disk masses greater than the planet mass. At later times,\nthe accretion of disk gas by the planet causes its orbit to evolve towards\nalignment, if the disk mass is sufficiently large. The results have several\nimplications for the evolution of massive planets in binary systems.\n", "  We present the first images of four debris disks observed in scattered light\naround the young (4--250 Myr old) M dwarfs TWA 7 and TWA 25, the K6 star HD\n35650, and the G2 star HD 377. We obtained these images by reprocessing\narchival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS coronagraph data with modern\npost-processing techniques as part of the Archival Legacy Investigation of\nCircumstellar Environments (ALICE) program. All four disks appear faint and\ncompact compared with other debris disks resolved in scattered light. The disks\naround TWA 25, HD 35650, and HD 377 appear very inclined, while TWA 7's disk is\nviewed nearly face-on. The surface brightness of HD 35650's disk is strongly\nasymmetric. These new detections raise the number of disks resolved in\nscattered light around M and late-K stars from one (the AU Mic system) to four.\nThis new sample of resolved disks enables comparative studies of heretofore\nscarce debris disks around low-mass stars relative to solar-type stars.\n", "  The location of dark-matter free, tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) in the baryonic\nTully Fisher (bTF) diagram has been used to test cosmological scenarios,\nleading to various and controversial results. Using new high-resolution 3D\nspectroscopic data, we re-investigate the morpho-kinematics of these galaxies\nto verify whether or not they can be used for such a purpose. We find that the\nthree observed TDGs are kinematically not virialized and show complex\nmorphologies and kinematics, leading to considerable uncertainties about their\nintrinsic rotation velocities and their locations on the bTF. Only one TDG can\nbe identify as a (perturbed) rotation disk that it is indeed a sub-component of\nNGC5291N and that lies at $<$1$\\sigma$ from the local bTF relation. It results\nthat the presently studied TDGs are young, dynamically forming objects, which\nare not enough virialized to robustly challenge cosmological scenarios.\n", "  We have monitored the BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714 simultaneously in the B,\nR and I bands on three nights in November 2014. The average time resolution is\nquite high (73s, 34s, 58s for the filters B, R and I), which can help us trace\nthe profile of the variation and search for the short inter-band time delay.\nIntra-day variability was about 0.1 mag on the first two nights and more than\n0.3 mag on the third. A bluer-when-brighter color behavior was found. An clear\nloop path can be seen on the color-magnitude diagram of the third night,\nrevealing possible time delays between variations at high and low energies. It\nis the first time that the intra-day spectral hysteresis loop has been found so\nobviously in the optical band. We used the interpolated cross-correlation\nfunction method to further confirm the time delay and calculated the values of\nlag between light curves at different wavelengths on each night. On the third\nnight, variations in the R and B bands is approximately 1.5 minutes lagging\nbehind the I band. Such optical time delay is probably due to the interplay of\ndifferent processes of electrons in the jet of the blazar.\n", "  Tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in the\nlinear stage of structure formation. Such a theory predicts alignments between\nthe spin of haloes and tidal shear field. However, non-linear evolution and\nangular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. In this\npaper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiar\nvelocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $115\\,\n\\mathrm{Mpc} $ ($\\sim8000 \\, {\\mathrm {km}}{\\mathrm s}^{-1}$) from 2MRS\ncatalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes of\nshear field. Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at\nsimilar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments with\nvelocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2MRS sample, show a statistically\nsignificant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. In\ngeneral, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of\ngreatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.\nSpiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened\nwhen considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field\nreconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis\nof greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result\nindicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly\nnoisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strong\nenough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -\nespecially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.\n", "  We present a dynamical measurement of the tangential motion of the Andromeda\nsystem, the ensemble consisting of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and its\nsatellites. The system is modelled as a structure with cosmologically-motivated\nvelocity dispersion and density profiles, and we show that our method works\nwell when tested using the most massive substructures in high-resolution Lambda\nCold Dark Matter simulations. Applied to the sample of 40 currently-known\ngalaxies of this system, we find a value for the transverse velocity of 164.4\n+/- 61.8 km/s (v_East = -111.5 +/- 70.2 km/s and v_North = 99.4 +/- 60.0 km/s),\nsignificantly higher than previous estimates of the proper motion of M31\nitself. This result has significant implications on estimates of the mass of\nthe Local Group, as well as on its past and future history.\n", "  We present a multiple scattering vector radiative transfer model which\nproduces disk integrated, full phase polarized light curves for reflected light\nfrom an exoplanetary atmosphere. We validate our model against results from\npublished analytical and computational models and discuss a small number of\ncases relevant to the existing and possible near-future observations of the\nexoplanet HD 189733b. HD 189733b is arguably the most well observed exoplanet\nto date and the only exoplanet to be observed in polarized light, yet it is\ndebated if the planet's atmosphere is cloudy or clear. We model reflected light\nfrom clear atmospheres with Rayleigh scattering, and cloudy or hazy atmospheres\nwith Mie and fractal aggregate particles. We show that clear and cloudy\natmospheres have large differences in polarized light as compared to simple\nflux measurements, though existing observations are insufficient to make this\ndistinction. Futhermore, we show that atmospheres that are spatially\ninhomogeneous, such as being partially covered by clouds or hazes, exhibit\nlarger contrasts in polarized light when compared to clear atmospheres. This\neffect can potentially be used to identify patchy clouds in exoplanets. Given a\nset of full phase polarimetric measurements, this model can constrain the\ngeometric albedo, properties of scattering particles in the atmosphere and the\nlongitude of the ascending node of the orbit. The model is used to interpret\nnew polarimetric observations of HD 189733b in a companion paper.\n", "  Narrow band bursts appear on dynamic spectra from microwave to decametric\nfrequencies as fine structures with very small duration and bandwidth. They are\nthought to mark small scale magnetic reconnection. We analyzed 27 metric\ntype-IV events with narrow band bursts observed by the ARTEMIS-IV\nradiospectrograph in 30/6/1999-1/8/2010. We examined the morphological\ncharacteristics of isolated narrow-band bursts and groups or chains of spikes.\nThe events were recorded with the SAO (10 ms cadence) receiver of ARTEMIS-IV in\nthe 270-450 MHz range. We measured the duration, spectral width, and frequency\ndrift of ~12000 individual narrow-band bursts, groups, and chains. Spike\nsources were imaged with the NRH for the event of 21 April 2003. The mean\nduration of individual bursts at fixed frequency was ~100 ms, while the\ninstantaneous relative bandwidth was ~2%. Some bursts had measurable frequency\ndrift, positive or negative. Often spikes appeared in chains, which were\nclosely spaced in time (column chains) or in frequency (row chains). Column\nchains had frequency drifts similar to IIId-bursts; most of the row chains\nexhibited negative drifts similar to fiber bursts. From the NRH data, we found\nthat spikes were superimposed on a larger, slowly varying, background\ncomponent. They were polarized in the same sense as the background source, with\na slightly higher degree of polarization of ~65%, and their size was ~60% of\ntheir size in total intensity. The duration and bandwidth distributions did not\nshow any clear separation in groups. Some chains tended to assume the form of\nzebra, lace stripes, fibers, or bursts of the type-III family, suggesting that\nsuch bursts might be resolved in spikes when viewed with high resolution. The\nNRH data indicate that the spikes are not fluctuations of the background, but\nrepresent additional emission such as what would be expected from small-scale\nreconnection.\n", "  Turbulence acting on mixes of gas and particles generally evenly diffuses the\nlatter through the former. However, in the presence of background gas\ntemperature gradients a phenomenon known as turbulent thermal diffusion appears\nas a particle drift velocity (rather than a diffusive term). This process moves\nparticles from hot regions to cold ones. We rederive turbulent thermal\ndiffusion using astrophysical language and demonstrate that it could play a\nmajor role in protoplanetary discs by concentrating particles by factors of\ntens. Such a concentration would set the stage for collective behavior such as\nthe streaming instability and hence planetesimal formation.\n", "  Aims: We aim to determine the effect of converging flows on the evolution of\na bipolar magnetic region (BMR), and to investigate the role of these inflows\nin the generation of poloidal flux. We also discuss whether the flux dispersal\ndue to turbulent flows can be described as a diffusion process.\n  Methods: We developed a simple surface flux transport model based on\npoint-like magnetic concentrations. We tracked the tilt angle, the magnetic\nflux and the axial dipole moment of a BMR in simulations with and without\ninflows and compared the results. To test the diffusion approximation,\nsimulations of random walk dispersal of magnetic features were compared against\nthe predictions of the diffusion treatment.\n  Results: We confirm the validity of the diffusion approximation to describe\nflux dispersal on large scales. We find that the inflows enhance flux\ncancellation, but at the same time affect the latitudinal separation of the\npolarities of the bipolar region. In most cases the latitudinal separation is\nlimited by the inflows, resulting in a reduction of the axial dipole moment of\nthe BMR. However, when the initial tilt angle of the BMR is small, the inflows\nproduce an increase in latitudinal separation that leads to an increase in the\naxial dipole moment in spite of the enhanced flux destruction. This can give\nrise to a tilt of the BMR even when the BMR was originally aligned parallel to\nthe equator.\n", "  Recent network research has focused on the cascading failures in a system of\ninterdependent networks and the necessary preconditions for system collapse. An\nimportant question that has not been addressed is how to repair a failing\nsystem before it suffers total breakdown. Here we introduce a recovery strategy\nof nodes and develop an analytic and numerical framework for studying the\nconcurrent failure and recovery of a system of interdependent networks based on\nan efficient and practically reasonable strategy. Our strategy consists of\nrepairing a fraction of failed nodes, with probability of recovery $\\gamma$,\nthat are neighbors of the largest connected component of each constituent\nnetwork. We find that, for a given initial failure of a fraction $1-p$ of\nnodes, there is a critical probability of recovery above which the cascade is\nhalted and the system fully restores to its initial state and below which the\nsystem abruptly collapses. As a consequence we find in the plane $\\gamma-p$ of\nthe phase diagram three distinct phases. A phase in which the system never\ncollapses without being restored, another phase in which the recovery strategy\navoids the breakdown, and a phase in which even the repairing process cannot\navoid the system collapse.\n", "  We report on a timing analysis of a new ~630ks XMM-Newton observation of the\nquasar, PG 1211+143. We find a well-defined X-ray power spectrum with a\nwell-detected bend at ~7e-5 Hz, consistent with the established\nbend-timescale--black-hole-mass correlation for luminous, accreting black\nholes. We find the linear rms-flux relation commonly observed in accreting\nblack hole systems and investigate the energy-dependence of the rms. The\nfractional rms is roughly constant with energy on short timescales (< 1 day;\nwithin observations) whereas there is enhanced soft band variability on long\ntimescales (between observations typically spaced by a few days). Additionally,\nwe also report on the optical--UV variability using the OM on-board XMM-Newton\nand a ~2-month-long overlapping monitoring programme with Swift. We find that,\nalthough there is little UV variability within observations (<1 day), UV\nvariations of a few per cent exist on time-scales of ~days--weeks.\n", "  The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are\nimportant diagnostics of both accretion disk physics and their contribution to\nthe metagalactic ionizing UV background. Though the mean AGN spectrum is well\ncharacterized with composite spectra at wavelengths greater than 912 Angstroms,\nthe shorter-wavelength extreme-UV (EUV) remains poorly studied. In this third\npaper in a series on the spectra of AGNs, we combine 11 new spectra taken with\nthe Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope with archival\nspectra to characterize the typical EUV spectral slope of AGNs from\n$\\lambda_{\\rm rest}\\sim 850~{\\rm Angstroms}$ down to $\\lambda_{\\rm rest}\\sim\n425~{\\rm Angstroms}$. Parameterizing this slope as a power law, we obtain\n$F_\\nu\\propto \\nu^{ -0.72\\pm 0.26}$, but we also discuss the limitations and\nsystematic uncertainties of this model. We identify broad emission features in\nthis spectral region, including emission due to ions of O, Ne, Mg, and other\nspecies, and we limit the intrinsic HeI 504 Angstrom photoelectric absorption\nedge opacity to $\\tau_{\\rm HeI}<0.047$.\n", "  In general relativity, the angular radius of the shadow of a black hole is\nprimarily determined by its mass-to-distance ratio and depends only weakly on\nits spin and inclination. If general relativity is violated, however, the\nshadow size may also depend strongly on parametric deviations from the Kerr\nmetric. Based on a reconstructed image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) from a\nsimulated one-day observing run of a seven-station Event Horizon Telescope\n(EHT) array, we employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to demonstrate that\nsuch an observation can measure the angular radius of the shadow of Sgr A* with\nan uncertainty of ~1.5 uas (6%). We show that existing mass and distance\nmeasurements can be improved significantly when combined with upcoming EHT\nmeasurements of the shadow size and that tight constraints on potential\ndeviations from the Kerr metric can be obtained.\n", "  The rapid assembly of the massive black holes that power the luminous quasars\nobserved at $z \\sim 6-7$ remains a puzzle. Various direct collapse models have\nbeen proposed to head-start black hole growth from initial seeds with masses\n$\\sim 10^5\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, which can then reach a billion solar mass while\naccreting at the Eddington limit. Here we propose an alternative scenario based\non radiatively inefficient super-critical accretion of stellar-mass holes\nembedded in the gaseous circum-nuclear discs (CNDs) expected to exist in the\ncores of high redshift galaxies. Our sub-pc resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations show that stellar-mass holes orbiting within the central 100 pc of\nthe CND bind to very high density gas clumps that arise from the fragmentation\nof the surrounding gas. Owing to the large reservoir of dense cold gas\navailable, a stellar-mass black hole allowed to grow at super-Eddington rates\naccording to the \"slim disc\" solution can increase its mass by 3 orders of\nmagnitudes within a few million years. These findings are supported by\nsimulations run with two different hydro codes, RAMSES based on the Adaptive\nMesh Refinement technique and GIZMO based on a new Lagrangian Godunov-type\nmethod, and with similar, but not identical, sub-grid recipes for star\nformation, supernova feedback, black hole accretion and feedback. The low\nradiative efficiency of super-critical accretion flows are instrumental to the\nrapid mass growth of our black holes, as they imply modest radiative heating of\nthe surrounding nuclear environment.\n", "  We explore the chemical distribution of stars in a simulated galaxy. Using\nsimulations of the same initial conditions but with two different feedback\nschemes (MUGS and MaGICC), we examine the features of the age-metallicity\nrelation (AMR), and the three-dimensional age-metallicity-[O/Fe] distribution,\nboth for the galaxy as a whole and decomposed into disc, bulge, halo, and\nsatellites. The MUGS simulation, which uses traditional supernova feedback, is\nreplete with chemical substructure. This sub- structure is absent from the\nMaGICC simulation, which includes early feedback from stellar winds, a modified\nIMF and more efficient feedback. The reduced amount of substructure is due to\nthe almost complete lack of satellites in MaGICC. We identify a significant\nseparation between the bulge and disc AMRs, where the bulge is considerably\nmore metal-rich with a smaller spread in metallicity at any given time than the\ndisc. Our results suggest, however, that identifying the substructure in\nobservations will require exquisite age resolution, on the order of 0.25 Gyr.\nCertain satellites show exotic features in the AMR, even forming a 'sawtooth'\nshape of increasing metallicity followed by sharp declines which correspond to\npericentric passages. This fact, along with the large spread in stellar age at\na given metallicity, compromises the use of metallicity as an age indicator,\nalthough alpha abundance provides a more robust clock at early times. This may\nalso impact algorithms that are used to reconstruct star formation histories\nfrom resolved stellar populations, which frequently assume a\nmonotonically-increasing AMR.\n", "  The Fermi surface depletion of beta-stable nuclear matter is calculated to\nstudy its effects on several physical properties which determine the neutron\nstar thermal evolution. The neutron and proton Z factors measuring the\ncorresponding Fermi surface depletions, are calculated within the\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock approach employing the AV18 two-body force supplemented\nby a microscopic three body force. Neutrino emissivity, heat capacity and, in\nparticular, neutron 3PF2 superfluidity turn out to be reduced, especially at\nhigh baryonic density, to such an extent that the cooling rates of young\nneutron stars are significantly slowed\n", "  The amount of deuterium locked up in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nhas to date been an uncertain value. We present a near-infrared (NIR)\nspectroscopic survey of HII regions in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC), and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) obtained with AKARI, which aims to\nsearch for features indicative of deuterated PAHs (PAD or Dn-PAH) to better\nconstrain the D/H ratio of PAHs. Fifty-three HII regions were observed in the\nNIR (2.5-5 {\\mu}m), using the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board the AKARI\nsatellite. Through comparison of the observed spectra with a theoretical model\nof deuterated PAH vibrational modes, the aromatic and (a)symmetric aliphatic\nC-D stretch modes were identified. We see emission features between 4.4-4.8\n{\\mu}m, which could be unambiguously attributed to deuterated PAHs in only six\nof the observed sources, all of which are located in the Milky Way. In all\ncases, the aromatic C-D stretching feature is weaker than the aliphatic C-D\nstretching feature, and, in the case of M17b, this feature is not observed at\nall. Based on the weak or absent PAD features in most of the observed spectra,\nit is suggested that the mechanism for PAH deuteration in the ISM is uncommon.\n", "  We include a general form for the scattering mean free path in a nonlinear\nMonte Carlo model of relativistic shock formation and Fermi acceleration.\nParticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, as well as analytic work, suggest that\nrelativistic shocks tend to produce short-scale, self-generated magnetic\nturbulence that leads to a scattering mean free path (mfp) with a stronger\nmomentum dependence than the mfp ~ p dependence for Bohm diffusion. In\nunmagnetized shocks, this turbulence is strong enough to dominate the\nbackground magnetic field so the shock can be treated as parallel regardless of\nthe initial magnetic field orientation, making application to gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), pulsar winds, Type Ibc supernovae, and extra-galactic radio sources\nmore straightforward and realistic. In addition to changing the scale of the\nshock precursor, we show that, when nonlinear effects from efficient Fermi\nacceleration are taken into account, the momentum dependence of the mfp has an\nimportant influence on the efficiency of cosmic-ray production as well as the\naccelerated particle spectral shape. These effects are absent in\nnonrelativistic shocks and do not appear in relativistic shock models unless\nnonlinear effects are self-consistently described. We show, for limited\nexamples, how the changes in Fermi acceleration translate to changes in the\nintensity and spectral shape of gamma-ray emission from proton-proton\ninteractions and pion-decay radiation.\n", "  High-energy observations of the Sun provide an opportunity to test the limits\nof our ability to accurately measure properties of transiting exoplanets in the\npresence of stellar activity. Here we insert transits of a hot Jupiter into\ncontinuous disk integrated data of the Sun in Lyman-alpha (Ly$\\alpha$) from\nNASA's SDO/EVE instrument to assess the impact of stellar activity on the\nmeasured planet-to-star radius ratio\n$(\\textrm{R}_\\textrm{p}/\\textrm{R}_\\star)$. In 75% of our simulated light\ncurves we measure the correct radius ratio; however, incorrect values can be\nmeasured if there is significant short term variability in the light curve. The\nmaximum measured value of $(\\textrm{R}_\\textrm{p}/\\textrm{R}_\\star)$ is $50\\%$\nlarger than the input value, which is much smaller than the large Ly$\\alpha$\ntransit depths that have been reported in the literature, suggesting that for\nstars with activity levels comparable to the Sun, stellar activity alone cannot\naccount for these deep transits. We ran simulations without a transit and found\nthat stellar activity cannot mimic the Ly$\\alpha$ transit of 55 Cancari b,\nstrengthening the conclusion that this planet has a partially transiting\nexopshere. We were able to compare our simulations to more active stars by\nartificially increasing the variability in the Solar Ly$\\alpha$ light curve. In\nthe higher variability data, the largest value of\n$(\\textrm{R}_\\textrm{p}/\\textrm{R}_\\star)$ we measured is < 3x the input value\nwhich again is not large enough to reproduce the Ly$\\alpha$ transit depth\nreported for the more active stars HD 189733 and GJ 436, supporting the\ninterpretation that these planets have extended atmospheres and possible\ncometary tails.\n", "  LS I +61 303 is a gamma-ray binary that exhibits an outburst at GHz\nfrequencies each orbital cycle of $\\approx$ 26.5 d and a superorbital\nmodulation with a period of $\\approx$ 4.6 yr. We have performed a detailed\nstudy of the low-frequency radio emission of LS I +61 303 by analysing all the\narchival GMRT data at 150, 235 and 610 MHz, and conducting regular LOFAR\nobservations within the Radio Sky Monitor (RSM) at 150 MHz. We have detected\nthe source for the first time at 150 MHz, which is also the first detection of\na gamma-ray binary at such a low frequency. We have obtained the light-curves\nof the source at 150, 235 and 610 MHz, all of them showing orbital modulation.\nThe light-curves at 235 and 610 MHz also show the existence of superorbital\nvariability. A comparison with contemporaneous 15-GHz data shows remarkable\ndifferences with these light-curves. At 15 GHz we see clear outbursts, whereas\nat low frequencies we see variability with wide maxima. The light-curve at 235\nMHz seems to be anticorrelated with the one at 610 MHz, implying a shift of\n$\\sim$ 0.5 orbital phases in the maxima. We model the shifts between the maxima\nat different frequencies as due to changes in the physical parameters of the\nemitting region assuming either free-free absorption or synchrotron\nself-absorption, obtaining expansion velocities for this region close to the\nstellar wind velocity with both mechanisms.\n", "  We compare the physical and morphological properties of z ~ 2 Lyman-alpha\nemitting galaxies (LAEs) identified in the HETDEX Pilot Survey and narrow band\nstudies with those of z ~ 2 optical emission line galaxies (oELGs) identified\nvia HST WFC3 infrared grism spectroscopy. Both sets of galaxies extend over the\nsame range in stellar mass (7.5 < logM < 10.5), size (0.5 < R < 3.0 kpc), and\nstar-formation rate (~1 < SFR < 100). Remarkably, a comparison of the most\ncommonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-light\nradius, UV slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance,\nstar formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [O III]\nluminosity, and [O III] equivalent width -- reveals no statistically\nsignificant differences between the populations. This suggests that the\nprocesses and conditions which regulate the escape of Ly-alpha from a z ~ 2\nstar-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. In particular, the lack\nof dependence on the UV slope suggests that Ly-alpha emission is not being\nsignificantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. We develop\na simple model of Ly-alpha emission that connects LAEs to all high-redshift\nstar forming galaxies where the escape of Ly-alpha depends on the sightline\nthrough the galaxy. Using this model, we find that mean solid angle for\nLy-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with those\ncalculated from other studies.\n", "  We explore the dynamics of magnetically controlled outflows from Hot\nJupiters, where these flows are driven by UV heating from the central star. In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet. The measured time variability can be used, in\nprinciple, to constrain the parameters of the system (e.g., the strengths of\nthe surface magnetic fields).\n", "  Long-lived stars in GCs exhibit chemical peculiarities with respect to their\nhalo counterparts. In particular, Na-enriched stars are identified as belonging\nto a 2d stellar population born from cluster material contaminated by the\nH-burning ashes of a 1st stellar population. Their presence and numbers in\ndifferent locations of the CMDs provide important constraints on the\nself-enrichment scenarios. In particular, the ratio of Na-poor to Na-rich stars\non the AGB has recently been found to vary strongly from cluster to cluster,\nwhile it is relatively constant on the RGB. We investigate the impact of both\nage and metallicity on the theoretical Na spread along the AGB within the\nframework of the fast rotating massive stars scenario for GC self-enrichment.\n(tb continued)\n", "  Globular clusters are the oldest stellar systems in the Milky Way and probe\nthe early epoch of the Galaxy formation. However, the uncertainties on their\nabsolute age are still too large to soundly constrain how the Galactic\nstructures have assembled. The aim of this work is to obtain an accurate\nestimate of the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 2808 using deep IR\ndata obtained with the multi conjugate adaptive optics system operating at the\nGemini South telescope (GeMS). This exquisite photometry, combined with that\nobtained in V and I bands with HST, allowed us the detection of the faint Main\nSequence Knee feature in NGC 2808 colour magnitude diagram. The difference\nbetween this point and the main sequence turn off is a good age estimator and\nprovides ages with unprecedented accuracy. We found that NGC 2808 has an age of\nt=10.9\\pm0.7 (intrinsic) \\pm0.45 (metallicity term) Gyr. A possible\ncontamination by He-enhanced population could make the cluster up to 0.25 Gyr\nolder. Although this age estimate agrees with the age coming from the classical\nturn off method (t=11.0 Gyr), its uncertainty is a factor ~3 better, since it\navoids systematics in reddening, distance assumptions and photometric zero\npoints determination. The final absolute age indicates that NGC 2808 is\nslightly younger than other Galactic globular clusters with similar\nmetallicity.\n", "  Variations of the emission lines in the spectrum of the yellow symbiotic star\nAG Dra have been studied for over 14 years (1997 - 2011), using more than 500\nspectra obtained on the 1.5-metre telescope at Tartu Observatory, Estonia. The\ntime interval covered includes the major (cool) outburst of AG Dra that started\nin 2006. Main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) cool and hot outbursts\nof AG Dra can be distinguished from the variations of optical emission lines;\n(ii) the Raman scattered emission line of O VI at $\\lambda\\,6825$ almost\ndisappeared during the cool outburst; (iii) lower excitation emission lines did\nnot change significantly during the cool outburst, but they vary in hot\noutbursts and also follow orbital motion; (iv) similarity of variations in AG\nDra to those in the prototypical symbiotic star Z And allows to suggest that a\n\"combination nova\" model proposed for the latter object might also be\nresponsible for the outburst behaviour of AG Dra.\n", "  We analyze the properties of the innermost narrow line region in a sample of\nlow-luminosity AGN. We select 33 LINERs (bona fide AGN) and Seyfert galaxies\nfrom the optical spectroscopic Palomar survey observed by HST/STIS. We find\nthat in LINERs the [NII] and [OI] lines are broader than the [SII] line and\nthat the [NII]/[SII] flux ratio increases when moving from ground-based to HST\nspectra. This effect is more pronounced considering the wings of the lines. Our\ninterpretation is that, as a result of superior HST spatial resolution, we\nisolate a compact region of dense ionized gas in LINERs, located at a typical\ndistance of about 3 pc and with a gas density of about 10$^4$-10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$,\nwhich we identify with the outer portion of the intermediate line region (ILR).\nInstead, we do not observe these kinds of effects in Seyferts; this may be the\nresult of a stronger dilution from the NLR emission, since the HST slit maps a\nlarger region in these sources. Alternatively, we argue that the innermost,\nhigher density component of the ILR is only present in Seyferts, while it is\ntruncated at larger radii because of the presence of the circumnuclear torus.\nThe ILR is only visible in its entirety in LINERs because the obscuring torus\nis not present in these sources.\n", "  We revisit the muon magnetic moment (g-2) in the context of Composite Higgs\nmodels and Technicolor, and provide general analytical expressions for\ncomputing the muon magnetic moment stemming from new fields such as, neutral\ngauge bosons, charged gauge bosons, neutral scalar, charged scalars, and exotic\ncharged leptons type of particles. Under general assumptions we assess which\nparticle content could address the $g-2_{\\mu}$ excess. Moreover, we take a\nconservative approach and derive stringent limits on the particle masses in\ncase the anomaly is otherwise resolved and comment on electroweak and collider\nbounds. Lastly, for concreteness we apply our results to a particular\nTechnicolor model.\n", "  Recent observations of asteroidal surfaces indicate the presence of materials\nthat do not match the bulk lithology of the body. A possible explanation for\nthe presence of these exogenous materials is that they are products of\ninter-asteroid impacts in the Main Belt, and thus interest has increased in\nunderstanding the fate of the projectile during hypervelocity impacts. In order\nto gain insight into the fate of impactor we have carried out a laboratory\nprogramme, covering the velocity range of 0.38 - 3.50 km/s, devoted to\nmeasuring the survivability, fragmentation and final state of the impactor.\nForsterite olivine and synthetic basalt projectiles were fired onto low\nporosity (<10%) pure water-ice targets using the University of Kent's Light Gas\nGun (LGG). We developed a novel method to identify impactor fragments which\nwere found in ejecta and implanted into the target. We applied astronomical\nphotometry techniques, using the SOURCE EXTRACTOR software, to automatically\nmeasure the dimensions of thousands of fragments. This procedure enabled us to\nestimate the implanted mass on the target body, which was found to be a few\npercent of the initial mass of the impactor. We calculated an order of\nmagnitude difference in the energy density of catastrophic disruption, Q*,\nbetween peridot and basalt projectiles. However, we found very similar\nbehaviour of the size frequency distributions for the hypervelocity shots (>1\nkm/s). After each shot, we examined the largest peridot fragments with Raman\nspectroscopy and no melt or alteration in the final state of the projectile was\nobserved.\n", "  We present the first results from our Keck program investigating the orbital\narchitectures of planet-hosting multiple star systems. Kepler-444 is a\nmetal-poor triple star system that hosts five sub-Earth-sized planets orbiting\nthe primary star (Kepler-444A), as well as a spatially unresolved pair of M\ndwarfs (Kepler-444BC) at a projected distance of 1.8\" (66 AU). We combine our\nKeck/NIRC2 adaptive optics astrometry with multi-epoch Keck/HIRES RVs of all\nthree stars to determine a precise orbit for the BC pair around A, given their\nempirically constrained masses. We measure minimal astrometric motion\n($1.0\\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, or $0.17\\pm0.10$ km s$^{-1}$), but our RVs reveal\nsignificant orbital velocity ($1.7\\pm0.2$ km s$^{-1}$) and acceleration\n($7.8\\pm0.5$ m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$). We determine a highly eccentric stellar\norbit ($e=0.864\\pm0.023$) that brings the tight M dwarf pair within\n$5.0^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ AU of the planetary system. We validate that the system is\ndynamically stable in its present configuration via n-body simulations. We find\nthat the A$-$BC orbit and planetary orbits are likely aligned (98%) given that\nthey both have edge-on orbits and misalignment induces precession of the\nplanets out of transit. We conclude that the stars were likely on their current\norbits during the epoch of planet formation, truncating the protoplanetary disk\nat $\\approx$2 AU. This truncated disk would have been severely depleted of\nsolid material from which to form the total $\\approx$1.5 $M_{\\rm Earth}$ of\nplanets. We thereby strongly constrain the efficiency of the conversion of dust\ninto planets and suggest that the Kepler-444 system is consistent with models\nthat explain the formation of more typical close-in Kepler planets in normal,\nnot truncated, disks.\n", "  We analyze Hubble Space Telescope observations of scattering regions in 20\nluminous obscured quasars at $0.24<z<0.65$ (11 new observations and 9 archival\nones) observed at rest-frame $\\sim 3000$\\AA. We find spectacular $5-10$\nkpc-scale scattering regions in almost all cases. The median scattering\nefficiency at this wavelength (the ratio of observed to estimated intrinsic\nflux) is 2.3\\%, and 73\\% of the observed flux at this wavelength is due to\nscattered light, which if unaccounted for may strongly bias estimates of quasar\nhosts' star formation rates. Modeling these regions as illuminated dusty cones,\nwe estimate the radial density distributions of the interstellar medium as well\nas the geometric properties of circumnuclear quasar obscuration -- inclinations\nand covering factors. Small derived opening angles (median half-angle and\nstandard deviation 27\\dg$\\pm$9\\dg) are inconsistent with a 1:1 type 1 / type 2\nratio. We suggest that quasar obscuration is patchy and that the observer has a\n$\\sim 40\\%$ chance of seeing a type 1 source even through the obscuration. We\nestimate median density profile of the scattering medium to be $n_{\\rm\nH}=0.04-0.5$ $(1{\\rm kpc}/r)^2$ cm$^{-3}$, depending on the method. Quasars in\nour sample likely exhibit galaxy-wide winds, but if these consist of optically\nthick clouds then only a small fraction of the wind mass ($\\la 10\\%$)\ncontributes to scattering.\n", "  The Outburst Catalogue contains a wide variety of observational properties\nfor 722 dwarf nova-type (DN) cataclysmic variables (CVs) and 309 CVs of other\ntypes from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey. In particular, it includes\nthe apparent outburst and quiescent V-band magnitudes, duty cycles, limits on\nthe recurrence time, upper- and lower-limits on the distance and absolute\nquiescent magnitudes, colour information, orbital parameters, and X-ray\ncounterparts. These properties were determined by means of a classification\nscript presented in this paper. The DN in the catalogue show a correlation\nbetween the outburst duty cycle and the orbital period (and outburst recurrence\ntime), as well as between the quiescent absolute magnitude and the orbital\nperiod (and duty cycle). This is the largest sample of dwarf nova properties\ncollected to date. Besides serving as a useful reference for individual systems\nand a means of selecting objects for targeted studies, it will prove valuable\nfor statistical studies that aim to shed light on the formation and evolution\nof cataclysmic variables.\n", "  Observations of the epoch of reionization give us clues about the nature and\nevolution of the sources of ionizing photons, or early stars and galaxies. We\npresent a new suite of structure formation and radiative transfer simulations\nfrom the PRACE4LOFAR project designed to investigate whether the mechanism of\nradiative feedback, or the suppression of star formation in ionized regions\nfrom UV radiation, can be inferred from these observations. Our source halo\nmass extends down to $10^8 M_\\odot$, with sources in the mass range $10^8$ to\n$10^9 M_\\odot$ expected to be particularly susceptible to feedback from\nionizing radiation, and we vary the aggressiveness and nature of this\nsuppression. Not only do we have four distinct source models, we also include\ntwo box sizes (67 Mpc and 349 Mpc), each with two grid resolutions. This suite\nof simulations allows us to investigate the robustness of our results. All of\nour simulations are broadly consistent with the observed electron-scattering\noptical depth of the cosmic microwave background and the neutral fraction and\nphotoionization rate of hydrogen at $z\\sim6$. In particular, we investigate the\nredshifted 21-cm emission in anticipation of upcoming radio interferometer\nobservations. We find that the overall shape of the 21-cm signal and various\nstatistics are robust to the exact nature of source suppression, the box size,\nand the resolution. There are some promising model discriminators in the\nnon-Gaussianity and small-scale power spectrum of the 21-cm signal.\n", "  Context. The S235AB star forming region houses a massive young stellar object\nwhich has recently been reported to exhibit possible evidence of jet rotation -\nan illusive yet crucial component of disk aided star formation theories.\n  Aims. To confirm the presence of a molecular counterpart to the jet and to\nfurther study the molecular environment in in S235AB. Methods. We search for\nvelocity wings in the line emission of thermal SiO (J=2-1, v=0), a tracer of\nshocked gas, which would indicate the presence of jet activity. Utilising other\nlines detected in our survey we use the relative intensities of intra species\ntransitions, isotopes and hyperfine transitions to derive opacities,\ntemperatures, column densities and abundances of various molecular species in\nS235AB.\n  Results. The SiO (J=2-1, v=0) emission exhibits velocity wing of up to 75\nkm/s above and below the velocity of the star, indicating the presence of a\njet. The molecular environment describes an evolutionary stage resemblant of a\nhot molecular core.\n", "  Water level measurements from 15 tide gauges in the coastal zone of\nBangladesh are analyzed in conjunction with cyclone tracks and wind speed data\nfor 54 cyclones between 1977 and 2010. Storm surge magnitude is inferred from\nresidual water levels computed by subtracting modeled astronomical tides from\nobserved water levels at each station. Observed residual water levels are\ngenerally smaller than reported storm surge levels for cyclones where both are\navailable, and many cyclones produce no obvious residual at all. Both maximum\nand minimum residual water levels are higher for west-landing cyclones\nproducing onshore winds and generally diminish for cyclones making landfall on\nthe Bangladesh coast or eastward producing offshore winds. Water levels\nobserved during cyclones are generally more strongly influenced by tidal phase\nand amplitude than by storm surge alone. In only 7 of the 15 stations does the\nhighest plausible observed water level coincide with a cyclone. While\ncyclone-coincident residual water level maxima occur at a wide range of tidal\nphases, very few coincide with high spring tides. Comparisons of\ncyclone-related casualties with maximum wind speed, hour of landfall,\npopulation density and residual water level (inferred storm surge) show no\nsignificant correlations for any single characteristic. Cyclones with high\ncasualties are often extreme in one or more of these characteristics but there\nappears to be no single extreme characteristic shared by all high casualty\ncyclones.\n", "  We present the results of zero-field muon-spin relaxation measurements made\non the double perovskite insulators Sr$_{2}B$OsO$_6$ ($B={\\rm Fe, Y, In}$).\nSpontaneous muon-spin precession indicative of quasistatic long range magnetic\nordering is observed in Sr$_{2}$FeOsO$_6$ within the AF1 antiferromagnetic\nphase for temperatures below $T_{\\rm N}=135 \\pm 2~{\\rm K}$. Upon cooling below\n$T_2 \\approx 67~{\\rm K}$ the oscillations cease to be resolvable owing to the\ncoexistence of the AF1 and AF2 phases, which leads to a broader range of\ninternal magnetic fields. Using density functional calculations we identify a\ncandidate muon stopping site within the unit cell, which dipole field\nsimulations show to be consistent with the proposed magnetic structure. The\npossibility of incommensurate magnetic ordering is discussed for temperatures\nbelow $T_{\\rm N}=53~{\\rm K}$ and 25~K for Sr$_{2}$YOsO$_6$ and\nSr$_{2}$InOsO$_6$, respectively.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks are strongly irradiated by a stellar FUV spectrum that\nis dominated by Ly$\\alpha$ photons. We investigate the impact of stellar\nLy$\\alpha$ irradiation on the terrestrial planet region of disks ($\\lesssim\n1$AU) using an updated thermal-chemical model of a disk atmosphere irradiated\nby stellar FUV and X-rays. The radiative transfer of Ly$\\alpha$ is implemented\nin a simple approach that includes scattering by H I and absorption by\nmolecules and dust. Because of their non-radial propagation path, scattered\nLy$\\alpha$ photons deposit their energy deeper in the disk atmosphere than the\nradially propagating FUV continuum photons. We find that Ly$\\alpha$ has a\nsignificant impact on the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Photochemical\nheating produced by scattered Ly$\\alpha$ photons interacting with water vapor\nand OH leads to a layer of hot (1500 - 2500 K) molecular gas. The temperature\nin the layer is high enough to thermally excite the H$_2$ to vibrational levels\nfrom which they can be fluoresced by Ly$\\alpha$ to produce UV fluorescent H$_2$\nemission. The resulting atmospheric structure may help explain the origin of UV\nfluorescent H$_2$ that is commonly observed from classical T Tauri stars.\n", "  I describe a new Bayesian based algorithm to infer the full three dimensional\nvelocity field from observed distances and spectroscopic galaxy catalogues. In\naddition to the velocity field itself, the algorithm reconstructs true\ndistances, some cosmological parameters and specific non-linearities in the\nvelocity field. The algorithm takes care of selection effects, miscalibration\nissues and can be easily extended to handle direct fitting of, e.g., the\ninverse Tully-Fisher relation. I first describe the algorithm in details\nalongside its performances. This algorithm is implemented in the VIRBIuS\n(VelocIty Reconstruction using Bayesian Inference Software) software package. I\nthen test it on different mock distance catalogues with a varying complexity of\nobservational issues. The model proved to give robust measurement of velocities\nfor mock catalogues of 3,000 galaxies. I expect the core of the algorithm to\nscale to tens of thousands galaxies. It holds the promises of giving a better\nhandle on future large and deep distance surveys for which individual errors on\ndistance would impede velocity field inference.\n", "  We present a selection of methods for automatically constructing an optimal\nkernel model for difference image analysis which require very few external\nparameters to control the kernel design. Each method consists of two\ncomponents; namely, a kernel design algorithm to generate a set of candidate\nkernel models, and a model selection criterion to select the simplest kernel\nmodel from the candidate models that provides a sufficiently good fit to the\ntarget image. We restricted our attention to the case of solving for a\nspatially-invariant convolution kernel composed of delta basis functions, and\nwe considered 19 different kernel solution methods including six employing\nkernel regularisation. We tested these kernel solution methods by performing a\ncomprehensive set of image simulations and investigating how their performance\nin terms of model error, fit quality, and photometric accuracy depends on the\nproperties of the reference and target images. We find that the irregular\nkernel design algorithm employing unregularised delta basis functions, combined\nwith either the Akaike or Takeuchi information criterion, is the best kernel\nsolution method in terms of photometric accuracy. Our results are validated by\ntests performed on two independent sets of real data. Finally, we provide some\nimportant recommendations for software implementations of difference image\nanalysis.\n", "  We present a catalogue containing the redshifts of 3,660 X-ray selected\ntargets in the XXL southern field. The redshifts were obtained with the AAOmega\nspectrograph and 2dF fibre positioner on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The\ncatalogue contains 1,515 broad line AGN, 528 stars, and redshifts for 41 out of\nthe 49 brightest X-ray selected clusters in the XXL southern field.\n", "  We present the first polarimetric space VLBI imaging observations at 22 GHz.\nBL Lacertae was observed in 2013 November 10 with the RadioAstron space VLBI\nmission, including a ground array of 15 radio telescopes. The instrumental\npolarization of the space radio telescope is found to be within 9%,\ndemonstrating the polarimetric imaging capabilities of RadioAstron at 22 GHz.\nGround-space fringes were obtained up to a projected baseline distance of 7.9\nEarth's diameters in length, allowing us to image the jet in BL Lacertae with a\nmaximum angular resolution of 21 $\\mu$as, the highest achieved to date. We find\nevidence for emission upstream of the radio core, which may correspond to a\nrecollimation shock at about 40 $\\mu$as from the jet apex, in a pattern that\nincludes other recollimation shocks at approximately 100 $\\mu$as and 250\n$\\mu$as from the jet apex. Polarized emission is detected in two components\nwithin the innermost 0.5 mas from the core, as well as in some knots 3 mas\ndownstream. Faraday rotation analysis, obtained from combining RadioAstron 22\nGHz and ground-based 15 GHz and 43 GHz images, shows a gradient in rotation\nmeasure and Faraday corrected polarization vector as a function of position\nangle with respect to the core, suggesting that the jet in BL Lacertae is\nthreaded by a helical magnetic field. The intrinsic de-boosted brightness\ntemperature in the unresolved core exceeds $3\\!\\times\\!10^{12}$ K, suggesting\nat the very least departure from equipartition of energy between the magnetic\nfield and radiating particles.\n", "  We explore the wind-driving mechanism of giant stars through the nearby (117\npc), intermediate-luminosity ($L \\approx 1600$ L$_\\odot$) star EU Del (HIP\n101810, HD 196610). APEX observations of the CO (3--2) and (2--1) transitions\nare used to derive a wind velocity of 9.51 $\\pm$ 0.02 km s$^{-1}$, a\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 14 $^{+9}_{-4}$, and a mass-loss rate of a few\n$\\times$ 10$^{-8}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. From published spectra, we estimate\nthat the star has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = --0.27 $\\pm$ $\\sim$0.30 dex. The\nstar's dusty envelope lacks a clear 10-$\\mu$m silicate feature, despite the\nstar's oxygen-rich nature. Radiative transfer modelling cannot fit a wind\nacceleration model which relies solely on radiation pressure on condensing\ndust. We compare our results to VY Leo (HIP 53449), a star with similar\ntemperature and luminosity, but different pulsation properties. We suggest the\nmuch stronger mass loss from EU Del may be driven by long-period stellar\npulsations, due to its potentially lower mass. We explore the implications for\nthe mass-loss rate and wind velocities of other stars.\n", "  Recently, Padmanabhan [arXiv:1206.4916 [hep-th]] discussed that the\ndifference between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and\nthe number of degrees of freedom in a bulk region causes the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. The main question that arises on the origin of this\ninequality between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of\nfreedom. We answer this question in M-theory. In our model, first M0-branes are\ncompactified on one circle and then N D0-branes are created. Then, N D0-branes\njoin to each other, grow and form a D5-brane. Next, D5- brane is compactified\non two circle and our universe-D3-brane, two D1-brane and some extra energies\nare produced. After that, one of the D1-branes, which is more close to the\nuniverse-brane, gives its energy into it, leads to an increase of the\ndifference between the number of degrees of freedom and the occurring inflation\nera. With the disappearance of this D1-brane, the number of degrees of freedom\nof boundary surface and bulk region becomes equal and inflation ends. At this\nstage, extra energies that are produced due to the compactification cause to an\nexpansion of universe and deceleration epoch. Finally, another D1-brane,\ndissolves in our universe-brane, leads to an inequality between degrees of\nfreedom and gives rise to a new phase of acceleration.\n", "  Heat conduction has been found a plausible solution to explain discrepancies\nbetween expected and measured temperatures in hot bubbles of planetary nebulae\n(PNe). While the heat conduction process depends on the chemical composition,\nto date it has been exclusively studied for pure hydrogen plasmas in PNe. A\nsmaller population of PNe show hydrogen-deficient and helium- and\ncarbon-enriched surfaces surrounded by bubbles of the same composition;\nconsiderable differences are expected in physical properties of these objects\nin comparison to the pure hydrogen case. The aim of this study is to explore\nhow a chemistry-dependent formulation of the heat conduction affects physical\nproperties and how it affects the X-ray emission from PN bubbles of\nhydrogen-deficient stars. We extend the description of heat conduction in our\nradiation hydrodynamics code to work with any chemical composition. We then\ncompare the bubble-formation process with a representative PN model using both\nthe new and the old descriptions. We also compare differences in the resulting\nX-ray temperature and luminosity observables of the two descriptions. The\nimproved equations show that the heat conduction in our representative model of\na hydrogen-deficient PN is nearly as efficient with the chemistry-dependent\ndescription; a lower value on the diffusion coefficient is compensated by a\nslightly steeper temperature gradient. The bubble becomes somewhat hotter with\nthe improved equations, but differences are otherwise minute. The observable\nproperties of the bubble in terms of the X-ray temperature and luminosity are\nseemingly unaffected.\n", "  Phase diagram of the ground states of DNA in a bad solvent is studied for a\nsemi-flexible polymer model with a generalized local elastic bending potential\ncharacterized by a nonlinearity parameter $x$ and effective self-attraction\npromoting compaction. $x=1$ corresponds to the worm-like chain model.\nSurprisingly, the phase diagram as well as the transition lines between the\nground states are found to be a function of $x$. The model provides a simple\nexplanation for the results of prior experimental and computational studies and\nmakes predictions for the specific geometries of the ground states. The results\nunderscore the impact of the form of the microscopic bending energy at\nmacroscopic observable scales.\n", "  We study distributions of the ratios of level spacings of a rectangular and\nan Africa-shaped superconducting microwave resonator containing circular\nscatterers on a triangular grid, so-called Dirac billiards (DBs). The\nhigh-precision measurements allowed the determination of all 1651 and 1823\neigenfrequencies in the first two bands, respectively. The resonance densities\nare similar to that of graphene. They exhibit two sharp peaks at the van Hove\nsingularities, that separate the band structure into regions with a linear and\na quadratic dispersion relation, respectively. In their vicinity we observe\nrapid changes, e.g., in the wavefunction structure. Accordingly, the question\narose, whether there the spectral properties are still determined by the shapes\nof the DBs. The commonly used statistical measures, however, are no longer\napplicable whereas, as demonstrated in this Letter, the ratio distributions\nprovide most suitable ones.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the circumgalactic gas in the halo of quasar\nhost galaxies from CIV absorption line systems. Optical spectroscopy of closely\naligned pairs of quasars (projected distance \\leq 200 kpc) obtained at the Gran\nTelescopio Canarias is used to investigate the distribution of the absorbing\ngas for a sample of 18 quasars at z \\sim 2. We found that the detected\nabsorption systems of EW \\geq 0.3Ang associated with the foreground QSO are\nrevealed up to 200 kpc from the center of the host galaxy. The structure of the\nabsorbing gas is rather patchy with a covering fraction of the gas that quickly\ndecreases beyond 100 kpc. These results are in qualitative agreement with those\nfound for the lower ionisation metal Mg II 2800 Ang.\n", "  We present the results of investigation of five stars, originally classified\nas dwarfs, belonging to Cyg OB2 association, their stellar and wind properties.\nUsing both TLUSTY and CMFGEN codes we derived effective temperatures, surface\ngravities, chemical abundances, mass-loss rates and projected rotation\nvelocities. Due to the fact that distance to the stars is well known, we were\nable to estimate their luminosities. Using evolutionary models we estimated the\nages of these sample stars and find that lower mass ones - MT282 and MT343 -\nbelong to older population of the association. Their ages are greater than 10\nMyr. The ages of three other stars - MT317, MT299, MT259 - are between 4-6 Myr.\n", "  We study the motion of colloidal particles driven by a constant force over a\nperiodic optical potential energy landscape. Firstly, the average particle\nvelocity is found as a function of the driving velocity and the wavelength of\nthe optical potential energy landscape. The relationship between average\nparticle velocity and driving velocity is found to be well described by a\ntheoretical model treating the landscape as sinusoidal, but only at small trap\nspacings. At larger trap spacings, a non-sinusoidal model for the landscape\nmust be used. Subsequently, the critical velocity required for a particle to\nmove across the landscape is determined as a function of the wavelength of the\nlandscape. Finally, the velocity of a particle driven at a velocity far\nexceeding the critical driving velocity is examined. Both of these results are\nagain well described by the two theoretical routes, for small and large trap\nspacings respectively. Brownian motion is found to have a significant effect on\nthe critical driving velocity, but a negligible effect when the driving\nvelocity is high.\n", "  We consider what can be learnt about the processes of gas accretion and\ndepletion from the kinematic misalignment between the cold/warm gas and stars\nin local early-type galaxies. Using simple analytic arguments and a toy model\nof the processes involved, we show that the lack of objects with\ncounter-rotating gas reservoirs strongly constrains the relaxation, depletion\nand accretion timescales of gas in early-type galaxies. Standard values of the\naccretion rate, star formation efficiency and relaxation rate are not\nsimultaneously consistent with the observed distribution of kinematic\nmisalignments. To reproduce that distribution, both fast gas depletion ($t_{\\rm\ndep} <10^8$ yr; e.g. more efficient star formation) and fast gas destruction\n(e.g. by active galactic nucleus feedback) can be invoked, but both also\nrequire a high rate of gas-rich mergers ($>1$ Gyr$^{-1}$). Alternatively, the\nrelaxation of misaligned material could happen over very long timescales\n($\\simeq100$ dynamical times or $\\approx1$-$5$ Gyr). We explore the various\nphysical processes that could lead to fast gas depletion and/or slow gas\nrelaxation, and discuss the prospects of using kinematic misalignments to probe\ngas-rich accretion processes in the era of large integral-field spectroscopic\nsurveys.\n", "  This paper considers secular interactions within multi-planet systems. In\nparticular we consider dynamical evolution of known planetary systems resulting\nfrom an additional hypothetical planet on an eccentric orbit. We start with an\nanalytical study of a general two-planet system, showing that a planet on an\nelliptical orbit transfers all of its eccentricity to an initially circular\nplanet if the two planets have comparable orbital angular momenta. Application\nto the single Super-Earth system HD38858 shows that an additional hypothetical\nplanet below current radial velocity (RV) constraints with\n{\\textit{Msini}}=3-10M$_\\oplus$, semi-major axis 1-10au and eccentricity\n0.2-0.8 is unlikely to be present from the eccentricity that would be excited\nin the known planet (albeit cyclically). However, additional planets in\nproximity to the known planet could stabilise the system against secular\nperturbations from outer planets. Moreover these additional planets can have an\n{\\textit{Msini}} below RV sensitivity and still affect their neighbours. For\nexample, application to the two Super-Earth system 61Vir shows that an\nadditional hypothetical planet cannot excite high eccentricities in the known\nplanets, unless its mass and orbit lie in a restricted area of parameter space.\nInner planets in HD38858 below RV sensitivity would also modify conclusions\nabove about excluded parameter space. This suggests that it may be possible to\ninfer the presence of additional stabilising planets in systems with an\neccentric outer planet and an inner planet on an otherwise suspiciously\ncircular orbit. This reinforces the point that the full complement of planets\nin a system is needed to assess its dynamical state.\n", "  AGN feedback is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution, however its\ntreatment in numerical simulations is necessarily approximate, requiring\nsubgrid prescriptions due to the dynamical range involved in the calculations.\nWe present a suite of SPH simulations designed to showcase the importance of\nthe choice of a particular subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. We\nconcentrate on two approaches to treating wide-angle AGN outflows: thermal\nfeedback, where thermal and kinetic energy is injected into the gas surrounding\nthe SMBH particle, and virtual particle feedback, where energy is carried by\ntracer particles radially away from the AGN. We show that the latter model\nproduces a far more complex structure around the SMBH, which we argue is a more\nphysically correct outcome. We suggest a simple improvement to the thermal\nfeedback model - injecting the energy into a cone, rather than spherically\nsymmetrically - and show that this markedly improves the agreement between the\ntwo prescriptions, without requiring any noticeable increase in the\ncomputational cost of the simulation.\n", "  We report on the proper motions of Balmer-dominated filaments in Kepler's\nsupernova remnant using high resolution images obtained with the Hubble Space\nTelescope at two epochs separated by about 10 years. We use the improved proper\nmotion measurements and revised values of shock velocities to derive a distance\nto Kepler of 5.1 [+0.8, -0.7] kpc. The main shock around the northern rim of\nthe remnant has a typical speed of 1690 km/s and is encountering material with\ndensities of about 8 cm^-3. We find evidence for the variation of shock\nproperties over small spatial scales, including differences in the driving\npressures as the shock wraps around a curved cloud surface. We find that the\nBalmer filaments ahead of the ejecta knot on the northwest boundary of the\nremnant are becoming fainter and more diffuse. We also find that the Balmer\nfilaments associated with circumstellar material in the interior regions of the\nremnant are due to shocks with significantly lower velocities and that the\nbrightness variations among these filaments trace the density distribution of\nthe material, which may have a disk-like geometry.\n", "  In many quantum architectures the solid-state qubits, such as quantum dots or\ncolor centers, are interfaced via emitted photons. However, the frequency of\nphotons emitted by solid-state systems exhibits slow uncontrollable\nfluctuations over time (spectral diffusion), creating a serious problem for\nimplementation of the photon-mediated protocols. Here we show that a sequence\nof optical pulses applied to the solid-state emitter can stabilize the emission\nline at the desired frequency. We demonstrate efficiency, robustness, and\nfeasibility of the method analytically and numerically. Taking nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) center in diamond as an example, we show that only several pulses, with\nthe width of 1 ns, separated by few ns (which is not difficult to achieve) can\nsuppress spectral diffusion. Our method provides a simple and robust way to\ngreatly improve the efficiency of photon-mediated entanglement and/or coupling\nto photonic cavities for solid-state qubits.\n", "  Magnetized neutron stars are privileged places where strong electromagnetic\nfields as high as $\\BQ=4.4\\times10^9$~T exist, giving rise to non-linear\ncorrections to Maxwell equations described by quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nThese corrections need to be included to the general relativistic (GR)\ndescription of a magnetic dipole supposed to be anchored in the neutron star.\nIn this paper, these QED and GR perturbations to the standard flat space-time\ndipole are calculated to the lowest order in the fine structure\nconstant~$\\alpha_{\\rm sf}$ and to any order in the ratio $\\Rs/R$ where $R$ is\nthe neutron star radius and $\\Rs$ its Schwarzschild radius. Following our new\n3+1~formalism developed in a previous work, we compute the multipolar\nnon-linear corrections to this dipole and demonstrate the presence of a small\ndipolar~$\\ell=1$ and hexapolar~$\\ell=3$ component.\n", "  The equivalence of domain wall and overlap fermion formulations is\ndemonstrated for lattice gauge theories in 2+1 spacetime dimensions with\nparity-invariant mass terms. Even though the domain wall approach distinguishes\npropagation along a third direction with projectors ${1\\over2}(1\\pm\\gamma_3)$,\nthe truncated overlap operator obtained for finite wall separation $L_s$ is\ninvariant under interchange of $\\gamma_3$ and $\\gamma_5$. In the limit\n$L_s\\to\\infty$ the resulting Ginsparg-Wilson relations recover the expected\nU($2N_f$) global symmetry up to O($a$) corrections. Finally it is shown that\nfinite-$L_s$ corrections to bilinear condensates associated with dynamical mass\ngeneration are characterised by whether even powers of the symmetry-breaking\nmass are present; such terms are absent for antihermitian bilinears such as\n$i\\bar\\psi\\gamma_3\\psi$, markedly improving the approach to the large-$L_s$\nlimit.\n", "  Ubiquitous small-scale vortices have recently been found in the lower\natmosphere of the quiet Sun in state-of-the-art solar observations and in\nnumerical simulations. We investigate the characteristics and temporal\nevolution of a granular-scale vortex and its associated upflows through the\nphotosphere and chromosphere of a quiet Sun internetwork region. We analyzed\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution ground- and spaced-based observations of a\nquiet Sun region. The observations consist of high-cadence time series of\nwideband and narrowband images of both H-alpha 6563 A and Ca II 8542 A lines\nobtained with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) instrument at the\nSwedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), as well as ultraviolet imaging and spectral\ndata simultaneously obtained by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS). A small-scale vortex is observed for the first time simultaneously in\nH-alpha, Ca II 8542 A, and Mg II k lines. During the evolution of the vortex,\nH-alpha narrowband images at -0.77 A and Ca II 8542 A narrowband images at -0.5\nA, and their corresponding Doppler Signal maps, clearly show consecutive\nhigh-speed upflow events in the vortex region. These high-speed upflows with a\nsize of 0.5-1 Mm appear in the shape of spiral arms and exhibit two distinctive\napparent motions in the plane of sky for a few minutes: (1) a swirling motion\nwith an average speed of 13 km/s and (2) an expanding motion at a rate of 4-6\nkm/s. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of Mg II k and Mg II subordinate lines\nin the vortex region indicates an upward velocity of up to about 8 km/s along\nwith a higher temperature compared to the nearby quiet Sun chromosphere. The\nconsecutive small-scale vortex events can heat the upper chromosphere by\ndriving continuous high-speed upflows through the lower atmosphere.\n", "  Due to longer dynamical timescales, the outskirts of early-type galaxies\nretain the footprint of their formation and assembly. Under the popular\ntwo-phase galaxy formation scenario, an initial in-situ phase of star formation\nis followed by minor merging and accretion of ex-situ stars leading to the\nexpectation of observable transitions in the kinematics and stellar populations\non large scales. However, observing the faint galactic outskirts is\nchallenging, often leaving the transition unexplored. The large scale,\nspatially-resolved stellar kinematic data from the SAGES Legacy Unifying\nGalaxies and GlobularS (SLUGGS) survey are ideal for detecting kinematic\ntransitions. We present kinematic maps out to 2.6 effective radii on average,\nkinemetry profiles, measurement of kinematic twists and misalignments, and the\naverage outer intrinsic shape of 25 SLUGGS galaxies. We find good overall\nagreement in the kinematic maps and kinemetry radial profiles with literature.\nWe are able to confirm significant radial modulations in rotational versus\npressure support of galaxies with radius so that the central and outer\nrotational properties may be quite different. We also test the suggestion that\ngalaxies may be more triaxial in their outskirts and find that while fast\nrotating galaxies were already shown to be axisymmetric in their inner regions,\nwe are unable to rule out triaxiality in their outskirts. We compare our\nderived outer kinematic information to model predictions from a two-phase\ngalaxy formation scenario. We find that the theoretical range of local outer\nangular momentum agrees well with our observations, but that radial modulations\nare much smaller than predicted.\n", "  We compute the area(or entropy) product formula for a regular black hole\nderived by Ay\\'on-Beato and Garc\\'ia in 1998\\cite{abg}. By explicit and exact\ncalculation, it is shown that the entropy product formula of two physical\nhorizons strictly \\emph{depends} upon the ADM mass parameter that means it is\n\\emph{not} an universal(mass-independent) quantity. But a slightly more\ncomplicated function of event horizon area and Cauchy horizon area is indeed a\n\\emph{mass-independent} quantity. We also compute other thermodynamic\nproperties of the said black hole. We further study the stability of such black\nhole by computing the specific heat for both the horizons. It has been observed\nthat under certain condition the black hole possesses second order phase\ntransition. The pictorial diagram of the phase transition is given.\n", "  Late type non-starburst galaxies have been shown to contain X-ray emitting\nobjects, some being ultraluminous X-ray sources. We report on XMM-Newton\nobservations of 11 nearby, late-type galaxies previously observed with the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) in order to find such objects. We found 18 X-ray\nsources in or near the optical extent of the galaxies, most being point-like.\nIf associated with the corresponding galaxies, the source luminosities range\nfrom $2 \\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $6 \\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We\nfound one ultraluminous X-ray source, which is in the galaxy IC 5052, and one\nsource coincident with the galaxy IC 4662 with a blackbody temperature of\n$0.166 \\pm 0.015$ keV that could be a quasi-soft source or a quiescent neutron\nstar X-ray binary in the Milky Way. One X-ray source, XMMU J205206.0$-$691316,\nis extended and coincident with a galaxy cluster visible on an HST image. The\nX-ray spectrum of the cluster reveals a redshift of $z = 0.25 \\pm 0.02$ and a\ntemperature of 3.6$\\pm$0.4 keV. The redshift was mainly determined by a cluster\nof Fe XXIV lines between the observed energy range $0.8-1.0$ keV.\n", "  (Abridged) We perform the first study of magnetohydrodynamic processes in the\nprotolunar disk (PLD). With the use of published data on the chemical\ncomposition of the PLD, along with existing analytical models of the disk\nstructure, we show that the high temperatures that were prevalent in the disk\nwould have led to ionization of Na, K, SiO, Zn and, to a lesser extent, O$_2$.\nWe assume that the disk has a vapor structure. The resulting ionization\nfractions, together with a relatively weak magnetic field, would have been\nsufficient to trigger the magneto-rotational instability, or MRI. We calculate\nthe intensity of the resulting magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, as parameterized\nby the dimensionless ratio $\\alpha$ of turbulent stresses to gas pressure, and\nobtain maximum values $\\alpha\\sim 10^{-2}$ along most of the vertical extent of\nthe disk, and at different orbital radii. Under these conditions, turbulent\nmixing within the PLD due to the MRI was likely capable of transporting\nisotopic and chemical species efficiently. To test these results in a\nconservative manner, we carry out a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of\na small, rectangular patch of the PLD, located at 4 Earth radii ($r_{\\rm E}$)\nfrom the center of the Earth, and assuming once again that the disk is\ncompletely gaseous. We obtain turbulence with an average intensity $\\alpha\\sim\n7\\times 10^{-6}$ over the course of 280 orbital periods (133 days at\n4$r_{\\rm{E}}$). Despite this relatively low value of $\\alpha$, the effective\nturbulent diffusivity of a passive tracer introduced in the flow is large\nenough to allow the tracer to spread across a radial distance of $10r_{\\rm{E}}$\nin $\\sim13-129$ yr, less than the estimated cooling time of the PLD of\n$\\sim250$ yr. Further improvements to our model will need to incorporate the\nenergy balance in the disk, a complete two-phase structure, and a more\nrealistic equation of state.\n", "  Ricci-flat metrics of the ultrahyperbolic signature which enjoy the\nl-conformal Galilei symmetry are constructed. They involve the AdS_2-metric in\na way similar to the near horizon black hole geometries. The associated\ngeodesic equations are shown to describe a second order dynamical system for\nwhich the acceleration generators are functionally independent.\n", "  We present the study of the X2-class flare which occurred on the 27 October\n2014 and was observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and\nthe EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode satellite. Thanks to the\nhigh cadence and spatial resolution of the IRIS and EIS instruments, we are\nable to compare simultaneous observations of the \\xxi~1354.08~\\AA~and\n\\xxiii~263.77~\\AA~high temperature emission ($\\gtrsim$ 10~MK) in the flare\nribbon during the chromospheric evaporation phase. We find that IRIS observes\ncompletely blue-shifted \\xxi~line profiles, up to 200 km s$^{-1}$ during the\nrise phase of the flare, indicating that the site of the plasma upflows is\nresolved by IRIS. In contrast, the \\xxiii~line is often asymmetric, which we\ninterpret as being due to the lower spatial resolution of EIS. Temperature\nestimates from SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT show that hot emission (log($T$)[K] $>$\n7.2) is first concentrated at the footpoints before filling the loops. Density\nsensitive lines from IRIS and EIS give electron number density estimates of\n$\\gtrsim$~10$^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$ in the transition region lines and\n10$^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$ in the coronal lines during the impulsive phase. In order\nto compare the observational results against theoretical predictions, we have\nrun a simulation of a flare loop undergoing heating using the HYDRAD 1D hydro\ncode. We find that the simulated plasma parameters are close to the observed\nvalues which are obtained with IRIS, Hinode and AIA. These results support an\nelectron beam heating model rather than a purely thermal conduction model as\nthe driving mechanism for this flare.\n", "  Impurities act as in situ probes of nontrivial electronic structure, causing\nreal-space modulations in the density of states detected by scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy on the sample surface. We show that distinctive topological\nfeatures of Weyl semimetals can be revealed in the Fourier transform of this\nmap, interpreted in terms of quasiparticle interference (QPI). We develop an\nexact Green's function formalism and apply it to generalized models of Weyl\nsemimetals with an explicit surface. The type of perturbation lifting the Dirac\nnode degeneracy to produce the three-dimensional bulk Weyl phase determines the\nspecific QPI signatures appearing on the surface. QPI Fermi arcs may or may not\nappear, depending on the relative surface orientation and quantum interference\neffects. Line nodes give rise to tube projections of width controlled by the\nbias voltage. We consider the effect of crystal warping, distinguishing\ndispersive arclike features from true Fermi arcs. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe commonly used joint-density-of-states approach fails qualitatively, and\ncannot describe QPI extinction.\n", "  Dark matter in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way may take the form of a dark\nplasma. Hidden sector dark matter charged under an unbroken $U(1)'$ gauge\ninteraction provides a simple and well defined particle physics model realising\nthis possibility. The assumed $U(1)'$ neutrality of the Universe then implies\n(at least) two oppositely charged dark matter components with self-interactions\nmediated via a massless \"dark photon\" (the $U(1)'$ gauge boson). In addition to\nnuclear recoils such dark matter can give rise to keV electron recoils in\ndirect detection experiments. In this context, the detailed physical properties\nof the dark matter plasma interacting with the Earth is required. This is a\ncomplex system, which is here modelled as a fluid governed by the\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. These equations are numerically solved for some\nillustrative examples, and implications for direct detection experiments\ndiscussed. In particular, the analysis presented here leaves open the\nintriguing possibility that the DAMA annual modulation signal is due primarily\nto electron recoils (or even a combination of electron recoils and nuclear\nrecoils). The importance of diurnal modulation (in addition to annual\nmodulation) as a means of probing this kind of dark matter is also emphasised.\n", "  We present the discovery of a young L dwarf, WISE J231921.92+764544.4,\nidentified by comparing the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky\nCatalog to the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). A medium-resolution optical\nspectrum provides a spectral type of L4$\\beta$, with a photometric distance\nestimate of 26.1$\\pm$4.4 pc. The red WISE $W1-W2$ color provides additional\nevidence of youth, while the 2MASS $J-K_{\\rm s}$ color does not. WISE\nJ231921.92+764544.4 is a candidate member of the young moving group Argus, with\nthe space motion and position of WISE J231921.92+764544.4 giving a probability\nof 79% membership in Argus and a probability of 21% as a field object, based on\nBANYAN II. WISE J231921.92+764544.4 has a mass of 12.1$\\pm$0.4 M$_{\\rm Jup}$\nbased on membership in Argus, within the planetary mass regime.\n", "  Recent surveys of dust continuum emission at sub-mm wavelengths have shown\nthat filamentary molecular clouds are ubiquitous along the Galactic plane.\nThese structures are inhomogeneous, with over-densities that are sometimes\nassociated with infrared emission and active of star formation. To investigate\nthe connection between filaments and star formation, requires an understanding\nof the processes that lead to the fragmentation of filaments and a\ndetermination of the physical properties of the over-densities (clumps). In\nthis paper, we present a multi-wavelength study of five filamentary molecular\nclouds, containing several clumps in different evolutionary stages of star\nformation. We analyse the fragmentation of the filaments and derive the\nphysical properties of their clumps. We find that the clumps in all filaments\nhave a characteristic spacing consistent with the prediction of the `sausage'\ninstability theory, regardless of the complex morphology of the filaments or\ntheir evolutionary stage. We also find that most clumps have sufficient mass\nand density to form high-mass stars, supporting the idea that high-mass stars\nand clusters form within filaments.\n", "  Compact binaries are the most promising source for the advanced gravitational\nwave detectors, which will start operating this year. The influence of spin on\nthe binary evolution is an important consequence of general relativity and can\nbe large. It is argued that the spin supplementary condition, which is related\nto the observer dependence of the center, gives rise to a gauge symmetry in the\naction principle of spinning point-particles. These spinning point-particles\nserve as an analytic model for extended bodies. The internal structure can be\nmodelled by augmenting the point-particle with higher-order multipole moments.\nConsequences of the recently discovered universal (equation of state\nindependent) relations between the multipole moments of neutron stars are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The rubble pile spin barrier is an upper limit on the rotation rate of\nasteroids larger than ~200-300 m. Among thousands of asteroids with diameters\nlarger than ~300 m, only a handful of asteroids are known to rotate faster than\n2.0 h, all are in the sub-km range (<=0.6 km). Here we present photometric\nmeasurements suggesting that (60716) 2000 GD65, an S-complex, inner-main belt\nasteroid with a relatively large diameter of 2.3 +0.6-0.7 km, completes one\nrotation in 1.9529+-0.0002 h. Its unique diameter and rotation period allow us\nto examine scenarios about asteroid internal structure and evolution: a rubble\npile bound only by gravity; a rubble-pile with strong cohesion; a monolithic\nstructure; an asteroid experiencing mass shedding; an asteroid experiencing\nYORP spin-up/down; and an asteroid with a unique octahedron shape results with\na four-peak lightcurve and a 3.9 h period. We find that the most likely\nscenario includes a lunar-like cohesion that can prevent (60716) 2000 GD65 from\ndisrupting without requiring a monolithic structure or a unique shape. Due to\nthe uniqueness of (60716) 2000 GD65, we suggest that most asteroids typically\nhave smaller cohesion than that of lunar regolith.\n", "  We examine the phase evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons\ngenerated in a dye microcavity by temporal interference with a phase reference.\nThe photo-excitable dye molecules constitute a reservoir of variable size for\nthe condensate particles, allowing for grand canonical statistics with photon\nbunching, as in a lamp-type source. We directly observe phase jumps of the\ncondensate associated with the large statistical number fluctuations and find a\nseparation of correlation timescales. For large systems, our data reveals phase\ncoherence and a spontaneously broken symmetry, despite the statistical\nfluctuations.\n", "  The study of long-term evolution of neutron star (NS) magnetic fields is key\nto understanding the rich diversity of NS observations, and to unifying their\nnature despite the different emission mechanisms and observed properties. Such\nstudies in principle permit a deeper understanding of the most important\nparameters driving their apparent variety, e.g. radio pulsars, magnetars, x-ray\ndim isolated neutron stars, gamma-ray pulsars. We describe, for the first time,\nthe results from self-consistent magneto-thermal simulations considering not\nonly the effects of the Hall-driven field dissipation in the crust, but adding\na complete set of proposed driving forces in a superconducting core. We\nemphasize how each of these core-field processes drive magnetic evolution and\naffect observables, and show that when all forces are considered together in\nvectorial form, the net expulsion of core magnetic flux is negligible, and will\nhave no observable effect in the crust (consequently in the observed surface\nemission) on megayear time-scales. Our new simulations suggest that strong\nmagnetic fields in NS cores (and the signatures on the NS surface) will persist\nlong after the crustal magnetic field has evolved and decayed, due to the weak\ncombined effects of dissipation and expulsion in the stellar core.\n", "  We study the production line shape of $B^\\ast\\bar B$ near threshold, where\nthe $B^\\ast \\bar B$ pair comes from the resonance $X_b$. Our study shows that\nthe line shape depends sensitively on the binding energy and the probability of\nfinding an elementary state in the physical bound state. Both of the two\nparameters are crucial to identify the structure of $X_b$. Therefore, the line\nshape measurement can shed light on the structure of $X_b$.\n", "  High-resolution numerical simulations of a tethered model bumblebee in\nforward flight are performed superimposing homogeneous isotropic turbulent\nfluctuations to the uniform inflow. Despite tremendous variation in turbulence\nintensity, between 17% and 99% with respect to the mean flow, we do not find\nsignificant changes in cycle-averaged aerodynamic forces, moments or flight\npower when averaged over realizations, compared to laminar inflow conditions.\nThe variance of aerodynamic measures, however, significantly increases with\nincreasing turbulence intensity, which may explain flight instabilities\nobserved in freely flying bees.\n", "  We first study superpolynomial associated to triply-graded reduced colored\nHOMFLY-PT homology. We propose conjectures of congruent relations and\ncyclotomic expansion for it. We prove conjecture of $N=1$ for torus knot case,\nthrough which we obtain the corresponding invariant\n$\\alpha(T(m,n))=-(m-1)(n-1)/2$. This is closely related to the Milnor\nconjecture. Many examples including homologically thick knots and higher\nrepresentations are also tested. Based on these examples, we further propose a\nconjecture that invariant $\\alpha$ determined in cyclotomic expansion at $N=1$\nis a lower bound for smooth 4-ball genus. According to the structure of\ncyclotomic expansion, we propose a volume conjecture for $SU(n)$ specialized\nsuperpolynomial associated to reduced colored HOMFLY homology. We also prove\nthe figure eight case for this new volume conjecture.\n  Then we study superpolynomial associated to triply-graded reduced colored\nKauffman homology. We propose a conjecture of cyclotomic expansion for it.\nHomologically thick examples and higher representations are tested. Finally we\napply the same idea to the Heegaard-Floer knot homology and also obtain an\nexpansion formula for all the examples we tested.\n", "  We present new measurements of the flux densities at submillimeter\nwavelengths based on ALMA band 7 (338 GHz) and band 9 (679 GHz) observations to\nbetter constrain the origin of the continuum emission of the Mira AB binary\nsystem and to check its orbit. We have measured the Mira A and Mira B continuum\nin ALMA band 7, with a resolution of ~0\"31, and for the first time in ALMA band\n9, with a resolution of ~0\"18. We resolved the binary system at both bands, and\nderived the continuum spectral index of the stars and their relative position.\nWe also analyzed ALMA SciVer data obtained in bands 6 and 3. Measurements at\ncentimeter wavelengths obtained by other authors have been included in our\nstudy of the spectral energy distribution of the Mira components. The Mira A\ncontinuum emission has a spectral index of 1.98+-0.04 extending from\nsubmillimeter down to centimeter wavelengths. The spectral index of the Mira B\ncontinuum emission is 1.93+-0.06 at wavelengths ranging from submillimeter to\n~3.1 mm, and a shallower spectral index of 1.22+-0.09 at longer wavelengths.\nThe Mira A continuum emission up to submillimeter wavelengths is consistent\nwith that of a radio photosphere surrounding the evolved star for which models\npredict a spectral index close to 2. The Mira B continuum emission cannot be\ndescribed with a single ionized component. An extremely compact and dense\nregion around the star can produce the nearly thermal continuum measured in the\n0.4-3.1 mm wavelength range, and an inhomogeneous, less dense, and slightly\nlarger ionized envelope could be responsible for the emission at longer\nwavelengths. Our results illustrate the potential of ALMA for high precision\nastrometry of binary systems. We have found a significant discrepancy of ~14\nmilliarcsec between the ALMA measurements and the predicted orbit positions.\n", "  We extract the phase coherence of a qubit defined by singlet and triplet\nelectronic states in a gated GaAs triple quantum dot, measuring on timescales\nmuch shorter than the decorrelation time of the environmental noise. In this\nnon-ergodic regime, we observe that the coherence is boosted and several\ndephasing times emerge, depending on how the phase stability is extracted. We\nelucidate their mutual relations, and demonstrate that they reflect the noise\nshort-time dynamics.\n", "  We analyze a coupling scheme for qubits in different cavities of circuit-QED\narchitecture. In contrast to the usual scheme where the cavities are coupled by\nan interface capacitance we employ a bridge qubit connecting cavities to\nmediate two-qubit coupling. This active coupling scheme makes it possible to\nswitch on/off and adjust the strength of qubit-qubit coupling, which is\nessential for scalability of quantum circuit. By transforming the Hamiltonian\nwe obtain an exact expression of two-qubit coupling in the rotating-wave\napproximation. For the general case of $n$ qubits the Hamiltonian can produce\nthe W state as an eigenstate of the system. We calculate the decay rate of the\ncoupled qubit-resonator system to find that it is viable in real experiments.\n", "  Metal contacts are fundamental building components for graphene based\nelectronic devices and their properties are greatly influenced by interface\nquality during device fabrication, leading to resistance variation. Here we\nshow that nickel graphene junction degrades after air exposure, due to\ninterfacial oxidation, thus creating a tunneling barrier. Most importantly, we\ndemonstrate that hydrogen annealing at moderate temperature (300 0C) is an\neffective technique to reverse the degradation.\n", "  The 1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ lines of ortho and para--NH$_2$D (o/p-NH$_2$D),\nrespectively at 86 and 110 GHz, are commonly observed to provide constraints on\nthe deuterium fractionation in the interstellar medium. In cold regions, the\nhyperfine structure due to the nitrogen ($^{14}$N) nucleus is resolved. To\ndate, this splitting is the only one which is taken into account in the NH$_2$D\ncolumn density estimates. We investigate how the inclusion of the hyperfine\nsplitting caused by the deuterium (D) nucleus affects the analysis of the\nrotational lines of NH$_2$D. We present 30m IRAM observations of the above\nmentioned lines, as well as APEX o/p-NH$_2$D observations of the\n1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ lines at 333 GHz. The hyperfine spectra are first analyzed\nwith a line list that only includes the hyperfine splitting due to the $^{14}$N\nnucleus. We find inconsistencies between the line widths of the\n1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ and 1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ lines, the latter being larger by a\nfactor of $\\sim$1.6$\\pm0.3$. Such a large difference is unexpected given the\ntwo sets of lines are likely to originate from the same region. We next employ\na newly computed line list for the o/p-NH$_2$D transitions, where the hyperfine\nstructure induced by both nitrogen and deuterium nuclei is included. With this\nnew line list, the analysis of the previous spectra leads to linewidths which\nare compatible. Neglecting the hyperfine structure owing to D leads to\noverestimate the linewidths of the o/p-NH$_2$D lines at 3 mm. The error for a\ncold molecular core is about 50\\%. This error propagates directly to the column\ndensity estimate. It is therefore recommended to take into account the\nhyperfine splittings caused by both the $^{14}$N and D nuclei in any analysis\nrelying on these lines.\n", "  For toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, open Gromov-Witten invariants associated to\nRiemann surfaces with one boundary component can be written as the product of a\ndisk factor and a closed invariant. Using the Brini-Cavalieri-Ross formalism,\nthese disk factors can often be expressed in terms of gamma classes. When the\nLagrangian boundary cycle is preserved by the torus action and can be locally\ndescribed as the fixed locus of an anti-holomorphic involution, we prove a\nformula that expresses the disk factor in terms of a gamma class and\ncombinatorial data about the image of the Lagrangian cycle in the moment\npolytope. We verify that this formula encodes the expected invariants obtained\nfrom localization by comparing with several examples. We then examine a novel\napplication of this formula to disk enumeration on the quintic 3-fold. Finally,\nmotivated by large $N$ duality, we show that this formula also unexpectedly\napplies to Lagrangian cycles on $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^1}(-1,-1)$ constructed\nfrom torus knots.\n", "  Each of the two STEREO spacecraft carries a SEPT Instrument which measures\nelectrons and protons. Anisotropy observations are provided in four viewing\ndirections. The SEP event on 7 Nov 2013 was observed by both STEREO spacecraft,\nwhich were longitudinally separated by 68{\\deg} at that time. While STEREO A\nobserved the expected characteristics of an SEP event at a well-connected\nposition, STEREO B detected a very anisotropic bi-directional distribution of\nnear-relativistic electrons and was situated inside a magnetic-cloud-like\nstructure during the early phase of the event. We examine the source of the\nbi-directional SEP distribution at STEREO B. On the one hand this distribution\ncould be caused by a double injection into both loop legs of the MC. On the\nother hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the\nopposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron\nobservations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic\ncloud. We show that STEREO B was embedded in an MC-like structure ejected three\ndays earlier. We apply a GCS model to the coronagraph observations from three\nviewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud model to the in situ\nmeasurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC\nclose to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the\nelectrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field\nline winding inside the structure. The relative intensity and timing of the\nenergetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B\nstrongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP\ninjections in both loop legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring\nfarther away beyond the STEREO orbit. Observations by the Nancay\nRadioheliograph of two distinct radio sources during the SEP injection further\nsupport the above scenario.\n", "  The surface rotation rates of young solar-type stars vary rapidly with age\nfrom the end of the pre-main sequence through the early main sequence.\nImportant changes in the dynamos operating in these stars may result from this\nevolution, which should be observable in their surface magnetic fields. Here we\npresent a study aimed at observing the evolution of these magnetic fields\nthrough this critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and\nstellar associations of known ages, and used Zeeman Doppler Imaging to\ncharacterize their complex magnetic large-scale fields. Presented here are\nresults for 15 stars, from 5 associations, with ages from 20 to 250 Myr, masses\nfrom 0.7 to 1.2 solar masses, and rotation periods from 0.4 to 6 days. We find\ncomplex large-scale magnetic field geometries, with global average strengths\nfrom 14 to 140 G. There is a clear trend towards decreasing average large-scale\nmagnetic field strength with age, and a tight correlation between magnetic\nfield strength and Rossby number. Comparing the magnetic properties of our\nzero-age main sequence sample to those of both younger and older stars, it\nappears that the magnetic evolution of solar-type stars during the pre-main\nsequence is primarily driven by structural changes, while it closely follows\nthe stars' rotational evolution on the main sequence.\n", "  We explore the critical fluctuations near the chiral critical endpoint (CEP)\nin a chiral effective model and discuss possible signals of the CEP, recently\nexplored experimentally in nuclear collision. Particular attention is paid to\nthe dependence of such signals on the location of the phase boundary and the\nCEP relative to the chemical freeze-out conditions in nuclear collisions. We\nargue that in effective models, standard freeze-out fits to heavy-ion data\nshould not be used directly. Instead, the relevant quantities should be\nexamined on lines in the phase diagram that are defined self-consistently,\nwithin the framework of the model. We discuss possible choices for such an\napproach.\n", "  This paper proposes a spatial-Radon domain CT image reconstruction model\nbased on data-driven tight frames (SRD-DDTF). The proposed SRD-DDTF model\ncombines the idea of joint image and Radon domain inpainting model of\n\\cite{Dong2013X} and that of the data-driven tight frames for image denoising\n\\cite{cai2014data}. It is different from existing models in that both CT image\nand its corresponding high quality projection image are reconstructed\nsimultaneously using sparsity priors by tight frames that are adaptively\nlearned from the data to provide optimal sparse approximations. An alternative\nminimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model which is\nnonsmooth and nonconvex. Convergence analysis of the algorithm is provided.\nNumerical experiments showed that the SRD-DDTF model is superior to the model\nby \\cite{Dong2013X} especially in recovering some subtle structures in the\nimages.\n", "  Two recently discovered very luminous supernovae (SNe) present stimulating\ncases to explore the extents of the available theoretical models. SN 2011kl\nrepresents the first detection of a supernova explosion associated with an\nultra-long duration gamma ray burst. ASASSN-15lh was even claimed as the most\nluminous SN ever discovered, challenging the scenarios so far proposed for\nstellar explosions. Here we use our radiation hydrodynamics code in order to\nsimulate magnetar powered SNe. To avoid explicitly assuming neutron star\nproperties we adopt the magnetar luminosity and spin-down timescale as free\nparameters of the model. We find that the light curve (LC) of SN 2011kl is\nconsistent with a magnetar power source, as previously proposed, but we note\nthat some amount of 56^Ni (> 0.08 M_sun) is necessary to explain the low\ncontrast between the LC peak and tail. For the case of ASASSN-15lh we find\nphysically plausible magnetar parameters that reproduce the overall shape of\nthe LC provided the progenitor mass is relatively large (a mass of the ejecta\napprox 6 M_sun). The ejecta hydrodynamics of this event is dominated by the\nmagnetar input, while the effect is more moderate for SN 2011kl. We conclude\nthat a magnetar model may be used for the interpretation of these events and\nthat the hydrodynamic modeling is necessary to derive the properties of\npowerful magnetars and their progenitors.\n", "  Following a number of conflicting studies of M87's mass profile, we undertake\na dynamical analysis of multiple tracer populations to constrain its mass over\na large radius range. We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with\nthe dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies\nextending to scales comparable with the virial radius. Using a spherical Jeans\nanalysis, we are able to disentangle the mass contributions from the dark and\nbaryonic components and set constraints on the structure of each. Assuming\nisotropy, we explore four different models for the dark matter halo and find\nthat a centrally-cored dark matter distribution is preferred. We infer a\nstellar mass-to-light ratio $\\Upsilon_{\\star,v} = 6.9 \\pm 0.1$ -- consistent\nwith a Salpeter-like IMF -- and a core radius $r_c = 67 \\pm 20$ kpc. We then\nintroduce anisotropy and find that, while the halo remains clearly cored, the\nradial stellar anisotropy has a strong impact on both $\\Upsilon_{\\star,v}$ and\nthe core's radius; here we find $\\Upsilon_{\\star,v} = 3.50_{-0.36}^{+0.32}$ --\nconsistent with a Chabrier-like IMF -- and $r_c = 19.00_{-8.34}^{+8.38}$ kpc.\nThus the presence of a core at the centre of the dark halo is robust against\nanisotropy assumptions, while the stellar mass and core size are not. We are\nable to reconcile previously discrepant studies by showing that modelling the\nglobular cluster data alone leads to the very different inference of a\nsuper-NFW cusp, thus highlighting the value of multiple-population modelling,\nand we point to the possible role of M87's AGN and the cluster environment in\nforming the central dark matter core.\n", "  Inner-shell vacancy production for the O$^{8+}$-Li collision system at 1.5\nMeV/amu is studied theoretically. The theory combines single-electron\namplitudes for each electron in the system to extract multielectron information\nabout the collision process. Doubly-differential cross sections obtained in\nthis way are then compared with the recent experimental data by LaForge et al.\n[J. Phys. B 46, 031001 (2013)] yielding good resemblance, especially for low\noutgoing electron energy. A careful analysis of the processes that contribute\nto inner-shell vacancy production shows that the improvement of the results as\ncompared to single-active-electron calculations can be attributed to the\nleading role of two-electron excitation-ionization processes.\n", "  We examine deep Chandra X-ray observations of the Centaurus cluster of\ngalaxies, Abell 3526. Applying a gradient magnitude filter reveals a wealth of\nstructure, from filamentary soft emission on 100pc (0.5 arcsec) scales close to\nthe nucleus to features 10s of kpc in size at larger radii. The cluster\ncontains multiple high-metallicity regions with sharp edges. Relative to an\nazimuthal average, the deviations of metallicity and surface brightness are\ncorrelated, and the temperature is inversely correlated, as expected if the\nlarger scale asymmetries in the cluster are dominated by sloshing motions.\nAround the western cold front are a series of ~7 kpc 'notches', suggestive of\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to\nclose to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity\nblobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity,\nalso explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity\nprofile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1.9-kpc-radius\ninner shell-like structure and a weak 1.1-1.4 Mach number shock around the\ncentral cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are 9 depressions in surface\nbrightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The\nshocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5-10\nMyr timescales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling. We\nconfirm the presence of a series of linear quasi-periodic structures. If they\nare sound waves, the ~5 kpc spacing implies a period of 6 Myr, similar to the\nages of the shocks and cavities. Alternatively, these structures may be\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, their associated turbulence or amplified\nmagnetic field layers.\n", "  Dust determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks. However,\ndust temperature determinations almost invariably rely on a complex modeling of\nthe Spectral Energy Distribution. We attempt a direct determination of the\ntemperature of large grains emitting at mm wavelengths.} We observe the edge-on\ndust disk of the Flying Saucer, which appears in silhouette against the CO\nJ=2-1 emission from a background molecular cloud in $\\rho$ Oph. The combination\nof velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk and intensity\nvariations in the CO background as a function of velocity allows us to directly\nmeasure the %absorbing dust temperature. The dust opacity can then be derived\nfrom the emitted continuum radiation. The dust disk absorbs the radiation from\nthe CO clouds at several velocities. We derive very low dust temperatures, 5 to\n7 K at radii around 100 au, which is much lower than most model predictions.\nThe dust optical depth is $> 0.2$ at 230 GHz, and the scale height at 100 au is\nat least 8 au (best fit 13 au). However, the dust disk is very flat (flaring\nindex -0.35), which is indicative of dust settling in the outer parts.\n", "  We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStar\nGalaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have on\nstar-formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio,\nX-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep $K_{s}$-band\nimaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multi-wavelength data. From this, we\nconstruct a mass-complete (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\\odot}$) $\\ge$ 9.75), AGN luminosity\nlimited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U\n- V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of the\nAGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ\ndiagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent\ngalaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using\n160{\\mu}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate of\nAGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34$\\pm$0.07 dex with respect to the control\nsample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by\ninfrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much\nas a factor of ~5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray\nAGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a\nmarginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and\npostulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating\ngalaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.\n", "  Gluon mass generation is investigated for 4-dimensional $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills in\nconventional covariant and in background field gauges within an effective\ndescription that, through a parameterization, can be regarded as a massive\ngluon model, or as a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like expansion around a massive leading\norder while preserving the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. We employ a renormalization\nscheme that introduces the ratio of the gluon mass parameter $m$ to the\nsaturation value of the gluon propagator. This, along with the mass $m(\\mu)$\nand the strong coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$, provided the fit parameters for\ncomparison with $SU(3)$ lattice results renormalized at the scale $\\mu$. We\nobtain two types of solutions with satisfactory fits. Within the proposed\nexpansion, we show the conditions under which it is possible to obtain an\nexactly vanishing longitudinal self energy for any gauge parameter $\\xi$ in the\nbackground field case. However, such a result in conventional covariant gauges\nis unattainable by the given expansion as it is, indicating that more\nsophisticated versions with dressed vertices are likely necessary. We argue\nthat the conditions under which transversality takes place are consistent with\nSchwinger-Dyson results for the ghost dressing function also.\n", "  In October 1997, radio pulses from the Crab Pulsar underwent abnormal delay.\nThis was reported by two radio observatories, both of which explained this\nfrequency dependent and time varying delay as being due to refractive effects\nof ionized shells in the Crab Nebula. Both groups also noted that, curiously\nand confusingly coincident with the frequency dependent delay, the Crab Pulsar\nalso underwent an unusual slowing down, which they believed to be unrelated to\nthe Crab Nebula and instead intrinsic to the Crab Pulsar, resulting in an\nadditional delay that was frequency independent. However, it now appears that\none of the groups attributes the frequency independent delay also to refractive\neffects. This work aims to verify whether at least a part of the frequency\nindependent delay is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab Pulsar.\nTiming analysis of the Crab Pulsar's October 1997 event has been done in\nX-rays, which are not delayed by the refractive and diffractive effects that\naffect radio waves; at X-rays only the intrinsic slowing down should contribute\nto any observed delay. Data mainly from the PCA instrument aboard the RXTE\nsatellite have been used, along with a small amount of data from the PDS\ninstrument aboard the BeppoSAX satellite. Analysis of the X-ray data, using the\nvery accurate reference timing mode derived at radio frequencies, strongly\nsupports the intrinsic slowing down hypothesis. Analysis using the reference\ntiming model derived self-consistently from the limited X-ray data, which is\nless accurate, is not completely unambiguous regarding the above two\nhypotheses, but provides reasonable support for the intrinsic slowing down\nhypothesis. A significant fraction of the frequency independent delay during\nthe October 1997 event is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab\nPulsar.\n", "  We demonstrate a simplification of some recent works on the classification of\nthe Lie symmetries for a quadratic equation of Li\\'{e}nard type. We observe\nthat the problem could have been resolved more simply.\n", "  Following on from the second release of calibrated photometry from IPHAS, the\nINT/WFC Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane, we present\nincompleteness-corrected stellar density maps in the r and i photometric bands.\nThese have been computed to a range of limiting magnitudes reaching to 20th\nmagnitude in r and 19th in i (Vega system), and with different angular\nresolutions -- the highest resolution available being 1 square arcminute. The\nmaps obtained cover 94 percent of the 1800 square-degree IPHAS footprint,\nspanning the Galactic latitude range, -5{\\deg} < b < +5{\\deg}, north of the\ncelestial equator. The corrections for incompleteness, due to confusion and\nsensitivity loss at the faint limit, have been deduced by the method of\nartificial source injection. The presentation of this method is preceded by a\ndiscussion of other more approximate methods of determining completeness. Our\nmethod takes full account of position-dependent seeing and source ellipticity\nin the survey database. The application of the star counts to testing reddened\nGalactic disc models is previewed by a comparison with predicted counts along\nthree constant-longitude cuts at l $\\simeq$ 30{\\deg}, 90{\\deg} and 175{\\deg}:\nsome over-prediction of the most heavily reddened l $\\simeq$ 30{\\deg} counts is\nfound, alongside good agreement at l $\\simeq$ 90{\\deg} and 175{\\deg}.\n", "  We study the interband transport in a superconducting device composed of\ngraphene with EuO-induced exchange interaction. We show that pure crossed\nAndreev reflection can be generated exclusively without the parasitic local\nAndreev reflection and elastic cotunnelling over a wide range of bias and Fermi\nlevels in an EuO-graphene/superconductor/EuO-graphene device. The pure\nnon-local conductance exhibits rapid on/off switching and oscillatory behavior\nwhen the Fermi levels in the normal and the superconducting leads are varied.\nThe oscillation reflects the quasiparticle propagation in the superconducting\nlead and can be used as a tool to probe the subgap quasiparticle mode in\nsuperconducting graphene, which is inaccessible from the current-voltage\ncharacteristics. Our results suggest that the device can be used as a highly\ntunable transistor that operates purely in the non-local and spin-polarized\ntransport regime.\n", "  We present a temporal analysis of a BeppoSAX observation of GRS 1915+105\nperformed on April 13, 1999 when the source was in the rho class, which is\ncharacterised by quasi-regular bursting activity. The aim of the present work\nis to confirm and extend the validity of the results obtained with a BeppoSAX\nobservation performed on October 2000 on the recurrence time of the burst and\non the hard X-ray delay. We divided the entire data set into several series,\neach corresponding to a satellite orbit, and performed the Fourier and wavelet\nanalysis and the limit cycle mapping technique using the count rate and the\naverage energy as independent variables. We found that the count rates\ncorrelate with the recurrence time of bursts and with hard X-ray delay,\nconfirming the results previously obtained. In this observation, however, the\nrecurrence times are distributed along two parallel branches with a constant\ndifference of 5.2+/-0.5 s.\n", "  Ice discs were released at the surface of a thermalized aluminium plate. The\nfusion of the ice creates a lubrication film between the ice disc and the\nplate. The disc becomes very mobile. The situation is isomorphe to the\nLeidenfrost effect reported for liquid droplet evaporating at the surface of a\nplate which temperature is over the boiling temperature of the liquid. For the\nice discs, we observe that, while the ice discs were melting, they were\nrotating. The ice disc rotates starts rotating. The rotation speed increases\nwith the temperature of the plate and with the load put on the ice disc. A\nmodel is proposed to explain the spontaneous rotation of the ice disc. We claim\nthat the rotation is due to the viscous entrainment of the ice disc by the\nliquid that flows around the ice disc.\n", "  A previous work of ours found the best agreement between EUV light curves\nobserved in an active region core (with evidence of super-hot plasma) and those\npredicted from a model with a random combination of many pulse-heated strands\nwith a power-law energy distribution. We extend that work by including\nspatially resolved strand modeling and by studying the evolution of emission\nalong the loops in the EUV 94 A and 335 A channels of the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Using the best parameters of\nthe previous work as the input of the present one, we find that the amplitude\nof the random fluctuations driven by the random heat pulses increases from the\nbottom to the top of the loop in the 94 A channel and, viceversa, from the top\nto the bottom in the 335 A channel. This prediction is confirmed by the\nobservation of a set of aligned neighbouring pixels along a bright arc of an\nactive region core. Maps of pixel fluctuations may therefore provide easy\ndiagnostics of nano-flaring regions.\n", "  The question of gauge-covariance in the non-Abelian gauge-field formulation\nof two space-dimensional systems with spin-orbit coupling relevant to\nspintronics is investigated. Although, these are generally gauge-fixed models,\nit is found that for the class of gauge fields that are space-time independent\nand satisfy a U(1) algebra, thus having a vanishing field strength, there is a\nresidual gauge freedom in the Hamiltonian. The gauge transformations assume the\nform of a space-dependent rotation of the transformed wave functions with\nrotation angles and axes determined by the specific form of the gauge-field,\ni.e., the spin-orbit coupling. The fields can be gauged away, reducing the\nHamiltonian to one which is isospectral to the free-particle Hamiltonian, and\ngiving rise to the phenomenon of persistent spin helix reported first by\nB.~A.~Bernevig \\emph{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~Lett. \\textbf{97}, 236601 (2006)]. The\ninvestigation of the global gauge transformations leads to the derivation of a\ncontinuity equation where the component of the spin-density along given\ndirections, again fixed by the specific form of the gauge field, is conserved.\n", "  The interaction of carbon monoxide molecules with atomic-scale platinum\nnanojunctions is investigated by low temperature mechanically controllable\nbreak junction experiments. Combining plateaus' length analysis, two\ndimensional conductance-displacement histograms and conditional correlation\nanalysis a comprehensive microscopic picture is proposed about the formation\nand evolution of Pt-CO-Pt single-molecule configurations. Our analysis implies\nthat before pure Pt monoatomic chains would be formed a CO molecule infiltrates\nthe junction, first in a configuration being perpendicular to the contact axis.\nThis molecular junction is strong enough to pull a monoatomic platinum chain\nwith the molecule being incorporated in the chain. Along the chain formation\nthe molecule can either stay in the perpendicular configuration, or rotate to a\nparallel configuration. The evolution of the single-molecule configurations\nalong the junction displacement shows quantitative agreement with theoretical\npredictions, justifying the interpretation in terms of perpendicular and\nparallel molecular alignment. Our analysis demonstrates that the combination of\ntwo dimensional conductance-displacement histograms with conditional\ncorrelation analysis is a useful tool to separately analyze fundamentally\ndifferent types of junction trajectories in single molecule break junction\nexperiments.\n", "  We present first results from the KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey\n(KROSS), an ongoing large kinematical survey of a thousand, z~1 star forming\ngalaxies, with VLT KMOS. Out of the targeted galaxies (~500 so far), we detect\nand spatially resolve Ha emission in ~90% and 77% of the sample respectively.\nBased on the integrated Ha flux measurements and the spatially resolved maps we\nderive a median star formation rate (SFR) of ~7.0 Msun/yr and a median physical\nsize of <r$_{\\rm e}$> = 5.1kpc. We combine the inferred SFRs and effective\nradii measurements to derive the star formation surface densities ({\\Sigma}SFR)\nand present a \"resolved\" version of the star formation main sequence (MS) that\nappears to hold at sub-galactic scales, with similar slope and scatter as the\none inferred from galaxy integrated properties. Our data also yield a trend\nbetween {\\Sigma}SFR and {\\Delta}(sSFR) (distance from the MS) suggesting that\ngalaxies with higher sSFR are characterised by denser star formation activity.\nSimilarly, we find evidence for an anti-correlation between the gas phase\nmetallicity (Z) and the {\\Delta}(sSFR), suggesting a 0.2dex variation in the\nmetal content of galaxies within the MS and significantly lower metallicities\nfor galaxies above it. The origin of the observed trends between {\\Sigma}SFR -\n{\\Sigma}(sSFR) and Z - {\\Delta}(sSFR) could be driven by an interplay between\nvariations of the gas fraction or the star formation efficiency of the galaxies\nalong and off the MS. To address this, follow-up observations of the our sample\nthat will allow gas mass estimates are necessary.\n", "  We derive the extended Supersymmetric Galilean Conformal Algebra (SGCA) in\ntwo spacetime dimensions by the method of group contraction on $2d$\n$\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ superconformal algebra. Both the parent and daughter\nalgebras are infinite-dimensional. We provide the representation theory of the\nalgebra. We adopt a superspace formalism for the SGCA fields, allowing us to\nwrite them down in a compact notation as components of superfields. We also\ndiscuss correlation functions, short supermultiplets and null states.\n", "  We design, fabricate, and experimentally demonstrate a compact thermo-optic\ngate switch comprising a 3.78 um-long coupled L0-type photonic\ncrystalmicrocavities on a silicon-on-insulator substrate. A nanohole is\ninserted in the center of each individual L0 photonic crystalmicrocavity.\nCoupling between identical microcavities gives rise to bonding and anti-bonding\nstates of the coupled photonic molecules. The coupled photonic\ncrystalmicrocavities are numerically simulated and experimentally verified with\na 6 nm-wide flat-bottom resonance in its transmission spectrum, which enables\nwider operational spectrum range than microring resonators. An integrated\nmicro-heater is in direct contact with the silicon core to efficiently drive\nthe device. The thermo-optic switch is measured with an optical extinction\nratio of 20 dB, an on-off switching power of 18.2 mW, a thermo-optic tuning\nefficiency of 0.63 nm/mW, a rise time of 14.8 us, and a fall time of 18.5 us.\nThe measured on-chip loss on the transmission band is as low as 1 dB.\n", "  The behaviors of barrier characteristics and fusion cross sections are\nanalyzed by changing neutron over wide range of colliding systems. For this\npurpose, we have extended our previous study (Eur. Phys. J. A \\textbf{48}, 21\n(2012), it is devoted to the colliding systems with neutron-rich nuclei) to 125\nisotopic systems with condition of $0.5\\leq N/Z \\leq 1.6$ for their compound\nnuclei. The AW 95, Bass 80, Denisov DP and Prox. 2010 potentials are used to\ncalculate the nuclear part of interacting potential. The obtained results show\nthat the trend of barrier heights $V_B$ and positions $R_B$ as well as nuclear\n$V_N$ and Coulomb $V_C$ potentials (at $R=R_B$) as a function of ($N/Z-1$)\nquantity are non-linear (second-order) whereas the fusion cross sections follow\na linear-dependence.\n", "  The recently discovered (Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_x}$)OHFeSe superconductor with\n$T_c$ about 40K provides a good platform for investigating the magnetization\nand electrical transport properties of FeSe-based superconductors. By using a\nhydrothermal ion-exchange method, we have successfully grown crystals of\n(Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_x}$)OHFeSe. X-ray diffraction on the sample shows the single\ncrystalline PbO-type structure with the c-axis preferential orientation.\nMagnetic susceptibility and resistive measurements show an onset\nsuperconducting transition at around ${T_c}$=38.3K. Using the magnetization\nhysteresis loops and Bean critical state model, a large critical current\n${J_s}$ is observed in low temperature region. The critical current density is\nsuppressed exponentially with increasing magnetic field. Temperature\ndependencies of resistivity under various currents and fields are measured,\nrevealing a robust superconducting current density and bulk superconductivity.\n", "  In this work the existence of periodic solutions is studied for the\nHamiltonian functions (Formula presented.) where the first term consist of a\nharmonic oscillator and the second term are homogeneous polynomials of degree 5\ndefined by two real parameters (Formula presented.) . Using the averaging\nmethod of second order we provide the sufficient conditions on the parameters\nto guarantee the existence of periodic solutions for positive energy and we\nstudy the stability of these periodic solutions.\n", "  A brief overview of some open questions in general relativity with important\nconsequences for causality theory is presented, aiming to a better\nunderstanding of the causal structure of the spacetime. Special attention is\naccorded to the problem of fundamental causal stability conditions. Several\nquestions are raised and some of the potential consequences of recent results\nregarding the causality problem in general relativity are presented. A key\nquestion is whether causality violating regions are locally allowed. The new\nconcept of almost stable causality is introduced; meanwhile, related conditions\nand criteria for the stability and almost stability of the causal structure are\ndiscussed.\n", "  There are recent investigations regarding tandem solar cells with a top\nperovskite cell and a bottom silicon one with a potential of > 25% power\nconversion efficiency. Because of still high production costs of silicon cells\nit is believed that this tandem cell does not satisfy future requirements. Here\nthe construction of a low-cost FAPbI3 twin solar cell is proposed with assumed\nPCE of 30%. With an ingenious rear illumination even 50% bifacial power\nconversion efficiency should be feasible. Importantly, a single twin cell can\ndeliver the minimum potential difference of 1.7 V to conduct water splitting in\npractice. Avoiding additional electrodes, the twin cell device may be expanded\nby a large band gap sensitizer film at the mirror plan, derived from known\nelectrically isolating phosphor storage materials that can capture otherwise\nwasted high-energetic radiation. Further, the substitution ot TiO2 (rutile) by\nferroelectric and photo-catalytically active Bi2SiO5 with its comparable energy\ngap is sugested. CuO1-x could serve as new back electrode material due to its\nhigh electric conductivity. In addition, an environmentally benign\n(Cs,FA)2(Na,Cu,Ag)Bi(I,Br)6 elpasolite solar absorber material is discussed.\nAlternatively, pyroelectric hexagonal bismuth sulfide iodide with its complex\nsuperstructure may deliver a promising multiple band gap feature with suggested\nsinglet fission capability as intrinsic property to overcome its lower\nefficiency.\n", "  The origin of Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in external galaxies whose\nX-ray luminosities exceed those of the brightest black holes in our Galaxy by\nhundreds and thousands of times is mysterious. The most popular models for the\nULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black\nholes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties,\ntheir X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks\nsupposing the supercritical accretion. However, the strongest evidences come\nfrom optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX counterparts are very similar\nto that of SS 433, the only known supercritical accretor in our Galaxy.\n", "  We investigate the dissociation of $H_2^+$ into a proton and a $H^0$ after\nsingle ionization with photons of an energy close to the threshold. We find\nthat the $p^+$ and the $H^0$ do not emerge symmetrically in case of the $H_2^+$\ndissociating along the $1s\\sigma_g$ ground state. Instead, a preference for the\nejection of the $p^+$ in the direction of the escaping photoelectron can be\nobserved. This symmetry breaking is strongest for very small electron energies.\nOur experiment is consistent with a recent prediction by Serov and Kheifets\n[Phys. Rev. A 89, 031402 (2014)]. In their model, which treats the\nphotoelectron classically, the symmetry breaking is induced by the retroaction\nof the long range Coulomb potential onto the dissociating $H_2^+$.\n", "  We theoretically and numerically investigate the generation of\nfractional-charge vortex dipoles in spinor condensates with non-zero\nmagnetization. We find that in the antiferromagnetic phase of spin-1 and spin-2\nand the cyclic phase of spin-2 condensate with non-zero magnetization coupling\nof the density (phonon) and a spin-excitation mode results in two critical\nspeeds for vortex-antivortex pair creation in the condensate. As a result, a\nGaussian obstacle potential moving across the antiferromagnetic spin-1 or\nspin-2 and cyclic spin-2 spinor condensates with non-zero magnetization can\nlead to the creation of fractional-charge vortex dipoles. On the other hand,\nfor zero magnetization, the two modes get decoupled, which is illustrated by a\nsingle critical speed for vortex-antivortex pair creation in the condensate due\nto the phonon excitation mode.\n", "  I expand on some ideas from my recent review \"String theory to the rescue,\" I\ndiscuss my use of Bayesian reasoning. I argue that it can be useful but that it\nis very far from the central point of the discussion. I then review my own\npersonal history with the multiverse. Finally I respond to some of the\ncriticisms of Ellis and Silk, which initiated this interesting discussion.\n", "  The problem of understanding how a coherent, macroscopic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) emerges from the cooling of a thermal Bose gas has attracted\nsignificant theoretical and experimental interest over several decades. The\npioneering achievement of BEC in weakly-interacting dilute atomic gases in 1995\nwas followed by a number of experimental studies examining the growth of the\nBEC number, as well as the development of its coherence. More recently there\nhas been interest in connecting such experiments to universal aspects of\nnonequilibrium phase transitions, in terms of both static and dynamical\ncritical exponents. Here, the spontaneous formation of topological structures\nsuch as vortices and solitons in quenched cold-atom experiments has enabled the\nverification of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicting the density of\ntopological defects in continuous phase transitions, first proposed in the\ncontext of the evolution of the early universe. This chapter reviews progress\nin the understanding of BEC formation, and discusses open questions and future\nresearch directions in the dynamics of phase transitions in quantum gases.\n", "  For a large number of real nonlinear equations, either continuous or\ndiscrete, integrable or nonintegrable, uncoupled or coupled, we show that\nwhenever a real nonlinear equation admits kink solutions in terms of $\\tanh\n\\beta x$, where $\\beta$ is the inverse of the kink width, it also admits\nsolutions in terms of the PT-invariant combinations $\\tanh 2\\beta x \\pm i \\sech\n2 \\beta x$, i.e. the kink width is reduced by half to that of the real kink\nsolution. We show that both the kink and the PT-invariant kink are linearly\nstable and obtain expressions for the zero mode in the case of several\nPT-invariant kink solutions. Further, for a number of real nonlinear equations\nwe show that whenever a nonlinear equation admits periodic kink solutions in\nterms of $\\sn(x,m)$, it also admits periodic solutions in terms of the\nPT-invariant combinations $\\sn(x,m) \\pm i \\cn(x,m)$ as well as $\\sn(x,m)\\pm i\n\\dn(x,m)$. Finally, for coupled equations we show that one cannot only have\ncomplex PT-invariant solutions with PT eigenvalue $+1$ or $-1$ in both the\nfields but one can also have solutions with PT eigenvalue $+1$ in one field and\n$-1$ in the other field.\n", "  Over the last two decades, many unexpected relations between exotic\nsmoothness, e.g. exotic $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$, and quantum field theory were found.\nSome of these relations are rooted in a relation to superstring theory and\nquantum gravity. Therefore one would expect that exotic smoothness is directly\nrelated to the quantization of general relativity. In this article we will\nsupport this conjecture and develop a new approach to quantum gravity called\n\\emph{smooth quantum gravity} by using smooth 4-manifolds with an exotic\nsmoothness structure. In particular we discuss the appearance of a wildly\nembedded 3-manifold which we identify with a quantum state. Furthermore, we\nanalyze this quantum state by using foliation theory and relate it to an\nelement in an operator algebra. Then we describe a set of geometric,\nnon-commutative operators, the skein algebra, which can be used to determine\nthe geometry of a 3-manifold. This operator algebra can be understood as a\ndeformation quantization of the classical Poisson algebra of observables given\nby holonomies. The structure of this operator algebra induces an action by\nusing the quantized calculus of Connes. The scaling behavior of this action is\nanalyzed to obtain the classical theory of General Relativity (GRT) for large\nscales. This approach has some obvious properties: there are non-linear\ngravitons, a connection to lattice gauge field theory and a dimensional\nreduction from 4D to 2D. Some cosmological consequences like the appearance of\nan inflationary phase are also discussed. At the end we will get the simple\npicture that the change from the standard $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ to the exotic\n$R^{4}$ is a quantization of geometry.\n", "  Let V be the even part of the vertex operator super-algebra of r pairs of\nsymplectic fermions. Up to two conjectures, we show that V admits a unique\nholomorphic extension if r is a multiple of 8, and no holomorphic extension\notherwise.\n  This is implied by two results obtained in this paper: 1) If r is a multiple\nof 8, one possible holomorphic extension is given by the lattice vertex\noperator algebra for the even self dual lattice $D_r^+$ with shifted stress\ntensor. 2) We classify Lagrangian algebras in SF(h), a ribbon category\nassociated to symplectic fermions.\n  The classification of holomorphic extensions of V follows from 1) and 2) if\none assumes that SF(h) is ribbon equivalent to Rep(V), and that simple modules\nof extensions of V are in one-to-one relation with simple local modules of the\ncorresponding commutative algebra in SF(h).\n", "  We present the crystal structures and magnetic properties of RE3Sb3Mg2O14\n(La3Sb3Mg2O14, Pr3Sb3Mg2O14, Sm3Sb3Mg2O14, Eu3Sb3Mg2O14, Tb3Sb3Mg2O14, and\nHo3Sb3Mg2O14), a family of novel materials based on a perfect geometry 2D rare\nearth Kagome lattice. Structure refinements were performed by the Rietveld\nmethod using X-ray diffraction data, indicating that the layered compounds are\nfully structurally ordered. The compounds crystallize in a rhombohedral\nsupercell of the cubic pyrochlore structure, in the space group R-3m. As\nindicated by magnetic susceptibility measurements, they exhibit predominantly\nantiferromagnetic interactions between rare earth moments. Except for possibly\nPr3Sb3Mg2O14 and Eu3Sb3Mg2O14, none of the compounds show any signs of magnetic\nordering above 2 K. This RE3Sb3Mg2O14 family of compounds is similar to that of\nRE3Sb3Zn2O14, except the series reported here features a fully ordered\ndistribution of cations in both the nonmagnetic antimony and magnesium sites\nand the magnetic rare earth kagome sites. The compounds appear to be relatively\ndefect-free and are therefore model systems for investigating magnetic\nfrustration on an ideal 2D rare earth Kagome lattice.\n", "  We consider a spherically symmetric stationary problem in General Relativity,\nincluding a black hole, inflow of normal and tachyonic matter and outflow of\ntachyonic matter. Computations in a weak field limit show that the resulting\nconcentration of matter around the black hole leads to gravitational effects\nequivalent to those associated with dark matter halo. In particular, the model\nreproduces asymptotically constant galactic rotation curves, if the tachyonic\nflows of the central supermassive black hole in the galaxy are considered as a\nmain contribution.\n", "  Synthetic perovskites with photovoltaic properties open a new era in solar\nphotovoltaics. Due to high optical absorption perovskite-based thin-film solar\ncells are usually considered as fully absorbing solar radiation on condition of\nideal blooming. However, is it really so? The analysis of the literature data\nhas shown that the absorbance of all photovoltaic pervoskites has the spectral\nhole at infrared frequencies where the solar radiation spectrum has a small\nlocal peak. This absorption dip results in the decrease of the optical\nefficiency of thin-film pervoskite solar cells by nearly 3% and close the ways\nof utilise them at this range for any other applications. In our work we show\nthat to cure this shortage is possible complementing the basic structure by an\ninexpensive plasmonic array.\n", "  We determine the operator limit for large powers of random tridiagonal\nmatrices as the size of the matrix grows. The result provides a novel\nexpression in terms of functionals of Brownian motions for the Laplace\ntransform of the Airy$_\\beta$ process, which describes the largest eigenvalues\nin the $\\beta$ ensembles of random matrix theory. Another consequence is a\nFeynman-Kac formula for the stochastic Airy operator of Ram\\'{i}rez, Rider, and\nVir\\'{a}g. As a side result, we find that the difference between the area\nunderneath a standard Brownian excursion and one half of the integral of its\nsquared local times is a Gaussian random variable.\n", "  This Habilitationsschrift (Habilitation thesis) is focused on my research\nactivities on medical applications of particle physics and was written in 2013\nto obtain the Venia Docendi (Habilitation) in experimental physics at the\nUniversity of Bern. It is based on selected publications, which represented at\nthat time my major scientific contributions as an experimental physicist to the\nfield of particle accelerators and detectors applied to medical diagnostics and\ntherapy. The thesis is structured in two parts. In Part I, Chapter 1 presents\nan introduction to accelerators and detectors applied to medicine, with\nparticular focus on cancer hadrontherapy and on the production of radioactive\nisotopes. In Chapter 2, my publications on medical particle accelerators are\nintroduced and put into their perspective. In particular, high frequency linear\naccelerators for hadrontherapy are discussed together with the new Bern\ncyclotron laboratory. Chapter 3 is dedicated to particle detectors with\nparticular emphasis on three instruments I contributed to propose and develop:\nsegmented ionization chambers for hadrontherapy, a proton radiography apparatus\nwith nuclear emulsion films, and a beam monitor detector for ion beams based on\ndoped silica fibres. Selected research and review papers are contained in Part\nII. For copyright reasons, they are only listed and not reprinted in this\non-line version. They are available on the websites of the journals.\n", "  A coupled BBM system of equations is studied in the situation of water waves\npropagating over decreasing fluid depth. A conservation equation for mass and a\nwave breaking criterion valid in the Boussinesq approximation is found. A\nFourier collocation method coupled with a 4-stage Runge-Kutta time integration\nscheme is employed to approximate solutions of the BBM system. The mass\nconservation equation is used to quantify the role of reflection in the\nshoaling of solitary waves on a sloping bottom. Shoaling results based on an\nadiabatic approximation are analyzed. Wave shoaling and the criterion of\nbreaking solitary waves on a sloping bottom is studied. To validate the\nnumerical model the simulation results are compared with those obtained by\nGrilli et al.[16] and a good agreement between them is observed. Shoaling of\nsolitary waves of two different types of mild slope model systems in [8] and\n[13] are compared, and it is found that each of these models works well in\ntheir respective regimes of applicability.\n", "  The electrical conductivity of melts of boron and its carbide (B4C), nitride\n(BN), and phosphide (BP) has been studied at pressures to 7.7 GPa and\ntemperatures to 3500 K. It has been shown that these melts are good conductors\nwith specific electrical conductivity values comparable with that of iron melt\nat ambient pressure.\n", "  In this work we present a modeling tool designed to estimate the hysteretic\nlosses in the coils of an electric generator with coils made of coated\nconductor tapes during transient operation. The model is based on a two-stage\nsegregated model approach that allows simulating the electric generator and the\ncurrent distribution in the superconducting coils using a one-way coupling from\nthe generator to the HTS coils model. The model has two inputs: the rotational\nspeed and the electric load signal. A homogeneous anisotropic bulk model for\nthe coils allows computing the current distribution in the coils. From this\ndistribution, the hysteretic losses are estimated. Beyond the interest on\nproviding an estimate on the global energy dissipation in the machine, in this\nwork we present a more detailed local analysis that allows addressing issues\nsuch as coil design, critical current ratting, electric load change rate\nlimits, cryocooler design, identification of quench-prone regions and overall\ntransient performance.\n", "  The entire process of atomization of the fuel in an internal combustion\nengine plays a very important role in determining the overall efficiency of\nthese engines. A good atomization process could help the fuel to mix with the\nair properly leading to its efficient combustion, thereby reducing the emitted\npollutants as well. The recent trend followed by the engineers focused on\ndesigning fuel injectors for more efficient atomization is to increase the\natomization pressure while decreasing the nozzle orifice diameter. A\nconsequence of this is the development of cavitation (formation of vapor\ncavities or bubbles in the liquid) inside the injector close to the nozzle. The\nmain reason behind this is the sudden changes in the pressure inside the\ninjector and these cavities or bubbles are usually formed where the pressure is\nrelatively low.This work mainly focuses on studying the formation of cavitation\nand its effect on the velocity of the spray in the near nozzle region using\nasymmetrical transparent nozzle equipped with a needle lift sensor with nozzle\ndiameter of 0.35 mm at 300 bar of injection pressure. The experiment consists\nin recording of several image-pairs, which are separated by about 300 ns,\ncapturing the dynamics of the spray, a few millimeters from the nozzle in the\ndirection of the flow. These image-pairs are then used to compute the velocity\nfrom the displacement of the liquid structures and ligaments by correlating the\nfirst image with the second. About 200 of such velocity graphs are then\naveraged to obtain a velocity map and is compared with the similar average\nvelocity maps obtained at different times from the start of the injection. The\nangular spread of the spray from each of these images is calculated as well.\nThe images showing cavitation inside the injector are also recorded at these\nsame instants of time so as to understand the effects of cavitation on the\nvelocity and angular spread of the spray close to the nozzle.\n", "  We present some of the recent results and open questions on the causality\nproblem in General Relativity. The concept of singularity is intimately\nconnected with future trapped surface and inner event horizon formation. We\noffer a brief overview of the Hawking Penrose singularity theorems and discuss\na few open problems concerning the future Cauchy development (domain of\ndependence), breakdown criteria and energy conditions for the horizon\nstability. A key question is whether causality violating regions, generating a\nCauchy horizon are allowed.\n  We raise several questions concerning the invisibility and stability of\nclosed trapped surfaces from future null infinity and derive the imprisonment\nconditions. We provide an new perspective of the causal boundaries and\nspacelike conformal boundary extensions for time oriented Lorentzian manifolds\nand more exotic settings.\n", "  We have investigated the polarization of attosecond light bursts generated by\nnanobunches of electrons from relativistic few-cycle laser pulse interaction\nwith the surface of overdense plasmas. Particle-in-cell simulation shows that\nthe polarization state of the generated attosecond burst depends on the\nincident-pulse polarization, duration, carrier envelope phase, as well as the\nplasma scale length. Through laser and plasma parameter control, without\ncompromise of generation efficiency, a linearly polarized laser pulse with\nazimuth $\\theta^i=10^\\circ$ can generate an elliptically polarized attosecond\nburst with azimuth $|\\theta^r_{\\rm atto}|\\approx61^\\circ$ and ellipticity\n$\\sigma^r_{\\rm atto}\\approx0.27$; while an elliptically polarized laser pulse\nwith $\\sigma^i\\approx0.36$ can generate an almost circularly polarized\nattosecond burst with $\\sigma^r_{\\rm atto}\\approx0.95$. The results propose a\nnew way to a table-top circularly polarized XUV source as a probe with\nattosecond scale time resolution for many advanced applications.\n", "  $^{20}$Ne has been known as a typical example of a nucleus with $\\alpha$\ncluster structure ($^{16}$O+$\\alpha$ structure). However according to the\nspherical shell model, the spin-orbit interaction acts attractively for four\nnucleons outside of the $^{16}$O core, and this spin-orbit effect cannot be\ntaken into account in the simple $\\alpha$ cluster models. We investigate how\nthe $\\alpha$ cluster structure competes with independent particle motions of\nthese four nucleons. The antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM) is a method\nto describe a transition from the $\\alpha$ cluster wave function to the\n$jj$-coupling shell model wave function. In this model, the cluster-shell\ntransition is characterized by only two parameters; $R$ representing the\ndistance between clusters and $\\Lambda$ describing the breaking of $\\alpha$\nclusters, and the contribution of the spin-orbit interaction, very important in\nthe $jj$-coupling shell model, can be taken into account by changing $\\alpha$\nclusters to quasi clusters. In this article, based on AQCM, we apply $^{16}$O\nplus one quasi cluster model for $^{20}$Ne. Here we focus on the $E0$\ntransition matrix element, which has been known as the quantity characterizing\nthe cluster structure. The $E0$ transition matrix elements are sensitive to the\nchange of the wave functions from $\\alpha$ cluster to $jj$-coupling shell\nmodel.\n", "  This paper studies hidden oscillations appearing in electromechanical systems\nwith and without equilibria. Three different systems with such effects are\nconsidered: translational oscillator-rotational actuator, drilling system\nactuated by a DC-motor and drilling system actuated by induction motor. We\ndemonstrate that all three systems experience hidden oscillations in sense of\nmathematical definition. But from physical point of view in certain cases it is\nquite easy to localize there oscillations.\n", "  We obtained an optical-to-terahertz (THz) energy conversion efficiency of\n0.5% using the tilted-pulse-front technique in lithium niobate at a\ncryogenically cooled temperature of 100 K pumped by amplified Ti:sapphire laser\npulses with ~150 fs pulse duration at 800 nm wavelength. Compared with the\noptimized conversion efficiency of 0.18% achieved at room temperature, we\nachieved more than 2.5 times enhancement in conversion efficiency upon\ncryogenically cooling the crystal due to reduction of THz absorption. Further\nimprovements to the conversion efficiency can be made by optimizing the\nout-coupling of the THz radiation, transportation of pump energy and by further\ndecreasing the THz absorption in the lithium niobate crystal.\n", "  This paper studies a Boltzmann-Nordheim equation in a slab with\ntwo-dimensional velocity space and pseudo-Maxwellian forces. Strong solutions\nare obtained for the Cauchy problem with large initial data in an $ L^1 \\cap\nL^{\\infty} $ setting. The main results are existence, uniqueness, and stability\nof solutions conserving mass, momentum, and energy. The solutions either\nexplode in the $ L^\\infty$-norm in finite time, or exist globally in time. They\nare obtained as limits of solutions to corresponding anyon equations.\n", "  We discuss the recent progress in neutrino physics in the following fields:\n(i) interpretation of the short and long neutrino oscillation data in terms of\nneutrino flavor transitions; (ii) models for neutrino masses and mixings.\n", "  The dark matter and dark energy problem, that is now dominating the research\nin cosmology, makes the question of the origin of mass-energy content of the\nuniverse more urgent than ever. There are two philosophies regarding this\nquestion: according to Mach's principle it is matter that generates geometry of\nspace-time, and according to Wheeler's geometrodynamics some configurations of\nspace-time geometry are to be interpreted as its material content. Neither of\nthese philosophies has led to success. In the present paper, we show that there\nexists an algebraic generalisation of geometry that reconciles, in a sense,\nthese two seemingly opposite standpoints. The geometry is constructed with the\nhelp of a noncommutative algebra of smooth functions on a groupoid and its\nderivations. The groupoid in question has a nice physical interpretation: it\ncan be regarded as a space of Lorentz rotations. In this way, Lorentz\nsymmetries are inherent to the generalised geometry of space-time. We define\nthe action for this geometry and, by varying it, obtain generalised vacuum\nEinstein equations (for a simplified model). It turns out that these equations\ncontain additional terms (with respect to the standard vacuum Einstein\nequations) which are naturally interpreted as the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Matter is thus created out of purely geometric degrees\nof freedom. We find two exact solutions (for even more simplified case). We\nargue that the creation of matter, being a global effect, makes the contrast\nbetween Mach and Wheeler philosophies ineffective.\n", "  Boiling crisis experiments are carried out in the vicinity of the liquid-gas\ncritical point of H2. A magnetic gravity compensation setup is used to enable\nnucleate boiling at near critical pressure. The measurements of the critical\nheat flux that defines the threshold for the boiling crisis are carried out as\na function of the distance from the critical point. The obtained power law\nbehavior and the boiling crisis dynamics agree with the predictions of the\nvapor recoil mechanism and disagree with the classical vapor column mechanism.\n", "  We propose an equation that describes the shape of the driven contact line in\ndynamics in the presence of an arbitrary (possibly random) distribution of the\nsurface defects. It is shown that the triple contact line depinning differs\nfrom the depinning of interfaces separating two phases; the equations\ndescribing these phenomena have an essential difference. The force--velocity\ndependence is considered for a periodical defect pattern. It appears to be\nstrongly nonlinear both near the depinning threshold and for large contact line\nspeeds. This nonlinearity is comparable to experimental results on the contact\nline depinning from random defects.\n", "  Laser wakefield accelerators have great potential as the basis for next\ngeneration compact radiation sources because their accelerating gradients are\nthree orders of magnitude larger than traditional accelerators. However, X-ray\nradiation from such devices still lacks of tunability, especially the intensity\nand polarization distribution. Here we propose a tunable polarized radiation\nsource from a helical plasma undulator based on plasma channel guided wakefield\naccelerator. When a laser pulse is initially incident with a skew angle\nrelative to the channel axis, the laser and accelerated electrons experience\ncollective spiral motions, which leads to elliptically polarized\nsynchrotron-like radiation with flexible tunability on radiation intensity,\nspectra and polarization. We demonstrate that a radiation source with\nmillimeter size and peak brilliance of $2\\times10^{19}\nphotons/s/mm^{2}/mrad^{2}/0.1%$ bandwidth can be made with moderate laser and\nelectron beam parameters. This brilliance is comparable with the third\ngeneration of synchrotron radiation facilities running at similar photon\nenergies, suggesting that laser plasma based radiation sources are promising\nfor advanced applications.\n", "  We study a spontaneous relaxation dynamics of arbitrarily shaped liquid drops\non solid surfaces in the partial wetting regime. It is assumed that the energy\ndissipated near the contact line is much larger than that in the bulk of the\nfluid. We have shown rigorously in the case of quasi-static relaxation using\nthe standard mechanical description of dissipative system dynamics that the\nintroduction of a dissipation term proportional to the contact line length\nleads to the well known local relation between the contact line velocity and\nthe dynamic contact angle at every point of an arbitrary contact line shape. A\nnumerical code is developed for 3D drops to study the dependence of the\nrelaxation dynamics on the initial drop shape. The available asymptotic\nsolutions are tested against the obtained numerical data. We show how the\nrelaxation at a given point of the contact line is influenced by the dynamics\nof the whole drop which is a manifestation of the non-local\n", "  Boiling crisis is a transition between nucleate and film boiling. In this\ncommunication we present a physical model of the boiling crisis based on the\nvapor recoil effect. Our numerical simulations of the thermally controlled\nbubble growth at high heat fluxes show how the bubble begins to spread over the\nheater thus forming a germ for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only\ncauses the vapor spreading, it also creates a strong adhesion to the heater\nthat prevents the bubble departure, thus favoring the further bubble spreading.\nNear the liquid-gas critical point, the bubble growth is very slow and allows\nthe kinetics of the bubble spreading to be observed. Since the surface tension\nis very small in this regime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a\nconvex bubble shape. Under such conditions, we observed an increase of the\napparent contact angle and spreading of the dry spot under the bubble, thus\nconfirming our model of the boiling crisis.\n", "  We present a theoretical study related to a recent experiment on the\ncoalescence of sessile drops. The study deals with the kinetics of relaxation\ntowards equilibrium, under the action of surface tension, of a spheroidal drop\non a flat surface. For such a nonspherical drop under partial wetting\nconditions, the dynamic contact angle varies along the contact line. We propose\na new nonlocal approach to the wetting dynamics, where the contact line\nvelocity depends on the geometry of the whole drop. We compare our results to\nthose of the conventional approach in which the contact line velocity depends\nonly on the local value of the dynamic contact angle. The influence on drop\ndynamics of the pinning of the contact line by surface defects is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of\ncoalescence of two water drops on a plane solid surface. The case of partial\nwetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated\nwith water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and\ncoalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially\nand slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic\nrelaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.\nThis relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk\ncapillary relaxation time t b = R * $\\eta$/$\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the\ngas--liquid surface tension and $\\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order\nto explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that\ninvolves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase\nchange in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large\nrelaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of\nvaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late\ntime relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation\nwhose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.\nIntroduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide\nrange of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers,\nstability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998),\nwhich is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable\nattention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the\ncoalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the\nprocess before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the\nhydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when\nthe drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis\n1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops\nrelaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation\nof the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev\n\\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of\ntwo sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a\npreliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case\nof hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the\nexpense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath\nfigures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995). The drops eventually touch each\nother and coalesce to form an elongated composite\n", "  In this article we consider different methods of modeling asteroid shapes,\nespecially lightcurve inversion technique, and scattering laws used for it. We\nalso introduce our program, which constructs lightcurves for a given asteroid\nshape model. It can be used to comparing shape model with observational data.\n", "  This study deals with a simple pure fluid whose temperature is slightly below\nits critical temperature and whose density is nearly critical, so that the gas\nand liquid phases coexist. Under equilibrium conditions, such a liquid\ncompletely wets the container wall and the gas phase is always separated from\nthe solid by a wetting film. We report a striking change in the shape of the\ngas-liquid interface influenced by heating under weightlessness where the gas\nphase spreads over a hot solid surface showing an apparent contact angle larger\nthan 90{\\textdegree}. We show that the two-phase fluid is very sensitive to the\ndifferential vapor recoil force and give an explanation that uses this\nnonequilibrium effect. We also show how these experiments help to understand\nthe boiling crisis, an important technological problem in high-power boiling\nheat exchange.\n", "  Using $1.6$ fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+ e^-\\to\\phi\\to\\eta\\gamma$ data collected with\nthe KLOE detector at DA$\\Phi$NE, the Dalitz plot distribution for the $\\eta \\to\n\\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$ decay is studied with the world's largest sample of $\\sim\n4.7 \\cdot 10^6$ events. The Dalitz plot density is parametrized as a polynomial\nexpansion up to cubic terms in the normalized dimensionless variables $X$ and\n$Y$. The experiment is sensitive to all charge conjugation conserving terms of\nthe expansion, including a $gX^2Y$ term. The statistical uncertainty of all\nparameters is improved by a factor two with respect to earlier measurements.\n", "  The Ancient Egyptians wrote Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days that assigned\nastronomically influenced prognoses for each day of the year. The best\npreserved of these calendars is the Cairo Calendar (hereafter CC) dated to\n1244--1163 B.C. We have presented evidence that the 2.85 days period in the\nlucky prognoses of CC is equal to that of the eclipsing binary Algol during\nthis historical era. We wanted to find out the vocabulary that represents Algol\nin the mythological texts of CC. Here we show that Algol was represented as\nHorus and thus signified both divinity and kingship. The texts describing the\nactions of Horus are consistent with the course of events witnessed by any\nnaked eye observer of Algol. These descriptions support our claim that CC is\nthe oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star.\nThe period of the Moon, 29.6 days, has also been discovered in CC. We show that\nthe actions of Seth were connected to this period, which also strongly\nregulated the times described as lucky for Heaven and for Earth. Now, for the\nfirst time, periodicity is discovered in the descriptions of the days in CC.\nUnlike many previous attempts to uncover the reasoning behind the myths of\nindividual days, we discover the actual rules in the appearance and behaviour\nof deities during the whole year.\n", "  We have studied effects of perturbations on the cat cerebral cortex.\nAccording to the literature, this cortex structure can be described by a\nclustered network. This way, we construct a clustered network with the same\nnumber of areas as in the cat matrix, where each area is described as a\nsub-network with small-world property. We focus on the suppression of neuronal\nphase synchronisation considering different kinds of perturbations. Among the\nvarious controlling interventions, we choose three methods: delayed feedback\ncontrol, external time-periodic driving, and activation of selected neurons. We\nsimulate these interventions to provide a procedure to suppress undesired and\npathological abnormal rhythms that can be associated with many forms of\nsynchronisation. In our simulations, we have verified that the efficiency of\nsynchronisation suppression by delayed feedback control is higher than external\ntime-periodic driving and activation of selected neurons for the cat cerebral\ncortex with the same coupling strengths.\n", "  We discuss a new mechanism of drop coarsening due to coalescence only, which\ndescribes the late stages of phase separation in fluids. Depending on the\nvolume fraction of the minority phase, we identify two different regimes of\ngrowth, where the drops are interconnected and their characteristic size grows\nlinearly with time, and where the spherical drops are disconnected and the\ngrowth follows (time) 1/3. The transition between the two regimes is sharp and\noccurs at a well defined volume fraction of order 30%.\n", "  Quantum radiated energy flux emitted by an Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector, with\nthe internal harmonic oscillator coupled to a massless scalar field, in linear\noscillatory motion in (3+1) dimensional Minkowski space is studied by numerical\nmethods. Our results show that quantum interference can indeed suppress the\nsignal of the Unruh effect if the averaged proper acceleration is sufficiently\nlow, but not in the regime with high averaged acceleration and short\noscillatory cycle. While the averaged radiated energy flux over a cycle is\nalways positive as guaranteed by the quantum inequalities, an observer at a\nfixed angle may see short periods of negative radiated energy flux in each\ncycle of motion, which indicates that the radiation is squeezed. This reveals\nanother resemblance between the detector theory and the moving-mirror model.\n", "  We report a 2D modeling of the thermal diffusion-controlled growth of a vapor\nbubble attached to a heating surface during saturated boiling. The heat\nconduction problem is solved in a liquid that surrounds a bubble with a free\nboundary and in a semi-infinite solid heater by the boundary element method. At\nhigh system pressure the bubble is assumed to grow slowly, its shape being\ndefined by the surface tension and the vapor recoil force, a force coming from\nthe liquid evaporating into the bubble. It is shown that at some typical time\nthe dry spot under the bubble begins to grow rapidly under the action of the\nvapor recoil. Such a bubble can eventually spread into a vapor film that can\nseparate the liquid from the heater thus triggering the boiling crisis\n(critical heat flux).\n", "  Random search processes are instrumental in studying and understanding\nnavigation properties of complex networks, food search strategies of animals,\ndiffusion control of molecular processes in biological cells, and improving web\nsearch engines. An essential part of random search processes and their\napplications are various forms of (continuous or discrete time) random walk\nmodels. The efficiency of a random search strategy in complex networks is\nmeasured with the mean first passage time between two nodes or, more generally,\nwith the mean first passage time between two subsets of the vertex set. In this\npaper we formulate a problem of adding a set of $k$ links between the two\nsubsets of the vertex set that optimally reduce the mean first passage time\nbetween the sets. We demonstrate that the mean first passage time between two\nsets is non-increasing and supermodular set function defined over the set of\nlinks between the two sets. This allows us to use two greedy algorithms that\napproximately solve the problem and we compare their performance against\nseveral standard link prediction algorithms. We find that the proposed greedy\nalgorithms are better at choosing the links that reduce the navigation time\nbetween the two sets.\n", "  Based on a grid of hydrostatic spherical COMARCS models for cool stars we\nhave calculated observable properties of these objects, which will be mainly\nused in combination with stellar evolution tracks and population synthesis\ntools. The high resolution opacity sampling and low resolution convolved\nspectra as well as bolometric corrections for a large number of filter systems\nare made electronically available. We exploit those data to study the effect of\nmass, C/O ratio and nitrogen abundance on the photometry of K and M giants.\nDepending on effective temperature, surface gravity and the chosen wavelength\nranges variations of the investigated parameters cause very weak to moderate\nand, in the case of C/O values close to one, even strong shifts of the colours.\nFor the usage with stellar evolution calculations they will be treated as\ncorrection factors applied to the results of an interpolation in the main\nquantities. When we compare the synthetic photometry to observed relations and\nto data from the Galactic Bulge, we find in general a good agreement.\nDeviations appear for the coolest giants showing pulsations, mass loss and dust\nshells, which cannot be described by hydrostatic models.\n", "  Wavelength dependent photodesorption rates have been determined using\nsynchrotron radiation, for condensed pure and mixed methanol ice in the 7 -- 14\neV range. The VUV photodesorption of intact methanol molecules from pure\nmethanol ices is found to be of the order of 10$^{-5}$ molecules/photon, that\nis two orders of magnitude below what is generally used in astrochemical\nmodels. This rate gets even lower ($<$ 10$^{-6}$ molecules/photon) when the\nmethanol is mixed with CO molecules in the ices. This is consistent with a\npicture in which photodissociation and recombination processes are at the\norigin of intact methanol desorption from pure CH$_3$OH ices. Such low rates\nare explained by the fact that the overall photodesorption process is dominated\nby the desorption of the photofragments CO, CH$_3$, OH, H$_2$CO and\nCH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH, whose photodesorption rates are given in this study. Our\nresults suggest that the role of the photodesorption as a mechanism to explain\nthe observed gas phase abundances of methanol in cold media is probably\noverestimated. Nevertheless, the photodesorption of radicals from methanol-rich\nices may stand at the origin of the gas phase presence of radicals such as\nCH$_3$O, therefore opening new gas phase chemical routes for the formation of\ncomplex molecules.\n", "  We study the AB system describing marginally unstable baroclinic wave packets\nin geophysical fluids and also ultra-short pulses in nonlinear optics. We show\nthat the breather can be converted into different types of stationary nonlinear\nwaves on constant backgrounds, including the multi-peak soliton, M-shaped\nsoliton, W-shaped soliton and periodic wave. We also investigate the nonlinear\ninteractions between these waves, which display some novel patterns due to the\nnon-propagating characteristics of the solitons: (1) Two antidark solitons can\nproduce a W-shaped soliton instead of a higher-order antidark one, (2) The\ninteraction between an antidark soliton and a W-shaped soliton can not only\ngenerate a higher-order antidark soliton, but also form a W-shaped solion pair,\n(3) The interactions between an oscillation W-shaped soliton and an oscillation\nM-shaped soliton show the multipeak structures. We find that the transition\noccurs at a modulational stability region in a low perturbation frequency\nregion.\n", "  Using the explicit rational conformal field theory partition functions for\nthe ${\\mathbb Z}_k$ parafermion quantum Hall states on a disk we compute\nnumerically the thermoelectric power factor for Coulomb-blockaded islands at\nfinite temperature. We demonstrate that the power factor is rather sensitive to\nthe neutral degrees of freedom and could eventually be used to distinguish\nexperimentally between different quantum Hall states having identical electric\nproperties. This might help us to confirm whether non-Abelian quasiparticles,\nsuch as the Fibonacci anyons, are indeed present in the experimentally observed\nquantum Hall states.\n", "  Here we study the form of the Mattig equation applied in a cosmological\nsetting for spacetime metric gravity models described by the Gauss-Bonnet\naction. We start with expressing the Mattig relation for cosmological\nmagnitudes in terms of standard metric functions and redshift values. Then we\npresent the Gauss-Bonnet field equations and the associated limits for special\nsolutions in an arbitrary number of dimensions. These solutions are used to\nrewrite the Mattig relation with correction terms from the Gauss-Bonnet\ncontributions for the case where the Gauss-Bonnet scale factor can be directly\nused to find the distance modulus and for the case where the Gauss-Bonnet field\nequations can be expressed as a small high z perturbation on the standard\nEinstein field equations. As a result we can express the perturbative distance\nmodulus, which includes the apparent magnitude, as an additive correction to\nthe standard distance modulus. This results in a small shift in the apparent\nmagnitude of a high z object which gives a contribution depending on the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling, spacetime dimension and the cosmological constant.\n", "  Part of a review paper entitled \"Gravitational wave astronomy: the current\nstatus.\", appeared in \" Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy 58.12\n(2015): 1-41.\n", "  We present a construction of a large class of Laplace invariants for linear\nhyperbolic partial differential operators of fairly general form and arbitrary\norder.\n", "  We present measurements of 2$^{nd}$ order azimuthal anisotropy ($v_{2}$) at\nmid-rapidity $(|y|<1.0)$ for light nuclei d, t, $^{3}$He (for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n200, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, 11.5, and 7.7 GeV) and anti-nuclei $\\bar{\\rm d}$\n($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62.4, 39, 27, and 19.6 GeV) and $^{3}\\bar{\\rm He}$\n($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV) in the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC)\nexperiment. The $v_{2}$ for these light nuclei produced in heavy-ion collisions\nis compared with those for p and $\\bar{\\rm p}$. We observe mass ordering in\nnuclei $v_{2}(p_{T})$ at low transverse momenta ($p_{T}<2.0$ GeV/$c$). We also\nfind a centrality dependence of $v_{2}$ for d and $\\bar{\\rm d}$. The magnitude\nof $v_{2}$ for t and $^{3}$He agree within statistical errors. Light-nuclei\n$v_{2}$ are compared with predictions from a blast wave model. Atomic mass\nnumber ($A$) scaling of light-nuclei $v_{2}(p_{T})$ seems to hold for $p_{T}/A\n< 1.5$ GeV/$c$. Results on light-nuclei $v_{2}$ from a\ntransport-plus-coalescence model are consistent with the experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  This thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, some preliminaries are\ngiven on isometries and conformal symmetries, and we become familiar with the\nVirasoro algebra. Two examples of classical central charges are discussed.\nChapter 3 contains an introduction to the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge\ntheories in the context of Maxwell theory. The knowledge gained in Chapter 3 is\napplied to general relativity in Chapter 4. The Hamiltonian is shown to acquire\na surface term due to the presence of the boundary. The geometrical properties\nof anti-de Sitter space and the BTZ black hole are the subject of Chapter 5.\nThe main part of the discussion follows in Chapter 6, which contains the\ncalculation of the central charge in the asymptotic symmetry algebra of\nasymptotically AdS3 space-times. After some preliminaries on the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence and Chern-Simons theory, the derivation of the boundary\nconformal field theory is summarized in Chapter 7. Finally, Strominger's\nentropy calculation is presented in Chapter 8, along with some comments on this\napproach.\n", "  In proportional elections with open lists the excess of preferences received\nby candidates with respect to the list average is known to follow a universal\nlognormal distribution. We show that lognormality is broken provided\npreferences are conditioned to lists with many candidates. In this limit\npower-law tails emerge. We study the large-list limit in the framework of a\nquenched approximation of the word-of-mouth model introduced by Fortunato and\nCastellano (Phys.Rev.Lett.99(13):138701,2007), where the activism of the agents\nis mitigated and the noise of the agent-agent interactions is averaged out.\nThen we argue that our analysis applies mutatis mutandis to the original model\nas well.\n", "  A one-dimensional, two-channel quantum wire is studied in the effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework. Analytical expressions are derived for the\nband structure of the isolated wire. Quantum states and transport properties of\nthe wire coupled to two ideal leads at the edges are studied in detail. The\nwidth distribution of the quasistationary states varies as a function of the\ncoupling strength to the environment. At weak coupling, all the eigenenergies\nuniformly acquire small widths. The picture changes entirely at strong\ncoupling, a certain number of states (\"super-radiant\") are greatly broadened,\nwhile the rest remain long-lived states, a pure quantum mechanical effect as a\nconsequence of quantum interference. The transition between the two regimes\ngreatly influences the transport properties of the system. The maximum\ntransmission through the wire occurs at the super-radiance transition. We\nconsider also a realistic situation with energy-dependent coupling to the\ncontinuum due to the existence of decay threshold where super-radiance still\nplays a significant role in transport properties of the system.\n", "  Solid particles floating at a liquid interface exhibit a long-ranged\nattraction mediated by surface tension. In the absence of bulk elasticity, this\nis the dominant lateral interaction of mechanical origin. Here we show that an\nanalogous long-range interaction occurs between adjacent droplets on solid\nsubstrates, which crucially relies on a combination of capillarity and bulk\nelasticity. We experimentally observe the interaction between droplets on soft\ngels and provide a theoretical framework that quantitatively predicts the\nmigration velocity of the droplets. Remarkably, we find that while on thick\nsubstrates the interaction is purely attractive and leads to drop-drop\ncoalescence, for relatively thin substrates a short-range repulsion occurs\nwhich prevents the two drops from coming into direct contact. This versatile,\nnew interaction is the liquid-on-solid analogue of the \"Cheerios effect\". The\neffect will strongly influence the condensation and coarsening of drop soft\npolymer films, and has potential implications for colloidal assembly and in\nmechanobiology.\n", "  A large number of compounds which contain BiS$_{2}$ layers exhibit enhanced\nsuperconductivity upon electron doping. Much interest and research effort has\nbeen focused on BiS$_{2}$-based compounds which provide new opportunities for\nexploring the nature of superconductivity. Important to the study of\nBiS$_{2}$-based superconductors is the relation between structure and\nsuperconductivity. By modifying either the superconducting BiS$_2$ layers or\nthe blocking layers in these layered compounds, one can effectively tune the\nlattice parameters, local atomic environment, electronic structure, and other\nphysical properties of these materials. In this article, we will review some of\nthe recent progress on research of the effects of chemical substitution in\nBiS$_{2}$-based compounds, with special attention given to the compounds in the\n$Ln$OBiS$_{2}$ ($Ln$ = La-Nd) system. Strategies which are reported to be\nessential in optimizing superconductivity of these materials will also be\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate a possibility to regularize the hydrodynamic contact line\nsingularity in the configuration of partial wetting (liquid wedge on a solid\nsubstrate) via evaporation-condensation, when an inert gas is present in the\natmosphere above the liquid. The no-slip condition is imposed at the\nsolid-liquid interface and the system is assumed to be isothermal. The mass\nexchange dynamics is controlled by vapor diffusion in the inert gas and\ninterfacial kinetic resistance. The coupling between the liquid meniscus\ncurvature and mass exchange is provided by the Kelvin effect. The atmosphere is\nsaturated and the substrate moves at a steady velocity with respect to the\nliquid wedge. A multi-scale analysis is performed. The liquid dynamics\ndescription in the phase-change-controlled microregion and visco-capillary\nintermediate region is based on the lubrication equations. The vapor diffusion\nis considered in the gas phase. It is shown that from the mathematical point of\nview, the phase exchange relieves the contact line singularity. The liquid mass\nis conserved: evaporation existing on a part of the meniscus and condensation\noccurring over another part compensate exactly each other. However, numerical\nestimations carried out for three common fluids (ethanol, water and glycerol)\nat the ambient conditions show that the characteristic length scales are tiny.\n", "  The neutrino flux used in Becker-Szendy {\\em et al.}\\cite{BZ} is now known to\nbe\n  in error. Becker-Szendy {\\em et al.}\\cite{BZ} depended heavily on the\n  Lee and Koh flux\\cite{LeeKoh} which was noted as erroneous in Gaisser {\\em et\nal.}\\cite{Bug}.\n  This makes the results of Becker-Szendy {\\em et al.}\\cite{BZ} unreliable.\n", "  The Fock exchange operator plays a central role in modern quantum chemistry.\nThe large computational cost associated with the Fock exchange operator hinders\nHartree-Fock calculations and Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations\nwith hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, even for systems consisting of\nhundreds of atoms. We develop the adaptively compressed exchange operator (ACE)\nformulation, which greatly reduces the computational cost associated with the\nFock exchange operator without loss of accuracy. The ACE formulation does not\ndepend on the size of the band gap, and thus can be applied to insulating,\nsemiconducting as well as metallic systems. In an iterative framework for\nsolving Hartree-Fock-like systems, the ACE formulation only requires moderate\nmodification of the code, and can be potentially beneficial for all electronic\nstructure software packages involving exchange calculations. Numerical results\nindicate that the ACE formulation can become advantageous even for small\nsystems with tens of atoms. In particular, the cost of each self-consistent\nfield iteration for the electron density in the ACE formulation is only\nmarginally larger than that of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)\ncalculation, and thus offers orders of magnitude speedup for Hartree-Fock-like\ncalculations.\n", "  The Qweak experiment which ran at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, VA, measured\nthe weak charge of the proton $Q_W^p$ via elastic electron-proton scattering.\nLongitudinally polarized electrons were scattered from an unpolarized liquid\nhydrogen target. The Standard Model predicts a small parity-violating asymmetry\nof scattering rates between electron right and left helicity states due to the\nweak interaction. An initial result using 4% of the data was published in\nOctober 2013 with a measured parity-violating asymmetry of $-279\\pm\n35(\\text{stat})\\pm 31$ (syst) parts per billion (ppb). This asymmetry, along\nwith other data from parity-violating electron scattering experiments, provided\nthe world's first determination of the weak charge of the proton. The weak\ncharge of the proton was found to be $Q_W^p=0.064\\pm0.012$, in agreement with\nthe Standard Model prediction of $Q_W^p(SM)=0.0708\\pm0.0003$.\n  The results of the full dataset are expected to decrease the statistical\nerror from the initial publication by a factor of 4-5. The level of precision\nof the final result makes it a useful test of Standard Model predictions and\nparticularly of the \"running\" of $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ from the Z-mass to low\nenergies. This thesis focuses on reduction of systematic error in two key\nsystematics for the Qweak experiment. First, techniques for measuring and\nremoving false asymmetries arising from helicity-correlated electron beam\nproperties at the few ppb level are discussed. Second, as a parity-violating\nexperiment, Qweak relies on accurate knowledge of electron beam polarimetry. To\nhelp address the requirement of accurate polarimetry, a Compton polarimeter\nbuilt specifically for Qweak. Compton polarimetry requires accurate knowledge\nof laser polarization inside a Fabry-Perot cavity enclosed in the electron beam\npipe. A new technique was developed for Qweak that nearly eliminates this\nsystematic error.\n", "  According to the `ceRNA hypothesis', microRNAs (miRNAs) may act as mediators\nof an effective positive interaction between long coding or non-coding RNA\nmolecules, carrying significant potential implications for a variety of\nbiological processes. Here, inspired by recent work providing a quantitative\ndescription of small regulatory elements as information-conveying channels, we\ncharacterize the effectiveness of miRNA-mediated regulation in terms of the\noptimal information flow achievable between modulator (transcription factors)\nand target nodes (long RNAs). Our findings show that, while a sufficiently\nlarge degree of target derepression is needed to activate miRNA-mediated\ntransmission, (a) in case of differential mechanisms of complex processing\nand/or transcriptional capabilities, regulation by a post-transcriptional\nmiRNA-channel can outperform that achieved through direct transcriptional\ncontrol; moreover, (b) in the presence of large populations of weakly\ninteracting miRNA molecules the extra noise coming from titration disappears,\nallowing the miRNA-channel to process information as effectively as the direct\nchannel. These observations establish the limits of miRNA-mediated\npost-transcriptional cross-talk and suggest that, besides providing a degree of\nnoise buffering, this type of control may be effectively employed in cells both\nas a failsafe mechanism and as a preferential fine tuner of gene expression,\npointing to the specific situations in which each of these functionalities is\nmaximized.\n", "  In this paper, a network of hypertension-related genes is constructed by\nanalyzing the correlations of gene expression data among the Dahl\nsalt-sensitive rat and two consomic rat strains. The numerical calculations\nshow that this sparse and assortative network has small-world and scale-free\nproperties. Further, 16 key hub genes (Col4a1, Lcn2, Cdk4, etc.) are determined\nby introducing an integrated centrality and have been confirmed by\nbiological/medical research to play important roles in hypertension.\n", "  We report a 2D Boundary Element Method (BEM) modeling of the thermal\ndiffusion-controlled growth of a vapor bubble attached to a heating surface\nduring saturated pool boiling. The transient heat conduction problem is solved\nin a liquid that surrounds a bubble with a free boundary and in a semi-infinite\nsolid heater. The heat generated homogeneously in the heater causes\nevaporation, i. e. the bubble growth. A singularity exists at the point of the\ntriple (liquid-vapor-solid) contact. At high system pressure the bubble is\nassumed to grow slowly, its shape being defined by the surface tension and the\nvapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporating into the bubble.\nIt is shown that at some typical time the dry spot under the bubble begins to\ngrow rapidly under the action of the vapor recoil. Such a bubble can eventually\nspread into a vapor film that can separate the liquid from the heater, thus\ntriggering the boiling crisis (Critical Heat Flux phenomenon).\n", "  We present an exact master equation for a central spin-$1/2$ system coupled\nto a spin-$1/2$ bath in terms of hyperfine interaction, which provides a\nunified formalism for both free evolution and controlled dynamics of the\ncentral spin. The equation enables us to study controllability of dynamics\nprocesses with various degrees of non-Markovianity. We investigate the\nOverhauser's effect on decoherence dynamics of the central spin under different\nbath spectra and the system-bath coupling strengths. Nonperturbative leakage\nelimination approach is applied to the system to suppress decoherence in\nsolid-state quantum information processing.\n", "  Two beamline Cherenkov detectors (Ckov-a,-b) support particle identification\nin the MICE beamline. Electrons and high-momentum muons and pions can be\nidentified with good efficiency. We report on the Ckov-a,-b performance in\ndetecting pions and muons with MICE Step I data and derive an upper limit on\nthe pion contamination in the standard MICE muon beam.\n", "  The shear behavior of a single rock joint in limestone specimens, under a\nconstant normal load (CNL), was analyzed in this study. Test specimens with\ndifferent asperity roughness were prepared and tested. The Goodman model of a\nrock joint shear behavior, under CNL, was modified to render a better\nrepresentation of the data obtained. The model applicability was validated. The\nproposed model shows better correlation with experimental data. It also,\nrequires fewer variables. The steps to calculate all the necessary variables\nfor the model are discussed.\n", "  A large dynamic range is required by the Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD)\nof DArk Matter Paricle Explorer (DAMPE), and a double-dynode readout has been\ndeveloped. To verify this design, a prototype detector module has been\nconstructed and tested with cosmic rays and heavy ion beams. The results match\nwith the estimation and the readout unit could easily cover the required\ndynamic range.\n", "  The cryomodule I for ADS Injection-I had been designed, fabricated and online\ntested. The CM1 contains seven superconducting magnets, seven superconducting\nspoke cavities and seven beam position monitors. The superconducting magnet,\nwhich is a kind of multifunction magnet in a 170mm length axial space, contains\na solenoid for beam focusing and two correctors for orbit correction. The\ndesign goals for the magnets are to meet the required integral field strength\nand to reduce the leakage field of less than 2 G at the nearby superconducting\nspoke cavities. The 2.1K, 31 mbar cryogenic system, where the magnets and spoke\ncavities shared with, force the magnet must select a kind of conduction cooled\ncurrent leads. The first one of the batch magnets was tested in a vertical\nDewar in HIT in July, 2014. The measurement results met the design\nrequirements. Online operation of CM1 in September, 2015 showed that seven\nmagnets can work at 230A under 4.2K and 2.1K respectively. This paper will\npresent the magnet and current lead design, field measurement and the\ninstallation progress.\n", "  Distinguishability is a fundamental and operational task generally connected\nto information applications. In quantum information theory, from the postulates\nof quantum mechanics it often has an intrinsic limitation, which then dictates\nand also characterises capabilities of related information tasks. In this work,\nwe consider discrimination between bipartite two-qubit unitary transformations\nby local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and its relations to\nentangling capabilities of given unitaries. We show that a pair of entangling\nunitaries which do not contain local parts, if they are perfectly\ndistinguishable by global operations, can also be perfectly distinguishable by\nLOCC. There also exist non-entangling unitaries, e.g. local unitaries, that are\nperfectly discriminated by global operations but not by LOCC. The results show\nthat capabilities of LOCC are strictly restricted than global operations in\ndistinguishing bipartite unitaries for a finite number of repetitions, contrast\nto discrimination of a pair of bipartite states and also to asymptotic\ndiscrimination of unitaries.\n", "  We investigate the optical control possibilities of spin-valley qubit carried\nby single electrons localized in nanostructures of monolayer TMDs, including\nsmall quantum dots formed by lateral heterojunction and charged impurities. The\nquantum controls are discussed when the confinement induces valley\nhybridization and when the valley hybridization is absent. We show that the\nbulk valley and spin optical selection rules can be inherited in different\nforms in the two scenarios, both of which allow the definition of spin-valley\nqubit with desired optical controllability. We also investigate nuclear spin\ninduced decoherence and quantum control of electron-nuclear spin entanglement\nvia intervalley terms of the hyperfine interaction. Optically controlled\ntwo-qubit operations in a single quantum dot are discussed.\n", "  We present nuclear physics programs based on the planned experiments using\nrare isotope beams (RIBs) for the future Korean Rare Isotope Beams Accelerator\nfacility; RAON. This ambitious facility has both an Isotope Separation On Line\n(ISOL) and fragmentation capability for producing RIBs and accelerating beams\nof wide range mass of nuclides with energies of a few to hundreds MeV per\nnucleon. Low energy RIBs at Elab = 5 to 20 MeV per nucleon are for the study of\nnuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics toward and beyond the drip lines\nwhile higher energy RIBs produced by in-flight fragmentation with the\nre-accelerated ions from the ISOL enable to explore the neutron drip lines in\nintermediate mass regions. The planned programs have goals for investigating\nnuclear structures of the exotic nuclei toward and beyond the nucleon drip\nlines by addressing the following issues: how the shell structure evolves in\nareas of extreme proton to neutron imbalance; whether the isospin symmetry\nmaintains in isobaric mirror nuclei at and beyond the drip lines, how\ntwo-proton radioactivity affects abundances of the elements, what the role of\nthe continuum states including resonant states above the neutron- and\nproton-decay threshold in exotic nuclei is in astrophysical nuclear reaction\nprocesses, and how the nuclear reaction rates triggered by unbound proton-rich\nnuclei make an effect on rapid proton capture processes in a very hot stellar\nplasma.\n", "  In the present paper, we propose a new discrete surface theory on 3-valent\nembedded graphs in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space which are not necessarily\ndiscretization or approximation of smooth surfaces. The Gauss curvature and the\nmean curvature of discrete surfaces are defined which satisfy properties\ncorresponding to the classical surface theory. We also discuss the convergence\nof a family of subdivided discrete surfaces of a given 3-valent discrete\nsurface by using the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. Although discrete surfaces\nin general have no corresponding smooth surfaces, we may find one as the limit.\n", "  Built on the tenets of rational thermodynamics, this article proposes a\ntheory of strain gradient thermo-visco-plasticity for isotropic polycrystalline\nmaterials under high strain rates. The effect of micro-inertia, which arises\ndue to dynamically evolving microstructural defects, is brought to bear on the\nmacro-continuum through a micro-force balance. Constitutive modelling of\ndissipative micro-stresses incorporates relaxation time parameters to account\nfor the time lags of the dissipative fluxes in attaining a steady state.\nAugmentation of the micro-force balance with constitutive relations for the\nmicro-stresses yields a non-local flow rule that reflects the effect of\nmicro-inertia on the evolution of the plastic strain. A thermodynamically\nconsistent derivation of temperature evolution is provided, thus replacing an\nempirical route. Numerical implementation of the proposal does not demand a\ncomputationally intensive return mapping algorithm. A two dimensional plane\nstrain model of impact between two 4340 steel plates is used to numerically\nassess the influence that micro-inertial and relaxation time parameters as well\nas various length scales may have on the macro-continuum response.\n", "  This report presents the proceedings of the Course on Advanced Accelerator\nPhysics organized by the CERN Accelerator School. The course was held in\nTrondheim, Norway from 18 to 29 August 2013, in collaboration with the\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology. Its syllabus was based on\nprevious courses and in particular on the course held in Berlin 2003 whose\nproceedings were published as CERN Yellow Report CERN- 2006-002. The field has\nseen significant advances in recent years and some topics were presented in a\nnew way and other topics were added. The lectures were supplemented with\ntutorials on key topics and 14 hours of hands on courses on Optics Design and\nCorrections, RF Measurement Techniques and Beam Instrumentation and\nDiagnostics. These courses are a key element of the Advanced Level Course.\n", "  The ANAIS project has been a long time effort devoted to carry out an\nexperiment to detect dark matter annual modulation with very low background\nNaI(Tl) detectors. It is expected to be fully commissioned along 2016. This\nexperiment could confirm the DAMA/LIBRA positive signal with the same target\nand technique. This work was devoted to the design, implementation and\ncharacterization of a data acquisition system suitable for the ANAIS\nexperiment, having in mind the ANAIS requirements: very low energy threshold, a\nbackground as low as possible in the region of interest, a high enough exposure\nand a rigorous parameter control in order to monitor systematics. This work\ndescribes the Photomultiplier Tubes used by the ANAIS modules and the\nalgorithms and protocol developed in order to pass quality tests to all units.\nIt presents the design and implementation of the electronic front-end for the\nANAIS modules and muon tagging system along with the data acquisition software.\nThe analysis software was adapted from the software of the previous prototypes\nto allow easy scale-up for the full experiment. Finally, the test of the\noptical performance of the Alpha Spectra modules and the tests of data\nacquisition and monitoring of environmental parameters are presented.\n", "  In non-self-consistent calculations of the total energy within the\nrandom-phase approximation (RPA) for electronic correlation, it is necessary to\nchoose a single-particle Hamiltonian whose solutions are used to construct the\nelectronic density and non-interacting response function. Here we investigate\nthe effect of including a Hubbard-$U$ term in this single-particle Hamiltonian,\nto better describe the on-site correlation of 3$d$ electrons in the transition\nmetal compounds ZnS, TiO$_2$ and NiO. We find that the RPA lattice constants\nare essentially independent of $U$, despite large changes in the underlying\nelectronic structure. We further demonstrate that the non-self-consistent RPA\ntotal energies of these materials have minima at nonzero $U$. Our RPA\ncalculations find the rutile phase of TiO$_2$ to be more stable than anatase\nindependent of $U$, a result which is consistent with experiments and\nqualitatively different to that found from calculations employing $U$-corrected\n(semi)local functionals. However we also find that the +$U$ term cannot be used\nto correct the RPA's poor description of the heat of formation of NiO.\n", "  Technical analysis is considered the oldest, currently omnipresent, method\nfor financial markets analysis, which uses past prices aiming at the possible\nshort-term forecast of future prices. In the frame of complex systems, methods\nused to quantitatively analyze specific dynamic phenomena are often used to\nanalyze phenomena from other disciplines on the grounds that are governed by\nsimilar dynamics. An interesting task is the forecast of a magnetic storm. The\nhourly Dst is used as a global index for the monitoring of Earth's\nmagnetosphere, which could be either in quiet (normal) or in magnetic storm\n(pathological) state. This work is the first attempt to apply technical\nanalysis tools on Dst time series, aiming at the identification of indications\nwhich could be used for the study of the temporal evolution of Earth's\nmagnetosphere state. We focus on the analysis of Dst time series around the\noccurrence of magnetic storms, discussing the possible use of the resulting\ninformation in the frame of multidisciplinary efforts towards extreme events\nforecasting. We employ the following financial analysis tools: simple moving\naverage (SMA), Bollinger bands, and relative strength index (RSI). Using these\ntools, we formulate a methodology based on all indications that could be\nrevealed in order to infer the onset, duration and recovery phase of a magnetic\nstorm, focusing on the temporal sequence they occur. The applicability of the\nproposed methodology is examined on characteristic cases of magnetic storms\nwith encouraging results for space weather forecasting.\n", "  Multiparticle entangled quantum states, a key resource in quantum-enhanced\nmetrology and computing, are usually generated by coherent operations\nexclusively. However, unusual forms of quantum dynamics can be obtained when\nenvironment coupling is used as part of the state generation. In this work, we\nused quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), based on nondestructive measurement with an\noptical microcavity, to deterministically generate different multiparticle\nentangled states in an ensemble of 36 qubit atoms in less than 5 microseconds.\nWe characterized the resulting states by performing quantum tomography,\nyielding a time-resolved account of the entanglement generation. In addition,\nwe studied the dependence of quantum states on measurement strength and\nquantified the depth of entanglement. Our results show that QZD is a versatile\ntool for fast and deterministic entanglement generation in quantum engineering\napplications.\n", "  We use density functional computations to study the size effects on the\nstructural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of (5,0) finite carbon\nnanotubes (FCNT), with length in the range of 4-44 \\AA. It is found that the\nstructural and electronic properties of (5,0) FCNTs, in the ground state,\nconverge at a length of about 30 \\AA, while the excited state properties\nexhibit long-range edge effects. We discuss that curvature effects govern the\nelectronic structure of short (5,0) FCNTs and enhance energy gap of these\nsystems, in contrast to the known trend in the periodic limit. It is seen that\ncompensation of curvature effects in two special small sizes, may give rise to\nspontaneous magnetization. The obtained cohesive energies provide some insights\ninto the effects of environment on the growth of FCNTs. The second-order\ndifference of the total energies reveals an important magic size of about 15\n\\AA. The optical and dynamical magnetic responses of the FCNTs to polarized\nelectromagnetic pulses are studied by time dependent density functional theory.\nThe obtained results show that the static and dynamic magnetic properties\nmainly come from the edge carbon atoms. The optical absorption properties are\ndescribed in term of local field effects and characterized by Casida linear\nresponse calculations.\n", "  In $F(T)$ gravity theory, a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with\n$f$-essence where fermion field is non-minimally coupled with the gravitational\nfield is studied. Using the Noether symmetry approach the possible forms of\n$F(T)$ gravity and the non-canonical fermionic lagrangian $K$ are determined.\nCosmological solutions of the condered models describing the accelerated and\ndecelerated periods of the universe are found.\n", "  The possibility in principle of the existence of Casimir electromotive force\n(EMF) is shown for nonparallel nanosized metal plates arranged in the form of a\nperiodic structure. It is found that EMF does not appear in strictly periodic\nstructures with parallel plates. However, when the strict periodicity is\ndisturbed in nonparallel plates, EMF is generated, and its value is equal to\nthe number of pairs of plates in a configuration. Moreover, there are some\neffective parameters of the configuration (angles between plates, plate lengths\nand length to length ratios), at which the EMF generation per unit of the\nlength of the periodic structure is maximal.\n", "  We identify a broad class of phonon modes with persistent vortex fluxes at\narbitrarily slow propagating velocities in periodic nano-waveguides. Such\nphonon vortices are associated with the split band-edges in dispersion\ndependencies, which can be engineered by waveguide design. Modulations\nintroduced in such waveguides can support a pair of defect cavity phonon modes\nwith an arbitrarily small frequency splitting. These features can find\napplications for sensing and nano-manipulation.\n", "  In this work, we have gone one step further from the study presented in the\nfirst CoRoT symposium. Our analysis consists on constructing a model database\ncovering the entire uncertainty box of the $\\delta$ Sct star HD174966, derived\nfrom the usual observables ($\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $\\log g$ and [Fe/H]),\nand constraining the models representative of the star. To do that, we use the\nvalue of the periodicity (related to $\\Delta\\nu_{\\ell}$) found in its CoRoT\npulsating spectrum.\n", "  We examine an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector which couples linearly to the\nscalar density of a massless Dirac field on the static cylindrical quotient of\nthe (1+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, allowing the detector's motion to\nremain arbitrary and working to leading order in perturbation theory. We show\nthat the detector's response distinguishes the periodic and antiperiodic spin\nstructures, and the zero mode that is present for periodic spinors contributes\nto the response by a state-dependent but well defined and controllable amount.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study a Lie conformal algebra of Block type. In\nthis paper, conformal derivation, conformal module of rank 1 and\nlow-dimensional comohology of the Lie conformal algebra of Block type are\nstudied. Also, the vertex Poisson algebra structure associated with the Lie\nconformal algebra of Block type is constructed.\n", "  We propose a new approach to analysis of cathodoluminescence spectra of\nsubstrate-free nanoclusters of argon produced in a supersonic jet expanding\ninto a vacuum. It is employed to analyze intensities of the luminescence bands\nof neutral and charged excimer complexes (Ar2)* and (Ar4+)* measured for\nclusters with an average size of 500 to 8900 atoms per cluster and diameters\nranging from 32 to 87 {\\AA}. Concentration of the jet substance condensed into\nclusters, which determines the absolute values of the integrated band\nintensities, is shown to be proportional to the logarithm of the average\ncluster size. Analysis of reduced intensities of the (Ar2)* and (Ar4+)* bands\nin the spectra of crystalline clusters with an fcc structure allows us to\nconclude that emission of the neutral molecules (Ar2)* comes from within the\nwhole volume of the cluster, while the charged complexes (Ar4+)* radiate from\nits near-surface layers. We find the cluster size range in which the jet is\ndominated by quasicrystalline clusters with an icosahedral structure and\ndemonstrate that the transition from icosahedral to fcc clusters occurs when\nthe average cluster size is N = 1400+-400 atoms per cluster.\n", "  The mixed valent compound SmB6 is of high current interest as the first\ncandidate example of topologically protected surface states in a strongly\ncorrelated insulator and also as a possible host for an exotic bulk many-body\nstate that would manifest properties of both an insulator and a metal. Two\ndifferent de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) experiments have each supported one of\nthese possibilities, while angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nfor the (001) surface has supported the first, but without quantitative\nagreement to the dHvA results. We present new ARPES data for the (110) surface\nand a new analysis of all published dHvA data and thereby bring ARPES and dHvA\ninto substantial consistency around the basic narrative of two dimensional\nsurface states.\n", "  We report measurements of the ion velocity distribution in an ultracold\nneutral plasma derived from a dense, cold Rydberg gas in a MOT. The Rydberg\natoms are excited using a resonant two-step excitation pathway with lasers of 4\nns duration. The plasma forms spontaneously and rapidly. The rms width of the\nion velocity distribution is determined by measuring laser-induced fluorescence\n(LIF) of the ions. The measured excitation efficiency is compared with a\nMonte-Carlo wavefunction calculation, and significant differences are observed.\nWe discuss the conditions for blockaded Rydberg excitation and the subsequent\nspatial ordering of Rydberg atom domains. While the blockade interaction is\ngreater than the Rabi frequency in portions of the atomic sample, no evidence\nfor spatial ordering is observed.\n", "  We report on ongoing work to gain insight into the astronomy knowledge and\nperspectives of pre-service teachers and middle school students in Norway. We\ncarefully adapted and translated into Norwegian an existing instrument, the\nIntroductory Astronomy Questionnaire (IAQ); we administered this adapted IAQ to\n(i) pre-service teachers at the largest teacher education institution in\nNorway, and (ii) students drawn from eight middle schools in Oslo, in both\ncases before and after astronomy instruction. Amongst our preliminary findings\n- based on an analysis of both free-response writing and multiple-choice\nresponses - was that when prompted to provide responses to hypothetical\nstudents, the pre-service teachers exhibited a marked drop in pedagogical\nresponses pre- to post-instruction, with corresponding shifts towards more\nauthoritative responses. We also identified potentially serious issues relating\nto middle school students' conceptions of size and distances in the universe,\nwith significant stratification along gender lines.\n", "  We present a study of complexes of young massive star clusters (YMCs),\nembedded in extragalactic giant HII regions, based on the coupling of\nspectroscopic with photometric and spectrophotometric observations of about 100\nstar forming regions in seven spiral galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 783, NGC 2336, NGC\n6217, NGC 6946, NGC 7331, and NGC 7678). The complete observational database\nhas been observed and accumulated within the framework of our comprehensive\nstudy of extragalactic star forming regions. The current paper presents the\nlast part of either unpublished or refreshed photometric and spectrophotometric\nobservations of the galaxies NGC 6217, NGC 6946, NGC 7331, and NGC 7678. We\nderive extinctions, chemical abundances, continuum and line emissions of\nionised gas, ages and masses for cluster complexes. We find the young massive\ncluster complexes to have ages no greater than 10 Myr and masses between\n10^4Msol and 10^7Msol, and the extinctions A(V) vary between ~ 0 and 3 mag,\nwhile the impact of the nebular emission on integrated broadband photometry\nmainly is not greater than 40% of the total flux and is comparable with\naccuracies of dereddened photometric quantities.We also find evidence of\ndifferential extinction of stellar and gas emissions in some clusters, which\nhinders the photometric determination of ages and masses in these cases.\nFinally, we show that young massive cluster complexes in the studied galaxies\nand open clusters in the Milky Way form a continuous sequence of\nluminosities/masses and colour/ages.\n", "  Brown dwarfs form mineral clouds in their atmospheres, where charged\nparticles can produce large-scale discharges in form of lightning resulting in\na substantial sudden increase of local ionisation. Brown dwarfs are observed to\nemit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient\natmospheric ionisation events (flash ionisation) can be imprinted on a\npre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash ionisation events will open\ninvestigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics. Such\nionisation events can also result from explosion shock waves, bursts or\neruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a\npre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity\nthat is characteristic for flash ionisation events like lightning. Our\nconductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from\nobservations of Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes, and is applicable to\nastrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization,\nas in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks. We show that the field\nresponds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of\nintermediate intensity. More powerful ionisation events result in smaller\nvariations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the\ncharacteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation\ncarries information about the ionisation flash magnitude and duration. The\nduration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for\nlarger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the\nflash ionisation. Our work suggests that cyclotron emission could be probe\nsignals for electrification processes inside BD atmosphere.\n", "  In this work, phosphorous-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes have been\nsynthesized by the thermal decomposition of trimethylphosphine using a\nhigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition method. Furthermore, a modified\ndensity-gradient-ultracentrifugation process has been applied to carefully\npurify our doped material. The combined use of Raman and X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy allowed us to provide the first insight into the bonding\nenvironment of P incorporated into the carbon lattice, avoiding competing\nsignals arising from synthesis byproducts. This study represents the first step\ntoward the identification of the bonding configuration of P atoms when direct\nsubstitution takes place.\n", "  On the basis of the periodic Anderson model the microscopic Ginzburg-Landau\nequations for heavy-fermion superconductors in the coexistence phase of\nsuperconductivity and antiferromagnetism have been derived. The obtained\nexpressions are valid in the vicinity of quantum critical point of\nheavy-fermion superconductors when the onset temperatures of antiferromagnetism\nand superconductivity are sufficiently close to each other. It is shown that\nthe formation of antiferromagnetic ordering causes a decrease of the critical\ntemperature of superconducting transition and order parameter in the phase of\ncoexisting superconductivity and antiferromagnetism.\n", "  This work is a summary of the X-ray spectral studies of 29 TeV $\\gamma$-ray\nemitting blazars observed with Swift/XRT, especially focusing on sources for\nwhich X-ray regime allows to study the low and the high energy ends of the\nparticle distributions function. Variability studies require simultaneous\ncoverage, ideally sampling different flux states of each source. This is\nachieved using X-ray observations by disentangling the high-energy end of the\nsynchrotron emission and the low-energy end of the Compton emission, which are\nproduced by the same electron population. We focused on a sample of 29 TeV\ngamma-ray emitting blazars with the best signal-to-noise X-ray observations\ncollected with Swift/XRT in the energy range of 0.3-10 keV during 10 years of\nSwift/XRT operations. We investigate the X-ray spectral shapes and the effects\nof different corrections for neutral hydrogen absorption and decompose the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton components. In the case of 5 sources (3C 66A,\nS5 0716+714, W Comae, 4C +21.35 and BL Lacertae) a superposition of both\ncomponents is observed in the X-ray band, permitting simultaneous, time\nresolved studies of both ends of the electron distribution. The analysis of\nmulti-epoch observations revealed that the break energy of X-ray spectrum\nvaries only by a small factor with flux changes. Flux variability is more\npronounced in the synchrotron domain (high-energy end of the electron\ndistribution) than in the Compton domain (low energy end of the electron\ndistribution). The spectral shape of the Compton domain is stable, while the\nflux of the synchrotron domain is variable. These changes cannot be described\nby simple variations of the cut-off energy, suggesting that the high-energy end\nof the electron distribution is not generally well-described by cooling only.\n", "  In the microscopic modeling of new-generation electronic quantum nanodevices\na variety of simulation strategies have been proposed and employed. Aim of this\nLetter is to point out virtues versus intrinsic limitations of non-Markovian\ndensity-matrix approaches; we shall show that the usual mean-field treatment\nmay lead to highly unphysical results, like negative distribution probabilities\nand non-dissipative behaviours, which are particularly severe in\nzero-dimensional electronic systems coupled to dispersionless phonon modes.\nThis is in striking contrast with Markovian treatments, where a proper\ncombination of adiabatic limit and mean-field schemes guarantees a physically\nacceptable solution; as a result, the unusual conclusion is that two\napproximations are better than one.\n", "  Some physicists hope to use string/M-theory to construct a comprehensive\nunderlying theory of our physical world a \"final theory\". Can such a theory be\ntested? A quantum theory of gravity must be formulated in 10 dimensions, so\nobviously testing it experimentally requires projecting it onto our 4D world\n(called \"compactification\"). Most string theorists study theories, including\naspects such as AdS/CFT, not phenomena, and are not much interested in testing\ntheories beyond the Standard Model about our world. Compactified theories\ngenerically have many realistic features whose necessary presence provides some\ntests, such as gravity, Yang-Mills forces like the Standard Model ones, chiral\nfermions that lead to parity violation, softly broken supersymmetry, Higgs\nphysics, families, hierarchical fermion masses and more. All tests of theories\nin physics have always depended on assumptions and approximate calculations,\nand tests of compactified string/M-theories do too. String phenomenologists\nhave also formulated some explicit tests for compactified theories. In\nparticular, I give examples of tests from compactified M-theory (involving\nHiggs physics, predictions for superpartners at LHC, electric dipole moments,\nand more). It is clear that compactified theories exist that can describe\nworlds like ours, and it is clear that even if a multiverse were real it does\nnot prevent us from finding comprehensive compactified theories like one that\nmight describe our world. I also discuss what we might mean by a final theory,\nwhat we might want it to explain, and comment briefly on multiverse issues from\nthe point of view of finding a theory that describes our world.\n", "  Some characteristics of the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) model are\nreviewed. At least the following properties of radio pulsars can be reproduced\nin the model: core or central emission beam, one or two hollow emission cones,\ndifferent emission heights of these components, diverse pulse profiles at\nvarious frequencies, linear and circular polarization features of core and\ncones.\n", "  In this paper, the compiled long-term optical and infrared measurements of\nsome blazars are used to analyze the variation properties and the optical data\nare used to search for periodicity evidence in the lightcurve by means of the\nJurkevich technique and the discrete correlation function (DCF) method.\nFollowing periods are found: 4.52-year for 3C 66A; 1.56 and 2.95 years for AO\n0235+164;\n  14.4, 18.6 years for PKS 0735+178; 17.85 and 24.7 years for PKS 0754+100;\n5.53 and 11.75 for OJ 287. 4.45, and 6.89 years for PKS 1215; 9 and 14.84 years\nfor PKS 1219+285;\n  2.0, 13.5 and 22.5 for 3C273; 7.1 year for 3C279;\n  6.07 for PKS 1308+326; 3.0 and 16.5 years for PKS 1418+546;\n  2.0 and 9.35 years for PKS 1514-241; 18.18 for PKS 1807+698;\n  4.16 and 7.0 for 2155-304; 14 and 20 years for BL Lacertae. Some explanations\nhave been discussed.\n", "  With the aim of constraining the structural properties of neutron stars and\nthe equation of state of dense matter, we study sudden spin-ups, glitches,\noccurring in the Vela pulsar and in six other pulsars. We present evidence that\nglitches represent a self-regulating instability for which the star prepares\nover a waiting time. The angular momentum requirements of glitches in Vela\nindicate that at least 1.4% of the star's moment of inertia drives these\nevents. If glitches originate in the liquid of the inner crust, Vela's\n`radiation radius' $R_\\infty$ must exceed ~12 km for a mass of 1.4 solar\nmasses. The isolated neutron star RX J18563-3754 is a promising candidate for a\ndefinitive radius measurement, and offers to further our understanding of dense\nmatter and the origin of glitches.\n", "  We adopt up-to-date yields of 7Li, 13C, 15N from classical novae and use a\nwell tested model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way in order to\npredict the temporal evolution of these elemental species in the solar\nneighborhood. In spite of major uncertainties due to our lack of knowledge of\nmetallicity effects on the final products of explosive nucleosynthesis in nova\noutbursts, we find a satisfactory agreement between theoretical predictions and\nobservations for 7Li and 13C. On the contrary, 15N turns out to be overproduced\nby about an order of magnitude.\n", "  The neutron star crust is rigid material floating on a neutron-proton liquid\ncore. As the star's spin rate slows, the changing stellar shape stresses the\ncrust and causes fractures. These starquakes may trigger pulsar glitches as\nwell as the jumps in spin-down rate that are observed to persist after some\nglitches. Earlier studies found that starquakes in spinning-down neutron stars\npush matter toward the magnetic poles, causing temporary misalignment of the\nstar's spin and angular momentum. After the star relaxes to a new equilibrium\norientation, the magnetic poles are closer to the equator, and the magnetic\nbraking torque is increased. The magnitude and sign of the predicted torque\nchanges are in agreement with the observed persistent spin-down offsets. Here\nwe examine the relaxation processes by which the new equilibrium orientation is\nreached. We find that the neutron superfluid in the inner crust slows as the\nstar's spin realigns with the angular momentum, causing the crust to spin more\nrapidly. For plausible parameters the time scale and the magnitude of the\ncrust's spin up agree with the giant glitches in the Vela and other pulsars.\n", "  We present results on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances for a sample of\nunevolved metal-poor stars with metallicities in the range -0.3< [Fe/H]< -3.\nOxygen abundances derived from different indicators are compared showing\nconsistently that in the range 0.3 >[Fe/H]>-3.0, the [O/Fe] ratio increases\nfrom approximately 0 to 1. We find a good agreement between abundances based on\nthe forbidden line, the OH and IR triplet lines when gravities based on\nHipparcos} parallaxes are considered for the sample stars. Gravities derived\nfrom LTE ionization balance in metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]< -1 are likely too\nlow, and could be responsible for an underestimation of the oxygen abundances\nderived using the [OI] line. [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ratios appear to be constant,\nindependently of metallicity, in the same range. However, they show larger\nscatter than oxygen at a given metallicity, which could reflect the larger\nvariety of stellar production sites for these other elements.\n", "  We present and discuss the most recent determination of the rate of\nSupernovae in the local Universe. A comparison with other results shows a\ngeneral agreement on the gross values but still significant differences on the\nvalues of the rates of various SN rates in different kinds of galaxies. The\nrate of SNe, used as a probe of Star Formation, confirms the young progenitor\nscenario for SNII+Ib/c. The increasing diversity of SNe reflects also in the SN\nyields which may affect the chemical evolution of the Galaxy but, because of\nthe limited statistics, we cannot estimate the contributions of the new\nsubtypes yet. It is also expected that in a few years observational\ndeterminations of the SN rates at various look-back times will be available.\n", "  Taking optically thin accretion flows as an example, we investigate the\ndynamics and the emergent spectra of accretion flows with different outer\nboundary conditions (OBCs) and find that OBC plays an important role in\naccretion disk model. This is because the accretion equations describing the\nbehavior of accretion flows are a set of {\\em differential} equations,\ntherefore, accretion is intrinsically an initial-value problem. We argue that\noptically thick accretion flow should also show OBC-dependent behavior. The\nresult means that we should seriously consider the initial physical state of\nthe accretion flow such as its angular momentum and its temperature. An\napplication example to Sgr A$^*$ is presented.\n", "  There have been great and rapid progresses in the field of $\\gamma$-ray\nbursts (denoted as GRBs) since BeppoSAX and other telescopes discovered their\nafterglows in 1997. Here, we will first give a brief review on the\nobservational facts of GRBs and direct understanding from these facts, which\nlead to the standard fireball model. The dynamical evolution of the fireball is\ndiscussed, especially a generic model is proposed to describe the whole\ndynamical evolution of GRB remnant from highly radiative to adiabatic, and from\nultra-relativistic to non-relativistic phase. Then, Various deviations from the\nstandard model are discussed to give new information about GRBs and their\nenvironment. In order to relax the energy crisis, the beaming effects and their\npossible observational evidences are also discussed in GRB's radiations.\n", "  Two ways of possibly solving the angular momentum problem plaguing cold dark\nmatter (CDM) ab initio simulations of disk galaxy formation are discussed: 1)\nStellar feedback processes and 2) Warm dark matter (WDM) rather than CDM.\n  In relation to the chemical evolution of disk galaxies our simulations\nindicate that in case 1) the first generation of disk stars formed in disk\ngalaxies like the Milky Way should have an abundance about two dex below solar,\nin fairly good agreement with the lowest observed abundance of the metal-weak\ntail of the Galactic thick disk. For the second case no such statements can be\nmade without further assumptions about the star-formation history of the\ngalaxies.\n  We find that the I-band Tully-Fisher relation can be matched by WDM disk\ngalaxy formation simulations provided (M/L_I) is about 0.8 for disk galaxies,\nwhich Sommer-Larsen & Dolgov (1999) argue is a reasonable value.\n  Finally it is discussed how the magnetic field strengths observed in galactic\ndisks can be obtained through disk galaxy formation, as an alternative to the\nconventional dynamo hypothesis.\n", "  The evolution of the star formation rate in the Galaxy is one of the key\ningredients quantifying the formation and determining the chemical and\nluminosity evolution of galaxies. Many complementary methods exist to infer the\nstar formation history of the components of the Galaxy, from indirect methods\nfor analysis of low-precision data, to new exact analytic methods for analysis\nof sufficiently high quality data. We summarise available general constraints\non star formation histories, showing that derived star formation rates are in\ngeneral comparable to those seen today. We then show how colour-magnitude\ndiagrams of volume- and absolute magnitude-limited samples of the solar\nneighbourhood observed by Hipparcos may be analysed, using variational calculus\ntechniques, to reconstruct the local star formation history. The remarkable\naccuracy of the data coupled to our maximum-likelihood variational method\nallows objective quantification of the local star formation history with a time\nresolution of ~ 50 Myr. Over the past 3Gyr, the solar neighbourhood star\nformation rate has varied by a factor of ~ 4, with characteristic timescale\nabout 0.5Gyr, possibly triggered by interactions with spiral arms.\n", "  We consider some aspects of the evolution of massive stars which can only be\nelucidated by means of \"indirect\" observations, i.e. measurements of the\neffects of massive stars on their environments. We discuss in detail the early\nevolution of massive stars formed in high metallicity regions as inferred from\nstudies of HII regions in external galaxies.\n", "  Definitely, an affirmative answer to this question would have implications of\nfundamental importance for astrophysics (a new class of compact stars), and for\nthe physics of strong interactions (deconfined phase of quark matter, and\nstrange matter hypothesis). In the present work, we use observational data for\nthe newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 and for the\natoll source 4U 1728-34 to constrain the radius of the underlying compact\nstars. Comparing the mass-radius relation of these two compact stars with\ntheoretical models for both neutron stars and strange stars, we argue that a\nstrange star model is more consistent with SAX J1808.4-3658 and 4U 1728-34, and\nsuggest that they are likely strange star candidates.\n", "  The Fourier spectral techniques that are common in Astronomy for analyzing\nperiodic or multi-periodic light-curves lose their usefulness when they are\napplied to unsteady light-curves. We review some of the novel techniques that\nhave been developed for analyzing irregular stellar light or radial velocity\nvariations, and we describe what useful physical and astronomical information\ncan be gained from their use.\n", "  The status of the hydrodynamical modelling of nonlinear multi-mode stellar\npulsations is discussed. The hydrodynamical modelling of steady double-mode\n(DM) pulsations has been a long-standing quest that is finally being concluded.\nRecent progress has been made thanks to the introduction of turbulent\nconvection in the numerical hydrodynamical codes which provide detailed results\nfor individual models. An overview of the modal selection problem in the HR\ndiagram can be obtained in the form of bifurcation diagrams with the help of\nsimple nonresonant amplitude equations that capture the DM phenomenon.\n", "  In this work we explore the effects of adopting an initial mass function\n(IMF) variable in time on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In order to do\nthat we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes\nfor the formation of the Galaxy. We study the effects on such a model of\ndifferent IMFs. First, we use a theoretical one based on the statistical\ndescription of the density field arising from random motions in the gas. This\nIMF is a function of time as it depends on physical conditions of the site of\nstar formation. We also investigate the behaviour of the model predictions\nusing other variable IMFs, parameterized as a function of metallicity. Our\nresults show that the theoretical IMF when applied to our model depends on time\nbut such time variation is important only in the early phases of the Galactic\nevolution, when the IMF is biased towards massive stars. We also show that the\nuse of an IMF which is a stronger function of time does not lead to a good\nagreement with the observational constraints suggesting that if the IMF varied\nthis variation should have been small. Our main conclusion is that the G-dwarf\nmetallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large timescale and\na constant IMF, since it is possible to find variable IMFs of the kind studied\nhere, reproducing the G-dwarf metallicity but this worsens the agreement with\nother observational constraints.\n", "  We will review our mid-infrared and HST imaging surveys of the circumstellar\ndust shells of proto-planetary nebulae. While optical imaging indirectly probes\nthe dust distribution via dust-scattered starlight, mid-IR imaging directly\nmaps the distribution of warm dust grains. Both imaging surveys revealed\npreferencially axisymmetric nature of PPN dust shells, suggesting that\naxisymmetry in planetary nebulae sets in by the end of the asymptotic giant\nbranch phase, most likely by axisymmetric superwind mass loss. Moreover, both\nsurveys yielded two morphological classes which have one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the two surveys, indicating that the optical depth of circumstellar\ndust shells plays an equally important role as the inclination angle in\ndetermining the morphology of the PPN shells.\n", "  We investigate spatial distributions of specific dust components in the\ncircumstellar shells of a proto-planetary nebula candidate, HD 179821, and a\nplanetary nebula, BD$+30^{\\circ}$3639, by means of spectral imaging. With\nhigh-resolution ground-based images and ISO spectra in the mid-infrared, we can\nderive ``dust feature only'' maps by subtracting synthesized continuum maps\nfrom the observed images at the feature wavelength. Such spatially detailed\ninformation will help to develop models for the evolution of dust grains around\nevolved stars.\n", "  Bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe), as well as extreme elliptical PNe are formed\nthrough the influence of a stellar companion. But half of all PN progenitors\nare not influenced by any stellar companion, and, as I show here, are expected\nto rotate very slowly on reaching the upper asymptotic giant branch; hence they\nexpect to form spherical PNe, unless they are spun-up. But since most PNe are\nnot spherical, I argue that about 50 percents of AGB stars are spun-up by\nplanets, even planets having a mass as low as 0.01 times the mass of Jupiter,\nso they form elliptical PNe. The rotation by itself will not deform the AGB\nwind, but may trigger another process that will lead to axisymmetric mass loss,\ne.g., weak magnetic activity, as in the cool magnetic spots model. This model\nalso explains the transition from spherical to axisymmetric mass loss on the\nupper AGB. For such low mass planets to substantially spin-up the stellar\nenvelope, they should enter the envelope when the star reaches the upper AGB.\nThis \"fine-tuning\" can be avoided if there are several planets on average\naround each star, as is the case in the solar system, so that one of them is\nengulfed when the star reaches the upper AGB.\n", "  Double lined spectroscopic binaries in an evolved stage of evolution are\nexpected to be extremely rare since they must consist of equally luminous and\nthus almost equally evolved objects, which requires an extremely similar\ninitial mass. In this contribution we discuss such rare double evolved SB2\nsystem: HD172481. This binary includes an F-type post-AGB object and an M-type\nAGB companion. The spectrum shows a surprisingly strong LiI 670.8nm line with\nan equivalent width of 54mA yielding a lithium abundance of log(Li)=3.6.\nSeveral explanations for this huge lithium content are explored.\n", "  We have investigated the infrared properties of a sample of objects with IRAS\ncolors typical of planetary nebulae. The selected objects have not yet evolved\nto the planetary nebula stage since they have no detectable radio continuum\nemission and they are therefore likely post-AGB stars.\n", "  A sample of J-type carbon stars was searched for OH maser emission. The new\ndetection of three OH lines towards two silicate carbon stars is reported. In\nV778 Cyg, previously known as the main-lines (1665 and 1667 MHz) maser source,\nthe satellite 1612 MHz emission was discovered while in NSV 2814 the main OH\nlines were detected. The presence of OH maser lines confirms the former\nsuggestion that oxygen-rich material is located in the vicinity ($\\approx$\n$10^{15-16}$ cm) of silicate carbon stars.\n", "  We present the results of a spatial correlation analysis between unidentified\ngamma-ray sources in the 3EG catalog and candidates to supernova remnants. This\nwork extends a previous study made by Romero, Benaglia & Torres (1999). We also\nconsider the gamma-ray emission variability and the spectral index for the\nsources with positional coincidence.\n", "  WFPC2 images obtained with the Hubble Space telescope 4.16 years apart have\nallowed us to measure the proper motion of the metal rich globular cluster NGC\n6553 with respect to the background bulge stars. With a space velocity of\n(${\\Pi}, {\\Theta}, W$) = (-3.5, 230, -3) km s$^{-1}$, NGC 6553 follows the mean\nrotation of both disk and bulge stars at a Galactocentric distance of 2.7 kpc.\nWhile the kinematics of the cluster is consistent with either a bulge or a disk\nmembership, the virtual identity of its stellar population with that of the\nbulge cluster NGC6528 makes its bulge membership more likely. The astrometric\naccuracy is high enough for providing a measure of the bulge proper motion\ndispersion and confirming its rotation. A selection of stars based on the\nproper motions produced an extremely well defined cluster color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD), essencially free of bulge stars. The improved turnoff definition\nin the decontaminated CMD confirms an old age for the cluster (~13 Gyr)\nindicating that the bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment while being\nbuilt up at in the early Universe. An additional interesting feature of the\ncluster color-magnitude diagram is a significant number of blue stragglers\nstars, whose membership in the cluster is firmly established from their proper\nmotions.\n", "  Structural and chemical changes during the AGB and post-AGB evolution are\ndiscussed with respect to two recent observational and theoretical findings. On\nthe one hand, high-resolution infrared observations revealed details of the\ndynamical evolution of the fragmented, bipolar dust shell around the\nfar-evolved carbon star IRC+10216 giving evidence for rapid changes of an\nalready PPN-like structure during the very end of the AGB evolution. On the\nother hand, stellar evolution calculations considering convective overshoot\nhave shown how thermal pulses during the post-AGB stage lead to the formation\nof hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars with abundance patterns consistent with\nthose observed for Wolf-Rayet central stars.\n", "  We present X-ray and radio studies of sources which are brightabove 1 GeV\n(F_{>1GeV} > 4e-8 ph/cm^2/s. Only 11 out of ~30 of these gamma-ray sources have\nbeen identified with lower energy counterparts: 5 blazars and 6 pulsars. Three\nof these pulsars are surrounded by radio pulsar wind nebulae (PWN), two of\nwhich are also seen as bright, extended X-ray synchrotron nebulae. The ASCA\nX-ray telescope has observed 28 of the bright GeV sources, revealing an excess\nof F_{2-10keV} > 10e-12 ergs/cm^2/s sources within the {\\it EGRET} error\ncontours of the unidentified sources. Although several supernova remnants are\npositionally coincident with these sources, we find no X-ray evidence of high\nenergy particle production in SNR shell shocks consistent with the GeV\npositions. We also present initial results from follow on radio imaging studies\nof several fields containing unidentified sources. We have discovered new\nX-ray/radio nebulae in three of these fields which are strong candidates for\nPWN. These sources, along with a similar nebula in CTA 1 and the PWN around PSR\nB1853+01 in W44, are all positionally coincident with variable EGRET sources.\nThis suggests a class of variable gamma-ray sources associated with synchrotron\nemitting regions powered by the winds of young pulsars.\n", "  Although the majority of gamma-ray sources still remain unidentified, we have\nvarious kinds of information to characterize the observational properties of\nunidentified EGRET sources. Despite astronomical properties like locations of\nindividual sources or the collective arrangement of the class as such, the nine\nyears of CGRO observations provide the ability to investigate flux variability\nat different timescales, enable us to perform periodicity searches, determine\ngamma-ray source spectra between 30 MeV and 10 GeV and even investigate\nspectral variability. The basic observational properties of unidentified\nhigh-energy gamma-ray sources discovered by EGRET are reviewed. Various\ninstrumental and observational peculiarities affecting the interpretation of\nthe EGRET data are pointed out, also describing the way such biases might\naffect scientific conclusions drawn from the EGRET data.\n", "  I discuss recent new models of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stellar\nevolution. These models aim to clarify the evolutionary origin and status of a\nvariety of hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars such as central stars of planetary\nnebulae of Wolf-Rayet spectral type, PG1159 stars or Sakurai's object. Starting\nwith AGB models with overshoot such stars can evolve through one of four\ndistinct channels. Each of these channels has typical abundance patterns\ndepending on the relative timing of the departure from the AGB and the\noccurrence of the last thermal pulse. I discuss the responsible mechanisms and\nobservational counterparts.\n", "  The symbiotic Mira, RX Pup, shows long-term variations in its mean light\nlevel due to variable obscuration by circumstellar dust. The last increase in\nextinction towards the Mira, between 1995 and 2000, has been accompanied by\nlarge changes in the degree of polarization in the optical and red spectral\nrange. The lack of any obvious associated changes in the position angle may\nindicate the polarization variations are driven by changes in the properties of\nthe dust grains (e.g. variable quantity of dust and variable particle size\ndistribution, due to dust grain formation and growth) rather than changes in\nthe viewing geometry of the scattering region(s), e.g. due to the binary\nrotation.\n", "  We discuss three aspects of post-AGB (PAGB) stars in old populations. (1) HST\nphotometry of the nucleus of the planetary nebula (PN) K 648 in the globular\ncluster (GC) M15 implies a mass of 0.60 Msun, in contrast to the mean masses of\nwhite dwarfs in GCs of ~0.5 Msun. This suggests that K 648 is descended from a\nmerged binary, and we infer that single Pop II stars do not produce visible\nPNe. (2) Yellow PAGB stars are the visually brightest stars in old populations\n(Mv ~ -3.3) and are easily recognizable because of their large Balmer jumps;\nthus they show great promise as a Pop II standard candle. Two yellow PAGB stars\nin the GC NGC 5986 have the same V magnitudes to within +/-0.05 mag, supporting\nan expected narrow luminosity function. (3) Using CCD photometry and a u filter\nlying below the Balmer jump, we have detected yellow PAGB stars in the halo of\nM31 and in its dwarf elliptical companion NGC 205. With the Milky Way zero\npoint, we reproduce the Cepheid distance to M31, and find that NGC 205 is ~100\nkpc further away than M31. The star counts imply a yellow PAGB lifetime of\nabout 25,000 yr, and their luminosities imply masses near 0.53 Msun.\n", "  The study of elemental abundances in Damped Lyman Alpha systems (DLAs) at\nhigh redshift represents one of our best opportunities to probe galaxy\nformation and chemical evolution at early times. By coupling measurements made\nin high z DLAs with our knowledge of abundances determined locally and with\nnucleosynthetic models, we can start to piece together the star formation\nhistories of these galaxies. Here, we discuss the clues to galactic chemical\nevolution that may be gleaned from studying the abundance of Co in DLAs. We\npresent high resolution echelle spectra of two QSOs, Q2206-199 and Q1223+17,\nboth already known to exhibit intervening damped systems. These observations\nhave resulted in the first ever detection of Co at high redshift, associated\nwith the z= 1.92 DLA in the sightline towards Q2206-199. We find that the\nabundance of Co is approximately 1/4 solar and that there is a clear\noverabundance relative to iron, [Co/Fe] = +0.31 +/- 0.05. From the abundance of\nZn, we determine that this is a relatively metal-rich DLA, with a metallicity\napproximately 1/3 solar. Therefore, this first detection of Co is similar to\nthe marked overabundance relative to Fe seen in Galactic bulge and thick disk\nstars.\n", "  Using a cosmological galactic evolutionary approach to model the Milky Way,\nwe calculate the star formation history (SFH) of the solar neighborhood. The\ngood agreement we obtain with the observational inferences suggests that our\nphysical model describes accurately the long term/large spatial trends of the\nlocal and global Milky Way SFH. In this model, star formation is triggered by\ndisk gravitational instabilities and self-regulated by an energy balance in the\nISM. The drivers of the SFH are the cosmological gas infall rate and the gas\nsurface density determined by the primordial spin parameter. A LambdaCDM\ncosmology was used throughout.\n", "  Galaxy redshift surveys and Cosmic Microwave Background experiments are\nundertaken with larger and larger teams, in a fashion reminiscent of particle\nphysics experiments and the human genome projects. We discuss the role of young\nresearchers, the issue of multiple authorship, and ways to communicate\neffectively in teams of tens to hundreds of collaborators.\n", "  We list a few things that we do not understand about stars and that most\npeople ignore. These are all hard problems. We can learn more cosmology by\nworking on them to reduce the systematic errors they introduce than by trying\nto derive cosmological results that are highly uncertain.\n", "  We summarize recent advances in the determination of the cosmic history of\nstar formation and other properties of high-z galaxies, and the relevance of\nthis information in our understanding of the formation of structures. We\nemphasize the importance of dust reprocessing in the high--z universe, as\ndemonstrated in particular by IR and sub-mm data. This demand a panchromatic\napproach to observations and suitable modelling tools. We spend also some words\non expectations from future instruments.\n", "  Star forming galaxies exhibit a variety of physical conditions, from\nquiescent normal spirals to the most powerful dusty starbursts. In order to\nstudy these complex systems, we need a suitable tool to analyze the information\ncoming from observations at all wavelengths. We present a new\nspectro-photometric model which considers in a consistent way starlight as\nreprocessed by gas and dust. We discuss preliminary results to interpret some\nobserved properties of VLIRGs.\n", "  OPTICON, the ICN Optical Infrared Coordination Network for Astronomy, brings\ntogether for the first time the operators of all Europe's medium to large\noptical-infrared telescopes, the largest corresponding data archives, and\nseveral user representatives. The OPTICON partners work with their communities\nto identify those major challenges for the future development of European\noptical-infrared astronomy which require Europe-wide collaboration. OPTICON\nsponsors and coordinates developments towards these goals, involving the entire\nastronomical community through workshops and meetings targeted towards these\nagreed common goals of general importance.\n", "  In the context of the star formation through the fragmentation of an\nextremely metal-deficient protogalactic cloud, the gravitational collapse of\nfilamentary gas clouds is explored with H$_2$ and HD chemistry. It is found by\n1D hydrodynamical simulations that the cloud evolution is prescribed mainly by\nthe initial density ($n_0$) and H$_2$ abundance ($x_{\\rm H_2,0}$). In\nparticular, it turns out that the evolution of low-density filaments ($n_0\n\\lesssim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) bifurcates at a critical H$_2$ abundance of $x_{\\rm\nH_2,cr}\\simeq 3\\times 10^{-3}$, beyond which HD cooling overwhelms H$_2$\ncooling. The numerical results indicate that the stellar IMF is likely to be\ndouble-peaked and deficient in sub-solar mass stars, where the high mass peak\nof the IMF is around $10M_\\odot$ or $10^2M_\\odot$, dependently on the initial\ndensity and H$_2$ abundance. If the gas in protogalactic clouds is photoionized\nby UV radiation or shock-heated, the H$_2$ abundance could exceed\n  $x_{\\rm H_2,cr}\\simeq 3\\times 10^{-3}$ by H$^-$ reactions. Then, the high\nmass peak would be $O(10) M_\\odot$.\n", "  The fitting atmosphere parameters (Teff, g, and [Fe/H]) for over 300 stars in\nthe Gunn & Striker and Jacoby et al. catalogs have been obtained relying on the\nKurucz (1992) ATLAS9 and Hauschildt et al (1999) NextGen5 synthesis models. The\noutput results are compared, and a critical appraisal of both theoretical codes\nis performed.\n", "  Images from the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) North and South show a large\npercentage of dusty, high redshift galaxies whose appearance falls outside\ntraditional classification systems. The nature of these objects is not yet\nfully understood. Since the HDF preferentially samples restframe UV light, HDF\nmorphologies are not dust or `mask' penetrated. The appearance of high redshift\ngalaxies at near-infrared restframes remains a challenge for the New\nMillennium. The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) could routinely provide\nus with such images. In this contribution, we quantitatively determine the\ndust-penetrated structures of high redshift galaxies such as NGC 922 in their\nnear-infrared restframes. We show that such optically peculiar objects may\nreadily be classified using the dust penetrated z ~ 0 templates of Block and\nPuerari (1999) and Buta and Block (2001).\n", "  We derived Lick narrow-band indices for 139 candidate super metal-rich stars\nof different luminosity class previously studied in Malagnini et al. (2000).\nIndices include Iron Fe50, Fe52, Fe53, and Magnesium Mgb and Mg2 features. By\ncomparing observations with Kurucz' synthetic model atmospheres, no evidence is\nfound for non-standard Mg vs. Fe relative abundance (i.e. [Mg/Fe]~ 0, on the\naverage, for our sample). A comparison with the Worthey et al.(1994) and\nBuzzoni et al.(1992, 1994) fitting function predictions for [Fe/H] > 0 is\nperformed and briefly discussed.\n", "  The effect of redshift on the observation of distant galaxies is briefly\ndiscussed emphasizing the possible sources of bias in the interpretation of\nhigh-z data. A general energetic criterion to assess physical self-consistency\nof evolutionary population synthesis models is also proposed, for a more\nappropriate use of this important tool to investigate distinctive properties of\nprimeval galaxies.\n", "  We present preliminary results of a large project aimed at creating an\nextended theoretical and observational database of stellar spectra in the\nultraviolet wavelength range. This library will consist of IUE spectra at low\nand high resolution, and a set of LTE and NLTE theoretical fluxes. A first grid\nof 50 model fluxes with solar metallicity, in the wavelength interval 1000 -\n4400 AA, is reported here. Calculations are based on the Kurucz (1993) SYNTHE\ncode. The models span effective temperatures between 10,000 K and 50,000 K, and\na surface gravity in the range 2.5 <= log g <= 5.0 dex.\n", "  We discuss the first results from ongoing studies of the resolved stellar\npopulations in the outskirts of our nearest large neighbour, M31. Deep\nHST/WFPC2 archival observations are used to construct colour-magnitude-diagrams\nwhich reach well below the horizontal branch at selected locations in the outer\ndisk and halo, while a panoramic ground-based imaging survey maps spatial\ndensity variations through resolved star counts to a projected radius of ~50\nkpc.\n", "  Recent observations have revealed that early-type galaxies (ETG) in clusters\ncomprise an old galaxy population that is evolving passively. We review some\nrecent observations from the ground and from HST that show that ETG have\nundergone a significant amount of luminosity evolution. This evolution is\ntraced by two projections of the fundamental plane (FP): the size-magnitude\nrelation (SMR) and the color-magnitude relation (CMR). We will briefly discuss\nthe relevance of all these results in the context of the universality of the\nIMF.\n", "  Approximately four thousand light curves of red variable stars in the LMC\nwere selected from the 2.3-years duration MOA database by a period analysis\nusing the Phase Dispersion Minimization method. Their optical features\n(amplitudes, periodicities, position in CMD) were investigated. Stars with\nlarge amplitues and high periodicities were distributed on the only one strip\namongst multiple structure on the LMC period-luminosity relation. In the CMD,\nthe five strips were located in the order of the period. The stars with\ncharacterized light curves were also discussed.\n", "  The prevailing evidence suggests that most large-amplitude AGB variables\nfollow the period luminosity (PL) relation that has been established for Miras\nin the LMC and galactic globular clusters. Hipparcos observations indicate that\nmost Miras in the solar neighbourhood are consistent with such a relation.\nThere are two groups of stars with luminosities that are apparently greater\nthan the PL relation would predict: (1) in the LMC and SMC there are large\namplitude variables, with long periods, P> 420 days, which are probably\nundergoing hot bottom burning, but which are very clearly more luminous than\nthe PL relation (these are visually bright and are likely to be among the first\nstars discovered in more distant intermediate age populations); (2) in the\nsolar neighbourhood there are short period, P<235 days, red stars which are\nprobably more luminous than the PL relation. Similar short-period red stars,\nwith high luminosities, have not been identified in the Magellanic Clouds.\n", "  The galactic kinematics of Mira variables derived from radial velocities,\nHipparcos proper motions and an infrared period-luminosity relation are\nreviewed. Local Miras in the 145-200day period range show a large asymmetric\ndrift and a high net outward motion in the Galaxy. Interpretations of this\nphenomenon are considered and (following Feast and Whitelock 2000) it is\nsuggested that they are outlying members of the bulge-bar population and\nindicate that this bar extends beyond the solar circle.\n", "  Most dusty winds are described by a set of similarity functions of a single\nindependent variable that can be chosen as the overall optical depth at visual.\nThe self-similarity implies general scaling relations among the system\nparameters, in agreement with observations. Dust drift through the gas has a\nmajor impact on the structure of most winds.\n", "  Based on a refined generic dynamical model, we investigate afterglows from\njetted gamma-ray burst (GRB) remnants numerically. In the relativistic phase,\nthe light curve break could marginally be seen. However, an obvious break does\nexist at the transition from the relativistic phase to the non-relativistic\nphase, which typically occurs at time 10 to 30 days. It is very interesting\nthat the break is affected by many parameters, especially by the electron\nenergy fraction (xi_e), and the magnetic energy fraction (xi_B^2). Implication\nof orphan afterglow surveys on GRB beaming is investigated. The possible\nexistence of a kind of cylindrical jets is also discussed.\n", "  There are three important aspects concerning the study of the red giant and\nin particular of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Magellanic\nClouds. These are: the surface distribution, the luminosity function and the\nvariability. The spatial distribution of AGB stars is an efficient tool to\nstudy the structure of the galaxies and their metalicity by analysing the ratio\nbetween carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars. The shape of the luminosity function\ncarries informations about the star formation rate in the Clouds and it can be\nmathematically related to their history. Most AGB stars vary their magnitude in\na few to several hundred years time; the one epoch DENIS magnitudes for both\nLarge and Small Magellanic Cloud AGB stars outline the same relations as a\nfunction of period.\n", "  We present FUSE observations of OVI absorption in a sample of 100\nextragalactic targets and 2 distant halo stars. We describe the details of the\ncalibration, alignment in velocity, continuum fitting, and manner in which\ncontaminants were removed (Galactic H2, absorption intrinsic to the background\ntarget and intergalactic Ly-beta lines). We searched for OVI absorption in the\nvelocity range -1200 to 1200 km/s. With a few exceptions, we only find OVI\nbetween -400 and 400 km/s; the exceptions may be intergalactic OVI. We discuss\nthe separation of the observed OVI absorption into components associated with\nthe Galactic halo and components at high-velocity, which are probably located\nin the neighborhood of the Galaxy. We describe the measurements of equivalent\nwidth and column density, and we analyze the different contributions to the\nerrors. We conclude that low-velocity Galactic OVI absorption occurs along all\nsightlines - the few non-detections only occur in noisy spectra. We further\nshow that high-velocity OVI is very common, having equivalent width >65 mAA in\n50% of the sightlines and >30 mAA in 70% of the high-quality sightlines. The\nhigh-velocity OVI absorption has velocities relative to the LSR of\n+/-(100--330) km/s; there is no correlation between velocity and absorption\nstrength. We present 50 km/s wide OVI channel maps. These show evidence for the\nimprint of Galactic rotation. They also highlight two known HI high-velocity\nclouds (complex~C and the Magellanic Stream). The channel maps further show\nthat OVI at velocities <-200 km/s occurs along all sightlines in the region\nl=20-150, b<-30, while OVI at velocities >200 km/s occurs along all sightlines\nin the region l=180-300, b>20 (abbreviated).\n", "  We present the first results of our 3D Monte Carlo maser radiative transfer\ncode, used to model the 1612 MHz OH maser shell and the amplification of\nemission from the stellar radio-photosphere.\n", "  We present the first circular polarization measurements of circumstellar\nwater masers around a sample of late-type stars. These observations are used to\nobtain the magnetic field strength in the water maser region with both an LTE\nand non-LTE analysis. We find fields from a few hundred milliGauss up to a few\nGauss, indicating a solar-type r^(-2) dependence of the magnetic field on the\ndistance. No linear polarization is detected to less than 1%.\n", "  The circumstellar masers around evolved stars offer an interesting\npossibility to measure stellar parameters through VLBI astrometry. In this\npaper the application of this technique is discussed, including the accuracy\nand the uncertainties of the method. The different maser species (OH, H_2O,\nSiO) have slightly different characteristics and applications. This paper does\nnot concern astrometry of maser spots to study the kinematics of the envelope,\nbut concentrates on attempting to measure the motion of the underlying star.\n", "  Our multi-wavelength model GRASIL for the SED of galaxies is described, in\nparticular the recent extension to the radio and X-ray range. With our model we\ncan study different aspects of galaxy evolution by exploiting all available\nspectral observations, where different emission components dominate.\n", "  Recent models of galactic chemical evolution account for updated evolutionary\nmodels of massive stars (with special emphasis on stellar winds) and for the\neffects of intermediate mass and massive binaries. The results are summarised.\nWe also present a critical discussion on possible effects of stellar rotation\non overall galactic chemical evolutionary simulations.\n", "  Comparisons of the kinematics of Mg II absorbing gas and the stellar rotation\ncurves in 0.5 < z < 1.0 spiral galaxies suggests that, at least in some cases,\nthe extended gaseous envelopes may be dynamically coupled to the stellar\nmatter. A strong correlation exists between the overall kinematic spread of Mg\nII absorbing gas and C IV absorption strength, and therefore kinematics of the\nhigher-ionization gas. Taken together, the data may suggest a \"halo/disk\nconnection\" between z~1 galaxies and their extended gaseous envelopes. Though\nthe number of galaxies in our sample are few, there are no clear examples that\nsuggest the gas is accreting/infalling isotropically about the galaxies from\nthe intergalactic medium.\n", "  Not the way one might have thought. In hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy\nformation, some gas follows the traditionally envisioned route, shock heating\nto the halo virial temperature before cooling to the much lower temperature of\nthe neutral ISM. But most gas enters galaxies without ever heating close to the\nvirial temperature, gaining thermal energy from weak shocks and adiabatic\ncompression, and radiating it just as quickly. This ``cold mode'' accretion is\nchanneled along filaments, while the conventional, ``hot mode'' accretion is\nquasi-spherical. Cold mode accretion dominates high redshift growth by a\nsubstantial factor, while at z<1 the overall accretion rate declines and hot\nmode accretion has greater relative importance. The decline of the cosmic star\nformation rate at low z is driven largely by geometry, as the typical cross\nsection of filaments begins to exceed that of the galaxies at their\nintersections.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new HI ring around the S0 galaxy NGC 1533. The\nring orbits at a radius of 35 kpc, well outside the optical extent of the\ngalaxy. We have conducted N-body/SPH numerical simulations to show this HI ring\ncould be the merger remnant of a tidally destroyed galaxy. We find no optical\ncomponent associated with the HI ring. However, observations hint at H-alpha\nemission associated with the SE part of the ring only. The H-alpha is in the\nform of a few very small isolated emission line regions. The large HI velocity\ndispersions (up to 30 km/s) and velocity gradients (up to 50 km/s/kpc) in this\nregion indicate the H-alpha emission could be due to star formation triggered\nby clouds colliding within the ring.\n", "  We study the chemo-dynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies and their hot\nX-ray emitting gas using high-resolution cosmological simulations. Our Tree\nN-body/SPH code includes a self-consistent treatment of radiative cooling, star\nformation, supernovae feedback, and chemical enrichment. We present a series of\nLCDM cosmological simulations which trace the spatial and temporal evolution of\nheavy element abundance patterns in both the stellar and gas components of\ngalaxies. X-ray spectra of the hot gas are constructed via the use of the\nvmekal plasma model, and analysed using XSPEC with the XMM EPN response\nfunction. Simulation end-products are quantitatively compared with the\nobservational data in both the X-ray and optical regime. We find that radiative\ncooling is important to interpret the observed X-ray luminosity, temperature,\nand metallicity of the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies. However,\nthis cooled gas also leads to excessive star formation at low redshift, and\ntherefore results in underlying galactic stellar populations which are too blue\nwith respect to observations.\n", "  An adaptive multi grid approach to simulating the formation of structure from\ncollisionless dark matter is described. MLAPM (Multi-Level Adaptive Particle\nMesh) is one of the most efficient serial codes available on the cosmological\n'market' today. As part of Swinburne University's role in the development of\nthe Square Kilometer Array, we are implementing hydrodynamics, feedback, and\nradiative transfer within the MLAPM adaptive mesh, in order to simulate\nbaryonic processes relevant to the interstellar and intergalactic media at high\nredshift. We will outline our progress to date in applying the existing MLAPM\nto a study of the decay of satellite galaxies within massive host potentials.\n", "  The study of shapes of the images of objects is an important issue not only\nbecause it reveals its dynamical state but also it helps to understand the\nobject's evolutionary history. We discuss a new technique in cosmological image\nanalysis which is based on a set of non-parametric shape descriptors known as\nthe Minkowski Functionals (MFs). These functionals are extremely versatile and\nunder some conditions give a complete description of the geometrical properties\nof objects. We believe that MFs could be a useful tool to extract information\nabout the shapes of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and superclusters. The\ninformation revealed by MFs can be utilized along with the knowledge obtained\nfrom currently popular methods and thus could improve our understanding of the\ntrue shapes of cosmological objects.\n", "  I analyze the properties of the first galaxies in cosmological simulations\nwith radiative feedback. Preliminary results indicate similarities with the\nobserved properties of the bulk of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the\nLocal Group and Andromeda. I briefly discuss observational tests that could\nhelp in understanding the impact of a population of small primordial objects on\nthe cosmic evolution.\n", "  We present a new approach to doing Eulerian computational fluid dynamics that\nis designed to work at high Mach numbers encountered in hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the IGM. In conventional Eulerian CFD, the thermal energy is\npoorly tracked in supersonic bulk flows where local fluid variables cannot be\naccurately separated from the much larger bulk flow components. We described a\nmethod in which local fluid quantities can be directly tracked and the Eulerian\nfluid equations solved in a local frame moving with the flow. The new algorithm\nhas been used to run large hydrodynamical simulations on a 1024^3 grid to study\nthe kinetic SZ effect. The KSZ power spectrum is broadly peaked at l~10^4 with\ntemperature fluctuations on micro Kelvin levels.\n", "  Recently, with the Chandra X-ray Telescope we have detected several local\nX-ray absorption lines along lines-of-sight towards distant quasars. These\nabsorption lines are produced by warm/hot gas located in local intergalactic\nspace and/or in our Galaxy. I will present our observations and discuss the\norigin of the X-ray absorption and its implications in probing the warm/hot\ncomponent of local baryons.\n", "  We present Chandra observations that provide the most direct evidence to date\nfor the pervasive, moderate density, shock-heated intergalactic medium\npredicted by leading cosmological scenarios. We also comment briefly on future\nobservations with Constellation-X.\n", "  X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM are providing valuable new\nmeasurements of the baryonic and dark matter content of groups and clusters.\nMasses of cD clusters obtained from X-ray and gravitational lensing studies\ngenerally show good agreement, therefore providing important validation of both\nmethods. Gas fractions have been obtained for several clusters that verify\nprevious results for a low matter density (Omega_m ~0.3). Chandra has also\nprovided measurements of the mass profiles deep down into several cluster cores\nand has generally found no significant deviations from CDM predictions in\ncontrast to the flat core density profiles inferred from the rotation curves of\nlow-surface brightness galaxies and dwarf galaxies; i.e., there is no evidence\nfor self-interacting dark matter in cluster cores. Finally, initial studies of\nthe iron and silicon abundances in centrally E-dominated groups show that they\nhave pronounced gradients from 1-2 solar values within the central 30-50 kpc\nthat fall to values of 0.3-0.5 solar at larger radii. The Si/Fe ratios are\nconsistent with approximately 80% of the metals originating from Type Ia\nsupernovae. Several cD clusters also display central Fe enhancements suggestive\nof Type Ia supernova enrichment, though some have central dips that may provide\na vital clue for solving the cooling flow mystery.\n", "  Our extremely deep survey for extragalactic HI (HIDEEP) finds no\nintergalactic gas clouds, and no galaxies with HI at inferred global\ncolumn-densities below 10^20 cm^-2 when we could have detected such objects\ndown to a completeness limit of 4 x 10^18 cm^-2. We speculate that low\nsurface-density hydrogen is either ionised or locked up in ``frozen discs'',\ni.e. structures where the local Ly-alpha is insufficient to excite the 21-cm\ntransition to a spin-temperature above the cosmic background. Such ``frozen\ndiscs'' might be responsible for many QSOALSs.\n", "  We have constructed samples of low-ionization metal absorption-line systems\nselected for the strength of their MgII lambda2796 lines from the SDSS EDR.\nThere are 640 absorption systems in our unbiased sample with lambda2796 REW >\n1.0 A detected at 5 sigma and with redshifts 0.37 < z < 2.27. This sample is an\norder of magnitude larger than previous similarly selected samples. In this\ncontribution, we present preliminary results on the statistical properties of\nthe sample.\n", "  We detail a powerful indirect method for the study of damped Lyman alpha\nsystems (DLAs) at low redshift. We increase the probability of finding a\nlow-redshift DLA to nearly 50% by targeting QSOs that are known to have strong\nlow-redshift MgII and FeII absorption lines in their spectra. We are using\nSloan Digital Sky Survey QSO spectra complemented by a survey we are conducting\nat the MMT to study the metal-line systems. The Hubble Space Telescope is being\nused to confirm low-redshift DLAs. In addition, we are imaging low-redshift DLA\ngalaxies with several ground-based telescopes to directly study their\nenvironments.\n", "  Recent achievements of bare strange stars are briefly reviewed. A nascent\nprotostrange star should be bare because of strong mass ejection and high\ntemperature after the supernova detonation flame, and a crust can also hardly\nform except for a super-Eddington accretion. The magnetosphere of a bare\nstrange star is composed mainly of electron-positron pair plasma, where both\ninner and outer vacuum gaps work for radio as well as high energy nonthermal\nemission. A featureless thermal spectrum is expected since no ion is above the\nquark surface, whilst electron cyclotron lines could appear in some bare\nstrange stars with suitable magnetic fields. Various astrophysical implications\nof bare strange stars are discussed.\n", "  There is growing evidence that soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous\nX-ray pulsars (AXPs) are isolated neutron stars with superstrong magnetic\nfields, i.e., magnetars, marking them a distinguished species from the\nconventional species of spindown-powered isolated neutron stars, i.e., radio\npulsars. The current arguments in favor of the magnetar interpretation of\nSGR/AXP phenomenology will be outlined, and the two energy sources in\nmagnetars, i.e. a magnetic dissipation energy and a spindown energy, will be\nreviewed. I will then discuss a missing link between magnetars and pulsars,\ni.e., lack of the observational evidence of the spindown-powered behaviors in\nknown magnetars. Some recent theoretical efforts in studying such behaviors\nwill be reviewed along with some predictions testable in the near future.\n", "  A technique of timescale analysis performed directly in the time domain has\nbeen developed recently. We have applied the technique to studying rapid\nvariabilities of hard X-rays from neutron star and black hole binaries,\ngamma-ray bursts and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. The results indicate that\nthe time domain method of spectral analysis is a powerful tool in revealing the\nunderlying physics in high-energy processes in objects.\n", "  For an accretion disk around a black hole, the strong relativistic effects\naffect every aspect of the radiation from the disk, including its spectrum,\nlight-curve, and image. This work investigates in detail how the images of a\nthin disk around a black hole will be distorted, and what the observer will see\nfrom different viewing angles and in different energy bands.\n", "  We have developed a timing analysis method to determine the distances of\nvariable galactic X-ray sources based on the method advanced by Tr\\\"{u}mper and\nSch\\\"{o}nfelder in 1973. The light-curve of the halo produced by the scattering\nof X-rays off the interstellar dust is delayed and smeared by the dust grains.\nThis method utilizes the differences between the power density spectra of the\npoint source and the halo. We present the details of this method and our first\napplications of this method to the Chandra data of X-ray binary Cyg X-3.\n", "  We have collected from the literature a list of early-type stars, situated at\nlarge distances from the galactic plane, for which evidence of youth seems\nconvincing. We discuss two possible formation mechanisms for these stars:\nejection from the plane by dynamical interactions within small clusters, and\nformation away from the plane, via induced shocks created by spiral density\nwaves. We identify the stars that could be explained by each mechanism. We\nconclude that the ejection mechanism can account for about two thirds of the\nstars, while a combination of star formation at z = 500-800 pc from the plane\nand ejection, can account for 90 percent of these stars. Neither mechanism, nor\nboth together, can explain the most extreme examples.\n", "  Lyman alpha absorber correlations contain information about the underlying\ndensity distribution associated with a particular class of absorbers. As such,\nthey provide an opportunity to independently measure the \"bias\" of the Lyman\nalpha forest, i.e. the relationship between HI column density and underlying\ndark matter density. In these proceedings we use hydrodynamic simulations to\ninvestigate whether the evolution of this bias is measurable from observable\ncorrelations. Unfortunately, the increasingly complex physics in the IGM at z<1\nmakes a direct measurement of the bias difficult. Nevertheless, current\nsimulations do make predictions for HI absorber correlations that are in broad\nagreement with observations at both high and low redshift, thus reinforcing the\nbias evolution predictions given by these models.\n", "  Recent observations with the dispersive X-ray spectrometers aboard Chandra\nand Newton Observatory have begun to probe the properties of the X-ray\nintergalactic medium (IGM) at small redshifts. Using large quantities (~950\nksec) of spectroscopic data acquired using the RGS aboard Newton Observatory,\nwe investigated the intervening material toward three low redshift, high\nGalactic latitude AGNs with nominally featureless spectra: Mrk421, PKS2155-304\nand 3C273. Each spectrum provides clear evidence for what appears to be a local\n(z~0), highly ionized absorbing medium betrayed by the OVII 1s-2p resonance\ntransition feature seen at 21.6A (N[OVII] ~ 1E16 cm-2). Measurements are also\nmade for the Lyman alpha transition of the adjacent ionization state, (OVIII;\n18.97A), which potentially constrains the absorber's temperature. Finally, in a\ncollisional equilibrium approximation, upper limits to diffuse emission\nintensities place upper limits on the electron density (ne < 2E-4 cm-3), lower\nlimits on the scale length of the absorber (L > 140 kpc) and lower limits on\nits mass (M > 5E10 M[sun]). Limits on the absorber's scale length and its\nvelocity distribution lead us to identify it with the Local Group.\n"]}
