We discuss the dissipative Hofstadter model in the framework\nof the boundary state formulation in string theory and construct exact boundary\nstates for the model at the magic points by using the fermion representation.\nThe dissipative Hofstadter model at magic points is shown to be equivalent to\nthe critical boundary sine-Gordon model.\n", "  The new symmetry axis of a well-behaved electromagnetic beam advanced in\npaper Physical Review A 78, 063831 (2008) is not purely a mathematical concept.\nThe experimental result reported by Hosten and Kwiat in paper Science 319, 787\n(2008) is shown to demonstrate the existence of this symmetry axis that is\nneither perpendicular nor parallel to the propagation axis.\n", "  Cylindrically symmetric electron beams in spin polarization are reported for\nthe first time. They are shown to be the eigen states of total angular momentum\nin the $z$ direction. But they are neither the eigen states of spin nor the\neigen states of orbital angular momentum in that direction.\n", "  Using elastic and inelastic neutron scattering techniques with and without\napplication of an external magnetic field $H$, the magnetic ground states of\nZn$_x$Co$_{4-x}$(OD)$_6$Cl$_2$ ($x=0,1$) were studied. Our results show that\nfor $x=0$, the ground state is a magnetic long-range ordered (LRO) state where\neach tetrahedron forms an \"umbrella\"-type structure. On the other hand, for\n$x=1$, no static ordering was observed down to 1.5 K, which resembles the\nbehavior found in the isostructural quantum system\nZn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OD)$_6$Cl$_2$. When $H$ field is applied, however the $x=1$\nsystem develops the same LRO state as $x=0$. This indicates that the $x=1$\ndisordered state is in the vicinity of the $x=0$ ordered state.\n", "  The scale-dependent galaxy bias generated by primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG)\ncan be used to detect and constrain deviations from standard single-field\ninflation. The strongest signal is expected in the local model for PNG, where\nthe amplitude of non-Gaussianity can be expressed by a set of parameters (fnl,\ngnl, ...). Current observational constraints from galaxy clustering on fnl and\ngnl assume that the others PNG parameters are vanishing. Using two sets of\ncosmological N-body simulations where both fnl and gnl are non-zero, we show\nthat this strong assumption generally leads to biased estimates and spurious\nredshift dependencies of the parameters. Additionally, if the signs of fnl and\ngnl are opposite, the amplitude of the scale-dependent bias is reduced,\npossibly leading to a false null detection. Finally we show that model\nselection techniques like the Bayesian evidence can (and should) be used to\ndetermine if more than one PNG parameter is required by the data.\n", "  Hylleraas-Configuration Interaction (Hy-CI) calculations on the ground $1^1$S\nstate of helium atom are presented using s-, p-, d-, and f-Slater orbitals of\nboth real and complex form. Techniques of construction of adapted\nconfigurations, optimization of the orbital exponents and structure of the wave\nfunction expansion are explored. A new method to evaluate the two-electron\nkinetic energy integrals occurring in the Hy-CI method has been tested here and\ncompared with other methods. The non-relativistic Hy-CI values are\napproximately 10 picohartree accurate, about 2.2 x 10$^{-6}$ cm$^{-1}$. The\nHy-CI calculations are compared with Configuration Interaction (CI) and\nHylleraas (Hy) calculations employing the same orbital basis set, same computer\ncode and same computer machines. The computational required times are reported.\n", "  An improved algorithm to evaluate the nonrelativistic three-electron\nHylleraas-Configuration Interaction (Hy-CI) kinetic energy integrals over\nSlater orbitals and the Hamiltonian in Hylleraas coordinates is shown. The\nresulting analytical expressions are general for all quantum numbers of the\norbitals. From there, the restriction of employing orbitals with quantum\nnumbers $l \\le 2$ of the above algorithm presented in paper I of this series\nhas been removed. With the new algorithm it is possible, in the direct\nintegration method described in this series, to carry out Hy-CI atomic\nstructure calculations including $f$-, $g$-, $\\ldots$ , $l$ and higher\nangular-momentum Slater orbitals and to determine $F$, $G$, $\\ldots$ , $L$ and\nstates of higher order symmetry.\n", "  The critical behaviors of ferromagnet Eu0.5Sr0.5CoO3 arround TC=140.5K have\nbeen comprehensively investigated by analyzing a series of isothermal\nmagnetization M(H) curves. Both Modified Arrott plot and Kouvel-Fisher methods\ngive nearly the same critical exponents, which scale nicely the M(H) curves\ninto two different branches below and above TC. The exponents {\\gamma}=1.044\nand {\\delta}=3.06 demonstrate the relevance of mean-field characters for this\nmaterial. The conclusion of mean-field behavior proves a dominant itinerant\nferromagnetism (FM) due to a long range exchange interaction in the system.\nMeanwhile, by using Rhodes-Wohlfarth's criterion [P. Rhodes and E. P.\nWohlfarth, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 273, 247 (1963)], it is further confirmed that\nthe itinerant FM dominates in the system.\n", "  In most ferromagnets the magnetization rotates from one domain to the next\nwith no preferred handedness. However, broken inversion symmetry can lift the\nchiral degeneracy, leading to topologically-rich spin textures such as\nspin-spirals and skyrmions via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).\nHere we show that in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets sandwiched between a heavy\nmetal and an oxide, the DMI stabilizes chiral domain walls (DWs) whose spin\ntexture enables extremely efficient current-driven motion. We show that spin\ntorque from the spin Hall effect drives DWs in opposite directions in\nPt/CoFe/MgO and Ta/CoFe/MgO, which can be explained only if the DWs assume a\nN\\'eel configuration with left-handed chirality. We directly confirm the DW\nchirality and rigidity by examining current-driven DW dynamics with magnetic\nfields applied perpendicular and parallel to the spin spiral. This work\nresolves the origin of controversial experimental results and highlights a new\npath towards interfacial design of spintronic devices.\n", "  As the value of the longitudinal momentum carried by partons in a\nultra-relativistic hadron becomes small, one observes a growth of their\ndensity. When the parton density becomes close to a value of order\n$1/\\alpha_s$, it does not grow any longer, it saturates. These high density\neffects seem to be well described by the Color Glass Condensate effective field\ntheory. On the experimental side, the LHC provides the best tool ever for\nreaching the saturated phase of hadronic matter. For this reason saturation\nphysics is a very active branch of QCD during these past and coming years since\nsaturation theories and experimental data can be compared. I first deal with\nthe phenomenology of the proton-lead collisions performed in winter 2013 at the\nLHC and whose data are about to be available. I compute the di-gluon production\ncross-section which provides the simplest observable for finding quantitative\nevidences of saturation in the kinematic range of the LHC. I also discuss the\nlimit of the strongly correlated final state at large transverse momenta and by\nthe way, generalize parton distribution to dense regime. The second main topic\nis the quantum evolution of the quark and gluon spectra in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions having in mind the proof of its universal character. This result is\nalready known for gluons and here I detail the calculation carefully. For\nquarks universality has not been proved yet but I derive an intermediate\nleading order to next-to leading order recursion relation which is a crucial\nstep for extracting the quantum evolution. Finally I briefly present an\nindependent work in group theory. I detail a method I used for computing traces\ninvolving an arbitrary number of group generators, a situation often\nencountered in QCD calculations.\n", "  We consider a system of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with\nsubstrate-induced modulated electrostatic potentials tripling the unit cell.\nThe resulting non-Abelian SU(2) gauge fields act cooperatively to realize a\nquadratic band crossing point (QBCP). Using a combination of mean-field theory\nand renormalization group techniques, we show that in the QBCP regime,\narbitrarily weak repulsive electronic interactions drive the system into the\nquantum anomalous Hall state. This proves that substrate-induced local voltages\nare an effective knob to induce the spontaneous formation of a topological\nquantum phase.\n", "  By generalizing the cosymplectic setting for time-dependent Lagrangian\nmechanics, we propose a geometric framework for the Lagrangian formulation of\nclassical field theories with a Lagrangian depending on the independent\nvariables. For that purpose we consider the first order jet bundles $J^1\\pi$ of\na fiber bundle $\\pi:E\\to {\\mathbb R}^k$ where ${\\mathbb R}^k$ is the space of\nindependent variables. Generalized symmetries of the Lagrangian are introduced\nand the corresponding Noether Theorem is proved.\n", "  Understanding cities is central to addressing major global challenges from\nclimate and health to economic resilience. Although increasingly perceived as\nfundamental socio-economic units, the detailed fabric of urban economic\nactivities is only now accessible to comprehensive analyses with the\navailability of large datasets. Here, we study abundances of business\ncategories across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas to investigate how\ndiversity of economic activities depends on city size. A universal structure\ncommon to all cities is revealed, manifesting self-similarity in internal\neconomic structure as well as aggregated metrics (GDP, patents, crime). A\nderivation is presented that explains universality and the observed empirical\ndistribution. The model incorporates a generalized preferential attachment\nprocess with ceaseless introduction of new business types. Combined with\nscaling analyses for individual categories, the theory quantitatively predicts\nhow individual business types systematically change rank with city size,\nthereby providing a quantitative means for estimating their expected abundances\nas a function of city size. These results shed light on processes of economic\ndifferentiation with scale, suggesting a general structure for the growth of\nnational economies as integrated urban systems.\n", "  We study several natural multiplicity questions that arise in the context of\nthe Birman-Schwinger principle applied to non-self-adjoint operators. In\nparticular, we re-prove (and extend) a recent result by Latushkin and Sukhtyaev\nby employing a different technique based on factorizations of analytic\noperator-valued functions due to Howland. Factorizations of analytic\noperator-valued functions are of particular interest in themselves and again we\nre-derive Howland's results and subsequently extend them.\n  Considering algebraic multiplicities of finitely meromorphic operator-valued\nfunctions, we recall the notion of the index of a finitely meromorphic\noperator-valued function and use that to prove an analog of the well-known\nWeinstein-Aronszajn formula relating algebraic multiplicities of the underlying\nunperturbed and perturbed operators.\n  Finally, we consider pairs of projections for which the difference belongs to\nthe trace class and relate their Fredholm index to the index of the naturally\nunderlying Birman-Schwinger operator.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the spin-1 quantum bilinear-biquadratic\nantiferromagnet on the kagome lattice using exact diagonalization and the\ndensity matrix renormalization group algorithm. The SU(3)-symmetric point of\nthis model Hamiltonian is a spontaneously trimerized state whose qualitative\nnature persists even at the Heisenberg point, a finding that contrasts previous\nproposals. We report the ground state energy per site of the Heisenberg model\nto be -1.410(2) and establish the presence of a spin gap.\n", "  Using the Onsager-Machlup functional integral approach, we obtain the work\ndistribution function and the distribution of the dissipated heat of a Brownian\nparticle subjected to a confining harmonic potential and an oscillatory driving\nforce. In the long time limit, the width of the work distribution function\ninitially increases with the frequency of the driving force and finally\nsaturates to a fixed value for large values of the angular frequency. Using the\nresults from the work distribution part, we next obtain the distribution of the\ndissipated heat for the equilibrium initial condition. Using the method of\nsteepest descent, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for small fluctuations in\nthe large time limit. The distribution function, for a fixed time has been\nobtained numerically. It is shown that the heat distribution, in general, does\nnot satisfy the transient fluctuation theorem.\n", "  A recent calculation shows that the observed energy density in the Unruh\nstate at the future event horizon as seen by a freely falling observer is\nfinite if the observer is released from rest at any positive distance outside\nthe horizon; however, it is getting larger and larger so that it is negatively\ndivergent at the horizon in the limit that the observer starts falling from\nrest at the horizon, which corresponds to the infinite boost with respect to\nthe freely falling observer at a finite distance from the horizon. In order to\nresolve some conflicts between the recent calculation and the conventional ones\nin the well-known literatures, the calculation of the free-fall energy density\nis revisited and some differences are pointed out.\n", "  In this paper we consider a super-renormalizable theory of massless QED in\n$(2+1)$ dimensions and discuss their BRST symmetry transformation. By extending\nthe BRST transformation we derive the Nielsen identities for the theory.\nFurther, we compute the generalized BRST (so-called FFBRST) transformation by\nmaking the transformation parameter field-dependent. Remarkably, we observe\nthat the Lowenstein-Zimmerman mass terms, containing Lowenstein-Zimmerman\nparameter which plays an important role in the BPHZL renormalization program,\nalong with the external sources coupled to the non-linear BRST variations\nappear naturally in the theory through a FFBRST transformation.\n", "  We apply a subtracted dispersion relation formalism with the aim to improve\npredictions for the two-photon exchange corrections to elastic electron-proton\nscattering observables at finite momentum transfers. We study the formalism on\nthe elastic contribution, and make a detailed comparison with existing data for\nunpolarized cross sections as well as polarization transfer observables.\n", "  With the recent measurement of reactor mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ the\nknowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters that describe PMNS matrix has\nimproved significantly except the CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$. The other\nunknown parameters in neutrino oscillation studies are mass hierarchy and the\noctant of the atmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$. Many dedicated\nexperiments are proposed to determine these parameters which may take at least\n10 years from now to become operational. It is therefore very crucial to use\nthe results from the existing experiments to see whether we can get even\npartial answers to these questions. In this paper we study the discovery\npotential of the ongoing NO$\\nu$A and T2K experiments as well as the\nforthcoming T2HK experiment in addressing these questions. In particular, we\nevaluate the sensitivity of NO$\\nu$A to determine neutrino mass hierarchy,\noctant degeneracy and to obtain CP violation phase after running for its\nscheduled period of 3 years in neutrino mode and 3 years in anti-neutrino mode.\nWe then extend the analysis to understand the discovery potential if the\nexperiments will run for (5$\\nu$+5$\\bar{\\nu}$) years and (7$\\nu$+3$\\bar{\\nu}$)\nyears. We also show how the sensitivity improves when we combine the data from\n(3$\\nu$+3$\\bar{\\nu}$) years of NO$\\nu$A run with (3$\\nu$+2$\\bar{\\nu}$) years of\nT2K and (3$\\nu$+7$\\bar{\\nu}$) years of T2HK experiments. The CP violation\nsensitivity is marginal for T2K and NO$\\nu$A experiments even for ten years\ndata taking of NO$\\nu$A. T2HK has a significance above 5$\\sigma$ for a fraction\nof two-fifth values of the $\\delta_{CP}$ space. We also find that $\\delta_{CP}$\ncan be determined to be better than $35^\\circ $, $21^\\circ $ and $9^\\circ $ for\nall values of $\\delta_{CP}$ for T2K, NO$\\nu$A and T2HK respectively.\n", "  We consider the Palatini formalism of the Born-Infeld gravity. In the\nPalatini formalism, the propagating mode is only graviton, whose situation is\ndifferent from that in the metric formalism. We discuss about the FRW cosmology\nby using an effective potential. Especially we consider the condition that the\nbouncing could occur. We also give some speculations about the black hole\nformation\n", "  We present a model for the quark-antiquark interaction formulated in\nMinkowski space using the Covariant Spectator Theory. The quark propagators are\ndressed with the same kernel that describes the interaction between different\nquarks. By applying the axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity we show that our\nmodel satisfies the Adler-zero constraint imposed by chiral symmetry. For this\nmodel, our Minkowski-space results of the dressed quark mass function are\ncompared to lattice QCD data obtained in Euclidean space. The mass function is\nthen used in the calculation of the electromagnetic pion form factor in\nrelativistic impulse approximation, and the results are presented and compared\nwith the experimental data from JLab.\n", "  The charge transport properties of hybrid halide perovskites are investigated\nwith a combination of density functional theory including van der Waals\ninteraction and the Boltzmann theory for diffusive transport in the relaxation\ntime approximation. We find the mobility of electrons to be in the range 5-10\ncm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and that for holes within 1-5 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$,\nwhere the variations depend on the crystal structure investigated and the level\nof doping. Such results, in good agreement with recent experiments, set the\nrelaxation time to about 1 ps, which is the time-scale for the molecular\nrotation at room temperature. For the room temperature tetragonal phase we\nexplore two possible orientations of the organic cations and find that the\nmobility has a significant asymmetry depending on the direction of the current\nwith respect to the molecular axis. This is due mostly to the way the PbI$_3$\noctahedral symmetry is broken. Interestingly we find that substituting I with\nCl has minor effects on the mobilities. Our analysis suggests that the carrier\nmobility is probably not a key factor in determining the high solar-harvesting\nefficiency of this class of materials.\n", "  We show the validity of some results of finite-time thermodynamics, also\nwithin the quasi-static framework of classical thermodynamics. First, we\nconsider the efficiency at maximum work (EMW) from finite source and sink\nmodelled as identical thermodynamic systems. The near-equilibrium regime is\ncharacterized by expanding the internal energy upto second order (i.e. upto\nlinear response) in the difference of initial entropies of the source and the\nsink. It is shown that the efficiency is given by a universal expression $2\n\\eta_C / (4-\\eta_C)$, where $\\eta_C$ is the Carnot efficiency. Then, different\nsizes of source and sink are treated, by combining different numbers of copies\nof the same thermodynamic system. The efficiency of this process is found to be\n${\\boldsymbol\\eta}_0 = \\eta_C/ (2-\\gamma \\eta_C)$, where the parameter $\\gamma$\ndepends only on the relative size of the source and the sink. This implies that\nwithin the linear response theory, EMW is bounded as ${\\eta_C}/{2} \\le\n{{\\boldsymbol\\eta}}_0 \\le {\\eta_C}/{(2 - \\eta_C)}$, where the upper (lower)\nbound is obtained with a sink much larger (smaller) in size than the source. We\nalso remark on the behavior of the efficiency beyond linear response.\n", "  Recent progress in lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structure will be\npresented. Calculations of nucleon matrix elements and form factors have long\nbeen difficult to reconcile with experiment, but with advances in both\nmethodology and computing resources, this situation is improving. Some\ncalculations have produced agreement with experiment for key observables such\nas the axial charge and electromagnetic form factors, and the improved\nunderstanding of systematic errors will help to increase confidence in\npredictions of unmeasured quantities. The long-omitted disconnected\ncontributions are now seeing considerable attention and some recent\ncalculations of them will be discussed.\n", "  In natural language using short sentences is considered efficient for\ncommunication. However, a text composed exclusively of such sentences looks\ntechnical and reads boring. A text composed of long ones, on the other hand,\ndemands significantly more effort for comprehension. Studying characteristics\nof the sentence length variability (SLV) in a large corpus of world-famous\nliterary texts shows that an appealing and aesthetic optimum appears somewhere\nin between and involves selfsimilar, cascade-like alternation of various\nlengths sentences. A related quantitative observation is that the power spectra\nS(f) of thus characterized SLV universally develop a convincing `1/f^beta'\nscaling with the average exponent beta =~ 1/2, close to what has been\nidentified before in musical compositions or in the brain waves. An\noverwhelming majority of the studied texts simply obeys such fractal attributes\nbut especially spectacular in this respect are hypertext-like, \"stream of\nconsciousness\" novels. In addition, they appear to develop structures\ncharacteristic of irreducibly interwoven sets of fractals called multifractals.\nScaling of S(f) in the present context implies existence of the long-range\ncorrelations in texts and appearance of multifractality indicates that they\ncarry even a nonlinear component. A distinct role of the full stops in inducing\nthe long-range correlations in texts is evidenced by the fact that the above\nquantitative characteristics on the long-range correlations manifest themselves\nin variation of the full stops recurrence times along texts, thus in SLV, but\nto a much lesser degree in the recurrence times of the most frequent words. In\nthis latter case the nonlinear correlations, thus multifractality, disappear\neven completely for all the texts considered. Treated as one extra word, the\nfull stops at the same time appear to obey the Zipfian rank-frequency\ndistribution, however.\n", "  Motivated by studies of the cylinder wake, in which the vortex-shedding\nfrequency can be obtained from the mean flow, we study thermosolutal convection\ndriven by opposing thermal and solutal gradients. In the archetypal\ntwo-dimensional geometry with horizontally periodic and vertical no-slip\nboundary conditions, branches of traveling waves and standing waves are created\nsimultaneously by a Hopf bifurcation. Consistent with similar analyses\nperformed on the cylinder wake, we find that the traveling waves of\nthermosolutal convection have the RZIF property, meaning that linearization\nabout the mean fields of the traveling waves yields an eigenvalue whose real\npart is almost zero and whose imaginary part corresponds very closely to the\nnonlinear frequency. In marked contrast, linearization about the mean field of\nthe standing waves yields neither zero growth nor the nonlinear frequency. It\nis shown that this difference can be attributed to the fact that the temporal\npower spectrum for the traveling waves is peaked, while that of the standing\nwaves is broad. We give a general demonstration that the frequency of any\nquasi-monochromatic oscillation can be predicted from its temporal mean.\n", "  We provide evidence for the mapping of critical spin-1 chains, in particular\nthe SU(3) symmetric bilinear-biquadratic model with additional interactions, to\nfree boson theories using exact diagonalization and the density matrix\nrenormalization group algorithm. Using the correspondence with a conformal\nfield theory with central charge c=2, we determine the analytic formulae for\nthe scaling dimensions in terms of four Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid parameters.\nBy matching the lowest scaling dimensions, we numerically calculate these\nfield-theoretic parameters and track their evolution as a function of the\nparameters of the lattice model.\n", "  We assess the possibility of reducing the travel time of a manned mission to\nMars by examining four different propulsion methods, and keeping the mass at\ndeparture under 2,500 tonnes, for a fixed architecture. We evaluated\nrepresentative systems of three different state of the art technologies\n(chemical, nuclear thermal, and electric), and one advance technology, the\n\"Pure Electro-Magnetic Thrust\" (PEMT) concept (proposed by Rubbia). A mission\narchitecture mostly based on the Design Reference Architecture 5.0 is assumed\nin order to estimate the mass budget, that influences the performance of the\npropulsion system. Pareto curves of the duration of the mission and time of\nflight versus mass of mission are drawn. We conclude that the ion engine\ntechnology, combined with the classical chemical engine, yields the shortest\nmission times for this architecture with the lowest mass, and that chemical\npropulsion alone is the best to minimise travel time. The results obtained\nusing the PEMT suggest that it could be a more suitable solution for farther\ndestinations than Mars.\n", "  Galaxies and the dark matter halos that host them are not spherically\nsymmetric, yet spherical symmetry is a helpful simplifying approximation for\nidealised calculations and analysis of observational data. The assumption leads\nto an exact conservation of angular momentum for every particle, making the\ndynamics unrealistic. But how much does that inaccuracy matter in practice for\nanalyses of stellar distribution functions, collisionless relaxation, or dark\nmatter core-creation?\n  We provide a general answer to this question for a wide class of aspherical\nsystems; specifically, we consider distribution functions that are \"maximally\nstable\", i.e. that do not evolve at first order when external potentials (which\narise from baryons, large scale tidal fields or infalling substructure) are\napplied. We show that a spherically-symmetric analysis of such systems gives\nrise to the false conclusion that the density of particles in phase space is\nergodic (a function of energy alone).\n  Using this idea we are able to demonstrate that: (a) observational analyses\nthat falsely assume spherical symmetry are made more accurate by imposing a\nstrong prior preference for near-isotropic velocity dispersions in the centre\nof spheroids; (b) numerical simulations that use an idealised\nspherically-symmetric setup can yield misleading results and should be avoided\nwhere possible; and (c) triaxial dark matter halos (formed in collisionless\ncosmological simulations) nearly attain our maximally-stable limit, but their\nevolution freezes out before reaching it.\n", "  Chiral magnetic effect exists in an electron-positron strongly magnetized gas\nin QED. It is induced by an electric field parallel to the external field\n$\\textbf{B}$, like that produced by the pseudovector longitudinal mode\npropagating along $\\textbf{B}$. In the static limit, an electric pseudovector\ncurrent is obtained in the lowest Landau level. We obtain a new axial anomaly\nexpression in a medium of massive particles in the presence of $\\textbf{B}$,\nfor scattering or pair creation, similar to the usual QED axial anomaly. The\neffect is interesting in connection to the QCD chiral magnetic case reported in\ncurrent literature.\n", "  Transition frequencies between low-lying energy levels in a single trapped\n$^{138}$Ba$^{+}$ ion have been measured with laser spectroscopy referenced to\nan optical frequency comb. By extracting the frequencies of one-photon and\ntwo-photon components of the line shape using an eight-level optical Bloch\nmodel, we achieved 0.1 MHz accuracy for the 5d $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ - 6p\n$^{2}$P$_{1/2}$ and 6s $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ - 5d $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ transition\nfrequencies, and 0.2 MHz for the 6s $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ - 6p $^{2}$P$_{1/2}$\ntransition frequency.\n", "  We probe the possible anisotropy of the Universe by using the JLA compilation\nof type-Ia supernovae. We apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to\nconstrain the amplitude and direction of anisotropy in three cosmological\nmodels. For the dipole-modulated $\\Lambda$CDM model, the anisotropic amplitude\nis consistent with zero at $68\\%$ C.L., and has an upper bound\n$A_D<1.98\\times10^{-3}$ at $95\\%$ C.L. Regardless of much larger uncertainty,\nwe find the dipole direction of JLA is amazingly opposite to that of Union2.\nSimilar results are found for the dipole-modulated $w$CDM and CPL models. Thus,\nthe Universe is still well consistent with the isotropy according to the JLA\ncompilation.\n", "  We propose a method to generate `genetically-modified' (GM) initial\nconditions for high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation in a\ncosmological context. Building on the Hoffman-Ribak algorithm, we start from a\nreference simulation with fully random initial conditions, then make controlled\nchanges to specific properties of a single halo (such as its mass and merger\nhistory). The algorithm demonstrably makes minimal changes to other properties\nof the halo and its environment, allowing us to isolate the impact of a given\nmodification. As a significant improvement over previous work, we are able to\ncalculate the abundance of the resulting objects relative to the reference\nsimulation. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of cosmic structures\nand epochs; here we study two problems as a proof-of-concept. First, we\ninvestigate the change in density profile and concentration as the collapse\ntime of three individual halos are varied at fixed final mass, showing good\nagreement with previous statistical studies using large simulation suites.\nSecond, we modify the $z=0$ mass of halos to show that our theoretical\nabundance calculations correctly recover the halo mass function. The results\ndemonstrate that the technique is robust, opening the way to controlled\nexperiments in galaxy formation using hydrodynamic zoom simulations.\n", "  Strain, magnetization, and unpolarized and polarized neutron diffraction\nmeasurements were performed to study the magnetic and structural properties of\nspinel CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. Magnetostriction measurements indicate that a subtle\ndistortion of the crystal along the direction of magnetization, $\\Delta L/L\n\\sim 10^{-4}$, exists and varies from elongation to contraction in a second\norder fashion upon cooling. Unpolarized and polarized single-crystal neutron\nexperiments indicate that upon cooling the ferrimagnetic structure changes from\ncollinear to noncollinear at $T \\sim 90$ K, where the elongation of the crystal\nis maximized. These results imply the existence of an orbital glassy state in\nthe nearly metallic frustrated magnet CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$.\n", "  We investigate spin properties of a Fe2+ dopant, known for having single\nnondegenerate ground state in bulk host semiconductor. Due to zero magnetic\nmoment such a ground state is of little use for spintronics and solotronics. We\nshow that this well-established picture of Fe2+ spin configuration can be\ncontradicted by subjecting the Fe2+ ion to sufficiently high strain, e.g.,\nresulting from lattice mismatched epitaxial heterostructures. Our analysis\nreveals that high strain induces qualitative change in the ion energy spectrum\nand results in doubly degenerate ground state with spin projection Sz=+/-2. An\nexperimental proof of this concept is demonstrated using a new system: an\nepitaxial quantum dot containing individual Fe2+ ion. Magnetic character of the\nFe2+ ground state in a CdSe/ZnSe dot is revealed in photoluminescence\nexperiments by exploiting a coupling between a confined exciton and the single\niron impurity.\n", "  We derive the distribution function of work performed by a harmonic force\nacting on a uniformly dragged Brownian particle subjected to a rotational\ntorque. Following the Onsager and Machlup's functional integral approach, we\nobtain the transition probability of finding the Brownian particle at a\nparticular position at time $t$ given that it started the journey from a\nspecific location at an earlier time. The difference between the forward and\nthe time-reversed form of the generalized Onsager-Machlup's Lagrangian is\nidentified as the rate of medium entropy production which further helps us\ndevelop the stochastic thermodynamics formalism for our model. The probability\ndistribution for the work done by the harmonic trap is evaluated for an\nequilibrium initial condition. Although this distribution has a Gaussian form,\nit is found that the distribution does not satisfy the conventional work\nfluctuation theorem.\n", "  Community structures in collaboration networks reflect the natural tendency\nof individuals to organize their work in groups in order to better achieve\ncommon goals. In most of the cases, individuals exploit their connections to\nintroduce themselves to new areas of interests, giving rise to multifaceted\ncollaborations which span different fields. In this paper, we analyse\ncollaborations in science and among movie actors as multiplex networks, where\nthe layers represent respectively research topics and movie genres, and we show\nthat communities indeed coexist and overlap at the different layers of such\nsystems. We then propose a model to grow multiplex networks based on two\nmechanisms of intra and inter-layer triadic closure which mimic the real\nprocesses by which collaborations evolve. We show that our model is able to\nexplain the multiplex community structure observed empirically, and we infer\nthe strength of the two underlying social mechanisms from real-world systems.\nBeing also able to correctly reproduce the values of intra-layer and\ninter-layer assortativity correlations, the model contributes to a better\nunderstanding of the principles driving the evolution of social networks.\n", "  Our low-temperature magneto-Raman scattering measurements performed on\ngraphene-like locations on the surface of bulk graphite reveal a new series of\nmagneto-phonon resonances involving both K-point and Gamma-point phonons. In\nparticular, we observe for the first time the resonant splitting of three\ncrossing excitation branches. We give a detailed theoretical analysis of these\nnew resonances. Our results highlight the role of combined excitations and the\nimportance of multi-phonon processes (from both K and Gamma points) for the\nrelaxation of hot carriers in graphene.\n", "  We employ renormalization group (RG) summation techniques to obtain portions\nof Laplace QCD sum rules for scalar gluon currents beyond the order to which\nthey have been explicitly calculated. The first two of these sum rules are\nconsidered in some detail, and it is shown that they have significantly less\ndependence on the renormalization scale parameter $\\mu^2$ once the RG summation\nis used to extend the perturbative results. Using the sum rules, we then\ncompute the bound on the scalar glueball mass and demonstrate that the 3 and\n4-Loop perturbative results form lower and upper bounds to their RG summed\ncounterparts. We further demonstrate improved convergence of the RG summed\nexpressions with respect to perturbative results.\n", "  In these lectures I discuss Hopf algebras and Dyson-Schwinger equations. The\nlectures start with an introduction to Hopf algebras, followed by a review\nwhere Hopf algebras occur in particles physics. The final part of these\nlectures is devoted to the relation between Hopf algebras and Dyson-Schwinger\nequations.\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators define a new class of topological\ninsulator phases with gapless surface states protected by crystalline\nsymmetries. In this work, we present a general theory to classify topological\ncrystalline insulator phases based on the representation theory of space\ngroups. Our approach is to directly identify possible nontrivial surface states\nin a semi-infinite system with a specific surface, of which the symmetry\nproperty can be described by 17 two-dimensional space groups. We reproduce the\nexisting results of topological crystalline insulators, such as mirror Chern\ninsulators in the $pm$ or $pmm$ groups, $C_{nv}$ topological insulators in the\n$p4m$, $p31m$ and $p6m$ groups, and topological nonsymmorphic crystalline\ninsulators in the $pg$ and $pmg$ groups. Aside from these existing results, we\nalso obtain the following new results: (1) there are two integer mirror Chern\nnumbers ($\\mathbb{Z}^2$) in the $pm$ group but only one ($\\mathbb{Z}$) in the\n$cm$ or $p3m1$ group for both the spinless and spinful cases; (2) for the $pmm$\n($cmm$) groups, there is no topological classification in the spinless case but\n$\\mathbb{Z}^4$ ($\\mathbb{Z}^2$) classifications in the spinful case; (3) we\nshow how topological crystalline insulator phase in the $pg$ group is related\nto that in the $pm$ group; (4) we identify topological classification of the\n$p4m$, $p31m$, and $p6m$ for the spinful case; (5) we find topological\nnon-symmorphic crystalline insulators also existing in $pgg$ and $p4g$ groups,\nwhich exhibit new features compared to those in $pg$ and $pmg$ groups. We\nemphasize the importance of the irreducible representations for the states at\nsome specific high-symmetry momenta in the classification of topological\ncrystalline phases. Our theory can serve as a guide for the search of\ntopological crystalline insulator phases in realistic materials.\n", "  We show that color-kinematics duality is present in tree-level amplitudes of\nquantum chromodynamics with massive flavored quarks. Starting with the color\nstructure of QCD, we work out a new color decomposition for n-point tree\namplitudes in a reduced basis of primitive amplitudes. These primitives, with k\nquark-antiquark pairs and (n-2k) gluons, are taken in the (n-2)!/k! Melia\nbasis, and are independent under the color-algebra Kleiss-Kuijf relations. This\ngeneralizes the color decomposition of Del Duca, Dixon, and Maltoni to an\narbitrary number of quarks. The color coefficients in the new decomposition are\ngiven by compact expressions valid for arbitrary gauge group and\nrepresentation. Considering the kinematic structure, we show through explicit\ncalculations that color-kinematics duality holds for amplitudes with general\nconfigurations of gluons and massive quarks. The new (massive) amplitude\nrelations that follow from the duality can be mapped to a well-defined subset\nof the familiar BCJ relations for gluons. They restrict the amplitude basis\nfurther down to (n-3)!(2k-2)/k! primitives, for two or more quark lines. We\ngive a decomposition of the full amplitude in that basis. The presented results\nprovide strong evidence that QCD obeys the color-kinematics duality, at least\nat tree level. The results are also applicable to supersymmetric and\nD-dimensional extensions of QCD.\n", "  Throughout introductory physics, students create and interpret free body\ndiagrams in which multiple forces act on an object, typically at a single\nlocation (the object's center of mass). The situation increases in difficulty\nwhen multiple objects are involved, and further when electric and magnetic\nfields are present. In the latter, sources of the fields are often identified\nas a set of electric charges or current-carrying wires, and students are asked\nto determine the electric or magnetic field at a separate location defined as\nthe observation location. Previous research suggests students struggle with\naccounting for how a measurement or calculation depends on the observation\nlocation. We present preliminary results from a studio-style, algebra-based,\nintroductory electricity and magnetism course showing the prevalence of correct\nand incorrect responses to questions about observation location by analyzing\nstudent written work involving vector addition of fields.\n", "  This paper shows a way of how one may resolve the non-unitarity problem in\nblack-hole physics without modifications of the basic principles of local\nquantum field theory.\n", "  The rare kaon decays $K\\to\\pi\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ are\nflavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes and hence promising channels\nwith which to probe the limits of the standard model and to look for signs of\nnew physics. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of lattice\ncalculations of $K\\to\\pi\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay amplitudes for which long-distance\ncontributions are very significant. We show that the dominant finite-volume\ncorrections (those decreasing as powers of the volume) are negligibly small and\nthat, in the four-flavor theory, no new ultraviolet divergences appear as the\nelectromagnetic current $J$ and the effective weak Hamiltonian $H_W$ approach\neach other. In addition, we demonstrate that one can remove the unphysical\nterms which grow exponentially with the range of the integration over the time\nseparation between $J$ and $H_W$. We will now proceed to exploratory numerical\nstudies with the aim of motivating further experimental measurements of these\ndecays. Our work extends the earlier study by Isidori, Turchetti and Martinelli\nwhich focussed largely on the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences. In a\ncompanion paper we discuss the evaluation of the long-distance contributions to\n$K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decays; these contributions are expected to be at the\nlevel of a few percent for $K^+$ decays.\n", "  We explore the ability of a qubit probe to characterize unknown parameters of\nits environment. By resorting to quantum estimation theory, we analytically\nfind the ultimate bound on the precision of estimating key parameters of a\nbroad class of ubiquitous environmental noises (\"baths\") which the qubit may\nprobe. These include the probe-bath coupling strength, the correlation time of\ngeneric bath spectra, the power laws governing these spectra, as well as their\ndephasing times T2. Our central result is that by optimizing the dynamical\ncontrol on the probe under realistic constraints one may attain the maximal\naccuracy bound on the estimation of these parameters by the least number of\nmeasurements possible. Applications of this protocol that combines dynamical\ncontrol and estimation theory tools to quantum sensing are illustrated for a\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond used as a probe.\n", "  We present a measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of two charged pions in\nthe inclusive process $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\pi\\pi X$ based on a data set of 62\n$\\rm{pb}^{-1}$ at the center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=3.65$ GeV collected with\nthe BESIII detector. These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collins\nfragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases with\nincreasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existing\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measured\nasymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting the\nquark transversity distribution inside the nucleon and are valuable to explore\nthe energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function.\n", "  In the study of entanglement in a spin chain, people often consider the\nnearest-neighbor spins. The motivation is the prevailing role of the short\nrange interactions in creating quantum correlation between the 1st neighbor\n(1N) spins. Here, we address the same question between farther neighbor spins.\n  We consider the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY model in a magnetic field.\nUsing the fermionization approach, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem. Then, we provide the analytical results for entanglement between the\n2nd, 3rd and 4th neighbor (denoted as 2N, 3N, and 4N respectively) spins. We\nfind a magnetic entanglement that starts from a critical entangled-field\n($h_c^{E}$) at zero temperature. The critical entangled-field depends on the\ndistance between the spins. In addition to the analytical results, the\nmentioned phenomenon is confirmed by the numerical Lanczos calculations. By\nadding the temperature to the model, the magnetic entanglement remains stable\nup to a critical temperature, $T_c$. Our results show that entanglement spreads\nstep by step to farther neighbors in the spin chain by reducing temperature. At\nfirst, the 1N spins are entangled and then further neighbors will be entangled\nrespectively. $T_c$ depends on the value of the magnetic field and will be\nmaximized at the quantum critical field.\n", "  We perform canonical quantization of the dissipative Hofstadter model, which\nhas a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics and string theory.\nThe target space duality and the non-commutative algebra developed in string\ntheory are discussed for the model. We show that the target space duality\ntransformation of closed string theory, $O(2,2;R)$, removes the interaction\nwith a uniform magnetic field. The $O(2,2;R)$ dual transformation changes the\nbasis of oscillator operators so that the algebra of the string coordinate\noperators at the boundary become non-commutative. In the zero temperature\nlimit, the non-commutative algebra of open string theory emerges. We also\ndeveloped the boundary state formulation for the dissipative Hofstadter model.\n", "  Accurate statistical measurement with large imaging surveys has traditionally\nrequired throwing away a sizable fraction of the data. This is because most\nmeasurements have have relied on selecting nearly complete samples, where\nvariations in the composition of the galaxy population with seeing, depth, or\nother survey characteristics are small.\n  We introduce a new measurement method that aims to minimize this wastage,\nallowing precision measurement for any class of stars or galaxies detectable in\nan imaging survey. We have implemented our proposal in Balrog, a software\npackage which embeds fake objects in real imaging in order to accurately\ncharacterize measurement biases.\n  We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using\nDark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected\ngalaxies depends on a wide variety of survey characteristics in the same way as\nthe real data. We then construct a flux-limited sample of the faintest galaxies\nin DES, chosen specifically for their sensitivity to depth and seeing\nvariations. Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the standard\nLandy-Szalay correlation function estimator suppresses the effects of variable\nsurvey selection by at least two orders of magnitude. With this correction, our\nmeasured angular clustering is found to be in excellent agreement with that of\na matched sample drawn from much deeper, higher-resolution space-based\nCosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) imaging; over angular scales of\n$0.004^{\\circ} < \\theta < 0.2^{\\circ}$, we find a best-fit scaling amplitude\nbetween the DES and COSMOS measurements of $1.00 \\pm 0.09$.\n  We expect this methodology to be broadly useful for extending the statistical\nreach of measurements in a wide variety of coming imaging surveys.\n", "  We study the generation of sharp features in the primordial spectra within\nthe framework of effective field theory of inflation, wherein curvature\nperturbations are the consequence of the dynamics of a single scalar degree of\nfreedom. We identify two sources in the generation of features: rapid\nvariations of the sound speed c_s (at which curvature fluctuations propagate)\nand rapid variations of the expansion rate H during inflation. With this in\nmind, we propose a non-trivial relation linking these two quantities that\nallows us to study the generation of sharp features in realistic scenarios\nwhere features are the result of the simultaneous occurrence of these two\nsources. This relation depends on a single parameter with a value determined by\nthe particular model (and its numerical input) responsible for the rapidly\nvarying background. As a consequence, we find a one-parameter consistency\nrelation between the shape and size of features in the bispectrum and features\nin the power spectrum. To substantiate this result, we discuss several examples\nof models for which this one-parameter relation (between c_s and H) holds,\nincluding models in which features in the spectra are both sudden and resonant.\n", "  We report here the evidences of hydrogen bond symmetrization in the simplest\namino acid- carboxylic acid complex, glycinium oxalate, at moderate pressures\nof 8 GPa using in-situ infrared and Raman spectroscopic investigations combined\nwith first-principles simulations. The protonation of the semioxalate units\nthrough dynamic proton movement results in infinite oxalate chains. At\npressures above 12 GPa, the glycine units systematically reorient with pressure\nto form hydrogen bonded supramolecular assemblies held together by these\nchains.\n", "  I revisit here the decoupling theorem in top-quark productions/decays, which\nstates that the angular distribution of any final-particle produced in those\nprocesses does not depend on any possible nonstandard top-quark decay\ninteractions at their leading order when certain conditions are satisfied.\nTowards a simple, intuitive and visual understanding of this theorem, I will\nstudy to what extent we could explain why such a theorem holds without relying\non any specific/detailed calculations.\n", "  We have recently introduced a novel statistical measure of dark matter\nclustering in phase space, the particle phase space average density ($P^2SAD$).\nIn a two-paper series, we studied the structure of $P^2SAD$ in the\nMilky-Way-size Aquarius haloes, constructed a physically motivated model to\ndescribe it, and illustrated its potential as a powerful tool to predict\nsignals sensitive to the nanostructure of dark matter haloes. In this letter,\nwe report a remarkable universality of the clustering of dark matter in phase\nspace as measured by $P^2SAD$ within the subhaloes of host haloes across\ndifferent environments covering a range from dwarf-size to cluster-size haloes\n($10^{10}-10^{15}$ M$_\\odot$). Simulations show that the universality of\n$P^2SAD$ holds for more than 7 orders of magnitude, over a 2D phase space,\ncovering over 3 orders of magnitude in distance/velocity, with a simple\nfunctional form that can be described by our model. Invoking the universality\nof $P^2SAD$, we can accurately predict the non-linear power spectrum of dark\nmatter at small scales all the way down to the decoupling mass limit of cold\ndark matter particles. As an application, we compute the subhalo boost to the\nannihilation of dark matter in a wide range of host halo masses.\n", "  By making use of the generalized Landau level representation (GLLR) for the\nquasiparticle propagator, we study the effect of screening on the properties of\nthe quantum Hall states with integer filling factors in graphene. The analysis\nis performed in the low-energy Dirac model in the mean-field approximation, in\nwhich the long-range Coulomb interaction is modified by the one-loop static\nscreening effects in the presence of a background magnetic field. By utilizing\na rather general ansatz for the propagator, in which all dynamical parameters\nare running functions of the Landau level index $n$, we derive a\nself-consistent set of the Schwinger-Dyson (gap) equations and solve them\nnumerically. The explicit solutions demonstrate that static screening leads to\na substantial suppression of the gap parameters in the quantum Hall states with\na broken $U(4)$ flavor symmetry. The temperature dependence of the energy gaps\nis also studied. The corresponding results mimic well the temperature\ndependence of the activation energies measured in experiment. It is also argued\nthat, in principle, the Landau level running of the quasiparticle dynamical\nparameters could be measured via optical studies of the integer quantum Hall\nstates.\n", "  It is the saturation of the transition temperature Tc in the range of 24 K\nfor known materials in the late sixties which triggered the search for\nadditional materials offering new coupling mechanisms leading in turn to higher\nTc's. As a result of this stimulation, superconductivity in organic matter was\ndiscovered in tetramethyl-tetraselenafulvalene-hexafluorophosphate,\n(TMTSF)2PF6, in 1979, in the laboratory founded at Orsay by Professor Friedel\nand his colleagues in 1962. Although this conductor is a prototype example for\nlow-dimensional physics, we mostly focus in this article on the superconducting\nphase of the ambient-pressure superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, in which the\nsuperconducting phase has been studied most intensively among the TMTSF salts.\nWe shall present a series of experimental results supporting nodal d-wave\nsymmetry for the superconducting gap in these prototypical\nquasi-one-dimensional conductors.\n", "  We investigate some peculiarities in the calculation of the two-loop\nbeta-function of $N=1$ supersymmetric models which are intimately related to\nthe so-called \"Anomaly Puzzle\". There is an apparent paradox when the\ncomputation is performed in the framework of the covariant derivative\nbackground field method. In this formalism, it is obtained a finite two-loop\neffective action, although a non-null coefficient for the beta-function is\nachieved by means of the renormalized two-point function in the background\nfield. We show that if the standard background field method is used, this\ntwo-point function has a divergent part which allows for the calculation of the\nbeta-function via the renormalization constants, as usual. Therefore, we\nconjecture that this paradox has its origin in the covariant supergraph\nformalism itself, possibly being an artifact of the rescaling anomaly.\n", "  The century-old study of photon-phonon coupling has seen a remarkable revival\nin the past decade. Driven by early observations of dynamical back-action, the\nfield progressed to ground-state cooling and the counting of individual\nphonons. A recent branch investigates the potential of traveling-wave,\noptically broadband photon-phonon interaction in silicon circuits. Here, we\nreport continuous-wave Brillouin gain exceeding the optical losses in a series\nof suspended silicon beams, a step towards selective on-chip amplifiers. We\nobtain efficiencies up to $10^{4} \\, \\text{W}^{-1}\\text{m}^{-1}$, the highest\nto date in the phononic gigahertz range. We also find indications that\ngeometric disorder poses a significant challenge towards nanoscale phonon-based\ntechnologies.\n", "  The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)\ndetectors have completed their initial upgrade phase and will enter the first\nobserving run in late 2015, with detector sensitivity expected to improve in\nfuture runs. Through the combined efforts of on-site commissioners and the\nDetector Characterization group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration,\ninterferometer performance, in terms of data quality, at both LIGO\nobservatories has vastly improved from the start of commissioning efforts to\npresent. Advanced LIGO has already surpassed Enhanced LIGO in sensitivity, and\nthe rate of noise transients, which would negatively impact astrophysical\nsearches, has improved. Here we give details of some of the work which has\ntaken place to better the quality of the LIGO data ahead of the first observing\nrun.\n", "  Complex low-temperature ordered states in chiral magnets are typically\ngoverned by a competition between multiple magnetic interactions. The\nchiral-lattice multiferroic Cu2OSeO3 became the first insulating helimagnetic\nmaterial in which a long-range order of topologically stable spin vortices\nknown as skyrmions was established. Here we employ state-of-the-art inelastic\nneutron scattering (INS) to comprehend the full three-dimensional spin\nexcitation spectrum of Cu2OSeO3 over a broad range of energies. Distinct types\nof high- and low-energy dispersive magnon modes separated by an extensive\nenergy gap are observed in excellent agreement with the previously suggested\nmicroscopic theory based on a model of entangled Cu4 tetrahedra. The comparison\nof our INS data with model spin-dynamical calculations based on these\ntheoretical proposals enables an accurate quantitative verification of the\nfundamental magnetic interactions in Cu2OSeO3 that are essential for\nunderstanding its abundant low-temperature magnetically ordered phases.\n", "  The Decadal IRAC Bootes Survey is a mid-IR variability survey of the ~9 sq.\ndeg. of the NDWFS Bootes Field and extends the time baseline of its\npredecessor, the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey (SDWFS), from 4 to 10 years.\nThe Spitzer Space Telescope visited the field five times between 2004 and 2014\nat 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We provide the difference image analysis photometry for\na half a million mostly extragalactic sources. In mid-IR color-color plane,\nsources with quasar colors constitute the largest variability class (75%), 16%\nof the variable objects have stellar colors and the remaining 9% have the\ncolors of galaxies. Adding the fifth epoch doubles the number of variable\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) for the same false positive rates as in SDWFS, or\nincreases the number of sources by 20% while decreasing the false positive\nrates by factors of 2-3 for the same variability amplitude. We quantify the\nensemble mid-IR variability of ~1500 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs using\nsingle power-law structure functions (SFs), which we find to be steeper (index\n$\\gamma=0.45$) than in the optical ($\\gamma=0.3$), leading to much lower\namplitudes at short time-lags. This provides evidence for large emission\nregions, smoothing out any fast UV/optical variations, as the origin of\ninfrared quasar variability. The mid-IR AGN SF slope $\\gamma$ seems to be\nuncorrelated with both the luminosity and rest-frame wavelength, while the\namplitude shows an anti-correlation with the luminosity and a correlation with\nthe rest-frame wavelength.\n", "  Using the $\\hbar$-expansion of the Green's function of the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation, we extend the second-order Thomas-Fermi\napproximation to generalized superfluid Fermi systems by including the\ndensity-dependent effective mass and the spin-orbit potential. We first\nimplement and examine the full correction terms over different energy intervals\nof the quasiparticle spectra in calculations of finite nuclei. Final\napplications of this generalized Thomas-Fermi method are intended for various\ninhomogeneous superfluid Fermi systems.\n", "  We present the discovery of the highest velocity CIV broad absorption line to\ndate in the z=2.47 quasar SDSS J023011.28+005913.6, hereafter J0230. In\ncomparing the public DR7 and DR9 spectra of J0230, we discovered an emerging\nbroad absorption trough outflowing at ~60,000 km/s, which we refer to as trough\nA. In pursuing follow up observations of trough A, we discovered a second\nemergent CIV broad absorption trough outflowing at ~40,000 km/s, namely trough\nB. In total, we collected seven spectral epochs of J0230 that demonstrate\nemergent and rapidly (~10 days in the rest-frame) varying broad absorption. We\ninvestigate two possible scenarios that could cause these rapid changes: bulk\nmotion and ionization variability. Given our multi-epoch data, we were able to\nrule out some simple models of bulk motion, but have proposed two more\nrealistic models to explain the variability of both troughs. Trough A is likely\nan augmented `crossing disk' scenario with the absorber moving at 10,000 < v\n(km/s) < 18,000. Trough B can be explained by a flow-tube feature travelling\nacross the emitting region at 8,000 < v (km/s) < 56,000. If ionization\nvariability is the cause for the changes observed, trough A's absorber has n_e\n>= 724 cm^-3 and is at r_{equal} >=2.00 kpc, or is at r < 2.00 kpc with no\nconstraint on the density; trough B's absorber either has n_e >= 1540 cm^-3 and\nis at r_{equal} >= 1.37 kpc, or is at r < 1.37 kpc with no constraint on the\ndensity.\n", "  We propose to realize and observe Chern Kondo insulators in an optical\nsuperlattice with laser-assisted $s$ and $p$ orbital hybridization and\nsynthetic gauge field, which can be engineered based on the recent cold atom\nexperiments. Considering a double-well square optical lattice, the localized\n$s$ orbitals are decoupled from itinerant $p$ bands and are driven into a Mott\ninsulator due to strong Hubbard interaction. Raman laser beams are then applied\nto induce tunnelings between $s$ and $p$ orbitals, and generate a staggered\nflux simultaneously. Due to the strong Hubbard interaction of $s$ orbital\nstates, we predict the existence of a critical Raman laser-assisted coupling,\nbeyond which the Kondo screening is achieved and then a fully gapped Chern\nKondo phase emerges, with the topology characterized by integer Chern numbers.\nBeing a strongly correlated topological state, the Chern Kondo phase is\ndifferent from the single-particle quantum anomalous Hall state, and can be\nidentified by measuring the band topology and double occupancy of $s$ orbitals.\nThe experimental realization and detection of the predicted Chern Kondo\ninsulator are also proposed.\n", "  Non-minimal supersymmetric models that predict a tree-level Higgs mass above\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) bound are well motivated by\nnaturalness considerations. Indirect constraints on the stop sector parameters\nof such models are significantly relaxed compared to the MSSM; in particular,\nboth stops can have weak-scale masses. We revisit the stop-catalyzed\nelectroweak baryogenesis (EWB) scenario in this context. We find that the LHC\nmeasurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates already rule out the\npossibility of stop-catalyzed EWB. We also introduce a gauge-invariant analysis\nframework that may generalize to other scenarios in which interactions outside\nthe gauge sector drive the electroweak phase transition.\n", "  Many models of dark matter scattering with baryons may be treated either as a\nsimple contact interaction or as the exchange of a light mediator particle. We\nstudy an alternative, in which a continuum of light mediator states may be\nexchanged. This could arise, for instance, from coupling to a sector which is\napproximately conformal at the relevant momentum transfer scale. In the\nnon-relativistic effective theory of dark matter-baryon scattering, which is\nuseful for parametrizing direct detection signals, the effect of such continuum\nmediators is to multiply the amplitude by a function of the momentum transfer\nq, which in the simplest case is just a power law. We develop the basic\nframework and study two examples: the case where the mediator is a scalar\noperator coupling to the Higgs portal (which turns out to be highly\nconstrained) and the case of an antisymmetric tensor operator ${\\cal O}_{\\mu\n\\nu}$ that mixes with the hypercharge field strength and couples to dark matter\ntensor currents, which has an interesting viable parameter space. We describe\nthe effect of such mediators on the cross sections and recoil energy spectra\nthat could be observed in direct detection.\n", "  We report a numerical calculation of the total number of disordered jammed\nconfigurations $\\Omega$ of $N$ repulsive, three-dimensional spheres in a fixed\nvolume $V$. To make these calculations tractable, we increase the computational\nefficiency of the approach of Xu et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 245502 (2011))\nand Asenjo et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 098002 (2014)) and we extend the\nmethod to allow computation of the configurational entropy as a function of\npressure. The approach that we use computes the configurational entropy by\nsampling the absolute volume of basins of attraction of the stable packings in\nthe potential energy landscape. We find a surprisingly strong correlation\nbetween the pressure of a configuration and the volume of its basin of\nattraction in the potential energy landscape. This relation is well described\nby a power law. Our methodology to compute the number of minima in the\npotential energy landscape should be applicable to a wide range of other\nenumeration problems in statistical physics, string theory, cosmology and\nmachine learning, that aim to find the distribution of the extrema of a scalar\ncost function that depends on many degrees of freedom.\n", "  We study the spectral properties of a family of quantum antiferromagnets on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) lattices. This family of models is obtained by a\ndeformation of the well-studied 2D quantum antiferromagnetic model of Affleck,\nKennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT); they are described by two-body,\nfrustration-free Hamiltonians on a three-colourable lattice of spins. Although\nthe existence of a spectral gap in the 2D AKLT model remains an open question,\nwe rigorously prove the existence of a gap for a subset of this family of\nquantum antiferromagnets. Along with providing new progress for the gap problem\nin AKLT-type antiferromagnets in 2D, this result has implications for the\ntheory of quantum computation as it provides a family of two-body Hamiltonians\nfor which the ground state is a resource for universal quantum computation and\nfor which a spectral gap is proven to exist.\n", "  We present the results of a search for astrophysical sources of brief\ntransient neutrino emission using IceCube and DeepCore data acquired between\nMay 15th 2012 and April 30th 2013. While the search methods employed in this\nanalysis are similar to those used in previous IceCube point source searches,\nthe data set being examined consists of a sample of predominantly sub-TeV muon\nneu- trinos from the Northern Sky (-5$^{\\circ}$ < {\\delta} < 90$^{\\circ}$ )\nobtained through a novel event selection method. This search represents a first\nattempt by IceCube to identify astrophysical neutrino sources in this\nrelatively unexplored energy range. The reconstructed direction and time of\narrival of neutrino events is used to search for any significant\nself-correlation in the dataset. The data revealed no significant source of\ntransient neutrino emission. This result has been used to construct limits at\ntimescales ranging from roughly 1$\\,$s to 10 days for generic soft-spectra\ntransients. We also present limits on a specific model of neutrino emission\nfrom soft jets in core-collapse supernovae.\n", "  Moving cavities promise to be a suitable system for relativistic quantum\ninformation processing. It has been shown that an inertial and a uniformly\naccelerated one-dimensional cavity can become entangled by letting an atom emit\nan excitation while it passes through the cavities, but the acceleration\ndegrades the ability to generate entanglement. We show that in the\ntwo-dimensional case the entanglement generated is affected not only by the\ncavity's acceleration but also by its transverse dimension which plays the role\nof an effective mass.\n", "  Magnetic separators, which lie on the boundary between four\ntopologically-distinct flux domains, are prime locations in three-dimensional\nmagnetic fields for reconnection, especially in the magnetosphere between the\nplanetary and interplanetary magnetic field and also in the solar atmosphere.\nLittle is known about the details of separator reconnection and so the aim of\nthis paper, which is the first of two, is to study the properties of magnetic\nreconnection at a single separator. Three-dimensional, resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic numerical experiments are run to study separator\nreconnection starting from a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium which contains a\ntwisted current layer along a single separator linking a pair of\nopposite-polarity null points. The resulting reconnection occurs in two phases.\nThe first is short involving rapid-reconnection in which the current at the\nseparator is reduced by a factor of around 2.3. Most ($75\\%$) of the magnetic\nenergy is converted during this phase, via Ohmic dissipation, directly into\ninternal energy, with just $0.1\\%$ going into kinetic energy. During this phase\nthe reconnection occurs along most of the separator away from its ends (the\nnulls), but in an asymmetric manner which changes both spatially and temporally\nover time. The second phase is much longer and involves slow impulsive-bursty\nreconnection. Again Ohmic heating dominates over viscous damping. Here, the\nreconnection occurs in small localised bursts at random anywhere along the\nseparator.\n", "  Sudden destabilisations of the magnetic field, such as those caused by\nspontaneous reconnection, will produce waves and/or flows. Here, we investigate\nthe nature of the plasma motions resulting from spontaneous reconnection at a\n3D separator. In order to clearly see these perturbations, we start from a\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium containing two oppositely-signed null points\njoined by a generic separator along which lies a twisted current layer. The\nnature of the magnetic reconnection initiated in this equilibrium as a result\nof an anomalous diffusivity is discussed in detail in \\cite{Stevenson15_jgra}.\nThe resulting sudden loss of force balance inevitably generates waves that\npropagate away from the diffusion region carrying the dissipated current. In\ntheir wake a twisting stagnation-flow, in planes perpendicular to the\nseparator, feeds flux back into the original diffusion site (the separator) in\norder to try to regain equilibrium. This flow drives a phase of slow weak\nimpulsive-bursty reconnection that follows on after the initial\nfast-reconnection phase.\n", "  For systems with charged chiral fermions, the imbalance of chirality in the\npresence of magnetic field generates an electric current - this is the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME). We study the dynamical real-time evolution of\nelectromagnetic fields coupled by the anomaly to the chiral charge density and\nthe CME current by solving the Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations. We find that the\nCME induces the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity towards the large\ndistances, and that at late times this cascade becomes self-similar, with\nuniversal exponents. We also find that in terms of gauge field topology the\ninverse cascade represents the transition from linked electric and magnetic\nfields (Hopfions) to the knotted configuration of magnetic field\n(Chandrasekhar-Kendall states). The magnetic reconnections are accompanied by\nthe pulses of the CME current directed along the magnetic field lines. We\ndevise an experimental signature of these phenomena in heavy ion collisions,\nand speculate about implications for condensed matter systems.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the most attractive candidates for the\nacceleration sites of Galactic cosmic rays. We report the detection of GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission with the Pass 8 events recorded by Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (Fermi-LAT) in the vicinity of the shell type SNR CTB 37B that is\nlikely associated with the TeV $\\gamma-$ray source HESS J1713-381. The photon\nspectrum of CTB 37B is consistent with a power-law with an index of\n$1.89\\pm0.08$ in the energy range of $0.5-500$ GeV, and the measured flux\nconnects smoothly with that of HESS J1713-381 at a few hundred GeV. No\nsignificant spatial extension and time variation are detected. The\nmulti-wavelength data can be well fitted with either a leptonic model or a\nhadronic one. However, parameters of both models suggest more efficient\nparticle acceleration than typical SNRs. Meanwhile, the X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray\nspectral properties of CTB 37B show that it is an interesting source bridging\nyoung SNRs dominated by non-thermal emission and old SNRs interacting with\nmolecular clouds.\n", "  Lattice QCD studies on fluctuations and correlations of charm quantum number\nhave established that deconfinement of charm degrees of freedom sets in around\nthe chiral crossover temperature, $T_c$, i.e. charm degrees of freedom carrying\nfractional baryonic charge start to appear. By reexamining those same lattice\nQCD data we show that, in addition to the contributions from quark-like\nexcitations, the partial pressure of charm degrees of freedom may still contain\nsignificant contributions from open-charm meson and baryon-like excitations\nassociated with integral baryonic charges for temperatures up to $1.2~ T_c$.\nCharm quark-quasiparticles become the dominant degrees of freedom for\ntemperatures $T>1.2~ T_c$.\n", "  Breaking inversion symmetry in chiral graphene systems, \\textit{e.g.}, by\napplying a perpendicular electric field in chirally-stacked rhombohedral\nmultilayer graphene or by introducing staggered sublattice potentials in\nmonolayer graphene, opens up a bulk band gap that harbors a quantum valley-Hall\nstate. When the gap size is allowed to vary and changes sign in space, a\ntopologically-confined one-dimensional (1D) zero-line mode (ZLM) is formed\nalong the zero lines of the local gap. Here we show that gapless ZLM with\ndistinguishable valley degrees of freedom K and K$'$ exist for every\npropagation angle except for the armchair direction that exactly superpose the\nvalleys. We further analyze the role of different geometries of top-bottom\ngated device setups that can be realized in experiments, discuss the effects of\ntheir edge misalignment, and analyze three common forms of topological defects\nthat could influence the 1D ZLM transport properties in actual devices.\n", "  Consider the partition function of a classical system in two spatial\ndimensions, or the Euclidean path integral of a quantum system in two\nspace-time dimensions, both on a lattice. We show that the tensor network\nrenormalization (TNR) algorithm [\\emph{G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 115, 180405}] can be used to implement local scale transformations on\nthese objects, namely a lattice version of conformal maps. Specifically, we\nexplain how to implement the lattice equivalent of the logarithmic conformal\nmap that transforms the Euclidean plane into a cylinder. As an application, and\nwith the 2D critical Ising model as a concrete example, we use this map to\nbuild a lattice version of the scaling operators of the underlying conformal\nfield theory, from which one can extract their scaling dimensions and operator\nproduct expansion coefficients.\n", "  We present the emerging panorama of Astroparticle Physics at Eastern\nColombia, and describe several ongoing projects, most of them related to the\nLatin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) Project. This research work is carried\nout at the Grupo de Investigaciones en Relatividad y Gravitaci\\'on of\nUniversidad Industrial de Santander.\n", "  We describe tunable optical sawtooth and zigzag lattices for ultracold atoms.\nMaking use of the superlattice generated by commensurate wavelengths of light\nbeams, tunable geometries including zigzag and sawtooth configurations can be\nrealised. We provide an experimentally feasible method to fully control inter-\n($t$) and intra- ($t'$) unit-cell tunnelling in zigzag and sawtooth lattices.\nWe analyse the conversion of the lattice geometry from zigzag to sawtooth, and\nshow that a nearly flat band is attainable in the sawtooth configuration by\nmeans of tuning the lattice parameters. The bandwidth of the first excited band\ncan be reduced up to 2$\\%$ of the ground bandwidth for a wide range of lattice\nsetting. A nearly flat band available in a tunable sawtooth lattice would offer\na versatile platform for the study of interaction-driven quantum many-body\nstates with ultracold atoms.\n", "  The conventionally separated treatments for strangelets and strange stars are\nnow unified with a more comprehensive theoretical description for objects\nranging from strangelets to strange stars. After constraining the model\nparameter according to the Witten-Bodmer hypothesis and observational\nmass-radius probability distribution of pulsars, we investigate the properties\nof this kind of objects. It is found that the energy per baryon decreases\nmonotonously for increasing baryon number and reaches its minimum at the\nmaximum baryon number, corresponding to the most massive strange star. Due to\nthe quark depletion, an electric potential well for negatively charged\nparticles is formed on the surface of the quark part, which may provide some\nunique observables. For a rotational bare strange star, a magnetic field with\nthe typical strength of pulsars is generated.\n", "  Light scalar hadrons are often understood as dynamically generated\nresonances. These arise as `companion poles' in the propagators of $q\\bar{q}$\nseed states when accounting for meson-loop contributions to the self-energies\nof the latter. Following this idea, we demonstrate that for the\nscalar--isovector state $a_{0}(1450)$ the full one-loop propagator has two\npoles: a pole of the seed state $a_{0}(1450)$ and a companion pole\ncorresponding to $a_{0}(980)$. The positions of these poles are studied by\nvarying the relative coupling strength between the non-derivative and\nderivative parts of the interactions.\n", "  We address the study of gauge invariance in the Standard Model Extension\nwhich encompasses all Lorentz-violating terms originated by spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking at the Planck scale. In particular, we fully evaluate Ward\nidentities involving two and three point functions and derive the conditions\nwhich assure gauge invariance of the electromagnetic sector of the Standard\nModel Extension at one-loop. We show that momentum routing invariance is\nsufficient to fix arbitrary and regularization dependent parameters intrinsic\nto perturbation theory in the diagrams involved. A scheme which judiciously\ncollects finite but undetermined quantum corrections is employed, a\nparticularly subtle issue in the presence of $\\gamma_5$ matrices.\n", "  Titanium nitride (TiN) shows low resistivity at room temperature, high\nthermal stability and thus has the potential to serve as seed layer in magnetic\ntunnel junctions. High quality TiN thin films with regard to the\ncrystallographic and electrical properties were grown and characterized by\nX-ray diffraction and 4-terminal transport measurements. Element specific X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy revealed pure TiN in the bulk. To investigate the\ninfluence of a TiN seed layer on a ferro(i)magnetic bottom electrode, an\nout-of-plane magnetized Mn2.45Ga as well as in- and out-of-plane magnetized\nCo2FeAl thin films were deposited on a TiN buffer, respectively. The magnetic\nproperties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference\ndevice (SQUID) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) for Mn2.45Ga. Magneto optical\nKerr effect (MOKE) measurements were carried out to investigate the magnetic\nproperties of Co2FeAl. TiN buffered Mn2.45Ga thin films showed higher\ncoercivity and squareness ratio compared to unbuffered samples. The Heusler\ncompound Co2FeAl showed already good crystallinity when grown at room\ntemperature.\n", "  We study the interacting self-avoiding trail (ISAT) model on a Bethe lattice\nof general coordination $q$ and on a Husimi lattice built with squares and\ncoordination $q=4$. The exact grand-canonical solutions of the model are\nobtained, considering that up to $K$ monomers can be placed on a site and\nassociating a weight $\\omega_i$ for a $i$-fold visited site. Very rich phase\ndiagrams are found with non-polymerized (NP), regular polymerized (P) and dense\npolymerized (DP) phases separated by lines (or surfaces) of continuous and\ndiscontinuous transitions. For Bethe lattice with $q=4$ and $K=2$, the collapse\ntransition is identified with a bicritical point and the collapsed phase is\nassociated to the dense polymerized phase (solid-like) instead of the regular\npolymerized phase (liquid-like). A similar result is found for the Husimi\nlattice, which may explain the difference between the collapse transition for\nISAT's and for interacting self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. For $q=6$\nand $K=3$ (studied on the Bethe lattice only), a more complex phase diagram is\nfound, with two critical planes and two coexistence surfaces, separated by two\ntricritical and two critical end-point lines meeting at a multicritical point.\nThe mapping of the phase diagrams in the canonical ensemble is discussed and\ncompared with simulational results for regular lattices.\n", "  A definition for the entanglement entropy in a gauge theory was given\nrecently in arXiv:1501.02593. Working on a spatial lattice, it involves\nembedding the physical state in an extended Hilbert space obtained by taking\nthe tensor product of the Hilbert space of states on each link of the lattice.\nThis extended Hilbert space admits a tensor product decomposition by definition\nand allows a density matrix and entanglement entropy for the set of links of\ninterest to be defined. Here, we continue the study of this extended Hilbert\nspace definition with particular emphasis on the case of Non-Abelian gauge\ntheories.\n  We extend the electric centre definition of Casini, Huerta and Rosabal to the\nNon-Abelian case and find that it differs in an important term. We also find\nthat the entanglement entropy does not agree with the maximum number of Bell\npairs that can be extracted by the processes of entanglement distillation or\ndilution, and give protocols which achieve the maximum bound. Finally, we\ncompute the topological entanglement entropy which follows from the extended\nHilbert space definition and show that it correctly reproduces the total\nquantum dimension in a class of Toric code models based on Non-Abelian discrete\ngroups.\n", "  All-optical Compton sources are innovative, compact devices to produce high\nenergy femtosecond X-rays. Here we present results on a single-pulse scheme\nthat uses a plasma mirror to reflect the drive beam of a laser plasma\naccelerator and to make it collide with the highly-relativistic electrons in\nits wake. The accelerator is operated in the self-injection regime, producing\nquasi-monoenergetic electron beams of around 150 MeV peak energy. Scattering\nwith the intense femtosecond laser pulse leads to the emission of a collimated\nhigh energy photon beam. Using continuum-attenuation filters we measure\nsignificant signal content beyond 100 keV and with simulations we estimate a\npeak photon energy of around 500 keV. The source divergence is about 13 mrad\nand the pointing stability is 7 mrad. We demonstrate that the photon yield from\nthe source is sufficiently high to illuminate a centimeter-size sample placed\n90 centimeters behind the source, thus obtaining radiographs in a single shot.\n", "  Recently we have shown that for $2+1-$dimensional thin-shell wormholes a\nnon-circular throat may lead to a physical wormhole in the sense that the\nenergy conditions are satisfied. By the same token, herein we consider angular\ndependent throat geometry embedded in a $2+1-$dimensional flat spacetime in\npolar coordinates. It is shown that a generic, natural example of throat\ngeometry is provided remarkably by a hypocycloid. That is, two flat\n$2+1-$dimensions are glued together along a hypocycloid. The energy required in\neach hypocycloid increases with the frequency of the roller circle inside the\nlarge one.\n", "  We obtain the large deviation function for entropy production of the medium\nand its distribution function for two-site totally asymmetric simple exclusion\nprocess(TASEP) and three-state unicyclic network. Since such systems are\ndescribed through microscopic irreversible transitions, we obtain\ntime-dependent transition rates by sampling the states of these systems at a\nregular short time interval $\\tau$. These transition rates are used to derive\nthe large deviation function for the entropy production in the nonequilibrium\nsteady state and its asymptotic distribution function. The shapes of the large\ndeviation function and the distribution function depend on the value of the\nmean entropy production rate which has a non-trivial dependence on the particle\ninjection and withdrawal rates in case of TASEP. Further, it is argued that in\ncase of a TASEP, the distribution function tends to be like a Poisson\ndistribution for smaller values of particle injection and withdrawal rates.\n", "  The characterization of a physically-diverse set of transiting exoplanets is\nan important and necessary step towards establishing the physical properties\nlinked to the production of obscuring clouds or hazes. It is those planets with\nidentifiable spectroscopic features that can most effectively enhance our\nunderstanding of atmospheric chemistry and metallicity. The newly-commissioned\nLDSS-3C instrument on Magellan provides enhanced sensitivity and suppressed\nfringing in the red optical, thus advancing the search for the spectroscopic\nsignature of water in exoplanetary atmospheres from the ground. Using data\nacquired by LDSS-3C and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we search for evidence of\nwater vapor in the transmission spectrum of the Neptune-mass planet HAT-P-26b.\nOur measured spectrum is best explained by the presence of water vapor, a lack\nof potassium, and either a high-metallicity, cloud-free atmosphere or a\nsolar-metallicity atmosphere with a cloud deck at ~10 mbar. The emergence of\nmulti-scale-height spectral features in our data suggests that future\nobservations at higher precision could break this degeneracy and reveal the\nplanet's atmospheric chemical abundances. We also update HAT-P-26b's transit\nephemeris, t_0 = 2455304.65218(25) BJD_TDB, and orbital period, p =\n4.2345023(7) days.\n", "  We study the first order phase transition of the fixed-connectivity\ntriangulated surface model using the Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC)\ntechnique on relatively large lattices. From the PTMC results, we find that the\ntransition is considerably stronger than the reported ones predicted by the\nconventional Metropolis MC (MMC) technique and the flat histogram MC technique.\nWe also confirm that the results of the PTMC on relatively smaller lattices are\nin good agreement with those known results. This implies that the PTMC is\nsuccessfully used to simulate the first order phase transitions. The parallel\ncomputation in the PTMC is implemented by OpenMP, where the speed of the PTMC\non multi-core CPUs is considerably faster than that on the single-core CPUs.\n", "  The duration distribution of 947 GRBs observed by $Swift$/BAT, as well as its\nsubsample of 347 events with measured redshift, allowing to examine the\ndurations in both the observer and rest frames, are examined. Using a maximum\nlog-likelihood method, mixtures of two and three standard Gaussians are fitted\nto each sample, and the adequate model is chosen based on the value of the\ndifference in the log-likelihoods, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian\ninformation criterion. It is found that a two-Gaussian is a better description\nthan a three-Gaussian, and that the presumed intermediate-duration class is\nunlikely to be present in the $Swift$ duration data.\n", "  We present a simple generalisation of the $\\Lambda$CDM model which on the one\nhand reaches very good agreement with the present day experimental data and\nprovides an internal inflationary mechanism on the other hand. It is based on\nPalatini modified gravity with quadratic Starobinsky term and generalized\nChaplygin gas as a matter source providing, besides a current accelerated\nexpansion, the epoch of endogenous inflation driven by type III freeze\nsingularity. It follows from our statistical analysis that astronomical data\nfavors negative value of the parameter coupling quadratic term into\nEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and as a consequence the bounce instead of initial\nBig-Bang singularity is preferred.\n", "  We present a detailed study of squared local roughness (SLRDs) and local\nextremal height distributions (LEHDs), calculated in windows of lateral size\n$l$, for interfaces in several universality classes, in substrate dimensions\n$d_s = 1$ and $d_s = 2$. We show that their cumulants follow a Family-Vicsek\ntype scaling, and, at early times, when $\\xi \\ll l$ ($\\xi$ is the correlation\nlength), the rescaled SLRDs are given by log-normal distributions, with their\n$n$th cumulant scaling as $(\\xi/l)^{(n-1)d_s}$. This give rise to an\ninteresting temporal scaling for such cumulants $\\left\\langle w_n\n\\right\\rangle_c \\sim t^{\\gamma_n}$, with $\\gamma_n = 2 n \\beta + {(n-1)d_s}/{z}\n= \\left[ 2 n + {(n-1)d_s}/{\\alpha} \\right] \\beta$. This scaling is analytically\nproved for the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Random Deposition interfaces, and\nnumerically confirmed for other classes. In general, it is featured by small\ncorrections and, thus, it yields exponents $\\gamma_n$'s (and, consequently,\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $z$) in nice agreement with their respective universality\nclass. Thus, it is an useful framework for numerical and experimental\ninvestigations, where it is, usually, hard to estimate the dynamic $z$ and\nmainly the (global) roughness $\\alpha$ exponents. The stationary (for $\\xi \\gg\nl$) SLRDs and LEHDs of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class are also investigated\nand, for some models, strong finite-size corrections are found. However, we\ndemonstrate that good evidences of their universality can be obtained through\nsuccessive extrapolations of their cumulant ratios for long times and large\n$l$'s. We also show that SLRDs and LEHDs are the same for flat and curved KPZ\ninterfaces.\n", "  We report on a recent study of the ground-state octet baryon masses and sigma\nterms in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory with the\nextended-on-mass-shell scheme up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. To\ntake into account lattice QCD artifacts, the finite-volume corrections and\nfinite lattice spacing discretization effects are carefully examined. We\nperformed a simultaneous fit of all the $n_f = 2+1$ lattice octet baryon masses\nand found that the various lattice simulations are consistent with each other.\nAlthough the finite lattice spacing discretization effects up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ can be safely ignored, but the finite volume corrections\ncannot even for configurations with $M_\\phi L>4$. As an application, we\npredicted the octet baryon sigma terms using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem. In\nparticular, the pion- and strangeness-nucleon sigma terms are found to be\n$\\sigma_{\\pi N} = 55(1)(4)$ MeV and $\\sigma_{sN} = 27(27)(4)$ MeV,\nrespectively.\n", "  The results from Planck2015, when combined with earlier observations from\nWMAP, ACT, SPT and other experiments, were the first observations to disfavor\nthe \"classic\" inflationary paradigm. To satisfy the observational constraints,\ninflationary theorists have been forced to consider plateau-like inflaton\npotentials that introduce more parameters and more fine-tuning, problematic\ninitial conditions, multiverse-unpredictability issues, and a new 'unlikeliness\nproblem.' Some propose turning instead to a \"postmodern\" inflationary paradigm\nin which the cosmological properties in our observable universe are only\nlocally valid and set randomly, with completely different properties (and\nperhaps even different physical laws) existing in most regions outside our\nhorizon. By contrast, the new results are consistent with the simplest versions\nof ekpyrotic cyclic models in which the universe is smoothed and flattened\nduring a period of slow contraction followed by a bounce, and another promising\nbouncing theory, anamorphic cosmology, has been proposed that can produce\ndistinctive predictions.\n", "  We perform a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) analysis of nuclear parton\ndistribution functions (nPDFs) using neutral current charged-lepton ($\\ell\n^\\pm$ + nucleus) deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) data and Drell-Yan (DY)\ncross-section ratios $\\sigma_{DY}^{A}/\\sigma_{DY}^{A^\\prime}$ for several\nnuclear targets. We study in detail the parametrizations and the atomic mass\n(A) dependence of the nuclear PDFs at this order. The present nuclear PDFs\nglobal analysis provides us a complete set of nuclear PDFs,\n$f_i^{(A,Z)}(x,Q^2)$, with a full functional dependence on $x$, A, Q$^2$. The\nuncertainties of the obtained nuclear modification factors for each parton\nflavour are estimated using the well-known Hessian method. The nuclear charm\nquark distributions are also added into the analysis. We compare the\nparametrization results with the available data and the results of other\nnuclear PDFs groups. We found our nuclear PDFs to be in reasonably good\nagreement with them. The estimates of errors provided by our global analysis\nare rather smaller than those of other groups. In general, a very good\nagreement is achieved. We also briefly review the recent heavy-ion collisions\ndata including the first experimental data from the LHC proton+lead and\nlead+lead run which can be used in the global fits of nuclear PDFs. We\nhighlight different aspects of the high luminosity Pb--Pb and p--Pb data which\nhave been recorded by the CMS Collaboration.\n", "  We study a ground state of a non local Schrodinger operator associated with\nan evolution equation for the density of population in the stochastic contact\nmodel in continuum with inhomogeneous mortality rates. We found a new effect in\nthis model, when even in the high dimensional case the existence of a small\npositive perturbation of a special form (so-called, small paradise) implies the\nappearance of the ground state. We consider the problem in the Banach space of\nbounded continuous functions $C_b (R^d)$ and in the Hilbert space $L^2(R^d)$.\n", "  Spatially resolved observations of the planetary nebula M2-42 (PN\nG008.2-04.8) obtained with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian\nNational University 2.3 m telescope have revealed the remarkable features of\nbipolar collimated jets emerging from its main structure. Velocity-resolved\nchannel maps derived from the [N II] $\\lambda$6584 emission line disentangle\ndifferent morphological components of the nebula. This information is used to\ndevelop a three-dimensional morpho-kinematic model, which consists of an\nequatorial dense torus and a pair of asymmetric bipolar outflows. The expansion\nvelocity of about 20 km s$^{-1}$ is measured from the spectrum integrated over\nthe main shell. However, the deprojected velocities of the jets are found to be\nin the range of 80-160 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the nebular center. It is\nfound that the mean density of the collimated outflows, 595 $\\pm$ 125\ncm$^{-3}$, is five times lower than that of the main shell, 3150 cm$^{-3}$,\nwhereas their singly ionized nitrogen and sulfur abundances are about three\ntimes higher than those determined from the dense shell. The results indicate\nthat the features of the collimated jets are typical of fast, low-ionization\nemission regions.\n", "  One of the most outstanding issues in exoplanet characterization is\nunderstanding the prevalence of obscuring clouds and hazes in their\natmospheres. The ability to predict the presence of clouds/hazes a priori is an\nimportant goal when faced with limited telescope resources and advancements in\natmospheric characterization that rely on the detection of spectroscopic\nfeatures. As a means to identify favorable targets for future studies with HST\nand JWST, we use published HST/WFC3 transmission spectra to determine the\nstrength of each planet's water feature, as defined by the H2O - J index. By\nexpressing this parameter in units of atmospheric scale height, we provide a\nmeans to efficiently compare the size of spectral features over a physically\ndiverse sample of exoplanets. We find the H2O - J index to be strongly\ncorrelated with planet temperature when $T_{eq} < 750^{+90}_{-60}$ K and weakly\ncorrelated with surface gravity for planets with $\\log g < 3.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$\ndex. Otherwise, the median value of the H2O - J index is $1.8{\\pm}0.3$ H. Using\nthese two physical parameters, we identify a division between \"classes\" of\nexoplanets, such that objects above $T_{eq} = 700$ K and $\\log g = 2.8$ dex are\nmore likely to have clearer atmospheres with stronger spectral features (H2O -\nJ > 1) and those below at least one of these thresholds are increasingly likely\nto have predominantly cloudy atmospheres with muted spectral features (H2O - J\n< 1). Additional high-precision measurements are needed to corroborate the\nreported trends.\n", "  The neutral inclusion problem in two dimensional isotropic elasticity is\nconsidered. The neutral inclusion, when inserted in a matrix having a uniform\napplied field, does not disturb the field outside the inclusion. The inclusion\nconsists of the core and shell of arbitrary shapes, and their elasticity\ntensors are isotropic. We show that if the coated inclusion is neutral to a\nuniform bulk field, then the core and shell must be concentric disks, provided\nthat the shear and bulk moduli satisfy certain conditions.\n", "  Very precise measurements of exoplanet transit lightcurves both from ground\nand space based observatories make it now possible to fit the limb-darkening\ncoefficients in the transit-fitting procedure rather than fix them to\ntheoretical values. This strategy has been shown to give better results, as\nfixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important\nsystematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system\nderived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of\nthe effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have\nmostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out\nother proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model\nintensity profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic,\nsquare-root and three-parameter law do a better job than the quadratic and\nlinear laws when deriving parameters from transit lightcurves, both in terms of\nbias and precision, for a wide range of situations. We therefore recommend to\nstudy which law to use on a case-by-case basis. We provide code to guide the\ndecision of when to use each of these laws and select the optimal one in a\nmean-square error sense, which we note has a dependence on both stellar and\ntransit parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that the so-called exponential law\nis non-physical as it typically produces negative intensities close to the limb\nand should therefore not be used.\n", "  The pseudorapidity density (dN/deta) for p+p, p+A and A+A(B) collisions, and\nthe mean multiplicity <Nch> for ee, ep, and p+p collisions, are studied for an\ninclusive range of beam energies (Root_s). Characteristic scaling patterns are\nobserved for both dN/deta and <Nch>, consistent with a thermal particle\nproduction mechanism for the bulk of the soft particles produced in all of\nthese systems. They also validate an essential role for quark participants in\nthese collisions. The scaled values for dN/deta and <Nch> are observed to\nfactorize into contributions which depend on log(Root_s) and the number of\nnucleon or quark participant pairs (Npp). Quantification of these contributions\ngive expressions which serve to systematize dN/deta and <Nch> measurements\nspanning nearly four orders of magnitude in Root_s, and to predict their values\nas a function of Root_s and Npp.\n", "  We suggest that in the proper definition, Quantum Field Theories are quantum\nmechanical system which 'live' on the space of causal structures ${\\cal C}$ of\nspacetime. That is, for any QFT a Hilbert space ${\\cal H}$ on which local\noperators live is assigned not for each Lorentzian metric $g$, but for each\ncausal structure ${\\cal C}$. In practice one uses 'conformal frames' which all\nprovide equivalent descriptions of the same QFT. To put it differently, Quantum\nField Theories only know about causal structure of spacetime, and not its full\nLorentzian metric. The Weyl group and the local RG flow naturally arise when\none compares equivalent descriptions in different conformal frames. This is\nreduced to the usual RG flow of coupling constants when one only compares\ndescriptions in conformal frames related by spacetime-independent Weyl\nrescalings. We point out that in this picture minimal coupling of a QFT to the\nmetric is inconsistent and comment on the necessary violation of the\nequivalence principle in the presence of scalars.\n", "  We give an outline of an algorithm designed to reconstruct the background\ncosmological metric within the class of spherically symmetric dust universes\nthat may include a cosmological constant. Luminosity and age data are used to\nderive constraints on the geometry of the universe up to a redshift of $z =\n1.75$. It is shown that simple radially inhomogeneous void models that are\nsometimes used as alternative explanations for the apparent acceleration of the\nlate time Universe cannot be ruled out by these data alone.\n", "  Since the Gibbs distribution function always yields a density of particles\nconstant in space, in order to obtain the periodic density characteristic of a\ncrystal it is usual to mention the method of quasi-averages. In the present\npaper it is shown that the method of quasi-averages does not lead to the\nperiodic density as well as the initial Gibbs distribution. It is also\ndiscussed how the crystalline state can be investigated by means of statistical\nmechanics.\n", "  We introduced a fifth-order partial differential equation as a generalization\nof Hirota-Satsuma coupled with KdV system. This equation is investigated based\non tanh method. By applying the suitable independent variable in Hirota-Satsuma\nequation, we can convert this partial differential equations(PDE) into ordinary\ndifferential equations(ODE) .Solving the converted Hirota-Satsuma equation by\nnumerical methods we showed this equation have had soliton solution.\n", "  A droplet ejection mechanism in planar two-phase mixing layers is examined.\nAny disturbance on the gas-liquid interface grows into a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave,\nand the wave crest forms a thin liquid film that flaps as the wave grows\ndownstream. Increasing the gas speed, it is observed that the film breaks up\ninto droplets which are eventually thrown into the gas stream at large angles.\nIn a flow where most of the momentum is in the horizontal direction, it is\nsurprising to observe these large ejection angles. Our experiments and\nsimulations show that a recirculation region grows downstream of the wave and\nleads to vortex shedding similar to the wake of a backward-facing step. The\nejection mechanism results from the interaction between the liquid film and the\nvortex shedding sequence: a recirculation zone appears in the wake of the wave\nand a liquid film emerges from the wave crest; the recirculation region\ndetaches into a vortex and the gas flow over the wave momentarily reattaches\ndue to the departure of the vortex; this reattached flow pushes the liquid film\ndown; by now, a new recirculation vortex is being created in the wake of the\nwave - just where the liquid film is now located; the liquid film is blown up\nfrom below by the newly formed recirculation vortex in a manner similar to a\nbag-breakup event; the resulting droplets are catapulted by the recirculation\nvortex.\n", "  The relativistic neutrino emissivity of the nucleonic direct URCA processes\nin neutron star matter are investigated within the relativistic Hartree-Fock\napproximation. We study particularly the influences of the tensor couplings of\nvector mesons $\\omega$ and $\\rho$ on the nucleonic direct URCA processes. It is\nfound that the inclusion of the tensor couplings of vector mesons $\\omega$ and\n$\\rho$ can slightly increase the maximum mass of neutron stars. In addition,\nthe results indicate that the tensor couplings of vector mesons $\\omega$ and\n$\\rho$ lead to obvious enhancement of the total neutrino emissivity for the\nnucleonic direct URCA processes, which must accelerate the cooling rate of the\nnon-superfluid neutron star matter. However, when considering only the tensor\ncoupling of vector meson $\\rho$, the neutrino emissivity for the nucleonic\ndirect URCA processes slightly declines at low densities and significantly\nincreases at high densities.That is to say that the tensor coupling of vector\nmeson $\\rho$ leads to the slow cooling rate of a low-mass neutron star and\nrapid cooling rate of a massive neutron star.\n", "  An investigation of the effect of a destabilizing cross-stream temperature\ngradient on the transient growth phenomenon of plane Poiseuille flow and plane\nCouette flow is presented. Only the streamwise-uniform and nearly\nstreamwise-uniform disturbances are highly influenced by the Rayleigh number Ra\nand Prandtl number Pr. The maximum optimal transient growth G max of\nstreamwise-uniform disturbances increases slowly with increasing Ra and\ndecreasing Pr. For all Ra and Pr, at moderately large Reynolds numbersRe, the\nsupremum of G max is always attained for streamwise-uniform perturbations (or\nnearly streamwise-uniform perturbations, in the case of plane Couette flow)\nwhich produce large streamwise streaks and Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection rolls\n(RB). The optimal growth curves retain the same large-Reynolds-number scaling\nas in pure shear flow. A 3D vector model of the governing equations\ndemonstrates that the short-time behavior is governed by the classical lift-up\nmechanism and that the influence of Ra on this mechanism is secondary and\nnegligible. The optimal input for the largest long-time response is given by\nthe adjoint of the dominant eigenmode with respect to the energy scalar\nproduct: the RBeigenmode without its streamwise velocity component. These\nshort-time and long-time responses depict, to leading order, the optimal\ntransient growth G(t). At moderately large Ra (or small Pr at a fixed Ra), the\ndominant adjoint mode is a good approximation to the optimal initial condition\nfor all time. Over a general class of norms that can be considered as growth\nfunctions, the results remain qualitatively similar, for example, the dominant\nadjoint eigenmode still approximates the maximum optimal response.\n", "  By exploiting the exquisite selectivity of DNA hybridization, DNA-Coated\nColloids (DNACCs) can be made to self-assemble in a wide variety of structures.\nThe beauty of this system stems largely from its exceptional versatility and\nfrom the fact that a proper choice of the grafted DNA sequences yields fine\ncontrol over the colloidal interactions. Theory and simulations have an\nimportant role to play in the optimal design of self- assembling DNACCs. At\npresent, the powerful model-based design tools are not widely used, because the\ntheoretical literature is fragmented and the connection between different\ntheories is often not evident. In this Perspective, we aim to discuss the\nsimilarities and differences between the different models that have been\ndescribed in the literature, their underlying assumptions, their strengths and\ntheir weaknesses. Using the tools described in the present Review, it should be\npossible to move towards a more rational design of novel self-assembling\nstructures of DNACCs and, more generally, of systems where ligand-receptors\nbonds are used to control interactions.\n", "  Complex network approach has become an effective way to describe\ninterrelationships among large amounts of biological data, which is especially\nuseful in finding core functions and global behavior of biological systems.\nHypertension is a complex disease caused by many reasons including genetic,\nphysiological, psychological and even social factors. In this paper, based on\nthe information of biological pathways, we construct a network model of\nhypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the\ninterrelationship between genes. Statistical and topological characteristics\nshow that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and\nexhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among\nthese genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven\nkey hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb3l2, Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da.\nThese genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the\ntreatment of hypertension should focus on the combination of drugs on multiple\ngenes.\n", "  We describe 27Al NMR experiments on Ba8AlxGe46-x type-I clathrates coupled\nwith ab initio computational studies. For x=16, calculated spectra determined\nby the ab initio results gave good agreement with the measurements, with\nbest-fitting configurations also corresponding to the computed lowest-energy\natomic arrangements. Analysis of the NMR results showed that a distribution of\nKnight shifts dominates the central portion of the line. Computational results\ndemonstrate that this stems from the large variation of carrier density on\ndifferent sites. Al-deficient samples with x=12 and 13 exhibited a split\ncentral NMR peak, signaling two main local environments for Al ions, which we\nconnected to the presence of vacancies. Modeling of the wide-line spectrum for\nx=12 indicates a configuration with more Al on the 24k site than for x=16. The\nresults indicate the importance of nonbonding hybrids adjacent to the vacancies\nin the electronic structure near EF. We also address the static distortions\nfrom Pm-3n symmetry in these structures.\n", "  Fe2Al5 contains a Fe-Al matrix through which are threaded disordered\none-dimensional chains of overlapping Al sites. We report magnetic,\nnuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR), and specific-heat measurements addressing its\nmagnetic and vibrational properties. The Curie-type susceptibility is found to\nbe due to dilute moments, likely due to wrong-site Fe atoms. 27Al NMR shift and\nspin-lattice relaxation measurements confirm these to be indirectly coupled\nthrough a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida-type interaction. Specific-heat\nresults indicate a large density of low-energy vibrational modes. These\nexcitations generate a linear-T contribution to the specific heat, which\nhowever freezes out below about 10 K. These results are attributed to the\npresence of anharmonic vibrational modes associated with the disordered\nstructural chains.\n", "  High-order harmonic generation in gas targets is a widespread scheme used to\nproduce extreme ultraviolet radiation, however, it has a limited microscopic\nefficiency. Macroscopic enhancement of the produced radiation relies on\nphase-matching, often only achievable in quasi-phase-matching arrangements. In\nthe present work we numerically study quasi-phase-matching induced by\nlow-intensity assisting fields. We investigate the required assisting field\nstrength dependence on the wavelength and intensity of the driving field,\nharmonic order, trajectory class and period of the assisting field. We comment\non the optimal spatial beam profile of the assisting field.\n", "  In our recent paper [Phys. Lett. B 753, (2016) 122], we have shown that both\nthe odd and even tensor electric transition probabilities exhibit similar\nbehavior within the generalized seniority scheme in a multi-j environment. This\nmicroscopic approach was used to show for the first time the occurrence of\nseniority isomers in the $ {13}^-$ isomers of Sn-isotopes, which decay by odd\ntensor $E1$ transition to the same seniority ($\\Delta v = 0$) state. In this\nletter, we extend our studies to odd tensor $E3$ transitions connecting\ndifferent seniority states ($\\Delta v = 2$), and show for the first time that\nthe generalized seniority scheme explains reasonably well the systematics of\nthe $B(E3)$ values for the $(0^+ \\rightarrow 3_1^-)$ transitions in the\nSn-isotopes. Additionally, we support these results by seniority guided Large\nScale Shell Model (LSSM) calculations. The generalized seniority results are\nable to single out the most crucial valence space required in the LSSM\ncalculations.\n", "  From footpaths to flight routes, human mobility networks facilitate the\nspread of communicable diseases. Control and elimination efforts depend on\ncharacterizing these networks in terms of connections and flux rates of\nindividuals between contact nodes. In some cases, transport can be\nparameterized with gravity-type models or approximated by a diffusive random\nwalk. As a alternative, we have isolated intranational commercial air traffic\nas a case study for the utility of non-diffusive, heavy-tailed transport\nmodels. We implemented new stochastic simulations of a prototypical\ninfluenza-like infection, focusing on the dense, highly-connected United States\nair travel network. We show that mobility on this network can be described\nmainly by a power law, in agreement with previous studies. Remarkably, we find\nthat the global evolution of an outbreak on this network is accurately\nreproduced by a two-parameter space-fractional diffusion equation, such that\nthose parameters are determined by the air travel network.\n", "  We present a study of chiral behavior of light meson form factors in QCD with\nthree flavors of overlap quarks. Gauge ensembles are generated at single\nlattice spacing 0.12 fm with pion masses down to 300 MeV. The pion and kaon\nelectromagnetic form factors and the kaon semileptonic form factors are\nprecisely calculated using the all-to-all quark propagator. We discuss their\nchiral behavior using the next-to-next-to-leading order chiral perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  We study the vacuum polarization of planar charged Dirac fermions by a strong\nCoulomb potential. Induced vacuum charge density is calculated and analyzed at\nthe subcritical and supercritical Coulomb potentials for massless and massive\nfermions. For the massless case the induced vacuum charge density is localized\nat the origin when the Coulomb center charge is subcritical while it has a\npower-law tail when the Coulomb center charge is supercritical. The finite mass\ncontribution into the induced charge due to the vacuum polarization is small\nand insignificantly distorts the Coulomb potential only at distances of order\nof the Compton length. The induced vacuum charge has a screening sign. As is\nknown the quantum electrodynamics vacuum becomes unstable when the Coulomb\ncenter charge is increased from subcritical to supercritical values. In the\nsupercritical Coulomb potential the quantum electrodynamics vacuum acquires the\ncharge due to the so-called real vacuum polarization. We calculate the real\nvacuum polarization charge density. Screening of the Coulomb center charge are\nbriefly discussed. We expect that our results will be helpful for more deep\nunderstanding of the fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and can as\na matter of principle be tested in graphene with a supercritical Coulomb\nimpurity.\n", "  Boiling is a very efficient way to transfer heat from a heater to the liquid\ncarrier. We discuss the boiling crisis, a transition between two regimes of\nboiling: nucleate and film boiling. The boiling crisis results in a sharp\ndecrease in the heat transfer rate, which can cause a major accident in\nindustrial heat exchangers. In this communication, we present a physical model\nof the boiling crisis based on the vapor recoil effect. Under the action of the\nvapor recoil the gas bubbles begin to spread over the heater thus forming a\ngerm for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only causes its spreading,\nit also creates a strong adhesion to the heater that prevents the bubble\ndeparture, thus favoring the further spreading. Near the liquid-gas critical\npoint, the bubble growth is very slow and allows the kinetics of the bubble\nspreading to be observed. Since the surface tension is very small in this\nregime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a convex bubble shape. In the\nexperiments both in the Mir space station and in the magnetic levitation\nfacility, we directly observed an increase of the apparent contact angle and\nspreading of the dry spot under the bubble. Numerical simulations of the\nthermally controlled bubble growth show this vapor recoil effect too thus\nconfirming our model of the boiling crisis.\n", "  Quantum metrology exploits entangled states of particles to improve sensing\nprecision beyond the limit achievable with uncorrelated particles. All previous\nmethods required detection noise levels below this standard quantum limit to\nrealize the benefits of the intrinsic sensitivity provided by these states.\nRemarkably, a recent proposal has shown that, in principle, such low-noise\ndetection is not a necessary requirement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a\nwidely applicable method for entanglement-enhanced measurements without\nlow-noise detection. Using an intermediate magnification step, we perform\nsqueezed state metrology 8 dB below the standard quantum limit with a detection\nsystem that has a noise floor 10 dB above the standard quantum limit. Beyond\nits conceptual significance, this method eases implementation complexity and is\nexpected to find application in next generation quantum sensors.\n", "  We present a new method to measure a theoretically well-defined mass of the\ntop quark at the LHC. This method uses lepton energy distribution and has a\nboost-invariant nature. We perform a simulation analysis of the top mass\nreconstruction with this method for tt -> lepton+jets channel at the leading\norder. We estimate several major uncertainties in the top mass determination\nand find that they are under good control.\n", "  Categorization is crucial for content description in archiving of music\nsignals. On many occasions, human brain fails to classify the instruments\nproperly just by listening to their sounds which is evident from the human\nresponse data collected during our experiment. Some previous attempts to\ncategorize several musical instruments using various linear analysis methods\nrequired a number of parameters to be determined. In this work, we attempted to\ncategorize a number of string instruments according to their mode of playing\nusing latest-state-of-the-art robust non-linear methods. For this, 30 second\nsound signals of 26 different string instruments from all over the world were\nanalyzed with the help of non linear multifractal analysis (MFDFA) technique.\nThe spectral width obtained from the MFDFA method gives an estimate of the\ncomplexity of the signal. From the variation of spectral width, we observed\ndistinct clustering among the string instruments according to their mode of\nplaying. Also there is an indication that similarity in the structural\nconfiguration of the instruments is playing a major role in the clustering of\ntheir spectral width. The observations and implications are discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  Many car-following models are developed for jam avoidance in highways. Two\nmechanisms are used to improve the stability: feedback control with autonomous\nmodels and increasing of the interaction within cooperative ones. In this\npaper, we compare the linear autonomous and collective optimal velocity (OV)\nmodels. We observe that the stability is significantly increased by adding\npredecessors in interaction with collective models. Yet autonomous and\ncollective approaches are close when the speed difference term is taking into\naccount. Within the linear OV models tested, the autonomous models including\nspeed difference are sufficient to maximise the stability.\n", "  The growing conflicts in and about oil exporting regions and speculations\nabout volatile oil prices during the last decade have renewed the public\ninterest in predictions for the near future oil production and consumption.\nUnfortunately, studies from only 10 years ago, which tried to forecast the oil\nproduction during the next 20-30 years, failed to make accurate predictions for\ntoday's global oil production and consumption. Forecasts using economic growth\nscenarios, overestimated the actual oil production, while models which tried to\nestimate the maximum future oil production/year, using the official country oil\nreserve data, predicted a too low production.\n  In this paper, a new approach to model the maximal future regional and thus\nglobal oil production (part I) and consumption (part II) during the next\ndecades is proposed.\n  Our analysis of the regional oil production data during past decades shows\nthat, in contrast to periods when production was growing and growth rates\nvaried greatly from one country to another, remarkable similarities are found\nduring the plateau and decline periods of different countries. Following this\nmodel, the particular production phase of each major oil producing country and\nregion is determined essentially only from the recent past oil production data.\nUsing these data, the model is then used to predict the production from all\nmajor oil producing countries, regions and continents up to the year 2050. The\nlimited regional and global potential to compensate this decline with\nunconventional oil and oil-equivalents is also presented.\n", "  We present an efficient implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)\nmethod for obtaining core-level spectra including x-ray absorption (XAS), x-ray\nemission (XES), and both resonant and non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering\nspectra (N/RIXS). Calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT)\nelectronic structures generated either by abinit or Quantumespresso, both\nplane-wave basis, pseudopotential codes. This electronic structure is improved\nthrough the inclusion of a GW self energy. The projector augmented wave\ntechnique is used to evaluate transition matrix elements between core-level and\nband states. Final two-particle scattering states are obtained with the NIST\ncore-level BSE solver (NBSE). We have previously reported this implementation,\nwhich we refer to as ocean (Obtaining Core Excitations from Ab initio\nelectronic structure and NBSE) [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115106 (2011)]. Here, we\npresent additional efficiencies that enable us to evaluate spectra for systems\nten times larger than previously possible; containing up to a few thousand\nelectrons. These improvements include the implementation of optimal basis\nfunctions that reduce the cost of the initial DFT calculations, more complete\nparallelization of the screening calculation and of the action of the BSE\nHamiltonian, and various memory reductions. Scaling is demonstrated on\nsupercells of SrTiO_3 and example spectra for the organic light emitting\nmolecule Tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq_3 ) are presented. The ability\nto perform large-scale spectral calculations is particularly advantageous for\ninvestigating dilute or non-periodic systems such as doped materials, amorphous\nsystems, or complex nano-structures.\n", "  Maxwell theory is usually treated in the lab frame under the standard time\norder (light-signal clock synchronization). Particle tracking in the lab frame\nusually treats time as an independent variable. Then, the evolution of electron\nbeams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard clock\nsynchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator\ncommunity. There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first,\nLorentz's way, consists in `translating' Maxwell's electrodynamics to the\nabsolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists in\n`translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture.\nConventional particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes\nafter a transverse kick, while the orientation of the microbunching fronts\nstays unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time order, in the\nultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is\nalways perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the\nproduction of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in\nthe kicked direction without suppression. We hold a recent FEL study at the\nLCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after a\nlarge kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result\ninvoking the aberration of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling\nfields and particles. Here we give details of the Lorentz's approach used in\nthat paper. We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation' of particle\ntracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the\nstrong qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments. Previous\nsimulation results in ultrarelativistic electron beam physics should be\nreexamined in the light of the difference between particle tracking and\nelectromagnetic world-pictures.\n", "  We consider the anomalous localized resonance due to a plasmonic structure\nfor the elastostatic system in R^2. The plasmonic structure takes a general\ncore-shell-matrix form with the metamaterial located in the shell. If there is\nno core, we show that resonance occurs for a very broad class of sources. If\nthe core is nonempty and of an arbitrary shape, we show that there exists a\ncritical radius such that anomalous localized resonance (ALR) occurs. Our\nargument is based on a variational technique by making use of the primal and\ndual variational principles for the elastostatic system, along with the\nconstruction of suitable test functions.\n", "  Whether the total angular momentum of the photon can be separated into spin\nand orbital parts has been a long-standing problem due to the constraint of\ntransversality condition on its vector wavefunction. A careful analysis shows\nthat the situation arises from a misuse of the constraint in quantum mechanics.\nTo use the constraint properly, we convert the vector representation into a\ntwo-component representation in which the wavefunction is not constrained by\nany conditions. Upon doing so, we not only separate the spin conceptually from\nthe orbital angular momentum but also identify the Berry gauge in which the\ntwo-component wavefunction can be canonically quantized. A corollary is that\nonly in one particular Berry gauge can a radiation field be canonically\nquantized in terms of the plane waves. The degree of freedom to fix the Berry\ngauge, which reflects a symmetry of the constraint, turns out to have\nobservable quantum effects.\n", "  The rise in online social networking has brought about a revolution in social\nrelations. However, its effects on offline interactions and its implications\nfor collective well-being are still not clear and are under-investigated. We\nstudy the ecology of online and offline interaction in an evolutionary game\nframework where individuals can adopt different strategies of socialization.\nOur main result is that the spreading of self-protective behaviors to cope with\nhostile social environments can lead the economy to non-socially optimal\nstationary states.\n", "  We consider the propagation of Gaussian beams in a waveguide with gain and\nloss in the paraxial approximation governed by the Schr\\\"odinger equation. We\nderive equations of motion for the beam in the semiclassical limit that are\nvalid when the waveguide profile is locally well approximated by quadratic\nfunctions. For Hermitian systems, without any loss or gain, these dynamics are\ngiven by Hamilton's equations for the center of the beam and its conjugate\nmomentum. Adding gain and/or loss to the waveguide introduces a non-Hermitian\ncomponent, causing the width of the Gaussian beam to play an important role in\nits propagation. Here we show how the width affects the motion of the beam and\nhow this may be used to filter Gaussian beams located at the same initial\nposition based on their width.\n", "  A method for determining the permittivity and permeability for specimens with\nhigh refractive index and variable shape is investigated. The method extracts\nthe permeability and permittivity tensor elements from reflection measurements\nmade with a partially-filled shorted rectangular waveguide on an electrically\nsmall specimen. Measurements are performed for two isotropic, heavily loaded\ncoaxial magnetic composites. Supporting measurements from a stripline cavity\nand coaxial airline are used to validate the method. The results demonstrate\nthe methods ability to handle frequency dispersive and high index materials.\n", "  We present a possible interpretation on the origin of the four-fermion\ninteraction used in effective field theories. Inspired by the sharp momentum\npeak seen in Bose-Einstein condensate state, we incorporate the special gluon\ncondensate effect into the gluon propagator. We then find that, if one\nconsiders hypothetic situation with the condensed gluon, the four-fermion\ncontact interaction can arise from the first principle theory of quantum\nchromodynamics.\n", "  Remarkably, it has been shown that in principle, security proofs for quantum\nkey-distribution (QKD) protocols can be independent of assumptions on the\ndevices used and even of the fact that the adversary is limited by quantum\ntheory. All that is required instead is the absence of any hidden information\nflow between the laboratories, a condition that can be enforced either by\nshielding or by space-time causality. All known schemes for such Causal Key\nDistribution (CKD) that offer noise-tolerance (and, hence, must use privacy\namplification as a crucial step) require multiple devices carrying out\nmeasurements in parallel on each end of the protocol, where the number of\ndevices grows with the desired level of security. We investigate the power of\nthe adversary for more practical schemes, where both parties each use a single\ndevice carrying out measurements consecutively. We provide a novel construction\nof attacks that is strictly more powerful than the best known attacks and has\nthe potential to decide the question whether such practical CKD schemes are\npossible in the negative.\n", "  We have investigated the long-term evolution of individual anomalous X-ray\npulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) with relatively well constrained\nX-ray luminosity and rotational properties. In the frame of the fallback disc\nmodel, we have obtained the ranges of disc mass and dipole field strength that\ncan produce the observed source properties. We have compared our results with\nthose obtained earlier for dim isolated neutron stars (XDINs). Our results show\nthat (1) the X-ray luminosity, period and period derivative of the individual\nAXP/SGR sources can be produced self-consistently in the fallback disc model\nwith very similar basic disc parameters to those used earlier in the same model\nto explain the long-term evolution of XDINs, (2) except two sources, AXP/SGRs\nare evolving in the accretion phase; these two exceptional sources, like XDINs,\ncompleted their accretion phase in the past and are now evolving in the final\npropeller phase and still slowing down with the disc torques, (3) the dipole\nfield strength (at the poles) of XDINs are in the $10^{11}-10^{12}$ G range,\nwhile AXP/SGRs have relatively strong dipole fields between $1-6 \\times\n10^{12}$ G, and (4) the source properties can be obtained with large ranges of\ndisc masses which do not allow a clear test of correlation between disc masses\nand the magnetic dipole fields for the whole AXP/SGRs and XDIN population.\n", "  During the last 30 years, the search for Anderson localization of light in\nthree-dimensional (3D) disordered samples yielded a number of experimental\nobservations that were first considered successful, then disputed by opponents,\nand later refuted by their authors. This includes recent results for light in\nTiO_2 powders that T. Sperling et al. now show to be due to fluorescence and\nnot to Anderson localization (New J. Phys. 18 (2016) 013039). The difficulty of\nobserving Anderson localization of light in 3D may be due to a number of\nfactors: insufficient optical contrast between the components of the disordered\nmaterial, near-field effects, etc. The way to overcome these difficulties may\nconsist in using partially ordered materials, complex structured scatterers, or\nclouds of cold atoms in magnetic fields.\n", "  We discuss current efforts behind the curation of observing proposals,\narchive bibliographies, and data links in the NASA Astrophysics Data System\n(ADS). The primary data in the ADS is the bibliographic content from scholarly\narticles in Astronomy and Physics, which ADS aggregates from publishers, arXiv\nand conference proceeding sites. This core bibliographic information is then\nfurther enriched by ADS via the generation of citations and usage data, and\nthrough the aggregation of external resources from astronomy data archives and\nlibraries. Important sources of such additional information are the metadata\ndescribing observing proposals and high level data products, which, once\ningested in ADS, become easily discoverable and citeable by the science\ncommunity. Bibliographic studies have shown that the integration of links\nbetween data archives and the ADS provides greater visibility to data products\nand increased citations to the literature associated with them.\n", "  The solutions that describe the motion of the classical simple pendulum have\nbeen known for very long time and are given in terms of elliptic functions,\nwhich are doubly periodic functions in the complex plane. The independent\nvariable of the solutions is time and it can be considered either as a real\nvariable or as a purely imaginary one, which introduces a rich symmetry\nstructure in the space of solutions. When solutions are written in terms of the\nJacobi elliptic functions the symmetry is codified in the functional form of\nits modulus, and is described mathematically by the six dimensional coset group\n$\\Gamma/\\Gamma(2)$ where $\\Gamma$ is the modular group and $\\Gamma(2)$ is its\ncongruence subgroup of second level. In this paper we discuss the physical\nconsequences this symmetry has on the pendulum motions and it is argued they\nhave similar properties to the ones termed as duality symmetries in other areas\nof physics, such as field theory and string theory. In particular a single\nsolution of pure imaginary time for all allowed value of the total mechanical\nenergy is given and obtained as the $S$-dual of a single solution of real time,\nwhere $S$ stands for the $S$ generator of the modular group.\n", "  We prove that every proper $n$-dimensional length metric space admits an\n\"approximate isometric embedding\" into Lorentzian space $\\mathbb{R}^{3n+6,1}$.\nBy an \"approximate isometric embedding\" we mean an embedding which preserves\nthe energy functional on a prescribed set of geodesics connecting a dense set\nof points.\n", "  We construct entanglement witnesses using fundamental quantum operators of\nspin models which contain two-particle interactions and posses a certain\nsymmetry. By choosing the Hamiltonian as such an operator, our method can be\nused for detecting entanglement by energy measurement. We apply this method to\nthe cubic Heisenberg lattice model in a magnetic field, the XY model and other\nfamiliar spin systems. Our method is used to obtain a temperature bound for\nseparable states for systems in thermal equilibrium. We also study the\nBose-Hubbard model and relate its energy minimum for separable states to the\nminimum obtained from the Gutzwiller ansatz.\n"]}
