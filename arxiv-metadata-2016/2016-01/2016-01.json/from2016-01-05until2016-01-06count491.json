oppositely charged species (colloids,\nmacromolecules etc) dispersed in water are strong, and the direct mixing of\nsolutions containing such species generally yields to a precipitation, or to a\nphase separation. We have recently developed means to control the\nelectrostatically-driven attractions between nanoparticles and polymers in\nwater, and at the same time to preserve the stability of the dispersions. We\ngive here an account of the formation of supracolloidal aggregates obtained by\nco-assembly of 7 nm particles with copolymers. Nanostructured rods of length\ncomprised between 5 and 50 microns and diameter 500 nm were investigated. By\napplication of a magnetic field, the rods were found to reorient along with the\nmagnetic field lines. The kinetics of reorientation was investigated using step\nchanges of the magnetic field of amplitude 90 degrees. From the various results\nobtained, among which an exponential decay of the tangent of the angle made\nbetween the rod and the field, we concluded that the rods are\nsuperparamagnetic.\n", "  A consistent, local coordinate formulation of covariant Hamiltonian field\ntheory is presented. Whereas the covariant canonical field equations are\nequivalent to the Euler-Lagrange field equations, the covariant canonical\ntransformation theory offers more general means for defining mappings that\npreserve the form of the field equations than the usual Lagrangian description.\nIt is proved that Poisson brackets, Lagrange brackets, and canonical 2-forms\nexist that are invariant under canonical transformations of the fields. The\ntechnique to derive transformation rules for the fields from generating\nfunctions is demonstrated by means of various examples. In particular, it is\nshown that the infinitesimal canonical transformation furnishes the most\ngeneral form of Noether's theorem. We furthermore specify the generating\nfunction of an infinitesimal space-time step that conforms to the field\nequations.\n", "  The elaboration of multimodal nanoparticles stimulates tremendous interest\nowing to their numerous potentialities in many applicative fields like\noptoelectronics, photonics and especially bioimaging. The concomitant\nassociation of various properties (optical, electrochemical, magnetic) allows\nfor the use of complementary stimuli in order to probe the interactions between\nthe nanoparticles and their surroundings.Nanoparticles (NPs) have thus become\nhighly praised tools to image cells and tissues with a large contrast\ncompatible with the dimensions of biological materials and the existence of\nquantum confinement effects induced by the reduced dimensions. In this context,\nthe combination of magnetism and emissive properties such as fluorescence\nappears particularly attractive for non-invasive investigations, cell sorting\nor drug vectorization. Therefore, combining both fluorescence and magnetism\nrequires the delicate construction of hybrid assemblies. Most of the magnetic\nnanoparticles are made of metallic oxides or alloys, e.g. gamma-Fe2O3, Fe3O4,\nFePt, while the target fluorescent entities are often organic dyes or quantum\ndots (QDs).\n", "  Organisms move through the world by changing their shape, and here we explore\nthe mapping from shape space to movements in the nematode C. elegans as it\ncrawls on a planar agar surface. We characterize the statistics of the\ntrajectories through the correlation functions of the orientation angular\nvelocity, orientation angle and the mean-squared displacement, and we find that\nthe loss of orientational memory has significant contributions from both\nabrupt, large amplitude turning events and the continuous dynamics between\nthese events. Further, we demonstrate long-time persistence of orientational\nmemory in the intervals between abrupt turns. Building on recent work\ndemonstrating that C. elegans movements are restricted to a low-dimensional\nshape space, we construct a map from the dynamics in this shape space to the\ntrajectory of the worm along the agar. We use this connection to illustrate\nthat changes in the continuous dynamics reveal subtle differences in movement\nstrategy that occur among mutants defective in two classes of dopamine\nreceptors.\n", "  Non-local correlation effects in the half-filled Hubbard model on an\nisotropic triangular lattice are studied within a spin polarized extension of\nthe dual fermion approach. A competition between the antiferromagnetic\nnon-collinear and the spin liquid states is strongly enhanced by an\nincorporation of a k-dependent self-energy beyond the local dynamical\nmean-field theory. The dual fermion correc- tions drastically decrease the\nenergy of a spin liquid state while leaving the non-collinear magnetic states\nalmost non-affected. This makes the spin liquid to become a preferable state in\na certain interval of interaction strength of an order of the magnitude of a\nbandwidth. The spectral function of the spin-liquid Mott insulator is\ndetermined by a formation of local singlets which results in the energy gap of\nabout twice larger than that of the 120 degrees antiferromagnetic Neel state.\n", "  We calculate thermodynamical properties of the Hofstadter model using a\nrecently developed quantum transfer matrix method. We find intrinsic\noscillation features in specific heat that manifest the fractal structure of\nthe Hofstadter butterfly. We also propose experimental approaches which use\nspecific heat as an access to detect the Hofstadter butterfly.\n", "  Rates and CP asymmetries of the non-leptonic two-body decay of $B_c$ are\ncalculated based on the low energy effective Hamiltonian. We concentrate on\nsuch $b$ quark decays of the processes with $0^-$ and $1^-$ S-wave particles\nand/or $0^+$ and $1^+$ P-wave particles in the final states. The Salpeter\nmethod, which is the relativistic instantaneous approximation of the original\nBethe-Salpeter equation, is used to derive hadron transition matrix elements.\nBased on the calculation, it is found that the best decay channels to observe\nCP violation are $B_c^-\\rightarrow \\eta_c +D^-(D^{*-}_0)$, which need about\n$\\sim10^7$ $B_c$ events in experiment. Decays to $ \\eta_c +D^{*-}(D_s^-),\nh_c+D^-(D^{*-})(D^{*-}_0), J/\\Psi+D^{*-}$ are also hopeful channels.\n", "  Let $(M,\\omega)$ be a closed $2n$-dimensional semifree Hamiltonian\n$S^1$-manifold with only isolated fixed points. We prove that a density\nfunction of the Duistermaat-Heckman measure is log-concave. Moreover, we prove\nthat $(M,\\omega)$ and any reduced symplectic form satisfy the Hard Lefschetz\nproperty.\n", "  Let $(M,\\omega)$ be a closed $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped\nwith a Hamiltonian $T^{n-1}$-action. Then Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity\ntheorem implies that the image of the moment map is an $(n-1)$-dimensional\nconvex polytope. In this paper, we show that the density function of the\nDuistermaat-Heckman measure is log-concave on the image of the moment map.\n", "  I offer an account of how the quantum theory we have helps us explain so\nmuch. The account depends on a pragmatist interpretation of the theory: This\ntakes a quantum state to serve solely as a source of sound advice to physically\nsituated agents on the content and appropriate degree of belief about matters\nconcerning which they are currently inevitably ignorant. The general account of\nhow to use quantum states and probabilities to explain otherwise puzzling\nregularities is then illustrated by showing how we can explain single particle\ninterference phenomena, the stability of matter, and interference of\nBose-Einstein condensates. Finally I note some open problems and relate this\naccount to alternative approaches to explanation that emphasize the importance\nof causation, of unification, and of structure.\n", "  We derive the magnitude of fluctuations in total synchrotron intensity in the\nMilky Way and M33, from both observations and theory under various assumption\nabout the relation between cosmic rays and interstellar magnetic fields. Given\nthe relative magnitude of the fluctuations in the Galactic magnetic field (the\nratio of the rms fluctuations to the mean magnetic field strength) suggested by\nFaraday rotation and synchrotron polarization, the observations are\ninconsistent with local energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic\nfields. Our analysis of relative synchrotron intensity fluctuations indicates\nthat the distribution of cosmic rays is nearly uniform at the scales of the\norder of and exceeding $100\\p$, in contrast to strong fluctuations in the\ninterstellar magnetic field at those scales. A conservative upper limit on the\nratio of the the fluctuation magnitude in the cosmic ray number density to its\nmean value is 0.2--0.4 at scales of order 100\\,pc. Our results are consistent\nwith a mild anticorrelation between cosmic-ray and magnetic energy densities at\nthese scales, in both the Milky Way and M33. Energy equipartition between\ncosmic rays and magnetic fields may still hold, but at scales exceeding 1\\,kpc.\nTherefore, we suggest that equipartition estimates be applied to the observed\nsynchrotron intensity smoothed to a linear scale of kiloparsec order (in spiral\ngalaxies) to obtain the cosmic ray distribution and a large-scale magnetic\nfield. Then the resulting cosmic ray distribution can be used to derive the\nfluctuating magnetic field strength from the data at the original resolution.\nThe resulting random magnetic field is likely to be significantly stronger than\nexisting estimates.\n", "  The recently BaBar results raise the possibility that X(3872) has negative\nparity. This makes people reconsider assigning X(3872) to the $1{^1D_2}(c\\bar\nc)$ state. In this paper we give a general form of the wave function of\n$2^{-+}$ mesons. By solving the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, we get\nthe mass spectrum and corresponding wave functions. We calculate\nelectromagnetic decay widths of the first $2^{-+}$ state which we assume to be\nthe X(3872) particle. The results are $\\Gamma(2^{-+}(3872)\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\gamma) = 1.59^{+0.53}_{-0.42}$ keV, $\\Gamma(2^{-+}(3872)\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)\\gamma) = 2.87^{+1.46}_{-0.97}$ eV and $\\Gamma(2^{-+}(3872)\\rightarrow\n\\psi(3770)\\gamma) = 0.135^{+0.066}_{-0.047}$ keV. The ratio of branch fractions\nof the second and first channel is about 0.002, which is inconsistent with the\nexperimental value $3.4\\pm 1.4$. So X(3872) is unlikely to be a $2^{-+}$\ncharmonium state. In addition, we obtain a relatively large decay width for\n$2^{-+}(3872)\\rightarrow h_c\\gamma$ channel which is $392^{+62}_{-111}$ keV.\n", "  We study the consequences of cancellation of cubic Abelian anomalies in\nF-theory GUT models that utilise hypercharge flux in the presence of additional\nU(1) symmetries. We show that a mixed anomaly between the hypercharge and two\nU(1) gauge fields is not automatically canceled in local models based on the\nspectral cover and therefore imposes additional constraints on local models in\nF-theory that have not been accounted for so far. The constraints imply that\nthere are only two possible classes of models in F-theory GUTs which have\nfields on matter curves in non-complete GUT representations that are not\nvector-like under all U(1)s: the ones based on a 3+2 and 2+2+1 split. We\ncomment on some phenomenological implications of these results for realising\nNMSSM-like models from F-theory GUTs.\n", "  We investigate a multiple mirror phenomenon arising from\nBerglund-H\\\"ubsh-Krawitz mirror symmetry. We prove that the different mirror\nCalabi-Yau orbifolds which arise in this context are in fact birational to one\nanother.\n", "  Helical method of tube formation for band structure calculations and\nHartree-Fock self-consistent field method (HF-SCF) modified for periodic solids\nhave been applied in study of electronic properties of single-wall silicon\nnanotubes (SWSiNT), graphene-like parent 2D-hP silicone sheet and nanoribbons\n(SiNR). The results obtained for nanotubes of the length of ${\\approx}$ 358 \\AA\nin diameter range ${\\approx}$ 3.7 \\AA -- 116 \\AA of different helicity-types\nhave shown that only small-diameter SWSiNTs up to} ${\\varphi}${6.3 \\AA ~ are\nmetallic due to the effect of curvature which induces coupling\nof}{${\\sigma}$}{and}{${\\pi}$}{orbitals. From the calculated band structures\nfollow that irrespective of helicity, the SWSiNTs of larger diameter are all\nsmall-gap semiconductors with direct gap between the Dirac-like cones\nof}(${\\pi}$\\textsuperscript{*}, ${\\pi}$) bands{.}Gap of SWSiNTs exhibits,\nhowever, an oscillatory-decreasing character with increase of the tube\ndiameter. In the oscillatory series, minima of the gap in\n{\\textquotedblleft}saw-teeth{\\textquotedblright} pattern are reached for\nhelicity numbers m \\textsubscript{a} that are an integer multiple of 3, whilst\nm\\textsubscript{a} value itself directly determine the fold-number of\nparticular tubular rotational axis symmetry. Oscillations are damped and gap\ndecreases toward {${\\approx}$ 0.33 eV} for tube diameter {${\\approx}$ 116 \\AA\n.} {Irrespective of the width, the SiNRs are all small-gap semiconductors,\ncharacteristic by oscillatory decreasing gap with increasing ribbon widths. The\ngap of SWSiNTs and SiNRs is tuneable through modulation of tube diameter or\nribbon width, respectively.\n", "  In this note we prove Minami's estimate for a class of discrete alloy-type\nmodels with a sign-changing single-site potential of finite support. We apply\nMinami's estimate to prove Poisson statistics for the energy level spacing. Our\nresult is valid for random potentials which are in a certain sense sufficiently\nclose to the standard Anderson potential (rank one perturbations coupled with\ni.i.d. random variables).\n", "  A century on from the development of quantum theory, the interpretation of a\nquantum state is still discussed. If a physicist claims to have produced a\nsystem with a particular wave function, does this represent directly a physical\nwave of some kind, or is the wave function merely a summary of knowledge, or\ninformation, about the system? A recent no-go theorem shows that models in\nwhich the wave function is not physical, but corresponds only to an\nexperimenter's information about a hypothetical real state of the system, must\nmake different predictions from quantum theory when a certain test is carried\nout. Here we report on an experimental implementation using trapped ions.\nWithin experimental error, the results confirm quantum theory. We analyse which\nkinds of theories are ruled out.\n", "  The $1^1D_2 (c\\bar c)$ state is the ground state of spin-singlet D-wave\ncharmonia. Although it has not been found yet, the experimental data accumulate\nrapidly. This charmonium attracts more and more attention, especially when the\nBaBar Collaboration finds that the X(3872) particle has negative parity. In\nthis paper we calculate the double-gamma and double-gluon annihilation\nprocesses of $^1D_2$ charmonia and bottomonia by using the instantaneous\nBethe-Salpeter method. We find the relativistic corrections make the decay\nwidths of $1^1D_2 (c\\bar c)$ 2$\\sim$5 times smaller than the non-relativistic\nresults. If this state is below the $D^0{D^{0}}^\\ast$ threshold, we can use the\nsum of annihilation widths and EM transition widths to estimate the total decay\nwidth. Our result for $1{^1D_2} (c\\bar c)$ with $m=3820$ GeV is $\\Gamma= 432$\nkeV. The dominant decay channel $1^1D_2 (c\\bar c)\\to h_c \\gamma$, whose\nbranching ratio is about 90%, can be used to discover this state.\n", "  Three-dimensional, as well as one- and two-dimensional, studies of\nmultiplicity fluctuation are performed using AMPT model to generate central\nAu-Au collision events at ${\\sqrt s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV. Two- and three-dimensional\nnormalized factorial moments in rapidity, transverse momentum and azimuthal\nangle are found to exhibit power-low scaling when partitioning with the same\nnumber of bins in each direction, indicating that the fluctuation are\nisotropic, i.e. the fractality is self-similar in multiparticle production of\ncentral Au-Au collisions. Further, we measured the parameter ${\\nu}$ which it\ncharacterizes the intermittency indices derived in particular analysis. It is\nfound that our model result ${\\nu_{y{\\phi}p_t}}= 1.86{\\pm}0.07$ is larger than\n${\\nu} = 1.304$,which is the value of Ginzburg-Landau type of phase transition.\nWe also explored the intermittent or fluctuational dependence on the transverse\nmomentum. The result shows that the intermittency or fluctuation increase\nrapidly with the increasing of transverse momentum.\n", "  The gravitationally lensed quasar HE 1104-1805 has been observed at a variety\nof wavelengths ranging from the mid-infrared to X-ray for nearly 20 years. We\ncombine flux ratios from the literature, including recent Chandra data, with\nnew observations from the SMARTS telescope and HST, and use them to investigate\nthe spatial structure of the central regions using a Bayesian Monte Carlo\nanalysis of the microlensing variability. The wide wavelength coverage allows\nus to constrain not only the accretion disk half-light radius r_1/2, but the\npower-law slope \\xi\\ of the size-wavelength relation r_1/2 ~ \\lambda^\\xi. With\na logarithmic prior on the source size, the (observed-frame) R-band half-light\nradius log(r_1/2/cm) is 16.0+0.3-0.4, and the slope \\xi\\ is 1.0+0.30-0.56. We\nput upper limits on the source size in soft (0.4-1.2 keV) and hard (1.2-8 keV)\nX-ray bands, finding 95% upper limits on log (r_1/2/cm) of 15.33 in both bands.\nA linear prior yields somewhat larger sizes, particularly in the X-ray bands.\nFor comparison, the gravitational radius, using a black hole mass estimated\nusing the H\\beta\\ line, is log(r_g/cm) = 13.94. We find that the accretion disk\nis probably close to face-on, with cos i = 1.0 being four times more likely\nthan cos i = 0.5. We also find probability distributions for the mean mass of\nthe stars in the foreground lensing galaxy, the direction of the transverse\npeculiar velocity of the lens, and the position angle of the projected\naccretion disk's major axis (if not face-on).\n", "  Neutrinoless hadron Lepton Number Violating (LNV) decays can be induced by\nvirtual Majorana neutrino, which in turn indubitably show the Majorana nature\nof neutrinos. Many three-body LNV processes and Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV)\nprocesses have been studied extensively in theory and by experiment. As a\nsupplement, we here study 75 four-body LNV (LFV) processes from heavy\npseudoscalar $B$ and $D$ decays. Most of these processes have not been studied\nin theory and searched for in experiment, while they may have sizable decay\nrates. Since the four-body decay modes have the same vertexes and mixing\nparameters with three-body cases, so their branching fractions are comparable\nwith the corresponding three-body decays. We calculate their decay widths and\nbranching fractions with current bounds on heavy Majorana neutrino mixing\nparameters, and estimate some channels' reconstruction events using the current\nexperimental data from Belle.\n", "  The new particle Z(3930) found by the Belle and BaBar Collaborations through\nthe $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow D\\bar D$ process is identified to be the\n$\\chi_{c2}(2P)$ state. Since the mass of this particle is above the $D\\bar\nD^{(\\ast)}$ threshold, the OZI-allowed two-body strong decays are the main\ndecay modes. In this paper, these strong decay modes are studied with two\nmethods. One is the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter method within Mandelstam\nformalism. The other is the combination of the $^3P_0$ model and the former\nformalism. The total decay widths are 26.3 and 27.3 MeV for the methods with or\nwithout the $^3P_0$ vertex, respectively. The ratio of $\\Gamma_{D\\bar D}$ over\n$\\Gamma_{D\\bar D^\\ast}$ which changes along with the mass of the initial meson\nis also presented.\n", "  Simple RNA viruses efficiently encapsulate their genome into a nano-sized\nprotein shell: the capsid. Spontaneous co-assembly of the genome and the capsid\nproteins is driven predominantly by electrostatic interactions between the\nnegatively charged RNA and the positively charged inner capsid wall. Using\nfield theoretic formulation we show that the inherently branched RNA secondary\nstructure allows viruses to maximize the amount of encapsulated genome and make\nassembly more efficient, allowing viral RNAs to out-compete cellular RNAs\nduring replication in infected host cells.\n", "  This article motivated by the recent articles and results of two authors.\nRecently, J. Sadeghi and H. Farahani presented a work [1], where they include\nviscosity and analyze general model, by this way they extended models\nconsidered by M. Khurshudyan [2] and [3]. In this article, We tempt to consider\nvarying Modified Chaplygin gas model in case of variable $G$ and $\\Lambda$. It\nis well known, that varying $G$ and $\\Lambda$ gives rise to modified field\nequations and modified conservation laws. We will consider two different toy\nmodels. First model is a Universe with one component phenomenological gas of\nour consideration, while for the second model we assume existence of a composed\nfluid of gas and a matter with $P=\\omega(t)\\rho_{m}$. Sign changeable\ninteraction between fluids is accepted. We will analyze important cosmological\nparameters like EoS parameter of a fluid, deceleration parameter $q$ of the\nmodel.\n", "  We study a discrete Laplace operator $\\Delta$ on percolation subgraphs of an\ninfinite graph. The ball volume is assumed to grow at most polynomially. We are\ninterested in the behavior of the integrated density of states near the lower\nspectral edge. If the graph is a Cayley graph we prove that it exhibits\nLifshitz tails. If we merely assume that the graph has an exhausting sequence\nwith positive $\\delta$-dimensional density, we obtain an upper bound on the\nintegrated density of states of Lifshitz type.\n", "  The second order $N$-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation with pseudoharmonic\npotential is reduced to a first order differential equation by using the\nLaplace transform approach and exact bound state solutions are obtained using\nconvolution theorem. Some special cases are verified and variation of energy\neigenvalues $E_n$ as a function of dimension $N$ are furnished. To give an\nextra depth of this letter, present approach is also briefly investigated for\ngeneralized Morse potential as an example.\n", "  We study Schr\\\"odinger operators on $L^2 (\\RR^d)$ and $\\ell^2(\\ZZ^d)$ with a\nrandom potential of alloy-type. The single-site potential is assumed to be\nexponentially decaying but not necessarily of fixed sign. In the continuum\nsetting we require a generalized step-function shape. Wegner estimates are\nbounds on the average number of eigenvalues in an energy interval of finite box\nrestrictions of these types of operators. In the described situation a Wegner\nestimate which is polynomial in the volume of the box and linear in the size of\nthe energy interval holds. We apply the established Wegner estimate as an\ningredient for a localization proof via multiscale analysis.\n", "  Online social networks are known to be demographically biased. Currently\nthere are questions about what degree of representativity of the physical\npopulation they have, and how population biases impact user-generated content.\nIn this paper we focus on centralism, a problem affecting Chile. Assuming that\nlocal differences exist in a country, in terms of vocabulary, we built a\nmethodology based on the vector space model to find distinctive content from\ndifferent locations, and use it to create classifiers to predict whether the\ncontent of a micro-post is related to a particular location, having in mind a\ngeographically diverse selection of micro-posts. We evaluate them in a case\nstudy where we analyze the virtual population of Chile that participated in the\nTwitter social network during an event of national relevance: the municipal\n(local governments) elections held in 2012. We observe that the participating\nvirtual population is spatially representative of the physical population,\nimplying that there is centralism in Twitter. Our classifiers out-perform a non\ngeographically-diverse baseline at the regional level, and have the same\naccuracy at a provincial level. However, our approach makes assumptions that\nneed to be tested in multi-thematic and more general datasets. We leave this\nfor future work.\n", "  In this paper we extend our previous and only study on the dynamics of the\nChilean Web. This new study doubles the time period and to the best of our\nknowledge is the only study of its type known about any country in the Web. The\nnew results corroborate the trends found before, in particular the exponential\ngrowth of the Web, and reinforce the conclusion that the Web is more chaotic\nthan we would like. Hence, modeling most Web characteristics is not trivial.\n", "  In this paper we give a complete classification of spherically symmetric\nstatic space-times by their Noether symmetries. The determining equations for\nNoether symmetries are obtained by using the usual Lagrangian of a general\nspherically symmetric static spacetime which are integrated for each case. In\nparticular we observe that spherically symmetric static spacetimes are\ncategorized into six distinct classes corresponding to Noether algebra of\ndimensions 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 17. Using Noether`s theorem we also write down\nthe first integrals for each class of such spacetimes corresponding to their\nNoether symmetries. Some new spherically symmetric static solutions have also\nbeen obtained.\n", "  We consider massless Quantum Electrodynamics in momentum scheme and carry\nforward an approach based on Dyson-Schwinger equations to approximate both the\n$\\beta$-function and the renormalized photon self-energy [Y11]. Starting from\nthe Callan-Symanzik equation, we derive a renormalization group (RG) recursion\nidentity which implies a non-linear ODE for the anomalous dimension and extract\na sufficient but not necessary criterion for the existence of a Landau pole.\nThis criterion implies a necessary condition for QED to have no such pole.\nSolving the differential equation exactly for a toy model case, we integrate\nthe corresponding RG equation for the running coupling and find that even\nthough the $\\beta$-function entails a Landau pole it exhibits a flat\ncontribution capable of decreasing its growth, in other cases possibly to the\nextent that such a pole is avoided altogether. Finally, by applying the\nrecursion identity, we compute the photon propagator and investigate the effect\nof flat contributions on both spacelike and timelike photons.\n", "  New resonance X(3915) was identified as the charmonium $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ by\nBABAR Collaboration, but there seems still open question of this assignment:\nwhy its full width is so narrow? To answer this question, we calculate the\nOkubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) allowed strong decays $X(3915)\\to D \\bar D$, where\nX(3915) is assigned as a $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state, and estimate its full width in\nthe cooperating framework of $^3/!P_0^{}$ model and the Bethe-Salpeter (BS)\nmethod using the Mandelstam Formalism, during which non-perturbative QCD\neffects of the hadronic matrix elements are well considered by overlapping\nintegral over the relativistic Salpeter wave functions of the initial and\nfinial states. We find the node structure of $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ wave function\nresulting in the narrow width of X(3915) and show the dependence of the decay\nwidth on the variation of the initial mass of X(3915). We point out that the\nrate of $\\frac{\\Gamma(X(3915)\\to D^+ D^-)}{\\Gamma(X(3915)\\to D^0 \\bar D^0)}$ is\ncrucial to confirm whether X(3915) is the $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state or not.\n", "  Two simple model operators are considered which have pre-existing resonances.\nA potential corresponding to a small electric field, $f$, is then introduced\nand the resonances of the resulting operator are considered as $f\\to0$. It is\nshown that these resonances are not continuous in this limit. It is conjectured\nthat a similar behavior will appear in more complicated models of atoms and\nmolecules. Numerical results are presented.\n", "  We study the conformal vertex algebras which naturally arise in relation to\nthe Nakajima-Yoshioka blow-up equations.\n", "  Magnetic particles are very efficient Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\ncontrast agents. In the recent years, chemists have unleashed their imagination\nto design multi-functional nanoprobes for biomedical applications including MRI\ncontrast enhancement. This study is focused on the direct relationship between\nthe size and magnetization of the particles and their nuclear magnetic\nresonance relaxation properties, which condition their efficiency. Experimental\nrelaxation results with maghemite particles exhibiting a wide range of sizes\nand magnetizations are compared to previously published data and to\nwell-established relaxation theories with a good agreement. This allows\nderiving the experimental master curve of the transverse relaxivity versus\nparticle size and to predict the MRI contrast efficiency of any type of\nmagnetic nanoparticles. This prediction only requires the knowledge of the size\nof the particles impermeable to water protons and the saturation magnetization\nof the corresponding volume. To predict the T2 relaxation efficiency of\nmagnetic single crystals, the crystal size and magnetization obtained through a\nsingle Langevin fit of a magnetization curve is the only information needed.\nFor contrast agents made of several magnetic cores assembled into various\ngeometries (dilute fractal aggregates, dense spherical clusters, core-shell\nmicelles, hollow vesicles), one needs to know a third parameter, namely the\nintra-aggregate volume fraction occupied by the magnetic materials relatively\nto the whole (hydrodynamic) sphere. Finally a calculation of the maximum\nachievable relaxation effect and the size needed to reach this maximum is\nperformed for different cases: maghemite single crystals and dense clusters,\ncore-shell particles (oxide layer around a metallic core) and zinc manganese\nferrite crystals.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the classical Ising model on the Cayley tree of\norder k and show the existence of the phase transition in the following sense:\nthere exists two quantum Markov states which are not quasi-equivalent. It turns\nout that the found critical temperature coincides with usual critical\ntemperature.\n", "  We describe the development of a proton Computed Tomography (pCT) scanner at\nNorthern Illinois University (NIU) in collaboration with Fermilab and Delhi\nUniversity. This paper provides an overview of major components of the scanner\nand a detailed description of the data acquisition system (DAQ).\n", "  We classify the four-dimensional purely fermionic gauge theories that give a\nUV completion of composite Higgs models. Our analysis is at the group\ntheoretical level, addressing the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for\nthe viability of these models, such as the existence of top partners and\ncustodial symmetry. The minimal cosets arising are those of type SU(5)/SO(5)\nand SU(4)/Sp(4). We list all the possible \"hyper-color\" groups allowed and\npoint out the simplest and most promising ones.\n", "  We investigate quantum transport in binary tree structures and in hypercubes\nfor the disordered Frenkel-exciton Hamiltonian under pure dephasing noise. We\ncompute the energy transport efficiency as a function of disorder and dephasing\nrates. We demonstrate that dephasing improves transport efficiency not only in\nthe disordered case, but also in the ordered one. The maximal transport\nefficiency is obtained when the dephasing timescale matches the hopping\ntimescale, which represent new examples of the Goldilocks principle at the\nquantum scale. Remarkably, we find that in weak dephasing regimes, away from\noptimal levels of environmental fluctuations, the average effect of increasing\ndisorder is to improve the transport efficiency until an optimal value for\ndisorder is reached. Our results suggest that rational design of the site\nenergies statistical distributions could lead to better performances in\ntransport systems at nanoscale when their natural environments are far from the\noptimal dephasing regime.\n", "  Starting from the Poincare Gauge principle and a Starobinsky-Yang-Mills type\nLagrangian a model of dark energy is developed. In order to evade any\nunnecessary controversy regarding frames (i.e. Einstein .vs. Jordan) the theory\nis treated using the original variables instead of transforming them to a\nscalar-tensor theory. The field equations are derived directly from the\noriginal Lagrangian using the variational principle. The cosmological equations\nare different from the Friedmann equations, but the acceleration equation gives\nthe same result as the one of the $\\Lambda $CDM model in the matter-dominated\nera. Furthermore, it indicates an inflation in the early time and the\nradiation-dominated era as the Starobinsky model. The cosmological constant\nnaturally emerges from the Yang-Mills terms of the Lagrangian rather than be\nadded artificially. The equation of state of the dark energy depends on the\ndensity of the matter and then the coincidence and fine tuning problem is\nsolved naturally.\n  In order to compare with the popular $\\Lambda $CDM model, the cosmological\nperturbations is investigated. The equations for linear perturbations of the\nmetric and for the density contrast growth are derived. The explicit analytic\nsolutions are obtained. The gravitational potential and the growth of the\nbaryon matter density perturbation can be used to clarify whether this model is\nin agreement with standard $\\Lambda $CDM predictions and experimental data.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the mixing time of the simple exclusion process\non the circle with $N$ sites, with a number of particle $k(N)$ tending to\ninfinity, both from the worst initial condition and from a typical initial\ncondition. We show that the worst-case mixing time is asymptotically equivalent\nto $(8\\pi^2)^{-1}N^2\\log k$, while the cutoff window, is identified to be\n$N^2$. Starting from a typical condition, we show that there is no cutoff and\nthat the mixing time is of order $N^2$.\n", "  We consider a self-avoiding walk on the dual $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ lattice. This\nwalk can traverse the same square twice but cannot cross the same edge more\nthan once. The weight of each square visited by the walk depends on the way the\nwalk passes through it and the weight of the whole walk is calculated as a\nproduct of these weights. We consider a family of critical weights parametrized\nby angle $\\theta\\in[\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\frac{2\\pi}{3}]$. For $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$,\nthis can be mapped to the self-avoiding walk on the honeycomb lattice. The\nconnective constant in this case was proved to be equal to $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}$\nby Duminil-Copin and Smirnov in \\cite{DS10}. We generalize their result.\n", "  The early 21st century witnesses a dramatic rise in the study of thermal\nradiation of neutron stars. Modern space telescopes have provided a wealth of\nvaluable information which, when properly interpreted, can elucidate the\nphysics of superdense matter in the interior of these stars. This\ninterpretation is necessarily based on the theory of formation of neutron star\nthermal spectra, which, in turn, is based on plasma physics and on the\nunderstanding of radiative processes in stellar photospheres. In this paper,\nthe current status of the theory is reviewed with particular emphasis on\nneutron stars with strong magnetic fields. In addition to the conventional deep\n(semi-infinite) atmospheres, radiative condensed surfaces of neutron stars and\n\"thin\" (finite) atmospheres are considered.\n", "  A scheme is proposed to construct integer and fractional topological quantum\nstates of fermions in two spatial dimensions. We devise models for such states\nby coupling wires of non-chiral Luttinger liquids of electrons, that are\narranged in a periodic array. Which inter-wire couplings are allowed is\ndictated by symmetry and the compatibility criterion that they can\nsimultaneously acquire a finite expectation value, opening a spectral gap\nbetween the ground state(s) and all excited states in the bulk. First, with\nthese criteria at hand, we reproduce the tenfold classification table of\ninteger topological insulators, where their stability against interactions\nbecomes immediately transparent in the Luttinger liquid description. Second, we\nconstruct an example of a strongly interacting fermionic topological phase of\nmatter with short-range entanglement that lies outside of the tenfold\nclassification. Third, we expand the table to long-range entangled topological\nphases with intrinsic topological order and fractional excitations.\n", "  Economic integration, globalization and financial crises represent examples\nof processes whose understanding requires the analysis of the underlying\nnetwork structure. Of particular interest is establishing whether a real\neconomic network is in a state of (quasi)stationary equilibrium, i.e.\ncharacterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions.\nWhile in the former case the behaviour of the system can be reasonably\ncontrolled and predicted, in the latter case this is generally impossible.\nHere, we propose a method to assess whether a real economic network is in a\nquasi-stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution\nwith appropriate quasi-equilibrium maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As\nillustrative examples, we consider the International Trade Network (ITN) and\nthe Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We find that the ITN is an almost perfect\nexample of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly\nout-of-equilibrium. In the latter, the entity of the deviation from\nquasi-stationarity contains precious information that allows us to identify\nremarkable early warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008. These early\nwarning signals involve certain dyadic and triadic topological properties,\nincluding dangerous 'debt loops' with different levels of interbank\nreciprocity.\n", "  We find the angular Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states (or the\ntwisted kink crystals) in which a phase and an amplitude of a pair potential\nmodulate simultaneously in a quasi-onedimensional superconducting ring with a\nstatic Zeeman magnetic field applied on the ring and static Aharonov-Bohm\nmagnetic flux penetrating the ring. The superconducting ring with magnetic flux\nproduces a persistent current, whereas the Zeeman split of Fermi energy results\nin the spatial modulation of the pair potential. We show that these two\nmagnetic fields stabilize the FFLO phase in a large parameter region of the\nmagnetic fields. We further draw the phase diagram with the two kinds of\nfirst-order phase transitions; one corresponds to phase slips separating the\nAharonov-Bohm magnetic flux, and the other separates the number of peaks of the\npair amplitude for the Zeeman magnetic field.\n", "  Observing constituent particles with fractional quantum numbers in confined\nand deconfined states is an interesting and challenging problem in quantum\nmany-body physics. Here we further explore a computational scheme [Y. Tang and\nA. W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 107}, 157201 (2011)] based on valence-bond\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin systems. Using several\ndifferent one-dimensional models, we characterize $S=1/2$ spinon excitations\nusing the spinon size and confinement length (the size of a bound state). The\nspinons have finite size in valence-bond-solid states, infinite size in the\ncritical region, and become ill-defined in the N\\'eel state. We also verify\nthat pairs of spinons are deconfined in these uniform spin chains but become\nconfined upon introducing a pattern of alternating coupling strengths\n(dimerization) or coupling two chains (forming a ladder). In the dimerized\nsystem an individual spinon can be small when the confinement length is\nlarge---this is the case when the imposed dimerization is weak but the ground\nstate of the corresponding uniform chain is a spontaneously formed\nvalence-bond-solid (where the spinons are deconfined). Based on our numerical\nresults, we argue that the situation $\\lambda \\ll \\Lambda$ is associated with\nweak repulsive short-range spinon-spinon interactions. In principle both the\nlength-scales can be individually tuned from small to infinite (with $\\lambda\n\\le \\Lambda$) by varying model parameters. In the ladder system the two lengths\nare always similar, and this is the case also in the dimerized systems when the\ncorresponding uniform chain is in the critical phase. In these systems the\neffective spinon-spinon interactions are purely attractive and there is only a\nsingle large length scale close to criticality, which is reflected in the\nstandard spin correlations as well as in the spinon characteristics.\n", "  The ultrarelativistic boosting procedure had been applied in the literature\nto map the metric of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime into a metric describing\nde Sitter spacetime plus a shock-wave singularity located on a null\nhypersurface. This paper evaluates the Riemann curvature tensor of the boosted\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter metric by means of numerical calculations, which make\nit possible to reach the ultrarelativistic regime gradually by letting the\nboost velocity approach the speed of light. Thus, for the first time in the\nliterature, the singular limit of curvature through Dirac's delta distribution\nand its derivatives is numerically evaluated for this class of spacetimes.\nEventually, the analysis of the Kretschmann invariant and the geodesic equation\nshow that the spacetime possesses a scalar curvature singularity within a\n3-sphere and it is possible to define what we here call boosted horizon, a sort\nof elastic wall where all particles are surprisingly pushed away, as numerical\nanalysis demonstrates. This seems to suggest that boosted geometries are ruled\nby a sort of antigravity effect since all geodesics seem to refuse to enter the\nboosted horizon, even though their initial conditions are aimed at driving the\nparticles towards the boosted horizon.\n", "  The finite size effect of electron and nucleus is accounted for in the model\nof atom. Due to their hard sphere repulsion the energy of the 1s orbital\ndecreases and the corrections amount up to 8% in Uranium. Several models for\nboundary conditions on the atomic nucleus surface are discussed as well.\n", "  Two important cases, where boundary conditions and solutions of the\nwell-known integrable equations on a semi-strip are uniquely determined by the\ninitial conditions, are rigorously studied in detail. First, the case of\nrectangular matrix solutions of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith quasi-analytic boundary conditions is dealt with. (The result is new even\nfor a scalar nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.) Next, a special case of the\nnonlinear optics ($N$-wave) equation is considered.\n", "  In the context of phenomenological models of quantum gravity, it is claimed\nthat the ultraviolet and infrared natural cutoffs can be realized from local\ndeformations of the Hamiltonian systems. In this paper, we scrutinize this\nhypothesis and formulate a cutoff-regularized Hamiltonian system. The results\nshow that while local deformations are necessary to have cutoffs, they are not\nsufficient. In fact, the cutoffs can be realized from globally-deformed\nHamiltonian systems that are defined on compact symplectic manifolds. By taking\nthe universality of quantum gravity effects into account, we then conclude that\nquantum gravity cutoffs are global (topological) properties of the symplectic\nmanifolds. We justify our results by considering three well-known examples: The\nMoyal, Snyder and polymer deformed Hamiltonian systems.\n", "  The influence of the tantalum buffer layer on the magnetic anisotropy of\nperpendicular Co-Fe-B/MgO based magnetic tunnel junctions is studied using\nmagneto-optical Kerr-spectroscopy. Samples without a tantalum buffer are found\nto exhibit no perpendicular magnetization. The transport of Boron into the\ntantalum buffer is considered to play an important role on the switching\ncurrents of those devices. With the optimized layer stack of a perpendicular\ntunnel junction, a minimal critical switching current density of only 9.2\nkA/cm$^2$ is observed. As of today, this value is the lowest reported value for\ncurrent-induced magnetization reversal.\n", "  The tunneling formalism in the Hamilton-Jacobi approach is adopted to study\nHawking radiation of massless Dirac particles from spherically symmetric black\nhole spacetimes incorporating the effects of the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple. The Hawking temperature is found to contain corrections from the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle. Further, we show from this result that the\nratio of the GUP corrected energy of the particle to the GUP corrected Hawking\ntemperature is equal to the ratio of the corresponding uncorrected quantities.\nThis result is then exploited to compute the Hawking temperature for more\ngeneral forms of the uncertainty principle having infinite number of terms.\nChoosing the coefficients of the terms in the series in a specific way enables\none to sum the infinite series exactly. This leads to a Hawking temperature for\nthe Schwarzschild black hole that agrees with the result which accounts for the\none loop back reaction effect. The entropy is finally computed and yields the\narea theorem upto logarithmic corrections.\n", "  The standard formalism for the co-evolution of halos and dark matter predicts\nthat any initial halo velocity bias rapidly decays to zero. We argue that, when\nthe purpose is to compute statistics like power spectra etc., the coupling in\nthe momentum conservation equation for the biased tracers must be modified. Our\nnew formulation predicts the constancy in time of any statistical halo velocity\nbias present in the initial conditions, in agreement with peak theory. We test\nthis prediction by studying the evolution of a conserved halo population in\nN-body simulations. We establish that the initial simulated halo density and\nvelocity statistics show distinct features of the peak model and, thus, deviate\nfrom the simple local Lagrangian bias. We demonstrate, for the first time, that\nthe time evolution of their velocity is in tension with the rapid decay\nexpected in the standard approach.\n", "  The anomalous dimensions of operators in the purely gluonic SU(2,1|2) sector\nof any planar conformal N=2 theory can be read off from the N=4 SYM results by\nreplacing the N=4 coupling constant by an interpolating function of the N=2\ncoupling constants, to which we refer to as the effective coupling. For a large\nclass of N=2 theories we compute the weak coupling expansion of these functions\nas well as the leading strong coupling term by employing supersymmetric\nlocalization. Via Feynman diagrams, we interpret our results as the relative\n(between N=2 and N=4) finite renormalization of the coupling constant. Using\nthe AdS/CFT dictionary, we identify the effective couplings with the effective\nstring tensions of the corresponding gravity dual theories. Thus, any\nobservable in the SU(2,1|2) sector can be obtained from its N=4 counterpart by\nreplacing the N=4 coupling constant by the universal, for a given theory,\neffective coupling.\n", "  Non-equilibrium active matter made up of self-driven particles with\nshort-range repulsive interactions is a useful minimal system to study active\nmatter as the system exhibits collective motion and nonequilibrium\norder-disorder transitions. We studied high-aspect-ratio self-propelled rods\nover a wide range of packing fraction and driving to determine the\nnonequilibrium state diagram and dynamic properties. Flocking and\nnematic-laning states occupy much of the parameter space. In the flocking state\nthe average internal pressure is high and structural and mechanical relaxation\ntimes are long, suggesting that rods in flocks are in a translating glassy\nstate despite overall flock motion. In contrast, the nematic-laning state shows\nfluid-like behavior. The flocking state occupies regions of the state diagram\nat both low and high packing fraction separated by nematic-laning at low\ndriving and a history-dependent region at higher driving; the nematic-laning\nstate transitions to the flocking state for both compression and expansion. We\npropose that the laning-flocking transitions are a type of glass transition\nwhich, in contrast to other glass-forming systems, can show fluidization as\ndensity increases. The fluid internal dynamics and ballistic transport of the\nnematic-laning state may promote collective dynamics of rod-shaped\nmicroorganisms.\n", "  Strong Stokes and anti-Stokes one-photon luminescence from single gold\nnanorods is measured in experiments. It is found that the intensity and\npolarization of the Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions are in strong correlation.\nOur experimental observation discovered a coherent process in light emission\nfrom single gold nanorods. We present a theoretical mode, based on the concept\nof cavity resonance, for consistently understanding both Stokes and anti-Stokes\nphotoluminescence. Our theory is in good agreement of all our measurements.\n", "  The rare processes $B_c\\to D_{(s)J} ^{(*)}\\mu\\bar{\\mu}$, where\n$D_{(s)J}^{(*)}$ stands for the final meson $D_{s0}^*(2317)$,\n$D_{s1}(2460,2536)$,~$D_{s2}^*(2573)$, $D_0^*(2400)$, $D_{1}(2420,2430)$\nor~$D_{2}^*(2460)$, are studied within the Standard Model. The hadronic matrix\nelements are evaluated in the Bethe-Salpeter approach and furthermore a\ndiscussion on the gauge-invariant condition of the annihilation hadronic\ncurrents is presented. Considering the penguin, box, annihilation,\ncolor-favored cascade and color-suppressed cascade contributions, the\nobservables $\\text{d}Br/\\text{d}Q^2$, $A_{LPL}$, $A_{FB}$ and $P_L$ are\ncalculated.\n", "  Applying the separated spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics to\ntwo-dimensional electron gas in plane samples and nanotubes located in external\nmagnetic fields we find new kind of wave in electron gas, which is called the\nspin-electron acoustic wave. Separate spin-up electrons and spin-down electrons\nevolution reveals in replacement of the Langmuir wave by the couple of hybrid\nwaves. One of two hybrid waves is the modified Langmuir wave. Another hybrid\nwave is the spin-electron acoustic wave. We study dispersion of these waves in\ntwo dimensional structures of electrons. We also consider dependence of\ndispersion properties on spin polarisation of electrons in external magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The thermodynamics of a scheme of dark matter-dark energy interaction is\nstudied considering a holographic model for the dark energy in a flat\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson- Walker background. We obtain a total entropy rate\nfor a general horizon and we study the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics\nfor a cosmological interaction as a free function. Additionally, we discuss two\nhorizons related to the Ricci and Ricci-like model and its effect on an\ninteracting system.\n", "  The design, construction, and preliminary testing of a second generation\nproton CT scanner is presented. All current treatment planning systems at\nproton therapy centers use X-ray CT as the primary imaging modality for\ntreatment planning to calculate doses to tumor and healthy tissues. One of the\nlimitations of X-ray CT is in the conversion of X-ray attenuation coefficients\nto relative (proton) stopping powers, or RSP. This results in more proton range\nuncertainty, larger target volumes and therefore, more dose to healthy tissues.\nTo help improve this, we present a novel scanner capable of high dose rates, up\nto 2~MHz, and large area coverage, 20~x~24~cm$^2$, for imaging an adult head\nphantom and reconstructing more accurate RSP values.\n", "  Spin orbit torque (SOT) provides an efficient way of generating spin current\nthat promises to significantly reduce the current required for switching\nnanomagnets. However, an in-plane current generated SOT cannot\ndeterministically switch a perpendicularly polarized magnet due to symmetry\nreasons. On the other hand, perpendicularly polarized magnets are preferred\nover in-plane magnets for high-density data storage applications due to their\nsignificantly larger thermal stability in ultra-scaled dimensions. Here we show\nthat it is possible switch a perpendicularly polarized magnet by SOT without\nneeding an external magnetic field. This is accomplished by engineering an\nanisotropy in the magnets such that the magnetic easy axis slightly tilts away\nfrom the film-normal. Such a tilted anisotropy breaks the symmetry of the\nproblem and makes it possible to switch the magnet deterministically. Using a\nsimple Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta heterostructure, we demonstrate reversible switching of\nthe magnetization by reversing the polarity of the applied current. This\ndemonstration presents a new approach for controlling nanomagnets with spin\norbit torque.\n", "  On a five dimensional simply connected Sasaki-Einstein manifold, one can\nconstruct Yang-Mills theories coupled to matter with at least two\nsupersymmetries. The partition function of these theories localises on the\ncontact instantons, however the contact instanton equations are not elliptic.\nIt turns out that these equations can be embedded into the Haydys-Witten\nequations (which are elliptic) in the same way the 4D anti-self-dual instanton\nequations are embedded in the Vafa-Witten equations. We show that under some\nfavourable circumstances, the latter equations will reduce to the former by\nproving some vanishing theorems. It was also known that the Haydys-Witten\nequations on product manifolds $M_5=M_4\\times \\mathbb{R}$ arise in the context\nof twisting the 5D maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In this paper,\nwe present the construction of twisted $N=2$ Yang-Mills theory on\nSasaki-Einstein manifolds, and more generally on $K$-contact manifolds. The\nlocalisation locus of this new theory thus provides a covariant version of the\nHaydys-Witten equation.\n", "  Systemic risks of default contagion in the Russian interbank market are\ninvestigated. The analysis is based on considering the bow-tie structure of the\nweighted oriented graph describing the structure of the interbank loans. A\nprobabilistic model of interbank contagion explicitly taking into account the\nempirical bow-tie structure reflecting functionality of the corresponding nodes\n(borrowers, lenders, borrowers and lenders simultaneously), degree\ndistributions and disassortativity of the interbank network under consideration\nbased on empirical data is developed. The characteristics of contagion-related\nsystemic risk calculated with this model are shown to be in agreement with\nthose of explicit stress tests.\n", "  Due to the complexity and inconstancy of the space environment, accurate\nmathematical models for spacecraft rendezvous are difficult to obtain, which\nconsequently complicates the control tasks. In this paper, a linearized\ntime-variant plant model with external perturbations is adopted to approximate\nthe real circumstance. To realize the robust stability with optimal performance\ncost, a partially independent control scheme is proposed, which consists of a\nrobust anti-windup controller for the in-plane motion and a ${{H}_{\\infty}}$\ncontroller for the out-of-plane motion. Finally, a rendezvous simulation is\ngiven to corroborate the practicality and advantages of the partially\nindependent control scheme over a coupled control scheme.\n", "  Quasiparticle collapsing is a central issue in the study of strongly\ncorrelated electron systems. In the one-dimensional case, the quasiparticle\ncollapsing in a form of spin-charge separation has been well established, but\nthe problem remains elusive in dimensions higher than one. By using density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, we show that in an anisotropic\ntwo-leg $t$-$J$ ladder, an injected single hole behaves like a well-defined\nquasiparticle in the strong rung limit, but undergoes a \"phase transition\" with\nthe effective mass diverging at a quantum critical point (QCP) towards the\nisotropic limit. After the transition, the quasiparticle collapses into a\ncomposite object of a self-localized charge (holon) and a deconfined spin-1/2\n(spinon), accompanied by a substantially enhanced binding energy between two\nholes. A phase diagram of multi-leg ladders is further obtained, which\nextrapolates the QCP towards the two-dimensional limit. The underlying novel\nmechanism generic for any dimensions is also discussed.\n", "  I consider a special atomic scattering problem where the target atom has\ndistinct \"soft\" and \"hard\" excitation modes. I demonstrate that in this problem\nthe integration out of \"short-distance\" (or \"high-energy\") physics may occur\nautomatically in the regular perturbative calculations, i.e., it may occur\nwithout any cut off and renormalization. Not only that, the soft inelastic\nprocesses happen already in the first Born approximation and the inclusive\ncross-sections become unavoidable from the very beginning. All that is possible\nbecause of correct physical and mathematical formulation of the problem. I\npropose to build QFT in a similar way.\n", "  We show that Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry can host\nchiral electromag- netic waves. The magnetization that results in a momentum\nspace separation of a pair of opposite chirality Weyl nodes is also responsible\nfor the non-zero gyrotropy parameter in the system. It is then shown that a\nchiral electromagnetic wave can propagate in a region of space where the\ngyrotropy parameter changes sign. Such waves are analogs of quantum Hall edge\nstates for photons.\n", "  In this paper we will present Lagrangian and Hamiltonian $k$-symplectic\nformalisms, we will recall the notions of symmetry and conservation law and we\nwill define the notion of pseudosymmetry as a natural extension of symmetry.\nUsing symmetries and pseudosymmetries, without the help of a Noether type\ntheorem, we will obtain new kinds of conservation laws for $k$-symplectic\nHamiltonian systems and $k$-symplectic Lagrangian systems.\n", "  We consider fractional quantum Hall states built on Laughlin's original\nN-body wave-functions, i.e., they are of the form holomorphic times gaussian\nand vanish when two particles come close, with a given polynomial rate. Such\nstates appear naturally when looking for the ground state of 2D particles in\nstrong magnetic fields, interacting via repulsive forces and subject to an\nexternal potential due to trapping and/or disorder. We prove that all functions\nin this class satisfy a universal local density upper bound, in a suitable weak\nsense. Such bounds are useful to investigate the response of fractional quantum\nHall phases to variations of the external potential. Contrary to our previous\nresults for a restricted class of wave-functions, the bound we obtain here is\nnot optimal, but it does not require any additional assumptions on the\nwave-function, besides analyticity and symmetry of the pre-factor modifying the\nLaughlin function.\n", "  We discuss how to analytically obtain an -- essentially infinite -- Matrix\nProduct State (MPS) representation of the ground state of the XY model. On the\none hand this allows to illustrate how the Ornstein-Zernike form of the\ncorrelation function emerges in the exact case using standard MPS language. On\nthe other hand we study the consequences of truncating the bond dimension of\nthe exact MPS, which is also part of many tensor network algorithms, and\nanalyze how the truncated MPS transfer matrix is representing the dominant part\nof the exact quantum transfer matrix. In the gapped phase we observe that the\ncorrelation length obtained from a truncated MPS approaches the exact value\nfollowing a power law in effective bond dimension. In the gapless phase we find\na good match between a state obtained numerically from standard MPS techniques\nwith finite bond dimension, and a state obtained by effective finite imaginary\ntime evolution in our framework. This provides a direct hint for a geometric\ninterpretation of Finite Entanglement Scaling at the critical point in this\ncase. Finally, by analyzing the spectra of transfer matrices, we support the\ninterpretation put forward by [V. Zauner at. al., New J. Phys. 17, 053002\n(2015)] that the MPS transfer matrix emerges from the quantum transfer matrix\nthough the application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalisation Group along the\nimaginary-time direction.\n", "  We report new observation of cooperative paramagnetic fluctuations of\nRu$^{4+}$ spins that coexist with the non-Fermi liquid state in CaRuO$_{3}$\nperovskite below T $\\simeq$ 22 K. Detailed electrical, magnetic and neutron\nscattering measurements reveal that the Ru$^{4+}$ ions reside in magnetic field\nindependent random domains with dynamic properties that are reminiscent of the\ncooperative paramagnetic fluctuations. The linear ($E/T$) scaling of the\ndynamic susceptibilities and divergence of the mean relaxation time as\n$T$$\\rightarrow$~0 K suggest quasi-local critical nature of the spin\nfluctuations. We argue that the non-Fermi liquid behavior arises due to the\nquantum critical nature of the cooperative paramagnetic fluctuations in\nCaRuO$_{3}$\n", "  A system of two exchange-coupled Kondo impurities in a magnetic field gives\nrise to a rich phase space hosting a multitude of correlated phenomena.\nMagnetic atoms on surfaces probed through scanning tunnelling microscopy\nprovide an excellent platform to investigate coupled impurities, but typical\nhigh Kondo temperatures prevent field-dependent studies from being performed,\nrendering large parts of the phase space inaccessible. We present an integral\nstudy of pairs of Co atoms on insulating Cu2N/Cu(100), which each have a Kondo\ntemperature of only 2.6 K. In order to cover the different regions of the phase\nspace, the pairs are designed to have interaction strengths similar to the\nKondo temperature. By applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field, we are\nable to access a new phase in which the two coupled impurities are\nsimultaneously screened. Comparison of differential conductance spectra taken\non the atoms to simulated curves, calculated using a third order transport\nmodel, allows us to independently determine the degree of Kondo screening in\neach phase.\n", "  For Gaussian Spin Glasses in low dimensions, we introduce a simple Strong\nDisorder renormalization procedure at zero temperature. In each disordered\nsample, the difference between the ground states associated to Periodic and\nAnti-Periodic boundary conditions defines a system-size Domain Wall. The\nnumerical study in dimensions $d=2$ (up to sizes $2048^2$) and $d=3$ (up to\nsizes $128^3$) yields fractal Domain Walls of dimensions $d_s(d=2) \\simeq 1.27$\nand $d_s(d=3) \\simeq 2.55$ respectively.\n", "  A class of trigonometric integrator is proposed for the constrained ring\npolymer Hamiltonian dynamics, arising from the path integral molecular\ndynamics. The integrator is formulated by the composition of flows, thereby\nintegrating the Cartesian equations of motions under normal mode representation\nand preserving the holonomic constraints by iterations. It is illustrated that\nthe trigonometric method can preserve the symplectic structure and\ntime-reversibility, and its near-conservation of Hamiltonian is analyzed in the\nframework of modulated Fourier expansion analysis. Numerical examples\nillustrating its stability are presented using the SPC/E force field at 298K.\n", "  This is a review paper for the \"Current Developments in Mathematics 2014\"\nconference.\n", "  The Stenzel space fourfold is a non-compact Calabi-Yau which is a higher\ndimensional analogue of the deformed conifold. We consider N = (1,1) type IIA,\nN = 1 M-theory and N = (2,0) type IIB compactifications on this Stenzel space,\nthus examining the gravity side of potentially higher dimensional analogues of\nKlebanov-Strassler-like compactifications. We construct families of\nSU(4)-structures and solve associated moduli spaces, of complex and symplectic\nstructures amongst others. By making use of these, we can construct IIA\ncompactifications on manifolds homeomorphic to the Stenzel space fourfold, but\nwith complex non-CY SU(4)-structures. Such compactifications are sourced by a\ndistribution of NS5-branes. The external metric is asymptotically conformal\nAdS_3 and should thus be suitable for holography applications.\n", "  We suggest a technique based on the transfer of topological charge from\napplied laser radiation to directional and coherent optical fields generated in\nladder-type excited atomic media to identify the major processes responsible\nfor their appearance. As an illustration, in Rb vapours we analyse transverse\nintensity and phase profiles of the forward-directed collimated blue and\nnear-IR light using self-interference and astigmatic transformation techniques\nwhen either or both of two resonant laser beams carry orbital angular momentum.\nOur observations unambiguously demonstrate that emission at 1.37 {\\mu}m is the\nresult of a parametric four-wave mixing process involving only one of the two\napplied laser fields.\n", "  We discuss how small neutrino rest masses can increase the expansion rate\nnear the photon decoupling epoch in the early universe, causing an earlier,\nhigher temperature freeze-out for ionization equilibrium compared to the\nmassless neutrino case. This yields a larger free-electron fraction. A larger\nratio of the sound horizon to the photon diffusion length follows, implying a\nsmaller inferred Neff. This neutrino-mass/recombination effect depends strongly\non the neutrino rest masses. Though below current sensitivity, this effect\ncould be probed by next-generation cosmic microwave background experiments,\ngiving an observational handle of neutrino mass physics.\n", "  We present a dynamical study of the Galactic black hole binary system Nova\nMuscae 1991 (GS/GRS 1124-683). We utilize 72 high resolution Magellan\nEchellette (MagE) spectra and 72 strictly simultaneous V-band photometric\nobservations; the simultaneity is a unique and crucial feature of this\ndynamical study. The data were taken on two consecutive nights and cover the\nfull 10.4-hour orbital cycle. The radial velocities of the secondary star are\ndetermined by cross-correlating the object spectra with the best-match template\nspectrum obtained using the same instrument configuration. Based on our\nindependent analysis of five orders of the echellette spectrum, the\nsemi-amplitude of the radial velocity of the secondary is measured to be K_2 =\n406.8+/-2.7 km/s, which is consistent with previous work, while the uncertainty\nis reduced by a factor of 3. The corresponding mass function is f(M) =\n3.02+/-0.06 M_\\odot. We have also obtained an accurate measurement of the\nrotational broadening of the stellar absorption lines (v sin i = 85.0+/-2.6\nkm/s) and hence the mass ratio of the system q = 0.079+/-0.007. Finally, we\nhave measured the spectrum of the non-stellar component of emission that veils\nthe spectrum of the secondary. In a future paper, we will use our\nveiling-corrected spectrum of the secondary and accurate values of K_2 and q to\nmodel multi-color light curves and determine the systemic inclination and the\nmass of the black hole.\n", "  We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation whose complexity is\noptimal (up to log factors) as a function of all parameters of interest.\nPrevious algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at\nthe cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk\nhas optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the\nallowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation\nprovides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the\nsparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of\nboth. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with\ncoefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured\nby the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse\nerror, and nearly linear in the product $\\tau$ of the evolution time, the\nsparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our\ndependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that\nno algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\\tau$.\n", "  By means of detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we have presented dynamic\nphase transition (DPT) properties of ferromagnetic thin-films. Thermal\nvariations of surface, bulk and total dynamical order parameters (DOP) for a\nfilm and total order parameter for the films with different thicknesses have\nbeen examined. Opposite regimes of the critical value of reduced exchange\ninteraction (surface to bulk ratio) $R_{c}$ at which the critical temperature\nbecomes independent of film thickness $L$ has been also taken into\nconsideration. The average magnetizations of each layer is reversed in these\nregimes. Based on the results, we have confirmed that the system represents a\ncrossover behavior in between ordinary to extraordinary transition in the\npresence of surface exchange enhancement.\n", "  The electronic and transport properties of (10, 0) single-walled carbon\nnanotube are studied by performing the first-principles calculations and\nsemi-classical Boltzmann theory. It is found that the (10, 0) tube exhibits\nconsiderably large Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity which is\nhighly desirable for good thermoelectric materials. Together with the lattice\nthermal conductivity predicted by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations, the room temperature ZT value of (10, 0) tube is estimated to be\n0.15 for p-type carriers. Moreover, the ZT value exhibits strong temperature\ndependence and can be reached to 0.77 at 1000 K. Such ZT value can be further\nenhanced to as high as 1.7 by isotope substitution and chemisorptions of\nhydrogen on the tube.\n", "  Optomechanical devices sensitively transduce and actuate motion of\nnanomechanical structures using light. Single--crystal diamond promises to\nimprove the performance of optomechanical devices, while also providing\nopportunities to interface nanomechanics with diamond color center spins and\nrelated quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate dissipative\nwaveguide--optomechanical coupling exceeding 35 GHz/nm to diamond nanobeams\nsupporting both optical waveguide modes and mechanical resonances, and use this\noptomechanical coupling to measure nanobeam displacement with a sensitivity of\n$9.5$ fm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ and optical bandwidth $>150$nm. The nanobeams are\nfabricated from bulk optical grade single--crystal diamond using a scalable\nundercut etching process, and support mechanical resonances with quality factor\n$2.5 \\times 10^5$ at room temperature, and $7.2 \\times 10^5$ in cryogenic\nconditions (5K). Mechanical self--oscillations, resulting from interplay\nbetween photothermal and optomechanical effects, are observed with amplitude\nexceeding 200 nm for sub-$\\mu$W absorbed optical power, demonstrating the\npotential for optomechanical excitation and manipulation of diamond\nnanomechanical structures.\n", "  External driving is emerging as a promising tool for exploring new phases in\nquantum systems. The intrinsically non-equilibrium states that result, however,\nare challenging to describe and control. We study the steady states of a\nperiodically driven one-dimensional electronic system, including the effects of\nradiative recombination, electron-phonon interactions, and the coupling to an\nexternal fermionic reservoir. Using a kinetic equation for the populations of\nthe Floquet eigenstates, we show that the steady-state distribution can be\ncontrolled using the momentum and energy relaxation pathways provided by the\ncoupling to phonon and Fermi reservoirs. In order to utilize the latter, we\npropose to couple the system and reservoir via an energy filter which\nsuppresses photon-assisted tunneling. Importantly, coupling to these reservoirs\nyields a steady state resembling a band insulator in the Floquet basis. The\nsystem exhibits incompressible behavior, while hosting a small density of\nexcitations. We discuss transport signatures, and describe the regimes where\ninsulating behavior is obtained. Our results give promise for realizing Floquet\ntopological insulators.\n", "  Control by dissipation, or environment engineering, constitutes an important\nmethodology within quantum coherent control which was proposed to improve the\nrobustness and scalability of quantum control systems. The system-environment\ncoupling, often considered to be detrimental to quantum coherence, also\nprovides the means to steer the system to desired states. This paper aims to\ndevelop the theory for engineering of the dissipation, based on a ground-state\nLyapunov stability analysis of open quantum systems via a Heisenberg-picture\napproach. Algebraic conditions concerning the ground-state stability and\nscalability of quantum systems are obtained. In particular, Lyapunov stability\nconditions expressed as operator inequalities allow a purely algebraic\ntreatment of the environment engineering problem, which facilitates the\nintegration of quantum components into a large-scale quantum system and draws\nan explicit connection to the classical theory of vector Lyapunov functions and\ndecomposition-aggregation methods for control of complex systems. The\nimplications of the results in relation to dissipative quantum computing and\nstate engineering are also discussed in this paper.\n", "  In this paper we obtain an analytical solution of the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation under the relaxation time approximation that describes the\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics of a radially expanding massless gas. This solution\nis found by mapping this expanding system in flat spacetime to a static flow in\nthe curved spacetime $\\mathrm{AdS}_{2}\\otimes \\mathrm{S}_{2}$. We further\nderive explicit analytic expressions for the momentum dependence of the single\nparticle distribution function as well as for the spatial dependence of its\nmoments. We find that this dissipative system has the ability to flow as a\nperfect fluid even though its entropy density does not match the equilibrium\nform. The non-equilibrium contribution to the entropy density is shown to be\ndue to higher order scalar moments (which possess no hydrodynamical\ninterpretation) of the Boltzmann equation that can remain out of equilibrium\nbut do not couple to the energy-momentum tensor of the system. Thus, in this\nsystem the slowly moving hydrodynamic degrees of freedom can exhibit true\nperfect fluidity while being totally decoupled from the fast moving,\nnon-hydrodynamical microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to entropy\nproduction.\n", "  The present article reviews recent experimental investigations of spin\ndynamics in iron-based superconductors and their parent compounds by means of\ninelastic neutron scattering. It mainly focuses on the most contemporary\ndevelopments in this field, pertaining to the observations of magnetic resonant\nmodes in new superconductors, spin anisotropy of low-energy magnetic\nfluctuations that has now been observed in a wide range of chemical\ncompositions and doping levels, as well as their momentum-space anisotropy\nincurred by the spin-nematic order. The implications of these new findings for\nour understanding of the superconducting state, along with the remaining\nunsettled challenges for neutron spectroscopy, are discussed.\n", "  We present the Pantheon 1.0 dataset: a manually verified dataset of\nindividuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic\nboundaries. The Pantheon 1.0 dataset includes the 11,341 biographies present in\nmore than 25 languages in Wikipedia and is enriched with: (i) manually verified\ndemographic information (place and date of birth, gender) (ii) a taxonomy of\noccupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation and (iii)\ntwo measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a\nbiography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index\n(HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views\n(2008-2013). We compare the Pantheon 1.0 dataset to data from the 2003 book,\nHuman Accomplishments, and also to external measures of accomplishment in\nindividual games and sports: Tennis, Swimming, Car Racing, and Chess. In all of\nthese cases we find that measures of popularity (L and HPI) correlate highly\nwith individual accomplishment, suggesting that measures of global popularity\nproxy the historical impact of individuals.\n", "  Sensing the internal dynamics of individual nuclear spins or clusters of\nnuclear spins has recently become possible by observing the coherence decay of\na nearby electronic spin: the weak magnetic noise is amplified by a periodic,\nmulti-pulse decoupling sequence. However, it remains challenging to robustly\ninfer underlying atomic-scale structure from decoherence traces in all but the\nsimplest cases. We introduce Floquet spectroscopy as a versatile paradigm for\nanalysis of these experiments, and argue it offers a number of general\nadvantages. In particular, this technique generalises to more complex\nsituations, offering physical insight in regimes of many-body dynamics, strong\ncoupling and pulses of finite duration. As there is no requirement for resonant\ndriving, the proposed spectroscopic approach permits physical interpretation of\nstriking, but overlooked, coherence decay features in terms of the form of the\navoided crossings of the underlying quasienergy eigenspectrum. This is\nexemplified by a set of \"diamond\" shaped features arising for transverse-field\nscans in the case of single-spin sensing by NV-centers in diamond. We\ninvestigate also applications for donors in silicon showing that the resulting\ntunable interaction strengths offer highly promising future sensors.\n", "  The realization of a spontaneous macroscopic ferroelectric order in fluids of\nanisotropic mesogens is a topic of both fundamental and technological interest.\nRecently, we demonstrated that a system of dipolar achiral disklike ellipsoids\ncan exhibit long-searched ferroelectric liquid crystalline phases of dipolar\norigin. In the present work, extensive off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations are\nused to investigate the phase behavior of the system under the influences of\nthe electrostatic boundary conditions that restrict any global polarization. We\nfind that the system develops strongly ferroelectric slablike domains\nperiodically arranged in an antiferroelectric fashion. Exploring the phase\nbehavior at different dipole strengths, we find existence of the ferroelectric\nnematic and ferroelectric columnar order inside the domains. For higher dipole\nstrengths, a biaxial phase is also obtained with a similar periodic array of\nferroelectric slabs of antiparallel polarizations. We have studied the\ndepolarizing effects by using both the Ewald summation and the spherical\ncut-off techniques. We present and compare the results of the two different\napproaches of considering the depolarizing effects in this anisotropic system.\nIt is explicitly shown that the domain size increases with the system size as a\nresult of considering longer range of dipolar interactions. The system exhibits\npronounced system size effects for stronger dipolar interactions. The results\nprovide strong evidence to the novel understanding that the dipolar\ninteractions are indeed sufficient to produce long range ferroelectric order in\nanisotropic fluids.\n", "  When dealing with system-reservoir interactions in an open quantum system,\nsuch as a photosynthetic light-harvesting complex, approximations are usually\nmade to obtain the dynamics of the system. One question immediately arises: how\ngood are these approximations, and in what ways can we evaluate them? Here, we\npropose to use entanglement and a measure of non-Markovianity as benchmarks for\nthe deviation of approximate methods from exact results. We apply two\nfrequently-used perturbative but non-Markovian approximations to a\nphotosynthetic dimer model and compare their results with that of the\nnumerically-exact hierarchy equation of motion (HEOM). This enables us to\nexplore both entanglement and non-Markovianity measures as means to reveal how\nthe approximations either overestimate or underestimate memory effects and\nquantum coherence. In addition, we show that both the approximate and exact\nresults suggest that non-Markonivity can, counter-intuitively, increase with\ntemperature, and with the coupling to the environment.\n", "  We introduce a class of Markovian quantum master equations, able to describe\nthe dissipative dynamics of a quantum system weakly coupled to one or several\nheat baths. The dissipative structure is driven by an entropic operator, the so\ncalled modular Hamiltonian, which makes it nonlinear. The generated Modular\nDynamical Semigroup (MDS) is not, in general, a Quantum Dynamical Semigroup\n(QDS), whose dynamics is of the popular Lindblad type. The MDS has a robust\nthermodynamic structure, which guarantees for the positivity of the time\nevolved state, the correct steady state properties, the positivity of the\nentropy production, a positive Onsager matrix and Onsager symmetry relations\n(arising from Green-Kubo formulas). We show that the celebrated Davies\ngenerator, obtained through the Born and the secular approximations, generates\na MDS. By unravelling the modular structure of the former, we provide a\ndifferent and genuinely nonlinear MDS, not of QDS type, which is free from the\nsevere spectral restrictions of the Davies generator, while still being\nsupported by a weak coupling limit argument. With respect to the latter, the\npresent work is a substantial extension of\n\\cite{Ottinger2011_GEO,Ottinger2010_TLS_DHO}\n", "  In this paper, we study long-term correlations and multifractal properties\nelaborated from time series of three-phase current signals coming from an\nindustrial electric arc furnace plant. Implicit sinusoidal trends are suitably\ndetected by considering the scaling of the fluctuation functions. Time series\nare then filtered via a Fourier-based analysis, removing hence such strong\nperiodicities. In the filtered time series we detected long-term, positive\ncorrelations. The presence of positive correlations is in agreement with the\ntypical V--I characteristic (hysteresis) of the electric arc furnace, providing\nthus a sound physical justification for the memory effects found in the current\ntime series. The multifractal signature is strong enough in the filtered time\nseries to be effectively classified as multifractal.\n", "  Quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced two-atom state is employed to\ncapture the quantum criticality of the superradiant phase transition in the\nDicke model in the infinite size and finite-$N$ systems respectively. The\nanalytical expression of the QFI of its ground state is evaluated explicitly.\nAnd finite-size scaling analysis is performed with the large accessible system\nsize due to the effective bosonic coherent-state technique. We also investigate\nthe large-size scaling behavior of the scaled QFI of the reduced $N$-atom state\nand show the accurate exponent.\n", "  We perform an exploratory lattice QCD simulation of $D \\bar D$ scattering,\naimed at determining the masses as well as the decay widths of charmonium\nresonances above open charm threshold. Neglecting coupling to other channels,\nthe resulting phase shift for $D \\bar D$ scattering in p-wave yields the\nwell-known vector resonance $\\psi(3770)$. For $m_\\pi = 156$ MeV, the extracted\nresonance mass and the decay width agree with experiment within large\nstatistical uncertainty. The scalar charmonium resonances present a puzzle,\nsince only the ground state $\\chi_{c0}(1P)$ is well understood, while there is\nno commonly accepted candidate for its first excitation. We simulate $D \\bar D$\nscattering in s-wave in order to shed light on this puzzle. The resulting phase\nshift supports the existence of a yet-unobserved narrow resonance with a mass\nslightly below 4 GeV. A scenario with this narrow resonance and a pole at\n$\\chi_{c0}(1P)$ agrees with the energy-dependence of our phase shift. Further\nlattice QCD simulations and experimental efforts are needed to resolve the\npuzzle of the excited scalar charmonia.\n", "  A search has been performed for pair production of heavy vector-like\ndown-type ($B$) quarks. The analysis explores the lepton-plus-jets final state,\ncharacterized by events with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon),\nsignificant missing transverse momentum and multiple jets. One or more jets are\nrequired to be tagged as arising from $b$-quarks, and at least one pair of jets\nmust be tagged as arising from the hadronic decay of an electroweak boson. The\nanalysis uses the full data sample of $pp$ collisions recorded in 2012 by the\nATLAS detector at the LHC, operating at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. No significant\nexcess of events is observed above the expected background. Limits are set on\nvector-like $B$ production, as a function of the $B$ branching ratios, assuming\nthe allowable decay modes are $B \\rightarrow Wt/Zb/Hb$. In the chiral limit\nwith a branching ratio of 100% for the decay $B \\rightarrow Wt$, the observed\n(expected) 95% CL lower limit on the vector-like $B$ mass is 810 GeV (760 GeV).\nIn the case where the vector-like $B$ quark has branching ratio values\ncorresponding to those of an $SU(2)$ singlet state, the observed (expected) 95%\nCL lower limit on the vector-like $B$ mass is 640 GeV (505 GeV). The same\nanalysis, when used to investigate pair production of a colored, charge 5/3\nexotic fermion $T_{5/3}$, with subsequent decay $T_{5/3} \\rightarrow Wt$, sets\nan observed (expected) 95% CL lower limit on the $T_{5/3}$ mass of 840 GeV (780\nGeV).\n", "  The emission times of laser-triggered electrons from a sharp tungsten tip are\ndirectly characterized under ultrafast, near-infrared laser excitation at\nKeldysh parameters $6.6< \\gamma < 19.1$. Emission delays up to 10 fs are\nobserved, which are inferred from the energy gain of photoelectrons emitted\ninto a synchronously driven microwave cavity. ~ fs timing resolution is\nachieved in a configuration capable of measuring timing shifts up to 55 ps. The\ntechnique can also be used to measure the microwave phase inside the cavity\nwith a precision below 70 fs upon the energy resolved detection of a single\nelectron.\n", "  In the frames of the DLVO theory the root mean square amplitude of capillary\nwaves in a thin liquid film is calculated and its dependence on some important\nphysical parameters is unveiled. Two important models are considered: films\nwith classical interfaces and films between lipid bilayers. The performed\nnumerical analysis demonstrates essential difference in their behavior due to\nthe different elastic properties of the film surfaces. It is shown that the\nfilm lifetime is significantly long at some magic film radii.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effect of broken inversion symmetry on the\ngeneration and control of ultrafast currents in a transparent dielectric (SiO2)\nby strong femto-second optical laser pulses. Ab-initio simulations based on\ntime-dependent density functional theory predict ultrafast DC currents that can\nbe viewed as a non-linear photogalvanic effect. Most surprisingly, the\ndirection of the current undergoes a sudden reversal above a critical threshold\nvalue of laser intensity I_c ~ 3.8*10^13 W/cm2. We trace this switching to the\ntransition from non-linear polarization currents to the tunneling excitation\nregime. We demonstrate control of the ultrafast currents by the time delay\nbetween two laser pulses. We find the ultrafast current control by the\nnon-linear photogalvanic effect to be remarkably robust and insensitive to\nlaser-pulse shape and carrier-envelope phase.\n", "  In this work we study a scalar field dark matter model with mass of the order\nof 100 MeV. We assume dark matter is produced in the process $e^-+e^+\\to \\phi\n+\\phi^*+\\gamma$, that, in fact, could be a background for the standard process\n$e^-+e^+\\to \\nu +\\bar\\nu+\\gamma$ extensively studied at LEP. We constrain the\nchiral couplings, $C_L$ and $C_R$, of the dark matter with electrons through an\nintermediate fermion of mass $m_F=100$ GeV and obtain $C_L=0.1(0.25)$ and\n$C_R=0.25(0.1)$ for the best fit point of our $\\chi^2$ analysis. We also\nanalyze the potential of ILC to detect this scalar dark matter for two\nconfigurations: (i) center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and luminosity\n$\\mathcal{L}=250$ fb$^{-1}$, and (ii) center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV\nand luminosity $\\mathcal{L}=500$ fb$^{-1}$. The differences of polarized beams\nare also explored to better study the chiral couplings.\n", "  Finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformations were constructed by\nintegrating infinitesimal BRST transformation in a closed form. Such a\ngeneralized transformations have been extended in various branch of physics and\nfound many applications. Recently BRST transformation has also been generalized\nwith same goal and motivation in slightly different manner. In this work we\nhave shown that the later formulation is conceptually equivalent to the earlier\nformulation. We justify our claim by producing the same result of later\nformulation using earlier FFBRST formulation.\n", "  We analyze the generation of persistent currents in Bose-Einstein condensates\nof ultracold gases confined in a ring. This phenomenon has been recently\ninvestigated in an experiment [Nature \\textbf{506}, 200 (2014)], where\nhysteresis loops have been observed in the activation of quantized persistent\ncurrents by rotating weak links. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of\n3D stationary currents with non-quantized angular momentum. They are generated\nby families of solitary waves that show a continuous variation in the angular\nmomentum, and provide a bridge between different winding numbers. We show that\nthe size of hysteresis loops is determined by the range of existence within the\nweak link region of solitary waves which configure the energy barrier\npreventing phase slips. The barrier vanishes when the critical rotation leads\nwinding numbers and solitonic states to a matching configuration. At this\npoint, Landau and Feynman criteria for phase slips meet: the fluid flow reaches\nthe local speed of sound, and stationary vortex lines (which are the building\nblocks of solitons) can be excited inside the system.\n", "  In this paper, we use the Cosmokinematics approach to study the accelerated\nexpansion of the Universe. This is a model independent approach and depends\nonly on the assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic and is\ndescribed by the FRW metric. We parametrize the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$,\nto constrain the transition redshift ($z_t$) at which the expansion of the\nUniverse goes from a decelerating to an accelerating phase. We use three\ndifferent parametrizations of $q(z)$ namely,\n$q_\\I(z)=q_{\\textnormal{\\tiny\\textsc{1}}}+q_{\\textnormal{\\tiny\\textsc{2}}}z$,\n$q_\\II (z) = q_\\3 + q_\\4 \\ln (1 + z)$ and\n$q_\\III(z)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{q_{\\textnormal{\\tiny\\textsc{5}}}}{(1+z)^2}$. A\njoint analysis of the age of galaxies, strong lensing and supernovae Ia data\nindicates that the transition redshift is less than unity i.e. $z_t<1$. We also\nuse a nonparametric approach (LOESS+SIMEX) to constrain $z_t$. This too gives\n$z_t<1$ which is consistent with the value obtained by the parametric approach.\n", "  We construct a new supermatrix model which represents a manifestly\nsupersymmetric noncommutative regularisation of the $UOSp(2\\vert 1)$\nsupersymmetric Schwinger model on the supersphere. Our construction is much\nsimpler than those already existing in the literature and it was found by using\nPoisson geometry in a substantial way.\n", "  The notion that the scalar listed as $f_0 (500)$ in the particle data booklet\nis a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry,\nexplicitly broken by a small departure from an infrared fixed point, is\nexplored in nuclear dynamics. That notion which puts the scalar -- that we\nshall identify as a \"dilaton\" -- on the same footing as the pseudo-scalar\npseudo-NG bosons, i.e., octet $\\pi$, while providing a simple explanation for\nthe $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule for kaon decay, generalizes the standard chiral\nperturbation theory (S$\\chi$PT) to \"scale chiral perturbation theory,\" denoted\n$\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$, with {\\it one infrared mass scale for both symmetries}, with\nthe $\\sigma$ figuring as a chiral singlet NG mode in non-strange sector.\nApplied to nuclear dynamics, it is seen to provide possible answers to various\nhitherto unclarified nuclear phenomena such as the success of\none-boson-exchange potentials (OBEP), the large cancellation of strongly\nattractive scalar potential by strongly repulsive vector potential in\nrelativistic mean field theory of nuclear systems and in-medium QCD sum rules,\nthe interplay of the dilaton and the vector meson $\\omega$ in dense skyrmion\nmatter, the BPS skyrmion structure of nuclei accounting for small binding\nenergies of medium-heavy nuclei, and the suppression of hyperon degrees of\nfreedom in compact-star matter.\n", "  We explore the correlations between primordial non-Gaussianity and\nisocurvature perturbation. We sketch the generic relation between the\nbispectrum of the curvature perturbation and the cross-correlation power\nspectrum in the presence of explicit couplings between the inflaton and another\nlight field which gives rise to isocurvature perturbation. Using a concrete\nmodel of a Peccei-Quinn type field with generic gravitational couplings, we\nillustrate explicitly how the primordial bispectrum correlates with the\ncross-correlation power spectrum. Assuming the resulting fnl ~ O(1), we find\nthat the form of the correlation depends mostly upon the inflation model but\nonly weakly on the axion parameters, even though fnl itself does depend heavily\non the axion parameters.\n", "  We use the coupled cluster method implemented to high orders of approximation\nto investigate the frustrated spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{3}$\nantiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice with isotropic Heisenberg interactions\nof strength $J_{1} > 0$ between nearest-neighbor pairs, $J_{2}>0$ between\nnext-nearest-neighbor pairs, and $J_{3}>0$ between next-next-neareast-neighbor\npairs of spins. In particular, we study both the ground-state (GS) and\nlowest-lying triplet excited-state properties in the case $J_{3}=J_{2} \\equiv\n\\kappa J_{1}$, in the window $0 \\leq \\kappa \\leq 1$ of the frustration\nparameter, which includes the (tricritical) point of maximum classical\nfrustration at $\\kappa_{{\\rm cl}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. We present GS results for the\nspin stiffness, $\\rho_{s}$, and the zero-field uniform magnetic susceptibility,\n$\\chi$, which complement our earlier results for the GS energy per spin, $E/N$,\nand staggered magnetization, $M$, to yield a complete set of accurate\nlow-energy parameters for the model. Our results all point towards a phase\ndiagram containing two quasiclassical antiferromagnetic phases, one with N\\'eel\norder for $\\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{1}}$, and the other with collinear striped order\nfor $\\kappa > \\kappa_{c_{2}}$. The results for both $\\chi$ and the spin gap\n$\\Delta$ provide compelling evidence for a quantum paramagnetic phase that is\ngapped over a considerable portion of the intermediate region $\\kappa_{c_{1}} <\n\\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{2}}$, especially close to the two quantum critical points\nat $\\kappa_{c_{1}}$ and $\\kappa_{c_{2}}$. Each of our fully independent sets of\nresults for the low-energy parameters is consistent with the values\n$\\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.45 \\pm 0.02$ and $\\kappa_{c_{2}} = 0.60 \\pm 0.02$, and with\nthe transition at $\\kappa_{c_{1}}$ being of continuous (and probably of the\ndeconfined) type and that at $\\kappa_{c_{2}}$ being of first-order type.\n", "  We study multilayer triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnets with interlayer\ninteractions that are weak and frustrated in an abc stacking. By analysing a\ncoupled height model description of these systems, we show that they exhibit a\nclassical spin liquid regime at low temperature, in which both intralayer and\ninterlayer correlations are strong but there is no long range order. Diffuse\nscattering in this regime is concentrated on a helix in reciprocal space, as\nobserved for charge-ordering in the materials LuFe$_2$O$_4$ and YbFe$_2$O$_4$.\n", "  Invisible cloaks provide a way to hide an object under the detection of\nwaves. A perfect cloak guides the incident waves through the cloaking shell\nwithout any distortion. In most cases, some important quantum degrees of\nfreedom, e.g. electron spin or photon polarization, are not taken into account\nwhen designing a cloak. Here, we propose to use the temporal steering\ninequality of these degrees of freedom to detect the existence of an invisible\ncloak.\n", "  The article considers the successful implementation of relativistic\nequation-of-motion coupled cluster method for the electron attachment problem\n(EA-EOMCC) at the level of single- and double- excitation approximation. The\nimplemented relativistic EA-EOMCC method is employed to calculate ionization\npotential values of alkali metal atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and the vertical\nelectron affinity values of LiX (X = H, F, Cl, Br), NaY (Y = H, F, Cl) starting\nfrom their closed-shell configuration. Both four-component and exact\ntwo-component calculations are done for all the opted systems. Further, we have\nshown the effect of spin-orbit interaction considering the atomic systems. The\nresults of our atomic calculations are compared with the values from the NIST\ndatabase and the results are found to be very accurate (< 1 %).\n", "  In this article we complete our formalism relating the finite-volume energy\nspectrum of a scalar quantum field theory to the three-to-three scattering\namplitude, ${\\cal M}_3$. In previous work we found a quantization condition\nrelating the spectrum to a non-standard infinite-volume quantity, denoted\n${\\cal K}_{{\\rm df},3}$. Here we present the relation between ${\\cal K}_{{\\rm\ndf},3}$ and ${\\cal M}_3$. We then discuss briefly how our now completed\nformalism can be practically implemented to extract ${\\cal M}_3$ from the\nfinite-volume energy spectrum.\n", "  A new measure to characterize stability of complex dynamical systems against\nlarge perturbation is suggested, the stability threshold (ST). It quantifies\nthe magnitude of the weakest perturbation capable to disrupt the system and\nswitch it to an undesired dynamical regime. In the phase space, the stability\nthreshold corresponds to the \"thinnest site\" of the attraction basin and\ntherefore indicates the most \"dangerous\" direction of perturbations. We\nintroduce a computational algorithm for quantification of the stability\nthreshold and demonstrate that the suggested approach is effective and provides\nimportant insights. The generality of the obtained results defines their vast\npotential for application in such fields as engineering, neuroscience, power\ngrids, Earth science and many others where robustness of complex systems is\nstudied.\n", "  The multipartite setting offers much more complexity of nonlocality than the\nbipartite one. We analyze the structure of tripartite nonlocal correlations by\nproposing inequalities satisfied by each type: bilocal, broadcasting and\nquantum, but violated by the other two. One of the inequalities satisfied by\nbroadcasting correlations is generalized for multipartite systems. The study of\nits quantum mechanical violation reveals that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like\nstates exhibit new, powerful correlations.\n", "  A question is studied whether an observer can discover quantum gravity being\nin the semi-classical regime. It is shown that it is indeed possible to probe a\ncertain quantum gravity effect by employing an appropriately designed detector.\nThe effect is related to the possibility of having topologically inequivalent\ngeometries at once in the path integral approach.\n  A CFT state which is expected to describe the eternal AdS black hole in the\nlarge N limit is discussed. It is argued under certain assumptions that the\nblack hole boundary should be merely a patch of the entire AdS boundary. This\nleads then to a conclusion that that CFT state is the ordinary CFT vacuum\nrestricted to that patch. If existent, the bulk CFT operators can behave as the\nordinary semi- classical quantum field theory in the large N limit in the weak\nsense.\n", "  Properties of weak spatio-spectral twin beams in paraxial approximation are\nanalyzed using the decomposition into appropriate paired modes. Numbers of\npaired modes as well as numbers of modes in the signal (or idler) field in the\ntransverse wave-vector and spectral domains are analyzed as functions of\npump-beam parameters. Spatial and spectral coherence of weak twin beams is\ndescribed by auto- and cross-correlation functions. Relation between the\nnumbers of modes and coherence is discussed.\n", "  We present a fabrication scheme called 'fork stamping' optimized for the dry\ntransfer of individual pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto ferromagnetic\ncontact electrodes fabricated by standard lithography. We demonstrate the\ndetailed recipes for a residue-free device fabrication and in-situ current\nannealing on suspended CNT spin-valve devices with ferromagnetic Permalloy (Py)\ncontacts and report preliminary transport characterization and\nmagnetoresistance experiments at cryogenic temperatures. This scheme can\ndirectly be used to implement more complex device structures, including\nmultiple gates or superconducting contacts.\n", "  The inelastic portion of the tunnel current through an individual magnetic\natom grants unique access to read out and change the atom's spin state, but it\nalso provides a path for spontaneous relaxation and decoherence. Controlled\nclosure of the inelastic channel would allow for the latter to be switched off\nat will, paving the way to coherent spin manipulation in single atoms. Here we\ndemonstrate complete closure of the inelastic channels for both spin and\norbital transitions due to a controlled geometric modification of the atom's\nenvironment, using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The observed\nsuppression of the excitation signal, which occurs for Co atoms assembled into\nchain on a Cu$_2$N substrate, indicates a structural transition affecting the\nd$_z$$^2$ orbital, effectively cutting off the STM tip from the spin-flip\ncotunnelling path.\n", "  The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a new powerful\ntool for observing the Sun at high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.\nThese capabilities can address a broad range of fundamental scientific\nquestions in solar physics. The radiation observed by ALMA originates mostly\nfrom the chromosphere - a complex and dynamic region between the photosphere\nand corona, which plays a crucial role in the transport of energy and matter\nand, ultimately, the heating of the outer layers of the solar atmosphere. Based\non first solar test observations, strategies for regular solar campaigns are\ncurrently being developed. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the solar\natmosphere and modeling of instrumental effects can help constrain and optimize\nfuture observing modes for ALMA. Here we present a short technical description\nof ALMA and an overview of past efforts and future possibilities for solar\nobservations at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In addition, selected\nnumerical simulations and observations at other wavelengths demonstrate ALMA's\nscientific potential for studying the Sun for a large range of science cases.\n", "  Magnetic fluctuations in transition metal oxides are a subject of intensive\nresearch because of the key role they are expected to play in the transition\nfrom the Mott insulator to the unconventional metallic phase of these\nmaterials, and also as drivers of superconductivity. Despite much effort, a\nclear link between magnetic fluctuations and the insulator-to-metal transition\nhas not yet been established. Here we report the discovery of a compelling link\nbetween magnetic fluctuations and the insulator-to-metal transition in\nCa(Ir$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$)O$_{3}$ perovskites as a function of the doping\ncoefficient x. We show that when the material turns from insulator to metal, at\na critical value of x$\\sim$ 0.3, magnetic fluctuations change their character\nfrom antiferromagnetic, a Mott insulator phase, to ferromagnetic, an itinerant\nelectron state with Hund's orbital coupling. These results are expected to have\nwide-ranging implications for our understanding of the unconventional\nproperties of strongly correlated electrons systems\n", "  Segregation, precipitation, and phase separation in Fe-Cr systems is\ninvestigated. Monte Carlo simulations using semiempirical interatomic\npotential, first-principles total energy calculations, and experimental\nspectroscopy are used. In order to obtain a general picture of the relation of\nthe atomic interactions and properties of Fe-Cr alloys in bulk, surface, and\ninterface regions several complementary methods has to be used. Using Exact\nMuffin-Tin Orbitals method the effective chemical potential as a function of Cr\ncontent (0-15 at.% Cr) is calculated for a surface, second atomic layer and\nbulk. At ~10 at.% Cr in the alloy the reversal of the driving force of a Cr\natom to occupy either bulk or surface sites is obtained. The Cr containing\nsurfaces are expected when the Cr content exceeds ~10 at.%. The second atomic\nlayer forms about 0.3 eV barrier for the migration of Cr atoms between bulk and\nsurface atomic layer. To get information on Fe-Cr in larger scales we use\nsemiempirical methods. Using combined Monte Carlo molecular dynamics\nsimulations, based on semiempirical potential, the precipitation of Cr into\nisolated pockets in bulk Fe-Cr and the upper limit of the solubility of Cr into\nFe layers in Fe/Cr layer system is studied. The theoretical predictions are\ntested using spectroscopic measurements. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nand Auger electron spectroscopy investigations were carried out to explore Cr\nsegregation and precipitation in Fe/Cr double layer and Fe_0.95Cr_0.05 and\nFe_0.85Cr_0.15 alloys. Initial oxidation of Fe-Cr was investigated\nexperimentally at 10^-8 Torr pressure of the spectrometers showing intense\nCr_2O_3 signal. Cr segregation and the formation of Cr rich precipitates were\ntraced by analysing the experimental spectral intensities with respect to\nannealing time, Cr content, and kinetic energy of the exited electron.\n", "  We examine the ejection of an initially strongly confined flexible polymer\nfrom a spherical capsid through a nanoscale pore. We use molecular dynamics for\nunprecedentedly high initial monomer densities. We show that the time for an\nindividual monomer to eject grows exponentially with the number of ejected\nmonomers. By measurements of the force at the pore we show this dependence to\nbe a consequence of the excess free energy of the polymer due to confinement\ngrowing exponentially with the number of monomers initially inside the capsid.\nThis growth relates closely to the divergence of mixing energy in the\nFlory-Huggins theory at large concentration. We show that the pressure inside\nthe capsid driving the ejection dominates the process that is characterized by\nthe ejection time growing linearly with the lengths of different polymers.\nWaiting time profiles would indicate that the superlinear dependence obtained\nfor polymers amenable to computer simulations results from a finite-size effect\ndue to the final retraction of polymers' tails from capsids.\n", "  We demonstrate using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the\nelectron quantization within metallic Au atomic wires self-assembled on a\nSi(111) surface and segmented by adatom impurities. The local electronic states\nof wire segments with a length up to 10 nm are investigated as terminated by\ntwo neighboring Si adatoms. One dimensional (1D) quantum well states are well\nresolved by their spatial distributions and the inverse-length-square\ndependence in their energies. The quantization also results in the quantum\noscillation of the conductance at the Fermi level. These results deny the\ndopant role of the adatoms assumed for a long time but indicate their strong\nscattering nature. The present approach provides a new and convenient platform\nto investigate 1D quantum phenomena with atomic precision.\n", "  We show theoretically by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation with a classical spin model on a two-dimensional system that both\nmagnetic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices can be moved with microwave magnetic\nfields. The mechanism is enabled by breaking the axial symmetry of the\nskyrmion, for example through application of a static in-plane external field.\nThe net velocity of the skyrmion depends on the frequency and amplitude of the\nmicrowave fields as well as the strength of the in-plane field. The maximum\nvelocity is found where the frequency of the microwave coincides with the\nresonance frequency of the breathing mode of the skyrmions.\n", "  We study the binding of a holon to a doublon in a half-filled Hubbard model\nas the mechanism of the zero-temperature metal-insulator transition. In a spin\npolarized system and a non-bipartite lattice a single holon-doublon (HD) pair\nexhibits a binding transition (e.g., on a face-centred cubic lattice), or a\nsharp crossover (e.g., on a triangular lattice) corresponding well to the\nstandard Mott transition in unpolarized systems. We extend the HD-pair study\ntowards non-polarized systems by considering more general spin background and\nby treating the finite HD density within a BCS-type approximation. Both\napproaches lead to a discontinuous transition away from the fully polarized\nsystem and give density correlations consistent with numerical results on a\ntriangular lattice.\n", "  Quantum linear response theory considers only the response of a closed\nquantum system to a perturbation up to first order in the perturbation. This\ntheory breaks down when the system subjects to environments and the response up\nto second order in perturbation is not negligible. In this paper, we develop a\nquantum nonlinear response theory for open systems. We first formulate this\ntheory in terms of general susceptibility, then apply it to deriving the Hall\nconductance for the open system at finite temperature. Taking the two-band\nmodel as an example, we derive the Hall conductance for the two-band model. We\ncalculate the Hall conductance for a two-dimensional ferromagnetic electron gas\nand a two-dimensional lattice model via different expressions for\n$d_{\\alpha}(\\vec p), \\ \\alpha=x,y,z$. The results show that the transition\npoints of topological phase almost remain unchanged in the presence of\nenvironments.\n", "  We investigate the role of dissipation in excited state quantum phase\ntransitions (ESQPT) within the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Signatures of the\nESQPT are directly visible in the complex spectrum of an effective Hamiltonian,\nwhereas they get smeared out in the time-dependence of system observables. In\nthe latter case, we show how delayed feedback control can be used to restore\nthe visibility of the ESQPT signals.\n", "  In a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory, it has been known that a\nrelevant deformation operator with the conformal dimension,\n$\\Delta=\\frac{d+2}{2}$, generates a logarithmic correction to the entanglement\nentropy. In the large 't Hooft coupling limit, we can investigate such a\nlogarithmic correction holographically by deforming an AdS space with a massive\nscalar field dual to the operator with $\\Delta=\\frac{d+2}{2}$. There are two\nsources generating the logarithmic correction. One is the metric deformation\nand the other is the minimal surface deformation. In this work, we investigate\nthe change of the entanglement entropy caused by the minimal surface\ndeformation and find that the second order minimal surface deformation leads to\nan additional logarithmic correction.\n", "  Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics,\nand is the key resource for quantum information processing. Bipartite entangled\nstates of identical particles have been generated and studied in several\nexperiments, and post-selected or heralded entangled states involving pairs of\nphotons, single photons and single atoms, or different nuclei in the solid\nstate, have also been produced. Here, we use a deterministic quantum logic gate\nto generate a \"hybrid\" entangled state of two trapped-ion qubits held in\ndifferent isotopes of calcium, perform full tomography of the state produced,\nand make a test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a\nlaser-driven two-qubit gate, whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits'\nenergy splittings, to produce a maximally-entangled state of one Ca-40 qubit\nand one Ca-43 qubit, held 3.5 microns apart in the same ion trap, with 99.8(6)%\nfidelity. We test the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) version of Bell's\ninequality for this novel entangled state and find that it is violated by 15\nstandard deviations; in this test, we close the detection loophole but not the\nlocality loophole. Mixed-species quantum logic is a powerful technique for the\nconstruction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows\nprotection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations, or are\nused as photonic interfaces to other processing units. The entangling gate\nmechanism used here can also be applied to qubits stored in different atomic\nelements; this would allow both memory and logic gate errors due to photon\nscattering to be reduced below the levels required for fault-tolerant quantum\nerror correction, which is an essential pre-requisite for general-purpose\nquantum computing.\n", "  Here we introduce moments of visibility function and discuss how those can be\nused to estimate the power spectrum of the turbulent velocity of external\nspiral galaxies. We perform numerical simulation to confirm the credibility of\nthis method and found that for galaxies with lower inclination angles it works\nfine. This is the only method to estimate the power spectrum of the turbulent\nvelocity fluctuation in the ISM of the external galaxies.\n", "  The quark mass dependence of hadrons is an important input for lattice\ncalculations. We investigate the light quark mass dependence of the binding\nenergy of the X(3872) in a finite box to next-to-leading order in an effective\nfield theory for the X(3872) with perturbative pions (XEFT). At this order, the\nquark mass dependence is determined by a quark mass-dependent contact\ninteraction in addition to the one-pion exchange. While there is only a\nmoderate sensitivity to the light quark masses in the region up to twice their\nphysical value, the finite volume effects are significant already at box length\nas large as 20 fm.\n", "  We study a fully nonlinear PDE involving a linear combination of symmetric\npolynomials of the K\\\"ahler form on a K\\\"ahler manifold. A $C^0$ \\emph{a\npriori} estimate is proven in general and a gradient estimate is proven in\ncertain cases. Independently, we also provide a method-of-continuity proof via\na path of K\\\"ahler metrics to recover the existence of solutions in some of the\nknown cases. Known results are then applied to an analytic problem arising from\nChern-Weil theory and to a special Lagrangian-type equation arising from mirror\nsymmetry.\n", "  A model of reality is called separable if the state of a composite system is\nequal to the union of the states of its parts, located in different regions of\nspace. Spekkens has argued that it is trivial to reproduce the predictions of\nquantum mechanics using a separable ontological model, provided one allows for\narbitrary violations of `dynamical locality'. However, since dynamical locality\nis strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of\nwhether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and\ndynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an\nontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the\noriginal formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that\nmeasurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can\nalternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's\ntheorem does apply. We find that the resulting model violates local causality,\nbut satisfies both separability and dynamical locality, making it a candidate\nfor the `most local' ontological model of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We calculate canonical charges in four dimensional conformal gravity using\nthe generalised boundary conditions presented in \\cite{Grumiller:2013mxa}. We\nshow that the charges are finite and conserved. The asymptotic symmetry\nalgebras generated by these charges are classified according to the conditions\nimposed on the first subleading term in the generalised Fefferman-Graham\nexpansion.\n", "  We study the muon $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ anomaly in light of neutralino dark matter\nand the LHC. We scan the MSSM parameters relevant to $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ and focus on\nthree distinct cases with different neutralino compositions. We find that the\n2$\\sigma$ range of $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ requires the smuon ($\\tilde{\\mu}_1$) to be\nlighter than $\\sim$ 500 (1000) GeV for $\\tan \\beta=10\\,(50)$. Correspondingly\nthe two lightest neutralinos, $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^0, \\tilde{\\chi}_{2}^0$, have to\nbe lighter than $\\sim$ 300 (650) GeV and 900 (1000) GeV respectively. We\nexplore the prospects of searching the light smuon and neutralinos at the LHC,\nin conjunction with constraints arising from indirect dark matter (DM)\ndetection experiments. The upcoming run of the LHC will be able to set $95\\%$\nCL exclusion limit on $M_{\\tilde{\\chi}_{2}^0}$ ($\\sim 475 - 1300$ GeV) and\n$m_{\\tilde{l}}$ ($\\sim 670-775$ GeV) with $M_{\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^0} \\sim 100-250$\nGeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity in multi-lepton + missing energy channel.\n", "  Linear fluctuating hydrodynamics is a useful and versatile tool for\ndescribing fluids, as well as other systems with conserved fields, on a\nmesoscopic scale. In one spatial dimension, however, transport is anomalous,\nwhich requires to develop a nonlinear extension of fluctuating hydrodynamics.\nThe relevant nonlinearity turns out to be the quadratic part of the Euler\ncurrents when expanding relative to a uniform background. We outline the theory\nand compare with recent molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  We propose a method to read-out the spin-state of an electron in a quantum\ndot in a Voigt geometry magnetic field using cycling transitions induced by the\nAC Stark effect. We show that cycling transitions can be made possible by a\nred-detuned, circularly-polarized laser, which modifies the spin eigenstates\nand polarization selection rules via the AC Stark effect. A Floquet-Liouville\nsupermatrix approach is used to calculate the time-evolution of the density\nmatrix under the experimental conditions of a spin read-out operation. With an\noverall detection efficiency of 2.5%, the read-out is a single-shot measurement\nwith a fidelity of 76.2%.\n", "  In a recent paper, we proposed closed-form expressions for the superconformal\nindices of the (A_1, A_{2n-3}) and (A_1, D_{2n}) Argyres-Douglas (AD)\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) in the Schur limit. Following up on our\nresults, we turn our attention to the small S^1 regime of these indices. As\nexpected on general grounds, our study reproduces the S^3 partition functions\nof the resulting dimensionally reduced theories. However, we show that in all\ncases---with the exception of the reduction of the (A_1, D_4) SCFT---certain\nimaginary partners of real mass terms are turned on in the corresponding mirror\ntheories. We interpret these deformations as R symmetry mixing with the\ntopological symmetries of the direct S^1 reductions. Moreover, we argue that\nthese shifts occur in any of our theories whose four-dimensional N=2\nsuperconformal U(1)_R symmetry does not obey an SU(2) quantization condition.\nWe then use our R symmetry map to find the four-dimensional ancestors of\ncertain three-dimensional operators. Somewhat surprisingly, this picture turns\nout to imply that the scaling dimensions of many of the chiral operators of the\nfour-dimensional theory are encoded in accidental symmetries of the\nthree-dimensional theory. We also comment on the implications of our work on\nthe space of general N=2 SCFTs.\n", "  We critically discuss the application of the Wertheim's theory to classes of\ncomplex associating fluids that can be today engineered in the laboratory as\npatchy colloids and to the prediction of their peculiar gas-liquid phase\ndiagrams. Our systematic study, stemming from perturbative version of the\ntheory, allows us to show that, even at the simplest level of approximation for\nthe inter-cluster correlations, the theory is still able to provide a\nconsistent and stable picture of the behavior of interesting models of\nself-assembling colloidal suspension. We extend the analysis of a few cases of\npatchy systems recently introduced in the literature. In particular, we discuss\nfor the first time in detail the consistency of the structural description\nunderlying the perturbative approach and we are able to prove a consistency\nrelationship between the valence as obtained from thermodynamics and from the\nstructure for the one-site case. A simple analytical expression for the\nstructure factor is proposed.\n", "  We present high-precision timing observations spanning up to nine years for\n37 millisecond pulsars monitored with the Green Bank and Arecibo radio\ntelescopes as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for\nGravitational Waves (NANOGrav) project. We describe the observational and\ninstrumental setups used to collect the data, and methodology applied for\ncalculating pulse times of arrival; these include novel methods for measuring\ninstrumental offsets and characterizing low signal-to-noise ratio timing\nresults. The time of arrival data are fit to a physical timing model for each\nsource, including terms that characterize time-variable dispersion measure and\nfrequency-dependent pulse shape evolution. In conjunction with the timing model\nfit, we have performed a Bayesian analysis of a parameterized timing noise\nmodel for each source, and detect evidence for excess low-frequency, or \"red,\"\ntiming noise in 10 of the pulsars. For 5 of these cases this is likely due to\ninterstellar medium propagation effects rather than intrisic spin variations.\nSubsequent papers in this series will present further analysis of this data set\naimed at detecting or limiting the presence of nanohertz-frequency\ngravitational wave signals.\n", "  In the past decade graphene has been one of the most studied material for\nseveral unique and excellent properties. Due to its two dimensional nature,\nphysical and chemical properties and ease of manipulation, graphene offers the\npossibility of integration with the exiting semiconductor technology for\nnext-generation electronic and sensing devices. In this context, the\nunderstanding of the graphene/semiconductor interface is of great importance\nsince it can constitute a versatile standalone device as well as the\nbuilding-block of more advanced electronic systems. Since graphene was brought\nto the attention of the scientific community in 2004, the device research has\nbeen focused on the more complex graphene transistors, while the\ngraphene/semiconductor junction, despite its importance, has started to be the\nsubject of systematic investigation only recently. As a result, a thorough\nunderstanding of the physics and the potentialities of this device is still\nmissing. The studies of the past few years have demonstrated that graphene can\nform junctions with 3D or 2D semiconducting materials which have rectifying\ncharacteristics and behave as excellent Schottky diodes. The main novelty of\nthese devices is the tunable Schottky barrier height, a feature which makes the\ngraphene/semiconductor junction a great platform for the study of interface\ntransport mechanisms as well as for applications in photo-detection, high-speed\ncommunications, solar cells, chemical and biological sensing, etc. In this\npaper, we review the state-of-the art of the research on graphene/semiconductor\njunctions, the attempts towards a modeling and the most promising applications.\n", "  We present an integral field study of the internal structure, kinematics and\nstellar population of the almost edge-on, intermediate luminosity ($L_ {*}$)\nelliptical galaxy NGC 4697. We build extended 2-dimensional (2D) maps of the\nstellar kinematics and line-strengths of the galaxy up to $\\sim 0.7 $ effective\nradii (R$_{eff}$) using a mosaic of 8 VIMOS (VIsible Multi-Objects Spectrograph\non the VLT) integral-field unit pointings. We find clear evidence for a\nrotation-supported structure along the major axis from the 2D kinematical maps,\nconfirming the previous classification of this system as a `fast-rotator'. We\nstudy the correlations between the third and fourth Gauss-Hermite moments of\nthe line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) $h_3$ and $h_4$ with the\nrotation parameter ($V/\\sigma$), and compare our findings to hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We find remarkable similarities to predictions from gas-rich\nmergers. Based on photometry, we perform a bulge/disk decomposition and study\nthe stellar population properties of the two components. The bulge and the disk\nshow different stellar populations, with the stars in the bulge being older\n(age$_{\\rm bulge}=13.5^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, age$_{\\rm\ndisk}=10.5^{+1.6}_{-2.0}$Gyr) and more metal-poor ($\\mathrm{[M/H]_{bulge}} =\n-0.17^{+0.12}_{-0.1}$, $\\mathrm{[M/H]_{disk}}=-0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.1}$). The\nevidence of a later-formed, more metal-rich disk embedded in an older, more\nmetal-poor bulge, together with the LOSVD structure, supports a mass assembly\nscenario dominated by gas-rich minor mergers and possibly with a late gas-rich\nmajor merger that left a previously rapidly rotating system unchanged. The\nbulge and the disk do not show signs of different stellar Initial Mass Function\nslopes, and both match well with a Milky Way-like IMF.\n", "  Systems with purely off-diagonal disorder have peculiar features such as the\nlocalization-delocalization transition and long-range correlations in their\nwavefunctions. To motivate possible experimental studies of the physics of\noff-diagonal disorder, we study in detail disordered discrete-time quantum walk\nin a finite chain, where the diagonal disorder can be set to zero by\nconstruction. Starting from a transfer matrix approach, we show, both\ntheoretically and computationally, that the dynamics of the quantum walk with\ndisorder manifests all the main features of off-diagonal disorder. We also\npropose how to prepare a remarkable delocalized zero-mode from a localized and\neasy-to-prepare initial state using an adiabatic protocol that increases the\ndisorder strength slowly. Numerical experiments are also performed with\nencouraging results.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality is arguably among the most counter-intuitive phenomena\npredicted by quantum theory. In recent years, the development of an abstract\ntheory of nonlocality has brought a much deeper understanding of the subject.\nIn parallel, experimental progress allowed for the demonstration of quantum\nnonlocality in a wide range of physical systems, and brings us close to a final\nloophole-free Bell test. Here we combine these theoretical and experimental\ndevelopments in order to explore the limits of quantum nonlocality. This\napproach represents a thorough test of quantum theory, and could provide\nevidence of new physics beyond the quantum model. Using a versatile and\nhigh-fidelity source of pairs of polarization entangled photons, we explore the\nboundary of quantum correlations, present the most nonlocal correlations ever\nreported, demonstrate the phenomenon of more nonlocality with less\nentanglement, and show that non-planar (and hence complex) qubit measurements\ncan be necessary to reproduce the strong qubit correlations that we observed.\nOur results are in remarkable agreement with quantum predictions.\n", "  We study thorium-doped CaF$_2$ crystals as a possible platform for optical\nspectroscopy of the Th-229 nuclear isomer transition. We anticipate two major\nsources of background signal that might cover the nuclear spectroscopy signal:\nVUV-photoluminescence, caused by the probe light, and radioluminescence, caused\nby the radioactive decay of Th-229 and its daughters. We find a rich\nphotoluminescence spectrum at wavelengths above 260 nm, and radioluminescence\nemission above 220 nm. This is very promising, as fluorescence originating from\nthe isomer transition, predicted at a wavelength shorter than 200 nm, could be\nfiltered spectrally from the crystal luminescence. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe temperature-dependent decay time of the luminescence, as well as\nthermoluminescence properties. Our findings allow for an immediate optimization\nof spectroscopy protocols for both the initial search for the nuclear\ntransition using synchrotron radiation, as well as future optical clock\noperation with narrow-linewidth lasers.\n", "  We report a systematic nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of the\n$^{23}$Na spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, in sodium loaded low-silica X\n(LSX) zeolite, Na$_n$/Na$_{12}$-LSX, for various loading levels of sodium atoms\n$n$ across the metal-to-insulator crossover. For high loading levels of $n \\geq\n14.2$, $1/T_1T$ shows nearly temperature-independent behavior between 10 K and\n25 K consistent with the Korringa relaxation mechanism and metallic ground\nstate. As the loading levels decrease below $n \\leq 11.6$, the extracted\ndensity of states (DOS) at the Fermi level sharply decreases, although a\nresidual DOS at Fermi level is still observed even in samples that lack the\nmetallic Drude-peak in the optical reflectance. The observed crossover is a\nresult of a complex loading-level dependence of electric potential felt by the\nelectrons confined to zeolite cages, where the electronic correlations and\ndisorder both play an important role.\n", "  We argue that the L-aspartic acid nickel chloride crystal reported by the\nauthors of the title paper (Optics Communications 2013) is actually the\nwell-known diaqua(L-aspartato)nickel(II) hydrate crystal.\n", "  We present a highly efficient source for discrete frequency-entangled photon\npairs based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion using 3rd order type-0\nquasi-phase matching in a periodically poled MgO-doped stoichiometric LiTaO3\ncrystal pumped by a 355.66 nm laser. Correlated two-photon states were\ngenerated with automatic conservation of energy and momentum in two given\nspatial modes. These states have a wide spectral range, even under small\nvariations in crystal temperature, which consequently results in higher\ndiscreteness. Frequency entanglement was confirmed by measuring two-photon\nquantum interference fringes without any spectral filtering.\n", "  Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the payloads on the first\nIndian multi wavelength satellite ASTROSAT expected to be launched by Indian\nSpace Research Organisation (ISRO) in the year 2015. We have performed\nsimulations of UV studies of old open clusters for the UVIT. The colour\nmagnitude diagrams (CMDs) and spatial appearances have been created using 10\nfilters of FUV channel (130 - 180 nm) and NUV channel (200 - 300nm) available\nfor observations on the UVIT, for three old open clusters M67, NGC 188 and NGC\n6791. The CMDs are simulated for different filter combinations, and they are\nused to identify the loci of various evolutionary sequences, white dwarfs, blue\nstragglers, red giants, sub giants, turn off stars and the main sequence of the\nclusters. The present work helps in identifying the potential area of study in\nthe case of three old open clusters, by considering the availability of filters\nand the detection limits of the instrument. We also recommend filter\ncombinations, which can be used to detect and study the above mentioned\nevolutionary stages. The simulations and the results presented here are\nessential for the optimal use of the UVIT for studies of old open clusters.\n", "  In a recent work Povolotsky provided a three-parameter family of stochastic\nparticle systems with zero-range interactions in one dimension which are\nintegrable by coordinate Bethe ansatz. Using these results we obtain the\ncorresponding condition for integrability of a class of directed polymer models\nwith random weights on the square lattice. Analyzing the solutions we find,\nbesides known cases, a new two-parameter family of integrable DP model, which\nwe call the Inverse-Beta polymer, and provide its Bethe ansatz solution.\n", "  The short- and long-time dynamics of model systems undergoing a glass\ntransition with apparent inversion of Kauzmann and dynamical arrest glass\ntransition lines is investigated. These models belong to the class of the\nspherical mean-field approximation of a spin-$1$ model with $p$-body quenched\ndisordered interaction, with $p>2$, termed spherical Blume-Emery-Griffiths\nmodels. Depending on temperature and chemical potential the system is found in\na paramagnetic or in a glassy phase and the transition between these phases can\nbe of a different nature. In specific regions of the phase diagram coexistence\nof low density and high density paramagnets can occur, as well as the\ncoexistence of spin-glass and paramagnetic phases. The exact static solution\nfor the glassy phase is known to be obtained by the one-step replica symmetry\nbreaking ansatz. Different scenarios arise for both the dynamic and the\nthermodynamic transitions. These include: (i) the usual random first- order\ntransition (Kauzmann-like) for mean-field glasses preceded by a dynamic\ntransition, (ii) a thermodynamic first-order transition with phase coexistence\nand latent heat and (iii) a regime of apparent inversion of static transition\nline and dynamic transition lines, the latter defined as a non-zero complexity\nline. The latter inversion, though, turns out to be preceded by a novel\ndynamical arrest line at higher temperature. Crossover between different\nregimes is analyzed by solving mode coupling theory equations throughout the\nspace of external thermodynamic parameters and the relationship with the\nunderlying statics is discussed.\n", "  We examine what happens when a strongly many body localized system is coupled\nto a weak heat bath, with both system and bath containing similar numbers of\ndegrees of freedom. Previous investigations of localized systems coupled to\nbaths operated in regimes where the back action of the system on the bath is\nnegligible, and concluded that the bath generically thermalizes the system. In\nthis work we show that when the system is strongly localized and the bath is\nonly weakly ergodic, the system can instead localize the bath. We demonstrate\nthis both in the limit of weak coupling between system and bath, and in the\nlimit of strong coupling, and for two different types of `weak' bath - baths\nwhich are close to an atomic limit, and baths which are close to a\nnon-interacting limit. The existence of this `many body localization proximity\neffect' indicates that many body localization is more robust than previously\nappreciated, and can not only survive coupling to a (weak) heat bath, but can\neven destroy the bath.\n", "  We study optical properties of arrays of ultrathin nanowires by means of the\nBrillouin scattering of light on magnons. We employ the Stokes/anti-Stokes\nscattering asymmetry to probe the circular polarization of a local electric\nfield induced inside nanowires by linearly polarized light waves. We observe\nthe anomalous polarization conversion of the opposite sign than that in a bulk\nmedium or thick nanowires with a great enhancement of the degree of circular\npolarization attributed to an unconventional refraction in the nanowire medium.\n", "  Off-stoichiometric alloys based on Ni 2 MnIn have drawn attention due to the\ncoupled first order magnetic and structural transformations, and the large\nmagnetocaloric entropy associated with the transformations. Here we describe\ncalorimetric and magnetic studies of four compositions. The results provide a\ndirect measure of entropy changes contributions including at the first-order\nphase transitions, and thereby a determination of the maximum field-induced\nentropy change corresponding to the giant magnetocaloric effect. We find a\nlarge excess entropy change, attributed to magneto-elastic coupling, but only\nin compositions with no ferromagnetic order in the high-temperature austenite\nphase. Furthermore, a molecular field model corresponding to antiferromagnetism\nof the low-temperature phases is in good agreement, and nearly independent of\ncomposition, despite significant differences in overall magnetic response of\nthese materials.\n", "  Recent research on finding important intermediate nodes in a network\nsuspected to contain criminal activity is highly dependent on network\ncentrality values. Betweenness centrality, for example, is widely used to rank\nthe nodes that act as brokers in the shortest paths connecting all source and\nall the end nodes in a network. However both the shortest path node betweenness\nand the linearly scaled betweenness can only show rankings for all the nodes in\na network. In this paper we explore the mathematical concept of pair-dependency\non intermediate nodes, adapting the concept to criminal relationships and\nintroducing a new source-intermediate reliance measure. To illustrate our\nmeasure, we apply it to rank the nodes in the Enron email dataset and the\nNoordin Top Terrorist networks. We compare the reliance ranking with Google\nPageRank, Markov centrality as well as betweenness centrality and show that a\ncriminal investigation using the reliance measure, will lead to a different\nprioritisation in terms of possible people to investigate. While the ranking\nfor the Noordin Top terrorist network nodes yields more extreme differences\nthan for the Enron email transaction network, in the latter the reliance values\nfor the set of finance managers immediately identified another employee\nconvicted of money laundering.\n", "  The authors of the title paper (Optik, 125 (2014) 1825-1828) claim to have\nsynthesized a new nonlinear optical (NLO) gamma bis glycinium oxalate (GBGOx)\ncrystal by slow evaporation solution technique. In this communication, many\npoints of criticism, concerning the characterization of this so called GBGOx\nNLO crystal are highlighted to prove that the title paper is completely\nerroneous.\n", "  The slow evaporation of an aqueous solution containing L-valine and salicylic\nacid results in the fractional crystallization of salicylic acid and not any so\ncalled L-valinium salicylate as reported recently by Andal and Murugakoothan in\nthe title paper.\n", "  High-speed tracking of single particles is a gateway to understanding\nphysical, chemical, and biological processes at the nanoscale. It is also a\nmajor experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale\nparticles. Although methods such as confocal or fluorescence microscopy offer\nboth high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the\nfluorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while\nphotobleaching and thermal diffusion limit the duration of measurements. Here\nwe present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables\nlong-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of\nframes per second. We contain the particles within a single-mode silica fiber\ncontaining a sub-wavelength, nano-fluidic channel and illuminate them using the\nfiber's strongly confined optical mode. The diffusing particles in this\ncylinderical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal\nplane. We show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as\nsmall as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV)\nvirions - 4.6 megadaltons in size - at rates of over 2 kHz for durations of\ntens of seconds. Our setup is easily incorporated into common optical\nmicroscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and\nmacromolecules. The ease-of-use and performance of this technique support its\npotential for widespread applications in medical diagnostics and micro total\nanalysis systems.\n", "  Experimental evidence for Majorana bound states largely relies on\nmeasurements of the tunneling conductance. While the conductance into a\nMajorana state is in principle quantized to $2e^2/h$, observation of this\nquantization has been elusive, presumably due to temperature broadening in the\nnormal-metal lead. Here, we propose to use a superconducting lead instead,\nwhose gap strongly suppresses thermal excitations. For a wide range of\ntunneling strengths and temperatures, a Majorana state is then signaled by\nsymmetric conductance peaks at $eV=\\pm\\Delta$ with quantized height\n$G=(4-\\pi)2e^2/h$. For a superconducting scanning tunneling microscope tip,\nMajorana states appear as spatial conductance plateaus while the conductance\nvaries with the local wavefunction for trivial Andreev bound states. We discuss\neffects of nonresonant (bulk) Andreev reflections and quasiparticle poisoning.\n", "  We consider a supersymmetric Wilson loop operator for 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills\ntheory which is the natural object dual to the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring in the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. It generalizes the traditional bosonic 1/2 BPS\nMaldacena-Wilson loop operator and completes recent constructions in the\nliterature to smooth (non-light-like) loops in the full N=4 non-chiral\nsuperspace. This Wilson loop operator enjoys global superconformal and local\nkappa-symmetry of which a detailed discussion is given. Moreover, the\nfiniteness of its vacuum expectation value is proven at leading order in\nperturbation theory. We determine the leading vacuum expectation value for\ngeneral paths both at the component field level up to quartic order in\nanti-commuting coordinates and in the full non-chiral superspace in suitable\ngauges. Finally, we discuss loops built from quadric splines joined in such a\nway that the path derivatives are continuous at the intersection.\n", "  Spatio-spectral properties of twin beams at their transition from low to high\nintensities are analyzed in parametric and paraxial approximations using the\ndecomposition into paired spatial and spectral modes. Intensity auto- and\ncross-correlation functions are determined and compared in the spectral and\ntemporal domains as well as the transverse wave-vector and crystal output\nplanes. Whereas the spectral, temporal and transverse wave-vector coherence\nincreases with the increasing pump intensity, coherence in the crystal output\nplane is practically independent on the pump intensity owing to the mode\nstructure in this plane. The corresponding auto- and cross-correlation\nfunctions approach each other for larger pump intensities. Entanglement\ndimensionality of a twin beam is determined comparing several approaches.\n", "  We study the localization properties of weakly interacting Bose gas in a\nquasiperiodic potential commonly known as Aubry-Andr\\'e model. Effect of\ninteraction on localization is investigated by computing the `superfluid\nfraction' and `inverse participation ratio'. For interacting Bosons the inverse\nparticipation ratio increases very slowly after the localization transition due\nto `multisite localization' of the wave function. We also study the\nlocalization in Aubry-Andr\\'e model using an alternative approach of classical\ndynamical map, where the localization is manifested by chaotic classical\ndynamics. For weakly interacting Bose gas, Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum\nand condensate fraction are calculated in order to study the loss of coherence\nwith increasing disorder strength. Finally we discuss the effect of trapping\npotential on localization of matter wave.\n", "  We present the high resolution spectroscopic study of five -3.9<=[Fe/H]<=-2.5\nstars in the Local Group dwarf spheroidal, Sculptor, thereby doubling the\nnumber of stars with comparable observations in this metallicity range. We\ncarry out a detailed analysis of the chemical abundances of alpha, iron peak,\nlight and heavy elements, and draw comparisons with the Milky Way halo and the\nultra faint dwarf stellar populations. We show that the bulk of the Sculptor\nmetal-poor stars follows the same trends in abundance ratios versus metallicity\nas the Milky Way stars. This suggests similar early conditions of star\nformation and a high degree of homogeneity of the interstellar medium. We find\nan outlier to this main regime, which seems to miss the products of the most\nmassive of the TypeII supernovae. In addition to its value to help refining\ngalaxy formation models, this star provides clues to the production of cobalt\nand zinc. Two of our sample stars have low odd-to-even barium isotope abundance\nratios, suggestive of a fair proportion of s-process; we discuss the\nimplication for the nucleosynthetic origin of the neutron capture elements.\n", "  The use of weak measurements for performing quantum tomography is enjoying\nincreased attention due to several recent proposals. The advertised merits of\nusing weak measurements in this context are varied, but are generally\nrepresented by novelty, increased efficacy, and foundational significance. We\ncritically evaluate two proposals that make such claims and find that weak\nmeasurements are not an essential ingredient for most of their advertised\nfeatures.\n", "  A single Dirac cone on the surface is the hallmark of three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulators, where the double degeneracy at the Dirac point is\nprotected by time-reversal symmetry and the spin-splitting away from the point\nis provided by the spin-orbital coupling. Here we predict a single Dirac-cone\nsurface state in a 3D photonic crystal, where the degeneracy at the Dirac point\nis protected by a nonsymmorphic glide reflection and the linear splitting away\nfrom it is enabled by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Such a gapless surface\nstate is fully robust against random disorder of any type. This bosonic\ntopological band structure is achieved by applying alternating magnetization to\ngap out the 3D \"generalized Dirac points\" discovered in the bulk of our\ncrystal. The $Z_2$ bulk invariant is characterized through the evolution of\nWannier centers. Our proposal--readily realizable using ferrimagnetic materials\nat microwave frequencies--can also be regarded as the photonic analog of\ntopological crystalline insulators, providing the first 3D bosonic\nsymmetry-protected topological system.\n", "  We present an experimental realization of an autonomous Maxwell's Demon,\nwhich extracts microscopic information from a System and reduces its entropy by\napplying feedback. It is based on two capacitively coupled single electron\ndevices, both integrated on the same electronic circuit. This setup allows a\ndetailed analysis of the thermodynamics of both the Demon and the System as\nwell as their mutual information exchange. The operation of the Demon is\ndirectly observed as a temperature drop in the System. We also observe a\nsimultaneous temperature rise in the Demon arising from the thermodynamic cost\nof generating the mutual information.\n", "  We design realizable time-dependent semiclassical pulses to invert the\npopulation of a two-level system faster than adiabatically when the\nrotating-wave approximation cannot be applied. Different approaches, based on\nthe counterdiabatic method or on invariants, may lead to singularities in the\npulse functions. Ways to avoid or cancel the singularities are put forward when\nthe pulse spans few oscillations. For many oscillations an alternative\nnumerical minimization method is proposed and demonstrated.\n", "  We investigate nonlocal field theories, a subject that has attracted some\nrenewed interest in connection with nonlocal gravity models. We study, in\nparticular, scalar theories of interacting delocalized fields, the\ndelocalization being specified by nonlocal integral kernels. We distinguish\nbetween strictly nonlocal and quasi-local (compact support) kernels and impose\nconditions on them to insure UV finiteness and unitarity of amplitudes. We\nstudy the classical initial value problem for the partial integro-differential\nequations of motion in detail. We give rigorous proofs of the existence but\naccompanying loss of uniqueness of solutions due to the presence of future, as\nwell as past, \"delays,\" a manifestation of acausality. In the quantum theory we\nderive a generalization of the Bogoliubov causality condition equation for\namplitudes, which explicitly exhibits the corrections due to nonlocality. One\nfinds that, remarkably, for quasi-local kernels all acausal effects are\nconfined within the compact support regions. We briefly discuss the extension\nto other types of fields and prospects of such theories.\n", "  Statistical fluctuation problems are faced by all quantum key distribution\n(QKD) protocols under finite-key condition. Most of the current statistical\nfluctuation analysis methods work based on independent random samples, however,\nthe precondition cannot be always satisfied on account of different choice of\nsamples and actual parameters. As a result, proper statistical fluctuation\nmethods are required to figure out this problem. Taking the after-pulse\ncontributions into consideration, we give the expression of secure key rate and\nthe mathematical model for statistical fluctuations, focusing on a decoy-state\nQKD protocol (Sci Rep. 3, 2453, 2013) with biased basis choice. On this basis,\na classified analysis of statistical fluctuation is represented according to\nthe mutual relationship between random samples. First for independent identical\nrelations, we make a deviation comparison between law of large numbers and\nstandard error analysis. Secondly, we give a sufficient condition that Chernoff\nbound achieves a better result than Hoeffding's inequality based on independent\nrelations only. Thirdly, by constructing the proper martingale, for the first\ntime we represent a stringent way to deal with statistical fluctuation issues\nupon dependent ones through making use of Azuma's inequality. In numerical\noptimization, we show the impact on secure key rate, the ones and respective\ndeviations under various kinds of statistical fluctuation analyses.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the pyrochlore coumpound Nd2Zr2O7 by\nmeans of neutron scattering and magnetization measurements down to 90 mK. The\nNd$^{3+}$ magnetic moments exhibit a strong local $\\langle$111$\\rangle$ Ising\nanisotropy together with a dipolar-octupolar nature, different from the\nstandard Kramers-doublet studied so far. We show that, despite the positive\nCurie-Weiss temperature, \\ndzr\\ undergoes a transition around 285 mK towards an\nall-in$-$all-out antiferromagnetic state. We establish the $(H,T)$ phase\ndiagram in the three directions of the applied field and reveal a metamagnetic\ntransition around 0.1 T. The strongly reduced ordered magnetic moment as well\nas the unexpected shape of the magnetization curves demonstrate that Nd2Zr2O7 ,\nis not a standard Ising antiferromagnet. We propose that the peculiar nature of\nthe Nd doublet combined with competing interactions explain these findings.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a two-mode laser system by extending the\ntwo-mode Tavis-Cummings model with dissipative channels and incoherent pumping\nand by applying the mean-field approximation in the thermodynamic limit. To\nthis end we analytically calculate up to four possible non-equilibrium steady\nstates (fixed points) and determine the corresponding complex phase diagram.\nVarious possible phases are distinguished by the actual number of fixed points\nand their stability. In addition, we apply three time-delayed Pyragas feedback\ncontrol schemes. Depending on the time delay and the strength of the control\nterm this can lead to the stabilization of unstable fixed points or to the\nselection of a particular cavity mode that is macroscopically occupied.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations can play an important role in the buckling of elastic\nobjects at small scales, such as polymers or nanotubes. In this paper, we study\nthe finite-temperature buckling transition of an extensible rod by analyzing\nfluctuation corrections to the elasticity of the rod. We find that, in both two\nand three dimensions, thermal fluctuations delay the buckling transition, and\nnear the transition, there is a critical regime in which fluctuations are\nprominent and make a contribution to the effective force that is of order\n$\\sqrt{T}$. We verify our theoretical prediction of the phase diagram with\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n", "  An adiabatic change of parameters along a closed path may interchange the\n(quasi-)eigenenergies and eigenspaces of a closed quantum system. Such\ndiscrepancies induced by adiabatic cycles are refereed to as the exotic quantum\nholonomy, which is an extension of the geometric phase. \"Small\" adiabatic\ncycles induce no change on eigenspaces, whereas some \"large\" adiabatic cycles\ninterchange eigenspaces. We explain the topological formulation for the\neigenspace anholonomy, where the homotopy equivalence precisely distinguishes\nthe larger cycles from smaller ones. An application to two level systems is\nexplained. We also examine the cycles that involve the adiabatic evolution\nacross an exact crossing, and the diabatic evolution across an avoided\ncrossing. The latter is a nonadiabatic example of the exotic quantum holonomy.\n", "  Data from the experiment on the 197Au + 197Au reaction at 23 AMeV are\nanalyzed with an aim to find signatures of exotic nuclear configurations such\nas toroid-shaped objects. The experimental data are compared with predictions\nof the ETNA code dedicated to look for such configurations and with the QMD\nmodel. A novel criterion of selecting events possibly resulting from the\nformation of exotic freeze-out configurations, \"the efficiency factor\", is\ntested. Comparison between experimental data and model predictions may indicate\nfor the formation of flat/toroidal nuclear systems.\n", "  Using potential models we analyze range corrections to the universal law\ndictated by the Efimov theory of three bosons. In the case of finite-range\ninteractions we have observed that, at first order, it is necessary to\nsupplement the theory with one finite-range parameter, $\\Gamma_n^3$, for each\nspecific $n$-level [Kievsky and Gattobigio, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 87}, 052719\n(2013)]. The value of $\\Gamma_n^3$ depends on the way the potentials is changed\nto tune the scattering length toward the unitary limit. In this work we analyze\na particular path in which the length $r_B=a-a_B$, measuring the difference\nbetween the two-body scattering length $a$ and the energy scattering length\n$a_B$, results almost constant. Analyzing systems with very different scales,\nas atomic or nuclear systems, we observe that the finite-range parameter\nremains almost constant along the path with a numerical value of\n$\\Gamma_0^3\\approx 0.87$ for the ground state level. This observation suggests\nthe possibility of constructing a single universal function that incorporate\nfinite-range effects for this class of paths. The result is used to estimate\nthe three-body parameter $\\kappa_*$ in the case of real atomic systems brought\nto the unitary limit thought a broad Feshbach resonances. Furthermore, we show\nthat the finite-range parameter can be put in relation with the two-body\ncontact $C_2$ at the unitary limit.\n", "  Nuclei colliding at very high energy create a strong, quasi-classical gluon\nfield during the initial phase of their interaction. We present an analytic\ncalculation of the initial space-time evolution of this field in the limit of\nvery high energies using a formal recursive solution of the Yang-Mills\nequations. We provide analytic expressions for the initial chromo-electric and\nchromo-magnetic fields and for their energy-momentum tensor. In particular, we\ndiscuss event-averaged results for energy density and energy flow as well as\nfor longitudinal and transverse pressure of this system. For example, we find\nthat the ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressure very early in the system\nbehaves as $p_L/p_T =\n-[1-\\frac{3}{2a}(Q\\tau)^2]/[1-\\frac{1}{a}(Q\\tau)^2]+\\mathcal{O}(Q\\tau)^4$ where\n$\\tau$ is the longitudinal proper time, $Q$ is related to the saturation scales\n$Q_s$ of the two nuclei, and $a = \\ln (Q^2/\\hat{m}^2)$ with $\\hat m$ a scale to\nbe defined later. Our results are generally applicable if $\\tau \\lesssim 1/Q$.\nAs already discussed in a previous paper, the transverse energy flow $S^i$ of\nthe gluon field exhibits hydrodynamic-like contributions that follow transverse\ngradients of the energy density $\\nabla^i \\varepsilon$. In addition, a\nrapidity-odd energy flow also emerges from the non-abelian analog of Gauss' Law\nand generates non-vanishing angular momentum of the field. We will discuss the\nspace-time picture that emerges from our analysis and its implications for\nobservables in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We demonstrate an algorithm for the retrieval of a qubit, encoded in spin\nangular momentum, that has been dropped into a no-firewall black hole.\nRetrieval is achieved analogously to quantum teleportation by collecting\nHawking radiation and performing measurements on the black hole. Importantly,\nthese methods only require the ability to perform measurements from outside the\nevent horizon.\n", "  One of the main features of statistical systems out of equilibrium is the\ncurrents they exhibit in their stationary state: microscopic currents of\nprobability between configurations, which translate into macroscopic currents\nof mass, charge, etc. Understanding the general behaviour of these currents is\nan important step towards building a universal framework for non-equilibrium\nsteady states akin to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for equilibrium systems.\nIn this review, we consider one-dimensional bulk-driven particle gases, and in\nparticular the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries,\nwhich is one of the most popular models of one-dimensional transport. We focus,\nin particular, on the current of particles flowing through the system in its\nsteady state, and on its fluctuations. We show how one can obtain the complete\nstatistics of that current, through its large deviation function, by combining\nresults from various methods: exact calculation of the cumulants of the\ncurrent, using the integrability of the model ; direct diagonalisation of a\nbiased process in the limits of very high or low current ; hydrodynamic\ndescription of the model in the continuous limit using the macroscopic\nfluctuation theory (MFT). We give a pedagogical account of these techniques,\nstarting with a quick introduction to the necessary mathematical tools, as well\nas a short overview of the existing works relating to the ASEP. We conclude by\ndrawing the complete dynamical phase diagram of the current. We also remark on\na few possible generalisations of these results.\n", "  Motivated by experiments on sheared suspensions that show a transition\nbetween ordered and disordered phases, we here study the long-time behavior of\na sheared and overdamped 2-d system of particles interacting by repulsive\nforces. As a function of interaction strength and shear rate we find\ntransitions between phases with vanishing and large single-particle diffusion.\nIn the phases with vanishing single-particle diffusion, the system evolves\ntowards regular lattices, usually on very slow time scales. Different lattices\ncan be approached, depending on interaction strength and forcing amplitude. The\ndisordered state appears in parameter regions where the regular lattices are\nunstable. Correlation functions between the particles reveal the formation of\nshear bands. In contrast to single particle densities, the spatially resolved\ntwo-particle correlation functions vary with time and allow to determine the\nphase within a period. As in the case of the suspensions, motion in the state\nwith low diffusivity is essentially reversible, whereas in the state with\nstrong diffusion it is not.\n", "  The frustrated classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions on the triangular lattice is studied\nunder a magnetic field by means of semiclassical calculations and large-scale\nMonte Carlo simulations. We show that even a small DM interaction induces the\nformation of an Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion crystal (AF-SkX) state. Unlike what\nis observed in ferromagnetic materials, we show that the AF-SkX state consists\nof three interpenetrating Skyrmion crystals (one by sublattice), and most\nimportantly, the AF-SkX state seems to survive in the limit of zero\ntemperature. To characterize the phase diagram we compute the average of the\ntopological order parameter which can be associated to the number of\ntopological charges or Skyrmions. As the magnetic field increases this\nparameter presents a clear jump, indicating a discontinuous transition from a\nspiral phase into the AF-SkX phase, where multiple Bragg peaks coexist in the\nspin structure factor. For higher fields, a second (probably continuous)\ntransition occurs into a featureless paramagnetic phase.\n", "  The latest Planck results show a power deficit in the temperature\nanisotropies near $\\ell \\approx 20$ in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nThis observation can hardly be explained within the standard inflationary\n$\\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) scenario. In this paper we consider a\nstring theory inspired inflationary model (axion monodromy inflation) with a\nstep-like modulation in the potential which gives rise to observable signatures\nin the primordial perturbations. One interesting phenomenon is that the\nprimordial scalar modes experience a sudden suppression at a critical scale\nwhen the modulation occurs. By fitting to the CMB data, we find that the model\ncan nicely explain the $\\ell \\approx 20$ power deficit anomaly as well as\npredict specific patterns in the temperature-polarization correlation and\npolarization autocorrelation spectra. Though the significance of the result is\nnot sufficient to claim a detection, our analysis reveals that fundamental\nphysics at extremely high energy scales, namely, some effects inspired by\nstring theory, may be observationally testable in forthcoming cosmological\nexperiments.\n", "  We examine quantum normal typicality and ergodicity properties for quantum\nsystems whose dynamics are generated by Hamiltonians which have residual\ndegeneracy in their spectrum and resonance in their energy gaps. Such systems\ncan be considered atypical in the sense that degeneracy, which is usually a\nsign of symmetry, is naturally broken in typical systems due to stochastic\nperturbations. In particular, we prove a version of von Neumann's quantum\nergodic theorem, where a modified condition needs to hold in order to have\nnormal typicality and ergodicity. As a result, we show that degeneracy of\nspectrum does not considerably modify the condition of the theorem, whereas the\nexistence of resonance is more dominant for obstructing ergodicity.\n", "  We impose an $S_3$ symmetry on the quark fields under which two of three\nquarks transform like a doublet and the remaining one as singlet, and use a\nscalar sector with the same structure of $SU(2)$ doublets. After gauge symmetry\nbreaking, a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of the $S_3$ remains unbroken. We show that\nthis unbroken subgroup can explain the approximate block structure of the CKM\nmatrix. By allowing soft breaking of the $S_3$ symmetry in the scalar sector,\nwe show that one can generate the small elements, of quadratic or higher order\nin the Wolfenstein parametrization of the CKM matrix. We also predict the\nexistence of exotic new scalars, with unconventional decay properties, which\ncan be used to test our model experimentally.\n", "  We examine the prospects for detecting light charged higgsinos that are\nexpected to be a necessary feature of natural SUSY models via $pp\\to\n{\\widetilde W}^\\pm{\\widetilde W}_1^\\pm jj+X$ processes arising dominantly from\n$W^\\pm W^\\pm$ fusion at LHC13. The signal will be a pair of same-sign leptons\n($e$ or $\\mu$) in events with two relatively forward, hemispherically-separated\njets with a large rapidity gap. We find that even though the higgsinos have a\nfull-strength $SU(2)$ gauge couplings to $W$-bosons, the LHC13 cross section\nfor the production of same sign higgsino pairs is smaller than 0.02 fb over\nmost of the interesting range of natural SUSY parameters, even before leptonic\nbranching fractions of the chargino are included. This cross section is\nstrongly suppressed because the two neutral Majorana higgsinos can be combined\ninto a single Dirac neutralino if the bino and the winos are much heavier than\nthe higgsinos, as is the case in natural SUSY models: in this limit, higgsino\ncouplings to $W$-bosons exhibit an emergent (approximate) $U(1)_{\\rm ino}$\nglobal symmetry that suppresses same sign higgsino production by vector boson\nfusion. We conclude that this channel is not a viable way to search for natural\nSUSY even at the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We examine the nature of topological currents in black phosphorus when its\ninversion symmetry is deliberately broken. Here, the conduction and valence\nband edges are located at the $\\Gamma$ point of the rectangular Brillouin zone,\nand they exhibit strong anisotropy along its two crystal axes. We will show\nbelow that these salient features lead to a linear transverse neutral\ntopological currents, accompanied also by a non-linear transverse charge\ncurrent at the Fermi surface. These topological currents are maximal when the\nin-plane electric field is applied along the zigzag crystal axes, but zero\nalong the armchair direction.\n", "  While controlling particle diffusion in a confined geometry is a popular\napproach taken by both natural and artificial systems, it has not been widely\nadopted for controlling light transport in random media, where wave\ninterference effects play a critical role. The transmission eigenchannels\ndetermine not only light propagation through the disordered system but also the\nenergy concentrated inside. Here we propose and demonstrate an effective\napproach to modify these channels, whose structures are considered to be\nuniversal in conventional diffusive waveguides. By adjusting the waveguide\ngeometry, we are able to alter the spatial profiles of the transmission\neigenchannels significantly and deterministically from the universal ones. In\naddition, propagating channels may be converted to evanescent channels or vice\nversa by tapering the waveguide cross-section. Our approach allows to control\nnot only the transmitted and reflected light, but also the depth profile of\nenergy density inside the scattering system. In particular geometries perfect\nreflection channels are created, and their large penetration depth into the\nturbid medium as well as the complete return of probe light to the input end\nwould greatly benefit sensing and imaging applications. Absorption along with\ngeometry can be further employed for tuning the decay length of energy flux\ninside the random system, which cannot be achieved in a common waveguide with\nuniform cross-section. Our approach relies solely on confined geometry and does\nnot require any modification of intrinsic disorder, thus it is applicable to a\nvariety of systems and also to other types of waves.\n", "  The double field theory action in the flux formulation is dimensionally\nreduced on a Calabi-Yau three-fold equipped with non-vanishing type IIB\ngeometric and non-geometric fluxes. First, we rewrite the metric-dependent\nreduced DFT action in terms of quantities that can be evaluated without\nexplicitly knowing the metric on the Calabi-Yau manifold. Second, using\nproperties of special geometry we obtain the scalar potential of N=2 gauged\nsupergravity. After an orientifold projection, this potential is consistent\nwith the scalar potential arising from the flux-induced superpotential, plus an\nadditional D-term contribution.\n", "  In this note we revisit Hitchin's prescription \\cite{Hitchin} of the Fisher\nmetric as a natural measure on the moduli space of instantons that encodes the\nspace-time symmetries of a classical field theory. Motivated by the idea of the\nmoduli space of supersymmetric instantons as an emergent space in the sense of\nthe gauge/gravity duality, we extend the prescription to encode also global\nsymmetries of the underlying theory. We exemplify our construction with the\ninstanton solution of the $\\mathbb{CP}^{N}$ sigma model on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n", "  With an integrated luminosity of 2.47 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC, the exclusive decays $B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\phi$\nand $B_{d}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{*0}$ of $B$ mesons produced in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV are used to determine the ratio of fragmentation\nfractions $f_s/f_d$. From the observed $B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\phi$ and\n$B_{d}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{*0}$ yields, the quantity\n$\\frac{f_s}{f_d}\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(B_{s}^{0} \\rightarrow J/\\psi\n\\phi)}{\\mathcal{B}(B_{d}^{0} \\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{*0})}$ is measured to be\n0.199 $\\pm$ 0.004(stat) $\\pm$ 0.008(sys). Using a recent theory prediction for\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\phi)}{\\mathcal{B}(B_{d}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{*0})}$ yields\n$\\frac{f_s}{f_d} =$ 0.240 $\\pm$ 0.004(stat) $\\pm$ 0.010(sys) $\\pm$ 0.017(th).\nThis result is based on a new approach that provides a significant improvement\nof the world average.\n", "  We reconcile two scaling laws that have been proposed in the literature for\nthe slip length associated with a moving contact line in diffuse interface\nmodels, by demonstrating each to apply in a different regime of the ratio of\nthe microscopic interfacial width $l$ and the macroscopic diffusive length\n$l_D= (M\\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\\eta$ is the fluid viscosity and $M$ the mobility\ngoverning intermolecular diffusion. For small $l_D/l$ we find a diffuse\ninterface regime in which the slip length scales as $\\xi \\sim(l_Dl)^{1/2}$. For\nlarger $l_D/l>1$ we find a sharp interface regime in which the slip length\ndepends only on the diffusive length, $\\xi \\sim l_D \\sim (M\\eta)^{1/2}$, and\ntherefore only on the macroscopic variables $\\eta$ and $M$, independent of the\nmicroscopic interfacial width $l$. We also give evidence that modifying the\nmicroscopic interfacial terms in the model's free energy functional appears to\naffect the value of the slip length only the diffuse interface regime,\nconsistent with the slip length depending only on macroscopic variables in the\nsharp interface regime. Finally, we demonstrate the dependence of the dynamic\ncontact angle on the capillary number to be in excellent agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction of \\cite{Cox1986}, provided we allow the slip length to\nbe rescaled by a dimensionless prefactor. This prefactor appears to converge to\nunity in the sharp interface limit, but is smaller in the diffuse interface\nlimit. The excellent agreement of results obtained using three independent\nnumerical methods, across several decades of the relevant dimensionless\nvariables, demonstrates our findings to be free of numerical artifacts.\n", "  The current article shall contribute to understanding the classical analogue\nof the minimal photon sector in the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model Extension\n(SME). It is supposed to complement all studies performed on classical\npoint-particle equivalents of SME fermions. The classical analogue of a photon\nis not a massive particle being described by a usual equation of motion, but a\ngeometric ray underlying the eikonal equation. The first part of the paper will\nset up the necessary tools to understand this correspondence for interesting\ncases of the minimal SME photon sector. In conventional optics the eikonal\nequation follows from an action principle, which is demonstrated to work in\nmost (but not all) Lorentz-violating cases as well. The integrands of the\naction functional correspond to Finsler structures, which establishes the\nconnection to Finsler geometry. The second part of the article treats\nLorentz-violating light rays in a weak gravitational background by implementing\nthe principle of minimal coupling. Thereby it is shown how Lorentz violation in\nthe photon sector can be constrained by measurements of light bending at\nmassive bodies such as the Sun. The phenomenological studies are based on the\ncurrently running ESA mission GAIA and the planned NASA/ESA mission LATOR. The\nfinal part of the paper discusses certain aspects of explicit Lorentz violation\nin gravity based on the setting of Finsler geometry.\n", "  It is control that turns scientific knowledge into useful technology: in\nphysics and engineering it provides a systematic way for driving a system from\na given initial state into a desired target state with minimized expenditure of\nenergy and resources -- as famously applied in the Apollo programme. As one of\nthe cornerstones for enabling quantum technologies, optimal quantum control\nkeeps evolving and expanding into areas as diverse as quantum-enhanced sensing,\nmanipulation of single spins, photons, or atoms, optical spectroscopy,\nphotochemistry, magnetic resonance (spectroscopy as well as medical imaging),\nquantum information processing and quantum simulation. --- Here\nstate-of-the-art quantum control techniques are reviewed and put into\nperspective by a consortium uniting expertise in optimal control theory and\napplications to spectroscopy, imaging, quantum dynamics of closed and open\nsystems. We address key challenges and sketch a roadmap to future developments.\n", "  Double Field Theory provides a geometric framework capable of describing\nstring theory backgrounds that cannot be understood purely in terms of\nRiemannian geometry -- not only globally (`non-geometry'), but even locally\n(`non-Riemannian'). In this work, we show that the non-relativistic closed\nstring theory of Gomis and Ooguri [1] arises precisely as such a non-Riemannian\nstring background, and that the Gomis-Ooguri sigma model is equivalent to the\nDouble Field Theory sigma model of [2] on this background. We further show that\nthe target-space formulation of Double Field Theory on this non-Riemannian\nbackground correctly reproduces the appropriate sector of the Gomis-Ooguri\nstring spectrum. To do this, we develop a general semi-covariant formalism\ndescribing perturbations in Double Field Theory. We derive compact expressions\nfor the linearized equations of motion around a generic on-shell background,\nand construct the corresponding fluctuation Lagrangian in terms of novel\ncompletely covariant second order differential operators. We also present a new\nnon-Riemannian solution featuring Schr\\\"odinger conformal symmetry.\n", "  A rigid cylinder placed on a soft gel deforms its surface. When multiple\ncylinders are placed on the surface, they interact with each other via the\ntopography of the deformed gel which serves as an energy landscape; as they\nmove, the landscape changes which in turn changes their interaction. We use a\ncombination of experiments, simple scaling estimates and numerical simulations\nto study the self-assembly of cylinders in this elastic analog of the Cheerios\neffect for capillary interactions on a fluid interface. Our results show that\nthe effective two body interaction can be well described by an exponential\nattraction potential as a result of which the dynamics also show an exponential\nbehavior with respect to the separation distance. When many cylinders are\nplaced on the gel, the cylinders cluster together if they are not too far\napart; otherwise their motion gets elastically arrested.\n", "  In this paper, we study Bose-Hubbard models on the square and honeycomb\nlattices with complex hopping amplitudes, which are feasible by recent\nexperiments of cold atomic gases in optical lattices. To clarify phase\ndiagrams, we use an extended quantum Monte-Carlo simulations (eQMC). For the\nsystem on the square lattice, the complex hopping is realized by an artificial\nmagnetic field. We found that vortex-solid states form for certain set of\nmagnetic field, i.e., the magnetic field with the flux quanta per plaquette\n$f=p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are co-prime natural numbers. For the system on the\nhoneycomb lattice, we add the next-nearest neighbor complex hopping. The model\nis a bosonic analog of the Haldane-Hubbard model. By means of the eQMC, we\nstudy the model with both weak and strong on-site repulsions. Numerical study\nshows that the model has a rich phase diagram. We also found that in the system\ndefined on the honeycomb lattice of the cylinder geometry, an interesting edge\nstate appears.\n", "  The logarithmic velocity profile is the most important statistical law of\nclassical turbulence affected by channel walls. This paper demonstrates\nnumerically that the logarithmic velocity profile of a superfluid flow appears\nin quantum turbulence under pure normal flow in a channel. We investigated the\nconfiguration and dynamics of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle affected by the\nwalls, and found the characteristic behavior of the log-law.\n", "  We report the physical properties and electronic structure calculations of a\nlayered chromium oxypnictide, Sr$_2$Cr$_3$As$_2$O$_2$, which crystallizes in a\nSr$_2$Mn$_3$As$_2$O$_2$-type structure containing both CrO$_2$ planes and\nCr$_2$As$_2$ layers. The newly synthesized material exhibits a metallic\nconduction with a dominant electron-magnon scattering. Magnetic and\nspecific-heat measurements indicate at least two intrinsic magnetic transitions\nbelow room temperature. One is an antiferromagnetic transition at 291 K,\nprobably associated with a spin ordering in the Cr$_2$As$_2$ layers. Another\ntransition is broad, occurring at around 38 K, and possibly due to a\nshort-range spin order in the CrO$_2$ planes. Our first-principles calculations\nindicate predominant two-dimensional antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, and\nsuggest a KG-type (i.e. K$_2$NiF$_4$ type for CrO$_2$ planes and G type for\nCr$_2$As$_2$ layers) magnetic structure, with reduced moments for both Cr\nsublattices. The corresponding electronic states near the Fermi energy are\nmostly contributed from Cr-3$d$ orbitals which weakly (modestly) hybridize with\nthe O-2$p$ (As-4$p$) orbitals in the CrO$_2$ (Cr$_2$As$_2$) layers. The bare\nbandstructure density of states at the Fermi level is only $\\sim$1/4 of the\nexperimental value derived from the low-temperature specific-heat data,\nconsistent with the remarkable electron-magnon coupling. The title compound is\nargued to be a possible candidate to host superconductivity.\n", "  We numerically study models of $\\mathrm{H}_2$ and $\\mathrm{LiH}$ molecules,\naligned collinearly with the linear polarization of the external field, to\nelucidate the possible role of correlation in the enhanced-ionization\nphenomena. Correlation is considered at different levels of approximation with\nthe time-dependent generalized-active-space configuration-interaction method.\nThe results of our studies show that enhanced ionization occurs in\nmultielectron molecules, that correlation is important and they also\ndemonstrate significant deviations between the results of the\nsingle-active-electron approximation and more accurate\nconfiguration-interaction methods. With the inclusion of correlation we show\nstrong carrier-envelope-phase effects in the enhanced ionization of the\nasymmetric heteronuclear $\\mathrm{LiH}$-like molecule. The correlated\ncalculation shows an intriguing feature of cross-over in enhanced ionization\nwith two carrier-envelope-phases at critical inter-nuclear separation.\n", "  We consider an optomechanical quantum system composed of a single cavity mode\ninteracting with N mechanical resonators. We propose a scheme for generating\ncontinuous-variable graph states of arbitrary size and shape, including the\nso-called cluster states for universal quantum computation. The main feature of\nthis scheme is that, differently from previous approaches, the graph states are\nhosted in the mechanical degrees of freedom rather than in the radiative ones.\nSpecifically, via a 2N-tone laser drive, we engineer a linear Hamiltonian which\nis instrumental to dissipatively drive the system to the desired target state.\nThe robustness of this scheme is assessed against finite interaction times and\nmechanical noise, confirming it as a valuable approach towards quantum state\nengineering for continuous-variable computation in a solid-state platform.\n", "  Entanglement is the resource to overcome the natural limitations of spatially\nseparated parties restricted to Local Operations assisted by Classical\nCommunications (LOCC). Recently two new classes of operational entanglement\nmeasures, the source and the accessible entanglement, for arbitrary\nmultipartite states have been introduced. Whereas the source entanglement\nmeasures from how many states the state of interest can be obtained via LOCC,\nthe accessible entanglement measures how many states can be reached via LOCC\nfrom the state at hand. We consider here pure bipartite as well as multipartite\nstates and derive explicit formulae for the source entanglement. Moreover, we\nobtain explicit formulae for a whole class of source entanglement measures that\ncharacterize the simplicity of generating a given bipartite pure state via\nLOCC. Furthermore, we show how the accessible entanglement can be computed\nnumerically. For generic four-qubit states we first derive the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of LOCC transformations among these\nstates and then derive explicit formulae for their accessible and source\nentanglement.\n", "  Longitudinal spin Seebeck effect has been investigated for an uniaxial\nantiferromagnetic insulator Cr2O3, characterized by a spin-flop transition\nunder magnetic field along the c-axis. We have found that temperature gradient\napplied normal to Cr2O3/Pt interface induces inverse spin Hall voltage of spin\ncurrent origin in Pt, whose magnitude turns out to be always proportional to\nmagnetization in Cr2O3. The observed voltage shows significant enhancement for\nthe lower temperature region, which can be ascribed to the phonon-drag effect\non the relevant spin excitations. The above results establish that\nantiferromagnetic spin waves with high frequency above 100 GHz can be an\neffective carrier of spin current.\n", "  The electromagnetic form factors of the spin-3/2 $\\Omega$ baryons, namely\n$\\Omega$, $\\Omega_c^\\ast$, $\\Omega_{cc}^\\ast$ and $\\Omega_{ccc}$, are\ncalculated in full QCD on $32^3\\times 64$ PACS-CS lattices with a pion mass of\n156(9) MeV. The electric charge radii and magnetic moments from the $E0$ and\n$M1$ multipole form factors are extracted. Results for the electric quadrupole\nform factors, $E2$, are also given. Quark sector contributions are computed\nindividually for each observable and then combined to obtain the baryon\nproperties. We find that the charm quark contributions are systematically\nsmaller than the strange-quark contributions in the case of the charge radii\nand magnetic moments. $E2$ moments of the $\\Omega_{cc}^\\ast$ and $\\Omega_{ccc}$\nprovide a statistically significant data to conclude that their electric charge\ndistributions are deformed to an oblate shape. Properties of the spin-1/2\n$\\Omega_c$ and $\\Omega_{cc}$ baryons are also computed and a thorough\ncomparison is given. This complete study gives valuable hints about the\nheavy-quark dynamics in charmed hadrons.\n", "  We study the inhomogeneous 8-vertex model (or equivalently the XYZ Heisenberg\nspin-1/2 chain) with all kinds of integrable quasi-periodic boundary\nconditions: periodic, $\\sigma^x$-twisted, $\\sigma^y$-twisted or\n$\\sigma^z$-twisted. We show that in all these cases but the periodic one with\nan even number of sites $\\mathsf{N}$, the transfer matrix of the model is\nrelated, by the vertex-IRF transformation, to the transfer matrix of the\ndynamical 6-vertex model with antiperiodic boundary conditions, which we have\nrecently solved by means of Sklyanin's Separation of Variables (SOV) approach.\nWe show moreover that, in all the twisted cases, the vertex-IRF transformation\nis bijective. This allows us to completely characterize, from our previous\nresults on the antiperiodic dynamical 6-vertex model, the twisted 8-vertex\ntransfer matrix spectrum (proving that it is simple) and eigenstates. We also\nconsider the periodic case for $\\mathsf{N}$ odd. In this case we can define two\nindependent vertex-IRF transformations, both not bijective, and by using them\nwe show that the 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum is doubly degenerate, and\nthat it can, as well as the corresponding eigenstates, also be completely\ncharacterized in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of the dynamical\n6-vertex antiperiodic transfer matrix. In all these cases we can adapt to the\n8-vertex case the reformulations of the dynamical 6-vertex transfer matrix\nspectrum and eigenstates that had been obtained by $T$-$Q$ functional\nequations, where the $Q$-functions are elliptic polynomials with\ntwist-dependent quasi-periods. Such reformulations enables one to characterize\nthe 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum by the solutions of some Bethe-type\nequations, and to rewrite the corresponding eigenstates as the multiple action\nof some operators on a pseudo-vacuum state, in a similar way as in the\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz framework.\n", "  We introduce a new kind of space-filling brane, which we term \"G-brane\"\nbecause its action is a descendant of the gravitational action. The G-brane may\nbe thought of as the remanent of the gravitational field when the propagating\ngravitons are removed. The G-brane is different from the Dirac or Nambu\nspace-filling branes. Its properties in any spacetime dimension D are\nexhibited. When the spacetime dimension D is greater than or equal to three,\nthe G-brane does not possess propagating degrees of freedom, just as the Dirac\nor Nambu branes. For D=3 the G-brane yields a reformulation of gravitation\ntheory in which the Hamiltonian constraints can be solved explicitly, while\nkeeping the spacetime structure manifest. For D=2 the G-brane provides a\nrealization of the conformal algebra, i.e. a conformal field theory, in terms\nof two scalar fields and their conjugates, which possesses a classical central\ncharge. In the G-brane reformulation of (2+1) gravity, the boundary degrees of\nfreedom of the gravitational field in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space\nappear as \"matter\" coupled to the (1+1) G-brane on the boundary.\n", "  We show that, in contrast to known results in the massive case, a minimally\ngauged massless Rarita-Schwinger field yields a consistent classical theory,\nwith a generalized fermionic gauge invariance realized as a canonical\ntransformation. To simplify the algebra, we study a two-component left chiral\nreduction of the massless theory. We formulate the classical theory in both\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian form for a general non-Abelian gauging, and analyze\nthe constraints and the Rarita-Schwinger gauge invariance of the action. An\nexplicit wave front calculation for Abelian gauge fields shows that wave-like\nmodes do not propagate with superluminal velocities. An analysis of\nRarita-Schwinger spinor scattering from gauge fields shows that adiabatic\ndecoupling fails in the limit of zero gauge field amplitude, invalidating\nvarious \"no-go\" theorems based on \"on-shell\" methods that claim to show the\nimpossibility of gauging Rarita-Schwinger fields. Quantization of\nRarita-Schwinger fields, using many formulas from this paper, is taken up in\nthe following paper.\n", "  We study quantization of a minimally gauged massless Rarita-Schwinger field,\nby both Dirac bracket and functional integral methods. The Dirac bracket\napproach in covariant radiation gauge leads to an anticommutator that has a\nnon-singular limit as gauge fields approach zero, is manifestly positive\nsemidefinite, and is Lorentz invariant. The constraints also have the form\nneeded to apply the Faddeev-Popov method for deriving a functional integral,\nusing the same constrained Hamiltonian and inverse constraint matrix that\nappear in the Dirac bracket approach.\n", "  This paper presents a semi-quantitative mathematical model of the changes\nover time in the statistical distribution of well-being of individuals in a\nsociety. The model predicts that when individuals overvalue the more socially\nconspicuous aspects of well-being in their lifestyle choices, then the average\nwell-being of the overall population may experience continuous decline. In\naddition to trade-off cost and overvaluation, we identify statistical variation\nin individuals' well-being and turnover within the population as key factors\ndriving negative trends. We investigate the influence of the effects of\nheterogeneity in the population, as well as economic and/or technological\nprogress.\n", "  Here we present a quantum-statistical formulation of third-order polarization\nP(3)(t), which is induced in a sample by a sequence of incident external\nfields, and serves as a source of an emitted radiation field detected as a\nsignal in pump-probe (PP) experiments. Our treatment is based on the\nperturbation expansion of the non-equilibrium density matrix for calculation of\nmulti-time correlation functions, and the corresponding response function, at\nfinite temperature. As a model for our study, the high-temperature\nsuperconductor MgB2 has been selected. Knowledge of the electronic structure of\nthe studied system, and of the corresponding Eliashberg function that\nrepresents pertinent electron-phonon (EP) interactions, enabled us to\ndistinguish non-equilibrium processes running over different time-periods in a\nsequence of interactions with laser pulses on a microscopic level. We have also\nderived temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics as a function of delay time\nbetween the pump and probe pulses. For the studied model system of MgB2, we\nhave shown that an abrupt increase of the relaxation time at Tc, as detected by\nexperiments, is the direct consequence of sudden changes in the character of EP\ncoupling in transition from an adiabatic to a stabilized superconducting\nanti-adiabatic state, as it predicts the anti-adiabatic theory of\nelectron-vibration interactions. The BCS model, which preserves the adiabatic\ncharacter of EP coupling also below the critical temperature of MgB2, is\nbasically unable to reflect the enormous sudden increase of the relaxation\ntime. Based on diagrammatic perturbation theory, differences in the optical\npump-optical probe and the optical pump-terahertz probe settings of MgB2 PP\nrelaxation dynamics are discussed.\n", "  We comparatively analyze the rare $\\Lambda _b\\rightarrow \\Lambda \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ channel in standard model, supersymmetry and Randall-Sundrum model with\ncustodial protection (RS$_c$). Using the parametrization of the matrix elements\nentering the low energy effective Hamiltonian in terms of form factors, we\ncalculate the corresponding differential decay width and lepton\nforward-backward asymmetry in these models. We compare the results obtained\nwith the most recent data from LHCb as well as lattice QCD results on the\nconsidered quantities. It is obtained that the standard model, with the form\nfactors calculated in light-cone QCD sum rules, can not reproduce some\nexperimental data on the physical quantities under consideration but the\nsupersymmetry can do it. The RS$_c$ model predictions are roughly the same as\nthe standard model and there are no considerable differences between the\npredictions of these two models. In the case of differential decay rate, the\ndata in the range $4 $ GeV$^2/$c$^4\\leq$ $q^2 \\leq 6$ GeV$^2/$c$^4$ can not be\ndescribed by any of the considered models.\n", "  Reducing work fluctuation and dissipation in heat engines or, more generally,\ninformation heat engines that perform feedback control is vital to maximize\ntheir efficiency. The same problem arises when we attempt to maximize the\nefficiency of a given thermodynamic task that undergoes nonequilibrium\nprocesses for arbitrary initial and final states. We find that the most general\ntrade-off relation between work fluctuation and dissipation applicable to\narbitrary nonequilibrium processes is bounded from below by the information\ndistance characterizing how far the system is from thermal equilibrium. The\nminimum amount of dissipation is found to be given in terms of the relative\nentropy and the Renyi divergence, both of which quantify the information\ndistance between the state of the system and the canonical distribution. We\ngive an explicit protocol that achieves the fundamental lower bound of the\ntrade-off relation.\n", "  The CMS $e^+ e^- jj$ events of invariant mass near 2 TeV are consistent with\na $W'$ boson decaying into an electron and a right-handed neutrino whose\nTeV-scale mass is of the Dirac type. We show that the Dirac partner of the\nright-handed electron-neutrino can be the right-handed tau-neutrino. A\nprediction of this model is that the sum of the $\\tau^+ e^+ jj$ and $\\tau^- e^-\njj$ signal cross sections equals twice that for $e^+ e^- jj$. The Standard\nModel neutrinos acquire Majorana masses and mixings compatible with neutrino\noscillation data.\n", "  Biological and engineered systems operate by coupling function to the\ntransfer of heat and/or particles down a thermal or chemical gradient. In\nidealized \\textit{deterministically} driven systems, thermodynamic control can\nbe exerted reversibly, with no entropy production, as long as the rate of the\nprotocol is made slow compared to the equilibration time of the system. Here we\nconsider \\textit{fully realizable, entropically driven} systems where the\ncontrol parameters themselves obey rules that are reversible and that acquire\ndirectionality in time solely through dissipation. We show that when such a\nsystem moves in a directed way through thermodynamic space, it must produce\nentropy that is on average larger than its generalized displacement as measured\nby the Fisher information metric. This distance measure is sub-extensive but\ncannot be made small by slowing the rate of the protocol.\n", "  We study the twist defects in the toric code model introduced by Bombin\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 030403 (2010)]. Using a generalized 2D Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation, we show explicitly the twist defects carry unpaired Majorana\nzero modes. We also draw the same conclusion using two alternative approaches\nof a perturbation theory and a projective construction. We propose a quantum\nnon-demolition measurement scheme of the parity of Majorana modes. Such a\nscheme provides an alternative avenue to demonstrate the non-Abelian statistics\nof Majorana fermions with measurement-based braidings.\n", "  In this work we study the effects of strong magnetic fields on hybrid stars\nby using a full general-relativity approach, solving the coupled\nMaxwell-Einstein equation in a self-consistent way. The magnetic field is\nassumed to be axi-symmetric and poloidal. We take into consideration the\nanisotropy of the energy-momentum tensor due to the magnetic field, magnetic\nfield effects on equation of state, the interaction between matter and the\nmagnetic field (magnetization), and the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nhadrons. The equation of state used is an extended hadronic and quark SU(3)\nnon-linear realization of the sigma model that describes magnetized hybrid\nstars containing nucleons, hyperons and quarks. According to our results, the\neffects of the magnetization and the magnetic field on the EoS do not play an\nimportant role on global properties of these stars. On the other hand, the\nmagnetic field causes the central density in these objects to be reduced,\ninducing major changes in the populated degrees of freedom and, potentially,\nconverting a hybrid star into a hadronic star.\n", "  We investigate radiative processes of inertial two-level atoms in an\nentangled state interacting with a quantum electromagnetic field. Our intention\nis to clarify and to analyze the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and\nradiation reaction to the decay rate of the entangled state. The possible\nrelevance of the findings in the present work is discussed.\n", "  Non structural protein 3 (NS3) helicase from hepatitis C virus is an enzyme\nthat unwinds and translocates along nucleic acids with an ATP-dependent\nmechanism and has a key role in the replication of the viral RNA. An\ninchworm-like mechanism for translocation has been proposed based on crystal\nstructures and single molecule experiments. We here perform atomistic molecular\ndynamics in explicit solvent on the microsecond time scale of the available\nexperimental structures. We also construct and simulate putative intermediates\nfor the translocation process, and we perform non-equilibrium targeted\nsimulations to estimate their relative stability. For each of the simulated\nstructures we carefully characterize the available conformational space, the\nligand binding pocket, and the RNA binding cleft. The analysis of the hydrogen\nbond network and of the non-equilibrium trajectories indicates an ATP-dependent\nstabilization of one of the protein conformers. Additionally, enthalpy\ncalculations suggest that entropic effects might be crucial for the\nstabilization of the experimentally observed structures.\n", "  Recently Y. N. showed that the nonequilibrium critical relaxation of the 2D\nIsing model from the perfectly-ordered state in the Wolff algorithm is\ndescribed by the stretched-exponential decay, and found a universal scaling\nscheme to connect nonequilibrium and equilibrium behaviors. In the present\nstudy we extend these findings to vector spin models, and the 3D Heisenberg\nmodel could be a typical example. In order to evaluate the critical temperature\nand critical exponents precisely with the above scaling scheme, we calculate\nthe nonequilibrium ordering from the perfectly-disordered state in the\nSwendsen-Wamg algorithm, and find that the critical ordering process is\ndescribed by the stretched-exponential growth with the comparable exponent to\nthat of the 3D XY model. The critical exponents evaluated in the present study\nare consistent with those in previous studies.\n", "  Optically-induced nuclear spin polarization in a fluorine-doped ZnSe epilayer\nis studied by time-resolved Kerr rotation using resonant excitation of\ndonor-bound excitons. Excitation with helicity-modulated laser pulses results\nin a transverse nuclear spin polarization, which is detected as a change of the\nLarmor precession frequency of the donor-bound electron spins. The frequency\nshift in dependence on the transverse magnetic field exhibits a pronounced\ndispersion-like shape with resonances at the fields of nuclear magnetic\nresonance of the constituent zinc and selenium isotopes. It is studied as a\nfunction of external parameters, particularly of constant and radio frequency\nexternal magnetic fields. The width of the resonance and its shape indicate a\nstrong spatial inhomogeneity of the nuclear spin polarization in the vicinity\nof a fluorine donor. A mechanism of optically-induced nuclear spin polarization\nis suggested based on the concept of resonant nuclear spin cooling driven by\nthe inhomogeneous Knight field of the donor-bound electron.\n", "  We consider a complete list of simplified models in which Majorana dark\nmatter particles annihilate at tree level to $hh$ or $hZ$ final states, and\ncalculate the loop-induced elastic scattering cross section with nuclei in each\ncase. Expressions for these annihilation and elastic scattering cross sections\nare provided, and can be easily applied to a variety of UV complete models. We\nidentify several phenomenologically viable scenarios, including dark matter\nthat annihilates through the $s$-channel exchange of a spin-zero mediator or\nthrough the $t$-channel exchange of a fermion. Although the elastic scattering\ncross sections predicted in this class of models are generally quite small,\nXENON1T and LZ should be sensitive to significant regions of this parameter\nspace. Models in which the dark matter annihilates to $hh$ or $hZ$ can also\ngenerate a gamma-ray signal that is compatible with the excess observed from\nthe Galactic Center.\n", "  In this work we study associated production of heavy Z boson and heavy top\nquark in the framework of Littlest Higgs model at e^-e^+ colliders considering\nparameter space allowed by the electroweak precision measurments. According to\nthe free parameters of the model the possibility of detecting of new heavy\nparticles at sqrt{s}=3 TeV and yearly integrated luminosity of L=500 fb^-1 are\ndiscussed. We find that in a narrow range of the parameter space,\ns/s'=0.8/0.6,0.7, 0.4 <= x_L <= 0.6 and f <~1060 GeV, a statical significance\nof 5 sigma can be achieved. We also discuss constraints on masses of heavy top\nquark and heavy Z boson together with the mixing parameters s and x_L at\nsqrt{s}=3000 GeV.\n", "  We show that the so called $\\lambda$ deformed $\\sigma$-model as well as the\n$\\eta$ deformed one belong to a class of the ${\\cal E}$-models introduced in\nthe context of the Poisson-Lie-T-duality. The $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ theories\ndiffer solely by the choice of the Drinfeld double; for the $\\lambda$ model the\ndouble is the direct product $G\\times G$ while for the $\\eta$ model it is the\ncomplexified group $G^{\\mathbb{C}}$. As a consequence of this picture, we prove\nfor any $G$ that the target space geometries of the $\\lambda$-model and of the\nPoisson-Lie T-dual of the $\\eta$-model are related by a simple analytic\ncontinuation.\n", "  We prove that the system of subordination equations, defining the free\nadditive convolution of two probability measures, is stable away from the edges\nof the support and blow-up singularities by showing that the recent smoothness\ncondition of Kargin is always satisfied. As an application, we consider the\nlocal spectral statistics of the random matrix ensemble $A+UBU^*$, where $U$ is\na Haar distributed random unitary or orthogonal matrix, and $A$ and $B$ are\ndeterministic matrices. In the bulk regime, we prove that the empirical\nspectral distribution of $A+UBU^*$ concentrates around the free additive\nconvolution of the spectral distributions of $A$ and $B$ on scales down to\n$N^{-2/3}$.\n", "  The electronic and transport properties of CuInTe2 chalcopyrite are\ninvestigated using density functional calculations combined with Boltzmann\ntheory. The band gap predicted from hybrid functional is 0.92 eV, which agrees\nwell with experimental data and leads to relatively larger Seebeck coefficient\ncompared with those of narrow-gap thermoelectric materials. By fine tuning the\ncarrier concentration, the electrical conductivity and power factor of the\nsystem can be significantly optimized. Together with the inherent low thermal\nconductivity, the ZT values of CuInTe2 compound can be enhanced to as high as\n1.72 at 850 K, which is obviously larger than those measured experimentally and\nsuggests there is still room to improve the thermoelectric performance of this\nchalcopyrite compound.\n", "  We investigate the impact of tidal interactions, before any mass transfer, on\nvarious properties of the stellar models. We study the conditions for obtaining\nhomogeneous evolution triggered by tidal interactions, and for avoiding any\nRoche lobe overflow during the Main-Sequence phase. We consider the case of\nrotating stars computed with a strong coupling mediated by an interior magnetic\nfield. In models without any tidal interaction (single stars and wide\nbinaries), homogeneous evolution in solid body rotating models is obtained when\ntwo conditions are realized: the initial rotation must be high enough, the loss\nof angular momentum by stellar winds should be modest. This last point favors\nmetal-poor fast rotating stars. In models with tidal interactions, homogeneous\nevolution is obtained when rotation imposed by synchronization is high enough\n(typically a time-averaged surface velocities during the Main-Sequence phase\nabove 250 km s$^{-1}$), whatever the mass losses. In close binaries, mixing is\nstronger at higher than at lower metallicities. Homogeneous evolution is thus\nfavored at higher metallicities. Roche lobe overflow avoidance is favored at\nlower metallicities due to the fact that stars with less metals remain more\ncompact. We study also the impact of different processes for the angular\nmomentum transport on the surface abundances and velocities in single and close\nbinaries. In models where strong internal coupling is assumed, strong surface\nenrichments are always associated to high surface velocities in binary or\nsingle star models. In contrast, models computed with mild coupling may produce\nstrong surface enrichments associated to low surface velocities. Close binary\nmodels may be of interest for explaining homogeneous massive stars, fast\nrotating Wolf-Rayet stars, and progenitors of long soft gamma ray bursts, even\nat high metallicities.\n", "  The motivation for our study is the disputed cause for the strong variation\nof 14-C around AD 775. Our method is to compare the 14-C variation around AD\n775 with other periods of strong variability. Our results are: (a) We see three\nperiods, where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain\npattern of strong secular variation: after a Grand Minimum with strongly\nincreasing 14-C, there is a series of strong short-term drop(s), rise(s), and\nagain drop(s) within 60 yr, ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand\nMinimum. These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671, AD 775,\nand AD 1795. (b) We show with several solar activity proxies (radioisotopes,\nsunspots, and aurorae) for the AD 770s and 1790s that such intense rapid 14-C\nincreases can be explained by strong rapid decreases in solar activity and,\nhence, wind, so that the decrease in solar modulation potential leads to an\nincrease in radioisotope production. (c) The strong rises around AD 775 and\n1795 are due to three effects, (i) very strong activity in the previous cycles\n(i.e. very low 14-C level), (ii) the declining phase of a very strong Schwabe\ncycle, and (iii) a phase of very weak activity after the strong 14-C rise --\nvery short and/or weak cycle(s) like the suddenly starting Dalton minimum. (d)\nFurthermore, we can show that the strong change at AD 1795 happened after a\npair of two packages of four Schwabe cycles with certain hemispheric leadership\n(each package consists of two Gnevyshev-Ohl pairs, respectively two\nHale-Babcock pairs). We show with several additional arguments that the rise\naround AD 775 was not that special. ...\n", "  The spin decomposition of the proton is a long-standing topic of much\ninterest in hadronic physics. Lattice QCD has had much success in calculating\nthe connected contributions to the quark spin. However, complete calculations,\nwhich necessarily involve gluonic and strange-quark contributions, still\npresent some challenges. These \"disconnected\" contributions typically involve\nsmall signals hidden against large statistical backgrounds and rely on\ncomputationally intensive stochastic techniques. In this work we demonstrate\nhow a Feynman-Hellmann approach may be used to calculate such quantities, by\nmeasuring shifts in the proton energy arising from artificial modifications to\nthe QCD action. We find a statistically significant non-zero result for the\ndisconnected quark spin contribution to the proton of about -5% at a pion mass\nof 470 MeV.\n", "  The nonlinear theory of amplitude modulation of electrostatic wave envelopes\nin a collisionless electron-positron (EP) pair plasma is studied by using a set\nof Vlasov-Poisson equations in the context of Tsallis' $q$-nonextensive\nstatistics. In particular, the previous linear theory of Langmuir oscillations\nin EP plasmas [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf87}, 053112 (2013)] is rectified and modified.\nApplying the multiple scale technique (MST), it is shown that the evolution of\nelectrostatic wave envelopes is governed by a nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger (NLS)\nequation with a nonlocal nonlinear term $\\propto\n{\\cal{P}}\\int|\\phi(\\xi',\\tau)|^2d\\xi'\\phi/(\\xi-\\xi') $ [where ${\\cal P}$\ndenotes the Cauchy principal value, $\\phi$ is the small-amplitude electrostatic\n(complex) potential, and $\\xi$ and $\\tau$ are the stretched coordinates in MST]\nwhich appears due to the wave-particle resonance. It is found that a subregion\n$1/3<q\\lesssim3/5$ of superextensivity $(q<1)$ exists where the carrier wave\nfrequency can turn over with the group velocity going to zero and then to\nnegative values. The effects of the nonlocal nonlinear term and the\nnonextensive parameter $q$ are examined on the modulational instability (MI) of\nwave envelopes as well as on the solitary wave solution of the NLS equation. It\nis found that the modulated wave packet is always unstable (nonlinear Landau\ndamping) due to the nonlocal nonlinearity in the NLS equation. Furthermore, the\neffect of the nonlinear Landau damping is to slow down the amplitude of the\nwave envelope, and the corresponding decay rate can be faster the larger is the\nnumber of superthermal particles in pair plasmas.\n", "  Direct detection of vacuum fluctuations and analysis of sub-cycle quantum\nproperties of the electric field are explored by a paraxial quantum theory of\nultrafast electro-optic sampling. The feasibility of such experiments is\ndemonstrated by realistic calculations adopting a thin ZnTe electro-optic\ncrystal and stable few-femtosecond laser pulses. We show that nonlinear mixing\nof a short near-infrared probe pulse with multi-terahertz vacuum field modes\nleads to an increase of the signal variance with respect to the shot noise\nlevel. The vacuum contribution increases significantly for appropriate length\nof the nonlinear crystal, short probe pulse durations, tight focusing, and\nsufficiently large number of photons per probe pulse. If the vacuum input is\nsqueezed, the signal variance depends on the probe delay. Temporal positions\nwith noise level below the pure vacuum may be traced with a sub-cycle accuracy.\n", "  The damping of spin waves parametrically excited in the magnetic insulator\nYttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) is controlled by a dc current passed through an\nadjacent normal-metal film. The experiment is performed on a macroscopically\nsized YIG(100nm)/Pt(10nm) bilayer of 4x2 mm^2 lateral dimensions. The spin-wave\nrelaxation frequency is determined via the threshold of the parametric\ninstability measured by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy. The\napplication of a dc current to the Pt film leads to the formation of a\nspin-polarized electron current normal to the film plane due to the spin Hall\neffect (SHE). This spin current exerts a spin transfer torque (STT) in the YIG\nfilm and, thus, changes the spin-wave damping. Depending on the polarity of the\napplied dc current with respect to the magnetization direction, the damping can\nbe increased or decreased. The magnitude of its variation is proportional to\nthe applied current. A variation in the relaxation frequency of +/-7.5% is\nachieved for an applied dc current density of 5*10^10 A/m^2.\n", "  Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations along with higher-order spin-wave\ntheory, bond-operator and strong-coupling expansions, we analyse the dynamical\nspin structure factor of the spin-half Heisenberg model on the square-lattice\nbilayer. We identify distinct contributions from the low-energy Goldstone modes\nin the magnetically ordered phase and the gapped triplon modes in the quantum\ndisordered phase. In the antisymmetric (with respect to layer inversion)\nchannel, the dynamical spin structure factor exhibits a continuous evolution of\nspectral features across the quantum phase transition, connecting the two types\nof modes. Instead, in the symmetric channel we find a depletion of the spectral\nweight when moving from the ordered to the disordered phase. While the\ndynamical spin structure factor does not exhibit a well-defined distinct\ncontribution from the amplitude (or Higgs) mode in the ordered phase, we\nidentify an only marginally-damped amplitude mode in the dynamical singlet\nstructure factor, obtained from interlayer bond correlations, in the vicinity\nof the quantum critical point. These findings provide quantitative information\nin direct relation to possible neutron or light scattering experiments in a\nfundamental two-dimensional quantum-critical spin system.\n", "  A microscopic study of the individual annealed (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots is\ndone by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The\nCauchy-Green strain-tensor component distribution and the chemical composition\nof the (In,Ga)As alloy are extracted from the microscopy images. The image\nprocessing allows for the reconstruction of the strain-induced electric-field\ngradients at the individual atomic columns extracting thereby the magnitude and\nasymmetry parameter of the nuclear quadrupole interaction. Nuclear magnetic\nresonance absorption spectra are analyzed for parallel and transverse mutual\norientations of the electric-field gradient and a static magnetic field.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate that, in a ferromagnet/paramagnet bilayer, a\nmagnon instability accompanied by a gigahertz microwave emission can be driven\nsimply by means of a temperature bias. Employing many-body theory for\ninvestigating the effects of a phonon heat current on the magnon lifetime, we\nshow that the magnon instability occurs upon the suppression of the Umklapp\nscattering at low temperatures, leading to microwave emission. The present\nfinding provides crucial information about the interplay of spin current and\nheat current.\n", "  We study the percolation and jamming of rods ($k$-mers) on a square lattice\nthat contains defects. The point defects are placed randomly and uniformly on\nthe substrate before deposition of the rods. The general case of unequal\nprobabilities for orientation of depositing of rods along different directions\nof the lattice is analyzed. Two different models of deposition are used. In the\nrelaxation random sequential adsorption model (RRSA), the deposition of rods is\ndistributed over different sites on the substrate. In the single cluster\nrelaxation model (RSC), the single cluster grows by the random accumulation of\nrods on the boundary of the cluster. For both models, a suppression of growth\nof the infinite cluster at some critical concentration of defects $d_c$ is\nobserved. In the zero defect lattices, the jamming concentration $p_j$ (RRSA)\nand the density of single clusters $p_s$ (RSC) decrease with increasing length\nrods and with a decrease in the order parameter. For the RRSA model, the value\nof $d_c$ decreases for short rods as the value of $s$ increases. For longer\nrods, the value of $d_c$ is almost independent of $s$. Moreover, for short\nrods, the percolation threshold is almost insensitive to the defect\nconcentration for all values of $s$. For the RSC model, the growth of clusters\nwith ellipse-like shapes is observed for non-zero values of $s$. The density of\nthe clusters $p_s$ at the critical concentration of defects $d_c$ depends in a\ncomplex manner on the values of $s$ and $k$. For disordered systems, the value\nof $p_s$ tends towards zero in the limits of the very long rods and very small\ncritical concentrations $d_c \\to 0$. In this case, the introduction of defects\nresults in a suppression of rods stacking and in the formation of `empty' or\nloose clusters with very low density. On the other hand, denser clusters are\nformed for ordered systems.\n", "  We present an asymmetric step-barrier potential for which the one-dimensional\nstationary Schr\\\"odinger equation is exactly solved in terms of the confluent\nhypergeometric functions. The potential is given in terms of the Lambert\n-function, which is an implicitly elementary function also known as the product\nlogarithm. We present the general solution of the problem and consider the\nquantum reflection at transmission of a particle above this potential barrier.\nCompared with the abrupt-step and hyperbolic tangent potentials, which are\nreproduced by the Lambert potential in certain parameter and/or variable\nvariation regions, the reflection coefficient is smaller because of the lesser\nsteepness of the potential on the particle incidence side. Presenting the\nderivation of the Lambert potential we show that this is a four-parametric\nsub-potential of a more general five-parametric one also solvable in terms of\nthe confluent hypergeometric functions. The latter potential, however, is a\nconditionally integrable one. Finally, we show that there exists one more\npotential the solution for which is written in terms of the derivative of a\nbi-confluent Heun function.\n", "  Bismaleimide (BMI) resins are a new breed of thermosetting resins used mainly\nfor high temperature applications and have major usage in aerospace. BMI\npolymer coatings were deposited on aluminum and mild steel substrates. The\neffect of corrosion on mild steel and aluminum by Ringers Solution and there\nprotection using BMI coatings were observed. X-ray diffraction studies showed\ncrystalline nature of the BMI coatings. Surface contact angle measurements were\ncarried out using goniometer.\n", "  Understanding the underlying mechanism and phenomenology of colossal\nmagnetoresistance in manganites has largely focused on atomic and nanoscale\nphysics such as double exchange, phase separation, and charge order. Here we\nconsider a more macroscopic view of manganite materials physics, reporting on\nthe ferromagnetic domain behavior in a bilayer manganite sample with a nominal\ncomposition of La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ with $x=0.38$, studied using\nin-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. The role of\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy on the structure of domain walls was elucidated.\nOn cooling, magnetic domain contrast was seen to appear first at the Curie\ntemperature within the $a-b$ plane. With further reduction in temperature, the\nchange in area fraction of magnetic domains was used to estimate the critical\nexponent describing the ferromagntic phase transition. The ferromagnetic phase\ntransition was accompanied by a distinctive nanoscale granular contrast close\nto the Curie temperature, which we infer to be related to the presence of\nferromagnetic nanoclusters in a paramagnetic matrix, which has not yet been\nreported in bilayer manganites.\n", "  We use the AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic softwall model to\ninvestigate the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) in the exponentially small $x$\n(Bjorken Parameter) regime. We calculate the corresponding structure functions\nfor scalar fields. Using these results we studied the problem of the saturation\nline in the strong interactions. Our results are consistent with those achieved\nusing other models.\n", "  Above-threshold ionization (ATI) results from strong field laser-matter\ninteraction and it is one of the fundamental processes that may be used to\nextract electron structural and dynamical information about the atomic or\nmolecular target. Moreover, it can also be used to characterize the laser field\nitself. Here, we develop an analytical description of ATI, which extends the\ntheoretical Strong Field Approximation (SFA), for both the direct and\nre-scattering transition amplitudes in atoms. From a non-local, but separable\npotential, the bound-free dipole and the re-scattering transition matrix\nelements are analytically computed. In comparison with the standard approaches\nto the ATI process, our analytical derivation of the re-scattering matrix\nelements allows us to study directly how the re-scattering process depends on\nthe atomic target and laser pulse features -we can turn on and off\ncontributions having different physical origins or corresponding to different\nphysical mechanisms. We compare SFA results with the full numerical solutions\nof the time-dependent Schroedinger equation (TDSE) within the few-cycle pulse\nregime. Good agreement between our SFA and TDSE model is found for the ATI\nspectrum. Our model captures also the strong dependence of the photoelectron\nspectra on the carrier envelope phase of the laser field.\n", "  We study high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way type galaxies\nobtained within the \"Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments\"\n(EAGLE) project, and identify the those that best satisfy observational\nconstraints on the Milky Way total stellar mass, rotation curve, and galaxy\nshape. Contrary to mock galaxies selected on the basis of their total virial\nmass, the Milky Way analogues so identified consistently exhibit very similar\ndark matter profiles inside the solar circle, therefore enabling more accurate\npredictions for indirect dark matter searches. We find in particular that high\nresolution simulated haloes satisfying observational constraints exhibit,\nwithin the inner few kiloparsecs, dark matter profiles shallower than those\nrequired to explain the so-called Fermi GeV excess via dark matter\nannihilation.\n", "  We describe a general method to obtain quantum speedups of classical\nalgorithms which are based on the technique of backtracking, a standard\napproach for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Backtracking\nalgorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an\nattempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking\nalgorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none\nexists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex\ncorresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a\nbounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T)\nn^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to\nspeed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient\nSAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a\nquantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree. We also\ndiscuss how, for certain distributions on the inputs, the algorithm can lead to\nan exponential reduction in expected runtime.\n", "  We constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence using four-point correlations\nof even-parity $E$-mode and odd-parity $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements made by the POLARization of the Background\nRadiation (POLARBEAR) experiment in its first season of observations. We find\nthat the anisotropic cosmic birefringence signal from any parity-violating\nprocesses is consistent with zero. The Faraday rotation from anisotropic cosmic\nbirefringence can be compared with the equivalent quantity generated by\nprimordial magnetic fields if they existed. The POLARBEAR nondetection\ntranslates into a 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit of 93 nanogauss (nG)\non the amplitude of an equivalent primordial magnetic field inclusive of\nsystematic uncertainties. This four-point correlation constraint on Faraday\nrotation is about 15 times tighter than the upper limit of 1380 nG inferred\nfrom constraining the contribution of Faraday rotation to two-point\ncorrelations of $B$-modes measured by Planck in 2015. Metric perturbations\nsourced by primordial magnetic fields would also contribute to the $B$-mode\npower spectrum. Using the POLARBEAR measurements of the $B$-mode power spectrum\n(two-point correlation), we set a 95% C.L. upper limit of 3.9 nG on primordial\nmagnetic fields assuming a flat prior on the field amplitude. This limit is\ncomparable to what was found in the Planck 2015 two-point correlation analysis\nwith both temperature and polarization. We perform a set of systematic error\ntests and find no evidence for contamination. This work marks the first time\nthat anisotropic cosmic birefringence or primordial magnetic fields have been\nconstrained from the ground at subdegree scales.\n", "  We derive steerability criteria applicable for both finite and infinite\ndimensional quantum systems using covariance matrices of local observables. We\nshow that these criteria are useful to detect a wide range of entangled states\nparticularly in high dimensional systems and that the Gaussian steering\ncriteria for general M x N-modes of continuous variables are obtained as a\nspecial case. Extending from the approach of entanglement detection via\ncovariance matrices, our criteria are based on the local uncertainty principles\nincorporating the asymmetric nature of steering scenario. Specifically, we\napply the formulation to the case of local orthogonal observables and obtain\nsome useful criteria that can be straightforwardly computable, and testable in\nexperiment, with no need for numerical optimization.\n", "  We study the spin transport in the low temperature regime (often referred to\nas the precession-dominated regime) between a ferromagnetic Fermi liquid (FFL)\nand a normal metal metallic Fermi liquid (NFL), also known as the F/N junction,\nwhich is considered as one of the most basic spintronic devices. In particular,\nwe explore the propagation of spin waves and transport of magnetization through\nthe interface of the F/N junction where nonequilibrium spin polarization is\ncreated on the normal metal side of the junction by electrical spin injection.\nWe calculate the probable spin wave modes in the precession-dominated regime on\nboth sides of the junction especially on the NFL side where the system is out\nof equilibrium. Proper boundary conditions at the interface are introduced to\nestablish the transport of the spin properties through the F/N junction. A\npossible transmission conduction electron spin resonance (CESR) experiment is\nsuggested on the F/N junction to see if the predicted spin wave modes could\nindeed propagate through the junction. Potential applications based on this\nnovel spin transport feature of the F/N junction are proposed in the end.\n", "  Both physical arguments and simulations of the global heliosphere indicate\nthat the tailward heliopause is flattened considerably in the direction\nperpendicular to both the incoming flow and the large-scale interstellar\nmagnetic field. Despite this fact, all of the existing global analytical models\nof the outer heliosheath's magnetic field assume a circular cross section of\nthe heliotail. To eliminate this inconsistency, we introduce a mathematical\nprocedure by which any analytically or numerically given magnetic field can be\ndeformed in such a way that the cross sections along the heliotail axis attain\nfreely prescribed, spatially dependent values for their total area and aspect\nratio. The distorting transformation of this method honors both the\nsolenoidality condition and the stationary induction equation with respect to\nan accompanying flow field, provided that both constraints were already\nsatisfied for the original magnetic and flow fields prior to the\ntransformation. In order to obtain realistic values for the above parameters,\nwe present the first quantitative analysis of the heliotail's overall\ndistortion as seen in state-of-the-art three-dimensional hybrid MHD-kinetic\nsimulations.\n", "  Topological insulators in the presence of strong Coulomb interaction\nconstitute novel phases of matter. Transitions between these phases can be\ndriven by single-particle or many-body effects. On the basis of {\\it ab-initio}\ncalculations, we identify a concrete material, {\\it i.e.} Ca$_{2}$PtO$_{4}$,\nthat turns out to be a hole-doped weak topological insulator. Interestingly,\nthe Pt-$d$ orbitals in this material are relevant for the band inversion that\ngives rise to the topological phase. Therefore, Coulomb interaction should be\nof importance in Ca$_{2}$PtO$_{4}$. To study the influence of interactions on\nthe weak topological insulating phase, we look at a toy model corresponding to\na layer-stacked 3D version of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with local\ninteractions. For small to intermediate interaction strength, we discover novel\ninteraction-driven topological phase transitions between the weak topological\ninsulator and two Dirac semimetal phases. The latter correspond to gapless\ntopological phases. For strong interactions, the system eventually becomes a\nMott insulator.\n", "  While the existence of a chiral spin liquid (CSL) on a class of spin-1/2\nkagome antiferromagnets is by now well-established numerically, a controlled\ntheoretical path from the lattice model leading to a low energy topological\nfield theory is still lacking. This we provide via an explicit construction,\nstarting from reformulating a microscopic model for a CSL as a lattice gauge\ntheory, and deriving the low-energy form of its continuum limit. A crucial\ningredient is the realisation that the bosonic spinons of the gauge theory\nexhibit a $U(1)$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, which upon\npromoting its $U(1)$ global symmetry to a local gauge structure (\"gauging\")\nyields the CSL. We suggest that such an explicit lattice-based construction\ninvolving gauging of an SPT phase can be applied more generally to understand\ntopological spin liquids.\n", "  We show that a self-interacting neutrino gas can spontaneously acquire a\nnon-stationary pulsating component in its flavor content, with a frequency that\ncan exactly cancel the \"multi-angle\" refractive effects of dense matter. This\ncan then enable homogeneous and inhomogeneous flavor conversion instabilities\nto exist even at large neutrino and matter densities, where the system would\nhave been stable if the evolution were strictly stationary. Large flavor\nconversions, especially close to a supernova core, are possible via this novel\nmechanism. This may have important consequences for the explosion dynamics,\nnucleosynthesis, as well as for neutrino observations of supernovae.\n", "  A nondissipative supercurrent state of a Josephson junction is metastable\nwith respect to the formation of a finite-resistance state. This transition is\ndriven by fluctuations, thermal at high temperatures and quantum at low\ntemperatures. We evaluate the life time of such a state due to quantum\nfluctuations in the limit when the supercurrent is approaching the critical\ncurrent. The decay probability is determined by the instanton action for the\nsuperconducting phase difference across the junction. At low temperatures,\ndynamics of the phase is massive and is determined by the effective\ncapacitance, which is a sum of the geometric and intrinsic capacitance of the\njunction. We model the central part of the Josephson junction either by an\narbitrary short mesoscopic conductor described by the set of its transmission\ncoefficients, or by a diffusive wire of an arbitrary length. The intrinsic\ncapacitance can generally be estimated as $C_* \\sim G/E_g$, where $G$ is the\nnormal-state conductance of the junction and $E_g$ is the proximity minigap in\nits normal part. The obtained capacitance is sufficiently large to\nqualitatively explain hysteretic behavior of the current-voltage characteristic\neven in the absence of overheating.\n", "  We give a gauge-independent definition of magnetic monopoles in the $SU(N)$\nYang-Mills theory through the Wilson loop operator. For this purpose, we give\nan explicit proof of the Diakonov-Petrov version of the non-Abelian Stokes\ntheorem for the Wilson loop operator in an arbitrary representation of the\n$SU(N)$ gauge group to derive a new form for the non-Abelian Stokes theorem.\nThe new form is used to extract the magnetic-monopole contribution to the\nWilson loop operator in a gauge-invariant way, which enables us to discuss\nconfinement of quarks in any representation from the viewpoint of the dual\nsuperconductor vacuum.\n", "  A planar crack generically segments into an array of \"daughter cracks\" shaped\nas tilted facets when loaded with both a tensile stress normal to the crack\nplane (mode I) and a shear stress parallel to the crack front (mode III). We\ninvestigate facet propagation and coarsening using in-situ microscopy\nobservations of fracture surfaces at different stages of quasi-static\nmixed-mode crack propagation and phase-field simulations. The results\ndemonstrate that the bifurcation from propagating planar to segmented crack\nfront is strongly subcritical, reconciling previous theoretical predictions of\nlinear stability analysis with experimental observations. They further show\nthat facet coarsening is a self- similar process driven by a spatial\nperiod-doubling instability of facet arrays with a growth rate dependent on\nmode mixity. Those results have important implications for understanding the\nfailure of a wide range of materials.\n", "  A diode, a device allowing unidirectional signal transmission, is a\nfundamental element of logic structures and lies in the heart of modern\ninformation systems. Spin wave or magnon, representing a collective\nquasi-particle excitation of the magnetic order in magnetic materials, is a\npromising candidate of information carrier for the next generation\nenergy-saving technologies. Here we propose a scalable and reprogrammable pure\nspin wave logic hardware architecture using domain walls and surface anisotropy\nstripes as waveguides on a single magnetic wafer. We demonstrate theoretically\nthe design principle of the simplest logic component, a spin wave diode,\nutilizing the chiral bound states in a magnetic domain wall with\nDzyaloshiskii-Moriya interaction, and confirm its performance through\nmicromagnetic simulations. Our findings open a new vista for realizing\ndifferent types of pure spin wave logic components and finally achieving an\nenergy-efficient and hardware-reprogrammable spin wave computer.\n", "  Large-area single-layer WS$_2$ is grown epitaxially on Au(111) using\nevaporation of W atoms in a low pressure H$_2$S atmosphere. It is characterized\nby means of scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction and\ncore-level spectroscopy. Its electronic band structure is determined by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The valence band maximum at\n$\\bar{K}$ is found to be significantly higher than at $\\bar{\\Gamma}$. The\nobserved dispersion around $\\bar{K}$ is in good agreement with density\nfunctional theory calculations for a free-standing monolayer, whereas the bands\nat $\\bar{\\Gamma}$ are found to be hybridized with states originating from the\nAu substrate. Strong spin-orbit coupling leads to a large spin-splitting of the\nbands in the neighborhood of the $\\bar{K}$ points, with a maximum splitting of\n419(11)~meV. The valence band dispersion around $\\bar{K}$ is found to be highly\nanisotropic with spin-branch dependent effective hole masses of $0.40(02)m_e$\nand $0.57(09)m_e$ for the upper and lower split valence band, respectively. The\nlarge size of the spin-splitting and the low effective mass of the valence band\nmaximum make single-layer WS$_2$ a promising alternative to the widely studied\nMoS$_2$ for applications in electronics, spintronics and valleytronics.\n", "  Polariton-mediated light-sound interaction is investigated through resonant\nBrillouin experiments in GaAs/AlAs multiple-quantum wells. Photoelastic\ncoupling enhancement at exciton-polariton resonance reaches 105 at 30 K as\ncompared to a typical bulk solid room temperature transparency value. When\napplied to GaAs based cavity optomechanical nanodevices, this result opens the\npath to huge displacement sensitivities and to novel ultrastrong-coupling\ncavity phenomena with optomechanical couplings g0 in the range of 100 THz.\n", "  We present evidence of Kelvin excitations in space-time resolved spectra of\nnumerical simulations of quantum turbulence. Kelvin waves are transverse and\ncircularly polarized waves that propagate along quantized vortices, for which\nthe restitutive force is the tension of the vortex line, and which play an\nimportant role in theories of superfluid turbulence. We use the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation to model quantum flows, letting an initial array of\nwell-organized vortices develop into a turbulent bundle of intertwined vortex\nfilaments. By achieving high spatial and temporal resolution we are able to\ncalculate space-time resolved mass density and kinetic energy spectra. Evidence\nof Kelvin and sound waves is clear in both spectra. Identification of the waves\nallows us to extract the spatial spectrum of Kelvin waves, clarifying their\nrole in the transfer of energy\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the Yangian symmetry of smooth supersymmetric\nMaldacena-Wilson loops in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This hidden\nsymmetry extends the global superconformal symmetry present for these\nobservables. A gauge-covariant action of the Yangian generators on the Wilson\nline is established that generalizes previous constructions built upon path\nvariations. Employing these generators the Yangian symmetry is proven for\ngeneral paths in non-chiral N=4 superspace at the first perturbative order. The\nbi-local piece of the level-one generators requires the use of a regulator due\nto divergences in the coincidence limit. We perform regularization by point\nsplitting in detail, thereby constructing additional local and boundary\ncontributions as regularization for all level-one Yangian generators. Moreover,\nthe Yangian algebra at level one is checked and compatibility with local\nkappa-symmetry is established. Finally, the consistency of the Yangian symmetry\nis shown to depend on two properties: The vanishing of the dual Coxeter number\nof the underlying superconformal algebra and the existence of a novel\nsuperspace \"G-identity\" for the gauge field theory. This tightly constrains the\nconformal gauge theories to which integrability can possibly apply.\n", "  We derive the decay rate of an unstable phase of a quantum field theory in\nthe presence of an impurity in the thin-wall approximation. This derivation is\nbased on the how the impurity changes the (flat spacetime) geometry relative to\ncase of pure false vacuum. Two examples are given that show how to estimate\nsome of the additional parameters that enter into this heterogeneous decay\nrate. This formalism is then applied to the Higgs vacuum of the Standard Model\n(SM), where baryonic matter acts as an impurity in the electroweak Higgs\nvacuum. We find that the probability for heterogeneous vacuum decay to occur is\nsuppressed with respect to the homogeneous case. That is to say, the\nconclusions drawn from the homogeneous case are not modified by the inclusion\nof baryonic matter in the calculation. On the other hand, we show that Beyond\nthe Standard Model physics with a characteristic scale comparable to the scale\nthat governs the homogeneous decay rate in the SM, can in principle lead to an\nenhanced decay rate.\n", "  The ability to characterize static and time-dependent electric fields in situ\nis an important prerequisite for quantum-optics experiments with atoms close to\nsurfaces. Especially in experiments which aim at coupling Rydberg atoms to the\nnear field of superconducting circuits, the identification and subsequent\nelimination of sources of stray fields is crucial. We present a technique that\nallows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions\n$(F^\\text{str}_\\text{x}(\\vec{r}),F^\\text{str}_\\text{y}(\\vec{r}),F^\\text{str}_\\text{z}(\\vec{r}))$\nat distances of less than $2~\\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using\ncoherent Rydberg-Stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable\n$1\\text{s}^12\\text{s}^1~{}^{1}S_{0}$ helium atoms. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field\nemanating from a structured superconducting surface. Exploiting coherent\npopulation transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the\nsame technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution\nabove the surface.\n", "  The production of the $f_1(1285)$ resonance in the reaction of $K^- p \\to\nf_1(1285) \\Lambda$ is studied within an effective Lagrangian approach. The\nproduction process is described by the $t$ channel $K^{*+}$ meson exchange. My\ntheoretical approach is based on the results of chiral unitary theory where the\n$f_1(1285)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the single channel $\\bar{K}\nK^* - c.c.$ interaction. The total and differential cross sections of the $K^-\np \\to f_1(1285) \\Lambda$ reaction are evaluated. Within the coupling constant\nof the $f_1(1285)$ to $\\bar{K}K^*$ channel obtained from the chiral unitary\ntheory and a cut off parameter $\\Lambda_c \\sim 1.5$ GeV in the form factors,\nthe experimental measurement can be reproduced. This production process would\nprovide further evidence for the $\\bar{K} K^* - c.c.$ nature of the $f_1(1285)$\nstate.\n", "  DNA G-hairpins are potential key structures participating in folding of human\ntelomeric guanine quadruplexes (GQ). We examined their properties by standard\nMD simulations starting from the folded state and long T-REMD starting from the\nunfolded state, accumulating ~130 {\\mu}s of atomistic simulations. Antiparallel\nG-hairpins should spontaneously form in all stages of the folding to support\nlateral and diagonal loops, with sub-{\\mu}s scale rearrangements between them.\nWe found no clear predisposition for direct folding into specific GQ topologies\nwith specific syn/anti patterns. Our key prediction stemming from the T-REMD is\nthat an ideal unfolded ensemble of the full GQ sequence populates all 4096\nsyn/anti combinations of its four G-stretches. The simulations can propose\nidealized folding pathways but we explain that such few-state pathways may be\nmisleading. In the context of the available experimental data, the simulations\nstrongly suggest that the GQ folding could be best understood by the kinetic\npartitioning mechanism with a set of deep competing minima on the folding\nlandscape, with only a small fraction of molecules directly folding to the\nnative fold. The landscape should further include nonspecific collapse\nprocesses where the molecules move via diffusion and consecutive random rare\ntransitions, which could, e.g., structure the propeller loops.\n", "  We study properties of moving relativistic quantum unstable systems. We show\nthat in contrast to the properties of classical particles and quantum stable\nobjects the velocity of moving freely relativistic quantum unstable systems can\nnot be constant in time. We show that this new quantum effect results from the\nfundamental principles of the quantum theory and physics: It is a consequence\nof the principle of conservation of energy and of the fact that the mass of the\nquantum unstable system is not defined. This effect can affect the form of the\ndecay law of moving relativistic quantum unstable systems.\n", "  We study the chiral separation and chiral magnetic effects in a slab of Dirac\nsemimetal of finite thickness, placed in a constant magnetic field\nperpendicular to its surfaces. We utilize the Bogolyubov boundary conditions\nwith a large Dirac mass (band gap) outside the slab. We find that, in a finite\nthickness slab, the axial current density is induced by helicity-correlated\nstanding waves and, as a consequence, is quantized. The quantization is seen in\nits stepped-shape dependence on the fermion chemical potential and a\nsawtooth-shape dependence on the thickness of the slab. In contrast to a naive\nexpectation, there is no chiral charge accumulation anywhere in the bulk or at\nthe boundaries of the semimetal. In the same slab geometry, we also find that a\nnonzero chiral chemical potential induces no electric current, as might have\nbeen expected from the chiral magnetic effect. We argue that this outcome is\nnatural and points to the truly non-static nature of the latter. By taking into\naccount a nonzero electric field of a double layer near the boundaries of the\nslab, we find that the low-energy modes under consideration satisfy the\ncontinuity equation for axial current density without the anomalous term.\n", "  We present a method for synthesizing large area epitaxial single-layer\nMoS$_2$ on the Au(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum. Using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and low energy electron diffraction, the evolution of the growth is\nfollowed from nanoscale single-layer MoS$_2$ islands to a continuous MoS$_2$\nlayer. An exceptionally good control over the MoS$_2$ coverage is maintained\nusing an approach based on cycles of Mo evaporation and sulfurization to first\nnucleate the MoS$_2$ nano-islands and then gradually increase their size.\nDuring this growth process the native herringbone reconstruction of Au(111) is\nlifted as shown by low energy electron diffraction measurements. Within these\nMoS$_2$ islands, we identify domains rotated by 60$^{\\circ}$ that lead to\natomically sharp line defects at domain boundaries. As the MoS$_2$ coverage\napproaches the limit of a complete single-layer, the formation of bilayer\nMoS$_2$ islands is initiated. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurements of both single and bilayer MoS$_2$ samples show a dramatic change\nin their band structure around the center of the Brillouin zone. Brief exposure\nto air after removing the MoS$_2$ layer from vacuum is not found to affect its\nquality.\n", "  We report neutron inelastic scattering experiments on single crystal\nPbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_{3}$ doped with 32\\% PbTiO$_{3}$, a relaxor\nferroelectric that lies close to the morphotropic phase boundary. When cooled\nunder an electric field $\\mathbf{E} \\parallel$ [001] into tetragonal and\nmonoclinic phases, the scattering cross section from transverse acoustic (TA)\nphonons polarized parallel to $\\mathbf{E}$ weakens and shifts to higher energy\nrelative to that under zero-field-cooled conditions. Likewise, the scattering\ncross section from transverse optic (TO) phonons polarized parallel to\n$\\mathbf{E}$ weakens for energy transfers $4 \\leq \\hbar \\omega \\leq 9$ meV.\nHowever, TA and TO phonons polarized perpendicular to $\\mathbf{E}$ show no\nchange. This anisotropic field response is similar to that of the diffuse\nscattering cross section, which, as previously reported, is suppressed when\npolarized parallel to $\\mathbf{E}$, but not when polarized perpendicular to\n$\\mathbf{E}$. Our findings suggest that the lattice dynamics and dynamic\nshort-range polar correlations that give rise to the diffuse scattering are\ncoupled.\n", "  Genetic oscillators, such as circadian clocks, are constantly perturbed by\nmolecular noise arising from the small number of molecules involved in gene\nregulation. One of the strongest sources of stochasticity is the binary noise\nthat arises from the binding of a regulatory protein to a promoter in the\nchromosomal DNA. In this study, we focus on two minimal oscillators based on\nactivator titration and repressor titration to understand the key parameters\nthat are important for oscillations and for overcoming binary noise. We show\nthat the rate of unbinding from the DNA, despite traditionally being considered\na fast parameter, needs to be slow to broaden the space of oscillatory\nsolutions. The addition of multiple, independent DNA binding sites further\nexpands the oscillatory parameter space for the repressor-titration oscillator\nand lengthens the period of both oscillators. This effect is a combination of\nincreased effective delay of the unbinding kinetics due to multiple binding\nsites and increased promoter ultrasensitivity that is specific for repression.\nWe then use stochastic simulation to show that multiple binding sites increase\nthe coherence of the oscillations by mitigating the binary noise. Slow values\nof DNA unbinding rate are also effective in alleviating molecular noise due to\nthe increased distance from the bifurcation point. Our work demonstrates how\nDNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics, which are often omitted in\nbiophysical models of gene circuits, can have a significant impact on the\ntemporal and stochastic dynamics of genetic oscillators.\n", "  Warm inflation includes inflaton interactions with other fields throughout\nthe inflationary epoch instead of confining such interactions to a distinct\nreheating era. Previous investigations have shown that, when certain\nconstraints on the dynamics of these interactions and the resultant radiation\nbath are satisfied, a low-momentum-dominated dissipation coefficient $\\propto\nT^3/m_\\chi^2$ can sustain an era of inflation compatible with CMB observations.\nIn this work, we extend these analyses by including the pole-dominated\ndissipation term $\\propto \\sqrt{m_\\chi T} \\exp(-m_\\chi/T)$. We find that, with\nthis enhanced dissipation, certain models, notably the quadratic hilltop\npotential, perform significantly better. Specifically, we can achieve 50\ne-folds of inflation and a spectral index compatible with Planck data while\nrequiring fewer mediator field ($O(10^4)$ for the quadratic hilltop potential)\nand smaller coupling constants, opening up interesting model-building\npossibilities. We also highlight the significance of the specific parametric\ndependence of the dissipative coefficient which could prove useful in even\ngreater reduction in field content.\n", "  The hierarchy of fermion masses in the standard model may arise via the\nbreaking of discrete gauge symmetries. The renormalizable interactions of the\nflavor-symmetry-breaking potential can have accidental global symmetries that\nare spontaneously broken, leading to pseudo-goldstone bosons that may drive\ninflation. We consider two-field, axion-monodromy inflation models in which the\ninflaton is identified with a linear combination of pseudo-goldstone bosons of\nthe flavor sector. We show that the resulting models are nontrivially\nconstrained by current cosmological data as well as the requirements of viable\nflavor model building.\n", "  We present an analysis of the polymorphic energy ordering and properties of\nthe rock salt and zincblende structures of manganese oxide using fixed node\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Manganese oxide is a correlated, antiferromagnetic\nmaterial that has proven to be challenging to model from first principles\nacross a variety of approaches. Unlike conventional density functional theory\nand some hybrid functionals, fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo finds the rock\nsalt structure to be more stable than the zincblende structure, and thus\nrecovers the correct energy ordering. Analysis of the site-resolved charge\nfluctuations of the wave functions according to DMC and other electronic\nstructure descriptions give insights into elements that are missing in other\ntheories. While the calculated band gaps within DMC are in agreement with\npredictions that the zincblende polymorph has a lower band gap, the gaps\nthemselves overestimate reported experimental values.\n", "  Despite the importance of isotopically purified samples in current\nexperiments, there have been few corresponding studies of spin qubit\ndecoherence using full quantum bath calculations. Isotopic purification\neliminates the well-studied nuclear spin baths which usually dominate\ndecoherence. We model the coherence of electronic spin qubits in silicon near\nso called Clock Transitions (CT) where experiments have electronic $T_{2e}$\ntimes of seconds. Despite the apparent simplicity of the residual decoherence\nmechanism, this regime is not well understood: the state mixing which underpins\nCTs allows also a proliferation of contributions from usually forbidden\nchannels (direct flip-flops with non-resonant spins); in addition, the\nmagnitude and effects of the corresponding Overhauser fields and other\ndetunings is not well quantified. For purely magnetic detunings, we identify a\nregime, potentially favourable for quantum computing, where forbidden channels\nare completely suppressed but spins in resonant states are fully released from\nOverhauser fields and applied magnetic field gradients. We show by a general\nargument that the enhancement between this regime and the high field limit is\n$< 8$, regardless of density, while enhancements of order 50 are measured\nexperimentally. We propose that this discrepancy is likely to arise from\nstrains of exclusively non-magnetic origin, underlining the potential of CTs\nfor isolating and probing different types of inhomogeneities. We also identify\na set of fields, \"Dipolar Refocusing Points\" (DRPs), where the Hahn echo fully\nrefocuses the effect of the dipolar interaction.\n", "  Measuring environment for large numbers of distant galaxies is still an open\nproblem, for which we need galaxy positions and redshifts. Photometric\nredshifts are more easily available for large numbers of galaxies, but at the\nprice of larger uncertainties than spectroscopic ones. In this work we study\nhow photometric redshifts affect the measurement of galaxy environment and how\nthis may limit an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) in\ndifferent environments. Using mock galaxy catalogues, we measured the\nenvironment with a fixed aperture method, using each galaxy's true and\nphotometric redshifts. We varied the fixed aperture volume parameters and the\nphotometric redshift uncertainties. We then computed GSMF as a function of\nredshift and environment. We found that only when using high-precision\nphotometric redshifts with $\\sigma_{\\Delta z/(1+z)} \\le 0.01$, the most extreme\nenvironments can be reconstructed in a fairly accurate way, with a fraction\n$\\ge 60\\div 80\\%$ of galaxies placed in the correct density quartile and a\ncontamination of $\\le 10\\%$ by opposite quartile interlopers. A volume height\ncomparable to the $\\pm 1.5\\sigma$ error of photometric redshifts grants a\nbetter reconstruction than other volume configurations. When using such an\nenvironmental measure, we found that any differences between the starting GSMF\n(divided accordingly to the true galaxy environment) will be damped on average\nof $\\sim 0.3$ dex when using photometric redshifts, but will be still\nresolvable. These results may be used to interpret real data as we obtained\nthem in a way that is fairly independent from how well the mock catalogues\nreproduce the real galaxy distribution. This work represents a preparatory\nstudy for future wide area photometric redshift surveys such as the Euclid\nSurvey and we plan to apply these results to an analysis of the GSMF in the\nUltraVISTA Survey in future work.\n", "  Hybrid pixel detectors have been invented for the LHC to make tracking and\nvertexing possible at all in LHC's radiation intense environment. The LHC pixel\ndetectors have meanwhile very successfully fulfilled their promises and R\\&D\nfor the planned HL-LHC upgrade is in full swing, targeting even higher ionising\ndoses and non-ionising fluences. In terms of rate and radiation tolerance\nhybrid pixels are unrivaled. But they have disadvantages as well, most notably\nmaterial thickness, production complexity, and cost. Meanwhile also active\npixel sensors (DEPFET, MAPS) have become real pixel detectors but they would by\nfar not stand the rates and radiation faced from HL-LHC. New MAPS developments,\nso-called DMAPS (depleted MAPS) which are full CMOS-pixel structures with\ncharge collection in a depleted region have come in the R\\&D focus for pixels\nat high rate/radiation levels. This goal can perhaps be realised exploiting HV\ntechnologies, high ohmic substrates and/or SOI based technologies. The paper\ncovers the main ideas and some encouraging results from prototyping R\\&D, not\nhiding the difficulties.\n", "  We study the space of Killing fields on the four dimensional AdS spacetime\n$AdS^{3,1}$. Two subsets $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ are identified:\n$\\mathcal{S}$ (the spinor Killing fields) is constructed from imaginary Killing\nspinors, and $\\mathcal{O}$ (the observer Killing fields) consists of all\nhypersurface orthogonal, future timelike unit Killing fields. When the\ncosmology constant vanishes, or in the Minkowski spacetime case, these two\nsubsets have the same convex hull in the space of Killing fields. In presence\nof the cosmology constant, the convex hull of $ \\mathcal{O}$ is properly\ncontained in that of $\\mathcal{S}$. This leads to two different notions of\nenergy for an asymptotically AdS spacetime, the spinor energy and the observer\nenergy. In [10], Chru\\'sciel, Maerten and Tod proved the positivity of the\nspinor energy and derived important consequences among the related conserved\nquantities. We show that the positivity of the observer energy follows from the\npositivity of the spinor energy. A new notion called the \"rest mass\" of an\nasymptotically AdS spacetime is then defined by minimizing the observer energy,\nand is shown to be evaluated in terms of the adjoint representation of the Lie\nalgebra of Killing fields. It is proved that the rest mass has the desirable\nrigidity property that characterizes the AdS spacetime.\n", "  We study the electronic and transport properties of a topological insulator\nnanowire including selective magnetic doping of its surfaces. We use a model\nwhich is appropriate to describe materials like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ within a k.p\napproximation and consider nanowires with a rectangular geometry. Within this\nmodel the magnetic doping at the (111) surfaces induces a Zeeman field which\nopens a gap at the Dirac cones corresponding to the surface states. For\nobtaining the transport properties in a two terminal configuration we use a\nrecursive Green function method based on a tight-binding model which is\nobtained by discretizing the original continuous model. For the case of uniform\nmagnetization of two opposite nanowire (111) surfaces we show that the\nconductance can switch from a quantized value of $e^2/h$ (when the\nmagnetizations are equal) to a very small value (when they are opposite). We\nalso analyze the case of non-uniform magnetizations in which the Zeeman field\non the two opposite surfaces change sign at the middle of the wire. For this\ncase we find that conduction by resonant tunneling through a chiral state bound\nat the middle of the wire is possible. The resonant level position can be tuned\nby imposing an Aharonov-Bohm flux through the nanowire cross section.\n", "  Using 2.92~fb$^{-1}$ of electron-positron annihilation data collected at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 3.773$~GeV with the BESIII detector, we obtain the first\nmeasurements of the absolute branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(D^+ \\to K^0_L e^+\n\\nu_e) = (4.481 \\pm 0.027(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.103(\\mathrm{sys.}))\\%$ and the\n$CP$ asymmetry $A_{CP}^{D^+ \\to K^0_L e^+ \\nu_e} = (-0.59 \\pm\n0.60(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 1.48(\\mathrm{sys.}))\\%$. From the $D^+ \\to K^0_L e^+\n\\nu_e$ differential decay rate distribution, the product of the hadronic form\nfactor and the magnitude of the CKM matrix element, $f_{+}^{K}(0)|V_{cs}|$, is\ndetermined to be $0.728 \\pm 0.006(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.011(\\mathrm{sys.})$.\nUsing $|V_{cs}|$ from the SM constrained fit with the measured\n$f_{+}^{K}(0)|V_{cs}|$, $f_{+}^{K}(0) = 0.748 \\pm 0.007(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.012(\\mathrm{sys.})$ is obtained, and utilizing the unquenched LQCD\ncalculation for $f_{+}^{K}(0)$, $|V_{cs}| = 0.975 \\pm 0.008(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.015(\\mathrm{sys.}) \\pm 0.025(\\mathrm{LQCD})$.\n", "  Sigma-phase Fe65.9V34.1 alloy was investigated with the M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy. M\\\"ossbauer spectra were recorded in the temperature interval of\n80-300 K. Their analysis in terms of the hyperfine distribution protocol\nyielded the average hyperfine field, <B>, the average center shift, <CS>, and\nthe spectral area, A. The magnetic ordering temperature, T_C=312.5(5) K was\ndetermined from the temperature dependence of <B>, and the Debye temperature,\nT_D, from the temperature dependence of <CS> and the relative spectral area.\nThe value obtained from the former was 403(17) K and that from the latter\n374(2) K. The value of the force constant was determined. The lattice dynamics\nof Fe atoms was described in terms of the kinetic, E_k, and the potential\nenergy, E_p.\n", "  Two-dimensional networks of ordered quantum dots beyond the percolation\nthreshold are studied, as typical example of conducting nanostructures with\nquenched random disorder. Theory predicts anomalous diffusion with\nstretched-exponential relaxation at short distances, and computer simulations\non lattices of crossing, straight paths of random length confirm such a\nbehavior. Anomalous diffusion is interpreted as resulting from the higher\nprobability of taking straight, or ballistic paths, when the traveled distance\nis comparable or shorter than the lattice characteristic length. Diffusion\nturns over to normal for longer traveled distances, whence all paths tend to\nbecome equiprobable. Such random lattice structures represent a model for\nrealistic quantum dot networks, with potential applications in optoelectronics,\nphotovoltaics or spintronics.\n", "  Single- and double- heavy baryons are studied in the constituent quark model.\nThe model Hamiltonian is chosen as a standard one with two exceptions : (1) The\ncolor-Coulomb term depend on quark masses, and (2) an antisymmetric $LS$ force\nis introduced. Model parameters are fixed by the strange baryon spectra,\n$\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ baryons. The masses of the observed charmed and bottomed\nbaryons are, then, fairly well reproduced. Our focus is on the low-lying\nnegative-parity states, in which the heavy baryons show specific excitation\nmodes reflecting the mass differences of heavy and light quarks. By changing\nquark masses from the SU(3) limit to the strange quark mass, further to the\ncharm and bottom quark masses, we demonstrate that the spectra change from the\nSU(3) symmetry patterns to the heavy quark symmetry ones.\n", "  We analyse the dynamical properties of three-dimensional solitary waves in\ncylindrically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Families of solitary waves\nbifurcate from the planar dark soliton and include the solitonic vortex, the\nvortex ring and more complex structures of intersecting vortex-line known\ncollectively as Chladni solitons. The particle-like dynamics of these guided\nsolitary waves provides potentially profitable features for their\nimplementation in atomtronic circuits, and play a key role in the generation of\nmetastable loop currents. Based on the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nwe calculate the dispersion relations of moving solitary waves and their modes\nof dynamical instability. The dispersion relations reveal a complex crossing\nand bifurcation scenario. For stationary structures we find that for\n$\\mu/\\hbar\\omega_\\perp > 2.65$ the solitonic vortex is the only stable solitary\nwave. More complex Chladni solitons still have weaker instabilities than planar\ndark solitons and may be seen as transient structures in experiments. Fully\ntime-dependent simulations illustrate typical decay scenarios, which may result\nin the generation of multiple separated solitonic vortices.\n", "  A new Lagrangian framework has recently been proposed to describe\ninteractions between relativistic perfect fluids and scalar fields. In this\npaper we investigate the Einstein static universe in this new class of\ntheories, which have been named Scalar-Fluid theories. The stability of the\nstatic solutions to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations is\nanalysed deriving the relevant cosmological perturbation equations at the\nlinear order. We can find several configurations corresponding to an Einstein\nstatic universes which are stable against inhomogeneous perturbations, but\nunstable against homogeneous perturbations. This shows the possible\napplications of Scalar-Fluid theories to the inflationary emergent universe\nscenario.\n", "  The equations of motion of a single particle subject to an arbitrary electric\nand a static magnetic field form a Poisson system. We present a second-order\ntime integration method which preserves well the Poisson structure and compare\nit to commonly used algorithms, such as the Boris scheme. All the methods are\nrepresented in a general framework of splitting methods. We use the so-called\n$\\phi$ functions, which give efficient ways for both analyzing and implementing\nthe algorithms. Numerical experiments show an excellent long term stability for\nthe new method considered.\n", "  It is shown that the Weyl semimetal TaAs can have a significant polar vector\ncontribution to its optical activity. This is quantified by ab initio\ncalculations of the resonant x-ray diffraction at the Ta L1 edge. For the Bragg\nvector (400), this polar vector contribution to the circular intensity\ndifferential between left and right polarized x-rays is predicted to be\ncomparable to that arising from linear dichroism. Implications this result has\nin regards to optical effects predicted for topological Weyl semimetals are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate experimentally and theoretically the interference at avoided\ncrossings which are repeatedly traversed as a consequence of an applied ac\nfield. Our model system is a charge qubit in a serial double quantum dot\nconnected to two leads. Our focus lies on effects caused by simultaneous\ndriving with two different frequencies. We work out how the commensurability of\nthe driving frequencies affects the symmetry of the interference patterns both\nin real space and in Fourier space. For commensurable frequencies, the symmetry\ndepends sensitively on the relative phase between the two modes, whereas for\nincommensurable frequencies the symmetry of monochromatic driving is always\nrecovered.\n", "  We describe how to efficiently construct the quantum chemical Hamiltonian\noperator in matrix product form. We present its implementation as a density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for quantum chemical applications\nin a purely matrix product based framework. Existing implementations of DMRG\nfor quantum chemistry are based on the traditional formulation of the method,\nwhich was developed from a viewpoint of Hilbert space decimation and attained a\nhigher performance compared to straightforward implementations of matrix\nproduct based DMRG. The latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states\nknown as matrix product states (MPS), where operators are correspondingly\nrepresented as matrix product operators (MPO). The MPO construction scheme\npresented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while\nretaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach; for\nexample, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. In\nthis way, MPOs for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and\ndifferent relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an\notherwise unmodified program.\n", "  A nonminimally coupled quintessence dark energy in teleparallel model of\ngravity is considered. It is clarified how a matter dominated universe with\ninitial negligible dark energy density can evolve to a late time de Sitter\nspace-time via the $Z_2$ symmetry breaking.\n", "  The H3+ molecule has been detected in many lines of sight within the central\nmolecular zone (CMZ) with exceptionally large column densities and unusual\nexcitation properties compared to diffuse local clouds. The detection of the\n(3,3) metastable level has been suggested to be the signature of warm and\ndiffuse gas in the CMZ. We use the Meudon PDR code to re-examine the\nrelationship between the column density of H3+ and the cosmic-ray ionization\nrate, $\\zeta$, up to large values of $\\zeta$. We study the impact of the\nvarious mechanisms that can excite H3+ in its metastable state. We produce\ngrids of PDR models exploring different parameters ($\\zeta$, size of clouds,\nmetallicity) and infer the physical conditions that best match the observations\ntoward ten lines of sight in the CMZ. For one of them, Herschel observations of\nHF, OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ can be used as additional constraints. We check that\nthe results found for H3+ also account for the observations of these molecules.\nWe find that the linear relationship between N(H3+) and $\\zeta$ only holds up\nto a certain value of the cosmic-ray ionization rate, which depends on the\nproton density. A value $\\zeta \\sim 1 - 11 \\times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ explains\nboth the large observed H3+ column density and its excitation in the metastable\nlevel (3,3) in the CMZ. It also reproduces N(OH+), N(H2O+) and N(H3O+) detected\ntoward Sgr B2(N). We confirm that the CMZ probed by H3+ is diffuse, nH\n$\\lesssim$ 100 cm-3 and warm, T $\\sim$ 212-505 K. This warm medium is due to\ncosmic-ray heating. We also find that the diffuse component probed by H3+ must\nfill a large fraction of the CMZ. Finally, we suggest the warm gas in the CMZ\nenables efficient H2 formation via chemisorption sites as in PDRs. This\ncontributes to enhance the abundance of H3+ in this high cosmic-ray flux\nenvironment.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the dynamical spin susceptibility for the\nintriguing Fe-based superconductor FeSe, based on a tight-binding model\ndeveloped to account for the temperature-dependent band structure in this\nsystem. The model allows for orbital ordering in the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ channel\nbelow the structural transition and presents a strongly $C_4$ symmetry broken\nFermi surface at low temperatures which accounts for the nematic properties of\nthis material. The calculated spin excitations are peaked at wave vector\n$(\\pi,0)$ in the 1-Fe Brillouin zone, with a broad maximum at energies of order\na few meV. In this range, the occurrence of superconductivity sharpens this\npeak in energy, creating a $(\\pi,0)$ \"neutron resonance\" as seen in recent\nexperiments. With the exception of the quite low energy scale of these\nfluctuations, these results are roughly similar to standard behavior in Fe\npnictide systems. At higher energies, however, intensity increases and shifts\nto wave vectors along the $(\\pi,0)$ - $(\\pi,\\pi)$ line. We compare with\nexisting inelastic neutron experiments and NMR data, and give predictions for\nfurther studies.\n", "  Markov processes restarted or reset at random times to a fixed state or\nregion in space have been actively studied recently in connection with random\nsearches, foraging, and population dynamics. Here we study the large deviations\nof time-additive functions or observables of Markov processes with resetting.\nBy deriving a renewal formula linking generating functions with and without\nresetting we are able to obtain the rate function of such observables,\ncharacterizing the likelihood of their fluctuations in the long-time limit. We\nconsider as an illustration the large deviations of the area of the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process with resetting. Other applications involving\ndiffusions, random walks, and jump processes with resetting or catastrophes are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study non-isothermal diffusion transport of a weakly-soluble substance in\na liquid-saturated porous medium being in contact with the reservoir of this\nsubstance. The surface temperature of the porous medium half-space oscillates\nin time, which results in a decaying solubility wave propagating deep into the\nporous medium. In such a system, the zones of saturated solution and\nnon-dissolved phase coexist with the zones of undersaturated solution. The\neffect is firstly considered for the case of annual oscillation of the surface\ntemperature of water-saturated ground being in contact with atmosphere. We\nreveal the phenomenon of formation of a near-surface bubbly horizon due to the\ntemperature oscillation. An analytical theory of the phenomenon is developed.\nFurther, the treatment is extended to the case of higher frequency oscillations\nand case of weakly-soluble solids and liquids.\n", "  We propagate the statistical uncertainty of experimental NN scattering data\ninto the binding energy of $^3$H and $^4$He. We also study the sensitivity of\nthe magnetic moment and proton radius of the $^3$H to changes in the NN\ninteraction. The calculations are made with the no-core full configuration\nmethod in a sufficiently large harmonic oscillator basis. For those light\nnuclei we obtain $\\Delta E$($^3$H) = 0.015 MeV and $\\Delta E$($^4$He) = 0.055\nMeV.\n", "  There is an increasing reliance on mathematical modelling to assist in the\ndesign of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers since this provides a\ncost-effective and quick way to arrive at a first prototype. Given a desired\noperating envelope for the sensor the inverse problem of obtaining the\nassociated design parameters within the model can be considered. It is\ntherefore of practical interest to examine the well-posedness of such models.\nThere is a need to extend the use of such sensors into high temperature\nenvironments and so this paper shows, for a broad class of models, the\nwell-posedness of the magneto-electro-thermo-elastic problem. Due to its\nwidespread use in the literature, we also show the well-posedness of the\nquasi-electrostatic case\n", "  The effective potential for the two-replica system of the random energy model\nis exactly derived. It is an analytic function of the magnetizations of two\nreplicas, $\\varphi^1$ and $\\varphi^2$ in the high-temperature phase. In the\nlow-temperature phase, where the replica symmetry breaking takes place, the\neffective potential becomes non-analytic when $\\varphi^1=\\varphi^2$. The\nnon-analyticity is considered as a consequence of the condensation of the\nBoltzmann measure, which is a typical property of a glass phase.\n", "  Using general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, we show that merging\nbinary neutron stars can form hypermassive neutrons stars that undergo the\none-arm spiral instability. We study the particular case of a dynamical capture\nmerger where the stars have a small spin, as may arise in globular clusters,\nand focus on an equal-mass scenario where the spins are aligned with the\norbital angular momentum. We find that this instability develops when\npost-merger fluid vortices lead to the generation of a toroidal remnant - a\nconfiguration whose maximum density occurs in a ring around the center-of-mass\n- with high vorticity along its rotation axis. The instability quickly\nsaturates on a timescale of $\\sim 10$ ms, with the $m=1$ azimuthal density\nmultipole mode dominating over higher modes. The instability also leaves a\ncharacteristic imprint on the post-merger gravitational wave signal that could\nbe detectable if the instability persists in long-lived remnants.\n", "  We present a general classification of simplified models that lead to dark\nmatter (DM) coannihilation processes of the form DM + X $\\rightarrow$ SM$_1$ +\nSM$_2$, where X is a coannihilation partner for the DM particle and SM$_1$,\nSM$_2$ are Standard Model fields. Our classification also encompasses regular\nDM pair annihilation scenarios if DM and X are identical. Each coannhilation\nscenario motivates the introduction of a mediating particle M that can either\nbelong to the Standard Model or be a new field, whereby the resulting\ninteractions between the dark sector and the Standard Model are realized as\ntree-level and dimension-four couplings. We construct a basis of coannihilation\nmodels, classified by the $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ quantum numbers\nof DM, X and M. Our main assumptions are that dark matter is an electrically\nneutral color singlet and that all new particles are either scalars, Dirac or\nMajorana fermions, or vectors. We illustrate how new scenarios arising from\nelectroweak symmetry breaking effects can be connected to our electroweak\nsymmetric simplified models. We offer a comprehensive discussion of the\nphenomenological features of our models, encompassing the physics of thermal\nfreeze-out, direct and indirect detection constraints, and in particular\nsearches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Many novel signatures that are not\ncovered in current LHC searches are emphasized, and new and improved LHC\nanalyses tackling these signatures are proposed. We discuss how the\ncoannihilation simplified models can be used to connect results from all\nclasses of experiments in a straightforward and transparent way. This point is\nillustrated with a detailed discussion of the phenomenology of a particular\nsimplified model featuring leptoquark-mediated dark matter coannihilation.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum spectra of J/psi and Upsilon mesons by using\ntwo methods: the two-component Erlang distribution and the two-component\nSchwinger mechanism. The results obtained by the two methods are compared and\nfound to be in agreement with the experimental data of proton-proton (pp),\nproton-lead (p-Pb), and lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions measured by the LHCb and\nALICE Collaborations at the large hadron collider (LHC). The related parameters\nsuch as the mean transverse momentum contributed by each parton in the first\n(second) component in the two-component Erlang distribution and the string\ntension between two partons in the first (second) component in the\ntwo-component Schwinger mechanism are extracted.\n", "  We present a systematic study of galaxy biasing in the presence of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. For a large class of non-Gaussian initial conditions, we\ndefine a general bias expansion and prove that it is closed under\nrenormalization, thereby showing that the basis of operators in the expansion\nis complete. We then study the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity on the\nstatistics of galaxies. We show that the equivalence principle enforces a\nrelation between the scale-dependent bias in the galaxy power spectrum and that\nin the dipolar part of the bispectrum. This provides a powerful consistency\ncheck to confirm the primordial origin of any observed scale-dependent bias.\nFinally, we also discuss the imprints of anisotropic non-Gaussianity as\nmotivated by recent studies of higher-spin fields during inflation.\n", "  We give a covariant construction of Lagrangians for spinor fields in generic\nNewton-Cartan backgrounds. A non-relativistic Dirac/Levy-Leblond operator and\nthe associated fields are obtained from relativistic analogues by a limiting\nprocedure. The relativistic symmetries induce the complete set of\nnon-relativistic symmetries, including Milne boosts and local Galilean\ntransformations. The resulting Levy-Leblond operator includes non-minimal\ncouplings to the Newton-Cartan structure as well as to the gauge field, and\nwith these couplings it transforms covariantly. Phenomenologically, this fixes\nthe gyromagnetic ratio to g=1. Three-dimensional spacetimes are an exception:\ngeneric g is possible but results in modified Milne transformations, which -\nupon gauge fixing - reproduces the anomalous diffeomorphisms found in earlier\napproaches.\n", "  The smallest dark matter haloes are the first objects to form in the\nhierarchical structure formation of cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology and are\nexpected to be the densest and most fundamental building blocks of CDM\nstructures in our universe. Nevertheless, the physical characteristics of these\nhaloes have stayed illusive, as they remain well beyond the current resolution\nof N-body simulations (at redshift zero). However, they dominate the\npredictions (and uncertainty) in expected dark matter annihilation signal,\namongst other astrophysical observables. Using the conservation of total energy\nand the ellipsoidal collapse framework, we can analytically find the mean and\nscatter of concentration $c$ and 1-D velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm 1d}$ for\nhaloes of different virial mass $M_{200}$. Both $c$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm\n1d}/M_{200}^{1/3}$ are in good agreement with numerical results within the\nregime probed by simulations -- slowly decreasing functions of mass that\napproach constant values at large masses. In particular, the predictions for\nthe 1-D velocity dispersion of cluster mass haloes are surprisingly robust as\nthe inverse heat capacity of cosmological haloes crosses zero at $M_{200} \\sim\n10^{14} M_\\odot$. However, we find that current extrapolations from simulations\nto smallest CDM haloes dramatically depend on the assumed profile (e.g. NFW vs.\nEinasto) and fitting function, which is why theoretical considerations, such as\nthe one presented here, can significantly constrain the range of feasible\npredictions.\n", "  The ordered magnetic field observed via polarized synchrotron emission in\nnearby disc galaxies can be explained by a mean-field dynamo operating in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, vertical-flux initial\nconditions are potentially able to influence this dynamo via the occurrence of\nthe magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We aim to study the influence of\nvarious initial field configurations on the saturated state of the mean-field\ndynamo. This is motivated by the observation that different saturation behavior\nwas previously obtained for different supernova rates. We perform direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of three-dimensional local boxes of the vertically\nstratified, turbulent interstellar medium, employing shearing-periodic boundary\nconditions horizontally. Unlike in our previous work, we also impose a vertical\nseed magnetic field. We run the simulations until the growth of the magnetic\nenergy becomes negligible. We furthermore perform simulations of equivalent 1D\ndynamo models, with an algebraic quenching mechanism for the dynamo\ncoefficients. We compare the saturation of the magnetic field in the DNS with\nthe algebraic quenching of a mean-field dynamo. The final magnetic field\nstrength found in the direct simulation is in excellent agreement with a\nquenched $\\alpha\\Omega$~dynamo. For supernova rates representative of the Milky\nWay, field losses via a Galactic wind are likely responsible for saturation. We\nconclude that the relative strength of the turbulent and regular magnetic\nfields in spiral galaxies may depend on the galaxy's star formation rate. We\npropose that a mean field approach with algebraic quenching may serve as a\nsimple sub-grid scale model for galaxy evolution simulations including a\nprescribed feedback from magnetic fields.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of seven young stars observed with the\nspectrograph SOPHIE at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence for which the\nchemical composition was incomplete or absent in the literature. For five\nstars, we derived the stellar parameters and chemical compositions using our\nautomatic pipeline optimized for F, G, and K stars, while for the other two\nstars with high rotational velocity, we derived the stellar parameters by using\nother information (parallax), and performed a line-by-line analysis.\nChromospheric emission-line fluxes from CaII are obtained for all targets. The\nstellar parameters we derive are generally in good agreement with what is\navailable in the literature. We provide a chemical analysis of two of the stars\nfor the first time. The star HIP 80124 shows a strong Li feature at 670.8 nm\nimplying a high lithium abundance. Its chemical pattern is not consistent with\nit being a solar sibling, as has been suggested.\n", "  In this work we study a general vector-tensor model of dark energy with a\nGauss-Bonnet term coupled to a vector field and without explicit potential\nterms. Considering a spatially flat FRW type universe and a vector field\nwithout spatial components, the cosmological evolution is analysed from the\nfield equations of this model, considering two sets of parameters. In this\ncontext, we have shown that it is possible to obtain an accelerated expansion\nphase of the universe, since the equation state parameter $w$ satisfies the\nrestriction $-1<w<-1/3$ (for suitable values of model parameters). Further,\nanalytical expressions for the Hubble parameter $H$, equation state parameter\n$w$ and the invariant scalar $\\phi$ are obtained. We also find that the square\nof the speed of sound is negative for all values of redshift, therefore, the\nmodel presented here shows a sign of instability under small perturbations. We\nfinally perform an analysis using $H(z)$ observational data and we find that\nfor the free parameter $\\xi$ in the interval $(-23.9, -3.46)\\times 10^{-5}$, at\n$99.73\\%$ C.L. (and fixing $\\eta = -1$ and $\\omega = 1/4$), the model has a\ngood fit to the data.\n", "  We study the energy representation of conformal quantum mechanics as the\nWhittaker vector without specifying classical Lagrangian. We show that a\ngenerating function of expectation values among two excited states of the\ndilatation operator in conformal quantum mechanics is a solution to the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation and it corresponds to the AdS2 partition function\nevaluated as the minisuperspace wave function in Liouville field theory. We\nalso show that the dilatation expectation values in conformal quantum mechanics\nlead to the asymptotic smoothed counting function of the Riemann zeros.\n", "  We set to search for Rayleigh scattering and K and Na absorption signatures\nfrom the atmosphere of TrES-3b using ground-based transmission spectroscopy\ncovering the wavelength range from 530 to 950 nm as observed with OSIRIS@GTC.\n  Our analysis is based on a Bayesian approach where the light curves covering\na set of given passbands are fitted jointly with PHOENIX-calculated stellar\nlimb darkening profiles. The analysis is carried out assuming both white and\nred -- temporally correlated -- noise, with two approaches (Gaussian processes\nand divide-by-white) to account for the red noise.\n  An initial analysis reveals a transmission spectrum that shows a strong\nRayleigh-like increase in extinction towards the blue end of the spectrum, and\nenhanced extinction around the K I resonance doublet near 767 nm. However, the\nsignal amplitudes are significantly larger than expected from theoretical\nconsiderations. A detailed analysis reveals that the K I-like feature is\nentirely due to variability in the telluric O$_2$ absorption, but the\nRayleigh-like feature remains unexplained.\n", "  In this work we probe the usefulness of non-Gaussian entangled states as a\nresource for quantum communication through atmospheric channels. We outline the\ninitial conditions in which non-Gaussian state transfer leads to enhanced\nentanglement transfer relative to that obtainable via Gaussian state transfer.\nHowever, we conclude that in (anticipated) operational scenarios - where most\nof the non-Gaussian states to be transferred over the air are created\njust-in-time via photonic subtraction, addition or replacement from incoming\nGaussian states - the entanglement-generation rate between stations via\nnon-Gaussian state transfer will be substantially less than that created by\ndirect Gaussian state transfer. The role of post-selection, distillation and\nquantum memory in altering this conclusion is discussed, and comparison with\nentanglement rates produced via single-photon technologies is provided. Our\nresults suggest that in the near term entangled Gaussian states, squeezed\nbeyond some modest level, offer the most attractive proposition for the\ndistribution of entanglement through high-loss atmospheric channels. The\nimplications of our results for entanglement-based QKD to low-earth orbit are\npresented.\n", "  We present a self-consistent analysis of the topological superconductivity\narising from the interaction between self-ordered localized magnetic moments\nand electrons in one-dimensional conductors in contact with a superconductor.\nWe show that due to a gain in entropy there exists a magnetically ordered yet\nnon-topological phase at finite temperatures that is relevant for systems of\nmagnetic adatom chains on a superconductor. Spin-orbit interaction is taken\ninto account, and we show that it causes a modification of the magnetic order\nyet without affecting the topological properties.\n", "  The recent LHCb discovery of states $P_c^+(4380)$, $P_c^+(4450)$, believed to\nbe $c\\bar c uud$ pentaquark resonances, begs the question of whether equivalent\nstates with $c\\bar c \\to s\\bar s$ exist, and how they might be produced. The\nprecise analogue to the $P_c^+$ discovery channel $\\Lambda_b \\to J/\\psi \\, K^-\n\\! p$, namely, $\\Lambda_c \\to \\phi \\pi^0 \\! p$, is feasible for this study and\nindeed is less Cabibbo-suppressed, although its limited phase space suggests\nthat evidence of a $s\\bar s uud$ resonance $P_s^+$ would be confined to the\nkinematic endpoint region.\n", "  We demonstrate that yttrium iron garnet microspheres support optical\nwhispering gallery modes similar to those in non-magnetic dielectric materials.\nThe direction of the ferromagnetic moment tunes both the resonant frequency via\nthe Voigt effect as well as the degree of polarization rotation via the Faraday\neffect. An understanding of the magneto-optical coupling in whispering gallery\nmodes, where the propagation direction rotates with respect to the\nmagnetization, is fundamental to the emerging field of cavity optomagnonics.\n", "  The formation and propagation of a polariton condensate under tightly focused\nexcitation is investigated in a ZnO microcavity both experimentally and\ntheoretically. 2D near-field and far-field images of the condensate are\nmeasured under quasi-continuous non-resonant excitation. The corresponding\nspatial profiles are compared to a model based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nunder cylindrical geometry. This work allows to connect the experiments\nperformed with a small excitation laser spot and the previous kinetic models of\ncondensation in a 2D infinite microcavity, and to determine the relevant\nparameters of both the interaction and the relaxation between the reservoir and\nthe condensate. Two main parameters are identified: the exciton-photon detuning\nthrough the polariton effective mass and the temperature, which determines the\nefficiency of the relaxation from the reservoir to the condensate.\n", "  The problem of finding a microscopic theory of phase transitions across a\ncritical point is a central unsolved problem in theoretical physics. We find a\ngeneral solution to that problem and present it here for the cases of\nBose-Einstein condensation in an interacting gas and ferromagnetism in a\nlattice of spins, interacting via a Heisenberg or Ising Hamiltonian. For\nBose-Einstein condensation, we present the exact, valid for the entire critical\nregion, equations for the Green functions and order parameter, that is a\ncritical-region extension of the Beliaev-Popov and Gross-Pitaevskii equations.\nFor the magnetic phase transition, we find an exact theory in terms of\nconstrained bosons in a lattice and obtain similar equations for the Green\nfunctions and order parameter. In particular, we outline an exact solution for\nthe three-dimensional Ising model.\n", "  Predictions of glueball decay rates in the holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto\nmodel for low-energy QCD can be uniquely extended to include finite quark\nmasses up to an as yet undetermined parameter in the coupling of glueballs to\nthe nonanomalous part of the pseudoscalar mass terms. The assumption of a\nuniversal coupling of glueballs to mass terms of the full nonet of pseudoscalar\nmesons leads to flavor asymmetries in the decay rates of scalar glueballs that\nagree well with experimental data for the glueball candidate $f_0(1710)$ and\nimplies a vanishing decay rate into $\\eta\\eta'$ pairs, for which only upper\nbounds for the $f_0(1710)$ meson are known at present from experiment. Relaxing\nthis assumption, the holographic model gives a tight correlation between the\ndecay rates into pairs of pseudo-Goldstone bosons of same type and $\\eta\\eta'$\npairs. If $\\Gamma(G\\to KK)/\\Gamma(G\\to\\pi\\pi)$ is kept within the range\nreported currently by the Particle Data Group for the $f_0(1710)$ meson, the\nrate $\\Gamma(G\\to\\eta\\eta')/\\Gamma(G\\to\\pi\\pi)$ is predicted to be $\\lesssim\n0.04$. The corresponding situation for $f_0(1500)$ is also discussed, which\nhowever is found to be much less compatible with the interpretation of a\nlargely unmixed glueball.\n", "  Injecting a single hole into a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain is\nprobably the simplest case of doping a Mott insulator. The motion of such a\nsingle hole will generally induce a many-body phase shift, which can be\nidentified by an exact sign structure of the model known as the phase string.\nWe show that the sign structure is nontrivial even in this simplest problem,\nwhich is responsible for the essential properties of Mott physics. We find that\nthe characteristic momentum structure, the Luttinger liquid behavior, and the\nquantum phase interference of the hole under a periodic boundary condition, can\nall be attributed to it. We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nnumerical simulation to make a comparative study of the $t$-$J$ chain and a\nmodel in which the sign structure is switched off. We further show that the key\nDMRG results can be reproduced by a variational wave function with\nincorporating the correct sign structure. Physical implications of the sign\nstructure for doped Mott insulators in general are also discussed.\n", "  We show that for a finite number of emitting sources, the Color Glass\nCondensate produces substantial elliptic azimuthal anisotropy, characterized by\n$v_2$, for two and four particle correlations for momentum greater than or of\nthe order the saturation momentum. The flow produced has the correct\nsemi-quantitative features to describe flow seen in LHC experiments with p-Pb\nand pp collisions. This flow is induced by quantum mechanical interference\nbetween the waves of produced particles, and the flow itself is coupled to\nfluctuations in the positions of emitting sources. We shortly discuss\ngeneralizing these results to odd $v_n$, to correlations involving larger\nnumber of particles, and to transverse momentum scales $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD} \\ll\np_T \\ll Q_{\\rm sat}$.\n", "  This paper describes the Polarization Spectroscopic Telescope Array\n(PolSTAR), a mission proposed to NASA's 2014 Small Explorer (SMEX) announcement\nof opportunity. PolSTAR measures the linear polarization of 3-50 keV\n(requirement; goal: 2.5-70 keV) X-rays probing the behavior of matter,\nradiation and the very fabric of spacetime under the extreme conditions close\nto the event horizons of black holes, as well as in and around magnetars and\nneutron stars. The PolSTAR design is based on the technology developed for the\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission launched in June 2012.\nIn particular, it uses the same X-ray optics, extendable telescope boom,\noptical bench, and CdZnTe detectors as NuSTAR. The mission has the sensitivity\nto measure ~1% linear polarization fractions for X-ray sources with fluxes down\nto ~5 mCrab. This paper describes the PolSTAR design as well as the science\ndrivers and the potential science return.\n", "  Transport and gain properties of a resonant-phonon terahertz quantum cascade\nlaser are calculated using nonequilibrium Green's functions. Impurity\nscattering is shown to be responsible for contrasting nonlinear effects in the\ntransport and the gain properties. For typical doping concentrations, the\ncurrent density is found to be weakly sensitive to the impurity scattering\nstrength. In contrast, the calculated gain is found to be very sensitive to the\nimpurity scattering strength. This difference is attributed to the strong\nmomentum dependence of the long-range coupling to charged impurities.\nSmall-momentum impurity scattering is shown to be responsible for an incoherent\nregime of resonant tunneling processes. These new insights into the crucial\nrole of impurity scattering open a new route of improvement of terahertz\nquantum cascade lasers by engineering of the doping profile.\n", "  The same leptoquarks that explain the recently observed anomaly in $R_K$ can\ngenerate naturally small Majorana neutrino masses at one-loop level through\nmixing with the standard model Higgs boson. This is particularly relevant in\nmodels with at least two leptoquarks contributing to $b \\rightarrow s ll$\ntransitions.\n", "  The simplest two-field completion of natural inflation has a regime in which\nboth fields are active and in which its predictions are within the Planck\n1-$\\sigma$ confidence contour. We show this for the original model of natural\ninflation, in which inflation is achieved through the explicit breaking of a\nU(1) symmetry. We consider the case in which the mass coming from explicit\nbreaking of this symmetry is comparable to that from spontaneous breaking,\nwhich we show is consistent with a hierarchy between the corresponding energy\nscales. While both masses are comparable when the observable modes left the\nhorizon, the mass hierarchy is restored in the last e-foldings of inflation,\nrendering the predictions consistent with the isocurvature bounds. For\ncompleteness, we also study the predictions for the case in which there is a\nlarge hierarchy of masses and an initial period of inflation driven by the\n(heavy) radial field.\n", "  I propose a method for ultrafast switching of ferroelectric polarization\nusing mid-infrared pulses. This involves selectively exciting the highest\nfrequency $A_1$ phonon mode of a ferroelectric material with an intense\nmid-infrared pulse. Large amplitude oscillations of this mode provides a\nunidirectional force to the lattice such that it displaces along the lowest\nfrequency $A_1$ phonon mode coordinate because of a nonlinear coupling of the\ntype $g Q_{\\textrm{P}} Q_{\\textrm{IR}}^2$ between the two modes. First\nprinciples calculations show that this coupling is large in transition-metal\noxide ferroelectrics, and the sign of the coupling is such that the lattice\ndisplaces in the switching direction. Furthermore, I find that the lowest\nfrequency $A_1$ mode has a large $Q_{\\textrm{P}}^3$ order anharmonicity, which\ncauses a discontinuous switch of electric polarization as the pump amplitude is\ncontinuously increased.\n", "  We derive a kinematic condition on the resolution of intrinsic charm and\ndiscuss phenomenological consequences.\n", "  We study quantum corrections to the classical Bianchi I and Bianchi IX\nuniverses. The modified dynamics is well-motivated from the asymptotic safety\nprogram where the short-distance behavior of gravity is governed by a\nnon-trivial renormalization group fixed point. The correction terms induce a\nphase transition in the dynamics of the model, changing the classical, chaotic\nKasner oscillations into a uniform approach to a point singularity. The\nresulting implications for the microscopic structure of spacetime are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper we consider a Lorentz-breaking scalar field theory within the\nHorava-Lifshtz approach. We investigate the changes that a space-time\nanisotropy produces in the Casimir effect. A massless real quantum scalar field\nis considered in two distinct situations: between two parallel plates and\ninside a rectangular two-dimensional box. In both cases we have adopted\nspecific boundary conditions on the field at the boundary. As we shall see, the\nenergy and the Casimir force strongly depends on the parameter associated with\nthe breaking of Lorentz symmetry and also on the boundary conditions.\n", "  We study the change of the effect of the current quark mass on the\ninhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram, and discuss the property\nof the phase transition by the generalized Ginzburg-Landau expansion. The\nstrong external magnetic field spreads this phase over the low chemical\npotential region even if the current quark mass is finite. This implies that\nthe existence of this phase can be explored by the lattice QCD simulation.\n", "  We present [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] abundance ratios and CH({\\lambda}4300) and\nS({\\lambda}3883) index measurements for 94 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the\nSculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy from VLT/VIMOS MOS observations at a resolving\npower R= 1150 at 4020 {\\AA}. This is the first time that [N/Fe] abundances are\nderived for a large number of stars in a dwarf spheroidal. We found a trend for\nthe [C/Fe] abundance to decrease with increasing luminosity on the RGB across\nthe whole metallicity range, a phenomenon observed in both field and globular\ncluster giants, which can be interpreted in the framework of evolutionary\nmixing of partially processed CNO material. Both our measurements of [C/Fe] and\n[N/Fe] are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for stars at\nsimilar luminosity and metallicity. We detected a dispersion in the carbon\nabundance at a given [Fe/H], which cannot be ascribed to measurement\nuncertainties alone. We interpret this observational evidence as the result of\nthe contribution of different nucleosynthesis sources over time to a not\nwell-mixed interstellar medium. We report the discovery of two new\ncarbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars. These are likely the result of pollution\nfrom material enriched by asymptotic giant branch stars, as indicated by our\nestimates of [Ba/Fe]> +1. We also attempted a search for dissolved globular\nclusters in the field of the galaxy by looking for the distinctive C-N pattern\nof second population globular clusters stars in a previously detected, very\nmetal-poor, chemodynamical substructure. We do not detect chemical anomalies\namong this group of stars. However, small number statistics and limited spatial\ncoverage do not allow us to exclude the hypotheses that this substructure forms\npart of a tidally shredded globular cluster.\n", "  We study the behavior of the non-adiabatic population transfer between\nresonances at an exceptional point in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. It is\nknown that, when the exceptional point is encircled, the system always ends up\nin the same state, independent of the initial occupation within the\ntwo-dimensional subspace spanned by the states coalescing at the exceptional\npoint. We verify this behavior for a realistic quantum system, viz. the\nhydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields. It is also shown that\nthe non-adiabatic hypothesis can be violated when resonances in the vicinity\nare taken into account. In addition, we study the non-adiabatic population\ntransfer in the case of a third-order exceptional point, in which three\nresonances are involved.\n", "  We note that in large space shell model calculaiotns and experiment one\nsometimes get results, the form of which also appear in smaller space\ncalculations. On the other hand there are some results which demand the large\nspace approach.\n", "  We propose a new method for calculating the Chern-Simons orbital\nmagnetoelectric coupling, conventionally parametrized in terms of a phase angle\n$\\theta$. According to previous theories, $\\theta$ can be expressed as a 3D\nBrillouin-zone integral of the Chern-Simons 3-form defined in terms of the\noccupied Bloch functions. Such an expression is valid only if a smooth and\nperiodic gauge has been chosen in the entire Brillouin zone, and even then,\nconvergence with respect to the $\\mathbf{k}$-space mesh density can be\ndifficult to obtain. In order to solve this problem, we propose to relax the\nperiodicity condition in one direction (say, the $k_z$ direction) so that a\ngauge discontinuity is introduced on a 2D $\\mathbf{k}$ plane normal to $k_z$.\nThe total $\\theta$ response then has contributions from both the integral of\nthe Chern-Simons 3-form over the 3D bulk BZ and the gauge discontinuity\nexpressed as a 2D integral over the $\\mathbf{k}$ plane. Sometimes the boundary\nplane may be further divided into subregions by 1D \"vortex loops\" which make a\nthird kind of contribution to the total $\\theta$, expressed as a combination of\nBerry phases around the vortex loops. The total $\\theta$ thus consists of three\nterms which can be expressed as integrals over 3D, 2D and 1D manifolds. When\ntime-reversal symmetry is present and the gauge in the bulk BZ is chosen to\nrespect this symmetry, both the 3D and 2D integrals vanish; the entire\ncontribution then comes from the vortex-loop integral, which is either 0 or\n$\\pi$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of 3D time-reversal\ninvariant insulators. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the\nFu-Kane-Mele model with an applied staggered Zeeman field.\n", "  Many of the properties of graphene are tied to its lattice structure,\nallowing for tuning of charge carrier dynamics through mechanical strain. The\ngraphene electro-mechanical coupling yields very large pseudomagnetic fields\nfor small strain fields, up to hundreds of Tesla, which offer new scientific\nopportunities unattainable with ordinary laboratory magnets. Significant\nchallenges exist in investigation of pseudomagnetic fields, limited by the\nnon-planar graphene geometries in existing demonstrations and the lack of a\nviable approach to controlling the distribution and intensity of the\npseudomagnetic field. Here we reveal a facile and effective mechanism to\nachieve programmable extreme pseudomagnetic fields with uniform distributions\nin a planar graphene sheet over a large area by a simple uniaxial stretch. We\nachieve this by patterning the planar graphene geometry and graphene-based\nhetero-structures with a shape function to engineer a desired strain gradient.\nOur method is geometrical, opening up new fertile opportunities of strain\nengineering of electronic properties of 2D materials in general.\n", "  We consider a scalar field model with a self-interaction potential that\npossesses a discrete vacuum manifold. We point out that this model allows for\nboth topological as well as non-topological solitons. In (1+1) dimensions both\ntype of solutions have finite energy, while in (3+1) dimensions, the\ntopological solitons have finite energy per unit area only and correspond to\ndomain walls. Non-topological solitons with finite energy do exist in (3+1)\ndimensions due to a non-trivial phase of the scalar field and an associated\nU(1) symmetry of the model, though. We construct these so-called Q-ball\nsolutions numerically, point out the differences to previous studies with\ndifferent scalar field potentials and also discuss the influence of a minimal\ncoupling to both gravity as well as a U(1) gauge field. In this latter case,\nthe conserved Noether charge Q can be interpreted as the electric charge of the\nsolution.\n", "  We investigate a system of $N$ spinless bosons confined in\nquasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap with repulsive two-body finite-range\nGaussian interaction potential of large $s$-wave scattering length. Exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix is carried out to obtain the $N$-body\nground state as well as low-lying excited states, using Davidson algorithm in\nbeyond lowest-Landau-level approximation. We examine the finite-range effects\nof the interaction potential on the many-body ground state energy as also the\ndegree of condensation of the Bose-condensed gas. The results obtained indicate\nthat the finite-range Gaussian interaction potential enhances the degree of\ncondensation compared to the zero-range interaction potential. We further\nanalyze the effect of finite-range interaction potential on the breathing mode\ncollective excitation. Our theoretical results may be relevant for experiments\ncurrently conducted on quasi-two-dimensional Bose gas with more realistic\ninteraction potential.\n", "  The growing evidence pointing at core-collapse supernovae as large dust\nproducers makes young massive stellar clusters ideal laboratories to study the\nevolution of dust immersed into a hot plasma. Here we address the stochastic\ninjection of dust by supernovae and follow its evolution due to thermal\nsputtering within the hot and dense plasma generated by young stellar clusters.\nUnder these considerations, dust grains are heated by means of random\ncollisions with gas particles which results on the appearance of infrared\nspectral signatures. We present time-dependent infrared spectral energy\ndistributions which are to be expected from young stellar clusters. Our results\nare based on hydrodynamic calculations that account for the stochastic\ninjection of dust by supernovae. These also consider gas and dust radiative\ncooling, stochastic dust temperature fluctuations, the exit of dust grains out\nof the cluster volume due to the cluster wind and a time-dependent grain size\ndistribution.\n", "  We investigate the quantum interference shifts between energetically close\nstates, where the state structure is observed by laser spectroscopy. We report\na compact and analytical expression that models the quantum interference\ninduced shift for any admixture of circular polarization of the incident laser\nand angle of observation. An experimental scenario free of quantum interference\ncan thus be predicted with this formula. Although, this study is exemplified\nhere for muonic deuterium, it can be applied to any other laser spectroscopy\nmeasurement of $ns-n'p$ frequencies of a nonrelativistic atomic system, via a\n$ns\\rightarrow n'p \\rightarrow n\"s $ scheme.\n", "  We study the positive parity charmed strange mesons using lattice QCD, the\nonly reliable ab initio method to study QCD at low energies. Especially the\nexperimentally observed $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ have challenged\ntheory for quite some time. The dynamical lattice QCD simulations are performed\nat two distinct pion masses, $m_{\\pi}$ = 266 MeV and 156 MeV, using both\n$\\bar{c}s$ as well as $DK$ and $D^*K$ scattering operators in the construction\nof the correlation matrix in order to take into the account threshold effects.\nWhile the $J^P = 0^+$ channel benefited most from the inclusion of scattering\noperators, it was also crucial for the case of the $D_{s1}(2460)$. Using the\nL\\\"uscher method, which relates the finite volume spectrum to the infinite\nvolume scattering matrix, we were able to determine the near threshold behavior\nof the scattering amplitude. From it we extracted the binding momenta and the\nmasses of the below-threshold bound states $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$\nby determining the pole positions of the scattering amplitudes. Our results\ncompare well with experiment, resolving a long standing discrepancy between\ntheory and experiment.\n", "  This study aims to elucidate a possible link between chemical properties of\nices in star-forming regions and environmental characteristics of the host\ngalaxy. We performed 3--4 micron spectroscopic observations toward nine\nembedded high-mass YSOs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the ISAAC at\nthe VLT. Additionally, we analyzed archival ISAAC data of two LMC YSOs. As a\nresult, we detected absorption bands due to solid H2O and CH3OH as well as the\n3.47 micron absorption band. The 3.53 micron CH3OH ice absorption band for the\nLMC YSOs is found to be absent or very weak compared to that seen toward\nGalactic sources. The result suggests the low abundance of CH3OH ice in the\nLMC. The 3.47 micron absorption band is detected toward six out of eleven LMC\nYSOs. We found that the 3.47 micron band and the H2O ice band correlate\nsimilarly between the LMC and Galactic samples, but the LMC sources seem to\nrequire a slightly higher H2O ice threshold for the appearance of the 3.47\nmicron band. For the LMC sources with relatively large H2O ice optical depths,\nwe found that the strength ratio of the 3.47 micron band relative to the water\nice band is only marginally lower than those of the Galactic sources. We\npropose that grain surface reactions at a relatively high dust temperature\n(warm ice chemistry) are responsible for the observed characteristics of ice\nchemical compositions in the LMC. We suggest that this warm ice chemistry is\none of the important characteristics of interstellar and circumstellar\nchemistry in low metallicity environments. The low abundance of CH3OH in the\nsolid phase implies that formation of complex organic molecules from\nmethanol-derived species is less efficient in the LMC. For the 3.47 micron\nband, the observed difference in the water ice threshold may suggest that a\nmore shielded environment is necessary for the formation of the 3.47 micron\nband carrier in the LMC.\n", "  HD 188112 is a bright (V = 10.2 mag) hot subdwarf B (sdB) star with a mass\ntoo low to ignite core helium burning and is therefore considered as a\npre-extremely low mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD). ELM WDs (M $\\le$ 0.3 Msun) are\nHe-core objects produced by the evolution of compact binary systems. We present\nin this paper a detailed abundance analysis of HD 188112 based on\nhigh-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near and far-ultraviolet\nspectroscopy. We also constrain the mass of the star's companion. We use hybrid\nnon-LTE model atmospheres to fit the observed spectral lines and derive the\nabundances of more than a dozen elements as well as the rotational broadening\nof metallic lines. We confirm the previous binary system parameters by\ncombining radial velocities measured in our UV spectra with the already\npublished ones. The system has a period of 0.60658584 days and a WD companion\nwith M $\\geq$ 0.70 Msun. By assuming a tidally locked rotation, combined with\nthe projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 7.9 $\\pm$ 0.3 km s$^{-1}$) we\nconstrain the companion mass to be between 0.9 and 1.3 Msun. We further discuss\nthe future evolution of the system as a potential progenitor of a\n(underluminous) type Ia supernova. We measure abundances for Mg, Al, Si, P, S,\nCa, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn, as well as for the trans-iron elements Ga, Sn,\nand Pb. In addition, we derive upper limits for the C, N, O elements and find\nHD 188112 to be strongly depleted in carbon. We find evidence of non-LTE\neffects on the line strength of some ionic species such as Si II and Ni II. The\nmetallic abundances indicate that the star is metal-poor, with an abundance\npattern most likely produced by diffusion effects.\n", "  Earth's atmosphere imprints a large number of telluric absorption and\nemission lines on astronomical spectra, especially in the near infrared, that\nneed to be removed before analysing the affected wavelength regions. These\nlines are typically removed by comparison to A- or B-type stars used as\ntelluric standards that themselves have strong hydrogen lines, which\ncomplicates the removal of telluric lines. We have developed a method to\ncircumvent that problem. For our IDL software package tellrem we used a recent\napproach to model telluric absorption features with the line-by-line radiative\ntransfer model (LBLRTM). The broad wavelength coverage of the X-Shooter at VLT\nallows us to expand their technique by determining the abundances of the most\nimportant telluric molecules H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4 from sufficiently isolated\nline groups. For individual observations we construct a telluric absorption\nmodel for most of the spectral range that is used to remove the telluric\nabsorption from the object spectrum. We remove telluric absorption from both\ncontinuum regions and emission lines without systematic residuals for most of\nthe processable spectral range; however, our method increases the statistical\nerrors. The errors of the corrected spectrum typically increase by 10% for\nS/N~10 and by a factor of two for high-quality data (S/N~100), i.e. the method\nis accurate on the percent level. Modelling telluric absorption can be an\nalternative to the observation of standard stars for removing telluric\ncontamination.\n", "  This work presents the surface reconstructions and transport properties of\nthe topological insulator PtLuSb grown on Al0.1In0.9Sb/GaAs (001). Two stable\nsurface reconstructions, (1x3) and c(2x2), were observed on PtLuSb (001)\nsurfaces. Antimony-dimerization was determined to be the nature of the (1x3)\nsurface reconstruction as evidenced by chemical binding energy shifts in the\nantimony 4d core-level for surface bonding components. The two surface\nreconstructions were studied as a function of Sb4 overpressure and substrate\ntemperature to create a reconstruction phase diagram. From this reconstruction\nphase diagram, a growth window from 320 {\\deg}C to 380 {\\deg}C using an\nantimony overpressure was identified. Within this window, the highest quality\nfilms were grown at a growth temperature of 380 {\\deg}C. These films exhibited\nlower p-type carrier concentrations as well as relatively high hole mobilities.\n", "  When a drop containing colloidal particles evaporates on a surface, a\ncircular stain made of these particles is often observed due to an internal\nflow toward the contact line. To hinder this effect, several approaches have\nbeen proposed such as flow modification by addition of surfactants or control\nof the interactions between the particles. All of these strategies involve the\nliquid phase while maintaining the drying process. However, substitution of\nevaporation by absorption into the substrate of the solvent has been\ninvestigated less. Here, we show that a droplet containing colloidal particles\ndeposited on swelling hydrogels can lead to a nearly uniform coating. We report\nexperiments and theory to explore the relation between the gel swelling,\nuniformity of deposition and the adsorption dynamics of the particles at the\nsubstrate. Our findings suggest that draining the solvent by absorption\nprovides a robust route to homogeneous coatings.\n", "  One-atom-thick crystals are impermeable to atoms and molecules, but hydrogen\nions (thermal protons) penetrate through them. We show that monolayers of\ngraphene and boron nitride can be used to separate hydrogen ion isotopes.\nEmploying electrical measurements and mass spectrometry, we find that deuterons\npermeate through these crystals much slower than protons, resulting in a\nseparation factor of ~10 at room temperature. The isotope effect is attributed\nto a difference of about 60 meV between zero-point energies of incident protons\nand deuterons, which translates into the equivalent difference in the\nactivation barriers posed by two dimensional crystals. In addition to providing\ninsight into the proton transport mechanism, the demonstrated approach offers a\ncompetitive and scalable way for hydrogen isotope enrichment.\n", "  Measurements of the cross-correlation between the extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground (EGB) and large-scale structure provide a novel probe of dark matter\non extragalactic scales. We focus on luminous red galaxies (LRGs) as optimal\ntargets to search for the signal of dark matter annihilation. We measure the\ncross-correlation function of the EGB taken from the Fermi Large Area Telescope\nwith the LRGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Statistical errors are\ncalculated using a large set of realistic mock LRG catalogs. The amplitude of\nthe measured cross-correlation is consistent with null detection. Based on an\naccurate theoretical model of the distribution of dark matter associated with\nLRGs, we exclude dark matter annihilation cross-sections over $\\langle \\sigma\nv\\rangle =3\\times10^{-25}-10^{-26}\\, {\\rm cm}^3 \\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ for a 10 GeV\ndark matter. We further investigate systematic effects due to uncertainties in\nthe Galactic gamma-ray foreground emission, which we find to be an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the current statistical uncertainty. We also estimate\nthe contamination from astrophysical sources in the LRGs by using known scaling\nrelations between gamma-ray luminosity and star-formation rate, finding them to\nbe negligibly small. Based on these results, we suggest that LRGs remain ideal\ntargets for probing dark matter annihilation with future EGB measurement and\ngalaxy surveys. Increasing the number of LRGs in upcoming galaxy surveys such\nas LSST would lead to big improvements of factors of several in sensitivity.\n", "  Electric-field manipulation of magnetic order has proved of both fundamental\nand technological importance in spintronic devices. So far, electric-field\ncontrol of ferromagnetism, magnetization and magnetic anisotropy has been\nexplored in various magnetic materials, but the efficient electric-field\ncontrol of spin-orbit torque (SOT) still remains elusive. Here, we report the\neffective electric-field control of a giant SOT in a Cr-doped topological\ninsulator (TI) thin film using a top-gate FET structure. The SOT strength can\nbe modulated by a factor of 4 within the accessible gate voltage range, and it\nshows strong correlation with the spin-polarized surface current in the film.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the magnetization switching by scanning gate\nvoltage with constant current and in-plane magnetic field applied in the film.\nThe effective electric-field control of SOT and the giant spin-torque\nefficiency in Cr-doped TI may lead to the development of energy-efficient\ngate-controlled spin-torque devices compatible with modern field-effect\nsemiconductor technologies.\n", "  Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a powerful set of tools for search and\noptimization that mimic the process of natural selection, and have been used\nsuccessfully in a wide variety of problems, including evolving neural networks\nto solve cognitive tasks. Despite their success, GAs sometimes fail to locate\nthe highest peaks of the fitness landscape, in particular if the landscape is\nrugged and contains multiple peaks. Reaching distant and higher peaks is\ndifficult because valleys need to be crossed, in a process that (at least\ntemporarily) runs against the fitness maximization objective. Here we propose\nand test a number of information-theoretic (as well as network-based) measures\nthat can be used in conjunction with a fitness maximization objective\n(so-called ``neuro-correlates\") to evolve neural controllers for two widely\ndifferent tasks: a behavioral task that requires information integration, and a\ncognitive task that requires memory and logic. We find that judiciously chosen\nneuro-correlates can significantly aid GAs to find the highest peaks.\n", "  Angus et al. (2015) have recently faulted MOND as follows: Studying thirty\ndisc galaxies from the DiskMass survey, they derive the profiles of velocity\ndispersion perpendicular to the discs as predicted by MOND, $\\sigma_M(r)$, and\ncompare them with $\\sigma(r)$, measured as part of the DiskMass project. This\nis a new test of MOND, different from rotation-curve analysis. A nontrivial\naccomplishment of MOND -- not discussed by Angus et al. -- is that the shapes\nof $\\sigma_M$ and $\\sigma$ agree very well, i.e,\n$\\eta(r)\\equiv\\sigma_M(r)/\\sigma(r)$ is well consistent with being\n$r$-independent (while $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma_M$ are strongly $r$ dependent). The\nfault found with MOND was that $\\eta$ is systematically above 1 (with an\naverage of about 1.3). I have suggested to Angus et al. that the fault may lie\nwith the DiskMass dispersions, which may well be too low for the purpose at\nhand: Being based on population-integrated line profiles, they may be\noverweighed by younger populations, known to have much smaller dispersions, and\nscale heights, than the older populations, which weigh more heavily on the\nlight distributions. I discuss independent evidence that supports this view,\nand show, besides, that if the DiskMas dispersions are underestimates by only\n25 %, on average, the MOND predictions are in full agreement with the data, in\nshape and magnitude. Now, Aniyan et al. (2015) have questioned the DiskMass\n$\\sigma$ on the same basis. They show for the solar column in the Milky Way\nthat: \" Combining the (single) measured velocity dispersion of the total young\n+ old disc population... with the scale height estimated for the older\npopulation would underestimate the disc surface density by a factor of $\\sim\n2.$\" If this mismatch found for the Milky Way is typical, correcting for it\nwould bring the measured DiskMass $\\sigma(r)$ to a remarkable agreement with\nthe predicted MOND $\\sigma_M(r)$.\n", "  The radical-pair mechanism was introduced in the 1960's to explain\nanomalously large EPR and NMR signals in chemical reactions of organic\nmolecules. It has evolved to the cornerstone of spin chemistry, the study of\nthe effect electron and nuclear spins have on chemical reactions, with the\navian magnetic compass mechanism and the photosynthetic reaction center\ndynamics being prominent biophysical manifestations of such effects. In recent\nyears the radical-pair mechanism was shown to be an ideal biological system\nwhere the conceptual tools of quantum information science can be fruitfully\napplied. We will here review recent work making the case that the radical-pair\nmechanism is indeed a major driving force of the emerging field of quantum\nbiology.\n", "  In recent years, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been becoming a\nmore and more important radiation technique widely used in clinical application\nfor cancer treatment. One of the key problems in VMAT is treatment plan\noptimization, which is complicated due to the constraints imposed by the\ninvolved equipments. In this paper, we consider a model with four major\nconstraints: the bound on the beam intensity, an upper bound on the rate of the\nchange of the beam intensity, the moving speed of leaves of the multi-leaf\ncollimator (MLC) and its directional-convexity. We solve the model by a\ntwo-stage algorithm: performing minimization with respect to the shapes of the\naperture and the beam intensities alternatively. Specifically, the shapes of\nthe aperture are obtained by a greedy algorithm whose performance is enhanced\nby random sampling in the leaf pairs with a decremental rate. The beam\nintensity is optimized using a gradient projection method with non-monotonic\nline search. We further improve the proposed algorithm by an incremental random\nimportance sampling of the voxels to reduce the computational cost of the\nenergy functional. Numerical simulations on two clinical cancer date sets\ndemonstrate that our method is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms in terms of both computational time and quality of treatment\nplanning.\n", "  Among the near-Earth object (NEO) population there are comets and active\nasteroids which are sources of fragments that initially move together; in\naddition, some NEOs follow orbits temporarily trapped in a web of secular\nresonances. These facts contribute to increasing the risk of meteoroid strikes\non Earth, making its proper quantification difficult. The identification and\nsubsequent study of groups of small NEOs that appear to move in similar\ntrajectories are necessary steps in improving our understanding of the impact\nrisk associated with meteoroids. Here, we present results of a search for\nstatistically significant dynamical groupings among the NEO population. Our\nMonte Carlo-based methodology recovers well-documented groupings like the\nTaurid Complex or the one resulting from the split comet\n73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, and new ones that may have been the source of past\nimpacts. Among the most conspicuous are the Mjolnir and Ptah groups, perhaps\nthe source of recent impact events like Almahata Sitta and Chelyabinsk,\nrespectively. Meteoroid 2014 AA, that hit the Earth on 2014 January 2, could\nhave its origin in a marginally significant grouping associated with Bennu. We\nfind that most of the substructure present within the orbital domain of the\nNEOs is of resonant nature, probably induced by secular resonances and the\nKozai mechanism that confine these objects into specific paths with\nwell-defined perihelia.\n", "  We eport on an ultra-low birefringence dodecagonal glass cell for ultra-high\nvacuum applications. The epoxy-bonded trapezoidal windows of the cell are made\nof SF57 glass, which exhibits a very low stress-induced birefringence. We\ncharacterize the birefringence $\\Delta n$ of each window with the cell under\nvacuum conditions, obtaining values around $\\num{e-8}$. After baking the cell\nat $\\SI{150}{\\degreeCelsius}$, we reach a pressure below $\\SI{e-10}{\\milli\n\\bar}$. In addition, each window is antireflection coated on both sides, which\nis highly desirable for quantum optics experiments and precision measurements.\n", "  In the 70's Smith and Tassie, and Bell and Ruegg independently found SU(2)\nsymmetries of the Dirac equation with scalar and vector potentials. These\nsymmetries, known as pseudospin and spin symmetries, have been extensively\nresearched and applied to several physical systems. Twenty years after, in\n1997, the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed by Ginocchio as a relativistic\nsymmetry of the atomic nuclei when it is described by relativistic mean field\nhadronic models. The main feature of these symmetries is the suppression of the\nspin-orbit coupling either in the upper or lower components of the Dirac\nspinor, thereby turning the respective second-order equations into\nSchr\\\"odinger-like equations, i.e, without a matrix structure. In this paper we\npropose a generalization of these SU(2) symmetries for potentials in the Dirac\nequation with several Lorentz structures, which also allow for the suppression\nof the matrix structure of second-order equation equation of either the upper\nor lower components of the Dirac spinor. We derive the general properties of\nthose potentials and list some possible candidates, which include the usual\nspin-pseudospin potentials, and also 2- and 1-dimensional potentials. An\napplication for a particular physical system in two dimensions, electrons in\ngraphene, is suggested.\n", "  Glasses constitute a widespread form of solid matter, and glass production\nhas been an important human technology for more than 3000 years. Despite that\nlong history, new ways to understand the fundamental physics of glasses\ncontinue to emerge.\n", "  Investigation of light in the waveguide structures is a topical modern\nproblem that has long historical roots. A parallel-plate waveguide is a base\nmodel in these studies and it is intensively used in numerous investigations of\nnanooptics, integrated circuits and nanoplasmonics. In this letter we first\nhave found the analytical solution for the light modes in this waveguide. The\nsolution provides a clear physical picture for description of a light within\nthe broadband spectral range in the waveguide with various physical parameters.\nPotential of the analytical solutions for studies of light fields in the\nwaveguides of nanooptics and nanoplasmonics has been also discussed.\n", "  Size-calibrated commercial nanodiamonds synthesized by high-pressure\nhigh-temperature (HPHT) technique were studied by high-frequency W and\nconventional X band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The\nnumbers of spins in the studied samples were estimated. The core-shell model of\nthe HPHT nanodiamonds was proposed to explain the observed dependence of the\nconcentration of the N0 paramagnetic centers. Two other observed paramagnetic\ncenters are attributed to the two types of structures in the nanodiamond shell.\n", "  The dynamics of two symmetrically coupled populations of rotators is studied\nfor different values of the inertia. The system is characterized by different\ntypes of solutions, which all coexist with the fully synchronized state. At\nsmall inertia the system is no more chaotic and one observes mainly quasi-\nperiodic chimeras, while the usual (stationary) chimera state is not anymore\nobservable. At large inertia one observes two different kind of chaotic\nsolutions with broken symmetry: the intermittent chaotic chimera, characterized\nby a synchronized population and a population displaying a turbulent behaviour,\nand a second state where the two populations are both chaotic but whose\ndynamics adhere to two different macroscopic attractors. The intermittent\nchaotic chimeras are characterized by a finite life-time, whose duration\nincreases as a power-law with the system size and the inertia value. Moreover,\nthe chaotic population exhibits clear intermittent behavior, displaying a\nlaminar phase where the two populations tend to synchronize, and a turbulent\nphase where the macroscopic motion of one population is definitely erratic. In\nthe thermodynamic limit these states survive for infinite time and the laminar\nregimes tends to disappear, thus giving rise to stationary chaotic solutions\nwith broken symmetry contrary to what observed for chaotic chimeras on a ring\ngeometry.\n", "  The Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars (SPOTS) survey aims to study the\nformation and distribution of planets in binary systems by detecting and\ncharacterizing circumbinary planets and their formation environments through\ndirect imaging. With the SPHERE Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument, a good\ncontrast can be achieved even at small (<300 mas) separations from bright\nstars, which enables studies of planets and disks in a separation range that\nwas previously inaccessible. Here, we report the discovery of resolved\nscattered light emission from the circumbinary disk around the well-studied\nyoung double star AK Sco, at projected separations in the ~13--40 AU range. The\nsharp morphology of the imaged feature is surprising, given the smooth\nappearance of the disk in its spectral energy distribution. We show that the\nobserved morphology can be represented either as a highly eccentric ring around\nAK Sco, or as two separate spiral arms in the disk, wound in opposite\ndirections. The relative merits of these interpretations are discussed, as well\nas whether these features may have been caused by one or several circumbinary\nplanets interacting with the disk.\n", "  A predator-prey model of dual populations with stochastic oscillators is\npresented. A linear cross-coupling between the two populations is introduced\nfollowing the coupling between the motions of a Wilberforce pendulum in two\ndimensions: one in the longitudinal and the other in torsional plain. Within\neach population a Kuramoto type competition between the phases is assumed.\nThus, the synchronisation state of the whole system is controlled by these two\ntypes of competitions. The results of the numerical simulations show that by\nadding the linear cross-coupling interactions predator-prey oscillations\nbetween the two populations appear which results in self-regulation of the\nsystem by a transfer of synchrony between the two populations. The model\nrepresents several important features of the dynamical interplay between the\ndrift wave and zonal flow turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas, and a\nnovel interpretation of the coupled dynamics of drift wave-zonal flow\nturbulence using synchronisation of stochastic oscillator is discussed.\n", "  Using LAMOST spectroscopic data, we find a strong signal of a comoving group\nof stars in the constellation of Draco. The group, observed near the apocenter\nof its orbit, is 2.6 kpc from the Sun with a metallicity of -0.64 dex. The\nsystem is observed as a streaming population of unknown provenance with mass of\nabout 2.1E4 solar masses and an absolute V band magnitude of about -3.6. Its\nhigh metallicity, diffuse physical structure, and eccentric orbit may indicate\nthat the progenitor satellite was a globular cluster rather than a dwarf galaxy\nor an open cluster.\n", "  Context. Extinction and emission of dust models need for observational\nconstraints to be validated. The coreshine phenomenon has already shown the\nimportance of scattering in the 3 to 5 micron range and its ability to validate\ndust properties for dense cores. Aims. We want to investigate whether\nscattering can also play a role at longer wavelengths and to place even tighter\nconstraints on the dust properties. Methods. We analyze the inversion of the\nSpitzer 8 micron map of the dense molecular cloud L183, to examine the\nimportance of scattering as a potential contributor to the line-of-sight\nextinction. Results. The column density deduced from the inversion of the 8\nmicron map, when we neglect scattering, disagrees with all the other column\ndensity measurements of the same region. Modeling confirms that scattering at 8\nmicrons is not negligible with an intensity of several hundred kJy per sr. This\ndemonstrates the need of efficiently scattering dust grains at MIR wavelengths\nup to 8 microns. Coagulated aggregates are good candidates and might also\nexplain the discrepancy at high extinction between E(J-K) et tau(9.7) toward\ndense molecular clouds. Further investigation requires considering efficiently\nscattering dust grains including ices as realistic dust models.\n", "  The coherent optical manipulation of solids is emerging as a promising way to\nengineer novel quantum states of matter. The strong time periodic potential of\nintense laser light can be used to generate hybrid photon-electron states.\nInteraction of light with Bloch states leads to Floquet-Bloch states which are\nessential in realizing new photo-induced quantum phases. Similarly, dressing of\nfree electron states near the surface of a solid generates Volkov states which\nare used to study non-linear optics in atoms and semiconductors. The\ninteraction of these two dynamic states with each other remains an open\nexperimental problem. Here we use Time and Angle Resolved Photoemission\nSpectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) to selectively study the transition between these two\nstates on the surface of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. We find that the\ncoupling between the two strongly depends on the electron momentum, providing a\nroute to enhance or inhibit it. Moreover, by controlling the light polarization\nwe can negate Volkov states in order to generate pure Floquet-Bloch states.\nThis work establishes a systematic path for the coherent manipulation of solids\nvia light-matter interaction.\n", "  In this paper, we show how to use canonical perturbation theory for\ndissipative dynamical systems capable of showing limit cycle oscillations.\nThus, our work surmounts the hitherto perceived barrier for canonical\nperturbation theory that it can be applied only to a class of conservative\nsystems, viz.,~Hamiltonian systems. In the process, we also find Hamiltonian\nstructure for an important subset of Li\\'enard system--- a paradigmatic system\nfor modeling isolated and asymptotic oscillatory state. We discuss the\npossibility of extending our method to encompass even wider range of\nnon-conservative systems.\n", "  Can we quantify the change of complexity throughout evolutionary processes?\nWe attempt to address this question through an empirical approach. In very\ngeneral terms, we simulate two simple organisms on a computer that compete over\nlimited available resources. We implement Global Rules that determine the\ninteraction between two Elementary Cellular Automata on the same grid. Global\nRules change the complexity of the state evolution output which suggests that\nsome complexity is intrinsic to the interaction rules themselves. The largest\nincreases in complexity occurred when the interacting elementary rules had very\nlittle complexity, suggesting that they are able to accept complexity through\ninteraction only. We also found that some Class 3 or 4 CA rules are more\nfragile than others to Global Rules, while others are more robust, hence\nsuggesting some intrinsic properties of the rules independent of the Global\nRule choice. We provide statistical mappings of Elementary Cellular Automata\nexposed to Global Rules and different initial conditions onto different\ncomplexity classes.\n", "  A key concept in the field of semiconductor spintronics is an electric field\ncontrol of spins via the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the SOC strength governs\nefficiency of this control. We propose a new approach that allows the\nexperimental determination of the Rashba SOC strength for ballistic InAs\nnanowires. The energy spectrum and ballistic transport of carriers through the\nnanowire with surface two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a homogeneous\nmagnetic field are studied. A general formula for the linear-response\none-dimensional ballistic thermopower is derived in the case of complex subband\nstructure. The ballistic conductance and the thermopower are shown to reveal\nspecific features due to strong SOC that allows us to propose a method for the\nSOC strength determination.\n", "  We constructed the Hamiltonian of spin-orbit splitting for carriers of a\ntubular electron gas in InAs nanowires. The spectral problem is solved using an\nexact numerical diagonalization. It is shown that the contribution of k-linear\nDresselhaus-like spin-orbit (SO) coupling leads to renormalization of so-called\nSO-gaps and appearance of anticrossings in subband spectrum. These features can\nbe detected in ballistic transport.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a fundamental optical degree of\nfreedom that has recently motivated much exciting research in diverse fields\nranging from optical communication to quantum information. We show for the\nfirst time that it is also a unique and valuable resource for quantum\nsimulation, by demonstrating theoretically how \\emph{2d} topological physics\ncan be simulated in a \\emph{1d} array of optical cavities using OAM-carrying\nphotons. Remarkably, this newly discovered application of OAM states not only\nreduces required physical resources but also increases feasible scale of\nsimulation. By showing how important topics such as edge-state transport and\ntopological phase transition can be studied in a small simulator with just a\nfew cavities ready for immediate experimental exploration, we demonstrate the\nprospect of photonic OAM for quantum simulation which can have a significant\nimpact on the research of topological physics.\n", "  Inelastic scattering of electrons incident on a solid surface is determined\nby the two properties: (i) electronic response of the target system and (ii)\nthe detailed quantum-mechanical motion of the projectile electron inside and in\nthe vicinity of the target. We emphasize the equal importance of the second\ningredient, pointing out the fundamental limitations of the conventionally used\ntheoretical description of the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in\nterms of the ``energy-loss functions''. Our approach encompasses the dipole and\nimpact scattering as specific cases, with the emphasis on the\nquantum-mechanical treatment of the probe electron. Applied to the\nhigh-resolution EELS of Ag surface, our theory largely agrees with recent\nexperiments, while some instructive exceptions are rationalized.\n", "  Excitable media can develop spiral chaos, in which the number of spirals\nchanges chaotically with time. Depending on parameter values in dynamical\nequations, spiral chaos may permanently persist or spontaneously arrive at a\nsteady state after a transient time, referred to as the lifetime. Previous\nnumerical studies have demonstrated that the lifetime of transient spiral chaos\nincreases exponentially with system size to a good approximation. In this\nstudy, using the fact that the number of spirals obeys a Gaussian distribution,\nwe provide a general expression for the system size dependence of the lifetime\nfor large system sizes, which is indeed exponential. We confirm that the\nexpression is in good agreement with numerically obtained lifetimes for both\nexcitable and oscillatory media with parameter sets near the onset of transient\nchaos. The expression we develop for the lifetime is expected to be useful for\npredicting lifetimes in large systems.\n", "  Formation of electrostatic solitary structures are analysed for a magnetised\nplasma with ion and electron thermal anisotropies. The ion thermal anisotropy\nis modelled with the help of the Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) double adiabatic\nequations of state while the electrons are treated as inertia-less species with\nan anisotropic bi-Maxwellian velocity distribution function. A negative\nelectron thermal anisotropy $(T_{e\\perp}/T_e{\\parallel}>1)$ is found to help\nform large amplitude solitary structures which are in agreement with\nobservational data.\n", "  The paper considers an effect of intensive ultrasound on the suspension of\nsoot microparticles and nanoparticles in the inert gas, resulting in the\ncoagulation of relatively large soot particles and leading to the improvement\nof the efficiency of production of nanoparticles, as has been observed in\nexperiments. The effect of the particles charge on the possibility of\ncoagulation is analyzed.\n", "  We revisit the $(1+1)$ dimensional field theoretical model, which describes\nthe Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), interacting with a static impurity at the\norigin of the half line. Applying the Fermi-Bose equivalence and finite\nconformal transformations only, we map the model onto the Schmid model. Some\ndetails of the bosonization procedure have been given. The critical line and\nthe phase diagram of the model follow from the renormalization group analysis\nof the Schmid model. The obtained critical line of the model is a hyperbola in\nthe parameter space of the two couplings of the TLL.\n", "  We {\\it analytically} investigate the population and coherence dynamics and\nrelaxations in the vibrational energy transport in molecules. The corresponding\ntwo time scales $t_1$ and $t_2$ are explored. Coherence-population entanglement\nis found to considerably promote the time scale $t_2$ for dephasing and the\namplitude of coherence. This is attributed to the suppression of the\nenvironment-induced drift force by coherence. Moreover the population imbalance\n(magnetization) is shown to be significantly amplified with the\ncoherence-population entanglement. Contrary to the previous studies, we exactly\nelucidate a coherent process by showing $t_1<t_2$. We predict the relaxation of\nvibrational and orientational dynamics of OH-stretching modes in agreement with\nthe recent experiments, when applied to the water molecules dissolved in\nD$_2$O. Finally we explore the coherence effect on the heat current at the\nmacroscopic level.\n", "  We established a theoretical framework in terms of the curl flux, population\nlandscape, and coherence for non-equilibrium quantum systems at steady state,\nthrough exploring the energy and charge transport in molecular processes. The\ncurl quantum flux plays the key role in determining transport properties and\nthe system reaches equilibrium when flux vanishes. The novel curl quantum flux\nreflects the degree of non-equilibriumness and the time-irreversibility. We\nfound an analytical expression for the quantum flux and its relationship to the\nenvironmental pumping (non-equilibriumness quantified by the voltage away from\nthe equilibrium) and the quantum tunneling. Furthermore, we investigated\nanother quantum signature, the coherence, quantitatively measured by the\nnon-zero off diagonal element of the density matrix. Besides the\nenvironment-assistance which can give dramatic enhancement of coherence and\nquantum flux with high voltage at a fixed tunneling strength, the quantum flux\nis promoted by the coherence in the regime of small tunneling while reduced by\nthe coherence in the regime of large tunneling, due to the non-monotonic\nrelationship between the coherence and tunneling. In view of the system as a\nquantum heat engine, we studied the non-equilibrium thermodynamics and\nestablished the analytical connections of curl quantum flux to the transport\nquantities such as energy (charge) transfer efficiency, chemical reaction\nefficiency, energy dissipation, heat and electric currents observed in the\nexperiments. We observed a perfect transfer efficiency in chemical reactions at\nhigh voltage (chemical potential difference). Our theoretical predicted\nbehavior of the electric current with respect to the voltage is in good\nagreements with the recent experiments on electron transfer in single\nmolecules.\n", "  We provide a quantitative description of the nonequilibriumness based on the\nmodel of coupled oscillators interacting with multiple energy sources. This can\nbe applied to the study of vibrational energy transport in molecules. The curl\nquantum flux quantifying the nonequilibriumness and time-irreversibility is\nquantified in the coherent representation and we find the geometric description\nof the shape and polarization of the flux which provides the connection between\nthe microscopic description of quantum nonequilibriumness and the macroscopic\nobservables, i.e., correlation function. We use the Wilson loop integral to\nquantify the magnitude of curl flux, which is shown to be correlated to the\ncorrelation function as well. Coherence contribution is explicitly demonstrated\nto be non-trivial and to considerably promote the heat transport quantified by\nheat current and efficiency. This comes from the fact that coherence effect is\nmicroscopically reflected by the geometric description of the flux. To uncover\nthe effect of vibron-phonon coupling between the vibrational modes of molecular\nstretching (vibron) and the molecular chain (phonon), we further explore the\ninfluences of localization, which leads to the coherent and incoherent regimes\nthat are characterised by the current-current correlations.\n", "  New exact solutions to the field equations in the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet\nmodified theory of gravity for a 5--dimensional spherically symmetric static\ndistribution of a perfect fluid is obtained. The Frobenius method is used to\nobtain this solution in terms of an infinite series. Exact solutions are\ngenerated in terms of polynomials from the infinite series. The 5--dimensional\nEinstein solution is also found by setting the coupling constant to be zero.\nAll models admit a barotropic equation of state. Linear equations of state are\nadmitted in particular models with the energy density profile of isothermal\ndistributions. We examine the physicality of the solution by studying\ngraphically the isotropic pressure and the energy density. The model is well\nbehaved in the interior and the weak, strong and dominant energy conditions are\nsatisfied.\n", "  We present a new class of spherically symmetric spacetimes for matter\ndistributions with anisotropic pressures in the presence of an electric field.\nThe equation of state for the matter distribution is linear. A class of new\nexact solutions is found to the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations with an\nisotropic form of the line element. We achieve this by specifying particular\nforms for one of the gravitational potentials and the electric field intensity.\nWe regain the masses of the stars PSR J1614-2230, Vela X-1, PSR J1903+327, 4U\n1820-30 and SAX J1808.4-3658 for particular parameter values. A detailed\nphysical analysis for the star PSR J1614-2230 indicates that the model is well\nbehaved.\n", "  We provide new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations\nfor matter configurations with anisotropy and charge. The spacetime is static\nand spherically symmetric. A quadratic equation of state is utilised for the\nmatter distribution. By specifying a particular form for one of the\ngravitational potentials and the electric field intensity we obtain new exact\nsolutions in isotropic coordinates. In our general class of models, an earlier\nmodel with a linear equation of state is regained. For particular choices of\nparameters we regain the masses of the stars PSR J1614-2230, 4U 1608-52, PSR\nJ1903+0327, EXO 1745-248 and SAX J1808.4-3658. A comprehensive physical\nanalysis for the star PSR J1903+0327 reveals that our model is reasonable.\n", "  We investigate the structural properties of the underlying hosts of 34 blue\ncompact dwarf (BCD) galaxies with deep near-infrared (NIR) photometry. The BCD\nsample is selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy\nSurvey in the Great observatories origins Deep Survey North and South fields.\nWe extract the surface brightness profile (SBP) in the optical F 435W and NIR F\n160W bands. The SBPs of BCDs in the H band reach 26 mag arcsec^-2 at the\n3\\sigma level, which is so far the deepest NIR imaging of BCDs. Then we fit the\nSBPs with one- and two- component Sersic models. About half of the BCDs favour\nthe two-component model which significantly improves the fit quality. The\neffective radii of the underlying hosts of BCDs in the B band are smaller than\nthose of early-type dwarfs (dEs) and dwarf irregulars at a fixed luminosity.\nThis discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works. However, the\ndifference in structural parameters between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies seems\nto be less significant in the H band. Furthermore, we find a remarkable\nagreement between the underlying hosts of BCDs and dEs. All dwarf galaxies seem\nto follow a similar luminosity-radius relationship which suggests a unified\nstructural evolution for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that a possible evolution\ntrack from BCDs to dEs cannot be ruled out, with no significant change of\nstructure needed in the evolutionary scenario.\n", "  We comment on the investigation of the connection between chaos and\ndynamically generated entanglement in Phys. Rev. E, \\textbf{83}, 016207,\n(2011). While, in the referred paper, the authors give an explicit example of a\nstate initially localized in the regular region and still has entanglement\nproperties similar to the states localized in the chaotic region, a few\nclarifications related to previous works are in order. Firstly, it is crucial\nto point out that such a behavior can occur for states initially localized near\nthe border between the chaotic region and regular island, which seems to be the\ncase in the example provided in the referred paper. We comment on the time\nevolution of such states and the extent to which these can be regarded as\nhaving \"regular dynamics\". Secondly, the degree to which entanglement is\ncorrelated with the chaos in the system is better understood when we analyze\nthe same initial state and increase the chaoticity in the system gradually. We\nalso discuss in what capacity entanglement can be regarded as a signature of\nchaos in such studies.\n", "  Measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution over\ncosmic time. Radio continuum observations can provide key information on these\ntwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jets\nin AGN, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formation\nrates. In this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 MHz for a\nsample of AGN and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio survey\nconducted with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), with optical imaging\nand redshifts from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the\nradio luminosity function at 325 MHz for star-forming galaxies closely follows\nthat measured at 1.4 GHz. By fitting the AGN radio luminosity function out to\n$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\\Phi}\n\\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \\pm 0.95$\nassuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \\pm 1.96$ assuming pure\nluminosity evolution. We find that the Low Excitation Radio Galaxies are the\ndominant population in space density at lower luminosities. Comparing our 325\nMHz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 GHz, we determine separate\nradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum AGN, and show that the\nbeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted in\nnumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population of\nsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification of\nAGN.\n", "  Speckled images of a binary broad band light source (600-670 nm), generated\nby randomized reflections or transmissions, were used to reconstruct a binary\nimage by use of multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithms. Craft store glitter\nwas used as reflective elements. Another experiment used perforated foil. Also\nreported here are numerical models that afforded controlled tip-tilt and piston\naberrations. These results suggest the potential importance of a poorly\nfigured, randomly varying segmented imaging system.\n", "  We study the radio properties at 1.4 GHz of Seyfert galaxies with strong\nforbidden high-ionization lines (FHILs), selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey - a large-sized sample containing nearly equal proportion of diverse\nrange of Seyfert galaxies showing similar redshift distributions compiled by\nGelbord et al. (2009) using the Very Large Array survey images. The radio\ndetection rate is low, 49%, which is lower than the detection rate of several\nother known Seyfert galaxy samples. These galaxies show low star formation\nrates and the radio emission is dominated by the active nucleus with $\\le$10%\ncontribution from thermal emission, and possibly, none show evidence for\nrelativistic beaming. The radio detection rate, distributions of radio power,\nand correlations between radio power and line luminosities or X-ray luminosity\nfor narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1), Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies are\nconsistent with the predictions of the unified scheme hypothesis. Using\ncorrelation between radio and [O\\,III]\\,$\\lambda$ \\,5007\\,\\AA\\ luminosities, we\nshow that $\\sim$8% sample sources are radio-intermediate and the remaining are\nradio-quiet. There is possibly an ionization stratification associated with\nclouds on scales of 0.1-1.0 kpc, which have large optical depths at 1.4 GHz,\nand it seems these clouds are responsible for free-free absorption of radio\nemission from the core, hence, leading to low radio detection rate for these\nFHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxies.\n", "  We investigate proper affine symmetry for the Kantowski-Sachs and Bianchi\ntype III space-times by using holonomy and decomposability, the rank of the 6X6\nRiemann matrix and direct integration techniques. It is shown that the very\nspecial classes of the above space-times admit proper affine vector fields.\n", "  We present a rigorous study of the classical scattering for anytwo-body\ninter-particle potential of the form $v(r)=g/r^\\gamma$,\nwith$\\gamma\\textgreater{}0$, for repulsive ($g\\textgreater{}0$) and attractive\n($g\\textless{}0$)interactions. We give a derivation of the complete power\nseries of thedeflection angle in terms of the impact factor for the weak\nscatteringregime (large impact factors) as well as the asymptotic\nexpressionsfor the hard scattering regime (small impact factors). We see a\nverydifferent qualitative and quantitative behavior depending whether\ntheinteraction is repulsive or attractive. In the latter case, thefamilies of\ntrajectories depend also strongly on the value of$\\gamma$. We also study\ncarefully the modifications of the resultswhen a regularization is introduced\nin the potential at small scales.We check and illustrate all the results with\nthe exact integration ofthe equations of motion.\n", "  We report near room temperature ferromagnetic as well as low temperature\nantiferromagnetic correlations in Mn doped Cobalt Tellurate (CMTO) solid\nsolutions using thorough magnetization studies. For all the composition the\nsolid solutions show not only short range robust FM order at 185 K but also\nshow long range enhanced AFM order less than or equal to 45 K. Scaling of\ninverse magnetic susceptibility data provide clear indication of Griffiths like\nFM phase extended over large thermal region and its robustness against magnetic\nfield. Variations in both the phases as a function of Mn concentration also\nsupport our observation of anomalous behavior in the average bond distances and\ncharge states (JAP 116: 074904 (2014)). Further an attempt towards the\nstructural insight into the observed complex magnetic behavior by using network\nlike structural analysis has been drawn. These observations make this an\ninteresting magnetic system from fundamental and application perspective.\n", "  Magnetoquantum oscillations of resistance as functions of the potential\ndifference applied across the contact are studied for metallic point contacts\nmade of $Al$ and $Be$. The amplitude of resistance oscillations in a magnetic\nfield increases with voltage and is identical to the EPI spectrum of the point\ncontact for one group of contacts, and with the bias voltage across the contact\nfor another. The increase in the oscillation amplitude as well as its decrease\nhas a nonmonotonic dependence on energy. The scattering of electrons by\nnonequilibrium phonons and the Fermi-liquid effects in the nonequilibrium\nelectron system are considered as the possible reasons behind the observed\neffects.\n", "  A quantum state represents neither properties of a physical system nor\nanyone's knowledge of its properties. The important question is not what\nquantum states represent but how they are used---as informational bridges.\nKnowing about some physical situations (its backing conditions), an agent may\nassign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical\nsituations (its advice conditions). Quantum states are objective: only\nexpectations based on correct state assignments are generally reliable. If a\nquantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations\nbetween its backing conditions and its advice conditions. This paper offers an\naccount of quantum states and their function as informational bridges, in\nquantum teleportation and elsewhere.\n", "  We review recent advances in the shell model Monte Carlo approach for the\nmicroscopic calculation of statistical and collective properties of nuclei. We\ndiscuss applications to the calculation of (i) level densities in nickel\nisotopes, implementing a recent method to circumvent the odd-particle sign\nproblem; (ii) state densities in heavy nuclei; (iii) spin distributions of\nnuclear levels; and (iv) finite-temperature quadrupole distributions.\n", "  The configuration-interaction shell model approach provides an attractive\nframework for the calculation of nuclear level densities in the presence of\ncorrelations, but the large dimensionality of the model space has hindered its\napplication in mid-mass and heavy nuclei. The shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC)\nmethod permits calculations in model spaces that are many orders of magnitude\nlarger than spaces that can be treated by conventional diagonalization methods.\nWe discuss recent progress in the SMMC approach to level densities, and in\nparticular the calculation of level densities in heavy nuclei. We calculate the\ndistribution of the axial quadrupole operator in the laboratory frame at finite\ntemperature and demonstrate that it is a model-independent signature of\ndeformation in the rotational invariant framework of the shell model. We\npropose a method to use these distributions for calculating level densities as\na function of intrinsic deformation.\n", "  BICEP3 is a $550~mm$ aperture telescope with cold, on-axis, refractive optics\ndesigned to observe at the $95~GHz$ band from the South Pole. It is the newest\nmember of the BICEP/Keck family of inflationary probes specifically designed to\nmeasure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at\ndegree-angular scales. BICEP3 is designed to house 1280 dual-polarization\npixels, which, when fully-populated, totals to $\\sim$9$\\times$ the number of\npixels in a single Keck $95~GHz$ receiver, thus further advancing the\nBICEP/Keck program's $95~GHz$ mapping speed. BICEP3 was deployed during the\naustral summer of 2014-2015 with 9 detector tiles, to be increased to its full\ncapacity of 20 in the second season. After instrument characterization\nmeasurements were taken, CMB observation commenced in April 2015. Together with\nmulti-frequency observation data from Planck, BICEP2, and the Keck Array,\nBICEP3 is projected to set upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio to $r$\n$\\lesssim 0.03$ at $95\\%$ C.L..\n", "  The laws of quantum physics place a limit on the speed of computation, in\nparticular the evolution time of a system cannot be arbitrarily fast. Bounds on\nthe speed of evolution for unitary dynamics have been long studied. A few\nbounds on the speed of evolution for noisy dynamics have also been obtained\nrecently, these bounds, however, are in general not tight. In this article we\npresent a new framework for quantum speed limit of noisy dynamics. With this\nframework we obtain the exact maximal angle that a noisy dynamics can achieve\nat any given time, this then provides tight bounds on the evolution time for\nnoisy dynamics. The obtained bound reveals that noisy dynamics are generically\ndifferent from unitary dynamics, in particular we show that the\n'orthogonalization' time, which is the minimum time needed to evolve any state\nto its orthogonal states, is in general not applicable to noisy dynamics.\n", "  The amplitude of magnetoresistance quantum oscillations of Al and Be point\ncontacts in a magnetic field parallel to the contact axis has been studied as a\nfunction of voltage applied over the contact. It was found that for one group\nof contacts the oscillation amplitude nonmonotonously increases with the bias\nvoltage increase, while for the other part of the contacts a decrease of\namplitude was observed. The scattering of electrons with nonequilibrium phonons\nand also phonon-phonon collisions will be discussed as the possible reasons of\nthe observed effects.\n", "  A robust nanoelectromechanical switch is proposed based upon an asymmetric\npendant moiety anchored to an organic backbone between two C60 fullerenes,\nwhich in turn are connected to gold electrodes. Ab initio density functional\ncalculations are used to demonstrate that an electric field induces rotation of\nthe pendant group, leading to a non-linear current-voltage relation. The\nnon-linearity is strong enough to lead to negative differential resistance at\nmodest source-drain voltages.\n", "  Provided the electrical properties of electro-burnt graphene junctions can be\nunderstood and controlled, they have the potential to underpin the development\nof a wide range of future sub-10nm electrical devices. We examine both\ntheoretically and experimentally the electrical conductance of electro-burnt\ngraphene junctions at the last stages of nanogap formation. We account for the\nappearance of a counterintuitive increase in electrical conductance just before\nthe gap forms. This is a manifestation of room-temperature quantum interference\nand arises from a combination of the semi-metallic band structure of graphene\nand a crossover from electrodes with multiple-path connectivity to single-path\nconnectivity just prior to breaking. Therefore our results suggest that\nconductance enlargement prior to junction rupture is a signal of the formation\nof electro-burnt junctions, with a pico-scale current path formed from a single\nsp2-bond.\n", "  We investigate the molecular sensing properties of carbon nanotube-boron\nnitride-carbon nanotube (CNT-BN-CNT) junctions. We demonstrate that the\nelectrical conductance of such a junction changes in response to the binding of\nan analyte molecule to the region of BN. The change in conductance depends on\nthe length of the BN spacer and the position of the analyte and therefore we\npropose a method of statistically analysing conductance data. We demonstrate\nthe ability to discriminate between analytes, by computing the conductance\nchanges due to three analytes (benzene, thiol-capped oligoyne and a\npyridyl-capped oligoyne) binding to junctions with five different lengths of BN\nspacer.\n", "  The solid-state structures of organic charge transfer (CT) salts are critical\nin determining their mode of charge transport, and hence their unusual\nelectrical properties, which range from semiconducting through metallic to\nsuperconducting. In contrast, using both theory and experiment, we show here\nthat the conductance of metal | single molecule | metal junctions involving\naromatic donor moieties (dialkylterthiophene, dialkylbenzene) increase by over\nan order of magnitude upon formation of charge transfer (CT) complexes with\ntetracyanoethylene (TCNE). This enhancement occurs because CT complex formation\ncreates a new resonance in the transmission function, close to the metal\ncontact Fermi energy, that is a signal of room-temperature quantum\ninterference.\n", "  This tutorial outlines the basic theoretical concepts and tools which\nunderpin the fundamentals of phase-coherent electron transport through single\nmolecules. The key quantity of interest is the transmission coefficient T(E),\nwhich yields the electrical conductance, current-voltage relations, the\nthermopower S and the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of single-molecule\ndevices. Since T(E) is strongly affected by quantum interference (QI), three\nmanifestations of QI in single-molecules are discussed, namely Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometry, Breit-Wigner resonances and Fano resonances. A simple MATLAB\ncode is provided, which allows the novice reader to explore QI in\nmulti-branched structures described by a tight-binding (Huckel) Hamiltonian.\nMore generally, the strengths and limitations of materials-specific transport\nmodelling based on density functional theory are discussed.\n", "  Long-range climate forecasts use integrated assessment models to link the\nglobal economy to greenhouse gas emissions. This paper evaluates an alternative\neconomic framework outlined in part 1 of this study (Garrett, 2014) that\napproaches the global economy using purely physical principles rather than\nexplicitly resolved societal dynamics. If this model is initialized with\neconomic data from the 1950s, it yields hindcasts for how fast global economic\nproduction and energy consumption grew between 2000 and 2010 with skill scores\n> 90 % relative to a model of persistence in trends. The model appears to\nattain high skill partly because there was a strong impulse of discovery of\nfossil fuel energy reserves in the mid-twentieth century that helped\ncivilization to grow rapidly as a deterministic physical response. Forecasting\nthe coming century may prove more of a challenge because the effect of the\nenergy impulse appears to have nearly run its course. Nonetheless, an\nunderstanding of the external forces that drive civilization may help\ndevelopment of constrained futures for the coupled evolution of civilization\nand climate during the Anthropocene.\n", "  While a bit is the fundamental unit of binary classical information, a qubit\nis the fundamental unit of quantum information. In quantum information\nprocessing (QIP), it is customary to call the qubits under study as system\nqubits, and the additional qubits as ancillary qubits. In this thesis, I\ndescribe various schemes to exploit the ancillary qubits to efficiently perform\nmany QIP tasks and their experimental demonstrations in nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) systems. Particularly, we have showed that, in the presence of\nsufficient ancillary qubits, it is possible to completely characterize a\ngeneral quantum state as well as a general quantum dynamics in a single\nmeasurement. In addition, it is also possible to exploit ancillary qubits for\nrealizing noninvasive quantum measurements required for several experiments\nrelated to quantum physics. I will also illustrate some interesting\napplications of ancillary qubits in spectroscopy. At last, I describe an\nexperimental study of the efficiency of various dynamical decoupling sequences\nfor suppressing decoherence of single as well as multiple quantum coherences on\nlarge spin-clusters. The experiments reveal the superior performance of the\nrecently introduced RUDD sequences in suppressing decoherence.\n", "  Northern Illinois University in collaboration with Fermi National Accelerator\nLaboratory (FNAL) and Delhi University has been designing and building a proton\nCT scanner for applications in proton treatment planning. The Phase II proton\nCT scanner consists of eight planes of tracking detectors with two X and two Y\ncoordinate measurements both before and after the patient. In addition, a range\nstack detector consisting of a stack of thin scintillator tiles, arranged in\ntwelve eight-tile frames, is used to determine the water equivalent path length\n(WEPL) of each track through the patient. The X-Y coordinates and WEPL are\nrequired input for image reconstruction software to find the relative (proton)\nstopping powers (RSP) value of each voxel in the patient and generate a\ncorresponding 3D image. In this Note we describe tests conducted in 2015 at the\nproton beam at the Central DuPage Hospital in Warrenville, IL, focusing on the\nrange stack calibration procedure and comparisons with the GEANT~4 range stack\nsimulation.\n", "  Gravitational lensing is a fundamental tool for cosmology. A recent\ninstrument which will provide more information for models of these objects is\nALMA. Our goal is to select lens candidates to observe with ALMA and then model\nthem using GravLens Software. We had selected 12 quadruple images systems from\nthe CASTLES database, which show a high probability of observing extended\nsources in the submillimetric range. These new data will allow us to improve\nexisting models.\n  Las lentes gravitatorias son una herramienta fundamental para la\ncosmolog\\'ia.

Estos nuevos datos nos permitir\\'an\nmejorar los modelos exitentes para dichos sistemas.\n", "  We propose a plasmonic device consisting of a concentric ring grating acting\nas an efficient tool for directional launching and detection of surface\nplasmon-polaritons (SPPs). Numerical simulations and optical characterizations\nare used to study the fabricated structured gold surface. We demonstrate that\nthis circularly symmetrical plasmonic device provides an efficient interface\nbetween free space radiation and SPPs. This structure offers an excellent\nplatform for the study of hybrid plasmonics in general and of plasmon-emitter\ncouplings in particular, such as those occurring when exciting dye molecules\nplaced inside the ring. As illustrated in this work, an interesting property of\nthe device is that the position of excitation determines the direction of\npropagation of the SPPs, providing a flexible mean of studying their\ninteractions with molecules or dipole-like emitters placed on the surface.\n", "  Increasingly there is a need to develop astronomical visualisation and\nmanipulations tools which allow viewers to interact with displayed data\ndirectly, in real time and across a range of platforms. In addition, increases\nin dynamic range available for astronomical images with next generation\ntelescopes have led to a desire to develop enhanced visualisations capable of\npresenting information across a wide range of intensities. This paper describes\nthree new tools for astronomical visualisation and image manipulation that are\nthe result of a collaboration between software engineers and radio astronomers.\nThe first tool, FITS3D, is a fast, interactive 3D data cube viewer designed to\nallow real-time interactive comparisons of multiple spectral line data cubes\nsimultaneously. It features region specific selection manipulation including\nsmoothing. The second tool, FITS2D, aids the visualisation and manipulation of\n2D fits images. The tool supports the interactive creation of free-form masks\nwhich allow the user to extract any (potentially non-contiguous) subset of a\nfits image. It also supports annotations which can be placed without affecting\nthe underlying data. The final tool is an R package for applying high dynamic\nrange compression techniques to 2D fits images. This allows the full range of\npixel brightness to be imaged in a single image, simultaneously showing the\ndetail in bright sources while preserving the distinction of faint sources.\nHere we will present these three tools and demonstrate their capability using\nimages from a range of astronomical images.\n", "  We present an algorithm capable of detecting diffuse, dim sources of any size\nin an astronomical image. These sources often defeat traditional methods for\nsource finding, which expand regions around points of high intensity. Extended\nsources often have no bright points and are only detectable when viewed as a\nwhole, so a more sophisticated approach is required. Our algorithm operates at\nall scales simultaneously by considering a tree of nested candidate bounding\nboxes, and inverts a hierarchical Bayesian generative model to obtain the\nprobability of sources existing at given locations and sizes. This model\nnaturally accommodates the detection of nested sources, and no prior knowledge\nof the distribution of a source, or even the background, is required. The\nalgorithm scales nearly linear with the number of pixels making it feasible to\nrun on large images, and requires minimal parameter tweaking to be effective.\nWe demonstrate the algorithm on several types of astronomical and artificial\nimages.\n", "  F-theory, as Theory of Everything is compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds or\nfourfolds. Using toric approximation of Batyrev and mirror symmetry of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds it is possible to present Calabi-Yau in the form of dual\ninteger polyhedra. With the help of Gelfand, Zelevinsky, Kapranov algorithm\nwere calculated the numbers of BPS-states in F-theory, and by application of\nTate algorithm were determined the enhanced symmetries. As the result, any\nintegral dual polyhedron representing a Calabi-Yau manifold, is characterized\nby its own set of topological invariants - the numbers of BPS states, whose\ncentral charges are classified by enhanced symmetries.\n", "  We present Bell-type tests of nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity for\nsingle-mode fields employing a generalized quasiprobability function. Our\nnonclassicality tests are based on the observation that two orthogonal\nquadratures in phase space (position and momentum) behave as independent\nrealistic variables for a coherent state. Taking four (three) points at the\nvertices of a rectangle (right triangle) in phase space, our tests detect every\npure nonclassical Gaussian state and a range of mixed Gaussian states. These\ntests also set an upper bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, which\nthereby provide criteria for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity. We optimize the\nnon-Gaussianity tests by employing a squeezing transformation in phase space\nthat converts a rectangle (right triangle) to a parallelogram (triangle), which\nenlarges the set of non-Gaussian states detectable in our formulation. We\naddress fundamental and practical limits of our generalized phase-space tests\nby looking into their relation with decoherence under a lossy Gaussian channel\nand their robustness against finite data and nonoptimal choice of phase-space\npoints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our parallelogram test can identify\nuseful resources for nonlocality testing in phase space.\n", "  The paper deals with dynamical system analysis of a coupled scalar field in\nthe Randall-Sundrum(RS)2 brane world. The late time attractor describes the\nfinal state of the cosmic evolution. In RS2 based phantom model there is no\nlate-time attractor and consequently there is uncertainty in cosmic evolution.\nIn this paper, we have shown that it is possible to get late-time attractor\nwhen gravity is coupled to scalar field. Finally, in order to predict the final\nevolution of the universe, we have also studied classical stability of the\nmodel. It is found that there are late time attractors which are both locally\nas well as classically stable and so our model can realise the late time cosmic\nacceleration.\n", "  Sparsification reduces the size of networks while preserving structural and\nstatistical properties of interest. Various sparsifying algorithms have been\nproposed in different contexts. We contribute the first systematic conceptual\nand experimental comparison of \\textit{edge sparsification} methods on a\ndiverse set of network properties. It is shown that they can be understood as\nmethods for rating edges by importance and then filtering globally or locally\nby these scores. We show that applying a local filtering technique improves the\npreservation of all kinds of properties. In addition, we propose a new\nsparsification method (\\textit{Local Degree}) which preserves edges leading to\nlocal hub nodes. All methods are evaluated on a set of social networks from\nFacebook, Google+, Twitter and LiveJournal with respect to network properties\nincluding diameter, connected components, community structure, multiple node\ncentrality measures and the behavior of epidemic simulations. In order to\nassess the preservation of the community structure, we also include experiments\non synthetically generated networks with ground truth communities. Experiments\nwith our implementations of the sparsification methods (included in the\nopen-source network analysis tool suite NetworKit) show that many network\nproperties can be preserved down to about 20\\% of the original set of edges for\nsparse graphs with a reasonable density. The experimental results allow us to\ndifferentiate the behavior of different methods and show which method is\nsuitable with respect to which property. While our Local Degree method is best\nfor preserving connectivity and short distances, other newly introduced local\nvariants are best for preserving the community structure.\n", "  We consider a one-parameter family of nonlinear coherent states by replacing\nthe factorial in coefficients of the canonical coherent states by a specific\ngeneralized factorial depending on a parameter gamma. These states are\nsuperposition of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with a symmetric Poschl-Teller\npotential depending on a parameter nu > 1. The associated Bargmann-type\ntransform is defined for equal parameters. Some results on the infinite square\nwell potential are also derived. For some different values of gamma, we discuss\ntwo sets of orthogonal polynomials that are naturally attached to these\ncoherent states.\n", "  Effective gravitational field theories with background fields break local\nLorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. Examples include Chern-Simons\ngravity, massive gravity, and the Standard-Model Extension (SME). The physical\nproperties and behavior of these theories depend greatly on whether the\nspacetime symmetry breaking is explicit or spontaneous. With explicit breaking,\nthe background fields are fixed and nondynamical, and the resulting theories\nare fundamentally different from Einstein's General Relativity (GR). However,\nwhen the symmetry breaking is spontaneous, the background fields are dynamical\nin origin, and many of the usual features of Einstein's GR still apply.\n", "  Maximum entropy estimation is of broad interest for inferring properties of\nsystems across many different disciplines. In this work, we significantly\nextend a technique we previously introduced for estimating the maximum entropy\nof a set of random discrete variables when conditioning on bivariate mutual\ninformations and univariate entropies. Specifically, we show how to apply the\nconcept to continuous random variables and vastly expand the types of\ninformation-theoretic quantities one can condition on. This allows us to\nestablish a number of significant advantages of our approach over existing\nones. Not only does our method perform favorably in the undersampled regime,\nwhere existing methods fail, but it also can be dramatically less\ncomputationally expensive as the cardinality of the variables increases. In\naddition, we propose a nonparametric formulation of connected informations and\ngive an illustrative example showing how this agrees with the existing\nparametric formulation in cases of interest. We further demonstrate the\napplicability and advantages of our method to real world systems for the case\nof resting-state human brain networks. Finally, we show how our method can be\nused to estimate the structural network connectivity between interacting units\nfrom observed activity and establish the advantages over other approaches for\nthe case of phase oscillator networks as a generic example.\n", "  The LHCb experiment covers a unique region of acceptance at forward\nrapidities in the high energy proton-proton collisions of the LHC. This means\nthat measurements of particle production in LHCb are directly sensitive to the\nparton distribution functions at low Bj\\\"orken-$x$ values. Several measurements\nof inclusive $W$ and $Z/\\gamma^{\\ast}$ production with the Run-I dataset are\nreported in these proceedings. Further measurements of $W$ and\n$Z/\\gamma^{\\ast}$ production in association with inclusive jets and $b$- and\n$c$-tagged jets are also reported.\n", "  The study of $CP$ violation in the beauty hadron sector is a promising\napproach to search for the effects of physics beyond the Standard Model.\nSeveral recent measurements in this area from the LHCb experiment are reported\nin these proceedings. These are based on the Run-I dataset of 3~fb$^{-1}$ of\ndata collected at proton-proton centre of mass energies of 7 and 8~TeV.\n", "  Finite-time thermodynamics provides the means to revisit ideal thermodynamic\nequilibrium processes in the light of reality and investigate the energetic\n\"price of haste\", i.e. the consequences of carrying out a process in finite\ntime, when perfect equilibrium cannot be awaited due to economic reasons or the\nnature of the process. Employing the formalism of geometric thermodynamics, a\nlower bound on the energy dissipated during a process is derived from the\nthermodynamic length of that process. The notion of length is hereby defined\nvia a metric structure on the space of equilibrium thermodynamics, spanned by a\nset of thermodynamic variables describing the system. Since the aim of\nfinite-time thermodynamics is to obtain realistic limitations on idealized\nscenarios, it is a useful tool to reassess the efficiency of thermodynamic\nprocesses. We examine its implications for black hole thermodynamics, in\nparticular scenarios inspired by the Penrose process, a thought experiment by\nwhich work can be extracted from a rotating black hole. We consider a Kerr\nblack hole which, by some mechanism, is losing mass and angular momentum.\nThermodynamically speaking, such a process is described in the equilibrium\nphase space of the black hole, but in reality, it is neither reversible nor\ninfinitely slow. We thus calculate the dissipated energy due to non-ideal\nfinite-time effects.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) gamma-boron ({\\gamma}-B28) thin films have been firstly\nreported by the experiments of the chemical vapor deposition in the latest\nstudy [Tai et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 54, 1-6 (2015)]. However, their\nmechanical properties are still not clear. Here we predict the superhigh moduli\n(1460 GPa at 1 K and 744 GPa at 300 K) and the tension-induced phase transition\nof monolayer {\\gamma}-B28 along a zigzag direction for large deformations at\nfinite temperatures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The new phase\ncan be kept stable after unloading process at these temperatures. The predicted\nmechanical properties are reasonable with our results from density functional\ntheory. This study provides physical insights into the origins of the new phase\ntransition of monolayer {\\gamma}-B28 at finite temperatures.\n", "  Many delayed-choice experiments based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI)\nhave been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle\nduality. Conventional wisdoms long hold that by inserting or removing the\nsecond beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles\n(photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum\nsuperposition of the wave and particle state as\n\\psi=a_w\\psi_wave+a_p\\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative\ninterpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all\ncomposite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and\nremoving operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian\nH_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and\nH_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution\nof this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum\neigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as\n\\psi_mod=a(t)\\psi_wave+b(t)\\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of\nparticle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the\nwave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and\naveraged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new\nlight on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle\nduality and principle of complementarity.\n", "  The Neptune Trojans are the most recent addition to the panoply of Solar\nsystem small body populations. The orbit of the first discovered member, 2001\nQR$_{322}$, was investigated shortly after its discovery, based on early\nobservations of the object, and it was found to be dynamically stable on\ntimescales comparable to the age of the Solar system.\n  As further observations were obtained of the object over the following years,\nthe best-fit solution for its orbit changed. We therefore carried out a new\nstudy of 2001 QR$_{322}$'s orbit in 2010, finding that it lay on the boundary\nbetween dynamically stable and unstable regions in Neptune's Trojan cloud, and\nconcluding that further observations were needed to determine the true\nstability of the object's orbit.\n  Here we follow up on that earlier work, and present the preliminary results\nof a dynamical study using an updated fit to 2001 QR$_{322}$'s orbit. Despite\nthe improved precision with which the orbit of 2001 QR$_{322}$ is known, we\nfind that the best-fit solution remains balanced on a knife-edge, lying between\nthe same regions of stability and instability noted in our earlier work. In the\nfuture, we intend to carry out new observations that should hopefully refine\nthe orbit to an extent that its true nature can finally be disentangled.\n", "  This paper addresses recent experimental findings about luminescence of a\ngold tip in near-field interaction with a gold surface. Our electrochemically\netched gold tips show a typical, intrinsic luminescence that we exploit to\ntrack the plasmon resonance modeled by a Lorentzian oscillator. Our\nexperimental device is based on a spectrometer optically coupled to an atomic\nforce microscope used in tuning fork mode. Our measurements provide evidence of\na strong optical coupling between the tip and the surface. We demonstrate that\nthis coupling strongly affects the luminescence (Intensity, wavelength and\nFHWM) as a function of the tip position in 2D maps. The fluctuation of these\nparameters is directly related to the plasmonic properties of the gold surface\nand is used to qualify the optical near field enhancement (which subsequently\nplays the predominant role in surface enhanced spectroscopies) with a very high\nspatial resolution (typically around 20 nm). We compare these findings to the\nindependently recorded near-field scattered elastic Rayleigh signal.\n", "  Endohedral molecular magnets, e.g. as realized in fullerenes containing $\\rm\nDySc_{2}N$, are promising candidates for molecular electronics and quantum\ninformation processing. For their functionalization an ultrafast local\nmagnetization control is essential. Using full ab-initio quantum chemistry\ncalculations we predict the emergence of charge current loops in fullerenes\nwith an associated orbital magnetic moment upon irradiation with weak light\nvortex pulses that transfer orbital angular momentum. The generated current is\ncontrollable by the frequency, the vortex topological charge, and the intensity\nof the light. Numerical and analytical results show that an ultraviolet vortex\nfemtosecond pulse with an intensity $\\sim10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$ generates\nnon-invasively nA unidirectional surface current with an associated magnetic\nfield of hundreds $\\mu$T at the center of the fullerene.\n", "  The effect of contact architecture, graphene defect density and\nmetal-semiconductor work function difference on resistivity of metal-graphene\ncontacts have been investigated. An architecture with metal on the bottom of\ngraphene is found to yield resistivities that are lower, by a factor of 4, and\nmost consistent as compared to metal on top of graphene. Growth defects in\ngraphene film were found to further reduce resistivity by a factor of 2. Using\na combination of method and metal used, the contact resistivity of graphene has\nbeen decreased by a factor of 10 to 1200 +- 250 Ohm-um using Palladium as the\ncontact metal. While the improved consistency is due to the metal being able to\ncontact uncontaminanted graphene in the metal on the bottom architecture, lower\ncontact resistivities observed on defective graphene with the same metal is\nattributed to the increased number of modes of quantum transport in the\nchannel.\n", "  We propose a method of construction of a normalized vibrational Hamiltonian\nof a highly excited molecular system with $n$ degrees of freedom in the case of\na a $p:q$ resonance. We present also the counting of all the independent\noperators and the counting of all the parameters included in the Hamiltonian\n(Counting theorems 1 to 8). The method introduces, on a systematic way, all the\noperators, in particular the coupling operators, that can be built from the\npolynomials formed by products of powers of the generators of a Lie algebra:\nthe algebra of the invariant polynomials built in classical mechanics from the\nthe kernel $Ker \\,ad_{\\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ of the adjoint operator\n$ad_{\\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ (see [6] or [4],[5]). Application to the non-linear\ntriatomic molecule ClOH is then given, taking into account the Fermi resonance\nbetween the O-Cl stretching oscillators and the bending motion. The study of\nthis molecular system in highly excited vibrational states (until almost the\ndissociation limit) has been realized in [2], with a fit of 725 levels of\nenergy. On the 86 coefficients (among which 31 coupling coefficients) that we\ncount, and completely compatible with [2], the smallest rms value leads to keep\nonly 28 non-zero coefficients. In the appendix, we explain the vocabulary and\nthe strategy employed in order to demonstrate the theorems of coupling\noperators included in the Hamiltonian.\n", "  Spin excitations were studied by absorption spectroscopy in CaBaCo4O7 which\nis a type-I multiferroic compound with the largest magnetic-order induced\nferroelectric polarization ({\\Delta}P=17mC/m2) reported, so far. We observed\ntwo optical magnon branches: a solely electric dipole allowed one and a mixed\nmagnetoelectric resonance. The entangled magnetization and polarization\ndynamics of the magnetoelectric resonance gives rise to unidirectional light\nabsorption, i.e. that magnon mode absorbs the electromagnetic radiation for one\npropagation direction but not for the opposite direction. Our systematic study\nof the magnetic field and temperature dependence of magnon modes provides\ninformation about the energies and symmetries of spin excitations, which is\nrequired to develop a microscopic spin model of CaBaCo4O7.\n", "  A model binary hybrid system composed of a randomly distributed rare-earth\nferromagnetic (Gd) part embedded in an s-wave superconducting (Nb) matrix is\nbeing manufactured to study the interplay between competing superconducting and\nferromagnetic order parameters. The normal metallic to superconducting phase\ntransition appears to be very sensitive to the magnetic counterpart and the\nmodulation of the superconducing properties follow closely to the\nAbrikosov-Gorkov (AG) theory of magnetic impurity induced pair breaking\nmechanism. A critical concentration of Gd is obtained for the studied NbGd\nbased composite films (CFs) above which superconductivity disappears. Besides,\na magnetic ordering resembling the paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) appears\nin DC magnetization measurements at temperatures close to the superconducting\ntransition temperature. The positive magnetization related to the PME emerges\nupon doping Nb with Gd. The temperature dependent resistance measurements\nevolve in a similar fashion with the concentration of Gd as that with an\nexternal magnetic field and in both the cases, the transition curves accompany\nseveral intermediate features indicating the traces of magnetism originated\neither from Gd or from the external field. Finally, the signatures of magnetism\nappear evidently in the magnetization and transport measurements for the CFs\nwith very low (less than 1 at. %) doping of Gd.\n", "  Let $a = a(\\xi), \\xi\\in\\mathbb R,$ be a smooth function quickly decreasing at\ninfinity. For the Wiener-Hopf operator $W(a)$ with the symbol $a$, and a smooth\nfunction $g:\\mathbb C\\to~\\mathbb C$, H. Widom in 1982 established the following\ntrace formula: \\[ {\\rm tr}\\bigl(g\\bigl(W(a)\\bigr) - W(g\\circ a)\\bigr) =\n\\mathcal B(a; g), \\] where $\\mathcal B(a; g)$ is given explicitly in terms of\nthe functions $a$ and $g$. The paper analyses the coefficient $\\mathcal B(a;\ng)$ for a class of non-smooth functions $g$ assuming that $a$ is real-valued. A\nrepresentative example of one such function is $g(t) = |t|^{\\gamma}$ with some\n$\\gamma\\in (0, 1]$.\n", "  Integrable Hamiltonian systems on almost-symplectic manifolds have recently\ndrawn some attention. Under suitable properties, they have a structure\nanalogous to those of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian completely integrable\nsystems. Here we study small Hamiltonian perturbations of these systems.\nPreliminarily, we investigate some general properties of these systems. In\nparticular, we show that if the perturbation is `strongly Hamiltonian' (namely,\nits Hamiltonian vector field is also a symmetry of the almost-Hamiltonian\nstructure) then the system reduces, under an almost-symplectic version of\nsymplectic reduction, to a family of nearly integrable standard\nsymplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields on a reduced phase space, of codimension\nnot less than 3. Therefore, we restrict our study to non-strongly Hamiltonian\nperturbations. We will show that KAM theorem on the survival of strongly\nnonresonant quasi-periodic tori does non apply, but that a weak version of\nNekhoroshev theorem on the stability of actions is instead valid, even though\nfor a time scale which is polynomial (rather than exponential) in the inverse\nof the perturbation parameter.\n", "  A global intrinsic time in Friedmann - Robertson - Walker models is\nproportional to a scaling factor of the spatial metric. The aim of the paper is\nto study an applicability of the intrinsic global time chosen to nearest\nnon-symmetric cases by taking into account linear metric perturbations. Scalar\nlinear perturbations add some corrections to the effective energy density in\nthe Hubble law. The metric vector and tensor perturbations in linear\napproximation do not influence the intrinsic time.\n", "  Pulse self-compression followed by the generation of resonant radiation is a\nwell known phenomenon in non-linear optics. Resonant radiation is important as\nit allows for efficient and tunable wavelength conversion. We vary the chirp of\nthe initial pulse and find in simulations and experiments that a small positive\nchirp enhances the pulse compression and strongly increases the generation of\nresonant radiation. This result corroborates previously published simulation\nresults indicating an improved degree of pulse compression for a small positive\nchirp [1]. It also demonstrates how pulse evolution can be studied without\ncutting back the fiber.\n", "  The self-assembly of proteins into $\\beta$-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils has\nbeen observed to occur with sigmoidal kinetics, indicating that the system\ninitially is trapped in a metastable state. Here, we use a minimal\nlattice-based model to explore the thermodynamic forces driving amyloid\nformation in a finite canonical ($NVT$) system. By means of\ngeneralized-ensemble Monte Carlo techniques and a semi-analytical method, the\nthermodynamic properties of this model are investigated for different sets of\nintersheet interaction parameters. When the interactions support lateral growth\ninto multi-layered fibrillar structures, an evaporation/condensation transition\nis observed, between a supersaturated solution state and a thermodynamically\ndistinct state where small and large fibril-like species exist in equilibrium.\nIntermediate-size aggregates are statistically suppressed. These properties do\nnot hold if aggregate growth is one-dimensional.\n", "  There is a growing demand for X-ray Free-electron lasers (FELs) in various\nscience fields, in particular for those with short pulses, larger photon fluxes\nand shorter wavelengths. The level of X-ray power and the pulse energy depend\non the amount of electron bunch energy. Increasing the latter will increase the\npower of the radiating X-rays. Using numerical simulations we explore the\npossibility of using a plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) scheme to increase\nthe electron beam energy of an existing FEL facility without significantly\nincreasing the accelerator length. In this paper we use parameters of the\nSwissFEL beam. The simulations are carried out in 2D cylindrical symmetry using\nthe code OSIRIS. Initial results show an energy gain of ~2 GeV after\npropagation of 0.5 m in the plasma with a relative energy spread of ~1%.\n", "  We discuss several clues related to the possible asymptotic behavior of\nhadron interactions arising on the base of performed analysis of the recent\nTOTEM data at the LHC and emphasize that the deep-elastic scattering can\nprovide an important information on the asymptotical dependence via the\nunitarity relation.\n", "  Simple yet accurate results for radiative transfer in layered media with\ndiscontinuous refractive index are obtained by the method of K-integrals,\noriginally developed for neutron transport analysis. These are certain weighted\nintegrals applied to the angular intensity distribution at the refracting\nboundaries. The radiative intensity is expressed as the sum of the asymptotic\nangular intensity distribution valid in the depth of the scattering medium and\na transient term valid near the boundary. Integral boundary conditions are\nobtained from the vanishing of the K-integrals of the boundary transient,\nyielding simple linear equations for the intensity coefficients (two for a\nhalfspace, four for a slab or an interface), enabling the angular emission\nintensity and the diffuse reflectance (albedo) and transmittance of the\nscattering layer to be calculated. The K-integral method is orders of magnitude\nmore accurate than diffusion theory and can be applied to scattering media with\na wide range of scattering albedoes. For example, near five figure accuracy is\nobtained for the diffuse reflectance of scattering layers of refractive index n\n= 1.5 with single scattering albedo in the range 0.3 to 1\n", "  Ge/Si structures with vertically stacked quantum dots are simulated to\nimplement the basic elements of a quantum computer for operation with electron\nspin states. Elastic-strain fields are simulated using the conjugate gradient\nmethod and an atomistic model based on the Keating potential. Calculations are\nperformed in the cluster approximation using clusters containing about three\nmillion atoms belonging to 150 coordination spheres. The spatial distributions\nof the strain energy density and electron potential energy are calculated for\ndifferent valleys forming the bottom of the silicon conduction band. It is\nshown that the development of multilayer structures with vertically stacked\nquantum dots makes it possible to fabricate deep potential wells for electrons\nwith vertical tunnel coupling.\n", "  We perform tilt-field transport experiment on inverted InAs/GaSb which hosts\nquantum spin Hall insulator. By means of coincidence method, Landau level (LL)\nspectra of electron and hole carriers are systematically studied at different\ncarrier densities tuned by gate voltages. When Fermi level stays in the\nconduction band, we observe LL crossing and anti-crossing behaviors at odd and\neven filling factors respectively, with a corresponding g-factor of 11.5. It\nremains nearly constant for varying filling factors and electron densities. On\nthe contrary, for GaSb holes only a small Zeeman splitting is observed even at\nlarge tilt angles, indicating a g-factor of less than 3.\n", "  In this short note we argue that Thomas-Fermi Theory the simplest of all\ndensity functional theories, although failing to explain features such as\nbinding or stability of negative ions, is surprisingly accurate in estimating\nsizes of atoms. We give both numerical, experimental and rigorous mathematical\nevidence for this claim. Motivated by this we formulate two new mathematical\nconjectures on the exactness of Thomas-Fermi Theory.\n", "  The article covers the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, weak\ndrive limit, universality, directed polymers in a random medium, replica\nsolutions, statistical mechanics of line ensembles, and its generalization to\nseveral components which is used to study equilibrium time correlations of\nanharmonic chains and of the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The\nnotes are an extended version of my lectures at Les Houches July 2015.\n", "  We investigate the combined use of a Kinect depth sensor and of a stochastic\ndata assimilation method to recover free-surface flows. More specifically, we\nuse a Weighted ensemble Kalman filter method to reconstruct the complete state\nof free-surface flows from a sequence of depth images only. This particle\nfilter accounts for model and observations errors. This data assimilation\nscheme is enhanced with the use of two observations instead of one classically.\nWe evaluate the developed approach on two numerical test cases: a collapse of a\nwater column as a toy-example and a flow in an suddenly expanding flume as a\nmore realistic flow. The robustness of the method to depth data errors and also\nto initial and inflow conditions is considered. We illustrate the interest of\nusing two observations instead of one observation into the correction step,\nespecially for unknown inflow boundary conditions. Then, the performance of the\nKinect sensor to capture temporal sequences of depth observations is\ninvestigated. Finally, the efficiency of the algorithm is qualified for a wave\nin a real rectangular flat bottom tank. It is shown that for basic initial\nconditions, the particle filter rapidly and remarkably reconstructs velocity\nand height of the free surface flow based on noisy measurements of the\nelevation alone.\n", "  In the lattice version of the multicomponent Widom-Rowlinson (WR) model, each\nsite can be either empty or singly occupied by one of $M$ different particles,\nall species having the same fugacity $z$. The only nonzero interaction\npotential is a nearest-neighbor hard-core exclusion between unlike particles.\nFor $M<M_0$ with some minimum $M_0$ dependent on the lattice structure, as $z$\nincreases from 0 to $\\infty$ there is a direct transition from the disordered\n(gas) phase to a demixed (liquid) phase with one majority component at\n$z>z_d(M)$. If $M\\ge M_0$, there is an intermediate ordered \"crystal phase\"\n(composed of two nonequivalent even and odd sublattices) for $z$ lying between\n$z_c(M)$ and $z_d(M)$ which is driven by entropy. We generalize the\nmulticomponent WR model by replacing the hard-core exclusion between unlike\nparticles by more realistic large (but finite) repulsion. The model is solved\nexactly on the Bethe lattice with an arbitrary coordination number. The\nnumerical calculations, based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization\ngroup, are performed for the two-dimensional square lattice. The results for\n$M=4$ indicate that the second-order phase transitions from the disordered gas\nto the demixed phase become of first order, for an arbitrarily large finite\nrepulsion. The results for $M\\ge M_0$ show that, as the repulsion weakens, the\nregion of crystal phase diminishes itself. For weak enough repulsions, the\ndirect transition between the crystal and demixed phases changes into a\nseparate pair of crystal-gas and gas-demixed transitions; this is an example of\na disorder-disorder reentrant transition via an ordered crystal phase. If the\nrepulsion between unlike species is too weak, the crystal phase disappears from\nthe phase diagram. It is shown that the generalized WR model belongs to the\nIsing universality class.\n", "  The Simple Image Access protocol (SIA) provides capabilities for the\ndiscovery, description, access, and retrieval of multi-dimensional image\ndatasets, including 2-D images as well as datacubes of three or more\ndimensions. SIA data discovery is based on the ObsCore Data Model (ObsCoreDM),\nwhich primarily describes data products by the physical axes (spatial,\nspectral, time, and polarization). Image datasets with dimension greater than 2\nare often referred to as datacubes, cube or image cube datasets and may be\nconsidered examples of hypercube or n-cube data. In this document the term\n\"image\" refers to general multi-dimensional datasets and is synonymous with\nthese other terms unless the image dimensionality is otherwise specified. SIA\nprovides capabilities for image discovery and access. Data discovery and\nmetadata access (using ObsCoreDM) are defined here. The capabilities for\ndrilling down to data files (and related resources) and services for remote\naccess are defined elsewhere, but SIA also allows for direct access to\nretrieval.\n", "  Vibrational spectra can be computed without storing full-dimensional vectors\nby using low-rank sum-of-products (SOP) basis functions. We introduce symmetry\nconstraints in the SOP basis functions to make it possible to separately\ncalculate states in different symmetry subgroups. This is done using a power\nmethod to compute eigenvalues and an alternating least squares method to\noptimize basis functions. Owing to the fact that the power method favours the\nconvergence of the lowest states, one must be careful not to exclude basis\nfunctions of some symmetries. Exploiting symmetry facilitates making\nassignments and improves the accuracy. The method is applied to the\nacetonitrile molecule.\n", "  We investigate the scattering of a wave packet describing low-energy\nelectrons in graphene by a time-dependent finite step potential barrier. Our\nresults demonstrate that, after Klein tunneling through the barrier, the\nelectron acquires an extra energy which depends on the rate of change the\nbarrier height in time. If such a rate is negative, the electron loses energy\nand ends up as a valence band state after leaving the barrier, which\neffectively behaves as a positively charged quasi-particle\n", "  We present preliminary results for the strange leading-order hadronic\ncontribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon using RBC/UKQCD\nphysical point domain wall fermions ensembles. We discuss various analysis\nstrategies in order to constrain the systematic uncertainty in the final\nresult.\n", "  We introduced silica nanoparticles into poly ($N$,$N$-dimethylacrylamide)\ngel, (PDAM-NC gel), and poly (acrylamide) gel (PAM-NC gel), and carried out\nSAXS measurements under uniaxial elongation. It is well known that PDAM chains\nare strongly adsorbed onto silica nanoparticles while PAM chains are not.\nInterestingly, we found from SAXS measurements that scattering profiles depend\non the polymer-nanoparticle interaction. A four-spot pattern was observed in\nthe 2D structure factors of PDAM-NC gel, which was assigned to a movement of\nthe nanoparticles affinely under elongation. However, unexpectedly, we observed\nsharp peaks in the 2D structure factors of PAM-NC gel in the parallel direction\nto the stretching. These peaks appeared in much lower-$q$ region than the\ntheoretical prediction of affine deformation of nanoparticles. We conjecture\nthat these peaks do not correspond to the correlation of individual particles\nbut to the correlation of high cross-linking regions because the interaction\nbetween PAM chains and silica nanoparticles is relatively weak and the\ndisplacements of silica nanoparticles are sensitive to spatial cross-linking\ninhomogeneity.\n", "  Propagation of an electron wave packet through a quantum point contact (QPC)\ndefined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene is investigated. The gates\nprovide a bias between the layers, in order to produce an energy gap. If the\ngates on both sides of the contact produce the same bias, steps in the electron\ntransmission probability are observed, as in the usual QPC. However, if the\nbias is inverted on one of the sides of the QPC, only electrons belonging to\none of the Dirac valleys are allowed to pass, which provides a very efficient\nvalley filtering.\n", "  The split-operator technique for wave packet propagation in quantum systems\nis expanded here to the case of propagating wave functions describing\nSchr\\\"odinger particles, namely, charge carriers in semiconductor\nnanostructures within the effective mass approximation, in the presence of\nZeeman effect, as well as of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. We\nalso demonstrate that simple modifications to the expanded technique allow us\nto calculate the time evolution of wave packets describing Dirac particles,\nwhich are relevant for the study of transport properties in graphene.\n", "  Since the first detection of intracluster planetary nebulae in 1996, imaging\nand spectroscopic surveys identified such stars to trace the radial extent and\nthe kinematics of diffuse light in clusters. This topic of research is tightly\nlinked with the studies of galaxy formation and evolution in dense environment,\nas the spatial distribution and kinematics of planetary nebulae in the\noutermost regions of galaxies and in the cluster cores is relevant for setting\nconstraints on cosmological simulations. In this sense, extragalactic planetary\nnebulae play a very important role in the near-field cosmology, in order to\nmeasure the integrated mass as function of radius and the orbital distribution\nof stars in structures placed in the densest regions of the nearby universe.\n", "  Quantum measurement principle is employed to detect water quality and\npresence of nano-colloids. The setup uses spatially low coherent light source,\nfor which the outcome of measurement is dependent on the presence of a\nreflecting surface and a linear polarizer. The introduction of a reflecting\nsurface induces enhanced side scattering. The enhancement has specific patterns\nfor pure water, ions and nanoparticles and can be employed to detect refractive\nindex of liquids at high sensitivity. The differential enhancement can be used\nas an optical magnetometer that sensitively senses magnetic moments of\ncolloidal magnetic nanoparticles at concentration untenable by other\nmeasurement techniques.\n", "  We investigate the nucleation, growth, and spatial organization of\ntopological defects with a ribbon shaped elastic sheet which is stretched and\ntwisted. Singularities are found to spontaneously arrange in a triangular\nlattice in the form of vertices connected by stretched ridges that result in a\nself-rigidified structure. The vertices are shown to be negative disclinations\nor e-cones which occur in sheets with negative Gaussian curvature, in contrast\nwith d-cones in sheets with zero-Gaussian curvature. We find the growth of the\nwrinkled width of the ribbon to be consistent with a far-from-threshold\napproach assuming a compression-free base state. The system is found to show a\ntransition from a regime where the wavelength is given by the ribbon geometry,\nto where it is given by its elasticity as a function of the ratio of the\napplied tension to the elastic modulus and cross-sectional area of the ribbon.\n", "  QCD axions with meV mass can be behind some stellar cooling anomalies and\nform all or part of the cold dark matter of the universe. We discuss on a\nproposed experiment to discover the solar flux of meV mass axions: the\nInternational AXion Observatory: IAXO.\n", "  In electronic structure calculations, various material properties can be\nobtained by means of computing the total energy of a system as well as\nderivatives of the total energy w.r.t. atomic positions. The derivatives, also\nknown as Hellman-Feynman forces, require, because of practical computational\nreasons, the discretized charge density and wave functions having continuous\nsecond derivatives in the whole solution domain. We describe an application of\nisogeometric analysis (IGA), a spline modification of finite element method\n(FEM), to achieve the required continuity. The novelty of our approach is in\nemploying the technique of B\\'ezier extraction to add the IGA capabilities to\nour FEM based code for ab-initio calculations of electronic states of\nnon-periodic systems within the density-functional framework, built upon the\nopen source finite element package SfePy. We compare FEM and IGA in benchmark\nproblems and several numerical results are presented.\n", "  Room temperature properties and behavior of several types of cryogenic\nmagnetic shielding materials are measured and reported here. Large changes in\nthe effective relative permeability are observed when the materials are\nperturbed with a relatively small mechanical stimulation. The change in\npermeability is a reversible effect.\n", "  The synthesis and physical properties of two new and one known Ir-Sn-Se\ncompound are reported. Their crystal structures are elucidated with\ntransmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. IrSn0.45Se1.55\nis a pyrite phase which consists of tilted corner-sharing IrX6 octahedra with\nrandomly distributed (Sn-Se)4- and (Se-Se)2- dimers. Ir2Sn3Se3 is a trigonally\ndistorted skutterudite that consists of cooperatively tilted corner-sharing\nIrSn3Se3 octahedra with ordered (Sn-Se)24- tetramers. Ir2SnSe5 is a layered,\ndistorted \\b{eta}-MnO2 (pyrolusite) structure consisting of a double IrSe6\noctrahedral row, corner-sharing in the a direction and edge-sharing in the b\ndirection. This distorted pyrolusite contains (Se-Se)2- dimers, Se2- anions,\nand each double row is \"capped\" with a (Sn-Se)n polymeric chain. Resistivity,\nspecific heat, and magnetization measurements show that all three have\ninsulating and diamagnetic behavior, indicative of low spin 5d6 Ir3+.\nElectronic structure calculations on Ir2Sn3Se3 show a single, spherical,\nnon-spin-orbit split valence band, and suggest that Ir2Sn3Se3 is topologically\nnon-trivial under tensile strain, due to inversion of Ir-d and Se-p states.\n", "  The unique properties of spin-polarized surface or edge states in topological\ninsulators (TIs) make these quantum coherent systems interesting from the point\nof view of both fundamental physics and their implementation in low power\nspintronic devices. Here we present such a study in TIs, through tunneling and\nnoise spectroscopy utilizing TI/Al$_2$O$_3$/Co tunnel junctions with bottom TI\nelectrodes of either Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We demonstrate that features\nrelated to the band structure of the TI materials show up in the tunneling\nconductance and even more clearly through low frequency noise measurements. The\nbias dependence of 1/f noise reveals peaks at specific energies corresponding\nto band structure features of the TI. TI tunnel junctions could thus simplify\nthe study of the properties of such quantum coherent systems, that can further\nlead to the manipulation of their spin-polarized properties for technological\npurposes.\n", "  PET/CT with F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images of patients suffering from\nmetastatic melanoma have been analysed using fractal and multifractal analysis\nto assess the impact of monoclonal antibody ipilimumab treatment with respect\nto therapy outcome. Our analysis shows that the fractal dimensions which\ndescribe the tracer dispersion in the body decrease consistently with the\ndeterioration of the patient therapeutic outcome condition. In 20 out-of 24\ncases the fractal analysis results match those of the medical records, while 7\ncases are considered as special cases because the patients have non-tumour\nrelated medical conditions or side effects which affect the results. The\ndecrease in the fractal dimensions with the deterioration of the patient\nconditions (in terms of disease progression) are attributed to the hierarchical\nlocalisation of the tracer which accumulates in the affected lesions and does\nnot spread homogeneously throughout the body. Fractality emerges as a result of\nthe migration patterns which the malignant cells follow for propagating within\nthe body (circulatory system, lymphatic system). Analysis of the multifractal\nspectrum complements and supports the results of the fractal analysis. In the\nkinetic Monte Carlo modelling of the metastatic process a small number of\nmalignant cells diffuse throughout a fractal medium representing the blood\ncirculatory network. Along their way the malignant cells engender random\nmetastases (colonies) with a small probability and, as a result, fractal\nspatial distributions of the metastases are formed similar to the ones observed\nin the PET/CT images. In conclusion, we propose that fractal and multifractal\nanalysis has potential application in the quantification of the evaluation of\nPET/CT images to monitor the disease evolution as well as the response to\ndifferent medical treatments.\n", "  In this paper we explain the diphoton excess in the invariant mass M\n$\\approx$ 750 GeV , claimed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the run-2\nLHC, as the signal of a scalar singlet in a string inspired exceptional\nsupersymmetric standard model (ESSM). The scalar singlet might play a rule in\nthe spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge symmetry of the ESSM and\ncouples to diphoton and/or gluon pair with the help of exotic quarks and\nHiggs-like supermultiplets, which are contained in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the $E_6$ group. The model might give rise to a large enough\nproduction cross section at the LHC but can hardly fit with the wide width of\nthe resonance except in the strong couple regime.\n", "  Simulation evidence of an incipient triple point is reported for xenon\nsubmonolayers adsorbed on the (111) surface of platinum. This is in stark\ncontrast to the \"normal\" triple point found in simulations and experiments for\nxenon on the basal plane surface of graphite. The motions of the atoms in the\nsurface plane are treated with standard 2D \"NVE\" molecular dynamics simulations\nusing modern interactions. The simulation evidence strongly suggests an\nincipient triple point in the 120-150 K range for adsorption on the Pt (111)\nsurface while the adsorption on graphite shows a normal triple point at about\n100 K.\n", "  Time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements on two doped graphene\nsamples displaying different doping levels reveal remarkable differences in the\nultrafast dynamics of the hot carriers in the Dirac cone. In the more strongly\n($n$-)doped graphene, we observe larger carrier multiplication factors ($>$ 3)\nand a significantly faster phonon-mediated cooling of the carriers back to\nequilibrium compared to in the less ($p$-)doped graphene. These results suggest\nthat a careful tuning of the doping level allows for an effective manipulation\nof graphene's dynamical response to a photoexcitation.\n", "  We consider a stochastic particle system in which a finite number of\nparticles interact with one another via a common energy tank. Interaction rate\nfor each particle is proportional to the square root of its kinetic energy, as\nis consistent with analogous mechanical models. Our main result is that the\nrate of convergence to equilibrium for such a system is $\\sim t^{-2}$, more\nprecisely it is faster than a constant times $t^{-2+\\varepsilon}$ for any\n$\\varepsilon>0$. A discussion of exponential vs polynomial convergence for\nsimilar particle systems is included.\n", "  In this paper we describe bistochastic Kadison-Schawrz operators acting on\n$M_2(\\mathbb{C})$. Such a description allows us to find positive, but not\nKadison-Schwarz operators. Moreover, by means of that characterization we\nconstruct Kadison-Schawrz operators, which are not completely positive.\n", "  We describe the development of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial\n(QuILT) on quantum key distribution, a context which involves a practical\napplication of quantum mechanics. The QuILT helps upper-level undergraduate\nstudents learn quantum mechanics using a simple two state system and was\ndeveloped based upon the findings of cognitive research and physics education\nresearch. One protocol used in the QuILT involves generating a random shared\nkey over a public channel for encrypting and decrypting information using\nsingle photons with non-orthogonal polarization states, and another protocol\nmakes use of two entangled spin-1/2 particles. The QuILT uses a guided approach\nand focuses on helping students build links between the formalism and\nconceptual aspects of quantum physics without compromising the technical\ncontent. We also discuss findings from a preliminary in-class evaluation.\n", "  In this report, we present the theory on aerodynamics of quadrotors using the\nwell established momentum and blade element theories. From a robotics\nperspective, the theoretical development of the models for thrust and\nhorizontal forces and torque (therefore power) are carried out in the body\nfixed frame of the quadrotor. Using momentum theory, we propose and model the\nexistence of a horizontal force along with its associated power. Given the\nlimitations associated with momentum theory and the inadequacy of the theory to\naccount for the different powers represented in a proposed bond graph lead to\nthe use of blade element theory. Using this theory, models are then developed\nfor the different quadrotor rotor geometries and aerodynamic properties\nincluding the optimum hovering rotor used on the majority of quadrotors. Though\nthis rotor is proven to be the most optimum rotor, we show that geometric\nvariations are necessary for manufacturing of the blades. The geometric\nvariations are also dictated by a desired thrust to horizontal force ratio\nwhich is based on the available motor torque (hence power) and desired flight\nenvelope of the vehicle. The detailed aerodynamic models obtained using blade\nelement theory for different geometric configurations and aerodynamic\nproperties of the aerofoil sections are then converted to lumped parameter\nmodels that can be used for robotic applications. These applications include\nbut not limited to body fixed frame velocity estimation and individual rotor\nthrust regulation [1, 2].\n", "  We numerically investigate bouncing and non-bouncing of droplets during\nisothermal impact on superhydrophobic surfaces. An in-house,\nexperimentally-validated, finite-element method based computational model is\nemployed to simulate the droplet impact dynamics and transient fluid flow\nwithin the droplet. The liquid-gas interface is tracked accurately in\nLagrangian framework with dynamic wetting boundary condition at three-phase\ncontact line. The interplay of kinetic, surface and gravitational energies is\ninvestigated via systematic variation of impact velocity and equilibrium\ncontact angle. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the droplet bounces\noff the surface if the total droplet energy at the instance of maximum\nrecoiling exceeds the initial surface and gravitational energy, otherwise not.\nThe non-bouncing droplet is characterized by the oscillations on the free\nsurface due to competition between the kinetic and surface energy. The droplet\ndimensions and shapes obtained at different times by the simulations are\ncompared with the respective measurements available in the literature.\nComparisons show good agreement of numerical data with measurements and the\ncomputational model is able to reconstruct the bouncing and non-bouncing of the\ndroplet as seen in the measurements. The simulated internal flow helps to\nunderstand the impact dynamics as well as the interplay of the associated\nenergies during the bouncing and non-bouncing.\n", "  The effect of pitch of the pillars and impact velocity are studied for the\nimpact dynamics of a microliter water droplet on a micropillared hydrophobic\nsurface. The results are presented qualitatively by the high-speed photography\nand quantitatively by the temporal variation of wetted diameter and droplet\nheight. A characterization of the transient quantitative results is a novel\naspect of our work. Three distinct regimes, namely, non-bouncing, complete\nbouncing and partial bouncing are presented. A critical pitch as well as impact\nvelocity exists for the transition from one regime to another. This is\nexplained with a demonstration of Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition in which\nthe liquid penetrates in the grooves between the pillars at larger pitch or\nimpact velocity. The regimes are demarcated on a map of pitch and impact\nvelocity. A good agreement is reported between the present measurements and\npublished analytical models.\n", "  We calculate the spectral function of the QCD Dirac operator using the\nfour-dimensional effective operator constructed from the Mobius domain-wall\nimplementation. We utilize the eigenvalue filtering technique combined with the\nstochastic estimate of the mode number. The spectrum in the entire eigenvalue\nrange is obtained with a single set of measurements. Results on 2+1-flavor\nensembles with Mobius domain-wall sea quarks at lattice spacing ~ 0.08 fm are\nshown.\n", "  In order to exploit the intriguing optical properties of graphene it is\nessential to gain a better understanding of the light-matter interaction in the\nmaterial on ultrashort timescales. Exciting the Dirac fermions with intense\nultrafast laser pulses triggers a series of processes involving interactions\nbetween electrons, phonons and impurities. Here we study these interactions in\nepitaxial graphene supported on silicon carbide (semiconducting) and iridium\n(metallic) substrates using ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (TR-ARPES) based on high harmonic generation. For the\nsemiconducting substrate we reveal a complex hot carrier dynamics that\nmanifests itself in an elevated electronic temperature and an increase in\nlinewidth of the $\\pi$ band. By analyzing these effects we are able to\ndisentangle electron relaxation channels in graphene. On the metal substrate\nthis hot carrier dynamics is found to be severely perturbed by the presence of\nthe metal, and we find that the electronic system is much harder to heat up\nthan on the semiconductor due to screening of the laser field by the metal.\n", "  We clarify certain aspects of instanton operators in five-dimensional\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. In particular, we show how, in the pointlike\nlimit, they become supersymmetric and provide the natural bridge with the\ninstantonic states contributing to the index as well as with the zero mode\ncounting leading to broken current multiplets.\n", "  The swimming of a sphere by means of tangential helical waves running along\nits surface is studied on the basis of the Stokes equations. Two types of\ntangential waves are found. The first of these is associated with a pressure\ndisturbance and leads to a higher rate of net rotation than the second one for\nthe same power. It is suggested that the helical waves are relevant for the\nrotational swimming of Volvox.\n", "  We study the practicability of achieving quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect\nwith field-tunable Chern number in a magnetically doped, topologically trivial\ninsulating thin film. Specifically in a candidate material,\nTlBi(S$_{1-\\delta}$Se$_{\\delta}$)$_2$, we demonstrate that the QAH phases with\ndifferent Chern numbers can be achieved by means of tuning the exchange field\nstrength or the sample thickness near the Z2 topological critical point. Our\nphysics scenario successfully reduces the necessary exchange coupling strength\nfor a targeted Chern number. This QAH mechanism differs from the traditional\nQAH picture with a magnetic topological insulating thin film, where the\n\"surface\" states must involve and sometimes complicate the realization issue.\nFurthermore, we find that a given Chern number can also be tuned by a\nperpendicular electric field, which naturally occurs when a substrate is\npresent.\n", "  A substantial contribution to the SM-like Higgs mass may come from the mixing\nwith the lightest singlet-dominated scalar in NMSSM for moderate or large\nvalues of $\\tan\\beta$ [1]. The LSP neutralino in this model may also contain\nthe singlet component - singlino. In this work we analyze the direct detection\ncross section for a Higgsino-singlino LSP with the emphasis on possible direct\ndetection blind spots in the parameter space. Correlations between the LSP\nproperties and the effects in the Higgs sector coming from the mixing are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  KH2PO4 (KDP) belongs to the class of hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics, whose\nparaelectric to ferroelectric phase transition is driven by the ordering of the\nprotons in the hydrogen bonds. We demonstrate that forbidden reflections of\nKDP, when measured at an x-ray absorption edge, are highly sensitive to the\nasymmetry of proton configurations. The change of average symmetry caused by\nthe \"freezing\" of the protons during the phase transition is clearly evidenced.\nIn the paraelectric phase, we identify in the resonant spectra of the forbidden\nreflections a contribution related to the transient proton configurations in\nthe hydrogen bonds, which violates the high average symmetry of the sites of\nthe resonant atoms. The analysis of the temperature dependence reveals a change\nof relative probabilities of the different proton configurations. They follow\nthe Arrhenius law, and the activation energies of polar and Slater\nconfigurations are 18.6 and 7.3 meV, respectively.\n", "  This paper deals with a one-dimensional wave equation being subjected to a\nunilateral boundary condition. An approximation of this problem combining the\nfinite element and mass redistribution methods is proposed. The mass\nredistribution method is based on a redistribution of the body mass such that\nthere is no inertia at the contact node and the mass of the contact node is\nredistributed on the other nodes. The convergence as well as an error estimate\nin time are proved. The analytical solution associated with a benchmark problem\nis introduced and it is compared to approximate solutions for different choices\nof mass redistribution. However some oscillations for the energy associated\nwith approximate solutions obtained for the second order schemes can be\nobserved after the impact. To overcome this difficulty, an new unconditionally\nstable and a very lightly dissipative scheme is proposed.\n", "  The relation between domain wall motion and intensity of driven current is\nexamined in a phenomenological theory where the kinetic energy is expanded as a\nseries of polynomial function of current density just as the Landau phase\ntransition theory. The dependency of velocity on current density is root square\nwhich degenerates into linear if the current is much higher than the critical\nvalue. The theory result is consistent with several previous experiments and\nalso can explain the change of critical current in the presence of temperature.\nThe role of temperature plays in the dynamics of domain wall motion is also\ndiscussed. The phase transition theory in terms of current density is employed\nto explain the critical behavior of domain wall motion.\n", "  While General Relativity ranks undoubtedly among the best physics theories\never developed, it is also among those with the most striking implications. In\nparticular, General Relativity admits solutions which allow faster than light\nmotion and consequently time travel. Here we shall consider a \"pre-emptive\"\nchronology protection mechanism that destabilises superluminal warp drives via\nquantum matter back-reaction and hence forbids even the conceptual possibility\nto use these solutions for building a time machine. This result will be\nconsidered both in standard quantum field theory in curved spacetime as well as\nin the case of a quantum field theory with Lorentz invariance breakdown at high\nenergies. Some lessons and future perspectives will be finally discuss.\n", "  Here a new microscopic method is proposed to image and characterize very thin\nsamples like few-layer materials, organic molecules, and nanostructures with\nnanometer or sub-nanometer resolution using electron beams of energies lower\nthan 20 eV. The microscopic technique achieves high resolution through the\nproximity (or near-field) effect, as in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),\nwhile it also allows detection of transmitted electrons for imaging and\nspectroscopy, as in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This\nproximity transmission electron microscopy (PSTEM) does not require any lens to\nfocus the electron beam. It also allows detailed characterization of the\ninteraction of low-energy electron with materials. PSTEM can operate in a way\nvery similar to scanning tunneling microscopy, which provides high-resolution\nimaging of geometric and electronic structures of the sample surface. In\naddition, it allows imaging and characterization of the interior structures of\nthe sample based on the detected transmission electron signals. PSTEM comprises\na family of spectroscopies that address the transport and scattering of\nlow-energy electrons in materials. Thus rich information can be extracted from\nthe measurements. PSTEM offers a fundamentally new and powerful way to\ninvestigate thin materials. New analysis methods of thin materials and new\nphysics may be uncovered by this method.\n", "  The intrinsic mechanical strength of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)\nwithin the diameter range of 0.3-0.8 nm has been studied based on ab initio\ndensity functional theory calculations. In contrast to predicting \"smaller is\nstronger and more elastic\" in nanomaterials, the strength of the SWNTs is\nsignificantly reduced when decreasing the tube diameter. The results obtained\nshow that the Young`s modulus E significantly reduced in the ultra-small SWNTs\nwith the diameter less than 0.4 nm originates from their very large curvature\neffect, while it is a constant of about 1.0 TPa, and independent of the\ndiameter and chiral index for the large tube. We find that the Poisson`s ratio,\nideal strength and ideal strain are dependent on the diameter and chiral index.\nFurthermore, the relations between E and ideal strength indicate that\nGriffith`s estimate of brittle fracture could break down in the smallest (2, 2)\nnanotube, with the breaking strength of 15% of E. Our results provide important\ninsights into intrinsic mechanical behavior of ultra-small SWNTs under their\ncurvature effect.\n", "  A search for a Higgs boson decay $H\\to\\gamma^*\\gamma\\to\\ell\\ell\\gamma$ is\npresented. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data\nrecorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\nTeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$. The selected\nevents have an opposite-sign muon or electron pair and a high transverse\nmomentum photon. No excess above background has been found in the three-body\ninvariant mass range $120<m_{\\ell\\ell\\gamma}<150$ GeV, and limits have been\nderived for the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction\nfor the $H\\to\\gamma^*\\gamma\\to\\ell\\ell\\gamma$ decay, where the dilepton\ninvariant mass is less than 20 GeV. For a Higgs boson with $m_H=125$ GeV, a\n$95\\%$ confidence level (CL) exclusion observed (expected) limit is 6.7\n($5.9^{+.2.8}_{-1.8}$) times the standard model prediction.\n  Additionally, a search for $H\\to(J/\\Psi)\\gamma\\to\\mu\\mu\\gamma$ process is\npresented, and an upper limit at $95\\%$ CL on the branching fraction of the\n$H\\to(J/\\Psi)\\gamma$ decay for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is set at\n$1.5\\times10^{-3}$.\n", "  We demonstrate a general method to assemble and propel highly maneuverable\ncolloidal carpets which can be steered via remote control in any direction of\nthe plane. These colloidal micropropellers are composed by an ensemble of\nspinning rotors and can be readily used to entrap, transport, and release\nbiological cargos on command via a hydrodynamic conveyor-belt effect. An\nefficient control of the cargo transportation combined with remarkable\n\"healing\" ability to surpass obstacles demonstrate a great potential towards\ndevelopment of multifunctional smart devices at the microscale.\n", "  We study propulsion arising from microscopic colloidal rotors dynamically\nassembled and driven in a viscous fluid upon application of an elliptically\npolarized rotating magnetic field. Close to a confining plate, the motion of\nthis self-assembled microscopic worm results from the cooperative flow\ngenerated by the spinning particles which act as a hydrodynamic \"conveyor\nbelt.\" Chains of rotors propel faster than individual ones, until reaching a\nsaturation speed at distances where induced-flow additivity vanishes. By\ncombining experiments and theoretical arguments, we elucidate the mechanism of\nmotion and fully characterize the propulsion speed in terms of the field\nparameters.\n", "  Systems of Cooee bitumen and water up to 4 mass % are studied by molecular\ndynamics simula- tions. The cohesive energy density of the system is shown to\ndecrease with an increasing water content. This decrease is due mainly to an\nincrease in potential energy which is not high enough to counterbalance the\nincrease in volume due to the addition of water. It is not due to a decrease of\npotential energy between the slightly polar asphaltene molecules. The water\nmolecules tend to form a droplet in bitumen. The size and the distribution of\nsizes of the droplets are quantified, with multiple droplets being more stable\nat the highest temperature simulated. The droplet is mainly located close to\nthe saturates molecules in Cooee bitumen. Finally, it is shown that the water\ndynamics is much slower in bitumen than in pure water because it is governed by\nthe diffusion of the droplet and not of the single molecules.\n", "  The transport of electrons through serially coupled quantum dot molecules\n(SCQDM) is investigated theoretically for application as an energy harvesting\nengine (EHE), which converts thermal heat to electrical power. We demonstrate\nthat the charge current driven by a temperature bias shows bipolar oscillatory\nbehavior with respect to gate voltage due to the unbalance between electrons\nand holes, which is different from the charge current driven by an applied\nbias. In addition, we reveal a Lenz's law between the charge current and the\nthermal induced voltage. The efficiency of EHE is higher for SCQDM in the\norbital depletion situation rather than the orbital filling situation, owing to\nthe many-body effect. The EHE efficiency is enhanced with increasing\ntemperature bias, but suppressed as the electron hopping strength reduces. The\nfluctuation of QD energy levels at different sites also leads to a reduction of\nEHE efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate direction-dependent charge currents\ndriven by the temperature bias for application as a novel charge diode.\n", "  The dielectric function of the wide-gap optical material HfO2 is investigated\nby the local density approximation (LDA) +U approach. We focus on the origin of\nthe shoulder-like structure near the edge of the band gap in the imaginary part\nof the dielectric function, which has been observed on the thin films of\nmonoclinic HfO2. A comparison study on the three polymorphs of hafnia shows\nthat regardless of the underlying crystal structure, the existence of the\nshoulder is directly controlled by the value of the shortest length of Hf-O\nbonds. The proposition is further supported by the numerical simulations of\nisostatic pressing. A possible implication in high-pressure measurements is\nsuggested accordingly.\n", "  The chemistry along the mass loss of Hot Jupiters is generally considered to\nbe simple, consisting mainly of atoms, prevented from forming more complex\nspecies by the intense radiation field from their host stars. In order to probe\nthe region where the temperature is low (T < 2000 K), we developed a 1D\nchemical and photochemical reaction model of the atmospheric mass loss of HD\n209458 b, involving 56 species, including carbon chain and oxygen bearing ones,\ninteracting through 566 reactions. The simulation results indicate that simple\nmolecules like OH+, H2O+ and H3O+ are formed inside the region, considering\nthat residual H2 survives in the exosphere, a possibility indicated by recent\nobservational work. The molecules are formed and destroyed within a radial\ndistance of less than 10^7 km, but the estimated integrated column density of\nOH+, a potential tracer of H2, is high enough to allow detection, which, once\nachieved, would indicate a revision of chemical models of the upper atmosphere\nof Hot Jupiters. For low density Hot Jupiters receiving less intense XUV\nradiation from their host stars than HD 209458 b, molecular species could\nconceivably be formed with a higher total column density.\n", "  Boundary conditions in relativistic QFT can be classified by deep results in\nthe theory of braided or modular tensor categories.\n", "  The spin-flip model describing optically pumped spin-polarized\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers is considered. The steady-state\nsolutions of the model for elliptically-polarised fields are studied.\nAsymptotic analysis for the existence and stability of the steady-state\nsolutions is developed, particularly in the presence of pump polarisation\nellipticity. The expansion is with respect to small parameters representing the\nellipticity and the difference between the total pump power and the lasing\nthreshold. The analytical results are then confirmed numerically, where it is\nobtained that generally one of the steady-state solutions is stable while the\nother is not. The theoretical results are shown to be in qualitative agreement\nwith the experiments.\n", "  The purpose of this thesis is to obtain more realistic equations of state to\ndescribe the matter forming magnetized white dwarfs, and use them to solve its\nstructure equations.\n  The equations of state are determined by considering the weak magnetic field\napproximation $B<B_c$ ($B_c=4.41\\times10^{13}\\text{ G}$) for the electron gas\nof the star. The magnetic field introduces anisotropic pressures, even for the\nmoderate values present in white dwarfs. Also, we consider the energy and\npressure correction due to the Coulomb interaction of the electron gas with the\nions located in a crystal lattice.\n  Moreover, spherically symmetric Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff structure\nequations are solved independently for the perpendicular and parallel\npressures, confirming the necessity of using axisymmetric structure equations,\nmore adequate to describe the anisotropic system. Therefore, we study the\nsolutions in cylindrical coordinates. In this case, the mass per longitude unit\nis obtained instead of the total mass of the white dwarf.\n", "  A pore-scale model is introduced for two-phase flow in dense packings of\npolydisperse spheres. The model is developed as a component of a more general\nhydromechanical coupling framework based on the discrete element method, which\nwill be elaborated in future papers. Here the emphasis is on the generation of\na network of pores mapping the void space between spherical grains, and the\ndefinition of local criteria governing the primary drainage process. The pore\nspace is decomposed by Regular Triangulation, from which a set of pores\nconnected by throats are identified. A local entry capillary pressure is\nevaluated for each throat, based on the balance of capillary pressure and\nsurface tension at equilibrium. The model reflects the possible entrapment of\ndisconnected patches of the receding wetting phase. It is validated by a\ncomparison with drainage experiments. A series of simulations are reported to\nillustrate size and boundary effects, key questions when studying small samples\nmade of spherical particles be it in simulations or experiments. Repeated tests\non samples of different sizes give evolution of water content which are not\nonly scattered but also strongly biased for small sample sizes. More than\n20,000 spheres are needed to reduce the bias on saturation below 0.02.\nAdditional statistics are generated by subsampling a large sample of 64,000\nspheres. They suggest that the minimal sampling volume for evaluating\nsaturation is one hundred times greater that the sampling volume needed for\nmeasuring porosity with the same accuracy. This requirement in terms of sample\nsize induces a need for efficient computer codes. The method described herein\nhas a low algorithmic complexity in order to satisfy this requirement. It will\nbe well suited to further developments toward coupled flow-deformation problems\nin which evolution of the microstructure require frequent updates of the pore\nnetwork.\n", "  Ancient objects made of noble metal alloys, that is, gold with copper and/or\nsilver, can show the phenomenon of surface enrichment. This phenomenon is\nregarding the composition of the surface, which has a percentage of gold higher\nthan that of the bulk. This enrichment is obtained by a depletion of the other\nelements of the alloy, which are, in some manner, removed. This depletion\ngilding process was used by pre-Columbian populations for their 'tumbaga', a\ngold-copper alloy, to give it the luster of gold.\n", "  While free scroll rings are non-stationary objects that either grow or\ncontract with time, spatial confinement can have a large impact on their\nevolution reaching from significant lifetime extension [J. F. Totz , H. Engel,\nand O. Steinbock, New J. Phys. 17, 093043 (2015)] up to formation of stable\nstationary and breathing pacemakers [A. Azhand, J. F. Totz, and H. Engel,\nEurophys. Lett. 108, 10004 (2014)]. Here, we explore the parameter range in\nwhich the interaction between an axis-symmetric scroll ring and a confining\nplanar no-flux boundary can be studied experimentally in transparent gel layers\nsupporting chemical wave propagation in the photosensitive variant of the\nBelousov-Zhabotinsky medium. Based on full three-dimensional simulations of the\nunderlying modified complete Oregonator model for experimentally realistic\nparameters, we determine the conditions for successful initiation of scroll\nrings in a phase diagram spanned by the layer thickness and the applied light\nintensity. Furthermore, we discuss whether the illumination-induced\nexcitability gradient due to Lambert-Beer's law as well as a possible\ninclination of the filament plane with respect to the no-flux boundary can\ndestabilize the scroll ring.\n", "  Particles in an extended air shower (EAS), initiated by a cosmic ray primary,\nlead to two nearly simultaneous detections in a scintillator pair. The angle of\nthe EAS and the axis through both scintillators can be reconstructed using the\ntime difference of the detections and the distance between the scintillators.\nThe acceptances of a scintillator along the axis through the scintillators and\nperpendicularly on this axis follow the same distribution in theory. Using a\ndata set with two perpendicular detector pairs this theory is verified. The\ndistribution of possible origins of cosmic ray primaries, and the resulting\nEAS, can thus be described using the perpendicular distribution for a given\ntime difference.\n", "  The emergent dynamics in phase-separated mixtures of isometric active and\npassive Brownian particles is studied numerically in two dimensions. A novel\nsteady-state of well-defined traveling fronts is observed, where the interface\nbetween the dense and the dilute phase propagates and the bulk of both phases\nis (nearly) at rest. Two kind of interfaces, advancing and receding, are formed\nby spontaneous symmetry breaking, induced by an instability of a planar\ninterface due to the formation of localized vortices. The propagation arises\ndue to flux imbalance at the interface, strongly resembling traveling fronts in\nreaction-diffusion systems. Above a threshold, the interface velocity decreases\nlinearly with increasing fraction of active particles.\n", "  Plasmonics offer an exciting way to mediate the interaction between light and\nmatter, allowing strong field enhancement and confinement, large absorption and\nscattering at resonance. However, simultaneous realization of ultra-narrow band\nperfect absorption and electromagnetic field enhancement is challenging due to\nthe intrinsic high optical losses and radiative damping in metals. Here, we\npropose an all-metal plasmonic absorber with an absorption bandwidth less than\n8nm and polarization insensitive absorptivity exceeding 99%. Unlike traditional\nMetal-Dielectric-Metal configurations, we demonstrate that the narrowband\nperfect absorption and field enhancement are ascribed to the vertical gap\nplasmonic mode in the deep subwavelength scale, which has a high quality factor\nof 120 and mode volume of about 10^-4*({\\lambda}/n)^3 . Based on the coupled\nmode theory, we verify that the diluted field enhancement is proportional to\nthe absorption, and thus perfect absorption is critical to maximum field\nenhancement. In addition, the proposed perfect absorber can be operated as a\nrefractive index sensor with a sensitivity of 885nm/RIU and figure of merit as\nhigh as 110. It provides a new design strategy for narrow band perfect\nabsorption and local field enhancement, and has potential applications in\nbiosensors, filters and nonlinear optics.\n", "  In this paper we prove that the maximum amplitude of a finite-gap solution to\nthe focusing Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with given spectral bands does\nnot exceed half of the sum of the length of all the bands. This maximum will be\nattained for certain choices of the initial phases. A similar result is also\ntrue for the defocusing Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  A number of recent studies has focused on the implications of new physics at\nthe Planck scale on the equilibrium of compact astrophysical objects such as\nwhite dwarf and neutron stars. Here we analyze the modification of the\nequilibrium configurations induced by the so-called Gravity's Rainbow that\naccount for Planck scale deformation of the space-time.\n", "  In this paper, we develop the Chaplygin reducing multiplier method; using\nthis method, we obtain a conformally Hamiltonian representation for three\nnonholonomic systems, namely, for the nonholonomic oscillator, for the\nHeisenberg system, and for the Chaplygin sleigh. Furthermore, in the case of an\noscillator and the nonholonomic Chaplygin sleigh, we show that the problem\nreduces to the study of motion of a mass point (in a potential field) on a\nplane and, in the case of the Heisenberg system, on the sphere. Moreover, we\nconsider an example of a nonholonomic system (suggested by Blackall) to which\none cannot apply the reducing multiplier method.\n", "  We notice contradictory statements of Z.ahmed on $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry\npotential $V=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}+igx|x|$ (g=2) The curve (dash-dot) shows only one\nzero whose corresponding energy eigenvalue is 1.72.This graphical\nrepresentation contradicts the discussion (presented below the graph )which\nclaims number of real discrete states between $0\\leg\\le2.3$ are 3.as $g=2$\n<$g=2.3$ ,one should get number of real discrete states 3 instead of 1.However\npresent calculation matrix diagonalisation pethod reflects 3.secondly the\nstatement on complex Harmonic Oscillator $V_{H}=x^{@}+ix$ (which entails\ncomplete real discrete spectrum) as a singular example is not acceptable as we\nnotice many complex $|mathcal{PT}$ symmetric potentials can be constructed\n,which would reflect infinitr real discrete energy eigenvalues.\n", "  GK Persei (1901, the 'Firework Nebula') is an old but bright nova remnant\nthat offers a chance to probe the physics and kinematics of nova shells. The\nkinematics in new and archival longslit optical echelle spectra were analysed\nusing the shape software. New imaging from the Aristarchos telescope continues\nto track the proper motion, extinction and structural evolution of the knots,\nwhich have been observed intermittently over several decades. We present for\nthe first time, kinematical constraints on a large faint 'jet' feature, that\nwas previously detected beyond the shell boundary. These observational\nconstraints allow for the generation of models for individual knots,\ninteractions within knot complexes, and the 'jet' feature. Put together, and\ntaking into account dwarf-nova accelerated winds emanating from the central\nsource, these data and models give a deeper insight into the GK Per nova\nremnant as a whole.\n", "  It is well known that objects can oscillate around the Lagrangian point L4.\nIn this manuscript we compute the period of these oscillations by computing the\nexact expression of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix that determined\nthe stability of the Lagrangian point. When we use relativity theory we are\nsupposed to get a small improvement of this period. This paper compares the\nvalues of the the characteristic polynomials computed in the following way: 1.\nUsing relativity with an error smaller than 10^{-30}. 2. The characteristic\npolynomial coming from a paper written in 2002, 3. The characteristic\npolynomial coming from a paper written in 2006 and 4. The characteristic\npolynomial obtain without using relativity.\n  We show that the polynomial 1 is closer to the polynomial 4 than it is to the\npolynomials 2 and 3. This is, the error in both polynomials that dealt with\nrelativity coming from previous papers is bigger than the error coming from the\ncharacteristic polynomial that do not use relativity at all.\n  We also prove the existence of the Lagrangian point L4 in the Sun-Earth\nsystem using the Poincare Miranda theorem.\n", "  Planetary ephemerides are a good tool for studying general relativity at the\nscale of our solar system. We present here new evaluations of advances of\nperihelia for Mercury and Saturn.\n", "  It is proposed that the quantum mechanics of N D4-branes and M D0-branes on\nthe quintic is described by the dimensional reduction of a certain U(N)xU(M)\nquiver gauge theory, whose superpotential encodes the defining quintic\npolynomial. It is shown that the moduli space on the Higgs branch exactly\nreproduces the moduli space of degree N hypersurfaces in the quintic endowed\nwith the appropriate line bundle, and that the cohomology growth reproduces the\nD4-D0 black hole entropy.\n", "  We propose a generation method of Bell-type states involving light and the\nvibrational motion of a single trapped ion. The trap itself is supposed to be\nplaced inside a high-$Q$ cavity sustaining a single mode, quantized\nelectromagnetic field. Entangled light-motional states may be readily generated\nif a conditional measurement of the ion's internal electronic state is made\nafter an appropriate interaction time and a suitable preparation of the initial\nstate. We show that all four Bell states may be generated using different\nmotional sidebands (either blue or red), as well as adequate ionic relative\nphases.\n"]}
