the\nstrength of weak non-linearities of the spectrum in graphene. I consider\ntrigonal warping as a representative mechanism responsible for the drag effect.\nSince graphene is relatively defect-free, I evaluate the drag conductivity in\nthe ballistic regime and find that it is proportional to the fourth power of\nthe warping strength.\n", "  We report the detection of radio QPOs with structure changes using the Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. We found conspicuous patterned changes of\nthe structure with P = 16.8 +- 1.4, 22.2 +- 1.4, 31.2 +- 1.5, 56.4 +- 6 min,\nvery roughly in a 3:4:6:10 ratio. The first two periods show a rotating one-arm\nstructure, while the P = 31.4 min shows a rotating 3-arm structure, as if\nviewed edge-on. At the central 50 microasec the P = 56.4 min period shows a\ndouble amplitude variation of those in its surroundings. Spatial distributions\nof the oscillation periods suggest that the disk of SgrA* is roughly edge-on,\nrotating around an axis with PA = -10 degree. Presumably, the observed VLBI\nimages of SgrA* at 43 GHz retain several features of the black hole accretion\ndisk of SgrA* in spite of being obscured and broadened by scattering of\nsurrounding plasma.\n", "  We report detailed magnetization measurements on the perovskite oxide\nNdNiO$_3$. This system has a first order metal-insulator (M-I) transition at\nabout 200 K which is associated with charge ordering. There is also a\nconcurrent paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic spin ordering transition in the\nsystem. We show that the antiferromagnetic state of the nickel sublattice is\nspin canted. We also show that the concurrency of the charge ordering and spin\nordering transitions is seen only while warming up the system from low\ntemperature. The transitions are not concurrent while cooling the system\nthrough the M-I transition temperature. This is explained based on the fact\nthat the charge ordering transition is first order while the spin ordering\ntransition is continuous. In the magnetically ordered state the system exhibits\nZFC-FC irreversibilities, as well as history-dependent magnetization and aging.\nOur analysis rules out the possibility of spin-glass or superparamagnetism and\nsuggests that the irreversibilities originate from magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy and domain wall pinning.\n", "  Quantum entanglement plays a vital role in many quantum information and\ncommunication tasks. Entangled states of higher dimensional systems are of\ngreat interest due to the extended possibilities they provide. For example,\nthey allow the realisation of new types of quantum information schemes that can\noffer higher information-density coding and greater resilience to errors than\ncan be achieved with entangled two-dimensional systems. Closing the detection\nloophole in Bell test experiments is also more experimentally feasible when\nhigher dimensional entangled systems are used. We have measured previously\nuntested correlations between two photons to experimentally demonstrate\nhigh-dimensional entangled states. We obtain violations of Bell-type\ninequalities generalised to d-dimensional systems with up to d = 12.\nFurthermore, the violations are strong enough to indicate genuine\n11-dimensional entanglement. Our experiments use photons entangled in orbital\nangular momentum (OAM), generated through spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC), and manipulated using computer controlled holograms.\n", "  Quantum correlations resulting in violations of Bell inequalities have\ngenerated a lot of interest in quantum information science and fundamental\nphysics. In this paper, we address some questions that become relevant in\nBell-type tests involving systems with local dimension greater than 2. For\nCHSH-Bell tests within 2-dimensional subspaces of such high-dimensional\nsystems, it has been suggested that experimental violation of Tsirelson's bound\nindicates that more than 2-dimensional entanglement was present. We explain\nthat the overstepping of Tsirelson's bound is due to violation of fair\nsampling, and can in general be reproduced by a separable state, if fair\nsampling is violated. For a class of Bell-type inequalities generalized to\nd-dimensional systems, we then consider what level of violation is required to\nguarantee d-dimensional entanglement of the tested state, when fair sampling is\nsatisfied. We find that this can be used as an experimentally feasible test of\nd-dimensional entanglement for up to quite high values of d.\n", "  The generalization of Bertrand's theorem to abstract surfaces of revolution\nwithout \"equators\" is proved. We prove a criterion for the existence on such a\nsurface of exactly two central potentials (up to an additive and a\nmultiplicative constants) all of whose bounded nonsingular orbits are closed\nand which admit a bounded nonsingular noncircular orbit. A criterion for the\nexistence of a unique such potential is proved. The geometry and classification\nof the corresponding surfaces are described, with indicating either the pair of\ngravitational and oscillator) potentials or the unique (oscillator) potential.\nThe absence of the required potentials on any surface which does not meet the\nabove criteria is proved.\n", "  Benford's law states that in data sets from different phenomena leading\ndigits tend to be distributed logarithmically such that the numbers beginning\nwith smaller digits occur more often than those with larger ones. Particularly,\nthe law is known to hold for different types of financial data. The Illicit\nFinancial Flows (IFFs) exiting the developing countries are frequently\ndiscussed as hidden resources which could have been otherwise properly utilized\nfor their development. We investigate here the distribution of the leading\ndigits in the recent data on estimates of IFFs to look for the existence of a\npattern as predicted by Benford's law and establish that the frequency of\noccurrence of the leading digits in these estimates does closely follow the\nlaw.\n", "  Recently, Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully found that for a\nsufficiently old black hole (BH), the set of assumptions known as the\n\\emph{complementarity postulates} appears to be inconsistent with the\nassumption of local regularity at the horizon. They concluded that the horizon\nof an old BH is likely to be the locus of local irregularity, a \"firewall\".\nHere I point out that if one adopts a different assumption, namely that\nsemiclassical physics holds throughout its anticipated domain of validity, then\nno inconsistency seems to arise, and the horizon retains its regularity. In\nthis alternative view-point, the vast portion of the original BH information\nremains trapped inside the BH throughout the semiclassical domain of\nevaporation, and possibly leaks out later on. This appears to be an inevitable\noutcome of semiclassical gravity.\n", "  For quantitative electron microscopy high precision position information is\nnecessary so that besides an adequate resolution and sufficiently strong\ncontrast of atoms, small width of peaks which represent atoms in structural\nimages is needed. Size of peak is determined by point spread (PS) of\ninstruments as well as that of atoms when point resolution reach the\nsubangstrom scale and thus PS of instruments is comparable with that of atoms.\nIn this article, relationship between PS with atomic numbers, sample thickness,\nand spherical aberration coefficients will be studied in both negative Cs\nimaging (NCSI) and positive Cs imaging (PCSI) modes by means of dynamical image\nsimulation. Through comparing the peak width with different thickness and\ndifferent values of spherical aberration, NCSI mode is found to be superior to\nPCSI considering smaller peak width in the structural image.\n", "  Recently, an active microswimmer was constructed where a micron-sized droplet\nof bromine water was placed into a surfactant-laden oil phase. Due to a\nbromination reaction of the surfactant at the interface, the surface tension\nlocally increases and becomes non-uniform. This drives a Marangoni flow which\npropels the squirming droplet forward. We develop a\ndiffusion-advection-reaction equation for the order parameter of the surfactant\nmixture at the droplet interface using a mixing free energy. Numerical\nsolutions reveal a stable swimming regime above a critical Marangoni number M\nbut also stopping and oscillating states when M is increased further. The\nswimming droplet is identified as a pusher whereas in the oscillating state it\noscillates between being a puller and a pusher.\n", "  The mechanical response of amorphous silica (or silica glass) under\nhydrostatic compression for very high pressures up to 25 GPa is modelled via an\nelastic-plastic constitutive equation (continuum mechanics framework).The\nmaterial parameters appearing in the theory have been estimated from the ex\nsitu experimental data from Rouxel et al. [Rouxel T, Ji H, Guin JP, Augereau F,\nRuffle B J Appl Phys 2010;107(9):094903]. The model is shown to capture the\nmajor features of the pressure-volume changes response from the in situ\nexperimental work of Sato and Funamori [Sato T, Funamori N Phys Rev Lett\n2008;101:255502]. In particular, the onset and saturation of densification, the\nincrease in elasticity parameters (bulk, shear and Youngs moduli) and Poissons\nratio are found to be key parameters of the model.\n", "  ProtoMD is a toolkit that facilitates the development of algorithms for\nmultiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is designed for multiscale\nmethods which capture the dynamic transfer of information across multiple\nspatial scales, such as the atomic to the mesoscopic scale, via coevolving\nmicroscopic and coarse-grained (CG) variables. ProtoMD can be also be used to\ncalibrate parameters needed in traditional CG-MD methods. The toolkit\nintegrates `GROMACS wrapper' to initiate MD simulations, and `MDAnalysis' to\nanalyze and manipulate trajectory files. It facilitates experimentation with a\nspectrum of coarse-grained variables, prototyping rare events (such as chemical\nreactions), or simulating nanocharacterization experiments such as terahertz\nspectroscopy, AFM, nanopore, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. ProtoMD is\nwritten in python and is freely available under the GNU General Public License\nfrom github.com/CTCNano/proto_md.\n", "  We investigate the formation dynamics of plastic creases in thin\nelasto-plastic sheets. In contrast to the commonly accepted description of\ncrumpled thin sheets, which asserts that creases form only by elastic\ninteraction between two d-cones, the creases we study in this letter are\ncreated by plastic deformations left in the wake of a single propagating\nd-cone. Upon application of load, a d-cone initially remains stationary and\nresponds by deforming globally. However, above a critical load, the d-cone\nundergoes a sharpening transition that focuses the stresses at its tip,\nallowing it to propagate along the sheet, leaving a furrow-like scar in its\nwake. Our results show that the dynamics of plastic defect creation are\nimportant for predicting the final geometry and statistics of a defect network\nin a crumpled thin sheet.\n", "  We prove that the distribution of eigenvectors of generalized Wigner matrices\nis universal both in the bulk and at the edge. This includes a probabilistic\nversion of local quantum unique ergodicity and asymptotic normality of the\neigenvector entries. The proof relies on analyzing the eigenvector flow under\nthe Dyson Brownian motion. The key new ideas are: (1) the introduction of the\neigenvector moment flow, a multi-particle random walk in a random environment,\n(2) an effective estimate on the regularity of this flow based on maximum\nprinciple and (3) optimal finite speed of propagation holds for the eigenvector\nmoment flow with very high probability.\n", "  We consider a one dimensional infinite chain of har- monic oscillators whose\ndynamics is perturbed by a stochastic term conserving energy and momentum. We\nprove that in the unpinned case the macroscopic evolution of the energy\nconverges to a fractional diffusion. For a pinned system we prove that energy\nevolves diffusively, generalizing some of the results of [4].\n", "  It has recently been found that Bell scenarios are only a small subclass of\ninteresting setups for studying the non-classical features of quantum theory\nwithin spacetime. We find that it is possible to talk about classical\ncorrelations, quantum correlations and other kinds of correlations on any\ndirected acyclic graph, and this captures various extensions of Bell scenarios\nwhich have been considered in the literature. From a conceptual point of view,\nthe main feature of our approach is its high level of unification: while the\nnotions of source, choice of setting and measurement play all seemingly\ndifferent roles in a Bell scenario, our formalism shows that they are all\ninstances of the same concept of \"event\".\n  Our work can also be understood as a contribution to the subject of causal\ninference with latent variables. Among other things, we introduce hidden\nBayesian networks as a generalization of hidden Markov models.\n", "  In this paper we extend our previous results concerning Jackson integral\nsolutions of the boundary quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with\ndiagonal K-operators to higher-spin representations of quantum affine\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. First we give a systematic exposition of known results on\n$R$-operators acting in the tensor product of evaluation representations in\nVerma modules over quantum $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We develop the corresponding\nfusion of $K$-operators, which we use to construct diagonal $K$-operators in\nthese representations. We construct Jackson integral solutions of the\nassociated boundary quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and explain how in\nthe finite-dimensional case they can be obtained from our previous results by\nthe fusion procedure.\n", "  We compute the dimension of the moduli space of gauge-inequivalent solutions\nto the Bogomolny equation on R^3 with prescribed singularities corresponding to\nthe insertion of a finite number of 't Hooft defects. We do this by\ngeneralizing the methods of C. Callias and E. Weinberg to the case of R^3 with\na finite set of points removed. For a special class of Cartan-valued\nbackgrounds we go further and construct an explicit basis of L^2-normalizable\nzero-modes. Finally we exhibit and study a two-parameter family of spherically\nsymmetric singular monopoles, using the dimension formula to provide a physical\ninterpretation of these configurations. This paper is the first in a series of\nthree on singular monopoles, where we also explore the role they play in the\ncontexts of intersecting D-brane systems and four-dimensional N=2 super\nYang-Mills theories.\n", "  We study intersecting brane systems that realize a class of singular monopole\nconfigurations in four-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. Singular monopoles\nare solutions to the Bogomolny equation on R^3 with a prescribed number of\nsingularities corresponding to the insertion of 't Hooft defects. We use the\nbrane construction to motivate a recent conjecture on the conditions for which\nthe moduli space of solutions is non-empty. We also show how branes provide\nphysical intuition for various aspects of the dimension formula derived in\n{arXiv:1404.5616}, including the contribution to the dimension from the defects\nand its invariance under Weyl reflections of the 't Hooft charges. Along the\nway we uncover and illustrate new dynamical phenomena for the brane systems,\nincluding a description of smooth monopole extraction and bubbling from 't\nHooft defects.\n", "  Flight on the two-dimensional air-water interface, with body weight supported\nby surface tension, is a unique locomotion strategy well adapted for the\nenvironmental niche on the surface of water. Although previously described in\nphylogenetically basal aquatic insects like stone flies, the biomechanics of\ninterfacial flight has never been analyzed. Here, we report interfacial flight\nas an adapted behaviour in water-lily beetles (Galerucella nymphaeae, Linnaeus\n1758) which are also dexterous airborne fliers. We present the first\nquantitative biomechanical model of interfacial flight in insects, uncovering\nan intricate interplay of capillary, aerodynamic and neuromuscular forces. We\nshow that water-lily beetles use their tarsal claws to attach themselves to the\ninterface, via a fluid contact line pinned at the claw. We investigate the\nkinematics of interfacial flight trajectories using high-speed imaging and\nconstruct a mathematical model describing the flight dynamics. Our results show\nthat nonlinear surface tension forces make interfacial flight energetically\nexpensive compared to airborne flight at the relatively high speeds\ncharacteristic of water-lily beetles, and cause chaotic dynamics to arise\nnaturally in these regimes. We identify the crucial roles of capillary-gravity\nwave drag and oscillatory surface tension forces which dominate interfacial\nflight, showing that the air-water interface presents a radically modified\nforce landscape for flapping wing flight compared to air.\n", "  Particle pair (relative) diffusion in a field of homogeneous turbulence with\ngeneralised power-law energy spectra, $E(k)\\sim k^{-p}$ for $1< p\\le 3$ and\n$k_1\\le k\\le k_\\eta$ with $k_\\eta/k_1=10^6$, is investigated numerically using\nKinematic Simulation (Kraichnan 1970, Fung et al 1992). If $\\Delta=|{\\bf\nx_2}(t)-{\\bf x}_1(t)|$ and $\\sigma_\\Delta=\\sqrt{\\langle\\Delta^2\\rangle}$, (the\nangled brackets is the ensemble average over particle pairs), then we find\nthat:\n  (1) The pair diffusivity scales like $D_p\\sim \\sigma_\\Delta^{\\gamma_p}$ with\n$\\gamma_p$ obtained from the simulations such that $\\gamma^l_p<\\gamma_p<2$,\nwhere $\\gamma^l_p =(1+p)/2$ is the Richardson locality scaling. The range of\n$\\Delta$ over which these scalings are observed diminishes from above and from\nbelow as $p$ increases towards $3$.\\\\ (2) $M(p)=\\gamma_p/\\gamma^l_p>1$ in the\nrange $1<p<3$, and $M$ has a peak at $p_m\\approx 1.8$. This suggests that for\nspectra close to this in the range $1.5<p<2$, which includes Kolmogorov\nturbulence, local and non-local correlations play comparable roles in the pair\ndiffusion process.\\\\ (3) The mean square separation scales like\n$\\langle\\Delta^2\\rangle_p \\sim \\tau_p^{\\chi_p}$ where $\\chi_p=1/(1-\\gamma_p/2)$\nand $\\tau_p$ is an adjusted travel time.\\\\ (4) For Kolmogorov turbulence\n$p=5/3$, we observe $D_{5/3}\\sim \\sigma_\\Delta^{1.53}$, and\n$\\langle\\Delta^2\\rangle_{5/3}\\sim\\tau^{4.2}$. \\\\ (5) At $p_*\\approx 1.4$\n($E(k)\\sim k^{-1.4}$) we observe $D_{p_*}\\sim\\sigma_\\Delta^{4/3}$, and\n$\\langle\\Delta^2\\rangle_{p_*}\\sim\\tau^3$; these are different to the Richardson\n$4/3$-law and Richardson-Obukov $t^3$-regime which occur for $p=5/3$.\n  These results are consistent with Malik's (2014) theory, and supports the\nprinciple upon which the theory is based that both local and non-local\ncorrelations are effective in the pair diffusion process inside the inertial\nsubrange.\n", "  In this short communication, we show that the validity of the Leibniz rule\nfor a fractional derivative on a coarse-grained medium brings about a modified\nchain rule, in agreement with alternative versions of fractional calculus. We\ncompare our results to those of a recent article on this matter.\n", "  In the high-temperature ($T_{c}$) cuprate superconductors, increasing\nevidence suggests that the pseudogap, existing below the pseudogap temperature\n$T$*, has a distinct broken electronic symmetry from that of superconductivity.\nParticularly, recent scattering experiments on the underdoped cuprates have\nsuggested that a charge ordering competes with superconductivity. However, no\ndirect link of this physics and the important low-energy excitations has been\nidentified. Here we report an antagonistic singularity at $T_{c}$ in the\nspectral weight of Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+{\\delta}}$ as a compelling\nevidence for phase competition, which persists up to a high hole concentration\n$p$ ~ 0.22. Comparison with a theoretical calculation confirms that the\nsingularity is a signature of competition between the order parameters for the\npseudogap and superconductivity. The observation of the spectroscopic\nsingularity at finite temperatures over a wide doping range provides new\ninsights into the nature of the competitive interplay between the two\nintertwined phases and the complex phase diagram near the pseudogap critical\npoint.\n", "  We investigate the Hartree-Fock solutions to H2 in a minimal basis. We note\nthe properties of the solutions and their disappearance with geometry and\npropose a new method, Holomorphic Hartree-Fock theory, where we modify the SCF\nequations to avoid disappearance of the solutions. We use these solutions as a\nbasis for a non-orthogonal Configuration Interaction to produce a smooth\nbinding curve over a complete range of geometries.\n", "  A new KAM-style proof of Anderson localization is obtained. A sequence of\nlocal rotations is defined, such that off-diagonal matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian are driven rapidly to zero. This leads to the first proof via\nmulti-scale analysis of exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator (this\nimplies strong dynamical localization). The method has been used in recent work\non many-body localization [arXiv:1403.7837].\n", "  We consider the conventional Laplace transform of $f(x)$, denoted by\n$\\mathcal{L}[f(x); p]~\\equiv~F(p)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-p x} f(x) dx$ with\n${\\rm \\mathfrak{Re}}(p) > 0$. For $0 < \\alpha < 1$ we furnish the closed form\nexpressions for the inverse Laplace transforms $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(p^{\\alpha});\nx]$ and $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[p^{\\alpha-1}F(p^{\\alpha}); x]$. In both cases they\ninvolve definite integration with kernels which are appropriately rescaled\none-sided L\\'{e}vy stable probability distribution functions $g_{\\alpha}(x)$,\n$0 < \\alpha < 1$, $x > 0$. Since $g_{\\alpha}(x)$ are exactly and explicitly\nknown for rational $\\alpha$, \\textit{i.e.} for $\\alpha = l/k$ with $l, k=1, 2,\n\\ldots$, $l < k$, our results extend the known and tabulated case of $\\alpha =\n1/2$ to any rational $0 < \\alpha < 1$. We examine the integral kernels of this\nprocedure as well as the resulting two kinds of L\\'{e}vy integral\ntransformations.\n", "  Sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles are predicted from the GUT era by theory.\nTo date there have been no confirmed observations of such exotic particles. The\nIron CALorimeter (ICAL) at India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) aims to\nmeasure the neutrino oscillation parameters precisely. As it is a tracking\ndetector there is also the possibility of detecting magnetic monopoles in the\nsub-relativistic region. Using ICAL the magnetic monopole event is\ncharacterised by the large time intervals of upto 30 microsec between the\nsignals in successive layers of the active detectors. The aim of this study is\nto identify the sensitivity of ICAL for a particle carrying magnetic charge in\nthe mass range from 10^{5} to 10^{17} GeV with beta ranging from 10^{-5} to 9 x\n10^{-1} for ICAL at INO. A similar study has also been carried out for the ICAL\nprototype which will be placed overground. Due to the rock cover of\napproximately 1.3 km, ICAL at INO will not be able to place bounds on the flux\nof the lower mass magnetic monopoles. This mass region is however addressed by\nthe prototype ICAL.\n", "  We develop new algorithms for approximating extremal toric K\\\"ahler metrics.\nWe focus on an extremal metric on\n$\\mathbb{CP}^{2}\\sharp2\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}}^{2}$, which is conformal to an\nEinstein metric (the Chen-LeBrun-Weber metric). We compare our approximation to\none given by Bunch and Donaldson and compute various geometric quantities. In\nparticular, we demonstrate a small eigenvalue of the scalar Laplacian of the\nEinstein metric which gives a numerical evidence that the Einstein metric is\nconformally unstable under the Ricci flow.\n", "  Black phosphorus is a layered semiconductor that is intensely researched in\nview of applications in optoelectronics. In this Letter, we investigate a\nmulti-layer black phosphorus photo-detector that is capable of acquiring\nhigh-contrast (V>0.9) images both in the visible ({\\lambda}_{VIS}=532nm) as\nwell as in the infrared ({\\lambda}_{IR}=1550nm) spectral regime. In a first\nstep, by using photocurrent microscopy, we map the active area of the device\nand we characterize responsivity and gain. In a second step, by deploying the\nblack phosphorus device as a point-like detector in a confocal microsope setup,\nwe acquire diffraction-limited optical images with sub-micron resolution. The\nresults demonstrate the usefulness of black phosphorus as an optoelectronic\nmaterial for hyperspectral imaging applications.\n", "  Passive dynamic walking is a useful model for investigating the mechanical\nfunctions of the body that produce energy-efficient walking. The basin of\nattraction is very small and thin, and it has a fractal-like shape; this\nexplains the difficulty in producing stable passive dynamic walking. The\nunderlying mechanism that produces these geometric characteristics was not\nknown.\n  In this paper, we consider this from the viewpoint of dynamical systems\ntheory, and we use the simplest walking model to clarify the mechanism that\nforms the basin of attraction for passive dynamic walking. We show that the\nintrinsic saddle-type hyperbolicity of the upright equilibrium point in the\ngoverning dynamics plays an important role in the geometrical characteristics\nof the basin of attraction; this contributes to our understanding of the\nstability mechanism of bipedal walking.\n", "  We study the GMGHS spacetimes to analyze the evolution of the anisotropy\nuniverse, which can be treated as a doubly warped products manifold possessing\nwarping functions (or scale factor) having the Kantowski-Sachs solution which\nrepresents homogeneous but anisotropically expanding(contracting) cosmology. We\ninvestigate the curvature associated with three phases in the evolution of the\nuniverse.\n", "  Ion channels are of major interest and form an area of intensive research in\nthe fields of biophysics and medicine since they control many vital\nphysiological functions. The aim of this work is on one hand to propose a fully\nstochastic and discrete model describing the main characteristics of a multiple\nchannel system. The movement of the ions is coupled, as usual, with a Poisson\nequation for the electrical field; we have considered, in addition, the\ninfluence of exclusion forces. On the other hand, we have discussed about the\nnondimensionalization of the stochastic system by using real physical\nparameters, all supported by numerical simulations. The specific features of\nboth cases of micro- and nanochannels have been taken in due consideration with\nparticular attention to the latter case in order to show that it is necessary\nto consider a discrete and stochastic model for ions movement inside the\nchannels.\n", "  We review the basic principles of X-ray polarimetry and current detector\ntechnologies based on the photoelectric effect, Bragg reflection, and Compton\nscattering. Recent technological advances in high-spatial-resolution gas-filled\nX-ray detectors have enabled efficient polarimeters exploiting the\nphotoelectric effect that hold great scientific promise for X-ray polarimetry\nin the 2-10 keV band. Advances in the fabrication of multilayer optics have\nmade feasible the construction of broad-band soft X-ray polarimeters based on\nBragg reflection. Developments in scintillator and solid-state hard X-ray\ndetectors facilitate construction of both modular, large area Compton\nscattering polarimeters and compact devices suitable for use with focusing\nX-ray telescopes.\n", "  We study angular-momentum couplings in $^{87}$Rb$_2$ Rydberg molecules formed\nbetween Rydberg and 5S$_{1/2}$ ground-state atoms. We use a Fermi model that\nincludes S-wave and P-wave singlet and triplet scattering of the Rydberg\nelectron with the 5S$_{1/2}$ atom, along with the fine structure coupling of\nthe Rydberg atom and hyperfine structure coupling of the 5S$_{1/2}$ atom. We\ndiscuss the effects of these couplings on the adiabatic molecular potentials.\nWe obtain bound-state energies, lifetimes, and electric and magnetic dipole\nmoments for the vibrational ground states of the $^{87}$Rb$(n$D$+5$S$_{1/2})$\nmolecules in all adiabatic potentials, with fine and hyperfine structure\nincluded. We also study the effect of the hyperfine structure on the deep\n$^3$S-wave- and $^3$P-wave-dominated adiabatic molecular potentials, which\nsupport high-$\\ell$ $^{87}$Rb$_2$ Rydberg molecules.\n", "  We present a new high-resolution global renewable energy atlas ({REatlas})\nthat can be used to calculate customised hourly time series of wind and solar\nPV power generation. In this paper, the atlas is applied to produce\n32-year-long hourly model wind power time series for Denmark for each\nhistorical and future year between 1980 and 2035. These are calibrated and\nvalidated against real production data from the period 2000 to 2010. The high\nnumber of years allows us to discuss how the characteristics of Danish wind\npower generation varies between individual weather years. As an example, the\nannual energy production is found to vary by $\\pm10\\%$ from the average.\nFurthermore, we show how the production pattern change as small onshore\nturbines are gradually replaced by large onshore and offshore turbines.\nFinally, we compare our wind power time series for 2020 to corresponding data\nfrom a handful of Danish energy system models. The aim is to illustrate how\ncurrent differences in model wind may result in significant differences in\ntechnical and economical model predictions. These include up to $15\\%$\ndifferences in installed capacity and $40\\%$ differences in system reserve\nrequirements.\n", "  Measurements with variable system-detector interaction strength, ranging from\nweak to strong, have been recently reported in a number of electronic\nnanosystems. In several such instances many-body effects play a significant\nrole. Here we consider the weak--to--strong crossover for a setup consisting of\nan electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where a second interferometer is\nemployed as a detector. In the context of a conditional which-path protocol, we\ndefine a generalized conditional value (GCV), and determine its full crossover\nbetween the regimes of weak and strong (projective) measurement. We find that\nthe GCV has an oscillatory dependence on the system-detector interaction\nstrength. These oscillations are a genuine many-body effect, and can be\nexperimentally observed through the voltage dependence of cross current\ncorrelations.\n", "  Supernova (SN) feedback is one of the key processes shaping the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) of galaxies. SNe contribute to (and in some cases may dominate)\ndriving turbulence in the ISM and accelerating galactic winds. Modern\ncosmological simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the main\nstructures in the ISM of galaxies, but are typically still not capable of\nexplicitly resolving all of the small-scale stellar feedback processes,\nincluding the expansion of supernova remnants (SNRs). We perform a series of\ncontrolled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (adaptive mesh refinement)\nsimulations of single SNRs expanding in an inhomogeneous density field with\nstatistics motivated by those of the turbulent ISM. We use these to quantify\nthe momentum and thermal energy injection from SNe as a function of spatial\nscale and the density, metallicity, and structure of the ambient medium. We\ndevelop a series of analytic formulae that we fit to the simulations. These\nformulae can be used as a basis for a more predictive sub-resolution model for\nSN feedback for galaxy formation simulations. We then use simulations of\nmultiple, stochastically driven SNe that resolve the key phases of SNRs to test\nthe sub-resolution model, and show that it accurately captures the turbulent\nkinetic energy and thermal energy in the ISM. By contrast, proposed SN feedback\nmodels in the literature based on `delayed cooling' significantly overpredict\nthe late-time thermal energy and momentum in SNRs.\n", "  We consider a finite, closed and selfbound many--body system in which a\ncollective degree of freedom is excited. The redistribution of energy and\nmomentum into a finite number of the non-collective degrees of freedom is\nreferred to as spreading as opposed to damping in open systems. Spreading\nclosely relates to thermalization, but while thermalization requires\nnon-integrability, spreading can also present in integrable systems. We\nidentify subtle features which determine the onset of spreading in an\nintegrable model and compare the result with a non--integrable case.\n", "  Although it is widely accepted that photospheric motions provide the energy\nsource and that the magnetic field must play a key role in the process, the\ndetailed mechanisms responsible for heating the Sun's corona and accelerating\nthe solar wind are still not fully understood. Cranmer et al. (2007) developed\na sophisticated, 1D, time-steady model of the solar wind with turbulence\ndissipation. By varying the coronal magnetic field, they obtain, for a single\nchoice of wave properties, a realistic range of slow and fast wind conditions\nwith a sharp latitudinal transition between the two streams. Using a 1D,\ntime-dependent model of the solar wind of Lionello et al. (2014), which\nincorporates turbulent dissipation of Alfv\\'en waves to provide heating and\nacceleration of the plasma, we have explored a similar configuration, obtaining\nqualitatively equivalent results. However, our calculations suggest that the\nrapid transition between slow and fast wind suggested by this 1D model may be\ndisrupted in multidimensional MHD simulations by the requirement of transverse\nforce balance.\n", "  We present a modified scheme for detection of the magneto-optical rotation\n(MOR) effect, where a linearly polarized laser field is interacting with cold\n$^{87}$Rb atoms in an integrating sphere. The rotation angle of the probe\nbeam's polarization plane is detected in the experiment. The results indicate\nthat the biased magnetic field, the probe light intensity and detuning, and the\ncold atoms' temperature are key parameters for the MOR effect. This scheme may\nimprove the contrast of the rotation signal and provide an useful approach for\nhigh contrast cold atom clocks and magnetometers.\n", "  We study the differential decay rate for the rare $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda (\\to\nN \\pi)\\ell^+\\ell^-$ transition, including a determination of the complete\nangular distribution, assuming unpolarized $\\Lambda_b$ baryons. On the basis of\na properly chosen parametrization of the various helicity amplitudes, we\nprovide expressions for the angular observables within the Standard Model and a\nsubset of new physics models with chirality-flipped operators. Hadronic effects\nat low recoil are estimated by combining information from lattice QCD with\n(improved) form-factor relations in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Our estimates\nfor large hadronic recoil -- at this stage -- are still rather uncertain\nbecause the baryonic input functions are not so well known, and\nnon-factorizable spectator effects have not been worked out systematically so\nfar. Still, our phenomenological analysis of decay asymmetries and angular\nobservables for $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda (\\to N \\pi)\\ell^+\\ell^-$ reveals that\nthis decay mode can provide new and complementary constraints on the Wilson\ncoefficients in radiative and semileptonic $b \\to s$ transitions compared to\nthe corresponding mesonic modes.\n", "  Numerous concise models such as preferential attachment have been put forward\nto reveal the evolution mechanisms of real-world networks, which show that\nreal-world networks are usually jointly driven by a hybrid mechanism of\nmultiplex features instead of a single pure mechanism. To get an accurate\nsimulation for real networks, some researchers proposed a few hybrid models of\nmixing multiple evolution mechanisms. Nevertheless, how a hybrid mechanism of\nmultiplex features jointly influence the network evolution is not very clear.\nIn this study, we introduce two methods (link prediction and likelihood\nanalysis) to measure multiple evolution mechanisms of complex networks. Through\ntremendous experiments on artificial networks, which can be controlled to\nfollow multiple mechanisms with different weights, we find the method based on\nlikelihood analysis performs much better and gives very accurate estimations.\nAt last, we apply this method to some real-world networks which are from\ndifferent domains (including technology networks and social networks) and\ndifferent countries (e.g., USA and China), to see how popularity and clustering\nco-evolve. We find most of them are affected by both popularity and clustering,\nbut with quite different weights.\n", "  Recently, the search for Majorana fermions has become one of the most\nprominent subjects in condensed matter physics. This search involves\nexplorations of new materials and hence offers interesting opportunities for\nchemistry. Theoretically, Majorana fermions may reside in various types of\ntopological superconductor materials, and superconducting Sn_{1-x}In_{x}Te,\nwhich is a doped topological crystalline insulator, is one of the promising\ncandidates to harbor Majorana fermions. Here, we report the first successful\ngrowth of superconducting Sn_{1-x}In_{x}Te nanoplates on Si substrates by a\nsimple vapor transport method without employing any catalyst. We observed\nrobust superconducting transitions in those nanoplates after device fabrication\nand found that the relation between the critical temperature and the carrier\ndensity is consistent with that of bulk single crystals, suggesting that the\nsuperconducting properties of the nanoplate devices are essentially the same as\nthose of bulk crystals. With the help of nanofabrication, those nanoplates\nwould prove useful for elucidating the potentially topological nature of\nsuperconductivity in Sn_{1-x}In_{x}Te to harbor Majorana fermions and thereby\ncontribute to the future quantum technologies.\n", "  We propose a new type of sensor, which uses diamond containing the optically\nactive nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) centres as a laser medium. The magnetometer\ncan be operated at room-temperature and generates light that can be readily\nfibre coupled, thereby permitting use in industrial applications and remote\nsensing. By combining laser pumping with a radio-frequency Rabi-drive field, an\nexternal magnetic field changes the fluorescence of the NV$^-$ centres. We use\nthis change in fluorescence level to push the laser above threshold, turning it\non with an intensity controlled by the external magnetic field, which provides\na coherent amplification of the readout signal with very high contrast. This\nmechanism is qualitatively different from conventional NV$^-$--based\nmagnetometers which use fluorescence measurements, based on incoherent photon\nemission. We term our approach laser threshold magnetometry (LTM). We predict\nthat an NV$^-$--based laser threshold magnetometer with a volume of 1mm$^3$ can\nachieve shot-noise limited d.c.~sensitivity of 1.86 fT$/\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ and\na.c.~sensitivity of 3.97fT$/\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$.\n", "  Many recent studies on water have conjectured a complex structure composed of\nhydrogen bonded low- and high-density domains. In this work the structure of\npure water and aqueous solutions of silica gel (TEOS) has been investigated by\nusing delayed luminescence, which previously have showed significant increase\nin aqueous salt solutions where low-density domain formation is expected.\nPhoton emission shows an Arrhenius trend with an activation energy in\nwater-TEOS solutions larger than in pure water and salt-water solutions.\nMoreover, delayed photon emission decay shows an intrinsic lifetime of about 5\nmicroseconds both in solutions and in pure water that, along with secondary\nlifetimes induced by the presence of TEOS, could be related to the formation of\ndifferent domains.\n", "  We demonstrate an elastically-tunable self-assembled quantum dot in a\nnanowire antenna that emits single photons with resolution-limited spectral\nlinewidths. The single-photon device is comprised of a single quantum dot\nembedded in a top-down fabricated nanowire waveguide integrated onto a\npiezoelectric actuator. Non-resonant excitation leads to static (fluctuating)\ncharges likely at the nanowire surface, causing DC Stark shifts (inhomogeneous\nbroadening); for low excitation powers, the effects are not observed and\nresolution-limited linewidths are obtained. Despite significant strain-field\nrelaxation in the high-aspect-ratio nanowires, we achieve up to 1.2 meV tuning\nof a dot's transition energy. Single-photon sources with high brightness,\nresolution-limited linewidths, and wavelength tunability are promising for\nfuture quantum technologies.\n", "  We investigate the parity nonconservation effect in the elastic scattering of\npolarized electrons on heavy He-like ions, being initially in the ground state.\nThe enhancement of the parity violation is achieved by tuning the energy of the\nincident electron in resonance with quasidegenerate doubly-excited states of\nthe corresponding Li-like ion. We consider two possible scenarios. In the first\none we assume that the polarization of the scattered electron is measured,\nwhile in the second one it is not detected.\n", "  We present results on the search for a light charged Higgs boson that can be\nproduced in the decay of a top quark and later decays into a charm and an\nantistrange quark. The analysis is performed using $19.7\\invfb$ pp collison\ndata recorded with the CMS detector at LHC.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted substantial attention in\nelectronic and optoelectronic applications with superior advantages of being\nflexible, transparent and highly tunable. Gapless graphene exhibits\nultra-broadband and fast photoresponse while the 2D semiconducting MoS2 and\nGaTe unveil high sensitivity and tunable responsivity to visible light.\nHowever, the device yield and the repeatability call for a further improvement\nof the 2D materials to render large-scale uniformity. Here we report a\nlayer-by-layer growth of wafer-scale GaTe with a hole mobility of 28.4 cm2/Vs\nby molecular beam epitaxy. The arrayed p-n junctions were developed by growing\nfew-layer GaTe directly on three-inch Si wafers. The resultant diodes reveal\ngood rectifying characteristics, photoresponse with a maximum photoresponsivity\nof 2.74 A/W and a high photovoltaic external quantum efficiency up to 62%. The\nphotocurrent reaches saturation fast enough to capture a time constant of 22\n{\\mu}s and shows no sign of device degradation after 1.37 million cycles of\noperation. Most strikingly, such high performance has been achieved across the\nentire wafer, making the volume production of devices accessible. Finally,\nseveral photo-images were acquired by the GaTe/Si photodiodes with a reasonable\ncontrast and spatial resolution, demonstrating for the first time the potential\nof integrating the 2D materials with the silicon technology for novel\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  Context: Characterization of instrumental effects in astronomical imaging is\nimportant in order to extract accurate physical information from the\nobservations. The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually\nrepresented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function\n(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by\nother sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating\nboth the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is\nill-posed.\n  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image\nregularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our\nmethod does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to\nany telescope.\n  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak\nassumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the\nocculting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to\nretain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,\ntranslated and interchanged solutions. Under an additive Gaussian noise\nassumption, they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction\nartifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred\nobservations and the cleaned data.\n  Results: Our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data. The PSF is\nestimated for the SECCHI/EUVI instrument using the 2007 Lunar transit, and for\nSDO/AIA using the 2012 Venus transit. Results show that the proposed\nnon-parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the\nPSF with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature. We\nalso show that, if these parametric estimations are incorporated in the\nacquisition model, the resulting PSF outperforms both the parametric and\nnon-parametric methods.\n", "  The core-halo approach of Levin et al.\\ [Phys.\\ Rep.\\ {\\bf 535}, 1 (2014)]\nfor the violent relaxation of long-range interacting systems with a waterbag\ninitial conditions is revisited for the case of the Hamiltonian Mean Field\nmodel. The Gibbs entropy maximization principle is considered with the\nconstraints of energy conservation and of infinite Casimir invariants of the\nVlasov equation. All parameters in the core-halo distribution function are then\ncompletely determined without resorting to the envelope equation for the\ncontour of the initial state, which was required in the original approach. We\nalso show that a different ansatz is possible for the core-halo distribution\nwith similar or even better results. This work also evidences a link between a\nparametric resonance causing the non-equilibrium phase transition in the HMF\nmodel, a purely dynamical property, and a discontinuity of the\n(non-equilibrium) entropy of the system.\n", "  Fully homomorphic encryption is an encryption method with the property that\nany computation on the plaintext can be performed by a party having access to\nthe ciphertext only. Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum\nhomomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such\nthat quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our\nschemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for\ncircuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion\nof the circuit (we use the \"$\\pi/8$\" non-Clifford group gate, which is also\nknown as the $T$-gate).\n  More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a\ndecryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of\n$T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with\nthe total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of\nlength given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate\ndepth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant\n$T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption\nscheme.\n  A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of\nencryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability\nunder chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In\nthis context, we show the equivalence of several definitions.\n  Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern\ncryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical\nresults establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number\nof multiplication gates. Historically, such results appeared as precursors to\nthe breakthrough result establishing classical fully homomorphic encryption.\n", "  In this review, we discuss recent progress in the explorations of topological\nmaterials beyond topological insulators; specifically, we focus on topological\ncrystalline insulators and bulk topological superconductors. The basic\nconcepts, model Hamiltonians, and novel electronic properties of these new\ntopological materials are explained. The key role of symmetries that underlie\ntheir topological properties is elucidated. Key issues in their materials\nrealizations are also discussed.\n", "  We show that congruent electric, magnetic and non-resonant optical fields\nacting concurrently on a polar paramagnetic (and polarisable) molecule offer\npossibilities to both amplify and control the directionality of the ensuing\nmolecular states that surpass those available in double-field combinations or\nin single fields alone. At the core of these triple-field effects is the\nlifting of the degeneracy of the projection quantum number $M$ by the magnetic\nfield superimposed on the optical field and a subsequent coupling of the\nmembers of the \"doubled\" (for states with $M \\neq 0$) tunneling doublets due to\nthe optical field by even a weak electrostatic field.\n", "  The layered 5d transition metal oxides like Sr2IrO4 have attracted\nsignificant interest recently due to a number of exotic and new phenomena\ninduced by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling, bandwidth W and\non-site Coulomb correlation U. In contrast to a metallic behavior expected from\nthe Mott-Hubbard model due to more spatially extended 5d orbitals and moderate\nU, an insulating ground state has been observed in Sr2IrO4. Such an insulating\nbehavior can be understood by an effective J_eff=1/2 Mott insulator model by\nincorporating both electron correlation and strong spin-orbital coupling,\nalthough its validity remains under debate at present. In particular, Sr2IrO4\nexhibits a number of similarities to the high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors in the crystal structure, electronic structure, magnetic\nstructure, and even possible high temperature superconductivity. Here we report\na new observation of the anomalous high energy electronic structure in Sr2IrO4.\nBy taking high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on Sr2IrO4\nover a wide energy range, we have revealed that the high energy electronic\nstructures show unusual nearly-vertical bands that extend over a large energy\nrange. Such anomalous high energy behaviors resemble the high energy waterfall\nfeatures observed in the cuprate superconductors, adding one more important\nsimilarity between these two systems. While strong electron correlation plays\nan important role in producing high energy waterfall features in the cuprate\nsuperconductors, the revelation of the high energy anomalies in Sr2IrO4 points\nto a novel route in generating exotic electronic excitations from the strong\nspin-orbit coupling and a moderate electron correlation.\n", "  The problem of obtaining a gauge independent beta function for Newton's\nconstant is addressed. By a specific parameterisation of metric fluctuations a\ngauge independent functional integral is constructed for the semiclassical\ntheory around an arbitrary Einstein space. The effective action then has the\nproperty that only physical polarisations of the graviton contribute, while all\nother modes cancel with the functional measure. We are then able to compute a\ngauge independent beta function for Newton's constant in $d$-dimensions to\none-loop order. No Landau pole is present provided $N_g < 18$, where $N_g =\nd(d-3)/2$ is the number of polarisations of the graviton. While adding a large\nnumber of matter fields can change this picture, the absence of a pole persists\nfor the particle content of the standard model in four spacetime dimensions.\n", "  The thermodynamics for a system with given temperature, density, and volume\nis described by the Canonical ensemble. The thermodynamics for a corresponding\nsystem with the same temperature, volume, and average density is described by\nthe Grand Canonical ensemble. In general a chosen thermodynamic potential\n(e.g., free energy) is different in the two cases. Their relationship is\nconsidered here as a function of the system size. Exact expressions relating\nthe fundamental potential for each (free energy and pressure, respectively) are\nidentified for arbitrary system size. A formal asymptotic analysis for large\nsystem size gives the expected equivalence, but without any characterization of\nthe intermediate size dependence. More detailed evaluation is provided for the\nsimple case of a homogeneous, non-interacting Fermi gas. In this case, the\norigin of size dependence arises from only two length scales, the average\ninter-particle distance and quantum length scale (thermal deBroglie or Fermi\nlength). The free energies per particle calculated from each ensemble are\ncompared for particle numbers $2\\le N\\le 64$ for a range of temperatures above\nand below the Fermi temperature. The relevance of these results for\napplications of density functional theory is discussed briefly.\n", "  In a companion paper we have reported a $>5\\sigma$ detection of degree scale\n$B $-mode polarization at 150 GHz by the BICEP2 experiment. Here we provide a\ndetailed study of potential instrumental systematic contamination to that\nmeasurement. We focus extensively on spurious polarization that can potentially\narise from beam imperfections. We present a heuristic classification of beam\nimperfections according to their symmetries and uniformities, and discuss how\nresulting contamination adds or cancels in maps that combine observations made\nat multiple orientations of the telescope about its boresight axis. We\nintroduce a technique, which we call \"deprojection\", for filtering the leading\norder beam-induced contamination from time ordered data, and show that it\nremoves power from BICEP2's $BB$ spectrum consistent with predictions using\nhigh signal-to-noise beam shape measurements. We detail the simulation pipeline\nthat we use to directly simulate instrumental systematics and the calibration\ndata used as input to that pipeline. Finally, we present the constraints on\n$BB$ contamination from individual sources of potential systematics. We find\nthat systematics contribute $BB$ power that is a factor $\\sim10\\times$ below\nBICEP2's 3-year statistical uncertainty, and negligible compared to the\nobserved $BB$ signal. The contribution to the best-fit tensor/scalar ratio is\nat a level equivalent to $r=(3-6)\\times10^{-3}$.\n", "  We compute some normalized structure constants in the $\\eta$-deformed\n$AdS_5\\times S^5$ in the framework of the semiclassical approach. This is done\nfor the cases when the \"heavy\" string states are finite-size giant magnons\ncarrying one angular momentum and for three different choices of the \"light\"\nstate: primary scalar operators, dilaton operator with nonzero momentum,\nsinglet scalar operators on higher string levels. Since the dual field theory\nis still unknown, the results obtained here must be considered as conjectures\nor as predictions from the string theory side.\n  Keywords: Gauge/string duality, Correlation functions\n  PACS:11.25.-w, 11.25.Tq\n", "  While all materials reduce their intrinsic volume under hydrostatic (uniform)\ncompression, a select few actually \\emph{expand} along one or more directions\nduring this process of densification. As rare as it is counterintuitive, such\n\"negative compressibility\" behaviour has application in the design of pressure\nsensors, artificial muscles and actuators. The recent discovery of surprisingly\nstrong and persistent negative compressibility effects in a variety of new\nfamilies of materials has ignited the field. Here we review the phenomenology\nof negative compressibility in this context of materials diversity, placing\nparticular emphasis on the common structural motifs that recur amongst known\nexamples. Our goal is to present a mechanistic understanding of negative\ncompressibility that will help inform a clear strategy for future materials\ndesign.\n", "  Based on the Born-Oppemheimer approximation, we divide total electron\nHamiltonian in a spinorbit coupled system into slow orbital motion and fast\ninterband transition process. We find that the fast motion induces a gauge\nfield on slow orbital motion, perpendicular to electron momentum, inducing a\ntopological phase. From this general designing principle, we present a theory\nfor generating artificial gauge field and topological phase in a conventional\ntwo-dimensional electron gas embedded in parabolically graded\nGaAs/In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs quantum wells with antidot lattices. By tuning\nthe etching depth and period of antidot lattices, the band folding caused by\nsuperimposed potential leads to formation of minibands and band inversions\nbetween the neighboring subbands. The intersubband spin-orbit interaction opens\nconsiderably large nontrivial minigaps and leads to many pairs of helical edge\nstates in these gaps.\n", "  F.E. Harris has been a significant partner in our work on orbital-free\ndensity functional approximations for use in ab initio molecular dynamics. Here\nwe mention briefly the essential progress on single-point functionals since our\noriginal paper (2006). Then we focus on the advantages and limitations of\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) non-interacting kinetic-energy\nfunctionals. We reconsider the constraints provided by near-origin conditions\nin atomic-like systems and their relationship to regularized versus physical\nexternal potentials. Then we seek the best empirical GGA for the\nnon-interacting KE for a modest-sized set of molecules with a well-defined\nnear-origin behavior of their densities. The search is motivated by a desire\nfor insight into GGA limitations and for a target for constraint-based\ndevelopment.\n", "  Spherical collapse of the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) dark matter model is\nstudied in the Thomas Fermi approximation. The evolution of the overdensity of\nthe collapsed region and its expansion rate are calculated for two scenarios.\nWe consider the case of a sharp phase transition (which happens when the\ncritical temperature is reached) from the normal dark matter state to the\ncondensate one and the case of a smooth first order phase transition where\nthere is a continuous conversion of \"normal\" dark matter to the BEC phase. We\npresent numerical results for the physics of the collapse for a wide range of\nthe model's space parameter, i.e. the mass of the scalar particle $m_{\\chi}$\nand the scattering length $l_s$. We show the dependence of the transition\nredshift on $m_{\\chi}$ and $l_s$. Since small scales collapse earlier and\neventually before the BEC phase transition the evolution of collapsing halos in\nthis limit is indeed the same in both the CDM and the BEC models. Differences\nare expected to appear only on the largest astrophysical scales. However, we\nargue that the BEC model is almost indistinguishable from the usual dark matter\nscenario concerning the evolution of nonlinear perturbations above typical\nclusters scales, i.e., $\\gtrsim 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$. This provides an analytical\nconfirmation for recent results from cosmological numerical simulations [H.-Y.\nSchive {\\it et al.}, Nature Physics, {\\bf10}, 496 (2014)].\n", "  The collimation and evolution of relativistic outflows in $\\gamma$-ray bursts\n(GRBs) are determined by their interaction with the stellar envelope through\nwhich they travel before reaching the much larger distance where the energy is\ndissipated and $\\gamma$-rays are produced. We consider the case of a Poynting\nflux dominated relativistic outflow and show that it suffers strong\ninverse-Compton (IC) scattering drag near the stellar surface and the jet is\nslowed down to sub-relativistic speed if its initial magnetization parameter\n($\\sigma_0$) is larger than about 10$^5$. If the temperature of the cocoon\nsurrounding the jet were to be larger than about 10 keV, then an optically\nthick layer of electrons and positrons forms at the interface of the cocoon and\nthe jet, and one might expect this pair screen to protect the interior of the\njet from IC drag. However, the pair screen turns out to be ephemeral, and\ninstead of shielding the jet it speeds up the IC drag on it. Although a high\n$\\sigma_0$ jet might not survive its passage through the star, a fraction of\nits energy is converted to 1-100 MeV radiation that escapes the star and\nappears as a bright flash lasting for about 10 s.\n", "  Particle methods are a ubiquitous tool for solving the Vlasov-Poisson\nequation in comoving coordinates, which is used to model the gravitational\nevolution of dark matter in an expanding universe. However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,\nsmall-scale \"clumping\" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when\nthe perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian\ncoordinate axes.\n", "  Parallel slit-slit devices are commonly used to measure the transverse\nemittance of a particle beam, selecting a portion of the beam with the front\nslit and measuring the angular distribution with the rear. This paper\ncalculates the effect of finite slit sizes on measured emittance and Twiss\nfunctions in the case of Gaussian spatial and angular distributions of the\noncoming beam. A formula for recovering the true emittance from the measured\nvalues is derived.\n", "  We study type II universal metrics of the Lorentzian signature. These metrics\nsimultaneously solve vacuum field equations of all theories of gravitation with\nthe Lagrangian being a polynomial curvature invariant constructed from the\nmetric, the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives of an arbitrary order.\n  We provide examples of type II universal metrics for all composite number\ndimensions. On the other hand, we have no examples for prime number dimensions\nand we prove the non-existence of type II universal spacetimes in five\ndimensions.\n  We also present type II vacuum solutions of selected classes of gravitational\ntheories, such as Lovelock, quadratic and L(Riemann) gravities.\n", "  The known ground state of ultrathin smectic films confined to the surface of\na sphere is described by four +1/2 defects assembled on a great circle and a\ndirector which follows geodesic lines. Using a simple perturbative approach we\nshow that for thick smectic films on a sphere with planar anchoring this\nsolution breaks down, distorting the smectic layers. The instability happens\nwhen the bend elastic constant exceeds the anchoring strength times the radius\nof the inner sphere. Above this threshold, the formation of a periodic\nchevron-like structure, observed experimentally as well, relieves geometric\nfrustration. We quantify the effect of thickness and curvature of smectic\nshells and provide insight into the wavelength of the observed texture.\n", "  We perform a coupled-channel analysis of pseudodata for the D+-> K-pi+pi+\nDalitz plot. The pseudodata are generated from the isobar model of the E791\nCollaboration, and are reasonably realistic. We demonstrate that it is feasible\nto analyze the high-quality data within a coupled-channel framework that\ndescribes the final state interaction of D+-> K-pi+pi+ as multiple\nrescatterings of three pseudoscalar mesons through two-pseudoscalar-meson\ninteractions in accordance with the two-body and three-body unitarity. The\ntwo-pseudoscalar-meson interactions are designed to reproduce empirical pi pi\nand pi bar K scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we also include mechanisms\nthat are beyond simple iterations of the two-body interactions, i.e., a\nthree-meson force, derived from the hidden local symmetry model. A picture of\nhadronic dynamics in D+-> K-pi+pi+ described by our coupled-channel model is\nfound to be quite different from those of the previous isobar-type analyses.\nFor example, we find that the D+-> K-pi+pi+ decay width can get almost\ntriplicated when the rescattering mechanisms are turned on. Among the\nrescattering mechanisms, those associated with the rho(770) bar K0 channel,\nwhich contribute to D+-> K-pi+pi+ only through a channel coupling, give a large\ncontribution, and significantly improve the quality of the fits. The K-pi+\ns-wave amplitude from our analysis is reasonably consistent with those\nextracted from the E791 model independent partial-wave analysis; the hadronic\nrescattering and the coupling to the rho(770) bar K0 channel play a major role\nhere. We also find that the dressed D+ decay vertices have phases, induced by\nthe strong rescatterings, that strongly depend on the momenta of the final\npseudoscalar mesons. Although the conventional isobar-type analyses have\nassumed the phases to be constant, this common assumption is not supported by\nour more microscopic viewpoint.\n", "  The recent discovery that Einstein once attempted - and quickly abandoned - a\nsteady-state model of the expanding universe sheds new light on his\nphilosophical journey from static to dynamic cosmologies.\n", "  Cherenkov Telescopes are equipped with optical dishes of large diameter -- in\ngeneral based on segmented mirrors -- with typical angular resolution of a few\narc-minutes. To evaluate the mirror's quality specific metrological systems are\nrequired that possibly take into account the environmental conditions in which\ntypically these telescopes operate (in open air without dome protection). For\nthis purpose a new facility for the characterization of mirrors has been\ndeveloped at the labs of the Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera of the Italian\nNational Institute of Astrophysics. The facility allows the precise measurement\nof the radius of curvature and the distribution of the concentred light in\nterms of focused and scattered components and it works in open air. In this\npaper we describe the facility and report some examples of its measuring\ncapabilities.\n", "  Hard xray data from the RXTE observatory (HEXTE energy range 15 to 240 keV)\nhave been analyzed to obtain a phase coherent timing solution for the Crab\npulsar glitch of 15 July 2000. The results are: (1) step change in the rotation\nfrequency $\\nu_0$ of the Crab pulsar at the epoch of the glitch is $\\Delta\n\\nu_0 = (30 \\pm 3) \\times 10^{-9} \\times \\nu_0$, (2) step change in its time\nderivative is $\\Delta \\dot \\nu_0 = (4.8 \\pm 0.6) \\times 10^{-3} \\times \\dot\n\\nu_0$, and (3) the time scale of decay of the the step change is $\\tau_d = 4.7\n\\pm 0.5$ days. The first two results are consistent with those obtained at\nradio frequencies by the Jodrell Bank observatory. The last result has not been\nquoted in the literature, but could be an underestimate due to lack of\nobservations very close to the glitch epoch. By comparing with the monthly\ntiming ephemeris published by the Jodrell group for the Crab pulsar, the time\ndelay between the main peaks of the hard xray and radio pulse profiles is\nestimated to be $+411 \\pm 167$ $\\mu$sec. Although this number is not very\nsignificant, it is consistent with the number derived for the 2 to 16 keV\nenergy range, using the PCA instrument of RXTE. The separation between the two\npeaks of the integrated pulse profile of the Crab pulsar, and the ratio of\ntheir intensities, both are statistically similar before and after the glitch.\nThe dead time corrected integrated photon flux within the integrated pulse\nprofile appears to decrease after the glitch, although this is not a\nstatistically strong result. This work achieves what can be considered to be\nalmost absolute timing analysis of the Crab pulsar hard xray data.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency has the unique ability to optically\ncontrol transparency windows with low light in atomic systems. However, its\npractical applications in quantum physics and information science are limited\ndue to rigid experimental requirements. Here, we demonstrate a new mechanism of\noptically induced transparency in a micro-cavity by introducing a four-wave\nmixing gain to nonlinearly couple two separated resonances of the micro-cavity\nin an ambient environment. A signature Fano-like resonance was observed owing\nto the nonlinear interference of the two coupled resonances. Moreover, we show\nthat the unidirectional gain of the four-wave mixing can lead to the remarkable\neffect of non-reciprocal transmission at the transparency windows. Optically\ninduced transparency may offer a unique platform for a compact, integrated\nsolution to all-optical and quantum information.\n", "  We present a structural data set of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids and\ntheir amino-methylated and acetylated (capped) dipeptides. Different\nprotonation states of the backbone (uncharged and zwitterionic) were considered\nfor the amino acids as well as varied side chain protonation states.\nFurthermore, we studied amino acids and dipeptides in complex with divalent\ncations (Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+). The database covers the\nconformational hierarchies of 280 systems in a wide relative energy range of up\nto 4 eV (390 kJ/mol), summing up to an overall of 45,892 stationary points on\nthe respective potential-energy surfaces. All systems were calculated on equal\nfirst-principles footing, applying density-functional theory in the generalized\ngradient approximation corrected for long-range van der Waals interactions. We\nshow good agreement to available experimental data for gas-phase ion\naffinities. Our curated data can be utilized, for example, for a wide\ncomparison across chemical space of the building blocks of life, for the\nparametrization of protein force fields, and for the calculation of reference\nspectra for biophysical applications.\n", "  We study the conductivity of graphene with a smooth but\nparticle-hole-asymmetric disorder potential. Using perturbation theory for the\nweak-disorder regime and numerical calculations we investigate how the\nparticle-hole asymmetry shifts the position of the minimal conductivity away\nfrom the Dirac point $\\varepsilon = 0$. We find that the conductivity minimum\nis shifted in opposite directions for weak and strong disorder. For large\ndisorder strengths the conductivity minimum appears close to the doping level\nfor which electron and hole doped regions (\"puddles\") are equal in size.\n", "  The alignments between galaxies, their underlying matter structures, and the\ncosmic web constitute vital ingredients for a comprehensive understanding of\ngravity, the nature of matter, and structure formation in the Universe. We\nprovide an overview on the state of the art in the study of these alignment\nprocesses and their observational signatures, aimed at a non-specialist\naudience. The development of the field over the past one hundred years is\nbriefly reviewed. We also discuss the impact of galaxy alignments on\nmeasurements of weak gravitational lensing, and discuss avenues for making\ntheoretical and observational progress over the coming decade.\n", "  Galaxy shapes are not randomly oriented, rather they are statistically\naligned in a way that can depend on formation environment, history and galaxy\ntype. Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important\ninformation about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the\ngrowth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key\nmeasurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and\nenvironment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand\nthe observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational\nlensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an\nadded importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of\ngravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This\nmakes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an\nimportant systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of\nintrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical\nmitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic\nalignments.\n", "  The shapes of galaxies are not randomly oriented on the sky. During the\ngalaxy formation and evolution process, environment has a strong influence, as\ntidal gravitational fields in the large-scale structure tend to align nearby\ngalaxies. Additionally, events such as galaxy mergers affect the relative\nalignments of both the shapes and angular momenta of galaxies throughout their\nhistory. These \"intrinsic galaxy alignments\" are known to exist, but are still\npoorly understood. This review will offer a pedagogical introduction to the\ncurrent theories that describe intrinsic galaxy alignments, including the\napparent difference in intrinsic alignment between early- and late-type\ngalaxies and the latest efforts to model them analytically. It will then\ndescribe the ongoing efforts to simulate intrinsic alignments using both N-body\nand hydrodynamic simulations. Due to the relative youth of this field, there is\nstill much to be done to understand intrinsic galaxy alignments and this review\nsummarises the current state of the field, providing a solid basis for future\nwork.\n", "  We propose the continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol based on\nthe Gaussian modulation of a single quadrature of the coherent states of light,\nwhich is aimed to provide simplified implementation compared to the\nsymmetrically modulated Gaussian coherent-state protocols. The protocol waives\nthe necessity in phase quadrature modulation and the corresponding channel\ntransmittance estimation. The security of the protocol against collective\nattacks in a generally phase-sensitive Gaussian channels is analyzed and is\nshown achievable upon certain conditions. Robustness of the protocol to channel\nimperfections is compared to that of the symmetrical coherent-state protocol.\nThe simplified unidimensional protocol is shown possible at a reasonable\nquantitative cost in terms of key rate and of tolerable channel excess noise.\n", "  We propose a practical quantum cryptographic scheme which combines high\ninformation capacity, such as provided by high-dimensional quantum\nentanglement, with the simplicity of a two-dimensional\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell test for security verification. By\napplying a state combining entanglement in a two-dimensional degree of freedom,\nsuch as photon polarization, with high-dimensional correlations in another\ndegree of freedom, such as photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) or path, the\nscheme provides a considerably simplified route towards security verification\nin quantum key distribution (QKD) aimed at exploiting high-dimensional quantum\nsystems for increased secure key rates. It also benefits from security against\ncollective attacks and is feasible using currently available technologies.\n", "  The three dimensional (3D) topological insulators are predicted to exhibit a\n3D Dirac semimetal state in critical regime of topological to trivial phase\ntransition. Here we demonstrate the first experimental evidence of 3D Dirac\nsemimetal state in topological insulator Bi2Se3 with bulk carrier concentration\nof ~ 10^19 cm^{-3}, using magneto-transport measurements. At low temperatures,\nthe resistivity of our Bi2Se3 crystal exhibits clear Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\noscillations above 6T. The analysis of these oscillations through\nLifshitz-Onsanger and Lifshitz-Kosevich theory reveals a non-trivial pi Berry\nphase coming from 3D bands, which is a decisive signature of 3D Dirac semimetal\nstate. The large value of Dingle temperature and natural selenium vacancies in\nour crystal suggest that the observed 3D Dirac semimetal state is an outcome of\nenhanced strain field and weaker effective spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  This paper reviews the emergence and progress of phosphorene FETs, all within\nabout a year. In such a short time, back-gated FETs evolved into top-gated\nFETs, gate length was reduced to the sub-micron range, passivation by high-k\ndielectrics or hexagonal boron nitride was demonstrated with temporal, thermal\nand mechanical stability, ohmic contact was achieved down to cryogenic\ntemperatures, and cutoff frequencies was pushed above 10 GHz. These and other\nattractive characteristics of phosphorene promise the phosphorene FET to be a\nviable candidate for current-generation flexible electronics as well as\nfuture-generation ultra-thin-body low-power-consumption high-speed and\nhigh-frequency transistors.\n", "  Chimera states are complex spatiotemporal patterns in networks of identical\noscillators, characterized by the coexistence of synchronized and\ndesynchronized dynamics. Here we propose to extend the phenomenon of chimera\nstates to the quantum regime, and uncover intriguing quantum signatures of\nthese states. We calculate the quantum fluctuations about semiclassical\ntrajectories and demonstrate that chimera states in the quantum regime can be\ncharacterized by bosonic squeezing, weighted quantum correlations, and measures\nof mutual information. Our findings reveal the relation of chimera states to\nquantum information theory, and give promising directions for experimental\nrealization of chimera states in quantum systems.\n", "  Valley degrees of freedom offer a potential resource for quantum information\nprocessing if they can be effectively controlled. We discuss an optical\napproach to this problem in which intense light breaks electronic symmetries of\na two-dimensional Dirac material. The resulting quasienergy structures may then\ndiffer for different valleys, so that the Floquet physics of the system can be\nexploited to produce highly polarized valley currents. This physics can be\nutilized to realize a valley valve whose behavior is determined optically. We\npropose a concrete way to achieve such valleytronics in graphene as well as in\na simple model of an inversion-symmetry broken Dirac material. We study the\neffect numerically and demonstrate its robustness against moderate disorder and\nsmall deviations in optical parameters.\n", "  It is shown how a chiral Lagrangian framework can be used to derive\nrelationships connecting quark-level QCD correlation functions to mesonic-level\ntwo-point functions. Crucial ingredients of this connection are scale factor\nmatrices relating each distinct quark-level substructure (e.g.,\nquark-antiquark, four-quark) to its mesonic counterpart. The scale factors and\nmixing angles are combined into a projection matrix to obtain the physical\n(hadronic) projection of the QCD correlation function matrix. Such\nrelationships provide a powerful bridge between chiral Lagrangians and QCD\nsum-rules that are particularly effective in studies of the substructure of\nlight scalar mesons with multiple complicated resonance shapes and substantial\nunderlying mixings. The validity of these connections is demonstrated for the\nexample of the isotriplet $a_0(980)$-$a_0(1450)$ system, resulting in an\nunambiguous determination of the scale factors from the combined inputs of QCD\nsum-rules and chiral Lagrangians. These scale factors lead to a remarkable\nagreement between the quark condensates in QCD and the mesonic vacuum\nexpectation values that induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in chiral\nLagrangians. This concrete example shows a clear sensitivity to the underlying\n$a_0$-system mixing angle, illustrating the value of this methodology in\nextensions to more complicated mesonic systems.\n", "  We have synthesized a new ferromagnetic topological insulator by doping Cr to\nthe ternary topological-insulator material TlSbTe2. Single crystals of\nTl_{1-x}Cr_{x}SbTe2 were grown by a melting method and it was found that Cr can\nbe incorporated into the TlSbTe2 matrix only within the solubility limit of\nabout 1%. The Curie temperature \\theta_c was found to increase with the Cr\ncontent but remained relatively low, with the maximum value of about 4 K. The\neasy axis was identified to be the c-axis and the saturation moment was 2.8\n\\mu_B (Bohr magneton) at 1.8 K. The in-plane resistivity of all the samples\nstudied showed metallic behavior with p-type carriers. Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)\noscillations were observed in samples with the Cr-doping level of up to 0.76%.\nWe also tried to induce ferromagnetism in TlBiTe2 by doping Cr, but no\nferromagnetism was observed in Cr-doped TlBiTe2 crystals within the solubility\nlimit of Cr which turned out to be also about 1%.\n", "  There is an apparent power deficit relative to the $\\Lambda$CDM prediction of\nthe CMB spectrum at large scales, which, though not yet statistically\nsignificant, persists from WMAP to Planck data. Proposals that invoke some form\nof initial condition for the inflation have been made to address this apparent\npower suppression, albeit with conflicting conclusions. By studying the\ncurvature perturbations of a scalar field in the FLRW universe parameterized by\nthe equation of state parameter $w$, we find that the large-scale spectrum at\nthe end of inflation reflects the super-horizon spectrum of the initial state.\nThe large-scale spectrum is suppressed if the universe begins with the\nadiabatic vacuum in a super-inflation ($w < -1$) or positive-pressure ($w > 0$)\nera. In the latter case, there is however no causal mechanism to establish the\ninitial adiabatic vacuum. On the other hand, as long as the universe begins\nwith the adiabatic vacuum in an era with $-1 < w < 0$, even if there exists an\nintermediate positive-pressure era, the large-scale spectrum would be enhanced\nrather than suppressed. We further calculate the spectrum of a two-stage\ninflation model with a two-field potential and show that the result agrees with\nthat obtained from the ad hoc single-field analysis.\n", "  In general relativity static gaseous atmospheres may be in hydrostatic\nbalance in the absence of a supporting stellar surface, provided that the\nluminosity is close to the Eddington value. We construct analytic models of\noptically thin, spherically symmetric shells supported by the radiation\npressure of a luminous central body in the Schwarzschild metric. Opacity is\nassumed to be dominated by Thomson scattering. The inner parts of the\natmospheres, where the luminosity locally has supercritical values, are\ncharacterized by a density and pressure inversion. The atmospheres are\nconvectively and Rayleigh-Taylor stable, and there is no outflow of gas.\n", "  The small-scale magnetic field is ubiquitous at the solar surface---even at\nhigh latitudes. From observations we know that this field is uncorrelated (or\nperhaps even weakly anticorrelated) with the global sunspot cycle. Our aim is\nto explore the origin, and particularly the cycle dependence of such a\nphenomenon using three-dimensional dynamo simulations. We adopt a simple model\nof a turbulent dynamo in a shearing box driven by helically forced turbulence.\nDepending on the dynamo parameters, large-scale (global) and small-scale\n(local) dynamos can be excited independently in this model. Based on\nsimulations in different parameter regimes, we find that, when only the\nlarge-scale dynamo is operating in the system, the small-scale magnetic field\ngenerated through shredding and tangling of the large-scale magnetic field is\npositively correlated with the global magnetic cycle. However, when both\ndynamos are operating, the small-scale field is produced from both the\nsmall-scale dynamo and the tangling of the large-scale field. In this\nsituation, when the large-scale field is weaker than the equipartition value of\nthe turbulence, the small-scale field is almost uncorrelated with the\nlarge-scale magnetic cycle. On the other hand, when the large-scale field is\nstronger than the equipartition value, we observe an anticorrelation between\nthe small-scale field and the large-scale magnetic cycle. This anticorrelation\ncan be interpreted as a suppression of the small-scale dynamo. Based on our\nstudies we conclude that the observed small-scale magnetic field in the Sun is\ngenerated by the combined mechanisms of small-scale dynamo and tangling of the\nlarge-scale field.\n", "  The magnetic sensing at nanoscale level is a promising and interesting\nresearch topic of nanoscience. Indeed, magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for\nprobing biological, chemical and physical systems. The study of small spin\ncluster, like magnetic molecules and nanoparticles, single electron, cold atom\nclouds, is one of the most stimulating challenges of applied and basic research\nof the next years. In particular, the magnetic nanoparticle investigation plays\na fundamental role for the modern material science and its relative\ntechnological applications like ferrofluids, magnetic refrigeration and\nbiomedical applications, including drug delivery, hyper-thermia cancer\ntreatment and magnetic resonance imaging contrast-agent. In this framework,\nseveral efforts have been devoted to the development of a high sensitivity\nmagnetic nanosensor pushing sensing capability to the individual spin level.\nAmong the different magnetic sensors, Superconducting QUantum Interference\nDevices (SQUIDs) exhibit an ultra high sensitivity and are widely employed in\nnumerous applications. In the recent years, it has been proved that the\nmagnetic response of nano-objects can be effectively measured by using a SQUID\nwith a very small sensitive area (nanoSQUID). In fact, the sensor noise,\nexpressed in terms of the elementary magnetic moment (spin or Bohr magneton),\nis linearly dependent on the SQUID loop side length. For this reason, SQUIDs\nhave been progressively miniaturized in order to improve the sensitivity up to\nfew spin per unit of bandwidth. With respect to other techniques, nanoSQUIDs\noffer the advantage of direct measurement of magnetization changes in small\nspin systems. In this review, we focus on nanoSQUIDs and its applications. In\nparticular, we will discuss the motivations, the theoretical aspects, the\nfabrication techniques, the different nanoSQUIDs and the relative nanoscale\napplications.\n", "  In the framework of density functional theory a formalism to describe\nelectronic transport in the steady state is proposed which uses the density on\nthe junction and the {\\em steady current} as basic variables. We prove that, in\na finite window around zero bias, there is a one-to-one map between the basic\nvariables and both local potential on as well as bias across the junction. The\nresulting Kohn-Sham system features two exchange-correlation (xc) potentials, a\nlocal xc potential and an xc contribution to the bias. For weakly coupled\njunctions the xc potentials exhibit steps in the density-current plane which\nare shown to be crucial to describe the Coulomb blockade diamonds. At small\ncurrents these steps emerge as the equilibrium xc discontinuity bifurcates. The\nformalism is applied to a model benzene junction, finding perfect agreement\nwith the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade.\n", "  We discuss how to exploit stochastic resonance with the methods of\nstatistical theory of decisions. To do so, we evaluate two detection\nstrategies: escape time analysis and strobing. For a standard quartic bistable\nsystem with a periodic drive and disturbed by noise, we show that the detection\nstrategies and the physics of the double well are connected, inasmuch as one\n(the strobing strategy) is based on synchronization, while the other (escape\ntime analysis) is determined by the possibility to accumulate energy in the\noscillations. The analysis of the escape times best performs at the frequency\nof the geometric resonance, while strobing shows a peak of the performances at\na special noise level predicted by the stochastic resonance theory. We surmise\nthat the detection properties of the quartic potential are generic for\noverdamped and underdamped systems, in that the physical nature of resonance\ndecides the competition (in terms of performances) between different detection\nstrategies.\n", "  We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach for cosmic shear power\nspectrum inference, jointly sampling from the posterior distribution of the\ncosmic shear field and its (tomographic) power spectra. Inference of the shear\npower spectrum is a powerful intermediate product for a cosmic shear analysis,\nsince it requires very few model assumptions and can be used to perform\ninference on a wide range of cosmological models \\emph{a posteriori} without\nloss of information. We show that joint posterior for the shear map and power\nspectrum can be sampled effectively by Gibbs sampling, iteratively drawing\nsamples from the map and power spectrum, each conditional on the other. This\napproach neatly circumvents difficulties associated with complicated survey\ngeometry and masks that plague frequentist power spectrum estimators, since the\npower spectrum inference provides prior information about the field in masked\nregions at every sampling step. We demonstrate this approach for inference of\ntomographic shear $E$-mode, $B$-mode and $EB$-cross power spectra from a\nsimulated galaxy shear catalogue with a number of important features; galaxies\ndistributed on the sky and in redshift with photometric redshift uncertainties,\nrealistic random ellipticity noise for every galaxy and a complicated survey\nmask. The obtained posterior distributions for the tomographic power spectrum\ncoefficients recover the underlying simulated power spectra for both $E$- and\n$B$-modes.\n", "  We provide a straightforward generalization of a positive map in\n$M_3(\\mathbb{C})$ considered recently by Miller and Olkiewicz \\cite{Miller}. It\nis proved that these maps are optimal and indecomposable. As a byproduct we\nprovide a class of PPT entangled states in $d \\otimes d$.\n", "  The title paper by Boopathi and Ramasamy reports a study on the crystal\ngrowth and characterization of dibromobis (L-proline)Cd(II) (1). Many points of\ncriticism, concerning the crystal structure of (1) and the magnetic properties\nof (1) dibromo bis(L-proline)Zn(II) (2) and diiodo bis(2-aminopyridine)Cd(II)\n(3) are reported to show that compounds 1 to 3 are not soft magnets but instead\ndiamagnetic solids.\n", "  We study inflation with anisotropic hair induced by form fields. In four\ndimensions, the relevant form fields are gauge (one-form) fields and two-form\nfields. Assuming the exponential form of potential and gauge kinetic functions,\nwe find new exact power-law solutions endowed with anisotropic hair. We also\nexplore the phase space of anisotropic inflation and find fixed points\ncorresponding to the exact power-law solutions. Moreover, we perform the\nstability analysis around the fixed points to reveal the structure of the phase\nspace. It turns out that one of the fixed points becomes an attractor and\nothers (if any) are saddle points. In particular, the one corresponding to\nanisotropic inflation becomes an attractor when it exists. We also argue that\nvarious anisotropic inflation models can be designed by choosing coupling\nconstants.\n", "  We suggest a direct algorithm for searching the Lax pairs for nonlinear\nintegrable equations. It is effective for both continuous and discrete models.\nThe first operator of the Lax pair corresponding to a given nonlinear equation\nis found immediately, coinciding with the linearization of the considered\nnonlinear equation. The second one is obtained as an invariant manifold to the\nlinearized equation. A surprisingly simple relation between the second operator\nof the Lax pair and the recursion operator is discussed: the recursion operator\ncan immediately be found from the Lax pair. Examples considered in the article\nare convincing evidence that the found Lax pairs differ from the classical\nones. The examples also show that the suggested objects are true Lax pairs\nwhich allow the construction of infinite series of conservation laws and\nhierarchies of higher symmetries. In the case of the hyperbolic type partial\ndifferential equation our algorithm is slightly modified; in order to construct\nthe Lax pairs from the invariant manifolds we use the cutting off conditions\nfor the corresponding infinite Laplace sequence. The efficiency of the method\nis illustrated by application to some equations given in the Svinolupov-Sokolov\nclassification list for which the Lax pairs and the recursion operators have\nnot been found earlier.\n", "  The energy spectrum of two 0-branes for fixed angular momentum in 2+1\ndimensions is calculated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The basis function used\nfor each angular momentum consists of 80 eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator\nproblem on the corresponding space. It is seen that the spectrum exhibits a\ndefinite linear Regge trajectory behavior. It is argued how this behavior\nsupports the picture by which the bound-states of quarks and QCD-strings are\ngoverned by the quantum mechanics of matrix coordinates.\n", "  We present Lattice QCD results on the neutron tensor charges including, for\nthe first time, a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, volume,\nand light quark masses to the physical point in the continuum limit. We find\nthat the \"disconnected\" contribution is smaller than the statistical error in\nthe \"connected\" contribution. Our estimates in the $\\bar{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at\n$2$ GeV, including all systematics, are $g_T^{d-u}=1.020(76)$, $g_T^d =\n0.774(66)$, $g_T^u = - 0.233(28)$, and $g_T^s = 0.008(9)$. The flavor diagonal\ncharges determine the size of the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) induced\nby quark EDMs that are generated in many new scenarios of CP-violation beyond\nthe Standard Model (BSM). We use our results to derive model-independent bounds\non the EDMs of light quarks and update the EDM phenomenology in split\nSupersymmetry with gaugino mass unification, finding a stringent upper bound of\n$d_n < 4 \\times 10^{-28} \\, e$ cm for the neutron EDM in this scenario.\n", "  It is a recent realization that many of the concepts and tools of causal\ndiscovery in machine learning are highly relevant to problems in quantum\ninformation, in particular quantum nonlocality. The crucial ingredient in the\nconnection between both fields is the tool of Bayesian networks, a graphical\nmodel used to reason about probabilistic causation. Indeed, Bell's theorem\nconcerns a particular kind of a Bayesian network and Bell inequalities are a\nspecial case of linear constraints following from such models. It is thus\nnatural to look for generalized Bell scenarios involving more complex Bayesian\nnetworks. The problem, however, relies on the fact that such generalized\nscenarios are characterized by polynomial Bell inequalities and no current\nmethod is available to derive them beyond very simple cases. In this work, we\nmake a significant step in that direction, providing a general and practical\nmethod for the derivation of polynomial Bell inequalities in a wide class of\nscenarios, applying it to a few cases of interest. We also show how our\nconstruction naturally gives rise to a notion of non-signalling in generalized\nnetworks.\n", "  We show that a self-consistent classical theory of the spin, based on a very\ngeneral Lagrangian extending the Newtonian dynamics, does predict the special\ncase of helicity-0 particles, which at the same time are endowed with nonzero\nspin and zero intrinsic angular momentum.\n", "  The spherical functions of the noncompact Grassmann manifolds\n$G_{p,q}(\\mathbb F)=G/K$ over the (skew-)fields $\\mathbb F=\\mathbb R, \\mathbb\nC, \\mathbb H$ with rank $q\\ge1$ and dimension parameter $p>q$ can be described\nas Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric functions of type BC, where the double coset\nspace $G//K$ is identified with the Weyl chamber $ C_q^B\\subset \\mathbb R^q$ of\ntype B. The corresponding product formulas and Harish-Chandra integral\nrepresentations were recently written down by M. R\\\"osler and the author in an\nexplicit way such that both formulas can be extended analytically to all real\nparameters $p\\in[2q-1,\\infty[$, and that associated commutative convolution\nstructures $*_p$ on $C_q^B$ exist. In this paper we introduce moment functions\nand the dispersion of probability measures on $C_q^B$ depending on $*_p$ and\nstudy these functions with the aid of this generalized integral representation.\nMoreover, we derive strong laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for\nassociated time-homogeneous random walks on $(C_q^B, *_p)$ where the moment\nfunctions and the dispersion appear in order to determine drift vectors and\ncovariance matrices of these limit laws explicitely. For integers $p$, all\nresults have interpretations for $G$-invariant random walks on the\nGrassmannians $G/K$.\n  Besides the BC-cases we also study the spaces $GL(q,\\mathbb F)/U(q,\\mathbb\nF)$, which are related to Weyl chambers of type A, and for which corresponding\nresults hold. For the rank-one-case $q=1$, the results of this paper are\nwell-known in the context of Jacobi-type hypergroups on $[0,\\infty[$.\n", "  We implement the effective field theory for gravitating spinning objects in\nthe post-Newtonian scheme at the next-to-next-to-leading order level to derive\nthe gravitational spin-orbit interaction potential at the third and a half\npost-Newtonian order for rapidly rotating compact objects. From the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order interaction potential, which we obtain here in a\nLagrangian form for the first time, we derive straightforwardly the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian. The spin-orbit sector constitutes the most elaborate\nspin dependent sector at each order, and accordingly we encounter a\nproliferation of the relevant Feynman diagrams, and a significant increase of\nthe computational complexity. We present the evaluation of the interaction\npotential, going over contributing Feynman diagrams. The computation is carried\nout in terms of the nonrelativistic gravitational fields, together with the\nvarious gauge choices included in the effective field theory for gravitating\nspinning objects, which optimize the calculation. In addition, we automatize\nthe effective field theory computations, and carry out the automated\ncomputations in parallel. Such automated effective field theory computations\nwould be most useful to obtain higher order post-Newtonian corrections. We\ncompare our Hamiltonian to the ADM Hamiltonian, and arrive at a complete\nagreement between the ADM and effective field theory results. We provide\ncomplete gauge invariant relations among the binding energy, angular momentum,\nand orbital frequency of an inspiralling binary with generic compact spinning\ncomponents to third and a half post-Newtonian order. The derivation presented\nhere is essential to obtain further higher order post-Newtonian corrections,\nand to reach the accuracy level required for the successful detection of\ngravitational radiation.\n", "  The next-to-next-to-leading order spin-squared interaction potential for\ngeneric compact binaries is derived for the first time via the effective field\ntheory for gravitating spinning objects in the post-Newtonian scheme. The\nspin-squared sector is an intricate one, as it requires the consideration of\nthe point particle action beyond minimal coupling, and mainly involves the\nspin-squared worldline couplings, which are quite complex, compared to the\nworldline couplings from the minimal coupling part of the action. This sector\nalso involves the linear in spin couplings, as we go up in the nonlinearity of\nthe interaction, and in the loop order. Hence, there is an excessive increase\nin the number of Feynman diagrams, of which more are higher loop ones. We\nprovide all the Feynman diagrams and their values. The beneficial\nnonrelativistic gravitational fields are employed in the computation. This\nspin-squared correction, which enters at the fourth post-Newtonian order for\nrapidly rotating compact objects, completes the conservative sector up to the\nfourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The robustness of the effective field theory\nfor gravitating spinning objects is shown here once again, as demonstrated in a\nrecent series of papers by the authors, which obtained all spin dependent\nsectors, required up to the fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The effective field\ntheory of spinning objects allows to directly obtain the equations of motion,\nand the Hamiltonians, and these will be derived for the potential obtained here\nin a forthcoming paper.\n", "  We study confinement-deconfinement phase transition for heavy quarks in a\nbottom-up holographic QCD model. We consider a black hole background in an\nEinstein-Maxwell-scalar system and add probe open strings to the background.\nCombining the various configurations of the open strings and the phase\nstructure of the black hole background itself, we obtain the\nconfinement-deconfinement phase diagram for heavy quarks in the holographic QCD\nmodel.\n", "  We present results for the iso-vector and flavor diagonal tensor charges\n$g^{u-d}_T$, $g^{u}_T$, $g^{d}_T$, and $g^{s}_T$ needed to probe novel tensor\ninteractions at the TeV scale in neutron and nuclear $\\beta$-decays and the\ncontribution of the quark electric dipole moment (EDM) to the neutron EDM. The\nlattice QCD calculations were done using nine ensembles of gauge configurations\ngenerated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical\nflavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and\n$0.12 $ fm and three quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_\\pi\n\\approx 130, 220$ and $310 $ MeV. Using estimates from these ensembles, we\nquantify all systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous extrapolation\nin the lattice spacing, volume and light quark masses for the connected\ncontributions. The final estimates of the connected nucleon (proton) tensor\ncharge for the iso-vector combination is $g_T^{u-d} = 1.020(76) $ in the\n$\\bar{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The additional disconnected quark loop\ncontributions needed for the flavor-diagonal matrix elements are calculated\nusing a stochastic estimator employing the truncated solver method with the\nall-mode-averaging technique. We find that the size of the disconnected\ncontribution is smaller than the statistical error in the connected\ncontribution. This allows us to bound the disconnected contribution and include\nit as an additional uncertainty in the flavor-diagonal charges. After a\ncontinuum extrapolation, we find $g_T^{u} = 0.774(66) $, $g_T^{d} = -0.233(28)\n$ and $g_T^{u+d} = 0.541(67) $. The strangeness tensor charge, that can make a\nsignificant contribution to the neutron EDM due to the large ratio\n$m_s/m_{u,d}$, is $g_T^{s}=0.008(9)$ in the continuum limit.\n", "  We present the experimental realization of a quantum fiber-pigtail. The\ndevice consists of a semiconductor quantum-dot embedded into a conical photonic\nwire that is directly connected to the core of a fiber-pigtail. We demonstrate\na photon collection efficiency at the output of the fiber of 5.8% and suggest\nrealistic improvements for the implementation of a useful device in the context\nof quantum information. We finally discuss potential applications in scanning\nprobe microscopy.\n", "  A single phonon in a nonlinear nanomechanical resonator (NAMR) can block the\nexcitation of a second phonon [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032101 (2010)]. This\nintrinsically quantum effect is called phonon blockade, and is an analog of\nCoulomb blockade and photon blockade. Here we predict tunable multiphonon\nblockade in coupled nonlinear NAMRs, where nonlinearity is induced by two-level\nsystems (TLSs) assuming dispersive (far off-resonance) interactions.\nSpecifically, we derive an effective Kerr-type interaction in a hybrid system\nconsisting of two nonlinearly-interacting NAMRs coupled to two TLSs and driven\nby classical fields. The interaction between a given NAMR and a TLS is\ndescribed by a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. We show that by properly tuning the\nfrequency of the driving fields one can induce various types of phonon\nblockade, corresponding to the entangled phonon states of either two qubits,\nqutrit and quartit, or two qudits. Thus, a $k$-phonon Fock state (with\n$k=1,2,3$) can impede the excitation of more phonons in a given NAMR, which we\ninterpret as a $k$-phonon blockade (or, equivalently, phonon tunneling). Our\nresults can be explained in terms of resonant transitions in the Fock space and\nvia phase-space interference using the $s$-parametrized Cahill-Glauber\nquasiprobability distributions including the Wigner function. We study the\nnonclassicality, entanglement, and dimensionality of the blockaded phonon\nstates during both dynamics and in the stationary limits.\n", "  Gunasekaran et al (Pramana J. Phys. 75 683-690 (2010)) report to have grown\nthe nonlinear optical crystals urea thiourea mercuric chloride (UTHC) and urea\nthiourea mercuric sulphate (UTHS). We argue that UTHC and UTHS are dubious\ncrystals and are not what the authors propose.\n", "  We discuss the strong couplings $g_{PPV}$ and $g_{VVP}$ for vector ($V$) and\npseudoscalar ($P$) mesons, at least one of which is a charmonium state $J/\\psi$\nor $\\eta_c$. The strong couplings are obtained as residues at the poles of\nsuitable form factors, calculated in a broad range of momentum transfers using\na dispersion formulation of the relativistic constituent quark model. The form\nfactors obtained in this approach satisfy all constraints known for these\nquantities in the heavy-quark limit. Our results suggest sizably higher values\nfor the strong meson couplings than those reported in the literature from QCD\nsum rules.\n", "  We present a novel interpretation of IceCube high energy neutrino events\n(with energy larger than 60 TeV) in terms of an extraterrestrial flux due to\ntwo different contributions: a flux originated by known astrophysical sources\nand dominating IceCube observations up to few hundreds TeV, and a new flux\ncomponent where the most energetic neutrinos come from the leptophilic\nthree-body decays of dark matter particles with a mass of few PeV. Differently\nfrom other approaches, we provide two examples of elementary particle models\nthat do not require extremely tiny coupling constants. We find the\ncompatibility of the theoretical predictions with the IceCube results when the\nastrophysical flux has a cutoff of the order of 100 TeV (broken power law). In\nthis case the most energetic part of the spectrum (PeV neutrinos) is due to an\nextra component such as the decay of a very massive dark matter component. Due\nto the low statistics at our disposal we have considered for simplicity the\nequivalence between deposited and neutrino energy, however such approximation\ndoes not affect dramatically the qualitative results. Of course, a purely\nastrophysical origin of the neutrino flux (no cutoff in energy below the PeV\nscale - unbroken power law) is still allowed. If future data will confirm the\npresence of a sharp cutoff above few PeV this would be in favor of a dark\nmatter interpretation.\n", "  We report the results of the narrow band photometry and imaging monitoring of\ncomet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) with the robotic telescope TRAPPIST (La Silla\nobservatory). We gathered around 400 images over 8 months pre- and\npost-perihelion between September 12, 2013 and July 6, 2014. We followed the\nevolution of the OH, NH, CN, C3 , and C2 production rates computed with the\nHaser model as well as the evolution of the dust production. All five gas\nspecies display an asymmetry about perihelion, the rate of brightening being\nsteeper than the rate of fading. The study of the coma morphology reveals gas\nand dust jets which indicate one or several active zone(s) on the nucleus. The\ndust, C2 , and C3 morphologies present some similarities while the CN\nmorphology is different. OH and NH are enhanced in the tail direction. The\nstudy of the evolution of the comet activity shows that the OH, NH, and C2\nproduction rates evolution with the heliocentric distance is correlated to the\ndust evolution. The CN and, to a lesser extent, the C3 do not display such a\ncorrelation with the dust. These evidences and the comparison with parent\nspecies production rates indicate that C2 and C3 on one side and OH and NH on\nthe other side could be -at least partially- released from organic-rich grains\nand icy grains. On the contrary, all evidences point to HCN being the main\nparent of CN in this comet.\n", "  We derive fast forward interplanetary (IP) shock speeds and impact angles to\nstudy the geoeffectivness of 461 IP shocks that occurred from January 1995 to\nDecember 2013 using ACE and WIND spacecraft data. The geomagnetic activity is\ninferred from the SuperMAG project data. SuperMAG is a large chain which\nemploys more than 300 ground stations to compute enhanced versions of the\ntraditional geomagnetic indices. The SuperMAG auroral electroject SME index, an\nenhanced version of the traditional AE index, is used as an auroral power (AP)\nindicator. AP intensity jumps triggered by shock impacts are correlated with\nboth shock speed and impact angle. It is found that high AP intensity events\ntypically occur when high speed IP shocks impact the Earths magnetosphere with\nthe shock normal almost parallel to the Sun-Earth line. This result suggests\nthat symmetric and strong magnetospheric compression leads to favorable\nconditions for intense auroral power release, as shown previously by\nsimulations and observations. Some potential mechanisms will be discussed.\n", "  Two-dimensional Ising models on the honeycomb lattice and the square lattice\nwith striped random impurities are studied to obtain their phase diagrams.\nAssuming bimodal distributions of the random impurities where all the non-zero\ncouplings have the same magnitude, exact critical values for the fraction p of\nferromagnetic bonds at the zero-temperature (T=0) are obtained. The critical\nlines in the p-T plane are drawn by numerically evaluating the Lyapunov\nexponent of random matrix products.\n", "  We propose a new explanation for excess events observed in the search for a\nhigh-mass resonance decaying into dibosons by the ATLAS experiment. The\nresonance is identified as a composite spin-$0$ particle that couples to the\nStandard Model gauge bosons via dimension-5 operators. The excess events can be\nexplained if the dimension-5 operators are suppressed by a mass scale of ${\\cal\nO}(1$-$10$) TeV. We also construct a model of hidden strong gauge dynamics\nwhich realizes the spin-$0$ particle as its lightest composite state, with\nappropriate couplings to Standard Model gauge bosons.\n", "  Long-lived population storage in optically pumped levels of rare-earth ions\ndoped into solids, referred to as persistent spectral hole burning, is of\nsignificant fundamental and technological interest. However, the demonstration\nof deep and persistent holes in rare-earth ion doped amorphous hosts, e.g.\nglasses, has remained an open challenge since many decades -- a fact that\nmotivates our work towards a better understanding of the interaction between\nimpurities and vibrational modes in glasses. Here we report the first\nobservation and detailed characterization of such holes in an erbium-doped\nsilica glass fiber cooled to below 1 K. We demonstrate population storage in\nelectronic Zeeman-sublevels of the erbium ground state with lifetimes up to 30\nseconds and 80\\% spin polarization. In addition to its fundamental aspect, our\ninvestigation reveals a potential technological application of rare-earth ion\ndoped amorphous materials, including at telecommunication wavelength.\n", "  The properties of a balanced two-component Fermi gas in a one-dimensional\nharmonic trap are studied by means of the coupled cluster method. For few\nfermions we recover the results of exact diagonalization, yet with this method\nwe are able to study much larger systems. We compute the energy, the chemical\npotential, the pairing gap, and the density profile of the trapped clouds,\nsmoothly mapping the crossover between the few-body and many-body limits. The\nenergy is found to converge surprisingly rapidly to the many-body result for\nevery value of the interaction strength. Many more particles are instead needed\nto give rise to the non-analytic behavior of the pairing gap, and to smoothen\nthe pronounced even-odd oscillations of the chemical potential induced by the\nshell structure of the trap.\n", "  In a recent series of papers [1--3], a statistical model that accounts for\ncorrelations between topological and geometrical properties of a\ntwo-dimensional shuffled foam has been proposed and compared with experimental\nand numerical data. Here, the various assumptions on which the model is based\nare exposed and justified: the equiprobability hypothesis of the foam\nconfigurations is argued. The range of correlations between bubbles is\ndiscussed, and the mean field approximation that is used in the model is\ndetailed. The two self-consistency equations associated with this mean field\ndescription can be interpreted as the conservation laws of number of sides and\nbubble curvature, respectively. Finally, the use of a '' Grand-Canonical ''\ndescription, in which the foam constitutes a reservoir of sides and curvature,\nis justified.\n", "  Hydrogen in metals has attracted much attention for a long time from both\nbasic scientific and technological points of view. Its electronic state has\nbeen investigated in terms of a proton embedded in the electron gas mostly by\nthe local density approximation (LDA) to the density functional theory. At high\nelectronic densities, it is well described by a bare proton H^+ screened by\nmetallic electrons (charge resonance), while at low densities two electrons are\nlocalized at the proton site to form a closed-shell negative ion H^- protected\nfrom surrounding metallic electrons by the Pauli exclusion principle. However,\nno details are known about the transition from H^+ to H^- in the\nintermediate-density region. Here, by accurately determining the ground-state\nelectron distribution n(r) by the combination of LDA and diffusion Monte Carlo\nsimulations with the total electron number up to 170, we obtain a complete\npicture of the transition, in particular, a sharp transition from short-range\nH^+ screening charge resonance to long-range Kondo-like spin-singlet resonance,\nthe emergence of which is confirmed by the presence of an anomalous Friedel\noscillation characteristic to the Kondo singlet state with the Kondo\ntemperature T_K well beyond 1,000K. This study not only reveals interesting\ncompetition between charge and spin resonances, enriching the century-old\nparadigm of metallic screening to a point charge, but also discovers a\nlong-sought novel high-T_K system, opening an unexpected route to\nroom-temperature superconductivity in a Kondo lattice made of protons.\n", "  A large negative magnetoresistance is anticipated in topological semimetals\nin the parallel magnetic and electric field configuration as a consequence of\nthe nontrivial topological properties. The negative magnetoresistance is\nbelieved to demonstrate the chiral anomaly, a long-sought high-energy physics\neffect, in solid-state systems. Recent experiments reveal that Cd3As2, a Dirac\ntopological semimetal, has the record-high mobility and exhibits positive\nlinear magnetoresistance in the orthogonal magnetic and electric field\nconfiguration. However, the negative magnetoresistance in the parallel magnetic\nand electric field configuration remains unveiled. Here, we report the\nobservation of the negative magnetoresistance in Cd3As2 microribbons in the\nparallel magnetic and electric field configuration as large as 66% at 50 K and\neven visible at room temperatures. The observed negative magnetoresistance is\nsensitive to the angle between magnetic and electrical field, robust against\ntemperature, and dependent on the carrier density. We have found that carrier\ndensities of our Cd3As2 samples obey an Arrhenius's law, decreasing from\n3.0x10^17 cm^-3 at 300 K to 2.2x10^16 cm^-3 below 50 K. The low carrier\ndensities result in the large values of the negative magnetoresistance. We\ntherefore attribute the observed negative magnetoresistance to the chiral\nanomaly. Furthermore, in the perpendicular magnetic and electric field\nconfiguration a positive non-saturating linear magnetoresistance up to 1670% at\n14 T and 2 K is also observed. This work demonstrates potential applications of\ntopological semimetals in magnetic devices.\n", "  The decays $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^+$ and $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}$ are\nstudied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a dataset corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities of 4.9 fb$^{-1}$ and 20.6 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions\ncollected at centre-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 8 TeV,\nrespectively. Signal candidates are identified through $J/\\psi\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nand $D_s^{(*)+}\\to\\phi\\pi^+(\\gamma/\\pi^0)$ decays. With a two-dimensional\nlikelihood fit involving the $B_c^+$ reconstructed invariant mass and an angle\nbetween the $\\mu^+$ and $D_s^+$ candidate momenta in the muon pair rest frame,\nthe yields of $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^+$ and $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}$, and the\ntransverse polarisation fraction in $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}$ decay are\nmeasured. The transverse polarisation fraction is determined to be\n$\\Gamma_{\\pm\\pm}(B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+})/\\Gamma(B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}) =\n0.38 \\pm 0.23 \\pm 0.07$, and the derived ratio of the branching fractions of\nthe two modes is $\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}}/\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+\n\\to J/\\psi D_s^+} = 2.8 \\,^{+1.2}_{-0.8} \\pm 0.3$, where the first error is\nstatistical and the second is systematic. Finally, a sample of $B_c^+\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+$ decays is used to derive the ratios of branching fractions\n$\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D_s^+}/\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+} =\n3.8 \\pm 1.1 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.2$ and $\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi\nD_s^{*+}}/\\mathcal{B}_{B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+} = 10.4 \\pm 3.1 \\pm 1.5 \\pm 0.6$,\nwhere the third error corresponds to the uncertainty of the branching fraction\nof $D_s^+\\to\\phi(K^+K^-)\\pi^+$ decay. The available theoretical predictions are\ngenerally consistent with the measurement.\n", "  We study a quantum information metric (or fidelity susceptibility) in\nconformal field theories with respect to a small perturbation by a primary\noperator. We argue that its gravity dual is approximately given by a volume of\nmaximal time slice in an AdS spacetime when the perturbation is exactly\nmarginal. We confirm our claim in several examples.\n", "  Stars born from the same molecular cloud should be nearly homogeneous in\ntheir element abundances. The concept of chemical tagging is to identify\nmembers of disrupted clusters by their clustering in element abundance space.\nChemical tagging requires large samples of stars with precise abundances for\nmany individual elements. With uncertainties of $\\sigma_{[X/{\\rm Fe}]}$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} \\simeq 0.05$ for 10 elements measured for $>10^4$ stars,\nthe APOGEE DR12 spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea\ninto practice. We find that even APOGEE data offer only $\\sim 500$ independent\nvolume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space, when we focus on the\n$\\alpha$-enhanced Galactic disk. We develop and apply a new algorithm to search\nfor chemically homogeneous sets of stars against a dominant background. By\ninjecting star clusters into the APOGEE data set we show that chemically\nhomogeneous clusters with masses $\\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^7 \\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ would\nbe easily detectable and yet no such signal is seen in the data. By\ngeneralizing this approach, we put a first abundance-based constraint on the\ncluster mass function for the old disk stars in the Milky Way.\n", "  The art and science of folding intricate three-dimensional structures out of\npaper has occupied artists, designers, engineers, and mathematicians for\ndecades, culminating in the design of deployable structures and mechanical\nmetamaterials. Here we investigate the axial compressibility of origami\ncylinders, i.e., cylindrical structures folded from rectangular sheets of\npaper. We prove, using geometric arguments, that a general fold pattern only\nallows for a finite number of \\emph{isometric} cylindrical embeddings.\nTherefore, compressibility of such structures requires either stretching the\nmaterial or deforming the folds. Our result considerably restricts the space of\nconstructions that must be searched when designing new types of origami-based\nrigid-foldable deployable structures and metamaterials.\n", "  We use the coupled cluster method implemented at high orders of approximation\nto study the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$ model on the triangular\nlattice with Heisenberg interactions between nearest-neighbour and\nnext-nearest-neighbour pairs of spins, with coupling strengths $J_{1}>0$ and\n$J_{2} \\equiv \\kappa J_{1} >0$, respectively. In the window $0 \\leq \\kappa \\leq\n1$ we find that the 3-sublattice 120$^{\\circ}$ N\\'{e}el-ordered and\n2-sublattice 180$^{\\circ}$ stripe-ordered antiferromagnetic states form the\nstable ground-state phases in the regions $\\kappa < \\kappa^{c}_{1} = 0.060(10)$\nand $\\kappa > \\kappa^{c}_{2} = 0.165(5)$, respectively. The spin-triplet gap is\nfound to vanish over essentially the entire region $\\kappa^{c}_{1} < \\kappa <\n\\kappa^{c}_{2}$ of the intermediate phase.\n", "  Concepts for memories based on the manipulation of giant magnetostrictive\nnanomagnets by stress pulses have garnered recent attention due to their\npotential for ultra-low energy operation in the high storage density limit.\nHere we discuss the feasibility of making such memories in light of the fact\nthat the Gilbert damping of such materials is typically quite high. We report\nthe results of numerical simulations for several classes of toggle precessional\nand non-toggle dissipative magnetoelastic switching modes. Material candidates\nfor each of the several classes are analyzed and forms for the anisotropy\nenergy density and ranges of material parameters appropriate for each material\nclass are employed. Our study indicates that the Gilbert damping as well as the\nanisotropy and demagnetization energies are all crucial for determining the\nfeasibility of magnetoelastic toggle-mode precessional switching schemes. The\nroles of thermal stability and thermal fluctuations for stress-pulse switching\nof giant magnetostrictive nanomagnets are also discussed in detail and are\nshown to be important in the viability, design, and footprint of\nmagnetostrictive switching schemes.\n", "  A general group element for the fundamental representation of SU(3) is\nexpressed as a second order polynomial in the hermitian generating matrix H,\nwith coefficients consisting of elementary trigonometric functions dependent on\nthe sole invariant det(H), in addition to the group parameter.\n", "  The average minimum number of bits needed for lossless readout of a pixel\ndetector is calculated, in the regime of interest for particle physics where\nonly a small fraction of pixels have a non-zero value per frame. This permits a\nsystematic comparison of the readout efficiency of different encoding imple-\nmentations. The calculation is compared to the number of bits used by the FE-I4\npixel readout chip of the ATLAS experiment.\n", "  Narrow bandwidth and easy detuning, inefficiency in broadband and\nnon-stationary excitations, and difficulties in matching linear harvester's\nresonance frequency to low-frequency excitations at small scales, have\nconvinced the researchers to investigate the nonlinear, in particular the\nbistable energy harvesters in the recent years. However, the bistable\nharvesters suffer from co-existing low and high energy orbits, and sensitivity\nto initial conditions, and have been recently proven inefficient when subjected\nto many real-world random and non-stationary excitations. Here, we propose a\nnovel buy-low-sell-high strategy that can significantly improve the harvester's\nefficiency at low-frequencies in a much more robust fashion. This strategy\ncould be realized by a passive adaptive bistable system. Simulation results\nconfirm high efficiency of the adaptive bistable system following a\nbuy-low-sell-high logic when subjected to harmonic and random non-stationary\nwalking excitations compared to its conventional bistable and linear\ncounterparts.\n", "  We analyze enhancements in the magnitude of the self-energy for electrons far\naway from the Fermi surface in doped Mott insulators using the dynamical\ncluster approximation to the Hubbard model. For large onsite repulsion, U, and\nhole doping, the magnitude of the self-energy for imaginary frequencies at the\ntop of the band (k=(pi,pi) is enhanced with respect to the self-energy\nmagnitude at the bottom of the band (k=(0,0)). The self-energy behavior at\nthese two k-points is switched for electron doping. Although the hybridization\nis much larger for (0,0) than for (pi,pi), we demonstrate that this is not the\norigin of this difference. Isolated clusters under a downward shift of the\nchemical potential, mu<U/2, at half-filling reproduce the overall self-energy\nbehavior at (0,0) and (pi,pi) found in low hole doped embedded clusters. This\nhappens although there is no change in the electronic structure of the isolated\nclusters. Our analysis shows that a downward shift of the chemical potential\nwhich weakly hole dopes the Mott insulator can lead to a large enhancement of\nthe (pi,pi) self-energy which is not necessarily associated with electronic\ncorrelation effects, even in embedded clusters.\n", "  Feynman loop integrals are a key ingredient for the calculation of higher\norder radiation effects, and are responsible for reliable and accurate\ntheoretical prediction. We improve the efficiency of numerical integration in\nsector decomposition by implementing a quasi-Monte Carlo method associated with\nthe CUDA/GPU technique. For demonstration we present the results of several\nFeynman integrals up to two loops in both Euclidean and physical kinematic\nregions in comparison with those obtained from FIESTA3. It is shown that both\nplanar and non-planar two-loop master integrals in the physical kinematic\nregion can be evaluated in less than half a minute with $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$\naccuracy, which makes the direct numerical approach viable for precise\ninvestigation of higher order effects in multi-loop processes, e.g. the\nnext-to-leading order QCD effect in Higgs pair production via gluon fusion with\na finite top quark mass.\n", "  Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal desorption spectroscopy, and\nscanning tunneling microscopy we show that upon keV Xe + irradiation of\ngraphene on Ir(111), Xe atoms are trapped under the graphene. Upon annealing,\naggregation of Xe leads to graphene bulges and blisters. The efficient trapping\nis an unexpected and remarkable phenomenon, given the absence of chemical\nbinding of Xe to Ir and to graphene, the weak interaction of a perfect graphene\nlayer with Ir(111), as well as the substantial damage to graphene due to\nirradiation. By combining molecular dynamics simulations and density functional\ntheory calculations with our experiments, we uncover the mechanism of trapping.\nWe describe ways to avoid blister formation during graphene growth, and also\ndemonstrate how ion implantation can be used to intentionally create blisters\nwithout introducing damage to the graphene layer. Our approach may provide a\npathway to synthesize new materials at a substrate - 2D material interface or\nto enable confined reactions at high pressures and temperatures.\n", "  We develop a novel sampling theorem for functions defined on the\nthree-dimensional rotation group SO(3) by connecting the rotation group to the\nthree-torus through a periodic extension. Our sampling theorem requires $4L^3$\nsamples to capture all of the information content of a signal band-limited at\n$L$, reducing the number of required samples by a factor of two compared to\nother equiangular sampling theorems. We present fast algorithms to compute the\nassociated Fourier transform on the rotation group, the so-called Wigner\ntransform, which scale as $O(L^4)$, compared to the naive scaling of $O(L^6)$.\nFor the common case of a low directional band-limit $N$, complexity is reduced\nto $O(N L^3)$. Our fast algorithms will be of direct use in speeding up the\ncomputation of directional wavelet transforms on the sphere. We make our SO3\ncode implementing these algorithms publicly available.\n", "  Network reconstruction is the first step towards understanding, diagnosing\nand controlling the dynamics of complex networked systems. It allows us to\ninfer properties of the interaction matrix, which characterizes how nodes in a\nsystem directly interact with each other. Despite a decade of extensive\nstudies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The\nfundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix\n(e.g., adjacency pattern, sign pattern and degree sequence) can be inferred\nfrom given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here we rigorously\nderive necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction\nmatrix. These conditions characterize how uncertain can we be about the\ncoupling functions that characterize the interactions between nodes, and how\ninformative does the measured temporal data need to be; rendering two classes\nof fundamental limitations of network reconstruction. Counterintuitively, we\nfind that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically\nas difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally\ninformative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations shed light\non the design of better network reconstruction algorithms, which offer\npractical improvements over existing methods.\n", "  In this paper, we study the geometry of reduced density matrices for states\nwith symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. We observe ruled surface\nstructures on the boundary of the convex set of low dimension projections of\nthe reduced density matrices. In order to signal the SPT order using ruled\nsurfaces, it is important that we add a symmetry-breaking term to the boundary\nof the system---no ruled surface emerges in systems without boundary or when we\nadd a symmetry-breaking term representing a thermodynamic quantity. Although\nthe ruled surfaces only appear in the thermodynamic limit where the\nground-state degeneracy is exact, we analyze the precision of our numerical\nalgorithm and show that a finite system calculation suffices to reveal the\nruled surface structures.\n", "  We investigate a particular version of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) NMSSM\ncharacterized by an economical and rigidly hierarchical flavor structure and\nbased on flavored gauge mediation and on some considerations inspired by string\ntheory GUTs. In this way we can express the Lagrangian of the PQ NMSSM through\nvery few parameters. The obtained model is studied numerically and confronted\nwith the most relevant phenomenological constraints. We show that typical\nspectra are for the most part too heavy to be significantly probed at the LHC,\nbut regions of the parameter space exist yielding signatures that might\npossibly be observed during Run II. We also calculate the fine tuning of the\nmodel. We show that, in spite of the appearance of large scales in the\nsuperpotential and soft terms, it does not exceed the tuning present in the\nMSSM for equivalent spectra, which is of the order of 10^4.\n", "  We study the metastable dynamics of a discretised version of the\nmass-conserving stochastic Allen-Cahn equation. Consider a periodic\none-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites, and attach to each site a real-valued\nvariable, which can be interpreted as a spin, as the concentration of one type\nof metal in an alloy, or as a particle density. Each of these variables is\nsubjected to a local force deriving from a symmetric double-well potential, to\na weak ferromagnetic coupling with its nearest neighbours, and to independent\nwhite noise. In addition, the dynamics is constrained to have constant total\nmagnetisation or mass. Using tools from the theory of metastable diffusion\nprocesses, we show that the long-term dynamics of this system is similar to a\nKawasaki-type exchange dynamics, and determine explicit expressions for its\ntransition probabilities. This allows us to describe the system in terms of the\ndynamics of its interfaces, and to compute an Eyring-Kramers formula for its\nspectral gap. In particular, we obtain that the spectral gap scales like the\ninverse system size squared.\n", "  Dileptons, as an electromagnetic probe, are crucial to study the properties\nof a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy ion collisions. We calculated\nthe invariant mass spectra and the anisotropic emission of thermal dielectrons\nfrom Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$~GeV based on EPOS3. This approach provides a realistic\n(3+1)-dimensional event-by-event viscous hydrodynamic description of the\nexpanding hot and dense matter with a very particular initial condition, and a\nlarge set of hadron data and direct photons (besides $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ !) can\nbe successfully reproduced. Thermal dilepton emission from both the QGP phase\nand the hadronic gas are considered, with the emission rates based on Lattice\nQCD and a vector meson model, respectively. We find that the computed invariant\nmass spectra (thermal contribution + STAR cocktail) can reproduce the measured\nones from STAR at different centralities. Different compared to other model\npredictions, the obtained elliptic flow of thermal dileptons is larger than the\nSTAR measurement referring to all dileptons. We observe a clear centrality\ndependence of thermal dilepton not only for elliptic flow $v_{2}$ but also for\nhigher orders. At a given centrality, $v_{n}$ of thermal dileptons decreases\nmonotonically with $n$ for $2\\leq n\\leq5$.\n", "  The topological classification of a series of frustration-induced spin-gap\nphases in the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic--antiferromagnetic alternating Heisenberg\nchain with next-nearest-neighbour interaction reported in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n82, 064703 (2013) is confirmed using two kinds of entanglement spectra defined\nby different divisions of the whole chain. For the numerical calculation, the\niDMRG method is used. The results are consistent with the valence bond solid\npicture proposed in the previous paper.\n", "  The compositional dependence of thermal expansion behaviour in 19 different\nperovskite-like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of composition [AI][MII(HCOO)3]\n(A = alkylammonium cation; M = octahedrally-coordinated divalent metal) is\nstudied using variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction measurements. While\nall systems show essentially the same type of thermomechanical\nresponse-irrespective of their particular structural details-the magnitude of\nthis response is shown to be a function of AI and MII cation radii, as well as\nthe molecular anisotropy of AI. Flexibility is maximised for large MII and\nsmall AI, while the shape of AI has implications for the direction of framework\nhingeing.\n", "  We propose an efficient dual boson scheme, which extends the DMFT paradigm to\ncollective excitations in correlated systems. The theory is fully\nself-consistent both on the one- and on the two-particle level, thus describing\nthe formation of collective modes as well as the renormalization of electronic\nand bosonic spectra on equal footing. The method employs an effective impurity\nmodel comprising both fermionic and bosonic hybridization functions. Only\nsingle- and two-electron Green's functions of the reference problem enter the\ntheory, due to the optimal choice of the self-consistency condition for the\neffective bosonic bath. We show that the theory is naturally described by a\ndual Luttinger-Ward functional and obeys the relevant conservation laws.\n", "  We analyze the compatibility of the unified left-right symmetric Pati-Salam\nmodels motivated by non-commutative geometry and the TeV scale right-handed W\nboson suggested by recent LHC data. We find that the unification/matching\nconditions place conflicting demands on the symmetry breaking scales and that\ngenerating the required W_R mass and coupling is non-trivial.\n", "  Liquid crystals are phases of matter intermediate between crystals and\nliquids. Whereas classical liquid crystals have been known for a long time and\nare used in electro-optical displays, much less is known about their quantum\ncounterparts. There is growing evidence that quantum liquid crystals play a\ncentral role in many electron systems including high temperature\nsuperconductors, but a quantitative understanding is lacking due to disorder\nand other complications. Here, we analyse the quantum phase diagram of a\ntwo-dimensional dipolar gas, which exhibits stripe, nematic and supersolid\nphases. We calculate the stiffness constants determining the stability of the\nnematic and stripe phases, and the melting of the stripes set by the\nproliferation of topological defects is analysed microscopically. Our results\nfor the critical temperatures of these phases demonstrate that a controlled\nstudy of the interplay between quantum liquid and superfluid phases is within\nexperimental reach for the first time, using dipolar gases.\n", "  The heat transport in a system of $S=1/2$ large-$J$ Heisenberg spin chains,\ndescribing closely Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ and SrCuO$_2$ cuprates, is studied\ntheoretically at $T\\ll J$ by considering interactions of the bosonized spin\nexcitations with optical phonons and defects. Treating rigorously the\nmulti-boson processes, we derive a microscopic spin-phonon scattering rate that\nadheres to an intuitive picture of phonons acting as thermally populated\ndefects for the fast spin excitations. The mean-free path of the latter\nexhibits a distinctive $T$-dependence reflecting a critical nature of spin\nchains and gives a close description of experiments. By the naturalness\ncriterion of realistically small spin-phonon interaction, our approach stands\nout from previous considerations that require large coupling constants to\nexplain the data and thus imply a spin-Peierls transition, absent in real\nmaterials.\n", "  With the increasing interplay between experimental and computational\napproaches at multiple length scales, new research directions are emerging in\nmaterials science and computational mechanics. Such cooperative interactions\nfind many applications in the development, characterization and design of\ncomplex material systems. This manuscript provides a broad and comprehensive\noverview of recent trends where predictive modeling capabilities are developed\nin conjunction with experiments and advanced characterization to gain a greater\ninsight into structure-properties relationships and study various physical\nphenomena and mechanisms. The focus of this review is on the intersections of\nmultiscale materials experiments and modeling relevant to the materials\nmechanics community. After a general discussion on the perspective from various\ncommunities, the article focuses on the latest experimental and theoretical\nopportunities. Emphasis is given to the role of experiments in multiscale\nmodels, including insights into how computations can be used as discovery tools\nfor materials engineering, rather than to \"simply\" support experimental work.\nThis is illustrated by examples from several application areas on structural\nmaterials. This manuscript ends with a discussion on some problems and open\nscientific questions that are being explored in order to advance this\nrelatively new field of research.\n", "  Surface enhanced Raman spectra from molecules (bipyridyl ethylene) adsorbed\non gold dumbells are observed to become increasingly asymmetric (Fano-like) at\nhigher incident light intensity. The electronic temperature (inferred from the\nanti-Stokes (AS) electronic Raman signal increases at the same time while no\nvibrational AS scattering is seen. These observations are analyzed by assuming\nthat the molecule-metal coupling contains an intensity dependent contribution\n(resulting from light-induced charge transfer transitions as well as\nrenormalization of the molecule metal tunneling barrier). We find that\ninterference between vibrational and electronic inelastic scattering routes is\npossible in the presence of strong enough electron-vibrational coupling and can\nin principle lead to the observed Fano-like feature in the Raman scattering\nprofile. However the best fit to the observed results, including the dependence\non incident light intensity and the associated thermal response is obtained\nfrom a model that disregards this coupling and accounts for the structure of\nthe continuous electronic component of the Raman scattering signal. The\ntemperatures inferred from the Raman signal are argued to be only of\nqualitative value.\n", "  Many of the exotic properties proposed to occur in graphene rely on the\npossibility of increasing the spin orbit coupling (SOC). By combining\nanalytical and numerical tight binding calculations, in this work we study the\nSOC induced by heavy adatoms with active electrons living in $p$ orbitals.\nDepending on the position of the adatoms on graphene different kinds of SOC\nappear. Adatoms located in hollow position induce spin conserving intrinsic\nlike SOC whereas a random distribution of adatoms induces a spin flipping\nRashba like SOC. The induced SOC is linearly proportional to the adatoms\nconcentration, indicating the inexistent interference effects between different\nadatoms. By computing the Hall conductivity we have proved the stability of the\ntopological quantum Hall phases created by the adatoms against inhomogeneous\nspin orbit coupling . For the case of Pb adatoms, we find that a concentration\nof 0.1 adatom per carbon atom generates SOC's of the order of $\\sim$40$meV$.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of a novel inter-orbital Feshbach\nresonance in ultracold 173-Yb atoms, which opens the possibility of tuning the\ninteractions between the 1S0 and 3P0 metastable state, both possessing\nvanishing total electronic angular momentum. The resonance is observed at\nexperimentally accessible magnetic field strengths and occurs universally for\nall hyperfine state combinations. We characterize the resonance in the bulk via\ninter-orbital cross-thermalization as well as in a three-dimensional lattice\nusing high-resolution clock-line spectroscopy.\n", "  Radio synchrotron emission is a powerful tool to study the strength and\nstructure of magnetic fields in galaxies. Unpolarized synchrotron emission\ntraces isotropic turbulent fields which are strongest in spiral arms and bars\n(20-30 \\mu G) and in central starburst regions (50-100 \\mu G). Such fields are\ndynamically important; they affect gas flows and drive gas inflows in central\nregions. -- Polarized emission traces ordered fields, which can be regular or\nanisotropic turbulent, where the latter originates from isotropic turbulent\nfields by the action of compression or shear. The strongest ordered fields\n(10-15 \\mu G) are generally found in interarm regions. In galaxies with strong\ndensity waves, ordered fields are also observed at the inner edges of spiral\narms. Ordered fields with spiral patterns exist in grand-design, barred and\nflocculent galaxies, and in central regions. Ordered fields in interacting\ngalaxies have asymmetric distributions and are a tracer of past interactions\nbetween galaxies or with the intergalactic medium. In radio halos around\nedge-on galaxies, ordered magnetic fields with X-shaped patterns are observed.\n-- Faraday rotation measures of the diffuse polarized radio emission from\ngalaxy disks reveal large-scale spiral patterns that can be described by the\nsuperposition of azimuthal modes; these are signatures of regular fields\ngenerated by mean-field dynamos. \"Magnetic arms\" between gaseous spiral arms\nmay also be products of dynamo action, but need a stable spiral pattern to\ndevelop. Helically twisted field loops winding around spiral arms were found in\ntwo galaxies so far. Large-scale field reversals, like the one found in the\nMilky Way, could not yet be detected in external galaxies. -- The origin and\nevolution of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied with forthcoming radio\ntelescopes like the Square Kilometre Array.\n", "  Autapses are synapses that connect a neuron to itself in the nervous system.\nPreviously, both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that\nautaptic connections in the nervous system have a significant physiological\nfunction. Autapses in nature provide self-delayed feedback, thus introducing an\nadditional time scale to neuronal activities and causing many dynamic behaviors\nin neurons. Recently, theoretical studies have revealed that an autapse\nprovides a control option for adjusting the response of a neuron: e.g., an\nautaptic connection can cause the electrical activities of the Hindmarsh-Rose\nneuron to switch between quiescent, periodic, and chaotic firing patterns; an\nautapse can enhance or suppress the mode-locking status of a neuron injected\nwith sinusoidal current; and the firing frequency and interspike interval\ndistributions of the response spike train can also be modified by the autapse.\nIn this paper, we review recent studies that showed how an autapse affects the\nresponse of a single neuron.\n", "  The constraints imposed on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)\nparameter space by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Higgs mass limit and gluino\nmass lower bound are revisited. We also analyze the thermal relic abundance of\nlightest neutralino, which is the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). We\nshow that the combined LHC and relic abundance constraints rule out most of the\nMSSM parameter space except a very narrow region with very large $\\tan\n\\beta~(\\sim 50)$. Within this region, we emphasize that the spin-independent\nscattering cross section of the LSP with a proton is less than the latest Large\nUnderground Xenon (LUX) limit by at least two order of magnitudes. Finally, we\nargue that non-thermal Dark Matter (DM) scenario may relax the constraints\nimposed on the MSSM parameter space. Namely, the following regions are\nobtained: $m_0\\simeq {\\cal O}(4)$ TeV and $m_{1/2}\\simeq 600$ GeV for low\n$\\tan\\beta~(\\sim 10)$; $m_0\\sim m_{1/2} \\simeq {\\cal O}(1)$ TeV or $m_0 \\simeq\n{\\cal O}(4)$ TeV and $m_{1/2} \\simeq 700$ GeV for large $\\tan \\beta~(\\sim 50)$.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall system with Chern number 2 can be destroyed by\nsufficiently strong disorder. During its process towards localization, it was\nfound that the electronic states will be directly localized to an Anderson\ninsulator (with Chern number 0), without an intermediate Hall plateau with\nChern number 1. Here we investigate the topological origin of this phenomenon,\nby calculating the band structures and Chern numbers for disordered supercells.\nWe find that on the route towards localization, there exists a hidden state\nwith Chern number 1, but it is too short and too fluctuating to be practically\nobservable. This intermediate state cannot be stabilized even after some \"smart\ndesign\" of the model and this should be a universal phenomena for insulators\nwith high Chern numbers. By performing numerical scaling of conductances, we\nalso plot the renormalization group flows for this transition, with Chern\nnumber 1 state as an unstable fixed point. This is distinct from known results,\nand can be tested by experiments and further theoretical analysis.\n", "  We study the SU(2) Georgi-Glashow model and suggest a decomposition for its\nfields and obtain a Lagrangian based on new variables. We use Cho's restricted\ndecomposition as a result of a vacuum condition of the Georgi-Glashow model.\nThis model with no external sources leads us to the Cho extended decomposition.\nWe interpret the puzzling field, $ \\textbf{n} $, in Cho's decomposition as the\ncolor direction of the scalar field in the Georgi-Glashow model. We also study\nanother constraint, condensate phase, and generalize Cho's extended\ndecomposition. Finally, we argue about a decomposition form that Faddeev and\nNiemi proposed in this constrained Georgi-Glashow model.\n", "  We prove that, if the time-independent distribution function $F(v;x)$ of a\nsteady-state stellar system is symmetric under velocity inversion such that\n$F(-v_1,v_2,v_3;x)=F(v_1,v_2,v_3;x)$ and the same for $v_2$ and $v_3$, where\n$(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ is the velocity component projected onto an orthogonal frame,\nthen the potential within which the system is in equilibrium must be separable\n(i.e. the Staeckel potential). Furthermore, we find that the Jeans equations\nimply that, if all mixed second moments of the velocity vanish, that is,\n$\\langle v_iv_j\\rangle=0$ for any $i\\ne j$, in some Staeckel coordinate system\nand the only non-vanishing fourth moments in the same coordinate are those in\nthe form of $\\langle v_i^4\\rangle$ or $\\langle v_i^2v_j^2\\rangle$, then the\npotential must be separable in the same coordinates. Finally we also show that\nall second and fourth velocity moments of tracers with an odd power to the\nradial component $v_r$ being zero is a sufficient condition to guarantee the\npotential to be of the form $\\Phi=f(r)+r^{-2}g(\\theta,\\phi)$.\n", "  Cosmic-ray (CR) physics has been a prolific field of research for over a\ncentury. The open problems related to CR acceleration, transport and modulation\nare deeply connected with the indirect searches for particle dark matter (DM).\nIn particular, the high-quality gamma-ray data released by Fermi-LAT are under\nthe spotlight in the scientific community because of a recent claim about a\ninner Galaxy anomaly: The necessity to disentangle the astrophysical emission\ndue to CR interactions from a possible DM signal is therefore compelling and\nrequires a deep knowledge of several non-trivial aspects regarding CR physics.\nI review all these connections in this contribution. In the first part, I\npresent a detailed overview on recent results regarding modeling of cosmic-ray\n(CR) production and propagation: I focus on the necessity to go beyond the\nstandard and simplified picture of uniform and homogeneous diffusion, showing\nthat gamma-ray data point towards different transport regimes in different\nregions of the Galaxy; I sketch the impact of large-scale structure on CR\nobservables, and -- concerning the interaction with the Heliosphere -- I\nmention the necessity to consider a charge-dependent modulation scenario. In\nthe second part, all these aspects are linked to the DM problem. I analyze the\nclaim of a inner Galaxy excess and discuss the impact of the non-trivial\naspects presented in the first part on our understanding of this anomaly.\n", "  We investigate Weyl type asymptotics of functional-difference operators\nassociated to mirror curves of special del Pezzo Calabi-Yau threefolds. These\noperators are $H(\\zeta)=U+U^{-1}+V+\\zeta V^{-1}$ and\n$H_{m,n}=U+V+q^{-mn}U^{-m}V^{-n}$, where $U$ and $V$ are self-adjoint Weyl\noperators satisfying $UV=q^{2}VU$ with $q=e^{i\\pi b^{2}}$, $b>0$ and $\\zeta>0$,\n$m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. We prove that $H(\\zeta)$ and $H_{m,n}$ are self-adjoint\noperators with purely discrete spectrum on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. Using the\ncoherent state transform we find the asymptotical behaviour for the Riesz mean\n$\\sum_{j\\ge 1}(\\lambda-\\lambda_{j})_{+}$ as $\\lambda\\to\\infty$ and prove the\nWeyl law for the eigenvalue counting function $N(\\lambda)$ for these operators,\nwhich imply that their inverses are of trace class.\n", "  I review theoretical ideas and implications of experiments for the gap\nstructure and symmetry of the Fe-based superconductors. Unlike any other class\nof unconventional superconductors, one has in these systems the possibility to\ntune the interactions by small changes in pressure, doping or disorder. Thus,\nmeasurements of order parameter evolution with these parameters should enable a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying interactions. I briefly review the\n\"standard paradigm\" for $s$-wave pairing in these systems, and then focus on\ndevelopments in the past several years which have challenged this picture. I\ndiscuss the reasons for the apparent close competition between pairing in s-\nand d-wave channels, particularly in those systems where one type of Fermi\nsurface pocket -- hole or electron -- is missing. Observation of a transition\nbetween $s$- and $d$-wave symmetry, possibly via a time reversal symmetry\nbreaking \"$s+id$\" state, would provide an importantconfirmation of these ideas.\nSeveral proposals for detecting these novel phases are discussed, including the\nappearance of order parameter collective modes in Raman and optical\nconductivities. Transitions between two different types of $s$-wave states,\ninvolving various combinations of signs on Fermi surface pockets, can also\nproceed through a ${\\cal T}$-breaking \"$s+is$\" state. I discuss recent work\nthat suggests pairing may take place away from the Fermi level over a\nsurprisingly large energy range, as well as the effect of glide plane symmetry\nof the Fe-based systems on the superconductivity, including various exotic,\ntime and translational invariance breaking pair states that have been proposed.\nFinally, I address disorder issues, and the various ways systematic\nintroduction of disorder can (and cannot) be used to extract information on gap\nsymmetry and structure.\n", "  We describe the cryogenic half-wave plate rotation mechanisms built for and\nused in Spider, a polarization-sensitive balloon-borne telescope array that\nobserved the Cosmic Microwave Background at 95 GHz and 150 GHz during a\nstratospheric balloon flight from Antarctica in January 2015. The mechanisms\noperate at liquid helium temperature in flight. A three-point contact design\nkeeps the mechanical bearings relatively small but allows for a large (305 mm)\ndiameter clear aperture. A worm gear driven by a cryogenic stepper motor allows\nfor precise positioning and prevents undesired rotation when the motors are\ndepowered. A custom-built optical encoder system monitors the bearing angle to\nan absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees. The system performed well in Spider\nduring its successful 16 day flight.\n", "  We present a general method to undertake a thorough analysis of the\nthermodynamics of the quantum jump trajectories followed by an arbitrary\nquantum harmonic network undergoing linear and bilinear dynamics. The approach\nis based on the phase-space representation of the state of a harmonic network.\nThe large deviation function associated with this system encodes the full\ncounting statistics of exchange and also allows one to deduce for fluctuation\ntheorems obeyed by the dynamics. We illustrate the method showing the validity\nof a local fluctuation theorem about the exchange of excitations between a\nrestricted part of the environment (i.e., a local bath) and a harmonic network\ncoupled with different schemes.\n", "  The Keldysh-ordered full counting statistics is a quasi-probability\ndistribution describing the fluctuations of a time-integrated quantum\nobservable. While it is well known that this distribution can fail to be\npositive, the interpretation and origin of this negativity has been somewhat\nunclear. Here, we show how the full counting statistics can be tied to\ntrajectories through Hilbert space, and how this directly connects negative\nquasi-probabilities to an unusual interference effect. Our findings are\nillustrated with the example of energy fluctuations in a driven bosonic\nresonator; we discuss how negative quasi-probability here could be detected\nexperimentally using superconducting microwave circuits.\n", "  Using the KEDR detector at the VEPP-4M $e^+e^-$ collider, we have measured\nthe values of $R_{\\text{uds}}$ and $R$ at seven points of the center-of-mass\nenergy between 3.12 and 3.72 GeV. The total achieved accuracy is about or\nbetter than $3.3\\%$ at most of energy points with a systematic uncertainty of\nabout $2.1\\%$. At the moment it is the most accurate measurement of $R(s)$ in\nthis energy range.\n", "  We present an approach to the bright soliton solution of the NLS equation\nfrom the standpoint of introducing a constant potential term in the equation.\nWe discuss a `nongauge' bright soliton for which both the envelope and the\nphase depend only on the traveling variable. We also construct a family of\ngeneralized NLS equations with solitonic sech^p solutions in the traveling\nvariable and find an exact equivalence with other nonlinear equations, such as\nthe Korteveg-de Vries and Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equations when p=2\n", "  Double Neutron Stars (DNS) have to survive two supernovae and still remain\nbound. This sets strong limits on the nature of the second collapse in these\nsystems. We consider the masses and orbital parameters of the DNS population\nand constrain the two distributions of mass ejection and kick velocities\ndirectly from observations with no a-priori assumptions regarding evolutionary\nmodels and/or the types of the supernovae involved. We show that there is\nstrong evidence for two distinct types of supernovae in these systems, where\nthe second collapse in the majority of the observed systems involved small mass\nejection ($\\Delta M\\lesssim 0.5M_{\\odot}$) and a corresponding low-kick\nvelocity ($v_{k}\\lesssim 30 $km\\,s$^{-1}$). This formation scenario is\ncompatible, for example, with an electron capture supernova. Only a minority of\nthe systems have formed via the standard SN scenario involving larger mass\nejection of $\\sim 2.2 M_{\\odot}$ and kick velocities of up to\n$400$km\\,s$^{-1}$. Due to the typically small kicks in most DNS (which are\nreflected by rather low proper motion), we predict that most of these systems\nreside close to the galactic disc. In particular, this implies that more NS-NS\nmergers occur close to the galactic plane. This may have non-trivial\nimplications to the estimated merger rates of DNS and to the rate of LIGO /\nVIRGO detections.\n", "  Tensor generalizations of affine vector fields called symmetric and\nantisymmetric affine tensor fields are discussed as symmetry of spacetimes. We\nreview the properties of the symmetric ones, which have been studied in earlier\nworks, and investigate the properties of the antisymmetric ones, which are the\nmain theme in this paper. It is shown that antisymmetric affine tensor fields\nare closely related to one-lower-rank antisymmetric tensor fields which are\nparallelly transported along geodesics. It is also shown that the number of\nlinear independent rank-$p$ antisymmetric affine tensor fields in $n$\ndimensions is bounded by $(n+1)!/p!(n-p)!$. We also derive the integrability\nconditions for antisymmetric affine tensor fields. Using the integrability\nconditions, we discuss the existence of antisymmetric affine tensor fields on\nvarious spacetimes.\n", "  We apply the numerical bootstrap program to chiral operators in\nfour-dimensional ${\\mathcal N}=2$ SCFTs. In the first part of this work we\nstudy four-point functions in which all fields have the same conformal\ndimension. We give special emphasis to bootstrapping a specific theory: the\nsimplest Argyres-Douglas fixed point with no flavor symmetry. In the second\npart we generalize our setup and consider correlators of fields with unequal\ndimension. This is an example of a mixed correlator and allows us to probe new\nregions in the parameter space of ${\\mathcal N}=2$ SCFTs. In particular, our\nresults put constraints on relations in the Coulomb branch chiral ring and on\nthe curvature of the Zamolodchikov metric.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is optimized for observations in the\nnear and mid infrared and will provide essential observations for targets that\ncannot be conducted from the ground or other missions during its lifetime. The\nstate of the art science instruments, along with the telescopes moving target\ntracking, will enable the infrared study, with unprecedented detail, for nearly\nevery object, Mars and beyond, in the solar system. The goals of this special\nissue are to stimulate discussion and encourage participation in JWST planning\namong members of the planetary science community. Key science goals for various\ntargets, observing for JWST, and highlights for the complementary nature with\nother missions and observatories are described in this paper.\n", "  Band gap engineering in SrTiO${}_{3}$ and related titanate perovskites has\nlong been explored due to the intriguing properties of the materials for\nphotocatalysis and photovoltaic applications. A popular approach in the\nmaterials chemistry community is to substitutionally dope aliovalent transition\nmetal ions onto the B site in the lattice to alter the valence band. However,\nin such a scheme there is limited control over the dopant valence, and\ncompensating defects often form. Here we demonstrate a novel technique to\ncontrollably synthesize Fe$^{2+}$- and Fe$^{3+}$-doped SrTiO${}_{3}$ thin films\nwithout formation of compensating defects by co-doping with La$^{3+}$ ions on\nthe A site. We stabilize Fe$^{2+}$-doped films by doping with two La ions for\nevery Fe dopant, and find that the Fe ions exhibit a low-spin electronic\nconfiguration, producing optical transitions in the near infrared regime and\ndegenerate doping. The novel electronic states observed here offer a new avenue\nfor band gap engineering in perovskites for photocatalytic and photovoltaic\napplications.\n", "  Recently, several new materials exhibiting massless Dirac fermions have been\nproposed. However, many of these do not have the typical graphene honeycomb\nlattice, which is often associated with Dirac cones. Here, we present a\nclassification of these different two-dimensional Dirac systems based on the\nspace groups, and discuss our findings within the context of a minimal two-band\nmodel. In particular, we show that the emergence of massless Dirac fermions can\nbe attributed to the mirror symmetries of the materials. Moreover, we uncover\nseveral novel Dirac systems that have up to twelve inequivalent Dirac cones,\nand show that these can be realized in (twisted) bilayers. Hereby, we obtain\nsystems with an emergent SU(2N) valley symmetry with N=1,2,4,6,8,12. Our\nresults pave the way to engineer different Dirac systems, besides providing a\nsimple and unified description of materials ranging from square- and\n$\\beta$-graphynes, to Pmmn-Boron, TiB$_2$, phosphorene, and anisotropic\ngraphene.\n", "  We propose a dark energy model where a scalar field $\\phi$ has nonlinear\nself-interactions in the presence of a dilatonic coupling with the Ricci\nscalar. This belongs to a sub-class of theories beyond Horndeski, which\naccommodates covariant Galileons and Brans-Dicke theories as specific cases. We\nderive conditions under which the scalar sound speed squared $c_{\\rm s}^2$ is\npositive from the radiation era to today. Since $c_{\\rm s}^2$ remains to be\nsmaller than the order of 1, the deviation from Horndeski theories does not\ncause heavy oscillations of gauge-invariant gravitational potentials. In this\ncase, the evolution of matter perturbations at low redshifts is similar to that\nin the coupled dark energy scenario with an enhanced gravitational interaction.\nOn the spherically symmetric background with a matter source, the existence of\nfield self-interactions suppresses the propagation of fifth force inside a\nVainshtein radius. We estimate an allowed parameter space in which the model\ncan be compatible with solar system constraints while satisfying conditions for\nthe cosmological viability of background and perturbations.\n", "  We study mechanical dissipation of the fundamental mode of millimeter-sized,\nhigh quality-factor ($Q$) metalized silicon nitride membranes at temperatures\ndown to 14 mK using a three-dimensional optomechanical cavity. Below 200 mK,\nhigh-$Q$ modes of the membranes show a diverging increase of $Q$ with\ndecreasing temperature, reaching $Q=1.27\\times10^8$ at 14 mK, an order of\nmagnitude higher than reported before. The ultra-low dissipation makes the\nmembranes highly attractive for the study of optomechanics in the quantum\nregime, as well as for other applications of optomechanics such as microwave to\noptical photon conversion.\n", "  We study the effects of electron doping in Mott insulators containing d^4\nions such as Ru4+, Os4+, Rh5+, and Ir5+ with J=0 singlet ground state.\nDepending on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, the undoped systems are\neither nonmagnetic or host an unusual, excitonic magnetism arising from a\ncondensation of the excited J=1 triplet states of t_2g^4. We find that the\ninteraction between J-excitons and doped carriers strongly supports\nferromagnetism, converting both the nonmagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of\nthe parent insulator into a ferromagnetic metal, and further to a nonmagnetic\nmetal. Close to the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy spin response is\ndominated by intense paramagnon excitations that may act as mediators of a\ntriplet pairing.\n", "  A new nudging method for data assimilation, delay-coordinate nudging, is\npresented. Delay-coordinate nudging makes explicit use of present and past\nobservations in the formulation of the forcing driving the model evolution at\neach time-step. Numerical experiments with a low order chaotic system show that\nthe new method systematically outperforms standard nudging in different model\nand observational scenarios, also when using an un-optimized formulation of the\ndelay-nudging coefficients. A connection between the optimal delay and the\ndominant Lyapunov exponent of the dynamics is found based on heuristic\narguments and is confirmed by the numerical results, providing a guideline for\nthe practical implementation of the algorithm. Delay-coordinate nudging\npreserves the easiness of implementation, the intuitive functioning and the\nreduced computational cost of the standard nudging, making it a potential\nalternative especially in the field of seasonal-to-decadal predictions with\nlarge Earth system models that limit the use of more sophisticated data\nassimilation procedures.\n", "  Nucleon exchange mechanism is investigated in the central collisions of\n${}^{40}$Ca + ${}^{238}$U and ${}^{48}$Ca + ${}^{238}$U systems near the\nquasi-fission regime in the framework of the Stochastic Mean-Field (SMF)\napproach. Sufficiently below the fusion barrier, di-nuclear structure in the\ncollisions is maintained to a large extend. Consequently, it is possible to\ndescribe nucleon exchange as a diffusion process familiar from deep-inelastic\ncollisions. Diffusion coefficients for proton and neutron exchange are\ndetermined from the microscopic basis of the SMF approach in the semi-classical\nframework. Calculations show that after a fast charge equilibration the system\ndrifts toward symmetry over a very long interaction time. Large dispersions of\nproton and neutron distributions of the produced fragments indicate that\ndiffusion mechanism may help to populate heavy trans-uranium elements near the\nquasi-fission regime in these collisions.\n", "  With the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, we performed HI observations\nof a sample of known X-ray emitting Gigahertz-peaked-spectrum galaxies with\ncompact-symmetric-object morphology (GPS/CSOs) that lacked an HI absorption\ndetection. We combined radio and X-ray data of the full sample of X-ray\nemitting GPS/CSOs and found a significant, positive correlation between the\ncolumn densities of the total and neutral hydrogen ($N_{\\rm H}$ and $N_{\\rm\nHI}$, respectively). Using a Bayesian approach, we simultaneously quantified\nthe parameters of the $N_{\\rm H} - N_{\\rm HI}$ relation and the intrinsic\nspread of the data set. For a specific subset of our sample, we found $N_{\\rm\nH} \\propto N_{\\rm HI}^b$, with $b=0.93^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$, and $\\sigma_{int}\n(N_{\\rm H})= 1.27^{+1.30}_{-0.40}$. The $N_{\\rm H} - N_{\\rm HI}$ correlation\nsuggests a connection between the physical properties of the radio and X-ray\nabsorbing gas.\n", "  By attaching three anticommuting Lorentz scalar (colour) property coordinates\nto space-time, with an appropriate extended metric, we unify gravity with\nchromodynamics: gauge transformations then just correspond to coordinate\ntransformations in the enlarged spacetime-property space.\n", "  In this paper we consider how the strong-coupling scale, or perturbative\ncutoff, in a multi-gravity theory depends upon the presence and structure of\ninteractions between the different fields. This can elegantly be rephrased in\nterms of the size and structure of the `theory graph' which depicts the\ninteractions in a given theory. We show that the question can be answered in\nterms of the properties of various graph-theoretical matrices, affording an\nefficient way to estimate and place bounds on the strong-coupling scale of a\ngiven theory. In light of this we also consider the problem of relating a given\ntheory graph to a discretised higher dimensional theory, a la dimensional\ndeconstruction.\n", "  We introduce a shortcut to the adiabatic gate teleportation model of quantum\ncomputation. More specifically, we determine fast local counterdiabatic\nHamiltonians able to implement teleportation as a universal computational\nprimitive. In this scenario, we provide the counterdiabatic driving for\narbitrary n-qubit gates, which allows to achieve universality through a variety\nof gate sets. Remarkably, our approach maps the superadiabatic Hamiltonian for\nan arbitrary n-qubit gate teleportation into the implementation of a rotated\nsuperadiabatic dynamics of an n-qubit state teleportation. This result is\nrather general, with the speed of the evolution only dictated by the quantum\nspeed limit. In particular, we analyze the energetic cost for different\nHamiltonian interpolations in the context of the energy-time complementarity.\n", "  Magnetized plasmas traversed by linearly polarized light will reveal their\npresence by the frequency dependent Faraday rotation of the angle of\npolarization. The regions surrounding the black holes powering the jets in AGNs\nare expected to have dense magnetized plasmas, possibly giving rise to very\nlarge Faraday rotations. Compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are good\ncandidates to search for very large Faraday rotated components as they contain\ncompact emission from close to the black hole and many are strongly depolarized\nat centimeter wavelengths as expected from strong Faraday effects. We present\ndata on several CSS sources (3C48, 3C138 and 3C147) observed with the VLA at\nfrequencies between 20 and 48 GHz in the most extended configuration. Large,\nbut not excessive rotation measures are reported.\n", "  We determine the coefficients of the terms multiplying the gauge fields,\ngravitational field and cosmological term in a scheme whereby properties are\ncharacterized by $N$ anticommuting scalar Grassmann variables. We do this for\ngeneral $N$, using analytical methods; this obviates the need for our algebraic\ncomputing package which can become quite unwieldy as $N$ is increased.\n", "  The family of organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials has generated\ntremendous interest in the field of photovoltaics due to their high power\nconversion efficiencies. There has been intensive development of cells based on\nthe archetypal methylammonium (MA)and recently introduced formamidinium (FA)\nmaterials, however, there is still considerable controversy over their\nfundamental electronic properties. Two of the most important parameters are the\nbinding energy of the exciton (R$^{*}$) and its reduced effective mass $\\mu$.\nHere we present extensive magneto optical studies of Cl assisted grown\nMAPbI$_{3}$ as well as MAPbBr$_{3}$ and the FA based materials FAPbI$_{3}$ and\nFAPbBr$_{3}$. We fit the excitonic states as a hydrogenic atom in magnetic\nfield and the Landau levels for free carriers to give R$^{*}$ and $\\mu$. The\nvalues of the exciton binding energy are in the range 14 - 25 meV in the low\ntemperature phase and fall considerably at higher temperatures for the\ntri-iodides, consistent with free carrier behaviour in all devices made from\nthese materials. Both R$^{*}$ and $\\mu$ increase approximately proportionally\nto the band gap, and the mass values, 0.09-0.117 m$_{0}$, are consistent with a\nsimple \\textbf{k.p} perturbation approach to the band structure which can be\ngeneralized to predict values for the effective mass and binding energy for\nother members of this perovskite family of materials.\n", "  Three equivalent methods allow to compute the antipode of the Hopf algebras\nof Feynman diagrams in perturbative quantum field theory (QFT): the Dyson-Salam\nformula, the Bogoliubov formula, and the Zimmermann forest formula. Whereas the\nfirst two hold generally for arbitrary connected graded Hopf algebras, the\nthird one requires extra structure properties of the underlying Hopf algebra\nbut has the nice property to reduce drastically the number of terms in the\nexpression of the antipode (it is optimal in that sense).The present article is\nconcerned with the forest formula: we show that it generalizes to arbitrary\nright-handed polynomial Hopf algebras. These Hopf algebras are dual to the\nenveloping algebras of preLie algebras -a structure common to many\ncombinatorial Hopf algebras which is carried in particular by the Hopf algebras\nof Feynman diagrams.\n", "  The \"evolved main-sequence\" channel is thought to contribute significantly to\nthe population of AM CVn type systems in the Galaxy, and also to the number of\ncataclysmic variables detected below the period minimum for hydrogen rich\nsystems. CSS120422:J111127+571239 was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in\nApril 2012. Its period was found to be 56 minutes, well below the minimum, and\nthe optical spectrum is clearly depleted in hydrogen relative to helium, but\nstill has two orders of magnitude more hydrogen than AM CVn stars. Doppler\ntomography of the H$\\alpha$ line hinted at a spiral structure existing in the\ndisk. Here we present spectroscopy of CSS120422:J111127+571239 using the COS\nFUV instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope and using the MODS spectrograph on\nthe Large Binocular Telescope. The UV spectrum shows SiIV, NV and HeII, but no\ndetectable CIV. The anomalous nitrogen/carbon ratio is seen in a small number\nof other CVs and confirms a unique binary evolution. We also present and\ncompare the optical spectrum of V418 Ser and advocate that it is also an\nevolved main-sequence system.\n", "  We calculate how the energy and the opening angle of jets in ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM\ntheory evolve as they propagate through the strongly coupled plasma of that\ntheory. We define the rate of energy loss $dE_{\\rm jet}/dx$ and the jet opening\nangle in a straightforward fashion directly in the gauge theory before\ncalculating both holographically, in the dual gravitational description. In\nthis way, we rederive the previously known result for $dE_{\\rm jet}/dx$ without\nthe need to introduce a finite slab of plasma. We obtain a striking\nrelationship between the initial opening angle of the jet, which is to say the\nopening angle that it would have had if it had found itself in vacuum instead\nof in plasma, and the thermalization distance of the jet. Via this\nrelationship, we show that ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM jets with any initial energy that\nhave the same initial opening angle and the same trajectory through the plasma\nexperience the same fractional energy loss. We also provide an expansion that\ndescribes how the opening angle of the ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM jets increases slowly\nas they lose energy, over the fraction of their lifetime when their fractional\nenergy loss is not yet large. We close by looking ahead toward potential\nqualitative lessons from our results for QCD jets produced in heavy collisions\nand propagating through quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  Recently I proposed the linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, which\nis characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. This turn from physics to language does not only extend\nquantum theory to classical theory but also yield the quantum mechanical world\nview. Although the wave function collapse is prohibited in the linguistic\ninterpretation, in this paper I show that the phenomenon like wave function\ncollapse can be realized in the linguistic interpretation. And furthermore, I\npropose the justification of the von Neumann-L\\\"uders projection postulate.\nAfter all, I conclude that the wave function collapse should not be adopted in\nthe Copenhagen interpretation.\n", "  We introduce and demonstrate the power of a method to speed up current\niterative techniques for N-body modified gravity simulations. Our method is\nbased on the observation that the accuracy of the final result is not\ncompromised if the calculation of the fifth force becomes less accurate, but\nsubstantially faster, in high-density regions where it is weak due to\nscreening. We focus on the nDGP model which employs Vainshtein screening, and\ntest our method by running AMR simulations in which the solutions on the finer\nlevels of the mesh (high density) are not obtained iteratively, but instead\ninterpolated from coarser levels. We show that the impact this has on the\nmatter power spectrum is below $1\\%$ for $k < 5h/{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z = 0$, and\neven smaller at higher redshift. The impact on halo properties is also small\n($\\lesssim 3\\%$ for abundance, profiles, mass; and $\\lesssim 0.05\\%$ for\npositions and velocities). The method can boost the performance of modified\ngravity simulations by more than a factor of 10, which allows them to be pushed\nto resolution levels that were previously hard to achieve.\n", "  In a conventional framework, superconductivity is lost at a critical\ntemperature (T_c) because, at higher temperatures, gluing bosons can no longer\nbind two electrons into a Cooper pair. In high-T_c cuprates, it is still\nunknown how superconductivity vanishes at T_c. We provide evidence that the\nso-called <~70-meV kink bosons that dress the quasi-particle excitations are\nplaying a key role in the loss of superconductivity in a cuprate. We irradiated\na 170-fs laser pulse on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\\delta and monitored the responses of the\nsuperconducting gap and dressed quasi-particles by time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. We observe an ultrafast loss of superconducting gap\nnear the d-wave node, or light-induced Fermi arcs, which is accompanied by\nspectral broadenings and weight redistributions occurring within the kink\nbinding energy. We discuss that the underlying mechanism of the spectral\nbroadening that induce the Fermi arc is the undressing of quasi-particles from\nthe kink bosons. The loss mechanism is beyond the conventional framework, and\ncan accept the unconventional phenomena such as the signatures of Cooper pairs\nremaining at temperatures above T_c.\n", "  Radiometry has been of fundamental importance in astronomy from the early\nbeginnings. In this review, we provide an overview of how to achieve a valid\nlaboratory calibration of space telescopes and discuss ways to reliably extend\nthis calibration to the spectroscopic telescope's performance in space.\nRecently, the quest for independent calibrations traceable to laboratory\nstandards has become a well-supported aim and has led to plans for launching\ncalibration rockets for the visible and infrared spectral range. A survey of\nthe calibration of instruments observing from the X-ray to the infrared\nspectral domains rounds off this review.\n", "  We have studied the doping-driven orbital-selective Mott transition in\nmulti-band Hubbard models with equal band width in the presence of crystal\nfield splitting. Crystal field splitting lifts one of the bands while leaving\nthe others degenerate. We use single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined\nwith continuous time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver to calculate a phase\ndiagram as a function of total electron filling $N$ and crystal field splitting\n$\\Delta$. We find a large region of orbital-selective Mott phase in the phase\ndiagram when the doping is large enough. Further analysis indicates that the\nlarge region of orbital-selective Mott phase is driven and stabilized by\ndoping. Such models may account for the orbital-selective Mott transition in\nsome doped realistic strongly correlated materials.\n", "  The Faraday effect is a representative magneto-optical phenomenon, resulting\nfrom the transfer of angular momentum between interacting light and matter in\nwhich time-reversal symmetry has been broken by an externally applied magnetic\nfield. Here we report on the Faraday rotation induced in the prominent 3D\ntopological insulator Bi2Se3 due to bulk interband excitations. The origin of\nthis non-resonant effect, extraordinarily strong among other non-magnetic\nmaterials, is traced back to the specific Dirac-type Hamiltonian for Bi2Se3,\nwhich implies that electrons and holes in this material closely resemble\nrelativistic particles with a non-zero rest mass.\n", "  Attractor neural network is an important theoretical scenario for modeling\nmemory function in the hippocampus and in the cortex. In these models, memories\nare stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the\nform of \"attractor states\". The maximal information capacity for conventional\nabstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.\nHowever, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of\nbits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional\nattractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor\nnetwork that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has\ntwo layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$\nneurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed\nduring the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as\nfixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,\ninitially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule\ncalled the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer\nconnections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information\ncapacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first\norder approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I\nsimulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The\nexponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying\nfactor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.\nAdditionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry\nof the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with\nthe expansion ratio. These results highlight the role of hierarchical\narchitecture in remarkably increasing the performance of information storage in\nattractor networks.\n", "  We study electroweak interactions in the multiscale theory with\n$q$-derivatives, a framework where spacetime has the typical features of a\nmultifractal. In the simplest case with only one characteristic time, length\nand energy scale $t_*$, $\\ell_*$, and $E_*$, we consider (i) the muon decay\nrate and (ii) the Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom, and constrain the\ncorrections to the ordinary results. We obtain the independent absolute upper\nbounds (i) $t_* < 10^{-13}{\\rm s}$ and (ii) $E_*>35\\,\\text{MeV}$. Under some\nmild theoretical assumptions, the Lamb shift alone yields the even tighter\nranges $t_*<10^{-27}\\,{\\rm s}$, $\\ell_*<10^{-19}\\,{\\rm m}$, and\n$E_*>450\\,\\text{GeV}$. To date, these are the first robust constraints on the\nscales at which the multifractal features of the geometry can become important\nin a physical process.\n", "  We consider new regular exact spherically symmetric solutions of a nonminimal\nEinstein--Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant and a gauge field of\nmagnetic Wu-Yang type. The most interesting solutions found are black holes\nwith metric and curvature invariants that are regular everywhere, i.e., regular\nblack holes. We set up a classification of the solutions according to the\nnumber and type of horizons. The structure of these regular black holes is\ncharacterized by four specific features: a small cavity in the neighborhood of\nthe center, a repulsion barrier off the small cavity, a distant equilibrium\npoint, in which the metric function has a minimum, and a region of Newtonian\nattraction. Depending on the sign and value of the cosmological constant the\nsolutions are asymptotically de Sitter (dS), asymptotically flat, or\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS).\n", "  The existence of stationary points for the dynamical system of ABC-flow is\nconsidered. The ABC-flow, a three-parameter velocity field that provides a\nsimple stationary solution of Euler's equations in three dimensions for\nincompressible, inviscid fluid flows, is the prototype for the study of\nturbulence (it provides a simple example of dynamical chaos). But,\nnevertheless, between the chaotic trajectories of the appropriate solutions of\nsuch a system we can reveal the stationary points, the deterministic basis\namong the chaotic behaviour of ABC-flow dynamical system. It has been proved\nthe existence of 1 point for two partial cases of parameters {A, B, C}: 1) A =\nB = 1; 2) C = 1 (A^2 + B^2 = 1). Moreover, dynamical system of ABC-flow allows\n3 points of such a type, depending on the meanings of parameters {A, B, C}.\n", "  The effect of oscillatory shear strain on nonaffine rearrangements of\nindividual particles in a three-dimensional binary glass is investigated using\nmolecular dynamics simulations. The amorphous material is represented by the\nKob-Andersen mixture at the temperature well below the glass transition. We\nfind that during periodic shear deformation of the material, some particles\nundergo reversible nonaffine displacements with amplitudes that are\napproximately power-law distributed. Our simulations show that particles with\nlarge amplitudes of nonaffine displacement exhibit a collective behavior;\nnamely, they tend to aggregate into relatively compact clusters that become\ncomparable with the system size near the yield strain. Along with reversible\ndisplacements there exist a number of irreversible ones. With increasing strain\namplitude, the probability of irreversible displacements during one cycle\nincreases, which leads to permanent structural relaxation of the material.\n", "  Dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model is investigated by employing a\nmultitude of the Davydov D$_1$ trial states, also known as the multi-D$_1$\nAnsatz. Accuracy in dynamics simulations is improved significantly over the\nsingle D$_1$ Ansatz, especially in the weak system-bath coupling regime. The\nreliability of the multi-D$_1$ Ansatz for various coupling strengths and\ninitial conditions are also systematically examined, with results compared\nclosely with those of the hierarchy equations of motion and the path integral\nMonte Carlo approaches. In addition, a coherent-incoherent phase crossover in\nthe nonequilibrium dynamics is studied through the multi-D$_1$ Ansatz. The\nphase diagram is obtained with a critical point $s_{c}=0.4$. For $s_{c}<s<1$,\nthe coherent-to-incoherent crossover occurs at a certain coupling strength,\nwhile the coherent state recurs at a much larger coupling strength. For\n$s<s_{c}$, only the coherent phase exists.\n", "  The Marangoni effect refers to fluid flow induced by a gradient in surface\ntension at a fluid-fluid interface. We determine the full three-dimensional\nMarangoni flow generated by a non-uniform surface tension profile at the\ninterface of a self-propelled spherical emulsion droplet. For all flow fields\ninside, outside, and at the interface of the droplet, we give analytical\nformulas. We also calculate the droplet velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}^D$, which\ndescribes the swimming kinematics of the droplet, and generalize the squirmer\nparameter $\\beta$, which distinguishes between different swimmer types called\nneutral, pusher, or puller. In the second part of this paper, we present two\nillustrative examples, where the Marangoni effect is used in active emulsion\ndroplets. First, we demonstrate how micelle adsorption can spontaneously break\nthe isotropic symmetry of an initially surfactant-free emulsion droplet, which\nthen performs directed motion. Second, we think about light-switchable\nsurfactants and laser light to create a patch with a different surfactant type\nat the droplet interface. Depending on the setup such as the wavelength of the\nlaser light and the surfactant type in the outer bulk fluid, one can either\npush droplets along unstable trajectories or pull them along straight or\noscillatory trajectories regulated by specific parameters. We explore these\ncases for strongly absorbing and for transparent droplets.\n", "  We propose to use the change of the energy lost by ionization, measured by\nsilicon detectors, before and after the passage through a bulk of dense matter,\nfor unambiguously detecting highly massive single-charged particles, which\ncould be produced at LHC, in particular Winos with mass in the TeV range, whose\nc-tau is expected to be some cms long, although the method is also efficient\nfor masses down to 10GeV. For convenience, a QED derivation of the modern\nversion of the Bethe-Block formula is also provided.\n", "  Density functional theory based calculations within the framework of the\nplane-wave pseudopotential approach are carried out to define the phonon\nspectrum of hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (HAp). It allows to describe the\ntemperature dependence of the electronic spin-lattice relaxation time T1e of\nthe radiation-induced stable radical NO32- in HAp, which was measured in X-band\n(9 GHz, magnetic field strength of 0.34 T) in the temperature range T =\n(10-300) K. It is shown that the temperature behavior of T1e at T > 20 K can be\nfitted via two phonon Raman type processes with the Debye temperature of 280 K\nevaluated from the phonon spectrum.\n", "  Retrocausal models of QM add further weight to the conflict between causality\nand the possible existence of free will. We analyze a simple closed causal loop\nensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic\ntime arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other.\nThe loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus\nforecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law\ntherefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is\nnot revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution\nis demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the Two-State-Vector\nFormalism (TSVF), where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future\nchoice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been\nactually made. To quantify this assertion, \"weak information\" is described in\nterms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does\nnot exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level,\nparticles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and\nfuture states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by\nquantum indeterminism.\n", "  New effects in the frustrated transverse Ising ring are predicted. The system\nis solved based on a mapping of Pauli spin operators to the Jordan-Wigner\nfermions. We group the low-lying energy levels into bands after imposing\nappropriate parity constraint, which projects out the redundant degrees of\nfreedom brought about by the Jordan-Wigner fermions. In the region of strong\nantiferromagnetic coupling, we uncover an unusual gapless phase induced by the\nring frustration. We demonstrate that its ground state exhibits a strong\nlongitudinal spin-spin correlation and possesses a considerably large entropy\nof entanglement. The low-lying energy levels evolve adiabatically in the\ngapless phase, which facilitates us to work out new behaviors of density of\nstates, low-temperature correlation functions and specific heat. We also\npropose an experimental protocol for observing this peculiar gapless phase.\n", "  The operation of Brownian motors is usually described in terms of\nout-of-equilibrium and symmetry-breaking settings, with the relevant\nspatiotemporal symmetries identified from the analysis of the equations of\nmotion for the system at hand. When the appropriate conditions are satisfied,\nsymmetry-related trajectories with opposite current are thought to balance each\nother, yielding suppression of transport. The direction of the current can be\nprecisely controlled around these symmetry points by finely tuning the driving\nparameters. Here we demonstrate, by studying a prototypical Brownian ratchet\nsystem, the existence of {\\it hidden} symmetries, which escape the\nidentification by the standard symmetry analysis, and require different\ntheoretical tools for their revelation. Furthermore, we show that system\ninstabilities may lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking with unexpected\ngeneration of directed transport.\n", "  We carry out a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of convective dynamo in\nthe rotating solar convective envelope driven by the solar radiative diffusive\nheat flux. The simulation is similar to that reported in Fan & Fang (2014) but\nwith further reduced viscosity and magnetic diffusion. The resulting convective\ndynamo produces a large scale mean field that exhibits similar irregular cyclic\nbehavior and polarity reversals, and self-consistently maintains a solar-like\ndifferential rotation. The main driver for the solar-like differential rotation\n(with faster rotating equator) is a net outward transport of angular momentum\naway from the rotation axis by the Reynolds stress, and we found that this\ntransport is enhanced with reduced viscosity and magnetic diffusion.\n", "  Motivated by understanding the liquid core dynamics of tidally deformed\nplanets and moons, we present a study of incompressible flow driven by\nlatitudinal libration within rigid triaxial ellipsoids. We first derive a\nlaminar solution for the inviscid equations of motion under the assumption of\nuniform vorticity flow. This solution exhibits a res- onance if the libration\nfrequency matches the frequency of the spin-over inertial mode. Furthermore, we\nextend our model by introducing a reduced model of the effect of viscous Ekman\nlayers in the limit of low Ekman number (Noir and C\\'ebron 2013). This\ntheoretical approach is consistent with the results of Chan et al. (2011) and\nZhang et al. (2012) for spheroidal geometries. Our results are validated\nagainst systematic three-dimensional numerical simulations. In the second part\nof the paper, we present the first linear sta- bility analysis of this uniform\nvorticity flow. To this end, we adopt different methods (Lifschitz and Hameiri\n1991; Gledzer and Ponomarev 1977) that allow to deduce upper and lower bounds\nfor the growth rate of an instability. Our analysis shows that the uniform\nvorticity base flow is prone to inertial instabilities caused by a parametric\nresonance mechanism. This is confirmed by a set of direct numerical\nsimulations. Applying our results to planetary settings, we find that neither a\nspin-over resonance nor an inertial instability can exist within the liquid\ncore of the Moon, Io and Mercury.\n", "  We present the results of the calculations of longitudinal and Hall\nconductivities of AB-stacked bilayer graphene as a function of frequency,\nfinite chemical potential, temperature both with and without magnetic fields on\na base of 2- and 4-band effective models. The limited cases of the\nconductivities for direct current are derived. The relations being important\nfor optoelectronic among Hall conductivities and Faraday, Kerr angles in the\nAB-bilayers samples in the electric and magnetic fields when the radiation\npasses across bilayer sheets on different kinds a substrate are obtained.\n", "  We enlarge our results from the study of the hopping mechanism of the\noscillation excitation transport in 1D model of one biology-like macromolecular\nchain to the case of a system composed from two 1D parallel macromolecular\nchains with consideration of the properties of intramolecular oscillation\nexcitations. We suppose, that due to the exciton interaction with thermal\noscillation (generated by mechanical phonon subsystem) of structural elements\n(consisting of the peptide group) of the chains, the exciton becomes by self\ntrapped and forms the polaron state. We suggest a model which generalizes the\nmodified Holstein polaron model to the case of two macromolecular chains and\nfind that because of the interchain coupling, the exciton energy band is\nsplitted into two subbands. The hopping process of exciton migration along the\nmacromolecular chains is studied in dependence of system parameters and\ntemperature. We pay an special attention to the temperature range (near T=300\nK) in which living cells operate. It is found that for the certain values of\nthe system parameters there exists the abrupt change of the exciton migration\nnature from practically free (light) exciton motion to an immobile (heavy,\ndressed by phonon cloud) quasiparticle We discuss an application of the\nobtained results to the exciton transport both within deoxyribonucleic acid\nmolecule and in the 2D polymer films organized from such macromolecular chains.\n", "  Power spectrum of the distributed chaos can be represented by a weighted\nsuperposition of the exponential functions which is converged to a stretched\nexponential $\\propto \\exp-(k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta }$. An asymptotic theory has\nbeen developed in order to estimate the value of $\\beta$ for the isotropic\nturbulence. This value has been found to be $\\beta =3/4$. Excellent agreement\nhas been established between this theory and the data of direct numerical\nsimulations not only for the velocity field but also for the passive scalar,\nenergy dissipation rate, and magnetic fields. One can conclude that the\nisotropic turbulence emerges from the distributed chaos.\n", "  In this short note, we revisit the model of a CP-even singlet scalar\nresonance proposed in arXiv:1507.02483, where the resonance appears as the\nlightest composite state made of scalar quarks participating in hidden strong\ndynamics. We show that the model can consistently explain the excess of\ndiphoton events with an invariant mass around 750GeV reported by both the ATLAS\nand CMS experiments. We also discuss the nature of the charged composite states\nin the TeV range which accompany to the neutral scalar. Due to inseparability\nof the dynamical scale and the mass of the resonance, the model also predicts\nsignatures associated with the hidden dynamics such as leptons, jets along with\nmultiple photons at future collider experiments. We also associate the\nTeV-scale dynamics behind the resonance with an explanation of dark matter.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to put forward the claim that Hurwitz's paper\n\"Uber die Erzeugung der Invarianten durch Integration.\" [Gott. Nachrichten\n(1897), 71-90] should be regarded as the origin of random matrix theory in\nmathematics. Here Hurwitz introduced and developed the notion of an invariant\nmeasure for the matrix groups $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$. He also specified a calculus\nfrom which the explicit form of these measures could be computed in terms of an\nappropriate parametrisation - Hurwitz chose to use Euler angles. This enabled\nhim to define and compute invariant group integrals over $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$.\nHis main result can be interpreted probabilistically: the Euler angles of a\nuniformly distributed matrix are independent with beta distributions (and\nconversely). We use this interpretation to give some new probability results.\nHow Hurwitz's ideas and methods show themselves in the subsequent work of Weyl,\nDyson and others on foundational studies in random matrix theory is detailed.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of three dimensional\nself-deformation in an atmospheric micro discharge of the helium microjet\nthrough a tube into the ambient air upon a water electrode. The geometry of the\ndischarge system is axial symmetric. While decreasing the discharge current,\nthree dimensional collective motion of plasma filaments are directly observed.\nThe three dimensional configuration of the discharge self changed from an axial\nsymmetrical horn to a rectangular horn when the water acts as a cathode.\n", "  We consider the leading finite-size effects on some structure constants for\nthe $\\eta$ - deformed $AdS_5\\times S^5$ background in the framework of the\nsemiclassical approach. The leading finite-size corrections are derived for the\ncases when we have two heavy string states represented by giant magnons and for\ntwo different choices of the light states corresponding to dilaton operator\nwith nonzero momentum and primary scalar operators. Since the dual field theory\nis still unknown, the results obtained here must be considered as conjectures\nor as predictions from the string theory side.\n", "  We conjecture how the particle content of the standard model can emerge\nstarting with a supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model in 1+1 dimensions (d = 2) with\nthree real boson and fermion fields. Considering SU(3) transformations, the\nlagrangian and its ground state are SO(3) invariant. The SO(3) symmetry extends\nthe basic IO(1,1) Poincar\\'e symmetry to IO(1,3) for the asymptotic fields\nrequiring physical states to be singlets under the A_4 symmetry that governs\nthe SO(3) embedding. This is linked to the three-family structure. For the\ninternal symmetries of the asymptotic fields an SU(2) x U(1) symmetry remains,\nbroken down as in the standard model. The boson excitations in d = 4 are\nidentified with electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs boson. Fermion\nexcitations come in three families of leptons living in E(1,3) Minkowski space\nor three families of quarks living in E(1,1). Many features of the standard\nmodel now emerge in a natural way. The supersymmetric starting point solves the\nnaturalness problem. The underlying left-right symmetry leads to custodial\nsymmetry in the electroweak sector. In the spectrum one has Dirac-type charged\nleptons and Majorana-type neutrinos. The electroweak behavior of the naturally\nconfined quarks, leads to fractional electric charges and the doublet and\nsinglet structure of left- and right-handed quarks, respectively. Most\nprominent feature is the link between the number of colors, families and space\ndirections.\n", "  We have analyzed the angular momentum of the molecular cloud cores in the\nOrion A giant molecular cloud observed in the N2H+ J = 1-0 line with the\nNobeyama 45 m radio telescope. We have measured the velocity gradient using\nposition velocity diagrams passing through core centers, and made sinusoidal\nfitting against the position angle. 27 out of 34 N2H+ cores allowed us to\nmeasure the velocity gradient without serious confusion. The derived velocity\ngradient ranges from 0.5 to 7.8 km/s/pc. We marginally found that the specific\nangular momentum J/M (against the core radius R) of the Orion N2H+ cores tends\nto be systematically larger than that of molecular cloud cores in cold dark\nclouds obtained by Goodman et al., in the J/M-R relation. The ratio beta of\nrotational to gravitational energy is derived to be beta = 10^{-2.3+/-0.7}, and\nis similar to that obtained for cold dark cloud cores in a consistent\ndefinition. The large-scale rotation of the integral-shaped filament of the\nOrion A giant molecular cloud does not likely govern the core rotation at\nsmaller scales.\n", "  Intense electromagnetic evanescent fields are thermally excited in near\nfields on material surfaces (at distances smaller than the wavelength of peak\nthermal radiation). The property of the fields is of strong interest for it is\nmaterial-specific and is important for understanding a variety of\nsurface-related effects, such as friction forces, Casimir forces, near-field\nheat transfer, and surface-coupled molecular dynamics. On metal surfaces,\nrelevance of surface plasmon polaritons (SPlPs), coupled to collective motion\nof conduction electrons, has attracted strong interest, but has not been\nexplicitly clarified up to the present time. Here, using a passive terahertz\n(THz) near-field microscope with unprecedented high sensitivity, we unveil\ndetailed nature of thermally generated evanescent fields\n(wavelength:lamda0~14.5micron) on metals at room temperature. Our experimental\nresults unambiguously indicate that the thermal waves are short-wavelength\nfluctuating electromagnetic fields, from which relevance of SPlPs is ruled out.\n", "  Thermomagnetic avalanches in superconducting films propagating extremely fast\nwhile forming unpredictable patterns, represent a serious threat for the\nperformance of devices based on such materials. It is shown here that a\nnormal-metal frame surrounding a selected region inside the film area can\nprovide efficient protection from the avalanches during their propagation\nstage. Protective behavior is confirmed by magneto-optical imaging experiments\non NbN films equipped with Cu and Al frames, and also by performing numerical\nsimulations. Experimentally, it is found that while conventional flux creep is\nnot affected by the frames, the dendritic avalanches are partially or fully\nscreened by them. The level of screening depends on the ratio of the sheet\nconductance of the metal and the superconductor in the resistive state, and for\nratios much larger than unity the screening is very efficient.\n", "  A computational fluid dynamics model is used to predict the oscillatory flow\nthrough tapered cylindrical tube sections (jet pumps). The asymmetric shape of\njet pumps results in a time-averaged pressure drop that can be used to suppress\nGedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. However, previous work\nhas shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the\ntime-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow\nseparation in jet pumps are identified and coupled with the observed jet pump\nperformance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be\nshifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother\ntransition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the jet pump.\nThese design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting\nin more effective and robust jet pumps. To make the proposed jet pump designs\nmore compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius\nthat can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the\njet pump performance is investigated. To validate the numerical results, they\nare compared with experimental results for one of the proposed jet pump\ndesigns.\n", "  We present a model of interacting multiple choices of opinions. At each step\nof the process, a listener is persuaded by his/her neighbour, the lobbyist, to\nmodify his/her opinion on two different choices of event. Whether or not the\nlistener will be convinced by the lobbyist depends on the difference between\nhis/her opinion with that of the lobbyist, and with that of the revealed social\nopinion (the social pressure). If the listener is convinced, he/she will modify\nhis/her opinion and update his/her revealed preference, and proceed to persuade\nhis/her next neighbour. If the listener is not convinced by the lobbyist,\nhe/she will retain his/her revealed preference, and try to persuade the\nlobbyist to change his/her opinion. In this case, the direction of opinion\npropagation is reversed. A consensus is reached when all the revealed\npreference is the same. Our numerical results show that consensus can always be\nattained in this model. However, the time needed to achieve consensus, or the\nso-called convergence time, is longer if the listener is more concerned with\nthe public opinion, or is less likely to be influenced by the lobbyist.\n", "  A number of human activities exhibit a bursty pattern, namely periods of very\nhigh activity that are followed by rest periods. Records of this process\ngenerate time series of events whose inter-event times follow a probability\ndistribution that displays a fat tail. The grounds for such phenomenon are not\nyet clearly understood. In the present work we use the freely available\nWikipedia's editing records to tackle this question by measuring the level of\nburstiness, as well as the memory effect of the editing tasks performed by\ndifferent editors in different pages. Our main finding is that, even though the\nediting activity is conditioned by the circadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional\nprobability of an activity of a given duration at a given time of the day is\nindependent from the latter. This suggests that the human activity seems to be\nrelated to the high \"cost\" of starting an action as opposed to the much lower\n\"cost\" of continuing that action.\n", "  Self-consistent chaotic transport is studied in a Hamiltonian mean-field\nmodel. The model provides a simplified description of transport in marginally\nstable systems including vorticity mixing in strong shear flows and electron\ndynamics in plasmas. Self-consistency is incorporated through a mean-field that\ncouples all the degrees-of-freedom. The model is formulated as a large set of\n$N$ coupled standard-like area-preserving twist maps in which the amplitude and\nphase of the perturbation, rather than being constant like in the standard map,\nare dynamical variables. Of particular interest is the study of the impact of\nperiodic orbits on the chaotic transport and coherent structures. Numerical\nsimulations show that self-consistency leads to the formation of a coherent\nmacro-particle trapped around the elliptic fixed point of the system that\nappears together with an asymptotic periodic behavior of the mean field. To\nmodel this asymptotic state, we introduced a non-autonomous map that allows a\ndetailed study of the onset of global transport. A turnstile-type transport\nmechanism that allows transport across instantaneous KAM invariant circles in\nnon-autonomous systems is discussed. As a first step to understand transport,\nwe study a special type of orbits referred to as sequential periodic orbits.\nUsing symmetry properties we show that, through replication, high-dimensional\nsequential periodic orbits can be generated starting from low-dimensional\nperiodic orbits. We show that sequential periodic orbits in the self-consistent\nmap can be continued from trivial (uncoupled) periodic orbits of standard-like\nmaps using numerical and asymptotic methods. Normal forms are used to describe\nthese orbits and to find the values of the map parameters that guarantee their\nexistence. Numerical simulations are used to verify the prediction from the\nasymptotic methods.\n", "  We present in this study a first analysis of the astrometric error budget of\nabsolute astrometry relative to background galaxies using adaptive optics. We\nuse for this analysis multi-conjugated adaptive optics (MCAO) images obtained\nwith GeMS/GSAOI at Gemini South. We find that it is possible to obtain 0.3 mas\nreference precision in a random field with 1 hour on source using faint\nbackground galaxies. Systematic errors are correctable below that level, such\nthat the overall error is approximately 0.4 mas. Because the reference sources\nare extended, we find it necessary to correct for the dependency of the PSF\ncentroid on the used aperture size, which would otherwise cause an important\nbias. This effect needs also to be considered for Extremely Large Telescopes\n(ELTs). When this effect is corrected, ELTs have the potential to measure\nproper motions of dwarfs galaxies around M31 with 10 km/s accuracy over a\nbaseline of 5 years.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the integrable chiral Potts model, as it clearly\nrelates to how we got befriended with Vaughan Jones, whose birthday we\ncelebrated at the Qinhuangdao meeting. Remarkably we can also celebrate the\nbirthday of the model, as it has been introduced about 30 years ago as the\nfirst solution of the star-triangle equations parametrized in terms of higher\ngenus functions. After introducing the most general checkerboard Yang--Baxter\nequation, we specialize to the star-triangle equation, also discussing its\nrelation with knot theory. Then we show how the integrable chiral Potts model\nleads to special identities for basic hypergeometric series in the $q$ a\nroot-of-unity limit. Many of the well-known summation formulae for basic\nhypergeometric series do not work in this case. However, if we require the\nsummand to be periodic, then there are many summable series. For example, the\nintegrability condition, namely, the star-triangle equation, is a summation\nformula for a well-balanced ${}_4\\Phi_3$ series. We finish with a few remarks\nabout the relation with quantum groups at roots of unity.\n", "  We study a family of representations of the canonical commutation relations\n(CCR)-algebra (an infinite number of degrees of freedom), which we call\nadmissible. The family of admissible representations includes the Fock-vacuum\nrepresentation. We show that, to every admissible representation, there is an\nassociated Gaussian stochastic calculus, and we point out that the case of the\nFock-vacuum CCR-representation in a natural way yields the operators of\nMalliavin calculus. And we thus get the operators of Malliavin's calculus of\nvariation from a more algebraic approach than is common. And we obtain explicit\nand natural formulas, and rules, for the operators of stochastic calculus. Our\napproach makes use of a notion of symmetric (closable) pairs of operators. The\nFock-vacuum representation yields a maximal symmetric pair. This duality\nviewpoint has the further advantage that issues with unbounded operators and\ndense domains can be resolved much easier than what is possible with\nalternative tools. With the use of CCR representation theory, we also obtain,\nas a byproduct, a number of new results in multi-variable operator theory which\nwe feel are of independent interest.\n", "  Measurements of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a high quality\nAl/Al$_2$O$_3$/Al junction at temperatures ranging from 3.5 K to 300 K have\nbeen used to extract the barrier properties. Fitting results using Simmons'\nmodel led to a constant value of barrier width $s$$\\sim$20.8~$\\textrm{\\AA}$ and\na continuous increase in the barrier height with decreasing temperature. The\nlatter is used to determine the energy band gap temperature dependence and\naverage phonon frequency $\\omega$ = 2.05 $\\times$ 10$^{13}$ sec$^{-1}$ in\nAl$_2$O$_3$, which adds confidence to the precision of our measurements. The\nbarrier parameters are used to extract the temperature dependent dwell times in\ntunneling ($\\tau_D$ = 3.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-16}$ sec at mid-barrier energies) and\nlocate resonances above the barrier.\n", "  We solve the Duffin-Kemmer-P\\'{e}tiau equation in the presence of a spatially\none-dimensional symmetric potential well. We compute the scattering state\nsolutions and we derive conditions for transmission resonances. The bound\nsolutions are derived by a graphic study and the appearance of the antiparticle\nbound state is discussed.\n", "  The behavior of spinning particles in the stationary homogeneous magnetic\nfield is considered and all types of trajectories for massive and massless\nparticles are found. It is shown that spin of particles in a magnetic field is\nalways arranged parallel or antiparallel to the field. Helicity $e$ plays a\nrole of electric charge. The oscillation frequency of massless particle in a\nmagnetic field increases.\n", "  We present a census of eclipsing binary systems with classical Cepheid as a\ncomponent. All such systems known were found in the OGLE collection of\nclassical Cepheids in the Magellanic System. We extend the list of potential\ncandidates adding four new objects found in the OGLE-IV photometric data.\n  One of the new Cepheids in the eclipsing system, OGLE-SMC-CEP-3235, revealed\nonly one eclipse during 15 years of the OGLE photometric monitoring. However,\nit additionally shows very well pronounced light-time effect indicating that\nthe binarity is real. We also search for the light-time effect in other known\neclipsing Cepheids and we clearly detect it in OGLE-LMC-CEP-1812. We discuss\napplication of this tool for the search for Cepheids in non-eclipsing binary\nsystems.\n", "  A rare combination of strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron\ncorrelations makes the iridate Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ a promising host\nfor novel electronic phases of matter. The resemblance of its crystallographic,\nmagnetic and electronic structures to La$_2$CuO$_4$, as well as the emergence\nupon doping of a pseudogap region and a low temperature $d$-wave gap, has\nparticularly strengthened analogies to cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors.\nHowever, unlike the cuprate phase diagram that features a plethora of broken\nsymmetry phases in a pseudogap region that include charge density wave, stripe,\nnematic and possibly intra-unit cell loop-current orders, no broken symmetry\nphases proximate to the parent antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase in\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$ have been observed to date, making the comparison of iridate to\ncuprate phenomenology incomplete. Using optical second harmonic generation, we\nreport evidence of a hidden non-dipolar magnetic order in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ that\nbreaks both the spatial inversion and rotational symmetries of the underlying\ntetragonal lattice. Four distinct domain types corresponding to discrete\n90$^{\\circ}$ rotated orientations of a pseudovector order parameter are\nidentified using nonlinear optical microscopy, which is expected from an\nelectronic phase that possesses the symmetries of a magneto-electric\nloop-current order. The onset temperature of this phase is monotonically\nsuppressed with bulk hole doping, albeit much more weakly than the N\\'eel\ntemperature, revealing an extended region of the phase diagram with purely\nhidden order. Driving this hidden phase to its quantum critical point may be a\npath to realizing superconductivity in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.\n", "  In this paper we study the scaling of the correction of the Renyi entropy of\nthe excited states in systems described, in the continuum limit, by a conformal\nfield theory (CFT). These corrections scale as $L^{-\\frac{2\\Delta}{n}}$, where\n$L$ is the system size and $\\Delta$ is the scaling dimension of a relevant bulk\noperator located around the singularities of the Riemann surface\n$\\mathcal{R}_n$. Their name is due to their explicit dependence on the Riemann\nsurface $\\mathcal{R}_n$. Their presence has been detected in several works on\nthe entanglement entropy in finite size systems, both in the ground and the\nexcited states. Here, we present a general study of these corrections based on\nthe perturbation expansion on $\\mathcal{R}_n$. Some of the terms in this\nexpansion are divergent and they will be cured with addition cut-offs. These\ncut-offs will determine how these corrections scale with the system size $L$.\nExact numerical computations of the Renyi entropy of the excited states of the\nXX model are provided and they confirm our theoretical prediction on the\nscaling of corrections. They allow also a comparison with the other works\npresent in the literature finding that the corrections, for the excited states,\nhave the exact same form of the ones of the ground state case multiplied by a\nmodel dependend function of $n$ and $l/L$.\n", "  This thesis sums up the research work I performed as a PhD student in\nSapienza Universit\\`a di Roma, and \\'Ecole Normale Sup\\'erieure, Paris, under\nthe joint supervision of Prof. Giorgio Parisi and Dr. Francesco Zamponi. The\nthesis focuses on the theoretical study of metastable glasses prepared through\nnon-equilibrium protocols. The first two chapters contain a review of the\nphenomenology of equilibrium supercooled liquids and non-equilibrium glasses,\nalong with an exposition of the theoretical tools used up to now to approach\nthe glass problem; the third chapter contains a review of the theoretical tools\nwhich are employed in the following of the thesis; the following two chapters\ncontain our main result, namely a mean-field and first-principles theory of\nmetastable glassy states which, as we show, is both able to reproduce known\nobservations and to formulate new predictions and insights into the very nature\nof the glass phase, with tangible consequences in terms of behavior at high\ndensities (or equivalently, low temperatures) and elasto-plastic response under\nstrain; the last two chapters contain a numerical check of some of the results,\nand our conclusions and proposals for further research. The results I report in\nthe present work have been for the most part already published, but here they\nare presented in a consistent and (as much as possible) self-contained manner.\n", "  Within the framework of density functional theory, we present a study of\napproximations to the enhancement factor of the non-interacting kinetic energy\nfunctional $T_s[\\rho]$. For this purpose, we employ the model of Liu and Parr\n[S. Liu and R.G. Parr, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 55}, 1792 (1997)] based on a series\nexpansion of $T_s[\\rho]$ involving powers of the density. Applications to 34\natoms, at the Hartree-Fock level showed that the enhancement factors present\npeaks that are in excellent agreement with those of the exact ones and give an\naccurate description of the shell structure of these atoms. The application of\nZ-dependent expansions to represent some of the terms of these approximation\nfor neutral atoms and for positive and negative ions, which allows $T_s[\\rho]$\nto be cast in a very simple form, is also explored. Indications are given as to\nhow these functionals may be applied to molecules and clusters\n", "  Zeros of two-dimensional sums of the Epstein zeta type over rectangular\nlattices of the type investigated by Hejhal and Bombieri in 1987 are\nconsidered, and in particular a sum first studied by Potter and Titchmarsh in\n1935. These latter proved several properties of the zeros of sums over the\nrectangular lattice, and commented on the fact that a particular sum had zeros\noff the critical line. The behaviour of one such zero is investigated as a\nfunction of the ratio of the periods $\\lambda$ of the rectangular lattice, and\nit is shown that it evolves continuously along a trajectory which approaches\nthe critical line, reaching it at a point which is a second-order zero of the\nrectangular lattice sum. It is further shown that ranges of the period ratio\n$\\lambda$ can be so identified for which zeros of the rectangular lattice sum\nlie off the critical line.\n", "  We present an update of our analysis of statistical and systematic errors in\nthe calculation of iso-vector scalar, axial and tensor charges of the nucleon.\nThe calculations are done using $N_f=2+1+1$ flavor HISQ ensembles generated by\nthe MILC Collaboration at three values of the lattice spacing ($a=0.12,\\ 0.09,$\nand $0.06$ fm) and three values of the quark mass ($M_\\pi \\approx 310,\\ 220$\nand $130$ MeV); and clover fermions for calculating the correlation functions,\ni.e., we use a clover-on-HISQ lattice formulation. The all-mode-averaging\nmethod allows us to increase the statistics by a factor of eight for the same\ncomputational cost leading to a better understanding of and control over\nexcited state contamination. Our current results, after extrapolation to the\ncontinuum limit and physical pion mass are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.21(3)$, $g_T^{u-d} =\n1.005(59)$ and $g_S^{u-d} = 0.95(12) $. Further checks of control over all\nsystematic errors, especially in $g_A^{u-d}$, are still being performed. Using\nresults for the flavor-diagonal charges, $g_T^{u} $, $g_T^{d} $ and $g_T^{s}$,\nwe analyze contributions of the quark electric dipole moment to the neutron EDM\nand the consequences for split SUSY model.\n", "  Quantum information technologies harness the intrinsic nature of quantum\ntheory to beat the limitations of the classical methods for information\nprocessing and communication. Recently, the application of quantum features to\nmetrology has attracted much attention. Quantum optical coherence tomography\n(QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs,\nis a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence\ntomography (OCT): As the resolution of OCT becomes higher, degradation of the\nresolution due to dispersion within the medium becomes more critical. Here we\nreport on the realization of 0.54 $\\mu$m resolution two-photon interference,\nwhich surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $\\mu$m of low-coherence\ninterference for OCT. In addition, the resolution for QOCT showed almost no\nchange against the dispersion of a 1 mm thickness of water inserted in the\noptical path, whereas the resolution for OCT dramatically degrades. For this\nexperiment, a highly-efficient chirped quasi-phase-matched lithium tantalate\ndevice was developed using a novel $`$nano-electrode-poling$'$ technique. The\nresults presented here represent a breakthrough for the realization of quantum\nprotocols, including QOCT, quantum clock synchronization, and more. Our work\nwill open up possibilities for medical and biological applications.\n", "  We consider constraint satisfaction problems of bounded degree, with a good\nnotion of \"typicality\", e.g. the negation of the variables in each constraint\nis taken independently at random. Using the quantum approximate optimization\nalgorithm (QAOA), we show that $ \\mu+\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{D}) $ fraction of the\nconstraints can be satisfied for typical instances, with the assignment\nefficiently produced by QAOA. We do so by showing that the averaged fraction of\nconstraints being satisfied is $ \\mu+\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{D}) $, with small variance.\nHere $ \\mu $ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly random\nassignment, and $ D $ is the number of constraints that each variable can\nappear. CSPs with typicality include Max-$ k $XOR and Max-$ k $SAT. We point\nout how it can be applied to determine the typical ground-state energy of some\nlocal Hamiltonians. We also give a similar result for instances with \"no\noverlapping constraints\", using the quantum algorithm. We sketch how the\nclassical algorithm might achieve some partial result.\n", "  We report the results of a volume-limited survey using the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array to search for transient and quiescent radio emission\nfrom 15 southern hemisphere ultracool dwarfs. We detect radio emission from\n2MASSW J0004348-404405 increasing the number of radio loud ultracool dwarfs to\n22. We also observe radio emission from 2MASS J10481463-3956062 and 2MASSI\nJ0339352-352544, two sources with previous radio detections. The radio emission\nfrom the three detected sources shows no variability or flare emission.\nModelling this quiescent emission we find that it is consistent with optically\nthin gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetosphere with an emitting region\nradius of (1 - 2)$R_*$, magnetic field inclination 20$^{\\circ}$ - 80$^{\\circ}$,\nfield strength $\\sim$10 - 200 G, and power-law electron density $\\sim$10$^4$ -\n10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on four ultracool dwarfs\nwith no previous radio observations. This increases the number of ultracool\ndwarfs studied at radio frequencies to 222. Analysing general trends of the\nradio emission for this sample of 15 sources, we find that the radio activity\nincreases for later spectral types and more rapidly rotating objects.\nFurthermore, comparing the ratio of the radio to X-ray luminosities for these\nsources, we find 2MASS J10481463-3956062 and 2MASSI J0339352-352544 violate the\nGuedel-Benz relation by more than two orders of magnitude.\n", "  The Joint Physics Analysis Center is a collaboration between theorists and\nexperimentalists working in hadronic physics. In order to facilitate the\nexchange of information between the different actors in hadron spectroscopy, we\ncreated an interactive website. In this note, I summarize the first projects\navailable on the website.\n", "  The segregation of solute atoms to grain boundaries can have a large\ninfluence on the mechanical behavior of polycrystals, particularly in metallic\nalloys. An overview of 400 calculations of solute-induced changes in grain\nboundary cohesion from 77 separate studies quantitatively demonstrates that the\nmajority of the variation in solute-induced changes in boundary cohesion is\nexplained by simple bond-breaking arguments. This trend is robust to changes in\ncrystal structure and computational methods. The secondary contributions to\nembrittlement from other mechanisms, such as atomic size effects and charge\ntransfer, are quantified and discussed as well.\n", "  The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope-Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset\n(WFIRST-AFTA) mission is a 2.4-m class space telescope that will be used across\na swath of astrophysical research domains. JPL will provide a high-contrast\nimaging coronagraph instrument - one of two major astronomical instruments. In\norder to achieve the low noise performance required to detect planets under\nextremely low flux conditions, the electron multiplying charge-coupled device\n(EMCCD) has been baselined for both of the coronagraph's sensors - the imaging\ncamera and integral field spectrograph. JPL has established an EMCCD test\nlaboratory in order to advance EMCCD maturity to technology readiness level-6.\nThis plan incorporates full sensor characterization, including read noise, dark\ncurrent, and clock-induced charge. In addition, by considering the unique\nchallenges of the WFIRST space environment, degradation to the sensor's charge\ntransfer efficiency will be assessed, as a result of damage from high-energy\nparticles such as protons, electrons, and cosmic rays. Science-grade CCD201-20\nEMCCDs have been irradiated to a proton fluence that reflects the projected\nWFIRST orbit. Performance degradation due to radiation displacement damage is\nreported, which is the first such study for a CCD201-20 that replicates the\nWFIRST conditions. In addition, techniques intended to identify and mitigate\nradiation-induced electron trapping, such as trap pumping, custom clocking, and\nthermal cycling, are discussed.\n", "  Elegant 'microlocal' methods have long since been extensively developed for\nthe analysis of conventional Schroedinger eigenvalue problems. For technical\nreasons though these methods have not heretofore been applicable to quantum\nfield theories. In this article however we initiate a 'Euclidean signature\nsemi-classical' program to extend the scope of these analytical techniques to\nencompass the study of self-interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1, 2 + 1 and 3 + 1\ndimensions. The basic microlocal approach entails, first of all, the solution\nof a single, nonlinear equation of Hamilton-Jacobi type followed by the\nintegration (for both ground and excited states) of a sequence of linear\n'transport' equations along the 'flow' generated by the 'fundamental solution'\nto the aforementioned Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using a combination of the\ndirect method of the calculus of variations, elliptic regularity theory and the\nBanach space version of the implicit function theorem we establish, in a\nsuitable function space setting, the existence, uniqueness and global\nregularity of this needed 'fundamental solution' to the relevant, Euclidean\nsignature Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the systems under study. Our methods are\napplicable to (massive) scalar fields with polynomial self-interactions of\nrenormalizable type. They can, as we shall show elsewhere, also be applied to\nYang-Mills fields in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions.\n", "  The photoluminescence properties of Yb doped Y2O3 nanoparticles are\ninvestigated in visible region. The presence of peaks at 335 nm and 370 nm in\nthe excitation spectra of bulk as well as in nano Yb: Y2O3 and their absence in\npure Y2O3 confirm its origin due to Yb3+ dopant. The Yb doping in nano Y2O3 not\nonly modify the charge transfer bands (CTB) but also helps in transition of\nelectron from these CTBs to ground 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 levels of Yb. This results\nin strong intense broad emission from ~400 to ~650 nm (white light emission\nrange) for 335 nm excitation.\n", "  Cathodoluminescence (CL) experiments at low temperature have been undertaken\non various bulk and exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) samples. Different\nbulk crystals grown from different synthesis methods have been studied. All of\nthem present the same so-called S series in the 5.6--6 eV range, proving its\nintrinsic character. Luminescence spectra of flakes containing 100 down to 6\nlayers have been recorded. Strong modifications in the same UV range are\nobserved and discussed within the general framework of 2D exciton properties in\nlamellar crystals.\n", "  We study the structural and magnetic properties of\nLa$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$O$_3$ ($0 \\leq x \\leq 1$). Rietveld\nrefinement of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern suggests phase purity of the\npolycrystalline samples with R$\\bar{3}$c space group. Interplay of\nFerromagnetic (FM) and Antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction upon Co substitution\nat Mn site in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ is evident from magnetic\nmeasurements. There is an optimal cobalt substitution at which the coercive\nfield is maximum.\n", "  The single-layer perovskite cobaltates have attracted enormous attention due\nto the recent observation of hour-glass shaped magnetic excitation spectra\nwhich resemble the ones of the famous high-temperature superconducting\ncuprates. Here, we present an overview of our most recent studies of the spin\nand charge correlations in floating-zone grown cobaltate single crystals. We\nfind that frustration and a novel kind of electronic and magnetic nano phase\nseparation are intimately connected to the appearance of the hour-glass shaped\nspin excitation spectra. We also point out the difference between nano phase\nseparation and conventional phase separation.\n", "  We present the theory, algorithms and implementation of a parallel\nfinite-volume algorithm for the solution of the incompressible\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using unstructured grids that are\napplicable for a wide variety of geometries. Our method implements a mixed\nAdams-Bashforth/Crank-Nicolson scheme for the nonlinear terms in the MHD\nequations and we prove that it is stable independent of the time step. To\nensure that the solenoidal condition is met for the magnetic field, we use a\nmethod whereby a pseudo-pressure is introduced into the induction equation;\nsince we are concerned with incompressible flows, the resulting Poisson\nequation for the pseudo-pressure is solved alongside the equivalent Poisson\nproblem for the velocity field. We validate our code in a variety of geometries\nincluding periodic boxes, spheres, spherical shells, spheroids and ellipsoids;\nfor the finite geometries we implement the so-called ferromagnetic or\npseudo-vacuum boundary conditions appropriate for a surrounding medium with\ninfinite magnetic permeability. This implies that the magnetic field must be\npurely perpendicular to the boundary. We present a number of comparisons\nagainst previous results and against analytical solutions, which verify the\ncode's accuracy. This documents the code's reliability as a prelude to its use\nin more difficult problems. We finally present a new simple drifting solution\nfor thermal convection in a spherical shell that successfully sustains a\nmagnetic field of simple geometry. By dint of its rapid stabilization from the\ngiven initial conditions, we deem it suitable as a benchmark against which\nother self-consistent dynamo codes can be tested.\n", "  This is an introduction to the theory of one-dimensional disordered systems\nand products of random matrices, confined to the 2 by 2 case. The notion of\nimpurity model--- that is, a system in which the interactions are highly\nlocalised--- links the two themes and enables their study by elementary\nmathematical tools. After discussing the spectral theory of some impurity\nmodels, we state and illustrate Furstenberg's theorem, which gives sufficient\nconditions for the exponential growth of a product of independent,\nidentically-distributed matrices.\n", "  We investigate the optical beam behavior in the periodical array of the\ncoupled optical waveguides with the monotonic change of the refractive index in\nthe transverse direction. We consider the dependence of the form of the optical\nbeam on the boundary conditions. It is well known that if the input wave packet\nis wide enough, the optical Bloch oscillations occur, while for the enough\nnarrow input wave packet the breathing mode is observed. We show that if the\ninput wave packet is neither too wide nor too narrow, the optical beam takes a\npeculiar form which can be considered neither as the Bloch oscillations nor as\nthe breathing mode. We qualitatively explain the transformation of this\nintermediate form of the optical beam when the width of the input wave packet\nchanges.\n", "  Large holes in graphene membranes were recently shown to heal, either at room\ntemperature during a low energy STEM experiment, or by annealing at high\ntemperatures. However, the details of the healing mechanism remain unclear. We\ncarried out fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations in order to\naddress these mechanisms under different experimental conditions. Our results\nshow that, if a carbon atom source is present, high temperatures can provide\nenough energy for the carbon atoms to overcome the potential energy barrier and\nto produce perfect reconstruction of the graphene hexagonal structure. At room\ntemperature, this perfect healing is only possible if the heat effects of the\nelectron beam from STEM experiment are explicitly taken into account. The\nreconstruction process of a perfect or near perfect graphene structure involves\nthe formation of linear carbon chains, as well as rings containing 5, 6, 7 and\n8 atoms with planar (Stone-Wales) and non-planar (lump like) structures. These\nresults shed light on the healing mechanism of graphene when subjected to\ndifferent experimental conditions. Additionally, the methodology presented here\ncan be useful for investigating the tailoring and manipulations of other\nnano-structures.\n", "  We present algorithms to solve coupled systems of linear differential\nequations, arising in the calculation of massive Feynman diagrams with local\noperator insertions at 3-loop order, which do {\\it not} request special choices\nof bases. Here we assume that the desired solution has a power series\nrepresentation and we seek for the coefficients in closed form. In particular,\nif the coefficients depend on a small parameter $\\ep$ (the dimensional\nparameter), we assume that the coefficients themselves can be expanded in\nformal Laurent series w.r.t.\\ $\\ep$ and we try to compute the first terms in\nclosed form. More precisely, we have a decision algorithm which solves the\nfollowing problem: if the terms can be represented by an indefinite nested\nhypergeometric sum expression (covering as special cases the harmonic sums,\ncyclotomic sums, generalized harmonic sums or nested binomial sums), then we\ncan calculate them. If the algorithm fails, we obtain a proof that the terms\ncannot be represented by the class of indefinite nested hypergeometric sum\nexpressions. Internally, this problem is reduced by holonomic closure\nproperties to solving a coupled system of linear difference equations. The\nunderlying method in this setting relies on decoupling algorithms, difference\nring algorithms and recurrence solving. We demonstrate by a concrete example\nhow this algorithm can be applied with the new Mathematica package\n\\texttt{SolveCoupledSystem} which is based on the packages \\texttt{Sigma},\n\\texttt{HarmonicSums} and \\texttt{OreSys}. In all applications the\nrepresentation in $x$-space is obtained as an iterated integral representation\nover general alphabets, generalizing Poincar\\'{e} iterated integrals.\n", "  This paper deals with an analytical modeling of heat transfers simulating a\nnew radiation calorimeter operating in a temperature range from -50 {\\deg}C to\n150 {\\deg}C. The aim of this modeling is the evaluation of the feasibility and\nperformance of the calorimeter by assessing the measurement of power losses of\nsome electrical devices by radiation, the influence of the geometry and\nmaterials. Finally a theoretical sensibility of the new apparatus is estimated\nat ~1 mW. From these results the calorimeter has been successfully implemented\nand patented.\n", "  To elucidate the atomistic diffusion mechanism responsible for the rapid\ndiffusion in alkali halide nano particles, called Spontaneous Mixing, we\nexecute molecular dynamics simulations with empirical models for KCl-KBr,\nNaCl-NaBr, RbCl-RbBr and KBr-KI. We successfully reproduce essential features\nof the rapid diffusion phenomenon. It is numerically confirmed that the rate of\nthe diffusion clearly depends on the size and temperature of the clusters,\nwhich is consistent with experiments. A quite conspicuous feature is that the\nsurface melting and collective motions of ions are inhibited in alkali halide\nclusters. This result indicates that the Surface Peeling Mechanism, which is\nresponsible for the spontaneous alloying of binary metals, does not play a\ndominant role for the spontaneous mixing in alkali halide nanoclusters.\nDetailed analysis of atomic motion inside the clusters reveals that the Vacancy\nMechanism is the most important mechanism for the rapid diffusion in alkali\nhalide clusters. This is also confirmed by evaluation of the vacancy formation\nenergy: the formation energy notably decreases with the cluster size, which\nmakes vacancy formation easier and diffusion more rapid in small alkali halide\nclusters.\n", "  Mixtures of micelle-forming and lamella-forming amphiphiles in solution can\nform disk-shaped bilayers, sometimes referred to as bicelles. Using\nself-consistent field theory (SCFT), we investigate the structure and stability\nof these aggregates in a blend of two species of PS-PDMS diblock with PDMS\nhomopolymer at 225C. We find that the center of each disk is mainly composed of\nlamella-forming diblocks, while its thicker rim is mostly formed of\nmicelle-forming diblocks. However, this segregation is not perfect, and the\nconcentration of micelle formers is of the order of 10% on the flat central\nsurface of the bicelle. We also find that the addition of micelle former to the\nmixture of lamella former and homopolymer is necessary for disk-like bicelles\nto be stable. Specifically, the free energy density of the disk has a minimum\nas a function of the disk radius when both micelle- and lamella-forming\ndiblocks are present, indicating that the bicelles have a preferred, finite\nradius. However, it decays monotonically when only lamella former is present,\nindicating that the bicelle structure is always unstable with respect to\nfurther aggregation in these systems. Finally, we identify a concentration\nrange where the bicelle is predicted to have a lower free energy density than\nthe simple cylindrical and lamellar aggregates, and so might be\nthermodynamically stable.\n", "  The recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed many details of\nsignal propagation in nervous systems. In this paper an attempt is made to\nunify various mathematical models which describe the signal propagation in\nnerve fibres. The analysis of existing single models permits to select the\nleading physiological effects. As a result, a more general mathematical model\nis described based on the coupling of action potentials with mechanical waves\nin a nerve fibre. The crucial issue is how to model coupling effects which are\nstrongly linked to the ion currents through biomembranes.\n", "  With the help of a simple rate equation model, we analyze the intrinsic\ndynamics of threshold crossing for Class B lasers. A thorough discussion of the\ncharacteristics and the limitations of this very commonly employed model, which\nprovides excellent qualitative predictions on the laser behaviour, is offered.\nApproximate solutions for the population inversion and for the field intensity,\nup to the point where the latter reaches macroscopic levels, are found and\ndiscussed, together with the associated characteristic times. Numerical\nverifications test the accuracy of these solutions and confirm their validity.\nA discussion of the implications on threshold dynamics is presented, together\nwith the motivation for focussing on this -- nowadays most common -- class of\nlasers.\n", "  We investigate the formation and evolution of Au-CO single-molecule break\njunctions. The conductance histogram exhibits two distinct molecular\nconfigurations, which are further investigated by a combined statistical\nanalysis. According to conditional histogram and correlation analysis these\nmolecular configurations show strong anticorrelations with each other and with\npure Au monoatomic junctions and atomic chains. We identify molecular precursor\nconfigurations with somewhat higher conductance which are formed prior to\nsingle-molecule junctions. According to detailed length analysis two distinct\ntypes of molecule-affected chain formation processes are observed, and we\ncompare these results to former theoretical calculations considering bridge and\natop type molecular configurations where the latter has reduced conductance due\nto destructive Fano interference.\n", "  One of the basic assumptions in organic field-effect transistors, the most\nfundamental device unit in organic electronics, is that charge transport occurs\ntwo-dimensionally in the first few molecular layers near the dielectric\ninterface. Although the mobility of bulk organic semiconductors has increased\ndramatically, direct probing of intrinsic charge transport in the\ntwo-dimensional limit has not been possible due to excessive disorders and\ntraps in ultrathin organic thin films. Here, highly ordered mono- to\ntetra-layer pentacene crystals are realized by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy on\nhexagonal BN. We find that the charge transport is dominated by hopping in the\nfirst conductive layer, but transforms to band-like in subsequent layers. Such\nabrupt phase transition is attributed to strong modulation of the molecular\npacking by interfacial vdW interactions, as corroborated by quantitative\nstructural characterization and density functional theory calculations. The\nstructural modulation becomes negligible beyond the second conductive layer,\nleading to a mobility saturation thickness of only ~3nm. Highly ordered organic\nultrathin films provide a platform for new physics and device structures (such\nas heterostructures and quantum wells) that are not possible in conventional\nbulk crystals.\n", "  The general framework of entropic dynamics is used to formulate a relational\nquantum dynamics. The main new idea is to use tools of information geometry to\ndevelop an entropic measure of the mismatch between successive configurations\nof a system. This leads to an entropic version of the classical best matching\ntechnique developed by J. Barbour and collaborators. The procedure is\nillustrated in the simple case of a system of N particles with global\ntranslational symmetry. The generalization to other symmetries whether global\n(rotational invariance) or local (gauge invariance) is straightforward. The\nentropic best matching allows a quantum implementation Mach's principles of\nspatial and temporal relationalism and provides the foundation for a method of\nhandling gauge theories in an informational framework.\n", "  Some simple expectations for the quark mass dependence of radial excitation\nenergies of heavy-light hadrons based on consideration of nonrelativistic\nquantum mechanics are discussed. Experimental and theoretical results are\nreviewed in light of these expectations. Some new lattice QCD results for\nmasses of Lambda_b and Sigma_b baryons are presented.\n", "  The ability of detecting and separating CTCs can play a key role in early\ncancer detection and treatment. In recent years, there has been growing\ninterest in using deformability-based CTC separation microfilters due to their\nsimplicity and low cost. Most of previous studies in this area are mainly based\non experimental work. Although experimental research provides useful insights\nin designing CTC separation devices, there is still a lack of design guidelines\nbased on fundamental understandings of the cell separation process in the\nfilers. While experimental efforts face challenges especially microfabrication\ndifficulties, we adopt numerical simulation here to study conical-shaped\nmicrofilters using deformability difference between CTCs and blood cells for\nseparation process. We use liquid drop model for modeling a CTC passing through\nsuch microfilters. The accuracy of the model in predicting the pressure\nsignature of the system is validated by comparing with previous experiments.\nPressure-deformability analysis of the cell going through the channel is then\ncarried out in detail in order to better understand how a CTC behaves\nthroughout the filtration process. Different system design criteria such as\nsystem throughput and unclogging of the system are discussed. Specifically,\npressure behavior under different system throughput is analyzed. Regarding the\nunclogging issue, we define pressure ratio as a key parameter representing the\nability to overcome clogging in such CTC separation devices and investigate the\neffect of conical angle on the optimum pressure ratio. Finally, the effect of\nunclogging applied pressure on the system performance is examined. Our study\nprovides detailed understandings of the cell separation process and its\ncharacteristics, which can be used for developing more efficient CTC separation\ndevices.\n", "  Deformation based circulating tumor cell (CTC) microchips are a\nrepresentative diagnostic device for early cancer detection. This type of\ndevice usually involves a process of CTC trapping in a confined microgeometry.\nFurther understanding of the CTC flow regime, as well as the threshold\npassing-through pressure is key to the design of deformation based CTC\nfiltration devices. In the present numerical study, we investigate the\ntransitional deformation and pressure signature from surface tension dominated\nflow to viscous shear stress dominated flow using a droplet model. Regarding\nwhether CTC fully blocks the channel inlet, we observe two flow regimes: CTC\nsqueezing and shearing regime. By studying the relation of CTC deformation at\nthe exact critical pressure point for increasing inlet velocity, three\ndifferent types of cell deformation are observed: 1) hemispherical front, 2)\nparabolic front, and 3) elongated CTC co-flowing with carrier media. Focusing\non the circular channel, we observe a first increasing and then decreasing\ncritical pressure change with increasing flow rate. By pressure analysis, the\nconcept of optimum velocity is proposed to explain the behavior of CTC\nfiltration and design optimization of CTC filter. Similar behavior is also\nobserved in channels with symmetrical cross sessions like square and triangular\nbut not in rectangular channels which only results in decreasing critical\npressure.\n", "  Methods for quantifying mixing in microfluidics have varied largely in the\npast, and various indices have been employed to represent the extent of mixing.\nMixing between two or more colored liquids is usually quantified using simple\nmathematical functions operated over a sequence of images. The function,\nusually termed mixing indices, involves a measure of standard deviation. Here,\nwe first review some mixing indices and then experimentally verify the index\nmost representative of a mixing event. It is observed that the relative mixing\nindex is not affected by the lighting conditions, unlike other known mixing\nindices. Based on this finding, the use of a relative mixing index is advocated\nfor further use in the lab-on-a-chip community for quantifying mixing events.\n", "  Evolving multiplex networks are a powerful model for representing the\ndynamics along time of different phenomena, such as social networks, power\ngrids, biological pathways. However, exploring the structure of the multiplex\nnetwork time series is still an open problem. Here we propose a two-steps\nstrategy to tackle this problem based on the concept of distance (metric)\nbetween networks. Given a multiplex graph, first a network of networks is built\nfor each time steps, and then a real valued time series is obtained by the\nsequence of (simple) networks by evaluating the distance from the first element\nof the series. The effectiveness of this approach in detecting the occurring\nchanges along the original time series is shown on a synthetic example first,\nand then on the Gulf dataset of political events.\n", "  In this paper we endeavour to find a connection between the non-commutative\nnature of space time and the {\\it zero point field}. We observe that extra\neffects come into play when we take into account the Compton scale effects in\nsuch a space-time and the electromagnetic field tensor and the current density\nget modified. This defines an underlying connection between non-commutativity\nand the {\\it zero point field}.\n", "  Patent data represent a significant source of information on innovation and\nthe evolution of technology through networks of citations, co-invention and\nco-assignment of new patents. A major obstacle to extracting useful information\nfrom this data is the problem of name disambiguation: linking alternate\nspellings of individuals or institutions to a single identifier to uniquely\ndetermine the parties involved in the creation of a technology. In this paper,\nwe describe a new algorithm that uses high-resolution geolocation to\ndisambiguate both inventor and assignees on more than 3.6 million patents found\nin the European Patent Office (EPO), under the Patent Cooperation treaty (PCT),\nand in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We show that our algorithm\nhas both high precision and recall in comparison to a manual disambiguation of\nEPO assignee names in Boston and Paris, and show it performs well for a\nbenchmark of USPTO inventor names that can be linked to a high-resolution\naddress (but poorly for inventors that never provided a high quality address).\nThe most significant benefit of this work is the high quality assignee\ndisambiguation with worldwide coverage coupled with an inventor disambiguation\nthat is competitive with other state of the art approaches. To our knowledge\nthis is the broadest and most accurate simultaneous disambiguation and\ncross-linking of the inventor and assignee names for a significant fraction of\npatents in these three major patent collections.\n", "  We study the complexity of QMA proof systems with inverse exponentially small\npromise gap. We show that this class can be exactly characterized by PSPACE,\nthe class of problems solvable with a polynomial amount of memory. As\napplications we show that a \"precise\" version of the Local Hamiltonian problem\nis PSPACE-complete, and give a provable setting in which the ability to prepare\nPEPS states is not as powerful as the ability to prepare the ground state of\ngeneral Local Hamiltonians.\n", "  In this letter, we aim to elucidate the physical mechanism of the so called\noptical memory effect and blinking phenomenon observed in InGaN single quantum\nwells (SQW). We have found that the optical response of both memory effect and\nblinking phenomenon, is affected by different excitation wavelengths and by the\nchange of gas adsorption on the crystal surface. A model that reproduce\ndynamics of the coverage of absorbed gas molecules on the sample surface is\ngiven and compared with experimental data with evident match.\n", "  Controlling, detecting and generating propagating plasmons by all-electrical\nmeans is at the heart of on-chip nano-optical processing. Graphene carries\nlong-lived plasmons that are extremely confined and controllable by\nelectrostatic fields, however electrical detection of propagating plasmons in\ngraphene has not yet been realized. Here, we present an all-graphene\nmid-infrared plasmon detector, where a single graphene sheet serves\nsimultaneously as the plasmonic medium and detector. Rather than achieving\ndetection via added optoelectronic materials, as is typically done in other\nplasmonic systems, our device converts the natural decay product of the\nplasmon---electronic heat---directly into a voltage through the thermoelectric\neffect. We employ two local gates to fully tune the thermoelectric and\nplasmonic behaviour of the graphene. High-resolution real-space photocurrent\nmaps are used to investigate the plasmon propagation and interference, decay,\nthermal diffusion, and thermoelectric generation.\n", "  A Compton gamma imager has been developed for use in consequence management\noperations and in security investigations. The imager uses solid inorganic\nscintillator, known for robust performance in field survey conditions. The\ndesign was constrained in overall size by the requirement that it be person\ntransportable and operable from a variety of platforms. In order to introduce\nminimal dead material in the path of the incoming and scattered gamma rays,\ncustom silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), with a thin glass substrate, were used\nto collect the scintillation light from the scatter layers. To move them out of\nthe path of the gamma rays, preamplification electronics for the silicon\nphotomultipliers were located a distance from the imager. This imager, the\nSilicon photomultiplier Compton Telescope for Safety and Security (SCoTSS) is\nable to provide a one-degree image resolution in a plus-minus 45 degree field\nof view for a 10 mCi point source 40 m distant, within about one minute, for\ngamma-ray energies ranging from 344 keV to 1274 keV. Here, we present a\ncomprehensive performance study of the SCoTSS imager.\n", "  The relation between time series irreversibility and entropy production has\nbeen recently investigated in thermodynamic systems operating away from\nequilibrium. In this work we explore this concept in the context of financial\ntime series. We make use of visibility algorithms to quantify in\ngraph-theoretical terms time irreversibility of 35 financial indices evolving\nover the period 1998-2012. We show that this metric is complementary to\nstandard measures based on volatility and exploit it to both classify periods\nof financial stress and to rank companies accordingly. We then validate this\napproach by finding that a projection in principal components space of\nfinancial years based on time irreversibility features clusters together\nperiods of financial stress from stable periods. Relations between\nirreversibility, efficiency and predictability are briefly discussed.\n", "  The necessary and sufficient condition for the piezoresistance coefficient\nextraction and conditioning of the extraction problem are considered as a\nproblem of the certain matrix A. This matrix is implied by the stress\ndistribution on the certain test structure. For the given test structure matrix\nA was calculated and the condition number was estimated. Obtained value of\ncondition number shows that proposed test structure gives well-conditioned\nmatrix A. Both the geometrical analysis and numerical estimation of condition\nnumber shows that the problem of extraction is well-conditioned and the test\nstructure is properly designed. For the given condition number the error\npropagation of the input data was considered. For assumed levels of the input\ndata errors, the relative error of piezoresistance coefficient is less than 8%.\n", "  This article consisted of an elementary introduction to deformation theory of\nvarieties, schemes and manifolds, with some applications to local and global\nshtukas and fever to Newton polygons of $p$-divisible groups . Soft problems\nand results mainly are considered. In the framework we give review of some\nnovel results in the theory of local shtukas, Anderson-modules, global shtukas,\nNewton polygons of $p$-divisible groups and on deformations of $p$-divisible\ngroups with given Newton polygons.\n", "  Monte carlo simulation of paths of a large number of impinging electrons in a\nmulti-layered solid allows to define area of spreading electrons (A) to capture\noverall behavior of the solid. This parameter 'A' follows power law with\nelectron energy. Further, change in critical energies, which are minimum\nenergies lost corresponding to various electrons, as a function of variation in\nlateral distance also follows power law nature. This power law behavior could\nbe an indicator of how strong self-organization a solid has which may be used\nin monitoring efficiency of device fabrication.\n", "  We report detailed dc magnetization, linear and non-linear ac susceptibility\nmeasurements on the hole doped disordered cobaltite\nLa$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$. Our results show that the magnetically ordered\nstate of the system consists of coexisting non-ferromagnetic phases along with\npercolating ferromagnetic-clusters. The percolating ferromagnetic-clusters\npossibly start a magnetic ordering at the Curie temperature of 201.5(5)~K. The\nnon-ferromagnetic phases mainly consist of antiferromagnetic-clusters with size\nsmaller than the ferromagnetic-clusters. Below Curie temperature the system\nexhibits an irreversibility in the field cooled and zero field cooled\nmagnetization and frequency dependence in the peak of ac susceptibility. These\ndynamical features indicate towards the possible coexistence of spin-glass\nphase along with ferromagnetic-clusters similar to La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO$_3$\n(x$\\geq$0.18), but the absence of field divergence in third harmonic of ac\nsusceptibility and zero field cooled memory clearly rule out any such\npossibility. We argue that the spin-glass phase in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO$_3$\n(x$\\geq$0.18) is associated with the presence of incommensurate\nantiferromagnetic ordering in non-ferromagnetic phases which is absent in\nLa$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$. Our analysis show that the observed dynamical\nfeatures in La$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ are possibly due to progressive thermal\nblocking of ferromagnetic-clusters which is further confirmed by the\nWohlfarth's model of superparamagnetism. The frequency dependence of the peak\nof ac susceptibility obeys the Vogel-Fulcher law with $\\tau_0\\approx10^{-9}$s.\nThis together with the existence of an AT line in H-T space indicates the\npresence of significant inter-cluster interaction among these\nferromagnetic-clusters.\n", "  The extension of piezoresistance coefficient extraction method was proposed,\nfor protection from errors in estimation of the thickness of the test structure\nmembrane. This new approach requires finding models of elements of matrix of\nintegrated stresses as functions of the membrane thickness. Additionally, two\ntest structures with different thickness of the membrane have to be used. This\nimproved method gives the more credible estimation of piezoresistance\ncoefficients $\\pi_L$ and $\\pi_T$ and the thickness of the membranes of the used\ntest structures.\n", "  We report the magnetization study of the compound\nLa$_{0.75}$Ba$_{0.25}$CoO$_3$ where Ba$^{2+}$ doping is just above the critical\nlimit for percolation of ferromagnetic clusters. The field cooled (FC) and zero\nfield cooled (ZFC) magnetization exhibit a thermomagnetic irreversibility and\nthe ac susceptibility show a frequency dependent peak at the ferromagnetic\nordering temperature (T$_C$$\\approx$203~K) of the clusters. These features\nindicate about the presence of a non-equilibrium state below T$_C$. In the\nnon-equilibrium state, the dynamic scaling of the imaginary part of ac\nsusceptibility and the static scaling of the nonlinear susceptibility clearly\nestablish a spin-glass like cooperative freezing of ferromagnetic clusters at\n200.9(2)~K. The existence of spin-glass like freezing of ferromagnetic clusters\nis further substantiated by the ZFC aging and memory experiments. We also\nobserve certain dynamical features which are not present in a typical\nspin-glass, such as, initial magnetization after ZFC aging first increases and\nthen decreases with the wait time and an imperfect recovery of relaxation in\nnegative temperature cycling experiments. This imperfect recovery transforms to\nperfect recovery on concurrent field cycling. Our analysis suggests that these\nadditional dynamical features have their origin in inter-cluster exchange\ninteraction and cluster size distribution. The inter-cluster exchange\ninteraction above the magnetic percolation gives a superferromagnetic state in\nsome granular thin films but our results show the absence of typical\nsuperferromagnetic like state in La$_{0.75}$Ba$_{0.25}$CoO$_3$.\n", "  Hybrid nanophotonics based on metal-dielectric nanostructures unifies the\nadvantages of plasmonics and all-dielectric nanophotonics providing strong\nlocalization of light, magnetic optical response and specifically designed\nscattering properties. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for fabrication of\nordered hybrid nanostructures via femtosecond laser melting of asymmetrical\nmetal-dielectric (Au-Si) nanoparticles created by lithographical methods. The\napproach allows selective reshaping of the metal components of the hybrid\nnanoparticles without affecting dielectric ones. We apply the developed\napproach for tuning of the hybrid nanostructures scattering properties in the\nvisible range. The experimental results are supported by molecular dynamics\nsimulation and numerical solving of Maxwell equations.\n", "  We present a classical conformal field theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional\nspacetime background. The dynamical object is a space-filling string, and the\nevolution may be thought as occurring on the manifold of the conformal group.\nThe theory is a \"descendant\" of the theory of gravitation in two-dimensional\nspacetime. The discussion is based on the relation of the deformations of the\nspace-filling string with conformal transformations. The realization of the\nconformal algebra in terms of surface deformations possesses a classical\ncentral charge. The action principle, the conformal and Weyl invariances of the\naction, and the equations of motion are studied. The energy-momentum tensor,\nthe coupling to Liouville matter, and the cancellation of anomalies are\nanalyzed. The quantum theory is not discussed.\n", "  Apart from the well-known NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak corrections to W- and\nZ-boson production at hadron colliders, the most important fixed-order\ncorrections are given by the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s\\alpha)$. The knowledge of these corrections is of\nparticular importance to control the theoretical uncertainties in the upcoming\nhigh-precision measurements of the W-boson mass and the effective weak mixing\nangle at the LHC. Since these observables are dominated by the phase-space\nregions of resonant W/Z bosons, we address the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s\\alpha)$\ncorrections in the framework of an expansion about the W/Z poles. Retaining\nonly the leading, resonant contribution in the so-called pole approximation,\nthe corrections can be classified into factorizable and non-factorizable\ncontributions. In this article we review our calculation of the numerically\ndominant corrections which arise from factorizable corrections of\n\"initial-final\" type, i.e. they combine the QCD corrections to the production\nwith the large electroweak corrections to the decay of the W/Z boson. Moreover,\nwe compare our results to simpler approximate combinations of electroweak and\nQCD corrections based on naive products of NLO QCD and electroweak correction\nfactors and using leading-logarithmic approximations for QED final-state\nradiation. Finally, we estimate the shift in the W-boson mass that results from\nthe $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s\\alpha)$ corrections to the transverse-mass\ndistribution.\n", "  Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) show a strong separation of timescales,\nwith the time characterizing inspiral, $T_{\\rm i}$, much longer than any time\n$T_{\\rm o}$ characterizing orbital motions. The ratio of these timescales\n(which is essentially an EMRI's mass ratio) can be regarded as a parameter that\ncontrols a perturbative expansion. Here we describe the value and limitations\nof an \"adiabatic\" description of these binaries, which uses only the leading\nterms arising from such a two-timescale expansion. An adiabatic approach breaks\ndown when orbits evolve through resonances, with important dynamical and\nobservational consequences. We describe the shortfalls of an approach that only\nincludes the adiabatic contributions to EMRI evolution, and outline what must\nbe done to evolve these systems through resonance and to improve our ability to\nmodel EMRI systems more generally.\n", "  Starting from an exact, steady-state, force-free solution of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we investigate how resistive current\nlayers are induced by perturbing line-tied three-dimensional magnetic\nequilibria. This is achieved by the superposition of a weak perturbation field\nin the domain, in contrast to studies where the boundary is driven by slow\nmotions, like those present in photospheric active regions. Our aim is to\nquantify how the current structures are altered by the contribution of so\ncalled quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) as the null point is shifted outside the\ncomputational domain. Previous studies based on magneto-frictional relaxation\nhave indicated that, despite the severe field line gradients of the QSL, the\npresence of a null is vital in maintaining fast reconnection. Here, we explore\nthis notion using highly resolved simulations of the full MHD evolution. We\nshow that for the null-point configuration, the resistive scaling of the peak\ncurrent density is close to $J\\sim\\eta^{-1}$, while the scaling is much weaker,\ni.e. $J\\sim\\eta^{-0.4}$, when only the QSL connectivity gradients provide a\nsite for the current accumulation.\n", "  A number of White Dwarfs (WDs) in cataclysmic binaries have shown brightness\nvariations consistent with non-radial oscillations as observed in isolated WDs.\nA few objects have been well-characterized with photometric campaigns in the\nhopes of gleaning information about the mass, spin, and possibly internal\nstructural characteristics. The novel aspect of this work is the possiblity to\nmeasure or constrain the interior structure and spin rate of WDs which have\nspent gigayears accreting material from their companion, undergoing thousands\nof nova outbursts in the process. In addition, variations in the surface\ntemperature affect the site of mode driving, and provide unique and challenging\ntests for mode driving theories previously applied to isolated WD's. Having\nundergone long-term accretion, these WDs are expected to have been spun up.\nSpin periods in the range 60-100 seconds have been measured by other means for\ntwo objects, GW Lib and V455 And. Compared to typical mode frequencies, the\nspin frequency may be similar or higher, and the Coriolis force can no longer\nbe treated as a small perturbation on the fluid motions. We present the results\nof a non-perturbative calculation of the normal modes of these WDs, using\ninterior thermal structures appropriate to accreting systems. This includes a\ndiscussion of the surface brightness distributions, which are strongly modified\nfrom the non-rotating case. Using the measured spin period of approximately 100\nseconds, we show that the observed pulsations from GW Lib are consistent with\nthe three lowest azimuthal order rotationally modified modes that have the\nhighest frequency in the stellar frame. The high frequencies are needed for the\nconvective driving, but are then apparently shifted to lower frequencies by a\ncombination of their pattern motion and the WD rotation.\n", "  The incidence of very low energy electrons on metal surfaces is mainly\ndictated by the phenomenon of quantum mechanical reflection at the metal\ninterface. Low energy electron reflection is insignificant in higher energy\nregimes, where the more familiar secondary electron emission and electron\nbackscattering processes are the dominant features of the electron-metal\ninteraction. It is a highly controversial subject that has mostly emerged\nduring the last years. In this brief note we examine the source of the\ncontroversy, present some basic theoretical considerations, recommend a dataset\nof reliable experimental results for the reflection of low energy electrons\nfrom tungsten surfaces and discuss the suppression of reflected electrons by\nexternal magnetic fields in the light of applications in fusion devices.\n", "  Lifetimes of bound states of protein complexes or biomolecule folded states\ntypically decrease when subject to mechanical force. However, a plethora of\nbiological systems exhibit the counter-intuitive phenomenon of catch bonding,\nwhere non-covalent bonds become stronger under externally applied forces. The\nquest to understand the origin of catch-bond behavior has lead to the\ndevelopment of phenomenological and microscopic theories that can\nquantitatively recapitulate experimental data. Here, we assess the successes\nand limitations of such theories in explaining experimental data. The most\nwidely applied approach is a phenomenological two-state model, which fits all\nof the available data on a variety of complexes: actomyosin,\nkinetochore-microtubule, selectin-ligand, and cadherin-catenin binding to\nfilamentous actin. With a primary focus on the selectin family of cell-adhesion\ncomplexes, we discuss the positives and negatives of phenomenological models\nand the importance of evaluating the physical relevance of fitting parameters.\nWe describe a microscopic theory for selectins, which provides a structural\nbasis for catch bonds and predicts a crucial allosteric role for residues\nAsn82--Glu88. We emphasize the need for new theories and simulations that can\nmimic experimental conditions, given the complex response of cell adhesion\ncomplexes to force and their potential role in a variety of biological\ncontexts.\n", "  We report 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of single crystals and\naligned powders of URu2Si2 under pressure in the hidden order and paramagnetic\nphases. We find that the Knight shift decreases with applied pressure,\nconsistent with previous measurements of the static magnetic susceptibility.\nPrevious measurements of the spin lattice relaxation time revealed a partial\nsuppression of the density of states below 30 K. This suppression persists\nunder pressure, and the onset temperature is mildly enhanced.\n", "  The inverse scattering problem on the half-line has been studied in the\nliterature in detail. V. Marchenko presented the solution to this problem. In\nthis paper, the invertibility of the steps of the inversion procedure is\ndiscussed and a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the\nscattering data is given for the scattering data to be generated by a potential\nsuitable potential. Our proof is new and in contrast with known proof it does\nnot use equations on the negative half-line.\n", "  A theory of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering by many small particles of\nan arbitrary shape is developed. The particles are perfectly conducting or\nimpedance. For a small impedance particle of an arbitrary shape an explicit\nanalytical formula is derived for the scattering amplitude. The formula holds\nas $a\\to 0$, where $a$ is a characteristic size of the small particle and the\nwavelength is arbitrary but fixed. The scattering amplitude for a small\nimpedance particle is shown to be proportional to $a^{2-\\kappa}$, where\n$\\kappa\\in [0,1)$ is a parameter which can be chosen by an experimenter as\nhe/she wants. The boundary impedance of a small particle is assumed to be of\nthe form $\\zeta=ha^{-\\kappa}$, where $h=$const, Re$h\\ge 0$. The scattering\namplitude for a small perfectly conducting particle is proportional to $a^3$,\nit is much smaller than that for the small impedance particle. The many-body\nscattering problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\\ll d\\ll\n\\lambda$, where $d$ is the minimal distance between neighboring particles and\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength. The distribution law for the small impedance\nparticles is $\\mathcal{N}(\\delta)\\sim\\int_{\\delta}N(x)dx$ as $a\\to 0$. Here\n$N(x)\\ge 0$ is an arbitrary continuous function that can be chosen by the\nexperimenter and $\\mathcal{N}(\\delta)$ is the number of particles in an\narbitrary sub-domain $\\Delta$. It is proved that the EM field in the medium\nwhere many small particles, impedance or perfectly conducting, are distributed,\nhas a limit, as $a\\to 0$ and a differential equation is derived for the\nlimiting field. On this basis the recipe is given for creating materials with a\ndesired refraction coefficient by embedding many small impedance particles into\na given material.\n", "  Among the simple Lie algebras, $D_4$ is distinguished as the unique one whose\ngroup of outer-automorphisms is bigger than $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We study the\ncompactifications of the $D_4$ (2,0) Theory on a punctured Riemann surface,\n$C$, with outer-automorphism twists around cycles of $C$ lying in\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3\\subset \\text{Aut}(D_4)= S_3$. The resulting 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nSCFTs have a number of new and interesting properties. As byproduct, we\ndiscover a new rank-1 $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with flavour symmetry group $SU(4)$.\n", "  Pressure dependence of electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of\n$\\mathrm{Mg_2Sn}$ are investigated by using a modified Becke and Johnson (mBJ)\nexchange potential, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The corresponding\nvalue of spin-orbit splitting at $\\Gamma$ point is 0.47 eV, which is in good\nagreement with the experimental value 0.48 eV. With the pressure increasing,\nthe energy band gap first increases, and then decreases. In certain doping\nrange, the power factor for n-type has the same trend with energy band gap,\nwhen the pressure increases. Calculated results show that the pressure can lead\nto significantly enhanced power factor in n-type doping below the critical\npressure, and the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity near the critical\npressure shows the relatively small value. These results make us believe that\nthermoelectric properties of $\\mathrm{Mg_2Sn}$ can be improved in n-type doping\nby pressure.\n", "  Advances in perturbative QCD techniques have been crucial for the successful\ninterpretation of the data collected in Run I of LHC, and for the discovery of\nthe Higgs boson. I will very briefly highlight some recent additions to the QCD\ntoolbox, and note how these new tools are likely to be essential for future\nprecision physics, both in Run II at the LHC, and in view of future hadron and\nlepton colliders.\n", "  The heat equation is considered in the complex medium consisting of many\nsmall bodies (particles) embedded in a given material. On the surfaces of the\nsmall bodies an impedance boundary condition is imposed. An equation for the\nlimiting field is derived when the characteristic size $a$ of the small bodies\ntends to zero, their total number $\\mathcal{N}(a)$ tends to infinity at a\nsuitable rate, and the distance $d = d(a)$ between neighboring small bodies\ntends to zero: $a << d$, $\\lim_{a\\to 0}\\frac{a}{d(a)}=0$. No periodicity is\nassumed about the distribution of the small bodies. These results are basic for\na method of creating a medium in which heat signals are transmitted along a\ngiven line. The technical part for this method is based on an inverse problem\nof finding potential with prescribed eigenvalues.\n", "  We constructed physically stable sp2 negatively curved cubic carbon\nstructures which reticulate a Schwarz P-like surface. The method for\nconstructing such crystal structures is based on the notion of the standard\nrealization of abstract crystal lattices. In this paper, we expound on the\nmathematical method to construct such crystal structures.\n", "  There is a growing body of evidences for the presence of crystalline material\nin comets. These crystals are believed to have been annealed in the inner part\nof the proto-solar nebula, while comets should have been formed in the outer\nregions. Several transport processes have been proposed to reconcile these two\nfacts; among them a migration driven by photophoresis. The primarily goal of\nthis work is to assess whether disk irradiation by a Pre-Main Sequence star\nwould influence the photophoretic transport. To do so, we have implemented an\nevolving 1+1D model of an accretion disk, including advanced numerical\ntechniques, undergoing a time-dependent irradiation, consistent with the\nevolution of the proto-Sun along the Pre-Main Sequence. The photophoresis is\ndescribed using a formalism introduced in several previous works. Adopting the\nopacity prescription used in these former studies, we find that the disk\nirradiation enhances the photophoretic transport: the assumption of a disk\ncentral hole of several astronomical units in radius is no longer strictly\nrequired, whereas the need for an ad hoc introduction of photoevaporation is\nreduced. However, we show that a residual trail of small particles could\nannihilate the photophoretic driven transport via their effect on the opacity.\nWe have also confirmed that the thermal conductivity of transported aggregates\nis a crucial parameter which could limit or even suppress the photophoretic\nmigration and generate several segregation effects.\n", "  In the present study we prove rigorously that in the long-wave limit, the\nunidirectional solutions of a class of nonlocal wave equations to which the\nimproved Boussinesq equation belongs are well approximated by the solutions of\nthe Camassa-Holm equation over a long time scale. This general class of\nnonlocal wave equations model bidirectional wave propagation in a nonlocally\nand nonlinearly elastic medium whose constitutive equation is given by a\nconvolution integral. To justify the Camassa-Holm approximation we show that\napproximation errors remain small over a long time interval. To be more\nprecise, we obtain error estimates in terms of two independent, small, positive\nparameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ measuring the effect of nonlinearity and\ndispersion, respectively. We further show that similar conclusions are also\nvalid for the lower order approximations: the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony\napproximation and the Korteweg-de Vries approximation.\n", "  We have performed large scale variational search for the best RVB ansatz for\nthe spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ kagome antiferromagnet with both nearest-neighboring(NN)\nand next-nearest-neighboring(NNN) exchanges assuming only translational\nsymmetry. We find the best RVB state is always fully symmetric and has an mean\nfield ansatz that is gauge equivalent to a previous proposed Z$_{2}$ spin\nliquid ansatz. The Z$_{2}$ state is found to be slightly more stable than the\nextensively studied U(1) gapless Dirac spin liquid state in both the\n$J_{2}\\neq0$ and the $J_{2}=0$ case and to possess a small spinon gap for\n$J_{2}<0.2$. The breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry in the Z$_{2}$ state is\nfound to increase with $J_{2}$ and to be quite substantial around $J_{2}=0.15$.\nHowever, we find the Z$_{2}$ state is always very close to the gapless U(1)\nDirac spin liquid state, although they have very different RVB parameters. We\nargue the kagome antiferromagnet should be better understood as a near critical\nsystem, rather than a system deep inside a gapped spin liquid phase with well\nestablished Z$_{2}$ topological order.\n", "  We have obtained membership probabilities of stars within a field of radius\n$\\sim3^\\circ$ around the centre of the open cluster Alpha Persei using proper\nmotions and photometry from the PPMXL and WISE catalogues. We have identified\n810 possible stellar members of Alpha Persei. We derived the global and radial\npresent-day mass function (MF) of the cluster and found that they are well\nmatched by two-stage power-law relations with different slopes at different\nradii. The global MF of Alpha Persei shows a turnover at\n$m=0.62\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ with low and high-mass slopes of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{low}=0.50\\pm0.09$ ($0.1<m/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}<0.62$) and\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{high}=2.32\\pm0.14$ ($0.62\\leq m/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}<4.68$)\nrespectively. The high-mass slope of the cluster increases from $2.01$ inside\n$1\\hbox{$.\\!\\!^\\circ$}10$ to $2.63$ outside $2\\hbox{$.\\!\\!^\\circ$}2$, whereas\nthe mean stellar mass decreases from $0.95$ to $0.57\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ in\nthe same regions, signifying clear evidence of mass segregation in the cluster.\nFrom an examination of the high-quality colour-magnitude data of the cluster\nand performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations we obtained a binary\nfraction of $f_{\\rm bin}=34\\pm12$ percent for stars with\n$0.70<m/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}<4.68$. This is significantly larger than the\nobserved binary fraction, indicating that this open cluster contains a large\npopulation of unresolved binaries. Finally, we corrected the mass-function\nslopes for the effect of unresolved binaries and found low- and high-mass\nslopes of $\\alpha_\\mathrm{low}=0.89\\pm0.11$ and\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{high}=2.37\\pm0.09$ and a total cluster mass of\n$352\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The experimental study of neural networks requires simultaneous measurements\nof a massive number of neurons, while monitoring properties of the\nconnectivity, synaptic strengths and delays. Current technological barriers\nmake such a mission unachievable. In addition, as a result of the enormous\nnumber of required measurements, the estimated network parameters would differ\nfrom the original ones. Here we present a versatile experimental technique,\nwhich enables the study of recurrent neural networks activity while being\ncapable of dictating the network connectivity and synaptic strengths. This\nmethod is based on the observation that the response of neurons depends solely\non their recent stimulations, a short-term memory. It allows a long-term scheme\nof stimulation and recording of a single neuron, to mimic simultaneous activity\nmeasurements of neurons in a recurrent network. Utilization of this technique\ndemonstrates the spontaneous emergence of cooperative synchronous oscillations,\nin particular the coexistence of fast Gamma and slow Delta oscillations, and\nopens the horizon for the experimental study of other cooperative phenomena\nwithin large-scale neural networks.\n", "  This papers deals with connections between quantum anomalies and\ntransformations of Feynman pseudo-measures. Mathematical objects related to the\nnotion of the volume element in an infinite-dimensional space considered in the\nphysics literature are considered and disagreement in the related literature\nregarding the origin of quantum anomalies is explained.\n", "  A search for hidden photon cold dark matter in a mass range from 5 to 500 eV\nin data collected during 60 days in November and December, 2015 by a\nMulti-Cathode Counter (MCC) is reported. From the analyses of this data we\nfound no evidence for the existence of HP CDM and set an upper limit on the\nphoton-HP mixing parameter $\\chi$. This is the first result obtained by direct\nmeasurements in this mass range for hidden photon CDM using a single electron\nevent in MCC as a signature.\n", "  Monolayer black phosphorus (MBP) is an interesting emerging electronic\nmaterial with a direct band gap and relatively high carrier mobility. In this\nwork we report a theoretical investigation of nonequilibrium spin injection and\nspin-polarized quantum transport in MBP from ferromagnetic Ni contacts, in\ntwo-dimensional magnetic tunneling structures. We investigate physical\nproperties such as the spin injection efficiency, the tunnel magnetoresistance\nratio, spin-polarized currents, charge currents and transmission coefficients\nas a function of external bias voltage, for two different device contact\nstructures where MBP is contacted by Ni(111) and by Ni(100). While both\nstructures are predicted to give respectable spin-polarized quantum transport,\nthe Ni(100)/MBP/Ni(100) trilayer has the superior properties where the spin\ninjection and magnetoresistance ratio maintains almost a constant value against\nthe bias voltage. The nonequilibrium quantum transport phenomenon is understood\nby analyzing the transmission spectrum at nonequilibrium.\n", "  Three single-layer tetragonal silicon carbides (SiC), termed as T1,T2 and T3,\nare proposed by density functional theory (DFT) computations. Although the\nthree structures have the same topological geometry, they show versatile\nelectronic properties from semiconductor (T1), semimetal (T2) to metal (T3).The\nversatile properties are originated from the rich bonds between Si and C atoms.\nThe nanoribbons of the three SiC also show interesting electronic properties.\nEspecially, T1 nanoribbons possess exotic edge states, where electrons only\ndistribute on one edge's silicon or carbon atoms. The band gaps of the T1\nnanoribbons are constant because of no interaction between the edge states.\n", "  Graphite may be viewed as a low-surface-energy carbon allotrope with little\nlayer-layer interaction. Other low-surface-energy allotropes but with much\nstronger layer-layer interaction may also exist. Here, we report a\nfirst-principles prediction for one of the known carbon allotropes, bcc-C6 (a\nbody centered carbon allotrope with six atoms per primitive unit) that should\nhave exceptionally low-surface energy and little size dependence down to only a\ncouple layer thickness. This unique property may explain the existence of the\nrelatively-high-energy bcc-C6 during growth. The electronic properties of the\nbcc-C6thin layers can also be intriguing: the (111), (110), and (001) thin\nlayers havedirect band gap, indirect band gap, and metallic character,\nrespectively. The refrained chemical reactivity of the thin layers does not\ndisappear after cleaving, as lithium-doped (Li-doped) 3-layers (111) has a\nnoticeably increased binding energies of H2 molecules with a maximum storage\ncapacity of 10.8 wt%.\n", "  A novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope, rectangular graphyne (R-graphyne)\nwith tetra-rings and acetylenic linkages, is proposed by first-principles\ncalculations. Although the bulk R-graphyne exhibits metallic property, the\nnanoribbons of R-graphyne show distinct electronic structures from the bulk.\nThe most intriguing feature is that band gaps of R-graphene nanoribbons\noscillate between semiconductor and metal as a function of width. Particularly,\nthe zigzag edge nanoribbons with half-integer repeating unit cell exhibits\nunexpected Dirac-like fermions in the band structures. The Dirac-like fermions\nof the R-graphyne nanoribbons originate from the central symmetry and two\nsub-lattices. The extraordinary properties of R-graphene nanoribbons greatly\nexpand our understanding on the origin of Dirac-like point. Such findings\nuncover a novel fascinating property of nanoribbons, which may have broad\npotential applications for carbon-based nano-size electronic devices.\n", "  It is well known that in the presence of a ring cavity the light scattering\nfrom a uniform atomic ensemble can become unstable resulting in the collective\natomic recoil lasing. This is the result of a positive feedback due to the\ncavity. We propose to add an additional electronic feedback loop based on the\nphotodetection of the scattered light. The advantage is a great flexibility in\nchoosing the feedback algorithm, since manipulations with electric signals are\nvery well developed. In this paper we address the application of such a\nfeedback to atoms in the Bose-Einstein condensed state and explore the quantum\nnoise due to the incoherent feedback action. We show that although the feedback\nbased on the photodetection does not change the local stability of the initial\nuniform distribution with respect to small disturbances, it reduces the region\nof attraction of the uniform equilibrium. The feedback-induced nonlinearity\nenables quantum fluctuations to bring the system out of the stability region\nand cause an exponential growth even if the uniform state is globally stable\nwithout the feedback. Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation\nwe show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the\nexcited atomic and light modes. The feedback loop, however, introduces\nadditional noise into the number of quanta of these modes. Importantly, the\nfeedback opens an opportunity to position the modulated BEC inside a cavity as\nwell as tune the phase of scattered light. This can find applications in\nprecision measurements and quantum simulations.\n", "  The field of Quantum Chaos, addressing the quantum manifestations of an\nunderlying classically chaotic dynamics, was developed in the early eighties,\nmainly from a theoretical perspective. Few experimental systems were initially\nrecognized to exhibit the versatility of being sensitive, at the same time, to\ntheir classical and quantum dynamics. Rydberg atoms provided the main testing\nground of Quantum Chaos concepts until the early nineties, marked by the\ndevelopment of microwave billiards, ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, and\nlow-temperature transport in mesoscopic semiconductor structures. The\nmesoscopic regime is attained in small condensed matter systems at sufficiently\nlow temperatures for the electrons to propagate coherently across the sample.\nThe quantum coherence of electrons, together with the ballistic motion\ncharacteristic of ultra-clean microstructures, motivated the proposal of\nmesocopic systems as a very special laboratory for performing measurements and\ntesting the theoretical ideas of Quantum Chaos. Experimental realizations and\nmany important developments, reviewed in this article, followed from such a\nconnection.\n", "  We study the thermoelectrical transports for an interacting dot attached to\ntwo graphene electrodes. Graphene band structure shows a pseudogap density of\nstates that affects strongly the transport properties. In this work, we focus\non the Coulomb blockade regime and derive the expression for Onsager matrix\nO_{ij} that relates the electrical and heat currents with electrical and\nthermal biases in the linear response regime. Our findings show double peak\nstructures for the electrical and thermal conductances versus the dot level in\naccordance with the Coulom blockade phenomenon. Remarkably, however, the\nthermal conductance is much smaller than the electrical conductance, resulting\nin high figure of merit value for some gate voltage. Finally, we report a large\ndeparture from the Wiedemann-Franz law caused mainly by the pseudogap density\nof states in the contacts and weakly affected by interactions.\n", "  The connection between a regularization-independent symmetric momentum\nsubstraction (RI-$\\tilde{\\rm S}$MOM) and the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme for the\nquark chromo EDM operators is discussed. A method for evaluating the neutron\nEDM from quark chromoEDM is described. A preliminary study of the signal in the\nmatrix element using clover quarks on a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ)\nensemble is shown.\n", "  Ultrafast electron thermalization - the process leading to Auger\nrecombination, carrier multiplication via impact ionization and hot carrier\nluminescence - occurs when optically excited electrons in a material undergo\nrapid electron-electron scattering to redistribute excess energy and reach\nelectronic thermal equilibrium. Due to extremely short time and length scales,\nthe measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale\ndevices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser\ntechniques. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness\nof two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials in order to introduce a highly\ntunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron\nthermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene\n(G-BN-G) vdW heterostructure, through which optically excited carriers are\ntransported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer\nbias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier\ntransport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer\nscattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways\nin graphene. Our findings, which demonstrate a novel means to probe and\ndirectly modulate electron energy transport in nanoscale materials, represent\nan important step toward designing and implementing novel optoelectronic and\nenergy-harvesting devices with tailored microscopic properties.\n", "  We present the analysis of hot spot brightness in light curves of the\neclipsing dwarf nova IY Ursae Majoris during its normal outburst in March 2013\nand in quiescence in April 2012 and in October 2015. Examination of four\nreconstructed light curves of the hot spot eclipses showed directly that the\nbrightness of the hot spot changed significantly only during the outburst. The\nbrightness of the hot spot, before and after the outburst, was on the same\nlevel. Hereby, based on the behaviour of the hot spot, IY UMa during its normal\noutburst follows the disk-instability model.\n", "  We study Coulomb drag between the top and bottom surfaces of topological\ninsulator films. We derive a kinetic equation for the thin-film spin density\nmatrix containing the full spin structure of the two-layer system, and analyze\nthe electron-electron interaction in detail in order to recover all terms\nresponsible for Coulomb drag. Focusing on typical topological insulator\nsystems, with film thicknesses d up to 6 nm, we obtain numerical and\napproximate analytical results for the drag resistivity $\\rho_\\text{D}$ and\nfind that $\\rho_\\text{D}$ is proportional to\n$T^2d^{-4}n^{-3/2}_{\\text{a}}n^{-3/2}_{\\text{p}}$ at low temperature T and low\nelectron density $n_{\\text{a,p}}$, with a denoting the active layer and p the\npassive layer. In addition, we compare $\\rho_{\\text{D}}$ with graphene,\nidentifying qualitative and quantitative differences, and we discuss the multi\nvalley case, ultra thin films and electron-hole layers.\n", "  We report CCD photometry of the cataclysmic variable star MN Draconis. During\nthe season of August-September 2013, one normal outburst and one superoutburst\nwere detected. In the light curves of MN Dra clear superhumps were present\nduring September 2013 superoutburst. That fact confirms that the star is a\nmember of SU UMa class.\n", "  We briefly discuss three cases of RR~Lyrae variable stars with Blazhko\nmodulation from the OGLE Galactic bulge collection. In one of the discussed\nstars modulation with two periods is detected, in other star, we detect three\nBlazhko modulations.\n", "  One-way quantum deficit and quantum discord are two important measures of\nquantum correlations. We revisit the relationship between them in two-qubit\nsystems. We investigate the conditions that both one-way quantum deficit and\nquantum discord have the same optimal measurement ensembles, and demonstrate\nthat one-way quantum deficit can be derived from the quantum discord for a\nclass of X states. Moreover, we give an explicit relation between one-way\nquantum deficit and entanglement of formation. We show that under phase damping\nchannel both one-way quantum deficit and quantum discord evolve exactly in the\nsame way for four parameters X states. Some examples are presented in details.\n", "  Vertically stacking two dimensional (2D) materials can enable the design of\nnovel electronic and optoelectronic devices and realize complex functionality.\nHowever, the fabrication of such artificial heterostructures in wafer scale\nwith an atomically-sharp interface poses an unprecedented challenge. Here, we\ndemonstrate a convenient and controllable approach for the production of\nwafer-scale 2D GaSe thin films by molecular beam epitaxy. In-situ reflection\nhigh-energy electron diffraction oscillations and Raman spectroscopy reveal a\nlayer-by-layer van der Waals epitaxial growth mode. Highly-efficient\nphotodetector arrays were fabricated based on few-layer GaSe on Si. These\nphotodiodes show steady rectifying characteristics and a relatively high\nexternal quantum efficiency of 23.6%. The resultant photoresponse is super-fast\nand robust with a response time of 60 us. Importantly, the device shows no sign\nof degradation after 1 million cycles of operation. Our study establishes a new\napproach to produce controllable, robust and large-area 2D heterostructures and\npresents a crucial step for further practical applications.\n", "  Interferometers operating at or close to quantum limits of precision have\nfound wide application in tabletop searches for physics beyond the standard\nmodel, the study of fundamental forces and symmetries of nature and\nfoundational tests of quantum mechanics. The limits imposed by quantum\nfluctuations and measurement backaction on conventional interferometers\n($\\delta \\phi \\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$) have spurred the development of schemes to\ncircumvent these limits through quantum interference, multiparticle\ninteractions and entanglement. A prominent example of such schemes, the\nso-called $SU(1,1)$ interferometer, has been shown to be particularly robust\nagainst particle loss and inefficient detection, and has been demonstrated with\nphotons and ultracold atoms. Here, we realize a $SU(1,1)$ interferometer in a\nfundamentally new platform in which the interfering arms are distinct flexural\nmodes of a millimeter-scale mechanical resonator. We realize up to 15.4(3) dB\nof noise squeezing and demonstrate the Heisenberg scaling of interferometric\nsensitivity ($\\delta \\phi \\sim 1/N$), corresponding to a 6-fold improvement in\nmeasurement precision over a conventional interferometer. Our work extends the\noptomechanical toolbox for the quantum manipulation of macroscopic mechanical\nmotion and presents new avenues for studies of optomechanical sensing and the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of multimode optomechanical systems.\n", "  Exponential random graph theory is the complex network analog of the\ncanonical ensemble theory from statistical physics. While it has been\nparticularly successful in modeling networks with specified degree\ndistributions, a naive model of a clustered network using a graph Hamiltonian\nlinear in the number of triangles has been shown to undergo an abrupt\ntransition into an unrealistic phase of extreme clustering via triangle\ncondensation. Here we study a non-linear graph Hamiltonian that explicitly\nforbids such a condensation and show numerically that it generates an\nequilibrium phase with specified intermediate clustering.\n", "  We analyzed spatial and spectral characteristics of quasi-periodic pulses\n(QPP) for the 18 August 2012 limb are, using new data from a complex of\nspectral and imaging instruments developed by the Siberian Solar Radio\nTelescope team and the Wind/Konus gamma-ray spectrometer. A sequence of\nbroadband pulses with periods of approximately ten seconds were observed in\nX-rays at energies between 25 keV and 300 keV, and in microwaves at frequencies\nfrom a few GHz up to 34 GHz during an interval of one minute. The QPP X-ray\nsource was located slightly above the limb where the south legs of large and\nsmall EUV loop systems were close to each other. Before the QPPs the soft X-ray\nemission and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager signal from the\nenergy channels below 25 keV were gradually arising for several minutes at the\nsame location. It was found that each X-ray pulse showed the soft-hard-soft\nbehavior. The 17 and 34 GHz microwave source were at footpoints of the small\nloop system and the source emitting in the 4.2 {7.4 GHz band in the large one.\nThe QPPs were probably generated by modulation of acceleration processes in the\nenergy release site. Analyzing radio spectra we determined the plasma\nparameters in the radio sources. The microwave pulses could be explained by\nrelatively weak variations of the spectrum hardness of emitting electrons.\n", "  The Large sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is the\nlargest optical telescope in China. In last four years, the LAMOST telescope\nhas published four editions data (pilot data release, data release 1, data\nrelease 2 and data release 3). To archive and release these data (raw data,\ncatalog, spectrum etc), we have set up a data cycle management system,\nincluding the transfer of data, archiving, backup. And through the evolution of\nfour software versions, mature established data release system.\n", "  Bimetallic alloys have drawn extensive attentions in materials science due to\ntheir widespread applications in electronics, engineering and catalysis. A very\nfundamental question of alloy is its surface segregation phenomenon. Many\nrecent observations have shown that reactive gases or supports may have strong\neffects on alloy segregation. However, segregation in water, the most common\nsolvent and environment, has not received enough attention. In this paper we\ngive the quantitative descriptions on the surface segregation energies of 23\ntransition-metal impurities in Cu hosts under the conditions of water\nadsorption by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The\ngeneral trends in the changes of segregation energies caused by water\nadsorption are established. Our results show water adsorption could induce\nstrong surface segregation tendencies for early and middle transition metals in\nCu alloys. This finding not only prompts us to re-examine the potential effects\nof water on bimetallic alloy surfaces, but would be also very helpful as a\nguide for the further theoretical and experimental studies in this field.\n", "  In this paper, a model of one-directional propagation of three-component\nseismic waves in a nonlinear multilayered soil profile is coupled with a\nmulti-story multi-span frame model to consider, in a simple way, the\nsoil-structure interaction modelled in a finite element scheme. Modeling the\nthree-component wave propagation enables the effects of a soil multiaxial\nstress state to be taken into account. These reduce soil strength and increase\nnonlinear effects, compared with the axial stress state. The simultaneous\npropagation of three components allows the prediction of the incident direction\nof seismic loading at the ground surface and the analysis of the behavior of a\nframe structure shaken by a three-component earthquake. A parametric study is\ncarried out to characterize the changes in the ground motion due to dynamic\nfeatures of the structure, for different incident wavefield properties and soil\nnonlinear effects. A seismic response depending on parameters such as the\nfrequency content of soil and structure and the polarization of seismic waves\nis observed.\n", "  Forward imaging technique is the base of combined method on density\nreconstruction with the forward calculation and inverse problem solution. In\nthe paper, we introduced the projection equation for the radiographic system\nwith areal source blur and detector blur, gained the projecting matrix from any\npoint source to any detector pixel with x-ray trace technique, proposed the\nideal on gridding the areal source as many point sources with different\nweights, and used the blurring window as the effect of the detector blur. We\nused the forward projection equation to gain the same deviation information\nabout the object edge as the experimental image. Our forward projection\nequation is combined with Constrained Conjugate Gradient method to form a new\nmethod for density reconstruction, XTRACE-CCG. The new method worked on the\nsimulated image of French Test Object and experimental image. The same results\nhave been concluded the affecting range of the blur is decreased and can be\ncontrolled to one or two pixels. The method is also suitable for reconstruction\nof density-variant object. The capability of our method to handle blur effect\nis useful for all radiographic systems with larger source size comparing to\npixel size.\n", "  On the basis of the self-consistent calculation scheme for the electron\nself-energy with the use of the three-point vertex function always satisfying\nthe Ward identity, we find that the obtained quasiparticle dispersion in the\nnormal state in gapped systems such as semiconductors, insulators, and\nmolecules is well reproduced by that in the one-shot GW (or G0W0)\napproximation. In calculating the superconducting transition temperature Tc, we\nalso find a similar situation; the result for Tc in the gauge-invariant\nself-consistent (GISC) framework including the effect of the vertex corrections\nsatisfying the Ward identity is different from that in the conventional\nEliashberg theory (which amounts to the GW approximation for superconductivity)\nbut is close to that in the G0W0 approximation. Those facts indicate that the\nG0W0 approximation actually takes proper account of both vertex and high-order\nself-energy corrections in a mutually cancelling manner and thus we can\nunderstand that the G0W0 approximation is better than the fully self-consistent\nGW one in obtaining some of physical quantities.\n", "  In this paper, we produce synthetic radio views on simulated flux ropes in\nthe solar corona, where finite-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations serve\nto mimic the flux rope formation stages, as well as their stable endstates.\nThese endstates represent twisted flux ropes where balancing Lorentz forces,\ngravity and pressure gradients determine the full thermodynamic variation\nthroughout the flux rope. The obtained models are needed to quantify radiative\ntransfer in radio bands, and allow us to contrast weak to strong magnetic field\nconditions. Field strengths of up to 100 G in the flux rope yield the radio\nviews dominated by optically thin free-free emission. The forming flux rope\nshows clear morphological changes in its emission structure as it deforms from\nan arcade to a flux rope, both on disk and at the limb. For an active region\nfilament channel with a field strength of up to 680 G in the flux rope,\ngyroresonance emission (from the third-fourth gyrolayers) can be detected and\neven dominates over free-free emission at the frequencies of up to 7 GHz.\nFinally, we also show synthetic views on a simulated filament embedded within a\n(weak-field) flux rope, resulting from an energetically consistent MHD\nsimulation. For this filament, synthetic views at the limb show clear\nsimilarities with actual observations, and the transition from optically thick\n(below 10 GHz) to optically thin emission can be reproduced. On the disk, its\ndimension and temperature conditions are as yet not realistic enough to yield\nthe observed radio brightness depressions.\n", "  A new mean field theory is proposed for the Mott transition in the Hubbard\nmodel based on the slave rotor representation of the electron operator. This\ntheory provides a better description of the role of the long range charge\ncorrelation in the Mott insulating state and offers a good estimation of the\ncritical correlation strength for the Mott transition. We have constructed a\nnew variational wave function for the Mott insulating state based on this new\nslave rotor mean field theory. We find this new variational wave function\noutperforms the conventional Jastrow type wave function with long range charge\ncorrelator in the Mott insulating state. It predicts a continuous Mott\ntransition with non-divergent quasiparticle mass at the transition point. We\nalso show that the commonly used on-site mean field decoupling for the slave\nrotor corresponds to the Gutzwiller approximation for the Gutzwiller projected\nwave function with only on-site charge correlator, which can not describe the\nMott transition in any finite dimensional system.\n", "  We present systematic numerical studies of electrical-wave propagation in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) mathematical models, for human,\nventricular tissue with myocyte cells that are attached (a) regularly and (b)\nrandomly to distributed fibroblasts. In both these cases we show that there is\na parameter regime in which single rotating spiral- and scroll-wave states (RS)\nretain their integrity and do not evolve to a state ST that displays\nspatiotemporal chaos and turbulence. However, in another range of parameters,\nwe observe a transition from ST to RS states in both 2D or 3D domains and for\nboth cases (a) and (b). Our studies show that the ST-RS transition and rotation\nperiod of a spiral or scroll wave in the RS state depends on (i) the coupling\nstrength between myocytes and fibroblasts and (ii) the number of fibroblasts\nattached to myocytes. We conclude that myocyte-fibroblast coupling strength and\nthe number of fibroblasts are more important for the ST-RS transition than the\nprecise way in which fibroblasts are distributed over myocyte tissue.\n", "  A novel approach to the modelling and simulation of the industrial compaction\nprocess of ceramic powders is proposed, based on a combination of: (i)\ncontinuum mechanics modelling of the constitutive response of the material;\n(ii) finite element discretization and computer implementation of the\nmechanical model; (iii) parametric identification by a multi-objective\noptimization of simulated experimental tests. The capabilities of the proposed\napproach are highlighted through computer simulations of realistic industrial\ncompaction processes, namely, the forming of an axisymmetric tablet and of a\nthree-dimensional ceramic tile. The presented methods and the pointed out\nresults pave the way for the introduction of so-called virtual prototyping into\nthe industrial practice of ceramic forming processes.\n", "  We present a two-state empirical valence bond (EVB) potential describing\ninteractions between sulphuric acid and water molecules and designed to model\nproton transfer between them within a classical dynamical framework. The\npotential has been developed in order to study the properties of molecular\nclusters of these species, which are thought to be relevant to atmospheric\naerosol nucleation. The particle swarm optimisation method has been used to fit\nthe parameters of the EVB model to density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. Features of the parametrised model and DFT data are compared and\nfound to be in satisfactory agreement. In particular, it is found that a single\nsulphuric acid molecule will donate a proton when clustered with four water\nmolecules at 300 K and that this threshold is temperature dependent.\n", "  Context. It has recently been proposed that the surface composition of icy\nmain-belt asteroids (B-,C-,Cb-,Cg-,P-,and D-types) may be consistent with that\nof chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles (CPIDPs). Aims. In the light\nof this new association, we re-examine the surface composition of a sample of\nasteroids belonging to the Themis family in order to place new constraints on\nthe formation and evolution of its parent body. Methods. We acquired NIR\nspectral data for 15 members of the Themis family and complemented this dataset\nwith existing spectra in the visible and mid-infrared ranges to perform a\nthorough analysis of the composition of the family. Assuming end-member\nminerals and particle sizes (<2\\mum) similar to those found in CPIDPs, we used\na radiative transfer code adapted for light scattering by small particles to\nmodel the spectral properties of these asteroids. Results. Our best-matching\nmodels indicate that most objects in our sample possess a surface composition\nthat is consistent with the composition of CP IDPs.We find ultra-fine grained\nFe-bearing olivine glasses to be among the dominant constituents. We further\ndetect the presence of minor fractions of Mg-rich crystalline silicates. The\nfew unsuccessfully matched asteroids may indicate the presence of interlopers\nin the family or objects sampling a distinct compositional layer of the parent\nbody. Conclusions. The composition inferred for the Themis family members\nsuggests that the parent body accreted from a mixture of ice and anhydrous\nsilicates (mainly amorphous) and subsequently underwent limited heating. By\ncomparison with existing thermal models that assume a 400km diameter\nprogenitor, the accretion process of the Themis parent body must have occurred\nrelatively late (>4Myr after CAIs) so that only moderate internal heating\noccurred in its interior, preventing aqueous alteration of the outer shell.\n", "  The conservation of the energy flux in turbulent jets which propagate in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) allows deducing the law of motion in the classical\nand relativistic cases. Three types of IGM are considered: constant density,\nhyperbolic and inverse power law decrease of density. An analytical law for the\nevolution of the magnetic field along the radio-jets is deduced using a linear\nrelation between the magnetic pressure and the rest density. Astrophysical\napplications are made to the centerline intensity of synchrotron emission in\nNGC315 and to the magnetic field of 3C273.\n", "  Using density functional theory, we predict half-metallicity in edge\nhydrogenated armchair boron nitride nanoribbons (ABNNRs). The predicted spin\npolarization is analyzed in detail by calculating electronic and magnetic\nproperties of these hydrogenated ABNNRs by means of first-principles\ncalculations within the local spin-density approximation (LSDA). ABNNRs with\nonly edge B atoms passivated by H atoms are found to be half-metallic\n(regardless of their width) with a half-metal gap of 0.26 eV. Upto 100% spin\npolarized charge transport is predicted across the Fermi level owing to the\ngiant spin splitting. Transmission spectrum analysis also confirms the\nseparation of spin up and spindown electronic channels. It is revealed that\nH-passivation of only edge N atoms transforms non-magnetic bare ribbons into\nenergetically stable magnetic semiconductors whereas hydrogenation of both the\nedges does not affect the electronic and magnetic state of bare ribbons\nsignificantly. The results are promising towards the realization of inorganic\nspintronic devices.\n", "  Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum gate in decoherence-free subspaces is of\ngreatly practical importance due to its built-in fault tolerance, coherence\nstabilization virtues, and short run-time. Here we propose some compact schemes\nto implement two- and three-qubit controlled unitary quantum gates and Fredkin\ngate. For the controlled unitary quantum gates, the unitary operator acting on\nthe target qubit is an arbitrary single-qubit gate operation. The controlled\nquantum gates can be directly implemented using non-adiabatic holonomy in\ndecoherence-free subspaces and the required resource for the decoherence-free\nsubspace encoding is minimal by using only two neighboring physical qubits\nundergoing collective dephasing to encode a logical qubit.\n", "  We study the spin-dependent electronic structure of UTe and UT_{2}Si_{2}\n(T=Cu and Mn) compounds with a combination of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism\nmeasurements and first principle calculations. By exploiting the presence of\nsizable quadrupolar and dipolar contributions to the U L_{2,3}-edge x-ray\nabsorption cross section we are able to provide unique information on the\nextent of hybridization between 5f and 6d/3d electronic states, a key parameter\nregulating the physical properties of all actinide materials. Since this\ninformation is hardly accessible to other probes, the new methodology opens up\nnew venues for investigating this important class of materials.\n", "  We consider a binary Lennard-Jones glassformer whose super-Arrhenius dynamics\nare correlated with the formation of icosahedral structures. Upon cooling these\nicosahedra organize into mesoclusters. We recast this glassformer as an\neffective system of icosahedra which we describe with a population dynamics\nmodel. This model we parameterize with data from the temperature regime\naccessible to molecular dynamics simulations. We then use the model to\ndetermine the population of icosahedra in mesoclusters at arbitrary\ntemperature. Using simulation data to incorporate dynamics into the model we\npredict relaxation behavior at temperatures inaccessible to conventional\napproaches. Our model predicts super-Arrhenius dynamics whose relaxation time\nremains finite for non-zero temperature.\n", "  Using the Newman and Penrose spin coefficient (NP) formalism, we provide a\nderivation of the Dyer-Roeder equation for the angular diameter distance in\ncosmological space-times. We show that the geodesic deviation equation written\nin NP formalism is precisely the Dyer-Roeder equation for a general\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time, and then we examine the angular\ndiameter distance to redshift relation in the case that a flat FRW metric is\nperturbed by a gravitational potential. We examine the perturbation in the case\nthat the gravitational potential exhibits the properties of a thin\ngravitational lens, demonstrating how the weak lensing shear and convergence\nact as source terms for the perturbed Dyer-Roeder equation.\n", "  A rigorous general definition of quantum probability is given, which is valid\nfor elementary events and for composite events, for operationally testable\nmeasurements as well as for inconclusive measurements, and also for\nnon-commuting observables in addition to commutative observables. Our proposed\ndefinition of quantum probability makes it possible to describe quantum\nmeasurements and quantum decision making on the same common mathematical\nfooting. Conditions are formulated for the case when quantum decision theory\nreduces to its classical counterpart and for the situation where the use of\nquantum decision theory is necessary.\n", "  We present the last developments on the IVOA Provenance data model, mainly\nbased on the W3C PROV concept. In the context of the Cherenkov astronomy, the\ndata processing stages imply both assumptions and comparison to dedicated\nsimulations. As a consequence, Provenance information is crucial to the end\nuser in order to interpret the high level data products. The Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA), currently in preparation, is thus a perfect test case\nfor the development of an IVOA standard on Provenance information. We describe\ngeneral use-cases for the computational Provenance in the CTA production\npipeline and explore the proposed W3C notations like PROV-N formats, as well as\nProvenance access solutions.\n", "  High-resolution millimeter wave very-long-baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI)\nis an ideal tool for probing the structure at the base of extragalactic jets in\ndetail. The TeV blazar Mrk 501 is one of the best targets among BL Lac objects\nfor studying the nature of off-axis jet structures because it shows different\njet position angles at different scales. The aim of this study is to\ninvestigate the properties of the off-axis jet structure through\nhigh-resolution mm-VLBI images at the jet base and physical parameters such as\nkinematics, flux densities, and spectral indices. We performed Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) observations over six epochs from 2012 February to 2013\nFebruary at 43 GHz. Quasi-simultaneous Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA)\nobservations at 86 GHz were performed in May 2012. We discover a new jet\ncomponent at the northeast direction from the core in all the images at 43 and\n86 GHz. The new component shows the off-axis location from the persistent jet\nextending to the southeast. The 43 GHz images reveal that the scattering of the\npositions of the NE component is within ~0.2 mas. The 86 GHz data reveals a jet\ncomponent located 0.75 mas southeast of the radio core. We also discuss the\nspectral indices between 43 and 86 GHz, where the northeast component has\nsteeper spectral index and the southeast component has comparable or flatter\nindex than the radio core does.\n", "  The present work is an attempt for emergent universe scenario with modified\nChaplygin gas. The universe is chosen as spatially flat FRW space-time with\nmodified Chaplygin gas as the only cosmic substratum. It is found that emergent\nscenario is possible for some specific (unrealistic) choice of the parameters\nin the equation of state for modified Chaplygin gas.\n", "  A fraction of the missing sulfur in dense clouds and circumstellar regions\ncould be in the form of three species not yet de- tected in the interstellar\nmedium: H2S2, HS2, and S2 according to experimental simulations performed under\nastrophysically relevant conditions. These S-S bonded molecules can be formed\nby the energetic processing of H2S-bearing ice mantles on dust grains, and\nsubsequently desorb to the gas phase. The detection of these species could\npartially solve the sulfur depletion problem, and would help to improve our\nknowledge of the poorly known chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium.\nTo this purpose we performed dedicated ground-based observations toward the\nlow-mass warm core IRAS16293-2422. Observations in the submillimeter regime\nwere obtained with the APEX 12 m telescope during 15 hours of observation,\ntargeting a wide selection of the predicted rotational transitions of the three\nmolecules. The 1{\\sigma} noise rms values were extracted in the spectral\nregions where the targeted species should have been detected. These values were\na factor of 2-7 lower than those reached by previous observations toward the\nsame source, and allowed us to estimate a 1{\\sigma} upper limit to their\nmolecular abundances of 8.1E-9 , 1.1E-8 , and 2.9E-7 relative to H2, for H2S2,\nHS2, and S2, respectively. The upper limit abundances of the three molecules\ncontaining the S2 unit are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the H2S\nabundance in the source, and one order of magnitude lower than the expected\nabundances from the experimental simulations using ice analogs. Subsequent\ngas-phase chemistry after desorption could lower the abundances of the three\nspecies to undetectable levels in our observations.\n", "  We propose a framework that learns the graph structure underlying a set of\nsmooth signals. Given $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ whose rows reside on the\nvertices of an unknown graph, we learn the edge weights\n$w\\in\\mathbb{R}_+^{m(m-1)/2}$ under the smoothness assumption that\n$\\text{tr}{X^\\top LX}$ is small. We show that the problem is a weighted\n$\\ell$-1 minimization that leads to naturally sparse solutions. We point out\nhow known graph learning or construction techniques fall within our framework\nand propose a new model that performs better than the state of the art in many\nsettings. We present efficient, scalable primal-dual based algorithms for both\nour model and the previous state of the art, and evaluate their performance on\nartificial and real data.\n", "  The power spectrum of Near InfraRed Background (NIRB) fluctuations measured\nat 3.6 $\\mu$m by {\\tt Spitzer} shows a clustering excess over the known\ngalaxies signal that has been interpreted in terms of early ($z\\simgt 13$),\naccreting (direct collapse) black holes (DCBH) or low-$z$ intrahalo light\n(IHL). In addition, these fluctuations correlate with the cosmic X-ray\nbackground (CXB) measured at (0.5-2) keV, supporting the black hole\nexplanation. This scenario has been questioned by the recent detection of a\ncorrelation between the two {\\tt CIBER} 1.1/1.6 $\\mu$m bands with the 3.6\n$\\mu$m {\\tt Spitzer} one. This correlation is hardly explained by early DCBHs\nthat, due to intergalactic absorption, cannot contribute to the shortest\nwavelength bands. Here we show that the new correlation is caused instead by a\nDiffuse Galactic Light (DGL) component arising from Galactic stellar light\nscattered by dust. The black hole interpretation of the excess remains\nperfectly valid and, actually, the inclusion of DGL allows less demanding (by\nup to about 30\\%) requirements on the DCBH abundance/mass.\n", "  In the works on Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Physics, when deriving\nthe distribution of particles of ideal gases, one uses the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers in a formal way. In this paper we treat rigorously this problem for\nBose--Einstein, Fermi--Dirac and Maxwell--Boltzmann entropies and present a\ncomplete study in the case of the Maxwell--Boltzmann entropy. Our approach is\nbased on recent results on series of convex functions.\n", "  The goal of this research is to enable MCNP6 to produce high-energy light\nfragments. These energetic light fragments may be emitted by our models through\nthree processes: Fermi breakup, preequilibrium, and coalescence. We explore the\nemission of light fragments through each of these mechanisms and demonstrate an\nimproved agreement with experimental data achieved by extending precompound\nmodels to include emission of fragments heavier than $^4$He.\n", "  In this paper is studied HC-models on a Cayley tree. two states HC-model on a\nCayley tree and Under some conditions on parameters of the two state HC-model\nwe prove existence exactly two of the weakly periodic (non periodic) Gibbs\nmeasures. Furthermore, it considered translation-invariant Gibbs measures for\nfertile four state HC-models and for one of them it proved the non-uniqueness\nof the translation-invariant Gibbs measure.\n", "  Teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading student\nsolutions. Since grading communicates instructors' expectations, TAs' grading\ndecisions play a crucial role in forming students' approaches to problem\nsolving (PS) in physics. We investigated the change in grading practices and\nconsiderations of 18 first-year graduate students participating in a TA\nprofessional development (PD) course. The TAs were asked to state their beliefs\nabout the purpose of grading, to grade a set of specially designed student\nsolutions, and to explain their grading decisions. We found that after one\nsemester of teaching experience and participation in PD, TAs did not\nsignificantly change their goals for grading (i.e., a learning opportunity for\nboth the student and the instructor) or their grading practice. In addition,\nTAs' grading practice frequently did not align with their goals. However, some\nTAs' perceptions of the level of explication required in a student solution did\nchange. Our findings suggest that in order for PD to help TAs better coordinate\ntheir goals with appropriate grading practices, PD should focus on TAs'\nperception of sufficient reasoning in student solutions.\n", "  Research shows that expert-like approaches to problem-solving can be promoted\nby encouraging students to explicate their thought processes and follow a\nprescribed problem-solving strategy. Since grading communicates instructors'\nexpectations, teaching assistants' grading decisions play a crucial role in\nforming students' approaches to problem-solving in physics. We investigated the\ngrading practices and considerations of 43 graduate teaching assistants (TAs).\nThe TAs were asked to grade a set of specially designed student solutions and\nexplain their grading decisions. We found that in a quiz context, a majority of\nTAs noticed but did not grade on solution features which promote expert-like\napproaches to problem-solving. In addition, TAs graded differently in quiz and\nhomework contexts, partly because of how they considered time limitations in a\nquiz. Our findings can inform professional development programs for TAs.\n", "  Recent theory developments in electromagnetic radiation from relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions are reviewed. Electromagnetic observables can serve as a\nthermometer, a viscometer, and tomographic probes to the collision system. The\ncurrent status of the \"direct photon flow puzzle\" is highlighted.\n", "  We summarize some of our recent work on non-perturbative transverse momentum\ndependent (TMD) evolution, emphasizing aspects that are necessary for dealing\nwith moderately low scale processes like semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering.\n", "  We report the observation of intensity feedback random lasing at 645 nm in\nDisperse Orange 11 dye-doped PMMA (DO11/PMMA) with dispersed ZrO$_2$\nnanoparticles (NPs). The lasing threshold is found to increase with\nconcentration, with the lasing threshold for 0.1 wt\\% being $75.8 \\pm 9.4$\nMW/cm$^2$ and the lasing threshold for 0.5 wt\\% being $121.1 \\pm 2.1$\nMW/cm$^2$, with the linewidth for both concentrations found to be $\\approx 10$\nnm. We also consider the material's photostability and find that it displays\nfully reversible photodegradation with the photostability and recovery rate\nbeing greater than previously observed for DO11/PMMA without NPs. This\nenhancement in photostability and recovery rate is found to be explicable by\nthe modified correlated chromophore domain model, with the NPs resulting in the\ndomain free energy advantage increasing from 0.29 eV to 0.41 eV. Additionally,\nthe molecular decay and recovery rates are found to be in agreement with\nprevious measurements of DO11/PMMA [Polymer Chemistry \\textbf{4}, 4948 (2013)].\nThese results present new avenues for the development of robust\nphotodegradation-resistant organic dye-based optical devices.\n", "  The mechanism of the transition of a dynamical system from quantum to\nclassical mechanics is of continuing interest. Practically it is of importance\nfor the interpretation of multi-particle coincidence measurements performed at\nmacroscopic distances from a microscopic reaction zone. Here we prove the\ngeneralized iimaging theorem which shows that the spatial wave function of any\nmulti-particle quantum system, propagating over distances and times large on an\natomic scale but still microscopic, and subject to deterministic external\nfields and particle interactions, becomes proportional to the initial momentum\nwave function where the position and momentum coordinates define a classical\ntrajectory. Currently, the quantum to classical transition is considered to\noccur via decoherence caused by stochastic interaction with an environment. The\nimaging theorem arises from unitary Schroedinger propagation and so is valid\nwithout any environmental interaction. It implies that a simultaneous\nmeasurement of both position and momentum will define a unique classical\ntrajectory, whereas a less complete measurement of say position alone can lead\nto quantum interference effects.\n", "  In the paper we report the modeling and design of material which has a\nnegative thermal expansion (NTE). The basic assumption is a potential between\nthe atoms in the material can be approximated by a Lennard-Jones potential\n(6-12) and the dominant interaction is only between nearest neighbors. We show\nthat the material formed by alternating atomic layers wherein each layer\ncontains a type of atom, and geometry of the arrangement of atoms is\ntriangular, may experience an NTE when sigma_AA = sigma_BB = sigma_AB,\nepsilon_AA = epsilon_BB < epsilon_AB/4 are satisfied, where sigma_ij and\nepsilon_ij are Lennard-Jones parameters\n", "  Wavefunction collapse is usually seen as a discontinuous violation of the\nunitary evolution of a quantum system, caused by the observation. Moreover, the\ncollapse appears to be nonlocal in a sense which seems at odds with General\nRelativity. In this article the possibility that the wavefunction evolves\ncontinuously and hopefully unitarily during the measurement process is\nanalyzed. It is argued that such a solution has to be formulated using a time\nsymmetric replacement of the initial value problem in Quantum Mechanics. Major\ndifficulties in apparent conflict with unitary evolution are identified, but\neventually its possibility is not completely ruled out. This interpretation is\nin a weakened sense both local and realistic, without contradicting Bell's\ntheorem. Moreover, if it is true, it makes Quantum Mechanics consistent with\nGeneral Relativity in the semiclassical framework.\n", "  We calculate the temperature dependence of the weak localization correction\nin a two dimensional system at arbitrary relation between temperature, $T$ and\nthe elastic mean free time. We describe the crossover in the dephasing time\n${\\tau_\\phi(T)}$ between the high temperature, $1/\\tau_\\phi \\simeq T^2 \\ln T$,\nand the low temperature $1/\\tau_\\phi \\simeq T$ behaviors. The prefactors in\nthese dependences are not universal, but are determined by the Fermi liquid\nconstant characterising the spin exchange interaction.\n", "  We establish the consistency of the Fermi liquid description and find a\nrelation between Fermi liquid constants for the two dimensional electron system\nnear the point of full polarization due to a parallel magnetic field $H$. Our\nresults enable us to predict connections between different thermodynamic\nproperties of the system. In particular, we find that near the point of full\npolarization $H_c$, the thermodynamic compressibility of the system experiences\na jump with the subleading $(H_c-H)^{1/2}$ dependence on the magnetic field.\nAlso, the magnetization has a cusp with the dependence of the type $(H-H_c) +\n(H_c-H)^{3/2}$ at $H<H_c$.\n", "  We propose a scheme for implementation of logical gates in a trapped ion\ninside a high-Q cavity. The ion is simultaneously interacting with a\n(classical) laser field as well as with the (quantized) cavity field. We\ndemonstrate that simply by tuning the ionic internal levels with the\nfrequencies of the fields, it is possible to construct a controlled-NOT gate in\na three step procedure, having the ion's internal as well as motional levels as\nqubits. The cavity field is used as an auxiliary qubit and basically remains in\nthe vacuum state.\n"]}
