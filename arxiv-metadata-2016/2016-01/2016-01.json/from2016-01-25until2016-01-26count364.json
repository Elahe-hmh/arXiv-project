leads to extraordinarily efficient\ncharge transport, vastly exceeding that expected for such viscous systems.\nUsing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, in conjunction with dc conductivity,\ndiffusivity and viscosity measurements we unravel the conductivity pathways in\n1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide melts. This study presents evidence of the\nGrotthuss mechanism as a significant contributor to the conductivity, and\nprovides new insights into ion pairing processes as well as the formation of\npolyiodides. The terahertz and transport results are reunited in a model\nproviding a quantitative description of the conduction by physical diffusion\nand the Grotthuss bond-exchange process. These novel results are important for\nthe fundamental understanding of conduction in molten salts and for\napplications where ionic liquids are used as charge-transporting media such as\nin batteries and dye-sensitized solar cells.\n", "  Static distributions of temperature and wind velocity at the transition\nregion are calculated within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of\ncompletely ionized hydrogen plasma. The numerical solution of the derived\nequations gives the width of the transition layer between the chromosphere and\nthe corona as a self-induced opacity of high-frequency Alfven waves (AW). The\ndomain wall is direct consequence of the self-consistent MHD treatment of AW\npropagation. The low-frequency MHD waves coming from the Sun are strongly\nreflected by the narrow transition layer, while the high-frequency waves are\nabsorbed - that is why we predict considerable spectral density of the AW in\nthe photosphere. The numerical method allows consideration of incoming AW with\narbitrary spectral density. The idea that Alfven waves might heat the solar\ncorona belongs to Alfven, we simply solved the corresponding MHD equations. The\ncomparison of the solution to the experiment is crucial for revealing the\nheating mechanism.\n", "  It is observed that a constant unit vector denoted by $\\mathbf I$ is needed\nto characterize a complete orthonormal set of vector diffraction-free beams.\nThe previously found diffraction-free beams are shown to be included as special\ncases. The $\\mathbf I$-dependence of the longitudinal component of\ndiffraction-free beams is also discussed.\n", "  We compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy of supersymmetric extremal\nblack holes in N=4 and N=8 supersymmetric string theories and find results in\nperfect agreement with the microscopic results. In particular these logarithmic\ncorrections vanish for quarter BPS black holes in N=4 supersymmetric theories,\nbut has a finite coefficient for 1/8 BPS black holes in the N=8 supersymmetric\ntheory. On the macroscopic side these computations require evaluating the one\nloop determinant of massless fields around the near horizon geometry, and\ninclude, in particular, contributions from dynamical four dimensional gravitons\npropagating in the loop. Thus our analysis provides a test of one loop quantum\ngravity corrections to the black hole entropy, or equivalently of the\nAdS_2/CFT_1 correspondence. We also extend our analysis to N=2 supersymmetric\nSTU model and make a prediction for the logarithmic correction to the black\nhole entropy in that theory.\n", "  We review a recently proposed approach to construct superstring cosmological\nevolutions, which are free of Hagedorn instabilities and initial singularities.\nWe illustrate these ideas in hybrid models in two dimensions.\n", "  We study the emergence of Minkowski space-time from a causal network.\nDifferently from previous approaches, we require the network to be\ntopologically homogeneous, so that the metric is derived from pure\nevent-counting. Emergence from events has an operational motivation in\nrequiring that every physical quantity---including space-time---be defined\nthrough precise measurement procedures. Topological homogeneity is a\nrequirement for having space-time metric emergent from the pure topology of\ncausal connections, whereas physically homogeneity corresponds to the\nuniversality of the physical law. We analyze in detail the case of 1+1\ndimensions. If we consider the causal connections as an exchange of classical\ninformation, we can establish coordinate systems via an Einsteinian protocol,\nand this leads to a digital version of the Lorentz transformations. In a\ncomputational analogy, the foliation construction can be regarded as the\nsynchronization with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines\n(corresponding to the causally independent events) in a parallel distributed\ncomputation. Thus the Lorentz time-dilation emerges as an increased density of\nleaves within a single tic-tac of a clock, whereas space-contraction results\nfrom the corresponding decrease of density of events per leaf. The operational\nprocedure of building up the coordinate system introduces an in-principle\nindistinguishability between neighboring events, resulting in a network that is\ncoarse-grained, the thickness of the event being a function of the observer's\nclock.\n", "  Two-pulse correlation is employed to investigate the temporal dynamics of\nboth two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) and four-photon photoluminescence\n(4PPL) in resonant and nonresonant nanoantennas excited at a wavelength of 800\nnm. Our data are consistent with the same two-step model being the cause of\nboth 4PPL and 2PPL, implying that the first excitation step in 4PPL is a\nthree-photon sp->sp direct interband transition. Considering energy and parity\nconservation, we also explain why 4PPL behavior is favored over three-and\nfive-photon photoluminescence in the power range below the damage threshold of\nour antennas. Since sizeable 4PPL requires larger peak intensities of the local\nfield, we are able to select either 2PPL or 4PPL in the same gold nanoantennas\nby choosing a suitable laser pulse duration. We thus provide a first consistent\nmodel for the understanding of multiphoton photoluminescence generation in gold\nnanoantennas, opening new perspectives for applications ranging from the\ncharacterization of plasmonic resonances to biomedical imaging.\n", "  We consider an extension of the standard model (SM) with three $SU(2)$ scalar\ndoublets and a discrete $S_3\\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. The irreducible\nrepresentation of $S_3$ has a singlet and a doublet, and here we show that the\nsinglet corresponds to the SM-like Higgs and the two additional $SU(2)$\ndoublets forming a $S_3$ doublet are inert. In general, in a three scalar\ndoublet model, with or without $S_3$ symmetry, the diagonalization of the mass\nmatrices implies arbitrary unitary matrices. However, we show that in our model\nthese matrices are of the tri-bimaximal type. We also analyzed the scalar mass\nspectra and the conditions for the scalar potential is bounded from below at\nthe tree level. We also discuss some phenomenological consequences of the\nmodel.\n", "  The ultimate goal and the theoretical limit of weak signal detection is the\nability to detect a single photon against a noisy background. [...] In this\npaper we show, that a combination of a quantum metamaterial (QMM)-based sensor\nmatrix and quantum non-demolition (QND) readout of its quantum state allows, in\nprinciple, to detect a single photon in several points, i.e., to observe its\nwave front.\n  Actually, there are a few possible ways of doing this, with at least one\nwithin the reach of current experimental techniques for the microwave range.\nThe ability to resolve the quantum-limited signal from a remote source against\na much stronger local noise would bring significant advantages to such diverse\nfields of activity as, e.g., microwave astronomy and missile defence.\n  The key components of the proposed method are 1) the entangling interaction\nof the incoming photon with the QMM sensor array, which produces the spatially\ncorrelated quantum state of the latter, and 2) the QND readout of the\ncollective observable (e.g., total magnetic moment), which characterizes this\nquantum state. The effects of local noise (e.g., fluctuations affecting the\nelements of the matrix) will be suppressed relative to the signal from the\nspatially coherent field of (even) a single photon.\n", "  We give a functional analytic construction of the fermionic projector on a\nglobally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold of finite lifetime. The integral kernel\nof the fermionic projector is represented by a two-point distribution on the\nmanifold. By introducing an ultraviolet regularization, we get to the framework\nof causal fermion systems. The connection to the \"negative-energy solutions\" of\nthe Dirac equation and to the WKB approximation is explained and quantified by\na detailed analysis of closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes.\n", "  We will give a new model for measurements of a quantum system such that the\nmeasuring apparatuses are described by a unital separable non-type I nuclear\nsimple C$^*$-algebra equipped with certain unital endomorphisms and pure\nstates. An interaction between the quantum system and the apparatus is\nspecified by a unitary associated with the combined system as before.\nMagnifying to the classical level some aspects of the quantum system so\ncaptured in the apparatus is explicitly done by applying the endomorphism; then\nthe resulting state is the superposition of {\\em phases} with weights. Nature\nwill then choose each phase according to the probability prescribed by the\nweights just as does one when multiple phases appear as in phase transition.\nThus in our model state-reduction (or collapse of the wave function) is a\nprimary event; whether this corresponds to the measurement of an observable or\nwhich one if it does is another matter.\n", "  Cosmological distances inferred from supernova Ia observations constitute the\nmost direct and solid evidence for the recently detected accelerated expansion\nof the universe. In this contribution, we show some inconsistencies between two\nof the main light-curve fitters used for the elaboration of supernova Ia data\nsets, opening new observational challenges regarding the use of these\nluminosity distances when combined with CMB and BAO data. We also mention\nongoing analysis related to alternative models. The resolution of these\nchallenges will be crucial for XXI century cosmology.\n", "  Using cosmological galaxy formation simulations from the MaGICC project,\nspanning more than three magnitudes in stellar mass (~10^7-3x10^{10} Msun), we\ntrace the baryonic cycle of infalling gas from the virial radius through to its\nparticipation in the star formation process. An emphasis is placed upon the\ntemporal history of chemical enrichment during its passage through the corona\nand CGM. We derive the distributions of time between gas crossing the virial\nradius and being accreted to the star forming region (which allows mixing\nwithin the corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the star\nforming region and then forming stars (which allows mixing within the disc).\nSignificant numbers of stars are formed from gas that cycles back through the\nhot halo after first accreting to the star forming region. Gas entering high\nmass galaxies is pre-enriched in low mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the\nvirial radius of the central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial\ngas accreted, even at high redshift (z~5). After entering the virial radius,\nsignificant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas to the\nstar forming region, with gas that is feeding the star forming region\nsurpassing 0.1Z by z=0. Mixing with halo gas, itself enriched via galactic\nfountains, is thus crucial in determining the metallicity at which gas is\naccreted to the disc. The lowest mass simulation (Mvir~2x10^{10}Msun, with\nM*~10^7Msun), by contrast, accretes primordial gas through the virial radius\nand onto the disc at all times. Much like the classical analytical solutions to\nthe `G-dwarf problem', overproduction of low-metallicity stars is ameliorated\nby the inefficiency of star formation. Finally, gas outflow/metal removal rates\nfrom star forming regions as a function of galactic mass are presented.\n", "  Principle of locality means that any local change (perturbation) of the\nstationary state wave function field propagates with finite speed, and\ntherefore reaches distant regions of the field with time delay.\n  If a one-particle or multi-particle non-relativistic quantum system is\ninitially in a stationary state, and its wave function field is locally\nperturbed, then perturbed and non-perturbed sub-regions appear in the region.\nAccording to Schr\\\"odinger equation, borders of the perturbed sub-region\npropagate with infinite speed, and the perturbation instantaneously affects all\ninfinite region. It means that Schr\\\"odinger equation predicts infinite speed\nof the wave function perturbations propagation. This feature of classical\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum\nmechanics. From physical point of view, such mathematical behavior of\nSchr\\\"odinger equation solutions is questionable because it is difficult to\naccept that in real world infinite physical objects can instantaneously appear.\n  We introduce a hypothesis that in reality speed of propagation of the\nperturbed sub-region borders is equal speed of light. On this basis we develop\nand analyze a finite propagation speed concept for non-relativistic quantum\nequations. It leads to local interpretation of non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics consistent with principle of locality and free of local hidden\nvariables. The theory is applied to analysis of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nparadox, entanglement and properties of perturbed matter waves. We proved that\nformulated theory agrees with results of classical experiments on electron\nmatter waves diffraction.\n", "  The concepts of Hamiltonian Feynman integrals in white noise analysis are\nused to realize as the first velocity dependent potential the Hamiltonian\nFeynman integrand for a charged particle in a constant magnetic field in\ncoordinate space as a Hida distribution. For this purpose the velocity\ndependent potential gives rise to a generalized Gauss kernel. Besides the\npropagators also the generating functionals are obtained.\n", "  The concepts of Feynman integrals in white noise analysis are used to\nconstruct the Feynman integrand for the harmonic oscillator in momentum space\nrepresentation as a Hida distribution. Moreover it is shown that in a limit\nsense, the potential free case fulfills the conservation of momentum.\n", "  The spin-transfer torque (STT) in Co2MnSi(CMS)/Al/Co2MnSi spin-valve system\nwith and without interfacial disorder is studied by a first-principles\nnoncollinear wave-function-matching method. It is shown that in the case of\nclean interface the angular dependence of STT for CoCo/Al (the asymmetry\nparameter Lambda approx. 4.5) is more skewed than that for MnSi/Al (Lambda\napprox. 2.9), which suggests the clean CoCo/Al architecture is much more\nefficient for the application on radio frequency oscillation. We also find that\neven with interfacial disorder the spin-valve of half-metallic CMS still has a\nrelatively large parameter Lambda compared to that of conventional ferromagnet.\nIn addition, for clean interface the in-plane torkance of MnSi/Al is about\ntwice as large as that of CoCo/Al. However, as long as the degree of\ninterfacial disorder is sufficiently large, the CoCo/Al and MnSi/Al will show\napproximately the same magnitude of in-plane torkance. Furthermore, our results\ndemonstrate that CMS/Al/CMS system has very high efficiency of STT to switch\nthe magnetic layer of spin-valve.\n", "  We propose a scheme for the secure direct communication based on the\nentangled phase-coherent states, which shows an elevated level of\nconfidentiality. The protocol gives a simultaneous security control for every\nbit of transferred information. The security-check-per-bit is provided by\nsending an additional mode to prove the legitimate parties' authenticity. Other\nbenefit include increased transfer rate, since a separate control sequences is\nunnecessary. We study the security of the scheme for both ideal and realistic\nquantum channel. The protocol shows a robust security and prepares 50%\nprobability to detect the presence of the eavesdropper.\n", "  Scintillating CaWO$_4$ single crystals are a promising multi-element target\nfor rare-event searches and are currently used in the direct Dark Matter\nexperiment CRESST (Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting\nThermometers). The relative light output of different particle interactions in\nCaWO$_4$ is quantified by Quenching Factors (QFs). These are essential for an\nactive background discrimination and the identification of a possible signal\ninduced by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). We present the first\nprecise measurements of the QFs of O, Ca and W at mK temperatures by\nirradiating a cryogenic detector with a fast neutron beam. A clear energy\ndependence of the QF of O and, less pronounced, of Ca was observed for the\nfirst time. Furthermore, in CRESST neutron-calibration data a variation of the\nQFs among different CaWO$_4$ single crystals was found. For typical CRESST\ndetectors the QFs in the region-of-interest (10-40$\\,$keV) are\n$QF_O^{ROI}=(11.2{\\pm}0.5)\\,$%, $QF_{Ca}^{ROI}=(5.94{\\pm}0.49)\\,$% and\n$QF_W^{ROI}=(1.72{\\pm}0.21)\\,$%. The latest CRESST data (run32) is reanalyzed\nusing these fundamentally new results on light quenching in CaWO$_4$ having\nmoderate influence on the WIMP analysis. Their relevance for future CRESST runs\nand for the clarification of previously published results of direct Dark Matter\nexperiments is emphasized.\n", "  We study the QCD phase diagram in the strong coupling limit with fluctuation\neffects by using the auxiliary field Monte-Carlo method. We apply the chiral\nangle fixing technique in order to obtain finite chiral condensate in the\nchiral limit in finite volume. The behavior of order parameters suggests that\nchiral phase transition is the second order or crossover at low chemical\npotential and the first order at high chemical potential. Compared with the\nmean field results, the hadronic phase is suppressed at low chemical potential,\nand is extended at high chemical potential as already suggested in the\nmonomer-dimer-polymer simulations. We find that the sign problem originating\nfrom the bosonization procedure is weakened by the phase cancellation\nmechanism; a complex phase from one site tends to be canceled by the nearest\nneighbor site phase as long as low momentum auxiliary field contributions\ndominate.\n", "  Tennessee is one of the 26 lead state partners that volunteered to provide\nleadership and guidance to states for the purpose of adoption of Next\nGeneration Science Standards (NGSS. As stated in the Tennessee Vision for STEM\nEducation (2009), \"Tennessee recognizes the importance of science and aims to\ncommit to this understanding by becoming involved in the development, and\neventual adoption and implementation of NGSS.\" The present study correlates the\nTennessee State Science Standards to the NGSS for High School Biology/ Life\nSciences and examines the need for a dynamic set of standards that teach the\ntechnical skills and critical thinking needed in these scientific fields. The\nNGSS addresses a move from dated scientific quandaries and proposes standards\nsupported by cutting edge scientific research and literature. Partnerships\nbetween scientists and educators allow for the information exchange necessary\nto implement the changes in scientific research in K-12 instruction.\nProfessional development opportunities that include direct partnerships with\nscientists foster the continued understanding and skills required to teach\nscience.\n", "  It is shown that the relativistic zero-range potential scattering surpasses\nWigner's causality bound, while being consistent with causality. The\nrelativistic theory shows in addition a richer analytic structure, such as a\n$K$-matrix pole necessarily accompanying the bound-state solution. Implications\nof these results for the effective-field theory of nuclear forces are briefly\nconsidered.\n", "  We construct equilibrium models of compact stars using a realistic equation\nof state and obtain the density range occupied by the proton superconductor in\nstrong $B$-fields. We do so by combining the density profiles of our models\nwith microscopic calculations of proton pairing gaps and the critical unpairing\nfield $H_{c2}$ above which the proton type-II superconductivity is destroyed.\nWe find that magnetars with interior homogeneous field within the range $0.1\n\\le B_{16}\\le 2$, where $B_{16} = B/10^{16}$ G, are partially superconducting,\nwhereas those with $B_{16} > 2$ are void of superconductivity. We briefly\ndiscuss the neutrino emissivity and superfluid dynamics of magnetars in the\nlight of their (non)-superconductivity.\n", "  We discuss a Tsallis distribution with complex nonextensivity parameter $q$.\nIn this case the usual distribution is decorated with a log-periodic\noscillating factor (apparently, such oscillations can bee seen in recently\nmeasured transverse momentum distributions in collisions at very high\nenergies). Complex $q$ also means complex heat capacity which shall also be\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The Framework for K-12 Science Education (July 2011) developed by the\nNational Resource Council (NRC) draws on current scientific research and the\nways students learn science effectively. This laid the foundation for Next\nGeneration Science Standards (NGSS) released in Spring 2013. Tennessee was one\nof the 26 lead state partners to provide leadership to the standards writing\nteam and to provide guidance as states deliberate on the adoption and\nimplementation of the NGSS. We propose that the transition from current State\nscience standards to NGSS demonstrates a extensive consensus on what all\nstudents should know and be able to do at specific K-12 grade levels and what\ntopics can be postponed or excluded on the premise of developmental readiness.\nIn order to facilitate this work, one of the STEM Fellows, Larry Bowman\n(author), created a series of 18 posters showing correlations between the\ncurrent Tennessee Science Education standards (Huffman, 2009) and NGSS\n(Achieve, 2013). This article specifically addresses the NGSS Middle Grades\nDisciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) as compared to the existing 6-8 Science\nStandards from the Tennessee Science Curriculum Framework. Some Grade Level\nExpectations (GLEs) for Middle Grades Science have been relocated to other\ngrade levels, and others have been introduced. The term Middle Grades is used\nfor students 10 to 15 years of age covering the critical years when children\nare transitioning from concrete operational to formal operational stages.\n(Piaget and Inhelder 2013).\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the impact of chromium\n(Cr) and vanadium (V) impurities on the magnetic anisotropy and spin\npolarization in Fe/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions. It is demonstrated using\nlayer resolved anisotropy calculation technique, that while the impurity near\nthe interface has a drastic effect in decreasing the perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA), its position within the bulk allows maintaining high surface\nPMA. Moreover, the effective magnetic anisotropy has a strong tendency to go\nfrom in-plane to out-of-plane character as a function of Cr and V concentration\nfavoring out-of-plane magnetization direction for ~1.5 nm thick Fe layers at\nimpurity concentrations above 20 %. At the same time, spin polarization is not\naffected and even enhanced in most situations favoring an increase of tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) values.\n", "  Many atomic and molecular systems of fundamental interest possess resonance\nfrequencies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) where laser technology is limited\nand radiation sources have traditionally lacked long-term phase coherence.\nRecent breakthroughs in XUV frequency comb technology have demonstrated\nspectroscopy with unprecedented resolution at the megahertz level, but even\nhigher resolutions are desired for future applications in precision\nmeasurement. By characterizing heterodyne beats between two XUV comb sources,\nwe demonstrate the capability for sub-hertz spectral resolution. This\ncorresponds to coherence times >1 s at photon energies up to 20 eV, more than\nsix orders of magnitude longer than previously reported. This work establishes\nthe ability of creating highly phase-stable radiation in the XUV with\nperformance rivaling that of visible light. Furthermore, by direct sampling of\nthe phase of the XUV light originating from high-harmonic generation, we\ndemonstrate precise measurements of attosecond strong-field physics.\n", "  High-precision experiments have been done to test the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple (PEP) for electrons by searching for anomalous $K$-series X-rays from\na Cu target supplied with electric current. With the highest sensitivity, the\nVIP (VIolation of Pauli Exclusion Principle) experiment set an upper limit at\nthe level of $10^{-29}$ for the probability that an external electron captured\nby a Cu atom can make the transition from the 2$p$ state to a 1$s$ state\nalready occupied by two electrons. In a follow-up experiment at Gran Sasso, we\naim to increase the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. We show proofs that\nthe proposed improvement factor is realistic based on the results from recent\nperformance tests of the detectors we did at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati\n(LNF).\n", "  A new iteration method is proposed for analyzing both the multiplicities and\nthe transverse momentum spectra measured only within a small rapidity interval\nand with low momentum limit without any inconsistency or ad hoc assumptions and\napplied to the hadron data by the ALICE collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at\n2.76 TeV/A. In order to correctly consider the resonance contribution only to\nthe small rapidity interval, ratios involving only those hadrons whose\ntransverse momentum spectrum is available are considered. In spite of the small\nnumber of ratios considered, the fittings of both the ratios the transverse\nmomentum spectra are excellent. Also the calculated ratios involving strange\nbaryons with parameters obtained agree with data surprisingly well.\n", "  One of the main limiting factors in the carrier mobility in semiconductor\nnanowires is the presence of deep trap levels. While deep-level transient\nspectroscopy (DLTS) has proved to be a powerful tool in analysing traps in bulk\nsemiconductors, this technique is ineffective for the characterisation of\nnanowires due to their very small capacitance. Here we introduce a new\ntechnique for measuring the spectrum of deep traps in nanowires. In\ncurrent-mode DLTS (I-DLTS) the temperature-dependence of the transient current\nthrough a nanowire field-effect transistor in response to an applied gate\nvoltage pulse is measured. We demonstrate the applicability of I-DLTS to\ndetermine the activation energy and capture cross-sections of several deep\ndefect states in zinc oxide nanowires. In addition to characterising deep\ndefect states, we show that I-DLTS can be used to measure the surface barrier\nheight in semiconductor nanowires.\n", "  We explore the backreaction model based on the template metric proposed in\nLarena et al. (2008) constraining the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m^{D_0}$\nand the Dark Energy parameter $w$ with recent data. We provide constraints\nbased on Supernovae Ia from the SNLS and the Union2.1 catalogs, confirming that\nthe backreacted Universe should have a higher matter density than the\ncorresponding Friedmaniann one. Angular diameter distances from clusters data\nconfirm the same feature. Finally we combine these results with constraints\nobtained from the position of the first three peaks and the first dip of the\nCMB power spectrum, fitting WMAP-9 and Planck data. We find that an\ninconsistency arises in predicting the scale factor at recombination, leading\nto a backreacted Universe with lower matter density, in contradiction with\nresults produced by SnIa and clusters. The same behavior is confirmed by\nanalyzing the CMB-shift parameters from WMAP-9. We conclude exploring\nqualitatively the motivations of this inconsistency.\n", "  The experimental realisation of large scale many-body systems has seen\nimmense progress in recent years, rendering full tomography tools for state\nidentification inefficient, especially for continuous systems. In order to work\nwith these emerging physical platforms, new technologies for state\nidentification are required. In this work, we present first steps towards\nefficient experimental quantum field tomography. We employ our procedure to\ncapture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the\nquantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum\nfields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix\nproduct states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states\nnaturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and\nare thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting\nquantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point\ncorrelation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation\nfunctions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at\nhand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for\nquasi-condensates. In this setting, we can use the quality of our tomographic\nreconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved\nphysical processes. We discuss the potential of such methods in the context of\npartial verification of analogue quantum simulators.\n", "  We examine strictly static asymptotically flat spacetimes in\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with U(1) gauge field, revealing that, up to\nsmall curvature corrections, confomally flat slices of the spacetime in\nquestion are of Minkowski origin. We consider uncharged and charged black hole\nsolutions in the theory, showing that, up to the small curvature limit, they\nare diffeomorphic to Schwarzschild_Tangherlini or Reissner-Nordstrom solutions,\nrespectively.\n", "  Recently, we have suggested dielectric metamaterial composed as an array of\nsubmicron dielectric spheres located on top of an amorphous thin-film solar\ncell. We have theoretically shown that this metamaterial can decrease the\nreflection and simultaneously can suppress the transmission through the\nphotovoltaic layer because it transforms the incident plane wave into a set of\nfocused light beams. This theoretical concept has been strongly developed and\nexperimentally confirmed in the present paper. Here we consider the\nmetamaterial for oblique angle illumination, redesign the solar cell and\npresent a detailed experimental study of the whole structure. In contrast to\nour precedent theoretical study we show that our omnidirectional light-trapping\nstructure may operate better than the optimized flat coating obtained by\nplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.\n", "  The requirements of quantum computations impose high demands on the level of\nqubit protection from perturbations; in particular, from those produced by the\nenvironment. Here we propose a superconducting flux qubit design that is\nnaturally protected from ambient noise. This decoupling is due to the qubit\ninteracting with the electromagnetic field only through its toroidal moment,\nwhich provides an unusual qubit-field interaction.\n", "  Mass transfer in close binaries is often non-conservative and the modeling of\nthis kind of mass transfer is mathematically challenging as in this case due to\nthe loss of mass as well as angular momentum the governing system gets\ncomplicated and uncertain. In the present work a new mathematical model has\nbeen prescribed for the non-conservative mass transfer in a close binary system\ntaking in to account the gradually decreasing profile of the mass accretion\nrate by the accreting star with respect to time as well as with respect to the\nincrease in mass of the accreting star. The process of mass transfer is\nunderstood to occur up to a critical mass limit of the accreting star beyond\nwhich this process may cease to work.\n", "  The magnetic structure of a Cr monolayer on a W(110) substrate is\ninvestigated by means of first-principles calculations based on the\nnoncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). As magnetic ground state we\nfind a long-period homochiral left-rotating spin spiral on-top of an\natomic-scale anti-ferromagnetic order of nearest neighbor atoms. The rotation\nangle of the magnetic moment changes inhomogeneously from atom to atom across\nthe spiral. We predict a propagation direction along the crystallographic [001]\ndirection with a period length of 14.3 nm, which is in excellent agreement with\na modulation of the local anti-ferromagnetic contrast observed in\nspin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope experiments by Santos et al. [New\nJ. Phys. 10, 013005 (2008)]. We identify the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) as origin of the homochiral magnetic structure, competing with the\nHeisenberg-type exchange interaction and magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy.\nFrom DFT calculations we extract parameters for a micromagnetic model and\nthereby determine a considerable inhomogeneity of the spin spiral, increasing\nthe period length by 6% compared to homogeneous spin spirals. The results are\ncompared to the behavior of a Mn and Fe monolayer and Fe doublelayer on a\nW(110) substrate.\n", "  Limitation of resources has been recently introduced as a mechanism for the\nsurvival and coexistence of cooperators with defectors in well-mixed\npopulations. Here we examine the same model on a scale-free network. A\nprisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network has shown coexistence of\ncooperators and defectors for the entire range of parameters. Our results show\nthat by introducing the network to the limited resources model, the\ncooperator-dominated region in the parameter space expands comparing to the\nresults of well-mixed population and the coexistence region becomes narrower.\nThe effect of scale-free network is therefore interpreted as improving the\ncooperation in the population and reducing the coexistence.\n", "  In this work we study a Hebbian neural network, where neurons are arranged\naccording to a hierarchical architecture such that their couplings scale with\ntheir reciprocal distance. As a full statistical mechanics solution is not yet\navailable, after a streamlined introduction to the state of the art via that\nroute, the problem is consistently approached through signal- to-noise\ntechnique and extensive numerical simulations. Focusing on the low-storage\nregime, where the amount of stored patterns grows at most logarithmical with\nthe system size, we prove that these non-mean-field Hopfield-like networks\ndisplay a richer phase diagram than their classical counterparts. In\nparticular, these networks are able to perform serial processing (i.e. retrieve\none pattern at a time through a complete rearrangement of the whole ensemble of\nneurons) as well as parallel processing (i.e. retrieve several patterns\nsimultaneously, delegating the management of diff erent patterns to diverse\ncommunities that build network). The tune between the two regimes is given by\nthe rate of the coupling decay and by the level of noise affecting the system.\nThe price to pay for those remarkable capabilities lies in a network's capacity\nsmaller than the mean field counterpart, thus yielding a new budget principle:\nthe wider the multitasking capabilities, the lower the network load and\nviceversa. This may have important implications in our understanding of\nbiological complexity.\n", "  We study the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel\nassisted by quantum no-signalling correlations, and the reverse problem of\nexact simulation of a prescribed channel by a noiseless classical one. Quantum\nno-signalling correlations are viewed as two-input and two-output completely\npositive and trace preserving maps with linear constraints enforcing that the\ndevice cannot signal. Both problems lead to simple semidefinite programmes\n(SDPs) that depend only on the Kraus operator space of the channel. In\nparticular, we show that the zero-error classical simulation cost is precisely\nthe conditional min-entropy of the Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix of the given\nchannel. The zero-error classical capacity is given by a similar-looking but\ndifferent SDP; the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity is the\nregularization of this SDP, and in general we do not know of any simple form.\n  Interestingly however, for the class of classical-quantum channels, we show\nthat the asymptotic capacity is given by a much simpler SDP, which coincides\nwith a semidefinite generalization of the fractional packing number suggested\nearlier by Aram Harrow. This finally results in an operational interpretation\nof the celebrated Lovasz $\\vartheta$ function of a graph as the zero-error\nclassical capacity of the graph assisted by quantum no-signalling correlations,\nthe first information theoretic interpretation of the Lovasz number.\n", "  We study restrictions on locality-preserving unitary logical gates for\ntopological quantum codes in two spatial dimensions. A locality-preserving\noperation is one which maps local operators to local operators --- for example,\na constant-depth quantum circuit of geometrically local gates, or evolution for\na constant time governed by a geometrically-local bounded-strength Hamiltonian.\nLocality-preserving logical gates of topological codes are intrinsically fault\ntolerant because spatially localized errors remain localized, and hence\nsufficiently dilute errors remain correctable. By invoking general properties\nof two-dimensional topological field theories, we find that the\nlocality-preserving logical gates are severely limited for codes which admit\nnon-abelian anyons; in particular, there are no locality-preserving logical\ngates on the torus or the sphere with M punctures if the braiding of anyons is\ncomputationally universal. Furthermore, for Ising anyons on the M-punctured\nsphere, locality-preserving gates must be elements of the logical Pauli group.\nWe derive these results by relating logical gates of a topological code to\nautomorphisms of the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding anyon model, and by\nrequiring the logical gates to be compatible with basis changes in the logical\nHilbert space arising from local F-moves and the mapping class group.\n", "  We propose a relaxation time approximation for the description of the\ndynamics of strongly excited fermion systems. Our approach is based on\ntime-dependent density functional theory at the level of the local density\napproximation. This mean-field picture is augmented by collisional correlations\nhandled in relaxation time approximation which is inspired from the\ncorresponding semi-classical picture. The method involves the estimate of\nmicroscopic relaxation rates/times which is presently taken from the well\nestablished semi-classical experience. The relaxation time approximation\nimplies evaluation of the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the\ndynamical state is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic\nrelaxation time.\n  As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited either by a\nswift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse, driven in various\ndynamical regimes ranging from linear to strongly non-linear reactions. We\nobserve a strong effect of dissipation on sensitive observables such as net\nionization and angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is\nespecially large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation\ntime scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the available\nexcitation energy. Technical details on the actual procedure to implement a\nworking recipe of such a quantum relaxation approximation are given in\nappendices for completeness.\n", "  The cryogenic dark matter experiment CRESST-II aims at the direct detection\nof WIMPs via elastic scattering off nuclei in scintillating CaWO$_4$ crystals.\nWe present a new, highly improved, detector design installed in the current run\nof CRESST-II Phase 2 with an efficient active rejection of surface-alpha\nbackgrounds. Using CaWO$_4$ sticks instead of metal clamps to hold the target\ncrystal, a detector housing with fully-scintillating inner surface could be\nrealized. The presented detector (TUM40) provides an excellent threshold of\n${\\sim}\\,0.60\\,$keV and a resolution of $\\sigma\\,{\\approx}\\,0.090$ keV (at\n2.60$\\,$keV). With significantly reduced background levels, TUM40 sets\nstringent limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section\nand probes a new region of parameter space for WIMP masses below\n3$\\,$GeV/c$^2$. In this paper, we discuss the novel detector design and the\nsurface-alpha event rejection in detail.\n", "  The experiment CRESST-II aims at the detection of dark matter with\nscintillating CaWO$_4$ crystals operated as cryogenic detectors. Recent results\non spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering from the CRESST-II Phase 2 allowed\nto probe a new region of parameter space for WIMP masses below 3 GeV/c$^2$.\nThis sensitivity was achieved after background levels were reduced\nsignificantly. We present extensive background studies of a CaWO$_4$ crystal,\ncalled TUM40, grown at the Technische Universit\\\"at M\\\"unchen. The average\nbeta/gamma rate of 3.51/[kg keV day] (1-40 keV) and the total intrinsic alpha\nactivity from natural decay chains of $3.08\\pm0.04$ mBq/kg are the lowest\nreported for CaWO$_4$ detectors. Contributions from cosmogenic activation,\nsurface-alpha decays, external radiation and intrinsic alpha/beta emitters are\ninvestigated in detail. A Monte-Carlo based background decomposition allows to\nidentify the origin of the majority of beta/gamma events in the energy region\nrelevant for dark matter search.\n", "  The quantum state transfer properties of a class of two-dimensional spin\nlattices on a triangular domain are investigated. Systems for which the\n1-excitation dynamics is exactly solvable are identified. The exact solutions\nare expressed in terms of the bivariate Krawtchouk polynomials that arise as\nmatrix elements of the unitary representations of the rotation group on the\nstates of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n", "  The Little Flavor model is a close cousin of the Little Higgs theory which\naims to generate flavor structure around TeV scale. While the original Little\nFlavor only included the quark sector, here we build the lepton part of the\nLittle Flavor model and explore its phenomenology. The model produces the\nneutrino mixing matrix and Majorana masses of the Standard Model neutrinos\nthrough coupling to heavy lepton partners and Little Higgses. We combine the\nusual right-handed seesaw mechanism with global symmetry protection to suppress\nthe Standard Model neutrino masses, and identify the TeV partners of leptons as\nright-handed Majorana neutrinos. The lepton masses and mixing matrix are\ncalculated perturbatively in the theory.\n  The TeV new gauge bosons have suppressed decay width in dilepton channels.\nEven assuming the Standard Model couplings, the branching ratios to normal\ndilepton channels are largely reduced in the model, to evade the bound from\ncurrent $Z'$ search. It also opens up the new search channels for exotic gauge\nbosons, especially Z' -> MET + multi L+jets. The multiple lepton partners will\ncreate new chain decay signals in flavor related processes in colliders, which\nalso give rise to flavor anomalies. The lepton flavor violation process can be\nhighly suppressed in charged lepton sector and happens only through neutrinos.\n", "  We discuss the non-self-averaging phenomena in the critical point of weakly\ndisordered Ising ferromagnet. In terms of the renormalized replica\nGinzburg-Landau Hamiltonian in dimensions D <4, we derive an explicit\nexpression for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the critical free\nenergy fluctuations. In particular, using known fixed-point values for the\nrenormalized coupling parameters, we obtain the universal curve for such PDF in\nthe dimension D=3. It is demonstrated that this function is strongly\nasymmetric: its left tail is much slower than the right one.\n", "  Theoretical analysis of a suspended nanomechanical membrane subject to an\noptical driving field in an optomechanical cavity is presented, which is\nconfirmed through numerical simulations. In the presence of an optical field\nbetween its mirrors, the high-finesse optomechanical resonator acts as an\noscillator driven by a radiation pressure force. The periodic nature of the\nradiation pressure force makes the nano-mechanical membrane in the\noptomechanical system as a kicked harmonic oscillator. Mathematically the\nphysical system displays a stochastic web map that helps to understand several\nproperties of the kicked membrane in classical phase space. We find that our\nweb map is area preserving and displays quasiperiodic symmetrical structures in\nphase space which we express as $q$-fold symmetry. It is shown that under\nappropriate control of certain parameters, namely the frequency ratio and the\nkicking strength, the dynamics of kicked membrane exhibits chaotic dynamics. We\nprovide the stability analysis by means of Lyapunov exponent and survival\nprobability.\n", "  Within the realm of QCD sum rules, one of the most important areas of\napplication of this nonperturbative approach is the prediction of the decay\nconstants of heavy mesons. However, in spite of the fact that, indisputably,\nthe adopted techniques are, of course, very similar, we encounter rather\ndissimilar challenges, or obstacles, when extracting from two-point correlators\nof appropriate heavy-light currents interpolating the mesons, the\ncharacteristics of charmed mesons with different spin. In view of this, it\nseems worthwhile to us to revisit this issue for the case of charmed\npseudoscalar mesons $D_{(s)}$ and vector mesons $D^*_{(s)}.$\n", "  We consider type IIB supergravity backgrounds corresponding to the deformed\nAdS_n x S^n supercoset string models of the type constructed in arXiv:1309.5850\nwhich depend on one deformation parameter \\k. In AdS_2 x S^2 case we find that\nthe deformed metric can be extended to a full supergravity solution with\nnon-trivial dilaton, RR scalar and RR 5-form strength. The solution depends on\na free parameter (called a) that should be chosen as a particular function of\n\\k to correspond to the deformed supercoset model. In AdS_3 x S^3 case the full\nsolution supported by the dilaton, RR scalar and RR 3-form strength exists only\nin the two special cases of a=0 and a=1. We conjecture that there may be a more\ngeneral one-parameter solution supported by several RR fields that for\nparticular a=a(\\k) corresponds to the supercoset model. In the most complicated\ndeformed AdS_5 x S^5 case we were able to find only the expressions for the\ndilaton and the RR scalar. The full solution is likely to be supported by a\ncombination of the 5-form and 3-form RR field strengths. We comment on the\nsingularity structure of the resulting metric and exact dilaton field.\n", "  The perturbative series for finite-temperature field theories has very poor\nconvergence properties and one needs a way to reorganize it. In this talk, I\nreview two ways of reorganizing the perturbative series for field theories at\nfinite temperature and chemical potential, namely hard-thermal-loop\nperturbation theory (HTLpt) and dimensional reduction (DR). I will present\nresults for the pressure, trace anomaly, speed of sound and the quark\nsusceptibilities from a 3-loop HTLpt calculation and for the quark\nsusceptibilities using DR at four loops. A careful comparison with available\nlattice data shows good agreement for a number of physical quantities.\n", "  This is the first of two articles aiming to introduce symplectic spinors into\nthe field of symplectic topology and the subject of Frobenius structures. After\nexhibiting a (tentative) axiomating setting for Frobenius structures resp.\n'Higgs pairs' in the context of symplectic spinors, we present immediate\nobservations concerning a local Schroedinger equation, the first structure\nconnection and the existence of 'spectrum', its topological interpretation and\nits connection to 'formality' which are valid for the case of standard\nFrobenius structures. We give a classification of the irreducibles and the\nindecomposables of the latter in terms of certain $U(n)$-reductions of the\n$G$-extension of the metaplectic frame bundle and a certain connection on it,\nwhere $G$ is the semi-direct product of the metaplectic group and the\nHeisenberg group, while the indecomposable case involves in addition the\ncombinatorial structure of the eigenstates of the $n$-dimensional harmonic\noscillator. In the second part, we associate an irreducible Frobenius structure\nto any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\\Phi$ on a cotangent bundle $T^*M$. The\nspectral Lagrangian in $T^*(T^*M)$ associated to this Frobenius structure\nintersects the zero-section $T^*M$ exactly at the fixed points of $\\Phi$. We\ngive lower bounds for the number of fixed points of $\\Phi$ by defining a\n$C^*$-valued function on $T^*\\tilde M$ defined by matrix coeficients of the\nHeisenberg group acting on spinors, where $\\tilde M$ is a certain\n'complexification' of $M$, whose critical points are in bijection to the fixed\npoints of $\\Phi$ resp. to the intersection of the spectral Lagrangian with the\nzero section $T^*\\tilde M$. We discuss how to define spectral invariants in the\nsense of Viterbo and Oh by lifting the above function to a real-valued function\non an appropriate cyclic covering of $T^*\\tilde M$ and using minimax-methods\nfor 'half-infinite' chains.\n", "  In this paper we will show that purely classical concepts based on a few\nheuristic considerations about extended field configurations are enough to\ncompute the leptonic magnetic moment with corrections in $\\alpha$-power\nperturbative expansion.\n", "  We present the outcomes of a very recent investigation of the decay constants\nof nonstrange and strange heavy-light beauty vector mesons, with special\nemphasis on the ratio of any such decay constant to the decay constant of the\ncorresponding pseudoscalar meson, by means of Borel-transformed QCD sum rules.\nOur results suggest that both these ratios are below unity.\n", "  We present a novel experimental design for high sensitivity measurements of\nthe electrical resistance of samples at high pressures (0-6GPa) and high\ntemperatures (300-1000K) in a 'Paris-Edinburgh' type large volume press.\nUniquely, the electrical measurements are carried out directly on a small\nsample, thus greatly increasing the sensitivity of the measurement. The\nsensitivity to even minor changes in electrical resistance can be used to\nclearly identify phase transitions in material samples. Electrical resistance\nmeasurements are relatively simple and rapid to execute and the efficacy of the\npresent experimental design is demonstrated by measuring the electrical\nresistance of Pb, Sn and Bi across a wide domain of temperature-pressure phase\nspace and employing it to identify the loci of phase transitions. Based on\nthese results, the phase diagrams of these elements are reconstructed to high\naccuracy and found to be in excellent agreement with previous studies. In\nparticular, by mapping the locations of several well-studied reference points\nin the phase diagram of Sn and Bi, it is demonstrated that a standard\ncalibration exists for the temperature and pressure, thus eliminating the need\nfor direct or indirect temperature and pressure measurements. The present\ntechnique will allow simple and accurate mapping of phase diagrams under\nextreme conditions and may be of particular importance in advancing studies of\nliquid state anomalies.\n", "  We classify and compute, by means of the six-dimensional embedding formalism\nin twistor space, all possible three-point functions in four dimensional\nconformal field theories involving bosonic or fermionic operators in\nirreducible representations of the Lorentz group. We show how to impose in this\nformalism constraints due to conservation of bosonic or fermionic currents. The\nnumber of independent tensor structures appearing in any three-point function\nis obtained by a simple counting. Using the Operator Product Expansion (OPE),\nwe can then determine the number of structures appearing in 4-point functions\nwith arbitrary operators. This procedure is independent of the way we take the\nOPE between pairs of operators, namely it is consistent with crossing symmetry,\nas it should be. An analytic formula for the number of tensor structures for\nthree-point correlators with two symmetric and an arbitrary bosonic\n(non-conserved) operators is found, which in turn allows to analytically\ndetermine the number of structures in 4-point functions of symmetric traceless\ntensors.\n", "  We propose a preimage attack against cryptographic hash functions based on\nthe speedup enabled by quantum computing. Preimage resistance is a fundamental\nproperty cryptographic hash functions must possess. The motivation behind this\nwork relies in the lack of conventional attacks against newly introduced hash\nschemes such as the recently elected SHA-3 standard. The proposed algorithm\nconsists of two parts: a classical one running in O(log |S|), where S\nrepresents the searched space, and a quantum part that contains the bulk of the\nDeutsch-Jozsa circuit. The mixed approach we follow makes use of the quantum\nparallelism concept to check the existence of an argument (preimage) for a\ngiven hash value (image) in the preestablished search space. For this purpose,\nwe explain how a non-unitary measurement gate can be used to determine if S\ncontains the target value. Our method is entirely theoretical and is based on\nthe assumptions that a hash function can be implemented by a quantum computer\nand the key measurement gate we describe is physically realizable. Finally, we\npresent how the algorithm finds a solution on S.\n", "  The complex Poynting theorem is extended canonically to a time-scale domain\n$(t, s)$ by replacing the phasors of time-harmonic fields by the analytic\nsignals $X(r, t+is)$ of fields $X(r,t)$ with general time dependence. The\nimaginary time $s>0$ is shown to play the role of a time resolution scale, and\nthe extended Poynting theorem splits into two conservation laws: its real part\ngives the conservation in $t$ of the scale-averaged active energy at fixed $s$,\nand its imaginary part gives the conservation in $s$ of the scale-averaged\nreactive energy at fixed $t$. At coarse scales (large $s$, slow time), where\nthe system reduces to the circuit level, this may have applications to the\ntheory of electric power transmission and conditioning. At fine scales (small\n$s$, fast time) it describes reactive energy dynamics in radiating systems.\n", "  Hierarchical networks are attracting a renewal interest for modelling the\norganization of a number of biological systems and for tackling the complexity\nof statistical mechanical models beyond mean-field limitations. Here we\nconsider the Dyson hierarchical construction for ferromagnets, neural networks\nand spin-glasses, recently analyzed from a statistical-mechanics perspective,\nand we focus on the topological properties of the underlying structures. In\nparticular, we find that such structures are weighted graphs that exhibit high\ndegree of clustering and of modularity, with small spectral gap; the robustness\nof such features with respect to link removal is also studied. These outcomes\nare then discussed and related to the statistical mechanics scenario in full\nconsistency. Lastly, we look at these weighted graphs as Markov chains and we\nshow that in the limit of infinite size, the emergence of ergodicity breakdown\nfor the stochastic process mirrors the emergence of meta-stabilities in the\ncorresponding statistical mechanical analysis.\n", "  Extreme ultraviolet frequency combs are a versatile tool with applications\nincluding precision measurement, strong-field physics, and solid-state physics.\nHere we report on an application of extreme ultraviolet frequency combs and\ntheir driving lasers for studying strong-field effects in molecular systems. We\nperform field-free molecular alignment and high-order harmonic generation with\naligned molecules in a gas jet at a repetition rate of 154 MHz using a\nhigh-powered optical frequency comb inside a femtosecond enhancement cavity.\nThe cavity-enhanced system provides a means to reach suitable intensities to\nstudy field-free molecular alignment and enhance the observable effects of the\nmolecule-field interaction. We observe modulations of the driving field,\narising from the nature of impulsive stimulated Raman scattering responsible\nfor coherent molecular rotations. We foresee the impact of this work on the\nstudy of molecule-based strong-field physics, with improved precision and a\nmore fundamental understanding of the interaction effects on both the field and\nmolecules.\n", "  We use an off-lattice discretization of fractional Brownian motion and a\nMetropolis Algorithm to determine the asymptotic scaling of this discretized\nfractional Brownian motion under the influence of an excluded volume as in the\nEdwards and Domb-Joyce models. We find a good agreement between the Flory index\ndescribing the scaling of end-to-end length with a mean field formula proposed\nearlier for this class of models.\n", "  We use results from time-frequency analysis and Gabor analysis to construct\nnew classes of sigma-model solitons over the Moyal plane and over\nnoncommutative tori, taken as source spaces, with a target space made of two\npoints. A natural action functional leads to self-duality equations for\nprojections in the source algebra. Solutions, having non-trivial topological\ncontent, are constructed via suitable Morita duality bimodules.\n", "  We review the recent progress in the applications of QCD sum rules to hadron\nproperties with the emphasis on the following selected problems: (i)\ndevelopment of new algorithms for the extraction of ground-state parameters\nfrom two-point correlators; (ii) form factors at large momentum transfers from\nthree-point vacuum correlation functions; (iii) properties of exotic tetraquark\nhadrons from correlation functions of four-quark currents.\n", "  The color X-ray camera SLcam(R) is a full-field, single photon detector\nproviding scanning free, energy and spatially resolved X-ray imaging. Spatial\nresolution is achieved with the use of polycapillary optics guiding X-ray\nphotons from small regions on a sample to distinct energy dispersive pixels on\na CCD. Applying sub-pixel resolution, signals from individual capillary\nchannels can be distinguished. Accordingly the SLcam(R) spatial resolution can\nbe released from pixel size being confined rather to a diameter of individual\npolycapillary channels. In this work a new approach to sub-pixel resolution\nalgorithm comprising photon events also from the pixel centers is proposed. The\ndetails of the employed numerical method and several sub-pixel resolution\nexamples are presented and discussed.\n", "  This paper focuses on the study of topological features in\nteleportation-based quantum computation as well as aims at presenting a\ndetailed review on teleportaiton-based quantum computation (Gottesman and\nChuang, Nature 402, 390, 1999). In the extended Temperley-Lieb diagrammatical\napproach, we clearly show that such topological features bring about the\nfault-tolerant construction of both universal quantum gates and four-partite\nentangled states more intuitive and simpler. Furthermore, we describe the\nYang--Baxter gate by its extended Temperley-Lieb configuration, and then study\nteleportation-based quantum circuit models using the Yang--Baxter gate.\nMoreover, we discuss the relationship between the extended Temperley-Lieb\ndiagrammatical approach and the Yang-Baxter gate approach. With these research\nresults, we propose a worthwhile subject, the extended Temperley-Lieb\ndiagrammatical approach, for physicists in quantum information and quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We demonstrate that photoconductivity of pristine rubrene crystals exhibits\nseveral distinct regimes, in which photocurrent as a function of cw (continuous\nwave) excitation intensity is described by a power law with exponents\nsequentially taking values 1, 1/3 and 1/4. We show that this photocurrent is\ngenerated almost exclusively at the surface of pristine rubrene crystals, while\nthe bulk photocurrent is dramatically smaller and follows a different set of\nexponents, 1 and 1/2. A model based on exciton fission, fusion and\ntriplet-charge quenching is developed to describe these non-trivial effects in\nphotoconductivity of highly ordered organic semiconductors.\n", "  The equitable presentation of the quantum superalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{osp}_q(1|2)$, in which all generators appear on an equal footing, is\nexhibited. It is observed that in their equitable presentations, the quantum\nalgebras $\\mathfrak{osp}_q(1|2)$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}_q(2)$ are related to one\nanother by the formal transformation $q\\rightarrow -q$. A $q$-analog of the\nBannai-Ito algebra is shown to arise as the covariance algebra of\n$\\mathfrak{osp}_q(1|2)$.\n", "  An asymmetry exists between time and space in the sense that physical systems\ninevitably evolve over time whereas there is no corresponding ubiquitous\ntranslation over space. The asymmetry, which is presumed to be elemental, is\nrepresented by equations of motion and conservation laws that operate\ndifferently over time and space. If, however, the asymmetry was found to be due\nto deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would need\nreworking. Here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation of\ntime reversal (T) symmetry might be such a cause. If T symmetry is obeyed, the\nformalism treats time and space symmetrically such that states of matter are\nlocalised both in space and in time. In this case, equations of motion and\nconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable. However if T symmetry is\nviolated, the same sum over paths formalism yields states that are localised in\nspace and distributed without bound over time, creating an asymmetry between\ntime and space. Moreover, the states satisfy an equation of motion (the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation) and conservation laws apply. This suggests that the\ntime-space asymmetry is not elemental as currently presumed, and that T\nviolation may have a deep connection with time evolution.\n", "  The inflationary paradigm is the most successful model that explains the\nobserved spectrum of primordial perturbations. However, the precise emergence\nof such inhomogeneities and the quantum-to-classical transition of the\nperturbations has not yet reached a consensus among the community. The\nContinuous Spontaneous Localization model (CSL), in the cosmological context,\nmight be used to provide a solution to the mentioned issues by considering a\ndynamical reduction of the wave function. The CSL model has been applied to the\ninflationary universe before and different conclusions have been obtained. In\nthis letter, we use a different approach to implement the CSL model during\ninflation. In particular, in addition to accounting for the\nquantum-to-classical transition, we use the CSL model to generate the\nprimordial perturbations, that is, the dynamical evolution provided by the CSL\nmodel is responsible for the transition from a homogeneous and isotropic\ninitial state to a final one lacking such symmetries. Our approach leads to\nresults that can be clearly distinguished from preceding works. Specifically,\nthe scalar and tensor power spectra are not time-dependent, and retains the\namplification mechanism of the CSL model. Moreover, our framework depends only\non one parameter (the CSL parameter) and its value is consistent with\ncosmological and laboratory observations.\n", "  We consider quantum MDS (QMDS) codes for quantum systems of dimension $q$\nwith lengths up to $q^2+2$ and minimum distances up to $q+1$. We show how\nstarting from QMDS codes of length $q^2+1$ based on cyclic and constacyclic\ncodes, new QMDS codes can be obtained by shortening. We provide numerical\nevidence for our conjecture that almost all admissible lengths, from a lower\nbound $n_0(q,d)$ on, are achievable by shortening. Some additional codes that\nfill gaps in the list of achievable lengths are presented as well along with a\nconstruction of a family of QMDS codes of length $q^2+2$, where $q=2^m$, that\nappears to be new.\n", "  According to Lovelock's theorem, the Hilbert-Einstein and the Lovelock\nactions are indistinguishable from their field equations. However, they have\ndifferent scalar-tensor counterparts, which correspond to the Brans-Dicke and\nthe \\emph{Lovelock-Brans-Dicke} (LBD) gravities, respectively. In this paper\nthe LBD model of alternative gravity with the Lagrangian density\n$\\mathscr{L}_{\\text{LBD}}=\\frac{1}{16\\pi}\\left[\\phi\\left( R\n+\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{-g}}{}^*RR +\nb\\mathcal{G}\\right)-\\frac{\\omega_{\\text{L}}}{\\phi}\\nabla_\\alpha \\phi\n\\nabla^\\alpha\\phi \\right]$ is developed, where ${}^*RR$ and $\\mathcal{G}$\nrespectively denote the topological Chern-Pontryagin and Gauss-Bonnet\ninvariants. The field equation, the kinematical and dynamical wave equations,\nand the constraint from energy-momentum conservation are all derived. It is\nshown that, the LBD gravity reduces to general relativity in the limit\n$\\omega_{\\text{L}}\\to\\infty$ unless the \"topological balance condition\" holds,\nand in vacuum it can be conformally transformed into the dynamical Chern-Simons\ngravity and the generalized Gauss-Bonnet dark energy with Horndeski-like or\nGalileon-like kinetics. Moreover, the LBD gravity allows for the late-time\ncosmic acceleration without dark energy. Finally, the LBD gravity is\ngeneralized into the Lovelock-scalar-tensor gravity, and its equivalence to\nfourth-order modified gravities is established. It is also emphasized that the\nstandard expressions for the contributions of generalized Gauss-Bonnet\ndependence can be further simplified.\n", "  We suggest a small set of fission observables to be used as test cases for\nvalidation of theoretical calculations. The purpose is to provide common data\nto facilitate the comparison of different fission theories and models. The\nproposed observables are chosen from fission barriers, spontaneous fission\nlifetimes, fission yield characteristics, and fission isomer excitation\nenergies.\n", "  Recently, a family of fermionic relations were discovered corresponding to\nPachner move 3-3 and parameterized by complex-valued 2-cocycles, where the\nweight of a pentachoron (4-simplex) is a Grassmann-Gaussian exponent. Here, the\nproportionality coefficient between Berezin integrals in the l.h.s. and r.h.s.\nof such relations is written in a form multiplicative over simplices.\n", "  We investigate the electromechanical coupling between a nanomechanical\nresonator and two parametrically coupled superconducting coplanar waveguide\ncavities that are driven by a two-mode squeezed microwave source. We show that,\nwith the selective coupling of the resonator to the cavity Bogoliubov modes,\nthe radiation-pressure type coupling can be greatly enhanced by several orders\nof magnitude, enabling the single photon strong coupling to be reached. This\nallows the investigation of a number of interesting phenomena such as photon\nblockade effects and the generation of nonclassical quantum states with\nelectromechanical systems.\n", "  [Abridged] Fullerenes have been recently detected in various circumstellar\nand interstellar environments, raising the question of their formation pathway.\nIt has been proposed that they can form by the photo-chemical processing of\nlarge polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Following our previous work on\nthe evolution of PAHs in the NGC 7023 reflection nebula, we evaluate, using\nphotochemical modeling, the possibility that the PAH C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (i.e.\ncircumovalene) can lead to the formation of C$_{60}$ upon irradiation by\nultraviolet photons. The chemical pathway involves full dehydrogenation,\nfolding into a floppy closed cage and shrinking of the cage by loss of C$_2$\nunits until it reaches the symmetric C$_{60}$ molecule. At 10\" from the\nilluminating star and with realistic molecular parameters, the model predicts\nthat 100% of C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ is converted into C$_{60}$ in $\\sim$ 10$^5$\nyears, a timescale comparable to the age of the nebula. Shrinking appears to be\nthe kinetically limiting step of the whole process. Hence, PAHs larger than\nC$_{66}$H$_{20}$ are unlikely to contribute significantly to the formation of\nC$_{60}$, while PAHs containing between 60 and 66 C atoms should contribute to\nthe formation of C$_{60}$ with shorter timescales, and PAHs containing less\nthan 60 C atoms will be destroyed. Assuming a classical size distribution for\nthe PAH precursors, our model predicts absolute abundances of C$_{60}$ are up\nto several $10^{-4}$ of the elemental carbon, i.e. less than a percent of the\ntypical interstellar PAH abundance, which is consistent with observational\nstudies. According to our model, once formed, C$_{60}$ can survive much longer\nthan other fullerenes because of the remarkable stability of the C$_{60}$\nmolecule at high internal energies.Hence, a natural consequence is that\nC$_{60}$ is more abundant than other fullerenes in highly irradiated\nenvironments.\n", "  Scintillation characteristics of undoped and Cu+-doped lithium tetraborate\nLi2B4O7 (LTB) were studied including optical transmittance, photoluminescence,\nradioluminescence for X- and gamma-rays, alpha/gamma ratio, and decay kinetics.\nThe total time-integrated LYs in undoped and Cu+-doped LTB for X-rays are ~600\nand ~760 ph/MeV (photons/MeV), respectively. The decay kinetics in undoped and\nCu+-doped LTB are similar to each other. Typical decay spectra for pulsed\nX-rays can be fitted with four exponentials: for fast (t1~0.8 ns, t2~25-50 ns),\nmedium (t3~300-400 ns), and slow (t4~20-30 ms) components. The slow component\noccupies about 60% of the total LY, while the fast ones less than 10%. The\n10-90% rise time was 163 ps. The alpha/gamma ratio was 0.18 for external 241Am\nalpha-rays. The obtained increase in LY due to Cu+ doping remains modest. The\nCu+-induced emission contains both fast and slow components, requiring further\nstudies of the emission mechanism to explain the fast component.\n", "  We apply the Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and recursive numerical integration\nmethods to evaluate the Euclidean, discretized time path-integral for the\nquantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator and a topological quantum mechanical\nrotor model. For the anharmonic oscillator both methods outperform standard\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo methods and show a significantly improved error\nscaling. For the quantum mechanical rotor we could, however, not find a\nsuccessful way employing QMC. On the other hand, the recursive numerical\nintegration method works extremely well for this model and shows an at least\nexponentially fast error scaling.\n", "  We live in a global village where electronic communication has eliminated the\ngeographical barriers of information exchange. The road is now open to\nworldwide convergence of information interests, shared values, and\nunderstanding. Nevertheless, interests still vary between countries around the\nworld. This raises important questions about what today's world map of in-\nformation interests actually looks like and what factors cause the barriers of\ninformation exchange between countries. To quantitatively construct a world map\nof information interests, we devise a scalable statistical model that\nidentifies countries with similar information interests and measures the\ncountries' bilateral similarities. From the similarities we connect countries\nin a global network and find that countries can be mapped into 18 clusters with\nsimilar information interests. Through regression we find that language and\nreligion best explain the strength of the bilateral ties and formation of\nclusters. Our findings provide a quantitative basis for further studies to\nbetter understand the complex interplay between shared interests and conflict\non a global scale. The methodology can also be extended to track changes over\ntime and capture important trends in global information exchange.\n", "  The Josephson effect describes the generic appearance of a supercurrent in a\nweak link between two superconductors. Its exact physical nature however deeply\ninfluences the properties of the supercurrent. Detailed studies of Josephson\njunctions can reveal microscopic properties of the superconducting pairing\n(spin-triplet correlations, $d$-wave symmetry) or of the electronic transport\n(quantum dot, ballistic channels). In recent years, considerable efforts have\nfocused on the coupling of superconductors to topological insulators, in which\ntransport is mediated by topologically protected Dirac surface states with\nhelical spin polarization (while the bulk remains insulating). Here, the\nproximity of a superconductor is predicted to give rise to unconventional\ninduced $p$-wave superconductivity, with a doublet of topologically protected\ngapless Andreev bound states, whose energies varies $4\\pi$-periodically with\nthe superconducting phase difference across the junction. In this article, we\nreport the observation of an anomalous response to rf irradiation in a\nJosephson junction with a weak link of the 3D topological insulator HgTe. The\nresponse is understood as due to a $4\\pi$-periodic contribution to the\nsupercurrent, and its amplitude is compatible with the expected contribution of\na gapless Andreev doublet.\n", "  T violation has previously been shown to induce destructive interference\nbetween different paths that the universe can take through time and leads to a\nnew quantum equation of motion called bievolution. Here we examine further\ndetails of the interference and clarify the conditions needed for the\nbievolution equation.\n", "  When the background density in a bounded plasma is modulated in time,\ndiscrete modes become coupled. Interestingly, for appropriately chosen\nmodulations, the average plasmon energy might be made to grow in a ladder-like\nmanner, achieving up-conversion or down-conversion of the plasmon energy. This\nreversible process is identified as a classical analog of the effect known as\nquantum ladder climbing, so that the efficiency and the rate of this process\ncan be written immediately by analogy to a quantum particle in a box. In the\nlimit of densely spaced spectrum, ladder climbing transforms into continuous\nautoresonance; plasmons may then be manipulated by chirped background\nmodulations much like electrons are autoresonantly manipulated by chirped\nfields. By formulating the wave dynamics within a universal Lagrangian\nframework, similar ladder climbing and autoresonance effects are predicted to\nbe achievable with general linear waves in both plasma and other media.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the torsional completion of gravitation for an\nunderlying background filled with Dirac fields, applying it to the problem of\nneutrino oscillations: we discuss the effects of the induced torsional\ninteractions as corrections to the neutrino oscillation mechanism.\n", "  We investigate a Gibbs (annealed) probability measure defined on Ising spin\nconfigurations on causal triangulations of the plane. We study the region where\nsuch measure can be defined and provide bounds on the boundary of this region\n(critical line). We prove that for any finite random triangulation the\nmagnetization of the central spin is sensitive of the boundary conditions.\nFurthermore, we show that in the infinite volume limit, the magnetization of\nthe central spin vanishes for values of the temperature high enough.\n", "  Cosmic ray muon tomography is a novel technology to detect high-Z material. A\nprototype of TUMUTY with 73.6 cm x 73.6 cm large scale position sensitive MRPC\ndetectors has been developed and is introduced in this paper. Three test kits\nhave been tested and image is reconstructed using MAP algorithm. The\nreconstruction results show that the prototype is working well and the objects\nwith complex structure and small size (20 mm) can be imaged on it, while the\nhigh-Z material is distinguishable from the low-Z one. This prototype provides\na good platform for our further studies of the physical characteristics and the\nperformances of cosmic ray muon tomography.\n", "  The LaBr3:Ce scintillator has been widely studied for nuclear spectroscopy\nbecause of its optimal energy resolution (<3%@ 662 keV) and time resolution\n(~300 ps). Despite these promising properties, the intrinsic radiation\nbackground of LaBr3:Ce is a critical issue, and pulse shape discrimination\n(PSD) has been shown to be an efficient potential method to suppress the alpha\nbackground from the 227Ac. In this paper, the charge comparison method (CCM)\nfor alpha and gamma discrimination in LaBr3:Ce is quantitatively analysed and\ncompared with two other typical PSD methods using digital pulse processing. The\nalgorithm parameters and discrimination efficiency are calculated for each\nmethod. Moreover, for the CCM, the correlation between the CCM feature value\ndistribution and the total charge (energy) is studied, and a fitting equation\nfor the correlation is inferred and experimentally verified. Using the\nequations, an energy-dependent threshold can be chosen to optimize the\ndiscrimination efficiency. Additionally, the experimental results show a\npotential application in low-activity high-energy {\\gamma} measurement by\nsuppressing the alpha background.\n", "  We analyze the electronic structure of molecules which may exist in gas phase\nof chemical vapor deposition process for GeSbTe alloy using the electronic\nstress tensor, with special focus on the chemical bonds between Ge, Sb and Te\natoms. We find that, from the viewpoint of the electronic stress tensor, they\nhave intermediate properties between alkali metals and hydrocarbon molecules.\nWe also study the correlation between the bond order which is defined based on\nthe electronic stress tensor, and energy-related quantities. We find that the\ncorrelation with the bond dissociation energy is not so strong while one with\nthe force constant is very strong. We interpret these results in terms of the\nenergy density on the \"Lagrange surface\", which is considered to define the\nboundary surface of atoms in a molecule in the framework of the electronic\nstress tensor analysis.\n", "  We show that the Dirac quantum cellular automaton [Ann. Phys. 354 (2015) 244]\nshares many properties in common with the discrete-time quantum walk. These\nsimilarities can be exploited to study the automaton as a unitary process that\ntakes place at regular time steps on a one-dimensional lattice, in the spirit\nof general quantum cellular automata. In this way, it becomes an alternative to\nthe quantum walk, with a dispersion relation that can be controlled by a\nparameter, which plays a similar role to the coin angle in the quantum walk.\nThe Dirac Hamiltonian is recovered under a suitable limit. We provide two\nindependent analytical approximations to the long term probability\ndistribution. It is shown that, starting from localized conditions, the\nasymptotic value of the entropy of entanglement between internal and motional\ndegrees of freedom overcomes the known limit that is approached by the quantum\nwalk for the same initial conditions, and are similar to the ones achieved by\nhighly localized states of the Dirac equation.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of a quantum field in a spherical shell around a\nstatic black hole. We implement brick wall regularization by imposing Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on the field at the boundaries and analyze their effects on\nthe free energy and the entropy. We also consider the possibility of using\nNeumann boundary conditions. We examine both bosonic and fermionic fields in\nSchwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN), extreme RN, and dilatonic\nbackgrounds. We show that the horizon divergences get contributions from the\nboundary (brick wall) which at the Hawking temperature are comparable to the\nbulk contributions. It is also shown that the leading divergence is the same\nfor all the backgrounds considered and that the subleading logarithmic\ndivergence is given by a specific function of surface gravity and horizon area.\nWe will also consider the near horizon geometry and show the existence of a\nfinite term gen- erated by the logarithmic divergence which involves the\nlogarithm of the horizon area. The thermodynamics of quantum fields is examined\nin the ultrarelavisitc regime through the high temperature/small mass\nexpansion. We derive the high temperature expansion in the presence of chemical\npotential by Mellin transform and heat kernel methods as applied to the\nharmonic sum representation of the free energy.\n", "  We demonstrate that due to strong modal interactions through cross-gain\nsaturation, the onset of a new lasing mode can switch off an existing mode via\na negative power slope. In this process of interaction-induced mode switching\n(IMS) the two involved modes maintain their identities, i.e. they do not change\ntheir spatial field patterns or lasing frequencies. For a fixed pump profile, a\nsimple analytic criterion for the occurrence of IMS is given in terms of their\nself- and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds, which\nis verified for the example of a two-dimensional microdisk laser. When the\nspatial pump profile is varied as the pump power is increased, IMS can be\ninduced even when it would not occur with a fixed pump profile, as we show for\ntwo coupled laser cavities. Our findings apply to steady-state lasing and are\nhence different from dynamical mode switching or hopping. IMS may have\npotential applications in robust and flexible all-optical switching.\n", "  The hidden ordered state of the frustrated pyrochlore oxide\nTb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ is possibly one of the two electric multipolar,\nor quadrupolar, states of the effective pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian derived from\ncrystal-field ground state doublets of non-Kramers Tb$^{3+}$ ions. These\nlong-range orders are antiparallel or parallel alignments of transverse\npseudospin components representing electric quadrupole moments, which cannot be\nobserved as magnetic Bragg reflections by neutron scattering. However\npseudospin waves of these states are composite waves of the magnetic-dipole and\nelectric-quadrupole moments, and can be partly observed by inelastic magnetic\nneutron scattering. We calculate these spin-quadrupole waves using linear\nspin-wave theory and discuss previously observed low-energy magnetic excitation\nspectra of a polycrystalline sample with $x = 0.005$ ($T_{\\text{c}} = 0.5 $ K).\n", "  We examine numerically and analytically the problem of the relativistic\nvelocity distribution in a 1-dim relativistic gas in thermal equilibrium. Our\nderivation is based on the special theory of relativity, the central limit\ntheorem and the Lobachevsky structure of the velocity space of the theory,\nwhere the rapidity variable plays a crucial role. For v^2/c^2 << 1 and 1/\\beta\n= k_B T/ m_0 c^2 << 1 the distribution tends to the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution.\n", "  We show how conformal partial waves (or conformal blocks) of spinor/tensor\ncorrelators can be related to each other by means of differential operators in\nfour dimensional conformal field theories. We explicitly construct such\ndifferential operators for all possible conformal partial waves associated to\nfour-point functions of arbitrary traceless symmetric operators. Our method\nallows any conformal partial wave to be extracted from a few \"seed\"\ncorrelators, simplifying dramatically the computation needed to bootstrap\ntensor correlators.\n", "  We experimentally study the dynamics of a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas\nthat is subject to a continuous outcoupling of atoms. Although standard\nevaporative cooling is rendered ineffective by the absence of thermalizing\ncollisions in this system, we observe substantial cooling. This cooling\nproceeds through homogeneous particle dissipation and many-body dephasing,\nenabling the preparation of otherwise unexpectedly low temperatures. Our\nobservations establish a scaling relation between temperature and particle\nnumber, and provide insights into equilibration in the quantum world.\n", "  The couplings between supermassive black-hole binaries and their environments\nwithin galactic nuclei have been well studied as part of the search for\nsolutions to the final parsec problem. The scattering of stars by the binary or\nthe interaction with a circumbinary disk may efficiently drive the system to\nsub-parsec separations, allowing the binary to enter a regime where the\nemission of gravitational waves can drive it to merger within a Hubble time.\nHowever, these interactions can also affect the orbital parameters of the\nbinary. In particular, they may drive an increase in binary eccentricity which\nsurvives until the system's gravitational-wave signal enters the pulsar-timing\narray band. Therefore, if we can measure the eccentricity from observed\nsignals, we can potentially deduce some of the properties of the binary\nenvironment. To this end, we build on previous techniques to present a general\nBayesian pipeline with which we can detect and estimate the parameters of an\neccentric supermassive black-hole binary system with pulsar-timing arrays.\nAdditionally, we generalize the pulsar-timing array $\\mathcal{F}_e$-statistic\nto eccentric systems, and show that both this statistic and the Bayesian\npipeline are robust when studying circular or arbitrarily eccentric systems. We\nexplore how eccentricity influences the detection prospects of single\ngravitational-wave sources, as well as the detection penalty incurred by\nemploying a circular waveform template to search for eccentric signals, and\nconclude by identifying important avenues for future study.\n", "  In this contribution we first review a method for obtaining the collective\nmodes of pair-correlated neutron matter as found in a neutron star inner crust.\nWe discuss two classes of modes corresponding to density and spin perturbations\nwith energy spectra $\\omega = \\omega_0 + \\alpha q^2$, where $\\omega_0 =\n2\\Delta$ is the threshold frequency and $\\Delta$ is the gap in the neutron\nfluid spectrum. For characteristic values of Landau parameters in neutron star\ncrusts the exitonic density modes have $\\alpha < 0$, therefore they live below\nthe pair-breaking continuum $\\omega_0$ and are undamped. For spin diffusive\nmodes $\\alpha > 0$ and they exist above $\\omega_0$ which implies that these\nmodes are damped. As an application of these findings we compute the thermal\nconductivity due to spin diffusive modes and show that it scales as $T^{1/2}\n\\exp(-2\\omega_0/T)$ in the case where their two-by-two scattering cross-section\nis weakly dependent on temperature.\n", "  I review some recent work on applications of category theory to questions\nconcerning theoretical structure and theoretical equivalence of classical field\ntheories, including Newtonian gravitation, general relativity, and Yang-Mills\ntheories.\n", "  We demonstrate the generation and detection of spin-torque ferromagnetic\nresonance in Pt/YIG bilayers. A unique attribute of this system is that the\nspin Hall effect lies at the heart of both the generation and detection\nprocesses and no charge current is passing through the insulating magnetic\nlayer. When the YIG undergoes resonance, a dc voltage is detected\nlongitudinally along the Pt that can be described by two components. One is the\nmixing of the spin Hall magnetoresistance with the microwave current. The other\nresults from spin pumping into the Pt being converted to a dc current through\nthe inverse spin Hall effect. The voltage is measured with applied magnetic\nfield directions that range in-plane to nearly perpendicular. We find that for\nmagnetic fields that are mostly out-of-plane, an imaginary component of the\nspin mixing conductance is required to model our data.\n", "  We investigate capacitively coupled two-qubit quantum gates based on quantum\ndots. For exchange-only coded qubits electron spin $S$ and its projection $S_z$\nare exact quantum numbers. Capacitive coupling between qubits, as distinct from\ninterqubit exchange, preserves these quantum numbers. We prove, both\nanalytically and numerically, that conservation of the spins of individual\nqubits has dramatic effect on performance of two-qubit gates. By varying the\nlevel splittings of individual qubits, $J_a$ and $J_b$, and the interqubit\ncoupling time $t$, we can find an infinite number of triples $(J_a, J_b, t)$\nfor which the two-qubit entanglement, in combination with appropriate\nsingle-qubit rotations, can produce an exact CNOT gate. This statement is true\nfor practically arbitrary magnitude and form of capacitive interqubit coupling.\nOur findings promise a large decrease in the number of nonlocal (two-qubit)\noperations in quantum circuits.\n", "  Ground states of interacting QFTs are non-gaussian states, i.e. their\nconnected n-point correlation functions do not vanish for n>2, in contrast to\nthe free QFT case. We show that when the ground state of an interacting QFT\nevolves under a free massive QFT for a long time (a scenario that can be\nrealised by a Quantum Quench), the connected correlation functions decay and\nall local physical observables equilibrate to values that are given by a\ngaussian density matrix that keeps memory only of the two-point initial\ncorrelation function. The argument hinges upon the fundamental physical\nprinciple of cluster decomposition, which is valid for the ground state of a\ngeneral QFT. An analogous result was already known to be valid in the case of\nd=1 spatial dimensions, where it is a special case of the so-called Generalised\nGibbs Ensemble (GGE) hypothesis, and we now generalise it to higher dimensions.\nMoreover in the case of massless free evolution, despite the fact that the\nevolution may not lead to equilibration but unbounded increase of correlations\nwith time instead, the GGE gives correctly the leading order asymptotic\nbehaviour of correlation functions in the thermodynamic and large time limit.\nThe demonstration is performed in the context of bosonic relativistic QFT, but\nthe arguments apply more generally.\n", "  A search is performed for narrow resonances decaying into $WW$, $WZ$, or $ZZ$\nboson pairs using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. Diboson resonances with masses in the range from 1.3\nto 3.0 TeV are sought after using the invariant mass distribution of dijets\nwhere both jets are tagged as a boson jet, compatible with a highly boosted $W$\nor $Z$ boson decaying to quarks, using jet mass and substructure properties.\nThe largest deviation from a smoothly falling background in the observed dijet\ninvariant mass distribution occurs around 2 TeV in the $WZ$ channel, with a\nglobal significance of 2.5 standard deviations. Exclusion limits at the 95%\nconfidence level are set on the production cross section times branching ratio\nfor the $WZ$ final state of a new heavy gauge boson, $W'$, and for the $WW$ and\n$ZZ$ final states of Kaluza--Klein excitations of the graviton in a bulk\nRandall--Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass. $W'$ bosons with\ncouplings predicted by the extended gauge model in the mass range from 1.3 to\n1.5 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.\n", "  We give an AdS/CFT interpretation to homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of\nthe AdS_5 x S^5 superstring as noncommutative deformations of the dual gauge\ntheory, going well beyond the canonical noncommutative case. These homogeneous\nYang-Baxter deformations can be of so-called abelian or jordanian type. While\nabelian deformations have a clear interpretation in string theory and many\nalready had well understood gauge theory duals, jordanian deformations appear\nnovel on both counts. We discuss the symmetry structure of the deformed string\nfrom the uniformizing perspective of Drinfeld twists and indicate that this\nstructure can be realized on the gauge theory side by considering theories on\nvarious noncommutative spaces. We then conjecture that these are the gauge\ntheory duals of our strings, modulo subtleties involving singularities. We\nsupport this conjecture by a brane construction for two jordanian examples,\ncorresponding to noncommutative spaces with [x^-,x^i] ~ x^i (i=1,2). We also\ndiscuss kappa-Minkowski type deformations of AdS_5 x S^5, one of which may be\nthe gravity dual of gauge theory on spacelike kappa-Minkowski space.\n", "  Localization transitions as a function of temperature require a many-body\nmobility edge in energy, separating localized from ergodic states. We argue\nthat this scenario is inconsistent because local fluctuations into the ergodic\nphase within the supposedly localized phase can serve as mobile bubbles that\ninduce global delocalization. Such fluctuations inevitably appear with a low\nbut finite density anywhere in any typical state. We conclude that the only\npossibility for many-body localization to occur are lattice models that are\nlocalized at all energies. Building on a close analogy with a model of assisted\ntwo-particle hopping, where interactions induce delocalization, we argue why\nhot bubbles are mobile and do not localize upon diluting their energy.\nNumerical tests of our scenario show that previously reported mobility edges\ncannot be distinguished from finite-size effects.\n", "  Supermassive black hole binaries are one of the primary targets for\ngravitational wave searches using pulsar timing arrays. Gravitational wave\nsignals from such systems are well represented by parametrized models, allowing\nthe standard Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) to be used for their\ndetection and estimation. However, there is a dichotomy in how the GLRT can be\nimplemented for pulsar timing arrays: there are two possible ways in which one\ncan split the set of signal parameters for semi-analytical and numerical\nextremization. The straightforward extension of the method used for continuous\nsignals in ground-based gravitational wave searches, where the so-called pulsar\nphase parameters are maximized numerically, was addressed in an earlier paper\n(Wang et al. 2014). In this paper, we report the first study of the performance\nof the second approach where the pulsar phases are maximized semi-analytically.\nThis approach is scalable since the number of parameters left over for\nnumerical optimization does not depend on the size of the pulsar timing array.\nOur results show that, for the same array size (9 pulsars), the new method\nperforms somewhat worse in parameter estimation, but not in detection, than the\nprevious method where the pulsar phases were maximized numerically. The origin\nof the performance discrepancy is likely to be in the ill-posedness that is\nintrinsic to any network analysis method. However, scalability of the new\nmethod allows the ill-posedness to be mitigated by simply adding more pulsars\nto the array. This is shown explicitly by taking a larger array of pulsars.\n", "  Since quantum field theories do not possess proper position observables,\nUnruh-DeWitt detector models serve as a key theoretical tool for extracting\nlocalized spatio-temporal information from quantum fields. Most studies have\nbeen limited, however, to Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that are coupled\nlinearly to a scalar bosonic field. Here, we investigate UDW detector models\nthat probe fermionic as well as bosonic fields through both linear and\nquadratic couplings. In particular, we present a renormalization method that\ncures persistent divergencies of prior models. We then show how perturbative\ncalculations with UDW detectors can be streamlined through the use of extended\nFeynman rules that include localized detector-field interactions.Our findings\npave the way for the extension of previous studies of the Unruh and Hawking\neffects with UDW detectors, and provide new tools for studies in relativistic\nquantum information, for example, regarding relativistic quantum communication\nand studies of the entanglement structure of the fermionic vacuum.\n", "  We study a highly controllable perfect plasmonic absorber -- a thin\nmetamaterial layer which possess balanced electric and magnetic responses in\nsome frequency range. We show that this regime is compatible with both\nmetal-backed variant of the structure or its semitransparent variant. This\nregime can be implemented in a prospective thin-film photovoltaic cell with\nnegligible parasitic losses.\n", "  In this work, we provide 2189 photometric- and kinematic-selected member\ncandidates of 24 star clusters from the LAMOST DR2 catalog. We perform two-step\nmembership identification: selection along the stellar track in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram, i.e., photometric identification, and the selection\nfrom the distribution of radial velocities, i.e. the kinematic identification.\nWe find that the radial velocity from the LAMOST data are very helpful in the\nmembership identification. The mean probability of membership is 40\\% for the\nradial velocity selected sample. With these 24 star clusters, we investigate\nthe performance of the radial velocity and metallicity estimated in the LAMOST\npipeline. We find that the systematic offset in radial velocity and metallicity\nare $0.85\\pm1.26$\\,\\kms\\ and $-0.08\\pm0.04$\\,dex, with dispersions of\n$5.47_{-0.71}^{+1.16}$\\,\\kms\\ and $0.13_{-0.02}^{+0.04}$\\,dex, respectively.\nFinally, we propose that the photometric member candidates of the clusters\ncovered by the LAMOST footprints should be assigned higher priority so that\nmore member stars can be observed.\n", "  We present the systematic analysis of the behavior of elastic pp scattering\ncross section in the region of the diffraction peak and the first diffraction\nminimum in the framework of quasi-eikonal Gribov-Regge approach, taking into\naccount the unitarity condition. We use the formalism taking into consideration\nthe dependence of pomeron signature factor on $t$. We show that although in\nthis approach one can describe the general features of pp scattering, the\nbehavior of pp elastic differential cross section in the vicinity of the first\ndiffraction minimum measured by the TOTEM experiment at LHC can not be\nreproduced under any parameter values at standard assumptions of the model.\nPhysically, in the quasi-eikonal Regge approach the proton proved to be \"gray\"\nand rather large, whereas the TOTEM data indicate that it is smaller and closer\nto \"black\" at LHC energies.\n", "  If the inflationary era is preceded by a radiation dominated era in which the\ninflaton too was in thermal equilibrium at some very early time then the CMB\ndata places an upper bound on the comoving temperature of the (decoupled)\ninflaton quanta. In addition, if one considers models of \"just enough\"\ninflation, where the number of e-foldings of inflation is just enough to solve\nthe horizon and flatness problems, then we get a lower bound on the Hubble\nparameter during inflation, $H_{\\rm inf}$, which is in severe conflict with the\nupper bound from tensor perturbations. Alternatively, imposing the upper bound\non $H_{\\rm inf}$ implies that such scenarios are compatible with the data only\nif the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the thermal bath in the\npre-inflationary Universe is extremely large (greater than $10^9$ or\n$10^{11})$. We are not aware of scenarios in which this can be satisfied.\n", "  Many extensions of the Standard Model include axions or axion-like particles\n(ALPs). Here we study ALP to photon conversion in the magnetic field of the\nMilky Way and starburst galaxies. By modelling the effects of the coherent and\nrandom magnetic fields, the warm ionized medium and the warm neutral medium on\nthe conversion process, we simulate maps of the conversion probability across\nthe sky for a range of ALP energies. In particular, we consider a diffuse\ncosmic ALP background (CAB) analogous to the CMB, whose existence is suggested\nby string models of inflation. ALP-photon conversion of a CAB in the magnetic\nfields of galaxy clusters has been proposed as an explanation of the cluster\nsoft X-ray excess. We therefore study the phenomenology and expected photon\nsignal of CAB propagation in the Milky Way. We find that, for the CAB\nparameters required to explain the cluster soft X-ray excess, the photon flux\nfrom ALP-photon conversion in the Milky Way would be unobservably small. The\nALP-photon conversion probability in galaxy clusters is 3 orders of magnitude\nhigher than that in the Milky Way. Furthermore, the morphology of the\nunresolved cosmic X-ray background is incompatible with a significant component\nfrom ALP-photon conversion. We also consider ALP-photon conversion in starburst\ngalaxies, which host much higher magnetic fields. By considering the clumpy\nstructure of the galactic plasma, we find that conversion probabilities\ncomparable to those in clusters may be possible in starburst galaxies.\n", "  Detecting a single photon without absorbing it is a long standing challenge\nin quantum optics. All experiments demonstrating the nondestructive detection\nof a photon make use of a high quality cavity. We present a cavity free scheme\nfor nondestructive single-photon detection. By pumping a nonlinear medium we\nimplement an inter-field Rabi-oscillation which leads to a ?pi phase shift on\nweak probe coherent laser field in the presence of a single signal photon\nwithout destroying the signal photon. Our cavity-free scheme operates with a\nfast intrinsic time scale in comparison with similar cavity-based schemes. We\nimplement a full real-space multimode numerical analysis of the interacting\nphotonic modes and confirm the validity of our nondestructive scheme in the\nmultimode case.\n", "  We compute the virial coefficients, the contact parameters, and the momentum\ndistribution of a strongly interacting three-dimensional Bose gas by means of a\nvirial expansion up to third order in the fugacity, which takes into account\nthree-body correlations exactly. Our results characterize the nondegenerate\nregime of the interacting Bose gas, where the thermal wavelength is smaller\nthan the interparticle spacing but the scattering length may be arbitrarily\nlarge. We observe a rapid variation of the third virial coefficient as the\nscattering length is tuned across the three-atom and the atom-dimer thresholds.\nThe momentum distribution at unitarity displays a universal high-momentum tail\nwith a log-periodic momentum dependence, which is a direct signature of Efimov\nphysics. We provide a quantitative description of the momentum distribution at\nhigh momentum as measured by P. Makotyn et al. [Nat. Phys. 10, 116 (2014)], and\nour calculations indicate that the lowest trimer state might not be occupied in\nthe experiment. Our results allow for a spectroscopy of Efimov states in the\nunitary limit.\n", "  We argue that with an increase of the collision energy, elastic\nphotoproduction of $\\rho$ mesons on nuclei becomes affected by the significant\ncross section of photon inelastic diffraction into large masses, which results\nin the sizable inelastic nuclear shadowing correction to $\\sigma_{\\gamma A \\to\n\\rho A}$ and the reduced effective $\\rho$-nucleon cross section. We take these\neffects into account by combining the vector meson dominance model, which we\nupgrade to include the contribution of high-mass fluctuations of the photon\naccording to QCD constraints, and the Gribov-Glauber approximation for nuclear\nshadowing, where the inelastic nuclear shadowing is included by means of cross\nsection fluctuations. The resulting approach allows us to successfully describe\nthe data on elastic $\\rho$ photoproduction on nuclei in heavy ion UPCs in the\n$7 \\ {\\rm GeV} < W_{\\gamma p} < 46$ GeV energy range and to predict the value\nof the cross section of coherent $\\rho$ photoproduction in Pb-Pb UPCs at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV in Run 2 at the LHC, $d\\sigma_{Pb Pb \\to \\rho Pb Pb}\n(y=0)/dy= 560 \\pm 25$ mb.\n", "  We determine the asymptotic dynamics of the U(N) doubly periodic BPS monopole\nin Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, called a monopole wall, by exploring its Higgs\ncurve using the Newton polytope and amoeba. In particular, we show that the\nmonopole wall splits into subwalls when any of its moduli become large. The\nlong-distance gauge and Higgs field interactions of these subwalls are abelian,\nallowing us to derive an asymptotic metric for the monopole wall moduli space.\n", "  A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into a b-bbar quark pair and\nproduced in association with at least one additional b quark is presented. This\nsignature is sensitive to the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (MSSM) with large values of the parameter tan(beta). The\nanalysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The results are combined with\na previous analysis based on 7 TeV data. No signal is observed. Stringent upper\nlimits on the cross section times branching fraction are derived for Higgs\nbosons with masses up to 900 GeV, and the results are interpreted within\ndifferent MSSM benchmark scenarios, m[h,max], m[h,mod+], m[h,mod-], light-stau\nand light-stop. Observed 95% confidence level upper limits on tan(beta),\nranging from 14 to 50, are obtained in the m[h,mod+] benchmark scenario.\n", "  We present TRIQS/CTHYB, a state-of-the art open-source implementation of the\ncontinuous-time hybridisation expansion quantum impurity solver of the TRIQS\npackage. This code is mainly designed to be used with the TRIQS library in\norder to solve the self-consistent quantum impurity problem in a multi-orbital\ndynamical mean field theory approach to strongly-correlated electrons, in\nparticular in the context of realistic calculations. It is implemented in C++\nfor efficiency and is provided with a high-level Python interface. The code is\nships with a new partitioning algorithm that divides the local Hilbert space\nwithout any user knowledge of the symmetries and quantum numbers of the\nHamiltonian. Furthermore, we implement higher-order configuration moves and\nshow that such moves are necessary to ensure ergodicity of the Monte Carlo in\ncommon Hamiltonians even without symmetry-breaking.\n", "  This work provide a thorough study of L\\'evy or heavy-tailed random matrices\n(LM). By analysing the self-consistent equation on the probability distribution\nof the diagonal elements of the resolvent we establish the equation determining\nthe localisation transition and obtain the phase diagram of LMs. Using\narguments based on super-symmetric field theory and Dyson Brownian motion we\nshow that the eigenvalue statistics is the same one of the Gaussian Orthogonal\nEnsemble in the whole delocalised phase and is Poisson in the localised phase.\nOur numerics confirms these findings, valid in the limit of infinitely large\nLMs, but also reveals that the characteristic scale governing finite size\neffects diverges much faster than a power law approaching the transition and is\nalready very large far from it. This leads to a very wide cross-over region in\nwhich the system looks as if it were in a mixed phase. Our results, together\nwith the ones obtained previously, provide now a complete theory of L\\'evy\nmatrices.\n", "  The dynamical analysis for coupled dark energy with dark matter is presented,\nwhere a complex scalar field is taken into account and it is considered in the\npresence of a barothropic fluid. We consider three dark energy candidates:\nquintessence, phantom and tachyon. The critical points are found and their\nstabilities analyzed, leading to the three cosmological eras (radiation, matter\nand dark energy), for a generic potential. The results presented here enlarge\nthe previous analyses found in the literature.\n", "  We compare two calculations of the particle density in the superfluid phase\nof the classical XY model with a chemical potential $\\mu$ in 1+1 dimensions.The\nfirst relies on exact blocking formulas from the Tensor Renormalization Group\n(TRG) formulation of the transfer matrix. The second is a worm algorithm. We\nshow that the particle number distributions obtained with the two methods agree\nwell. We use the TRG method to calculate the thermal entropy and the\nentanglement entropy. We describe the particle density, the two entropies and\nthe topology of the world lines as we increase $\\mu$ to go across the\nsuperfluid phase between the first two Mott insulating phases. For a\nsufficiently large temporal size, this process reveals an interesting fine\nstructure: the average particle number and the winding number of most of the\nworld lines in the Euclidean time direction increase by one unit at a time. At\neach step, the thermal entropy develops a peak and the entanglement entropy\nincreases until we reach half-filling and then decreases in a way that\napproximately mirror the ascent. This suggests an approximate fermionic\npicture.\n", "  We show that boundaries of 3D weak topological insulators can become gapped\nby strong interactions while preserving all symmetries, leading to Abelian\nsurface topological order. The anomalous nature of the weak topological\ninsulators manifests itself in a non-trivial action of symmetries on the\nquasiparticles; most strikingly, translations change the anyon types in a\nmanner impossible in strictly 2D systems with the same symmetry. As a further\nconsequence, screw dislocations form non-Abelian defects that trap\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermion zero modes.\n", "  While recent supernova cosmology research has benefited from improved\nmeasurements, current analysis approaches are not statistically optimal and\nwill prove insufficient for future surveys. This paper discusses the\nlimitations of current supernova cosmological analyses in treating outliers,\nselection effects, shape- and color-standardization relations, unexplained\ndispersion, and heterogeneous observations. We present a new Bayesian\nframework, called UNITY (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY),\nthat incorporates significant improvements in our ability to confront these\neffects. We apply the framework to real supernova observations and demonstrate\nsmaller statistical and systematic uncertainties. We verify earlier results\nthat SNe Ia require nonlinear shape and color standardizations, but we now\ninclude these nonlinear relations in a statistically well-justified way. This\nanalysis was primarily performed blinded, in that the basic framework was first\nvalidated on simulated data before transitioning to real data. We also discuss\npossible extensions of the method.\n", "  Lying at the heart of quantum mechanics, coherence has recently been studied\nas a key resource in quantum information theory. Quantum steering, a\nfundamental notion originally considered by Schr{\\\"o}dinger, has also recently\nreceived much attention. When Alice and Bob share a correlated quantum system,\nAlice can perform a local measurement to `steer' Bob's reduced state. We\nintroduce the maximal steered coherence as a measure describing the extent to\nwhich steering can remotely create coherence; more precisely, we find the\nmaximal coherence of Bob's steered state in the eigenbasis of his original\nreduced state, where maximization is performed over all positive-operator\nvalued measurements for Alice. We prove that maximal steered coherence vanishes\nfor quantum-classical states whilst reaching a maximum for pure entangled\nstates with full Schmidt rank. Although invariant under local unitary\noperations, maximal steered coherence may be increased when Bob performs a\nchannel. For a two-qubit state we find that Bob's channel can increase maximal\nsteered coherence if and only if it is neither unital nor semi-classical, which\ncoincides with the condition for increasing discord. Our results show that the\npower of steering for coherence generation, though related to discord, is\ndistinct from existing measures of quantum correlation.\n", "  The ion energies and fluxes in the high power impulse magnetron sputtering\nplasma from a Nb target were analysed angularly resolved along the tangential\ndirection of the racetrack. A reactive oxygen-containing atmosphere was used as\nsuch discharge conditions are typically employed for the synthesis of thin\nfilms. Asymmetries in the flux distribution of the recorded ions as well as\ntheir energies and charge states were noticed when varying the angle between\nmass-energy analyser and target surface. More positively charged ions with\nhigher count rates in the medium energy range of their distributions were\ndetected in $+\\mathbf{E}\\times \\mathbf{B}$ than in $-\\mathbf{E}\\times\n\\mathbf{B}$ direction, thus confirming the notion that ionisation zones (also\nknown as spokes or plasma bunches) are associated with moving potential humps.\nThe motion of the recorded negatively charged high-energy oxygen ions was\nunaffected. NbO$_x$ thin films at different angles and positions were\nsynthesised and analysed as to their structure and properties in order to\ncorrelate the observed plasma properties to the film growth conditions. The\nchemical composition and the film thickness varied with changing deposition\nangle, where the latter, similar to the ion fluxes, was higher in\n$+\\mathbf{E}\\times \\mathbf{B}$ than in $-\\mathbf{E}\\times \\mathbf{B}$\ndirection.\n", "  We introduce a new exponential family of probability distributions, which can\nbe viewed as a multivariate generalization of the Inverse Gaussian\ndistribution. Considered as the potential of a random Schr\\\"odinger operator,\nthis exponential family is related to the random field that gives the mixing\nmeasure of the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process (VRJP), and hence to the mixing\nmeasure of the Edge Reinforced Random Walk (ERRW), the so-called magic formula.\nIn particular, it yields by direct computation the value of the normalizing\nconstants of these mixing measures, which solves a question raised by Diaconis.\nThe results of this paper are instrumental in [Sabot-Zeng,2015], where several\nproperties of the VRJP and the ERRW are proved, in particular a functional\ncentral limit theorem in transient regimes, and recurrence of the 2-dimensional\nERRW.\n", "  We study how quantum and thermal noise affects synchronization of two\noptomechanical limit-cycle oscillators. Classically, in the absence of noise,\noptomechanical systems tend to synchronize either in-phase or anti-phase.\nTaking into account the fundamental quantum noise, we find a regime where\nfluctuations drive transitions between these classical synchronization states.\nWe investigate how this \"mixed\" synchronization regime emerges from the\nnoiseless system by studying the classical-to-quantum crossover and we show how\nthe time scales of the transitions vary with the effective noise strength. In\naddition, we compare the effects of thermal noise to the effects of quantum\nnoise.\n", "  In very intense electromagnetic fields, the vacuum refractive index is\nexpected to be modified due to nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED)\nproperties. Several experimental tests using high intensity lasers have been\nproposed to observe electromagnetic nonlinearities in vacuum, such as the\ndiffraction or the reflection of intense laser pulses. We propose a new\napproach which consists in observing the refraction, i.e. the rotation of the\nwaveplanes of a probe laser pulse crossing a transverse vacuum index gradient.\nThe latter is produced by the interaction of two very intense and ultra short\nlaser pulses, used as pump pulses. At the maximum of the index gradient, the\nrefraction angle of the probe pulse is estimated to be $0.2 \\times\n(\\frac{w_0}{10 \\mathrm{\\mu m}})^{-3} \\times \\frac{I}{1\n\\mathrm{J}}$~picoradians, where $I$ is the total energy of the two pump pulses\nand $w_0$ is the minimum waist (fwhm) at the interaction area. Assuming the\nmost intense laser pulses attainable by the LASERIX facility ($I = 25$~J, 30~fs\nfwhm duration, 800~nm central wavelength) and assuming a minimum waist of $w=10\n\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ (fwhm) (corresponding to an intensity of the order of\n$10^{21}$~W/cm$^2$), the expected maximum refraction angle is about\n5~picoradians. An experimental setup, using a Sagnac interferometer, is\nproposed to perform this measurement.\n", "  An approach to homogenization of high porosity metallic foams is explored.\nThe emphasis is on the \\Alporas{} foam and its representation by means of\ntwo-dimensional wire-frame models. The guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the\neffective properties are derived by the first-order homogenization with the\nuniform and minimal kinematic boundary conditions at heart. This is combined\nwith the method of Wang tilings to generate sufficiently large material samples\nalong with their finite element discretization. The obtained results are\ncompared to experimental and numerical data available in literature and the\nsuitability of the two-dimensional setting itself is discussed.\n", "  We propose and characterize a quantum interface between telecommunication\nwavelengths (1311 nm) and an Yb-dipole transition (369.5 nm) based on a second\norder sum frequency process in a PPKTP waveguide. An external (internal)\nconversion efficiency above 5% (10%) is shown using classical bright light.\n", "  Standard procedures for local crystal-structure optimisation involve numerous\nenergy and force calculations. It is common to calculate an energy-volume\ncurve, fitting an equation of state around the equilibrium cell volume. This is\na computationally intensive process, in particular for low-symmetry crystal\nstructures where each isochoric optimisation involves energy minimisation over\nmany degrees of freedom. Such procedures can be prohibitive for non-local\nexchange-correlation functionals or other 'beyond' density functional theory\nelectronic structure techniques, particularly where analytical gradients are\nnot available. We present a simple approach for efficient optimisation of\ncrystal structures based on a known equation of state. The equilibrium volume\ncan be predicted from one single-point calculation, and refined with successive\ncalculations if required. The approach is validated for PbS, PbTe, ZnS and ZnTe\nusing nine density functionals, and applied to the quaternary semiconductor\nCu$_{2}$ZnSnS$_{4}$ and the magnetic metal-organic framework HKUST-1.\n", "  In this paper we introduce Parity-Time ($\\cal PT$) symmetric perturbation to\na one-dimensional Lieb lattice, which is otherwise $\\cal P$-symmetric and has a\nflat band. In the flat band there are a multitude of degenerate dark states,\nand the degeneracy $N$ increases with the system size. We show that the\ndegeneracy in the flat band is completely lifted due to the non-Hermitian\nperturbation in general, but it is partially maintained with the\nhalf-gain-half-loss perturbation and its ``V\" variant that we consider. With\nthese perturbations, we show that both randomly positioned states and pinned\nstates at the symmetry plane in the flat band can undergo thresholdless $\\cal\nPT$ breaking. They are distinguished by their different rates of acquiring\nnon-Hermicity as the $\\cal PT$-symmetric perturbation grows, which are\ninsensitive to the system size. Using a degenerate perturbation theory, we\nderive analytically the rate for the pinned states, whose spatial profiles are\nalso insensitive to the system size. Finally, we find that the presence of weak\ndisorder has a strong effect on modes in the dispersive bands but not on those\nin the flat band. The latter respond in completely different ways to the\ngrowing $\\cal PT$-symmetric perturbation, depending on whether they are\nrandomly positioned or pinned.\n", "  Superconductivity of doped SrTiO3 is proven to be a particular case of the\nbroader concept of the non-adiabatic pairing mediated by phonons with frequency\ncomparable or larger the Fermi energy. We argue that, for carrier\nconcentrations exceeding that of the mobility edge, the superconductivity of\ndoped SrTiO3 is mediated by interaction of electrons with several longitudinal\n(LO) optical polar phonons. The electronic spectrum of SrTiO3 consists at low\ntemperatures of three conduction bands which are successively doped. Each band\ncontributes to the Cooper instability and exhibits a superconducting gap in the\nenergy spectrum. The theory presented below predicts maxima in dependence of\nTc(n)-the transition temperature on n, the number of electrons owing to the\nfollowing mechanism. Doping by electrons increases density of states at the\nFermi surface and Tc initially grows up. At the same time, screening on the\npart of accumulating charges tends to reduce amplitude of the electrical fields\ninherent in LO phonon modes and at larger concentrations the matrix element of\ninteraction between electrons and LO phonons decreases. The compromise between\nthe two tendencies leads to maxima in the Tc(n)-dependence providing\ninterpretation to one of the most intriguing experimental findings in Xiao Lin\net al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 207002 (2014)]. Having reached a maximum in the\nthird band, the superconducting transition finally decreases, rounding out the\nTc(n)-dome, the three maxima in Tc(n)with accompanying superconducting gaps\nemerging consecutively as electrons fill successive bands. This arises from\nattributes of the LO optical phonon pairing mechanism. More generally, the\nmechanism opens prospect of increasing temperature of the superconducting\ntransition in transition-metals oxides and other polar crystals.\n", "  The non-Gaussian nature of the epoch of reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal has a\nsignificant impact on the error variance of its power spectrum $P({\\bf\n\\textit{k}})$. We have used a large ensemble of semi-numerical simulations and\nan analytical model to estimate the effect of this non-Gaussianity on the\nentire error-covariance matrix ${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$. Our analytical model shows\nthat ${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$ has contributions from two sources. One is the usual\nvariance for a Gaussian random field which scales inversely of the number of\nmodes that goes into the estimation of $P({\\bf \\textit{k}})$. The other is the\ntrispectrum of the signal. Using the simulated 21-cm signal ensemble, an\nensemble of the randomized signal and ensembles of Gaussian random ensembles we\nhave quantified the effect of the trispectrum on the error variance\n${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$. We find that its relative contribution is comparable to\nor larger than that of the Gaussian term for the $k$ range $0.3 \\leq k \\leq 1.0\n\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and can be even $\\sim 200$ times larger at $k \\sim 5\\, {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$. We also establish that the off-diagonal terms of\n${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$ have statistically significant non-zero values which arise\npurely from the trispectrum. This further signifies that the error in different\n$k$ modes are not independent. We find a strong correlation between the errors\nat large $k$ values ($\\ge 0.5 \\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), and a weak correlation\nbetween the smallest and largest $k$ values. There is also a small\nanti-correlation between the errors in the smallest and intermediate $k$\nvalues. These results are relevant for the $k$ range that will be probed by the\ncurrent and upcoming EoR 21-cm experiments.\n", "  This paper deals with the classification of spinor fields according to the\nbilinear covariants in 7 dimensions. The previously investigated Riemannian\ncase is characterized by either one spinor field class, in the real case of\nMajorana spinors, or three non-trivial classes in the most general complex\ncase. In this paper we show that by imposing appropriate conditions on spinor\nfields in 7d manifolds with Lorentzian metric, the formerly obtained\nobstructions for new classes of spinor fields can be circumvented. New spinor\nfields classes are then explicitly constructed. In particular, on 7-manifolds\nwith asymptotically flat black hole background, these spinors can define a\ngeneralized current density which further defines a time Killing vector at the\nspatial infinity.\n", "  The fine-structure constant and the electron mass in string theory are\ndetermined by the values of scalar fields called moduli. If the dark matter\ntakes on the form of such a light modulus, it oscillates with a frequency equal\nto its mass and an amplitude determined by the local dark-matter density. This\ntranslates into an oscillation of the size of a solid that can be observed by\nresonant-mass antennas. Existing and planned experiments, combined with a\ndedicated resonant-mass detector proposed in this Letter, can probe dark-matter\nmoduli with frequencies between 1 kHz and 1 GHz, with much better sensitivity\nthan searches for fifth forces.\n", "  There is event by event geometric as well as quantum fluctuations in the\ninitial condition of heavy-ion collisions. The standard technique of analysing\nheavy-ion collisions in bins of centrality obtained from final state\nmultiplicity averages out the various initial configurations and thus restricts\nthe study to only a limited range of initial conditions. In this paper, we\npropose an additional binning in terms of total spectator neutrons in an event.\nThis offers us a key control parameter to probe events with broader range of\ninitial conditions providing us an opportunity to peep into events with rarer\ninitial conditions which otherwise get masked when analysed by centrality\nbinning alone. We find that the inclusion of spectator binning allows one to\nvary $\\varepsilon_2$ and $\\varepsilon_3$ independently. We observe that the\nstandard scaling relation between $\\displaystyle{v_2/\\varepsilon_2}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{S}\\frac{dN_{\\text{ch}}}{d\\eta}$ exhibited by centrality bins is\nbroken by the spectator neutron bins. However, the acoustic scaling relation\nbetween $\\displaystyle{\\ln\\left( v_n/\\varepsilon_n\\right)}$ and transverse\nsystem size holds for both centrality as well as spectator bins for central to\nmid-central collisions. The introduction of the spectator binning allows us to\ntune over a wide range viscosity driven effects for events with varying initial\nstates but similar final state multiplicity.\n", "  We generalize the kinetic theory of fluids, in which the description of\nfluids is based on the geodesic motion of particles, to spacetimes modeled by\nFinsler geometry. Our results show that Finsler spacetimes are a suitable\nbackground for fluid dynamics and that the equation of motion for a\ncollisionless fluid is given by the Liouville equation, as it is also the case\nfor a metric background geometry. We finally apply this model to collisionless\ndust and a general fluid with cosmological symmetry and derive the\ncorresponding equations of motion. It turns out that the equation of motion for\na dust fluid is a simple generalization of the well-known Euler equations.\n", "  Quantum spin models have been studied extensively in one and higher\ndimensions. Furthermore, these systems have been doped with holes to study\n$t$--$J$ models of $SU(2)$ spin-1/2. Their anyonic counterparts can be built\nfrom non-Abelian anyons, such as Fibonacci anyons described by $SU(2)_3$\ntheories, which are quantum deformations of the $SU(2)$ algebra. Inspired by\nthe physics of $SU(2)$ spins, several works have explored ladders of Fibonacci\nanyons and also one-dimensional (1D) $t$--$J$ models. Here we aim to explore\nthe combined effects of extended dimensionality and doping by studying ladders\ncomposed of coupled chains of interacting itinerant Fibonacci anyons. We show\nanalytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be\nmapped onto effective 1D models. These effective models can either be gapped\nmodels of hole pairs, or gapless models described by $t$--$J$ (or modified\n$t$--$J$--$V$) chains of Fibonacci anyons, whose spectrum exhibits a\nfractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom. By using exact\ndiagonalizations for two-leg and three-leg ladders, we show that indeed the\ndoped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of $t$--$J$ chains. In the\nstrong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two\ndifferent kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\\tau$'s\nand light $\\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian)\ntopological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map\nthe two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and\nlight $\\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the\nappearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological\ngapped phase is suggested for another density regime.\n", "  We present the effect of different stacking orders on carrier transport\nproperties of multi-layer black phosphorous. We consider three different\nstacking orders AAA, ABA and ACA, with increasing number of layers (from 2 to 6\nlayers). We employ a hierarchical approach in density functional theory (DFT),\nwith structural simulations performed with Generalized Gradient Approximation\n(GGA) and the bandstructure, carrier effective masses and optical properties\nevaluated with the Meta-Generalized Gradient Approximation (MGGA). The carrier\ntransmission in the various black phosphorous sheets was carried out with the\nnon-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) approach. The results show that ACA\nstacking has the highest electron and hole transmission probabilities. The\nresults show tunability for a wide range of band-gap, carrier effective masses\nand transmission with a great promise for lattice engineering (stacking order\nand layers) in black phosphorous.\n", "  We study random matrices acting on tensor product spaces which have been\ntransformed by a linear block operation. Using operator-valued free probability\ntheory, under some mild assumptions on the linear map acting on the blocks, we\ncompute the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the modified matrices in\nterms of the initial asymptotic distribution. Moreover, using recent results on\noperator-valued subordination, we present an algorithm that computes,\nnumerically but in full generality, the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the\nmodified matrices. Our analytical results cover many cases of interest in\nquantum information theory: we unify some known results and we obtain new\ndistributions and various generalizations.\n", "  Besides their intrinsic nuclear-structure value, nuclear mass models are\nessential for astrophysical applications, such as r-process nucleosynthesis and\nneutron-star structure. To overcome the intrinsic limitations of existing\n\"state-of-the-art\" mass models, we propose a refinement based on a Bayesian\nNeural Network (BNN) formalism. A novel BNN approach is implemented with the\ngoal of optimizing mass residuals between theory and experiment. A significant\nimprovement (of about 40%) in the mass predictions of existing models is\nobtained after BNN refinement. Moreover, these improved results are now\naccompanied by proper statistical errors. Finally, by constructing a \"world\naverage\" of these predictions, a mass model is obtained that is used to predict\nthe composition of the outer crust of a neutron star. The power of the Bayesian\nneural network method has been successfully demonstrated by a systematic\nimprovement in the accuracy of the predictions of nuclear masses. Extension to\nother nuclear observables is a natural next step that is currently under\ninvestigation.\n", "  Fiducial cross-sections for $t\\bar{t}$ production with one or two additional\n$b$-jets are reported, using an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large\nHadron Collider, collected with the ATLAS detector. The cross-section times\nbranching ratio for $t\\bar{t}$ events with at least one additional $b$-jet is\nmeasured to be 950 $\\pm$ 70 (stat.) $^{+240}_{-190}$ (syst.) fb in the\nlepton-plus-jets channel and 50 $\\pm$ 10 (stat.) $^{+15}_{-10}$ (syst.) fb in\nthe $e \\mu$ channel. The cross-section times branching ratio for events with at\nleast two additional $b$-jets is measured to be 19.3 $\\pm$ 3.5 (stat.) $\\pm$\n5.7 (syst.) fb in the dilepton channel ($e \\mu$,\\,$\\mu\\mu$, and \\,$ee$) using a\nmethod based on tight selection criteria, and 13.5 $\\pm$ 3.3 (stat.) $\\pm$ 3.6\n(syst.) fb using a looser selection that allows the background normalisation to\nbe extracted from data. The latter method also measures a value of 1.30 $\\pm$\n0.33 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.28 (syst.)\\% for the ratio of $t\\bar{t}$ production with\ntwo additional $b$-jets to $t\\bar{t}$ production with any two additional jets.\nAll measurements are in good agreement with recent theory predictions.\n", "  Signs of hierarchy are prevalent in a wide range of systems in nature and\nsociety. One of the key problems is quantifying the importance of hierarchical\norganisation in the structure of the network representing the interactions or\nconnections between the fundamental units of the studied system. Although a\nnumber of notable methods are already available, their vast majority is\ntreating all directed acyclic graphs as already maximally hierarchical. Here we\npropose a hierarchy measure based on random walks on the network. The novelty\nof our approach is that directed trees corresponding to multi level pyramidal\nstructures obtain higher hierarchy scores compared to directed chains and\ndirected stars. Furthermore, in the thermodynamic limit the hierarchy measure\nof regular trees is converging to a well defined limit depending only on the\nbranching number. When applied to real networks, our method is computationally\nvery effective, as the result can be evaluated with arbitrary precision by\nsubsequent multiplications of the transition matrix describing the random walk\nprocess. In addition, the tests on real world networks provided very intuitive\nresults, e.g., the trophic levels obtained from our approach on a food web were\nhighly consistent with former results from ecology.\n", "  We analyze the effect of phase fluctuations in an optical communication\nscheme based on collective detection of sequences of binary coherent state\nsymbols using linear optics and photon counting. When the phase noise is\nabsent, the scheme offers qualitatively improved nonlinear scaling of the\nspectral efficiency with the mean photon number in the low-power regime\ncompared to individual detection. We show that this feature, providing a\ndemonstration of superaddivitity of accessible information in classical\ncommunication over quantum channels, is preserved if random phases imprinted on\ntransmitted symbols fluctuate around a reference fixed over the sequence\nlength.\n", "  In the present paper we introduce a way of identifying quantum phase\ntransitions of many-body systems by means of local time correlations and\nLeggett-Garg inequalities. This procedure allows to experimentally determine\nthe quantum critical points not only of finite-order transitions but also those\nof infinite order, as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that is not always\neasy to detect with current methods. By means of simple analytical arguments\nfor a general spin-$1 / 2$ Hamiltonian, and matrix product simulations of\none-dimensional $X X Z$ and anisotropic $X Y$ models, we argue that\nfinite-order quantum phase transitions can be determined by singularities of\nthe time correlations or their derivatives at criticality. The same features\nare exhibited by corresponding Leggett-Garg functions, which noticeably\nindicate violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities for early times and all the\nHamiltonian parameters considered. In addition, we find that the infinite-order\ntransition of the $X X Z$ model at the isotropic point can be revealed by the\nmaximal violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. We thus show that quantum\nphase transitions can be identified by purely local measurements, and that\nmany-body systems constitute important candidates to observe experimentally the\nviolation of Leggett-Garg inequalities.\n", "  In this paper, we present a modelling experiment developed to study systems\nof cities and processes of urbanisation in large territories over long time\nspans. Building on geographical theories of urban evolution, we rely on\nagent-based models to 1/ formalise complementary and alternative hypotheses of\nurbanisation and 2/ explore their ability to simulate observed patterns in a\nvirtual laboratory. The paper is therefore divided into two sections : an\noverview of the mechanisms implemented to represent competing hypotheses used\nto simulate urban evolution; and an evaluation of the resulting model\nstructures in their ability to simulate - efficiently and parsimoniously - a\nsystem of cities (the Former Soviet Union) over several periods of time (before\nand after the crash of the USSR). We do so using a modular framework of\nmodel-building and evolutionary algorithms for the calibration of several model\nstructures. This project aims at tackling equifinality in systems dynamics by\nconfronting different mechanisms with similar evaluation criteria. It enables\nthe identification of the best-performing models with respect to the chosen\ncriteria by scanning automatically the parameter along with the space of model\nstructures (as combinations of modelled dynamics).\n", "  We investigate the effective interaction between two randomly charged but\notherwise net-neutral, planar dielectric slabs immersed in an asymmetric\nCoulomb fluid containing a mixture of mobile monovalent and multivalent ions.\nThe presence of charge disorder on the apposed bounding surfaces of the slabs\nleads to substantial qualitative changes in the way they interact, as compared\nwith the standard picture provided by the van der Waals and image-induced,\nion-depletion interactions. While, the latter predict purely attractive\ninteractions between strictly neutral slabs, we show that the combined effects\nfrom surface charge disorder, image depletion, Debye (or salt) screening and\nalso, in particular, their coupling with multivalent ions, give rise to a more\ndiverse behavior for the effective interaction between net-neutral slabs.\nDisorder effects show large variation depending on the properly quantified\nstrength of disorder, leading either to non-monotonic effective interaction\nwith both repulsive and attractive branches when the surface charges are weakly\ndisordered (small disorder variance) or to a dominating attractive interaction\nthat is larger both in its range and magnitude than what is predicted from the\nvan der Waals and image-induced, ion-depletion interactions, when the surfaces\nare strongly disordered (large disorder variance).\n", "  We analytically study the phase transitions between s-wave holographic\ninsulator/superconductor and metal/superconductor. The problem is solved by the\nvariational method for the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem in the theory\nwith dark matter sector of U(1)-gauge field coupled to the Maxwell field.\nAdditionally in the probe limit we investigate the marginally stable modes of\nscalar perturbations in the AdS solitonic background, connected with magnetic\nfield in the dark matter sector. We have found that even with dark matter\nsector the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is proportional to\ncharge density $\\rho$ in power 1/3. This value seem to be strong coupling\nmodification of the exponent 2/3 known from the Bose - Einstein condensation of\ncharged local pair bosons in narrow band superconductors. The holographic\ndroplet solution is affected by the coupling to the dark matter. Interestingly\nin the probe limit the critical chemical potential increases with the\ndecreasing coupling to dark matter making the condensation transition harder to\nappear.\n", "  Density-functional-theory-based electronic structure calculations are made to\nconsider the novel electronic states of Ru-pnictides RuP and RuAs where the\nintriguing phase transitions and superconductivity under doping of Rh have been\nreported. We find that there appear nearly degenerate flat bands just at the\nFermi level in the high-temperature metallic phase of RuP and RuAs; the\nflat-band states come mainly from the $4d_{xy}$ orbitals of Ru ions and the Rh\ndoping shifts the Fermi level just above the flat bands. The splitting of the\nflat bands caused by their electronic instability may then be responsible for\nthe observed phase transition to the nonmagnetic insulating phase at low\ntemperatures. We also find that the band structure calculated for RuSb\nresembles that of the doped RuP and RuAs, which is consistent with experiment\nwhere superconductivity occurs in RuSb without Rh doping.\n", "  While designed primarily for X-ray imaging applications, the Medipix3 ASIC\ncan also be used for charged-particle tracking. In this work, results from a\nbeam test at the CERN SPS with irradiated and non-irradiated sensors are\npresented and shown to be in agreement with simulation, demonstrating the\nsuitability of the Medipix3 ASIC as a tool for characterising pixel sensors.\n", "  Power-law tails are ubiquitous in income distributions and in the energy\ndistributions of diluted relativistic gases. We analyze the conceptual link\nbetween these two cases. In economic interactions fat tails arise because the\nrichest individuals enact some protection mechanisms (\"saving propensity\")\nwhich allow them to put at stake, in their interactions, only a small part of\ntheir wealth. In high-energy particle collisions something similar happens, in\nthe sense that when particles with very large energy collide with slow\nparticles, then as a sole consequence of relativistic kinematics (mass\ndilation), they tend to exchange only a small part of their energy; processes\nlike the frontal collision of two identical particles, where the exchanged\nenergy is 100%, are very improbable, at least in a diluted gas. We thus show\nhow in two completely different systems, one of socio-economic nature and one\nof physical nature, a certain feature of the binary microscopic interactions\nleads to the same consequence in the macroscopic distribution for the income or\nrespectively for the energy.\n", "  Inertial magnetization dynamics have been predicted at ultrahigh speeds, or\nfrequencies approaching the energy relaxation scale of electrons, in\nferromagnetic metals. Here we identify inertial terms to magnetization dynamics\nin thin Ni$_{79}$Fe$_{21}$ and Co films near room temperature. Effective\nmagnetic fields measured in high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance (115-345\nGHz) show an additional stiffening term which is quadratic in frequency and\n$\\sim$ 80 mT at the high frequency limit of our experiment. Our results extend\nunderstanding of magnetization dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales.\n", "  The aim of the current paper is to study the multiscalar-tensor theories of\ngravity without derivative couplings. We construct a few basic objects that are\ninvariant under a Weyl rescaling of the metric and transform covariantly when\nthe scalar fields are redefined. We introduce rules to construct further such\nobjects and put forward a scheme that allows to express the results obtained\neither in the Einstein frame or in the Jordan frame as general ones. These so\ncalled translation rules are used to show that the parametrized post-Newtonian\napproximation results obtained in the aforementioned two frames indeed are the\nsame if expressed in a general frame.\n", "  We present a modelling framework, and basic model parameterization, for the\nstudy of DNA origami folding at the level of DNA domains. Our approach is\nexplicitly kinetic and does not assume a specific folding pathway. The binding\nof each staple is associated with a free-energy change that depends on staple\nsequence, the possibility of coaxial stacking with neighbouring domains, and\nthe entropic cost of constraining the scaffold by inserting staple crossovers.\nA rigorous thermodynamic model is difficult to implement as a result of the\ncomplex, multiply connected geometry of the scaffold: we present a solution to\nthis problem for planar origami. Coaxial stacking and entropic terms,\nparticularly when loop closure exponents are taken to be larger than those for\nideal chains, introduce interactions between staples. These cooperative\ninteractions lead to the prediction of sharp assembly transitions with notable\nhysteresis that are consistent with experimental observations. We show that the\nmodel reproduces the experimentally observed consequences of reducing staple\nconcentration, accelerated cooling and absent staples. We also present a\nsimpler methodology that gives consistent results and can be used to study a\nwider range of systems including non-planar origami.\n", "  We investigate the spectral properties of the UV ($\\lambda\\lambda$2650-3050\n\\AA) and optical ($\\lambda\\lambda$4000-5500 \\AA) Fe II emission features in a\nsample of 293 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) database. We explore different correlations between their\nemission line properties, as well as the correlations with the other emission\nlines from the spectral range. We find several interesting correlations and we\ncan outline the most interesting results as follows. (i) There is a kinematical\nconnection between the UV and optical Fe II lines, indicating that the UV and\noptical Fe II lines originate from the outer part of the broad line region,\nso-called intermediate line region; (ii) The unexplained anticorrelations of\nthe optical Fe II (EW Fe II$_{opt}$) versus EW [O III] 5007 \\AA\\ and EW Fe\nII$_{opt}$ versus FWHM Hbeta have not been detected for the UV Fe II lines;\n(iii) The significant averaged redshift in the UV Fe II lines, which is not\npresent in optical Fe II, indicates an inflow in the UV Fe II emitting clouds,\nand probably their asymmetric distribution. (iv) Also, we confirm the\nanticorrelation between the intensity ratio of the optical and UV Fe II lines\nand FWHM of Hbeta, and we find the anticorrelations of this ratio with the\nwidths of Mg II 2800 \\AA, optical Fe II and UV Fe II. This indicates a very\nimportant role for the column density and microturbulence in the emitting gas.\nWe discuss the starburst activity in high-density regions of young AGNs as a\npossible explanation of the detected optical Fe II correlations and intensity\nline ratios of the UV and optical Fe II lines.\n", "  The nature of the nuclear pairing condensate is an active topic of\ninvestigation, especially as regards its neutron-proton versus\nidentical-particle character, which manifests as the difference between\nspin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing. In this work, we probe the recently\nproposed mixed-spin pairing condensates, using a phenomenological Hamiltonian\nand Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory along with the gradient method. In addition\nto improving the solution of the many-body problem, we have calculated a series\nof physical quantities and examined the robustness of the mixed-spin pairing\nstate as the input Hamiltonian is modified. Overall, we find that even though\nthe mixed-spin correlation energy is suppressed in comparison to earlier work,\nthe new pairing behavior persists. We also discuss the possibility of directly\nprobing the mixed-spin pairing phase.\n", "  The connection between black hole thermodynamics and chemistry is extended to\nthe lower-dimensional regime by considering the rotating and charged BTZ metric\nin the $(2+1)$-D and a $(1+1)$-D limits of Einstein gravity. The Smarr relation\nis naturally upheld in both BTZ cases, where those with $Q \\ne 0$ violate the\nReverse Isoperimetric Inequality and are thus superentropic. The inequality can\nbe maintained, however, with the addition of a new thermodynamic work term\nassociated with the mass renormalization scale. The $D\\rightarrow 0$ limit of a\ngeneric $D+2$-dimensional Einstein gravity theory is also considered to derive\nthe Smarr and Komar relations, although the opposite sign definitions of the\ncosmological constant and thermodynamic pressure from the $D>2$ cases must be\nadopted in order to satisfy the relation. The requirement of positive entropy\nimplies a lower bound on the mass of a $(1+1)$-D black hole. Promoting an\nassociated constant of integration to a thermodynamic variable allows one to\ndefine a \"rotation\" in one spatial dimension. Neither the $D=3$ nor the $D\n\\rightarrow 2$ black holes exhibit any interesting phase behaviour.\n", "  This contribution reviews the present status of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF)\napproach as one of the leading self-consistent mean-field models in the physics\nof atomic nuclei. It starts with a brief summary of the formalism and strategy\nfor proper calibration of the SHF functional. The main emphasis lies on an\nexploration of the reliability of predictions, particularly in the regime of\nextrapolations. Various strategies are discussed to explore the statistical and\nsystematic errors of SHF. The strategies are illustrated on examples from\nactual applications. Variations of model and fit data are used to get an idea\nabout systematic errors. The statistical error is evaluated in straightforward\nmanner by statistical analysis based on $\\chi^2$ fits. This also allows also to\nevaluate the correlations (covariances) between observables which provides\nuseful insights into the structure of the model and of the fitting strategy.\n", "  The effects of string fusion on the correlations in strange particles\nproduction in proton-proton collisions at high energy are studied in the\nframework of a Monte Carlo string-parton model. The model is based on the\nstrings formation in elementary dipole-dipole collisions. The hardness of the\nelementary interaction is defined by a transverse size of the colliding\ndipoles. The interaction between strings is realized in the accordance with the\nstring fusion model prescriptions by the introduction of the lattice in the\nimpact parameter plane and taking into account the finite rapidity length of\nstrings. The particles species differentiation is implemented according to\nSchwinger mechanism. The parameters of the model are fixed with the\nexperimental data on total inelastic cross section and charged multiplicity. In\nthe framework of the model the long-range correlation functions with an\naccounting of strangeness have been studied. A new intensive event-by-event\nobservable has been proposed, which characterizes the fraction of strange\nparticles in the event. The predictions on the correlations between\nstrangeness, multiplicity and mean transverse momentum are obtained for pp\ncollisions at 7 TeV.\n", "  Quantum walks are well-known for their ballistic dispersion, traveling\n$\\Theta(t)$ away in $t$ steps, which is quadratically faster than a classical\nrandom walk's diffusive spreading. In physical implementations of the walk,\nhowever, the particle may need to tunnel through a potential barrier to hop,\nand a naive calculation suggests this could eliminate the ballistic transport.\nWe show by explicit calculation, however, that such a loss does not occur.\nRather, the $\\Theta(t)$ dispersion is retained, with only the coefficient\nchanging, which additionally gives a way to detect and quantify the hopping\nerrors in experiments.\n", "  The observed 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distorted\nalong the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. These\nredshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will also\nmake it anisotropic. This anisotropy contains information about the\ncross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogen\nfield, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about the\nsources of reionization. In this paper, we study a collection of simulated\nreionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources of\nreionization. We show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by the\nquadrupole moment of the power spectrum. We find that, unless the properties of\nthe reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolves\nvery predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. This predictability\nimplies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool for\ndistinguishing between reionization sources. However, the quadrupole moment can\nbe used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history.\nWe show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generation\ninstruments such as LOFAR, while the SKA should be able to measure the\nreionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to great\naccuracy.\n", "  Tests of general relativity (GR) are still in their infancy on cosmological\nscales, but forthcoming experiments promise to greatly improve their precision\nover a wide range of distance scales and redshifts. One such experiment, the\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA), will carry out several wide and deep surveys of\nresolved and unresolved neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm line-emitting galaxies,\nmapping a significant fraction of the sky from $0 \\le z \\lesssim 6$. I present\nforecasts for the ability of a suite of possible SKA HI surveys to detect\ndeviations from GR by reconstructing the cosmic expansion and growth history.\nSKA Phase 1 intensity mapping surveys can achieve sub-1\\% measurements of\n$f\\sigma_8$ out to $z\\approx 1$, with an SKA1-MID Band 2 survey out to $z\n\\lesssim 0.6$ able to surpass contemporary spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as\nDESI and Euclid in terms of constraints on modified gravity parameters if\nchallenges such as foreground contamination can be tackled effectively. A more\nfuturistic Phase 2 HI survey of $\\sim10^9$ spectroscopic galaxy redshifts would\nbe capable of detecting a $\\sim 2\\%$ modification of the Poisson equation out\nto $z\\approx 2$.\n", "  Observations of edge-on galaxies allow us to investigate the vertical extent\nand properties of dust, gas and stellar distributions. NGC 891 has been studied\nfor decades and represents one of the best studied cases of an edge-on galaxy.\nWe use deep PACS data together with IRAC, MIPS and SPIRE data to study the\nvertical extent of dust emission around NGC 891. We also test the presence of a\nmore extended, thick dust component. By performing a convolution of an\nintrinsic vertical profile emission with each instrument PSF and comparing it\nwith observations we derived the scaleheight of a thin and thick dust disc\ncomponent. For all wavelengths considered the emission is best fit with the sum\nof a thin and a thick dust component. The scaleheight of both dust components\nshows a gradient passing from 70 $\\mu$m to 250 $\\mu$m. This could be due to a\ndrop in dust heating (and thus dust temperature) with the distance from the\nplane, or to a sizable contribution ($\\sim 15 - 80%$) of an unresolved thin\ndisc of hotter dust to the observed surface brightness at shorter wavelengths.\nThe scaleheight of the thick dust component, using observations from 70 $\\mu$m\nto 250 $\\mu$m has been estimated to be $(1.44\\pm 0.12)$ kpc, consistent with\nprevious estimates (extinction and scattering in optical bands and MIR\nemission). The amount of dust mass at distances larger than $\\sim 2$ kpc from\nthe midplane represents $2 - 3.3$ % of the total galactic dust mass and the\nrelative abundance of small grains with respect to large grains is almost\nhalved comparing to that in the midplane. The paucity of small grains high\nabove the midplane might indicate that dust is hit by interstellar shocks or\ngalactic fountains and entrained together with gas. The halo dust component is\nlikely to be embedded in an atomic / molecular gas and heated by a thick\nstellar disc.\n", "  We study the interaction and dynamics of two half-quantized vortices in\ntwo-component Bose- Einstein condensates. Using the Pade approximation for the\nvortex core profile, we calculate the intervortex potential, whose asymptotic\nform for a large distance has been derived by Eto et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 83,\n063603 (2011)]. Through numerical simulations of the two-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii equations, we reveal different kinds of dynamical trajectories\nof the vortices depending on the combinations of signs of circulations and the\nintercomponent density coupling. Under the adiabatic limit, we derive the\nequations of motion for the vortex coordinates, in which the motion is caused\nby the balance between Magnus force and the intervortex forces. The initial\nvelocity of the vortex motion can be explained quantitatively by this point\nvortex approximation, but under- standing the long-time behavior of the\ndynamics needs more consideration beyond our model.\n", "  Phenomenological modeling of variable stars allows determination of a set of\nthe parameters, which are needed for classification in the \"General Catalogue\nof Variable Stars\" and similar catalogs. We apply a recent method NAV (\"New\nAlgol Variable\") to eclipsing binary stars of different types. Although all\nperiodic functions may be represented as Fourier series with an infinite number\nof coefficients, this is impossible for a finite number of the observations.\nThus one may use a restricted Fourier series, i.e. a trigonometric polynomial\n(TP) of order s either for fitting the light curve, or to make a periodogram\nanalysis. However, the number of parameters needed drastically increases with\ndecreasing width of minimum. In the NAV algorithm, the special shape of minimum\nis used, so the number of parameters is limited to 10 (if the period and\ninitial epoch are fixed) or 12 (not fixed). We illustrate the NAV method by\napplication to a recently discovered Algol-type eclipsing variable 2MASS\nJ11080308-6145589 (in the field of previously known variable star RS Car) and\ncompare results to that obtained using the TP fits. For this system, the\nstatistically optimal number of parameters is 44, but the fit is still worse\nthan that of the NAV fit. Application to the system GSC 3692-00624 argues that\nthe NAV fit is better than the TP one even for the case of EW-type stars with\nmuch wider eclipses. Model parameters are listed.\n", "  The article surveys the main techniques and results of the spectral theory of\nperiodic operators arising in mathematical physics and other areas. Close\nattention is paid to studying analytic properties of Bloch and Fermi varieties,\nwhich influence significantly most properties of such operators.\n  The approaches described are applicable not only to the standard model\nexample of Schr\\\"odinger operator with periodic electric potential\n$-\\Delta+V(x)$, but to a wide variety of elliptic periodic equations and\nsystems, equations on graphs, $\\overline{\\partial}$-operator, and other\noperators on abelian coverings of compact bases.\n  Many important applications are mentioned. However, due to the size\nrestrictions, they are not dealt with in details.\n", "  In a recent work, S.A.R. Horsley and coworkers [Nature Photon 9, 436-439\n(2015)] showed rather interestingly that planar dielectric media, for which the\nreal and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity are related by spatial\nKramers-Kronig (KK) relations, are one-way reflectionless, whatever the angle\nof incidence. Such a fascinating property, besides of extending our\ncomprehension of the fundamental phenomenon of reflection, may offer new ways\nfor the design of antireflection surfaces and thin materials with efficient\nlight absorption. However, KK dielectric media are generally described by\nslowly-decaying complex permittivity profiles which may introduce some subtle\nissues in the study of the scattering problem. Here we provide a condition on\nthe imaginary part of the dielectric profile that ensures the existence of\nproper scattering states and present a proof of the one-way reflectionless\nproperty in KK dielectric media which is free from loophole. Finally, we show\nthat instabilities might arise at the interface of KK dielectric media when the\nmedium is not purely dissipative.\n", "  We study two-fluid systems with nonzero fluid velocities and compute their\nsound modes, which indicate various instabilities. For the case of two\nzero-temperature superfluids we employ a microscopic field-theoretical model of\ntwo coupled bosonic fields, including an entrainment coupling and a\nnon-entrainment coupling. We analyse the onset of the various instabilities\nsystematically and point out that the dynamical two-stream instability can only\noccur beyond Landau's critical velocity, i.e., in an already energetically\nunstable regime. A qualitative difference is found for the case of two normal\nfluids, where certain transverse modes suffer a two-stream instability in an\nenergetically stable regime if there is entrainment between the fluids. Since\nwe work in a fully relativistic setup, our results are very general and of\npotential relevance for (super)fluids in neutron stars and, in the\nnon-relativistic limit of our results, in the laboratory.\n", "  Quantum state engineering and quantum computation rely on information erasure\nprocedures that, up to some fidelity, prepare a quantum object in a pure state.\nSuch processes occur within Landauer's framework if they rely on an interaction\nbetween the object and a thermal reservoir. Landauer's principle dictates that\nthis must dissipate a minimum quantity of heat, proportional to the entropy\nreduction that is incurred by the object, to the thermal reservoir. However,\nthis lower bound is only reachable for some specific physical situations, and\nit is not necessarily achievable for any given reservoir. The main task of our\nwork can be stated as the minimisation of heat dissipation given probabilistic\ninformation erasure, i.e., minimising the amount of energy transferred to the\nthermal reservoir as heat if we require that the probability of preparing the\nobject in a specific pure state $|\\varphi_1\\rangle$ be no smaller than\n$p_{\\varphi_1}^{\\max}-\\delta$. Here $p_{\\varphi_1}^{\\max}$ is the maximum\nprobability of information erasure that is permissible by the physical context,\nand $\\delta\\geqslant 0$ the error. To determine the achievable minimal heat\ndissipation of quantum information erasure within a given physical context, we\nexplicitly optimise over all possible unitary operators that act on the\ncomposite system of object and reservoir. Specifically, we characterise the\nequivalence class of such optimal unitary operators, using tools from\nmajorisation theory, when we are restricted to finite-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces. Furthermore, we discuss how pure state preparation processes could be\nachieved with a smaller heat cost than Landauer's limit, by operating outside\nof Landauer's framework.\n", "  We present a new method to study the semiclassical dynamics of the\nJaynes-Cummings dimer model, describing two coupled cavities each containing a\ntwo-level system (qubit). We develop a Fock space WKB approach in the polariton\nbasis where each site is treated exactly while the intersite polariton hopping\nis treated semiclassically. We show that the self-trapped states can be viewed\nas Fock space localized states. We find that this picture yields the correct\ncritical value of interaction strength at which the delocalization-localization\ntransition occurs. Moreover, the validity of our WKB approach is supported by\nshowing that the quantum spectrum can be derived from a set of Bohr-Sommerfeld\nquantization conditions and by confirming that the quantum eigenstates are\nconsistent with the classical orbital motion in the polariton band picture. The\nunderlying idea of our method is quite general and can be applied to other\ninteracting spin-boson models.\n", "  We investigate the variation in the MMHT2014 PDFs when we allow the heavy\nquark masses $m_c$ and $m_b$ to vary away from their default values. We make\nPDF sets available in steps of $\\Delta m_c =0.05~{\\rm GeV}$ and $\\Delta m_b\n=0.25~{\\rm GeV}$, and present the variation in the PDFs and in the predictions.\nWe examine the comparison to the HERA data on charm and beauty structure\nfunctions and note that in each case the heavy quark data, and the inclusive\ndata, have a slight preference for lower masses than our default values. We\nprovide PDF sets with 3 and 4 active quark flavours, as well as the standard\nvalue of 5 flavours. We use the pole mass definition of the quark masses, as in\nthe default MMHT2014 analysis, but briefly comment on the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$\ndefinition.\n", "  We explore the behavior in time of the energy exchange between a system of\ninterest and its environment, together with its relationship to the\nnon-Markovianity of the system dynamics. In order to evaluate the energy\nexchange we rely on the full counting statistics formalism, which we use to\nevaluate the first moment of its probability distribution. We focus in\nparticular on the energy backflow from environment to system, to which we\nassociate a suitable condition and quantifier, which enables us to draw a\nconnection with a recently introduced notion of non-Markovianity based on\ninformation backflow. This quantifier is then studied in detail in the case of\nthe spin-boson model, described within a second order time-convolutionless\napproximation, observing that non-Markovianity allows for the observation of\nenergy backflow. This analysis allows us to identify the parameters region in\nwhich energy backflow is higher.\n", "  We discuss a quantum deformation of the Green-Schwarz superstring on flat\nspace, arising as a contraction limit of the corresponding deformation of AdS_5\nx S^5. This contraction limit turns out to be equivalent to a previously\nstudied limit that yields the so-called mirror model - the model obtained from\nthe light cone gauge fixed AdS_5 x S^5 string by a double Wick rotation.\nReversing this logic, the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring is the double Wick rotation\nof a quantum deformation of the flat space superstring. This quantum deformed\nflat space string realizes symmetries of timelike kappa-Poincare type, and is T\ndual to dS_5 x H^5, indicating interesting relations between symmetry algebras\nunder T duality. Our results directly extend to AdS_2 x S^2 x T^6 and AdS_3 x\nS^3 x T^4, and beyond string theory to many (semi)symmetric space coset sigma\nmodels, such as for example a deformation of the four dimensional Minkowski\nsigma model with timelike kappa-Poincare symmetry. We also discuss possible\nnull and spacelike deformations.\n", "  The BEC-BCS crossover for a NJL model with diquark interactions is studied in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field. Particular attention is paid to\ndifferent regularization schemes used in the literature. A thorough comparison\nof results is performed for the case of a cold and magnetized two-color NJL\nmodel. According to our results, the critical chemical potential for the BEC\ntransition exhibits a clear inverse magnetic catalysis effect for magnetic\nfields in the range $ 1 \\lesssim eB/m_\\pi^2 \\lesssim 20 $. As for the BEC-BCS\ncrossover, the corresponding critical chemical potential is very weakly\nsensitive to magnetic fields up to $eB \\sim 9\\ m_\\pi^2$, showing a much smaller\ninverse magnetic catalysis as compared to the BEC transition, and displays a\nstrong magnetic catalysis from this point on.\n", "  We present a measurement of b jet transverse momentum (pt) spectra in\nproton-lead (pPb) collisions using a dataset corresponding to about 35 inverse\nnanobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Jets from b quark\nfragmentation are found by exploiting the long lifetime of hadrons containing a\nb quark through tagging methods using distributions of the secondary vertex\nmass and displacement. Extracted cross sections for b jets are scaled by the\neffective number of nucleon-nucleon collisions and are compared to a reference\nobtained from PYTHIA simulations of pp collisions. The PYTHIA-based estimate of\nthe nuclear modification factor is found to be 1.22 +/- 0.15 (stat + syst pPb)\n+/- 0.27 (syst PYTHIA) averaged over all jets with pt between 55 and 400 GeV/c\nand with abs(eta[lab]) < 2. We also compare this result to predictions from\nmodels using perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  By means of a systematic expansion around the infinite-dimensional solution,\nwe obtain an approximation scheme to compute properties of glasses in low\ndimensions. The resulting equations take as input the thermodynamic and\nstructural properties of the equilibrium liquid, and from this they allow one\nto compute properties of the glass. They are therefore similar in spirit to the\nMode-Coupling approximation scheme. Our scheme becomes exact, by construction,\nin dimension $d\\to\\infty$ and it can be improved systematically by adding more\nterms in the expansion.\n", "  The quartic self-coupling of the Standard Model Higgs boson can only be\nmeasured by observing the triple-Higgs production process, but it is\nchallenging for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 2 or International Linear\nCollider (ILC) at a few TeV because of its extremely small production rate. In\nthis paper, we present a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study of the\ntriple-Higgs production through gluon fusion at a 100 TeV hadron collider and\nexplore the feasibility of observing this production mode. We focus on the\ndecay channel $HHH\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$, investigating\ndetector effects and optimizing the kinematic cuts to discriminate the signal\nfrom the backgrounds. Our study shows that, in order to observe the Standard\nModel triple-Higgs signal, the integrated luminosity of a 100 TeV hadron\ncollider should be greater than $1.8\\times 10^4$ ab$^{-1}$. We also explore the\ndependence of the cross section upon the trilinear ($\\lambda_3$) and quartic\n($\\lambda_4$) self-couplings of the Higgs. We find that, through a search in\nthe triple-Higgs production, the parameters $\\lambda_3$ and $\\lambda_4$ can be\nrestricted to the ranges $[-1, 5]$ and $[-20, 30]$, respectively. We also\nexamine how new physics can change the production rate of triple-Higgs events.\nFor example, in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, we find that the\ntriple-Higgs production rate can be increased by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$.\n", "  We present a complete derivation of the observationally motivated definition\nof the modified gravity statistic $E_G$. Using this expression, we investigate\nhow variations to theory and survey parameters may introduce uncertainty in the\ngeneral relativistic prediction of $E_G$. We forecast errors on $E_G$ for\nmeasurements using two combinations of upcoming surveys, and find that\ntheoretical uncertainties may dominate for a futuristic measurement. Finally,\nwe compute predictions of $E_G$ under modifications to general relativity in\nthe quasistatic regime, and comment on the pros and cons of using $E_G$ to test\ngravity with future surveys.\n", "  We present a new class of ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric quiver matrix models\nand argue that it describes the stringy low-energy dynamics of internally\nwrapped D-branes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) flux\ncompactifications. The Lagrangians of these models differ from previously\nstudied quiver matrix models by the presence of mass terms, associated with the\nAdS gravitational potential, as well as additional terms dictated by\nsupersymmetry. These give rise to dynamical phenomena typically associated with\nthe presence of fluxes, such as fuzzy membranes, internal cyclotron motion and\nthe appearance of confining strings. We also show how these models can be\nobtained by dimensional reduction of four-dimensional supersymmetric quiver\ngauge theories on a three-sphere.\n", "  The main aim of this study is to scrutinize promising plasmonic materials by\nunderstanding their electronic structure and correlating them to the optical\nproperties of selected refractory materials. For this purpose, the electronic\nand optical properties of the conductive ceramics TiC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, WC, TiN,\nZrN, HfN, TaN, and WN are studied systematically by means of first-principles\ndensity functional theory. A full ab initio procedure to calculate plasma\nfrequency from the electronic band structure is discussed. The dielectric\nfunctions are calculated by including electronic interband and intraband\ntransitions. Our calculations confirm that transition metal nitrides, such as\nTiN, ZrN, and HfN, are the strongest candidates, exhibiting performance\ncomparable to that of conventional noble metals in the visible to the\nnear-infrared regions. On the other hand, carbides are not suitable for\nplasmonic applications because they show very large losses in the same regions.\nFrom our calculated dielectric functions, the scattering and absorption\nefficiencies of nanoparticles made of these refractory materials are evaluated.\nIt is revealed that TiN and TaC are the best candidate materials for\napplications in photothermal energy conversion over a broad spectral region.\nFurthermore, quality factors for localized surface plasmon resonance and\nsurface plasmon polaritons are calculated to compare quantitative performances,\nand ZrN and HfN are found to be comparable to conventional plasmonic metals\nsuch as silver and gold\n", "  Standard quantum state preparation methods work by preparing a required state\nlocally and then distributing it to a distant location by a free-space\npropagation. We instead study procedures of preparing a target state at a\nremote location in the presence of an interacting background medium on which no\ncontrol is required, manipulating only local dissipation. In mathematical\nterms, we characterize a set of reduced steady states stabilizable by local\ndissipation. An explicit local method is proposed by which one can construct a\nwanted one-site reduced steady state at an arbitrary remote site in a lattice\nof any size and geometry. In the chain geometry we also prove uniqueness of\nsuch a steady state. We demonstrate that the convergence time to fixed\nprecision is smaller than the inverse gap, and we study robustness of the\nscheme in different medium interactions.\n", "  It has recently been shown by Yang. et. al. [Phys. Rev. D {\\bf 87}, 041502(R)\n(2013)] that rotating Kerr black holes are characterized by two distinct sets\nof quasinormal resonances. These two families of quasinormal resonances display\nqualitatively different asymptotic behaviors in the extremal ($a/M\\to 1$)\nblack-hole limit: The zero-damping modes (ZDMs) are characterized by relaxation\ntimes which tend to infinity in the extremal black-hole limit ($\\Im\\omega\\to 0$\nas $a/M\\to 1$), whereas the damped modes (DMs) are characterized by non-zero\ndamping rates ($\\Im\\omega\\to$ finite-values as $a/M\\to 1$). In this paper we\nrefute the claim made by Yang et. al. that co-rotating DMs of near-extremal\nblack holes are restricted to the limited range $0\\leq\n\\mu\\lesssim\\mu_{\\text{c}}\\approx 0.74$, where $\\mu\\equiv m/l$ is the\ndimensionless ratio between the azimuthal harmonic index $m$ and the spheroidal\nharmonic index $l$ of the perturbation mode. In particular, we use an\nanalytical formula originally derived by Detweiler in order to prove the\nexistence of DMs (damped quasinormal resonances which are characterized by\nfinite $\\Im\\omega$ values in the $a/M\\to 1$ limit) of near-extremal black holes\nin the $\\mu>\\mu_{\\text{c}}$ regime, the regime which was claimed by Yang et.\nal. not to contain damped modes. We show that these co-rotating DMs (in the\nregime $\\mu>\\mu_{\\text{c}}$) are expected to characterize the resonance spectra\nof rapidly-rotating (near-extremal) black holes with $a/M\\gtrsim 1-10^{-9}$.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of the internal losses of superconducting\ncoplanar waveguide microwave resonators based on niobium thin films on silicon\nsubstrates. In particular, we investigate losses introduced by Nb/Al interfaces\nin the center conductor, which is important for experiments where Al based\nJosephson junctions are integrated into Nb based circuits. We find that these\ninterfaces can be a strong source for two-level state (TLS) losses, when the\ninterfaces are not positioned at current nodes of the resonator. In addition to\nTLS losses, for resonators including Al, quasiparticle losses become relevant\nabove 200 mK. Finally, we investigate how losses generated by eddy currents in\nconductive material on the backside of the substrate can be minimized by using\nthick enough substrates or metals with high conductivity on the substrate\nbackside.\n", "  Spontaneous Lorentz violation is a viable mechanism to look for Planck scale\nphysics. In this work, we study spontaneous Lorentz violation models, in flat\nspacetime, where a vector field produces such a violation and matter is modeled\nby a complex scalar field. We show that it is possible to construct a Hamilton\ndensity for which the evolution respects the dynamical constraints. However, we\nalso find that the initial data, as required by standard field theory, does not\ndetermine the fields evolution in a unique way. In addition, we present some\nexamples where the physical effects of such ambiguities can be recognized. As a\nconsequence, the proposals in which the electromagnetic and gravitational\ninteractions emerge from spontaneous Lorentz violation are challenged.\n", "  Wikipedia is a free Internet encyclopedia with an enormous amount of content.\nThis encyclopedia is written by volunteers with various backgrounds in a\ncollective fashion; anyone can access and edit most of the articles. This\nopen-editing nature may give us prejudice that Wikipedia is an unstable and\nunreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more\naccurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have\nattempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the\nnumber of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time. In\nthis work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a\nsystematic analysis using the entire history of 34,534,110 English Wikipedia\narticles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the\nuniversality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests\nthat it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real\ntime, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by\nutilizing the number of edits as the unit of time. To account for these\nresults, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing\ndynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model\nsuccessfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as\ndistinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the\ninterrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article\nsize. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend\nto grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high\nmotivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants. We\nsuggest that this decay of participants eventually brings inequality among the\neditors, which will become more severe with time.\n", "  Cavity point-to-set correlations are real-space tools to detect the\nroughening of the free-energy landscape that accompanies the dynamical slowdown\nof glass-forming liquids. Measuring these correlations in model glass formers\nremains, however, a major computational challenge. Here, we develop a general\nparallel-tempering method that provides orders-of-magnitude improvement for\nsampling and equilibrating configurations within cavities. We apply this\nimproved scheme to the canonical Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones model for\ntemperatures down to the mode-coupling theory crossover. Most significant\nimprovements are noted for small cavities, which have thus far been the most\ndifficult to study. This methodological advance also enables us to study a\nbroader range of physical observables associated with thermodynamic\nfluctuations. We measure the probability distribution of overlap fluctuations\nin cavities, which displays a non-trivial temperature evolution. The\ncorresponding overlap susceptibility is found to provide a robust quantitative\nestimate of the point-to-set length scale requiring no fitting. By resolving\nspatial fluctuations of the overlap in the cavity, we also obtain quantitative\ninformation about the geometry of overlap fluctuations. We can thus examine in\ndetail how the penetration length as well as its fluctuations evolve with\ntemperature and cavity size.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic quantities such as the Helmholtz free energy, the\nmean energy and the specific heat for both the Klein-Gordon, and Dirac\nequations. Our analyze includes two main subsections: ($i$) statistical\nfunctions for the Klein-Gordon equation with a linear potential having Lorentz\nvector, and Lorentz scalar parts ($ii$) thermodynamic functions for the Dirac\nequation with a Lorentz scalar, inverse-linear potential by assuming that the\nscalar potential field is strong ($A \\gg 1$). We restrict ourselves to the case\nwhere only the positive part of the spectrum gives a contribution to the sum in\npartition function. We give the analytical results for high temperatures.\n", "  The spectroscopy of the doubly heavy baryons including different heavy quarks\nis studied based on the heavy quark symmetry of QCD. We point out that, when\nthe two heavy quarks are in $S$-wave, these baryons with a certain spin $j_l$\nof the light cloud can be classified into two sets: a heavy quark singlet with\ntotal spin of $j=j_l$ and a heavy quark multiplet with $j= (j_l+1) , j_l\n,\\ldots \\vert j_l-1\\vert$, all the baryons in these two sets have the same mass\nand, the baryons with the same quantum numbers in these two sets do not mix\nwith each other. We finally point out that the strong decay of the first\nexcited baryon with light spin $j_l = 1/2$ to the ground state and one-pion is\ndetermined by the mass splitting through the generalized Goldberger--Treiman\nrelation.\n", "  Recently the ATLAS experiment has reported 3.0 sigma excess in an on-Z signal\nregion in searches for supersymmetric particles. We find that the\nnext-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model can explain this excess by the\nproduction of gluinos which mainly decay via $\\tilde{g} \\to g\n\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{2,3} \\to g Z \\tilde{\\chi}^0_{1}$ where $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{2,3}$\nand $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1$ are the Higgsino and the singlino-like neutralinos,\nrespectively. We show that the observed dark matter density is explained by the\nthermal relic density of the singlino-like neutralino, simultaneously. We also\ndiscuss the searches for the Higgs sector of this scenario at the Large Hadron\nCollider.\n", "  We extend the generalize conservation law of light propagating in a\none-dimensional $\\cal PT$-symmetric system, i.e., $|T-1|=\\sqrt{R_LR_R}$ for the\ntransmittance $T$ and the reflectance $R_{L,R}$ from the left and right, to a\nmultimode waveguide with either $\\cal PT$ or $\\cal RT$ symmetry, in which\nhigher dimensional investigations are necessary. These conservation laws exist\nnot only in a matrix form for the transmission and reflection matrices; they\nalso exist in a scalar form for real-valued quantities by defining generalized\ntransmittance and reflectance. We then discuss, for the first time, how a\nmultimode $\\cal PT$-symmetric waveguide can be used to observe spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of the scattering matrix, which typically requires tuning the\nnon-hermiticity of the system (i.e. the strength of gain and loss). Here the\nadvantage of using a multimode waveguide is the elimination of tuning any\nsystem parameters: the transverse mode order $m$ plays the role of the symmetry\nbreaking parameter, and one observes the symmetry breaking by simply performing\nscattering experiment in each waveguide channel at a single frequency and fixed\nstrength of gain and loss.\n", "  We introduce a computational method developed for study of long-range\nmolecular Rydberg states of such systems that can be approximated by two\nelectrons in a model potential of the atomic cores. Only diatomic molecules are\nconsidered. The method is based on a two-electron \\rmath approach inside a\nsphere centered on one of the atoms. The wave function is then connected to a\nCoulomb region outside the sphere via multichannel version of the Coulomb\nGreen's function. This approach is put into a test by its application to a\nstudy of Rydberg states of the hydrogen molecule for internuclear distances $R$\nfrom 20 to 400 bohrs and energies corresponding to $n$ from 3 to 22. The\nresults are compared with previous quantum chemical calculations (lower quantum\nnumbers $n$) and computations based on contact potential models (higher quantum\nnumbers $n$).\n", "  We theoretically analyze the interactions and decay rates for atoms dressed\nby multiple laser fields to strongly interacting Rydberg states using a quantum\nmaster equation approach. In this framework a comparison of two-level and\nthree-level Rydberg-dressing schemes is presented. We identify a resonant\nenhancement of the three-level dressed interaction strength which originates\nfrom cooperative multiphoton couplings as well as small distance dependent\ndecay rates. In this regime the soft-core shape of the potential is independent\nof the sign of the bare Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, while its sign can be\nrepulsive or attractive depending on the intermediate state detuning. As a\nconsequence, near-resonant Rydberg dressing in three-level atomic systems may\nenable the realization of laser driven quantum fluids with long-range and\nanisotropic interactions and with controllable dissipation.\n", "  It was shown recently that, without jeopardizing the success of the $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter model on cosmic scales, the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)\ncan be derived as an emergent phenomenon when axionlike dark matter particles\ncondense into superfluid on the galactic scales. We propose in this paper a\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field conformally coupled to the matter\ncomponents. To maintain the success of MOND phenomenon of dark matter\nsuperfluid on the galactic scales, the fifth force introduced by the DBI scalar\nshould be screened on the galactic scales. It turns out that the screening\neffect naturally leads to a simple explanation for a longstanding puzzle that\nthe MOND critical acceleration coincides with present Hubble scale. This\ngalactic coincidence problem is solved, provided that the screened DBI scalar\nalso plays the role of dark energy on the cosmic scales.\n", "  In superconductors spin-split by an exchange field, thermal effects are\ncoupled to spin transport. We show how an oscillating electromagnetic field in\nsuch systems creates spin imbalance, that can be detected with a spin-polarized\nprobe. The sign and magnitude of the probe signal result from a competition\nbetween processes converting field induced spin energy imbalance to spin\nimbalance, dominant at low frequencies, and microwave-driven pair breaking at\nhigh frequencies. In the presence of spin-flip scattering, we show that ac\nexcitation also leads to multistabilities in the superconducting state.\n", "  We perform dry merger simulations to investigate the role of dry mergers in\nthe size growth of early-type galaxies in high density environments. We replace\nthe virialized dark matter haloes obtained by a large cosmological $N$-body\nsimulation with $N$-body galaxy models consisting of two components, a stellar\nbulge and a dark matter halo, which have higher mass resolution than the\ncosmological simulation. We then re-simulate nine cluster forming regions,\nwhose masses range from 1e+14 Msun to 5e+14 Msun. Masses and sizes of stellar\nbulges are also assumed to satisfy the stellar mass--size relation of high-z\ncompact massive early-type galaxies. We find that dry major mergers\nconsiderably contribute to the mass and size growth of central massive\ngalaxies. One or two dry major mergers double the average stellar mass and\nquadruple the average size between $z=2$ and $z=0$. These growths favorably\nagree with observations. Moreover, the density distributions of our simulated\ncentral massive galaxies grow from the inside-out, which is consistent with\nrecent observations. The mass--size evolution is approximated as R propto\nM_{*}^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 2.24. Most of our simulated galaxies are\nefficiently grown by dry mergers, and their stellar mass--size relations match\nthe ones observed in the local Universe. Our results show that the central\ngalaxies in the cluster haloes are potential descendants of high-z (z ~ 2-3)\ncompact massive early-type galaxies. This conclusion is consistent with\nprevious numerical studies which investigate the formation and evolution of\ncompact massive early-type galaxies.\n", "  Motivated by recent results in multiphoton interferometry, we expand a result\nof Kostant on immanants of an arbitrary $m\\times m$ unitary matrix $T\\in$\nsu$(m)$ to the submatrices of $T$. Specifically, we show that immanants of\nprincipal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum $\\sum_{t}\nD^{(\\lambda)}_{tt}(\\Omega)$ of the diagonal $D$-functions of group element\n$\\Omega$, with $t$ determined {by} the choice of submatrix, and the irrep\n$(\\lambda)$ determined by the immanant under consideration. We also provide\nevidence that this result extends to some submatrices that are not principal\ndiagonal, and we discuss how this result can be extended to cases where $T$\ncarries an su$(m)$ representation that is different from the defining\nrepresentation.\n", "  We analyze the localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a\none-dimensional bichromatic quasi-periodic optical-lattice potential by\nnumerically solving the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (1D GPE). We first derive\nthe 1D GPE from the dimensional reduction of the 3D quantum field theory of\ninteracting bosons obtaining two coupled differential equations (for axial\nwavefuction and space-time dependent transverse width) which reduce to the 1D\nGPE under strict conditions. Then, by using the 1D GPE we report the\nsuppression of localization in the interacting BEC when the repulsive\nscattering length between bosonic atoms is sufficiently large.\n", "  The progenitor system(s) and the explosion mechanism(s) of Type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia) are still under debate. Non-electromagnetic observables, in particular\ngravitational waves and neutrino emission, of thermonuclear supernovae are a\ncomplementary window to light curves and spectra for studying these enigmatic\nobjects. A leading model for SNe Ia is the thermonuclear incineration of a\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf star in a\n\"delayed-detonation\". We calculate a three-dimensional hydrodynamic explosion\nfor the N100 delayed-detonation model extensively discussed in the literature,\ntaking the dynamical effects of neutrino emission from all important\ncontributing source terms into account. Although neutrinos carry away $2 \\times\n10^{49}$ erg of energy, we confirm the common view that neutrino energy losses\nare dynamically not very important, resulting in only a modest reduction of the\nfinal kinetic energy by two per cent. We then calculate the gravitational wave\nsignal from the time evolution of the quadrupole moment. Our model radiates $7\n\\times 10^{39}$ erg in gravitational waves and the spectrum has a pronounced\npeak around 0.4 Hz. Depending on viewing angle and polarization, we find that\nthe future space-based gravitational wave missions DECIGO and BBO would be able\nto detect our source to a distance of 1.3 Mpc. We predict a clear signature of\nthe deflagration-to-detonation transition in the neutrino and the gravitational\nwave signals. If observed, such a feature would be a strong indicator of the\nrealization of delayed-detonations in near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs.\n", "  A well-established phenomenon in general relativity is the dragging of\ninertial frames by a spinning object. In particular, due to the dragging of\ninertial frames by a ring orbiting a central black hole, the angular-velocity\nof the black-hole horizon in the composed black-hole-ring system is no longer\nrelated to the black-hole angular-momentum by the simple Kerr-like (vacuum)\nrelation\n$\\Omega^{\\text{Kerr}}_{\\text{H}}(J_{\\text{H}})=J_{\\text{H}}/2M^2R_{\\text{H}}$.\nWill has performed a perturbative treatment of the composed black-hole-ring\nsystem in the regime of slowly rotating black holes and found the explicit\nrelation\n$\\Omega^{\\text{BH-ring}}_{\\text{H}}(J_{\\text{H}}=0,J_{\\text{R}},R)=2J_{\\text{R}}/R^3$\nfor the angular-velocity of a central black hole with zero angular-momentum.\nAnalyzing a sequence of black-hole-ring configurations with adiabatically\nvarying (decreasing) circumferential radii, we show that the expression found\nby Will implies a smooth transition of the central black-hole angular-velocity\nfrom its asymptotic near-horizon value\n$\\Omega^{\\text{BH-ring}}_{\\text{H}}(J_{\\text{H}}=0,J_{\\text{R}},R\\to\nR^{+}_{\\text{H}})$ to its final Kerr (vacuum) value\n$\\Omega^{\\text{Kerr}}_{\\text{H}}(J^{\\text{new}}_{\\text{H}})$. We use this\nimportant observation in order to generalize the result of Will to the regime\nof black-hole-ring configurations in which the central black holes possess\nnon-zero angular momenta. Remarkably, we find the simple universal relation\n$\\Delta\\Omega_{\\text{H}}\\equiv\\Omega^{\\text{BH-ring}}_{\\text{H}}(J_{\\text{H}},J_{\\text{R}},R\\to\nR^{+}_{\\text{H}})-\\Omega^{\\text{Kerr}}_{\\text{H}}(J_{\\text{H}})={{J_{\\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$\nfor the asymptotic deviation of the black-hole angular-velocity in the composed\nblack-hole-ring system from the corresponding angular-velocity of the\nunperturbed (vacuum) Kerr black hole with the same angular-momentum.\n", "  We report on time-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy study of the\ntopological insulator (TI) Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We unravel that a net spin\npolarization can not only be generated using circularly polarized light via\ninterband transitions between topological surface states (SSs), but also via\ntransitions between SSs and bulk states. Our experiment demonstrates that\ntuning photon energy or temperature can essentially allow for photoexcitation\nof spin-polarized electrons to unoccupied topological SSs with two distinct\nspin relaxation times ($\\sim$25 fs and $\\sim$300 fs), depending on the coupling\nbetween SSs and bulk states. The intrinsic mechanism leading to such\ndistinctive spin dynamics is the scattering in SSs and bulk states which is\ndominated by $E_g^2$ and $A_{1g}^1$ phonon modes, respectively. These findings\nare suggestive of novel ways to manipulate the photoinduced coherent spins in\nTIs.\n", "  Mixed states of a quantum system, represented by density operators, can be\ndecomposed as a statistical mixture of pure states in a number of ways where\neach decomposition can be viewed as a different preparation recipe. However the\nfact that the density matrix contains full information about the ensemble makes\nit impossible to estimate the preparation basis for the quantum system. Here we\npresent a measurement scheme to (seemingly) improve the performance of unsharp\nmeasurements. We argue that in some situations this scheme is capable of\nproviding statistics from a single copy of the quantum system, thus making it\npossible to perform state tomography from a single copy. One of the byproduct\nof the scheme is a way to distinguish between different preparation methods\nused to prepare the state of the quantum system. However, our numerical\nsimulations disagree with our intuitive predictions. We show that a\ncounter-intuitive property of a biased classical random walk is responsible for\nthe proposed mechanism not working.\n", "  The GBAR experiment will time the free fall of cold antihydrogen atoms\ndropped onto an annihilation plate to test the universality of free fall on\nantimatter. In this contribution, we study the quantum reflection of the\nanti-atom resulting from the Casimir-Polder attraction to the plate. We\nevaluate the Casimir-Polder potential and the associated quantum reflection\namplitudes and find that reflection is enhanced for weaker potentials. A\nLiouville transformation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation is used to map the\nquantum reflection problem onto an equivalent problem of scattering on a\nbarrier, leading to an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon.\n", "  Black holes accreting well below the Eddington rate are believed to have\ngeometrically thick, optically thin, rotationally supported accretion discs in\nwhich the Coulomb mean free path is large compared to $GM/c^2$. In such an\nenvironment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric\nsimulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The\nsimulations are carried out using a new code ${\\rm\\it grim}$, which evolves a\ncovariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal\neffects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are\nmodeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference\nbetween the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model\nrelies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering\nand velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the\npressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it\nsaturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces\noutward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD\nturbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the\nwall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations,\nconduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux\nis constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to\nperpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an\nincrease in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability.\n", "  The concept of quasi-integrability has been examined in the context of\ndeformations of the defocusing non-linear Schr\\\"odinger model (NLS). Our\nresults show that the quasi-integrability concept, recently discussed in the\ncontext of deformations of the sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd and focusing NLS\nmodels, holds for the modified defocusing NLS model with dark soliton solutions\nand it exhibits the new feature of an infinite sequence of alternating\nconserved and asymptotically conserved charges. For the special case of two\ndark soliton solutions, where the field components are eigenstates of a\nspace-reflection symmetry, the first four and the sequence of even order\ncharges are exactly conserved in the scattering process of the solitons. Such\nresults are obtained through analytical and numerical methods, and employ\nadaptations of algebraic techniques used in integrable field theories. We\nperform extensive numerical simulations and consider the scattering of dark\nsolitons for the cubic-quintic NLS model with potential $V =\\eta I^2 -\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{6} I^3 $ and the saturable type potential satisfying $V'[I] =2\n\\eta I - \\frac{\\epsilon I^q}{1+ I^q},\\,q \\in \\IZ_{+}$, with a deformation\nparameter $\\epsilon \\in \\IR$ and $I=|\\psi|^2$. The issue of the renormalization\nof the charges and anomalies, and their (quasi)conservation laws are properly\naddressed. The saturable NLS supports elastic scattering of two soliton\nsolutions for a wide range of values of $\\{\\eta, \\epsilon, n\\}$. Our results\nmay find potential applications in several areas of non-linear science, such as\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation.\n", "  We have studied the temperature behavior of the electron spin resonance (ESR)\nspectra of nitrogen (N) donors in n-type 6H SiC crystals grown by Lely and\nsublimation sandwich methods (SSM) with donor concentration of 10^17 cm^(-3) at\nT=60-150 K. A broad signal in the ESR spectrum was observed at T>=80 K with\nLorentzian lineshape and gpar=2.0043(3), gper=2.0030(3), which was previously\nassigned in the literature to the N donors in the 1s(E) excited state. Based on\nthe analysis of the ESR lineshape, linewidth and g-tensor we attribute this\nsignal to the conduction electrons (CE). The emergence of the CE ESR signal at\nT>80 K was explained by the ionization of electrons from the 1s(A) ground and\n1s(E) excited states of N donors to the conduction band while the observed\nreduction of the hyperfine (hf) splitting for the Nk1,k2 donors with the\ntemperature increase is attributed to the motion narrowing effect of the hf\nsplitting. The temperature dependence of CE ESR linewidth is described by an\nexponential law (Orbach process) with the activation energy corresponding to\nthe energy separation between 1s(A1) and 1s(E) energy levels for N residing at\nquasi-cubic sites (Nk1,k2). The theoretical analysis of the temperature\ndependence of microwave conductivity measured by the contact-free method shows\nthat due to the different position of the Fermi level in two samples the\nionization of free electrons occurs from the energy levels of Nk1,k2 donors in\nLely grown samples and from the energy level of Nh residing at hexagonal\nposition in 6H SiC grown by SSM\n", "  Utilizing the high-resolution, large-scale LAOZI cosmological simulations we\ninvestigate the nature of the metal-poor (${\\rm [Z/H]<-2}$) damped Lyman alpha\nsystems (mpDLA) at $z=3$. The following physical picture of mpDLAs emerges. The\nmajority of mpDLAs inhabit regions $\\ge 20$~kpc from the host galaxy center on\ninfalling cold gas streams originating from the intergalactic medium, with\ninfall velocity of $\\sim 100$ km/s and temperature of $\\sim 10^{4}$ K. For each\nhost galaxy, on average, about $1\\%$ of the area within a radius $150$~kpc is\ncovered by mpDLAs. The mpDLAs are relatively diffuse ($n_{\\rm{gas}} \\sim\n10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$), Jeans quasi-stable, and have very low star formation rate\n($\\dot{\\Sigma} \\le 10^{-4} M_{\\odot} \\rm{\\ yr}^{-1} \\rm{\\ kpc}^{-2}$). As\nmpDLAs migrate inward to the galaxy center, they mix with high metallicity gas\nand stellar outflows in the process, removing themselves from the metal-poor\ncategory and rendering the central ($\\le 5$ kpc) regions of galaxies devoid of\nmpDLAs. Thus, the central regions of the host galaxies are populated by mostly\nmetal-rich DLAs instead of mpDLAs. All observables of the simulated mpDLAs are\nin excellent agreement with observations, except the gas density, which is\nabout a factor of ten lower than the value inferred observationally. However,\nthe observationally inferred value is based on simplified assumptions that are\nnot borne out in the simulations.\n", "  We compute the bulk entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in a\nPoincare AdS with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition when we trace\nout a half space. Moreover, by taking into account the quantum back reaction to\nthe minimal surface area, we calculate how much the entanglement entropy\nchanges under a double-trace deformation of a holographic CFT. In the AdS3/CFT2\nsetup, our result agrees with the known result in 2d CFTs. In higher\ndimensions, our results offer holographic predictions.\n", "  We propose to implement tunable interaction of superconducting flux qubits\nwith cavity-assisted interaction and strong driving. The qubits have a\nthree-level Lambda configuration, and the decay of the excited state will be\ngreatly suppressed due to the effective large detuning. The implemented\ninteraction is insensitive to the cavity field state and can be controlled by\nmodulating the phase difference of the driving fields of the qubits. In\nparticular, our scheme is based on the typical circuit QED setup and thus will\nprovide a simple method towards the tunable interaction of superconducting\nqubits. Finally, we consider the generation of two and four qubits entangled\nstates with the constructed interaction under the influence of typical\ndecoherence effects.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize controllable quantum state transfer and\nentanglement generation among transmon qubits in the typical circuit QED setup\nbased on adiabatic passage. Through designing the time-dependent driven pulses\napplied on the transmon qubits, we find that fast quantum sate transfer can be\nachieved between arbitrary two qubits and quantum entanglement among the qubits\nalso can also be engineered. Furthermore, we numerically analyzed the influence\nof the decoherence on our scheme with the current experimental accessible\nsystematical parameters. The result shows that our scheme is very robust\nagainst both the cavity decay and qubit relaxation, the fidelities of the state\ntransfer and entanglement preparation process could be very high. In addition,\nour scheme is also shown to be insensitive to the inhomogeneous of\nqubit-resonator coupling strengths.\n", "  In a recent paper the so-called Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA) technique\nhas been applied to the N-dimensional Taub-NUT system, a maximally\nsuperintegrable Hamiltonian system which can be interpreted as a one-parameter\ndeformation of the Kepler-Coulomb system. Such a Hamiltonian is associated to a\nspecific Bertrand space of non-constant curvature. The SGA procedure unveils\nthe symmetry algebra underlying the Hamiltonian system and, moreover, enables\none to solve the equations of motion. Here we will follow the same path to\ntackle the Darboux III system, another maximally superintegrable system, which\ncan indeed be viewed as a natural deformation of the isotropic harmonic\noscillator where the flat Euclidean space is again replaced by another space of\nnon-constant curvature.\n", "  Chemical abundance studies of the Sun and solar twins have demonstrated that\nthe solar composition of refractory elements is depleted when compared to\nvolatile elements, which could be due to the formation of terrestrial planets.\nIn order to further examine this scenario, we conducted a line-by-line\ndifferential chemical abundance analysis of the terrestrial planet host\nKepler-10 and fourteen of its stellar twins. Stellar parameters and elemental\nabundances of Kepler-10 and its stellar twins were obtained with very high\nprecision using a strictly differential analysis of high quality CFHT, HET and\nMagellan spectra. When compared to the majority of thick disc twins, Kepler-10\nshows a depletion in the refractory elements relative to the volatile elements,\nwhich could be due to the formation of terrestrial planets in the Kepler-10\nsystem. The average abundance pattern corresponds to ~ 13 Earth masses, while\nthe two known planets in Kepler-10 system have a combined ~ 20 Earth masses.\nFor two of the eight thick disc twins, however, no depletion patterns are\nfound. Although our results demonstrate that several factors (e.g., planet\nsignature, stellar age, stellar birth location and Galactic chemical evolution)\ncould lead to or affect abundance trends with condensation temperature, we find\nthat the trends give further support for the planetary signature hypothesis.\n", "  We combine several numerical and semi-analytical methods to study the $5d$\ndouble perovskites Sr2YIRO6 and Ba2YIRO6 which were recently proposed to\nexhibit excitonic magnetism. Starting from the density functional theory and\nconstrained random phase approximation we construct effective multi-band\nHubbard models. These are analyzed by means of static and dynamical mean-field\ntheories and strong coupling expansion. We find both materials to be\ninsulators, but, contrary to the experimental claims, with a large spin gap of\nseveral hundreds meV preventing formation of an ordered state at low\ntemperature\n", "  Complete fusion excitation functions of reactions involving breakup are\nstudied by using the empirical coupled-channel (ECC) model with breakup effects\nconsidered. An exponential function with two parameters is adopted to describe\nthe prompt-breakup probability in the ECC model. These two parameters are fixed\nby fitting the measured prompt-breakup probability or the complete fusion cross\nsections. The suppression of complete fusion at energies above the Coulomb\nbarrier is studied by comparing the data with the predictions from the ECC\nmodel without the breakup channel considered. The results show that the\nsuppression of complete fusion are roughly independent of the target for the\nreactions involving the same projectile.\n", "  I first calculate the charged spherical Renyi entropy by a numerical method\nthat does not require knowledge of any eigenvalue degeneracies, and applies to\nall odd dimensions.\n  An image method is used to relate the full sphere values to those for an\ninteger covering, n. It is shown to be equivalent to a `transformation'\nproperty of the zeta--function.\n  The infinite limit is explicitly constructed analytically and a relation\ndeduced between the limits of corner coefficients and the effective action\n(free energy) which generalises, for free fields, a result of Bueno, Myers and\nWitczak--Krempa and Elvang and Hadjiantonis to any dimension.\n  Finally, the known polynomial expressions for the Renyi entropy on even\nspheres at zero chemical potential are re--derived in a different form and a\nsimple formula for the conformal anomaly given purely in terms of central\nfactorials is obtained.\n", "  We propose new mechanism for inflation using classical SU(2) Yang-Mills (YM)\nhomogeneous and isotropic field non-minimally coupled to gravity via Horndeski\nprescription. This is the unique generally and gauge covariant ghost-free YM\ntheory with the curvature-dependent action leading to second-order gravity and\nYang-Mills field equations. We show that its solution space contains de Sitter\nboundary to which the trajectories are attracted for some finite time, ensuring\nthe robust inflation with a graceful exit. The theory can be generalized to\ninclude the Higgs field leading to two-steps inflationary scenario, in which\nthe Planck-scale YM-generated inflation naturally prepares the desired initial\nconditions for the GUT-scale Higgs inflation.\n", "  The temperature ($T$) as a function of pressure ($P$) phase diagram is\nreported for the cubic Laves phase compound Au$_2$Pb, which was recently\nproposed to support linearly dispersing \"topological\" bands, together with\nconventional quadratic bands. At ambient pressure, Au$_2$Pb exhibits several\nstructural phase transitions at $T_1$ $=$ 97 K, $T_2$ $=$ 51 K, and $T_3$ $=$\n40 K with superconductivity below $T_{\\rm{c}}$ $=$ 1.2 K. Applied pressure\nresults in a rich phase diagram where $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ evolve strongly\nwith $P$ and a new phase is stabilized for $P$ $>$ 0.64 GPa that also supports\nsuperconductivity below 1.1 K. These observations suggest that Au$_2$Pb is an\nideal system in which to investigate the relationship between structural\ndegrees of freedom, band topology, and resulting anomalous behaviors.\n", "  We introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,\nmassive galaxies that are systematically missed by Lyman-break selection. The\nnew selection is based on the H_{160} and IRAC 4.5um bands, specifically H -\n[4.5] > 2.25 mag. These galaxies, dubbed \"HIEROs\", include two major\npopulations that can be separated with an additional J - H color. The\npopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z > 3 (JH-blue) and\nextremely dusty galaxies at z < 3 (JH-red). The 350 arcmin^2 of the GOODS-N and\nGOODS-S fields with the deepest HST/WFC3 and IRAC data contain 285 HIEROs down\nto [4.5] < 24 mag. We focus here primarily on JH-blue (z > 3) HIEROs, which\nhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massM_{*}~10^{10.6} Msun,\nand are much fainter in the rest-frame UV than similarly massive Lyman-break\ngalaxies (LBGs). Their star formation rates (SFRs) reaches ~240 Msun yr^{-1}\nleading to a specific SFR, sSFR ~4.2 Gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the sSFRs for\nmassive galaxies continue to grow at z > 2 but at a lower growth rate than from\nz=0 to z=2. With a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compact\nas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, JH-blue HIEROs represent perfect\nstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (M_{*} > 10^{11.2} Msun) compact\nquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. HIEROs make up\n~60% of all galaxies with M_{*} > 10^{10.5} Msun identified at z > 3 from their\nphotometric redshifts. This is five times more than LBGs with nearly no overlap\nbetween the two populations. While HIEROs make up 15-25% of the total SFR\ndensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the SFR density taking place in\nM_{*} >10^{10.5} Msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding the\nvery early phase of massive galaxy formation.\n", "  Electron transport properties of a topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin\nfilm are studied in Hall-bar geometry. The film with a thickness of 10 nm is\ngrown by van der Waals epitaxy on fluorophlogopite mica and Hall-bar devices\nare fabricated from the as-grown film directly on the mica substrate. Weak\nantilocalization and electron-electron interaction effects are observed and\nanalyzed at low temperatures. The phase-coherence length extracted from the\nmeasured weak antilocalization characteristics shows a strong power-law\nincrease with decreasing temperature and the transport in the film is shown to\noccur via coupled multiple (topological surface and bulk states) channels. The\nconductivity of the film shows a logarithmically decrease with decreasing\ntemperature and thus the electron-electron interaction plays a dominant role in\nquantum corrections to the conductivity of the film at low temperatures.\n", "  We study theoretically wave-vector and frequency dispersion of the complex\ndynamic conductivity tensor (DCT), $\\sigma_{lm}(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, of doped\nmonolayer graphene under a strong dc electric field. For a general analysis, we\nconsider the weak ac field of arbitrary configuration given by two independent\nvectors, the ac field polarization and the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The\nhigh-field transport and linear response to the ac field are described on the\nbase of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. We show that the real part of DCT,\ncalculated in the collisionless regime, is not zero due to dissipation of the\nac wave, whose energy is absorbed by the resonant Dirac quasiparticles\neffectively interacting with the wave. The role of the kinematic resonance at\n$\\omega = v_F |{\\bf k}|$ ($v_{F}$ is the Fermi velocity) is studied in detail\ntaking into account deviation from the linear energy spectrum and screening by\nthe charge carriers. The isopower-density curves and distributions of angle\nbetween the ac current density and field vectors are presented as a map which\nprovides clear graphic representation of the DCT anisotropy. Also, the map\nshows certain ac field configurations corresponding to a negative power\ndensity, thereby it indicates regions of terahertz frequency for possible\nelectrical (drift) instability in the graphene system.\n", "  Many of the scenarios proposed to explain the origin of chemically peculiar\nstars in globular clusters (GCs) require significant mass-loss ($\\ge95\\%$) to\nexplain the observed fraction of such stars. In the GCs of the Fornax dwarf\ngalaxy significant mass-loss could be a problem. Larsen et al. (2012) showed\nthat there is a large ratio of GCs to metal-poor field stars in Fornax and\nabout $20-25\\%$ of all the stars with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}<-2$ belong to the four\nmetal-poor GCs. This imposes an upper limit of $\\sim80\\%$ mass-loss that could\nhave happened in Fornax GCs. In this paper, we propose a solution to this\nproblem by suggesting that stars can leave the Fornax galaxy. We use a series\nof $N$-body simulations, to determine the limit of mass-loss from Fornax as a\nfunction of the initial orbital radii of GCs and the speed with which stars\nleave Fornax GCs. We consider a set of cored and cuspy density profiles for\nFornax. Our results show that with a cuspy model for Fornax, the fraction of\nstars which leave the galaxy, can be as high as $\\sim90\\%$, when the initial\norbital radii of GCs are $R=2-3\\,\\rm{kpc}$ and the initial speed of stars is\n$v>20\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. We show that such large velocities can be achieved by\ngas expulsion induced mass-loss but not stellar evolution induced mass-loss.\nOur results imply that one cannot interpret the metallicity distribution of\nFornax field stars as evidence against significant mass-loss in Fornax GCs, if\nmass-loss is due to gas expulsion.\n", "  New results are reported from an ongoing international research effort to\naccurately determine the Avogadro constant by counting the atoms in an\nisotopically enriched silicon crystal. The surfaces of two 28Si-enriched\nspheres were decontaminated and reworked in order to produce an outer surface\nwithout metal contamination and improved sphericity. New measurements were then\nmade on these two reconditioned spheres using improved methods and apparatuses.\nWhen combined with other recently refined parameter measurements, the Avogadro\nconstant derived from these new results has a value of $N_A = 6.022 140 76(12)\n\\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$. The X-ray crystal density method has thus achieved\nthe target relative standard uncertainty of $2.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ necessary for\nthe realization of the definition of the new kilogram.\n", "  An additional value of the Avogadro constant was obtained by counting the\natoms in isotopically enriched Si spheres. With respect to the previous\ndetermination, the spheres were etched and repolished to eliminate metal\ncontaminations and to improve the roundness. In addition, all the input\nquantities -- molar mass, lattice parameter, mass, and volume -- were\nremeasured aiming at a smaller uncertainty. In order to make the values given\nRefs.\\ 1 and 2 usable for a least squares adjustment, we report about the\nestimate of their correlation.\n", "  The Physics Program for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at\nthe Fermilab Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) is described.\n", "  Using the asymptotic iteration method, we obtain the S-wave solution for a\nshort-range three-parameter central potential with 1/r singularity and with a\nnon-orbital barrier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at\ncalculating the energy spectrum for this potential, which was introduced by H.\nBahlouli and A. D. Alhaidari and for which they obtained the \"potential\nparameter spectrum\". Our results are also independently verified using a direct\nmethod of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the J-matrix basis.\n", "  We report high magnetic field measurements of magnetic torque, thermoelectric\npower (TEP), magnetization, and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect in CeIrIn$_5$\nacross 28 T, where a metamagnetic transition was suggested in previous studies.\nThe TEP displays two maxima at 28 T and 32 T. Above 28 T, a new, low dHvA\nfrequency with strongly enhanced effective mass emerges, while the highest\nfrequency observed at low field disappears entirely. This suggests a\nfield-induced Lifshitz transition. However, longitudinal magnetization does not\nshow any anomaly up to 33 T, thus ruling out a metamagnetic transition at 28 T.\n", "  We employ a semi-classical Langevin approach to study current-induced atomic\ndynamics in a partially dehydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbon. All\nparameters are obtained from density functional theory. The dehydrogenated\ncarbon dimers behave as effective impurities, whose motion decouples from the\nrest of carbon atoms. The electrical current can couple the dimer motion in a\ncoherent fashion. The coupling, which is mediated by nonconservative and\npseudo-magnetic current-induced forces, change the atomic dynamics, and thereby\nshow their signature in this simple system. We study the atomic dynamics and\ncurrent-induced vibrational instabilities using a simplified eigen-mode\nanalysis.Our study shows that the armchair nanoribbon serves as a possible\ntestbed for probing the current-induced forces.\n", "  The internal energy of magnetic anisotropy for some nanoparticles dominates\nover the thermal energy even at room temperature. Strong magnetic anisotropy of\nnanoparticles can significantly affect the process of magnetization of the\nmagnetic fluid. This influence is substantial if the system of nanoparticles is\nin a state of mechanical anisotropy in which the anisotropy axes of the\nparticles have the same direction. In this work, it is shown that the\nmagnetization curve of the magnetic fluid in a state of mechanical anisotropy\nis significantly different from that of Langevin. It is located between the\nLangevin and hyperbolic tangent curves and with increasing anisotropy takes\nprogressively the hyperbolic tangent shape. It is also shown that in case of\npowder samples, the mechanical anisotropy leads to substantial quantitative\nchanges in the Curie law.\n", "  We find three dense subsets $\\Sigma_I,\\Sigma_{II}$ and $\\Sigma_{III}$ of the\nspectrum of the Thue-Morse Hamiltonian, such that each energy in $\\Sigma_I$ is\nextended, each energy in $\\Sigma_{II}$ is pseudo-localized and each energy in\n$\\Sigma_{III}$ is one-sided pseudo-localized. We also obtain exact estimations\non the norm of the transfer matrices and the norm of the formal solutions for\nthese energies. Especially, for $E\\in \\Sigma_{II}\\cup\\Sigma_{III}, $ the norms\nof the transfer matrices behave like $$ e^{c_1\\gamma\\sqrt{n}}\\le\\|T_{n}(E)\\|\\le\ne^{c_2\\gamma\\sqrt{n}}. $$ The local dimensions of the spectral measure on these\nsubsets are also studied. The local dimension is $0$ for energy in\n$\\Sigma_{II}$ and is larger than $1$ for energy in\n$\\Sigma_{I}\\cup\\Sigma_{III}.$ In summary, the Thue-Morse Hamiltonian exhibits\n\"mixed spectral nature\".\n", "  The outline of the two lectures given in \"Dense Matter School 2015\" is\npresented. After an overview on the relevance of the phase diagram to heavy-ion\ncollisions and compact star phenomena, I show some basic formulae to discuss\nthe QCD phase diagram in the mean field treatment of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. Next, I introduce the strong-coupling lattice QCD, which is one of the\npromising methods to access the QCD phase diagram including the first order\nphase boundary. In the last part, I discuss the QCD phase diagram in asymmetric\nmatter, which should be formed in compact star phenomena.\n", "  In 2002, I proposed a unique $U(1)$ extension of the supersymmetric standard\nmodel which has no $\\mu$ term and conserves baryon number and lepton number\nseparately and automatically. This model, ${without~any~change}$, has all the\nnecessary and sufficient ingredients to explain the possible 750 GeV diphoton\nexcess, observed recently by the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). It is associated with the superfield which replaces the $\\mu$\nparameter. If confirmed and supported by subsequent data, it may even be\nconsidered as the first evidence for supersymmetry.\n", "  Magnetic fields play a role in almost all stages of stellar evolution. Most\nlow-mass stars, including the Sun, show surface fields that are generated by\ndynamo processes in their convective envelopes. Intermediate-mass stars do not\nhave deep convective envelopes, although 10% exhibit strong surface fields that\nare presumed to be residuals from the stellar formation process. These stars do\nhave convective cores that might produce internal magnetic fields, and these\nmight even survive into later stages of stellar evolution, but information has\nbeen limited by our inability to measure the fields below the stellar surface.\nHere we use asteroseismology to study the occurrence of strong magnetic fields\nin the cores of low- and intermediate-mass stars. We have measured the strength\nof dipolar oscillation modes, which can be suppressed by a strong magnetic\nfield in the core, in over 3600 red giant stars observed by Kepler. About 20%\nof our sample show mode suppression but this fraction is a strong function of\nmass. Strong core fields only occur in red giants above 1.1 solar masses\n(1.1Msun), and the occurrence rate is at least 60% for intermediate-mass stars\n(1.6--2.0Msun), indicating that powerful dynamos were very common in the\nconvective cores of these stars.\n", "  We study the vortex lattice dynamics in presence of single impurity as well\nas random impurities or disorder. We show that in presence of a single impurity\nthe vortex lattice gets distorted and the distortion depends on the position of\nthe single impurity with respect to the positions of the vortices in the\nimpurity free Abrikosov vortex lattice and also the strength of the impurity\npotential. We then show that a new type of giant hole with hidden vortices\ninside it can be created in the vortex lattice by a cluster of impurities. In\npresence of random impurity potential or disorder the vortex lattice melts. We\nshow that the vortex lattice also melts in presence of pseudorandom potential\ngenerated by the superposition of two optical lattices. The absence of\nlong-range order in the melted vortex lattice is demonstrated from the\nstructure factor profile and the histogram of the distances between each pair\nof the vortices.\n", "  We consider Friedel oscillation in the two-dimensional Dirac materials when\nFermi level is near the van Hove singularity. Twisted graphene bilayer and the\nsurface state of topological crystalline insulator are the representative\nmaterials which show low-energy saddle points that are feasible to probe by\ngating. We approximate the Fermi surface near saddle point with a hyperbola and\ncalculate the static Lindhard response function. Employing a theorem of\nLighthill, the induced charge density $\\delta n$ due to an impurity is obtained\nand the algebraic decay of $\\delta n$ is determined by the singularity of the\nstatic response function. Although a hyperbolic Fermi surface is rather\ndifferent from a circular one, the static Lindhard response function in the\npresent case shows a singularity similar with the response function associated\nwith circular Fermi surface, which leads to the $\\delta n\\propto R^{-2}$ at\nlarge distance $R$. The dependences of charge density on the Fermi energy are\ndifferent. Consequently, it is possible to observe in twisted graphene bilayer\nthe evolution that $\\delta n\\propto R^{-3}$ near Dirac point changes to $\\delta\nn\\propto R^{-2}$ above the saddle point. Measurements using scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy around the impurity sites could verify the prediction.\n", "  We consider a scheme of multiplexed cold atomic ensembles that generate a\nfrequency-entangled biphoton state with controllable entropy of entanglement.\nThe biphoton state consists of a telecommunication photon (signal) immediately\nfollowed by an infrared one (idler) via four-wave mixing with two classical\npump fields. Multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency and phase-shifted\nsignal and idler emissions, we can manipulate and control the spectral property\nof the biphoton state. Mapping out the entropy of entanglement in the scheme\nprovides the optimal configuration for entanglement resources. This paves the\nway for efficient long-distance quantum communication and for potentially\nuseful multimode structures in quantum information processing.\n", "  Impurity scattering in a superconductor may serve as an important probe for\nthe nature of superconducting pairing state. Here we report the impurity effect\non superconducting transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ in the newly\ndiscovered Cr-based superconductor K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$. The resistivity\nmeasurements show that the crystals prepared using high-purity Cr metal\n($\\geq$99.99\\%) have an electron mean free path much larger than the\nsuperconducting coherence length. For the crystals prepared using impure Cr\nthat contains various \\emph{nonmagnetic} impurities, however, the\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$ decreases significantly, in accordance with the generalized\nAbrikosov-Gor'kov pair-breaking theory. This finding supports a non-$s$-wave\nsuperconductivity in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.\n", "  In the present paper we consider the dynamics of special class of modulated\nregimes emerging in the Klein-Gordon trimer. In particular, this study unveils\nthe unique states of resonant energy transfer manifested by the regular energy\npulsations localized on the first two elements of the chain. This state is\nregarded as the higher dimensional analog of limiting phase trajectory\ncorresponding to the regime of maximal energy transfer in the 2DOF, anharmonic,\noscillatory models. We show that in contrast to the limiting phase\ntrajectories, this special state of local energy transfer emerging in the\nKlein-Gordon trimer undergoes additional transition leading to its complete\nelimination. By employing the special order reduction procedure, we describe\nanalytically the mechanism of formation and destruction of this peculiar,\ndynamical state. Finally, we demonstrate the strong correlation between the\nbifurcations of this state to the series of spontaneous transitions from\nlocalized to delocalized energy pulsations undergone by the impulsive response\nof the Klein-Gordon trimer. Results of the analytical model are well in\nagreement with these of the numerical simulations.\n", "  It has been found that Markovian quantum dissipative processes, described by\nthe Lindblad equation, may have attractive steady-state manifolds, in which\ndissipation and decoherence can play a positive role to quantum information\nprocessing. In this article, we show that such attractive steady-state\nmanifolds with the same positive features as in Markovian dissipative processes\ncan exist in the non-Markovian dissipative processes. Our finding indicates\nthat the dissipation-assisted schemes implemented in the Markovian systems can\nbe directly generalized to the non-Markovian systems.\n", "  The authors present here a new method to image reinforcement elements inside\nthick structures and the results of a demonstration measurement performed on a\nmock-up wall built at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The method, referred to\nas \"multiple scattering muon radiography\", relies on the use of cosmic-ray\nmuons as probes. The work described in this article was performed to prove the\nviability of the technique as a means to image the interior of the dome of\nFlorence Cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore, one of the UNESCO World Heritage\nsites and among the highest profile buildings in existence. Its result shows\nthe effectiveness of the technique as a tool to radiograph thick structures and\nimage denser object inside them.\n", "  The latest determination of the Avogadro constant, carried out by counting\nthe atoms in a pure silicon crystal highly enriched in 28Si, reached the target\n2x10-8 relative uncertainty required for the redefinition of the kilogram based\non the Planck constant. The knowledge of the isotopic composition of the\nenriched silicon material is central; it is measured by isotope dilution mass\nspectrometry. In this work, an independent estimate of the 30Si mole fraction\nwas obtained by applying a relative measurement protocol based on Instrumental\nNeutron Activation Analysis. The amount of 30Si isotope was determined by\ncounting the 1266.1 keV gamma-photons emitted during the radioactive decay of\nthe radioisotope 31Si produced via the neutron capture reaction\n30Si(n,gamma)31Si. The x(30Si) = 1.043(19)x10-6 mol mol-1 is consistent with\nthe value currently adopted by the International Avogadro Coordination.\n", "  Entropic dynamics is a framework in which quantum theory is derived as an\napplication of entropic methods of inference. Entropic dynamics on flat spaces\nhas been extensively studied. The objective of this paper is to extend the\nentropic dynamics of $N$ particles to curved spaces. The important new feature\nis that the displacement of a particle does not transform like a vector because\nfluctuations can be large enough to feel the effects of curvature. The final\nresult is a modified Schr\\\"odinger equation in which the usual Laplacian is\nreplaced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\n", "  We demonstrate both analytically and numerically the existence of optical\npulling forces acting on particles located near plasmonic interfaces. Two main\nfactors contribute to the appearance of this negative reaction force. The\ninterference between the incident and reflected waves induces a rotating dipole\nwith an asymmetric scattering pattern while the directional excitation of\nsurface plasmon polaritons (SPP) enhances the linear momentum of scattered\nlight. The strongly asymmetric SPP excitation is determined by spin-orbit\ncoupling of the rotating dipole and surface plasmon polariton. As a result of\nthe total momentum conservation, the force acting on the particle points in a\ndirection opposite to the incident wave propagation. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the force acting on a dipolar particles placed in the proximity\nof plasmonic surfaces. Analytical expressions for this pulling force are\nderived within the dipole approximation and are in excellent agreement with\nresults of electromagnetic numerical calculations. The forces acting on larger\nparticles are analyzed numerically, beyond the dipole approximation.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of charm particle production in hadron collisions,\nfocusing on the production of charm particles that carry a large fraction of\nthe momentum of the incident proton. In the case of strange particles, such a\ncomponent is familiar from the abundant production of $K^+\\Lambda$ pairs.\nModern collider experiments have no coverage in the very large rapidity region\nwhere the forward pair production dominates. While forward charm particles are\nproduced inside the LHC beampipe, they dominate the high-energy atmospheric\nneutrino flux in underground experiments because long-lived pions and kaons\ninteract before decaying into neutrinos. The fragmentation of the spectator\nquark in the partonic subprocesses $qc \\rightarrow qc$ and $gc \\rightarrow gc$\nis responsible for the forward component of charm production in perturbative\nQCD. We use this phenomenological framework to construct a charm cross section\nthat saturates available accelerator and cosmic ray data, i.e., it represents\nan upper limit on the normalization of the charm cross section that cannot be\nreliably calculated because the charm mass is much smaller than the\ncenter-of-mass energy. Where the highest energy IceCube observations are\nconcerned, we conclude that the upper limit on the flux of neutrinos from\nforward charm production may dominate the much-studied central component. It\nmay therefore also represent a significant contribution to the TeV atmospheric\nneutrino flux but cannot accommodate the PeV flux of high-energy cosmic\nneutrinos observed by IceCube, or even the excess of events observed in the 30\nTeV energy range.\n", "  Analysis of directed flow ($v_1$) of protons, antiprotons and pions in\nheavy-ion collisions is performed in the range of collision energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.7--39 GeV. Simulations have been done within a three-fluid\nmodel employing a purely hadronic equation of state (EoS) and two versions of\nthe EoS with deconfinement transitions: a first-order phase transition and a\nsmooth crossover transition. The crossover EoS is unambiguously preferable for\nthe description of the most part of experimental data in this energy range. The\ndirected flow indicates that the crossover deconfinement transition takes place\nin semicentral Au+Au collisions in a wide range of collision energies 4\n\\lsim\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\lsim$ 30 GeV. The obtained results suggest that the\ndeconfinement EoS's in the quark-gluon sector should be stiffer at high baryon\ndensities than those used in the calculation. The latter finding is in\nagreement with that discussed in astrophysics.\n", "  The amount and spatial pattern of heat extracted from cores of terrestrial\nplanets is ultimately controlled by the thermal structure of the lower rocky\nmantle. Using the most common model to tackle this problem, a rapidly rotating\nand differentially cooled spherical shell containing an incompressible and\nviscous liquid is numerically investigated. To gain the physical basics, we\nconsider a simple, equatorial symmetric perturbation of the CMB heat flux\nshaped as a spherical harmonic $Y_{11}$. The thermodynamic properties of the\ninduced flows mainly depend on the degree of nonlinearity parametrised by a\nhorizontal Rayleigh number $Ra_h=q^\\ast Ra$, where $q^\\ast$ is the relative CMB\nheat flux anomaly amplitude and $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number which controls\nradial buoyancy-driven convection. Depending on $Ra_h$ we characterise three\nflow regimes through their spatial patterns, heat transport and flow speed\nscalings: in the linear conductive regime the radial inward flow is found to be\nphase shifted $90^\\circ$ eastwards from the maximal heat flux as predicted by a\nlinear quasi-geostrophic model for rapidly rotating spherical systems. The\nadvective regime is characterised by an increased $Ra_h$ where nonlinearities\nbecome significant, but is still subcritical to radial convection. There the\nupwelling is dispersed and the downwelling is compressed by the thermal\nadvection into a spiralling jet-like structure. As $Ra_h$ becomes large enough\nfor the radial convection to set in, the jet remains identifiable on\ntime-average and significantly alters the global heat budget in the convective\nregime. Our results suggest, that the boundary forcing not only introduces a\nnet horizontal heat transport but also suppresses the convection locally to\nsuch an extent, that the net Nusselt number is reduced by up to 50\\%, even\nthough the mean CMB heat flux is conserved.\n", "  We present updated results of a numerical improvement test with heavy-meson\nspectrum for the Oktay--Kronfeld (OK) action. The OK action is an extension of\nthe Fermilab improvement program for massive Wilson fermions including all\ndimension-six and some dimension-seven bilinear terms. Improvement terms are\ntruncated by HQET power counting at $\\mathrm{O}(\\Lambda^3/m_Q^3)$ for\nheavy-light systems, and by NRQCD power counting at $\\mathrm{O}(v^6)$ for\nquarkonium. They suffice for tree-level matching to QCD to the given order in\nthe power-counting schemes. To assess the improvement, we generate new data\nwith the OK and Fermilab action that covers both charm and bottom quark mass\nregions on a MILC coarse $(a \\approx 0.12~\\text{fm})$ $2+1$ flavor,\nasqtad-staggered ensemble. We update the analyses of the inconsistency quantity\nand the hyperfine splittings for the rest and kinetic masses. With one\nexception, the results clearly show that the OK action significantly reduces\nheavy-quark discretization effects in the meson spectrum. The exception is the\nhyperfine splitting of the heavy-light system near the $B_s$ meson mass, where\nstatistics are too low to draw a firm conclusion, despite promising results.\n", "  The categorical compositional distributional model of natural language\nprovides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of\nsentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This\napproach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language\nprocessing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of\nlexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning.\n  In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical\ncompositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract\ncategorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the\nintroduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical\nsemantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation.\n  The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a\nnovel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts.\nThis graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate\nentailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our\ngraded order.\n  Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the\nsentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the\nessential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a\nprocedure for calculating entailment strength.\n", "  The Superspinorial Dual-covariant Field Theory (SSFT) developed in papers [1,\n2] is treated in terms of Riemannian coordinates (RC) [7, 8] in space of the N\ndimensions unified manifold (UM). Metric tensor of UM (grand metric, GM) is\nbuilt on the split metric matrices (SM) [1] which are a proportion of the\nCartan's affinors (an extended analog of Dirac's matrices) of his Theory of\nSpinors [3] as explicated in [2]. Transition to RC based on consideration of\ngeodesics is described. A principal property of an orthogonal RC frame (ORC)\nutilized in the present paper is constancy of the rotation matrix A of the\nRiemannian space of UM, while transformation matrix B of the dual\nsuperspinorial state vector field (DSV) varies together with Cartan's affinors\naccording to the dynamical law of SSFT derived in [2]. The spinorial genesis of\nnotion of the orthogonality as aspect of irreducible SSFT is pointed out in the\npresent paper. The main outcome of resorting to an orthogonal RC frame (ORC) is\nexplication of the conformal dynamic invariance of metric i.e. constancy of\nratio between components of GM in ORC frame. This leads to possibility of\nreduction of algebraic equations of SSFT for the SM [2] to equation for GM\ndeterminant where GM signature plays a role of N discrete parameters\nnon-specified in advance.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes are a feverishly-studied topic in the scientific community\nas of late. Mathematically, they can be modeled with a quantum graph. Here we\nconsider a structure somewhat similar to carbon nanotubes, another quantum\ngraph that is formed by rolling a square lattice instead of a graphene\nstructure. This symmetry imposes properties that make certain motions easier to\nstudy by creating convenient pairs of incoming and outgoing motions.\n", "  We study the polyhedral geometry of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the weights\nof the first and the second fundamental representations of $sl_n$ inside the\ndual fundamental Weyl chamber. We obtain generating functions that enumerate\nthe flats and the faces of a fixed dimension. In addition, we describe the\nextreme rays of the incidence geometry and classify simplicial faces.\n  From the perspective of supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges in\nfive dimensional spacetime, the poset of flats is isomorphic to the network of\nmixed Coulomb-Higgs branches. On the other hand, the poset of faces is\nconjectured to be isomorphic to the network of crepant partial resolutions of\nan elliptic fibration with gauge algebra $sl_n$ and \"matter representation\"\ngiven by the sum of the first two fundamental representations.\n", "  The curtain of technical limitations impeding rat multichannel non-invasive\nelectroencephalography (EEG) has risen. Given the importance of this\npreclinical model, development and validation of EEG source imaging (ESI) is\nessential. We investigate the validity of well-known human ESI methodologies in\nrats which individual tissue geometries have been approximated by those\nextracted from an MRI template, leading also to imprecision in electrode\nlocalizations. With the half and fifth sensitivity volumes we determine both\nthe theoretical minimum electrode separation for non-redundant scalp EEG\nmeasurements and the electrode sensitivity resolution, which vary over the\nscalp because of the head geometry. According to our results, electrodes should\nbe at least ~3-3.5 mm apart for an optimal configuration. The sensitivity\nresolution is generally worse for electrodes at the boundaries of the scalp\nmeasured region, though, by analogy with human montages, concentrates the\nsensitivity enough to localize sources. Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds of source\nlocalization errors indicate it is theoretically possible to achieve ESI\naccuracy at the level of anatomical structures, such as the stimulus-specific\nsomatosensory areas, using the template. More validation for this approximation\nis provided through the comparison between the template and the individual lead\nfield matrices, for several rats. Finally, using well-accepted inverse methods,\nwe demonstrate that somatosensory ESI is not only expected but also allows\nexploring unknown phenomena related to global sensory integration. Inheriting\nthe advantages and pitfalls of human ESI, rat ESI will boost the understanding\nof brain pathophysiological mechanisms and the evaluation of ESI methodologies,\nnew pharmacological treatments and ESI-based biomarkers.\n", "  The description of shock waves beyond the shock point is a challenge in\nnonlinear physics. Finding solutions to the global dynamics of dispersive shock\nwaves is not always possible due to the lack of integrability. Here we propose\na new method based on the eigenstates (Gamow vectors) of a reversed harmonic\noscillator in a rigged Hilbert space. These vectors allow analytical\nformulation for the development of undular bores of shock waves in a nonlinear\nnonlocal medium. Experiments by a photothermal induced nonlinearity confirm\ntheoretical predictions: as the undulation period as a function of power and\nthe characteristic quantized decays of Gamow vectors. Our results demonstrate\nthat Gamow vector are a novel and effective paradigm for describing extreme\nnonlinear phenomena.\n", "  Gamma-ray observations have shown pulsars to be efficient converters of\nrotational energy into GeV photons and it is of wide-ranging interest to\ndetermine their contribution to the gamma-ray background. We arrive at flux\npredictions from both the young (<~ Myr) and millisecond (~Gyr) Galactic pulsar\npopulations. We find that unresolved pulsars can yield both a significant\nfraction of the excess GeV gamma rays near the Galactic Center and an inverse\nCompton flux in the inner kpc similar to that inferred by Fermi. We compare\nmodels of the young pulsar population and millisecond pulsar population to\nconstraints from gamma-ray and radio observations. Overall, we find that the\nyoung pulsars should outnumber millisecond pulsars as unassociated gamma-ray\npoint sources in this region. The number of young radio pulsars discovered near\nthe Galactic Center is in agreement with our model of the young pulsar\npopulation. Deeper radio observations at higher latitudes can constrain the\ntotal gamma-ray emission from both young and millisecond pulsars from the inner\ngalaxy. While this is a step towards better understanding of pulsars, cosmic\nrays in the Milky Way, and searches for dark matter, we also discuss a few\ninteresting puzzles that arise from the underlying physics of pulsar emission\nand evolution.\n", "  I review the current status of quarkonium production theory based on the\nnon-relativistic QCD factorization formalism (NRQCD). While this theory\ndescribes much of the world's data on J/\\psi and \\Upsilon production, there are\nstill outstanding problems, most notably the polarization of quarkonia at large\np_T in hadron colliders. In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD\ninvolving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of\nhadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable\nmatching coefficients. I show how the FJFs for quarkonia can be calculated in\nNRQCD in terms of a few NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDME), so the\ndependence of the cross section on the energy fraction of the heavy quarkonium,\nz, is sensitive to the underlying production mechanism, and therefore provides\na new test of NRQCD. The jet energy and z dependence of the cross section can\nbe used to perform an independent extraction of NRQCD LDME. Finally, I describe\nongoing work building on this result. This includes comparison of analytic\nresummed calculations with Monte Carlo simulations for two-jet events in e^+e^-\ncollisions with B mesons, and three-jet events with J/\\psi, as well as the\ndefinition of boost invariant jet substructure variables and calculation of a\nboost invariant soft function that are necessary for analytic calculations of\njet cross sections at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We present a simple experimental scheme, based on standard atom optics\ntechniques, to design highly versatile model systems for the study of single\nparticle quantum transport phenomena. The scheme is based on a discrete set of\nfree-particle momentum states that are coupled via momentum-changing two-photon\nBragg transitions, driven by pairs of interfering laser beams. In the effective\nlattice models that are accessible, this scheme allows for single-site\ndetection, as well as site-resolved and dynamical control over all system\nparameters. We discuss two possible implementations, based on state-preserving\nBragg transitions and on state-changing Raman transitions, which respectively\nallow for the study of nearly arbitrary single particle Abelian U(1) and\nnon-Abelian U(2) lattice models.\n", "  The work describes the properties of the high-pressure superconducting state\nin phosphor: $p\\in\\{20, 30, 40, 70\\}$ GPa. The calculations were performed in\nthe framework of the Eliashberg formalism, which is the natural generalization\nof the BCS theory. The exceptional attention was paid to the accurate\npresentation of the used analysis scheme. With respect to the superconducting\nstate in phosphor it was shown that: (i) the observed not-high values of the\ncritical temperature ($\\left[T_{C}\\right]_{p=30{\\rm GPa}}^{\\rm max}=8.45$ K)\nresult not only from the low values of the electron - phonon coupling constant,\nbut also from the very strong depairing Coulomb interactions, (ii) the\ninconsiderable strong - coupling and retardation effects force the\ndimensionless ratios $R_{\\Delta}$, $R_{C}$, and $R_{H}$ - related to the\ncritical temperature, the order parameter, the specific heat and the\nthermodynamic critical field - to take the values close to the BCS predictions.\n", "  Electrical analogues of fracture, such as the fuse network model, are widely\nstudied. However, the \"analogy\" between the electrical problem and the elastic\nproblem is rarely established explicitly. Further, the fuse network is a\ndiscrete approximation to the continuous problem of fracture. It is rarely, if\never, shown that the discrete approximation indeed approaches its continuum\nlimit. We establish both of these correspondences directly.\n", "  This volume of the LBNF/DUNE Conceptual Design Report cover the Long-Baseline\nNeutrino Facility for DUNE and describes the LBNF Project, which includes\ndesign and construction of the beamline at Fermilab, the conventional\nfacilities at both Fermilab and SURF, and the cryostat and cryogenics\ninfrastructure required for the DUNE far detector.\n", "  Quantum correlations between two systems can be impaired by the presence of\nan environment, as it can make systems decohere. We wish to evaluate how much\ncoherence has been irreversibly lost. To do so, we study two qubits which leak\ncorrelations into an arbitrarily large environment and we find that our ability\nto steer one of them to the most coherent set of states possible by acting on\nthe other is given by the sub-fidelity of two conditional states of the\nenvironment. Sub-fidelity is a quantity that was already known, but that until\nnow lacked an operational interpretation. Furthermore, we conjecture the\nexistence of a family of measures, of which fidelity and sub-fidelity are the\nfirst two, which measure the irreversibility of decoherence as we gain access\nto more and more degrees of freedom of the enviroment.\n", "  Although some non-trivial photon number resolving detectors exist, it may\nstill be convenient to discriminate photon number states with the method of\nmultiplexed detection. Multiplexing can be performed with paths in real space,\nwith paths in time, and in principle with any degree of freedom that has a\nsufficient number of eigenstates and that can be coupled to the photon number.\nPrevious works have addressed the probabilities involved in these measurements\nwith Monte Carlo simulations, or by restricting the number of detectors to\npowers of 2, or without including quantum efficiency or noise. In this work we\nfind an analytical expression of the detection probabilities for any number of\ninput photons and any number of on/off photon detectors with a quantum\nefficiency $0\\%\\leq\\eta\\leq100\\%$ and a false count probability\n$\\varepsilon\\geq0$. This allows us to retrodict the number of photons that we\nhad at the input in the least unbiased way possible. We conclude our work with\nsome examples.\n", "  Mechanism of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability based on the Kutta-Zhoukovsky\ntheorem is considered. The mechanism itself generates the velocity shear,\nthereby redistributing the flow energy which drives the instability.\n", "  We define a set of procedures to numerically study the fate of ejecta\nproduced by the impact of an artificial projectile with the aim of deflecting\nan asteroid. Here we develop a simplified, idealized model of impact conditions\nthat can be adapted to fit the details of specific deflection-test scenarios,\nsuch as what is being proposed for the AIDA project. Ongoing studies based upon\nthe methodology described here can be used to inform observational strategies\nand safety conditions for an observing spacecraft. To account for ejecta\nevolution, the numerical strategies we are employing are varied and include a\nlarge N-Body component, a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) component, and\nan application of impactor scaling laws. Simulations that use SPH-derived\ninitial conditions show high-speed ejecta escaping at low angles of\ninclination, and very slowly moving ejecta lofting off the surface at higher\ninclination angles, some of which re-impacts the small-body surface. We are\ncurrently investigating the realism of this and other models' behaviors. Next\nsteps will include the addition of solar perturbations to the model and\napplying the protocol developed here directly to specific potential mission\nconcepts such as the proposed AIDA scenario.\n", "  In this paper we discuss how through the process of applying the Fourier\ntransform to solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in the Close Coupling\napproach, good results for the ionization differential cross section in energy\nfor electrons ejected in ion-atom collisions are obtained. The differential\ndistributions are time dependent and through their time average, the comparison\nwith experimental and theoretical data reported in the literature can be made.\nThe procedure is illustrated with reasonable success in two systems, $p+H$ and\n$p+He$, and is expected to be extended without inherent difficulties to more\ncomplex systems. This allows advancing in the understanding of the calculation\nof ionization processes in ion-atom collisions.\n", "  Hall effect measurements are important for elucidating the fundamental charge\ntransport mechanisms and intrinsic mobility in organic semiconductors. However,\nHall effect studies frequently reveal an unconventional behavior that cannot be\nreadily explained with the simple band-semiconductor Hall effect model. Here,\nwe develop an analytical model of Hall effect in organic field-effect\ntransistors in a regime of coexisting band and hopping carriers. The model,\nwhich is supported by the experiments, is based on a partial Hall voltage\ncompensation effect, occurring because hopping carriers respond to the\ntransverse Hall electric field and drift in the direction opposite to the\nLorentz force acting on band carriers. We show that this can lead in particular\nto an underdeveloped Hall effect observed in organic semiconductors with\nsubstantial off-diagonal thermal disorder. Our model explains the main features\nof Hall effect in a variety of organic semiconductors and provides an\nanalytical description of Hall mobility, carrier density and carrier coherence\nfactor.\n", "  In this manuscript, we proposed an interesting method to test the dual\nsupermassive black hole model for AGN with double-peaked narrow \\oiii lines\n(double-peaked narrow emitters), through their broad optical Balmer line\nproperties. Under the dual supermassive black hole model for double-peaked\nnarrow emitters, we could expect statistically smaller virial black hole masses\nestimated by observed broad Balmer line properties than true black hole masses\n(total masses of central two black holes). Then, we compare the virial black\nhole masses between a sample of 37 double-peaked narrow emitters with broad\nBalmer lines and samples of SDSS selected normal broad line AGN with\nsingle-peaked \\oiii lines. However, we can find clearly statistically larger\ncalculated virial black hole masses for the 37 broad line AGN with\ndouble-peaked \\oiii lines than for samples of normal broad line AGN. Therefore,\nwe give our conclusion that the dual supermassive black hole model is probably\nnot statistically preferred to the double-peaked narrow emitters, and more\nefforts should be necessary to carefully find candidates for dual supermassive\nblack holes by observed double-peaked narrow emission lines.\n", "  In this paper, by treating massive loop momenta to massless momenta in higher\ndimension, we are able to treat all-loop scattering equations as tree ones. As\nan application of the new aspect, we consider the CHY-construction of\nbi-adjoint phi_3 theory. We present the explicit formula for two-loop planar\nintegrands. We discuss carefully how to subtract various forward singularities\nin the construction. We count the number of terms obtained by our formula and\nby direct Feynman diagram calculation and find the perfect match, thus provide\na strong support for our results.\n", "  Combining monolayers of different two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors into\nheterostructures opens up a wealth of possibilities for novel electronic and\noptical functionalities. Exploiting them hinges on accurate measurements of the\nband parameters and orbital hybridization in separate and stacked monolayers,\nmany of which are only available as small samples. The recently introduced\ntechnique of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial\nresolution ({\\mu}-ARPES) offers the capability to measure small samples, but\nthe energy resolution obtained for such exfoliated samples to date (~0.5 eV)\nhas been inadequate. Here, we show that by suitable heterostructure sample\ndesign the full potential of {\\mu}-ARPES can be realized. We focus on\nMoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures, which are 2D analogs of 3D\nsemiconductor heterostructures. We find that in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer the\nbands in the K valleys are weakly hybridized, with the conduction and valence\nband edges originating in the MoSe2 and WSe2 respectively. There is stronger\nhybridization at the {\\Gamma} point, but the valence band edge remains at the K\npoints. This is consistent with the recent observation of interlayer excitons\nwhere the electron and hole are valley polarized but in opposite layers. We\ndetermine the valence band offset to be 300 meV, which combined with\nphotoluminescence measurements implies that the binding energy of interlayer\nexcitons is at least 200 meV, comparable with that of intralayer excitons.\n", "  Extreme scattering events (ESEs) are distinctive fluctuations in the\nbrightness of astronomical radio sources caused by occulting plasma lenses in\nthe interstellar medium. The inferred plasma pressures of the lenses are $\\sim\n10^3$ times the ambient pressure, challenging our understanding of gas\nconditions in the Milky Way. Using a new survey technique, we have discovered\nan ESE while it was in progress. We report radio and optical follow-up\nobservations. Modelling of the radio data demonstrates that the lensing\nstructure is a density enhancement and that the lens is diverging, ruling out\none of two competing physical models. Our technique will uncover many more\nESEs, addressing a long-standing mystery of the small-scale gas structure of\nthe Galaxy.\n", "  In $^{16}$O, we investigate the relation between the $E0$ monopole transition\nmatrix elements and cluster-shell competition using antisymmetrized quasi\ncluster model (AQCM), where the dissolution of $alpha$ clusters into quasi\nclusters due to the effect of the spin-orbit force is introduced. We focus on\nthe structure change when the strength of the spin-orbit force is varied. The\nground state dominantly has a compact four $alpha$ structure (doubly magic\nstructure of the $p$ shell), which is rather independent of the strength.\nHowever the first excited state ($0_2^+$) has $^{12}$C$+alpha$ cluster\nstructure and this state is largely affected by the increase of the strength;\nthe subclosure configuration of the $p_{3/2}$ shell for the $^{12}$C cluster\npart becomes more important than three $alpha$ configuration. The $E0$\ntransition from the ground state with compact four $alpha$ configuration to the\n$0^+_2$ state with $^{12}$C$+alpha$ cluster configuration is suppressed when\nincreasing the spin-orbit strength. Although the $E0$ operator itself does not\nhave the spin dependence, the matrix element is sensitive to the difference of\nintrinsic spin structures of the two states. The $E0$ transition characterizes\nthe persistence of four $alpha$ structure in the $0^+_2$ state.\n", "  Ab-initio density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) has been employed to\nstudy thermodynamical properties of pure and doped graphene sheet and the\nresults have been compared with available theoretical and experimental data.\nThe concentration of B and N has been varied upto 50% of the carbon atoms in\ngraphene. Phonon frequencies are essential ingredients entering into such a\ncalculation, which have been computed by using the dynamical matrix provided by\nVASP software in combination with phonopy code in the harmonic approximation.\nThis easily provides us the Helmholtz free energy and leads us to numerical\nestimates of various thermodynamical properties. The results for specific heat\nare in good agreement with various theoretical and experimental studies\nobtained earlier for pure graphene. Interesting new results have been reported\nfor B and N substituted structure. It has been observed that specific heat\ndecreases with the increase in concentration of doping while the entropy\nincreases. Further, large doping concentrations result in unstable sheets\nresulting in imaginary frequencies in the transverse directions. The\ninstability needs to be compensated by external strains and that has been\nassumed while carrying out Brilluoin summations. These results will be useful\nfor calculation of thermal conductivity of doped graphene and thus feasibility\nof using these for device applications. Our preliminary results for thermal\nexpansion have indicated negative thermal expansion behavior of pure graphene\nat low temperatures which needs investigation on doped graphene as well.\n", "  We explore the use in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) of trial wave functions\nconsisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by a truncated\nconfiguration-interaction (CI) expansion in Slater determinants obtained from a\nCI perturbatively selected iteratively (CIPSI) calculation. In the CIPSI\nalgorithm, the CI expansion is iteratively enlarged by selecting the best\ndeterminants using perturbation theory, which provides an optimal and automatic\nway of constructing truncated CI expansions approaching the full CI limit. We\nperform a systematic study of variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and fixed-node\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) total energies of first-row atoms from B to Ne with\ndifferent levels of optimization of the parameters (Jastrow parameters,\ncoefficients of the determinants, and orbital parameters) in these trial wave\nfunctions. The results show that the reoptimization of the coefficients of the\ndeterminants in VMC (together with the Jastrow factor) leads to an important\nlowering of both VMC and DMC total energies, and to their monotonic convergence\nwith the number of determinants. In addition, we show that the reoptimization\nof the orbitals is also important in both VMC and DMC for the Be atom when\nusing a large basis set. These reoptimized Jastrow-CIPSI wave functions appear\nas promising, systematically improvable trial wave functions for QMC\ncalculations.\n", "  The oxygen self-diffusion coefficient in UO${_2}$ has been recently studied\n[Cooper et al. Solid State Ionics 282 (2015) 26-30] over a range of pressures\n(0-10GPa) and temperatures (300-1900K) by combining molecular dynamics\ncalculations with a thermodynamical model, the cB{\\Omega} model. A significant\nreduction in oxygen self-diffusion as a function of increasing hydrostatic\npressure, and the associated increase in activation energy was identified.\nHere, we extend this study and find that the compressibility of the\ncorresponding activation volume exceeds significantly the compressibility of\nthe bulk material by almost one order of magnitude. This results is important\nsince in the literature it is usually assumed that these two compressibilities\nare equal. The same holds when comparing the thermal expansion coefficient of\nthis volume with that of the bulk solid.\n", "  Comparing the ranking of candidates by different voters is an important topic\nin social and information science with a high relevance from the point of view\nof practical applications. In general, ties and pairs of incomparable\ncandidates may occur, thus, the alternative rankings are described by partial\norders. Various distance measures between partial orders have already been\nintroduced, where zero distance is corresponding to a perfect match between a\npair of partial orders, and larger values signal greater differences. Here we\ntake a different approach and propose a similarity measure based on adjusted\nmutual information. In general, the similarity value of unity is corresponding\nto exactly matching partial orders, while a low similarity is associated to a\npair of independent partial orders. The time complexity of the computation of\nthis similarity measure is $\\mathcal{O}(\\left|{\\mathcal C}\\right|^3)$ in the\nworst case, and $\\mathcal{O}(\\left|{\\mathcal C}\\right|^2\\ln \\left|{\\mathcal\nC}\\right|)$ in the typical case of partial orders corresponding to trees with\nconstant branching number, where $\\left|{\\mathcal C}\\right|$ denotes the number\nof candidates. An interesting feature of our approach is that the similarity\nmeasure is sensitive to the position of the disagreements in the ranking:\nDifferences at the highly ranked candidates induce larger similarity drop\ncompared to disagreements at the bottom candidates.\n", "  The magnetization current that appears in the non-relativistic limit of the\nDirac equation is derived starting from the Pauli equation.\n", "  This is a survey of motivations, constructions and applications of higher\nprequantum geometry. In section 1 we highlight the open problem of\nprequantizing local field theory in a local and gauge invariant way, and we\nsurvey how a solution to this problem exists in higher differential geometry.\nIn section 2 we survey examples and problems of interest. In section 3 we\nsurvey the abstract cohesive homotopy theory that serves to make all this\nprecise and tractable.\n", "  Recent advances in large ring laser gyroscopes (RLG) technologies opened the\npossibility to observe rotations of the ground with sensitivities up to\n$10^{-11}$ $\\frac{rad}{s}$ over the frequency band of seismological interest\n(0.01-1Hz), thus opening the way to a new geophysical discipline, i.e.\nrotational seismology. A measure of rotations in seismology is of fundamental\ninterest for (a) the determination of all the six degrees of freedom that\ncharacterize a rigid body motion, and (b) the quantitative estimate of the\nrotational motions contaminating ground translation measurements obtained from\nstandard seismometers. Within this framework, this paper presents and describes\nGINGERino, a new large observatory-class RLG located in Gran Sasso underground\nlaboratory (LNGS), one national laboratories of the INFN (Istituto Nazionale di\nFisica Nucleare). We also report unprecedented observations and analyses of the\nroto-translational signals from a tele-seismic event observed in such a deep\nunderground environment.\n", "  The characteristic tip_substrate capacitance is crucial for understanding the\nlocalized electrical properties in atomic force microscopy (AFM). Since it is\nhighly dependent on tip geometrical features, estimation of the tip_substrate\ncharacteristic capacitance for a given probe is very complex, involving\nempirical measurements and numerical simulations. In this paper we propose a\nfacile approach to study the tip_substrate characteristic capacitance using AFM\nforce spectroscopy technique. In this scheme, an analytical expression is\nconsidered to model the tip_sample interaction, in which the coefficients are\ndirectly dependent on the tip_substrate capacitance. This method avoids any\ncomplex simulation involving irregular shape of AFM tips. Additionally, it\nconsiderably reduces amount of experimental data needed for the calculation\ncompared with other techniques. The work presented here also corroborates that\nfor tip_sample separation lower than 200 nm, the parallel plate_capacitor\napproximation is not very appropriate to describe the tip_substrate capacitive\ninteraction, but an intermediate approximation between a sphere_plane and a\ncone_plane geometry seems to be more appropriate.\n", "  Logic-qubit entanglement is a promising resource in quantum information\nprocessing, especially in future large-scale quantum networks. In the paper, we\nput forward an efficient entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for nonlocal\nmixed logic entangled states with the bit-flip error in the logic qubits of the\nlogic Bell state, resorting to the photon-atom interaction in low-quality (Q)\ncavity and atomic state measurement. Different from existing EPPs, this\nprotocol can also purify the logic phase-flip error, and the bit-flip error and\nthe phase-flip error in physic qubit. During the protocol, we only require to\nmeasure the atom states, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of\nphoton systems in future large-scale quantum networks.\n", "  Recently it has been demonstrated that the connectivity transition from\nmicroscopic connectivity to macroscopic connectedness, known as percolation, is\ngenerically announced by a cascade of microtransitions of the percolation order\nparameter [Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 155701 (2014)]. Here we report\nthe discovery of macrotransition cascades which follow percolation. The order\nparameter grows in discrete macroscopic steps with positions that can be\nrandomly distributed even in the thermodynamic limit. These transition\npositions are, however, correlated and follow scaling laws which arise from\ndiscrete scale invariance and non self-averaging, both traditionally unrelated\nto percolation. We reveal the discrete scale invariance in ensemble\nmeasurements of these non self-averaging systems by rescaling of the individual\nrealizations before averaging.\n", "  It has been recently proposed that quantum black holes can be described as\nN-graviton Bose-Einstein condensates. In this picture the quantum properties of\nBHs \"... can be understood in terms of the single number N\". However, so far,\nthe dynamical origin of the occupational number N has not been specified. This\ndescription is alternative to the usual one, where black holes are believed to\nbe well described geometrically even at the quantum level. In this paper we\npursue the former point of view and develop a non-geometrical dynamical model\nof quantum black holes (BHs). In our model the occupational number N is\nproportional to the principal quantum number n of a Planckian harmonic\noscillator. The so-called \"classicalization\" corresponds to the large-n limit,\nwhere the Schwarzschild horizon is recovered.\n", "  We present two ways of modeling the spectral energy distribution of blazars\nin the hadronic context and discuss the predictions of each \"hadronic variant\"\non the spectral shape, the multi-wavelength variability, the cosmic-ray flux,\nand the high-energy neutrino emission. Focusing on the latter, we then present\nan application of the hadronic model to individual BL Lacs that were recently\nsuggested to be the counterparts of some of the IceCube neutrinos, and conclude\nby discussing the contribution of the whole BL Lac class to the observed\nneutrino background.\n", "  Equiatomic TaNbHfZr and TaNbHfZrTi high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have been\ninvestigated for their phase stability, short-range clustering (SRC) type\nchemical ordering, other structural phenomena and and the effects on\nstrengthening. Ab-initio calculations have been done to determine the\nthermodynamic stability parameters. The as-cast structures do not contain any\nlocal chemical order, but the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy\n(HRTEM) studies reveal their locally distorted lattice. The local lattice\ndistortion of the average structure in their as-cast and annealed state is\nquantified by refining atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from\nsingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder neutron diffraction (ND)\nstudies. The static component of the ADPs appears to dominate over the thermal\nADP, suggesting a high degree of local lattice distortion in the HEAs. The\nlattice distortions cause solid-solution like strengthening, which increases\nthe hardness of the HEAs by a factor of 2-3 compared to the rule of mixture.\nThe SRCs that form in the annealed HEAs have a planar profile perpendicular to\nthe <1 0 0> directions. The SRCs mainly are co-clustering of Zr and Hf. The\nSRCs have a higher atomic volume causing local tetragonal lattice distortions,\nwhich in terms produce diffuse streak-like intensities in the XRD datasets and\nin the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM lattice images. The presence\nof SRCs locally reduces the lattice potential energy of the structure and puts\nadditional energy barrier to the movement of dislocations. This increases the\nhardness causing around 50% of additional strengthening in the annealed HEAs.\nThermodynamic analysis shows that the relaxed structure containing the SRCs\nlower the enthalpy and the configurational entropy.\n", "  Cobalt impurity located in the bulk copper is described making use of the\nmulti-orbital Anderson impurity model that is parametrized to match the\nelectronic structure from the local density approximation, and solved using the\nLanczos method. We concentrate on the many-body description of the ground state\nand excitation spectra. The calculations yield a nonmagnetic ground state for\nthe impurity atom. The computed spectral densities are in a good agreement with\nthose obtained using the quantum Monte Carlo method.\n", "  In February of 2014 the Yale Exoplanet Laboratory was commissioned to design,\nbuild, and deliver a high resolution (R = 60,000) spectrograph for the\n1.65-meter telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory. The observatory\nis operated by the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy at Vilnius\nUniversity. The Vilnius University Echelle Spectrograph (VUES) is a white-pupil\ndesign that is fed via an octagonal fiber from the telescope and has an\noperational bandpass from 400 to 880 nm. VUES incorporates a novel modular\noptomechanical design that allows for quick assembly and alignment on\ncommercial optical tables. This approach allowed the spectrograph to be\nassembled and commissioned at Yale using lab optical tables and then\nreassembled at the observatory on a different optical table with excellent\nrepeatability. The assembly and alignment process for the spectrograph was\nreduced to a few days, allowing the spectrograph to be completely disassembled\nfor shipment to Lithuania, and then installed at the observatory during a\n10-day period in June of 2015.\n", "  Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems.\nQuantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation\nto probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high\npredictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data\nscience. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general\nnonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights\ninto the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part\nof this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more\nefficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit\nlow-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional\nprobabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize\na useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that\nsparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce\na method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g.,\npersonality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part\nof the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe\nthat the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete\nwith state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore,\nwe make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical\norderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection\nbetween data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication\ncomplexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations)\nand physics (quantum models).\n", "  We present results from the first fully differential next-to-next-to leading\norder NNLO QCD computation of ZZ production, including off-shell effects, the\nleptonic decay and non-resonant contributions. We compare theoretical\npredictions to fiducial cross sections and distributions measured by ATLAS and\nCMS at 8 TeV and also perform a first comparison with early ATLAS measurements\nat 13 TeV.\n", "  By now it is known that in an s-wave\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor ($SFS$) structure the supercurrent\ninduced by spin singlet pairs can only transmit a short distance of the order\nof magnetic coherence length. The long-range supercurrent, taking place on the\nlength scale of the normal metal coherence length, will be maintained by\nequal-spin triplet pairs, which can be generated by magnetic inhomogeneities in\nthe system. In this paper, we show an unusual long-range supercurrent, which\ncan take place in clean $SF_1F_2S$ junction with non-parallel orientation of\nmagnetic moments. The mechanism behind the enhancement of Josephson current is\nprovided by the interference of the opposite-spin triplet states derived from\n$S/F_1$ and $F_2/S$ interfaces when both ferromagnetic layers have the same\nvalues of the length and exchange field. This finds can provide a natural\nexplanation for recent experiment [Robinson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,\n207001 (2010)].\n", "  Conventionally, unknown quantum states are characterized using quantum-state\ntomography based on strong or weak measurements carried out on an ensemble of\nidentically prepared systems. By contrast, the use of protective measurements\noffers the possibility of determining quantum states from a series of weak,\nlong measurements performed on a single system. Because the fidelity of a\nprotectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state\ndisturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the\ninitial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we\nshow how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a\nprotective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the\nquantum-state measurement. Our approach is based on a careful tuning of the\ntime dependence of the measurement interaction and is shown to be dramatically\nmore effective in reducing the state disturbance than the previously considered\nstrategy of weakening the measurement strength and increasing the measurement\ntime. We describe a method for designing the measurement interaction such that\nthe state disturbance exhibits polynomial decay to arbitrary order in the\ninverse measurement time $1/T$. We also show how one can achieve even faster,\nsubexponential decay, and we find that it represents the smallest possible\nstate disturbance in a protective measurement. In this way, our results show\nhow to optimally measure the state of a single quantum system using protective\nmeasurements.\n", "  In a delayed-choice quantum eraser, interference fringes are obtained by\nerasing which-way information after the interfering particle has already been\nirreversibly detected. Following an introductory review of delayed-choice\nexperiments and quantum erasure, we describe the experimental realization of an\noptical delayed-choice quantum eraser, suitable for advanced undergraduates,\nbased on polarization-entangled pairs of single photons. In our experiment, the\ndelay of the erasure is implemented using two different setups. The first setup\nemploys an arrangement of mirrors to increase the optical path length of the\nphotons carrying which-way information. In the second setup, we use fiber-optic\ncables to elongate the path of these photons after their passage through the\npolarization analyzer but prior to their arrival at the detector. We compare\nour results to data obtained in the absence of a delay and find excellent\nagreement. This shows that the timing of the erasure is irrelevant, as also\npredicted by quantum mechanics. The experiment can serve as a valuable\npedagogical tool for conveying the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Congestion limits the efficiency of transport networks ranging from highways\nto the internet. Fungal hyphal networks are studied as an examples of optimal\nbiological transport networks, but the scheduling and direction of traffic to\navoid congestion has not been examined. We show here that the Neurospora crassa\nfungal network exhibits anticongestion: more densely packed nuclei flow faster\nalong hyphal highways, and transported nuclei self-organize into fast flowing\nsolitons. Concentrated transport by solitons may allow cells to cycle between\ngrowing and acting as transport conduits.\n", "  We extend the Bell inequality known for two qubits to the four-level atom,\nincluding an artificial atom realized by the superconducting circuit, and qudit\nwith j=3/2. We formulate the extended inequality as the inequality valid for an\narbitrary Hermitian nonnegative 4x4-matrix with unit trace for both separable\nand entangled matrices.\n", "  A $^{13}$C NMR study of the normal and superconducting states of the\nall-organic charge-transfer salt\n$\\beta\"$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$SF$_5$CH$_2$CF$_2$SO$_3$ is presented. We find that the\nnormal state is a charge-ordered metal configured as vertical stripes, produced\nby a combination of 1/4-filling, correlations, and a polar counterion\nsublattice. The NMR properties associated with the superconducting state are\nconsistent with gap nodes and singlet pairing, and therefore similar to other\norganic superconductors. Quite distinct, however, is the absence of evidence\nfor low-energy antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for $T>T_c=4.5$ K. Both\naspects are discussed in the context of a proposal that the pairing in this\ncompound is driven by charge fluctuations.\n", "  Using the {\\it ab initio} anisotropic Eliashberg theory including Coulomb\ninteractions, we investigate the electron-phonon interaction and the pairing\nmechanism in the recently-reported superconducting Ca-intercalated bilayer\ngraphene. We find that C$_6$CaC$_6$ can support phonon-mediated\nsuperconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}=$6.8-8.1~K, in good\nagreement with experimental data. Our calculations indicate that the low-energy\nCa$_{xy}$ vibrations are critical to the pairing, and that it should be\npossible to resolve two distinct superconducting gaps on the electron and hole\nFermi surface pockets.\n", "  In this paper we carried out theoretical study of the general issues related\nto the efficiency of SiC:H/a-Si:H single- and multi-junction tandem solar\ncells. Implementation of numerical simulations by the use of AMPS-1D program of\none-dimensional analysis of microelectronic and photonic structures for the\nanalysis of hydrogenated silicon solar cells allowed us to formulate the\noptimal design of new kind of multi-junction tandem solar cells, providing its\nmost efficient operation. The numerical analysis of SiC:H/a-Si:H\nsingle-junction solar cell whith doped i-layer used as the intermediate\nabsorbing layer (a -Si: H) placed between layers of p-type (a-SiC: H) and\nn-type (a-Si: H) has been conducted. It has been established that after\noptimizing the solar cell parameters its highest efficiency of 19.62% is\nachieved at 500 nm thickness of i-layer. The optimization of the newly\ndeveloped multi-junction structure of a-SiC:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cell has been\nconducted. It has been shown numerically that its highest efficiency of 22.6%\nis achieved at the thickness of 270 nm of intermediate i-layer.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration broadband radio\ntransients, the emission mechanisms of which are not understood. Masui et al.\nrecently presented Green Bank Telescope observations of FRB 110523, which\ndisplayed temporal variation of the linear polarisation position angle (PA).\nThis effect is commonly seen in radio pulsars and is attributed to a changing\nprojected magnetic field orientation in the emission region as the star\nrotates. If a neutron star is the progenitor of this FRB, and the emission\nmechanism is pulsar-like, we show that the progenitor is either rapidly\nrotating, or the emission originates from a region of complex magnetic field\ngeometry. The observed PA variation could also be caused by propagation effects\nwithin a neutron-star magnetosphere, or by spatially varying magnetic fields if\nthe progenitor lies in a dense, highly magnetised environment. Although we urge\ncaution in generalising results from FRB 110523 to the broader FRB population,\nour analysis serves as a guide to interpreting future polarisation measurements\nof FRBs, and presents another means of elucidating the origins of these\nenigmatic ephemera.\n", "  We derive a new discretisation method for first order PDEs of arbitrary\nspatial dimension, which is based upon a meshfree spatial approximation. This\nspatial approximation is similar to the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics)\ntechnique and is a typical kernel-based method. It differs, however,\nsignificantly from the SPH method since it employs an Eulerian and not a\nLagrangian approach. We prove stability and convergence for the resulting\nsemi-discrete scheme under certain smoothness assumptions on the defining\nfunction of the PDE. The approximation order depends on the underlying kernel\nand the smoothness of the solution. Hence, we also review an easy way of\nconstructing smooth kernels yielding arbitrary convergence orders. Finally, we\ngive a numerical example by testing our method in the case of a one-dimensional\nBurgers equation.\n", "  Diabetes is one of the most debilitating and costly diseases currently\nplaguing humanity. It is a leading cause of death and dismemberment in the\nworld, and we know how to treat it. Accurate, continuous monitoring and control\nof blood glucose levels via insulin treatments are widely known to mitigate the\nmajority of detrimental effects caused by the disease. The primary limitation\nof continuous glucose monitoring is patient non-compliance due to the\nunpleasant nature of \"finger-stick\" testing methods. This limitation can be\nlargely, or even completely, removed by non-invasive testing methods. In this\nreport, we demonstrate the vibrational overtone circular dichroism properties\nof glucose and analyze its use as a method of non-invasive glucose monitoring,\ncapable of assuaging this trillion dollar scourge.\n", "  The current bottleneck of transient detection in most surveys is the problem\nof rejecting numerous artifacts from detected candidates. We present a\ntriple-stage hierarchical machine learning system for automated artifact\nfiltering in difference imaging, based on self-organizing maps. The classifier,\nwhen tested on the OGLE-IV Transient Detection System, accepts ~ 97 % of real\ntransients while removing up to ~ 97.5 % of artifacts.\n", "  With an explicit example, we show that Jordan frame and the conformally\ntransformed Einstein frames clearly lead to different physics for a\nnon-minimally coupled theory of gravity, namely Brans-Dicke theory, at least at\nthe quantum level. The example taken up is the spatially flat Friedmann\ncosmology in Brans-Dicke theory.\n", "  We use results on Virasoro conformal blocks to study chaotic dynamics in\nCFT$_2$ at large central charge c. The Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_L$, which is\na diagnostic for the early onset of chaos, receives $1/c$ corrections that may\nbe interpreted as $\\lambda_L = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\beta} \\left( 1 + \\frac{12}{c}\n\\right)$. However, out of time order correlators receive other equally\nimportant $1/c$ suppressed contributions that do not have such a simple\ninterpretation. We revisit the proof of a bound on $\\lambda_L$ that emerges at\nlarge $c$, focusing on CFT$_2$ and explaining why our results do not conflict\nwith the analysis leading to the bound. We also comment on relationships\nbetween chaos, scattering, causality, and bulk locality.\n", "  The hypothesis of the conserved vector current, relating the vector weak and\nisovector electromagnetic currents, plays a fundamental role in quantitative\ndescription of neutrino interactions. Despite being experimentally confirmed\nwith great precision, it is not fully implemented in existing calculations of\nthe cross section for inverse beta decay, the dominant mechanism of\nantineutrino scattering at energies below a few tens of MeV. In this article, I\nestimate the corresponding cross section and its uncertainty, ensuring\nconservation of the vector current. While converging to previous calculations\nat energies of several MeV, the obtained result is appreciably lower and\npredicts more directional positron production near the reaction threshold.\nThese findings suggest that in the current estimate of the flux of geologically\nproduced antineutrinos the 232Th and 238U components may be underestimated by\n6.1 and 3.7%, respectively. The proposed search for light sterile neutrinos\nusing a 144Ce--144Pr source is predicted to collect the total event rate lower\nby 3% than previously estimated and to observe a spectral distortion that could\nbe misinterpreted as an oscillation signal. In reactor-antineutrino\nexperiments, together with a re-evaluation of the positron spectra, the\npredicted event rate should be reduced by 0.9%, diminishing the size of the\nreported anomaly.\n", "  We demonstrate cooling of ultrathin fiber tapers coupled with nitrogen\nvacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds to cryogenic temperatures. Nanodiamonds\ncontaining multiple NV centers are deposited on the subwavelength\n480-nm-diameter nanofiber region of fiber tapers. The fiber tapers are\nsuccessfully cooled to 9 K using our home-built mounting holder and an\noptimized cooling speed. The fluorescence from the nanodiamond NV centers is\nefficiently channeled into a single guided mode and shows characteristic sharp\nzero-phonon lines of both neutral and negatively charged NV centers. The\npresent nanofiber/nanodiamond hybrid systems at cryogenic temperatures can be\nused as NV-based quantum information devices and for highly sensitive nanoscale\nmagnetometry in a cryogenic environment.\n", "  The Variational Theory of Complex Rays (VTCR) is an indirect Trefftz method\ndesigned to study systems governed by Helmholtz-like equations. It uses wave\nfunctions to represent the solution inside elements, which reduces the\ndispersion error compared to classical polynomial approaches but the resulting\nsystem is prone to be ill conditioned. This paper gives a simple and original\npresentation of the VTCR using the discontinuous Galerkin framework and it\ntraces back the ill-conditioning to the accumulation of eigenvalues near zero\nfor the formulation written in terms of wave amplitude. The core of this paper\npresents an efficient solving strategy that overcomes this issue. The key\nelement is the construction of a search subspace where the condition number is\ncontrolled at the cost of a limited decrease of attainable precision. An\naugmented LSQR solver is then proposed to solve efficiently and accurately the\ncomplete system. The approach is successfully applied to different examples.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional spin chain for arbitrary spin $s$ on a\nperiodic chain with $N$ sites, the generalization of the chain that was studied\nby Blume and Capel \\cite{bc}: $$H=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(a (S^z_i)^2+ b\nS^z_iS^z_{i+1}\\right).$$ The Hamiltonian only involves the $z$ component of the\nspin thus it is essentially an Ising \\cite{Ising} model. The Hamiltonian also\nfigures exactly as the anisotropic term in the famous model studied by Haldane\n\\cite{haldane} of the large spin Heisenberg spin chain \\cite{bethe}. Therefore\nwe call the model the Blume-Capel-Haldane-Ising model. Although the Hamiltonian\nis trivially diagonal, it is actually not always obvious which eigenstate is\nthe ground state. In this paper we establish which state is the ground state\nfor all regions of the parameter space and thus determine the phase diagram of\nthe model. We observe the existence of solitons-like excitations and we show\nthat the size of the solitons depends only on the ratio $a/b$ and not on the\nnumber of sites $N$. Therefore the size of the soliton is an intrinsic property\nof the soliton not determined by boundary conditions.\n", "  The transport properties of the perovskites KTaO$_3$ are calculated using\nfirst-principles methods. Our study is based on Boltzmann transport theory and\nthe relaxation time approximation, where the scattering rate is calculated\nusing an analytical model describing the interactions of electrons and\nlongitudinal optical phonons. We compute the room-temperature electron mobility\nand Seebeck coefficients of KTaO$_3$, and SrTiO$_3$ for comparison, for a range\nof electron concentrations. The comparison between the two materials provides\ninsight into the mechanisms that determine room-temperature electron mobility,\nsuch as the effect of band-width and spin-orbit splitting. The results,\ncombined with the efficiency of the computational scheme developed in this\nstudy, provide a path to investigate and discover materials with targeted\ntransport properties.\n", "  We report on the nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a HoFeO3 crystal induced\nby a strong terahertz magnetic field resonantly enhanced with a split ring\nresonator and measured with magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy. The\nterahertz magnetic field induces a large change (~40%) in the spontaneous\nmagnetization. The frequency of the antiferromagnetic resonance decreases in\nproportion to the square of the magnetization change. A modified\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a phenomenological nonlinear damping term\nquantitatively reproduced the nonlinear dynamics.\n", "  Zak phase labels the topological property of one-dimensional Bloch Bands.\nHere we propose a scheme and experimentally measure the Zak phase in a photonic\nsystem. The Zak phase of a bulk band of is related to the topological\nproperties of the two band gaps sandwiching this band, which in turn can be\ninferred from the existence or absence of an interface state. Using reflection\nspectrum measurement, we determined the existence of interface states in the\ngaps, and then obtained the Zak phases. The knowledge of Zak phases can also\nhelp us predict the existence of interface states between a metasurface and a\nphotonic crystal. By manipulating the property of the metasurface, we can\nfurther tune the excitation frequency and the polarization of the interface\nstate.\n", "  In limited-view computed tomography reconstruction, iterative image\nreconstruction with sparsity-exploiting methods, such as total variation (TV)\nminimization, inspired by compressive sensing, potentially claims large\nreductions in sampling requirements. However, a quantitative notion of this\nclaim is non-trivial because of the ill-defined reduction in sampling achieved\nby the sparsity-exploiting method. In this paper, exact reconstruction sampling\ncondition for limited-view problem is studied by verifying the uniqueness of\nsolution in TV minimization model. Uniqueness is tested by solving a convex\noptimization problem derived from the sufficient and necessary condition of\nsolution uniqueness. Through this method, the sufficient sampling number of\nexact reconstruction is quantified for any fixed phantom and settled\ngeometrical parameter in the limited-view problem. This paper provides a\nreference to quantify the sampling condition. Using Shepp-Logan phantom as an\nexample, the experiment results show the quantified sampling number and\nindicate that an object would be accurately reconstructed as the scanning range\nbecomes narrower by increasing sampling number. The increased samplings\ncompensate for the deficiency of the projection angle. However, a lower bound\nof the scanning range is presented, in which an exact reconstruction cannot be\nobtained once the projection angle is narrowed to this extent no matter how to\nincrease sampling.\n", "  Large scale magnetic fields seem to be present in almost all astrophysical\nsystems and scales from planets to superclusters of galaxies and in very low\ndensity intergalactic media. The upper limit of primordial magnetic fields\n(PMF) has been set by recent observations by the Planck observatory (2015) to\nbe of the order of a few nG. The simple model ${f^2}FF$ used to generate the\nPMF during the inflation era. It is based on the breaking of conformal symmetry\nof electromagnetism during inflation. It is attractive because it is stable\nunder perturbations and leads to a scale invariant PMF. However, it may suffer\nfrom two problems: Backreaction and strong coupling. In the first case, the\nelectromagnetic energy may exceed the energy of inflation, ${\\rho\n_{{\\rm{Inf}}}}$. In the second case, the effective electric charges become\nexcessively large if we want to retrieve the standard electromagnetism at the\nend of inflation. In this research, we investigate the generation of PMF under\nthree different models of inflation in order to avoid the backreaction problem.\nWe compute magnetic and electric spectra generated by the ${f^2}FF$ model in\nthe context of large field inflation (LFI), natural inflation (NI) and\n${R^2}$-inflation, for all possible values of model parameters for de Sitter\nand power law expansion of inflation. The results of the research show that the\nscale invariant PMF can be generated in these models and the problem of\nbackreaction may be avoided in some observational ranges. In $R^2$-inflation,\nwhich is preferred by the recent results of Planck 2015, we calculate the upper\nof the scale invariant PMF generated by ${f^2}FF$ and in turns we find that the\nupper limit of present magnetic field, ${B_0} < 8.058 \\times {10^{ -\n9}}{\\rm{G}}$. It is in the same order of magnitude of PMF, reported by Planck,\n2015.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBHs) are those which may have formed in the early\nUniverse and affected the subsequent evolution of the Universe through their\nHawking radiation and gravitational field. To constrain the early Universe from\nthe observational constraint on the abundance of PBHs, it is essential to\ndetermine the formation threshold for primordial cosmological fluctuations,\nwhich are naturally described by cosmological long-wavelength solutions. I will\nbriefly review our recent analytical and numerical results on the PBH\nformation.\n", "  Vanadium dioxide is currently considered as one of the most promising\nmetarials for oxide elcteronics. Both planar and sandwich thin-film MOM devices\nbased on VO2 exhibit electrical switching with an S-shaped I-V characteristic,\nand this switching effect is associated with the metal-insulator transition\n(MIT). In an electrical circuit containing such a switching device, relaxation\noscillations are observed if the load line intersects the I-V curve at a unique\npoint in NDR region. All these effects are potentially prospective for\ndesigning various devices of oxide electronics, particularly, elements of\ndynamical neural networks based on coupled oscillators.\n", "  It has been widely debated whether Arctic sea-ice loss can reach a tipping\npoint beyond which a large sea-ice area disappears abruptly. The theory of\ndynamical systems predicts a slowing down when a system destabilises towards a\ntipping point. In simple stochastic systems this can result in increasing\nvariance and autocorrelation, potentially yielding an early warning of an\nabrupt change. Here we aim to establish whether the loss of Arctic sea ice\nwould follow these conceptual predictions, and which trends in sea ice\nvariability can be expected from pre-industrial conditions toward an Arctic\nthat is ice-free during the whole year. To this end, we apply a model hierarchy\nconsisting of two box models and one comprehensive Earth system model. We find\na consistent and robust decrease of the ice volume's annual relaxation time\nbefore summer ice is lost because thinner ice can adjust more quickly to\nperturbations. Thereafter, the relaxation time increases, mainly because the\nsystem becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the\nice-free season becomes longer. Both trends carry over to the autocorrelation\nof sea ice thickness in time series. These changes are robust to the nature and\norigin of climate variability in the models and hardly depend on the balance of\nfeedbacks. Therefore, characteristic trends can be expected in the future. As\nthese trends are not specific to the existence of abrupt ice loss, the\nprospects for early warnings seem very limited. This result also has\nimplications for statistical indicators in other systems whose effective mass\nchanges over time, affecting the trend of their relaxation time. However, the\nrobust relation between state and variability would allow an estimate of\nsea-ice variability from only short observations. This could help one to\nestimate the likelihood and persistence of extreme events in the future.\n", "  We find a construction that expresses any tree-level $n$-particle ${\\rm\nN^{k-2}MHV}$ color-ordered partial amplitude in gauge theory as a linear\ncombination of a basis of dimension $\\eulerian{n-3}{k-2}$. Here\n$\\eulerian{p}{q}$ denotes the $(p,q)$ Eulerian number. The coefficients of the\nexpansion are independent of the helicities of the particles. This basis is a\nfour-dimensional refinement of the $(n-3)!$-element BCJ basis which is valid in\nany number of dimensions. The construction uses a new kind of objects which we\ncall {\\it scalar blocks}. Here we initiate the study of these objects. Scalar\nblocks provide an \"${\\rm N^{k-2}MHV}$ sector\" decomposition of a bi-adjoint\nscalar amplitude in four dimensions. As byproducts of the construction, we also\nfind an intrinsically four-dimensional version of KLT relations for gravity\namplitudes.\n", "  We propose a method for calculating the isothermal critical exponent $\\delta$\nin Ising systems undergoing a second-order phase transition. It is based on the\ncalculation of the mean magnetization time series within a small connected\ndomain of a lattice after equilibrium is reached. At the pseudocritical point,\nthe magnetization time series attains intermittent characteristics and the\nprobability density for consecutive values of mean magnetization within a\nregion around zero becomes a power law. Typically the size of this region is of\nthe order of the standard deviation of the magnetization. The emerging\npower-law exponent is directly related to the isothermal critical exponent\n$\\delta$ through a simple analytical expression. We employ this method to\ncalculate with remarkable accuracy the exponent $\\delta$ for the square-lattice\nIsing model where traditional approaches, like the constrained effective\npotential, typically fail to provide accurate results.\n", "  Community structure of networks provides comprehensive insight into their\norganizational structure and functional behavior. LPA is one of the most\ncommonly adopted community detection algorithms with nearly linear time\ncomplexity. But it suffers from poor stability and occurrence of monster\ncommunity due to the introduced randomize. We note that different\ncommunity-oriented node roles impact the label propagation in different ways.\nIn this paper, we propose a role-based label propagation algorithm (roLPA), in\nwhich the heuristics with regard to community-oriented node role were used. We\nhave evaluated the proposed algorithm on both real and artificial networks. The\nresult shows that roLPA is comparable to the state-of-the-art community\ndetection algorithms.\n", "  A new model of nonlinear electrodynamics with a dimensional parameter $\\beta$\ncoupled to gravity is considered. We show that an accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse takes place if the nonlinear electromagnetic field is the source of\nthe gravitational field. A pure magnetic universe is investigated and the\nmagnetic field drives the universe to accelerate. In this model, after the big\nbang, the universe undergoes inflation, and the accelerated expansion and then\ndecelerates approaching Minkowski spacetime asymptotically. We demonstrate the\ncausality of the model and a classical stability at the deceleration phase.\n", "  Real-time analysis and classification of observational data collected within\nsynoptic sky surveys is a huge challenge due to constant growth of data\nvolumes. Machine learning techniques are often applied in order to perform this\ntask automatically. The current bottleneck of transients detection in most\nsurveys is the process of filtering numerous artifacts from candidate\ndetection. We present a new method for automated artifact filtering based on\nhierarchical unsupervised classifier employing Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The\nsystem accepts 97 % of real transients and removes 97.5 % of artifacts when\ntested on the OGLE-IV Transient Detection System. The improvement of the\nartifacts filtering allowed for single-frame based rapid detections of\ntransients within OGLE-IV, which now alerts on transient discoveries in less\nthan 15 minutes from the image acquisition.\n", "  The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect is a promising tool for detecting the\npresence of hot gas out to the galaxy cluster peripheries. We developed a\nspectral imaging algorithm dedicated to the SZ observations of nearby galaxy\nclusters with Planck, with the aim of revealing gas density anisotropies\nrelated to the filamentary accretion of materials, or pressure discontinuities\ninduced by the propagation of shock fronts. To optimize an unavoidable\ntrade-off between angular resolution and precision of the SZ flux measurements,\nthe algorithm performs a multiscale analysis of the SZ maps as well as of other\nextended components, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies\nand the Galactic thermal dust. The demixing of the SZ signal is tackled through\nkernel weighted likelihood maximizations. The CMB anisotropies are further\nanalyzed through a wavelet analysis, while the Galactic foregrounds and SZ maps\nare analyzed via a curvelet analysis that best preserves their anisotropic\ndetails. The algorithm performance has been tested against mock observations of\ngalaxy clusters obtained by simulating the Planck High Frequency Instrument and\nby pointing a few characteristic positions in the sky. These tests suggest that\nPlanck should easily allow us to detect filaments in the cluster peripheries\nand detect large-scale shocks in colliding galaxy clusters that feature\nfavorable geometry.\n", "  An effective mass of charge carriers that is significantly larger that the\nmass of a free electron develops at low temperatures in certain lanthanide- and\nactinide-based metals, including those formed with plutonium, due to strong\nelectron-electron interactions. This heavy-fermion mass is reflected in a\nsubstantially enhanced electronic coefficient of specific heat $\\gamma$, which\nfor elemental Pu itself is much larger than that of normal metals. By our\ndefinition, there are twelve Pu-based heavy-fermion compounds, most discovered\nrecently, whose basic properties are known and discussed. Relative to other\nexamples, these Pu-based heavy-fermion systems are particularly complex due in\npart to the possible simultaneous presence of multiple, nearly degenerate\n5f$^n$ configurations. This complexity poses significant opportunities as well\nas challenges, including understanding the origin of unconventional\nsuperconductivity in some of these materials.\n", "  The Tolman~VII solution, an exact analytic solution to the spherically\nsymmetric, static Einstein equations with a perfect fluid source, has many\ncharacteristics that make it interesting for modelling high density physical\nastronomical objects. Here we supplement those characteristics with the\ngeometrical tensors that this solution possess, and find that the Weyl,\nRiemann, and Ricci tensor components show unexpected mathematical behaviour\nthat change depending on physically motivated parameters, even though the mass\nof the modelled objects is fixed. We show these features firstly through tensor\ncomponents, and then through the scalars in the null tetrad formalism of\nNewmann and Penrose. The salient conclusion of this analysis is the intimate\nrelationship between the Tolman~VII solution and the constant density\nSchwarzschild interior solution: the former being a straight forward\ngeneralization of the latter while eschewing the unphysical constant density.\n", "  Uncertainty relations describe the lower bound of product of standard\ndeviations of observables. By revealing a connection between standard\ndeviations of quantum observables and numerical radius of operators, we\nestablish a universal uncertainty relation for any $k$ observables, of which\nthe formulation depends on the even or odd quality of $k$. This universal\nuncertainty relation is tight at least for the cases $k=2n$ and $k=3$. For two\nobservables, the uncertainty relation is exactly a simpler reformulation of\nSchr\\\"odinger's uncertainty principle.\n", "  Graphene has been recognized as an attractive two-dimensional material for\nfundamental research and wide applications in electronic and photonic devices\nowing to its unique properties. The technologies to modulate the properties of\ngraphene are of continuous interest to researchers in multidisciplinary areas.\nHerein, we report on the first experimental observation of the layer-to-layer\ncompression and enhanced optical properties of few-layer graphene nanosheets by\napplying the irradiation of energetic ion beams. After the irradiation, the\nspace between the graphene layers was reduced, resulting in a tighter contact\nbetween the few-layer graphene nanosheet and the surface of the substrate. This\nprocessing also enhanced the interaction between the graphene nanosheets and\nthe evanescent-field wave near the surface, thus reinforcing the\npolarization-dependent light absorption of the graphene layers (with 3-fold\npolarization extinction ratio increment). Utilizing the ion-irradiated graphene\nnanosheets as saturable absorbers, the passively Q-switched waveguide lasing\nwith considerably improved performances was achieved, owing to the enhanced\ninteractions between the graphene nanosheets and evanescent field of light. The\nobtained repetition rate of waveguide laser was up to 2.3 MHz with a pulse\nduration of 101 ns.\n", "  We consider a problem of description of quantum correlations and dispersions\nof subsystems of complex open systems. Based on our previous results we\nproposed a method to evaluate pure quantum contributions from total statistical\ncharacteristics of two coupled oscillators interacting with thermal reservoirs.\nThe natural way to extract pure quantum characteristic of the system under\nstudy is a calculation of difference between the total value and its pure\nclassical part. A numerical study of temporal behavior of quantum variances and\ncovariances from given initial states up to states in the infinite time limit\nis given using the proposed method. It is shown that at comparatively high\ntemperatures the steady state total variances are almost classical, because\ntheir pure quantum parts tend to zero in this regime. Otherwise, at\ncomparatively low temperatures, the pure quantum parts of variances are not\nzeroing in steady states manifesting a finite contribution to total values. The\nsame is true for the covariance. The larger the temperature, the lower is the\nquantum contribution to the total covariance. As well as entanglement measures,\nquantum discord, the pure quantum contributions in the covariance matrix\nelements are important characteristics of the temporal dynamics of complex\nquantum systems.\n", "  Wound healing is an intricate process that involves many types of cells,\nreaction pathways as well as chemical, physical and electrical cues. Since\nbiochemical reactions and physiological events are pH-dependent we study here\npH as an important major characteristic of the wound healing process in the\npresence of endogenous and exogenous electric fields. Our model gives the\nspatial pH distribution in a wound. In particular we isolate a number of\ndimensionless quantities which sets the length, energy and time scales\ngoverning the wound healing process and which can be experimentally tested.\nMost interesting finding is that wound pH depends on actual wound size.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of shape changes and localized surface plasmons\nin small metal particles with the potential of a large enhancement of the Raman\nsignal from the particles own vibrations. The framework is a geometrical one\nwhere we study the change in geometric factors during the vibrational movement.\nThe resulting cross-section is found to be of a detectable order of magnitude\nhowever much smaller than the elastic cross-section.\n", "  The statistical analysis of gathered of astronomical objects (such as open\ncluster) are excellent tools to compute its parameters and to constrain the\ntheory of its evolution. Here, we are represented detailed structural and\nmembership analysis of an open cluster NGC 1960 through various statistical\nformulas and approaches. King empirical methods provide the information about\nthe cluster extent as 5.2 +/- 0.4 pc. The exact identification of members of\ncluster is needed to precise estimation of its age, reddening, metallicity\netc., therefore, to identify most probable members (MPMs), we adopted the\ncombined approach of various statistical methods (kinematic, photometric and\nstatistical) and 712 members are satisfied needed criteria of MPMs. The basic\nphysical parameters of the cluster such as E(B-V)=0.23+/-0.02 mag,\nE(V-K)=1.05+/-0.03mag, log(Age)=7.35+/-0.05, and (m-M)=11.35+/-0.10 mag are\nobtained using the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. NGC 1960 is found\nto be located at a distance of 1.34 +/- 0.03 kpc. Using the archival proper\nmotion catalogues, we estimate mean proper motions of NGC 1960 as 0.83+/-0.26\nmas yr-1 and -6.55+/-0.23 mas yr-1 in the direction of RA and DEC,\nrespectively.\n", "  We explore the possibility that the ionic electron polarizabilities of the\noxygen ions in the cuprates and the bismutates and the polarizabilities of As\nand Se ions in the iron pnictides contribute to charge carrier pairing leading\nto high Tc superconductivity. Using the fact that the ionic polarization\nresponse to a change in the electric field is practically instantaneous we\nfind, that the inter carrier electrostatic potential is attractive in a limited\ndistance range. This potential is used to calculate quantum mechanically the\ncooper-like pairing energy and wavefunction and the gap energy showing they are\nconsistent with pairing and gap energies of high Tc superconductors.\nQualitative considerations suggest that this model may explain a number of\nimportant features of high Tc superconductors.\n", "  Based on the solution of Atanasiu et al. (2004), a theoretical model for\naxisymmetric vortex flows is derived in the present study by solving the\nvorticity transport equation for an inviscid, incompressible fluid in\ncylindrical coordinates. The model can describe a variety of axisymmetric flows\nwith particular boundary conditions at a moderately high Reynolds number. This\npaper shows one example: a high Reynolds number laminar vortex ring. The model\ncan represent a family of vortex rings by specifying the modulus function using\na Rayleigh distribution function. The characteristics of this vortex ring\nfamily are illustrated by numerical methods. For verification, the model\nresults compare well with the recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) in\nterms of the vorticity distribution and streamline patterns, cross-sectional\nareas of the vortex core and bubble, and radial vorticity distribution through\nthe vortex center. Most importantly, the asymmetry and elliptical outline of\nthe vorticity profile are well captured.\n", "  Let p_N be a random degree N polynomial in one complex variable whose zeros\nare chosen independently from a fixed probability measure mu on the Riemann\nsphere S^2. This article proves that if we condition p_N to have a zero at some\nfixed point xi in , then, with high probability, there will be a critical point\nw_xi a distance 1/N away from xi. This 1/N distance is much smaller than the\none over root N typical spacing between nearest neighbors for N i.i.d. points\non S^2. Moreover, with the same high probability, the argument of w_xi relative\nto xi is a deterministic function of mu plus fluctuations on the order of 1/N.\n", "  Quantum particle simulations have largely been based on time-independent,\nsplit-operator schemes in which kinetic and potential operators are interwoven\nto provide accurate approximations to system dynamics. These simulations can be\nvery expensive in terms of the number of gates required, although individual\ncases, such as tunneling, have been found where prethreshold simulations are\npossible. By prethreshold, we mean a quantum computation or simulation with an\nexisting architecture and not requiring error correction. In the case of\nmolecular collisions, switching to a time-dependent formulation can reduce the\nsystem dimensionality significantly and provide an opportunity for\npre-threshold simulation. Here, we study the efficiency of gate-based quantum\nsimulation of a set of molecular collisions of increasing complexity. We show\nthat prethreshold quantum simulation of such systems is feasible up to Hilbert\nspace dimension 8, but beyond that error correction would be required.\n", "  Laser driven particle acceleration has shown remarkable progresses in\ngenerating multi-GeV electron bunches and 10s of MeV ion beams based on\nhigh-power laser facilities. Intense laser pulse offers the acceleration field\nof 1012 Volt per meter, several orders of magnitude larger than that in\nconventional accelerators, enabling compact devices. Here we report that a\nhighly-collimated argon ion beam with narrow energy spread is produced by\nirradiating a 45-fs fully-relativistic laser pulse onto an argon cluster\ntarget. The highly-charged (Argon ion with charge state of 16+) heavy ion beam\nhas a minimum absolute energy spread of 0.19 MeV per nucleon at the energy peak\nof 0.39 MeV per nucleon. we identify a novel scheme from particle-in-cell\nsimulations that greatly reduces the beam energy spread. The laser-driven\nintense plasma wakefield has a strong modulation on the ion beam in a way that\nthe low energy part is cut off. The pre-accelerated argon ion beam from Coulomb\nexplosion thus becomes more mono-energetic and collimated.\n", "  This work presents a complete analysis of fermion fitting and proton decay in\na SUSY $SO(10)$ model previously suggested by Dutta, Mimura, and Mohapatra.\n  A key question in any grand unified theory is whether it satisfies the\nexperimental lower limits on proton partial lifetimes. In generic models,\nsubstantial fine-tuning is required among GUT-scale parameters to satisfy the\nlimits. In the proposed model, the ${\\bf 10}$, $\\overline{\\bf{126}}$, and ${\\bf\n120}$ Yukawa couplings contributing to fermion masses have restricted textures\nintended to give favorable results for proton lifetime, while still giving rise\nto a realistic fermion sector, without the need for fine-tuning, even for large\n$\\tan\\beta$, and for either type-I or type-II dominance in the neutrino mass\nmatrix.\n  In this thesis, I investigate the above hypothesis at a strict numerical\nlevel of scrutiny; I obtain a valid fit for the entire fermion sector for both\ntypes of seesaw dominance, including $\\theta_{13}$ in good agreement with the\nmost recent data. For the case with type-II seesaw, I find that, using the\nYukawa couplings fixed by the successful fermion sector fit, proton partial\nlifetime limits are readily satisfied for all but one of the pertinent decay\nmodes for nearly arbitrary values of the triplet-Higgs mixing parameters, with\nthe $K^+ \\bar\\nu$ mode requiring a ${\\cal O}(10^{-1})$ cancellation in order to\nsatisfy its limit. I also find a maximum partial lifetime for that mode of\n$\\tau(K^+ \\bar\\nu) \\sim 10^{36}\\,$years. For the type-I seesaw case, I find\nthat $K^+ \\bar\\nu$ decay mode is satisfied for any values of the triplet mixing\nparameters giving no major enhancement, and all other modes are easily\nsatisfied for arbitrary mixing values; I also find a maximum partial lifetime\nfor $K^+ \\bar\\nu$ of nearly $10^{38}\\,$years, which is sub-dominant to gauge\nboson decay channels.\n", "  Local drug delivery has received much recognition in recent years, yet it is\nstill unpredictable how drug efficacy depends on physicochemical properties and\ndelivery kinetics. The purpose of the current study is to provide a useful\nmathematical model for drug release from a drug delivery device and consecutive\ndrug transport in biological tissue, thereby aiding the development of new\ntherapeutic drug by a systemic approach. In order to study the complete\nprocess, a two-layer spatio-temporal model depicting drug transport between the\ncoupled media is presented. Drug release is described by considering\nsolubilisation dynamics of drug particle, diffusion of the solubilised drug\nthrough porous matrix and also some other processes like reversible\ndissociation / recrystallization, drug particle-receptor binding and\ninternalization phenomena. The model has led to a system of partial\ndifferential equations describing the important properties of drug kinetics.\nThis model contributes towards the perception of the roles played by diffusion,\nmass-transfer, particle binding and internalization parameters.\n", "  A numerical model for tsunami simulations Cliffs is exercised with the\ncomplete set of NTHMP-selected benchmark problems focused on inundation, such\nas simulating runup of a non-breaking solitary wave onto a sloping beach, runup\non a conical island, a lab experiment with a scaled model of Monai Valley, and\nthe 1993 Hokkiado tsunami and inundation of the Okushiri Island.\n", "  The region of permanent densification beneath a Berkovich indentation imprint\nin silica glass is investigated using a novel chemical dissolution technique.\nThe use of the similitude regime in sharp indentation testing allows one to\nrecord reliable data with a good spatial resolution that makes it possible to\ndeal with low loads (typically below 10 mN) and crack-free imprints. The\ndensified zone dissolves much quicker than the non densified regions. The\nanalysis of the results, along the vertical axis, indicates that the\ndensification zone is rather homogeneous with a steep transition to the non\ndensified zone. The size of the densification zone, with respect to the initial\nfree surface, is estimated to be around 1.9 the maximum penetration depth of\nthe instrumented indentation test. These findings are compared with former\nexperimental data and critically compared with the results of numerical\nsimulations from selected constitutive equations and other numerical techniques\nfrom the literature. These comparisons highlight some advantages and\ndisadvantages of existing modelings and thus call for further advanced progress\non that matter. They nevertheless favor mostly the contribution of the\ndensification process with respect to the plastic flow (volume conservative\nprocess) in creating a permanent imprint.\n", "  The role of zero mode quantum corrections to the energy of baryonic systems\nwith exotic quantum numbers (strangeness) is discussed. A simple expression for\nthe contribution depending on strange inertia is obtained in the\n$SU(3)-$collective coordinate quantization approach, and it is shown that this\ncorrection stabilizes the systems the stronger the greater their baryon number\nis. Furthemore, systems are considered which could be interpreted in the quark\nmodel language as containing additional $q\\bar q-$pairs. It is argued that a\nstrange skyrmion crystal should have additional binding in comparison with the\n$SU(2)-$quantized neutron crystal.\n", "  Using the semiclassical neutral atom theory, we extend to fourth order the\nmodified gradient expansion of the exchange energy of density functional\ntheory. This expansion can be applied both to large atoms and solid-state\nproblems. Moreover, we show that it can be employed to construct a simple and\nnon-empirical generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation\nfunctional competitive with state-of-the-art GGAs for solids, but also\nreasonably accurate for large atoms and ordinary chemistry.\n", "  We report simulation of nanostructured memristor device using piecewise\nlinear and nonlinear window functions for RRAM and neuromorphic applications.\nThe linear drift model of memristor has been exploited for the simulation\npurpose with the linear and non-linear window function as the mathematical and\nscripting basis. The results evidences that the piecewise linear window\nfunction can aptly simulate the memristor characteristics pertaining to RRAM\napplication. However, the nonlinear window function could exhibit the nonlinear\nphenomenon in simulation only at the lower magnitude of control parameter. This\nhas motivated us to propose a new nonlinear window function for emulating the\nsimulation model of the memristor. Interestingly, the proposed window function\nis scalable up to f(x)=1 and exhibits the nonlinear behavior at higher\nmagnitude of control parameter. Moreover, the simulation results of proposed\nnonlinear window function are encouraging and reveals the smooth nonlinear\nchange from LRS to HRS and vice versa and therefore useful for the neuromorphic\napplications.\n", "  Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film\nbetween the heater and the liquid when the heat supply exceeds a critical\nvalue. We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the\nspreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by\nthe vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the\nbubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple\ncontact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of\nthe apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete\nwetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be\nunderstood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state\nof nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a\nvery large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because\nthe superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the\ndeparting vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of\nthe heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the\nheater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor\nbubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the\nlatter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface\ngrows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This\nphenomenon is known under the names of \"boiling crisis,\" \"burnout,\" or\n\"Departure from Nucleate Boiling\" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition\nis called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the\n1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers\nwith large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge\namount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling\n(boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the\nflowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each\ndescribing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid\nand of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and\nparticular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on\nthe details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating\nthe consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of\nfrequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes\nobservations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are\npresented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing\ninterest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and\nnumerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In\nthis Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition.\n", "  `Ether-drift' experiments have played a crucial role for the origin of\nrelativity. Though, a recent re-analysis shows that those original measurements\nwhere light was still propagating in gaseous systems, differently from the\nmodern experiments in vacuum and in solid dielectrics, indicate a small\nuniversal anisotropy which is naturally interpreted in terms of a non-local\nthermal gradient. We argue that this could possibly be the effect, on weakly\nbound gaseous matter, of the temperature gradient due to the Earth's motion\nwithin the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR). Therefore, a check with modern\nlaser interferometers is needed to reproduce the conditions of those early\nmeasurements with today's much greater accuracy. We emphasize that an\nunambiguous confirmation of our interpretation would have far reaching\nconsequences. For instance, it would also imply that all physical systems on\nthe moving Earth are exposed to a tiny energy flow, an effect that, in\nprinciple, could induce forms of self-organization in matter.\n", "  Community and cluster detection is a popular field of social network\nanalysis. Most algorithms focus on static graphs or series of snapshots.\n  In this paper we present an algorithm, which detects communities in dynamic\ngraphs. The method is based on shortest paths to high-connected nodes, so\ncalled hubs. Due to local message passing we can update the clustering results\nwith low computational power.\n  The presented algorithm is compared with other for some static social\nnetworks. The reached modularity is not as high as the Louvain method, but even\nhigher then spectral clustering. For large-scale real-world datasets with given\nground truth, we could reconstruct most of the given community structure. The\nadvantage of the algorithm is the good performance in dynamic scenarios.\n", "  Key physical ingredients governing the evolution of massive stars are mass\nlosses, convection and mixing in radiative zones. These effects are important\nboth in the frame of single and close binary evolution. The present paper\naddresses two points: 1) the differences between two families of rotating\nmodels, i.e. the family of models computed with and without an efficient\ntransport of angular momentum in radiative zones; 2) The impact of the mass\nlosses in single and in close binary models.\n", "  We present an extension of the Arnold-Moore-Yaffe kinetic equations for jet\nenergy loss to NLO in the strong coupling constant. A novel aspect of the NLO\nanalysis is a consistent description of wider-angle bremsstrahlung\n(semi-collinear emissions), which smoothly interpolates between 2<->2\nscattering and collinear bremsstrahlung. We describe how many of the\ningredients of the NLO transport equations (such as the drag coefficient) can\nbe expressed in terms of Wilson line operators and can be computed using a\nEuclidean formalism or sum rules, both motivated by the analytic properties of\namplitudes at light-like separations. We conclude with an outlook on the\ncomputation of the shear viscosity at NLO.\n", "  The thermal gradient along indium-arsenide nanowires was engineered by a\ncombination of fabricated micro- trenches in the supporting substrate and\nfocused laser irradiation. This allowed local control of thermally activated\noxidation reactions of the nanowire on the scale of the diffraction limit. The\nlocality of the oxidation was detected by micro-Raman mapping, and the results\nwere found consistent with numerical simulations of the temperature profile.\nApplying the technique to nanowires in electrical devices the locally oxidized\nnanowires remained conducting with a lower conductance as expected for an\neffectively thinner conducting core.\n", "  Salt crystallization is a major cause of weathering of artworks, monuments\nand rocks. Damage will occur if crystals continue to grow in confinement, i.e.\nwithin the pore space of these materials generating mechanical stresses. We\nreport on a novel method that allows to directly measure, at the microscale,\nthe resulting pressure while visualizing the spontaneous nucleation and growth\nof alkali halide salts. The experiments reveal the crucial role of the wetting\nfilms between the growing crystal and the confining walls for the development\nof the pressure. The results suggest that the pressure originates from a charge\nrepulsion between the similarly charged wall and the crystal separated by a\n~1.5 nm salt solution film. Consequently, if the walls are made hydrophobic, no\nfilm and no crystallization pressure are detected. The magnitude of the\npressure is system-specific and explains how a growing crystal exerts stresses\nat the scale of individual grains in porous materials.\n", "  Hydrodynamic models of RR Lyrae pulsation display a very rich behaviour.\nContrary to earlier expectations, high order resonances play a crucial role in\nthe nonlinear dynamics representing the interacting modes. Chaotic attractors\ncan be found at different time scales: both in the pulsation itself and in the\namplitude equations shaping the possible modulation of the oscillations.\nAlthough there is no one-to-one connection between the nonlinear features found\nin the numerical models and the observed behaviour, the richness of the found\nphenomena suggests that the interaction of modes should be taken seriously in\nthe study of the still unsolved puzzle of Blazhko effect. One of the main\nlessons of this complex system is that we should rethink the simple\ninterpretation of the observed effect of resonances.\n", "  Methane autothermal reforming has been studied using comprehensive, detailed\nmicrokinetic mechanisms, and a hierarchically reduced rate expression has been\nderived without apriori assumptions. The microkinetic mechanism is adapted from\nliterature and has been validated with reported experimental results. Rate\nDetermining Steps are elicited by reaction path analysis, partial equilibrium\nanalysis and sensitivity analysis. Results show that methane activation occurs\nvia dissociative adsorption to pyrolysis, while oxidation of the carbon occurs\nby O(s). Further, the mechanism is reduced through information obtained from\nthe reaction path analysis, which is further substantiated by principal\ncomponent analysis. A 33% reduction from the full microkinetic mechanism is\nobtained. One-step rate equation is further derived from the reduced\nmicrokinetic mechanism. The results show that the this rate equation accurately\npredicts conversions as well as outlet mole fraction for a wide range of inlet\ncompositions.\n", "  The Smagorinsky model, unmodified, is often reported to severely overdiffuse\nflows. Previous estimates of the energy dissipation rate of the Smagorinsky\nmodel for shear flows reflect a blow up of model energy dissipation as Re\nincreases. This blow up is consistent with the numerical evidence and leads to\nthe question: Is the over dissipation due to the influence of the turbulent\nviscosity in boundary layers alone or is its action on small scales generated\nby the nonlinearity through the cascade also a contributor? This report\ndevelops model dissipation estimates for body force driven flow under periodic\nboundary conditions (and thus only with nonlinearity generated small scales).\nIt is proven that the model's time averaged energy dissipation rate satisfies\nthe same upper bound as for the NSE plus one additional term that vanishes\nuniformly in the Reynolds number as the Smagorinsky length scale decreases.\nSince this estimate is consistent with that observed for the NSE, it\nestablishes that, without boundary layers, the Smagorinsky model does not over\ndissipate.\n", "  The physics case for electron-positron beams at the Future Circular Collider\n(FCC-ee) is succinctly summarized. The FCC-ee core program involves $e^+e^-$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 90, 160, 240, and 350 GeV with multi-ab$^{-1}$\nintegrated luminosities, yielding about 10$^{12}$ Z bosons, 10$^{8}$ W$^+$W$^-$\npairs, 10$^{6}$ Higgs bosons and 4$\\cdot$10$^{5}$ $t\\bar{t}$ pairs per year.\nThe huge luminosities combined with $\\cal{100}$ keV knowledge of the c.m.\nenergy will allow for Standard Model studies at unrivaled precision. Indirect\nconstraints on new physics can thereby be placed up to scales $\\Lambda_{_{\\rm\nNP}} \\approx$ 7 and 100 TeV for particles coupling respectively to the Higgs\nand electroweak bosons.\n", "  Wetting flows are controlled by the contact line motion. We derive an\nequation that describes the slow time evolution of the triple\nsolid-liquid-fluid contact line for an arbitrary distribution of defects on a\nsolid surface. The capillary rise along a partially wetted infinite vertical\nwall is considered. The contact line is assumed to be only slightly deformed by\nthe defects. The derived equation is solved exactly for a simple example of a\nsingle defect. Introduction.\n", "  This study investigates the heat transfer in a simple pure fluid whose\ntemperature is slightly above its critical temperature. We propose a efficient\nnumerical method to predict the heat transfer in such fluids when the gravity\ncan be neglected. The method, based on a simplified thermodynamic approach, is\ncompared with direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes and energy\nequations performed for CO2 and SF6. A realistic equation of state is used to\ndescribe both fluids. The proposed method agrees with the full hydrodynamic\nsolution and provides a huge gain in computation time. The connection between\nthe purely thermodynamic and hydrodynamic descriptions is also discussed.\n", "  A key to building functional devices on the basis of single molecule magnets\nin the framework of molecular electronics is the ability to deposit and study\nthese molecules on a surface, because the structural, electronic and magnetic\nproperties of molecules can significantly change upon adsorption. We have used\nthe submolecular resolution of a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the\nlocal interactions within two different rationally designed\nsingle-molecule-magnet building blocks. A careful analysis of single-molecule\nspectroscopic maps reveals that the electronic properties are sensitively\ndependent on the molecular structure so that even small changes can drastically\nenhance or reduce the intramolecular spin coupling. Due to their planar\ngeometry, these molecules are ideal model systems to study molecular magnetism\nof surface-supported complexes via scanning probe techniques.\n", "  In this note we continue our investigations of the representation theoretic\naspects of reflection positivity, also called Osterwalder--Schrader positivity.\nWe explain how this concept relates to affine isometric actions on real Hilbert\nspaces and how this is connected with Gaussian processes with stationary\nincrements.\n", "  The Karsten-Wilczek action describes two chiral fermions but breaks the\nsymmetries under both charge conjugation ($ \\widehat{C}) $ and time reflection\n($ \\widehat{\\Theta} $) explicitly, though invariance under $ \\widehat{C\\Theta}\n$ and a mirror fermion symmetry $ \\widehat{T\\Theta} $ are maintained. These\nproceedings outline how the action's symmetries and the presence of the second\nfermion emerge in mesonic correlation functions.\n  The residual symmetries explain the non-observation of broken time-reflection\nsymmetry in a class of mesonic correlation functions. Time-reflection symmetry\nis enforced for correlation functions that are manifestly invariant under $\n\\widehat{C} $ or $ \\widehat{T} $. Due to contributions from the second fermion,\noscillating contributions arise in some mesonic correlation functions. A second\ncondition for non-perturbative tuning of the relevant counterterm is obtained\nfrom these oscillations. Both non-perturbative tuning conditions are\nindependent and agree within errors. Due to contributions from the second\nfermion, additional pseudoscalar states are observed in non-standard channels.\nMass splittings between these additional states and the Goldstone boson vanish\nas $ \\mathcal{O}(a^2) $.\n", "  In this paper, we tackle the problem of measuring similarity among graphs\nthat represent real objects with noisy data. To account for noise, we relax the\ndefinition of similarity using the maximum weighted co-$k$-plex relaxation\nmethod, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level.\nWe then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization problem that can be solved by a quantum annealer. The context of\nour study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to\nregular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure\nand use it to predict the mutagenicity of a molecule. Our results indicate that\nthe relaxed similarity measure, designed to accommodate the regular errors,\nyields a higher prediction accuracy than the measure that ignores the noise.\n", "  Rippling patterns of myxobacteria appear in starving colonies before they\naggregate to form fruiting bodies. These periodic traveling cell density waves\narise from the coordination of individual cell reversals, resulting from an\ninternal clock regulating them, and from contact signaling during bacterial\ncollisions. Here we revisit a mathematical model of rippling in myxobacteria\ndue to Igoshin et al.\\ [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA {\\bf 98}, 14913 (2001) and\nPhys. Rev. E {\\bf 70}, 041911 (2004)]. Bacteria in this model are phase\noscillators with an extra internal phase through which they are coupled to a\nmean-field of oppositely moving bacteria. Previously, patterns for this model\nwere obtained only by numerical methods and it was not possible to find their\nwavenumber analytically. We derive an evolution equation for the reversal point\ndensity that selects the pattern wavenumber in the weak signaling limit, show\nthe validity of the selection rule by solving numerically the model equations\nand describe other stable patterns in the strong signaling limit. The nonlocal\nmean-field coupling tends to decohere and confine patterns. Under appropriate\ncircumstances, it can annihilate the patterns leaving a constant density state\nvia a nonequilibrium phase transition reminiscent of destruction of\nsynchronization in the Kuramoto model.\n", "  We analyze numerically the behaviour of the solutions corresponding to an\nAbelian cosmic string taking into account an extension of the Starobinsky\nmodel, where the action of general relativity is replaced by $f(R) = R -\n2\\Lambda + \\eta R^2 + \\rho R^m$, with $m > 2$. As an interesting result, we\nfind that the angular deficit which characterizes the cosmic string decreases\nas the parameters $\\eta$ and $\\rho$ increase. We also find that the cosmic\nhorizon due to the presence of a cosmological constant is affected in such a\nway that it can grows or shrinks, depending on the vacuum expectation value of\nthe scalar field and on the value of the cosmological constant\n", "  Given a graph with node attributes, what neighborhoods are anomalous? To\nanswer this question, one needs a quality score that utilizes both structure\nand attributes. Popular existing measures either quantify the structure only\nand ignore the attributes (e.g., conductance), or only consider the\nconnectedness of the nodes inside the neighborhood and ignore the cross-edges\nat the boundary (e.g., density).\n  In this work we propose normality, a new quality measure for attributed\nneighborhoods. Normality utilizes structure and attributes together to quantify\nboth internal consistency and external separability. It exhibits two key\nadvantages over other measures: (1) It allows many boundary-edges as long as\nthey can be \"exonerated\"; i.e., either (i) are expected under a null model,\nand/or (ii) the boundary nodes do not exhibit the subset of attributes shared\nby the neighborhood members. Existing measures, in contrast, penalize boundary\nedges irrespectively. (2) Normality can be efficiently maximized to\nautomatically infer the shared attribute subspace (and respective weights) that\ncharacterize a neighborhood. This efficient optimization allows us to process\ngraphs with millions of attributes.\n  We capitalize on our measure to present a novel approach for Anomaly Mining\nof Entity Neighborhoods (AMEN). Experiments on real-world attributed graphs\nillustrate the effectiveness of our measure at anomaly detection, outperforming\npopular approaches including conductance, density, OddBall, and SODA. In\naddition to anomaly detection, our qualitative analysis demonstrates the\nutility of normality as a powerful tool to contrast the correlation between\nstructure and attributes across different graphs.\n", "  We investigate a Higgs portal dark matter model by extending the Standard\nmodel (SM) with a complex singlet, $S=(s+ia )/\\sqrt{2}$, where $a $ is a dark\nmatter candidate and $S$ gets no vacuum expectation value but $s$ mixies with\nthe SM Higgs via a trilinear interaction. We point out an interesting scenario,\nwhere only quartic coupling contributes to the dark matter relic abundance and\nthere is no tree level contribution to the direct detection. Numerical analysis\nshows that the direction detection cross section, which arises at the one-loop\nlevel, is about $2\\sim 5$ orders below the current LUX bound. Constraints from\nHiggs measurements as well as collider signatures of the model at the LHC are\nstudied.\n", "  Warm absorber (WA) is an ionised gas present in the line of sight to the AGN\ncentral engine. The effect of the absorber is imprinted in the absorption lines\nobserved in X-ray spectra of AGN. In this work, we model the WA in Seyfert 1\ngalaxy Mrk 509 using its recently published shape of broad band spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) as a continuum illuminating the absorber. Using the\nphotoionization code {\\sc Titan}, recently we have shown that the absorption\nmeasure distribution (AMD) found for this object can be successfully modelled\nas a single slab of gas in total pressure (radiation+gas) equilibrium, contrary\nto the usual models of constant density multiple slabs. We discuss the\ntransmitted spectrum that would be recorded by an observer after the radiation\nfrom the nucleus passes through the WA.\n", "  We explore the resiliency and robustness of systems while viewing them as\ncomplex, multi-genre networks. The term \"complex, multi-genre networks\" refers\nto networks that combine several distinct genres - networks of physical\nresources, communication networks, information networks, and social and\ncognitive networks. We show that this perspective is fruitful and adds to our\nunderstanding of fundamental challenges and tradeoffs in robustness and\nresiliency, as well as potential solutions to the challenges. Study of systems\nas multi-genre networks is relatively uncommon; instead, it is customary in\nresearch and engineering literature to focus on a view of a network comprised\nof homogeneous elements, (e.g., a network of communication devices, or a\nnetwork of social beings). Yet, most if not all real-world networks are\nmulti-genre - it is hard to find any real system of a significant complexity\nthat does not include a combination of interconnected physical elements,\ncommunication devices and channels, data collections, and human users forming\nan integrated, inter-dependent whole. Most approaches to improving resiliency\nand robustness involve compromises, and the key challenge is to find a\nfavorable compromise. Such compromises involve reducing or managing the\ncomplexity of the network: coupling, rigidity and dependency. We discuss\nseveral of these compromises, e.g., performance vs resiliency; resiliency to\none type of disruption vs resiliency to another disruption type; and complexity\nvs resiliency.\n", "  We analyze a general family of position-dependent mass quantum Hamiltonians\nwhich are not self-adjoint and include, as particular cases, some Hamiltonians\nobtained in phenomenological approaches to condensed matter physics. We build a\ngeneral family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians which are quantum mechanically\nequivalent to the non self-adjoint proposed ones. Inspired in the probability\ndensity of the problem, we construct an ansatz for the solutions of the family\nof self-adjoint Hamiltonians. We use this ansatz to map the solutions of the\ntime independent Schrodinger equations generated by the non self-adjoint\nHamiltonians into the Hilbert space of the solutions of the respective dual\nself-adjoint Hamiltonians. This mapping depends on both the position-dependent\nmass and on a function of position satisfying a condition that assures the\nexistence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint\nHamiltonians here studied to a very general family of Hamiltonians proposed in\na seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in\ndifferent types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint Hamiltonians that\ncorrespond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article. We analyze\nthree typical cases by choosing a physical position-dependent mass and a\ndeformed harmonic oscillator potential . We completely solve the Schrodinger\nequations for the three cases; we also find and compare their respective energy\nlevels.\n", "  Data on HII regions, molecular clouds, and methanol masers have been used to\nestimate the Sun's distance from the symmetry plane zo and the vertical disk\nscale height h. Kinematic distance estimates are available for all objects in\nthese samples. The Local-arm (Orion-arm) objects are shown to affect noticeably\nthe pattern of the z distribution. The deviations from the distribution\nsymmetry are particularly pronounced for the sample of masers with measured\ntrigonometric parallaxes, where the fraction of Local-arm masers is large. The\nsituation with the sample of HII regions in the solar neighborhood is similar.\nWe have concluded that it is better to exclude the Local arm from\nconsideration. Based on the model of a self-gravitating isothermal disk, we\nhave obtained the following estimates from objects located in the inner region\nof the Galaxy (R<= Ro): zo= -5.7+/-0.5 pc and h2=24.1+/-0.9 pc from the sample\nof 639 methanol masers, zo=-7.6+/-0.4 pc and h2=28.6+/-0.5 pc from 878 HII\nregions, zo=-10.1+/-0.5 pc and h2=28.2+/-0.6 pc from 538 giant molecular\nclouds.\n", "  We consider the production of Wgamma and Zgamma pairs at the LHC, and report\non the fully differential computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)\ncorrections in QCD perturbation theory. The calculation includes leptonic\nvector-boson decays with the corresponding spin correlations, off-shell effects\nand final-state photon radiation. We present numerical results for pp\ncollisions at 7 TeV, and compare them with available ATLAS data. In the case of\nZgamma production, the impact of NNLO corrections is generally moderate,\nranging from 8% to 17%, depending on the applied cuts. In the case of Wgamma\nproduction, the NNLO effects are more important, and range from 19% to 26%,\nthereby improving the agreement of the theoretical predictions with the data.\nAs expected, a veto against jets significantly reduces the impact of QCD\nradiative corrections.\n", "  We present an extensive new time-series of spectroscopic data of the peculiar\nSN 1999aa in NGC 2595. Our data set includes 25 optical spectra between -11 and\n+58 days with respect to B-band maximum light, providing an unusually complete\ntime history. The early spectra resemble those of a SN 1991T-like object but\nwith a relatively strong Ca H&K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si\nII 6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day -7 and its\nvelocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum\nlight. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than\nin SN 1991T suggesting SN 1999aa as a possible link between SN 1991T-like and\nBranch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra,\ndoubly ionized Fe, Si and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are\ncharacteristic of SN 1991T-like objects. Furthermore, in the day -11 spectrum,\nevidence is found for an absorption feature which could be identified as high\nvelocity C II 6580 or H-alpha. At the same epoch C III 4648.8 at photospheric\nvelocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 A. High\nvelocity Ca is found around maximum light together with Si II and Fe II\nconfined in a narrow velocity window. Implied constraints on supernovae\nprogenitor systems and explosion hydrodynamical models are briefly discussed.\n", "  We measured the Josephson plasma resonance (JPR) in optimally doped\nTl$_2$Ba$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ thin films using terahertz time-domain\nspectroscopy in transmission. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of\nthe JPR frequency shows that the c-axis correlations of pancake vortices remain\nintact at the transition from the vortex solid to the liquid phase. In this\nrespect Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ films, withanisotropy parameter\n$\\gamma\\approx 150$, are similar to the less anisotropic\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ $(\\gamma\\approx 8)$ rather than to the most\nanisotropic Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ single crystals $\\gamma\\geq\n500$).\n", "  We present measurements of the transient photoconductivity in pentacene\nsingle crystals using optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy. We have measured the\ntemperature and fluence dependence of the mobility of the photoexcited charge\ncarriers with picosecond resolution. The pentacene crystals were excited at 3.0\neV which is above the bandgap of ~2.2 eV and the induced change in the\nfar-infrared transmission was measured. At 30 K, the carrier mobility is mu ~\n0.4 cm^2/Vs and decreases to mu ~ 0.2 cm^2/Vs at room temperature. The\ntransient terahertz signal reveals the presence of free carriers that are\ntrapped on the timescale of a few ps or less, possibly through the formation of\nexcitons, small polarons, or trapping by impurities.\n"]}
