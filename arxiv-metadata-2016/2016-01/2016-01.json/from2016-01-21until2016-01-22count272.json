semiconductor quantum structure that produces\nelectroluminescence while operating in the light-matter strong coupling regime.\nThe mid-infrared light emitting device is composed of a quantum cascade\nstructure embedded in a planar microcavity, based on the GaAs/AlGaAs material\nsystem. At zero bias, the structure is characterised using reflectivity\nmeasurements which show, up to room temperature, a wide polariton anticrossing\nbetween an intersubband transition and the resonant cavity photon mode. Under\nelectrical injection the spectral features of the emitted light change\ndrastically, as electrons are resonantly injected in a reduced part of the\npolariton branches. Our experiment demonstrates that electrons can be\nselectively injected into polariton states up to room temperature.\n", "  Hadronization in tau -> K K pi nu_tau decays is driven by both vector and\naxial-vector currents that we study, guided by the following principles: The\n1/N_C expansion -worked out at leading order, considering only the contribution\nof the lightest spin one resonances-, approximate chiral symmetry at low\nenergies and the appropriate asymptotic behaviour we demand to the associated\nform factors. All these features are implemented in the resonance theory. Most\nof its couplings are determined by imposing the short-distance requirements of\nvector and axial-vector spectral functions within QCD. We plan to improve our\nprediction of the hadronic spectra using recently available experimental data.\n", "  [Note: important Corrigendum now available at arXiv:1601.04790] The\nisomonodromic tau function defined by Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno vanishes on the\nMalgrange's divisor of generalized monodromy data for which a vector bundle is\nnontrivial, or, which is the same, a certain Riemann-Hilbert problem has no\nsolution. In their original work, Jimbo, Miwa, Ueno did not derive the\ndependence on the (generalized) monodromy data (i.e. monodromy representation\nand Stokes' parameters). We fill the gap by providing a (simpler and more\ngeneral) description in which all the parameters of the problem\n(monodromy-changing and monodromy-preserving) are dealt with at the same level.\nWe thus provide variational formulae for the isomonodromic tau function with\nrespect to the (generalized) monodromy data. The construction applies more\ngenerally: given any (sufficiently well-behaved) family of Riemann-Hilbert\nproblems (RHP) where the jump matrices depend arbitrarily on deformation\nparameters, we can construct a one-form Omega (not necessarily closed) on the\ndeformation space (Malgrange's differential), defined off Malgrange's divisor.\nWe then introduce the notion of discrete Schlesinger transformation: it means\nthat we allow the solution of the RHP to have poles (or zeros) at prescribed\npoint(s). Even if Omega is not closed, its difference evaluated along the\noriginal solution and the transformed one, is shown to be the logarithmic\ndifferential (on the deformation space) of a function. As a function of the\nposition of the points of the Schlesinger transformation, yields a natural\ngeneralization of Sato formula for the Baker-Akhiezer vector even in the\nabsence of a tau function, and it realizes the solution of the RHP as such BA\nvector. Some exemples (Painleve' II and finite Toplitz/Hankel determinants) are\nprovided.\n", "  The hadronic freeze-out line is calculated in terms of the net baryon density\nand the energy density instead of the usual T and mu_B. This analysis makes it\napparent that the freeze-out density exhibits a maximum as the collision energy\nis decreased. This maximum freeze-out density is well within the parameters of\nthe proposed NICA accelerator.\n", "  Several important complex network measures that helped discovering common\npatterns across real-world networks ignore edge weights, an important\ninformation in real-world networks. We propose a new methodology for\ngeneralizing measures of unweighted networks through a generalization of the\ncardinality concept of a set of weights. The key observation here is that many\nmeasures of unweighted networks use the cardinality (the size) of some subset\nof edges in their computation. For example, the node degree is the number of\nedges incident to a node. We define the effective cardinality, a new metric\nthat quantifies how many edges are effectively being used, assuming that an\nedge's weight reflects the amount of interaction across that edge. We prove\nthat a generalized measure, using our method, reduces to the original\nunweighted measure if there is no disparity between weights, which ensures that\nthe laws that govern the original unweighted measure will also govern the\ngeneralized measure when the weights are equal. We also prove that our\ngeneralization ensures a partial ordering (among sets of weighted edges) that\nis consistent with the original unweighted measure, unlike previously developed\ngeneralizations. We illustrate the applicability of our method by generalizing\nfour unweighted network measures. As a case study, we analyze four real-world\nweighted networks using our generalized degree and clustering coefficient. The\nanalysis shows that the generalized degree distribution is consistent with the\npower-law hypothesis but with steeper decline and that there is a common\npattern governing the ratio between the generalized degree and the traditional\ndegree. The analysis also shows that nodes with more uniform weights tend to\ncluster with nodes that also have more uniform weights among themselves.\n", "  Numerous codes are being developed to solve Shallow Water equations. Because\nthere are used in hydraulic and environmental studies, their capability to\nsimulate properly flow dynamics is critical to guarantee infrastructure and\nhuman safety. While validating these codes is an important issue, code\nvalidations are currently restricted because analytic solutions to the Shallow\nWater equations are rare and have been published on an individual basis over a\nperiod of more than five decades. This article aims at making analytic\nsolutions to the Shallow Water equations easily available to code developers\nand users. It compiles a significant number of analytic solutions to the\nShallow Water equations that are currently scattered through the literature of\nvarious scientific disciplines. The analytic solutions are described in a\nunified formalism to make a consistent set of test cases. These analytic\nsolutions encompass a wide variety of flow conditions (supercritical,\nsubcritical, shock, etc.), in 1 or 2 space dimensions, with or without rain and\nsoil friction, for transitory flow or steady state. The corresponding source\ncodes are made available to the community\n(http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/SWASHES), so that users of Shallow\nWater-based models can easily find an adaptable benchmark library to validate\ntheir numerical methods.\n", "  Optical nanostructures have proven to be meritorious for tailoring the\nemission properties of quantum emitters. However, unavoidable fabrication\nimperfections may represent a nuisance. Quite remarkably, disorder offers new\nopportunities since light can be efficiently confined by random multiple\nscattering leading to Anderson localization. Here we investigate the effect of\nsuch disorder-induced cavities on the emission dynamics of single quantum dots\nembedded in disordered photonic-crystal waveguides. We present time-resolved\nmeasurements of both the total emission from Anderson-localized cavities and\nfrom single emitters that are coupled to the cavities. We observe both strongly\ninhibited and enhanced decay rates relative to the rate of spontaneous emission\nin a homogeneous medium. From a statistical analysis, we report an average\nPurcell factor of 2 in without any control on the quantum dot - cavity\ndetuning. By spectrally tuning individual quantum dots into resonance with\nAnderson-localized modes, a maximum Purcell factor of 23.8 is recorded, which\nlies at the onset of the strong coupling regime. The presented data quantify\nthe potential of naturally occurring Anderson-localized cavities for\ncontrolling and enhancing the light-matter interaction strength, which is of\nrelevance not only for cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments but\npotentially also for efficient energy harvesting and controllable random\nlasing.\n", "  In a charge tunable device, we investigate the fine structure splitting of\nneutral excitons in single long-wavelength (1.1\\mu m < \\lambda < 1.3 \\mu m)\nInGaAs quantum dots as a function of external uniaxial strain. Nominal fine\nstructure splittings between 16 and 136 \\mu eV are measured and manipulated. We\nobserve varied response of the splitting to the external strain, including\npositive and negative tuning slopes, different tuning ranges, and linear and\nparabolic dependencies, indicating that these physical parameters depend\nstrongly on the unique microscopic structure of the individual quantum dot. To\nbetter understand the experimental results, we apply a phenomenological model\ndescribing the exciton polarization and fine-structure splitting under uniaxial\nstrain. The model predicts that, with an increased experimental strain tuning\nrange, the fine-structure can be effectively canceled for select telecom\nwavelength dots using uniaxial strain. These results are promising for the\ngeneration of on-demand entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths.\n", "  We extend a recent result of Pantev-Toen-Vaquie-Vezzosi, who constructed\nshifted symplectic structures on derived mapping stacks having a Calabi-Yau\nsource and a shifted symplectic target. Their construction gives a clear\nconceptual framework for the so-called AKSZ formalism.\n  We extend the PTVV construction to derived mapping stacks with boundary\nconditions, which is required in most applications to quantum field theories\n(see e.g. the work of Cattaneo-Felder on the Poisson sigma model, and the\nrecent work of Cattaneo-Mnev-Reshetikhin). We provide many examples of\nLagrangian and symplectic structures that can be recovered in this way.\n  We finally give an application to topological field theories (TFTs). We\nexpect that our approach will help to rigorously constuct a 2 dimensional TFT\nintroduced by Moore and Tachikawa. A subsequent paper will be devoted to the\nconstruction of fully extended TFTs (in the sense of Baez-Dolan and Lurie) from\nmapping stacks.\n", "  The vector and scalar form factors relevant to the second-class current\n$\\tau^-\\to\\pi^-\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\nu_\\tau$ processes are evaluated supplementing\nChiral Perturbation Theory with the inclusion of resonances as explicit degrees\nof freedom. While the vector contribution is essentially fixed from knowledge\nof the two-pion vector form factor, the scalar form factor demands a coupled\nchannel dispersive analysis to obtain robust predictions for the detection of\nthese decay modes.\n", "  The continuous dependence of solutions to certain (non-autonomous, partial,\nintegro-differential-algebraic, evolutionary) equations on the coefficients is\naddressed. We give criteria that guarantee that convergence of the coefficients\nin the weak operator topology implies weak convergence of the respective\nsolutions. We treat three examples: A homogenization problem for a Kelvin-Voigt\nmodel for elasticity, the discussion of continuous dependence of the\ncoefficients for acoustic waves with impedance type boundary conditions and a\nsingular perturbation problem for a mixed type equation. By means of counter\nexamples we show optimality of the results obtained.\n", "  We analyze cascades of defaults in an interbank loan market. The novel\nfeature of this study is that the network structure and the size distribution\nof banks are derived from empirical data. We find that the ability of a\ndefaulted institution to start a cascade depends on an interplay of shock size\nand connectivity. Further results indicate that the ability to limit default\nrisk by spreading the lending to many counterparts decreased with the financial\ncrisis. To evaluate the influence of the network structure on market stability,\nwe compare the simulated cascades from the empirical network with results from\ndifferent randomized network models. The results show that the empirical\nnetwork has non-random features, which cannot be captured by rewired networks.\nThe analysis also reveals that simulations assuming homogeneity for size of\nbanks and loan contracts dramatically overestimates the fragility of the\ninterbank market.\n", "  Shannon's notion of relative information between two physical systems can\nfunction as foundation for statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, without\nreferring to subjectivism or idealism. It can also represent a key missing\nelement in the foundation of the naturalistic picture of the world, providing\nthe conceptual tool for dealing with its apparent limitations. I comment on the\nrelation between these ideas and Democritus.\n", "  The paper is devoted to classify nilpotent Jordan algebras of dimension up to\nfive over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2. We obtained a\nlist of 35 isolated non-isomorphic 5-dimensional nilpotent non-associative\nJordan algebras and 6 families of non-isomorphic 5-dimensional nilpotent\nnon-associative Jordan algebras depending either on one or two parameters over\nan algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 or 3. In addition to\nthese algebras we obtained two non-isomorphic 5-dimensional nilpotent\nnon-associative Jordan algebras over an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic 3.\n", "  We discuss Hilbert space-valued stochastic differential equations associated\nwith the heat semi-groups of the standard model of non-relativistic quantum\nelectrodynamics and of corresponding fiber Hamiltonians for translation\ninvariant systems. In particular, we prove the existence of a stochastic flow\nsatisfying the strong Markov property and the Feller property. To this end we\nemploy an explicit solution ansatz. In the matrix-valued case, i.e., if the\nelectron spin is taken into account, it is given by a series of operator-valued\ntime-ordered integrals, whose integrands are factorized into annihilation,\npreservation, creation, and scalar parts. The Feynman-Kac formula implied by\nthese results is new in the matrix-valued case. Furthermore, we discuss\nstochastic differential equations and Feynman-Kac representations for an\noperator-valued integral kernel of the semi-group. As a byproduct we obtain\nanalogous results for Nelson's model.\n", "  We construct the two dimensional N=(0,4) gauge theory that lives on the world\nvolume of D1-branes and intersecting D5-branes. We conjecture that this theory\nflows in the infra-red to a fixed point with large N=(4,4) superconformal\nsymmetry. The central charge of the conformal field theory is shown to coincide\nwith the holographic dual of string theory compactified on AdS3 x S3 x S3 x S1.\n", "  We quantize the linearised Einstein-Klein-Gordon system on arbitrary on-shell\nbackgrounds in a manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant manner. For the\nspecial case of perturbations in Inflation, i.e. on-shell backgrounds of\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker type, we compare our general quantization\nconstruction with the standard approach to the quantum theory of perturbations\nin Inflation. We find that not all local quantum observables of the linearised\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon system can be split into local observables of scalar and\ntensor type as in the standard approach. However, we argue that this subclass\nof observables is sufficient for measuring perturbations which vanish at\nspatial infinity, which is in line with standard assumptions. Finally, we\ncomment on a recent observation that, upon standard quantization, the quantum\nBardeen potentials display a non-local behaviour and argue that a similar\nphenomenon occurs in any local quantum field theory.\n", "  We have explored morphology of DNA molecules bound with Cu-complexes of\npiroxicam molecules, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), under\none-dimensional confinement of thin films and have studied the effect of\ncounterions present in a buffer. X-ray reflectivity at and away from the Cu K\nabsorption edge and atomic force microscopy studies reveal that confinement\nsegregates the drug molecules preferentially in a top layer of the DNA film,\nand counterions enhance this segregation.\n", "  In a first part, we are concerned with the relationships between polynomials\nin the two generators of the algebra of Heisenberg--Weyl, its Bargmann--Fock\nrepresentation with differential operators and the associated one-parameter\ngroup.Upon this basis, the paper is then devoted to the groups of Riordan\nmatrices associated to the related transformations of matrices (i.e.\nsubstitutions with prefunctions). Thereby, various properties are studied\narising in Riordan arrays, in the Riordan group and, more specifically, in the\n`striped' Riordan subgroups; further, a striped quasigroup and a semigroup are\nalso examined. A few applications to combinatorial structures are also briefly\naddressed in the Appendix.\n", "  On infinite homogeneous structures, two random walkers meet with certainty if\nand only if the structure is recurrent, i.e., a single random walker returns to\nits starting point with probability 1. However, on general inhomogeneous\nstructures this property does not hold and, although a single random walker\nwill certainly return to its starting point, two moving particles may never\nmeet. This striking property has been shown to hold, for instance, on infinite\ncombs. Due to the huge variety of natural phenomena which can be modeled in\nterms of encounters between two (or more) particles diffusing in comb-like\nstructures, it is fundamental to investigate if and, if so, to what extent\nsimilar effects may take place in finite structures. By means of numerical\nsimulations we evidence that, indeed, even on finite structures, the\ntopological inhomogeneity can qualitatively affect the two-particle problem. In\nparticular, the mean encounter time can be polynomially larger than the time\nexpected from the related one particle problem.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the semiclassical magnetic Laplacian. Until now WKB\nexpansions for the eigenfunctions were only established in presence of a\nnon-zero electric potential. Here we tackle the pure magnetic case. Thanks to\nFeynman-Hellmann type formulas and coherent states decomposition, we develop\nhere a magnetic Born-Oppenheimer theory. Exploiting the multiple scales of the\nproblem, we are led to solve an effective eikonal equation in pure magnetic\ncases and to obtain WKB expansions. We also investigate explicit examples for\nwhich we can improve our general theorem: global WKB expansions, quasi-optimal\nestimates of Agmon and upper bound of the tunelling effect (in symmetric\ncases). We also apply our strategy to get more accurate descriptions of the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions in a wide range of situations analyzed in the\nlast two decades.\n", "  Several kinds of q-orthogonal polynomials with |q|=1 are constructed as the\nmain parts of the eigenfunctions of new solvable discrete quantum mechanical\nsystems. Their orthogonality weight functions consist of quantum dilogarithm\nfunctions, which are a natural extension of the Euler gamma functions and the\nq-gamma functions (q-shifted factorials). The dimensions of the orthogonal\nspaces are finite. These q-orthogonal polynomials are expressed in terms of the\nAskey-Wilson polynomials and their certain limit forms.\n", "  Contextuality is a central property in comparative analysis of classical,\nquantum, and supercorrelated systems. We examine and compare two well-motivated\napproaches to contextuality. One approach (\"contextuality-by-default\") is based\non the idea that one and the same physical property measured under different\nconditions (contexts) is represented by different random variables. The other\napproach is based on the idea that while a physical property is represented by\na single random variable irrespective of its context, the joint distributions\nof the random variables describing the system can involve negative\n(quasi-)probabilities. We show that in the Leggett-Garg and EPR-Bell systems,\nthe two measures essentially coincide.\n", "  We propose an iterative method for approximating the capacity of\nclassical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite\ndimensional output, possibly under additional constraints on the input\ndistribution. Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper\nand lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an $\\varepsilon$-close estimate\nto the capacity, the presented algorithm requires $O(\\tfrac{(N \\vee M) M^3\n\\log(N)^{1/2}}{\\varepsilon})$, where $N$ denotes the input alphabet size and\n$M$ the output dimension. We then generalize the method for the task of\napproximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded\ncontinuous input alphabet and a finite dimensional output. For channels with a\nfinite dimensional quantum mechanical input and output, the idea of a universal\nencoder allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity using the same method. In\nparticular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can\nbe reduced to a multidimensional integration problem. For families of quantum\nchannels fulfilling a certain assumption we show that the complexity to derive\nan $\\varepsilon$-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or\neven polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate\nthe performance of the approximation scheme in practice.\n", "  We examine the phenomenon of Landau Damping in relativistic plasmas via a\nstudy of the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson system (rVP) on the torus for initial\ndata sufficiently close to a spatially uniform steady state. We find that if\nthe steady state is regular enough (essentially in a Gevrey class of degree in\na specified range) and that the deviation of the initial data from this steady\nstate is small enough in a certain norm, the evolution of the system is such\nthat its spatial density approaches a uniform constant value sub-exponentially\nfast (i.e. like $\\exp(-C|t|^{\\overline{\\nu}})$ for $\\overline{\\nu} \\in (0,1)$).\nWe take as \\emph{a priori} assumptions that solutions launched by such initial\ndata exist for all times (by no means guaranteed with rVP, but reasonable since\nwe are close to a spatially uniform state) and that the various norms in\nquestion are continuous in time (which should be a consequence of an abstract\nversion of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya Theorem). In addition, we must assume a kind\nof \"reverse Poincar\\'e inequality\" on the Fourier transform of the solution. In\nspirit, this assumption amounts to the requirement that there exists\n$0<\\varkappa<1$ so that the mass in the annulus $\\varkappa \\le |v| < 1$ for the\nsolution launched by the initial data is uniformly small for all $t$.\n", "  Topological insulators represent a paradigm shift in surface physics. The\nmost extensively studied Bi$_2$Se$_3$-type topological insulators exhibit\nlayered structures, wherein neighboring layers are weakly bonded by van der\nWaals interactions. Using first principles density-functional theory\ncalculations, we investigate the impact of the stacking sequence on the\nenergetics and band structure properties of three polymorphs of Bi$_2$Se$_3$,\nBi$_2$Te$_3$, and Sb$_2$Te$_3$. Considering their ultrathin films up to 6 nm as\na function of its layer thickness, the overall dispersion of the band structure\nis found to be insensitive to the stacking sequence, while the band gap is\nhighly sensitive, which may also affect the critical thickness for the onset of\nthe topologically nontrivial phase. Our calculations are consistent with both\nexperimental and theoretical results, where available. We further investigate\ntribological layer slippage, where we find a relatively low energy barrier\nbetween two of the considered structures. Both the stacking-dependent band gap\nand low slippage energy barriers, suggest that polymorphic stacking\nmodification may offer an alternative route for controlling the properties of\nthis new state of matter.\n", "  This paper is a demonstration of how relativistic, broad-lined type Ic\nsupernovae (SNe IcBL) can be used to constrain a value of the Hubble constant\nin the local universe ($H_{0}$). Included in our sample of SNe IcBL are the SNe\nassociated with long-duration $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB-SNe), as well as local\nrelativistic SNe IcBL that are not associated with GRBs. Building upon recent\nresults that found a luminosity$-$stretch relationship for a sample of nine\nGRB-SNe, we demonstrate that GRB-SNe and SNe IcBL have statistically\nsignificant luminosity$-$decline relationships in $BVR$ filters at the $p=0.02$\nconfidence level. Conversely, we show that SNe Ib, Ic and IIb do not have\nstatistically significant luminosity$-$decline relationships. Two of the\nrelativistic SNe IcBL in our sample have independent distance measurements (SN\n2009bb and SN 2012ap) that we used to constrain a weighted-average value of\n${H}_{0,\\rm w}=82.5\\pm8.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is 1$\\sigma$\ngreater than that obtained using SNe Ia, and 2$\\sigma$ larger than that\ndetermined by Planck. This difference can be attributed to large peculiar\nmotions of the host galaxies of the two SNe IcBL, which are members of galaxy\ngroups. When determining a value of $H_{0}$ using SNe Ib, Ic and IIb, we found\nan average value of $H_{0}$ that has a standard deviation of order $20-40$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, which demonstrates that these SNe are poor cosmological\ncandles. With the launch of the next generation of space telescopes, SNe IcBL,\nand in particular GRB-SNe, have the potential to constrain constrain the Hubble\ndiagram up to a redshift of $z=3-5$.\n", "  We prove the crepant resolution conjecture for Donaldson-Thomas invariants of\ntoric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds with transverse A-singularities.\n", "  The nullity distributions of the two curvature tensors \\, $\\overast{R}$ and\n$\\overast{P}$ of the Chern connection of a Finsler manifold are investigated.\nThe completeness of the nullity foliation associated with the nullity\ndistribution $\\N_{R^\\ast}$ is proved. Two counterexamples are given: the first\nshows that $\\N_{R^\\ast}$ does not coincide with the kernel distribution of \\,\n$\\overast{R}$; the second illustrates that $\\N_{P^\\ast}$ is not completely\nintegrable. We give a simple class of a non-Berwaldian Landsberg spaces with\nsingularities.\n", "  This paper has two parts. We first compute the leading contribution to the\nstrong-coupling mixing between the Konishi operator and a double-trace operator\ncomposed of chiral primaries by using flat-space vertex operators for the\nstring-duals of the operators. We then compute the three-point functions for\nprotected or unprotected scalar operators with higher spin operators on the\nleading Regge trajectory. Here we see that the nontrivial spatial structures\nrequired by conformal invariance arise naturally from the form of the\npolarization tensors in the vertex operators. We find agreement with recent\nresults extracted from Mellin amplitudes for four-point functions, as well as\nwith earlier supergravity calculations. We also obtain some new results for\nother combinations of operators.\n", "  Surface oxidation processes are crucial for the functionality of Cu-based\ncatalytic systems used for methanol synthesis, partial oxidation of methanol or\nthe water-gas shift reaction. We assess the stability and population of the\n\"8\"-structure, a $|\\begin{smallmatrix} 3&2\\\\ -1&2 \\end{smallmatrix}|$ oxide\nphase, on the Cu(111) surface. This structure has been observed in x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction experiments as a\nCu(111) surface reconstruction that can be induced by a hyperthermal oxygen\nmolecular beam. Using density-functional theory calculations in combination\nwith \\textit{ab initio} atomistic thermodynamics and Boltzmann statistical\nmechanics, we find that the proposed oxide superstructure is indeed metastable\nand that the population of the \"8\"-structure is competitive with the known \"29\"\nand \"44\" oxide film structures on Cu(111). We show that the configuration of O\nand Cu atoms in the first and second layers of the \"8\"-structure closely\nresembles the arrangement of atoms in the first two layers of Cu$_2$O(110),\nwhere the atoms in the \"8\"-structure are more constricted. Cu$_2$O(110) has\nbeen suggested in the literature as the most active low index facet for\nreactions such as water splitting under light illumination. If the\n\"8\"-structure were to form during a catalytic process, it is therefore likely\nto be one of the reactive phases.\n", "  While quantum theory cannot be described by a local hidden variable model, it\nis nevertheless possible to construct such models that exhibit features\ncommonly associated with quantum mechanics. These models are also used to\nexplore the question of {\\psi}-ontic versus {\\psi}-epistemic theories for\nquantum mechanics. Spekkens' toy theory is one such model. It arises from\nclassical probabilistic mechanics via a limit on the knowledge an observer may\nhave about the state of a system. The toy theory for the simplest possible\nunderlying system closely resembles stabilizer quantum mechanics, a fragment of\nquantum theory which is efficiently classically simulable but also non-local.\nFurther analysis of the similarities and differences between those two theories\ncan thus yield new insights into what distinguishes quantum theory from\nclassical theories, and {\\psi}-ontic from {\\psi}-epistemic theories.\n  In this paper, we develop a graphical language for Spekkens' toy theory.\nGraphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for the analysis of\nquantum mechanics and similar theories. To compare quantum mechanics and a toy\nmodel, it is useful to have similar formalisms for both. We show that our\nlanguage fully describes Spekkens' toy theory and in particular, that it is\ncomplete: meaning any equality that can be derived using other formalisms can\nalso be derived entirely graphically. Our language is inspired by a similar\ngraphical language for quantum mechanics called the ZX-calculus. Thus Spekkens'\ntoy bit theory and stabilizer quantum mechanics can be analysed and compared\nusing analogous graphical formalisms.\n", "  Understanding the epidemic dynamics, and finding out efficient techniques to\ncontrol it, is a challenging issue. A lot of research has been done on targeted\nimmunization strategies, exploiting various global network topological\nproperties. However, in practice, information about the global structure of the\ncontact network may not be available. Therefore, immunization strategies that\ncan deal with a limited knowledge of the network structure are required. In\nthis paper, we propose targeted immunization strategies that require\ninformation only at the community level. Results of our investigations on the\nSIR epidemiological model, using a realistic synthetic benchmark with\ncontrolled community structure, show that the community structure plays an\nimportant role in the epidemic dynamics. An extensive comparative evaluation\ndemonstrates that the proposed strategies are as efficient as the most\ninfluential global centrality based immunization strategies, despite the fact\nthat they use a limited amount of information. Furthermore, they outperform\nalternative local strategies, which are agnostic about the network structure,\nand make decisions based on random walks.\n", "  Ar{\\i}kan's polar coding technique is based on the idea of synthesizing $n$\nchannels from the $n$ instances of the physical channel by a simple linear\nencoding transformation. Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular\ninput to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient\nto determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete\nmemoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the\nother. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is\ndirectly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which\nare essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast\nchannels. Finally we show that these conditions imply that the simple quantum\npolar coding scheme of Renes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050504 (2012)]\nrequires entanglement assistance for general channels, but also show such\nassistance to be unnecessary in many cases of interest.\n", "  We perform a set of cosmological simulations of structure formation in a\nmixed dark matter (MDM) model. Our model is motivated by the recently\nidentified $3.5\\,{\\rm keV}$ X-ray line, which can be explained by the decay of\nnon-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos accounting for $20$-$60\\%$ of the\ndark matter in the Universe. These non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos\nhave a sizable free-streaming length and hence behave effectively as warm dark\nmatter (WDM). Assuming the rest of dark matter is composed of some cold dark\nmatter (CDM) particles, we follow the coevolution of a mixed WDM plus CDM\ncosmology. Specifically, we consider the models with the warm component\nfraction of $r_{\\rm warm}=0.25$ and $0.50$. Our MDM models predict that the\ncomoving Jeans length at the matter-radiation equality is close to that of the\nthermally produced warm dark matter model with particle mass $m_{\\rm\nWDM}=2.4\\,{\\rm keV}$, but the suppression in the fluctuation power spectrum is\nweaker. We perform large $N$-body simulations to study the structure of\nnon-linear dark halos in the MDM models. The abundance of substructure is\nsignificantly reduced in the MDM models, and hence the so-called small-scale\ncrisis is mitigated. The cumulative maximum circular velocity function (CVF) of\nat least one halo in the MDM models is in good agreement with the CVFs of the\nobserved satellites in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. We argue that\nthe MDM models open an interesting possibility to reconcile the reported\n$3.5\\,{\\rm keV}$ line and the internal structure of galaxies.\n", "  Anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic\nrays (UHECRs) produced by powerful sources is numerically evaluated. We show\nthat, taking account of the Galactic magnetic field, nondetection of\nsignificant anisotropy at $\\approx 10^{19}$ eV at present and in future\nexperiments imposes general upper limits on UHECR proton luminosity of steady\nsources as a function of source redshifts. The upper limits constrain the\nexistence of typical steady sources in the local universe and limit the local\ndensity of $10^{19}$ eV UHECR sources to be $\\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3},$\nassuming average intergalactic magnetic fields less than $10^{-9}$ G. This\nisotropy, which is stronger than measured at the highest energies, may indicate\nthe transient generation of UHECRs. Our anisotropy calculations are applied for\nextreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101-232, and\n1ES 0347-121, to test the UHECR-induced cascade model, in which beamed UHECR\nprotons generate TeV radiation in transit from sources. While the\nmagnetic-field structure surrounding the sources affects the required absolute\ncosmic-ray luminosity of the blazars, the magnetic-field structure surrounding\nthe Milky Way directly affects the observed anisotropy. If both of the magnetic\nfields are weak enough, significant UHECR anisotropy from these blazars should\nbe detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory unless the maximum energy of\nUHECR protons is well below $10^{19}$ eV. Furthermore, if these are the sources\nof UHECRs above $10^{19}$ eV, a local magnetic structure surrounding the Milky\nWay is needed to explain the observed isotropy at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV, which may\nbe incompatible with large magnetic structures around all galaxies for the\nUHECR-induced cascade model to work with reasonable jet powers.\n", "  We study the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the square lattice at half\nfilling as a function of next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and\ninteraction strength. To variationally map out the phase diagram of this model,\nwe develop a two-parameter family of wave-functions based on the parton\nconstruction which can describe both topological and broken symmetry phases on\nequal footing. In addition, our wave-functions resolve long standing issues\nwith more conventional short-range Jastrow wave-functions. Using this\nvariational ansatz, we show that a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking\nfractional Chern insulator is energetically favored over a critical region\nbetween two superfluid phases. In verifying the properties of these parton\nwave-functions we exemplify a more robust way to identify topology through the\nHall conductance.\n", "  Gauge invariant conserved conformal currents built from massless fields of\nall spins in 4d Minkowski space-time and $AdS_4$ are described within the\nunfolded dynamics approach. The current cohomology associated with non-zero\nconserved charges is found. The resulting list of charges is shown to match the\nspace of parameters of the conformal higher-spin symmetry algebra in four\ndimensions.\n", "  In recent years, photoacoustics has attracted intensive research for both\nanatomical and functional biomedical imaging. However, the physical interaction\nbetween photoacoustic generated endogenous waves and an exogenous ultrasound\nwave is a largely unexplored area. Here, we report the initial results about\nthe interaction of photoacoustic and external ultrasound waves leading to a\nmicro-Doppler photoacoustic (mDPA) effect, which is experimentally observed and\nconsistently modelled. It is based on a simultaneous excitation on the target\nwith a pulsed laser and continuous wave (CW) ultrasound. The thermoelastically\ninduced expansion will modulate the CW ultrasound and leads to transient\nDoppler frequency shift. The reported mDPA effect can be described as frequency\nmodulation of the intense CW ultrasound carrier through photoacoustic\nvibrations. This technique may open the possibility to sensitively detect the\nphotoacoustic vibration in deep optically and acoustically scattering medium,\navoiding acoustic distortion that exists in state-of-the-art pulsed\nphotoacoustic imaging systems.\n", "  We examine in a semiclassical framework the deflection function of strong\ngravitational lensing, for static and spherically symmetric black holes,\nendowed with a photon sphere. From a first-order WKB analysis near the maximum\nof the Regge-Wheeler potential, we extract the real phase shifts from the\nS-matrix elements and then we derive the associated semiclassical deflection\nfunction, characterized by a logarithmic divergent behavior. More precisely,\nusing the complex angular momentum techniques, we show that the Regge poles and\nthe associated greybody factor residues, for a massless scalar field theory,\nfrom which one can recover the black hole quasinormal complex frequencies as\nwell as the fluctuations of the high energy absorption cross section, play\nnaturally the role of critical parameters in the divergent behavior of the\nsemiclassical deflection function. For very high frequencies, we finally\nrecover the logarithmic part of the classical strong deflection limit, which\nclarifies analytically the fundamental link between quasinormal modes and\nstrong gravitational lensing, suggested in recent works.\n", "  We consider radio bursts that originate from extragalactic neutron stars\n(NSs) by addressing three questions about source distances. What are the\nphysical limitations on coherent radiation at GHz frequencies? Do they permit\ndetection at cosmological distances? How many bursts per NS are needed to\nproduce the inferred burst rate $\\sim 10^3$-$10^4 $sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$? The\nburst rate is comparable to the NS formation rate in a Hubble volume, requiring\nonly one per NS if they are bright enough. However, radiation physics causes us\nto favor a closer population. More bursts per NS are then required but repeats\nin 10 to 100 yr could still be negligible. Bursts are modeled as sub-ns,\ncoherent shot pulses superposed incoherently to produce ms-duration $\\sim 1$ Jy\namplitudes; each shot-pulse can be much weaker than the burst amplitude,\nplacing less restrictive requirements on the emission process. Nonetheless,\nsingle shot pulses are similar to the extreme, unresolved ($< 0.4$ ns) MJy shot\npulse seen from the Crab pulsar, which is consistent with coherent curvature\nradiation emitted near the light cylinder by an almost neutral clump with net\ncharge $\\sim \\pm 10^{21}e$ and total energy $\\gtrsim 10^{23}$ ergs. Bursts from\nGpc distances require incoherent superposition of $\\sim 10^{12}d_{\\rm Gpc}^2$\nshot pulses or a total energy $\\gtrsim 10^{35} d_{\\rm Gpc}^2$ erg. The energy\nreservoir near the light cylinder limits the detection distance to $\\lesssim\n{\\rm few} \\times 100$ Mpc for a fluence $\\sim 1$ Jy ms unless conditions are\nmore extreme than for the Crab pulsar. Similarly, extreme single pulses from\nordinary pulsars and magnetars could be detectable from throughout the Local\nGroup and perhaps farther. Contributions to dispersion measures from galaxy\nclusters will be significant for some of the bursts. We discuss tests for the\nsignatures of bursts associated with extragalactic NSs.\n", "  The MINOS experiment, operating in the NuMI beam since 2005, has provided the\nmost precise measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting $|\\Delta m^2_{32}|$,\nand the recent combination of the $\\nu_\\mu$, $\\nu_e$, and atmospheric neutrino\nsamples has provided some evidence of non-maximal mixing, and hints about the\nneutrino mass hierarchy and the $\\theta_{23}$ octant. Construction of the NOvA\nexperiment, situated off-axis in the upgraded NuMI beam, is almost complete.\nOver the coming years it will have significant power to probe the questions of\nthe mass hierarchy, $\\theta_{23}$ octant, and the possibility of $\\mathcal{CP}$\nviolation in the lepton sector. This paper gives an overview of the results\nfrom MINOS, and of the sensitivity of the NOvA experiment.\n", "  We demonstrate that the transport characteristics of deep optical lattices\nwith one or multiple off-resonant external energy offsets can be\ngreatly-enhanced by modulating the lattice depth in an exotic way. We derive\neffective stationary models for our proposed modulation schemes in the strongly\ninteracting limit, where only one particle can occupy any given site.\nAfterwards we discuss the modifications necessary to recover transport when\nmore than one particle may occupy the lattice sites. For the specific five-site\nlattices discussed, we numerically predict transport gains for ranging from\n$4.7\\times 10^6$ to $9.8\\times 10^{8}$.\n", "  We study the phase diagram and the stability of the ground state for certain\nfour-dimensional gauge-Yukawa theories whose high-energy behaviour is\ncontrolled by an interacting fixed point. We also provide analytical and\nnumerical results for running couplings, their crossover scales, the\nseparatrix, and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential. Classical and quantum\nstability of the vacuum is established.\n", "  The Gelfand pattern of the reduction of the N-fold tensor product of the\nfundamental representation of the special unitary group SU(2) by itself is\nstudied in the framework of a finite Heisenberg model with infinite range,\nwhere N spins couple to each other with the same strength. The present findings\nare related to the microstatistics of non-rotating black holes for illustrative\npurposes.\n", "  Pseudospin plays a central role in many novel physical properties of graphene\nand other artificial systems which have pseudospins of 1/2. Here we show that\nin certain photonic crystals (PCs) exhibiting conical dispersions at k = 0, the\neigenmodes near the \"Dirac-like point\" can be described by an effective\nspin-orbit Hamiltonian with a pseudospin of 1, treating wave propagations in\nthe upper cone, the lower cone and a flat band (corresponding to zero\nrefractive index) within a unified framework. The 3-component spinor gives rise\nto boundary conditions distinct from those of pseudospin-1/2, leading to new\nwave transport behaviors as manifested in Klein tunneling and supercollimation.\nFor example, collimation can be realized more easily with pseudospin-1 than\npseudospin-1/2. The special wave scattering properties of pseudospin-1 photons,\ncoupled with the discovery that the effective photonic \"potential\" can be\nvaried by a simple change of length scale, may offer new ways to control photon\ntransport.\n", "  Metasurfaces offer unprecedented flexibility in the design and control of\nlight propagation, replacing bulk optical components and exhibiting exotic\noptical effects. One of the basic properties of the metasurfaces, which renders\nthem as frequency selective surfaces, is the ability to transmit or reflect\nradiation within a narrow spectral band that can be engineered on demand. Here\nwe introduce and demonstrate experimentally in the THz domain the concept of\nwavevector selective surfaces -- metasurfaces transparent only within a narrow\nrange of light propagation directions operating effectively as tunnel vision\nfilters. Practical implementations of the new concept include applications in\nwavefront manipulation, observational instruments, vision and free-space\ncommunication in light-scattering environments, as well as passive camouflage.\n", "  We propose a general method for the construction and analysis of unweighted\n$\\epsilon$ - recurrence networks from chaotic time series. The selection of the\ncritical threshold $\\epsilon_c$ in our scheme is done empirically and we show\nthat its value is closely linked to the embedding dimension $M$. In fact, we\nare able to identify a small critical range $\\Delta \\epsilon$ numerically that\nis approximately the same for the random and several standard chaotic time\nseries for a fixed $M$. This provides us a uniform framework for the non\nsubjective comparison of the statistical measures of the recurrence networks\nconstructed from various chaotic attractors. We explicitly show that the degree\ndistribution of the recurrence network constructed by our scheme is\ncharacteristic to the structure of the attractor and display statistical scale\ninvariance with respect to increase in the number of nodes $N$. We also present\ntwo practical applications of the scheme, detection of transition between two\ndynamical regimes in a time delayed system and identification of the\ndimensionality of the underlying system from real world data with limited\nnumber of points, through recurrence network measures. The merits, limitations\nand the potential applications of the proposed method have also been\nhighlighted.\n", "  We study a random Schroedinger operator, the Laplacian with N independently\nuniformly distributed random delta potentials on flat tori T^d_L = R^d/LZ^d, d\n= 2, 3, where L > 0 is large. We determine a condition in terms of the size of\nthe torus L, the density of the potentials \\rho = N/L^d and the energy of the\neigenfunction E such any such eigenfunctions will with nonzero probability be\nuniformly distributed on the entire torus. We remark that the equidistribution\nwe prove here is still consistent with a localized regime, where the\nlocalization length is much larger than the size of the torus. In fact our\nresult implies a certain polynomial lower bound on the localization length, so\nthe localization length becomes infinitely large as E tends to infinity.\n", "  We trace the development of elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$) via parton-parton\ncollision history in two transport models. The parton $v_2$ is studied as a\nfunction of the number of collisions of each parton in Au+Au and $d$+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV. It is found that the majority of\n$v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape probability of partons, with no\nfundamental difference at low and high transverse momenta. The contribution to\n$v_2$ from hydrodynamic-type collective flow is found to be small. Only when\nthe parton-parton cross-section is set unrealistically large does this\ncontribution start to take over. Our findings challenge the current paradigm\nemerged from hydrodynamic comparisons to anisotropy data.\n", "  Investigations of nerve activity have focused predominantly on electrical\nphenomena. Nerves, however, are thermodynamic systems, and changes in\ntemperature and in the dimensions of the nerve can also be observed during the\naction potential. Measurements of heat changes during the action potential\nsuggest that the nerve pulse shares many characteristics with an adiabatic\npulse. First experiments in the 1980s suggested small changes in nerve\nthickness and length during the action potential. Such findings have led to the\nsuggestion that the action potential may be related to electromechanical\nsolitons traveling without dissipation. However, they have been no modern\nattempts to study mechanical phenomena in nerves. Here, we present\nultrasensitive AFM recordings of mechanical changes on the order of 2 - 12\n{\\AA} in the giant axons of the lobster. We show that the nerve thickness\nchanges in phase with voltage change. When stimulated at opposite ends of the\nsame axon, colliding action potentials pass through one another and do not\nannihilate. These observations are consistent with a mechanical interpretation\nof the nervous impulse.\n", "  We present a message-passing algorithm to solve the edge disjoint path\nproblem (EDP) on graphs incorporating under a unique framework both traffic\noptimization and path length minimization. The min-sum equations for this\nproblem present an exponential computational cost in the number of paths. To\novercome this obstacle we propose an efficient implementation by mapping the\nequations onto a weighted combinatorial matching problem over an auxiliary\ngraph. We perform extensive numerical simulations on random graphs of various\ntypes to test the performance both in terms of path length minimization and\nmaximization of the number of accommodated paths. In addition, we test the\nperformance on benchmark instances on various graphs by comparison with\nstate-of-the-art algorithms and results found in the literature. Our\nmessage-passing algorithm always outperforms the others in terms of the number\nof accommodated paths when considering non trivial instances (otherwise it\ngives the same trivial results). Remarkably, the largest improvement in\nperformance with respect to the other methods employed is found in the case of\nbenchmarks with meshes, where the validity hypothesis behind message-passing is\nexpected to worsen. In these cases, even though the exact message-passing\nequations do not converge, by introducing a reinforcement parameter to force\nconvergence towards a sub optimal solution, we were able to always outperform\nthe other algorithms with a peak of 27% performance improvement in terms of\naccommodated paths. On random graphs, we numerically observe two separated\nregimes: one in which all paths can be accommodated and one in which this is\nnot possible. We also investigate the behaviour of both the number of paths to\nbe accommodated and their minimum total length.\n", "  We present a class of exact solutions of Einstein field equations for a\nshear-free spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid undergoing radial heat flow.\nThe interior metric fulfilled all the relevant physical and thermodynamic\nconditions and matched with Vaidya exterior metric over the boundary. Initially\nthe interior solutions represent a static configuration of dissipative fluid\nwhich then gradually starts evolving into radiating collapse. The apparent\nluminosity observed by the distant observer at rest at infinity and the\neffective surface temperature are zero in remote past at the instance when\ncollapse begins and at the stage when collapsing configuration reach the\nhorizon of the black hole.\n", "  Impurity induced low temperature upturns in both the ab-plane and the c-axis\ndc-resistivities of cuprates in the pseudogap state have been observed in\nexperiments. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon by incorporating\nimpurity scattering of the charge carriers within a phenomenological model by\nYang-Rice-Zhang in this regime. The scattering between charge carriers and the\nimpurity atom is considered within the lowest order Born approximation.\nResistivity is calculated within Kubo formula using the impurity renormalized\nspectral functions. Using physical parameters for cuprates, we describe\nqualitative features of the upturn phenomena and its doping evolution that\ncoincides with the experimental findings and we stress the role of strong\nelectronic correlations.\n", "  We describe results of measurements of the orientational motion of glass\nmicrorods in a microchannel flow, following the orientational motion of\nparticles with different shapes. We determine how the orientational dynamics\ndepends on the shape of the particle and on its initial orientation. We find\nthat the dynamics depends so sensitively on the degree to which particle\naxisymmetry is broken that it is difficult to find particles that are\nsufficiently axisymmetric so that they exhibit periodic tumbling (\"Jeffery\norbits\"). The results of our measurements confirm earlier theoretical analysis\npredicting sensitive dependence on particle shape and its initial orientation.\nOur results illustrate the different types of orientational dynamics for\nasymmetric particles predicted by theory.\n", "  The recently introduced two- and three-parameter ($p,q$)- and\n($p,q,\\mu$)-deformed extensions of the Heisenberg algebra were explored under\nthe condition of their connectedness with the respective nonstandard (other\nthan known ones) deformed quantum oscillator algebras. In this paper we show\nthat such connection dictates certain new $\\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermitian\nconjugation rule between the creation and annihilation operators, with\n$\\eta(N)$ depending on the particle number operator $N$. In turn, that leads to\nthe related $\\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermiticity of the position/momentum operators,\nthough the involved Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Different possible cases are\nstudied, and some interesting features implied by the use of such\n$\\eta(N)$-based conjugation rule are emphasized.\n", "  We present the final combination of CDF and D0 measurements of cross sections\nfor single-top-quark production in proton-antiproton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data correspond to total integrated\nluminosities of up to 9.7 fb$^{-1}$ per experiment. The $t$-channel cross\nsection is measured to be $\\sigma_t = 2.25^{+0.29}_{-0.31}$ pb. We also present\nthe combinations of the two-dimensional measurements of the $s$- vs.\n$t$-channel cross sections and of the $s+t$ channel cross section measurement\nresulting in $\\sigma_{s+t} = 3.30^{+0.52}_{-0.40}$ pb, without assuming the\nstandard-model value for the ratio $\\sigma_s/\\sigma_t$. The resulting value of\nthe magnitude of the top-to-bottom quark coupling is $|V_{tb}|$ =\n$1.02^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, corresponding to $|V_{tb}| > 0.92$ at the 95% C.L.\n", "  We study momentum imbalance as a function of jet asymmetry in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions. To implement parton production during the collision, we\ninclude all Leading Order (LO) $2\\to 2$ and $2\\to 3$ parton processes in pQCD.\nThe produced partons lose energy within the quark gluon plasma and hadronize\ncollinearly when they leave it. The energy and momentum deposited into the\nplasma is described using linear viscous hydrodynamics with a constant energy\nloss per unit length and a total energy loss given by a Gaussian probability\ncentered around a mean value $\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}$ and a half-width\n$\\Delta{\\mathcal{E}}$. We argue that the shape of the asymmetry observed by the\nCERN-CMS Collaboration can indeed be attributed to parton energy loss in the\nmedium and that a good description of data is achieved when one includes a\nslight enhancement coming from the contribution of $2\\to 3$ parton processes\nthat modifies the asymmetry distribution of the dijet events. We compare our\nresults to CMS data for the most central collisions and study different values\nfor $\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}$ and $\\Delta{\\mathcal{E}}$.\n", "  We find that several layer-phase group-III monochalcogenides, including GaS,\nGaSe and InSe, are piezoelectric in the monolayer form. First-principles\ncalculations reveal that the piezoelectric coefficients of monolayer GaS, GaSe\nand InSe are on the same order of magnitude as the earlier discovered\ntwo-dimensional piezoelectric materials, such as BN and MoS2 monolayers. Our\nstudy expands the family of two dimensional piezoelectric materials, suggesting\nthat strong piezoelectric response can occur in a wide range of two dimensional\nmaterials with broken inversion symmetry. The co-existence of piezoelectricity\nand superior photo-sensitivity in these two-dimensional semiconductors enables\nthe integration of electromechanical and optical sensors on the same material\nplatform.\n", "  We analyze the frequency dependence of the dispersion measure (DM), the\ncolumn density of free electrons to a pulsar, caused by multipath scattering\nfrom small scale electron-density fluctuations. The DM is slightly different\nalong each propagation path and the transverse spread of paths varies greatly\nwith frequency, yielding time-of-arrival (TOA) perturbations that scale\ndifferently than the inverse square of the frequency, the expected dependence\nfor a cold, unmagnetized plasma. We quantify DM and TOA perturbations\nanalytically for thin phase screens and extended media and verify the results\nwith simulations of thin screens. The rms difference between DMs across an\noctave band near 1.5~GHz $\\sim 4\\times10^{-5}\\,{\\rm pc\\ cm^{-3}}$ for pulsars\nat $\\sim 1$~kpc distance. TOA errors from chromatic DMs are of order a few to\nhundreds of nanoseconds for pulsars with DM $\\lesssim 30$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ observed\nacross an octave band but increase rapidly to microseconds or larger for larger\nDMs and wider frequency ranges. Frequency-dependent DMs introduce correlated\nnoise into timing residuals whose power spectrum is `low pass' in form. The\ncorrelation time is of order the geometric mean of the refraction times for the\nhighest and lowest radio frequencies used and thus ranges from days to years,\ndepending on the pulsar. We discuss the implications for methodologies that use\nlarge frequency separations or wide bandwidth receivers for timing\nmeasurements. Chromatic DMs are partially mitigable by using an additional\nchromatic term in arrival time models. Without mitigation, our results provide\nan additional term in the noise model for pulsar timing; they also indicate\nthat in combination with measurement errors from radiometer noise, an arbitrary\nincrease in total frequency range (or bandwidth) will yield diminishing\nbenefits and may be detrimental to overall timing precision.\n", "  This paper is a brief overview of the concepts involved in measuring the\ndegree of contextuality and detecting contextuality in systems of binary\nmeasurements of a finite number of objects. We discuss and clarify the main\nconcepts and terminology of the theory called \"contextuality-by-default,\" and\nthen discuss a possible generalization of the theory from binary to arbitrary\nmeasurements.\n", "  We investigate the curvature-dependence of water dynamics in the vicinity of\nhydrophobic spherical solutes using molecular dynamics simulations. For both,\nthe lateral and perpendicular diffusivity as well as for H-bond kinetics of\nwater in the first hydration shell, we find a non-monotonic solute-size\ndependence, exhibiting extrema close to the well-known structural crossover\nlength scale for hydrophobic hydration. Additionally, we find an apparently\nanomalous diffusion for water moving parallel to the surface of small solutes,\nwhich, however, can be explained by topology effects. The intimate connection\nbetween solute curvature, water structure and dynamics has implications for our\nunderstanding of hydration dynamics at heterogeneous biomolecular surfaces.\n", "  We study the localization of eigenfunctions produced by a point scatterer on\na thin rectangle. We find an explicit set of eigenfunctions localized to part\nof the rectangle by showing that the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operator\nwith a Dirac delta potential asymptotically governs the spectral properties of\nthe two-dimensional point scatterer. We also find the rate of localization in\nterms of the aspect ratio of the rectangle. In addition, we present numerical\nresults regarding the asymptotic behavior of the localization.\n", "  Arising from emergent electromagnetic field of magnetic skyrmions due to\ntheir nontrivial topology, the skyrmion Hall effect might be a roadblock for\npractical applications since any longitudinal motions of skyrmions in nanotrack\nis accompanied by a transverse motion. A direct consequence of such an effect\nis easy destruction of skyrmions at the nanotrack edges during their fast\nmotions along the nanotrack, despite their topological protection. Here we\npropose an entirely novel solution of completely inhibiting such skyrmion Hall\neffect without affecting its topological properties based on a\nantiferromagnetic-coupling bilayer system. We show that a pair of magnetic\nskyrmions can be nucleated in such a bilayer system through vertical current\ninjection or converted from a current-driven domain-wall pair. Once nucleated,\nthe skyrmion pair can be displaced through current-induced spin torque either\nfrom a vertical injected current or in-plane current. The skyrmion Hall effect\nis completely suppressed due to the cancellation of back-action forces acting\non each individual skyrmion, resulting in a straight and fast motion of\nskyrmions along the current direction. This proposal will be of fundamental\ninterests by introducing the bilayer degree of freedom into the system.\nMoreover, it provides an easy way to engineer the transport properties of the\nskyrmionic devices to achieve desired performance, making it highly promising\nfor practical applications such as ultradense memory and information-processing\ndevices based on skyrmions.\n", "  We present rest-frame NIR luminosities and stellar masses for a large and\nuniformly-selected population of GRB host galaxies using deep Spitzer Space\nTelescope imaging of 119 targets from the Swift GRB Host Galaxy Legacy Survey\nspanning 0.03 < z < 6.3, and determine the effects of galaxy evolution and\nchemical enrichment on the mass distribution of the GRB host population across\ncosmic history. We find strong evolution in the host luminosity distribution\nbetween z~0.5 (median absolute NIR AB magnitude ~ -18.5, corresponding to M* ~\n3x10^8 M_sun and z~1.5), but negligible variation between z~1.5 and z~5 (median\nmagnitude ~ -21.2, corresponding to M* ~ 5x10^9 M_sun). Dust-obscured GRBs\ndominate the massive host population but are only rarely seen associated with\nlow-mass hosts, indicating that massive star-forming galaxies are universally\nand (to some extent) homogeneously dusty at high-redshift while low-mass\nstar-forming galaxies retain little dust in their ISM. Comparing our luminosity\ndistributions to field surveys and measurements of the high-z mass-metallicity\nrelation, our results have good consistency with a model in which the GRB rate\nper unit star-formation is constant in galaxies with gas-phase metallicity\nbelow approximately the Solar value but heavily suppressed in more metal-rich\nenvironments. This model also naturally explains the previously-reported\n\"excess\" in the GRB rate beyond z>2; metals stifle GRB production in most\ngalaxies at z<1.5 but have only minor impact at higher redshifts. The\nmetallicity threshold we infer is much higher than predicted by single-star\nmodels and favors a binary progenitor. Our observations also constrain the\nfraction of cosmic star-formation in low-mass galaxies undetectable to Spitzer\nto be a small minority at most redshifts (~10% at z~2, ~25% at z~3, and ~50% at\nz=3.5-6.0).\n", "  We introduce the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxy Legacy Survey (\"SHOALS\"),\na multi-observatory high-redshift galaxy survey targeting the largest unbiased\nsample of long-duration gamma-ray burst hosts yet assembled (119 in total). We\ndescribe the motivations of the survey and the development of our selection\ncriteria, including an assessment of the impact of various observability\nmetrics on the success rate of afterglow-based redshift measurement. We briefly\noutline our host-galaxy observational program, consisting of deep Spitzer/IRAC\nimaging of every field supplemented by similarly-deep, multi-color optical/NIR\nphotometry, plus spectroscopy of events without pre-existing redshifts. Our\noptimized selection cuts combined with host-galaxy follow-up have so far\nenabled redshift measurements for 110 targets (92%) and placed upper limits on\nall but one of the remainder. About 20% of GRBs in the sample are heavily\ndust-obscured, and at most 2% originate from z>5.5. Using this sample we\nestimate the redshift-dependent GRB rate density, showing it to peak at z~2.5\nand fall by about an order of magnitude towards low (z=0) redshift, while\ndeclining more gradually towards high (z~7) redshift. This behavior is\nconsistent with a progenitor whose formation efficiency varies modestly over\ncosmic history. Our survey will permit the most detailed examination to date of\nthe connection between the GRB host population and general star-forming\ngalaxies, directly measure evolution in the host population over cosmic time\nand discern its causes, and provide new constraints on the fraction of cosmic\nstar-formation occurring in undetectable galaxies at all redshifts.\n", "  We present a simple calculation of the flux of secondary positrons produced\nin the ISM that is based only on priors. Our calculated ISM flux agrees very\nwell with that calculated with the elaborate GALPROP code. It confirms that\nsecondary production of positrons in the ISM by the primary cosmic rays cannot\nexplain the observed sub-TeV flux of CR positrons. Moreover, we show that once\nenergy loss of positrons in source and in the ISM are included, secondary\nproduction inside the CR sources plus the ISM does explain the measured\nnear-Earth flux of cosmic ray positrons.\n", "  Spin Hall effect (SHE) has been discussed in the context of Kubo formulation,\ngeometric physics, spin orbit force, and numerous semi-classical treatments. It\ncan be confusing if the different pictures have partial or overlapping claims\nof contribution to the SHE. In this article, we present a gauge-theoretic,\ntime-momentum elucidation, which provides a general SHE equation of motion,\nthat unifies under one theoretical framework, all contributions of SHE\nconductivity due to the kinetic, the spin orbit force (Yang-Mills), and the\ngeometric (Murakami-Fujita) effects. Our work puts right an ambiguity\nsurrounding previously partial treatments involving the Kubo, semiclassical,\nBerry curvatures, or the spin orbit force. The full treatment shows the Rashba\n2DEG SHE conductivity to be +e/8{\\pi} instead of -e/8{\\pi} , and Rashba heavy\nhole +9e/8{\\pi} instead of -9e/8{\\pi} .\n", "  Scientific studies investigating laws and regularities of human behavior are\nnowadays increasingly relying on the wealth of widely available digital\ninformation produced by human social activity. In this paper we leverage big\ndata created by three different aspects of human activity (i.e., bank card\ntransactions, geotagged photographs and tweets) in Spain for quantifying city\nattractiveness for the foreign visitors. An important finding of this papers is\na strong superlinear scaling of city attractiveness with its population size.\nThe observed scaling exponent stays nearly the same for different ways of\ndefining cities and for different data sources, emphasizing the robustness of\nour finding. Temporal variation of the scaling exponent is also considered in\norder to reveal seasonal patterns in the attractiveness\n", "  A sinusoidally time-varying pattern of the values of the Newton's constant of\ngravitation $G$ measured in Earth-based laboratories over the latest decades\nhas been recently reported in the literature. We put to the test the hypothesis\nthat the aforementioned harmonic variation may pertain $G$ itself in a direct\nand independent way. We numerically integrated the ad-hoc modified equations of\nmotion of the major bodies of the Solar System by finding that the orbits of\nthe planets would be altered by an unacceptably larger amount in view of the\npresent-day high accuracy astrometric measurements. In the case of Saturn, its\ngeocentric right ascension $\\alpha$, declination $\\delta$ and range $\\rho$\nwould be affected up to $10^4-10^5$ milliarcseconds and $10^5$ km,\nrespectively; the present-day residuals of such observables are as little as\nabout $4$ milliarcseconds and $10^{-1}$ km, respectively. \\textcolor{black}{We\nanalytically calculated the long-term orbital effects induced by the putative\nharmonic variation of $G$ at hand finding non-zero rates of change for the\nsemimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity $e$ and the argument of pericenter\n$\\omega$ of a test particle. For the LAGEOS satellite, an orbital increase as\nlarge as $3.9$ m yr$^{-1}$ is predicted, in contrast with the observed decay of\n$-0.203\\pm 0.035$ m yr$^{-1}$. An anomalous perihelion precession as large as\n14 arcseconds per century is implied for Saturn, while latest observations\nconstrain it down to the $10^{-4}$ arcseconds per century level. The rejection\nlevel provided by Mercury is of the same order of magnitude.\n", "  The magnetic skyrmion with the topological number of unity ($Q=1$) is a\nwell-known nanometric swirling spin structure in the nonlinear $\\sigma$ model\nwith the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Here, we show that magnetic\nskyrmion with the topological number of two ($Q=2$) can be created and\nstabilized by applying vertical spin-polarized current though it cannot exist\nas a static stable excitation. Magnetic skyrmion with $Q=2$ is a nonequilibrium\ndynamic object, subsisting on a balance between the energy injection from the\ncurrent and the energy dissipation by the Gilbert damping. Once it is created,\nit becomes a topologically protected object against fluctuations of various\nvariables including the injected current itself. Hence, we may call it a\ntopologically protected dissipative structure. We also elucidate the nucleation\nand destruction mechanisms of the magnetic skyrmion with $Q=2$ by studying the\nevolutions of the magnetization distribution, the topological charge density as\nwell as the energy density. Our results will be useful for the study of the\nnontrivial topology of magnetic skyrmions with higher topological numbers.\n", "  We have identified a missing long-distance (one-photon exchange) contribution\nto the $B^\\pm\\to K^\\pm/\\pi^\\pm\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays. Although it does not help\nto explain the anomaly measured by the LHCb Coll. in the ratio $R_K =\n\\mathcal{B}(B^\\pm\\to K^\\pm\\mu^+\\mu^-)/\\mathcal{B}(B^\\pm\\to K^\\pm\ne^+e^-)\\sim0.75$ (2.6 $\\sigma$ deviation with respect to\n$R_K=1+\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ in the Standard Model), it provides a sizable\ncontribution to the branching ratio of the $B^\\pm\\to \\pi^\\pm\\ell^+\\ell^-$\ndecays. The new decay mechanism gives rise to a measurable CP asymmetry, which\nis of order 1\\% in both channels. These predictions can be tested in\nforthcoming LHCb measurements.\n", "  We observe entropy decrease towards the past. Does this imply that in the\npast the world was in a non-generic microstate? I point out an alternative. The\nsubsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small\nnumber of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to\ndepends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe\ndepends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low\npast entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate\nof the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a\nsufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse\ngraining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the\n\"past\"). These are the subsystems allowing creatures that \"live in time\"\n---such as those in the biosphere--- to exist. I reply to some objections\nraised to an earlier presentation of this idea, in particular by Bob Wald,\nDavid Albert and Jim Hartle.\n", "  The ubiquity of power-law relations in empirical data displays physicists'\nlove of simple laws and uncovering common causes among seemingly unrelated\nphenomena. However, many reported power laws lack statistical support and\nmechanistic backings, not to mention discrepancies with real data are often\nexplained away as corrections due to finite size or other variables. We propose\na simple experiment and rigorous statistical procedures to look into these\nissues. Making use of the fact that the occurrence rate and pulse intensity of\ncrumple sound obey power law with an exponent that varies with material, we\nsimulate a complex system with two driving mechanisms by crumpling two\ndifferent sheets together. The probability function of crumple sound is found\nto transit from two power-law terms to a {\\it bona fide} power law as\ncompaction increases. In addition to showing the vicinity of these two\ndistributions in the phase space, this observation nicely demonstrates the\neffect of interactions to bring about a subtle change in macroscopic behavior\nand more information may be retrieved if the data are subject to sorting. Our\nanalyses are based on the Akaike information criterion that is a direct\nmeasurement of information loss and emphasizes the need to strike a balance\nbetween model simplicity and goodness of fit. As a show of force, the Akaike\ninformation criterion also found the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes and\nthe scale-free model for brain functional network, 2-dimensional sand pile, and\nsolar flare intensity to suffer excessive loss of information. They resemble\nmore the crumpled-together ball at low compactions in that there appear to be\ntwo driving mechanisms that take turns occurring.\n", "  To study the critical Casimir force between chemically structured boundaries\nimmersed in a binary mixture at its demixing transition, we consider a strip of\nIsing spins subject to alternating fixed spin boundary conditions. The system\nexhibits a boundary induced phase transition as function of the relative amount\nof up and down boundary spins. This transition is associated with a sign change\nof the asymptotic force and a diverging correlation length that sets the scale\nfor the crossover between different universal force amplitudes. Using conformal\nfield theory and a mapping to Majorana fermions, we obtain the universal\nscaling function of this crossover, and the force at short distances.\n", "  We build a family of explicit one-forms on $S^3$ which are shown to form a\ncomplete set of eigenmodes for the Laplace-de Rahm operator.\n", "  The effects of chiral imbalance and external magnetic field on pion\nsuperfluidity and color superconductivity are investigated in extended\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio models. We take Schwinger approach to treat the interaction\nbetween charged pion condensate and magnetic field at finite isospin density\nand include simultaneously the chiral imbalance and magnetic field at finite\nbaryon density. For the superfluidity, the chiral imbalance and magnetic field\nlead to catalysis and inverse catalysis effects, respectively. For the\nsuperconductivity, the chiral imbalance enhances the critical baryon density,\nand the magnetic field results in a de Haas--van Alphan oscillation on the\nphase transition line.\n", "  Topologically ordered systems are characterized by topological invariants\nthat are often calculated from the momentum space integration of a certain\nfunction that represents the curvature of the many-body state. The curvature\nfunction may be Berry curvature, Berry connection, or other quantities\ndepending on the system. Akin to stretching a messy string to reveal the number\nof knots it contains, a scaling procedure is proposed for the curvature\nfunction in inversion symmetric systems, from which the topological phase\ntransition can be identified from the flow of the driving energy parameters\nthat control the topology (hopping, chemical potential, etc.) under scaling. At\nan infinitesimal operation, one obtains the renormalization group (RG)\nequations for the driving energy parameters. A length scale defined from the\ncurvature function near the gap-closing momentum is suggested to characterize\nthe scale invariance at critical points and fixed points, and displays a\nuniversal critical behavior in a variety of systems examined.\n", "  We report the first lattice QCD calculation of the complex kaon decay\namplitude $A_0$ with physical kinematics, using a $32^3\\times 64$ lattice\nvolume and a single lattice spacing $a$, with $1/a= 1.3784(68)$ GeV. We find\nRe$(A_0) = 4.66(1.00)(1.26) \\times 10^{-7}$ GeV and Im$(A_0) =\n-1.90(1.23)(1.08) \\times 10^{-11}$ GeV, where the first error is statistical\nand the second systematic. The first value is in approximate agreement with the\nexperimental result: Re$(A_0) = 3.3201(18) \\times 10^{-7}$ GeV while the second\ncan be used to compute the direct CP violating ratio\nRe$(\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon)=1.38(5.15)(4.59)\\times 10^{-4}$, which is\n$2.1\\sigma$ below the experimental value $16.6(2.3)\\times 10^{-4}$. The real\npart of $A_0$ is CP conserving and serves as a test of our method while the\nresult for Re$(\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon)$ provides a new test of the\nstandard-model theory of CP violation, one which can be made more accurate with\nincreasing computer capability.\n", "  Adiabatic methods are potentially important for quantum information protocols\nbecause of their robustness against many sources of technical and fundamental\nnoise. They are particularly useful for quantum transport, and in some cases\nelementary quantum gates. Here we explore the extension of a particular\nprotocol, dark state adiabatic passage, where a spin state is transported\nacross a branched network of initialised spins, comprising one `input' spin,\nand multiple leaf spins. We find that maximal entanglement is generated in\nsystems of spin-half particles, or where the system is limited to one\nexcitation.\n", "  In social networks, individuals constantly drop ties and replace them by new\nones in a highly unpredictable fashion. This highly dynamical nature of social\nties has important implications for processes such as the spread of information\nor of epidemics. Several studies have demonstrated the influence of a number of\nfactors on the intricate microscopic process of tie replacement, but the\nmacroscopic long-term effects of such changes remain largely unexplored. Here\nwe investigate whether, despite the inherent randomness at the microscopic\nlevel, there are macroscopic statistical regularities in the long-term\nevolution of social networks. In particular, we analyze the email network of a\nlarge organization with over 1,000 individuals throughout four consecutive\nyears. We find that, although the evolution of individual ties is highly\nunpredictable, the macro-evolution of social communication networks follows\nwell-defined statistical patterns, characterized by exponentially decaying\nlog-variations of the weight of social ties and of individuals' social\nstrength. At the same time, we find that individuals have social signatures and\ncommunication strategies that are remarkably stable over the scale of several\nyears.\n", "  We consider collision of two particles in rotating spacetimes without\nhorizons. If the metric coefficient responsible for rotation of spacetime is\nbig enough, the energy of collisions in the centre of mass frame can be as\nlarge as one likes. This can happen in the ergoregion only. The results are\nmodel-independent and apply both to relativistic stars and wormholes.\n", "  Germanium is a widely used material for electronic and optoelectronic devices\nand recently it has become an important material for spintronics and quantum\ncomputing applications. Donor spins in silicon have been shown to support very\nlong coherence times ($T_{2}$) when the host material is isotopically enriched\nto remove any magnetic nuclei. Germanium also has non-magnetic isotopes so it\nis expected to support long $T_{2}$s while offering some new properties.\nCompared to Si, Ge has a strong spin-orbit coupling, large electron\nwavefunction, high mobility, and highly anisotropic conduction band valleys\nwhich will all give rise to new physics. In this Letter, the first pulsed\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) measurements of $T_{2}$ and the spin-lattice\nrelaxation ($T_1$) times for $^{75}$As and $^{31}$P donors in natural and\nisotopically enriched germanium are presented. We compare samples with various\nlevels of isotopic enrichment and find that spectral diffusion due to $^{73}$Ge\nnuclear spins limits the coherence in samples with significant amounts of\n$^{73}$Ge. For the most highly enriched samples, we find that $T_1$ limits\n$T_2$ to $T_2 = 2T_1$. We report an anisotropy in $T_1$ and the ensemble\nlinewidths for magnetic fields oriented along different crystal axes but do not\nresolve any angular dependence to the spectral-diffusion-limited $T_2$ in\nsamples with $^{73}$Ge.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of entanglement given by the concurrence of a\ntwo-qubit system in the non-Markovian setting. A quantum master equation is\nderived which is solved in the eigen basis of the system Hamiltonian for X-type\ninitial states. A closed formula for time evolution of concurrence is presented\nfor a pure state. It is shown that under the influence of dissipation that\nnon-zero entanglement is created in unentangled two qubit states which decay in\nthe same way as pure entangled states. We also show that under real\ncircumstances, the decay rate of concurrence is strongly modified by the\nnon-Markovinity of the evolution.\n", "  In this paper we perform the reconstruction scheme of the gravitational\naction within $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity, where $T$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ denote\nthe torsion scalar and the trace of the energy momentum tensor, respectively.\nWe particularly focus our attention on the case where the algebraic function\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ is decomposed as a sum of two functions $f_1(T)$ and\n$f_2(\\mathcal{T})$, i.e, $f(T,\\mathcal{T})=f_{1}(T)+f_{2}(\\mathcal{T})$. The\ndescription is essentially based on the scale factor and then, we consider two\ninteresting and realistic expressions of this parameter and reconstruct the\naction corresponding to each phase of the universe. Our results show that some\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ models are able to describe the evolution of the universe\nfrom the inflation phase to the late time dark energy dominated phase.\n", "  Several concepts now exist for small, space-based missions to directly\ncharacterize exoplanets in reflected light. Here, we develop an instrument\nnoise model suitable for studying the spectral characterization potential of a\ncoronagraph-equipped, space-based telescope. We adopt a baseline set of\ntelescope and instrument parameters appropriate for near-future planned\nmissions like WFIRST-AFTA, including a 2 m diameter primary aperture, an\noperational wavelength range of 0.4-1.0 um, and an instrument spectral\nresolution of 70, and apply our baseline model to a variety of spectral models\nof different planet types, including Earth twins, Jupiter twins, and warm and\ncool Jupiters and Neptunes. With our exoplanet spectral models, we explore\nwavelength-dependent planet-star flux ratios for main sequence stars of various\neffective temperatures, and discuss how coronagraph inner and outer working\nangle constraints will influence the potential to study different types of\nplanets. For planets most favorable to spectroscopic characterization, we study\nthe integration times required to achieve moderate signal-to-noise ratio\nspectra. We also explore the sensitivity of the integration times required to\neither detect the bottom or presence of key absorption bands to coronagraph raw\ncontrast performance, exozodiacal light levels, and the distance to the\nplanetary system. Decreasing detector quantum efficiency at longer visible\nwavelengths makes the detection of water vapor in the atmospheres of Earth-like\nplanets extremely challenging, and also hinders detections of the 0.89 um\nmethane band. Additionally, most modeled observations have noise dominated by\ndark current, indicating that improving CCD performance could substantially\ndrive down requisite integration times. Finally, we briefly discuss the\nextension of our models to a more distant future Large UV-Optical-InfraRed\n(LUVOIR) mission.\n", "  Time-periodic driving provides a promising route to engineer non-trivial\nstates in quantum many-body systems. However, while it has been shown that the\ndynamics of integrable systems can synchronize with the driving into a\nnon-trivial periodic motion, generic non-integrable systems are expected to\nheat up until they display a trivial infinite-temperature behavior. In this\npaper we show that a quasi-periodic time evolution over many periods can also\nemerge in systems with weak integrability breaking, with a clear separation of\nthe timescales for synchronization and the eventual approach of the\ninfinite-temperature state. This behavior is the analogue of prethermalization\nin quenched systems. The synchronized state can be described using a\nmacroscopic number of approximate constants of motion. We corroborate these\nfindings with numerical simulations for the driven Hubbard model.\n", "  We present ground-based and Swift photometric and spectroscopic observations\nof the candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li, found at the center\nof PGC 043234 ($d\\simeq90$ Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae\n(ASAS-SN). The source had a peak bolometric luminosity of $L\\simeq10^{44}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$ and a total integrated energy of $E\\simeq7\\times10^{50}$ ergs radiated\nover the $\\sim6$ months of observations presented. The UV/optical emission of\nthe source is well-fit by a blackbody with roughly constant temperature of\n$T\\sim35,000$ K, while the luminosity declines by roughly a factor of 16 over\nthis time. The optical/UV luminosity decline is broadly consistent with an\nexponential decline, $L\\propto e^{-t/t_0}$, with $t_0\\simeq60$ days.\nASASSN-14li also exhibits soft X-ray emission comparable in luminosity to the\noptical and UV emission but declining at a slower rate, and the X-ray emission\nnow dominates. Spectra of the source show broad Balmer and helium lines in\nemission as well as strong blue continuum emission at all epochs. We use the\ndiscoveries of ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae to estimate the TDE rate implied by\nASAS-SN, finding an average rate of $r \\simeq 4.1 \\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$\nper galaxy with a 90% confidence interval of $(2.2 - 17.0) \\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ per galaxy. ASAS-SN found roughly 1 TDE for every 70 Type Ia\nsupernovae in 2014, a rate that is much higher than that of other surveys.\n", "  As a result of the quantum, wave-like nature of the physical world, a\nharmonic oscillator can never be completely at rest. Even in the quantum ground\nstate, its position will always have fluctuations, called the zero-point\nmotion. Although the zero-point fluctuations are unavoidable, they can be\nmanipulated. In this work, using microwave frequency radiation pressure, we\nboth prepare a micron-scale mechanical system in a state near the quantum\nground state and then manipulate its thermal fluctuations to produce a\nstationary, quadrature-squeezed state. We deduce that the variance of one\nmotional quadrature is 0.80 times the zero-point level, or 1 dB of\nsub-zero-point squeezing. This work is relevant to the quantum engineering of\nstates of matter at large length scales, the study of decoherence of large\nquantum systems, and for the realization of ultra-sensitive sensing of force\nand motion.\n", "  We present a definition of unsigned magnification in gravitational lensing\nvalid on arbitrary convex normal neighborhoods of time oriented Lorentzian\nmanifolds. This definition is a function defined at any two points along a null\ngeodesic that lie in a convex normal neighborhood, and foregoes the usual\nnotions of lens and source planes in gravitational lensing. Rather, it makes\nessential use of the van Vleck determinant, which we present via the\nexponential map, and Etherington's definition of luminosity distance for\narbitrary spacetimes. We then specialize our definition to spacetimes, like\nSchwarzschild's, in which the lens is compact and isolated, and show that our\nmagnification function is monotonically increasing along any geodesic contained\nwithin a convex normal neighborhood.\n", "  In this article, we give a comprehensive review of recent progress in\nresearch on symmetry-protected topological superfluids and topological\ncrystalline superconductors, and their physical consequences such as helical\nand chiral Majorana fermions. We start this review article with the minimal\nmodel that captures the essence of such topological materials. The central part\nof this article is devoted to the superfluid $^3$He, which serves as a rich\nrepository of novel topological quantum phenomena originating from the\nintertwining of symmetries and topologies. In particular, it is emphasized that\nthe quantum fluid confined to nanofabricated geometries possesses multiple\nsuperfluid phases composed of the symmetry-protected topological superfluid\nB-phase, the A-phase as a Weyl superfluid, the nodal planar and polar phases,\nand the crystalline ordered stripe phase. All these phases generate noteworthy\ntopological phenomena, including topological phase transitions concomitant with\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, Majorana fermions, Weyl superfluidity, emergent\nsupersymmetry, spontaneous edge mass and spin currents, topological Fermi arcs,\nand exotic quasiparticles bound to topological defects. In relation to the mass\ncurrent carried by gapless edge states, we also briefly review a longstanding\nissue on the intrinsic angular momentum paradox in $^3$He-A. Moreover, we share\nthe current status of our knowledge on the topological aspects of\nunconventional superconductors, such as the heavy-fermion superconductor\nUPt$_3$ and superconducting doped topological insulators, in connection with\nthe superfluid $^3$He.\n", "  Disruptions in the normal rhythmic functioning of the heart, termed as\narrhythmia, often result from qualitative changes in the excitation dynamics of\nthe organ. The transitions between different types of arrhythmia are\naccompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity\nthat can be measured by observing the time-intervals between successive\nexcitations of different regions of the cardiac tissue. Using biophysically\ndetailed models of cardiac activity we show that the distribution of these\ntime-intervals exhibit a systematic change in their skewness during such\ndynamical transitions. Further, the leading digits of the normalized intervals\nappear to fit Benford's law better at these transition points. This raises the\npossibility of using these observations to design a clinical indicator for\nidentifying changes in the nature of arrhythmia. More importantly, our results\nreveal an intriguing relation between the changing skewness of a distribution\nand its agreement with Benford's law, both of which have been independently\nproposed earlier as indicators of regime shift in dynamical systems.\n", "  We compute the one-loop photon contribution to the graviton self-energy on a\nde Sitter background and use it to solve the linearized Einstein equation for a\npoint mass. Our results show that a comoving observer sees a logarithmic\nspatial running Newton's constant. Equivalently, a static observer reports a\nsecular suppression of the Newtonian potential.\n", "  Nonlocality, one of the most remarkable aspects of quantum mechanics, is\nclosely related to Bayesian game theory. Quantum mechanics can offer advantages\nto some Bayesian games, if the payoff functions are related to Bell\ninequalities in some way. Most of these Bayesian games that have been discussed\nare common interest games. Recently the first conflicting interest Bayesian\ngame is proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401 (2015). In the present paper\nwe present three new conflicting interest Bayesian games where quantum\nmechanics offers advantages. The first game is linked with Cereceda\ninequalities, the second game is linked with a generalized Bell inequality with\n3 possible measurement outcomes, and the third game is linked with a\ngeneralized Bell inequality with 3 possible measurement settings.\n", "  We study the central hyperplane arrangement whose hyperplanes are the\nvanishing loci of the weights of the first and the second fundamental\nrepresentations of $\\mathfrak{gl}_n$ restricted to the dual fundamental Weyl\nchamber. We obtain generating functions that count flats and faces of a given\ndimension. This counting is interpreted in physics as the enumeration of the\nphases of the Coulomb and mixed Coulomb-Higgs branches of a five dimensional\ngauge theory with 8 supercharges in presence of hypermultiplets transforming in\nthe fundamental and antisymmetric representation of a U(n) gauge group as\ndescribed by the Intriligator-Morrison-Seiberg superpotential.\n", "  We study ground- and excited-state properties of all sd-shell nuclei with\nneutron and proton numbers 8 <= N,Z <= 20, based on a set of low-resolution\ntwo- and three-nucleon interactions that predict realistic saturation\nproperties of nuclear matter. We focus on estimating the theoretical\nuncertainties due to variation of the resolution scale, the low-energy\ncouplings, as well as from the many-body method. The experimental two-neutron\nand two-proton separation energies are reasonably well reproduced, with an\nuncertainty range of about 5 MeV. The first excited 2+ energies also show\noverall agreement, with a more narrow uncertainty range of about 500 keV. In\nmost cases, this range is dominated by the uncertainties in the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We revisit the H\\'ebraud-Lequeux (HL) model for the rheology of jammed\nmaterials and argue that a possibly important time scale is missing from HL's\ninitial specification. We show that our generalization of the HL model\nundergoes interesting oscillating instabilities for a wide range of parameters,\nwhich lead to intermittent, stick-slip flows under constant shear rate. The\ninstability we find is akin to the synchronization transition of coupled\nelements that arises in many different contexts (neurons, fireflies, financial\nbankruptcies, etc.). We hope that our scenario could shed light on the commonly\nobserved intermittent, serrated flows of glassy materials under shear.\n", "  We report strongly enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Co\nfilms by graphene coating from both first-principles and experiments. Our\ncalculations show that graphene can dramatically boost the surface anisotropy\nof Co films up to twice the value of its pristine counterpart and can extend\nthe out-of-plane effective anisotropy up to unprecedented thickness of 25~\\AA.\nThese findings are supported by our experiments on graphene coating on Co films\ngrown on Ir substrate. Furthermore, we report layer-resolved and\norbital-hybridization-resolved anisotropy analysis which help understanding the\nphysical mechanisms of PMA and more practically can help design structures with\ngiant PMA. As an example, we propose super-exchange stabilized Co-graphene\nheterostructures with a robust out-of-plane constant effective PMA and linearly\nincreasing interfacial anisotropy as a function of film thickness. These\nfindings point towards possibilities to engineer graphene/ferromagnetic metal\nheterostructures with giant magnetic anisotropy more than 20 times larger\ncompared to conventional multilayers, which constitutes a hallmark for future\ngraphene and traditional spintronic technologies.\n", "  We present a variational function that targets excited states directly based\non their position in the energy spectrum, along with a Monte Carlo method for\nits evaluation and minimization whose cost scales polynomially for a wide class\nof approximate wave functions. Being compatible with both real and Fock space\nand open and periodic boundary conditions, the method has the potential to\nimpact many areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science. Initial tests\non doubly excited states show that using this method, the Hilbert space Jastrow\nantisymmetric geminal power ansatz can deliver order-of-magnitude improvements\nin accuracy relative to equation of motion coupled cluster theory, while a very\nmodest real space multi-Slater Jastrow expansion can achieve accuracies within\n0.1 eV of the best theoretical benchmarks for the carbon dimer.\n", "  We propose a generalization of the supersymmetric representation of spins\nwith symplectic symmetry, generalizing the rotation group of the spin from\nSU(2) to SP(N). As a test application of this new representation, we consider\ntwo toy models involving a competition of the Kondo effect and\nantiferromagnetism: a two-impurity model and a frustrated three-impurity model.\nExploring an ensemble of L-shaped representations with a fixed number of boxes\nin their respective Young tableaux, we allow the system to choose which\nrepresentation is energetically more favorable in each region in parameter\nspace. We discuss how the features of these preliminary applications can\ngeneralize to Kondo lattice models.\n", "  The acoustic emission from breaking a bamboo chopstick or a bundle of\nspaghetti is found to exhibit similar behavior as the famous seismic laws of\nGutenberg-Richter, Omori, and Bath. By use of a force-sensing detector, we\nestablish a positive correlation between the statistics of sound intensity and\nthe magnitude of tremor. We also manage to derive these laws analytically\nwithout invoking the concept of phase transition, self-organized criticality,\nor fractal. Our model is deterministic and relies on the existence of a\nstructured cross section, either fibrous or layered. This success at explaining\nthe power-law behavior supports the proposal that geometry is sometimes more\nimportant than mechanics.\n", "  We measure the dissipation and frequency shift of a magnetically coupled\ncantilever in the vicinity of a silicon chip, down to $25$ mK. The dissipation\nand frequency shift originates from the interaction with the unpaired\nelectrons, associated with the dangling bonds in the native oxide layer of the\nsilicon, which form a two dimensional system of electron spins. We approach the\nsample with a $3.43$ $\\mu$m-diameter magnetic particle attached to an ultrasoft\ncantilever, and measure the frequency shift and quality factor as a function of\ntemperature and the distance. Using a recent theoretical analysis [J. M. de\nVoogd et al., arXiv:1508.07972 (2015)] of the dynamics of a system consisting\nof a spin and a magnetic resonator, we are able to fit the data and extract the\nrelaxation time $T_1=0.39\\pm0.08$ ms and spin density $\\sigma=0.14\\pm0.01$\nspins per nm$^2$. Our analysis shows that at temperatures $\\leq500$ mK magnetic\ndissipation is an important source of non-contact friction.\n", "  With the improvement of the experimental techniques, many new phenomena where\nthe photon degrees of freedom are involved have been discovered. Typical\nexamples are the exciton-polariton quasi-particles, excitons strongly coupled\nto photons. A correct description of these systems requires a full account of\nthe photon's dynamics, including the vector gauge degrees of freedom. In order\nto include this contribution in \\emph{ab initio} many-body perturbation\ntheories, here we present a generalization of the Hedin equations, originally\nderived for a many electron system with Coulomb interaction. These equations\nare now derived in order to take into account the strong coupling physics of\nthe electrons and the \\textit{transverse} photon's degrees of freedom.\n", "  This paper provides a review and fundamental physical interpretation for the\neffective densities and moduli of acoustic metamaterials. We introduce the\nterminology of hidden force and hidden source of volume: the effective density\nor modulus is negative when the hidden force or source of volume is larger\nthan, and operates in antiphase to, respectively, the force or volume change\nthat would be obtained in their absence. We demonstrate this ansatz for some\nestablished acoustic metamaterials with elements based on membranes, Helmholtz\nresonators, springs and masses. The hidden force for membrane-based acoustic\nmetamaterials, for instance, is the force from the membrane tension. The hidden\nsource for a Helmholtz-resonator-based metamaterial is the extra air volume\ninjected from the resonator cavity. We also explain the analogous concepts for\npure mass-and-spring systems, in which case hidden forces can arise from masses\nand springs fixed inside other masses, whereas hidden sources - more aptly\ntermed hidden expanders of displacement in this case - can arise from light\nrigid trusses coupled to extra degrees of freedom for mechanical motion such as\nthe case of coupling to masses that move at right angles to the\nwave-propagation direction. This overall picture provides a powerful tool for\nconceptual understanding and design of new acoustic metamaterials, and avoids\ncommon pitfalls involved in determining the effective parameters of such\nmaterials.\n", "  Exact self-consistent soliton dynamics based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\n(BdG) formalism in unconventional Fermi superfluids/superconductors possessing\nan $SU(d)$-symmetric two-body interaction is presented. The derivation is based\non the ansatz having the similar form as the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equation\nin the inverse scattering theory. Our solutions can be regarded as a\nmulticomponent generalization of the solutions recently derived by Dunne and\nThies [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 121602 (2013)]. We also propose superpositions of\noccupation states, which make it possible to realize various filling rates even\nin one-flavor systems, and include Dirac and Majorana fermions. The soliton\nsolutions in the $ d=2 $ systems, which describe the mixture of singlet\n$s$-wave and triplet $p$-wave superfluids, exhibit a variety of phenomena such\nas SU(2)-DHN breathers, Majorana triplet states, $s$-$p$ mixed dynamics, and so\non. These solutions are illustrated by animations, where order parameters are\nvisualized by spherical harmonic functions. The full formulation of the BdG\ntheory is also supported, and the double-counting problem of BdG eigenstates\nand $N$-flavor generalization are discussed.\n", "  The adjoint Fokker-Planck equation method is applied to study the runaway\nprobability function and the expected slowing-down time for highly relativistic\nrunaway electrons, including the loss of energy due to synchrotron radiation.\nIn direct correspondence to Monte Carlo simulation methods, the runaway\nprobability function has a smooth transition across the runaway separatrix,\nwhich can be attributed to effect of the pitch angle scattering term in the\nkinetic equation. However, for the same numerical accuracy, the adjoint method\nis more efficient than the Monte Carlo method. The expected slowing-down time\ngives a novel method to estimate the runaway current decay time in experiments.\nA new result from this work is that the decay rate of high energyelectrons is\nvery slow when E is close to the critical electric field. This effect\ncontributes further to a hysteresis previously found in the runaway electron\npopulation.\n", "  We suggest a natural split mechanism for sfermions based on $N$=2\nsupersymmetry (SUSY). $N$=2 SUSY protects a sfermion in an $N$=2 multiplet from\ngaining weight by SUSY breaking. Therefore, if partly $N$=2 SUSY is effectively\nobtained, a split spectrum can be realized naturally. As an example of the\nnatural split mechanism, we build a gauge-mediated SUSY breaking-like model\nassuming $N$=2 SUSY is partly broken in a UV theory. The model explains the\nHiggs boson mass and the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment within\n$1~\\sigma$ level with a splitting sfermion spectrum. The model has seven light\nsparticles described by three free parameters and predicts a new chiral\nmultiplet, sb: the $N$=2 partner of the ${\\rm U(1)_Y}$ vector multiplet. The\nbini, the fermion component of the sb, weighs MeVs. We mention the experimental\nand the cosmological aspects of the model.\n", "  Water activity and its relationship with interactions stabilising lamellar\nstacks of mixed lipid bilayers in their fluid state are investigated by means\nof osmotic pressure measurements coupled with small-angle x-ray scattering. The\n(electrically-neutral) bilayers are composed of a mixture in various\nproportions of lecithin, a zwitterionic phospholipid, and Simulsol, a non-ionic\ncosurfactant with an ethoxylated polar head. For highly dehydrated samples the\nosmotic pressure profile always exhibits the \"classical\" exponential decay as\nhydration increases but, depending on Simulsol to lecithin ratio, it becomes\neither of the \"bound\" or \"unbound\" types for more water-swollen systems. A\nsimple thermodynamic model is used for interpreting the results without\nresorting to the celebrated but elusive \"hydration forces\"\n", "  The 16 Cyg system is composed of two solar analogs with similar masses and\nages. A red dwarf is in orbit around 16 Cyg A whereas 16 Cyg B hosts a giant\nplanet. The abundances of heavy elements are similar in the two stars but\nlithium is much more depleted in 16 Cyg B that in 16 Cyg A, by a factor of at\nleast 4.7. The interest of studying the 16 Cyg system is that the two star have\nthe same age and the same initial composition. The presently observed\ndifferences must be due to their different evolution, related to the fact that\none of them hosts a planet contrary to the other one. We computed models of the\ntwo stars which precisely fit the observed seismic frequencies. We used the\nToulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC) that includes complete atomic diffusion\n(including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface\nabundances with the spectroscopic observations and confirmed that another\nmixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced\nfingering convection. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the\nmetal abundances but leads to lithium destruction which depends on the accreted\nmass. A fraction of earth mass is enough to explain the lithium surface\nabundances of 16 Cyg B. We also checked the beryllium abundances. In the case\nof accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements\ndo not remain in the outer convective zones but they are mixed downwards by\nfingering convection induced by the unstable $\\mu$-gradient. Depending on the\naccreted mass, this mixing process may transport lithium down to its nuclear\ndestruction layers and lead to an extra lithium depletion at the surface. A\nfraction of earth mass is enough to explain a lithium ratio of 4.7 in the 16\nCyg system. In this case beryllium is not destroyed. Such a process may be\nfrequent in planet host stars and should be studied in other cases in the\nfuture.\n", "  Recent Lattice QCD (LQCD) studies suggest that there are missing resonances\nin the strange sector of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. By adopting the\ncontinuous Hagedorn mass spectrum, we present how different medium compositions\ninfluence the HRG predictions of conserved charge fluctuations. It is shown\nthat missing strange resonances may be partially accounted for by applying the\nHagedorn mass spectrum extracted from experimentally established hadrons. On\nthe other hand, the strange-baryonic spectra, extracted from LQCD results for\nfluctuations, are found to be consistent with the unconfirmed states in the\nParticle Data Group (PDG) database, whilst the strange-mesonic spectrum points\ntowards yet undiscovered states in the intermediate mass region.\n", "  We report on the strain-induced switch between ferromagnetic (FM) and\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) orderings in 1T-CrX2 (X = Se, Te) monolayers based on\nthe first-principles calculations. The CrSe2 and CrTe2 monolayers without\nstrains are found to be AFM and FM, respectively. Under the biaxial tensile\nstrain, the CrSe2 monolayer tends to be FM when the strain is larger than 2%.\nThe FM state is further stabilized when the strain is increased. Moreover, the\nCrSe2 monolayer changes to be half-metallic when the tensile strain is larger\nthan 10%. While for the CrTe2 monolayer, the critical strain at which the\ntransition between the FM and AFM states occurs is compressive, of -1%.\nRelatively small tensile strains of 4% and 2%, respectively, can enhance the\nCurie temperature of CrSe2 and CrTe2 monolayers above the room temperature. The\nstrain-induced switch between the FM and AFM states in CrSe2 (CrTe2) monolayer\ncan be understood by the competition between the AFM Cr-Cr direct exchange and\nFM Cr-Se(Te)-Cr superexchange interactions. The tunable and attractive magnetic\nand electronic properties controlled by the flexible strain are desirable for\nthe future nanoelectronic applications.\n", "  We shall discuss cosmological models in extended theories of gravitation. We\nshall define a surface, called the model surface, in the space of observable\nparameters which characterises families of theories. We also show how this\nsurface can be used to compare with observations. The model surface can\npotentially be used to falsify whole families of models instead reasoning on a\nsingle model basis as it is usually done by best fit arguments with\nobservations.\n", "  The amorphous phases of antimony oxide at three different oxidation levels\nhave been investigated by {\\it ab initio} molecular-dynamics calculations using\na simulated `melt-quench' approach. The atomic and electronic structure of the\namorphous phases are analyzed and compared to their crystalline counterparts.\nThe amorphous structure of the trioxide ({\\it a\\,}--Sb$_2$O$_3$) resembles the\n$\\beta$-phase of the crystalline form (valentinite), in agreement with previous\nobservations. In the relaxed athermal structure, however, more\nsenarmontite-like structural features are apparent. The phase diagram of the\namorphous phases with respect to oxygen chemical potential has been calculated\nwithin the framework of {\\it ab initio} thermodynamics. At elevated oxidation\nlevels, the resulting tetraoxide and pentoxide materials show distinct\nvariation in electronic structure compared to the trioxide, with the electronic\ndensity of states indicating a narrowing of the electronic gap with increasing\noxidation level.\n", "  We present a systematic search for changing-look quasars based on repeat\nphotometry from SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, along with repeat spectra from SDSS and\nSDSS-III BOSS. Objects with large, |\\Delta g|>1 mag photometric variations in\ntheir light curves are selected as candidates to look for changes in broad\nemission line (BEL) features. Out of a sample of 1011 objects that satisfy our\nselection criteria and have more than one epoch of spectroscopy, we find 10\nexamples of quasars that have variable and/or \"changing-look\" BEL features.\nFour of our objects have emerging BELs; five have disappearing BELs, and one\nobject shows tentative evidence for having both emerging and disappearing BELs.\nWith redshifts in the range 0.20 < z < 0.63, this sample includes the\nhighest-redshift changing-look quasars discovered to date. We highlight the\nquasar J102152.34+464515.6 at z = 0.204. Here, not only have the Balmer\nemission lines strongly diminished in prominence, including H$\\beta$ all but\ndisappearing, but the blue continuum $f_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{1/3}$ typical of an\nAGN is also significantly diminished in the second epoch of spectroscopy. Using\nour selection criteria, we estimate that >15% of strongly variable luminous\nquasars display changing-look BEL features on rest-frame timescales of 8 to 10\nyears. Plausible timescales for variable dust extinction are factors of 2-10\ntoo long to explain the dimming and brightening in these sources, and simple\ndust reddening models cannot reproduce the BEL changes. On the other hand, an\nadvancement such as disk reprocessing is needed if the observed variations are\ndue to accretion rate changes.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations have been probed during the last few decades using\nmultiple neutrino sources and experimental set-ups. In the recent years, very\nlarge volume neutrino telescopes have started contributing to the field. First\nANTARES and then IceCube have relied on large and sparsely instrumented volumes\nto observe atmospheric neutrinos for combinations of baselines and energies\ninaccessible to other experiments. Using this advantage, the latest result from\nIceCube starts approaching the precision of other established technologies, and\nis paving the way for future detectors, such as ORCA and PINGU. These new\nprojects seek to provide better measurements of neutrino oscillation\nparameters, and eventually determine the neutrino mass ordering. The results\nfrom running experiments and the potential from proposed projects are discussed\nin this review, emphasizing the experimental challenges involved in the\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present the third-order analytic solution of the matter density\nfluctuation in the proper-time hypersurface of nonrelativistic matter flows by\nsolving the nonlinear general relativistic equations. The proper-time\nhypersurface provides a coordinate system that a local observer can set up\nwithout knowledge beyond its neighborhood, along with physical connections to\nthe local Newtonian descriptions in the relativistic context. The initial\ncondition of our analytic solution is set up by the curvature perturbation in\nthe comoving gauge, clarifying its impact on the nonlinear evolution. We\ncompute the effective non-Gaussian parameters due to the nonlinearity in the\nrelativistic equations. With proper coordinate rescaling, we show that the\nequivalence principle is respected and the relativistic effect vanishes in the\nlarge-scale limit.\n", "  Scattering, during interplanetary transport in large, \"gradual\" solar\nenergetic-particle (SEP) events, can cause element abundance enhancements or\nsuppressions that depend upon the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q of the ions as an\nincreasing function early in events and a decreasing function of the residual\nscattered ions later. Since the Q values for the ions depend upon the source\nplasma temperature T, best fits, assuming a primarily power-law dependence of\nenhancements vs. A/Q, provide a fundamentally new method to determine the most\nprobable value of T for these events in the region of 3-10 MeV/amu. Complicated\nvariations in the grouping of element enhancements or suppressions match\nsimilar variations in A/Q at the best-fit temperature. We find that fits to the\ntimes of increasing and decreasing powers give similar values of T, most\ncommonly in the range of 0.8-1.6 MK for 69% of the events, consistent with the\nacceleration of ambient coronal plasma by shock waves driven out from the Sun\nby coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, 24% of the SEP events studied showed\nplasma of 2.5-3.2 MK, typical of that previously determined for the smaller\nimpulsive SEP events; these particles may be reaccelerated preferentially by\nquasi-perpendicular shock waves that require a high injection threshold that\nthe impulsive-event ions exceed or simply by high intensities of impulsive\nsuprathermal ions at the shock. The source-temperature distribution of ten\nhigher-energy ground-level events (GLEs) in the sample is similar to that of\nthe other gradual events. Some events show evidence that a portion of the ions\nhave been further stripped of electrons; such events are smaller and tend to\ncluster late in the solar cycle.\n", "  A novel method and nanodevice are introduced that allows to rotate the single\nelectron spin confined in a gated electrostatic InSb nanowire quantum dot.\nProposed method does not require application of any (oscillating or static)\nexternal magnetic fields. Our proposal instead employs spatial and time\nmodulation of confining potential induced by electric gates, which, in turn\nleads to oscillating Rashba type spin-orbit coupling. Moving electron back and\nforth in such a variable Rashba field allows for realization of spin rotations\naround two different axes separately without using an external magnetic field.\nThe results are supported by realistic three-dimensional time dependent\nPoisson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger calculations for systems and material parameters\ncorresponding to experimentally accessible structures.\n", "  While the mammalian- and the avian inner ears have well defined tonotopic\norganizations as well as hair cells specialized for motile and sensing roles,\nthe structural organization of the avian ear is different from its mammalian\ncochlear counterpart. Presumably this difference stems from the difference in\nthe way motile hair cells function. Short hair cells, whose role is considered\nanalogous to mammalian outer hair cells, presumably depends on their hair\nbundles, and not motility of their cell body, in providing the motile elements\nof the cochlear amplifier. This report focuses on the role of the avian\ntectorial membrane, specifically by addressing the question, \"Why is the avian\ntectorial membrane tapered from the neural to the abneural direction?\"\n", "  The gravitational Gauss law requires any addition of energy to be accompanied\nby the addition of gravitational flux. The possible configurations of this flux\nfor a given source may be called gravitational hair, and several recent works\ndiscuss gravitational observables (`gravitational Wilson lines') which create\nthis hair in highly-collimated `combed' configurations. We construct and\nanalyze time-symmetric classical solutions of 2+1 Einstein-Hilbert gravity such\nas might be created by smeared versions of such operators. We focus on the\nAdS$_3$ case, where this hair is characterized by the profile of the boundary\nstress tensor; the desired solutions are those where the boundary stress tensor\nat initial time $t=0$ agrees precisely with its vacuum value outside an angular\ninterval $[-\\alpha,\\alpha]$. At linear order in source strength the energy is\nindependent of the combing parameter $\\alpha$, but non-linearities cause the\nfull energy to diverge as $\\alpha \\to 0$. In general, solutions with combed\ngravitational flux also suffer from what we call displacement from their naive\nlocation. For weak sources and large $\\alpha$ one may set the displacement to\nzero by further increasing the energy, though for strong sources and small\n$\\alpha$ we find no preferred notion of a zero-displacement solution. In the\nlatter case we conclude that naively-expected gravitational Wilson lines do not\nexist. In the zero-displacement case, taking the AdS scale $\\ell$ to infinity\ngives finite-energy flux-directed solutions that may be called asymptotically\nflat.\n", "  We study the possibility that partonic matter produced at early stage of\nultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is out of chemical equilibrium. It is\nassumed that initially this matter is mostly composed of gluons, but quarks and\nantiquarks are produced at later times. The dynamical evolution of partonic\nsystem is described by the Bjorken-like ideal hydrodynamics with a time\ndependent quark fugacity. The results of this model are compared with those\nobtained by assuming the complete chemical equilibrium of partons already at\nthe initial stage. It is shown that in a chemically non-equilibrium scenario\nthe entropy gradually increases, and about 25% of the total final entropy is\ngenerated during the hydrodynamic evolution of deconfined matter. We argue that\nthe (anti)quark suppression included in this approach may be responsible for\nreduced (anti)baryon to meson ratios observed in heavy-ion collisions at LHC\nenergies.\n", "  Systematic engineering of atomic-scale low-dimensional defects in\ntwo-dimensional nanomaterials is a promising way to modulate the electronic\nproperties of these nanomaterials. Defects at interfaces such as grain\nboundaries and line defects can often be detrimental to technologically\nimportant nanodevice operations and thus a fundamental understanding of how\nsuch one-dimensional defects may have an influence on its physio-chemical\nproperties is pivotal to optimizing their device performance. Of late,\ntwo-dimensional phosphorene has attracted much attention due to its high\ncarrier mobility and good mechanical flexibility. In this study, using\ndensity-functional theory, we investigate the temperature-dependent energetics\nand electronic structure of a single-layered phosphorene with various fault\nline defects. We have generated different line defect models based on a fault\nmethod, rather than the conventional rotation method. This has allowed us to\nstudy and identify new low-energy line defects, and we show how these\nlow-energy line defects could well modulate the electronic band gap energies of\nsingle-layered two-dimensional phosphorene -- offering a range of metallic to\nsemiconducting properties in these newly proposed low-energy line defects in\nphosphorene.\n", "  We theoretically study the driven-dissipative Harper-Hofstadter model on a 2D\nsquare lattice in the presence of a weak harmonic trap. Without pumping and\nloss, the eigenstates of this system can be understood, in certain limits, as\nmomentum-space toroidal Landau levels, where the Berry curvature, a geometrical\nproperty of an energy band, acts like a momentum-space magnetic field. We show\nthat key features of these eigenstates can be observed in the steady-state of\nthe driven-dissipative system under a monochromatic coherent drive, and present\na realistic proposal for an optical experiment using state-of-the-art coupled\ncavity arrays. We discuss how such spectroscopic measurements may be used to\nprobe effects associated both with the off-diagonal elements of the\nmatrix-valued Berry connection and with the synthetic magnetic gauge.\n", "  The cross-section for the production of a single top quark in association\nwith a $W$ boson in proton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}= 8$ TeV is measured.\nThe dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$,\ncollected by the ATLAS detector in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\nEvents containing two leptons and one central $b$-jet are selected. The $Wt$\nsignal is separated from the backgrounds using boosted decision trees, each of\nwhich combines a number of discriminating variables into one classifier.\nProduction of $Wt$ events is observed with a significance of $7.7 \\sigma$. The\ncross-section is extracted in a profile likelihood fit to the classifier output\ndistributions. The $Wt$ cross-section, inclusive of decay modes, is measured to\nbe $23.0 \\pm 1.3$(stat.)$^{+3.2}_{-3.5}$(syst.)$\\pm 1.1$(lumi.) pb. The\nmeasured cross-section is used to extract a value for the CKM matrix element\n$|V_{tb}|$ of $1.01 \\pm 0.10$ and a lower limit of 0.80 at the 95\\% confidence\nlevel. The cross-section for the production of a top quark and a $W$ boson is\nalso measured in a fiducial acceptance requiring two leptons with\n$p_{\\textrm{T}}>25$ GeV and $|\\eta|<2.5$, one jet with $p_{\\textrm{T}}>20$ GeV\nand $|\\eta|<2.5$, and $E_{\\textrm{T}}^{\\textrm{miss}}>20$ GeV, including both\n$Wt$ and top-quark pair events as signal. The measured value of the fiducial\ncross-section is $0.85 \\pm 0.01$(stat.)$^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$(syst.)$\\pm\n0.03$(lumi.) pb.\n", "  We present a study of the physical properties of the disc and tail of\nESO137-001, a galaxy suffering from extreme ram-pressure stripping during its\ninfall into the Norma cluster. With sensitive and spatially-resolved MUSE\nspectroscopy, we analyse the emission line diagnostics in the tail of\nESO137-001, finding high values of [NII]/H$\\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\\alpha$ that are\nsuggestive of the presence of shocks in turbulent gas. However, the observed\nline ratios are not as strong as commonly seen in pure shock heating models,\nsuggesting that other emission mechanisms may contribute to the observed\nemission. Indeed, part of the observed emission, particularly at close\nseparations from the galaxy disc, may originate from recombination of\nphotoionised gas stripped from the main body of ESO137-001. We also identify a\nlarge number of bright compact knots within in the tail, with line ratios\ncharacteristic of HII regions. These HII regions, despite residing in a\nstripped gas tail, have quite typical line ratios, densities, temperatures, and\nmetallicity ($\\sim0.7$ solar). The majority of these HII regions are embedded\nwithin diffuse gas from the tail, which is dynamically cool ($\\sigma \\sim\n25-50\\ \\rm{km\\ s^{-1}}$ ). This fact, together with a lack of appreciable\ngradients in age and metallicity, suggests that these HII regions formed in\nsitu. While our analysis represents a first attempt to characterise the rich\nphysics of the ESO137-001 tail, future work is needed to address the importance\nof other mechanisms, such as thermal conduction and magneto hydrodynamic waves,\nin powering the emission in the tail.\n", "  We report observations of the formation and subsequent decay of a vortex\nlattice in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a hybrid optical-magnetic\ntrap. Vortices are induced by rotating the anharmonic magnetic potential that\nprovides confinement in the horizontal plane. We present simple numerical\ntechniques based on image analysis to detect vortices and analyze their\ndistributions. We use these methods to quantify the amount of order present in\nthe vortex distribution as it transitions from a disordered array to the\nenergetically favorable ordered lattice.\n", "  We systematically study the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in the\npresence of a pure electric field in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at\nfinite temperature and baryon chemical potential. In addition, we also study\nthe effect of the chiral phase transition on the charged pair production due to\nthe Schwinger mechanism. For these purposes, a general formalism for parallel\nelectric and magnetic fields is developed at finite temperature and chemical\npotential for the first time. In the pure electric field limit $B\\rightarrow0$,\nwe compute the order parameter, the transverse-to-longitudinal ratio of the\nGoldstone mode velocities, and the Schwinger pair production rate as functions\nof the electric field. The inverse catalysis effect of the electric field to\nchiral symmetry breaking is recovered. And the Goldstone mode is find to\ndisperse anisotropically such that the transverse velocity is always smaller\nthan the longitudinal one, especially at nonzero temperature and baryon\nchemical potential. As expected, the quark-pair production rate is greatly\nenhanced by the chiral symmetry restoration.\n", "  Many of the observed species interactions embedded in ecological communities\nare not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes that are observed\nalong with abiotic and biotic variations. While work has been done describing\nand quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for\nspecies coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of\nspecies composition impacts the likelihood of persistence of the predator-prey\ncommunity in the highly seasonal Bialowieza Primeval Forest (NE Poland), and\nthe extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet)\nmodulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent\ndevelopments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We\nfind that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of\ncommunity persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate\nthat the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the\nlikelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We\nfind that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of\nindividual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in\npersistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results\nprovide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions, and\nsuggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level\nof variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response\nof species to environmental pressures.\n", "  Filaments are ubiquitous in the universe. Recent observations have revealed\nthat stars and star clusters form preferentially along dense filaments.\nUnderstanding the formation and properties of filaments is therefore a crucial\nstep in understanding star formation. Here we perform three-dimensional\nhigh-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations that follow the evolution of\nmolecular clouds and the formation of filaments and stars. We apply a filament\ndetection algorithm and compare simulations with different combinations of\nphysical ingredients: gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow\nfeedback. We find that gravity-only simulations produce significantly narrower\nfilament profiles than observed, while simulations that include turbulence\nproduce realistic filament properties. For these turbulence simulations, we\nfind a remarkably universal filament width of 0.10 +/- 0.02 pc, which is\nindependent of the star formation history of the clouds. We derive a\ntheoretical model that provides a physical explanation for this characteristic\nfilament width, based on the sonic scale (lambda_sonic) of molecular cloud\nturbulence. Our derivation provides lambda_sonic as a function of the cloud\ndiameter L, the velocity dispersion sigma_v, the gas sound speed c_s, and the\nratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, plasma beta. For typical cloud\nconditions in the Milky Way spiral arms, we find lambda_sonic = 0.04-0.16 pc,\nin excellent agreement with the filament width of 0.05-0.15 pc from\nobservations. Consistent with the theoretical model assumptions, we find that\nthe velocity dispersion inside the filaments is subsonic and supersonic\noutside. We further explain the observed p=2 scaling of the filament density\nprofile, rho ~ r^(-p) with the collision of two planar shocks forming a\nfilament at their intersection.\n", "  There is growing observational evidence of high-redshift quasars launching\nenergetic, fast outflows, but the effects that these have on their host\ngalaxies is poorly understood. We employ the moving-mesh code AREPO to study\nthe feedback from a quasar that has grown to $\\sim 10^9 M_\\odot$ by $z \\sim 5$\nand the impact that this has on its host galaxy. Our simulations use a\nsuper-Lagrangian refinement technique to increase the accuracy with which the\ninterface of the quasar-driven wind and the surrounding gas is resolved. We\nfind that the feedback injected in these simulations is less efficient at\nremoving gas from the galaxy than in an identical simulation with no\nsuper-Lagrangian refinement. This leads to the growth of a massive,\nrotationally supported, star-forming disc, co-existing with a powerful\nquasar-driven outflow. The properties of our host galaxy, including the\nkinematical structure of the gaseous disc and of the outflow, are in good\nagreement with current observations. Upcoming ALMA and JWST observations will\nbe an excellent test of our model and will provide further clues as to the\nvariance in properties of high-redshift quasar hosts.\n", "  A search for a very light Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons is\npresented within the framework of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel. This search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions collected by\nthe CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The signal is defined\nby the production of either of the two lightest scalars, h[1] or h[2], via\ngluon-gluon fusion and subsequent decay into a pair of the lightest Higgs\nbosons, a[1] or h[1]. The h[1] or h[2] boson is identified with the observed\nstate at a mass of 125 GeV. The analysis searches for decays of the a[1] (h[1])\nstates into pairs of tau leptons and covers a mass range for the a[1] (h[1])\nboson of 4 to 8 GeV. The search reveals no significant excess in data above\nstandard model background expectations, and an upper limit is set on the signal\nproduction cross section times branching fraction as a function of the a[1]\n(h[1]) boson mass. The 95% confidence level limit ranges from 4.5 pb at m(a[1])\n(m(h[1])) = 8 GeV to 10.3 pb at m(a[1]) (m(h[1])) = 5 GeV.\n", "  We demonstrate that it is possible to measure metallicity from the SDSS\nfive-band photometry to better than 0.1 dex using supervised machine learning\nalgorithms. Using spectroscopic estimates of metallicity as ground truth, we\nbuild, optimize and train several estimators to predict metallicity. We use the\nobserved photometry, as well as derived quantities such as stellar mass and\nphotometric redshift, as features, and we build two sample data sets at median\nredshifts of 0.103 and 0.218 and median r-band magnitude of 17.5 and 18.3\nrespectively. We find that ensemble methods, such as Random Forests of Trees\nand Extremely Randomized Trees, and Support Vector Machines all perform\ncomparably well and can measure metallicity with a Root Mean Square Error\n(RMSE) of 0.081 and 0.090 for the two data sets when all objects are included.\nThe fraction of outliers (objects for which |Z_true - Z_pred| > 0.2 dex) is 2.2\nand 3.9%, respectively and the RMSE decreases to 0.068 and 0.069 if those\nobjects are excluded. Because of the ability of these algorithms to capture\ncomplex relationships between data and target, our technique performs better\nthan previously proposed methods that sought to fit metallicity using an\nanalytic fitting formula, and has 3x more constraining power than SED\nfitting-based methods. Additionally, this method is extremely forgiving of\ncontamination in the training set, and can be used with very satisfactory\nresults for training sample sizes of just a few hundred objects. We distribute\nall the routines to reproduce our results and apply them to other data sets.\n", "  We prove that the differential equation for the null-curves of\npseudo-Euclidean space R^{2,n} defines a flat dynamical system in the sense of\noptimal control theory. The connection with general gauge theories is briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We extend a general maximum likelihood foreground estimation for cosmic\nmicrowave background polarization data to include estimation of instrumental\nsystematic effects. We focus on two particular effects: frequency band\nmeasurement uncertainty, and instrumentally induced frequency dependent\npolarization rotation. We assess the bias induced on the estimation of the\n$B$-mode polarization signal by these two systematic effects in the presence of\ninstrumental noise and uncertainties in the polarization and spectral index of\nGalactic dust. Degeneracies between uncertainties in the band and polarization\nangle calibration measurements and in the dust spectral index and polarization\nincrease the uncertainty in the extracted CMB $B$-mode power, and may give rise\nto a biased estimate. We provide a quantitative assessment of the potential\nbias and increased uncertainty in an example experimental configuration. For\nexample, we find that with 10\\% polarized dust, tensor to scalar ratio of\n$r=0.05$, and the instrumental configuration of the EBEX balloon payload, the\nestimated CMB $B$-mode power spectrum is recovered without bias when the\nfrequency band measurement has 5% uncertainty or less, and the polarization\nangle calibration has an uncertainty of up to 4$^{\\circ}$.\n", "  We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a\nconjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a\ngrand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its supersymmetric value. We\ncombine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous\nR symmetry, with a class of logarithmic or semi-logarithmic Kahler potentials\nwhich exhibit a prominent shift-symmetry with a tiny violation, whose strengths\nare quantified by c- and c+ respectively. The inflationary observables provide\nan excellent match to the recent BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck results setting\n3.5x10^-3<=r+-=c+/c-<=1/N where N=3 or 2 is the prefactor of the logarithm.\nInflation can be attained for subplanckian inflaton values with the\ncorresponding effective theories retaining the perturbative unitarity up to the\nPlanck scale.\n", "  We show that classically scale invariant gravity coupled to a single scalar\nfield can undergo dimensional transmutation and generate an effective\nEinstein-Hilbert action for gravity, coupled to a massive dilaton. The same\ntheory has an ultraviolet fixed point for coupling constant ratios such that\nall couplings are asymptotically free. However the catchment basin of this\nfixed point does not include regions of coupling constant parameter space\ncompatible with locally stable dimensional transmutation. In a companion paper\nwe will explore whether this more desirable outcome does obtain in more\ncomplicated theories with non-Abelian gauge interactions.\n", "  We show that trace distance measure of coherence is a strong monotone for all\nqubit and, so called, $X$ states. An expression for the trace distance\ncoherence for all pure states and a semi definite program for arbitrary states\nis provided. We also explore the relation between $l_1$-norm and relative\nentropy based measures of coherence, and give a sharp inequality connecting the\ntwo. In addition, it is shown that both $l_p$-norm- and Schatten-$p$-norm-based\nmeasures violate the (strong) monotonicity for all $p\\in(1,\\infty)$.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of xmm X-ray observations of the Narrow line\nSeyfert-1 (NLS1) galaxy Ark 564 taken between 2000 and 2011. High-resolution\nX-ray spectroscopy is carried out on the resultant high signal-to-noise stacked\nspectrum. We find three separate photoionised warm absorbers outflowing at\nvelocities unusually lower than typical NLS1s. Using recombination timescale\nestimates, improved constraints on the location of these clouds show they could\nbe located beyond 4 pc from the central source. Our estimates of the outflow\nkinetics suggest that the AGN in Ark 564 is unlikely to affect the host galaxy\nin its current state but over typical lifetime of 10^7 years the ISM could be\naffected. The individual observations used here suggest the luminosity varies\nover weekly timescales and in addition we find evidence of gas response to\nchanges in the ionising radiation.\n", "  We propose a theoretical model of magnetization switching in a ferromagnetic\nmultilayer by both electric current and microwaves. The electric current gives\na spin transfer torque on the magnetization, while the microwaves induce a\nprecession of the magnetization around the initial state. Based on numerical\nsimulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, it is found that the\nswitching current is significantly reduced compared with the switching caused\nsolely by the spin transfer torque when the microwave frequency is in a certain\nrange. We develop a theory of switching from the LLG equation averaged over a\nconstant energy curve. It was found that the switching current should be\nclassified into four regions, depending on the values of the microwave\nfrequency. Based on the analysis, we derive an analytical formula of the\noptimized frequency minimizing the switching current, which is smaller than the\nferromagnetic resonance frequency. We also derive an analytical formula of the\nminimized switching current. Both the optimized frequency and the minimized\nswitching current decrease with increasing the amplitude of the microwave\nfield. The results will be useful to achieve high thermal stability and low\nswitching current in spin torque systems simultaneously.\n", "  We present a model for a global axisymmetric turbulent dynamo operating in a\ngalaxy with a corona which treats the supernovae (SNe) and magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI) driven turbulence parameters under a common formalism. The\nnonlinear quenching of the dynamo is alleviated by inclusion of small-scale\nadvective and diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes, which allow the gauge\ninvariant magnetic helicity to be transferred outside the disk and consequently\nbuild up a corona during the course of dynamo action. The time-dependent dynamo\nequations are expressed in a separable form and solved through an eigenvector\nexpansion constructed using the steady-state solutions of the dynamo equation.\nThe parametric evolution of the dynamo solution allows us to estimate the final\nstructure of the global magnetic field and the saturated value of the\nturbulence parameter $\\alpha_m$, even before solving the dynamical equations\nfor evolution of magnetic fields in the disk and the corona, along with\n$\\alpha$-quenching. We then solve these equations simultaneously to study the\nsaturation of large-scale magnetic field, its dependence on the small-scale\nmagnetic helicity fluxes and corresponding evolution of the force-free field in\nthe corona. The quadrupolar large-scale magnetic field in the disk is found to\nreach equipartition strength within a timescale of 1 Gyr. The large-scale\nmagnetic field in the corona obtained is much weaker in strength compared to\nthe field inside the disk and has only a weak impact on the dynamo operation.\n", "  We study the statistical mechanics of the early radiation dominated universe\nin the context of a generalized uncertainty principle which supports the\nexistence of a minimal length scale. Utilizing the resultant modified\nthermodynamical quantities, we obtain a deformed Friedmann equation which is\nvery similar to that arises from loop quantum cosmology scenarios. The energy\nand entropy densities get maximum bounds about Planck temperature and a\nnonsingular universe then emerges in this setup.\n", "  We have presented a strategy to study nuclei and nuclear matters from first\nprinciples, namely, from QCD. We first compute nucleon-nucleon potentials\nnumerically in lattice QCD, and then use them to investigate properties of\nnuclei and nuclear matter by various methods developed in nuclear physics. As a\ndemonstration that this strategy works, mass and structure of ^4^He, ^16^O and\n^40^Ca, and equation of state of nuclear matters are determined with the\nlattice QCD induced two-nucleon potentials in a heavy quark region as an input.\nWe have found that these nuclei and the symmetric nuclear matter are bound at\none quark mass corresponding to the pseudo-scalar meson (pion) mass of 469 MeV\n(the octet baryon (nucleon) mass of 1161 MeV). The obtained binding energy per\nnucleon has a uniform mass-number A dependence which is consistent to the\nBethe-Weizsacker mass formula qualitatively. The present study demonstrates\nthat our strategy works well to investigate various properties of atomic nuclei\nand nuclear matter starting from QCD, without depending on models or\nexperimental information about the nuclear force.\n", "  This paper is an experimental review of the study of processes with a single\ntop quark at the LHC. The pioneering times are over, and this is now a sector\nof \"precision physics\" at colliders. Angular distributions of the decay\nproducts of singly-produced top quarks are unique tests of the electroweak\ninteraction. Searches for rare final states of the form t+X (where X=$\\gamma$,\nZ, H) are very sensitive to new physics, and will enter with Run II in a very\ninteresting zone of the parameter space of some theories. The relative sign of\nthe Yukawa coupling of the top quark with respect to the Higgs coupling to\ngauge bosons will be conclusively measured very soon in the tHq final state.\n", "  To better understand and enhance the thermoelectric efficiency of a new class\nof Mg-based thermoelectrics, using hybrid density-functional theory, we study\nthe microscopic origins of valley degeneracies in the conduction band of the\nsolid solution Mg2Si1-xSnx and its constituent components - namely, Mg2Si and\nMg2Sn. In the solid solution of Mg2Si1-xSnx, the Mg sublattice and Si/Sn\nsublattice are expected to undergo either tensile or compressive strain.\nInterestingly, both tensile strain of Mg2Si and compressive strain of Mg2Sn\nenhance the conduction band valley degeneracy or band convergence, which has\nbeen strongly speculated as the electronic origin of the enhanced Seebeck\ncoefficient in the Mg2Si1-xSnx system. We also consider finite-temperature\nelectronic band structures of these systems to account for high temperature\neffects. Our results clearly highlight and demonstrate the role of sublattice\nstrain in the band valley degeneracy observed in Mg2Si1-xSnx .\n", "  Hot white dwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres (hot DQs) are a cryptic\nclass of white dwarfs. In addition to their deficiency of hydrogen and helium,\nmost of these stars are highly magnetic, and a large fraction vary in\nluminosity. This variability has been ascribed to nonradial pulsations, but\nincreasing data call this explanation into question. We present studies of\nshort-term variability in seven hot DQ white dwarfs. Three (SDSS J1426+5752,\nSDSS J2200-0741, and SDSS J2348-0942) were known to be variable. Their\nphotometric modulations are coherent over at least two years, and we find no\nevidence for variability at frequencies that are not harmonics. We present the\nfirst time-series photometry for three additional hot DQs (SDSS J0236-0734,\nSDSS J1402+3818, and SDSS J1615+4543); none are observed to vary, but the\nsignal-to-noise is low. Finally, we present high speed photometry for SDSS\nJ0005-1002, known to exhibit a 2.1 d photometric variation; we do not observe\nany short-term variability. Monoperiodicity is rare among pulsating white\ndwarfs, so we contemplate whether the photometric variability is due to\nrotation rather than pulsations; similar hypotheses have been raised by other\nresearchers. If the variability is due to rotation, then hot DQ white dwarfs as\na class contain many rapid rotators. Given the lack of companions to these\nstars, the origin of any fast rotation is unclear -- both massive progenitor\nstars and double degenerate merger remnants are possibilities. We end with\nsuggestions on future work that would best clarify the nature of these rare,\nintriguing objects.\n", "  This paper presents the results of different searches for correlations\nbetween very high-energy neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and the\nhighest-energy cosmic rays measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the\nTelescope Array. We first consider samples of cascade neutrino events and of\nhigh-energy neutrino-induced muon tracks, which provided evidence for a\nneutrino flux of astrophysical origin, and study their cross-correlation with\nthe ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) samples as a function of angular\nseparation. We also study their possible directional correlations using a\nlikelihood method stacking the neutrino arrival directions and adopting\ndifferent assumptions on the size of the UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally,\nwe perform another likelihood analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using\na sample of through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source\nsearches with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at\ndiscovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The smallest of\nthe p-values comes from the search for correlation between UHECRs with IceCube\nhigh-energy cascades, a result that should continue to be monitored.\n", "  Semiconductor heterostructures are fundamental building blocks for many\nimportant device applications. The emergence of two-dimensional semiconductors\nopens up a new realm for creating heterostructures. As the bandgaps of\ntransition metal dichalcogenides thin films have sensitive layer dependence, it\nis natural to create lateral heterojunctions using the same materials with\ndifferent thicknesses. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy,\nhere we show the real space image of electronic structures across the\nbilayer-monolayer interface in MoSe2 and WSe2. Most bilayer-monolayer\nheterojunctions are found to have a zigzag-orientated interface, and the band\nalignment of such atomically sharp heterojunctions is of type-I with a\nwell-defined interface mode which acts as a narrower-gap quantum wire. The\nability to utilize such commonly existing thickness terrace as lateral\nheterojunctions is a crucial addition to the tool set for device applications\nbased on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides, with the advantage\nof easy and flexible implementation.\n", "  The unprecedented sensitivity of the Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter\narray (ALMA) is providing many new discoveries. Several of these are\nserendipitous to the original goal of the observations. We report the discovery\nof previously unknown continuum sources, or a single fast moving new source, in\nour ALMA observations. Here we aim to determine the nature of the detections.\nThe detections, at $>5.8\\sigma$ in the image plane and $>14\\sigma$ in the\n$(u,v)-$plane, were made in two epochs of ALMA observations of a $25$ arc\nsecond region around the asymptotic giant branch star W Aql in the continuum\naround 345 GHz. At a third epoch, covering $50x50$ arcseconds, the source(s)\nwere not seen. We have investigated if the detections could be spurious, if\nthey could constitute a population of variable background sources, or if the\nobservations revealed a fast moving single object. Based on our analysis, we\nconclude that a single object (with a flux of $\\sim3.0$ mJy) exhibiting a large\nproper motion ($\\sim87$ arcsec/yr) is the most likely explanation. Until the\nnature of the source becomes clear, we have named it Gna. Unless there are yet\nunknown, but significant, issues with ALMA observations, we have detected a\npreviously unknown objects in our solar system. Based on proper motion analysis\nwe find that, if it is gravitationally bound, Gna is currently located at\n$12-25$ AU distance and has a size of $\\sim220-880$ km. Alternatively it is a\nmuch larger, planet-sized, object, gravitationally unbound, and located within\n$\\sim4000$ AU, or beyond (out to $\\sim0.3$~pc) if it is strongly variable. Our\nobservations highlight the power of ALMA in detecting possible solar system\nobjects, but also show how multiple epoch observations are crucial to identify\nwhat are otherwise probably assumed to be extra-galactic sources.\n", "  The evolution of a coronal loop is studied by means of numerical simulations\nof the fully compressible three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations using\nthe HYPERION code. The footpoints of the loop magnetic field are advected by\nrandom motions. As a consequence the magnetic field in the loop is energized\nand develops turbulent nonlinear dynamics characterized by the continuous\nformation and dissipation of field-aligned current sheets: energy is deposited\nat small scales where heating occurs. Dissipation is non-uniformly distributed\nso that only a fraction of the coronal mass and volume gets heated at any time.\nTemperature and density are highly structured at scales which, in the solar\ncorona, remain observationally unresolved: the plasma of our simulated loop is\nmulti-thermal, where highly dynamical hotter and cooler plasma strands are\nscattered throughout the loop at sub-observational scales. Numerical\nsimulations of coronal loops of 50000 km length and axial magnetic field\nintensities ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 Tesla are presented. To connect these\nsimulations to observations we use the computed number densities and\ntemperatures to synthesize the intensities expected in emission lines typically\nobserved with the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode.\nThese intensities are used to compute differential emission measure\ndistributions using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain code, which are very similar\nto those derived from observations of solar active regions. We conclude that\ncoronal heating is found to be strongly intermittent in space and time, with\nonly small portions of the coronal loop being heated: in fact, at any given\ntime, most of the corona is cooling down.\n", "  We have developed a non-sequential ray-tracing simulation library, ROOT-based\nsimulator for ray tracing (ROBAST), which is aimed to be widely used in optical\nsimulations of cosmic-ray (CR) and gamma-ray telescopes. The library is written\nin C++, and fully utilizes the geometry library of the ROOT framework. Despite\nthe importance of optics simulations in CR experiments, no open-source software\nfor ray-tracing simulations that can be widely used in the community has\nexisted. To reduce the dispensable effort needed to develop multiple\nray-tracing simulators by different research groups, we have successfully used\nROBAST for many years to perform optics simulations for the Cherenkov Telescope\nArray (CTA). Among the six proposed telescope designs for CTA, ROBAST is\ncurrently used for three telescopes: a Schwarzschild-Couder (SC) medium-sized\ntelescope, one of SC small-sized telescopes, and a large-sized telescope (LST).\nROBAST is also used for the simulation and development of hexagonal light\nconcentrators proposed for the LST focal plane. Making full use of the ROOT\ngeometry library with additional ROBAST classes, we are able to build the\ncomplex optics geometries typically used in CR experiments and ground-based\ngamma-ray telescopes. We introduce ROBAST and its features developed for CR\nexperiments, and show several successful applications for CTA.\n", "  A full (2$\\pi$) phase modulation is critical for efficient wavefront\nmanipulation. In this article, a metasurface based on graphene long/short-strip\nresonators is used to implement a dynamic 2$\\pi$ phase modulation by applying\ndifferent voltages to different graphene resonators. The configuration is found\nto have high reflection efficiency (minimum 56%) and has a full phase\nmodulation in a wide frequency range. Terahertz (THz) beam steering as large as\n120 degrees ($\\pm60^\\circ$) is demonstrated in a broad frequency range (1.2 to\n1.9 THz) by changing the Fermi levels of different graphene resonators\naccordingly. This metasurface can provide a new platform for effectively\nmanipulating THz waves.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the $q \\rightarrow 0$ limit of the deformed\nVirasoro algebra and that of the level 1, 2 representation of Ding-Iohara-Miki\nalgebra. Moreover, 5D AGT correspondence at this limit is discussed. This\nspecialization corresponds to the limit from Macdonalds functions to\nHall-Littlewood functions. Using the theory of Hall-Littlewood functions, some\nproblems are solved. For example, the simplest case of 5D AGT conjectures is\nproven at this limit, and we obtain a formula for the 4-point correlation\nfunction of a certain operator.\n", "  We present an electrically driven plasmonic device consisting of a gold\nnanoparticle trapped in a gap between two electrodes. The tunneling current in\nthe device generates plasmons, which decay radiatively. The emitted spectrum\nextends up to an energy that depends on the applied voltage. Characterization\nof the electrical conductance at low temperatures allows us to extract the\nvoltage drop on each tunnel barrier and the corresponding emitted spectrum. In\nseveral devices we find a pronounced sharp asymmetrical dip in the spectrum,\nwhich we identify as a Fano resonance. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)\ncalculations reveal that this resonance is due to interference between the\nnanoparticle and electrodes dipolar fields, and can be conveniently controlled\nby the structural parameters.\n", "  We present here a nearly complete census of classical Cepheids in the\nMagellanic System. The sample extends the set of Cepheids published in the past\nby the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to the outer regions of\nthe Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The entire collection\nconsists of 9535 Cepheids of which 4620 belong to the LMC and 4915 are members\nof the SMC. We provide the I- and V-band time-series photometry of the\npublished Cepheids, their finding charts, and basic observational parameters.\n  Based on this unique OGLE sample of Cepheids we present updated\nperiod--luminosity relations for fundamental, first, and second mode of\npulsations in the I- and V-bands and for the W_I extinction-free Wesenheit\nindex. We also show the distribution of classical Cepheids in the Magellanic\nSystem. The OGLE collection contains several classical Cepheids in the\nMagellanic Bridge - the region of interaction between the Magellanic Clouds.\nThe discovery of classical Cepheids and their estimated ages confirm the\npresence of young stellar population between these galaxies.\n", "  We assume that the recently reported excess over Standard Model expectations\nin the diphoton production is originated from a new scalar boson phi which\ninteracts with photons through the coupling proportional to phi F^2. We obtain\nthe cross section for semi-elastic production process pp-> p gamma p-> p phi q\nX by considering phi-photon-photon and phi-photon-Z couplings and discuss the\nconstraints on the coupling parameters. We investigate the potential of the\nsemi-elastic production process to probe phi-photon-photon and phi-photon-Z.\n", "  We present a sample of the most interesting classical Cepheids selected from\nthe OGLE collection of classical Cepheids in the Magellanic System. The main\nselection criterion for this sample was the presence of non-standard, unique\npulsational properties.\n  The sample contains the first known double-mode Cepheid pulsating in the\nsecond- and third-overtone modes and a large number of objects with non-radial\nmodes excited. We also found Cepheids revealing Blazhko-like light curve\nmodulation, objects ceasing pulsations or showing atypical shapes of their\nlight curves. Additionally, the status of several triple mode classical\nCepheids is updated based on OGLE-IV photometry extending the time baseline to\n15 years.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with a whirling configuration.\nTheir topological properties, nanometer size and the fact that they can be\nmoved by small current densities have opened a new paradigm for the\nmanipulation of magnetisation at the nanoscale. To date, chiral skyrmion\nstructures have been experimentally demonstrated only in bulk materials and in\nepitaxial ultrathin films and under external magnetic field or at low\ntemperature. Here, we report on the observation of stable skyrmions in\nsputtered ultrathin Pt/Co/MgO nanostructures, at room temperature and zero\napplied magnetic field. We use high lateral resolution X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism microscopy to image their chiral N\\'eel internal structure which we\nexplain as due to the large strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\nas revealed by spin wave spectroscopy measurements. Our results are\nsubstantiated by micromagnetic simulations and numerical models, which allow\nthe identification of the physical mechanisms governing the size and stability\nof the skyrmions.\n", "  We analyse the correlations between continuum properties and emission line\nequivalent widths of star-forming and active galaxies from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey. Since upcoming large sky surveys will make broad-band observations\nonly, including strong emission lines into theoretical modelling of spectra\nwill be essential to estimate physical properties of photometric galaxies. We\nshow that emission line equivalent widths can be fairly well reconstructed from\nthe stellar continuum using local multiple linear regression in the continuum\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) space. Line reconstruction is good for\nstar-forming galaxies and reasonable for galaxies with active nuclei. We\npropose a practical method to combine stellar population synthesis models with\nempirical modelling of emission lines. The technique will help generate more\naccurate model spectra and mock catalogues of galaxies to fit observations of\nthe new surveys. More accurate modelling of emission lines is also expected to\nimprove template-based photometric redshift estimation methods. We also show\nthat, by combining PCA coefficients from the pure continuum and the emission\nlines, automatic distinction between hosts of weak active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) and quiescent star-forming galaxies can be made. The classification\nmethod is based on a training set consisting of high-confidence starburst\ngalaxies and AGNs, and allows for the similar separation of active and\nstar-forming galaxies as the empirical curve found by Kauffmann et al. We\ndemonstrate the use of three important machine learning algorithms in the\npaper: k-nearest neighbour finding, k-means clustering and support vector\nmachines.\n", "  New superstrong forces, analogous to QCD but featuring a larger mass scale,\nshould they exist, would offer new possibilities for addressing the strong P,\nT, problem. One can implement the \"massless quark\" solution in a\nphenomenologically acceptable way, by using a massless quark that is always\nconfined within superheavy particles, and is therefore effectively superheavy:\na cryptoquark. Assuming confinement and chiral symmetry breaking from the\nsuperstrong dynamics, we find a new mechanism to generate an axion field\nwithout introducing new fundamental scalar fields.\n", "  Prolific interactions of nonlinear waves on a plane-wave background in an\nerbium-doped fiber system are unveiled, based on explicit coexistence\nconditions extracting from the general higher-order solution of a coupled\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger and the Maxwell-Bloch equations. In contrast to\nprevious results, it shows that rich different types of nonlinear waves can\ncoexist and interact with each other. In particular, we reveal an interesting\nkind of shape-changing collision, in which the multi-peak solitons exhibit\nintensity redistribution characteristics. This interaction involves the mutual\ncollision between multi-peak solitons as well as the interplay of multi-peak\nsoliton and other types of localized nonlinear waves (breather and antidark\nsoliton). We find that the shape-changing collision preserves the power of each\nmulti-peak soliton, which is verified via optimal numerical integration for the\nenergy of light pulse against the plane-wave background. Our results\ndemonstrate that when the interactions occur, each multi-peak soliton exhibits\nthe coexistence of the shape change and energy conservation.\n", "  Results of the estimation of the precision for determination volatile\ncompounds in alcohol-containing products by gas chromatography: acetaldehyde,\nmethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, propyl alcohol,\nisobutyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol are presented. To determine\nthe accuracy, measurements were planned in accordance with ISO 5725 and held at\nthe gas chromatograph Chromatec-Crystal 5000. Standard deviation of\nrepeatability, intermediate precision and their limits are derived from\nobtained experimental data. The uncertainty of the measurements was calculated\non the base of an \"empirical\" method. The obtained values of accuracy indicate\nthat the developed method allows measurement uncertainty extended from 2 to 20%\ndepending on the analyzed compound and measured concentration.\n", "  The paper aims to consider the electromagnetic adjoint-field in the complex\noctonion space as the dark matter field, describing some properties of dark\nmatter, especially the origin, particle category, existence region, and force\nand so forth. Since J. C. Maxwell applied the algebra of quaternions to depict\nthe electromagnetic theory, some scholars adopt the complex quaternion and\noctonion to study the physics property of electromagnetic and gravitational\nfields. In the paper, by means of the octonion operator, it is found that the\ngravitational field accompanies with one adjoint-field, which property is\npartly similar to that of electromagnetic field. And the electromagnetic field\naccompanies with another adjoint-field, which feature is partly similar to that\nof gravitational field. As a result the electromagnetic adjoint-field is able\nto be chosen as one candidate of the dark matter field. According to the\nelectromagnetic adjoint-field, it is able to predict a few properties of dark\nmatter, for instance, the particle category, interaction intensity, interaction\ndistance, and existence region and so forth. The study reveals that the dark\nmatter particle and gravitational resource both will be influenced by the\ngravitational strength and force. The dark matter field is capable of making a\ncontribution to physics quantities of gravitational field, including the\nangular momentum, torque, energy, and force and so on. Further there may be\ncomparatively more chances to discover the dark matter in some regions with the\nultrastrong field strength, surrounding the neutral star, white dwarf, galactic\nnucleus, black hole, and astrophysical jet and so on.\n", "  Loop-tree duality allows to express virtual contributions in terms of\nphase-space integrals, thus leading to a direct comparison with real radiation\nterms. In this talk, we review the basis of the method and describe its\napplication to regularize Feynman integrals. Performing an integrand-level\ncombination of real and virtual terms, we obtain finite contributions that can\nbe computed in four-dimensions. Moreover, this method provides a natural\nphysical interpretation of infrared singularities, their origin and the way\nthat they cancel in the complete computation.\n", "  A theory where the gravitational, Maxwell and Dirac fields (mathematically\nrepresented as particular sections of a convenient Clifford bundle) are\nsupposed fields in Faraday's sense living in Minkowski spacetime is presented.\nIn our theory there exist a genuine energy-momentum tensor for the\ngravitational field and a genuine energy-momentum conservation law for the\nsystem of the interacting gravitational, Maxwell and Dirac fields. Moreover,\nthe energy-mometum tensors of the Maxwell and Dirac fields are symmetric, and\nit is shown that the equations of motion for the gravitational potentials is\nequivalent to Einstein equation of General Relativity (where the second member\nis the sum of the energy-momentum tensors of the Maxwell, Dirac and interaction\nMaxwell-Dirac fields) defined in an effective Lorentzian spacetime, whose use\nis eventually no more than a question of mathematical convenience.\n", "  We discuss next-to-next-to-leading order QCD results for Higgs, W-boson and\nZ-boson production in association with a jet in hadronic collisions, obtained\nusing the recently developed N-jettiness subtraction method.\n", "  Consensus dynamics in decentralised multiagent systems are subject to intense\nstudies, and several different models have been proposed and analysed. Among\nthese, the naming game stands out for its simplicity and applicability to a\nwide range of phenomena and applications, from semiotics to engineering.\nDespite the wide range of studies available, the implementation of theoretical\nmodels in real distributed systems is not always straightforward, as the\nphysical platform imposes several constraints that may have a bearing on the\nconsensus dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the effects of an\nimplementation of the naming game for the kilobot robotic platform, in which we\nconsider concurrent execution of games and physical interferences. Consensus\ndynamics are analysed in the light of the continuously evolving communication\nnetwork created by the robots, highlighting how the different regimes crucially\ndepend on the robot density and on their ability to spread widely in the\nexperimental arena. We find that physical interferences reduce the benefits\nresulting from robot mobility in terms of consensus time, but also result in\nlower cognitive load for individual agents.\n", "  Weierstrass elliptic and related functions have been recently shown to enable\nanalytical explicit solutions to classical problems in astrodynamics. These\ninclude the constant radial acceleration problem, the Stark problem and the\ntwo-fixed center (or Euler's) problem. In this paper we review the basic\ntechnique that allows for these results and we discuss the limits and merits of\nthe approach. Applications to interplanetary trajectory design are then\ndiscussed including low-thrust planetary fly-bys and the motion of an\nartificial satellite under the influence of an oblate primary including $J_2$\nand $J_3$ harmonics.\n", "  This article reviews some recent developments for new cooling technologies in\nthe fields of condensed matter physics and cold gases, both from an\nexperimental and theoretical point of view. The main idea is to make use of\ndistinct many-body interactions of the system to be cooled which can be some\ncooling stage or the material of interest itself, as is the case in cold gases.\nFor condensed matter systems, we discuss magnetic cooling schemes based on a\nlarge magnetocaloric effect as a result of a nearby quantum phase transition\nand consider effects of geometrical frustration. For ultracold gases, we review\nmany-body cooling techniques, such as spin-gradient and Pomeranchuk cooling,\nwhich can be applied in the presence of an optical lattice. We compare the\ncooling performance of these new techniques with that of conventional\napproaches and discuss state-of-the-art applications.\n", "  Since the stacking order sensitively affects various physical properties of\nlayered materials, accurate determination of the stacking order is important\nfor studying the basic properties of these materials as well as for device\napplications. Because 2H-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is most common in nature,\nmost studies so far have focused on 2H-MoS2. However, we found that the 2H, 3R,\nand mixed stacking sequences exist in few-layer MoS2 exfoliated from natural\nmolybdenite crystals. The crystal structures are confirmed by HR-TEM\nmeasurements. The Raman signatures of different polytypes are investigated by\nusing 3 different excitation energies which are non-resonant and resonant with\nA and C excitons, respectively. The low-frequency breathing and shear modes\nshow distinct differences for each polytype whereas the high-frequency\nintra-layer modes show little difference. For resonant excitations at 1.96 and\n2.81 eV, distinct features are observed which enable determination of the\nstacking order.\n", "  We review the history and status of the famous classification of\nextraterrestrial civilizations given by the great Russian astrophysicist\nNikolai Semenovich Kardashev, roughly half a century after it has been\nproposed. While Kardashev's classification (or Kardashev's scale) has often\nbeen seen as oversimplified, and multiple improvements, refinements, and\nalternatives to it have been suggested, it is still one of the major tools for\nserious theoretical investigation of SETI issues. During these 50+ years,\nseveral attempts at modifying or reforming the classification have been made;\nwe review some of them here, together with presenting some of the scenarios\nwhich present difficulties to the standard version. Recent results in both\ntheoretical and observational SETI studies, especially the G-hat infrared\nsurvey (2014-2015), have persuasively shown that the emphasis on detectability\ninherent in Kardashev's classification obtains new significance and freshness.\nSeveral new movements and conceptual frameworks, such as the Dysonian SETI,\ntally extremely well with these developments. So, the apparent simplicity of\nthe classification is highly deceptive: Kardashev's work offers a wealth of\nstill insufficiently studied methodological and epistemological ramifications\nand it remains, in both letter and spirit, perhaps the worthiest legacy of the\nSETI \"founding fathers\".\n", "  Coronagraphs of the apodized pupil and shaped pupil varieties use the\nFraunhofer diffraction properties of amplitude masks to create regions of high\ncontrast in the vicinity of a target star. Here we present a hybrid coronagraph\narchitecture in which a binary, hard-edged shaped pupil mask replaces the gray,\nsmooth apodizer of the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC). For any contrast\nand bandwidth goal in this configuration, as long as the prescribed region of\ncontrast is restricted to a finite area in the image, a shaped pupil is the\napodizer with the highest transmission. We relate the starlight cancellation\nmechanism to that of the conventional APLC. We introduce a new class of\nsolutions in which the amplitude profile of the Lyot stop, instead of being\nfixed as a padded replica of the telescope aperture, is jointly optimized with\nthe apodizer. Finally, we describe shaped pupil Lyot coronagraph (SPLC) designs\nfor the baseline architecture of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nTelescope-Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (WFIRST-AFTA) coronagraph.\nThese SPLCs help to enable two scientific objectives of the WFIRST-AFTA\nmission: (1) broadband spectroscopy to characterize exoplanet atmospheres in\nreflected starlight and (2) debris disk imaging.\n", "  Recent progresses in the description of the latter stage of nuclear fission\nare reported. Dynamical effects during the descent of the potential towards\nscission and in the formation of the fission fragments are studied with the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock approach with dynamical pairing correlations at the\nBCS level. In particular, this approach is used to compute the final kinetic\nenergy of the fission fragments. Comparison with experimental data on the\nfission of 258Fm are made.\n", "  The normal matrix model with algebraic potential has gained a lot of\nattention recently, partially in virtue of its connection to several other\ntopics as quadrature domains, inverse potential problems and the Laplacian\ngrowth.\n  In this paper we consider the normal matrix model with cubic plus linear\npotential. To regularize the model, we follow Elbau & Felder and introduce a\ncut-off. In the large size limit, the eigenvalues of the model accumulate\nuniformly within a certain domain $\\Omega$ that we determine explicitly by\nfinding the rational parametrization of its boundary.\n  We also study in details the mother body problem associated to $\\Omega$. It\nturns out that the mother body measure $\\mu_*$ displays a novel phase\ntransition that we call the mother body phase transition: although $\\partial\n\\Omega$ evolves analytically, the mother body measure undergoes a \"one-cut to\nthree-cut\" phase transition.\n  To construct the mother body measure, we define a quadratic differential\n$\\varpi$ on the associated spectral curve, and embed $\\mu_*$ into its critical\ngraph. Using deformation techniques for quadratic differentials, we are able to\nget precise information on $\\mu_*$. In particular, this allows us to determine\nthe phase diagram for the mother body phase transition explicitly.\n  Following previous works of Bleher & Kuijlaars and Kuijlaars & L\\'opez, we\nconsider multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the model. Applying\nthe Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to the associated\nRiemann-Hilbert problem, we obtain asymptotic formulas for these polynomials.\nDue to the presence of the linear term in the potential, there are no\nrotational symmetries in the model. This makes the construction of the\nassociated $g$-functions significantly more involved, and the critical graph of\n$\\varpi$ becomes the key technical tool in this analysis as well.\n", "  I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a\nuniform basis and then interpolate within that basis to construct stellar\nisochrones. The method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from\nsubstellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the\npre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in\nwhich stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation\nbetween initial stellar mass and lifetime and how these may be dealt with in\nisochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for\nthe number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the\noriginal grid required in order to achieve a certain level of accuracy in the\nresulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and\nopen-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.\n", "  Development of refrigerators based on Thermoacoustic technology is a novel\nsolution to the present day need of cooling without causing environmental\nhazards. With added advantages of absence of moving parts and circulating\nrefrigerants, these devices can attain very low temperatures maintaining a\ncompact size. The present theoretical work is based on theory of linear\nthermoacoustics[1]. Under the short stack and invicid assumptions, an algorithm\nfor design of a standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerator, with main focus on\nthe stack, is described. A stack is designed for a given cooling requirement of\nthe refrigerator and certain chosen operation parameters.\n", "  Nonlinear wave formation and propagation on a complex network with excitable\nnode dynamics is of fundamental interest in diverse fields in science and\nengineering. Here, we propose a new model of the Kuramoto type to study\nnonlinear wave generation and propagation on circular subgraphs of a complex\nnetwork. On circle networks, in the continuum limit, this model is equivalent\nto the over-damped Frenkel-Kontorova model. The new model is shown to keep the\nessential features of those well-known models such as the diffusively coupled\nB\\\"ar-Eiswirth model but with much simplified expression such that analytic\nanalysis becomes possible. We classify traveling wave solutions on circle\nnetworks and show the universality of its features with perturbation analysis\nand numerical computation.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a generalized cross-coupled\nCamassa-Holm system with peakons and higher-order nonlinearities. By the\ntransport equation theory and the classical Friedrichs regularization method,\nwe obtain the local well-posedness of solutions for the system in\nnonhomogeneous Besov spaces $B^s_{p,r}\\times B^s_{p,r}$ with $1\\leq p,r \\leq\n+\\infty$ and $s>\\max\\{2+\\frac{1}{p},\\frac{5}{2}\\}$. Moreover, we construct the\nlocal well-posedness in the critical Besov space $B^{5/2}_{2,1}\\times\nB^{5/2}_{2,1}$ and the blow-up criteria. In the paper, we also consider the\nwell-posedness problem in the sense of Hadamard, non-uniform dependence, and\nH\\\"older continuity of the data-to-solution map for the system on both the\nperiodic and the non-periodic case. In light of a Galerkin-type approximation\nscheme, the system is shown well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s\\times\nH^s,s>5/2$ in the sense of Hadamard, that is, the data-to-solution map is\ncontinuous. However, the solution map is not uniformly continuous. Furthermore,\nwe prove the H\\\"older continuity in the $H^r\\times H^r$ topology when $0\\leq r<\ns$ with H\\\"older exponent $\\alpha$ depending on both $s$ and $r$.\n", "  We study decoherence in an interacting qubit system described by infinite\nrange Heisenberg model (IRHM) in a situation where the system is coupled to a\nbath of local optical phonons. Using perturbation theory in polaron frame of\nreference, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that is valid in the regime of\nstrong spin-phonon coupling under non-adiabatic conditions. It is shown that\nthe effective Hamiltonian commutes with the IRHM upto leading orders of\nperturbation and thus has the same eigenstates as the IRHM. Using a quantum\nmaster equation with Markovian approximation of dynamical evolution, we show\nthat the off diagonal elements of the density matrix donot decay in the energy\neigen basis of IRHM.\n", "  Our main goal in this paper is to prove existence (and uniqueness) of the\nquantum propagator for time dependent quantum Hamiltonians $\\hat H(t)$ when\nthis Hamiltonian is perturbed with a quadratic white noise $\\dot{\\beta}\\hat K$.\n$\\beta$ is a continuous function in time $t$, $\\dot \\beta$ its time derivative\nand $K$ is a quadratic Hamiltonian. $\\hat K$ is the Weyl quantization of $K$.\nFor time dependent quadratic Hamiltonians $H(t)$ we recover, under less\nrestrictive assumptions, the results obtained in \\cite{bofu, du}.In our\napproach we use an exact Hermann Kluk formula \\cite{ro2} to deduce a Strichartz\nestimate for the propagator of $\\hat H(t) +\\dot \\beta K$. This is applied to\nobtain local and global well posedness for solutions for non linear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations with an irregular time dependent linear part.\n", "  The paper address the effects of magnetic helicity conservation in a\nnon-linear nonaxisymmetric mean-field solar dynamo model. We study the\nevolution of the shallow non-axisymmetric magnetic field perturbation with the\nstrength about 10G in the solar convection zone. The dynamo evolves from the\npure axisymmetric stage through the short (about 2 years) transient phase when\nthe non-axisymmetric m=1 dynamo mode is dominant to the final stage where the\naxisymmetry of the dynamo is almost restored. It is found that magnetic\nhelicity is transferred forth and back over the spectral space during the\ntransient phase. Also our simulations shows that the non-axisymmetric\ndistributions of magnetic helicity tend to follows the regions of the Hale\npolarity rule.\n", "  In-plane nonlinear delocalized vibrations in uniformly stretched single-layer\ngraphene (space group P6mm) are considered with the aid of the\ngroup-theoretical methods. These methods were developed by authors earlier in\nthe framework of the theory of the bushes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). We\nhave found that only 4 symmetry-determined NNMs (one-dimensional bushes), as\nwell as 14 two-dimensional, 1 three-dimensional and 6 four-dimensional\nvibrational bushes are possible in graphene. They are exact solutions to the\ndynamical equations of this two-dimensional crystal. Prospects of further\nresearch are discussed.\n", "  When a beam propagates in an accelerator, it interacts with both the external\nfields and the self-generated electromagnetic fields. If the latter are strong\nenough, the interplay between them and a perturbation in the beam distribution\nfunction can lead to an enhancement of the initial perturbation, resulting in\nwhat we call a beam instability. This unstable motion can be controlled with a\nfeedback system, if available, or it grows, causing beam degradation and loss.\nBeam instabilities in particle accelerators have been studied and analysed in\ndetail since the late 1950s. The subject owes its relevance to the fact that\nthe onset of instabilities usually determines the performance of an\naccelerator. Understanding and suppressing the underlying sources and\nmechanisms is therefore the key to overcoming intensity limitations, thereby\npushing forward the performance reach of a machine.\n", "  The protection of accelerator equipment is as old as accelerator technology\nand was for many years related to high-power equipment. Examples are the\nprotection of powering equipment from overheating (magnets, power converters,\nhigh-current cables), of superconducting magnets from damage after a quench and\nof klystrons. The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent.\nIt is related to the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators\nsuch as ISIS, SNS, ESS and the PSI cyclotron, to the emission of synchrotron\nlight by electron-positron accelerators and FELs, and to the increase of energy\nstored in the beam (in particular for hadron colliders such as LHC). Designing\na machine protection system requires an excellent understanding of accelerator\nphysics and operation to anticipate possible failures that could lead to\ndamage. Machine protection includes beam and equipment monitoring, a system to\nsafely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping the beam or stopping the beam at low\nenergy) and an interlock system providing the glue between these systems. The\nmost recent accelerator, the LHC, will operate with about 3x10 14 protons per\nbeam, corresponding to an energy stored in each beam of 360 MJ. This energy can\ncause massive damage to accelerator equipment in case of uncontrolled beam\nloss, and a single accident damaging vital parts of the accelerator could\ninterrupt operation for years. This article provides an overview of the\nrequirements for protection of accelerator equipment and introduces the various\nprotection systems. Examples are mainly from LHC, SNS and ESS.\n", "  The main features of radio-frequency linear accelerators are introduced,\nreviewing the different types of accelerating structures and presenting the\nmain characteristics aspects of linac beam dynamics.\n", "  The space charge forces are those generated directly by the charge\ndistribution, with the inclusion of the image charges and currents due to the\ninteraction of the beam with a perfectly conducting smooth pipe. Space charge\nforces are responsible for several unwanted phenomena related to beam dynamics,\nsuch as energy loss, shift of the synchronous phase and frequency, shift of the\nbetatron frequencies, and instabilities. We will discuss in this lecture the\nmain feature of space charge effects in high-energy storage rings as well as in\nlow-energy linacs and transport lines.\n", "  When a charged particle travels across the vacuum chamber of an accelerator,\nit induces electromagnetic fields, which are left mainly behind the generating\nparticle. These electromagnetic fields act back on the beam and influence its\nmotion. Such an interaction of the beam with its surro undings results in beam\nenergy losses, alters the shape of the bunches, and shifts the betatron and\nsynchrotron frequencies. At high beam current the fields can even lead to\ninstabilities, thus limiting the performance of the accelerator in terms of\nbeam quality and current intensity. We discuss in this lecture the general\nfeatures of the electromagnetic fields, introducing the concepts of wakefields\nand giving a few simple examples in cylindrical geometry. We then show the\neffect of the wakefields on the dynamics of a beam in a linac, dealing in\nparticular with the beam breakup instability and how to cure it.\n", "  The condensation of an electron superfluid from a conventional metallic state\nat a critical temperature $T_c$ is described well by the BCS theory. In the\nunderdoped copper-oxides, high-temperature superconductivity condenses instead\nfrom a nonconventional metallic \"pseudogap\" phase that exhibits a variety of\nnon-Fermi liquid properties. Recently, it has become clear that a charge\ndensity wave (CDW) phase exists within the pseudogap regime, appearing at a\ntemperature $T_{CDW}$ just above $T_c$. The near coincidence of $T_c$ and\n$T_{CDW}$, as well the coexistence and competition of CDW and superconducting\norder below $T_c$, suggests that they are intimately related. Here we show that\nthe condensation of the superfluid from this unconventional precursor is\nreflected in deviations from the predictions of BSC theory regarding the\nrecombination rate of quasiparticles. We report a detailed investigation of the\nquasiparticle (QP) recombination lifetime, $\\tau_{qp}$, as a function of\ntemperature and magnetic field in underdoped HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$\n(Hg-1201) and YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) single crystals by ultrafast\ntime-resolved reflectivity. We find that $\\tau_{qp}(T)$ exhibits a local\nmaximum in a small temperature window near $T_c$ that is prominent in\nunderdoped samples with coexisting charge order and vanishes with application\nof a small magnetic field. We explain this unusual, non-BCS behavior by\npositing that $T_c$ marks a transition from phase-fluctuating SC/CDW composite\norder above to a SC/CDW condensate below. Our results suggest that the\nsuperfluid in underdoped cuprates is a condensate of coherently-mixed\nparticle-particle and particle-hole pairs.\n", "  The mechanism of Landau damping is observed in various systems from plasma\noscillations to accelerators. Despite its widespread use, some confusion has\nbeen created, partly because of the different mechanisms producing the damping\nbut also due to the mathematical subtleties treating the effects. In this\narticle the origin of Landau damping is demonstrated for the damping of plasma\noscillations. In the second part it is applied to the damping of coherent\noscillations in particle accelerators. The physical origin, the mathematical\ntreatment leading to the concept of stability diagrams and the applications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  After a short overview of a general approach to cavity design, we sketch the\nderivation of waveguide modes from plane waves and of cavity fields from\nwaveguide modes. The characteristic parameters describing cavities and their\nperformance are defined and explained. An equivalent circuit is introduced and\nextended to explain beam loading and higher order modes. Finally travelling-\nand standing-wave multi-gap cavities are introduced using the Brillouin\ndiagram.\n", "  The availability of low frequency data is an important factor in the success\nof full waveform inversion (FWI) in the acoustic regime. The low frequencies\nhelp determine the kinematically relevant, low-wavenumber components of the\nvelocity model, which are in turn needed to avoid convergence of FWI to\nspurious local minima. However, acquiring data below 2 or 3 Hz from the field\nis a challenging and expensive task. In this paper we explore the possibility\nof synthesizing the low frequencies computationally from high-frequency data,\nand use the resulting prediction of the missing data to seed the frequency\nsweep of FWI. As a signal processing problem, bandwidth extension is a very\nnonlinear and delicate operation. It requires a high-level interpretation of\nbandlimited seismic records into individual events, each of which is\nextrapolable to a lower (or higher) frequency band from the non-dispersive\nnature of the wave propagation model. We propose to use the phase tracking\nmethod for the event separation task. The fidelity of the resulting\nextrapolation method is typically higher in phase than in amplitude. To\ndemonstrate the reliability of bandwidth extension in the context of FWI, we\nfirst use the low frequencies in the extrapolated band as data substitute, in\norder to create the low-wavenumber background velocity model, and then switch\nto recorded data in the available band for the rest of the iterations. The\nresulting method, EFWI for short, demonstrates surprising robustness to the\ninaccuracies in the extrapolated low frequency data. With two synthetic\nexamples calibrated so that regular FWI needs to be initialized at 1 Hz to\navoid local minima, we demonstrate that FWI based on an extrapolated [1, 5] Hz\nband, itself generated from data available in the [5, 15] Hz band, can produce\nreasonable estimations of the low wavenumber velocity models.\n", "  One of the most severe limitations in high-intensity particle colliders is\nthe beam-beam interaction, i.e. the perturbation of the beams as they cross the\nopposing beams. This introduction to beam-beam effects concentrates on a\ndescription of the phenomena that are present in modern colliding beam\nfacilities.\n", "  Two well-known mechanisms, one-axis twisting (OAT) and two-axis\ncountertwisting (TACT), generate spinsqueezed states dynamically. The latter\nprovides better spin squeezing (SS) but has not been demonstrated as the form\nof its interaction does not occur naturally in known physical systems. Several\nproposals for realizing effective TACT transformed from OAT require stringent\nexperimental conditions in order to overcome the resulting nonstationary\n(oscillating) SS and continuously varying mean spin directions. This work\npresents a simple scheme that solves both problems by freezing SS at an optimal\npoint and realizing effectively persistent SS by inhibiting further squeezing\ndynamics. Explicit procedures are outlined for persistent SS of the TACT limit.\nProtocols based on our scheme favorably relax experimental demands, which\nsignificantly brighten the prospects for realizing TACT.\n", "  The Lema\\'itre-Toman-Bondi (LTB) models have reported to suffer from\nincompatibility with cosmological observations and fine-tuning of the\nobserver's location. Further analysis of these issues indicates that they could\nbe resolved by models that are compatible with the supernova Ia data, but less\ninhomogeneous than those that have been presented in the literature so far. We\nstudy if such models exist by employing the degrees of freedom of the LTB\nmodels in a novel manner. We discovered two scenarios which may meet the\nexpectations, but extensive numerical and analytical investigation showed them\ninviable. We extended our studies to the $\\Lambda$LTB models, which generalizes\nthe LTB models by including a non-zero cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in\nEinsteins equations. This adds an additional degree of freedom for the earlier\nscenarios and introduces a new scenario capable of meeting the expectations.\nHowever, extensive numerical and analytical investigation reveals that\ninclusion of $\\Lambda$ does not enhance the viability of the models. We\nidentify the lack of degrees of freedom to be the reason for the unviability.\nHowever, the method presented here can be generalized to models including more\ndegrees of freedom, like the Szekeres models, which have more promise to\novercome the issues in the LTB models.\n", "  Coupled-bunch instabilities excited by the interaction of the particle beam\nwith its surroundings can seriously limit the performance of circular particle\naccelerators. These instabilities can be cured by the use of active feedback\nsystems based on sensors capable of detecting the unwanted beam motion and\nactuators that apply the feedback correction to the beam. Advances in\nelectronic technology now allow the implementation of feedback loops using\nprogrammable digital systems. Besides important advantages in terms of\nflexibility and reproducibility, digital systems open the way to the use of\nnovel diagnostic tools and additional features. We first introduce\ncoupled-bunch instabilities, analysing the equation of motion of charged\nparticles and the different modes of oscillation of a multi-bunch beam, showing\nhow they can be observed and measured. Different types of feedback systems will\nthen be presented as examples of real implementations that belong to the\nhistory of multi-bunch feedback systems. The main components of a feedback\nsystem and the related issues will also be analysed. Finally, we shall focus on\ndigital feedback systems, their characteristics, and features, as well as on\nhow they can be concretely exploited for both the optimization of feedback\nperformance and for beam dynamics studies.\n", "  The use of a ccelerators for medical applications has evolved from initial\nexperimentation to turn-key devices commonly operating in hospitals. New\napplications are continuously being developed around the world, and the\nhadrontherapy facilities of the newest generation are placed at the frontier\nbetween industrial production and advanced R&D. An introduction to the\ndifferent medical application accelerators is followed by a description of the\nhadrontherapy facilities, with special emphasis on CNAO, and the report closes\nwith a brief outlook on the future of this field.\n", "  Photonic structures offer unique opportunities for controlling light-matter\ninteraction, including the photonic spin Hall effect associated with the\ntransverse spin-dependent displacement of light that propagates in specially\ndesigned optical media. However, due to small spin-orbit coupling, the photonic\nspin Hall effect is usually weak at the nanoscale. Here we suggest\ntheoretically and demonstrate experimentally, in both optics and microwave\nexperiments, the photonic spin Hall effect enhanced by topologically protected\nedge states in subwavelength arrays of resonant dielectric particles. Based on\ndirect near-field measurements, we observe the selective excitation of the\ntopological edge states controlled by the handedness of the incident light.\nAdditionally, we reveal the main requirements to the symmetry of photonic\nstructures to achieve a topology-enhanced spin Hall effect, and also analyse\nthe robustness of the photonic edge states against the long-ranged coupling.\n", "  Sn is a well-known classical superconductor on the border between type I and\ntype II with critical temperature of 3.722K and critical field of 0.031T. We\nshow by means of specific heat and electric magneto-transport data that its\ncritical parameters can be dramatically increased if it is brought in the form\nof loosely bound bundles of thin nanowires. The specific heat displays a\npronounced double phase transition at 3.7K and 5.5K, which we attribute to the\ninner 'bulk' contribution of the nanowires and to the surface contribution,\nrespectively. The latter is visible only because of the large volume fraction\nof the surface layer in relation to their bulk inner volume. The upper\ntransition coincides with the onset of the resistive transition, while zero\nresistance is gradually approached below the lower transition. The large\ncoherence length of 230nm at 0K likely actuates a Josephson coupling between\nadjacent neighboring nanowires and thus suppresses the effect of 1D phase\nfluctuations along the nanowires, and stabilizes 3D phase coherence throughout\nthe entire network with zero resistance. A magnetic field of more than 3T is\nrequired to restore the normal state, which means that the critical field is\nenhanced by about two orders of magnitude with respect to Sn in its bulk form.\n", "  In this study, we propose a novel way to explore the patterns of people's\nvisits to academic articles. About 3.4 million links to referral source of\nvisitors of 1432 papers published in the journal of PeerJ are collected and\nanalyzed. We find that at least 57% visits are from external referral sources,\namong which General Search Engine, Social Network, and News & Blog are the top\nthree categories of referrals. Academic Resource, including academic search\nengines and academic publishers' sites, is the fourth largest category of\nreferral sources. In addition, our results show that Google contributes\nsignificantly the most in directing people to scholarly articles. This\nencompasses the usage of Google the search engine, Google Scholar the academic\nsearch engine, and diverse specific country domains of them. Focusing on\nsimilar disciplines to PeerJ's publication scope, NCBI is the academic search\nengine on which people are the most frequently directed to PeerJ. Correlation\nanalysis and regression analysis indicates that papers with more mentions are\nexpected to have more visitors, and Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are the most\ncommonly used social networking tools that refer people to PeerJ.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the ground state\nenergy of the Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian for a Fermionic multipolaron in the\nso-called strong coupling limit. We prove that it is given to leading order by\nthe ground state energy of the Pekar-Tomasevich functional with Fermionic\nstatistics, which is a much simpler model. Our main theorem is new because none\nof the previous results on the strong coupling limit have taken into account\nthe Fermionic statistics and the spin of the electrons. A binding result for\nFr\\\"ohlich multipolarons is a corollary of our main theorem combined with the\nbinding result for multipolarons in the Pekar-Tomasevich model by the first\nauthor and Griesemer in [AG14]. Our analysis strongly relies on the work of\nWellig [Well15] which in turn used and generalized methods developed by Lieb\nand Thomas [LT97], Frank, Lieb, Seiringer and Thomas [FLST11] and Griesemer and\nWellig [GW13]. In order to take the Fermionic statistics into account, we\nemploy a localization method given by Lieb and Loss in [LL05].\n", "  We theoretically study electronic transport through a region with\ninhomogeneous Rashba spin-orbit (RSO) coupling placed between two normal\nregions in a monolayer graphene. The inhomogeneous RSO region is characterized\nby linearly varying RSO strength within its borders and constant RSO strength\nin the central region. We calculate the transmission properties within the\ntransfer matrix approach. It is shown that the amplitude of conductance\noscillations reduces and at the same time the magnitude of conductance\nincreases with increasing border thickness. We also investigate how the Fano\nfactor can be modified by the border thickness of RSO region.\n", "  Themis is an old and statistically robust asteroid family populating the\nouter main belt, and resulting from a catastrophic collision that took place\n2.5$\\pm$1.0 Gyr ago. Within the old Themis family a young sub-family, Beagle,\nformed less than 10 Myr ago, has been identified. We present the results of a\nspectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared range of 22 Themis and 8\nBeagle families members. The Themis members investigated exhibit a wide range\nof spectral behaviors, while the younger Beagle family members look spectrally\nbluer with a smaller spectral slope variability. The best meteorite spectral\nanalogues found for both Themis and Beagle families members are carbonaceous\nchondrites having experienced different degrees of aqueous alteration,\nprevalently CM2 but also CV3 and CI, and some of them are chondrite samples\nbeing unusual or heated. We extended the spectral analysis including the data\navailable in the literature on Themis and Beagle families members, and we\nlooked for correlations between spectral behavior and physical parameters using\nthe albedo and size values derived from the WISE data. The analysis of this\nlarger sample confirm the spectral diversity within the Themis family and that\nBeagle members tend to be bluer and to have an higher albedo. The differences\nbetween the two family may be partially explained by space weathering\nprocesses, which act on these primitive surfaces in a similar way than on\nS-type asteroids, i.e. producing reddening and darkening. However we see\nseveral Themis members having albedos and spectral slopes similar to the young\nBeagle members. Alternative scenarios are proposed including heterogeneity in\nthe parent body having a compositional gradient with depth, and/or the survival\nof projectile fragments having a different composition than the parent body.\n", "  A strong outburst of the X-ray transient V404 Cygni (= GS2023-338) was\nobserved in 2015 June/July up to a level of 50 Crab in the hard X-ray domain.\nAt this level of photon flux, an instrument's behavior may be severely tested\nand some instrumental artifacts could affect the data analysis. We are\ninterested in the SPI instrument aboard the INTEGRAL mission and have performed\nthorough checks to ensure a correct handling of the data. By analyzing the\nobservations throughout the outburst, we have observed that the high energy\ndomain (above 500 keV) sometimes exhibits unexpected features which are worth\ncareful examination. Spurious triggers are known to affect the MeV region and\nwe suspected that this phenomenon could be accentuated by the huge photon flux.\nWe have investigated this issue, specifically during high flux periods and\nactually found that artificial high energy bumps may appear with the current\nstandard analysis procedure. However, if the specific selection events usually\nused in the 650-2200 keV energy is applied down to 450 keV, the spurious noise\nand the associated spectral features are removed. We present how to obtain\nreliable spectral results on the high energy emission of V404 Cyg at extreme\nflux levels and demonstrate that with the correct configuration, the hard X-ray\nemission, up to a few MeV, is modeled by a two component model as observed in\nCyg X-1 and for V404 Cygni itself at lower flux levels.\n", "  In articular cartilage the orientation of collagen fibres is not uniform,\nvarying mostly with the depth on the tissue. Besides, the biomechanical\nresponse of each layer of the articular cartilage differs from the neighbouring\nones, evolving through thickness as a function of the distribution, density and\norientation of the collagen fibres. Based on a finite element implementation, a\nnew continuum formulation is proposed to describe the remodelling and\nreorientation of the collagen fibres under arbitrary mechanical loads: the\ncartilaginous tissue is modelled based on a hyperelastic formulation, being the\nground isotropic matrix described by a neo-Hookean law and the fibrillar\nanisotropic part modelled by a new anisotropic formulation introduced for the\nfirst time in the present work, in which both reorientation and remodelling are\ntaken into account. To characterize the orientation of fibres, a structure\ntensor is defined to represent the expected distribution and orientation of\nfibres around a reference direction. The isotropic and anisotropic constitutive\nparameters were determined by the good validation of the numerical models with\nthe experimental data available from the literature. Considering the effect of\nrealistic collagen fibre reorientation in the cartilage tissue, the remodelling\nalgorithm associated with a distribution of fibres model showed accurate\nresults with few numerical calculations.\n", "  We study certain two-dimensional variational systems, namely pluri-Lagrangian\nsystems on the root lattice $Q(A_{N})$. Here, we follow the scheme which was\nalready used to define two-dimensional pluri-Lagrangian systems on the lattice\n$\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$ and three-dimensional pluri-Lagrangian systems on the lattice\n$\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$ as well as on $Q(A_{N})$. We will show that the\ntwo-dimensional pluri-Lagragian systems on $Q(A_{N})$ are more general than the\nones on $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$, in the sense that they can encode several different\npluri-Lagrangian systems on $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$. This also means that the\nvariational formulation of several systems of certain hyperbolic equations,\nso-called quad-equations, can be obtained from one and the same\npluri-Lagrangian system on $Q(A_{N})$.\n", "  This paper considers the influence of nanoparticles on the nonlinear\nJeffery-Hamel flow problem. Investigation is performed for three types of\nnanoparticles namely copper Cu, alumina Al2O3 and titania TiO2 by considering\nwater as a base fluid. The resulting nonlinear governing equations and their\nassociated boundary conditions are solved for both semi-analytical and\nnumerical solutions. The semi-analytical solution is developed by using\nHomotopy Perturbation Method (HPM) whereas the numerical solution is presented\nby Runge-Kutta scheme. Dimensionless velocity, temperature, skin friction\ncoefficient and Nusselt number are addressed for the involved pertinent\nparameters. It is observed that the influence of solid volume fraction of\nnanoparticles on the heat transfer and fluid flow parameters is more noticeable\nwhen compared with the type of nanoparticles. The achieved results reveal that\nHPM is very effective, convenient and accurate for this problem.\n", "  We prove the local energy decay for the wave equation in a wave guide with\ndissipation at the boundary. It appears that for large times the dissipated\nwave behaves like a solution of a heat equation in the unbounded directions.\nThe proof is based on resolvent estimates. Since the eigenvectors for the\ntransverse operator do not form a Riesz basis, the spectral analysis does not\ntrivially reduce to separate analyses on compact and Euclidean domains.\n", "  We report accurate, calculated electronic, transport, and bulk properties of\nzinc blende gallium arsenide (GaAs). Our ab-initio, non-relativistic,\nself-consistent calculations employed a local density approximation (LDA)\npotential and the linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO) formalism. We\nstrictly followed the Bagayoko, Zhao, and William (BZW) method as enhanced by\nEkuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). Our calculated, direct band gap of 1.429 eV, at an\nexperimental lattice constant of 5.65325 {\\AA}, is in excellent agreement with\nthe experimental values. The calculated, total density of states data\nreproduced several experimentally determined peaks. We have predicted an\nequilibrium lattice constant, a bulk modulus, and a low temperature band gap of\n5.632 {\\AA}, 75.49 GPa, and 1.520 eV, respectively. The latter two are in\nexcellent agreement with corresponding, experimental values of 75.5 GPa (74.7\nGPa) and 1.519 eV, respectively. This work underscores the capability of the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) to describe and to predict accurately\nproperties of semiconductors, provided the calculations adhere to the\nconditions of validity of DFT [AIP Advances, 4, 127104 (2014)].\n", "  We demonstrate a simple and easy method for producing low-reflectivity\nsurfaces that are ultra-high vacuum compatible, may be baked to high\ntemperatures, and are easily applied even on complex surface geometries. Black\ncupric oxide (CuO) surfaces are chemically grown in minutes on any copper\nsurface, allowing for low-cost, rapid prototyping and production. The\nreflective properties are measured to be comparable to commercially available\nproducts for creating optically black surfaces. We describe a vacuum apparatus\nwhich uses multiple blackened copper surfaces for sensitive, low-background\ndetection of molecules using laser-induced fluorescence.\n", "  Majorana fermions in some model semiconductor nanowires proximity coupled\nwith \\emph{s}-wave superconductor have been investigated, as well as other\nintragap bound states in topological phase of a Rashba nanowire with\nnon-uniform spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Various sources of disorder, such as\ndisorder in semiconductor nanowire, bulk superconductor and\nsemiconductor-superconductor interface, are included to characterize their\neffects on the stability of the topological phase. In the case of multiband\nsemiconducting nanowires, the phase diagram of the system as a function of the\nchemical potential and magnetic field have been calculated. In two-band wire or\ntwo coupled single band wire, the phase of one band can be controlled through\nthe other band, and these properties is critical to build multiband quantum\ndevice. When the SOI vector or magnetic field in semiconductor nanowire rapidly\nrotates by the angle $\\pi $, changes its sign, a topological $\\pi $ junction\nforms at the junction between two wire sections characterized by different\ndirections of the SOI vectors or magnetic field. In this case, some fermionic\nbound states (FBS) can emerge inside the proximity gap, which localize at the\ntopological $\\pi $ junction, and coexist with Majorana bound states localized\nat the nanowire ends. Changing the position of the topological $\\pi $ junction\nfrom one end to the other, the zero-energy FBS moves and can be used as\nmediator to transfer quantum information between two distance MFs. Meanwhile,\nthe Andreev spectrum of the junction is qualitatively phase shift by $\\pi $\ncompared to usual Majorana weak links. The FBS can act as quasiparticle traps\nand serve as an effective mediator of hybridization between two distant\nMajorana bound states (MBSs).\n", "  The functionalized graphene with induced superconductivity, Zeeman coupling,\nand finite Rashba spin-orbit coupling is proposed to display topological\nsuperconducting phases with Majorana end modes. We obtain the phase diagram of\nbulk graphene and nanoribbon by calculating the Chern number, band structure\nand wavefunction. The electron doping in graphene, magnetic field and\nstrain-induced pseudomagnetic field can result in the topological phase\ntransition. Moreover, it is interested to note that strain has negative\ninfluence on the stability of topological nontrivial phase either uniform or\nnonuniform, destroying the existence of Majorana fermion, which provides a new\nway to transfer, create and fuse Majorana fermions. Some experimental schemes\nare also introduced to tailor functionalized graphene, generating various\ndevices applied in topological quantum computation.\n", "  Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are being closely monitored by\nremote sensing experiments which rely on knowing line intensities with an\nuncertainty of 0.5% or better. We report a theoretical study providing\nrotation-vibration line intensities substantially within the required accuracy\nbased on the use of a highly accurate {\\it ab initio} dipole moment surface\n(DMS). The theoretical model developed is used to compute CO$_2$ intensities\nwith uncertainty estimates informed by cross comparing line lists calculated\nusing pairs of potential energy surfaces (PES) and DMS's of similar high\nquality. This yields lines sensitivities which are utilized in reliability\nanalysis of our results. The final outcome is compared to recent accurate\nmeasurements as well as the HITRAN2012 database. Transition frequencies are\nobtained from effective Hamiltonian calculations to produce a comprehensive\nline list covering all $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ transitions below 8000 cm$^{-1}$\nand stronger than 10$^{-30}$ cm / molecule at $T=296$~K\n", "  The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological communities\nhave been based on two ecological properties: dynamical stability and\nfeasibility. The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to\nreturn to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species\nabundances, and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific\ninteractions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all\nits constituent species, and is linked to both interspecific interactions and\nspecies demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical\nresearch in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the\ndynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to\nfeasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of\nwhether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be\nstable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use\nempirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the\ndynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we\ndemonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are,\nthe lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without\nlosing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a\ncommunity can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly\nnested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of\na seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (NE\nGreenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species\ninteractions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings\nimply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability,\nwhich may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.\n", "  Some precisions are given about the definition of the Hamiltonian operator H\nand its transformation properties, for a linear wave equation in a general\nspacetime. In the presence of time-dependent unitary gauge transformations, H\nas an operator depends on the gauge choice. The other observables of QM and\ntheir rates also become gauge-dependent unless a proper account for the gauge\nchoice is done in their definition. We show the explicit effect of these\nnon-uniqueness issues in the case of the Dirac equation in a general spacetime\nwith the Schwinger gauge. We show also in detail why, the meaning of the energy\nin QM being inherited from classical Hamiltonian mechanics, the energy operator\nand its mean values ought to be well defined in a general spacetime.\n", "  Generalized derivations, quasiderivations and quasicentroid of $3$-algebras\nare introduced, and basic relations between them are studied. Structures of\nquasiderivations and quasicentroid of $3$-Lie algebras, which contains a\nmaximal diagonalized tours, are systematically investigated. The main results\nare: for all $3$-Lie algebra $A$, 1) the generalized derivation algebra\n$GDer(A)$ is the sum of quasiderivation algebra $QDer(A)$ and quasicentroid\n$Q\\Gamma(A)$; 2) quasiderivations of $A$ can be embedded as derivations in a\nlarger algebra; 3) quasiderivation algebra $QDer(A)$ normalizer quasicentroid,\nthat is, $[QDer(A), Q\\Gamma(A)]\\subseteq Q\\Gamma(A)$; 4) if $A$ contains a\nmaximal diagonalized tours $T$, then $QDer(A)$ and $Q\\Gamma(A)$ are\ndiagonalized $T$-modules, that is, as $T$-modules, $(T, T)$ semi-simplely acts\non $QDer(A)$ and $Q\\Gamma(A)$, respectively.\n", "  We develop a Lie algebraic approach to systematically calculate the evolution\noperator of the generalized two-dimensional quadratic Hamiltonian with\ntime-dependent coefficients. Although the development of the Lie algebraic\napproach presented here is mainly motivated by the two-dimensional quadratic\nHamiltonian, it may be applied to investigate the evolution operators of any\nHamiltonian having a dynamical algebra with a large number of elements. We\nillustrate the method by finding the propagator and the Heisenberg picture\nposition and momentum operators for a two-dimensional charge subject to uniform\nand constant electro-magnetic fields.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-$T_3$ model is characterized by a variable Berry phase that\nchanges continuously from $\\pi$ to $0$. We take advantage of this property to\nhighlight the effects of this underlying geometrical phase on a number of\nphysical quantities. The Hall quantization of the two limiting cases is\ndramatically different - a relativistic series is associated with a Berry phase\nof $\\pi$ and a non-relativistic series is associated with the other limit. We\nstudy the quantization of the Hall plateaux as they continuously evolve from a\nrelativistic to a non-relativistic regime. Additionally, we describe two\nphysical quantities that retain knowledge of the Berry phase, in the absence of\na motion-inducing magnetic field. The variable Berry phase of the\n$\\alpha$-$T_3$ model allows us to explicitly describe the Berry phase\ndependence of the dynamical longitudinal optical conductivity and of the\nangular scattering probability.\n", "  Various models have been proposed in which the Schr\\\"odinger equation is\nmodified to account for a decay of spatial coherences of massive objects. While\noptomechanical systems and matter-wave interferometry with large clusters are\npromising candidates to test these models, we here show that using available\ntechniques for atoms in optical lattices, some of these models can be\nefficiently tested. In particular, we compare unconventional decoherence due to\nquantum gravity as introduced by Ellis and co-workers [Phys. Lett. B ${\\bf\n221}$, 113 (1989)] and conventional decoherence due to scattering of the\nlattice photons and conclude that optimal performances are achieved with a few\natoms in the realistic case where product atomic states are prepared. A\ndetailed analysis shows that a single atom delocalized on a scale of 10 cm for\nabout a second can be used to test efficiently the hypothetical quantum gravity\ninduced decoherence.\n", "  This article presents the applicability of Permutation Entropy based\ncomplexity measure of a time series for detection of fault in wind turbines. A\nset of electrical data from one faulty and one healthy wind turbine were\nanalysed using traditional FastFourier analysis in addition to Permutation\nEntropy analysis to compare the complexity index of phase currents of the two\nturbines over time. The 4 seconds length data set did not reveal any low\nfrequency in the spectra of currents, neither did they show any meaningful\ndifferences of spectrum between the two turbine currents. Permutation Entropy\nanalysis of the current waveforms of same phases for the two turbines are found\nto have different complexity values over time, one of them being clearly higher\nthan the other. The work of Yan et. al. in has found that higher entropy values\nrelated to thepresence of failure in rotary machines in his study. Following\nthis track, further efforts will be put into relating the entropy difference\nfound in our study to possible presence of failure in one of the wind energy\nconversion systems.\n", "  We study the collapsing and subsequent spontaneous twisting of a carbon\nnanotube by in-situ transmission electron microscopy. A custom-sized nanotube\nis first created in the microscope by selectively extracting shells from a\nparent multi-wall tube. The few-wall, large-diameter daughter nanotube is\ndriven to collapse via mechanical stimulation, after which the ribbon-like\ncollapsed tube spontaneously twists along its long axis. In-situ diffraction\nexperiments fully characterize the uncollapsed and collapsed tubes. From the\nexperimental observations and associated theoretical analysis, the origin of\nthe twisting is determined to be compressive strain due to charge imbalance.\n", "  Systems of dynamical interactions between competing species can be used to\nmodel many complex systems, and can be mathematically described by {\\em random}\nnetworks. Understanding how patterns of activity arise in such systems is\nimportant for understanding many natural phenomena. The emergence of patterns\nof activity on complex networks with reaction-diffusion dynamics on the nodes\nis studied here. The connection between solutions with a single activated node,\nwhich can bifurcate from an undifferentiated state, and the fully developed\nsystem-scale patterns are investigated computationally. The different\ncoexisting patterns of activity the network can exhibit are shown to be\nconnected via a snaking type bifurcation structure, similar to those\nresponsible for organising localised pattern formation in regular lattices.\nThese results reveal the origin of the multistable patterns found in systems\norganised on complex networks. A key role is found to be played by nodes with\nso called {\\em optimal degree}, on which the interaction between the reaction\nkinetics and the network structure organise the behaviour of the system. A\nstatistical representation of the density of solutions over the parameter space\nis used as a means to answer important questions about the number of accessible\nstates that can be exhibited in systems with such a high degree of complexity.\n", "  The PAMELA satellite experiment is providing first direct measurements of\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs) with energies from about 80 MeV to several GeV\nin near-Earth space, bridging the low energy data by other space-based\ninstruments and the Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) data by the worldwide\nnetwork of neutron monitors. Its unique observational capabilities include the\npossibility of measuring the flux angular distribution and thus investigating\npossible anisotropies. This work reports the analysis methods developed to\nestimate the SEP energy spectra as a function of the particle pitch-angle with\nrespect to the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) direction. The crucial\ningredient is provided by an accurate simulation of the asymptotic exposition\nof the PAMELA apparatus, based on a realistic reconstruction of particle\ntrajectories in the Earth's magnetosphere. As case study, the results for the\nMay 17, 2012 event are presented.\n", "  Non-linear effects in accelerator physics are important for both successful\noperation of accelerators and during the design stage. Since both of these\naspects are closely related, they will be treated together in this overview.\nSome of the most important aspects are well described by methods established in\nother areas of physics and mathematics. The treatment will be focused on the\nproblems in accelerators used for particle physics experiments. Although the\nmain emphasis will be on accelerator physics issues, some of the aspects of\nmore general interest will be discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that in\nrecent years a framework has been built to handle the complex problems in a\nconsistent form, technically superior and conceptually simpler than the\ntraditional techniques. The need to understand the stability of particle beams\nhas substantially contributed to the development of new techniques and is an\nimportant source of examples which can be verified experimentally.\nUnfortunately, the documentation of these developments is often poor or even\nunpublished, in many cases only available as lectures or conference\nproceedings.\n", "  The fates of planetary systems provide unassailable insights into their\nformation and represent rich cross-disciplinary dynamical laboratories.\nMounting observations of post-main-sequence planetary systems necessitate a\ncomplementary level of theoretical scrutiny. Here, I review the diverse\ndynamical processes which affect planets, asteroids, comets and pebbles as\ntheir parent stars evolve into giant branch, white dwarf and neutron stars.\nThis reference provides a foundation for the interpretation and modelling of\ncurrently known systems and upcoming discoveries.\n", "  Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk\npopulation of the Kuiper belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their\nrespective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put\nforward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can\nsuccessfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show\nthat the orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects cluster not only in argument of\nperihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion\npositions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such\na clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus\nrequiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can\nbe maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass greater than ~10 Earth\nmasses, whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the\ndistant Kuiper belt objects, but whose perihelion is 180 degrees away from the\nperihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed\norbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the\npresence of high perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection\nof high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60 and 150 degrees\nwhose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and\nhighly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing\nour hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of\nthe distant planet.\n", "  We have developed a fully parallel C++/MPI based simulation code for\nvariable-density particle-laden turbulent flows. The fluid is represented\nthrough a uniform Eulerian staggered grid, while particles are modeled using a\nLagrangian point-particle framework. Spatial discretization is second-order\naccurate, and time integration has a fourth-order accuracy. Two-way coupling of\nthe particles with the background flow is considered in both momentum and\nenergy equations. The code is fully modular and abstracted, and easily can be\nextended or modified. We have considered two different boundary conditions. We\nhave also developed a novel parallel linear solver for the variable density\nPoisson equation that arises in the calculation.\n", "  Recent technological advancements have allowed to implement in solid-state\ncavity-based devices phenomena of quantum nature such as vacuum Rabi splitting,\ncontrollable single photon emission and quantum entanglement. For a\nsufficiently strong coupling between a quantum emitter and a cavity, large\nquality factors ($Q$) along with small modal volume ($V_{eff}$) are essential.\nHere we show that by applying a 5nm Al coating to the sidewalls of a\nsubmicrometer-sized Fabry-P\\'{e}rot microcavity, the cavity $Q$ can be\ntemperature-tuned from few hundreds at room temperatures to 2$\\times$10$^5$\nbelow 30~K. This is achieved by, first, a complete shielding of the sidewall\nloss with ideally reflecting lateral metallic mirrors and, secondly, a dramatic\ndecrease of the cavity's axial loss for small-sized devices due to the largely\noff-axis wavevector within the multilayered structure. Our findings offer a\nnovel temperature-tunable platform to study quantum electrodynamical phenomena\nof emitter-cavity coupling. We demonstrate that a Rabi splitting of 2g=24~GHz\n(0.142~nm) can be readily achieved at 40~K in a 0.8$\\mu$m-sized device, which\nhas an $V_{eff}\\approx0.0845~\\mu$m$^3$, comparable to best 2D photonic crystal\n(PhC) nanocavities.\n", "  The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a high-resolution microwave-frequency\ntelescope designed to observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). To date,\ntwo cameras have been installed on the SPT to conduct two surveys of the CMB,\nthe first in intensity only (SPT-SZ) and the second in intensity and\npolarization (SPTpol). A third-generation polarization-sensitive camera is\ncurrently in development (SPT-3G). This thesis describes work spanning all\nthree instruments on the SPT. I present my work in time-reversed order, to\nfollow the canonical narrative of instrument development, deployment, and\nanalysis. First, the development and testing of novel 3-band multichroic\nTransition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers for the SPT-3G experiment is detailed,\nfollowed by the development and deployment of the frequency multiplexed\ncryogenic readout electronics for the SPTpol experiment, and concluding with\nthe analysis of data taken by the SPT-SZ instrument. I describe the development\nof a Bayesian likelihood based method I developed for measuring the integrated\nComptonization (Ysz) of galaxy clusters from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect, and constraining galaxy cluster Ysz-mass scaling relations.\n", "  We investigate introductory physics students' difficulties in translating\nbetween mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of\nscaffolding on students' performance. We gave a typical problem that can be\nsolved using Gauss's law involving a spherically symmetric charge distribution\n(a conducting sphere concentric with a conducting spherical shell) to 95\ncalculus-based introductory physics students. We asked students to write a\nmathematical expression for the electric field in various regions and asked\nthem to graph the electric field. We knew from previous experience that\nstudents have great difficulty in graphing the electric field. Therefore, we\nimplemented two scaffolding interventions to help them. Students who received\nthe scaffolding support were either (1) asked to plot the electric field in\neach region first (before having to plot it as a function of distance from the\ncenter of the sphere) or (2) asked to plot the electric field in each region\nafter explicitly evaluating the electric field at the beginning, mid and end\npoints of each region. The comparison group was only asked to plot the electric\nfield at the end of the problem. We found that students benefited the most from\nintervention (1) and that intervention (2), although intended to aid students,\nhad an adverse effect. Also, recorded interviews were conducted with a few\nstudents in order to understand how students were impacted by the\naforementioned interventions.\n", "  Drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem solving heuristic that can\ntransform a give problem into a representation that is easier to exploit for\nsolving it. A major focus while helping introductory physics students learn\nproblem solving is to help them appreciate that drawing a diagram facilitates\nproblem solution. We conducted an investigation in which 111 students in an\nalgebra-based introductory physics course were subjected to two different\ninterventions during recitation quizzes throughout the semester. They were\neither (1) asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or\n(2) explicitly told to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any\ninstruction regarding diagrams. We developed a rubric to score the\nproblem-solving performance of students in different intervention groups. We\ninvestigated two problems involving electric field and electric force and found\nthat students who draw expert-like diagrams are more successful problem solvers\nand that a higher level of detail in a student's diagram corresponds to a\nbetter score.\n", "  An important goal of graduate physics core courses is to help students\ndevelop expertise in problem solving and improve their reasoning and\nmeta-cognitive skills. We explore the conceptual difficulties of physics\ngraduate students by administering conceptual problems on topics covered in\nundergraduate physics courses before and after instruction in related first\nyear core graduate courses. Here, we focus on physics graduate students'\ndifficulties manifested by their performance on two qualitative problems\ninvolving diagrammatic representation of vector fields. Some graduate students\nhad great difficulty in recognizing whether the diagrams of the vector fields\nhad divergence and/or curl but they had no difficulty computing the divergence\nand curl of the vector fields mathematically. We also conducted individual\ndiscussions with various faculty members who regularly teach first year\ngraduate physics core courses about the goals of these courses and the\nperformance of graduate students on the conceptual problems after related\ninstruction in core courses.\n", "  This document presents the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) put forward by an\ninternational neutrino community to pursue the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF/DUNE), a groundbreaking\nscience experiment for long-baseline neutrino oscillation studies and for\nneutrino astrophysics and nucleon decay searches. The DUNE far detector will be\na very large modular liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) located deep\nunderground, coupled to the LBNF multi-megawatt wide-band neutrino beam. DUNE\nwill also have a high-resolution and high-precision near detector.\n", "  Over the last few years the $R_{\\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe has received a lot\nof attention, particularly when observational evidence seems to favor this over\nthe standard $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda CDM$) universe. Like the\n$\\Lambda CDM$, the $R_{\\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe is based on a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology where the total energy density\n$\\rho$ and pressure $p$ of the cosmic fluid contain a dark energy component\nbesides the usual (dark and baryonic) matter and radiation components. However\nunlike the $\\Lambda CDM$ this model has the simple equation of state (EOS)\n$\\rho + 3p = 0$, i.e., its total active gravitational mass vanishes, which\nwould therefore exclude a cosmological constant as the source of its dark\nenergy component. Faced with this issue, in this paper we examine various\npossible sources for the dark energy component of the $R_{\\mathrm{h}}=ct$\nuniverse and show that quintessence which has been used in other various\ndynamical dark energy models could also be a possible source in this case.\n", "  We describe a novel method for making microbottle-shaped lasers by using a\nCO$_2$ laser to melt Er:Yb glass onto silica microcapillaries or fibres. This\nis realised by the fact that the two glasses have different melting points. The\nCO$_2$ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica\ncylinder. In the case of a capillary, the resulting geometry is a hollow,\nmicrobottle-shaped resonator. This is a simple method for fabricating a number\nof glass WGM lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single, micron-scale\nstructure. The Er:Yb doped glass outer layer is pumped at 980 nm via a tapered\noptical fibre and whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is recorded around 1535\nnm. This structure facilitates a new way to thermo-optically tune the\nmicrolaser modes by passing gas through the capillary. The cooling effect of\nthe gas flow shifts the WGMs towards shorter wavelengths, thus thermal tuning\nof the lasing modes over 70 GHz is achieved. Results are fitted using the\ntheory of hot wire anemometry, allowing the flow rate to be calibrated with a\nflow sensitivity as high as 100 GHz/sccm. Strain tuning of the microlaser modes\nby up to 50 GHz is also demonstrated.\n", "  Cr2AlC materials were irradiated with 7 MeV Xe26+ ions and 500 keV He2+ ions\nat room temperature. A structural transition with an increased c lattice\nparameter and a decreased a lattice parameter occurs after irradiation to doses\nabove 1 dpa. Nevertheless, the modified structure is stable up to the dose of\n5.2 dpa without obvious lattice disorder. The three samples irradiated to doses\nabove 1 dpa have comparable lattice parameters and hardness values, suggesting\na saturation of irradiation effects in Cr2AlC. The structural transition and\nirradiation effects saturation are ascribed to irradiation-induced antisite\ndefects (CrAl and AlCr) and C interstitials, which is supported by the\ncalculations of the formation energies of various defects in Cr2AlC. The\nirradiation-induced antisite defects and C interstitials may be critical to\nunderstand the excellent resistance to irradiation-induced amorphization of MAX\nphases.\n", "  We present a phenomenological model to consider the effect of shape symmetry\nbreaking on the optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots. We compare\nbetween quantum dots with two-fold rotational and two reflections ($C_{2v}$)\nsymmetry and quantum dots in which this symmetry is reduced by perturbation to\none reflection only ($C_{s}$). We show that this symmetry reduction drastically\naffects the optical activity of the dark exciton.\n  In symmetric quantum dots, one of the dark exciton eigenstate is totally dark\nand the other, due to heavy- and light-hole mixing, has a small dipole moment\npolarized along the symmetry axis (growth direction) of the quantum dot. In\nnon-symmetric quantum dots, the two dark excitons' eigenstates are mixed with\nthe bright excitons' eigenstates which have cross-linearly polarized\nperpendicular to the growth direction dipole moments. As a result of this\nmixing one of the dark exciton eigenstate is dark while the other one does have\ndipole moment which is linearly polarized normal to the growth direction, like\nthe lower energy bright exciton eigenstate.\n  Our model agrees well with recently obtained experimental data.\n", "  The intention of this thesis is to provide general tools and concepts that\nallow to perform a mathematically substantiated symmetry reduction in (quantum)\ngauge field theories. Here, the main focus is on the framework of loop quantum\ngravity (LQG), where we concentrate on the reduction of the quantum\nconfiguration space, and the construction of a normalized Radon measures on the\nreduced one. More precisely, we introduce a new way to symmetry reduce the\nLQG-configuration space directly on the quantum level, and then show that this\nalways leads to a (strictly) larger reduced space than quantizing the classical\nconfiguration space of invariant connections (traditional approach). We prove a\ngeneral classification theorem for such invariant connections, which we then\nuse to calculate the classical configuration space for the homogeneous and the\nspherically symmetric case. Here, the backbone of the introduced reduction\nconcept is a lifting result for group actions on sets to spectra of\n$C^*$-subalgebras of the bounded functions thereon; and as a further\napplication of this, we single out the standard kinematical Hilbert space of\nhomogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology by means of the same invariance\ncondition for both the standard configuration space\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$, as well as for the Fleischhack one\n$\\mathbb{R}\\sqcup\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$. Along the way, symmetries of\nembedded analytic curves under a given analytic Lie group action are\ninvestigated, and a first classification result is proven for the case that the\naction is proper or pointwise proper and transitive, and only admits normal\nstabilizers.\n", "  Recent availability of geo-localized data capturing individual human activity\ntogether with the statistical data on international migration opened up\nunprecedented opportunities for a study on global mobility. In this paper we\nconsider it from the perspective of a multi-layer complex network, built using\na combination of three datasets: Twitter, Flickr and official migration data.\nThose datasets provide different but equally important insights on the global\nmobility: while the first two highlight short-term visits of people from one\ncountry to another, the last one - migration - shows the long-term mobility\nperspective, when people relocate for good. And the main purpose of the paper\nis to emphasize importance of this multi-layer approach capturing both aspects\nof human mobility at the same time. So we start from a comparative study of the\nnetwork layers, comparing short- and long- term mobility through the\nstatistical properties of the corresponding networks, such as the parameters of\ntheir degree centrality distributions or parameters of the corresponding\ngravity model being fit to the network. We also focus on the differences in\ncountry ranking by their short- and long-term attractiveness, discussing the\nmost noticeable outliers. Finally, we apply this multi-layered human mobility\nnetwork to infer the structure of the global society through a community\ndetection approach and demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a\nmulti-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way\nmore consistent with other available relevant sources of international\nconnections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network\nlayer taken separately.\n", "  Here we repair the single-layer MoSe2 field-effect transistors by the EDTA\nprocessing, after which the devices' room-temperature carrier mobility\nincreases from 0.1 to over 70cm2/Vs. The atomic dynamics is constructed by the\ncombined study of the first-principle calculation, aberration-corrected\ntransmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Single/double Se\nvacancies are revealed originally, which cause some mid-gap impurity states and\nlocalize the device carriers. They are found repaired with the result of\nimproved electronic transport. Such a picture is confirmed by a 1.5cm-1 red\nshift in the Raman spectra.\n", "  Recently, it has been theoretically predicted that Cd3As2 is a three\ndimensional Dirac material, a new topological phase discovered after\ntopological insulators, which exhibits a linear energy dispersion in the bulk\nwith massless Dirac fermions. Here, we report on the low-temperature\nmagnetoresistance measurements on a ~50nm-thick Cd3As2 film. The weak\nantilocalization under perpendicular magnetic field is discussed based on the\ntwo-dimensional Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) theory. The electron-electron\ninteraction is addressed as the source of the dephasing based on the\ntemperature-dependent scaling behavior. The weak antilocalization can be also\nobserved while the magnetic field is parallel to the electric field due to the\nstrong interaction between the different conductance channels in this\nquasi-two-dimensional film.\n", "  Changing the vocal tract shape is one of the techniques which can be used by\nthe players of wind instruments to modify the quality of the sound. It has been\nintensely studied in the case of reed instruments but has received only little\nattention in the case of air-jet instruments. This paper presents a first study\nfocused on changes in the vocal tract shape in recorder playing techniques.\nMeasurements carried out with recorder players allow to identify techniques\ninvolving changes of the mouth shape as well as consequences on the sound. A\nsecond experiment performed in laboratory mimics the coupling with the vocal\ntract on an artificial mouth. The phase of the transfer function between the\ninstrument and the mouth of the player is identified to be the relevant\nparameter of the coupling. It is shown to have consequences on the spectral\ncontent in terms of energy distribution among the even and odd harmonics, as\nwell as on the stability of the first two oscillating regimes. The results\ngathered from the two experiments allow to develop a simplified model of sound\nproduction including the effect of changing the vocal tract shape. It is based\non the modification of the jet instabilities due to the pulsating emerging jet.\nTwo kinds of instabilities, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with respect to the\nstream axis, are controlled by the coupling with the vocal tract and the\nacoustic oscillation within the pipe, respectively. The symmetry properties of\nthe flow are mapped on the temporal formulation of the source term, predicting\na change in the even / odd harmonics energy distribution. The predictions are\nin qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.\n", "  We demonstrate the ability to control quantum coherent Rabi-oscillations in a\nroom-temperature quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) by shaping\nthe light pulses that trigger them. The experiments described here show that\nwhen the excitation is resonant with the short wavelength slope of the SOA gain\nspectrum, a linear frequency chirp affects its ability to trigger\nRabi-oscillations within the SOA: A negative chirp inhibits Rabi-oscillations\nwhereas a positive chirp can enhance them, relative to the interaction of a\ntransform limited pulse. The experiments are confirmed by a numerical\ncalculation that models the propagation of the experimentally shaped pulses\nthrough the SOA.\n", "  We present a comprehensive model for predicting the full performance of a\nsecond harmonic generationoptical parametric amplification system that aims at\nenhancing the temporal contrast of laser pulses. The model simultaneously takes\ninto account all the main parameters at play in the system such as the group\nvelocity mismatch, the beam divergence, the spectral content, the pump\ndepletion, and the length of the nonlinear crystals. We monitor the influence\nof the initial parameters of the input pulse and the interdependence of the two\nrelated non-linear processes on the performance of the system and show its\noptimum configuration. The influence of the initial beam divergence on the\nspectral and the temporal characteristics of the generated pulse is discussed.\nIn addition, we show that using a crystal slightly longer than the optimum\nlength and introducing small delay between the seed and the pump ensures\nmaximum efficiency and compensates for the spectral shift in the optical\nparametric amplification stage in case of chirped input pulse. As an example,\ncalculations for bandwidth transform limited and chirped pulses of\nsub-picosecond duration in beta barium borate crystal are presented.\n", "  Let $C$ be a crystal and $\\phi$ be a periodic realization of it in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, also let $L$ be the lattice group of $\\phi(C)$ which preserves\nthe covering space nature of crystal lattices. In this article, firstly, we\ndefine the concept of acoustic spectrum of the crystal lattice C and then\nprovide the algebraic formalism of the question of finding the frequencies of\nthe torus $\\mathbb{R}^n/L$, when the set of acoustic spectrum is known. An\nanswer for crystals with uniform atomic force constants is given.\n", "  Oxide interfaces provide an opportunity for electronics. However, patterning\nof electron gases at complex oxide interfaces is challenging. In particular,\npatterning of complex oxides while preserving a high electron mobility remains\nunderexplored and inhibits the study of quantum mechanical effects where\nextended electron mean free paths are paramount. This letter presents an\neffective patterning strategy of both the amorphous-LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$\n(a-LAO/STO) and modulation-doped amorphous-\nLaAlO$_3$/La$_{7/8}$Sr$_{1/8}$MnO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (a-LAO/LSM/STO) oxide\ninterfaces. Our patterning is based on selective wet etching of amorphous-LSM\n(a-LSM) thin films which acts as a hard mask during subsequent depositions.\nStrikingly, the patterned modulation-doped interface shows electron mobilities\nup to ~8,700 cm$^2$/Vs at 2 K, which is among the highest reported values for\npatterned conducting complex oxide interfaces that usually are ~1,000 cm$^2$/Vs\nat 2 K.\n", "  Hybrid systems of excitons strongly coupled to localized surface plasmons\nsupported by metallic nanoparticles define a new approach to control\nlight-matter interactions. Here, we report exciton-plasmon coupling in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, hybridized with\nsilver nanoparticles. Prominent photoluminescence enhancement in monolayer MoS2\nwas observed with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) tuned to the\nexciton resonance. By tuning the excitation energy, the contributions from near\nfield enhancement and radiative emission rate enhancement via Purcell effect\nwere resolved. Strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling between excitons and LSPR\nin resonant condition manifests as an electromagnetically induced transparency\nwindow in the extinction spectra of the localized surface plasmon. In this\nstrong coupling regime a new quasi-particle, known as a plexciton, is expected\nto exhibit distinct properties, which exist in neither of the original\nparticles. Our results demonstrate that 2D semiconductors hybridized with\nplasmonic structures not only hold great promise in the applications of\nenergy-harvesting and light-emitting devices, but also provide an attractive\nplatform for fundamental investigations of exciton-plasmon interactions in the\nstrong coupling regime.\n", "  We analyse the existing derivation of the models of non-linear acoustics such\nas the Kuznetsov equation, the NPE equation and the KZK equation. The technique\nof introducing a corrector in the derivation ansatz allows to consider the\nsolutions of these equations as approximations of the solution of the initial\nsystem (a com-pressible Navier-Stokes/Euler system). The validation of the\napproximation ansatz is given for the KZK equation case.\n", "  We will present a method for building a consistent AQFT on Schwarzschild\nspacetime for a thermal system ruled by an interacting and massive scalar\nfield, extending the methods and the results of K. Fredenhagen and F. Lindner\nvalid for the flat case. In particular we will discuss the asymptotic\nproperties of the two-point function of a thermal (KMS) state in order to\nobtain finite expectation values for the observables of the theory.\n", "  Networks constitute efficient tools for assessing universal features of\ncomplex systems. In physical contexts, classical as well as quantum, networks\nare used to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as phase transitions,\nintricate aspects of many-body quantum systems or even characteristic features\nof a future quantum internet. Random quantum networks and their associated\ndirected graphs are employed for capturing statistically dominant features of\ncomplex quantum systems. Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable\nof evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven\nthat random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are\ntypically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by\na directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is\nexploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of\nlarge random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of\nthe details of the network topology. These findings suggest that also other\nhighly complex networks, such as a future quantum internet, may exhibit similar\nuniversal properties.\n", "  We report numerical and experimental studies of dissipative-soliton-resonance\n(DSR) in a fiber laser with a nonlinear optical loop mirror. The DSR pulse\npresents temporally a flat-top profile and a clamped peak power. Its spectrum\nhas a rectangle profile with characteristic steep edges. It shows a unique\nbehavior as pulse energy increases: The rectangle part of the spectrum is\nunchanged while the newly emerging spectrum sits on the center part and forms a\npeak. Experimental observations match well with the numerical results.\nMoreover, compression of the DSR pulses is both numerically and experimentally\ndemonstrated for the first time. An experimentally obtained DSR pulse of 63 ps\nduration is compressed down to 760 fs, with low-intensity pedestals using a\ngrating pair. Before being compressed to its narrowest width, the pulse firstly\nevolves into a cat-ear profile, and the corresponding autocorrelation trace\nshows a crown shape, which distinguishes itself from properties of other\nsolitons formed in fiber lasers.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior of ground state energy for\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson-Slater energy functional. We show that ground state\nenergy restricted to radially symmetric functions is above the ground state\nenergy when the number of particles is sufficiently large.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere\ndescribed as a particular multitrace matrix model. We consider perturbative and\nnonperturbative terms in the kinetic term effective action and describe\nconsequences for the asymmetric regime, the free energy and the location of the\ntriple point within the approximation.\n", "  Mechanism of solute-enriched clusters formation in neutron-irradiated\npressure vessel steels is proposed and developed in case of Fe-Cu model alloys.\nWe show that the obtained results are in a good agreement with available\nexperimental data on the parameters of clusters enriched with the alloying\nelements. The suggested solute-drag mechanism is analogous to the well-known\nzone-refining process. Our model explains why the formation of solute-enriched\nclusters does not happen in austenitic stainless steels with fcc lattice\nstructure. It also allows to quantify the method of evaluation of neutron\nirradiation dose for the process of RPV steels hardening.\n", "  Roughly half of the heavy elements (atomic mass greater than that of iron)\nare believed to be synthesized in the late evolutionary stages of stars with\nmasses between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly\niron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the\nslow-neutron-capture process, or s-process) heavier elements that are\nsubsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources,\nactivated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: 13C and 22Ne, each\nreleasing one neutron per alpha-particle (4He) captured. To explain the\nmeasured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the 13C neutron\nsource (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are\nfavoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting\nnucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material\nto the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred\nmillion kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of 22Ne. Here we report a\ndetermination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant\nstars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar\nevolution models. The derived temperature supports 13C as the s-process neutron\nsource. The radioactive pair 93Zr-93Nb used to estimate the s-process\ntemperature also provides, together with the pair 99Tc-99Ru, chronometric\ninformation on the time elapsed since the start of the s-process, which we\ndetermine to be one million to three million years.\n", "  We present an approach for the visualisation of a set of time series that\ncombines an echo state network with an autoencoder. For each time series in the\ndataset we train an echo state network, using a common and fixed reservoir of\nhidden neurons, and use the optimised readout weights as the new\nrepresentation. Dimensionality reduction is then performed via an autoencoder\non the readout weight representations. The crux of the work is to equip the\nautoencoder with a loss function that correctly interprets the reconstructed\nreadout weights by associating them with a reconstruction error measured in the\ndata space of sequences. This essentially amounts to measuring the predictive\nperformance that the reconstructed readout weights exhibit on their\ncorresponding sequences when plugged back into the echo state network with the\nsame fixed reservoir. We demonstrate that the proposed visualisation framework\ncan deal both with real valued sequences as well as binary sequences. We derive\nmagnification factors in order to analyse distance preservations and\ndistortions in the visualisation space. The versatility and advantages of the\nproposed method are demonstrated on datasets of time series that originate from\ndiverse domains.\n", "  The goal of this work is studying the evolution of thermoelectric transport\nacross the members of the Ruddlesden-Popper series iridates Srn+1IrnO3n+1,\nwhere a metal-insulator transition driven by bandwidth change occurs, from the\nstrongly insulating Sr2IrO4 to the metallic non Fermi liquid behavior of\nSrIrO3. Sr2IrO4 (n=1), Sr3Ir2O7 (n=2) and SrIrO3 (n=inf.) polycrystals are\nsynthesized at high pressure and characterized by structural, magnetic,\nelectric and thermoelectric transport analyses. We find a complex\nthermoelectric phenomenology in the three compounds. Thermal diffusion of\ncharge carriers accounts for the Seebeck behavior of Sr2IrO4, whereas\nadditional drag mechanisms come into play in determining the Seebeck\ntemperature dependence of Sr3Ir2O7 and SrIrO3. These findings reveal close\nrelationship between magnetic, electronic and thermoelectric properties, strong\ncoupling of charge carriers with phonons and spin fluctuations as well as\nrelevance of multiband description in these compounds.\n", "  The dynamics of fluctuations in a fast rotating spherical Couette flow\nexperiment in the presence of a strong dipolar magnetic field is investigated\nin detail, through a thorough analysis of the experimental data as well as a\nnumerical study. Fluctuations within the conducting fluid (liquid sodium) are\ncharacterized by the presence of several oscillation modes, identified as\nmagneto-Coriolis (MC) modes, with definite symmetry and azimuthal number. A\nnumerical simulation provides eigensolutions which exhibit oscillation\nfrequencies and magnetic signature comparable to the observation. The main\ncharacteristics of these hydromagnetic modes is that the magnetic contribution\nhas a fundamental influence on the dynamical properties through the Lorentz\nforces, although its importance remains weak in an energetical point of view.\nAnother specificity is that the Lorentz forces are confined near the inner\nsphere where the dipolar magnetic field is the strongest, while the Coriolis\nforces are concentrated in the outer fluid volume close to the outer sphere.\n", "  The Carrington storm in 1859 is considered to be the major geomagnetic\ndisturbance related to solar activity. In a recent paper, Cid et al. (2015)\ndiscovered a geomagnetic disturbance case with a profile extraordinarily\nsimilar to the disturbance of the Carrington event at Colaba, but at a\nmid-latitude observatory, leading to a re- interpretation of the 1859 event.\nBased on those results, this paper performs a deep search for other\n'Carrington-like' events and analyses interplanetary observations leading to\nthe ground disturbances which emerged from the systematic analysis. The results\nof this study based on two Carrington-like events (1) reinforce the awareness\nabout the possibility of missing hazardous space weather events as the large\nH-spike recorded at Colaba by using global geomagnetic indices, (2) argue\nagainst the role of the ring current as the major current involved in\nCarrington-like events, leaving field- aligned currents (FACs) as the main\ncurrent involved, and (3) propose abrupt southward reversals of IMF along with\nhigh solar wind pressure as the interplanetary trigger of a Carrington-like\nevent.\n", "  In the context of relativistic positioning, the coordinates of a given user\nmay be calculated by using suitable information broadcast by a 4-tuple of\nsatellites. Our 4-tuples belong to the Galileo constellation. Recently, we\nestimated the positioning errors due to uncertainties in the satellite world\nlines (U-errors). A distribution of U-errors was obtained, at various times, in\na set of points covering a large region surrounding Earth. Here, the\npositioning errors associated to the simplifying assumption that photons move\nin Minkowski space-time (S-errors) are estimated and compared with the\nU-errors. Both errors have been calculated for the same points and times to\nmake comparisons possible. For a certain realistic modeling of the world line\nuncertainties, the estimated S-errors have proved to be smaller than the\nU-errors, which shows that the approach based on the assumption that the\nEarth's gravitational field produces negligible effects on photons may be used\nin a large region surrounding Earth. The applicability of this approach -which\nsimplifies numerical calculations- to positioning problems, and the usefulness\nof our S-error maps, are pointed out. A better approach, based on the\nassumption that photons move in the Schwarzschild space-time governed by an\nidealized Earth, is also analyzed. More accurate descriptions of photon\npropagation involving non symmetric space-time structures are not necessary for\nordinary positioning and spacecraft navigation around Earth.\n", "  We construct an aggregation process of chordal SLE(\\kappa) excursions in the\nunit disk, starting from the boundary, growing towards all inner points\nsimultaneously, invariant under all conformal self-maps of the disk. We prove\nthat this conformal growth process of excursions, abbreviated as CGE(\\kappa),\nexists iff \\kappa\\in [0,4), and that it does not create additional fractalness:\nthe Hausdorff dimension of the closure of all the SLE(\\kappa) arcs attached is\n1+\\kappa/8 almost surely. We determine the dimension of points that are\napproached by CGE(\\kappa) at an atypical rate, and construct conformally\ninvariant random fields on the disk based on CGE(\\kappa).\n", "  We present a lattice QCD calculation of transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions (TMDs) of protons using staple-shaped Wilson lines. For\ntime-reversal odd observables, we calculate the generalized Sivers and\nBoer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts in SIDIS and DY cases, and for T-even\nobservables we calculate the transversity related to the tensor charge and the\ngeneralized worm-gear shift. The calculation is done on two different n_f=2+1\nensembles: domain-wall fermion (DWF) with lattice spacing 0.084 fm and pion\nmass of 297 MeV, and clover fermion with lattice spacing 0.114 fm and pion mass\nof 317 MeV. The results from those two different discretizations are consistent\nwith each other.\n", "  Using the 2D Ising model we study the generic properties of nucleation in\nhydrophobic nanopores. To explore the pathways to nucleation of a spin-up phase\nfrom a metastable spin-down phase we perform umbrella sampling and transition\npath sampling simulations. We find that for narrow pores the nucleation occurs\non the surface outside the pore. For wide pores the nucleation starts in the\npore, and continues outside the filled pore. Intriguingly, we observe a pore\nemptying transition for a range of intermediate pore widths: a pre-critical\nnucleus fills the pore, continues to expand outside of the filled pore, but\nthen suddenly gets expelled from the pore before reaching its critical size.\n", "  Even among the brigher cataclysmic variables an appreciable number of objects\nexist about which not much is known. One of them, MU Cen, was observed as part\nof a small project to better characterize these neglected systems. The temporal\nvariations of the brightness of MU Cen during quiescence were studied in order\nto find clues to the structure of the system and its behaviour on time scales\nof hours and shorter. Light curves observed in white light at a time resolution\nof a few seconds and with a duration of several hours, obtained in six nights\nand spanning a total time base of five months, were investigated using\ndifferent time series analysis tools, as well as model fits. The light curve of\nMU Cen is dominated by ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star. The\nrefined orbital period is P(orb) = 0.341883 days. Model fits permit to\nconstrain the temperature of the secondary star to ~5000 K and the orbital\ninclination to 50 deg <= i \\<= 65 deg. The latter result permits estimates of\nthe component masses which are probably somewhat smaller that derived in\nprevious publications. A second persistent period of P(2) = 0.178692 days was\nalso identified. Its origin remains unclear. As all cataclysmic variables, MU\nCen exhibits flickering, however, on a rather low level. Its frequency\nbehaviouris normal for quiescent dwarf novae. There are indications that the\nindividual flickering events are not always independent but can lead to effects\nreminiscent of quasi-periodic oscillations.\n", "  The compression behavior of zircon-type samarium orthovanadate, SmVO4, has\nbeen investigated using synchrotron-based powder x-ray diffraction and\nab-initio calculations up to 21 GPa. The results indicate the instability of\nambient zircon phase at around 6 GPa, which transforms to a high-density\nscheelite-type phase. The high-pressure phase remains stable up to 21 GPa, the\nhighest pressure reached in the present investigations. On pressure release,\nthe scheelite phase is recovered. Crystal structure of high-pressure phase and\nequations of state (EOS) for the zircon- and scheelite-type phases have been\ndetermined. Various compressibilities such as bulk, axial and bond, estimated\nfrom the experimental data are found to be in good agreement with the results\nobtained from theoretical calculations. Calculated elastic constants show that\nthe zircon structure becomes mechanically unstable beyond the transition\npressure. Overall there is good agreement between experimental and theoretical\nfindings.\n", "  We investigate gravity as a gauge theory in the language of fiber bundles\nwith tools from algebraic geometry. Compelled by the construction of the\nEilenberg-MacLane classifying space via Fox derivations in an integral group\nring, the origin of locally curved spacetime as a an abelian group extension is\nsought algebraically by means of a suitable derivation rule that conforms with\nthe algebraic content of Einstein's equation. Accordingly, a peculiar flavor of\nbackground independence is advanced, curved spacetime should be thought of as\nan abelian proxy for the Lorentz group, causal and spin throughout. Thus,\ndiffeomorphism invariance amounts to \"choosing\" an appropriate\nalgebro-geometric--differential tool as to make algebraic sense of Einstein's\nequation or of a sensible evolution of such an equation. In this regard, it is\nsuggested that a left-$\\alpha$ derivation rule may facilitate the construction.\nOn the other hand, we are led to interpret \"spacetime curvature\" in the broad\nsense of the exterior covariant derivative of a Cartan connection which\nincludes both the torsion of the vierbein as well as the standard curvature of\nthe spin connection. Making manifest use of the index structure in the standard\nHilbert action--in particular, the distinction between internal and external\nindices--inclusion of the torsion 2-form is found to be inconsistent with\ncontraction of the spacetime curvature as a scalar density. Aiming to erect a\ngeometrically justified gravitational action that incorporates torsion, we lay\nout several fundamental geometric, differential and algebraic building blocks\nwhile highlighting descent relations among the different pieces. The groundwork\nis thus laid out for the search of the sought after action functional.\n", "  We review the Four-Dimensional-Formulation variant of the\nFour-Dimensional-Helicity scheme, by showing two applications of this\nregularisation scheme. The first one is the computation of one-loop helicity\namplitudes, for which we present preliminary results for the analytic\nexpressions of the one-loop Higgs plus five- gluon amplitudes. In the second\npart, we study the Colour-Kinematics duality for off-shell diagrams in gauge\ntheories coupled to matter, showing in a diagrammatic way that the Jacobi\nrelations for the kinematic numerators of off-shell diagrams, built with\nFeynman rules in axial gauge, reduce to definite set of violating terms due to\nthe contributions of sub-graphs only.\n", "  Even within the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) it\nis possible to induce sfermion flavor mixing through the Renormalization Group\nEquations (RGE) when the full structure of the Yukawa couplings is considered.\nWe analyse the impact of including those effects on the accurate computation of\n$B$-physics observables, electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs\nboson mass predictions.\n", "  Let $M=SO(1,4)/SO(1,3)\\simeq S^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ (a parallelizable\nmanifold) be a submanifold in the structure $(\\mathring{M}%\n,\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}})$ (hereafter called the bulk) where $\\mathring\n{M}\\simeq\\mathbb{R}^{5}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}}$ is a pseudo Euclidian\nmetric of signature $(1,4)$. Let $\\boldsymbol{i}:M\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{5}$ be\nthe inclusion map and let \\ $\\boldsymbol{g}=\\boldsymbol{i}^{\\ast\n}\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}}$ be the pullback metric on $M$. It has signature\n$(1,3)$ Let $\\boldsymbol{D}$ be the Levi-Civita connection of $\\boldsymbol{g}%\n$. We call the structure $(M,\\boldsymbol{g})$ a de Sitter manifold and\n$M^{dSL}=(M=\\mathbb{R\\times}S^{3},\\boldsymbol{g},\\boldsymbol{D},\\tau\n_{\\boldsymbol{g}},\\uparrow)$ a de Sitter spacetime structure, which is \\ of\ncourse orientable by $\\tau_{\\boldsymbol{g}}\\in\\sec% %TCIMACRO{\\tbigwedge\n\\nolimits^{4}}% %BeginExpansion {\\textstyle\\bigwedge\\nolimits^{4}}\n%EndExpansion T^{\\ast}M$ and time orientable (by $\\uparrow$).\\ Under these\nconditions we prove that if the motion of a free particle moving on $M$ happens\nwith constant \\emph{bulk} angular momentum then its motion in the structure\n$M^{dSL}$ is a timelike geodesic. Also any geodesic motion in the structure\n$M^{dSL}$ implies that the particle has constant angular momentum in the bulk.\n", "  We use sub-Kelvin scanning tunneling spectroscopy to investigate the\nsuppression of superconductivity in homogeneously disordered ultrathin MoC\nfilms. We observe that the superconducting state remains spatially homogeneous\neven on the films of 3 nm thickness. The vortex imaging suggests the global\nphase coherence in our films. Upon decreasing thickness, when the\nsuperconducting transition drops from 8.5 to 1.2 K, the superconducting energy\ngap follows perfectly Tc. All this is pointing to a two-stage fermionic\nscenario of the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) via a metallic state\nas an alternative to the direct bosonic SIT scenario with a Cooper-pair\ninsulating state evidenced by the last decade STM experiments.\n", "  Statistical parametric models are proposed to explain the values of the\nPlanck constant obtained by comparing electrical and mechanical powers and by\ncounting atoms in Si 28 enriched crystals. They assume that uncertainty\ncontributions -- having heterogeneous, datum-specific, variances -- might not\nbe included in the error budgets of some of the measured values. Model\nselection and model averaging are used to investigate data consistency, to\nidentify a reference value of the Planck constant, and to include the model\nuncertainty in the error budget.\n", "  We consider a fully inhomogeneous stochastic higher spin six vertex model in\na quadrant. For this model we derive concise integral representations for\nmulti-point q-moments of the height function and for the q-correlation\nfunctions. At least in the case of the step initial condition, our formulas\ndegenerate in appropriate limits to many known formulas of such type for\nintegrable probabilistic systems in the (1+1)d KPZ universality class,\nincluding the stochastic six vertex model, ASEP, various q-TASEPs, and\nassociated zero range processes.\n  Our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric\nrational functions which can be defined as partition functions of the\ninhomogeneous higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains. In the\nhomogeneous case, such functions were previously studied in\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0976; they also generalize classical Hall-Littlewood\nand Schur polynomials. A key role is played by Cauchy-like summation identities\nfor these functions, which are obtained as a direct corollary of the\nYang-Baxter equation for the higher spin six vertex model.\n", "  We perform all-electron path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and density\nfunctional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) calculations to explore warm\ndense matter states of oxygen. Our simulations cover a wide density-temperature\nrange of $1-100$~g$\\,$cm$^{-3}$ and $10^4-10^9$~K. By combining results from\nPIMC and DFT-MD, we are able to compute pressures and internal energies from\nfirst-principles at all temperatures and provide a coherent equation of state.\nWe compare our first-principles calculations with analytic equations of state,\nwhich tend to agree for temperatures above 8$\\times$10$^6$~K. Pair-correlation\nfunctions and the electronic density of states reveal an evolving plasma\nstructure and ionization process that is driven by temperature and density. As\nwe increase the density at constant temperature, we find that the ionization\nfraction of the 1s state decreases while the other electronic states move\ntowards the continuum. Finally, the computed shock Hugoniot curves show an\nincrease in compression as the first and second shells are ionized.\n", "  The strong coupling between an intersubband excitation in a quantum cascade\nstructure and a photonic mode of a planar microcavity has been detected by\nangle-resolved photovoltaic measurements. A typical anticrossing behavior, with\na vacuum-field Rabi splitting of 16 meV at 78K, has been measured, for an\nintersubband transition at 163 meV. These results show that the strong coupling\nregime between photons and intersubband excitations can be engineered in a\nquantum cascade opto-electronic device. They also demonstrate the possibility\nto perform angle-resolved mid-infrared photodetection and to develop active\ndevices based on intersubband cavity polaritons.\n"]}
