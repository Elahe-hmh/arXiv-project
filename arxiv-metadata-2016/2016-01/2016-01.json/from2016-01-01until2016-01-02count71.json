We construct a suitable scaling limit by using a\ndiscrete harmonic map. As we shall observe, the quasi-linear parabolic equation\nin the limit is defined on a flat torus and depends on both the local structure\nof the crystal lattice and the discrete harmonic map. We formulate the local\nergodic theorem on the crystal lattice by introducing the notion of local\nfunction bundle, which is a family of local functions on the configuration\nspace. The ideas and methods are taken from the discrete geometric analysis to\nthese problems. Results we obtain are extensions of ones by Kipnis, Olla and\nVaradhan to crystal lattices.\n", "  Motivated by recent work on entanglement-assisted codes for sending messages\nover classical channels, the larger, easily characterised class of\nnon-signalling codes is defined. Analysing the optimal performance of these\ncodes yields an alternative proof of the finite block length converse of\nPolyanskiy, Poor and Verd\\'u, and shows that they achieve this converse. This\nprovides an explicit formulation of the converse as a linear program which has\nsome useful features. For discrete memoryless channels, it is shown that\nnon-signalling codes attain the channel capacity with zero error probability if\nand only if the dispersion of the channel is zero.\n", "  We derive upper bounds on the rate of transmission of classical information\nover quantum channels by block codes with a given blocklength and error\nprobability, for both entanglement-assisted and unassisted codes, in terms of a\nunifying framework of quantum hypothesis testing with restricted measurements.\nOur bounds do not depend on any special property of the channel (such as\nmemorylessness) and generalise both a classical converse of Polyanskiy, Poor,\nand Verd\\'{u} as well as a quantum converse of Renner and Wang, and have a\nnumber of desirable properties. In particular our bound on\nentanglement-assisted codes is a semidefinite program and for memoryless\nchannels its large blocklength limit is the well known formula for\nentanglement-assisted capacity due to Bennett, Shor, Smolin and Thapliyal.\n", "  We use the holographic hardwall model to calculate the masses of light\nglueball states with odd spin and P= C= -1 associated with odderons.\nConsidering Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions we obtain expressions for\nthe odderon Regge trajectories consistent with those calculated using other\napproaches.\n", "  We concentrate on calculation of the shear and bulk viscosities of the hadron\ngas. They define its dissipative dynamics and influence its experimentally\nmeasurable elliptic flow. Due to difficulty of this calculation the relaxation\ntime approximation (RTA) was used in previous works. As those results have\napproached the realistic ones, there is a need to find out how accurate the RTA\nis. For this sake we calculate the viscosities in the RTA using cross sections\nextracted from the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model\nand compare them with the same ones calculated without the RTA. This allows us\nto find the estimates of errors due to the application of RTA in the\ncalculations of the viscosities, which are valid also for other similar models.\nFor instance, in the temperature region $100 MeV \\lesssim T \\lesssim 160 MeV$\nat zero chemical potentials the shear viscosity becomes smaller up to $1.57$\ntimes, or up to $1.45$ times if the averaged relaxation time is used. This has\nimportant consequences for interpretation of the previously made calculations\nof the viscosities and some other related calculations. Within the RTA, we also\nfind estimation of the enhancement of the bulk viscosity of the hadron gas\nbecause of nonconservation of particle numbers. This is a little more extended\nversion in compare to the published paper, where we were limited in paper's\nsize and time.\n", "  We derive one-shot upper bounds for quantum noisy channel codes. We do so by\nregarding a channel code as a bipartite operation with an encoder belonging to\nthe sender and a decoder belonging to the receiver, and imposing constraints on\nthe bipartite operation. We investigate the power of codes whose bipartite\noperation is non-signalling from Alice to Bob, positive-partial transpose (PPT)\npreserving, or both, and derive a simple semidefinite program for the\nachievable entanglement fidelity. Using the semidefinite program, we show that\nthe non-signalling assisted quantum capacity for memoryless channels is equal\nto the entanglement-assisted capacity. We also relate our PPT-preserving codes\nand the PPT-preserving entanglement distillation protocols studied by Rains.\nApplying these results to a concrete example, the 3-dimensional Werner-Holevo\nchannel, we find that codes that are non-signalling and PPT-preserving can be\nstrictly less powerful than codes satisfying either one of the constraints, and\ntherefore provide a tighter bound for unassisted codes. Furthermore,\nPPT-preserving non-signalling codes can send one qubit perfectly over two uses\nof the channel, which has no quantum capacity. We discuss whether this can be\ninterpreted as a form of superactivation of quantum capacity.\n", "  We study heat transfers in a single level quantum dot strongly coupled to\nfermionic reservoirs and subjected to a time-dependent protocol modulating the\ndot energy as well as the dot-reservoir coupling strength. The dynamics is\ndescribed using nonequilibrium Greens functions (NEGFs) evaluated to first\norder beyond quasi-static driving. We show that any heat definition expressed\nas an energy change in the reservoir energy plus any fraction of the\nsystem-reservoir interaction is not an exact differential when evaluated along\nreversible isothermal transformations, except when that fraction is zero.\nHowever, even in that latter case the reversible heat divided by temperature,\nnamely the entropy, does not satisfy the third law of thermodynamics and\ndiverges in the low temperature limit. Our results cast doubts on the\npossibility to define a thermodynamically consistent notion of heat expressed\nas the expectation value of some Hamiltonian terms.\n", "  The semileptonic decays $B_c^+\\rightarrow P(V) +\\ell^++\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ and\nthe nonleptonic decays $B_c^+\\rightarrow P(V)+L$, where $P(V)$ denotes a\npseudoscalar (vector) charmonium or ($\\bar{b}s$)-meson, and $L$ denotes a light\nmeson, are studied in the framework of improved instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter\n(BS) equation and the Mandelstam formula. The numerical results (width and\nbranching ratio of the decays) are presented in tables, and in order to compare\nconveniently, those obtained by other approaches are also put in the relevant\ntables. Based on the fact that the ratio\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\pi^+)}{\\mathcal{BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi \\pi^+)}=0.24^{+0.023}_{-0.040}$ estimated here is in good agreement with\nthe observation by the LHCb $\\frac{\\mathcal{BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)\\pi^+)}{\\mathcal{BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow J/\\psi\n\\pi^+)}=0.250\\pm0.068(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm0.014(\\mathrm{syst})\\pm0.006(\\mathcal{B})$,\none may conclude that with respect to the decays the present framework works\nquite well.\n", "  In this paper we discuss phase transition of the charged topological dilaton\nAdS black holes by Maxwell equal area law. The two phases involved in the phase\ntransition could be coexist and we depict the coexistence region in $P-v$\ndiagrams. The two-phase equilibrium curves in $P-T$ diagrams are plotted, the\nClapeyron equation for the black hole is derived, and the latent heat of\nisothermal phase transition is investigated. We also analyze of the parameters\nof the black hole that have an effect on the two phases coexistence. The\nresults show that the black hole may go through a small-large phase transition\nsimilar to those of usual non-gravity thermodynamic systems.\n", "  The usual derivation of the Lagrangian of a model for massive vector bosons,\nby spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge theory, implies that the prefactors\nof the various interaction terms are uniquely determined functions of the\ncoupling constant(s) and the masses. Since, under the renormalization group\n(RG) flow, different interaction terms get different loop-corrections, it is\nuncertain, whether these functions remain fixed under this flow. We investigate\nthis question for the $U(1)$-Higgs-model to 1-loop order in the framework of\nEpstein-Glaser renormalization. Our main result reads: choosing the\nrenormalization mass scale(s) in a way corresponding to the minimal subtraction\nscheme, the geometrical interpretation as a spontaneously broken gauge theory\ngets lost under the RG-flow. This holds also for the clearly stronger property\nof BRST-invariance of the Lagrangian. On the other hand we prove that physical\nconsistency, which is a weak form of BRST-invariance of the time-ordered\nproducts, is maintained under the RG-flow.\n", "  Theories of galaxy formation predict the existence of extended gas halo\naround spiral galaxies. If there are 10-100 nG magnetic fields at several ten\nkpc distances from the galaxies, extended galactic cosmic ray (CR) haloes could\nalso exist. Galactic CRs can interact with the tenuous hot halo gas to produce\nobservable gamma-rays. We have performed search for a gamma-ray halo around the\nM31 galaxy -- the closest large spiral galaxy. Our analysis of almost 7 years\nof the Fermi LAT data revealed the presence of a spatially extended diffuse\nemission excess around M31. The data can be fitted using the simplest\nmorphology of a uniformly bright circle. The best fit gave a 4.7$\\sigma$\nsignificance for a $0.9^{\\circ}$ (12 kpc) halo with a photon flux of $\\sim\n(3.2\\pm1.0)\\times 10^{-9} ~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ and a luminosity of\n$(4.0\\pm1.5)\\times 10^{38} ~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ in the energy range 0.3--100\nGeV. Our results also imply a low level of the flux from the disc of the M31\ngalaxy $(3.3 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{-10}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. The\ncorresponding gamma-ray luminosity, $5\\times10^{37} ~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ is\nseveral times smaller than the luminosity of the Milky Way. This difference\ncould be explained by a lower star formation rate in M31: there are less CRs\nand the level of the ISM turbulence is lower, which in turn leads to a shorter\ntime of CR containment.\n", "  We study the post-Newtonian expansion of a class of Lorentz-violating gravity\ntheories that reduce to khronometric theory (i.e. the infrared limit of Horava\ngravity) in high-acceleration regimes, and reproduce the phenomenology of the\nmodified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the low-acceleration, non-relativistic\nlimit. Like in khronometric theory, Lorentz symmetry is violated in these\ntheories by introducing a dynamical scalar field (the \"khronon\") whose gradient\nis enforced to be timelike. As a result, hypersurfaces of constant khronon\ndefine a preferred foliation of the spacetime, and the khronon can be thought\nof as a physical absolute time. The MOND phenomenology arises as a result of\nthe presence, in the action, of terms depending on the acceleration of the\ncongruence orthogonal to the preferred foliation. We find that if the theory is\nforced to reduce exactly to General Relativity (rather than to khronometric\ntheory) in the high-acceleration regime, the post-Newtonian expansion breaks\ndown at low accelerations, and the theory becomes strongly coupled.\nNevertheless, we identify a sizeable region of the parameter space where the\npost-Newtonian expansion remains perturbative for all accelerations, and the\ntheory passes both solar-system and pulsar gravity tests, besides producing a\nMOND phenomenology for the rotation curves of galaxies. We illustrate this\nexplicitly with a toy model of a system containing only baryonic matter but no\nDark Matter.\n", "  We provide a general and consistent formulation for linear subsystem quantum\ndynamical maps, developed from a minimal set of postulates, primary among which\nis a relaxation of the usual, restrictive assumption of uncorrelated initial\nsystem-bath states. We describe the space of possibilities admitted by this\nformulation, namely that, far from being limited to only completely positive\n(CP) maps, essentially any $\\mathbb{C}$-linear, Hermiticity-preserving,\ntrace-preserving subsystem map can arise as a legitimate subsystem dynamical\nmap from a joint unitary evolution of a system coupled to a bath. The price\npaid for this added generality is a trade-off between the set of admissible\ninitial states and the allowed set of joint system-bath unitary evolutions. As\nan application we present a simple example of a non-CP map constructed as a\nsubsystem dynamical map that violates some fundamental inequalities in quantum\ninformation theory, such as the quantum data processing inequality.\n", "  We reply to the Comment of Brodsky and Gardner on our paper \"New limits on\nintrinsic charm in the nucleon from global analysis of parton distributions\"\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 082002 (2015)]. We address a number of incorrect claims\nmade about our fitting methodology, and elaborate how global QCD analysis of\nall available high-energy data provides no evidence for a large intrinsic charm\ncomponent of the nucleon.\n", "  We report measurements of the polar Kerr effect, proportional to the\nout-of-plane component of the magnetization, in thin films of the magnetically\ndoped topological insulator\n$(\\text{Cr}_{0.12}\\text{Bi}_{0.26}\\text{Sb}_{0.62})_2\\text{Te}_3$. Measurements\nof the complex Kerr angle, $\\Theta_K$, were performed as a function of photon\nenergy in the range $0.8\\text{ eV}<\\hbar\\omega<3.0\\text{ eV}$. We observed a\npeak in the real part of $\\Theta_K(\\omega)$ and zero crossing in the imaginary\npart that we attribute to resonant interaction with a spin-orbit avoided\ncrossing located $\\approx$ 1.6 eV above the Fermi energy. The resonant\nenhancement allows measurement of the temperature and magnetic field dependence\nof $\\Theta_K$ in the ultrathin film limit, $d\\geq2$ quintuple layers. We find a\nsharp transition to zero remanent magnetization at 6 K for $d<8$~QL, consistent\nwith theories of the dependence of impurity spin interactions on film thickness\nand their location relative to topological insulator surfaces.\n", "  In Lagrangian gauge systems, the vector space of global reducibility\nparameters forms a module under the Lie algebra of symmetries of the action.\nSince the classification of global reducibility parameters is generically\neasier than the classification of symmetries of the action, this fact can be\nused to constrain the latter when knowing the former. We apply this strategy\nand its generalization for the non-Lagrangian setting to the problem of\nconformal symmetry of various free higher spin gauge fields. This scheme allows\none to show that, in terms of potentials, massless higher spin gauge fields in\nMinkowski space and partially-massless fields in (A)dS space are not conformal\nfor spin strictly greater than one, while in terms of curvatures, maximal-depth\npartially-massless fields in four dimensions are also not conformal, unlike the\nclosely related, but less constrained, maximal-depth Fradkin--Tseytlin fields.\n", "  Quantum systems often exhibit fundamental incapability to entertain vortex.\nThe Meissner effect, a complete expulsion of the magnetic field (the\nelectromagnetic vorticity), for instance, is taken to be the defining attribute\nof the superconducting state. Superfluidity is another, close-parallel example;\nfluid vorticity can reside only on topological defects with a limited\n(quantized) amount. Recent developments in the Bose-Einstein condensates\nproduced by particle traps further emphasize this characteristic. We show that\nthe challenge of imparting vorticity to a quantum fluid can be met through a\nnonlinear mechanism operating in a hot fluid corresponding to a thermally\nmodified Pauli-Schroedinger spinor field. In a simple field-free model, we show\nthat the thermal effect, represented by a nonlinear, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian,\nin conjunction with spin vorticity, leads to new interesting quantum states; a\nspiral solution is explicitly worked out.\n", "  We consider diffusion-like paths that are explored by a particle moving via a\nconservative force while being in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. To\nprobe rare transitions, we use the Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional as a path\nprobability distribution function for double-ended paths that are constrained\nto start and stop at predesignated points after a fixed time. We explore the\ncontinuous-time limit where the OM functional has been commonly regularized by\nusing the Ito-Girsanov change of measure. When used as a path measure, the\nIto-Girsanov expression generates an ensemble of double-ended paths that are\nunphysical. We expose the underlying reasons why this continuous-time limit\ndoes not, and cannot, generate a thermodynamic ensemble of paths. Furthermore,\nwe show that the concept of the Most Probable Path and the Thermodynamic action\nare incompatible with such measures for discrete or continuous time diffusion\nprocesses.\n", "  In this work, we study the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model at a finite $ N $ by\nusing the $ 1/J $ expansion and exact diagonization. This model includes the\nfour standard quantum optics model as its various special limits. The $ 1/J $\nexpansions is complementary to the strong coupling expansion used by the\nauthors in arXiv:1512.08581 to study the same model in its dual $ Z_2/U(1) $\nrepresentation. We identify 3 regimes of the system's energy levels: the\nnormal, $ U(1) $ and quantum tunneling (QT) regime. The system's energy levels\nare grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and Schrodinger\nCats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ U(1) $ and quantum\ntunneling (QT) regime respectively. In the QT regime, by the WKB method, we\nfind the emergencies of bound states one by one as the interaction strength\nincreases, then investigate a new class of quantum tunneling processes through\nthe instantons between the two bound states in the compact photon phase. It is\nthe Berry phase interference effects in the instanton tunneling event which\nleads to Schrodinger Cats oscillating with even and odd parities in both ground\nand higher energy bound states. We map out the energy level evolution from the\n$ U(1) $ to the QT regime and also discuss some duality relations between the\nenergy levels in the two regimes. We also compute the photon correlation\nfunctions, squeezing spectrum, number correlation functions in both regimes\nwhich can be measured by various experimental techniques. The combinations of\nthe results achieved here by $ 1/J $ expansion and those in arXiv:1512.08581 by\nstrong coupling method lead to rather complete understandings of the $ U(1)/Z_2\n$ Dicke model at a finite $ N $ and any anisotropy parameter $ \\beta $.\n", "  We update predictions for lepton fluxes from the hadroproduction of charm\nquarks in the scattering of primary cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe calculation of charm-pair hadroproduction applies the latest results from\nperturbative QCD through next-to-next-to-leading order and modern parton\ndistributions, together with estimates on various sources of uncertainties. Our\npredictions for the lepton fluxes turn out to be compatible, within the\nuncertainty band, with recent results in the literature. However, by taking\ninto account contributions neglected in previous works, our total uncertainties\nare much larger. The predictions are crucial for the interpretation of results\nfrom neutrino experiments like IceCube, when disentangling signals of neutrinos\nof astrophysical origin from the atmospheric background.\n", "  This paper proposes a dynamical notion of discrete geodesics, understood as\nstraightest trajectories in discretized curved spacetime. The notion is\ngeneric, as it is formulated in terms of a general deviation function, but\nreadily specializes to metric spaces such as discretized pseudo-riemannian\nmanifolds. It is effective: an algorithm for computing these geodesics\nnaturally follows, which allows numerical validation---as shown by computing\nthe perihelion shift of a Mercury-like planet. It is consistent, in the\ncontinuum limit, with the standard notion of timelike geodesics in a\npseudo-riemannian manifold. Whether the algorithm fits within the framework of\ncellular automata is discussed at length. KEYWORDS: Discrete connection,\nparallel transport, general relativity, Regge calculus.\n", "  The $c_2$ invariant is an arithmetic graph invariant introduced by Schnetz\nand developed by Brown and Schnetz in order to better understand Feynman\nintegrals.\n  This document looks at the special case where the graph in question is a\n4-regular circulant graph with one vertex removed; call such a graph a\ndecompletion of a circulant graph. The $c_2$ invariant for the prime $2$ is\ncomputed in the case of the decompletion of circulant graphs $C_n(1,3)$ and\n$C_{2k+2}(1,k)$. For any prime $p$ and for the previous two families of\ncirculant graphs along with the further families $C_n(1,4)$, $C_n(1,5)$,\n$C_n(1,6)$, $C_n(2,3)$, $C_n(2,4)$, $C_n(2,5)$, and $C_n(3,4)$, the same\ntechnique gives the $c_2$ invariant of the decompletions as the solution to a\nfinite system of recurrence equations.\n", "  We present a generic theory of primary photoexcitations in low band gap\ndonor-acceptor conjugated copolymers. Because of the combined effects of strong\nelectron correlations and broken symmetry, there is considerable mixing between\na charge-transfer exciton and an energetically proximate triplet-triplet state\nwith an overall spin singlet. The triplet-triplet state, optically forbidden in\nhomopolymers, is allowed in donor-acceptor copolymers. For an intermediate\ndifference in electron affinities of the donor and the acceptor, the\ntriplet-triplet state can have stronger oscillator strength than the\ncharge-transfer exciton. We discuss the possibility of intramolecular singlet\nfission from the triplet-triplet state, and how such fission can be detected\nexperimentally.\n", "  We calculate collision strengths and their thermally-averaged Maxwellian\nvalues for electron excitation and de-excitation between the fifteen lowest\nlevels of singly-ionised cobalt, Co+, which give rise to emission lines in the\nnear- and mid-infrared. Transition probabilities are also calculated and\nrelative line intensities predicted for conditions typical of supernova ejecta.\nThe diagnostic potential of the 10.52, 15.46 and 14.74 micro-metre transition\nlines is briefly discussed.\n", "  In this work we study the formation and dynamics of polarons in a system with\na few impurities in a lattice immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).\nThis system has been experimentally realized using ultracold atoms and optical\nlattices. Here we consider a two-band model for the impurity atoms, along with\na Bogoliubov approximation for the BEC, with phonons coupled to impurities via\nboth intra- and inter-band transitions. We decouple this Fr\\\"ohlich-like term\nby an extended two-band Lang-Firsov polaron transformation using a variational\nmethod. The new effective Hamiltonian with two (polaron) bands differs from the\noriginal Hamiltonian by modified coherent transport, polaron energy shifts and\ninduced long-range interaction. A Lindblad master equation approach is used to\ntake into account residual incoherent coupling between polaron and bath. This\npolaronic treatment yields a renormalized inter-band relaxation rate compared\nto Fermi's Golden Rule. For a strongly coupled two-band Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian,\nthe polaron is tightly dressed in each band and can not tunnel between them,\nleading to an inter-band self-trapping effect.\n", "  The weak two-pion form factor $F_V^{\\pi\\pi}$ is described as the product of a\nweak kernel $\\cal{K}_W$ by a strong function $\\Theta_{\\pi\\pi}^P$, determined\ndirectly from $\\pi\\pi$ scattering data. As the latter accounts at once for all\neffects associated with resonances, intermediate $K\\bar{K}$ loops, and other\npossible inelasticities present in $\\pi\\pi$ scattering, the need of modeling is\nrestricted to $\\cal{K}_W$ only. The procedure proposed allows one to asses the\nweak kernel directly, which has a dominant cut beginning at the $K\\bar{K}$\nthreshold. Even the simplest vector-meson-dominance choice for $\\cal{K}_W$\nalready yields a good qualitative description of $F_V^{\\pi\\pi}$. The energy\nsector below $0.8$ GeV is quite well reproduced when a precise theoretical\nchiral perturbation $\\pi\\pi$ amplitude is used as input, together with the\nsingle free parameter $F_V G_V/F^2=1.20$. The inclusion of kaon loops, along\nwell established lines and using few parameters, produces a good description of\nthe form factor in the entire energy range allowed by $\\tau$ decays. This\nindicates that the replacement of modeling by direct empirical scattering\ninformation can also be useful in the construction of theoretical tools to be\nused in analysesof hadronic heavy meson decay data.\n", "  In this work we propose a modified holographic softwall model, analytically\nsolvable, to calculate the masses of lightest scalar glueball and its radial\nexcitations and of higher spin glueball states for both even and odd spins.\nFrom these results we obtain their respective Regge trajectories, associated\nwith the pomeron for even spins and with the odderon for odd spins. These\nresults are in agreement with those calculated using other approaches.\n", "  Electron sheaths are commonly found near Langmuir probes collecting the\nelectron saturation current. The common assumption is that the probe collects\nthe random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that\nthere is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity\nspace truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This\nwork provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they\nare not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In\nthe model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\\gg T_i$), an electron\npressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity\nthat exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure\ngradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by\nballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many\nsituations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much\nfurther into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal\nthat the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around\nthe electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath\ngeometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited\nby the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which\nresult in sheath edge fluctuations. The 1D model and time averaged PIC\nsimulations are compared and it is shown that the model provides a good\ndescription of the electron sheath and presheath.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the application of a spacetime structure to a\nthree-dimensional quantum system. There are three components. First, the main\npart of this paper presents the constraint conditions which build the relation\nof a spacetime structure and a form invariance solution to the covariant Dirac\nequation. The second is to devise a spacetime cage for fermions with chosen\nconstraints. The third part discusses the feasibility of the cage with an\nexperiment.\n", "  The $^6\\Pi$ electronic ground state of the Co$_2^+$ diatomic molecular cation\nhas been assigned experimentally by x-ray absorption and x-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap. Three candidates,\n$^6\\Phi$, $^8\\Phi$, and $^8\\Gamma$, for the electronic ground state of Fe$_2^+$\nhave been identified. These states carry sizable orbital angular momenta that\ndisagree with theoretical predictions from multireference configuration\ninteraction and density functional theory. Our results show that the ground\nstates of neutral and cationic diatomic molecules of $3d$ transition elements\ncannot generally be assumed to be connected by a one-electron process.\n", "  A new discrete time-reversible map of a unit square onto itself is proposed.\nThe map comprises of piecewise linear two-dimensional operations, and is able\nto represent the macroscopic features of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium\ndynamical systems. Our operations are analogous to sinusoidally driven shear in\nthe two dimensions, and a radial compression/expansion of a point lying\noutside/inside a circle centered around origin. Depending upon the radius, the\nmap transitions from being ergodic and nondissipative (like in equilibrium\nsituations) to a limit cycle through intermediate multifractal situations (like\nin nonequilibrium situations). All dissipative cases of the proposed map\nsuggest that the Kaplan -- Yorke dimension is smaller than the embedding\ndimension, a feature typically arising in nonequilibrium steady-states. The\nproposed map differs from the existing maps like the Baker's map and Arnold's\ncat map in the sense that (i) it is reversible, and (ii) it generates an\nintricate multifractal phase-space portrait.\n", "  The rapid variation of the superconductivity Tc in hydride sulfur (H3S) under\nhigh pressure [A. Drozdov et al, Nature 525, 73 (2015); M. Einaga et al, arXiv:\n1509.03156] in a vicinity Pcr=123GPa is interpreted in terms of the 1st order\ntransition, possibly related to a CDW-instability with a non-zero structural\nvector. The superconductivity mechanisms in high-Tc phase be discussed,\nordinary methods of calculating Tc are shown not applicable in H3S because,\nbeside the acoustic branches, its phonon spectrum contains hydrogen modes with\nmuch higher frequency. A modified approach provides realistic Tc values. The\nisotope effect (change of Tc at the substitution of deuterium for hydrogen)\nowes its origin to the high frequency of phonons and is different in different\nphases. The decrease of Tc after reaching a maximum in high-T phase is due to\nthe interaction with the second gap arising on a hole-like pocket. The\nphonon-mediated pairing on the latter is in a non-adiabatic regime of the\nfrequency omega of hydrogen modes comparable to the Fermi energy.\n", "  In this work we develop an approach for a molecular hydrogen ion (H2+) in the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation while exposed to intense short-pulse radiation.\nOur starting point is the R-Matrix incorporating Time (RMT) formulation for\natomic hydrogen [L. A. A. Nikolopoulos et al, Phys. Rev. A 78, 063420 (2008)]\nwhich has proven to be successful at treating multi-electron atomic systems\nefficiently and to high accuracy [L. R. Moore et al J. Mod. Opt. 58,1132,\n(2011)]. The present study on H2+ has been performed with a similar objective\nof developing an ab initio method for solving the Time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nEquation (TDSE) for multi-electron diatomic molecules exposed to an external\ntime-dependent potential field. The theoretical formulation is developed in\ndetail for the molecular hydrogen ion where all the multi-electron and\ninter-nuclei complications are absent. As in the atomic case, the configuration\nspace of the electron's coordinates are separated artificially over two\nregions; the inner (I) and outer (II) regions. In the region I the\ntime-dependent wavefunction is expanded on the eigenstate basis corresponding\nto the molecule's Hamiltonian augmented by Bloch operators, while in region II\na grid representation is used. We demonstrate the independence of our results\non the introduced artificial boundary-surface by calculating observables that\nare directly accessed experimentally and also by showing gauge-dependent\nquantities are also invariant with the region I box size. We also compare with\nother theoretical works and emphasize cases where basis-set approaches are\ncurrently very computationally expensive or intractable in terms of\ncomputational resources.\n", "  We present a new measurement of the branching ratio for the decay of $^{14}$O\nto the ground state of $^{14}$N. The experimental result, $\\lambda _0/\\lambda\n_{\\rm total} = (4.934 \\pm 0.040\\kern 1pt{\\rm (stat.)} \\pm 0.061\\kern 1pt{\\rm\n(syst.)}) \\times 10^{-3}$, is significantly smaller than previous\ndeterminations of this quantity. The new measurement allows an improved\ndetermination of the partial halflife for the superallowed $0^+ \\rightarrow\n0^+$ Fermi decay to the $^{14}$N first excited state, which impacts the\ndetermination of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. With the new\nmeasurement in place, the corrected $^{14}$O ${\\cal F} t $ value is in good\nagreement with the average ${\\cal F} t $ for other superallowed $0^+\n\\rightarrow 0^+$ Fermi decays.\n", "  We present our study on cosmic opacity, which relates to changes in photon\nnumber as photons travel from the source to the observer. Cosmic opacity may be\ncaused by absorption/scattering due to matter in the universe, or by\nextragalactic magnetic fields that can turn photons into unobserved particles\n(e.g. light axions, chameleons, gravitons, Kaluza-Klein modes), and it is\ncrucial to correctly interpret astronomical photometric measurements like type\nIa supernovae observations. On the other hand, the expansion rate at different\nepochs, i.e. the observational Hubble parameter data $H(z)$, are obtained from\ndifferential ageing of passively evolving galaxies or from baryon acoustic\noscillations and thus are not affected by cosmic opacity. In this work, we\nfirst construct opacity-free luminosity distances from $H(z)$ determinations,\ntaking correlations between different redshifts into consideration for our\nerror analysis. Moreover, we let the light-curve fitting parameters, accounting\nfor distance estimation in type Ia supernovae observations, free to ensure that\nour analysis is authentically cosmological-model-independent and gives a robust\nresult. Any non-zero residuals between these two kinds of luminosity distances\ncan be deemed as an indication of the existence of cosmic opacity. While a\ntransparent universe is currently consistent with the data, our results show\nthat strong constraints on opacity (and consequently on physical mechanisms\nthat could cause it) can be obtained in a cosmological-model-independent\nfashion.\n", "  Turbulence is a chaotic flow regime filled by irregular flows. The\ndissipation of turbulence is a fundamental problem in the realm of physics.\nTheoretically, dissipation cannot be ultimately achieved without collisions,\nand so how turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated in the nearly collisionless\nsolar wind is a challenging problem. Wave particle interactions and magnetic\nreconnection are two possible dissipation mechanisms, but which mechanism\ndominates is still a controversial topic. Here we analyze the dissipation\nregion scaling around a solar wind magnetic reconnection region. We find that\nthe magnetic reconnection region shows a unique multifractal scaling in the\ndissipation range, while the ambient solar wind turbulence reveals a\nmonofractal dissipation process for most of the time. These results provide the\nfirst observational evidences for the intermittent multifractal dissipation\nregion scaling around a magnetic reconnection site, and they also have\nsignificant implications for the fundamental energy dissipation process.\n", "  We investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric\nelastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. To analyze the\npropagation of both longitudinal (P-) and transverse (S-) waves, we utilize\ncompressible material models. We derive explicit expressions of the generalized\nacoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and\nenriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of the\nelastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In\nparticular, P- and S- waves are separated by the application of an electric\nfield. The divergence angle between P- and S-waves strongly depends on the\napplied electrostatic excitation. The influence of the electric field is\nsensitive to material models. Thus, for ideal dielectric model the in-plane\nshear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the\nenriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants.\nSimilarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in\nelectric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded.\nMaterial compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and, for relatively\ncompressible materials, the slowness curves evolve from circular to elliptical\nshapes manifesting in an increase of the reflection angle of P-waves. As a\nresults, the divergence angle decreases with an increase in material\ncompressibility.\n", "  We apply as selection rule to determine the unknown functions of a\ncosmological model the existence of Lie point symmetries for the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation of quantum gravity. Our cosmological setting consists of a flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker metric having the scale factor $a(t)$, a scalar\nfield with potential function $V(\\phi)$ minimally coupled to gravity and a\nvector field of its kinetic energy is coupled with the scalar field by a\ncoupling function $f(\\phi)$. Then, the Lie symmetries of this dynamical system\nare investigated by utilizing the behavior of the corresponding minisuperspace\nunder the infinitesimal generator of the desired symmetries. It is shown that\nby applying the Lie symmetry condition the form of the coupling function and\nalso the scalar field potential function may be explicitly determined so that\nwe are able to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Finally, we show how we can\nuse the Lie symmetries in order to construct conservation laws and exact\nsolutions for the field equations.\n", "  Optical microresonators have proven powerful in a wide range of applications,\nincluding cavity quantum electrodynamics, biosensing, microfludics, and cavity\noptomechanics. Their performance depends critically on the exact distribution\nof optical energy, confined and shaped by the nanoscale device geometry.\nNear-field optical probes can image this distribution, but the physical probe\nnecessarily perturbs the near field, which is particularly problematic for\nsensitive high quality factor resonances. We present a new approach to mapping\nnanophotonic modes that uses a controllably small and local optomechanical\nperturbation introduced by a focused lithium ion beam. An ion beam (radius\nabout 50 nm) induces a picometer-scale dynamic deformation of the resonator\nsurface, which we detect through a shift in the optical resonance wavelength.\nWe map five modes of a silicon microdisk resonator (Q > 20,000) with both high\nspatial and spectral resolution. Our technique also enables in-situ observation\nof ion implantation damage and relaxation dynamics in a silicon lattice.\n", "  The CALDER project aims at developing cryogenic light detectors with high\nsensitivity to UV and visible light, to be used for particle tagging in massive\nbolometers. Indeed the sensitivity of CUORE can be increased by a factor of 3,\nthanks to the reduction of the $\\alpha$-background, obtained by detecting the\nCherenkov light (100 eV) emitted by $\\beta/\\gamma$ events. Currently used light\ndetectors have not the features required to address this task, so we decided to\ndevelop a new light detector using Kinetic Inductance Detector as a sensor.\nThis approach is very challenging and requires an intensive R$\\&$D to be\nsatisfied. The first results of this activity are shown in the following.\n", "  The purpose of this report is a study of the algebraic approach possibilities\nto reconstruct images. This approach is reduced to solution of the large system\nof linear algebraic equations. We also point out some possible further\nimprovements of the mathematical approaches studied.\n", "  We give a brief summary of the formalism of invariants in general\nscalar-tensor and multiscalar-tensor gravities without derivative couplings. By\nrescaling of the metric and reparametrization of the scalar fields, the theory\ncan be presented in different conformal frames and parametrizations. Due to\nthis freedom in transformations, the scalar fields themselves do not carry\nindependent physical meaning (in a generic parametrization). However, there are\nfunctions of the scalar fields and their derivatives which remain invariant\nunder the transformations, providing a set of physical variables for the\ntheory. We indicate how to construct such invariants and show how the\nobservables like parametrized post-Newtonian parameters and characteristics of\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology can be neatly expressed in terms\nof the invariants.\n", "  The Dae$\\delta$alus DIC compact cyclotron is proposed to achieve an extracted\ncurrent of 5 mA of singly-charged hydrogen molecules, even though unlike other\ncompact cyclotrons, the extraction is not by stripping. The authors of the\nproposal consistently use perveance as a scaling argument that such high\ncurrent is possible. The argument is shown to be incorrect and a realistic\nlimit is calculated. This limit is likely about 0.2 mA and certainly no higher\nthan 0.5 mA.\n", "  By applying the direct symmetry method, the symmetry reductions and some new\ngroup invariant solutions were obtained, We have derived some exact solutions\nby using the relationship between the new solutions and the old ones, which\ninclude Weierstrass periodic solutions, elliptic periodic solutions, triangular\nfunction solutions and so on. Also, in order to reflect the characteristics and\nproperties of this solutions, we give figures of some solutions. In addition,\nwe give the conservation laws of the extended (2+1)-dimensional Jaulent-Miodek\nequation. At last, we draw conclusions and discuss it.\n", "  The recent results of 13 TeV ATLAS and CMS di-photon searches show an excess\nat di-photon invariant mass of 750 GeV. We look for possible explanation of\nthis within minimal left right symmetric model (MLRSM). The possible candidate\nis a neutral Higgs of mass 750 GeV that can decay to di-photon via charged\nHiggs and right handed gauge boson loop. However, the cross-section is not\nconsistent with the ATLAS and CMS results. We then discuss one possible\nvariation of this model with universal seesaw for fermion masses that can\nexplain this excess.\n", "  Photoproduction of the charmonium-like state $Z_{c}(4200)$ and the charmed\nbaryon $\\Lambda_{c}^{\\ast }(2940)$ is investigated with an effective Lagrangian\napproach and the Regge trajectories applying to the COMPASS experiment.\nCombining the experimental data from COMPASS and our theoretical model we\nestimate the upper limit of $\\Gamma_{Z_{c}(4200)\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\pi }$ to be\nof about 37 MeV. Moreover, the possibility to produce $\\Lambda_{c}^{\\ast\n}(2940)$ at COMPASS is discussed. It seems one can try to search for this\nhadron in the missing mass spectrum since the $t$-channel is dominating for the\n$\\Lambda_{c}^{\\ast }(2940)$ photoproduction.\n", "  In our previous paper \\cite{8}, we proposed a cosmological model from the\nemergence of space, which possesses a significant character of evaluating the\nvacuum energy from the Hubble constant and the age of universe. And one problem\nof this model is that there is no inflation in the early universe. In this\npaper, we aim at resolving this problem which leads us to a rather surprising\nconclusion that our cosmological model can avoid the horizon and flatness\nproblems.\n", "  Conventional heat carrier liquids have demonstrated remarkable enhancement in\nheat and mass transfer when nanoparticles were suspended in them. These\nliquid-nanoparticle suspensions are now known as Nanofluids. However the\nrelationship between nanoparticles and the degree of enhancement is still\nunclear, thus hindering the large scale manufacturing of them. Understanding of\nthe energy and flow behaviour of nanofluids is therefore of wide interest in\nboth academic and industrial context. In this paper we first model the heat\ntransfer of a nanofluid in convection in a circular tube at macro-scale by\nusing CFD code of OpenFoam. Then we zoon into nano-scale behaviour using the\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the latter we considered a system of\nwater and Gold nanoparticles. A systematic increase of convective heat transfer\nwas observed with increasing nanoparticle concentration. A maximum enhancement\nof 7.0% was achieved in comparison to base fluid water. This occurred when the\ngold volume fraction was 0.015. Subsequent MD simulations confirmed a dense\nwater layer formed 2nm away from the gold nanoparticle boundary. It is\nspeculated that the observed increase in thermal conductivity was principly\ncaused by this dense water layer formed around each nanoparticle.\n", "  We study the computational complexity of certain integrable quantum theories\nin 1+1 dimensions. We formalize a model of quantum computation based on these\ntheories. In this model, distinguishable particles start out with known momenta\nand initial superposition of different configurations. Then the label of these\nparticles are measured at the end. We prove that additive approximation to\nsingle amplitudes of these models can be obtained by the one-clean-qubit model,\nif no initial superpositions are allowed. However, if arbitrary initial states\nand non-adaptive intermediate measurements are allowed, we show that\nconditioned on infinite polynomial hierarchy assumption it is hard to sample\nfrom the output distribution of these models on a classical randomized\ncomputer. A classical analogue of this model is also formalized and its\ncomputational power is pinned down within the complexity classes below BPP and\nNP.\n", "  The neutron dose distributions on observation distances and on observation\nangles were measured using a Wendi-II neutron dose-meter at the deep tumor\ntherapy terminal at HIRFL (Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou) as 12C ions\nwith energies from 165 to 350 MeV/u bombarding on thick solid water targets\nwith different thickness according to the ion energies. The experimental\nresults were compared with those calculated by FLUKA code. It is found that the\nexperimental data was in good agreement with the calculated results. The\nneutron energy spectra were also studied by using the FLUKA code. The results\nare valuable for the shielding design of high energy heavy ion medical machines\nand for the individual dose assessment.\n", "  The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defect in diamond is a unique quantum system that\noffers precision sensing of nanoscale physical quantities beyond the current\nstate-of-the-art. Here we present a method to controllably encode the\ninteractions in the population of the spin states, thereby introducing a way to\ncontrol the sensitivity of a single spin as a continuum in contrast to\nfree-evolution based methods. By adopting this feature we demonstrate\nhigh-accuracy NV magnetometry without 2pi ambiguities, enhance the dynamic\nrange by a factor of 4*10^3 achieve interaction times exceeding 2 ms in\noff-the-shelf diamond. We perform nuclear spin-noise spectroscopy in the\nfrequency domain by dynamically controlling the NV spin's sensitivity piecewise\nand in a smooth manner thereby precluding harmonic artefacts and undesired\ninteractions. On a broader perspective dynamical sensitivity control provides\nan elegant handle on the inherent dynamics of quantum systems, while offering\ndecisive advantages for NV centre applications notably in quantum controls and\nsingle molecule NMR/MRI.\n", "  We consider a class of tachyon-like potentials, inspired by string theory,\nD-brane dynamics and cosmology in the context of classical and quantum\nmechanics. Motivated by the trans-Plankcian problem in the very early stage of\ncosmological evolution of the Universe, we consider the theoretical role of\nDBI-type tachyon scalar field, defined over the field of real as well as\n$p$-adic numbers, i.e. archemedean and nonarchimedean spaces. To simplify the\nequation of motion for the scalar field, canonical transformations are defined\nand engaged. The corresponding quantum propagators in the Feynman path integral\napproach on real and nonarchimedean spaces are calculated and discussed, as are\npossibilities for a quantum adelic generalization and its application.\n", "  Feynman amplitudes in perturbation theory form the basis for most predictions\nin particle collider experiments. The mathematical quantities which occur as\namplitudes include values of the Riemann zeta function and relate to\nfundamental objects in number theory and algebraic geometry. This talk reviews\nsome of the recent developments in this field, and explains how new ideas from\nalgebraic geometry have led to much progress in our understanding of\namplitudes. In particular, the idea that certain transcendental numbers, such\nas $\\pi$, can be viewed as a representation of a group, provides a powerful\nframework to study amplitudes which reveals many hidden structures.\n", "  Quantum coin tossing (QCT) is an important primitive of quantum cryptography\nand has received continuous interest. However, in practical QCT, Bob's\ndetectors can be subjected to detector-side channel attacks launched by\ndishonest Alice, which will possibly make the protocol completely insecure.\nHere, we report a simple strategy of a detector-blinding attack based on a\nrecent experiment. To remove all the detector side channels, we present a\nsolution of measurement-device-independent QCT (MDI-QCT). This method is\nsimilar to the idea of MDI quantum key distribution (QKD). MDI-QCT is loss\ntolerant with single-photon sources and has the same bias as the original\nloss-tolerant QCT under a coherent attack. Moreover, it provides the potential\nadvantage of doubling the secure distance for some special cases. Finally,\nMDI-QCT can also be modified to fit the weak coherent-state sources. Thus,\nbased on the rapid development of practical MDI-QKD, our proposal can be\nimplemented easily.\n", "  Different types of ground-based detectors have been developed and deployed\naround the world to monitor and study CR variations. We have designed,\nconstructed and operated a three layer small (20x20 cm2) multiwire proportional\nchamber MWPC telescope for cosmic ray muon observations. In this paper, the\ntechnical aspects of this detector will be briefly discussed. The abilities of\nthe telescope in detecting high nergy cosmic ray muons (primaries higher than\n20 GeV) were established. The telescope performs well in this sense and showed\ncomparable results with a 1 m2 scintillator detector.\n", "  Multi-spinor fields which behave as triple-tensor products of the Dirac\nspinors and form reducible representations of the Lorentz group describe three\nfamilies of ordinary quarks and leptons in the visible sector and an additional\nfamily of exotic dark quarks and leptons in the dark sector of the Universe.\nApart from the ordinary set of the gauge and Higgs fields in the visible\nsector, another set of gauge and Higgs fields belonging to the dark sector are\nassumed to exist. Two sectors possess channels of communication through gravity\nand a bi-quadratic interaction between the two types of Higgs fields. A\ncandidate for the main component of the dark matter is a stable dark hadron\nwith spin 3/2, and the upper limit of its mass is estimated to be 15.1\nGeV/c$^2$.\n", "  The large localized CP asymmetries observed by LHCb in three-body charmless\ndecays of $B$ mesons brings new challenge for experimentalists and their\ntraditional models to fit data. With higher statistics, rescattering and\nthree-body effects, previously ignored on data analysis, become more visible.\nThe time is ripe to use better theoretical assumptions as an ingredient in\norder to improve the analysis. In this paper we address the issue of\nrescattering effects in the charmless three-body decays of $B$ mesons. In\nparticular, we study the case of the $B^+ \\to \\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay and show\nthat the presence of hadronic loops shifts the P-wave phase near threshold to\nbelow zero, and modify the position of the $\\rho$-meson peak and it width, in\nthe Dalitz plot.\n", "  We use the explicit relation between genus filtrated $s$-loop means of the\nGaussian matrix model and terms of the genus expansion of the\nKontsevich--Penner matrix model (KPMM), which is the generating function for\nvolumes of discretized (open) moduli spaces $M_{g,s}^{disc}$ (discrete\nvolumes), to express Gaussian means in all genera as polynomials in special\ntimes weighted by ancestor invariants of an underlying cohomological field\ntheory. We translate topological recursion of the Gaussian model into recurrent\nrelations for coefficients of this expansion proving their integrality and\npositivity. As an application, we find the coefficients in the first subleading\norder for ${\\mathcal M}_{g,1}$ for all $g$ in three ways: by using the refined\nHarer--Zagier recursion, by exploiting the Givental-type decomposition of KPMM,\nand by an explicit diagram counting.\n", "  We show that propagation of ultrashort (few-cycle) pulses in nonlinear Drude\nmetamaterials with both electric and magnetic Kerr nonlinearities is described\nby coupled generalized Short Pulse Equations. The resulting system of equations\ngeneralizes to the case of metamaterials both the Short Pulse Equation and its\nvector generalizations which describe the few-cycle pulses in dielectric\noptical fibers beyond the slowly varying envelope approximation leading to the\nnonlinear Schroedinger equation.\n", "  Large port count spatial optical switches will facilitate flexible and energy\nefficient data movement in future data communications systems, especially if\nthey are capable of nanosecond-order reconfiguration times. In this work, we\ndemonstrate an 8x8 microring-based silicon photonic switch with software\ncontrolled switching. The proposed switch architecture is modular as it\nassembles multiple identical components with multiplexing/demultiplexing\nfunctionalities. The switch is fully non-blocking, has path independent\ninsertion loss, low crosstalk and is straightforward to control. A scalability\nanalysis shows that this architecture can scale to very large port counts. This\nwork represents the first demonstration of real-time firmware controlled\nswitching with silicon photonics devices integrated at the chip scale.\n", "  We provide an explanation to the behaviour of the spectra of two\nexactly-solvable one-dimensional Hamiltonians with PT symmetry proposed\nearlier. We calculate the branch points at which pairs of eigenvalues coalesce\nand discuss the perturbation series.\n", "  The case of motion of a generalized two-field gyrostat found by V.V.Sokolov\nand A.V.Tsiganov is known as a Liouville integrable Hamiltonian system with\nthree degrees of freedom. We find a set of points at which the momentum map has\nrank 1. This set consists of special periodic motions which correspond to the\nsingular points of a bifurcation diagram on an iso-energetic surface. For such\nmotions the phase variables can be expressed in terms of algebraic functions of\na single auxiliary variable. These algebraic functions satisfy a differential\nequation integrable in elliptic functions of time. It is shown that the\ncorresponding points in the three-dimensional space of the constants of the\nintegrals belong to the intersection of two sheets of the discriminant surface\nof the Lax curve.\n", "  Simple dynamics, few available decay channels, and extremely well controlled\nradiative and loop corrections, make pion and muon decays a sensitive means for\ntesting the underlying symmetries, the universality of weak fermion couplings,\nas well as for study of pion structure and chiral dynamics. We review the\ncurrent state of experimental study of the allowed rare decays of charged\npions: (a) electronic, $\\pi^+ \\to e^+\\nu_e$, or $\\pi_{e2}$, (b) radiative,\n$\\pi^+ \\to e^+\\nu_e\\gamma$, or $\\pi_{e2\\gamma}$, and (c) semileptonic,\n$\\pi^+\\to \\pi^0 e^+ \\nu$, or $\\pi_{e3}$, as well as muon radiative decay,\n$\\mu^+\\to e^+ \\nu_{\\text{e}}\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}\\gamma$. Taken together, these data\npresent an internally consistent picture that also agrees well with Standard\nModel (SM) predictions. However, even following the great strides of the recent\ndecades, experimental accuracy is lagging far behind that of the theoretical\ndescription for all above processes. We review the implications of the present\nstate of knowledge and prospects for further improvement in the near term.\n", "  We show that a scalar field without a kinetic term in the Lagrangian density,\ncoupled to a covariant divergence of the torsion vector in the Einstein-Cartan\ntheory of gravity, becomes kinetic in its general-relativistic equivalent\nformulation. Dynamical scalar fields may therefore be emergent.\n", "  We examine transmission through a quantum graph vertex to which auxiliary\nedges with constant potentials are attached. We find a characterization of\nvertex couplings for which the transmission probability from a given \"input\"\nline to a given \"output\" line shows a flat passband. The bandwidth is\ncontrolled directly by the potential on the auxiliary edges. Vertices with such\ncouplings can thus serve as controllable band-pass filters. The paper extends\nearlier works on the topic. The result also demonstrates the effectivity of the\n$ST$-form of boundary conditions for a study of scattering in quantum graph\nvertices.\n", "  We used density functional theory to computationally design a Zr\norganometallic catalyst for selectively oxidizing substrates using molecular\noxygen as oxidant without coreductant. Each selective oxidation cycle involves\nfour general steps: (a) a peroxo or weakly adsorbed O2 group releases an O atom\nto substrate to form substrate oxide and an oxo group, (b) an oxygen molecule\nadds to the oxo group to generate an eta2-ozone group, (c) the eta2-ozone group\nrearranges to form an eta3-ozone group, and (d) the eta3-ozone group releases\nan O atom to substrate to form substrate oxide and regenerate the peroxo or\nweakly adsorbed O2 group. This catalyst could potentially be synthesized via\nthe condensation reaction Zr(N(R)R')4 + 2\nC6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)OH)2 -->\nZr(C6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)O)2)2 [aka Zr_Benzol catalyst] + 4\nN(R)(R')H where R and R' are CH3, CH2CH3, or other alkyl groups. For direct\nethylene epoxidation, the computed enthalpic energetic span (i.e., effective\nactivation energy for the entire catalytic cycle) is 27.1 kcal/mol, which is\none of the lowest values for catalysts studied to date. We study reaction\nmechanisms and the stability of different catalyst forms as a function of the\noxygen atom chemical potential. Notably, an aromatic linkage in each ligand\nprevents this catalyst from deactivating to form an inactive octahedral-like\nstructure that contains the same atoms as the dioxo complex, Zr(Ligand)2(O)2.\nDue to a side reaction that can transfer an allylic H atom from alkene to\ncatalyst, this catalyst is useful for directly epoxidizing alkenes such as\nethylene that do not contain allylic H atoms. To better understand the reaction\nchemistry, we computed net atomic charges and bond orders for the two\ncatalytically relevant reaction cycles. These results quantify electron\ntransfer and bond forming and breaking during the catalytic process.\n", "  Very recently, first-principle technique of full-potential linearized\naugmented plane-wave method, by using for exchange-correlation potential the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA), was employed for the study of the\nlead chalcogenide semiconductors' alloys PbS$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$,\nPbS$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ and PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$. These density functional\ncalculations led to the determination of structural, electronic and optical\nproperties, including the values of lattice constants and bulk moduli as a\nfunction of composition. Here, we investigate the latter properties, but by\nemploying a thermodynamical model which has been suggested for the formation\nand migration of defects in solids including several recent applications in\nsemiconductors. The following crucial difference emerges when comparing the\npresent results with those deduced by density functional calculations: Among\nthe alloys studied, GGA calculations identify that PbS$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ exhibits\nthe most evident non-linear variation of the bulk modulus versus the\ncomposition, while according to the thermodynamical model such an evident\nnon-linear behavior -and maybe somewhat stronger- is also expected for\nPbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$. A tentative origin of this diversity is discussed.\n", "  We calculate the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric\nfunction of bulk silicon by applying time-dependent density-functional theory\nbased on the exact-exchange (EXX) Kohn-Sham (KS) band structure and the\nadiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) kernel. The position of the E2\nabsorption peak calculated with the EXX band structure at the\nindependent-particle level is in excellent agreement with experiments, which\ndemonstrates the good quality of EXX `KS quasiparticles'. The excitonic E1 peak\nthat is missing at the independent-particle level remains absent if\ntwo-particle interaction effects are taken into account within the\ntime-dependent LDA, demonstrating the incapability of the ALDA kernel to\ndescribe excitonic effects.\n", "  Applying the novel exact-exchange (EXX) Kohn-Sham method within\ntime-dependent density-functional theory, we obtained the optical absorption\nspectrum of bulk silicon in good agreement with experiments including excitonic\nfeatures. Analysis of the EXX kernel shows that inclusion of the Coulomb\ncoupling of electron-hole pairs and the correct long-wavelength behavior in the\nkernel is crucial for the proper description of excitonic effects in\nsemiconductors.\n", "  We propose a simple and efficient one-way multigrid method for\nself-consistent electronic structure calculations based on iterative\ndiagonalization. Total energy calculations are performed on several different\nlevels of grids starting from the coarsest grid, with wave functions\ntransferred to each finer level. The only changes compared to a single grid\ncalculation are interpolation and orthonormalization steps outside the original\ntotal energy calculation and required only for transferring between grids. This\nfeature results in a minimal amount of code change, and enables us to employ a\nsophisticated interpolation method and noninteger ratio of grid spacings.\nCalculations employing a preconditioned conjugate gradient method are presented\nfor two examples, a quantum dot and a charged molecular system. Use of three\ngrid levels with grid spacings 2h, 1.5h, and h decreases the computer time by\nabout a factor of 5 compared to single level calculations.\n", "  We describe the object-oriented implementation of a higher-order\nfinite-difference density-functional code in Fortran 90. Object-oriented models\nof grid and related objects are constructed and employed for the implementation\nof an efficient one-way multigrid method we have recently proposed for the\ndensity-functional electronic-structure calculations. Detailed analysis of\nperformance and strategy of the one-way multigrid scheme will be presented.\n"]}
