How could possible discrimination be\navoided? We propose indices defined for each discipline (subfield) and which\ncount the plausible contributions added up by collaborators maintaining the\nspirit of interdependency.

Where and how this\ntransformation of energy is curried out, it is not yet known. What can we learn\nfrom it that the jets decelerate and the deceleration is non-dissipative, i.e.\nradiatively dark. In this paper we unclose the observed deviations of the\nprecessing radio jets of SS\\,433, within a few arcseconds from a jets source,\nfrom the ballistic track, described by the kinematic model, as a signature of\nthe deceleration which, on other hand, issues from the jets colliding with\nambient medium. For that we model kinematics of these colliding jets. The ram\npressure on the jets is estimated from the observed profile of brightness of\nsynchrotron radiation along the radio jets. We have found that to fit observed\nlocus the radio jets should be decelerated and twisted, additionally to the\nprecession twist, mostly within the first one-fifth of precession period, and\nfurther they extend imitating ballistic jets. The fitted physical parameters of\nthe jet model turned out to be physically reliable and characteristic for\nSS\\,433 jets that unlikely to be occasional. This model explains naturally, and\nmeets approval by a) the observed shock-pressed morphology of the radio jets\nand their brightness, b) the observed $\\sim 10%$ deflections from the standard\nkinematic model --- just a magnitude of the jet speed decrement in the model,\nc) regularly observed for the radio jets the precession phase deviation from\nthe standard kinematic model prediction, d) dichotomy of distance to the\nobject, 4.8\\,kpc vs. 5.5\\,kpc, determined on the basis of the radio jets\nkinematics on scales of a sub-arcsecond and several arcseconds.\n", "  We study the growth kinetics of glassy correlations in a structural glass by\nmonitoring the evolution, within mode-coupling theory, of a suitably defined\nthree-point function $\\chi_C(t,t_w)$ with time $t$ and waiting time $t_w$. From\nthe complete wave vector-dependent equations of motion for domain growth we\npass to a schematic limit to obtain a numerically tractable form. We find that\nthe peak value $\\chi_C^P$ of $\\chi_C(t,t_w)$, which can be viewed as a\ncorrelation volume, grows as $t_w^{0.5}$, and the relaxation time as\n$t_w^{0.8}$, following a quench to a point deep in the glassy state. These\nresults constitute a theoretical explanation of the simulation findings of\nParisi [J. Phys. Chem. B {\\bf 103}, 4128 (1999)] and Kob and Barrat [Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 78}, 4581 (1997)] and are also in qualitative agreement with\nParsaeian and Castillo [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 78}, 060105(R) (2008)]. On the other\nhand, if the quench is to a point on the {\\em liquid side}, the correlation\nvolume grows to saturation. We present a similar calculation for the growth\nkinetics in a $p$-spin spin glass mean-field model where we find a slower\ngrowth, $\\chi_C^P \\sim t_w^{0.13}$. Further, we show that a shear rate $\\gdot$\ncuts off the growth of glassy correlations when $t_w\\sim 1/\\gdot$ for quench in\nthe glassy regime and $t_w=\\min(t_r,1/\\gdot)$ in the liquid, where $t_r$ is the\nrelaxation time of the unsheared liquid. The relaxation time of the steady\nstate fluid in this case is $\\propto \\gdot^{-0.8}$.\n", "  This article considers the iterative solution of a finite element\ndiscretisation of the magma dynamics equations. In simplified form, the magma\ndynamics equations share some features of the Stokes equations. We therefore\nformulate, analyse and numerically test a Elman, Silvester and Wathen-type\nblock preconditioner for magma dynamics. We prove analytically and demonstrate\nnumerically the optimality of the preconditioner. The presented analysis\nhighlights the dependence of the preconditioner on parameters in the magma\ndynamics equations that can affect convergence of iterative linear solvers. The\nanalysis is verified through a range of two- and three-dimensional numerical\nexamples on unstructured grids, from simple illustrative problems through to\nlarge problems on subduction zone-like geometries. The computer code to\nreproduce all numerical examples is freely available as supporting material.\n", "  We study the dependence on the charm quark mass of the leading-order\nlow-energy constants of the $\\Delta S=1$ effective Hamiltonian, with the aim of\nelucidating the role of the charm mass scale in the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule for\n$K\\to\\pi\\pi$ decay. To that purpose, finite-volume Chiral Perturbation Theory\npredictions are matched to QCD simulations, performed in the quenched\napproximation with overlap fermions and $m_u=m_d=m_s$. Light quark masses range\nbetween a few MeV up to around one third of the physical strange mass, while\ncharm masses range between $m_u$ and a few hundred MeV. Novel variance\nreduction techniques are used to obtain a signal for penguin contractions in\ncorrelation functions involving four-fermion operators. The important role\nplayed by the subtractions required to construct renormalised amplitudes for\n$m_c \\neq m_u$ is discussed in detail. We find evidence that the moderate\nenhancement of the $\\Delta I=1/2$ amplitude previously found in the GIM limit\n$m_c=m_u$ increases only slightly as $m_c$ abandons the light quark regime.\nHints of a stronger enhancement for even higher values of $m_c$ are also found,\nbut their confirmation requires a better understanding of the subtraction\nterms.\n", "  We discuss all-to-all quark propagator techniques in two (related) contexts\nwithin Lattice QCD: the computation of closed quark propagators, and\napplications to the so-called \"eye diagrams\" appearing in the computation of\nnon-leptonic kaon decay amplitudes. Combinations of low-mode averaging and\ndiluted stochastic volume sources that yield optimal signal-to-noise ratios for\nthe latter problem are developed. We also apply a recently proposed probing\nalgorithm to compute directly the diagonal of the inverse Dirac operator, and\ncompare its performance with that of stochastic methods. At fixed computational\ncost the two procedures yield comparable signal-to-noise ratios, but probing\nhas practical advantages which make it a promising tool for a wide range of\napplications in Lattice QCD.\n", "  For a one-dimensional spin chain with random local interactions, we prove\nthat many-body localization follows from a physically reasonable assumption\nthat limits the amount of level attraction in the system. The construction uses\na sequence of local unitary transformations to diagonalize the Hamiltonian and\nconnect the exact many-body eigenfunctions to the original basis vectors.\n", "  We study the influence of quantum fluctuations on the phase, density, and\npair correlations in a trapped quasicondensate after a quench of the\ninteraction strength. To do so, we derive a description similar to the\nstochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) but keeping a fully quantum\ndescription of the low-energy fields using the positive-P representation. This\nallows us to treat both the quantum and thermal fluctuations together in an\nintegrated way. A plain SGPE only allows for thermal fluctuations. The approach\nis applicable to such situations as finite temperature quantum quenches, but\nnot equilibrium calculations due to the time limitations inherent in positive-P\ndescriptions of interacting gases. One sees the appearance antibunching, the\ngeneration of counter-propagating atom pairs, and increased phase fluctuations.\nWe show that the behavior can be estimated by adding the T=0 quantum\nfluctuation contribution to the thermal fluctuations described by the plain\nSGPE.\n", "  A suitable nonlinear interaction between dark matter with an energy density\n$\\rho_{M}$ and dark energy with an energy density $\\rho_{X}$ is known to give\nrise to a non-canonical scaling $\\rho_{M} \\propto \\rho_{X}a^{-\\xi}$ where $\\xi$\nis a parameter which generally deviates from $\\xi =3$. Here we present a\ncovariant generalization of this class of models and investigate the\ncorresponding perturbation dynamics. The resulting matter power spectrum for\nthe special case of a time-varying Lambda model is compared with data from the\nSDSS DR9 catalogue. We find a best-fit value of $\\xi = 3.25$ which corresponds\nto a decay of dark matter into the cosmological term. Our results are\ncompatible with the $\\Lambda$CDM model at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  This work classifies the set of diagonal gates that can implement a single or\ntwo-qubit transversal logical gate for qubit stabilizer codes. We show that\nindividual physical gates on the underlying qubits that compose the code are\nrestricted to have entries of the form $e^{i \\pi c/2^k}$ along their diagonal,\nresulting in a similarly restricted class of logical gates that can be\nimplemented in this manner. Moreover, we show that all diagonal logical gates\nthat can be implemented transversally by individual physical diagonal gates\nmust belong to the Clifford hierarchy. Furthermore, we can use this result to\nprove a conjecture about transversal gates made by Zeng et al. in 2007.\n", "  For a prescribed porosity, the coupled magma/mantle flow equations can be\nformulated as a two-field system of equations with velocity and pressure as\nunknowns. Previous work has shown that while optimal preconditioners for the\ntwo-field formulation can be obtained, the construction of preconditioners that\nare uniform with respect to model parameters is difficult. This limits the\napplicability of two-field preconditioners in certain regimes of practical\ninterest. We address this issue by reformulating the governing equations as a\nthree-field problem, which removes a term that was problematic in the two-field\nformulation in favour of an additional equation for a pressure-like field. For\nthe three-field problem, we develop and analyse new preconditioners and we show\nnumerically that they are optimal in terms of problem size and less sensitive\nto model parameters, compared to the two-field preconditioner. This extends the\napplicability of optimal preconditioners for coupled mantle/magma dynamics into\nparameter regimes of physical interest.\n", "  Optical space in metamaterials may be engineered to emulate four dimensional\nKaluza-Klein theory. Nonlinear optics of such metamaterials mimics interaction\nof quantized electric charges. An electromagnetic wormhole is designed, which\nconnects two points of such an optical space and changes its effective\ntopology. Electromagnetic field configurations which exhibit fractional charges\nappear as a result of such topology change. Moreover, such effects as\nMisner-Wheeler charge without charge may be replicated.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate cosmological models of the extended Chaplygin\ngas in a universe governed by Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The equation of state\nfor an extended Chaplygin gas is a $(n+2)$-variable equation determined by\n$A_{n}$, $\\alpha$, and $B$. In this work, we are interested to the case of\nsecond order $(n=2)$ equation of state which recovers quadratic barotropic\nequation of state. In that case there are four free parameters. We solve\nconservation equation approximately and obtain energy density in terms of scale\nfactor with mentioned free parameters. Under some assumptions we relate free\nparameters to each other to have only one free independent parameter $(A_{2})$.\nIt help us to obtain explicit expression for energy density in terms of scale\nfactor. The allowed values of the second order extended Chaplygin gas parameter\nis fixed using the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data.\nThermodynamics of the model investigated based on the first and second law of\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Nonlinear optical phenomena are typically local. Here we predict the\npossibility of highly nonlocal optical nonlinearities for light propagating in\natomic media trapped near a nano-waveguide, where long-range interactions\nbetween the atoms can be tailored. When the atoms are in an\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency configuration, the atomic interactions\nare translated to long-range interactions between photons and thus to highly\nnonlocal optical nonlinearities. We derive and analyze the governing nonlinear\npropagation equation, finding a roton-like excitation spectrum for light and\nthe emergence of order in its output intensity. These predictions open the door\nto studies of unexplored wave dynamics and many-body physics with\nhighly-nonlocal interactions of optical fields in one dimension.\n", "  We investigate how the holographic correspondence can be reformulated as a\ngeneralisation of Wilsonian RG flow in a strongly interacting large $N$ quantum\nfield theory. We firstly define a \\textit{highly efficient RG flow} as one in\nwhich the Ward identities related to local conservation of energy, momentum and\ncharges preserve the same form at each scale -- to achieve this it is necessary\nto redefine the background metric and external sources at each scale as\nfunctionals of the effective single trace operators. These redefinitions also\nabsorb the contributions of the multi-trace operators to these effective Ward\nidentities. Thus the background metric and external sources become effectively\ndynamical reproducing the dual classical gravity equations in one higher\ndimension. Here, we focus on reconstructing the pure gravity sector as a highly\nefficient RG flow of the energy-momentum tensor operator, leaving the explicit\nconstructive field theory approach for generating such RG flows to the second\npart of the work. We show that special symmetries of the highly efficient RG\nflows carry information through which we can decode the gauge fixing of bulk\ndiffeomorphisms in the corresponding gravity equations. We also show that the\nhighly efficient RG flow which reproduces a given classical gravity theory in a\ngiven gauge is \\textit{unique} provided the endpoint can be transformed to a\nnon-relativistic fixed point with a finite number of parameters under a\nuniversal rescaling. The results obtained here are used in the second part of\nthis work, where we do an explicit field-theoretic construction of the RG flow,\nand obtain the dual classical gravity theory.\n", "  The connection between swimming and control theory is attracting increasing\nattention in the recent literature. Starting from an idea of Alberto Bressan\n[7] we study the system of a planar body whose position and shape are described\nby a finite number of parameters, and is immersed in a 2-dimensional ideal and\nin-compressible fluid in terms of gauge field on the space of shapes. We focus\non a class of deformations measure preserving which are diffeomeorphisms whose\nexistence is ensured by the Riemann Mapping Theorem. We face a crucial problem:\nthe pres-ence of possible non vanishing initial impulse. If the body starts\nwith zero initial impulse we recover the results present in literature\n(Marsden, Munnier and oths). If instead the body starts with an initial impulse\ndifferent from zero, the swimmer can self-propel in almost any direction if it\ncan undergo shape changes without any bound on their velocity. This interesting\nobservation, together with the analysis of the controllability of this system,\nseems innovative.\n", "  The neutrino minimal Standard Model ({\\nu}MSM) is the minimum extension of\nthe standard model. In this model, the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism (DW) produces\nkeV sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) and the degenerate GeV heavy Majorana\nneutrinos lead to leptogenesis. However, the DW mechanism has been ruled out by\nLyman-{\\alpha} bounds and X-ray constraints. An alternative scenario that\nevades these constraints has been proposed, where the sterile neutrino DM is\ngenerated by the thermal freeze-in mechanism via a singlet scalar. In this\npaper, we consider a Higgs sector extension of the {\\nu}MSM to improve dark\nmatter sectors and leptogenesis scenarios, focusing on the thermal freeze-in\nproduction mechanism. We discuss various thermal freeze-in scenarios for the\nproduction of keV-MeV sterile neutrino DM with a singlet scalar, and\nreinvestigate the Lyman-{\\alpha} bounds and the X-ray constraints on the\nparameter regions. Furthermore, we propose thermal freeze-in leptogenesis\nscenarios in the extended {\\nu}MSM. The singlet scalar needs to be TeV scale in\norder to generate the observed DM relic density and baryon number density with\nthe thermal freeze-in production mechanism.\n", "  We report macroscopic sheets of highly conductive bilayer graphene with\nexceptionally high hole concentrations of ~ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-2}$ and\nunprecedented sheet resistances of 20-25 {\\Omega} per square over macroscopic\nscales, and obtained in-situ over a thin cushion of molecular oxygen on a\nsilicon substrate. The electric and electronic properties of this specific\nconfiguration remain stable upon thermal anneals and months of exposure to air.\nWe further report a complementary ab-initio study, predicting an enhancement of\ngraphene adhesion energy of up to a factor 20, also supported by experimental\nfracture tests. Our results show that the remarkable properties of graphene can\nbe realized in a reliable fashion using a high-throughput process. In addition\nto providing exceptional material properties, the growth process we employed is\nscalable to large areas so that the outstanding conduction properties of\ngraphene can be harnessed in devices fabricated via conventional semiconductor\nmanufacturing processes. We anticipate that the approach will provide the\nnecessary scalability and reliability for future developments in the graphene\nnanoscience and technology fields, especially in areas where further\nminiaturization is hampered by size effects and electrical reliability of\nclassical conductors.\n", "  Envariance -- entanglement assisted invariance -- is a recently discovered\nsymmetry of composite quantum systems. We show that thermodynamic equilibrium\nstates are fully characterized by their envariance. In particular, the\nmicrocanonical equilibrium of a system $\\mathcal{S} $ with Hamiltonian\n$H_\\mathcal{S}$ is a fully energetically degenerate quantum state envariant\nunder every unitary transformation. The representation of the canonical\nequilibrium then follows from simply counting degenerate energy states. Our\nconceptually novel approach is free of mathematically ambiguous notions such as\nensemble, randomness, etc., and, while it does not even rely on probability, it\nhelps to understand its role in the quantum world.\n", "  Current vertex correction (CVC), the back-flow-like correction to the\ncurrent, comes from conservation laws, and the CVC due to electron correlation\ncontains information about many-body effects. However, it has been little\nunderstood how the CVC due to electron correlation affects the charge\ntransports of a correlated multiorbital system. To improve this situation, I\nstudied the inplane resistivity, $\\rho_{ab}$, and the Hall coefficient in the\nweak-field limit, $R_{\\textrm{H}}$, in addition to the magnetic properties and\nthe electronic structure, for a $t_{2g}$-orbital Hubbard model on a square\nlattice in a paramagnetic state away from or near an antiferromagnetic (AF)\nquantum-critical point (QCP) in the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation\nwith the CVCs arising from the self-energy ($\\Sigma$), the Maki-Thompson (MT)\nirreducible four-point vertex function, and the main terms of the\nAslamasov-Larkin (AL) one. Then, I found three main results about the CVCs.\nFirst, the main terms of the AL CVC does not qualitatively change the results\nobtained in the FLEX approximation with the $\\Sigma$ CVC and the MT CVC.\nSecond, $\\rho_{ab}$ and $R_{\\textrm{H}}$ near the AF QCP have high-temperature\nregion, governed mainly by the $\\Sigma$ CVC, and low-temperature region,\ngoverned mainly by the $\\Sigma$ CVC and the MT CVC. Third, in case away from\nthe AF QCP, the MT CVC leads to a considerable effect on only $R_{\\textrm{H}}$\nat low temperatures, although $R_{\\textrm{H}}$ at high temperatures and\n$\\rho_{ab}$ at all temperatures considered are sufficiently described by\nincluding only the $\\Sigma$ CVC. I also achieved the qualitative agreement with\nseveral experiments of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ or\nSr$_{2}$Ru$_{0.975}$Ti$_{0.025}$O$_{4}$. Moreover, I showed several better\npoints of this theory than other theories.\n", "  Guided by the Jacobi's work published the year before his death about the\nrotation of a rigid body, the behavior of the rotation matrix describing the\ndynamics of the free rigid body is studied. To illustrate this dynamics one\ndraws on a unit sphere the trace of the three unit vectors, in the body system\nalong the principal directions of inertia. A minimal set of properties of\nJacobi's elliptic functions are used, those which allow to compute with the\nnecessary precision the dynamics of the rigid body without torques, the so\ncalled Euler's top. Emphasis is on the paper published by Jacobi in 1850 on the\nexplicit expression for the components of the rotation matrix. The tool used to\ncompute the trajectories to be drawn are the Jacobi's Fourier series for {\\sl\ntheta} and {\\sl eta} functions with extremely fast convergence. The Jacobi's\n{\\sl sn}, {\\sl cn} and {\\sl dn} functions, which are better known, are used\nalso as ratios of {\\sl theta} functions which permit quick and accurate\ncomputation. Finally the main periodic part of the herpolhode curve was\ncomputed and graphically represented.\n", "  We present a novel spectroscopic method for probing the \\insitu~density of\nquantum gases. We exploit the density-dependent energy shift of highly excited\n{Rydberg} states, which is of the order $10$\\MHz\\,/\\,1E14\\,cm$^{\\text{-3}}$ for\n\\rubidium~for triplet s-wave scattering. The energy shift combined with a\ndensity gradient can be used to localize Rydberg atoms in density shells with a\nspatial resolution less than optical wavelengths, as demonstrated by scanning\nthe excitation laser spatially across the density distribution. We use this\nRydberg spectroscopy to measure the mean density addressed by the Rydberg\nexcitation lasers, and to monitor the phase transition from a thermal gas to a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC).\n", "  We study the three-dimensional ground state vortex lattice structures of\npurely dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By using the mean-field model we\nobtain a stability diagram for the vortex states in purely dipolar BECs as a\nfunction of harmonic trap aspect ratio ($\\lambda$) and dipole-dipole\ninteraction strength ($D$) under rotation. Rotating the condensate within the\nunstable region leads to collapse, while in the stable region furnishes stable\nvortex lattices of dipolar BECs. We analyse stable vortex lattice structures by\nsolving three-dimensional time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation in imaginary\ntime. Further, the stability of vortex states is examined by evolution in\nreal-time. We also investigate distribution of vortices in fully anisotropic\ntrap by increasing eccentricity of the external trapping potential. Breaking up\nof the condensate in two parts has been observed with equally shared vortices\non each when the trap is sufficiently weak and the rotation frequency is high.\n", "  A researcher collaborating with many groups will normally have more papers\n(and thus higher citations and $h$-index) than a researcher spending all\nhis/her time working alone or in a small group. While analyzing an author's\nresearch merit, it is therefore not enough to consider only the collective\nimpact of the published papers, it is also necessary to quantify his/her share\nin the impact. For this quantification, here I propose the $I$-index which is\ndefined as an author's percentage share in the total citations that his/her\npapers have attracted. It is argued that this $I$-index does not directly\ndepend on the most of the subjective issues like an author's influence,\naffiliation, seniority or career break. A simple application of the Central\nLimit Theorem shows that, the scheme of equidistribution of credit among the\ncoauthors of a paper will give us the most probable value of the $I$-index\n(with an associated small standard deviation which decreases with increasing\n$h$-index). I show that the total citations ($N_c$), the $h$-index and the\n$I$-index are three independent parameters (within their bounds), and together\nthey give a comprehensive idea of an author's overall research performance.\n", "  Frequency-dependent permeability tensor for unsaturated polycrystalline\nferrites is derived through an effective medium approximation that combines\nboth domain-wall motion and rotation of domains in a single consistent\nscattering framework. Thus derived permeability tensor is averaged on a\ndistribution function of the free energy that encodes paramagnetic states for\nanhysteretic loops. The initial permeability is computed and frequency spectra\nare given by varying macroscopic remanent field.\n", "  We propose the general multi-band quasiclassical Eilenberger theory of\nsuperconductivity to describe quasiparticle excitations in inhomogeneous\nsystems. With the use of low-energy projection matrix, the $M$-band\nquasiclassical Eilenberger equations are systematically obtained from $N$-band\nGor'kov equations. Here $M$ is the internal degrees of freedom in the bands\ncrossing the Fermi energy and $N$ is the degree of freedom in a model. Our\nframework naturally includes inter-band off-diagonal elements of Green's\nfunctions, which have usually been neglected in previous multi-band\nquasiclassical frameworks. The resultant multi-band Eilenberger and Andreev\nequations are similar to the single-band ones, except for multi-band effects.\nThe multi-band effects can exhibit the non-locality and the anisotropy in the\nmapped systems. Our framework can be applied to an arbitrary Hamiltonian (e.g.\na tight-binding Hamiltonian derived by the first-principle calculation). As\nexamples, we use our framework in various kinds of systems, such as\nnoncentrosymmetric superconductor CePt$_{3}$Si, three-orbital model for\nSr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, heavy fermion CeCoIn$_{5}$/YbCoIn$_{5}$ superlattice, a\ntopological superconductor with the strong spin-orbit coupling\nCu$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, and a surface system on a topological insulator.\n", "  We study the conformal bootstrap for a 4-point function of fermions\n$\\langle\\psi\\psi\\psi\\psi\\rangle$ in 3D. We first introduce an embedding\nformalism for 3D spinors and compute the conformal blocks appearing in fermion\n4-point functions. Using these results, we find general bounds on the\ndimensions of operators appearing in the $\\psi \\times \\psi$ OPE, and also on\nthe central charge $C_T$. We observe features in our bounds that coincide with\nscaling dimensions in the Gross-Neveu models at large $N$. We also speculate\nthat other features could coincide with a fermionic CFT containing no relevant\nscalar operators.\n", "  In de Sitter (dS) gravity, where gravity is a gauge field introduced to\nrealize the local dS invariance of the matter field, two kinds of conservation\nlaws are derived. The first kind is a differential equation for a dS-covariant\ncurrent, which unites the canonical energy-momentum (EM) and angular momentum\n(AM) tensors. The second kind presents a dS-invariant current which is\nconserved in the sense that its torsion-free divergence vanishes. The\ndS-invariant current unites the total (matter plus gravity) EM and AM currents.\nIt is well known that the AM current contains an inherent part, called the spin\ncurrent. Here it is shown that the EM tensor also contains an inherent part,\nwhich might be observed by its contribution to the deviation of the dust\nparticle's world line from a geodesic. All the results are compared to the\nordinary Lorentz gravity.\n", "  Interfacial undercooling is of significant importance on microscopic pattern\nformation in the solidification of colloidal suspensions. Two kinds of\ninterfacial undercooling are supposed to be involved in freezing colloidal\nsuspensions, i.e. solute constitutional supercooling (SCS) caused by additives\nin the solvent and particulate constitutional supercooling (PCS) caused by\nparticles. However, quantitatively identification of the interfacial\nundercooling of freezing colloidal suspensions is still absent and it is still\nunknown which undercooling is dominant. The revealing of interfacial\nundercooling is closely related to the design of ice-templating porous\nmaterials. Based on quantitative experimental measurements, we show that the\ninterfacial undercooling mainly comes from SCS caused by the additives in the\nsolvent, while the PCS can be ignored. This finding implies that the PCS theory\nis not the fundamental physical mechanism for patterning in the solidification\nof colloidal suspensions. Instead, the patterns in ice-templating method can be\ncontrolled effectively by adjusting the additives.\n", "  The processes that are involved in migration and extraction of melt from the\nmantle are not yet fully understood. Gaining a better understanding of material\nproperties of partially molten rock could help shed light on the behavior of\nmelt on larger scales in the mantle. In this study, we simulate\nthree-dimensional torsional deformation of a partially molten rock that\ncontains a rigid, spherical inclusion. We compare the computed porosity\npatterns to those found in recent laboratory experiments. The laboratory\nexperiments show emergence of melt-rich bands throughout the rock sample, and\npressure shadows around the inclusion. The numerical model displays similar\nmelt-rich bands only for a small bulk-to-shear-viscosity ratio (five or less).\nThe results are consistent with earlier two-dimensional numerical simulations;\nhowever, we show that it is easier to form melt-rich bands in three dimensions\ncompared to two. The addition of strain-rate dependence of the viscosity causes\na distinct change in the shape of pressure shadows around the inclusion. This\nchange in shape presents an opportunity for experimentalists to identify the\nstrain-rate dependence and therefore the dominant deformation mechanism in\ntorsion experiments with inclusions.\n", "  We demonstrate how to realize within supergravity a novel chaotic-type\ninflationary scenario driven by the radial parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs\nsuperfields causing the spontaneous breaking of a grand unified gauge symmetry\nat a scale assuming the value of the supersymmetric grand unification scale.\nThe superpotential is uniquely determined at the renormalizable level by the\ngauge symmetry and a continuous R symmetry. We select two types of Kahler\npotentials, which respect these symmetries as well as an approximate shift\nsymmetry. In particular, they include in a logarithm a dominant shift-symmetric\nterm proportional to a parameter c- together with a small term violating this\nsymmetry and characterized by a parameter c+. In both cases, imposing a lower\nbound on c-, inflation can be attained with subplanckian values of the original\ninflaton, while the corresponding effective theory respects perturbative\nunitarity for r+-=c+/c-<1. These inflationary models do not lead to\noverproduction of cosmic defects, are largely independent of the one-loop\nradiative corrections and accommodate, for natural values of r+-, observable\ngravitational waves consistently with all the current observational data. The\ninflaton mass is mostly confined in the range (3.7-8.1)x10^10 GeV.\n", "  We determine the minimum energy required to control the evolution of any\nmesoscopic quantum system in the presence of arbitrary Markovian noise\nprocesses. This result provides the mesoscopic equivalent of the fundamental\ncost of refrigeration, sets the minimum power consumption of mesoscopic devices\nthat operate out of equilibrium, and allows one to calculate the efficiency of\nany control protocol, whether it be open-loop or feedback control. As examples\nwe calculate the energy cost of maintaining a qubit in the ground state, the\nefficiency of resolved-sideband cooling of nano-mechanical resonators, and\ndiscuss the energy cost of quantum information processing.\n", "  We study theoretically the low-energy electric-dipole response of N=20\nisotones. We present results from a quasiparticle random-phase approximation\n(QRPA) and a continuum random-phase approximation (CRPA), and we compare them\nwith results for the mirror Z=20 nuclei. According to our analysis, enhanced E1\nstrength is expected energetically well below the giant dipole resonance in the\nproton-rich isotones. Large amounts of E1 strength in the asymmetric N=20\nisotones are predicted, unlike their equally asymmetric Z=20 mirror nuclei,\npointing unambiguously to the role of structural effects such as loose binding.\nA proton-skin oscillation could develop especially in 46Fe. The proper\ndescription of non localized threshold transitions and the nucleon effective\nmass in mean-field treatments may affect theoretical predictions. We call for\nsystematic theoretical investigations to quantify the role bulk-matter\nproperties, in anticipation of measurements of E1 transitions in proton-rich\nnuclei.\n", "  We study a system of $N\\gg 1$ degrees of freedom coupled via a smooth\nhomogeneous Gaussian vector field with both gradient and divergence-free\ncomponents. In the absence of coupling, the system is exponentially relaxing to\nan equilibrium with rate $\\mu$. We show that, while increasing the ratio of the\ncoupling strength to the relaxation rate, the system experiences an abrupt\ntransition from a topologically trivial phase portrait with a single\nequilibrium into a topologically non-trivial regime characterised by an\nexponential number of equilibria, the vast majority of which are expected to be\nunstable. It is suggested that this picture provides a global view on the\nnature of the May-Wigner instability transition originally discovered by local\nlinear stability analysis.\n", "  Flexible information routing fundamentally underlies the function of many\nbiological and artificial networks. Yet, how such systems may specifically\ncommunicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we\nidentify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective\ndynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective\ndynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing\npatterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy\nmeasures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of\nthis generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how\nindividual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to\nsystematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular\narchitectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local\ninterventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local\nnetwork-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing\ninformation routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs\nwith a communication function.\n", "  In this paper, a non-orthogonal multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice\nBoltzmann (LB) method for simulating incompressible thermal flows is presented.\nIn the method, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and temperature\nequation are solved separately by two different MRT-LB equations, which are\ndeveloped based on non-orthogonal basis vectors obtained from the combinations\nof the lattice velocity components. The macroscopic governing equations of\nincompressible thermal flows can be recovered from the method through the\nChapman-Enskog analysis in the incompressible limit. Numerical simulations of\nseveral typical two-dimensional problems are carried out to validate the\nproposed method. It is found that the present results are in good agreement\nwith the analytical solutions and/or other numerical results reported in the\nliterature. Furthermore, the non-orthogonal MRT-LB model shows better numerical\nstability in comparison with the BGK-LB model, and the grid convergence tests\nindicate that the present MRT-LB method has a second-order convergence rate in\nspace.\n", "  We show that the integration-by-parts reductions of various two-loop integral\ntopologies can be efficiently obtained by applying unitarity cuts to a specific\nset of subgraphs and solving associated polynomial (syzygy) equations.\n", "  We compute the conformal blocks associated with scalar-scalar-fermion-fermion\n4-point functions in 3D CFTs. Together with the known scalar conformal blocks,\nour result completes the task of determining the so-called `seed blocks' in\nthree dimensions. Conformal blocks associated with 4-point functions of\noperators with arbitrary spins can now be determined from these seed blocks by\nusing known differential operators.\n", "  We study the cosmological models in which an extended Chaplygin gas universe\nis merged with the braneworld scenario. In particular, we examine the\nrealization of Einstein static universe on the brane embedded in a non-constant\ncurvature bulk space and perform a detailed perturbation analysis. We extract\nthe stability conditions and find their impacts on the geometric equation of\nstate parameter and the spatial curvature of the universe.\n", "  A new parallel equilibrium reconstruction code for tokamak plasmas is\npresented. GPEC allows to compute equilibrium flux distributions sufficiently\naccurate to derive parameters for plasma control within 1 ms of runtime which\nenables real-time applications at the ASDEX Upgrade experiment (AUG) and other\nmachines with a control cycle of at least this size. The underlying algorithms\nare based on the well-established offline-analysis code CLISTE, following the\nclassical concept of iteratively solving the Grad-Shafranov equation and\nfeeding in diagnostic signals from the experiment. The new code adopts a hybrid\nparallelization scheme for computing the equilibrium flux distribution and\nextends the fast, shared-memory-parallel Poisson solver which we have described\npreviously by a distributed computation of the individual Poisson problems\ncorresponding to different basis functions. The code is based entirely on\nopen-source software components and runs on standard server hardware and\nsoftware environments. The real-time capability of GPEC is demonstrated by\nperforming an offline-computation of a sequence of 1000 flux distributions\nwhich are taken from one second of operation of a typical AUG discharge and\nderiving the relevant control parameters with a time resolution of a\nmillisecond. On current server hardware the new code allows employing a grid\nsize of 32x64 zones for the spatial discretization and up to 15 basis\nfunctions. It takes into account about 90 diagnostic signals while using up to\n4 equilibrium iterations and computing more than 20 plasma-control parameters,\nincluding the computationally expensive safety-factor q on at least 4 different\nlevels of the normalized flux.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the wave packet dynamics of the H$_2^+$\nmolecular ion in plasmon-enhanced laser fields. Such fields may be produced,\nfor instance, when metallic nano-structures are illuminated by a laser pulse of\nmoderated intensity. Their main property is that they vary in space on\nnanometer scales. We demonstrate that the spatial inhomogeneous character of\nthese plasmonic fields leads to an enhancement of electron localization, an\ninstrumental phenomenon that controls molecular fragmentation. We suggest that\nthe charge-imbalance induced by the surface-plasmon resonance near the metallic\nnano-structures is the origin of the increase in the electron localization.\n", "  We calculate the nonsymmetrized current noise in a quantum dot connected to\ntwo reservoirs by using the non-equilibrium Green function technique. We show\nthat both the current auto-correlator (inside a single reservoir) and the\ncurrent cross-correlator (between the two reservoirs) are expressed in terms of\ntransmission amplitude and coefficient through the barriers. We identify the\ndifferent energy-transfer processes involved in each contribution to the\nauto-correlator, and we highlight the fact that when there are several physical\nprocesses, the contribution results from a coherent superposition of scattering\npaths. Varying the gate and bias voltages, we discuss the profile of the\ndifferential Fano factor in light of recent experiments, and we identify the\nconditions for having a distinct value for the auto-correlator in the left and\nright reservoirs.\n", "  We obtain the general conditions for the emergence of odd-frequency\nsuperconducting pairing in a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system\nproximity-coupled to a superconductor, making minimal assumptions about both\nthe 2D system and the superconductor. Using our general results we show that a\nsimple heterostructure formed by a monolayer of a group VI transition metal\ndichalcogenide, such as molybdenum disulfide, and an s-wave superconductor with\nRashba spin-orbit coupling will exhibit odd-frequency superconducting pairing.\nFurthermore, we show that in such a heterostructure the odd-frequency pairing\namplitude will be proportional to the product of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nin the substrate and the spin-orbit coupling in the dichalcogenide layer.\n", "  Diffusiophoresis, a ubiquitous phenomenon that induces particle transport\nwhenever solute concentration gradients are present, was recently observed in\nthe context of microsystems and shown to strongly impact colloidal transport\n(patterning and mixing) at such scales. In the present work, we show\nexperimentally that this nanoscale mechanism can induce changes in the\nmacroscale mixing of colloids by chaotic advection. Rather than the decay of\nthe standard deviation of concentration, which is a global parameter commonly\nemployed in studies of mixing, we instead use multiscale tools adapted from\nstudies of chaotic flows or intermittent turbulent mixing: concentration\nspectra and second and fourth moments of the probability density functions of\nscalar gradients. Not only can these tools be used in open flows, but they also\nallow for scale-by-scale analysis. Strikingly, diffusiophoresis is shown to\naffect all scales, although more particularly the small ones, resulting in a\nchange of scalar intermittency and in an unusual scale bridging spanning more\nthan seven orders of magnitude. By quantifying the averaged impact of\ndiffusiophoresis on the macroscale mixing, we explain why the effects observed\nare consistent with the introduction of an effective P\\'eclet number.\n", "  We theoretically investigate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in Rydberg\natoms driven by spatially inhomogeneous laser fields, induced, for instance, by\nplasmonic enhancement. It is well known that the laser intensity should to\nexceed certain threshold in order to generate HHG, when noble gas atoms in\ntheir ground state are used as an active medium. One way to enhance the\ncoherent light coming from a conventional laser oscillator is to take advantage\nof the amplification obtained by the so-called surface plasmon polaritons,\ncreated when a low intensity laser field is focused onto a metallic\nnanostructure. The main limitation of this scheme is the low damage threshold\nof the materials employed in the nanostructures engineering. In this work we\npropose to use Rydberg atoms, driven by spatially inhomogeneous,\nplasmonic-enhanced laser fields, for HHG. We exhaustively discuss the behaviour\nand efficiency of these systems in the generation of coherent harmonic\nemission. To this aim we numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for an atom with an electron initially in a highly excited $n$-th\nRydberg state, located in the vicinity of a metallic nanostructure, where the\nelectric field changes spatially on the scales relevant for the dynamics of the\nlaser-ionized electron. We first use a one-dimensional model to investigate the\nphenomena systematically. We then employ a more realistic situation, when the\ninteraction of a plasmonic-enhanced laser field with a three-dimensional\nHydrogen atom is modelled. We discuss the scaling of the relevant input\nparameters with the principal quantum number $n$ of the Rydberg state in\nquestion, and demonstrate that harmonic emission could be achieved from Rydberg\natoms well below the damage threshold, thus without deteriorating the geometry\nand properties of the metallic nanostructure.\n", "  We present a novel realization of Starobinsky-type inflation within\nSupergravity using two chiral superfields. The proposed superpotential is\ninspired by induced-gravity models. The Kaehler potential contains two\nlogarithmic terms, one for the inflaton T and one for the matter-like field S,\nparameterizing the SU(1,1)/U(1)x SU(2)/U(1) Kaehler manifold. The two factors\nhave constant curvatures -m/n and 2/n2, where n, m are the exponents of T in\nthe superpotential and Kaehler potential respectively, and 0<n2<=6. The\ninflationary observables depend on the ratio 2n/m only. Essentially they\ncoincide with the observables of the original Starobinsky model. Moreover, the\ninflaton mass is predicted to be 3x10^13 GeV.\n", "  We adapt the Gurau's proof (2008) about the asymptotic limit of Ponzano-Regge\nformula to supersymmetric 6jS symbols according to their intrinsic parities\nalpha, beta, gamma. The behaviour at a large scaling shows significant\ndifferences depending on these parities. The decay is slowed and the angles of\nthe oscillating parts in cosine are generally shifted or more altered.Our\nresults should be relevant in 3-D Quantum Supergravity and Spin Foam models.\nPACS: 03.65.Fd Algebraic methods PACS: 04.60.-m Quantum gravity PACS: 11.30.Pb\nSupersymmetry MSC: 81Q60; 83D05.\n", "  A dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) system exploiting\nbuffer-gas-filled millimeter-scale vapor cells is presented. This system offers\nsimilar stability as achievable with conventional DAVLL system using bulk vapor\ncells, but has several important advantages. In addition to its compactness, it\nmay provide continuous stabilization in a multi-gigahertz range around the\noptical transition. This range may be controlled either by changing the\ntemperature of the vapor or by application of a buffer gas under an appropriate\npressure. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate the ability of the\nsystem to lock the laser frequency between two hyperfine components of the\n$^{85}$Rb ground state or as far as 16 GHz away from the closest optical\ntransition.\n", "  We complete the reformulation of the holographic correspondence as a\n\\emph{highly efficient RG flow} that can also determine the UV data in the\nfield theory in the strong coupling and large $N$ limit. We introduce a special\nway to define operators at any given scale in terms of appropriate\ncoarse-grained collective variables, without requiring the use of the\nelementary fields. The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the\ncut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria\nto determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective\nWard identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should\npreserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and\nsources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The\nsecond criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the\nactual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the\ncollective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final criterion\nis that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be transformed\nto a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with a\nfinite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativistic\nNavier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the time\ncoordinate. Using previous work, we explicitly show that in the hydrodynamic\nlimit each such highly efficient RG flow reproduces a unique classical gravity\ntheory with precise UV data that satisfy our IR criterion. We obtain the\nexplicit coarse-graining which reproduces Einstein's equations. In a simple\nexample, we are also able to compute the beta function. Finally, we show how\nour construction can be interpolated with the traditional Wilsonian RG flow at\na suitable scale, and can be used to develop new non-perturbative frameworks\nfor QCD-like theories.\n", "  The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum\ninformation, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental\nimplementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.\n", "  We revisit the conserved quantities of the spin-1/2 XY model with open\nboundary conditions. In the absence of a transverse field, we find new families\nof local charges and show that half of the seeming conservation laws are\nconserved only if the number of sites is odd. In even chains the set of\nnoninteracting charges is abelian, like in the periodic case when the number of\nsites is odd. In odd chains the set is doubled and becomes non-abelian, like in\neven periodic chains. The dependence of the charges on the parity of the\nchain's size undermines the common belief that the thermodynamic limit of\ndiagonal ensembles exists. We consider also the transverse-field Ising chain,\nwhere the situation is more ordinary. The generalization to the XY model in a\ntransverse field is not straightforward and we propose a general framework to\ncarry out similar calculations. We conjecture the form of the bulk part of the\nlocal charges and discuss the emergence of quasilocal conserved quantities. We\nprovide evidence that in a region of the parameter space there is a reduction\nof the number of quasilocal conservation laws invariant under chain inversion.\nAs a by-product, we study a class of block-Toeplitz-plus-Hankel operators and\nidentify the conditions that their symbols satisfy in order to commute with a\ngiven block-Toeplitz.\n", "  For spacetimes that are not asymptotic to anti-de Sitter Space (non AAdS), we\nadapt the Lewkowycz-Maldacena procedure to find the holographic entanglement\nentropy. The key observation, which to our knowledge is not very well\nappreciated, is that asymptotic boundary conditions play an essential role on\nextending the replica trick to the bulk. For non AAdS, we expect the following\nthree main modifications: (1) the expansion near the special surface has to be\ncompatible with the asymptotic expansion; (2) periodic conditions are imposed\nto coordinates on the phase space with diagonalized symplectic structure, not\nto all fields appearing in the action; (3) evaluating the entanglement\nfunctional using the boundary term method amounts to evaluating the\npresymplectic structure at the special surface, where some additional exact\nform may contribute. An explicit calculation is carried out for\nthree-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter spacetime (WAdS3) in a consistent\ntruncation of string theory, the so-called S-dual dipole theory. It turns out\nthat the generalized gravitational entropy in WAdS3 is captured by the least\naction of a charged particle in WAdS3 space, or equivalently, by the geodesic\nlength in an auxiliary AdS3. Consequently, the bulk calculation agrees with the\nCFT results, providing another piece of evidence for the WAdS3/CFT2\ncorrespondence.\n", "  A simple asperity model using random process theory is developed in the\npresence of adhesion. Using the DMT model for each individual asperity, and\nasymptotic results at large separations, a new adhesion parameter is found, on\nwhich the model depends, namely $\\theta=\\frac{w}{E^{\\ast}\\sqrt{m_{2}/\\pi}\nm_{0}^{1/2}}$, where $w,E^{\\ast},m_{2},m_{0}$ are respectively surface energy,\ncombined elastic modulus, variance of slopes and of heigths of the asperities.\nThis parameter perhaps improves the previous parameter proposed by Fuller and\nTabor which assumed identical asperities. the effects of adhesion are found in\npractice only for {\\theta}>0.15. Some implications are discussed and\ncomparisons with recent results are attempted.\n", "  A theoretical study on low-threshold multimode instabilities in quantum\ncascade lasers (QCLs) and laser diodes (LDs) is presented. Previously, low\nthreshold Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instabilities were reported in\nseveral experimental studies of QCLs. They were attributed so far to the\ncombined effect of the induced grating of carrier population and of a built-in\nsaturable absorption feature that may be present in the monolithic\nsingle-section cavity of these Fabry-P\\'erot lasers. Here we show that\nlow-threshold RNGH instabilities in QCLs occur due to a carrier coherence\ngrating induced in the gain medium and not due to intracavity saturable\nabsorption. We find that QCLs with a few mm long cavity exhibit intermittent\nRNGH self-pulsations while regular self-pulsations are possible in short-cavity\nQCLs, with the cavity length of 100 um or smaller. We examine a transient\nbehavior to RNGH self-pulsations in short-cavity QCLs and find features that\nresemble cooperative superradiance. Our findings open a practical way of\nachieving ultra-short pulse production regimes in the mid-infrared spectral\nrange. Applying same approach to semiconductor laser diodes (LDs) we explain\nthe absence of RNGH self-pulsation in LDs based on a quantum well gain media,\nwhile practically established method for reaching the ultrafast coherent\nemission regimes in LDs is to incorporate a separately contacted saturable\nabsorber section in the LD cavity.\n", "  We introduce a new quantity for describing nonclassicality of an arbitrary\noptical two-mode Gaussian state which remains invariant under any global\nphoton-number preserving unitary transformation of the covariance matrix of the\nstate. The invariant naturally splits into an entanglement monotone and local\nnonclassicality quantifiers applied to the reduced states. This shows how\nentanglement can be converted into local squeezing and vice versa. Twin beams\nand their transformations at a beam splitter are analyzed as an example\nproviding squeezed light. An extension of this approach to pure three-mode\nGaussian states is given.\n", "  We study the Casimir effect in the vicinity of a quantum critical point. As a\nprototypical system we analyze the $d$-dimensional imperfect (mean-field) Bose\ngas enclosed in a slab of extension $L^{d-1}\\times D$ and subject to periodic\nboundary conditions. The thermodynamic state is adjusted so that\n$L\\gg\\lambda\\gg D\\gg\\l_{mic}$, where $\\lambda\\sim T^{-1/2}$ is the thermal de\nBroglie length, and $l_{mic}$ denotes microscopic lengthscales. Our exact\nanalysis indicates that the Casimir force in the above specified regime is\ngenerically repulsive and decays either algebraically or exponentially, with a\nnon-universal amplitude.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy between the two outgoing particles in an\nelastic scattering process. It is formulated within an S-matrix formalism using\nthe partial wave expansion of two-body states, which plays a significant role\nin our computation. As a result, we obtain a novel formula that expresses the\nentanglement entropy in a high energy scattering by the use of physical\nobservables, namely the elastic and total cross sections and a physical bound\non the impact parameter range, related to the elastic differential\ncross-section.\n", "  We perform molecular dynamics simulations for a silica glass former model\nproposed by Coslovich and Pastore (CP) over a wide range of densities. The\ndensity variation can be mapped onto the change of the potential depth between\nSi and O interactions of the CP model. By reducing the potential depth (or\nincreasing the density), the anisotropic tetrahedral network structure observed\nin the original CP model transforms into the isotropic structure with the\npurely repulsive soft-sphere potential. Correspondingly, the temperature\ndependence of the relaxation time exhibits the crossover from the Arrhenius to\nthe super-Arrhenius behavior. Being able to control the fragility over a wide\nrange by tuning the potential of a single model system helps us to bridge the\ngap between the network and isotropic glass formers and to obtain the insight\ninto the underlying mechanism of the fragility. We study the relationship\nbetween the fragility and dynamical properties such as the magnitude of the\nStokes-Einstein violation and the stretch exponent in the density correlation\nfunction. We also demonstrate that the peak of the specific heat systematically\nshifts as the density increases, hinting that the fragility is correlated with\nthe hidden thermodynamic anomalies of the system.\n", "  We investigate the capability of density functional theory (DFT) to\nappropriately describe the spin susceptibility, $\\chi_s$, and the intervalley\nelectron-phonon coupling in Li$_x$ZrNCl. At low doping, Li$_x$ZrNCl behaves as\na two-dimensional two-valley electron gas, with parabolic bands. In such a\nsystem, $\\chi_s$ increases with decreasing doping because of the\nelectron-electron interaction. We show that DFT with local functionals\n(LDA/GGA) is not capable of reproducing this behavior. The use of exact\nexchange in Hartree-Fock (HF) or in DFT hybrid functionals enhances $\\chi_s$.\nHF, B3LYP, and PBE0 approaches overestimate $\\chi_s$, whereas the\nrange-separated HSE06 functional leads to results similar to those obtained in\nthe random phase approximation (RPA) applied to a two-valley two-spin electron\ngas. Within HF, Li$_x$ZrNCl is even unstable towards a ferromagnetic state for\n$x<0.16$. The intervalley phonons induce an imbalance in the valley occupation\nthat can be viewed as the effect of a pseudomagnetic field. Thus, similarly to\nwhat happens for $\\chi_s$, the electron-phonon coupling of intervalley phonons\nis enhanced by the electron-electron interaction. Only hybrid DFT functionals\ncapture such an enhancement and the HSE06 functional reproduces the RPA results\npresented in M. Calandra {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 114}, 077001\n(2015)]. These results imply that the description of the susceptibility and\nelectron-phonon coupling with a range-separated hybrid functional would be\nimportant also in other two-dimensional weakly doped semiconductors, such as\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides and graphene.\n", "  By mapping the strong interaction between Rydberg excitations in ultra-cold\natomic ensembles onto single photons via electromagnetically induced\ntransparency, it is now possible to realize a nonlinear optical medium which\nexhibits a strong optical nonlinearity at the level of individual photons. We\nreview the theoretical concepts and the experimental state-of-the-art of this\nexciting new field, and discuss first applications in the field of all-optical\nquantum information processing.\n", "  Gauge-flation model at zeroth order in cosmological perturbation theory\noffers an interesting scenario for realizing inflation within a particle\nphysics context, allowing us to investigate interesting possible connections\nbetween inflation and the subsequent evolution of the Universe. Difficulties,\nhowever, arise at the perturbative level, thus motivating a modification of the\noriginal model. In order to agree with the latest Planck observations, we\nmodify the model such that the new dynamics can produce a relation between the\nspectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ allowed by the data.\nBy including an identical mass term for each of the fields of the system, we\nfind interesting dynamics leading to slow-roll inflation of the right length.\nThe presence of the mass term has the potential to modify the $n_{s}$ vs. $r$\nrelation so as to agree with the data. As a first step, we study the model at\nzeroth order in cosmological perturbation theory, finding the conditions\nrequired for slow-roll inflation and the number of e-foldings of inflation.\nNumerical solutions are used to explore the impact of the mass term. We\nconclude that the massive version of Gauge-flation offers a viable inflationary\nmodel.\n", "  A new algorithm for the determination of the initial flavour of $B_s^0$\nmesons is presented. The algorithm is based on two neural networks and exploits\nthe $b$ hadron production mechanism at a hadron collider. The first network is\ntrained to select charged kaons produced in association with the $B_s^0$ meson.\nThe second network combines the kaon charges to assign the $B_s^0$ flavour and\nestimates the probability of a wrong assignment. The algorithm is calibrated\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$ collected\nby the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV\ncentre-of-mass energies. The calibration is performed in two ways: by resolving\nthe $B_s^0$-$\\bar{B}_s^0$ flavour oscillations in $B_s^0 \\to D_s^- \\pi^+$\ndecays, and by analysing flavour-specific $B_{s 2}^{*}(5840)^0 \\to B^+ K^-$\ndecays. The tagging power measured in $B_s^0 \\to D_s^- \\pi^+$ decays is found\nto be $(1.80 \\pm 0.19({\\rm stat}) \\pm 0.18({\\rm syst}))$\\%, which is an\nimprovement of about 50\\% compared to a similar algorithm previously used in\nthe LHCb experiment.\n", "  We investigate the recent evidence for a charged $X(5568)$ meson as an exotic\nopen-flavor tetraquark state $su\\bar b\\bar d$ with $J^P=0^+/1^+$ in the\nframework of QCD sum rules. We use the color antisymmetric $[\\mathbf{\\bar\n3_c}]_{su} \\otimes [\\mathbf{3_c}]_{\\bar{b}\\bar d}$ tetraquark currents in both\nscalar and axial-vector channels to perform evaluations and numerical analyses.\nOur results imply that the $X(5568)$ can be interpreted as both the scalar\n$su\\bar b\\bar d$ tetraquark state and the axial-vector one, which are in good\nagreement with the experimental measurement. We also discuss the possible decay\npatterns of the $X(5568)$ and suggest to search for its neutral partner in the\nradiative decay into $B_s^0 \\gamma$ and $B_s^* \\gamma$, which can be used to\ndetermine its spin-parity quantum numbers. Moreover, we predict its charmed\npartner state around $2.55$ GeV with the quark content $su\\bar c\\bar d$ and\n$J^P=0^+/1^+$.\n", "  In zero magnetic field, the famous neutron spin resonance in the f-electron\nsuperconductor CeCoIn5 is similar to the recently discovered exciton peak in\nthe non-superconducting CeB6. Magnetic field splits the resonance in CeCoIn5\ninto two components, indicating that it is a doublet. Here we employ inelastic\nneutron scattering (INS) to scrutinize the field dependence of spin\nfluctuations in CeB6. The exciton shows a markedly different behavior without\nany field splitting. Instead, we observe a second field-induced magnon whose\nenergy increases with field. At the ferromagnetic zone center, however, we find\nonly a single mode with a non-monotonic field dependence. At low fields, it is\ninitially suppressed to zero together with the antiferromagnetic order\nparameter, but then reappears at higher fields inside the hidden-order phase,\nfollowing the energy of an electron spin resonance (ESR). This is a unique\nexample of a ferromagnetic resonance in a heavy-fermion metal seen by both ESR\nand INS consistently over a broad range of magnetic fields.\n", "  The inclusive production of the $\\psi$(2S) charmonium state was studied as a\nfunction of centrality in p-Pb collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center of mass\nenergy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement was\nperformed with the ALICE detector in the center of mass rapidity ranges\n$-4.46<y_{\\rm cms}<-2.96$ and $2.03<y_{\\rm cms}<3.53$, down to zero transverse\nmomentum, by reconstructing the $\\psi$(2S) decay to a muon pair. The $\\psi$(2S)\nproduction cross section $\\sigma_{\\psi(\\rm 2S)}$ is presented as a function of\nthe collision centrality, which is estimated through the energy deposited in\nforward rapidity calorimeters. The relative strength of nuclear effects on the\n$\\psi$(2S) and on the corresponding 1S charmonium state J/$\\psi$ is then\nstudied by means of the double ratio of cross sections $[\\sigma_{\\psi(\\rm\n2S)}/\\sigma_{\\rm J/\\psi}]_{\\rm pPb}/[\\sigma_{\\psi(\\rm 2S)}/\\sigma_{\\rm\nJ/\\psi}]_{\\rm pp}$ between p-Pb and pp collisions, and by the values of the\nnuclear modification factors for the two charmonium states. The results show a\nlarge suppression of $\\psi$(2S) production relative to the J/$\\psi$ at backward\n(negative) rapidity, corresponding to the flight direction of the Pb-nucleus,\nwhile at forward (positive) rapidity the suppressions of the two states are\ncomparable. Finally, comparisons to results from lower energy experiments and\nto available theoretical models are presented.\n", "  I introduce a dynamical field theory to describe the glassy behavior in\nsupercooled liquids. The mean-field approximation of the theory predicts a\ndynamical arrest transition, as in ideal Mode-Coupling-Theory and mean-field\ndiscontinuous Spin-Glass Models. Instead {\\it beyond} the mean-field\napproximation the theory predicts that the transition is avoided and\ntransformed into a crossover, as observed in experiments and simulations. To go\nbeyond mean-field a standard perturbative loop expansion is performed at first.\nApproaching the ideal critical point this expansion is divergent at all orders\nand I show that the leading divergent term at any given order is the same of a\ndynamical stochastic equation, called Stochastic-Beta-Relaxation (SBR) in {\\it\nEPL 106, 56003 (2014)}. At variance with the original theory SBR can be studied\nbeyond mean-field directly, without the need to resort to a perturbative\nexpansion. Thus it provides a qualitative and quantitative description of the\ndynamical crossover. For consistency reasons it is important to establish the\nconnection between the dynamical field theory and SBR beyond perturbation\ntheory. This can be done with the help of a stronger result: the dynamical\nfield theory is {\\it exactly} equivalent to a theory with quenched disorder.\nQualitatively the non-perturbative mechanism leading to the crossover is\ntherefore the same of SBR. Quantitatively SBR corresponds to make the\nmean-field approximation once the quenched disorder has been generated.\n", "  In this work we study the entanglement entropy of a uniform quantum Ising\nchain in transverse field undergoing a periodic driving of period $\\tau$ . By\nmeans of Floquet theory we show that, for any subchain, the entanglement\nentropy tends asymptotically to a value $\\tau$ - periodic in time. We provide a\nsemi-analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic regime: It is\nconstant in time and obeys a volume law. The entropy in the asymptotic regime\nis always smaller than the thermal one: because of integrability the system\nlocally relaxes to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) density matrix. The\nleading term of the asymptotic entanglement entropy is completely determined by\nthis GGE density matrix. Remarkably, the asymptotic entropy shows marked\nfeatures in correspondence to some non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions\nundergone by a Floquet state analog of the ground state.\n", "  Accumulation layers with very large concentrations of electrons where many\nsubbands are filled became recently available due to ionic liquid and other new\nmethods of gating. The low temperature mobility in such layers is limited by\nthe surface roughness scattering. However theories of roughness scattering so\nfar dealt only with the small-density single subband two-dimensional electron\ngas (2DEG). Here we develop a theory of roughness-scattering limited mobility\nfor the multisubband large concentration case. We show that with growing 2D\nelectron concentration $n$ the surface dimensionless conductivity\n$\\sigma/(2e^2/h)$ first decreases as $\\propto n^{-6/5}$ and then saturates as\n$\\sim(da_B/\\Delta^2)\\gg 1$, where $d$ and $\\Delta$ are the characteristic\nlength and height of the surface roughness, $a_B$ is the effective Bohr radius.\nThis means that in spite of the shrinkage of the 2DEG width and the related\nincrease of the scattering rate, the 2DEG remains a good metal. Thus, there is\nno re-entrant metal-insulator transition at high concentrations conjectured by\nDas Sarma and Hwang [PRB 89, 121413 (2014)].\n", "  Aiming to relate leptonic CP violating phase $\\delta $ to the cosmological CP\nasymmetry, we study the extension of MSSM by two quasi-degenerate (strictly\ndegenerate at tree level) right-handed neutrinos and consider all possible two\ntexture zero 3x2 Yukawa matrices plus one $\\Delta L=2$ dimension five (d=5)\noperator contributing to the light neutrino mass matrix. We classify all\nexperimentally viable mass matrices, leading to several predictions, and\nanalytically derive predictive relations. We also relate the CP violating\n$\\delta$ phase to the CP phase of the thermal leptogenesis.\n", "  It is a long-standing question whether the confinement of matter fields in\nQCD has an imprint in the (gauge-dependent) correlation functions, especially\nthe propagators. As the analytic structure plays an important role in this\nquestion, high-precision data is necessary for lattice investigations. Also, it\nis interesting how this depends on the dimensionality of the theory. To make a\nstudy over a wide range of parameters possible this suggests to use scalar\nparticles. This is done here: The propagator of a fundamental scalar is studied\nin two, three, and four dimensions in quenched SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in\nminimal Landau gauge, both in momentum space and position space. Particular\nemphasis is put on the effects of renormalization. The results suggest a quite\nintricate volume dependence and the presence of an intrinsic mass scale, but no\nobvious connection to confinement.\n", "  Several methods of generating three constituent-quarks in a nucleon are\nevaluated which explicitly maintain the nucleon's center of mass and desired\nradial distribution and can be used within Monte Carlo Glauber frameworks. The\ngeometric models provided by each method are used to generate distributions\nover the number of constituent-quark participants ($N_{qp}$) in $p+p$, $d+$Au\nand Au$+$Au collisions. The results are compared with each other and to a\nprevious result of $N_{qp}$ calculations, without this explicit constraint,\nused in measurements of $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV $p+p$, $d+$Au and Au$+$Au\ncollisions at RHIC.\n", "  The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains enigmatic. Highly energetic\nradio pulses of millisecond duration, FRBs are observed with dispersion\nmeasures consistent with an extragalactic source. A variety of models have been\nproposed to explain their origin. One popular class of theorized FRB progenitor\nis the coalescence of compact binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black\nholes. Such coalescence events are strong gravitational-wave emitters. We\ndemonstrate that measurements made by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave\nobservatories can be leveraged to severely constrain the validity of FRB binary\ncoalescence models. Existing measurements constrain the binary black hole rate\nto approximately $5\\%$ of the FRB rate, and results from Advanced LIGO's O1 and\nO2 observing runs may place similarly strong constraints on the fraction of\nFRBs due to binary neutron star and neutron star--black hole progenitors.\n", "  Taking a quantum corrected form of Raychaudhuri equation in a geometric\nbackground described by a Lorentz-violating massive theory of gravity, we go\nthrough investigating a time-like congruence of massive gravitons affected by a\nBohmian quantum potential. We find some definite conditions upon which these\ngravitons are confined to diverging Bohmian trajectories. The respective\nbehaviour of those quantum potentials are also derived and discussed.\nAdditionally, and through a relativistic quantum treatment of a typical wave\nfunction, we demonstrate schematic conditions on the associated frequency to\nthe gravitons, in order to satisfy the necessity of divergence.\n", "  Using time-dependent density functional theory (tdDFT) with exchange kernels\nwe calculate and test imaginary frequency-dependent dipole polarizabilities for\nall atoms and many ns in rows 1-6 of the periodic table. These are then\nintegrated over frequency to produce $C_6$ coefficients. Results are presented\nunder different models: straight tdDFT calculations using two different\nkernels, \"benchmark\" tdDFT calculations corrected by more accurate quantum\nchemical and experimental data, and \"benchmark\" tdDFT with frozen orbital\nanions. Parametrisations are presented for 411+ atoms and ions, allowing\nresults to be easily used by other researchers. A curious relationship,\n$C_{6,XY}\\propto [\\alpha_X(0)\\alpha_Y(0)]^{0.73}$ is found between $C_6$\ncoefficients and static polarizabilities $\\alpha(0)$. The relationship\n$C_{6,XY}=2C_{6,X}C_{6,Y}/[\\alpha_X/\\alpha_YC_{6,Y}+\\alpha_Y/\\alpha_XC_{6,X}]$\nis tested and found to work well ($<5$\\% errors) in about 80\\% of cases, but\ncan break down badly ($>30$\\% errors) in a small fraction of cases.\n", "  We study the generic features of minimal gauge extensions of the Standard\nModel in view of recent hints of lepton-flavor non-universality in\nsemi-leptonic $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $b \\to c \\ell \\nu$ decays. We\nclassify the possible models according to the symmetry-breaking pattern and the\nsource of flavor non-universality. We find that in viable models the\n$\\mathrm{SU(2)}_L$ factor is embedded non-trivially in the extended gauge\ngroup, and that gauge couplings should be universal, hinting to the presence of\nnew degrees of freedom sourcing non-universality. Finally, we provide an\nexplicit model that can explain the $B$-decay anomalies in a coherent way and\nconfront it with the relevant phenomenological constraints.\n", "  We develop a numerical test of hyperbolicity of chaotic dynamics in\ntime-delay systems. The test is based on the angle criterion and includes\ncomputation of angle distributions between expanding, contracting and neutral\nmanifolds of trajectories on the attractor. Three examples are tested. For two\nof them previously predicted hyperbolicity is confirmed. The third one provides\nan example of a time-delay system with nonhyperbolic chaos.\n", "  We investigate the real-time dynamics of open quantum spin-$1/2$ or hardcore\nboson systems on a spatial lattice, which are governed by a Markovian quantum\nmaster equation. We derive general conditions under which the hierarchy of\ncorrelation functions closes such that their time evolution can be computed\nsemi-analytically. Expanding our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 93, 021602 (2016)]\nwe demonstrate the universality of a purely dissipative quantum Markov process\nthat drives the system of spin-$1/2$ particles into a totally symmetric\nsuperposition state, corresponding to a Bose-Einstein condensate of hardcore\nbosons. In particular, we show that the finite-size scaling behavior of the\ndissipative gap is independent of the chosen boundary conditions and the\nunderlying lattice structure. In addition, we consider the effect of a uniform\nmagnetic field as well as a coupling to a thermal bath to investigate the\nsusceptibility of the engineered dissipative process to unitary and nonunitary\nperturbations. We establish the nonequilibrium steady-state phase diagram as a\nfunction of temperature and dissipative coupling strength. For a small number\nof particles $N$, we identify a parameter region in which the engineered\nsymmetrizing dissipative process performs robustly, while in the thermodynamic\nlimit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, the coupling to the thermal bath destroys any\nlong-range order.\n", "  Recent experiments find the signal of giant nonlocal resistance $R_{NL}$ in\nH-shaped graphene samples due to the spin/valley Hall effect. Interestingly,\nwhen the Fermi energy deviates from the Dirac point, $R_{NL}$ decreases to zero\nmuch more rapidly compared with the local resistance $R_L$, and the well-known\nrelation of $R_{NL}\\propto R_L^3$ is not satisfied. In this work, based on the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method, we explain such transport phenomena in\nthe H-shaped graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. When the Fermi energy is\nnear the Dirac point, the nonlocal resistance is considerably large and is much\nsharper than the local one. Moreover, the relationship between the Rashba\neffect and the fast decay of $R_{NL}$ compared with $R_L$ is further\ninvestigated. We find that the Rashba effect does not contribute not only to\nthe fast decay but also to the peak of $R_{NL}$ itself. Actually, it is the\nextremely small density of states near the Dirac point that leads to the large\npeak of $R_{NL}$, while the fast decay results from the quasi-ballistic\nmechanism. Finally, we revise the classic formula $R_{NL}\\propto R_L^3$ by\nreplacing $R_{NL}$ with $R_{Hall}$, which represents the nonlocal resistance\nmerely caused by the spin Hall effect, and the relation holds well.\n", "  Results of accurate computations of bound states in three- and four-electron\natomic systems are discussed. Bound state properties of the four-electron\nlithium ion Li$^{-}$ in its ground $2^{2}S-$state are determined from the\nresults of accurate, variational computations. We also consider a closely\nrelated problem of accurate numerical evaluation of the half-life of the\nberyllium-7 isotope. This problem is of paramount importance for modern\nradiochemistry.\n", "  By extending the dynamical coupled-channels analysis performed in our\nprevious work [Phys. Rev. C 88, 035209 (2013)] to include the available data of\nphotoproduction of pi meson off the neutron, the transition amplitudes for the\nphoto-excitation of the neutron to nucleon resonances, gamma n --> N*, at the\nresonance pole positions are determined. The combined fits to the data for both\nthe proton- and neutron-target reactions also revise our results for the\nresonance pole positions and the gamma p --> N* transition amplitudes. Our\nresults allow an isospin decomposition of the gamma N --> N* transition\namplitudes for the isospin I=1/2 N* resonances, which is necessary for testing\nhadron structure models and gives crucial inputs for constructing models of\nneutrino-induced reactions in the nucleon resonance region.\n", "  Our current societies increasingly rely on electronic repositories of\ncollective knowledge. An archetype of these databases is the Web of Science\n(WoS) that stores scientific publications. In contrast to several other forms\nof knowledge -- e.g., Wikipedia articles -- a scientific paper does not change\nafter its \"birth\". Nonetheless, from the moment a paper is published it exists\nwithin the evolving web of other papers, thus, its actual meaning to the reader\nchanges. To track how scientific ideas (represented by groups of scientific\npapers) appear and evolve, we apply a novel combination of algorithms\nexplicitly allowing for papers to change their groups. We (i) identify the\noverlapping clusters of the undirected yearly co-citation networks of the WoS\n(1975-2008) and (ii) match these yearly clusters (groups) to form group\ntimelines. After visualizing the longest lived groups of the entire data set we\nassign topic labels to the groups. We find that in the entire Web of Science\nmultidisciplinarity is clearly over-represented among cutting edge ideas. In\naddition, we provide detailed examples for papers that (i) change their topic\nlabels and (ii) move between groups.\n", "  We revisit the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and present a path integral\nversion of this important canonical transformation. The equivalence between the\nlow-energy sector of the Anderson model in the so-called local moment regime\nand the spin-isotropic Kondo model is usually established via a canonical\ntransformation performed on the Hamiltonian, followed by a projection. Here we\npresent a path integral formulation of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\nwhich relates the functional integral form of the partition function of the\nAnderson model to that of its effective low-energy model. The resulting\nfunctional integral assumes the form of a spin path integral and includes a\ngeometric phase factor, i.e. a Berry phase. Our approach stresses the\nunderlying symmetries of the model and allows for a straightforward\ngeneralization of the transformation to more involved models. It thus not only\nsheds new light on a classic problem, it also offers a systematic route of\nobtaining effective low-energy models and higher order corrections.\n", "  Here we consider the speed at which quantum information can be transferred\nbetween the nodes of a linear network. Because such nodes are linear\noscillators, this speed is also important in the cooling and state preparation\nof mechanical oscillators, as well as frequency conversion. We show that if\nthere is no restriction on the size of the linear coupling between two\noscillators, then there exist control protocols that will swap their respective\nstates with high fidelity within a time much less than a single oscillation\nperiod. Standard gradient search methods fail to find these fast protocols. We\nwere able to do so by augmenting standard search methods with a path-tracing\ntechnique, demonstrating that this technique has remarkable power to solve\ntime-optimal control problems, as well as confirming the highly challenging\nnature of these problems. As a further demonstration of the power of\npath-tracing, first introduced by Moore-Tibbets et al. [Phys. Rev. A 86, 062309\n(2012)], we apply it to the generation of entanglement in a linear network.\n", "  Information on the lattice parameter of single crystals with known\ncrystallographic structure allows for estimations of sample quality and\ncomposition. In many cases it is suffcient to determine one lattice parameter\nor the lattice spacing along a certain, high-symmetry direction, e.g. in order\nto determine the composition in a substitution series by taking advantage of\nVegard's rule. Here we present a guide to accurate measurements of single\ncrystals with dimensions ranging from 200 $\\mu$m up to several millimeter using\na standard powder diffractometer in Bragg-Brentano geometry. The correction of\nthe error introduced by the sample height and the optimization of the alignment\nare discussed in detail. In particular for single crystals with a plate-like\nhabit, the described procedure allows for measurement of the lattice spacings\nnormal to the plates with high accuracy on a timescale of minutes.\n", "  The reflection of a triple-shock configuration was studied numerically in two\ndimensions using the Navier-Stokes equations. The flow field was initialized\nusing three shock theory, and the reflection of the triple point on a plane of\nsymmetry was studied. The conditions simulated a stoichiometric methane-oxygen\ndetonation cell at low pressure on time scales preceding ignition, when the gas\nwas assumed to be inert. Viscosity was found to play an important role on some\nshock reflection mechanisms believed to accelerate reaction rates in\ndetonations when time scales are small. A small wall jet was present in the\ndouble Mach reflection and increased in size with Reynolds number, eventually\nforming a small vortex. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities were absent and there\nwas no Mach stem bifurcation at Reynolds numbers corresponding to when the Mach\nstem had travelled distances on the scale of the induction length.\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are found to not likely be a source of rapid\nreactions in detonations at time scales commensurate with the ignition delay\nbehind the Mach stem.\n", "  Vacuum birefringence is one of the most striking predictions of strong field\nquantum electrodynamics: Probe photons traversing a strong field region can\nindirectly sense the applied \"pump\" electromagnetic field via quantum\nfluctuations of virtual charged particles which couple to both pump and probe\nfields. This coupling is sensitive to the field alignment and can effectively\nresult in two different indices of refraction for the probe photon polarization\nmodes giving rise to a birefringence phenomenon. In this article we perform a\ndedicated theoretical analysis of the proposed discovery experiment of vacuum\nbirefringence at a x-ray free electron laser/optical high-intensity laser\nfacility. Describing both pump and probe laser pulses realistically in terms of\ntheir macroscopic electromagnetic fields, we go beyond previous analyses by\naccounting for various effects not considered before in this context. Our study\nfacilitates stringent quantitative predictions and optimizations of the signal\nin an actual experiment.\n", "  We show the first solvable chaotic synchronization model of unidirectionally\ncoupled dynamical systems. We establish a new interpretation of the conditional\nLyapunov exponent that characterizes chaotic synchronization completely.\nMoreover, we newly show how the conditional Lyapunov exponent relates to common\nnoise-induced synchronization phenomena by the new interpretation.\n", "  The total number of Hawking quanta emitted during the evaporation of a\nSchwarzschild black hole is proportional to the square of the initial mass or,\nequivalently, to the Bekenstein entropy. This simple, but little appreciated,\nfact is interpreted in terms of the recent discovery of black hole soft hair.\n", "  Nanocomposite oxide high-temperature bulk superconductors can be used as\nquasi-magnets. Thanks to the recent progress of material processing,\nquasi-magnet with 26 mm diameter can generate a large field of 17.6 T at 26 K.\nThese results are highly attractive for applications, involving levitation of\npermanent magnets on the bulk superconductors. Indeed, several other\napplications such as motors and magnetic resonance microscope using bulk\nsuperconductors have been proposed and demonstrated. In this chapter, we\ndescribe several techniques to improve the magnetic properties for bulk\nsuperconductors together with some basics such as phase diagrams and\nsolidifications.\n", "  Theoretical analysis of e-cloud instability in the Fermilab Recycler is\nrepresented in the paper. The e-cloud in strong magnetic field is treated as a\nset of immovable snakes each being initiated by some proton bunch. It is shown\nthat the instability arises because of injection errors of the bunches which\nincrease in time and from bunch to bunch along the batch being amplified by the\ne-cloud electric field. The particular attention is given to nonlinear\nadditions to the cloud field. It is shown that the nonlinearity is the main\nfactor which restricts growth of the bunch amplitude. Possible role of the\nfield free parts of the Recycler id discussed as well. Results of calculations\nare compared with experimental data demonstrating good correlation.\n", "  Levy walks define a fundamental concept in random walk theory which allows\none to model diffusive spreading that is faster than Brownian motion. They have\nmany applications across different disciplines. However, so far the derivation\nof a diffusion equation for an n-dimensional correlated Levy walk remained\nelusive. Starting from a fractional Klein-Kramers equation here we use a moment\nmethod combined with a Cattaneo approximation to derive a fractional diffusion\nequation for superdiffusive short range auto-correlated Levy walks in the large\ntime limit, and solve it. Our derivation discloses different dynamical\nmechanisms leading to correlated Levy walk diffusion in terms of quantities\nthat can be measured experimentally.\n", "  Quantum gravity theories predict a minimal length at the order of magnitude\nof the Planck length, under which the concepts of space and time lose every\nphysical meaning. In quantum mechanics, the insurgence of such minimal length\ncan be described by introducing a modified position-momentum commutator, which\nin turn yields a generalized uncertainty principle, where the uncertainty on\nthe position measurement has a lower bound. The value of the minimal length is\nnot predicted by theories and must be evaluated experimentally. In this paper,\nwe address the quantum bound to estimability of the minimal uncertainty length\nby performing measurements on a harmonic oscillator, which is analytically\nsolvable in the deformed algebra of the Hilbert subspace.\n", "  Integration-by-parts reductions play a central role in perturbative QFT\ncalculations. They allow the set of Feynman integrals contributing to a given\nobservable to be reduced to a small set of basis integrals, and they moreover\nfacilitate the computation of those basis integrals. We introduce an efficient\nnew method for generating integration-by-parts reductions. This method\nsimplifies the task by making use of generalized-unitarity cuts and turns the\nproblem of finding the needed total derivatives into one of solving certain\npolynomial (so-called syzygy) equations.\n", "  The structures and the associated gauge algebra of ABJM theory in ${\\cal\nN}=1$ superspace are reviewed. We derive the Ward identities of the theory in\nthe class of Lorentz-type gauges at quantum level to justify the\nrenormalizability of the model. We compute the Nielsen identities for the\ntwo-point functions of the theory with the help of enlarged BRST\ntransformation. The identities are derived in ABJM theory to ensure the gauge\nindependence of the physical poles of the Green's functions.\n", "  We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, D- and B-meson physics with\nthe aim of making them easily accessible to the particle physics community.\nMore specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses,\nthe form factor f+(0), arising in the semileptonic K -> pi transition at zero\nmomentum transfer, as well as the decay constant ratio fK/fpi and its\nconsequences for the CKM matrix elements Vus and Vud. Furthermore, we describe\nthe results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of\nSU(2)LxSU(2)R and SU(3)LxSU(3)R Chiral Perturbation Theory. We review the\ndetermination of the BK parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the\nadditional four B parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the\nStandard Model. The latter quantities are an addition compared to the previous\nreview. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for mc and mb (also new\ncompared to the previous review), as well as those for D- and B-meson decay\nconstants, form factors, and mixing parameters. These are the heavy-quark\nquantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the\nglobal CKM unitarity-triangle fit. Finally, we review the status of lattice\ndeterminations of the strong coupling constant alpha_s.\n", "  I review recent progress in lattice computations relevant for $B$- and charm\nphysics, focusing on decay and mixing amplitudes with a direct impact on CKM\nanalysis. Emphasis is put on the interplay with the upcoming new generation of\nexperimental results, and the subsequent challenges for lattice computations in\nthe heavy quark sector.\n", "  We investigate the motion of a flexible Stokesean flagellar swimmer realised\nas a yarn made of two intertwined elastomer fibres, one active, that can\nreversibly change its length in response to a local excitation causing\ntransition to the nematic state or swelling, and the other one, a passive\nisotropic elastomer with identical mechanical properties. A propagating\nchemical wave may provide an excitation mechanism ensuring a constant length of\nthe excited region. Generally, the swimmer moves along a helical trajectory,\nand the propagation and rotation velocity are very sensitive to the ratio of\nthe excited region to the pitch of the yarn, as well as to the size of a\ncarried load. External excitation by a moving beam is less effective, unless\nthe direction of the beam is adjusted to rotation of the swimmer.\n", "  Speculations and theories about the existence of other worlds have a long\nhistory. In recent times, the arguments have shifted away from their typical\nphilosophical and theological character to supposedly become more objective\nthanks to their scientific underpinnings. A prime example of this is the\ncurrent parallel universes or multiverse theory, which has the support of a\nnumber of famous cosmologists. In this article, we contend that the claim for\nthe existence of those parallel universes, as presented in Max Tegmark's book\n\"Our Mathematical Universe\", rests crucially on some questionable probability\narguments involving infinity. As a result, a doubt is cast over the multiverse\nhypothesis: Is it more credible than the counterarguments based on\nphilosophical and metaphysical considerations?\n", "  Wavefront estimation using in-focus image data is critical to many\napplications. This data is invariant to a sign flip with complex conjugation of\nthe complex amplitude in the pupil, making for a non-unique solution.\nInformation from an in-focus image taken through a non-redundant pupil mask\n(NRM) can break this ambiguity, enabling the true aberration to be determined.\nWe demonstrate this by priming a full pupil Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval\nwith NRM fringe phase information. We apply our method to measure simulated\naberrations on the segmented James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mirror using\nfull pupil and NRM data from its Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph\n(NIRISS).\n", "  The saddle points of a conventional Feynman path integral are not entangled,\nsince they comprise a sequence of classical field configurations. We combine\ninsights from field theory and tensor networks by constructing a Feynman path\nintegral over a sequence of matrix product states. The paths that dominate this\npath integral include some degree of entanglement. This new feature allows\nseveral insights and applications: i. A Ginzburg-Landau description of\ndeconfined phase transitions. ii. The emergence of new classical collective\nvariables in states that are not adiabatically continuous with product states.\niii. Features that are captured in product-state field theories by\nproliferation of instantons are encoded in perturbative fluctuations about\nentangled saddles. We develop a general formalism for such path integrals and a\ncouple of simple examples to illustrate their utility.\n", "  1RXS J180408.9-342058 is a transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary that\nexhibited a bright accretion outburst in 2015. We present Nustar, Swift, and\nChandra observations obtained around the peak of this outburst. The source was\nin a soft X-ray spectral state and displayed an X-ray luminosity of Lx~(2-3)E37\n(D/5.8 kpc)^2 erg cm-2 (0.5-10 keV). The Nustar data reveal a broad Fe-K\nemission line that we model as relativistically broadened reflection to\nconstrain the accretion geometry. We found that the accretion disk is viewed at\nan inclination of i~27-35 degrees and extended close to the neutron star, down\nto Rin~5-7.5 gravitational radii (~11-17 km). This inner disk radius suggests\nthat the neutron star magnetic field strength is B<2E8 G. We find a narrow\nabsorption line in the Chandra/HEG data at an energy of ~7.64 keV with a\nsignificance of ~4.8 sigma. This feature could correspond to blue-shifted Fe\nxxvi and arise from an accretion disk wind, which would imply an outflow\nvelocity of v~0.086c (~25800 km s-1). However, this would be extreme for an\nX-ray binary and it is unclear if a disk wind should be visible at the low\ninclination angle that we infer from our reflection analysis. Finally, we\ndiscuss how the X-ray and optical properties of 1RXS J180408.9-342058 are\nconsistent with a relatively small (Porb<3 hr) binary orbit.\n", "  We ask the question whether entropy accumulates, in the sense that the\noperationally relevant total uncertainty about an $n$-partite system $A = (A_1,\n\\ldots A_n)$ corresponds to the sum of the entropies of its parts $A_i$. The\nAsymptotic Equipartition Property implies that this is indeed the case to first\norder in $n$, under the assumption that the parts $A_i$ are identical and\nindependent of each other. Here we show that entropy accumulation occurs more\ngenerally, i.e., without an independence assumption, provided one quantifies\nthe uncertainty about the individual systems $A_i$ by the von Neumann entropy\nof suitably chosen conditional states. The analysis of a large system can hence\nbe reduced to the study of its parts. This is relevant for applications. In\ndevice-independent cryptography, for instance, the approach yields essentially\noptimal security bounds valid for general attacks, as shown by Arnon-Friedman\net al.\n", "  Out-of-time-order correlation functions provide a proxy for diagnosing chaos\nin quantum systems. We propose and analyze an interferometric scheme for their\nmeasurement, using only local quantum control and no reverse time evolution.\nOur approach utilizes a combination of Ramsey interferometry and the recently\ndemonstrated ability to directly measure Renyi entropies. To implement our\nscheme, we present a pair of cold-atom-based experimental blueprints; moreover,\nwe demonstrate that within these systems, one can naturally realize the\ntransverse-field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (TFSK) model, which exhibits certain\nsimilarities with fast scrambling black holes. We perform a detailed numerical\nstudy of scrambling in the TFSK model, observing an interesting interplay\nbetween the fast scrambling bound and the onset of spin-glass order.\n", "  We introduce a `double-difference' method for the inversion for seismic\nwavespeed structure based on adjoint tomography. Differences between seismic\nobservations and model predictions at individual stations may arise from\nfactors other than structural heterogeneity, such as errors in the assumed\nsource-time function, inaccurate timings, and systematic uncertainties. To\nalleviate the corresponding nonuniqueness in the inverse problem, we construct\ndifferential measurements between stations, thereby reducing the influence of\nthe source signature and systematic errors. We minimize the discrepancy between\nobservations and simulations in terms of the differential measurements made on\nstation pairs. We show how to implement the double-difference concept in\nadjoint tomography, both theoretically and in practice. We compare the\nsensitivities of absolute and differential measurements. The former provide\nabsolute information on structure along the ray paths between stations and\nsources, whereas the latter explain relative (and thus higher-resolution)\nstructural variations in areas close to the stations. Whereas in conventional\ntomography a measurement made on a single earthquake-station pair provides very\nlimited structural information, in double-difference tomography one earthquake\ncan actually resolve significant details of the structure. The\ndouble-difference methodology can be incorporated into the usual adjoint\ntomography workflow by simply pairing up all conventional measurements; the\ncomputational cost of the necessary adjoint simulations is largely unaffected.\nRather than adding to the computational burden, the inversion of\ndouble-difference measurements merely modifies the construction of the adjoint\nsources for data assimilation.\n", "  Rogue waves in birefringent optical fibers are analyzed within the framework\nof the coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (CNLS) system. The generation of rogue\nwaves is frequently associated with modulation instability (MI). It is commonly\nexpected that since the CNLS equations exhibit larger growth rates they should\nalso produce more rogue events than their scalar counterparts. This is found to\noccur only when both equations are focusing. When at least one component is\ndefocusing, the CNLS equations may still exhibit larger growth rates, compared\nto the scalar system, but that does not necessarily result in more or larger\nevents. The birefringence angle for which the maximum number of events occurs\nis also identified and the nature of the rogue wave is described for the\ndifferent cases.\n", "  The ability to manipulate single photons is of critical importance for\nfundamental quantum optics studies and practical implementations of quantum\ncommunications. While extraordinary progresses have been made in controlling\nspatial, temporal, spin and orbit angular momentum degrees of freedom,\nfrequency-domain control of single photons so far relies on nonlinear optical\neffects, which have faced obstacles such as noise photons, narrow bandwidth and\ndemanding optical filtering. Here we demonstrate the first integrated\nnear-unity efficiency frequency manipulation of single photons, by stretching\nand compressing a waveguide at 8.3 billion cycles per second. Frequency shift\nup to 150 GHz at telecom wavelength is realized without measurable added noise\nand the preservation of quantum coherence is verified through quantum\ninterference between twin photons of different colors. This single photon\nfrequency control approach will be invaluable for increasing the channel\ncapacity of quantum communications and compensating frequency mismatch between\nquantum systems, paving the road toward hybrid quantum network.\n", "  This report summarises the properties of Standard Model processes at the 100\nTeV pp collider. We document the production rates and typical distributions for\na number of benchmark Standard Model processes, and discuss new dynamical\nphenomena arising at the highest energies available at this collider. We\ndiscuss the intrinsic physics interest in the measurement of these Standard\nModel processes, as well as their role as backgrounds for New Physics searches.\n", "  We calculate the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time and the Knight shift\nfor the case of gapped graphene systems. Our calculations consider both the\nmassive and massless gap scenarios. Both the spin-lattice relaxation time and\nthe Knight shift depend on temperature, chemical potential, and the value of\nthe electronic energy gap. In particular, at the Dirac point, the electronic\nenergy gap has stronger effects on the system nuclear magnetic resonance\nparameters in the case of the massless gap scenario. Differently, at large\nvalues of the chemical potential, both gap scenarios behave in a similar way\nand the gapped graphene system approaches a Fermi gas from the nuclear magnetic\nresonance parameters point of view. Our results are important for nuclear\nmagnetic resonance measurements that target the $^{13}$C active nuclei in\ngraphene samples.\n", "  Wavefront phase retrieval from a set of intensity measurements can be\nformulated as an optimization problem. Two nonconvex objective models (MLP and\nits variants LS) based on maximum likelihood estimation are investigated. We\ndevelop numerical optimization algorithms for real-valued function of complex\nvariables and apply them to solve the wavefront phase retrieval problem\nefficiently. Numerical simulation is given with application to three wavefront\nphase retrieval problems. LS model shows better numerical performances than MLP\nmodel. An explanation for this is that the distribution of the eigenvalues of\nHessian matrix of LS model is more clustered than MLP model. LBFGS shows more\nrobust performance and takes fewer calculations than other line search methods.\n", "  This is a version (less professional editing, more details and jokes) of an\nAPS Physics Viewpoint about three recent papers extending charge-vortex duality\nto fermionic vortices.\n", "  The distribution of particle accelerations in turbulence is intermittent,\nwith non-Gaussian tails that are quite different for light and heavy particles.\nIn this article we analyse a closure scheme for the acceleration fluctuations\nof light and heavy inertial particles in turbulence, formulated in terms of\nLagrangian correlation functions of fluid tracers. We compute the variance and\nthe flatness of inertial particle accelerations and we discuss their dependency\non the Stokes number. The closure incorporates effects induced by the\nLagrangian correlations along the trajectories of fluid tracers, and its\npredictions agree well with results of direct numerical simulations of inertial\nparticles in turbulence, provided that the effects induced by the inertial\npreferential sampling of heavy/light particles outside/inside vortices are\nnegligible. In particular, the scheme predicts the correct functional behaviour\nof the acceleration variance, as a function of Stokes, as well as the presence\nof a minimum/maximum for the flatness of the acceleration of heavy/light\nparticles, in good qualitative agreement with numerical data. We also show that\nthe closure works well when applied to the Lagrangian evolution of particles\nusing a stochastic surrogate for the underlying Eulerian velocity field. Our\nresults support the conclusion that there exist important contributions to the\nstatistics of the acceleration of inertial particles independent of the\npreferential sampling. For heavy particles we observe deviations between the\npredictions of the closure scheme and direct numerical simulations, at Stokes\nnumbers of order unity. For light particles the deviation occurs for larger\nStokes numbers.\n", "  We present a near-infrared (NIR) imaging study of barred low surface\nbrightness (LSB) galaxies using the TIFR near-infrared Spectrometer and Imager\n(TIRSPEC). LSB galaxies are dark matter dominated, late type spirals that have\nlow luminosity stellar disks but large neutral hydrogen (HI) gas disks. Using\nSDSS images of a very large sample of LSB galaxies derived from the literature,\nwe found that the barred fraction is only 8.3%. We imaged twenty five barred\nLSB galaxies in the J, H, K$_S$ wavebands and twenty nine in the K$_S$ band.\nMost of the bars are much brighter than their stellar disks, which appear to be\nvery diffuse. Our image analysis gives deprojected mean bar sizes of\n$R_{b}/R_{25}$ = 0.40 and ellipticities $e$ $\\approx$ 0.45, which are similar\nto bars in high surface brightness galaxies. Thus, although bars are rare in\nLSB galaxies, they appear to be just as strong as bars found in normal\ngalaxies. There is no correlation of $R_{b}/R_{25}$ or $e$ with the relative HI\nor stellar masses of the galaxies. In the (J-K$_S$) color images most of the\nbars have no significant color gradient which indicates that their stellar\npopulation is uniformly distributed and confirms that they have low dust\ncontent.\n", "  We present the first results of our search for transiting exoplanet\ncandidates as part of the Kourovka Planet Search (KPS) project. The primary\nobjective of the project is to search for new hot Jupiters which transit their\nhost stars, mainly in the Galactic plane, in the $R_c$ magnitude range of 11 to\n14 mag. Our observations were performed with the telescope of the MASTER\nrobotic network, installed at the Kourovka astronomical observatory of the Ural\nFederal University (Russia), and the Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph,\ninstalled at the private Acton Sky Portal Observatory (USA). As test\nobservations, we observed three celestial fields of size $2\\times2$ deg$^2$\nduring the period from 2012 to 2015. As a result, we discovered four transiting\nexoplanet candidates among the 39000 stars of the input catalogue. In this\npaper, we provide the description of the project and analyse additional\nphotometric, spectral, and speckle interferometric observations of the\ndiscovered transiting exoplanet candidates. Three of the four transiting\nexoplanet candidates are most likely astrophysical false positives, while the\nnature of the fourth (most promising) candidate remains to be ascertained.\nAlso, we propose an alternative observing strategy that could increase the\nproject's exoplanet haul.\n", "  We study the phase transition in Cu-substituted iron-based superconductors\nwith a new developed real-space Green's function method. We find that Cu\nsubstitution has strong effect on the orbital-selective Mott transition\nintroduced by the Hund's rule coupling. The redistribution of the orbital\noccupancy which is caused by the increase of the Hund's rule coupling, gives\nrise to the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition in the half-filled $d_{xy}$\norbital. We also find that more and more electronic states appear inside that\nMott gap of the $d_{xy}$ orbital with the increase of Cu substitution, and the\nin-gap states around the Fermi level are strongly localized at some specific\nlattice sites. Further, a distinctive phase diagram, obtained for the\nCu-substituted Fe-based superconductors, displays an orbital-selective\ninsulating phase, as a result of the cooperative effect of the Hund's rule\ncoupling and the impurity-induced disorder.\n", "  This paper presents an application of white noise functional approach to\nderive the quantum propagator and the evolution of the reduced density matrix\nfor an open quantum system consisting of coupled harmonic oscillators which are\ncoupled to a bath consisting of a multimode harmonic oscillator. It is shown\nthat the full quantum propagator is a product of three individual propagators.\nThese propagators were obtained after two successive transformations of the\ncoordinates for the system, and the coordinates for the coupling between the\nbath and one of the two harmonic oscillators in the system. The obtained\npropagator is then used to derive the time evolution equation for the density\nmatrix describing the system. The method used to derive the propagator of the\nopen quantum system considered in this paper shows promise for analyzing open\nquantum systems, due to its ease of use and mathematical rigor.\n", "  Precise measurements of the properties of the top quark test the Standard\nModel (SM) and can be used to constrain new physics models. The top quark pair\ncharge asymmetry is an asymmetry predicted to occur beyond leading-order QCD in\nthe SM, and may be significantly enhanced by the presence of new physics. The\n$t\\bar{t}$ production charge asymmetry is measured inclusively and\ndifferentially using the 8 TeV ATLAS dataset in the lepton+jets final state,\nincluding a dedicated measurement for highly boosted top quarks. The results\nare in agreement with the SM and compared to new physics models. The top quark\nis predicted in the SM to decay almost exclusively to a \\textit{W} boson and\n\\textit{b} quark. Searches for non-SM top quark decays using the 8 TeV ATLAS\ndataset, including $t \\rightarrow qH$ and $t \\rightarrow qZ$ are presented. In\naddition, the measurement of the spin correlations in top quark pair production\nusing the polar angles distribution is discussed.\n", "  We propose and analyse analogs of optical cavities for atoms using two-well\nBose-Hubbard models with pumping and losses. With one well pumped, we find that\nboth the mean-field dynamics and the quantum statistics show a quantitative\ndependence on the choice of damped well. Both the systems we analyse remain far\nfrom equilibrium, preserving good coherence between the wells in the\nsteady-state. We find a small degree of quadrature squeezing and mode\nentanglement for some parameter regimes. Due to recent experimental advances,\nit should be possible to demonstrate the effects we investigate and predict.\n", "  We study various corrections of correlation functions to leading order in\nconformal perturbation theory, both on the cylinder and on the plane. Many\nproblems on the cylinder are mathematically equivalent to those in the plane if\nwe give the perturbations a position dependent scaling profile. The integrals\nto be done are then similar to the study of correlation functions with one\nadditional insertion at the center of the profile. We will be primarily\ninterested in the divergence structure of these corrections when computed in\ndimensional regularization. In particular, we show that the logarithmic\ndivergences (enhancements) that show up in the plane under these circumstances\ncan be understood in terms of resonant behavior in time dependent perturbation\ntheory, for a transition between states that is induced by an oscillatory\nperturbation on the cylinder.\n", "  This review describes the analytical calculation of lateral pressure profile\nin lipid membrane with finite curvature. The derivation is based on the\npreviously developed microscopic model of flexible strings [1,2]. According to\nthis theory the energy per unit chain is considered as energy of flexible\nstring (Euler's elastic beam of finite thickness) and interaction between\nchains is considered as an entropic repulsion. This microscopic theory allows\nto obtain expression for lateral pressure distribution in bent lipid membrane\nif treating a bending as a small deviation from the flat membrane conformation\nand using perturbation theory with small parameter L0J, where L0 is the\nmonolayer thickness, J is mean curvature of membrane. Because lateral pressure\ndistribution is related to the elastic properties of lipid bilayer [3] then\nfirst spontaneous moment of lateral pressure and the expression for bending\nmodulus may be derived from this theoretical model. Finally, based on\nanalytical expression for the lateral pressure distribution in bent lipid\nmembrane one can obtain analytically the energy difference between two states\nof mechanosensitive channel, particularly MscL [4, 5, 6]. Calculated expression\ndepends on inter-facial surface tension, the channel area change in region\nbetween hydrophobic interior and the aqueous surroundings and the bending\nmodulus and spontaneous bending moment values.\n", "  We investigate spin squeezing (SS) and the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nfor the Jaynes-Cummings Dicke (JC-Dicke) model in a two component atomic\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity. Analytical expressions\nfor spin squeezing and the reciprocal of the quantum Fisher information per\nparticle (RMQFI) are derived using the frozen spin approximation. It is shown\nthat in the superradiant phase near the critical point, maximum squeezing and\nmaximum quantum entanglement occurs. The present study is relevant to quantum\ninformation processing and precision spectroscopy.\n", "  More than 36,000 students and post-docs will be involved in experiments at\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) until 2025. Do they expect that their learning\nexperience will have an impact on their professional future? By drawing from\nearlier salary expectations literature, this paper proposes a framework aiming\nat explaining the professional expectations of early career researchers (ECR)\nat the LHC. Results from different ordered logistic models suggest that\nexperiential learning at LHC positively correlates with both current and former\nstudents' salary expectations. At least two not mutually exclusive explanations\nunderlie such a relationship. First, the training at LHC gives early career\nresearchers valuable expertise, which in turn affects salary expectations;\nsecondly, respondents recognise that the LHC research experience per se may act\nas a signal in the labour market. Respondents put a price tag on their\nexperience at LHC, a \"salary premium\" ranging from 5% to 12% in terms of future\nsalaries compared with what they would have expected without such experience.\n", "  The electrical resistivity and the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) was\ninvestigated for Ni Co alloys at and below room temperature. The Ni Co alloy\nlayers having a thickness of about 2 um were prepared by electrodeposition on\nSi wafers with evaporated Cr and Cu underlayers. The alloy composition was\nvaried in the whole concentration range by varying the ratio of Ni sulfate and\nCo sulfate in the electrolyte. The Ni Co alloy deposits were investigated first\nin the as deposited state on the substrates and then, by mechanically stripping\nthem from the substrates, as self supporting layers both without and after\nannealing. According to an X ray diffraction study, a strongly textured face\ncentered cubic (fcc) structure was formed in the as deposited state with an\naverage grain size of about 10 nm. Upon annealing, the crystal structure was\nretained whereas the grain size increased by a factor of 3 to 5, depending on\nalloy composition. The zero field resistivity decreased strongly by annealing\ndue to the increased grain size. The annealing hardly changed the AMR below 50\nat.% Co but strongly decreased it above this concentration. The composition\ndependence of the resistivity and the AMR of the annealed Ni Co alloy deposits\nwas in good quantitative agreement with the available literature data both at\n13 K and at room temperature. Both transport parameters were found to exhibit a\npronounced maximum in the composition range between 20 and 30 at.% Co and the\ndata of the Ni Co alloys fit well to the limiting values of the pure component\nmetals (fcc Ni and fcc Co). The only theoretical calculation reported formerly\non fcc Ni Co alloys yielded at T=0K a resistivity value smaller by a factor of\n5 and an AMR value larger by a factor of about 2 than the corresponding low\ntemperature experimental data, although the theoretical results properly\nreproduced the composition dependence of both quantities.\n", "  We study here, using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution of Weyl conformal theory,\nthe mass decomposition in the representative subsample of $57$ early-type\nelliptical lens galaxies of the SLACS on board the HST. We begin by showing\nthat the solution need not be an exclusive solution of conformal gravity but\ncan also be viewed as a solution of a class of $f(R)$ gravity theories coupled\nto non-linear electrodynamics thereby rendering the ensuing results more\nuniversal. Since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that the\nsolution adds to Schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass\n($M_{\\ast }$) a positive contribution $+\\gamma R$ contrary to the previous\nresults in the literature, thereby resolving a long standing problem. The cause\nof the error is critically examined. Applying the expressions for light bending\ntogether with an input equating Einstein and Weyl angles, we develop a novel\nalgorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass\n(luminous+dark) within the Einstein radius. Our results indicate that the\nluminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linear\nproportionality factor. In quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios of\nluminous over total lens mass ($f^{\\ast }$) within the Einstein radius of\nindividual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fall\ninside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from a\nsimulation based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis model\ntogether with the Salpeter IMF favored on the ground of metallicity\n[Grillo,2009]. We shall also calculate the average dark matter density of\nindividual galaxies within their respective Einstein spheres. The present\napproach, being truly analytic, seems to be the first of its kind attempting to\nprovide a new decomposition scheme distinct from the simulational ones.\n", "  We analyse the heating of stellar discs by non axisymmetric structures and\ngiant molecular clouds (GMCs) in N-body simulations of growing disc galaxies.\nThe analysis resolves long-standing discrepancies between models and data by\ndemonstrating the importance of distinguishing between measured age-velocity\ndispersion relations (AVRs) and the heating histories of the stars that make up\nthe AVR. We fit both AVRs and heating histories with formulae proportional to\nt^beta and determine the exponents beta_R and beta_z derived from in-plane and\nvertical AVRs and ~beta_R and ~beta_z from heating histories. Values of beta_z\nare in almost all simulations larger than values of ~beta_z, whereas values of\nbeta_R are similar to or mildly larger than values of ~beta_R. Moreover, values\nof beta_z (~beta_z) are generally larger than values of beta_R (~beta_R). The\ndominant cause of these relations is the decline over the life of the disc in\nimportance of GMCs as heating agents relative to spiral structure and the bar.\nWe examine how age errors and biases in solar neighbourhood surveys influence\nthe measured AVR: they tend to decrease beta values by smearing out ages and\nthus measured dispersions. We compare AVRs and velocity ellipsoid shapes\nsigma_z/sigma_R from simulations to Solar neighbourhood data. We conclude that\nfor the expected disc mass and dark halo structure, combined GMC and spiral/bar\nheating can explain the AVR of the Galactic thin disc. Strong departures of the\ndisc mass or the dark halo structure from expectation spoil fits to the data.\n", "  Apart from usual quantization steps on the ballistic conductance of a\nquasi-one-dimensional conductor, an additional plateau-like feature appears at\na fraction of about 0.7 below the first conductance step in GaAs-based quantum\npoint contacts (QPCs). Despite a tremendous amount of research on this\nanomalous feature, its origin remains still unclear. Here, a unique model of\nthis anomaly is proposed relied on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\nIt is noticed that just after opening a quasi-1D conducting channel in the QPC\na single electron travels the channel at a time, and such electron can be - in\nprinciple - observed. The act of observation destroys superposition of spin\nstates, in which the electron otherwise exists, and this suppresses their\nquantum interference. It is shown that the QPC-conductance is then reduded by a\nfactor of 0.74. \"Visibility\" of electron is enhanced if the electron spends\nsome time in the channel due to resonant transmission. Electron's resonance can\nalso explain an unusual temperature behaviour of the anomaly, as well as its\nrecently discovered feature: oscillatory modulation as a function of the\nchannel length and electrostatic potential. A recipe for experimental\nverification of the model is given.\n", "  Higher order calculations are necessary to predict and describe measurements\nin high energy collider physics. In recent years multiple approaches to combine\nmultiple next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections with parton showers had been\npresented. We present on recent developments and future perspective. We\nhighlight similarities and ambiguities in the procedure of achieving a multijet\nmerging at NLO.\n", "  The state of polarization (SOP) is an inherent property of the vectorial\nnature of light and a crucial parameter in a wide range of remote sensing\napplications. Nevertheless, the SOP is rather cumbersome to probe\nexperimentally, as conventional detectors only respond to the intensity of the\nlight, hence loosing the phase information between orthogonal vector\ncomponents. In this work, we propose a new type of polarimeter that is compact\nand well-suited for in-plane optical circuitry, while allowing for immediate\ndetermination of the SOP through simultaneous retrieval of the associated\nStokes parameters. The polarimeter is based on plasmonic phase-gradient\nbirefringent metasurfaces that facilitate normal incident light to launch\nin-plane photonic waveguide modes propagating in six predefined directions with\nthe coupling efficiencies providing a direct measure of the incident SOP. The\nfunctionality and accuracy of the polarimeter, which essentially is an\nall-polarization sensitive waveguide metacoupler, is confirmed through\nfull-wave simulations at the operation wavelength of 1.55$\\mu$m.\n", "  The two-photon production of photon pairs, i.e. the\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ process, is studied. Different production modes\nregarding the elastic or inelastic coupling of the intermediate-state photons\nto the protons are considered. The semi-exclusive measurement, where one intact\nproton is registered by a dedicated forward proton detector, is discussed. As\nan example, the signal and background simulations are performed for the\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ process mediated by the hypothetical 750 GeV\nresonance.\n", "  The introduction of the surface plasmon polarizations makes the emittance of\nthe photocathode complicated. In this paper, the emittance of plasmon-enhanced\nphotocathode is analyzed. It is first demonstrated that the plasmonic near\nfield can increase the emittance of the plasmon-enhanced photocathode. A\nsimulation method has been used to estimate the emittance caused by plasmonic\nnear field, and the suppression method also has been discussed, both of which\nare significant for the design of high performance plasmon-enhanced\nphotocathode.\n", "  In this work we explore dynamical perturbations induced by the massive\nasteroids Ceres and Vesta on main-belt asteroids through secular resonances.\nFirst we determine the location of the linear secular resonances with Ceres and\nVesta in the main belt, using a purely numerical technique. Then we use a set\nof numerical simulations of fictitious asteroids to investigate the importance\nof these secular resonances in the orbital evolution of main-belt asteroids. We\nfound, evaluating the magnitude of the perturbations in the proper elements of\nthe test particles, that in some cases the strength of these secular resonances\nis comparable to that of known non-linear secular resonances with the giant\nplanets. Finally we explore the asteroid families that are crossed by the\nsecular resonances we studied, and identified several cases where the latter\nseem to play an important role in their post-impact evolution.\n", "  This paper deals with the construction of the multiparticle correlation\nexpansion of relative entropy for lattice systems. Thanks to this analysis we\nare able to express the statistical distance between two systems as a series\nbuilt over clusters of increasing dimension. Each addend is written in terms of\ncorrelation functions and expresses the contribution to the relative entropy\ndue to structural information inside the selected cluster. We present a general\nprocedure for the explicit construction of all the terms of the series. As a\nfirst application of this result, we show that the coefficients of the\nmultiparticle correlation expansion of the excess entropy can be computed from\nour formula, as a particular case.\n", "  In the Hadron machine option, proposed in the context of the Future Circular\nColliders (FCC) study, the dipole field quality is expected to play an\nimportant role, as in the LHC. A preliminary evaluation of the field quality of\ndipoles, based on the Nb$_{3}$Sn technology, has been provided by the magnet\ngroup. The effect of these field imperfections on the dynamic aperture, using\nthe present lattice design, is presented and first tolerances on the b$_3$ and\nb$_5$ multipole components are evaluated.\n", "  The logarithmic KdV (log-KdV) equation admits global solutions in an energy\nspace and exhibits Gaussian solitary waves. Orbital stability of Gaussian\nsolitary waves is known to be an open problem. We address properties of\nsolutions to the linearized log-KdV equation at the Gaussian solitary waves. By\nusing the decomposition of solutions in the energy space in terms of Hermite\nfunctions, we show that the time evolution is related to a Jacobi difference\noperator with a limit circle at infinity. This exact reduction allows us to\ncharacterize both spectral and linear orbital stability of solitary waves. We\nalso introduce a convolution representation of solutions to the log-KdV\nequation with the Gaussian weight and show that the time evolution in such a\nweighted space is dissipative with the exponential rate of decay.\n", "  We have investigated numerically the coupling between a 10 \\si{MeV} electron\nbunch of high charge (\\SI{> 100}{pc}) with a laser generated accelerating\nplasma wave. Our results show that a high efficiency coupling can be achieved\nusing a \\SI{50}{TW}, \\SI{100}{\\micro \\meter} wide laser beam, yielding\naccelerating field above \\SI{1}{ GV/m}. We propose an experiment where these\npredictions could be tested.\n", "  The renormalization method is applied to investigate the electron\ntransmission properties of a circuit containing a benzene molecule, in which\none of the carbon atoms has been modified so as to simulate displacement in\nposition or replacement by another atom. Consideration of the different\npossible attachments of the leads, and the relative location of the modified\natom, results in 9 distinct configurations to examine. For each configuration,\nthe number and locations of anti-resonances, and whether they shift upon\nvariation of the parameters, is seen to be the key to determining the shape of\nthe electron-transmission curve. In particular, those configurations, in which\nthe perturbed atom is not directly attached to a lead, are seen to have the\nmost variation in their structure, compared to pure benzene.\n", "  Recent experimental observations indicate that bulk $Sc_2O_3$ (~200 nm\nthick), an insulator at room temperature and pressure, must act as a good\nelectronic conductor during thermionic cathode operation, leading to the\nobserved high emitted current densities and overall superior emission\nproperties over conventional thermionic emitters which do not contain\n$Sc_2O_3$. Here, we employ ab initio methods using both semilocal and hybrid\nfunctionals to calculate the intrinsic defect energetics of Sc and O vacancies\nand interstitials and their effects on the electronic properties of $Sc_2O_3$\nin an effort to explain the good conduction of $Sc_2O_3$ observed in\nexperiment. The defect energetics were used in an equilibrium defect model to\ncalculate the concentrations of defects and their compensating electron and\nhole concentrations at equilibrium. Overall, our results indicate that the\nconductivity of $Sc_2O_3$ solely due to the presence of intrinsic defects in\nthe cathode operating environment is unlikely to be high enough to maintain the\nmagnitude of emitted current densities obtained from experiment, and that\npresence of impurities are necessary to raise the conductivity of $Sc_2O_3$ to\na high enough value to explain the current densities observed in experiment.\nThe necessary minimum impurity concentration to impart sufficient electronic\nconduction is very small (approximately $7.5x10^{-3}$ ppm) and is probably\npresent in all experiments.\n", "  The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is a major upgrade of the\nKEK \"$B$ factory\" facility in Tsukuba, Japan. The machine is designed for an\ninstantaneous luminosity of $8\\times 10^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$\\,s$^{-1}$, and the\nexperiment is expected to accumulate a data sample of about 50 ab$^{-1}$ well\nwithin the next decade. With this amount of data, decays sensitive to physics\nbeyond the Standard Model can be studied with unprecedented precision. One\npromising set of modes are physics processes with missing energy such as\n$B^+\\to\\tau^+\\nu_{\\tau}$, $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$, and $B\\to\nK^{(*)}\\nu\\bar\\nu$ decays. The Belle II data also allows searches for\ncandidates for the dark photon, the gauge mediator of a hypothetical dark\nsector, which has received much attention in the context of dark matter models.\n", "  In this study we employ Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods to\ninvestigate the surface energy barrier for electron emission (surface barrier)\nand thermodynamic stability of Ba and Ba-O species adsorption under conditions\nof high temperature (approximately 1200 K) and low pressure (approximately\n$10^{-10}$ Torr) on the low index surfaces of bixbyite $Sc_2O_3$. The role of\nBa in lowering the cathode surface barrier is investigated via adsorption of\natomic Ba and Ba-O dimers, where the highest simulated dimer coverage\ncorresponds to a single monolayer film of rocksalt BaO. The change of the\nsurface barrier of a semiconductor due to adsorption of surface species is\ndecomposed into two parts: a surface dipole component and doping component. The\nlowest surface barrier with atomic Ba on $Sc_2O_3$ was found to be 2.12 eV and\n2.04 eV for the (011) and (111) surfaces at 3 and 1 Ba atoms per surface unit\ncell (0.250 and 0.083 Ba per surface O), respectively. The lowest surface\nbarrier for Ba-O on $Sc_2O_3$ was found to be 1.21 eV on (011) for a 7 Ba-O\ndimer-per-unit-cell coverage (0.583 dimers per surface O). Generally, we found\nthat Ba in its atomic form on $Sc_2O_3$ surfaces is not stable relative to bulk\nBaO, while Ba-O dimer coverages between 3 to 7 Ba-O dimers per (011) surface\nunit cell (0.250 to 0.583 dimers per surface O) produce stable structures\nrelative to bulk BaO. Ba-O dimer adsorption on $Sc_2O_3$ (111) surfaces was\nfound to be unstable versus BaO over the full range of coverages studied.\nInvestigation of combined n-type doping and surface dipole modification showed\nthat their effects interact to yield a reduction less than the two\ncontributions would yield separately.\n", "  We analyze the activity of the Northern \\omega-Scorpiid meteor shower between\n2010 and 2012. For this purpose we have employed an array of low-lux CCD video\ncameras and spectrographs deployed at different astronomical observatories in\nSpain. As a result of our survey, the atmospheric trajectory and radiant\nposition of 11 of these meteor events were obtained. The tensile strength and\norbital parameters of the progenitor meteoroids have been also calculated. The\ncalculated orbital data and the behaviour of these meteoroids in the atmosphere\nare compatible with an asteroidal origin of this stream. In addition, we\ndiscuss a unique emission spectrum recorded for one of these meteors. This is,\nto our knowledge, the first North {\\omega}-Scorpiid spectrum discussed in the\nscientific literature, and it has provided information about the chemical\nnature of the meteoroid and the progenitor body.\n", "  Coronal jets represent important manifestations of ubiquitous solar\ntransients, which may be the source of significant mass and energy input to the\nupper solar atmosphere and the solar wind. While the energy involved in a\njet-like event is smaller than that of \"nominal\" solar flares and coronal mass\nejections (CMEs), jets share many common properties with these phenomena, in\nparticular, the explosive magnetically driven dynamics. Studies of jets could,\ntherefore, provide critical insight for understanding the larger, more complex\ndrivers of the solar activity. On the other side of the size-spectrum, the\nstudy of jets could also supply important clues on the physics of transients\nclose or at the limit of the current spatial resolution such as spicules.\nFurthermore, jet phenomena may hint to basic process for heating the corona and\naccelerating the solar wind; consequently their study gives us the opportunity\nto attack a broad range of solar-heliospheric problems.\n", "  Measurements of the surface diffusivity of colloidal spheres translating\nalong a vapor/liquid inter- face show an unexpected decrease in diffusivity, or\nincrease in surface drag (from the Stokes-Einstein relation) when the particles\nsituate further into the vapor phase. However, direct measurements of the\nsurface drag from the colloid velocity due to an external force find the\nexpected decrease with deeper immersion into the vapor. The paradoxical drag\nincrease observed in diffusion experiments has been attributed to the\nattachment of the fluid interface to heterogeneities on the colloid surface,\nwhich causes the interface, in response to thermal fluctuations, to either jump\nor remain pinned, creating added drag. We have performed molecular dynamics\nsimulations of the diffusivity and force experiments for a nanoparticle with a\nrough surface at a vapor/liquid interface to examine the effect of contact line\nfluctuations. The drag calculated from both experiments agree and decrease as\nthe particle positions further into the vapor. The surface drag is smaller than\nthe bulk liquid drag due to the partial submersion into the liquid, and the\nfinite thickness of the interfacial zone relative to the nanoparticle size.\nContact line fluctuations do not give rise to an anomalous increase in drag.\n", "  Perovskite oxides containing transition metals are promising materials in a\nwide range of electronic and electrochemical applications. However, neither\ntheir work function values nor an understanding of their work function physics\nhave been established. Here, we predict the work function trends of a series of\nperovskite ($ABO_3$ formula) materials using Density Functional Theory, and\nshow that the work functions of (001)-terminated AO- and $BO_2$-oriented\nsurfaces can be described using concepts of electronic band filling, bond\nhybridization, and surface dipoles. The calculated range of AO ($BO_2$) work\nfunctions are 1.60-3.57 eV (2.99-6.87 eV). We find an approximately linear\ncorrelation ($R^2$ between 0.77-0.86, depending on surface termination) between\nwork function and position of the oxygen 2p band center, which correlation\nenables both understanding and rapid prediction of work function trends.\nFurthermore, we identify $SrVO_3$ as a stable, low work function, highly\nconductive material. Undoped (Ba-doped) $SrVO_3$ has an intrinsically low\nAO-terminated work function of 1.86 eV (1.07 eV). These properties make\n$SrVO_3$ a promising candidate material for a new electron emission cathode for\napplication in high power microwave devices, and as a potential electron\nemissive material for thermionic energy conversion technologies.\n", "  Most studies on melting under confinement focus only on the solid and liquid\nmelt phases. Despite of its ubiquity, contributions from the capillary\ninterface (liquid / vapor interface) are often neglected. In this study the\nmelting behavior of small cylindrical aggregates in vapor attached to planar\nsurfaces is analyzed. For the assumed boundary conditions (cylindrical solid\nwith a non wetting top plane and a wettable side wall) solid and the liquid\nphases can coexist within a certain temperature range. Due to capillary\ninstability, the liquid phase can form either an axisymmetric rouloid\nmorphology or, above a certain threshold liquid volume fraction, a bulge\ncoexisting with a rouloid-like section. The corresponding melting points are\ndifferent. The analysis explicitly describes the behavior of a real system of\nsmall aggregates of long chain alkanes on planar substrates. It also gives\nqualitative insights into the melting behavior of small aggregates with\nanisotropic wetting behaviors in general. It reveals in particular how melting\npoints and melting pathways depend on the energetic respectively morphological\npathways leading to complete melting.\n", "  The surface coating of cathodes using insulator films has proven to be a\npromising method for high-voltage cathode stabilization in Li-ion batteries.\nHowever, there is still substantial uncertainty about how these films function,\nspecifically with regard to important coating design principles such as lithium\nsolubility and transport through the films. This study uses Density Functional\nTheory to examine the diffusivity of interstitial lithium in crystalline\n{\\alpha}-$AlF_3$, {\\alpha}-$Al_2O_3$, m-$ZrO_2$, c-MgO, and {\\alpha}-quartz\n$SiO_2$, which provide benchmark cases for further understanding of insulator\ncoatings in general. In addition, we propose an Ohmic electrolyte model to\npredict resistivities and overpotential contributions under battery operating\nconditions. For the crystalline materials considered we predict that Li+\ndiffuses quite slowly, with a migration barrier larger than 0.9 eV in all\ncrystalline materials except {\\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, which is predicted to\nhave a migration barrier of 0.276 eV along <001>. These results suggest that\nthe stable crystalline forms of these insulator materials, except for oriented\n{\\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, are not practical for conformal cathode coatings.\nAmorphous $Al_2O_3$ and $AlF_3$ have higher Li+ diffusivities than their\ncrystalline counterparts. Our predicted amorphous $Al_2O_3$ resistivity (1789\nM{\\Omega}m) is near the top of the range of fitted resistivities extracted from\nprevious experiments on nominal $Al_2O_3$ coatings (7.8 to 913 M{\\Omega}m)\nwhile our predicted amorphous $AlF_3$ resistivity (114 M{\\Omega}m) is close to\nthe middle of the range. These comparisons support our framework for modeling\nand understanding the impact on overpotential of conformal coatings in terms of\ntheir fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties, and support that these\nmaterials can provide practical conformal coatings in their amorphous form.\n", "  We have recently proposed an atom probe design based on a femtosecond\ntime-resolved pump-probe setup. This setup unlocks the limitation of voltage\npulsed mode atom probe thanks to the occurrence of local photoconductive\nswitching effect . In this paper, we have used a numerical model to simulate\nthe field evaporation process triggered by the synchronous two pulses. The\nmodel takes into account the local photoconductive effect and the temperature\nrise caused by the laser application and the voltage pulse distortion due to\nthe RC effect.\n", "  Metal fluoride and oxides can store multiple lithium-ions through conversion\nchemistry to enable high energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, their\npractical applications have been hindered by an unusually large voltage\nhysteresis between charge and discharge voltage-profiles and the consequent low\nenergy efficiency (< 80%). The physical origins of such hysteresis are rarely\nstudied and poorly understood. Here we employ in situ X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),\ndensity-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, and galvanostatic intermittent\ntitration technique (GITT) to first correlate the voltage profile of iron\nfluoride ($FeF_3$), a representative conversion electrode material, with\nevolution and spatial distribution of intermediate phases in the electrode. The\nresults reveal that, contrary to conventional belief, the phase evolution in\nthe electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge. However, the spatial\nevolution of the electrochemically active phases, which is controlled by\nreaction kinetics, is different. We further propose that the voltage hysteresis\nin the $FeF_3$ electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic\nvoltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of\nelectrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore,\nthe large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and\noptimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve\nthe energy efficiency of lithium-ion batteries based on conversion chemistry.\n", "  We consider the Penrose limit of the solution of D5-brane given in the\nAnti-de Sitter space and analyse the shape of the D5-brane in the pp-wave\nbackground. We find that the D5-brane leads to the branes and the throats\nconnecting the branes. The branes spread on R^4 with periodic values of the\nlight-cone time x^+ and the throats lie along x^+. We also give some comments\non holography.\n", "  In the present work we investigate a new type of billiards defined inside\nn-simplex regions. We determine an invariant ergodic (SRB) measure of the\ndynamics for any dimension. In using symbolic dynamics the (KS or metric)\nentropy is computed and we find that the system is chaotic for all cases n > 2.\n"]}
