We used optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. We\nreport the discovery of a very wide very low mass visual binary, LOri167,\nformed by a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass candidate located at 5 arcsec,\nwhich seems to belong to the cluster. We derive Teff of 2125 and 1750 K. If\nthey are members, comparisons with theoretical models indicate masses of 17\n(20-15) Mjup and 8 (13-7) Mjup, with a projected separation of 2000 AU. Such a\nbinary system would be difficult to explain in most models, particularly those\nwhere substellar objects form in the disks surrounding higher mass stars.\n", "  Does massless (lambda Phi^4)_4 theory exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking\n(SSB)? The raw 1-loop result implies that it does, but the \"RG-improved\" result\nimplies the opposite. I argue that the appropriate \"low-energy effective\ntheory\" is a nonlocal field theory involving an attractive, long-range\ninteraction Phi^2(x) Phi^2(y)/z^4, where z=|x-y|. RG improvement then requires\nrunning couplings for both this interaction and the original pointlike\ninteraction. A crude calculation in this framework yields SSB even after \"RG\nimprovement\" and closely agrees with the raw 1-loop result.\n", "  The paper investigates the use of low-diffusion\n(contact-discontinuity-resolving [Liou M.S.: {\\em J. Comp. Phys.} {\\bf 160}\n(2000) 623--648]) approximate Riemann solvers for the convective part of the\nReynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (\\tsn{RANS}) equations with Reynolds-stress\nmodel (\\tsn{RSM}) closure. Different equivalent forms of the \\tsn{RSM-RANS}\nsystem are discussed and classification of the complex terms introduced by\nadvanced turbulence closures is attempted. Computational examples are\npresented, which indicate that the use of contact-discontinuity-resolving\nconvective numerical fluxes, along with a passive-scalar approach for the\nReynolds-stresses, may lead to unphysical oscillations of the solution. To\ndetermine the source of these instabilities, theoretical analysis of the\nRiemann problem for a simplified Reynolds-stress transport model-system, which\nincorporates the divergence of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the convective\npart of the mean-flow equations, and includes only those nonconservative\nproducts which are computable (do not require modelling), was undertaken,\nhighlighting the differences in wave-structure compared to the passive-scalar\ncase. A hybrid solution, allowing the combination of any low-diffusion\napproximate Riemann solver with the complex tensorial representations used in\nadvanced models, is proposed, combining low-diffusion fluxes for the mean-flow\nequations with a more dissipative massflux for Reynolds-stress-transport.\nSeveral computational examples are presented to assess the performance of this\napproach.\n", "  We investigate the fluctuations of thermodynamic state-variables in\ncompressible aerodynamic wall-turbulence, using results of direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) of compressible turbulent plane channel flow. The basic\ntransport equations governing the behaviour of thermodynamic variables\n(density, pressure, temperature and entropy) are reviewed and used to derive\nthe exact transport equations for the variances and fluxes (transport by the\nfluctuating velocity field) of the thermodynamic fluctuations. The scaling with\nReynolds and Mach number of compressible turbulent plane channel flow is\ndiscussed. Correlation coefficients and higher-order statistics of the\nthermodynamic fluctuations are examined. Finally, detailed budgets of the\ntransport equations for the variances and fluxes of the thermodynamic variables\nfrom a well-resolved DNS are analysed. Implications of these results both to\nthe understanding of the thermodynamic interactions in compressible\nwall-turbulence and to possible improvements in statistical modelling are\nassessed. Finally, the required extension of existing DNS data to fully\ncharacterise this canonical flow is discussed.\n", "  The free interface separating an exterior, viscous fluid from an intrusive\nconduit of buoyant, less viscous fluid is known to support strongly nonlinear\nsolitary waves due to a balance between viscosity-induced dispersion and\nbuoyancy-induced nonlinearity. The overtaking, pairwise interaction of weakly\nnonlinear solitary waves has been classified theoretically for the Korteweg-de\nVries equation and experimentally in the context of shallow water waves, but a\ntheoretical and experimental classification of strongly nonlinear solitary wave\ninteractions is lacking. The interactions of large amplitude solitary waves in\nviscous fluid conduits, a model physical system for the study of\none-dimensional, truly dissipationless, dispersive nonlinear waves, are\nclassified. Using a combined numerical and experimental approach, three classes\nof nonlinear interaction behavior are identified: purely bimodal, purely\nunimodal, and a mixed type. The magnitude of the dispersive radiation due to\nsolitary wave interactions is quantified numerically and observed to be beyond\nthe sensitivity of our experiments, suggesting that conduit solitary waves\nbehave as \"physical solitons.\" Experimental data are shown to be in excellent\nagreement with numerical simulations of the reduced model. Experimental movies\nare available with the online version of the paper.\n", "  The electronic properties of graphene can be significantly influenced by\nmechanical strain. One practical approach to induce strain in graphene is to\ntransfer this atomically thin membrane onto pre-patterned substrates with\nspecific corrugation. The possibility to use nanoparticles to impart extrinsic\nrippling to graphene has not been fully explored yet. Here we study the\nstructure and elastic properties of graphene grown by chemical vapour\ndeposition and transferred onto a continuous layer of SiO2 nanoparticles with\ndiameters of around 25 nm, prepared on Si substrate by Langmuir-Blodgett\ntechnique. We show that the corrugation of the transferred graphene and thus\nthe membrane strain can be modified by annealing at moderate temperatures. The\nmembrane parts bridging the nanoparticles are suspended and can be reversibly\nlifted by the attractive forces between an atomic force microscope tip and\ngraphene. This allows the dynamic control of the local morphology of graphene\nnanomembranes.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological implications of a new class of modified\ngravity, where the field equations generically include higher-order derivatives\nof the matter fields, arising from the introduction of non-dynamical auxiliary\nfields in the action. Imposing a flat, homogeneous and isotropic geometry we\nextract the Friedmann equations, obtaining an effective dark-energy sector\ncontaining higher derivatives of the matter energy density and pressure. For\nthe cases of dust, radiation, and stiff matter we analyze the cosmological\nbehavior, finding accelerating, de Sitter, and non-accelerating phases,\ndominated by matter or dark energy. Additionally, the effective dark-energy\nequation-of-state parameter can be quintessence-like,\ncosmological-constant-like, or even phantom-like. The detailed study of these\nscenarios may provide signatures that could distinguish them from other\ncandidates of modified gravity.\n", "  In spite of their simple description in terms of rotations or symplectic\ntransformations in phase space, quadratic Hamiltonians such as those modeling\nthe most common Gaussian operations on bosonic modes remain poorly understood\nin terms of entropy production. For instance, determining the von Neumann\nentropy produced by a Bogoliubov transformation is notably a hard problem, with\ngenerally no known analytical solution. Here, we overcome this difficulty by\nusing the replica method, a tool borrowed from statistical physics and quantum\nfield theory. We exhibit a first application of this method to the field of\nquantum optics, where it enables accessing entropies in a two-mode squeezer or\noptical parametric amplifier. As an illustration, we determine the entropy\ngenerated by amplifying a binary superposition of the vacuum and an arbitrary\nFock state, which yields a surprisingly simple, yet unknown analytical\nexpression.\n", "  A self-consistent theory is developed based on the principle of relativity\nfor a plane wave in a moving non-dispersive, lossless, non-conducting,\nisotropic, uniform medium. A light-momentum criterion is set up for the first\ntime, which states that the momentum of light in a medium is parallel to the\nwave vector in all inertial frames of reference. By rigorous analysis, novel\nbasic properties of the plane wave are exposed: (a) Poynting vector does not\nnecessarily represent the electromagnetic (EM) power flow when a medium moves;\n(b) Minkowski light momentum and energy constitute a Lorentz four-vector in a\nform of single EM-field cell or single photon, and Planck constant is a Lorentz\ninvariant; (c) there is no momentum transfer taking place between the plane\nwave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum conservation equation cannot\nbe uniquely determined without resorting to the principle of relativity; and\n(d) when the medium moves opposite to the wave vector at a\nfaster-than-dielectric light speed, negative frequency and negative EM energy\ndensity occur, with the plane wave becoming left-handed. Finally, a new physics\nof so-called \"intrinsic Lorentz violation\" is presented as well.\n", "  We report measurement of the cross section of $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)$\nbetween 4.0 and $5.5 {\\rm GeV}$, based on an analysis of initial state\nradiation events in a $980 \\rm fb^{-1}$ data sample recorded with the Belle\ndetector. The properties of the $Y(4360)$ and $Y(4660)$ states are determined.\nFitting the mass spectrum of $\\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)$ with two coherent\nBreit-Wigner functions, we find two solutions with identical mass and width but\ndifferent couplings to electron-positron pairs: $M_{Y(4360)} = (4347\\pm 6\\pm 3)\n{\\rm MeV}/c^2$, $\\Gamma_{Y(4360)} = (103\\pm 9\\pm 5) {\\rm MeV}$, $M_{Y(4660)} =\n(4652\\pm10\\pm 8) {\\rm MeV}/c^2$, $\\Gamma_{Y(4660)} = (68\\pm 11\\pm 1) \\rm MeV$;\nand ${\\cal{B}}[Y(4360)\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)]\\cdot \\Gamma_{Y(4360)}^{e^+e^-} =\n(10.9\\pm 0.6\\pm 0.7) \\rm eV$ and ${\\cal{B}}[Y(4660)\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)]\\cdot\n\\Gamma_{Y(4660)}^{e^+e^-} = (8.1\\pm 1.1\\pm 0.5) \\rm eV$ for one solution; or\n${\\cal{B}}[Y(4360)\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)]\\cdot \\Gamma_{Y(4360)}^{e^+e^-} =\n(9.2\\pm 0.6\\pm 0.6) \\rm eV$ and ${\\cal{B}}[Y(4660)\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)]\\cdot\n\\Gamma_{Y(4660)}^{e^+e^-} = (2.0\\pm 0.3\\pm 0.2) \\rm eV$ for the other. Here,\nthe first errors are statistical and the second systematic. Evidence for a\ncharged charmoniumlike structure at $4.05 {\\rm GeV}/c^2$ is observed in the\n$\\pi^{\\pm}\\psi(2S)$ intermediate state in the $Y(4360)$ decays.\n", "  In this work, we employ algebraic renormalization technique to show the\nrenormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory of the Lorentz and CPT\nviolating QED. Essentially, we control the breaking terms by using a suitable\nset of external sources. Thus, with the symmetries restored, a perturbative\ntreatment can be consistently employed. After showing the renormalizability,\nthe external sources attain certain physical values, which allow the recovering\nof the starting physical action. The main result is that the original QED\naction presents the three usual independent renormalization parameters. The\nLorentz violating sector can be renormalized by nineteen independent\nparameters. Moreover, vacuum divergences appear with extra independent\nrenormalization. Remarkably, the bosonic odd sector (Chern-Simons-like term)\ndoes not renormalize. One-loop computations are also presented and compared\nwith the existing literature.\n", "  Temporal steering, which is a temporal analogue of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nsteering, refers to temporal quantum correlations between the initial and final\nstate of a quantum system. Our analysis of temporal steering inequalities in\nrelation to the average quantum bit error rates reveals the interplay between\ntemporal steering and quantum cloning, which guarantees the security of quantum\nkey-distribution based on mutually-unbiased bases against individual attacks.\nThe key distributions analyzed here include the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol\n(BB84) and the six-state 1998 protocol by Bruss (B98). Moreover, we define a\ntemporal steerable weight, which enables us to identify a kind of monogamy of\ntemporal correlations that is essential to quantum cryptography and useful for\nanalyzing various scenarios of quantum causality.\n", "  We explain the large scale correlations in radio polarization in terms of the\ncorrelations of galaxy cluster/supercluster magnetic field. Assuming that the\npolarization correlations closely follow the spatial correlations of the\nbackground magnetic field we recover the magnetic field spectral index as\n-2.74$\\pm$0.04.This remarkably agrees with cluster magnetic field spectral\nindex obtained in cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We discuss\npossible physical scenarios in which the observed polarization alignment is\nplausible.\n", "  In this letter, we investigate the properties of a strongly interacting\nspinless Fermi gas close to a $p$-wave resonance. We show that the universal\nproperties at a $p$-wave resonance are captured by two contacts, which are\nrelated respectively to the variation of energy with the $p$-wave scattering\nvolume $v$ and with the effective range $R$ in the two adiabatic theorems\nderived. We show how the two contacts determine the leading and sub-leading\nasymptotic behavior of the momentum distribution ($\\sim 1/k^2$ and $\\sim\n1/k^4$) and how they can be measured experimentally by radio-frequency, Bragg,\nand photo-association spectroscopies. Finally, we evaluate the two contacts at\nhigh temperature via the virial expansion.\n", "  We use computer simulations and simple theoretical models to analyze the\nmorphologies that result when rod-like particles end-attach onto a curved\nsurface, creating a finite-thickness monolayer aligned with the surface normal.\nThis geometry leads to two forms of frustration, one associated with the\nincompatibility of hexagonal order on surfaces with Gaussian curvature, and the\nsecond reflecting the deformation of a layer with finite thickness on a surface\nwith non-zero mean curvature. We show that the latter effect leads to a\nfaceting mechanism. Above threshold values of the inter-particle attraction\nstrength and surface mean curvature, the adsorbed layer undergoes a transition\nfrom orientational disorder to an ordered state that is demarcated by\nreproducible patterns of line defects. The number of facets is controlled by\nthe competition between line defect energy and intra-facet strain. Tuning\ncontrol parameters thus leads to a rich variety of morphologies, including\nicosahedral particles and irregular polyhedra. In addition to suggesting a new\nstrategy for the synthesis of aspherical particles with tunable symmetries, our\nresults may shed light on recent experiments in which rod-like HIV GAG proteins\nassemble around nanoscale particles.\n", "  Motivated by the wide applications of BTZ black holes and interesting results\nof gravity's rainbow, we consider three dimensional rainbow solutions and\ninvestigate their thermodynamic properties. In addition to investigate black\nholes thermodynamics related to AdS/CFT correspondence, one may regard\ngravity's rainbow to to encode quantum gravity effects into the black hole\nsolutions. We take into account the various models of linear and nonlinear\nelectrodynamics and study their effects on the gravity's rainbow spacetime. We\nalso examine thermal stability and find that obtained three dimensional rainbow\nblack holes are thermally stable.\n", "  Thanks to its immunity to the detection loophole, the Clauser-Horne/Eberhard\ninequality plays an important role in tests of locality and in certification of\nquantum information protocols based on entanglement. I describe a local model\nthat violates the inequality using a plausible mechanism relying upon a\nparameter of the apparatus, the source emission rate. The effect is generated\nthrough the analysis of time-tagged data using a standard windowed coincidence\ncounting method. Significantly, the detection times here are not functions of\nthe measurement settings, i.e., the fair coincidences assumption is satisfied.\nThis finding has implications for the design and interpretation of experiments\nand for quantum information protocols, as it shows that the coincidence window\nmechanism cannot be eliminated by a demonstration of independence of the\ndetection times and settings. The paper describes a reliable coincidence\ncounting method and shows that it delivers an accurate count of true\ncoincidences. Recent experimental tests of local realism based on the\nClauser-Horne/Eberhard inequality are considered and it is shown that in one\ncase (Christensen et al.) the emission rate is appropriately limited to ensure\nvalid counting, and the data supports locality; in a second case (Giustina et\nal.) the experiment neglects to appropriately limit the emission rate, and the\nclaimed violation can be accounted for locally.\n", "  We investigate the electrical control of the exchange coupling (J) between\ndonor bound electrons in silicon with a detuning gate bias, crucial for the\nimplementation of the two-qubit gate in a silicon quantum computer. We find the\nasymmetric 2P-1P system provides a highly tunable exchange-curve with mitigated\nJ-oscillation, in which 5 orders of magnitude change in the exchange energy can\nbe achieved using a modest range of electric field for 15 nm qubit separation.\nCompared to the barrier gate control of exchange in the Kane qubit, the\ndetuning gate design reduces the demanding constraints of precise donor\nseparation, gate width, density and location, as a range of J spanning over a\nfew orders of magnitude can be engineered for various donor separations. We\nhave combined a large-scale full band atomistic tight-binding method with a\nfull configuration interaction technique to capture the full two-electron\nspectrum of gated donors, providing state-of-the-art calculations of exchange\nenergy in 1P-1P and 2P-1P qubits.\n", "  We analyze noncommutative deformations of a higher dimensional anti-de\nSitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole. Two models based on noncommutative\ninspired distributions of mass and charge are discussed and their\nthermodynamical properties are calculated. In the (3+1)-dimensional case, the\nequation of state and the Gibbs energy function of each model are found.\n", "  We use high resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) to show that\nhelical turbulence can generate significant large-scale fields even in the\npresence of strong small-scale dynamo action. During the kinematic stage, the\nunified large/small-scale dynamo grows fields with a shape-invariant\neigenfunction, with most power peaked at small scales or large $k$, as in\n\\citet{SB14}. Nevertheless, the large-scale field can be clearly detected as an\nexcess power at small $k$ in the negatively polarized component of the energy\nspectrum for a forcing with positively polarized waves. Its strength $bar{B}$,\nrelative to the total rms field $B_{rms}$, decreases with increasing magnetic\nReynolds number, $R_m$. However, as the Lorentz force becomes important, the\nfield generated by the unified dynamo orders itself by saturating on\nsuccessively larger scales. The magnetic integral scale for the positively\npolarized waves, characterizing the small-scale field, increases significantly\nfrom the kinematic stage to saturation. This implies that the small-scale field\nbecomes as coherent as possible for a given forcing scale, which averts the\n$R_m$-dependent quenching of $\\bar{B}/B_rms$. These results are obtained for\n$1024^3$ DNS with magnetic Prandtl numbers of $P_m=0.1$ and $10$. For\n$P_m=0.1$, $\\bar{B}/B_{rms}$ grows from about $0.04$ to about $0.4$ at\nsaturation, aided in the final stages by helicity dissipation. For $P_m=10$,\n$\\bar{B}/B_{rms}$ grows from much less than 0.01 to values of the order the\n$0.2$. Our results confirm that there is a unified large/small-scale dynamo in\nhelical turbulence.\n", "  The classical max-flow min-cut theorem describes transport through certain\nidealized classical networks. We consider the quantum analog for tensor\nnetworks. By associating an integral capacity to each edge and a tensor to each\nvertex in a flow network, we can also interpret it as a tensor network, and\nmore specifically, as a linear map from the input space to the output space.\nThe quantum max flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this linear map over\nall choices of tensors. The quantum min cut is defined to be the minimum\nproduct of the capacities of edges over all cuts of the tensor network. We show\nthat unlike the classical case, the quantum max-flow=min-cut conjecture is not\ntrue in general. Under certain conditions, e.g., when the capacity on each edge\nis some power of a fixed integer, the quantum max-flow is proved to equal the\nquantum min-cut. However, concrete examples are also provided where the\nequality does not hold.\n  We also found connections of quantum max-flow/min-cut with entropy of\nentanglement and the quantum satisfiability problem. We speculate that the\nphenomena revealed may be of interest both in spin systems in condensed matter\nand in quantum gravity.\n", "  For many years annually modulating $\\sim$ keV scintillations have been\nobserved in the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/Libra experiments. A dark matter - electron\nscattering interpretation is now favoured given the stringent constraints on\nnuclear recoil rates obtained by LUX, SuperCDMS and other experiments. Very\nrecently, the XENON100 experiment has observed a modest annual modulation in\ntheir electron recoil events (2.8 $\\sigma$ C.L.) with phase consistent with\nthat of the DAMA experiments. However, they also found a stringent upper limit\non the unmodulated rate, which suggests that any dark matter - electron\nscattering interpretation of these annual modulations must involve a large\nmodulation fraction $\\stackrel{>}{\\sim} 50\\%$. Here we discuss the extent to\nwhich these results might be able to be accommodated within multi-component\ndark matter models featuring light dark matter particles of mass $\\sim$ MeV,\nfocusing on the mirror dark matter case for definiteness. The importance of\ndiurnal variation as a means of testing these kinds of models is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Random lasers have been recently approached as a photonic platform for\ndisordered complex systems, such as spin glasses. In this work, using a\nNd$^{3+}$:YBO$_3$ random laser system operating in the nonresonant (diffusive)\nfeedback regime, we measured the distinct statistics of intensity fluctuations\nand show the physical origin of the complex interplay between the L\\'evy regime\nand the replica-symmetry-breaking transition to the photonic spin-glass phase.\nA novel result is reported: the unsaturated spin-glass behavior for high\nexcitation pulse energies, not observed for systems with coherent feedback. Our\nexperimental findings are corroborated by the present theoretical analysis. The\nresults herein presented universalize the recent observation consistent with\nreplica symmetry breaking in random lasers with coherent feedback, and also\nadvance on the characterization of the fluctuation statistics of the photonic\nspin-glass phase, supported by recent theoretical works on the nonlinear optics\nof complex photonic systems.\n", "  The boundary of a fractionalized topological phase can be gapped by\ncondensing a proper set of bosonic quasiparticles. Interestingly, in the\npresence of a global symmetry, such a boundary can have different symmetry\ntransformation properties. Here we present an explicit example of this kind, in\nthe double semion state with time reversal symmetry. We find two distinct cases\nwhere the semionic excitations on the boundary can transform either as time\nreversal singlets or as time reversal (Kramers) doublets, depending on the\ncoherent phase factor of the Bose condensate. The existence of these two\npossibilities are demonstrated using both field theory argument and exactly\nsolvable lattice models. Furthermore, we study the domain walls between these\ntwo types of gapped boundaries and find that the application of time reversal\nsymmetry tunnels a semion between them.\n", "  We analyze the property of locality with respect to the framework for quantum\nmechanics based on the path integral formalism. As is well known, this\nframework makes the same experimental predictions as does the one based on a\nseparable Hilbert space and the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a heated potassium\nvapor cell, using a simple optical setup with a single free-running diode laser\nand an acousto-optic modulator. Despite the fact that the Doppler width is\ncomparable to the ground state hyperfine splitting, transparency windows with\ndeeply sub-natural line widths and large group indices are obtained. A\nlongitudinal magnetic field is used to split the EIT feature and induce\nmagnetooptical anisotropy. Using the beat note between co-propagating coupling\nand probe beams, we perform a heterodyne measurement of the circular dichroism\n(and therefore birefringence) of the EIT medium. The observed spectra reveal\nthat lin-par-lin polarizations lead to greater anisotropy than lin-perp-lin. A\nsimplified analytical model encompassing sixteen Zeeman states and eighteen\n\\Lamda\\ subsytems reproduces the experimental observations.\n", "  We measured the rate of velocity-changing collisions (VCCs) between alkali\natoms and background gas in buffer-gas-free anti-relaxation-coated cells. The\naverage VCC rate in paraffin-coated rubidium vapor cells prepared in this work\nwas $1 \\times 10^{6}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to $\\sim 1$ mm in the mean\nfree path of rubidium atoms. This short mean free path indicates that the\nbackground gas is not negligible in the sense that alkali atoms do not travel\nfreely between the cell walls. In addition, we found that a heating process\nknown as \"ripening\" increases the VCC rate, and also confirmed that ripening\nimproves the anti-relaxation performance of the coatings.\n", "  Weak topological phases are usually described in terms of protection by the\nlattice translation symmetry. Their characterization explicitly relies on\nperiodicity since weak invariants are expressed in terms of the momentum-space\ntorus. We prove the compatibility of weak topological superconductors with\naperiodic systems, such as quasicrystals. We go beyond usual descriptions of\nweak topological phases and introduce a novel, real-space formulation of the\nweak invariant, based on the Clifford pseudospectrum. A non-trivial value of\nthis index implies a non-trivial bulk phase, which is robust against disorder\nand hosts localized zero-energy modes at the edge. Our recipe for determining\nthe weak invariant is directly applicable to any finite-sized system, including\ndisordered lattice models. This direct method enables a quantitative analysis\nof the level of disorder the topological protection can withstand.\n", "  We study the competition between $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ (RT3) and $q=0$\n(Q0) magnetic orders in spin-one and spin-$3/2$ Kagome-lattice XXZ\nantiferromagnets with varying XY anisotropy parameter $\\Delta$, using series\nexpansion methods. The Hamiltonian is split into two parts: an $H_0$ which\nfavors the classical order in the desired pattern and an $H_1$, which is\ntreated in perturbation theory by a series expansion. We find that the ground\nstate energy series for the RT3 and Q0 phases are identical up to sixth order\nin the expansion, but ultimately a selection occurs, which depends on spin and\nthe anisotropy $\\Delta$. Results for ground state energy and the magnetization\nare presented. These results are compared with recent spin-wave theory and\ncoupled-cluster calculations. The series results for the phase diagram are\nclose to the predictions of spin-wave theory. For the spin-one model at the\nHeisenberg point ($\\Delta=1$), our results are consistent with a vanishing\norder parameter, that is an absence of a magnetically ordered phase. We also\ndevelop series expansions for the ground state energy of the spin-one\nHeisenberg model in the trimerized phase. We find that the ground state energy\nin this phase is lower than those of magnetically ordered ones, supporting the\nexistence of a spontaneously trimerized phase in this model.\n", "  Recently, the presence of fullerenes in the interstellar medium (ISM) has\nbeen confirmed especially with the first confirmed identification of two strong\ndiffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) with C60+. This justifies reassesing the\nimportance of interstellar fullerenes of various sizes with endohedral or\nexohedral inclusions and heterofullerenes (EEHFs). The phenomenology of\nfullerenes is complex. In addition to fullerene formation in shock shattering,\nfully dehydrogenated PAHs in diffuse interstellar (IS) clouds could perhaps\nefficiently transform into fullerenes including EEHFs. But it is extremely\ndifficult to assess their expected abundance, composition and size\ndistribution, except for C60+. EEHFs share many properties with C60, as regards\nstability, formation/destruction and chemical processes, and many basic\nspectral features. We address the interstellar importance of various EEHFs as\npossible DIB carriers. Specifically, we discuss IS properties and the\ncontributions of fullerenes of various sizes and charge such as C60+,\nmetallofullerenes, heterofullerenes, fulleranes, fullerene-PAH compounds,\nH2@C60. We conclude that the landscape of interstellar fullerenes is probably\nmuch richer than heretofore realized. EEHFs, together with pure fullerenes of\nvarious sizes, have properties necessary to be suitably carriers of DIBs:\ncarbonaceous nature; stability and resilience in the ISM; various heteroatoms\nand ionization states; relatively easy formation; few stable isomers; right\nspectral range; energy internal conversion; Jahn-Teller fine structure. This is\nsupported by the C60+ DIBs. But, the lack of information about optical spectra\nother than C60 and IS abundances still precludes definitive assessment of the\nimportance of fullerenes as DIB carriers. Their compounds could significantly\ncontribute to DIBs, but it still seems difficult that they are the only\nimportant DIB carriers.\n", "  Motivated by thermodynamic analogy of black holes and Van der Waals\nliquid/gas system, in this paper, we study $P-V$ criticality of both dilatonic\nBorn-Infeld black holes and their conformal solutions, Brans-Dicke-Born-Infeld\nsolutions. Due to the conformal constraint, we have to neglect the old\nLagrangian of dilatonic Born-Infeld theory and its black hole solutions, and\nintroduce a new one. We obtain spherically symmetric nonlinearly charged black\nhole solutions in both Einstein and Jordan frames and then, we calculate the\nrelated conserved and thermodynamic quantities. After that, we extend the phase\nspace by considering the proportionality of the cosmological constant and\nthermodynamical pressure. We obtain critical values of thermodynamic\ncoordinates through numerical methods and plot relevant $P-V$ and $G-T$\ndiagrams. Investigation of the mentioned diagrams helps us to study\nthermodynamical phase transition. We also analyze the effects of varying\ndifferent parameters on the phase transition of black holes.\n", "  To understand the controllability of complex networks is a forefront problem\nrelevant to different fields of science and engineering. Despite recent\nadvances in network controllability theories, an outstanding issue is to\nunderstand the effect of network topology and nodal interactions on the\ncontrollability at the most fundamental level. Here we develop a universal\nframework based on local information only to unearth the most {\\em fundamental\nbuilding blocks} that determine the controllability. In particular, we\nintroduce a network dissection process to fully unveil the origin of the role\nof individual nodes and links in control, giving rise to a criterion for the\nmuch needed strong structural controllability. We theoretically uncover various\nphase-transition phenomena associated with the role of nodes and links and\nstrong structural controllability. Applying our theory to a large number of\nempirical networks demonstrates that technological networks are more strongly\nstructurally controllable (SSC) than many social and biological networks, and\nreal world networks are generally much more SSC than their random counterparts\nwith intrinsic resilience and adaptability as a result of human design and\nnatural evolution.\n", "  We present a proposal for a probing scheme utilizing Dicke superradiance to\nobtain information about ultracold atoms in optical lattices. A probe photon is\nabsorbed collectively by an ensemble of lattice atoms generating a Dicke state.\nThe lattice dynamics (e.g., tunneling) affects the coherence properties of that\nDicke state and thus alters the superradiant emission characteristics -- which\nin turn provides insight into the lattice (dynamics). Comparing the\nBose-Hubbard and the Fermi-Hubbard model, we find similar superradiance in the\nstrongly interacting Mott insulator regime, but crucial differences in the\nweakly interacting (superfluid or metallic) phase. Furthermore, we study the\npossibility to detect whether a quantum phase transition between the two\nregimes can be considered adiabatic or a quantum quench.\n", "  Based on data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the\nBEPCII storage ring at center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} >$ 4.4 GeV, the\nprocesses $e^+e^- \\rightarrow \\omega \\chi_{c1,2}$ are observed for the first\ntime. With an integrated luminosity of $1074 pb^{-1}$ near $\\sqrt{s} =$ 4.42\nGeV, a significant $\\omega \\chi_{c2}$ signal is found, and the cross section is\nmeasured to be $(20.9 \\pm 3.2 \\pm 2.5)\\pb$. With $567 pb^{-1}$ near $\\sqrt{s}\n=$ 4.6 GeV, a clear $\\omega \\chi_{c1}$ signal is seen, and the cross section is\nmeasured to be $(9.5 \\pm 2.1 \\pm 1.3) \\pb$, while evidence is found for an\n$\\omega \\chi_{c2}$ signal. The first errors are statistical and the second are\nsystematic. Due to low luminosity or low cross section at other energies, no\nsignificant signals are observed. In the $\\omega \\chi_{c2}$ cross section, an\nenhancement is seen around $\\sqrt{s} =$ 4.42 GeV. Fitting the cross section\nwith a coherent sum of the $\\psi(4415)$ Breit-Wigner function and a phase space\nterm, the branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(4415)\\to\\omega\\chi_{c2})$ is\nobtained to be of the order of $10^{-3}$.\n", "  We show an equivalence between 1-query quantum algorithms and representations\nby degree-2 polynomials. Namely, a partial Boolean function $f$ is computable\nby a 1-query quantum algorithm with error bounded by $\\epsilon<1/2$ iff $f$ can\nbe approximated by a degree-2 polynomial with error bounded by $\\epsilon'<1/2$.\nThis result holds for two different notions of approximation by a polynomial:\nthe standard definition of Nisan and Szegedy and the approximation by\nblock-multilinear polynomials recently introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis\n(STOC'2015, arxiv:1411.5729).\n  We also show two results for polynomials of higher degree. First, there is a\ntotal Boolean function which requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ quantum queries but\ncan be represented by a block-multilinear polynomial of degree\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$. Thus, in the general case (for an arbitrary number of\nqueries), block-multilinear polynomials are not equivalent to quantum\nalgorithms.\n  Second, for any constant degree $k$, the two notions of approximation by a\npolynomial (the standard and the block-multilinear) are equivalent. As a\nconsequence, we solve an open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis, showing that\none can estimate the value of any bounded degree-$k$ polynomial $p:\\{0, 1\\}^n\n\\rightarrow [-1, 1]$ with $O(n^{1-\\frac{1}{2k}})$ queries.\n", "  Electron spin resonance experiment reveals that non-magnetic bond doping of\nthe spin-gap magnet (C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2$)Cu$_2$Cl$_6$ (abbreviated PHCC) results\nin the formation of $S=1$ paramagnetic centers that dominate low-temperature\nESR response. We have followed evolution of this signal with doping impurity\ncontent and have found that these centers concentration is quadratic over the\nimpurity content. We also observe coexistence of the ESR responses from these\nlocal centers and from delocalized triplet excitations over certain temperature\nrange.\n", "  The production of K$^+$, K$^-$ and $\\varphi$(1020) mesons is studied in Al+Al\ncollisions at a beam energy of 1.9A GeV which is close or below the production\nthreshold in NN reactions. Inverse slopes, anisotropy parameters, and total\nemission yields of K$^{\\pm}$ mesons are obtained. A comparison of the ratio of\nkinetic energy distributions of K$^-$ and K$^+$ mesons to the HSD transport\nmodel calculations suggests that the inclusion of the in-medium modifications\nof kaon properties is necessary to reproduce the ratio. The inverse slope and\ntotal yield of $\\phi$ mesons are deduced. The contribution to K$^-$ production\nfrom $\\phi$ meson decays is found to be [17 $\\pm$ 3 (stat) $^{+2}_{-7}$ (syst)]\n%. The results are in line with previous K$^{\\pm}$ and $\\phi$ data obtained for\ndifferent colliding systems at similar incident beam energies.\n", "  We prove that a large class of smooth solutions $\\psi$ to the linear wave\nequation $\\Box_g\\psi=0$ on subextremal rotating Kerr spacetimes which are\nregular and decaying along the event horizon become singular at the Cauchy\nhorizon. More precisely, we show that assuming appropriate upper and lower\nbounds on the energy along the event horizon, the solution has infinite\n(non-degenerate) energy on any spacelike hypersurfaces intersecting the Cauchy\nhorizon transversally. Extrapolating from known results in the\nReissner--Nordstr\\\"om case, the assumed upper and lower bounds required for our\ntheorem are conjectured to hold for solutions arising from generic smooth and\ncompactly supported initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface. This result is\nmotivated by the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in general relativity.\n", "  In spite of their many facets, the phenomena of autoimmunity and\nimmunodeficiency seem to be related to each other through the subtle links\nconnecting retroviral mutation and action to immune response and adaptation. In\na previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated\ngenotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of\ninterrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does\nnot cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study\nof quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the\nconclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by\nitself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of\nthe quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by\nthe addition of a further parameter ($\\nu$) to account for the action of\nretroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give\nsimulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues\nof quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the\nappearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to\nhow $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get\nstimulated, relate to each other. While for $\\nu>\\lambda$ the quasispecies\nsurvives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even\ndestroying it, for $\\nu<\\lambda$ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies\nbecome mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic idiotypes. The latter is\nin agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies.\n", "  We identify a new type of shock wave by constructing a stationary expansion\nshock solution of a class of regularised shallow water equations that include\nthe Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney (BBM) and Boussinesq equations. An expansion shock\nexhibits divergent characteristics, thereby contravening the classical Lax\nentropy condition. The persistence of the expansion shock in initial value\nproblems is analysed and justified using matched asymptotic expansions and\nnumerical simulations. The expansion shock's existence is traced to the\npresence of a non-local dispersive term in the governing equation. We establish\nthe algebraic decay of the shock as it is gradually eroded by a simple wave on\neither side. More generally, we observe a robustness of the expansion shock in\nthe presence of weak dissipation and in simulations of asymmetric initial\nconditions where a train of solitary waves is shed from one side of the shock.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum photonic circuits can be used to efficiently generate,\nmanipulate, route and exploit non-classical states of light for distributed\nphoton based quantum information technologies. In this article, we review our\nrecent achievements on the growth, nanofabrication and integration of\nhigh-quality, superconducting niobium nitride thin films on optically active,\nsemiconducting GaAs substrates and their patterning to realise highly efficient\nand ultrafast superconducting detectors on semiconductor nanomaterials\ncontaining quantum dots. Our state-of-the-art detectors reach external\ndetection quantum efficiencies up to 20% for ~4nm thin films and single photon\ntiming resolutions <72ps. We discuss the integration of such detectors into\nquantum dot loaded, semiconductor ridge waveguides, resulting in the on-chip,\ntime-resolved detection of quantum dot luminescence. Furthermore, a prototype\nquantum optical circuit is demonstrated that enabled the on-chip generation of\nresonance fluorescence from an individual InGaAs quantum dot, with a line width\n<15 $\\mu$eV displaced by 1mm from the superconducting detector on the very same\nsemiconductor chip. Thus, all key components required for prototype quantum\nphotonic circuits with sources, optical components and detectors on the same\nchip are reported.\n", "  Tightly focused light beams can exhibit electric fields spinning around any\naxis including the one transverse to the beams' propagation direction. At\ncertain focal positions, the corresponding local polarization ellipse can\ndegenerate into a perfect circle, representing a point of circular\npolarization, or C-point. We consider the most fundamental case of a linearly\npolarized Gaussian beam, where - upon tight focusing - those C-points created\nby transversely spinning fields can form the center of 3D optical polarization\ntopologies when choosing the plane of observation appropriately. Due to the\nhigh symmetry of the focal field, these polarization topologies exhibit non\ntrivial structures similar to M\\\"obius strips. We use a direct physical measure\nto find C-points with an arbitrarily oriented spinning axis of the electric\nfield and experimentally investigate the fully three-dimensional polarization\ntopologies surrounding these C-points by exploiting an amplitude and phase\nreconstruction technique.\n", "  We consider light ray reflections in $n$-dimensional semi-infinite tube, for\n$n\\geq 3$, made of Lambertian material. The source of light is placed far away\nfrom the exit, and the light ray is assumed to reflect so that the distribution\nof the direction of the reflected light ray has the density proportional to the\ncosine of the angle with the normal vector. We present new results on the exit\ndistribution from the tube, and generalizations of some theorems from an\nearlier article, where the dimension was limited to $n=2$ and $3$.\n", "  The Detrending Moving Average (DMA) algorithm has been widely used in its\nseveral variants for characterizing long-range correlations of random signals\nand sets (one-dimensional sequences or high-dimensional arrays) either over\ntime or space. In this paper, mainly based on analytical arguments, the scaling\nperformances of the centered DMA, including higher-order ones, are investigated\nby means of a continuous time approximation and a frequency response approach.\nOur results are also confirmed by numerical tests. The study is carried out for\nhigher-order DMA operating with moving average polynomials of different degree.\nIn particular, detrending power degree, frequency response, asymptotic scaling,\nupper limit of the detectable scaling exponent and finite scale range behavior\nwill be discussed.\n", "  Given a power grid and a transmission (coupling) strength, basin stability is\na measure of synchronization stability for individual nodes. Earlier studies\nhave focused on the basin stability's dependence of the position of the nodes\nin the network for single values of transmission strength. Basin stability\ngrows from zero to one as transmission strength increases, but often in a\ncomplex, nonmonotonous way. In this study, we investigate the entire functional\nform of the basin stability's dependence on transmission strength. To be able\nto perform a systematic analysis, we restrict ourselves to small networks. We\nscan all isomorphically distinct networks with an equal number of power\nproducers and consumers of six nodes or less. We find that the shapes of the\nbasin stability fall into a few, rather well-defined classes, that could be\ncharacterized by the number of edges and the betweenness of the nodes, whereas\nother network positional quantities matter less.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and simulation study of a single\nself-assembled InGaAs quantum dot coupled to a nearby ($\\sim 25nm$) plasmonic\nantenna. Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy shows a $\\sim 2.4\\times$ increase\nof intensity, which is attributed to spatial far-field redistribution of the\nemission from the quantum dot-antenna system. Power-dependent studies show\nsimilar saturation powers of $2.5\\mu W$ for both coupled and uncoupled quantum\ndot emission in polarization-resolved measurements. Moreover, time-resolved\nspectroscopy reveals the absence of Purcell-enhancement of the quantum dot\ncoupled to the antenna as compared to an uncoupled dot, yielding comparable\nexciton lifetimes of $\\tau\\sim0.5ns$. This observation is supported by\nnumerical simulations, suggesting only minor Purcell-effects of $<2\\times$ for\nemitter-antenna separations $>25nm$. The observed increased emission from a\ncoupled quantum dot-plasmonic antenna system is found to be in good qualitative\nagreement with numerical simulations and will lead to a better understanding of\nlight-matter-coupling in such novel semiconductor-plasmonic hybrid systems\n", "  We report on the structural and optical properties of individual bowtie\nnanoantennas both on glass and semiconducting GaAs substrates. The antennas on\nglass (GaAs) are shown to be of excellent quality and high uniformity reflected\nby narrow size distributions with standard deviations for the triangle and gap\nsize of $\\sigma_s^{glass}=4.5nm$ ($\\sigma_s^{GaAs}=2.6nm$) and\n$\\sigma_g^{glass}=5.4nm$ ($\\sigma_g^{GaAs}=3.8nm$), respectively. The\ncorresponding optical properties of individual nanoantennas studied by\ndifferential reflection spectroscopy show a strong reduction of the localised\nsurface plasmon polariton resonance linewidth from $0.21eV$ to $0.07eV$ upon\nreducing the antenna size from $150nm$ to $100nm$. This is attributed to the\nabsence of inhomogeneous broadening as compared to optical measurements on\nnanoantenna ensembles. The inter-particle coupling of an individual bowtie\nnanoantenna, which gives rise to strongly localised and enhanced\nelectromagnetic hotspots, is demonstrated using polarization-resolved\nspectroscopy, yielding a large degree of linear polarization of\n$\\rho_{max}\\sim80\\%$. The combination of highly reproducible nanofabrication\nand fast, non-destructive and non-contaminating optical spectroscopy paves the\nroute towards future semiconductor-based nano-plasmonic circuits, consisting of\nmultiple photonic and plasmonic entities.\n", "  We study how the Rashba spin-orbit interaction influences unconventional\nsuperconductivity in a two dimensional electron gas partially spin-polarized by\na magnetic field. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that for all field\norientations, only the larger Fermi surface is superconducting. When the\nmagnetic field is oriented out-of-plane the system realizes a topological\n$p+ip$ pairing state. When the field is rotated in-plane the order parameter\ndevelops nodes along the field direction and finite center-of-mass-momentum\npairing is realized. We demonstrate that the pairing symmetry of the system can\nbe easily probed experimentally due to the dependence of various thermodynamic\nquantities on the magnetic field geometry, and calculate the electronic\nspecific heat as an example.\n", "  The electronic properties of superconducting Sn films ($T_c \\approx$ 3.8 K)\nchange significantly when reducing the film thickness down to a few nm, in\nparticular close to the percolation threshold. The low-energy electrodynamics\nof such Sn samples can be probed via microwave spectroscopy, e.g. with\nsuperconducting stripline resonators.\n  Here we study Sn thin films, deposited via thermal evaporation -ranging in\nthickness between 38 nm and 842 nm- which encompasses the percolation\ntransition. We use superconducting Pb stripline resonators to probe the\nmicrowave response of these Sn films in a frequency range between 4 GHz and 20\nGHz at temperatures from 7.2 K down to 1.5 K. The measured quality factor of\nthe resonators decreases with rising temperature due to enhanced losses. As a\nfunction of the sample thickness we observe three regimes with significantly\ndifferent properties: samples below percolation, i.e. ensembles of disconnected\nsuperconducting islands, exhibit dielectric properties with negligible losses,\ndemonstrating that macroscopic current paths are required for appreciable\ndynamical conductivity of Sn at GHz frequencies. Thick Sn films, as the other\nlimit, lead to low-loss resonances both above and below $T_c$ of Sn, as\nexpected for bulk conductors. But in an intermediate thickness regime, just\nabove percolation and with labyrinth-like morphology of the Sn, we observe a\nquite different behavior: the superconducting state has a microwave response\nsimilar to the thicker, completely covering films with low microwave losses;\nbut the metallic state of these Sn films is so lossy that resonator operation\nis suppressed completely.\n", "  The thermal conductivity kappa of the iron-arsenide superconductor\nBa1-xKxFe2As2 was measured for heat currents parallel and perpendicular to the\ntetragonal c axis at temperatures down to 50 mK and in magnetic fields up to 15\nT. Measurements were performed on samples with compositions ranging from\noptimal doping (x = 0.34; Tc = 39 K) down to dopings deep into the region where\nantiferromagnetic order coexists with superconductivity (x = 0.16; Tc = 7 K).\nIn zero field, there is no residual linear term in kappa(T) as T goes to 0 at\nany doping, whether for in-plane or inter-plane transport. This shows that\nthere are no nodes in the superconducting gap. However, as x decreases into the\nrange of coexistence with antiferromagnetism, the residual linear term grows\nmore and more rapidly with applied magnetic field. This shows that the\nsuperconducting energy gap develops minima at certain locations on the Fermi\nsurface and these minima deepen with decreasing x. We propose that the minima\nin the gap structure arise when the Fermi surface of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 is\nreconstructed by the antiferromagnetic order.\n", "  Theoretical predictions and recent experimental results suggest one can\nengineer spin Hall effect in graphene by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling in\nthe vicinity of an impurity. We use a Chebyshev expansion of the Kubo-Bastin\nformula to compute the spin conductivity tensor for a tight-binding model of\ngraphene with randomly distributed impurities absorbed on top of carbon atoms.\nWe model the impurity-induced spin-orbit coupling with a graphene-only\nHamiltonian that takes into account three different\ncontributions~\\cite{Gmitra2013} and show how the spin Hall and longitudinal\nconductivities depend on the strength of each spin-orbit coupling and the\nconcentration of impurities. Additionally, we calculate the real-space\nprojection of the density of states in the vicinity of the Dirac point for\nsingle and multiple impurities and correlate these results with the\nconductivity calculations.\n", "  By means of first-principles calculations, we predict two new types of\npartially hydrogenated graphene systems: C$_{6}$H$_{1}$ and C$_{6}$H$_{5}$,\nwhich are shown to be ferromagnetic (FM) semimetal and FM narrow-gap\nsemiconductor, respectively. When properly doped, the Fermi surface of the two\nsystems consists of an electron pocket or six hole patches in the first\nBrillouin zone with completely spin-polarized charge carries. If\nsuperconductivity exists in these systems, the stable pairing symmetries are\nshown to be $p+ip$ for electron doped case, and anisotropic $p+ip$ for hole\ndoped case. The predicted systems may provide fascinating platforms for\nstudying the novel properties of ferromagnetism and triplet-pairing\nsuperconductivity as well as two-dimensional spintronics.\n", "  The Higgs-portal lepton flavor violation is studied in a vectorlike lepton\nmodel. For evading the constraints from rare $Z\\to \\ell^\\pm_i \\ell^\\mp_j$\ndecays, we introduce two triplet vectorlike leptons, $(1,3)_{-1}$ and\n$(1,3)_{0}$. The resultant branching ratio for $h\\to \\mu \\tau$ can be up to\n$10^{-4}$ when the constraints from the invisible $Z$ decays are applied. As a\nresult, the signal strength for $\\tau\\tau$ channel has a $12\\%$ deviation from\nthe standard model prediction, while the muon $g-2$ is two-order of magnitude\nsmaller than the data and $BR(\\tau\\to \\mu \\gamma)$ is of order of $10^{-12}$. A\npredicted doubly charged lepton in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV is\nanalyzed and it is found that the interesting production channels are $pp\\to\n(\\Psi^{--}_{1} \\Psi^{++}_1, \\Psi^{\\pm\\pm}_1 \\Psi^\\mp_1)$. Both single and pair\nproduction cross sections of $\\Psi^{++}_1$ are comparable and can be a few\nhundred fb. The main decay channels for the doubly charged lepton are\n$\\Psi^{\\pm\\pm} \\to \\ell^\\pm W^\\pm$ and for the heavy singly charged lepton are\n$\\Psi^\\pm_1 \\to \\nu W^\\pm, \\ell^\\pm Z$. The numerical analysis is given at $13$\nTeV LHC with $100$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity.\n", "  The pion-nucleon $\\sigma$-term can be stringently constrained by the\ncombination of analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry with\nphenomenological information on the pion-nucleon scattering lengths. Recently,\nlattice calculations at the physical point have been reported that find lower\nvalues by about $3\\sigma$ with respect to the phenomenological determination.\nWe point out that a lattice measurement of the pion-nucleon scattering lengths\ncould help resolve the situation by testing the values extracted from\nspectroscopy measurements in pionic atoms.\n", "  The non-linear evolution of spin-electron acoustic, positron-acoustic, and\nspin-electron-positron acoustic waves is considered. It is demonstrated that\nweakly nonlinear dynamics of each wave leads to the soliton formation.\nAltogether, we report on existence of three different solitons. The\nspin-electron acoustic soliton known for electron-ion plasmas is described for\nelectron-positron-ion plasmas for the first time. The existence of the\nspin-electron-positron acoustic soliton is reported for the first time. The\npositron-acoustic soliton and the spin-electron-positron acoustic soliton arise\nas the areas of a positive electric potential. The spin-electron acoustic\nsoliton behaves as the area of a negative electric potential at the relatively\nsmall positron imbalance $n_{0p}/n_{0e}=0.1$ and as the area of a positive\nelectric potential at the relatively large positron imbalance\n$n_{0p}/n_{0e}=0.5$.\n", "  In earlier works, we had shown that the observed soft lags and r.m.s versus\nenergy of the lower kHz QPO of neutron star binaries can be explained in the\nframework of a thermal Comptonization model. It was also shown that such an\ninterpretation can provide estimates of the size and geometry of the\nComptonizing medium. Here we study the dependence of these estimates on the\ntime-averaged spectral model assumed and on the frequency of the QPO. We use\nthe high quality time lag and r.m.s obtained during March 3rd 1996 observation\nof 4U 1608-52 by RXTE as well as other observations of the source at different\nQPO frequencies where a single time-lag between two broad energy bands have\nbeen reported. We compare the results obtained when assuming that the\ntime-averaged spectra are represented by the spectrally degenerate \"hot\" and\n\"cold\" seed photon spectral models. We find that for the \"hot\" seed photon\nmodel the medium size is in the range of 0.3-2.0 kms and the size decreases\nwith increasing QPO frequency. On the other hand for the \"cold\" seed photon\nmodel the range for the sizes are much larger 0.5-20 kms and hence perhaps show\nno variation with QPO frequency. Our results emphasis the need for broad band\nspectral information combined with high frequency timing to lift this\ndegeneracy. We further show that the r.m.s as a function of energy for the\nupper kHz QPO is similar to the lower one and indeed we find that the driver\nfor this QPO should be temperature variations of the corona identical to the\nlower kHz QPO. However, the time lag reported for the upper kHz QPO is hard,\nwhich if confirmed, would challenge the simple Comptonization model presented\nhere. It would perhaps imply that reverberation lags are also important and/or\nthe dominate spectral component is not a single temperature medium but a\nmulti-temperature complex one.\n", "  Luttinger liquids (LLs) arise by coupling left- and right-moving particles\nthrough interactions in one dimension. This most natural partitioning of LLs is\ninvestigated by the momentum-space entanglement after a quantum quench using\nanalytical and numerical methods. We show that the momentum-space entanglement\nspectrum of a LL possesses many universal features both in equilibrium and\nafter a quantum quench. The largest entanglement eigenvalue is identical to the\nLoschmidt echo, i.e. the overlap of the disentangled and final wavefunctions of\nthe system. The second largest eigenvalue is the overlap of the first excited\nstate of the disentangled system with zero total momentum and the final\nwavefunction. The entanglement gap is universal both in equilibrium and after a\nquantum quench. The momentum-space entanglement entropy is always extensive and\nsaturates fast to a time independent value after the quench, in sharp contrast\nto a spatial bipartitioning.\n", "  The neutrino masses and mixings indicated by current neutrino oscillation\nexperiments suggest that the neutrino mass matrix possesses an approximate\n$\\mu-\\tau$ exchange symmetry. In this study, we explore the neutrino parameter\nspace and show that if a small $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry breaking is considered, the\nMajorana $CP$ phases must be unequal and non-zero independently of the neutrino\nmass scale. Moreover, a small $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry breaking favors\nquasi-degenerate masses. We also show that Majorana phases are strongly\ncorrelated with the Dirac $CP$ violating phase. Within this framework, we\nobtain robust predictions for the values of the Majorana phases when the\nexperimental indications for the Dirac $CP$ phase are used.\n", "  The parameters, i.e. the mass and current coupling of the exotic $X(5568)$\nstate observed by the D0 Collaboration as well as the decay width of the\nprocess $X \\to B_s^{0}\\pi^{+}$ are explored using $B\\bar{K}$ molecule\nassumption on its structure. Employed computational methods include QCD\ntwo-point and light-cone sum rules, latter being considered in the soft-meson\napproximation. The obtained results are compared with the data of the D0\nCollaboration as well as with the predictions of the diquark-antidiquark model.\nThis comparison strengthens a diquark-antidiquark picture for the $X(5568)$\nstate rather than a meson molecule structure.\n", "  Motivated by the high superconducting transition temperature of monolayer\nFeSe on SrTiO3, we propose a potential three-dimensional high-temperature\nsuperconductor superlattice FeSe-SrTiO3 and study its structural stability and\nelectronic structure using density functional theory. We find that the binding\nenergy between the FeSe and SrTiO3 layers is about 0.7 eV per (Fe2Se2) unit and\nthat it saturates already within a single TiO2 atomic layer of SrTiO3. In\naddition we analyzed the dynamical stability of the superlattice and compared\nit to the case of bulk SrTiO3.\n", "  Forecasts in cosmology, both with Monte-Carlo Markov-chain methods and with\nthe Fisher matrix formalism, depend on the choice of the fiducial model because\nboth the signal strength of any observable as well as the model nonlinearities\nlinking observables to cosmological parameters vary in the general case. In\nthis paper we propose a method for extrapolating Fisher-forecasts across the\nspace of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable ba- sis. We\ndemonstrate the validity of our method with constraints on a standard dark\nenergy model extrapolated from a {\\Lambda}CDM-model, as can be expected from\n2-bin weak lensing to- mography with a Euclid-like survey, in the parameter\npairs $(\\Omega_\\text{m},\\sigma_8)$, $(\\Omega_\\text{m}, w_0)$ and $(w_0,\nw_\\text{a})$. Our numerical results include very accurate extrapolations across\na wide range of cosmo- logical parameters in terms of shape, size and\norientation of the parameter likelihood, and a decomposition of the change of\nthe likelihood contours into modes, which are straightforward to interpret in a\ngeometrical way. We find that in particular the variation of the dark energy\nfigure of merit is well captured by our formalism.\n", "  We present an analytical and numerical study of the parking lot model (PLM)\nof granular relaxation and make a connection to the aging dynamics of dense\ncolloids. As we argue, the PLM is a Kinetically Constrained Model which\nfeatures astronomically large equilibration times and displays a characteristic\naging behavior on all observable time scales. The density of parked cars\ndisplays quasi-equilibrium Gaussian fluctuations interspersed by increasingly\nrare intermittent events, quakes, which can lead to an increase of the density\nto new record values. Defining active clusters as the shortest domains of\nparked cars which must be re-arranged to allow further insertions, we find that\ntheir typical length grows logarithmically with time for low enough\ntemperatures and show how the number of active clusters on average gradually\ndecreases as the system approaches equilibrium. We further characterize the\naging process in terms of the statistics of the record sized fluctuations in\nthe interstitial free volume which lead to quakes and show that quakes are\nuncorrelated and that they can be approximately described as a Poisson process\nin logarithmic time.\n", "  \u007fA search for radiative decays of the $P$-wave spin singlet charmonium\nresonance $h_c$ is performed based on $4.48 \\times 10^{8}$ $\\psi'$ events\ncollected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. Events\nof the reaction channels $h_{c} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta'$ and $\\gamma \\eta$ are\nobserved with a statistical significance of $8.4 \\sigma$ and $4.0 \\sigma$,\nrespectively, for the first time. The branching fractions of $h_{c} \\rightarrow\n\\gamma \\eta'$ and $h_{c} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta$ are measured to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(h_{c} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta')=(1.52 \\pm 0.27 \\pm\n0.29)\\times10^{-3}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(h_{c} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta)=(4.7 \\pm\n1.5 \\pm 1.4)\\times10^{-4}$, respectively, where the first errors are\nstatistical and the second are systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Coherence vectors and correlation matrices are important functions frequently\nused in physics. The numerical calculation of these functions directly from\ntheir definitions, which involves Kronecker products and matrix\nmultiplications, may seem to be a reasonable option. Notwithstanding, as we\ndemonstrate in this article, some algebraic manipulations before programming\ncan reduce considerably their computational complexity. Besides, we provide\nFortran code to generate generalized Gell Mann matrices and to compute the\noptimized and unoptimized versions of the associated Bloch's vectors and\ncorrelation matrix, in the case of bipartite quantum systems. As a code test\nand application example, we consider the calculation of Hilbert-Schmidt quantum\ndiscords.\n", "  Bright and broadband coherent mid-IR radiation is important for exciting and\nprobing molecular vibrations. Using cascaded nonlinearities in conventional\nquadratic nonlinear crystal like lithium niobate, self-defocusing near-IR\nsolitons have been demonstrated that led to very broadband supercontinuum\ngeneration in the visible, near-IR and short-wavelength mid-IR. Here we conduct\nan experiment where a mid-IR crystal pumped in the mid-IR gives multiple-octave\nspanning supercontinua. The crystal is cut for noncritical interaction, so the\nthree-wave mixing of a single mid-IR femtosecond pump source leads to highly\nphase-mismatched second-harmonic generation. This self-acting cascaded process\nleads to the formation of a self-defocusing soliton at the mid-IR pump\nwavelength and after the self-compression point multiple octave-spanning\nsupercontinua are observed (covering 1.6-$7.0~\\mu$m). The results were recorded\nin a commercially available crystal LiInS$_2$ pumped in the 3-$4~\\mu$m range,\nbut other mid-IR crystals can readily be used as well.\n", "  Four formulations of quantum mechanics on noncommutative Moyal phase spaces\nare reviewed. These are the canonical, path-integral, Weyl-Wigner and\nsystematic formulations. Although all these formulations represent quantum\nmechanics on a phase space with the same deformed Heisenberg algebra, there are\nmathematical and conceptual differences which we discuss.\n", "  Phonon blockade is a purely quantum phenomenon, analogous to Coulomb and\nphoton blockades, in which a single phonon in an anharmonic mechanical\nresonator can impede the excitation of a second phonon. We propose an\nexperimental method to realize phonon blockade in a driven harmonic\nnanomechanical resonator coupled to a qubit, where the coupling is proportional\nto the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$. This is in contrast\nto the standard realizations of phonon and photon blockade effects in Kerr-type\n$\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear systems. The nonlinear coupling strength can be adjusted\nconveniently by changing the coherent drive field.As an example, we apply this\nmodel to predict and describe phonon blockade in a nanomechanical resonator\ncoupled to a Cooper-pair box (i.e., a charge qubit) with a linear longitudinal\ncoupling. By obtaining the solutions of the steady state for this composite\nsystem, we give the conditions forobserving strong antibunching and\nsub-Poissonian phonon-number statistics in this induced second-order nonlinear\nsystem. Besides using the qubit to produce phonon blockade states, the qubit\nitself can also be employed to detect blockade effects by measuring its states.\nNumerical simulations indicate that the robustness of the phonon blockade, and\nthe sensitivity of detecting it, will benefit from this strong induced\nnonlinear coupling.\n", "  Recent advances in nonequilibrium statistical physics have provided\nunprecedented insight into the thermodynamics of dynamic processes. The author\nrecently used these advances to extend Landauer's semi-formal reasoning\nconcerning the thermodynamics of bit erasure, to derive the minimal free energy\nrequired to implement an arbitrary computation. Here, I extend this analysis,\nderiving the minimal free energy required by an organism to run a given\n(stochastic) map $\\pi$ from its sensor inputs to its actuator outputs. I use\nthis result to calculate the input-output map $\\pi$ of an organism that\noptimally trades off the free energy needed to run $\\pi$ with the phenotypic\nfitness that results from implementing $\\pi$. I end with a general discussion\nof the limits imposed on the rate of the terrestrial biosphere's information\nprocessing by the flux of sunlight on the Earth.\n", "  CP violation, which is crucial for producing the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse, is enhanced in particle-antiparticle oscillations. We study\nparticle-antiparticle oscillations (of a particle with mass O(100 GeV)) with CP\nviolation in the early Universe in the presence of interactions with O(ab-fb)\ncross-sections. We show that, if baryon-number-violating interactions exist, a\nbaryon asymmetry can be produced via out-of-equilibrium decays of oscillating\nparticles. As a concrete example we study a $U(1)_R$-symmetric,\nR-parity-violating SUSY model with pseudo-Dirac gauginos, which undergo\nparticle-antiparticle oscillations. Taking bino to be the lightest\n$U(1)_R$-symmetric particle, and assuming it decays via baryon-number-violating\ninteractions, we show that bino-antibino oscillations can produce the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe.\n", "  We incorporate all gauge-invariant local composite operators into the\ntwistor-space formulation of N=4 SYM theory, detailing and expanding on ideas\nwe presented recently in arXiv:1603.04471. The vertices for these operators\ncontain infinitely many terms and we show how they can be constructed by taking\nsuitable derivatives of a light-like Wilson loop in twistor space and shrinking\nit down to a point. In particular, these vertices directly yield the tree-level\nMHV super form factors of all composite operators in N=4 SYM theory.\n", "  Nonlinear Maxwell equations are written up to the third-power deviations from\na constant-field background, valid within any local nonlinear electrodynamics\nincluding QED with a Euler-Heisenberg (EH) effective Lagrangian. The linear\nelectric response to an imposed static finite-sized charge is found in the\nvacuum filled by an arbitrary combination of constant and homogeneous electric\nand magnetic fields. The modified Coulomb field and corrections to the total\ncharge and to the charge density are given in terms of derivatives of the\neffective Lagrangian with respect to the field invariants. These are\nspecialized for the EH Lagrangian.\n", "  Kinetic helicity is one of the invariants of the Euler equations that is\nassociated with the topology of vortex lines within the fluid. In superfluids,\nthe vorticity is concentrated along vortex filaments. In this setting, helicity\nwould be expected to acquire its simplest form. However, the lack of a core\nstructure for vortex filaments appears to result in a helicity that does not\nretain its key attribute as a quadratic invariant. By defining a spanwise\nvector to the vortex through the use of a Seifert framing, we are able to\nintroduce twist and henceforth recover the key properties of helicity. We\npresent several examples for calculating internal twist to illustrate why the\ncentreline helicity alone will lead to ambiguous results if a twist\ncontribution is not introduced. Our choice of the spanwise vector can be\nexpressed in terms of the tangential component of velocity along the filament.\nSince the tangential velocity does not alter the configuration of the vortex at\nlater times, we are able to recover a similar equation for the internal twist\nangle for classical vortex tubes. Our results allow us to explain how a\nquasi-classical limit of helicity emerges from helicity considerations for\nindividual superfluid vortex filaments.\n", "  Engineered core-shell cylinders are good candidates for applications in\ninvisibility and cloaking.In particular, hyperbolic nanotubes demonstrate\ntunable ultra-low scattering cross section in the visible spectral range. In\nthis work we investigate the limits of validity of the condition for\ninvisibility, which was shown to rely on reaching an epsilon near zero in one\nof the components of the effective permittivity tensor of the anisotropic\nmetamaterial cavity. For incident light polarized perpendicularly to the\nscatterer axis, critical deviations are found in low-birefringent arrangements\nand also with high-index cores. We demonstrate that the ability of anisotropic\nmetallodielectric nanocavities to dramatically reduce the scattered light is\nassociated with a multiple Fano-resonance phenomenon. We extensively explore\nsuch resonant effect to identify tunable windows of invisibility.\n", "  We study a variety of field theories with vanishing single soft limits. In\nall cases, the structure of the soft limit is controlled by a larger theory,\nwhich provides an extension of the original one by adding more fields and\ninteractions. Our main example is the $U(N)$ non-linear sigma model in its CHY\nrepresentation. Its extension is a theory in which the NLSM Goldstone bosons\ninteract with a cubic biadjoint scalar. Other theories we study and extend are\nthe special Galileon and Born-Infeld theory, including its maximally\nsupersymmetric version in four dimensions, the DBI-Volkov-Akulov theory. In all\nthe cases, we propose the CHY representation of the complete tree-level\nS-matrix of the extended theories. In fact, CHY formulas are the key technique\nfor studying the single soft limit behavior of the original theories. As a\nbyproduct, we show that the tree-level S-matrix of the extended NLSM theory can\nbe constructed using a very compact BCFW-like recursion relation, where\nphysical poles are at most linear in the deformation parameter.\n", "  One fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed\nquantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the\nemergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept,\nchallenging our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and\nquantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body\nlocalization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a\ntwo-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single site resolved\nmeasurements we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared\nout-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging\nlength scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments mark\nthe first demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization\nin a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical\ncomputers.\n", "  The spin-torque in magnetic tunnel junctions possesses two components that\nboth depend on the applied voltage. Here, we develop a new method for the\naccurate extraction of this bias-dependence from experiments over large voltage\nranges. We study several junctions with different magnetic layer structures of\nthe top electrode. Our results obtained on junctions with symmetric CoFeB\nelectrodes agree well with theoretical calculations. The bias-dependences of\nasymmetric samples, with top electrodes containing NiFe, however, are twisted\ncompared to the quadratic form generally assumed. Our measurements reveal the\ncomplexity of spin-torque mechanisms at large bias.\n", "  We revisit the WIMP-type dark matter scattering on electrons that results in\natomic ionization, and can manifest itself in a variety of existing\ndirect-detection experiments. Unlike the WIMP-nucleon scattering, where current\nexperiments probe typical interaction strengths much smaller than the Fermi\nconstant, the scattering on electrons requires a much stronger interaction to\nbe detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for\nsuch new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or\nvector couplings to dark matter and to electrons. We then perform state of the\nart numerical calculations of atomic ionization relevant to the existing\nexperiments. Our goals are to consistently take into account the atomic physics\naspect of the problem (e.g., the relativistic effects, which can be quite\nsignificant), and to scan the parameter space: the dark matter mass, the\nmediator mass, and the effective coupling strength, to see if there is any part\nof the parameter space that could potentially explain the DAMA modulation\nsignal. While we find that the modulation fraction of all events with energy\ndeposition above 2 keV in NaI can be quite significant, reaching ~50%, the\nrelevant parts of the parameter space are excluded by the XENON10 and XENON100\nexperiments.\n", "  We scrutinize recent QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) results to lowest order\n(LO) predicting the masses of the BK molecule and (su)\\bar(bd) four-quark\nstates. We improve these results by adding NLO and N2LO corrections to the PT\ncontributions giving a more precise meaning on the b-quark mass definition used\nin the analysis. We extract our optimal predictions using Laplace sum rule\n(LSR) within the standard stability criteria versus the changes of the external\nfree parameters (\\tau-sum rule variable, t_c continuum threshold and\nsubtraction constant \\mu). The smallness of the higher order PT corrections\njustifies (a posteriori) the LO order results + the uses of the ambiguous heavy\nquark mass to that order. However, our predicted spectra in the range (5173\\sim\n5226) MeV, summarized in Table 7, for exotic hadrons built with four different\nflavours (buds), do not support some previous interpretations of the D0\ncandidate[1], X(5568), as a pure molecule or a four-quark state. If\nexperimentally confirmed, it could result from their mixing with an angle: sin\n2\\theta\\approx 0.15. One can also scan the region (2327~ 2444) MeV (where the\nD*_{s0}(2317) might be a good candidate) and the one (5173~ 5226) MeV for\ndetecting these (cuds) and (buds) unmixed exotic hadrons (if any) via,\neventually, their radiative or \\pi+hadrons decays.\n", "  Left-Right symmetric models with general $g_L \\neq g_R$ gauge couplings which\ninclude bidoublet and triplet scalar multiplets are studied. Possible scalar\nmass spectra are outlined by imposing Tree-Unitarity, and Vacuum Stability\ncriteria and also using the bounds on neutral scalar masses $M_{\\rm H^{ FCNC}}$\nwhich assure the absence of Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC). We are\nfocusing on mass spectra relevant for the LHC analysis, i.e., the scalar masses\nare around TeV scale. As all non-standard heavy particle masses are related to\nthe vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the right-handed triplet ($v_R$), the\ncombined effects of relevant Higgs potential parameters and $M_{\\rm H^{ FCNC}}$\nregulate the lower limits of heavy gauge boson masses. The complete set of\nRenormalization Group Evolutions for all couplings are provided at the 1-loop\nlevel, including the mixing effects in the Yukawa sector. Most of the scalar\ncouplings suffer from the Landau poles at the intermediate scale $Q \\sim\n10^{6.5}$ GeV, which in general coincides with violation of the Tree-Unitarity\nbounds.\n", "  In the present paper the fermion fields, living in the background of\nfive-dimensional warped brane world models with compact extra dimension, are\nthoroughly examined. The Kaluza-Klein decomposition and isolation of the\nphysical degrees of freedom is performed for those five-dimensional fermion\nfield Lagrangians, which admit such a decomposition to be performed in a\nmathematically consistent way and provide a physically reasonable\nfour-dimensional effective theory. It is also shown that for the majority of\nfive-dimensional fermion field Lagrangians there are no (at least rather\nobvious) ways to perform the Kaluza-Klein decomposition consistently. Moreover,\nin these cases one may expect the appearance of various pathologies in the\nfour-dimensional effective theory. Among the cases, for which the Kaluza-Klein\ndecomposition can be performed in a mathematically consistent way, the case,\nwhich reproduces the Standard Model by the zero Kaluza-Klein modes most closely\nregardless of the size of the extra dimension, is examined in detail in the\nbackground of the Randall-Sundrum model.\n", "  This work is dedicated to the study of both large-$N$ and perturbative\nquantum behaviors of Lifshitz nonlinear sigma models with dynamical critical\nexponent $z=2$ in 2+1 dimensions. We discuss renormalization and\nrenormalization group aspects with emphasis on the possibility of emergence of\nLorentz invariance at low energies. Contrarily to the perturbative expansion,\nwhere in general the Lorentz symmetry restoration is delicate and may depend on\nstringent fine-tuning, our results provide a more favorable scenario in the\nlarge-$N$ framework. We also consider supersymmetric extension in this\nnonrelativistic situation.\n", "  The two-pion low-energy contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon, $a_\\mu\\equiv(g-2)_\\mu/2$, expres sed as an integral over the modulus\nsquared of the pion electromagnetic form fac tor, brings a relatively large\ncontribution to the theoretical error, since the low accuracy of experimental\nmeasurements in this region is amplified by the drastic increase of the\nintegration kernel. We derive stringent constraints on the two-pion\ncontribution by exploiting analyticity and unitarity of the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor. To avoid the poor knowledge of the modulus of this\nfunction, we use instead its phase, known with high precision in the elastic\nregion from Roy equations for pion-pion scattering via the Fermi-Watson\ntheorem. Above the inelastic threshold we adopt a conservative integral\ncondition on the modulus, determined from data and perturbative QCD. Additional\nhigh precision data on the modulus in the range $0.65-0.71$ GeV, obtained from\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation and $\\tau$-decay experiments, are used to improve the\npredictions on the modulus at lower energies by means of a parametrization-free\nanalytic extrapolation. The results are optimal for a given input and do not\ndepend on the unknown phase of the form factor above the inelastic threshold.\nThe present work improves a previous analysis based on the same technique,\nincluding more experimental data and employing better statistical tools for\ntheir treatment. We obtain for the contribution to $a_\\mu$ from below 0.63 GeV\nthe value $(133.258 \\pm 0.723)\\times 10^{-10}$, which amounts to a reduction of\nthe theoretical error by about $6 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n", "  Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) encoding multidimensional information\nof hadron partonic structure appear as the building blocks in a factorized\ndescription of hard exclusive reactions. The nucleon GPDs have been accessed by\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production with\nlepton beam. A complementary probe with hadron beam is the exclusive\npion-induced Drell-Yan process. In this paper, we discuss recent theoretical\nadvances on describing this process in terms of nucleon GPDs and pion\ndistribution amplitudes. Furthermore, we address the feasibility of measuring\nthe exclusive pion-induced Drell-Yan process $\\pi^- p \\to \\mu^+\\mu^- n$ via a\nspectrometer at the High Momentum Beamline being constructed at J-PARC in\nJapan. Realization of such measurement at J-PARC will provide a new test of\nperturbative QCD descriptions of a novel class of hard exclusive reactions. It\nwill also offer the possibility of experimentally accessing nucleon GPDs at\nlarge timelike virtuality.\n", "  Emission line galaxies are one of the main tracers of the large-scale\nstructure to be targeted by the next-generation dark energy surveys. To provide\na better understanding of the properties and statistics of these galaxies, we\nhave collected spectroscopic data from the VVDS and DEEP2 deep surveys and\nestimated the galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) of three distinct emission\nlines, [OII] ($0.5 < z < 1.3$), H{\\beta} ($0.3 < z < 0.8$) and [OIII] ($0.3 < z\n< 0.8$). Our measurements are based on 35,639 emission line galaxies and cover\na volume of $\\sim10^7$Mpc$^3$. We present the first measurement of the H{\\beta}\nLF at these redshifts. We have also compiled LFs from the literature that were\nbased on independent data or covered different redshift ranges, and we fit the\nentire set over the whole redshift range with analytic Schechter and Saunders\nmodels, assuming a natural redshift dependence of the parameters. We find that\nthe characteristic luminosity ($L_*$) and density ($\\phi_*$) of all LFs\nincrease with redshift. Using the Schechter model over the redshift ranges\nconsidered, we find that, for [OII] emitters, the characteristic luminosity\n$L_*(z=0.5)=3.2\\times10^{41}$ erg/s increases by a factor of $2.7 \\pm 0.2$ from\nz=0.5 to 1.3; for H{\\beta} emitters $L_*(z=0.3)=1.3\\times10^{41}$ erg/s\nincreases by a factor of $2.0 \\pm 0.2$ from z=0.3 to 0.8; and for [OIII]\nemitters $L_*(z=0.3)=7.3\\times10^{41}$ erg/s increases by a factor of $3.5 \\pm\n0.4$ from z=0.3 to 0.8.\n", "  Many theories require augmenting the Standard Model with additional scalar\nfields with large order one couplings. We present a new solution to the\nhierarchy problem for these scalar fields. We explore parity- and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric theories where the Standard Model Higgs potential has\ntwo vacua. The parity or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ copy of the Higgs lives in the minimum\nfar from the origin while our Higgs occupies the minimum near the origin of the\npotential. This approach results in a theory with multiple light scalar fields\nbut with only a single hierarchy problem, since the bare mass is tied to the\nHiggs mass by a discrete symmetry. The new scalar does not have a new hierarchy\nproblem associated with it because its expectation value and mass are generated\nby dimensional transmutation of the scalar quartic coupling. The location of\nthe second Higgs minimum is not a free parameter, but is rather a function of\nthe matter content of the theory. As a result, these theories are extremely\npredictive. We develop this idea in the context of a solution to the strong CP\nproblem. We show this mechanism postdicts the top Yukawa to be within $1\n\\sigma$ of the currently measured value and predicts scalar color octets with\nmasses in the range 9-200 TeV.\n", "  Free massive higher spin fields in weak background gravitational fields are\ndiscussed. Contrary to the spin one case, higher spin fields should have\nnontrivial non-minimal couplings to the curvature. A precise analysis is given\nfor the spin 2 case, and it is shown that two conditions should be satisfied\namong five non-minimal coupling constants, which we derive both in the\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. It is checked that the linearized limit\nof the massive gravity theory indeed has the non-minimal couplings that satisfy\nthe conditions. We also discuss the form of the non-minimal couplings for the\nspin 3 case.\n", "  In this work, we study the magnetization behaviors of the classical Ising\nmodel on the triangular lattice using Monte Carlo simulations, and pay\nparticular attention to the effect of further-neighbor interactions. Several\nfascinating spin states are identified to be stabilized in certain magnetic\nfield regions, respectively, resulting in the magnetization plateaus at 2/3,\n5/7, 7/9 and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization MS, in addition to the well\nknown plateaus at 0, 1/3 and 1/2 of MS. The stabilization of these interesting\norders can be understood as the consequence of the competition between Zeeman\nenergy and exchange energy.\n", "  This brief overview presents an introduction to the heavy-quark exotic hadron\ncandidates, $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $P_c$, believed to be tetraquark and pentaquark\nstates. After an abridged account of their discovery, we outline the various\ntheoretical pictures employed to describe their structure, with special focus\non the new dynamical diquark picture.\n", "  A set of numerical solvers for the linear dispersion relations of the\ngyrokinetic, the hybrid-kinetic, and the fully kinetic model is employed to\nstudy the physics of the kinetic Alfv\\'en wave and the fast magnetosonic mode\nin these models. In particular, we focus on parameters that are relevant for\nsolar wind oriented applications (using a homogeneous, isotropic background),\nwhich are characterized by wave propagation angles averaging close to 90{\\deg}.\nIt is found that the gyrokinetic model, while lacking high-frequency solutions\nand cyclotron effects, faithfully reproduces the fully kinetic Alfv\\'en wave\nphysics close to, and sometimes significantly beyond, the boundaries of its\nrange of validity. The hybrid-kinetic model, on the other hand, is much more\ncomplete in terms of high-frequency waves, but owing to its simple electron\nmodel it is found to severely underpredict wave damping rates even on ion\nspatial scales across a large range of parameters, despite containing full\nkinetic ion physics.\n", "  We revisit a family of infinite-energy solutions of the 3D incompressible\nEuler equations proposed by Gibbon et al. [9] and shown to blowup in finite\ntime by Constantin [6]. By adding a damping term to the momentum equation we\nexamine how the damping coefficient can arrest this blowup. Further, we show\nthat similar infinite-energy solutions of the inviscid 3D Boussinesq system\nwith damping can develop a singularity in finite time as long as the damping\neffects are insufficient to arrest the (undamped) 3D Euler blowup in the\nassociated damped 3D Euler system.\n", "  Shape transformations in driven and damped molecular chains are considered.\nClosed chains of weakly coupled molecular subunits under the action of\nspatially homogeneous time-periodic external field are studied. The coupling\nbetween the internal excitations and the bending degrees of freedom of the\nchain modifies the local bending rigidity of the chain. In the absence of\ndriving the array takes a circular shape. When the energy pumped into the\nsystem exceeds some critical value the chain undergoes a non-equilibrium phase\ntransition: the circular shape of the aggregate becomes unstable and the chain\ntakes the shape of an ellipse or, in general, of a polygon. The excitation\nenergy distribution becomes spatially nonuniform: it localizes in such places\nwhere the chain is more flat. The weak interaction of the chain with a flat\nsurface restricts the dynamics to a flat manifold\n", "  We use the effective-field theory with correlations based on different\ncluster sizes to investigate phase diagrams of the frustrated Ising\nantiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice with isotropic interactions of the\nstrength $J_1 < 0$ between nearest-neighbour pairs and $J_2 < 0$ between\nnext-nearest neighbour pairs of spins. We present results for the ground-state\nenergy as a function of the frustration parameter $R = J_2 /|J_1|$. We find\nthat the cluster-size has a considerable effect on the existence and location\nof a tricritical point in the phase diagram at which the phase transition\nchanges from the second order to the first one.\n", "  A nanostructured target is proposed to enhance an intense-laser contrast:\nwhen a laser prepulse irradiates a nanostructured solid target surface, the\nprepulse is absorbed effectively by the nanostructured surface. The\nnanostructure size should be less than the laser wavelength. After the prepulse\nabsorption, the front part of the main pulse destroys the microstructure and\nmakes the surface a flat plasma mirror. The body of the main pulse is reflected\nalmost perfectly. Compared with conventional plasma mirrors, the nanostructured\nsurface is effective for the absorption of the intense laser prepulse, whose\nintensity is higher than 10^14 W/cm2. The nanostructured laser cleaner improves\nthe laser pulse contrast by about a hundredfold. The nanostructured laser\ncleaner works well for next-generation intense lasers.\n", "  The Quantum-Bayesian interpretation of quantum theory claims to eliminate the\nquestion of quantum nonlocality. This claim is not justified, because the\nquestion of non-locality does not arise due to any interpretation of quantum\ntheory, but due to objective experimental facts. We define the notion\n\"objective paradox\" and explain, comparing QBism and the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, how avoidance of any paradox results into poor explanatory\npower of an interpretation, if there actually exists an objective paradox.\n", "  Cosmic Dark Fluid is considered as a non-stationary medium, in which\nelectromagnetic waves propagate, and magneto-electric field structures emerge\nand evolve. A medium - type representation of the Dark Fluid allows us to\ninvolve into analysis the concepts and mathematical formalism elaborated in the\nframework of classical covariant electrodynamics of continua, and to\ndistinguish dark analogs of well-known medium-effects, such as optical\nactivity, pyro-electricity, piezo-magnetism, electro- and magneto-striction and\ndynamo-optical activity. The Dark Fluid is assumed to be formed by a duet of a\nDark Matter (a pseudoscalar axionic constituent) and Dark Energy (a scalar\nelement); respectively, we distinguish electrodynamic effects induced by these\ntwo constituents of the Dark Fluid. The review contains discussions of ten\nmodels, which describe electrodynamic effects induced by Dark Matter and/or\nDark Energy. The models are accompanied by examples of exact solutions to the\nmaster equations, correspondingly extended; applications are considered for\ncosmology and space-times with spherical and pp-wave symmetries. In these\napplications we focused the attention on three main electromagnetic phenomena\ninduced by the Dark Fluid: first, emergence of Longitudinal Magneto-Electric\nClusters; second, generation of anomalous electromagnetic responses; third,\nformation of Dark Epochs in the Universe history.\n", "  Classical stationary points of an analytic Hamiltonian induce singularities\nof the density of quantum energy levels and their flow with a control parameter\nin the system's infinite-size limit. We show that for a system with $f$ degrees\nof freedom, a non-degenerate stationary point with index $r$ causes a\ndiscontinuity (for $r$ even) or divergence ($r$ odd) of the $(f-1)$ th\nderivative of both density and flow of the spectrum. An increase of flatness\nfor a degenerate stationary point shifts the singularity to lower derivatives.\nThe findings are verified in an $f=3$ toy model.\n", "  We discuss the nature of the low-frequency quadrupole vibrations from\nsmall-amplitude to large-amplitude regimes. We consider full five-dimensional\nquadrupole dynamics including three-dimensional rotations restoring the broken\nsymmetries as well as axially symmetric and asymmetric shape fluctuations.\nAssuming that the time-evolution of the self-consistent mean field is\ndetermined by five pairs of collective coordinates and collective momenta, we\nmicroscopically derive the collective Hamiltonian of Bohr and Mottelson, which\ndescribes low-frequency quadrupole dynamics. We show that the five-dimensional\ncollective Schr\\\"odinger equation is capable of describing large-amplitude\nquadrupole shape dynamics seen as shape coexistence/mixing phenomena. We\nsummarize the modern concepts of microscopic theory of large-amplitude\ncollective motion, which is underlying the microscopic derivation of the\nBohr-Mottelson collective Hamiltonian.\n", "  The sample of 37 485 suspected OB stars selected by Gontcharov (2008) from\nthe Tycho-2 catalogue has been cleaned of the stars that are not of spectral\ntypes OV--A0V. For this purpose, the apparent magnitude $V_T$ from Tycho-2, the\nabsolute magnitude $M_{V_T}$ calibrated as a function of the dereddened color\nindex $(B_T-V_T)_0$, the interstellar extinction $A_{V_T}$ calculated from the\n3D analytical model by Gontcharov (2009) as a function of the Galactic\ncoordinates, and the photometric distance $r_{ph}$ calculated as a function of\n$V_T$, $M_{V_T}$, and $A_{V_T}$ have been reconciled in an iterative process.\nThe 20 514 stars that passed the iterations have $(B_T-V_T)_0<0$ and\n$M_{V_T}>-5$ and are considered as a sample of OV--A0V stars complete within\n350 pc of the Sun. Based on the theoretical relation between the dereddened\ncolor and age of the stars, the derived sample has been divided into three\nsubsamples: $(B_T-V_T)_0<-0.2^m$, $-0.2^m<(B_T-V_T)_0<-0.1^m$, and\n$-0.1^m<(B_T-V_T)_0<0^m$, younger than 100, $100-200$, and $200-400$ Myr,\nrespectively. The spatial distribution of all 20 514 stars and the kinematics\nanalyzed for more than 1500 stars with radial velocities from the PCRV and RAVE\ncatalogues are different for the subsamples, showing smooth rotations, shears,\nand deformations of the layer of gas producing stars with the formation of the\nGould Belt, the Great Tunnel, the Local Bubble, and other structures within the\nlast 200 Myr. The detected temporal variations of the velocity dispersions,\nsolar motion components, Ogorodnikov--Milne model parameters, and Oort\nconstants are significant, agree with the results of other authors, and show\nthat it is meaningless to calculate the kinematic parameters for samples of\nstars with uncertain ages or with a wide range of ages.\n", "  In anticipation of abundant $B^*$ data samples at high-luminosity\nheavy-flavor experiments in the future, the tree-dominated semileptonic\n$\\bar{B}^*_{u,d,s} \\to P \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ $(P=D\\,,D_s\\,,\\pi\\,,K)$ decays\nare studied within the Standard Model. After a detailed calculation of the\nhelicity amplitudes, the theoretical predictions for branching fraction~(decay\nrate), lepton spin asymmetry, forward-backward asymmetry and ratio\n$R_D^{\\ast(L)}$ are firstly presented. It is found that the CKM-favored\n$\\bar{B}^* \\to D \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ decays have relatively large branching\nfractions of ${\\cal O}(10^{-9})$$\\sim$${\\cal O}(10^{-7})$, and are in the scope\nof running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB/Belle-II experiments.\n", "  It has been expected that astronomical observations to detect the orbital\nangular momenta of electromagnetic waves may give us a new insight into\nastrophysics. Previous works pointed out the possibility that a rotating black\nhole can produce orbital angular momenta of electromagnetic waves through\ngravitational scattering, and the spin parameter of the black hole can be\nmeasured by observing them. However, the mechanism how the orbital angular\nmomentum of the electromagnetic wave is generated by the gravitational\nscattering has not been clarified sufficiently. In this paper, in order to\nunderstand it from a point of view of gravitational lensing effects, we\nconsider an emitter which radiates a spherical wave of the real massless scalar\nfield and study the deformation of the scalar wave by the gravitational\nscattering due to a black hole by invoking the geometrical optics\napproximation. We show that the frame dragging caused by the rotating black\nhole is not a necessary condition for generating the orbital angular momentum\nof the scalar wave. However, its components parallel to the direction cosines\nof images appear only if the black hole is rotating.\n", "  We present SMPDF Web, a web interface for the construction of parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) with a minimal number of error sets needed to\nrepresent the PDF uncertainty of specific processes (SMPDF).\n", "  Lattice gauge theory was formulated by Kenneth Wilson in 1974. In the ensuing\ndecades, improvements in actions, algorithms, and computers have enabled\ntremendous progress in QCD, to the point where lattice calculations can yield\nsub-percent level precision for some quantities. Beyond QCD, lattice methods\nare being used to explore possible beyond the standard model (BSM) theories of\ndynamical symmetry breaking and supersymmetry. We survey progress in extracting\ninformation about the parameters of the standard model by confronting lattice\ncalculations with experimental results and searching for evidence of BSM\neffects.\n", "  We define a notion of stability for chiral ring of four dimensional N=1\ntheory by introducing test chiral rings and generalized a maximization. We\nconjecture that a chiral ring is the chiral ring of a superconformal field\ntheory if and only if it is stable. We then study N=1 field theory derived from\nD3 branes probing a three-fold singularity X, and show that the K stability\nwhich implies the existence of Ricci-flat conic metric on X is equivalent to\nthe stability of chiral ring of the corresponding field theory.\n", "  We assess independently the impact of high-temperature substrate annealing\nand metal deposition conditions on the coherence of transmon qubits in the\nstandard 2D circuit-QED architecture. We restrict our study to devices made\nwith aluminum interdigital capacitors on sapphire substrates. We record more\nthan an order-of-magnitude improvement in the relaxation time of devices made\nwith an annealed substrate, independent of whether a conventional evaporator or\nmolecular beam epitaxy chamber was used to deposit the aluminum. We also infer\nsimilar levels of flux noise and photon shot noise through dephasing\nmeasurements on these devices. Our results indicate that substrate annealing\nplays a primary role in fabricating low-loss qubits, consistent with the\nhypothesis that substrate-air and substrate-metal interfaces are essential\nfactors limiting the qubit lifetimes in superconducting circuits.\n", "  A forthcoming experiment of low-energy elastic electron proton scattering at\nthe new MESA facility in Mainz is planned to provide a high-precision\nmeasurement of the parity-violating polarisation asymmetry. This experiment is\nexpected to lead to a precision determination of the weak mixing angle,\ncompetitive with Z-pole data. We discuss the challenges for theory to derive\npredictions with the required accuracy.\n", "  Starting with a many-atom master equation of a kinetic, restricted\nsolid-on-solid (KRSOS) model with external material deposition, we investigate\nnonlinear aspects of the passage to a mesoscale description for a crystal\nsurface in 1+1 dimensions. This latter description focuses on the motion of an\natomic line defect (i.e. a step), which is defined via appropriate statistical\naverage over KRSOS microstates. Near thermodynamic equilibrium and for low\nenough supersaturation, we show that this mesoscale picture is reasonably\nfaithful to the Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) step-flow model. More specifically,\nwe invoke a maximum principle in conjunction with asymptotic error estimates to\nderive the elements of the BCF model: (i) a diffusion equation for the density\nof adsorbed adatoms; (ii) a step velocity law; and (iii) a linear relation for\nthe mass flux of adatoms at the step. In this vein, we also provide a criterion\nby which the adatom flux remains linear in supersaturation, suggesting a range\nof non-equilibrium conditions under which the BCF model remains valid. Lastly,\nwe make use of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to numerically study effects\nthat drive the system to higher supersaturations -- e.g. deposition of material\nonto the surface from above. Using these results, we describe empirical\ncorrections to the BCF model that amount to a nonlinear relation for the adatom\nflux at the step edge.\n", "  This article presents a comprehensive review of the Hydrodynamic Scaling\nModel for the dynamics of polymers in dilute and nondilute solutions. The\nHydrodynamic Scaling Model differs from some other treatments of non-dilute\npolymer solutions in that it takes polymer dynamics up to high concentrations\nto be dominated by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions, with chain\ncrossing constraints presumed to create at most secondary corrections. Many\nother models take the contrary stand, namely that chain crossing constraints\ndominate the dynamics of nondilute polymer solutions, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions only create secondary corrections. This article begins with a\nhistorical review. We then consider single-chain behavior, in particular the\nKirkwood-Riseman model; contradictions between the Kirkwood-Riseman and more\nfamiliar Rouse-Zimm models are emphasized. An extended Kirkwood-Riseman model\nthat gives interchain hydrodynamic interactions is developed and applied to\ngenerate pseudovirial series for the self-diffusion coefficient and the\nlow-shear viscosity. To extrapolate to large concentrations, rationales based\non self-similarity and on the Altenberger-Dahler Positive-Function\nRenormalization Group are developed and applied to the pseudovirial series for\n$D_{s}$ and $\\eta$. Based on the renormalization group method, a two-parameter\ntemporal scaling ansatz is invoked as a path to determining the frequency\ndependences of the storage and loss moduli. A short description is given for\neach of the individual papers that developed the Hydrodynamic Scaling Model.\nPhenomenological evidence supporting aspects of the model is noted. Finally,\ndirections for future development of the Hydrodynamic Scaling Model are\npresented.\n", "  This paper investigates the detection of communication outbreaks among a\nsmall team of actors in time-varying networks. We propose monitoring plans for\nknown and unknown teams based on generalizations of the exponentially weighted\nmoving average (EWMA) statistic. For unknown teams, we propose an efficient\nneighborhood-based search to estimate a collection of candidate teams. This\nprocedure dramatically reduces the computational complexity of an exhaustive\nsearch. Our procedure consists of two steps: communication counts between\nactors are first smoothed using a multivariate EWMA strategy. Densely connected\nteams are identified as candidates using a neighborhood search approach. These\ncandidate teams are then monitored using a surveillance plan derived from a\ngeneralized EWMA statistic. Monitoring plans are established for collaborative\nteams, teams with a dominant leader, as well as for global outbreaks. We\nconsider weighted heterogeneous dynamic networks, where the expected\ncommunication count between each pair of actors is potentially different across\npairs and time, as well as homogeneous networks, where the expected\ncommunication count is constant across time and actors. Our monitoring plans\nare evaluated on a test bed of simulated networks as well as on the U.S. Senate\nco-voting network, which models the Senate voting patterns from 1857 to 2015.\nOur analysis suggests that our surveillance strategies can efficiently detect\nrelevant and significant changes in dynamic networks.\n", "  We report the results of an experiment conducted near the High Flux Isotope\nReactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, designed to address the question of\nwhether a flux of reactor-generated electron antineutrinos can alter the rates\nof weak nuclear interaction-induced decays for Mn-54, Na-22, and Co-60. This\nexperiment, while quite sensitive, cannot exclude perturbations less than one\nor two parts in $10^4$ in $\\beta$ decay (or electron capture) processes, in the\npresence of an antineutrino flux of $3\\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The\npresent experimental methods are applicable to a wide range of isotopes.\nImproved sensitivity in future experiments may be possible if we can understand\nand reduce the dominant systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Observations revealed that various kinds of oscillations are excited in solar\nflare regions. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the flare emissions are\ncommonly observed in a wide range of wavelengths. Recent observations have\nfound that fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are quasi-periodically\nemitted from some flaring sites (quasi-periodic propagating fast-mode\nmagnetoacoustic waves; QPFs). Both of QPPs and QPFs imply a cyclic disturbance\noriginating from the flaring sites. However, the physical mechanisms remain\npuzzling. By performing a set of two-dimensional MHD simulations of a solar\nflare, we discovered the local oscillation above the loops filled with\nevaporated plasma (above-the-loop-top region) and the generation of QPFs from\nsuch oscillating regions. Unlike all previous models for QPFs, our model\nincludes essential physics for solar flares, such as magnetic reconnection,\nheat conduction, and chromospheric evaporation. We revealed that QPFs can be\nspontaneously excited by the above-the-loop-top oscillation. It was found that\nthis oscillation is controlled by the backflow of the reconnection outflow. The\nnew model revealed that flare loops and the above-the-loop-top region are full\nof shocks and waves, which is different from the previous expectations based on\na standard flare model and previous simulations. In this paper, we will show\nthe QPF generation process based on our new picture of flare loops and will\nbriefly discuss a possible relationship between QPFs and QPPs. Our findings\nwill change the current view of solar flares to a new view in which they are a\nvery dynamic phenomenon with full of shocks and waves.\n", "  We review the problem of describing the gravitational field of compact stars\nin general relativity. We focus on the deviations from spherical symmetry which\nare expected to be due to rotation and to the natural deformations of mass\ndistributions. We assume that the relativistic quadrupole moment takes into\naccount these deviations, and consider the class of axisymmetric static and\nstationary quadrupolar metrics which satisfy Einstein's equations in empty\nspace and in the presence of matter represented by a perfect fluid. We\nformulate the physical conditions that must be satisfied for a particular\nspacetime metric to describe the gravitational field of compact stars. We\npresent a brief review of the main static and axisymmetric exact solutions of\nEinstein's vacuum equations, satisfying all the physical conditions. We discuss\nhow to derive particular stationary and axisymmetric solutions with quadrupolar\nproperties by using the solution generating techniques which correspond either\nto Lie symmetries and B\\\"ackund transformations of the Ernst equations or to\nthe inverse scattering method applied to Einstein's equations. As for interior\nsolutions, we argue that it is necessary to apply alternative methods to obtain\nphysically meaningful solutions, and review a method which allows us to\ngenerate interior perfect-fluid solutions.\n", "  Two-photon absorption is an important non-linear process employed for high\nresolution bio-imaging and non-linear optics. In this work we realize\ntwo-photon excitation of a quantum emitter embedded in a two-dimensional\nmaterial. We examine defects in hexagonal boron nitride and show that the\nemitters exhibit similar spectral and quantum properties under one-photon and\ntwo-photon excitation. Furthermore, our findings are important to deploy\ntwo-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for quantum non-linear photonic\napplications.\n", "  Here I review the transverse momentum distributions of identified hadrons\nproduced in Au-Au collisions at RHIC and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC in the\nframework of recombination model. Minijets play an important role in generating\nshower partons in the intermediate $p_T$ region. At LHC, the resultant soft\nshower partons are even found to dominate over the thermal partons in the\nnon-strange sector. The azimuthal anisotropy of the produced hadrons could also\nbe explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets. Harmonic analysis\nof the $\\phi$ dependence leads to $v_n(p_T, b)$ that can be well produced\nwithout reference to flow.\n", "  In this paper, we mainly characterize the structure of product bases of the\ncomplex vector space\n  $\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. It gives an answer to the\nconjecture in case of $d=2n$ proposed by McNulty et al in 2016. As the\napplication of the result, we obtain all the product bases of a bipartite\nsystem $\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. It is helpful to review the\nstructure of all the product bases of $\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{2}$\nand $\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{3}$, which given by McNulty et al.\n", "  Recent space based observations of the Sun revealed that magnetic\nreconnection is ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere, ranging from small scale\nreconnection (observed as nanoflares) to large scale one (observed as long\nduration flares or giant arcades). Often the magnetic reconnection events are\nassociated with mass ejections or jets, which seem to be closely related to\nmultiple plasmoid ejections from fractal current sheet. The bursty radio and\nhard X-ray emissions from flares also suggest the fractal reconnection and\nassociated particle acceleration. We shall discuss recent observations and\ntheories related to the plasmoid-induced-reconnection and the fractal\nreconnection in solar flares, and their implication to reconnection physics and\nparticle acceleration. Recent findings of many superflares on solar type stars\nthat has extended the applicability of the fractal reconnection model of solar\nflares to much a wider parameter space suitable for stellar flares are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  This report summarises the physics opportunities for the study of Higgs\nbosons and the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking at the 100 TeV pp\ncollider.\n", "  Both negative magnetoresistance and nonlinear magnetoresisitance were\nobserved in silicon strip nuclear radiation detector in room temperature if we\napplied high magnetic field intensity in different direction. This result is\ndifferent with former report. We believe this is the result of coaction of high\nelectric field (Gunn effect) and high magnetic field, or because of the\nvariation of number of carriers and the carriers mobility. The weak\nlocalization and Landau energy levels also affect the magnetoresistance.\nDifferent crystal orientations have different energy band structures. Complex\nband structures lead complex carriers mobility plus Landau energy levels. So\nthe magnetoresisitance effect is anisotropy.\n", "  The two-step process of transfer followed by breakup is explored by measuring\na rather complete set of exclusive data for reaction channels populating states\nin the ejectile continua of the $^7$Li+$^{93}$Nb system at energies close to\nthe Coulomb barrier. The cross sections for $\\alpha+\\alpha$ events from one\nproton pickup were found to be smaller than those for $\\alpha+d$ events from\none neutron stripping and $\\alpha+t$ events from direct breakup of $^7$Li.\nCoupled channels Born approximation and continuum discretized coupled channels\ncalculations describe the data well and support the conclusion that the\n$\\alpha+d$ and $\\alpha+\\alpha$ events are produced by direct transfer to\nunbound states of the ejectile.\n", "  This research introduces a new drop fluidics, which uses a deformable and\nstretchable elastomeric film as the platform, instead of the commonly used\nrigid supports. Such a soft film impregnated with magnetic particles can be\nmodulated with an external electromagnetic field that produces a vast array of\ntopographical landscapes with varying surface curvature, which, in conjunction\nwith capillarity, can direct and control motion of water droplets efficiently\nand accurately. When a thin layer of oil is present on this film that is\ndeformed locally, a centrosymmetric wedge is formed. A water droplet placed on\nthis oil laden film becomes asymmetrically deformed thus producing a gradient\nof Laplace pressure within the droplet setting it to motion. A simple theory is\npresented that accounts for the droplet speed in terms of such geometric\nvariables as the volume of the droplet and the thickness of the oil film\ncovering the soft elastomeric film, as well as such material variables as the\nviscosity of the oil and interfacial tension of the oil-water interfaces.\nFollowing the verification of the theoretical result using well-controlled\nmodel systems, we demonstrate how the electromagnetically controlled\nelasto-capillary force can be used to manipulate the motion of single and/or\nmultiple droplets on the surface of the elastomeric film and how such\nelementary operations as drop fusion and thermally addressed chemical\ntransformation can be carried out in aqueous droplets. It is expected that the\nresulting drop fluidics would be suitable for digital control of drop motion by\nsimply switching on and off the electromagnetic fields applied at different\npositions underneath the elastomeric film. We anticipate that this method of\ndirecting and manipulating water droplets is poised for its applications in\nvarious biochemical reaction engineering, an example of which is Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR).\n", "  Topological states of matter are a source of low-energy quasiparticles, bound\nto a defect or propagating along the surface. In a superconductor these are\nMajorana fermions, described by a real rather than a complex wave function. The\nabsence of complex phase factors promises protection against decoherence in\nquantum computations based on topological superconductivity. This is a tutorial\nstyle introduction written for a Nature Physics focus issue on topological\nmatter.\n", "  The double slit experiment provides a classic example of both interference\nand the effect of observation in quantum physics. When particles are sent\nindividually through a pair of slits, a wave-like interference pattern\ndevelops, but no such interference is found when one observes which \"path\" the\nparticles take. We present a model of interference, dephasing, and\nmeasurement-induced decoherence in a one-dimensional version of the double-slit\nexperiment. Using this model, we demonstrate how the loss of interference in\nthe system is correlated with the information gain by the measuring\napparatus/observer. In doing so, we give a modern account of measurement in\nthis paradigmatic example of quantum physics that is accessible to students\ntaking quantum mechanics at the graduate or senior undergraduate levels.\n", "  Enhanced production of hadrons with $s$-quark content has been observed in\n$pp$ collisions at LHC, and earlier in collisions of heavy nuclei. We review\nthe string hadronisation formalism and correc- tions from rope hadronisation\nand colour reconnection, corrections that takes place in such dense\nenvironments, and are able to correctly describe data. Since such corrections\nare very sensitive to the modelling of transverse proton structure, we\ninvestigate two such models, and compare to final states. Finally we describe\nhow such corrections can also give a possible explanation to collective\nphenomena observed in small systems.\n", "  We summarize recent computations with a class of elliptic generalizations of\npolylogarithms, arising from the massive sunrise integral. For the case of\narbitrary masses we obtain results in two and four space-time dimensions. The\niterated integral structure of our functions allows us to furthermore compute\nthe equal mass case to arbitrary order.\n", "  An intrinsic local time in Geometrodynamics is obtained with using a scaled\nDirac's mapping. By addition of a background metric, one can construct a scalar\nfield. It is suitable to play a role of intrinsic time. Cauchy problem was\nsuccessfully solved in conformal variables because they are physical ones.\nFirst, the intrinsic time as a logarithm of determinant of spatial metric, was\napplied to a cosmological problem by Misner. A global time is exist under\ncondition of constant mean curvature slicing of spacetime. A volume of\nhypersurface and the so-called mean York's time are canonical conjugated pair.\nSo, the volume is the intrinsic global time by its sense. The experimentally\nobserved redshift in cosmology is the evidence of its existence. An intrinsic\ntime of homogeneous models is global. The Friedmann equation by its sense ties\ntime intervals. Exact solutions of the Friedmann equation in Standard cosmology\nwith standard and conformal units are presented. Theoretical curves\ninterpolated the Hubble diagram on latest supernovae are expressed in\nanalytical form. The class of functions in which the concordance model is\ndescribed is Weierstrass meromorphic functions. The Standard cosmological model\nis used for fitting the modern Hubble diagram. The physical interpretation of\nthe modern data from concept of conformal magnitudes is simpler, so is\npreferable.\n", "  A driven opto-RF oscillator, consisting of a dual-frequency laser (DFL)\nsubmitted to frequency-shifted feedback, is studied experimentally and\nnumerically in a chaotic regime. Precise control of the reinjection strength\nand detuning permits to isolate a parameter region of bounded-phase chaos,\nwhere the opto-RF oscillator is frequency-locked to the master oscillator, in\nspite of chaotic phase and intensity oscillations. Robust experimental evidence\nof this synchronization regime is found and phase noise spectra allows to\ncompare phase-locking and bounded-phase chaos regimes. In particular, it is\nfound that the long-term phase stability of the master oscillator is well\ntransferred to the opto-RF oscillator even in the chaotic regime.\n", "  We discuss whether the enhancement in the diphoton final state at $M_{\\gamma\n\\gamma}$ = 750 GeV, observed recently by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations could\nbe a neutral pseudoscalar technipion $\\tilde{\\pi}^0$. We considered two\ndistinct minimal models for the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. Here\nwe concentrate only on two-flavor vector-like technicolor model and we assume\nthat the two-photon fusion is a dominant production mechanism. We include\ncontributions of $2 \\to 1$, $2 \\to 2$ and $2 \\to 3$ partonic processes. All the\nmechanisms give similar contributions to the cross section. With the strong\nYukawa (technipion-techniquark) coupling $g_{TC} \\simeq 20$ we roughly obtain\nthe measured cross section of the \"signal\". With such value of $g_{TC}$ we get\na relatively small total decay width $\\Gamma_{\\rm tot}$. We discuss also the\nsize of the signal at lower energies (LHC, Tevatron) for $\\gamma \\gamma$ final\nstates, where the enhancement was not observed. We predict a measurable cross\nsection for neutral technipion production associated with one or two soft jets.\nThe technipion signal is compared with the Standard Model diphoton background\ncontributions. We observe the dominance of inelastic-inelastic $\\gamma \\gamma$\nprocesses. We predict the signal cross section for purely exclusive $p p \\to p\np \\gamma \\gamma$ procesess at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to be about 0.2 fb. Such a\ncross section would be, however, difficult to measure with the planned\nintegrated luminosity. We conclude that in all considered cases the signal is\nbelow the background or/and below the threshold set by statistics although some\ntension can be seen.\n", "  We consider a Dirac one-electron atom placed in a weak, static, uniform\nmagnetic field. We show that, to the first order in the strength B of the\nexternal field, the only electric multipole moments, which are induced by the\nperturbation in the atom, are those of an even order. Using the Sturmian\nexpansion of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb Green function [R. Szmytkowski, J.\nPhys. B 30, 825 (1997); 30, 2747(E) (1997)], we derive a closed-form expression\nfor the electric quadrupole moment induced in the atom in an arbitrary discrete\nenergy eigenstate. The result, which has the form of a double finite sum\ninvolving the generalized hypergeometric functions 3F2 of the unit argument,\nagrees with the earlier relativistic formula for that quantity, obtained by us\nfor the ground state of the atom.\n", "  In this letter we address the numeric inversion of optoacoustic signals to\ninitial stress profiles. Therefore we put under scrutiny the optoacoustic\nkernel reconstruction problem in the paraxial approximation of the underlying\nwave-equation. We apply a Fourier-series expansion of the optoacoustic Volterra\nkernel and obtain the respective expansion coefficients for a given\n\"apparative\" setup by performing a gauge procedure using synthetic input data.\nThe resulting effective kernel is subsequently used to solve the optoacoustic\nsource reconstruction problem for general signals. We verify the validity of\nthe proposed inversion protocol for synthetic signals and explore the\nfeasibility of our approach to also account for the diffraction transformation\nof signals beyond the paraxial approximation.\n", "  We present the results of numerical calculations of magnetizability ($\\chi$)\nof the relativistic one-electron atoms with a pointlike, spinless and\nmotionless nuclei of charge $Ze$. Exploiting the analytical formula for $\\chi$\nrecently derived by us [P. Stefa{\\'n}ska, 2015], valid for an arbitrary\ndiscrete energy eigenstate, we have found the values of the magnetizability for\nthe ground state and for the first and the second set of excited states (i.e.:\n$2s_{1/2}$, $2p_{1/2}$, $2p_{3/2}$, $3s_{1/2}$, $3p_{1/2}$, $3p_{3/2}$,\n$3d_{3/2}$, and $3d_{5/2}$) of the Dirac one-electron atom. The results for\nions with the atomic number $1 \\leqslant Z \\leqslant 137$ are given in 14\ntables. The comparison of the numerical values of magnetizabilities for the\nground state and for each states belonging to the first set of excited states\nof selected hydrogenlike ions, obtained with the use of two different values of\nthe fine-structure constant, i.e.: $\\alpha^{-1}=137.035 999 139$ (CODATA 2014)\nand $\\alpha^{-1}=137.035 999 074$ (CODATA 2010), is also presented.\n", "  We discuss diffractive production of heavy mesons at the LHC. The\ndifferential cross sections for single- and central-diffractive mechanisms for\n$c\\bar c$ pair production are calculated in the framework of the\nIngelman-Schlein model corrected for absorption effects. Here, leading-order\ngluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark anihilation partonic subprocesses are\ntaken into consideration. Both pomeron flux factors as well as parton\ndistributions in the pomeron are taken from the H1 Collaboration analysis of\ndiffractive structure function and diffractive dijets at HERA. The extra\ncorrections from subleading reggeon exchanges are also taken into\nconsideration. In addition to standard collinear approach, for the first time\nthe differential cross sections for the diffractive $c\\bar c$ pair production\nare calculated in the framework of the $k_t$-factorization approach, i.e.\neffectively including higher-order corrections. The unintegrated (transverse\nmomentum dependent) diffractive parton distributions in proton are calculated\nwith the help of the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription where collinear\ndiffractive PDFs are used as input. Some correlation observables, like\nazimuthal angle correlation between $c$ and $\\bar c$, and $c \\bar c$ pair\ntransverse momentum were obtained for the first time. The hadronization of\ncharm quarks is taken into account by means of fragmentation function\ntechnique.\n", "  A brief summary of the calculation of the NLO QCD corrections to the process\npp -> e+ ve mu- v_mu bb~ j + X is reported. This provides a complete\ndescription of the process of t-tbar + jet production with leptonic decays\nbeyond the narrow-width approximation. Off-shell effects for top quarks and W\nboson decays are fully taken into account, namely all resonant and non-resonant\ncontributions are included in the fixed-order calculation. Selected results for\ntotal and differential cross sections are shown for the case of the LHC Run I\nat the energy of 8 TeV.\n", "  We compare two different approaches used for calculating cross sections for\nthe two-photon $p p \\to l^+ l^- X$ process. In one of the approaches photon is\ntreated as a collinear parton in the proton. In the second approach a recently\nproposed $k_T$-factorization method is used. In this presentation we discuss\nsensitivity of the results to the choice of structure function parametrization\nand experimental cuts in the $k_T$-factorization approach. We compare results\nof our calculations with recent experimental data for dilepton production and\nfind that in most cases the contribution of the photon-photon mechanism is\nrather small. We discuss how to enhance the photon-photon contribution. We also\ncompare our results to those of recent measurements of exclusive and\nsemi-exclusive $e^+ e^-$ pair production with certain experimental data by the\nCMS collaboration.\n", "  Bilayers of graphitic materials have potential applications in field effect\ntransistors (FETs). A potential difference applied between certain ionic\nbilayers made from insulating graphitic materials such as BN, ZnO and AlN could\nreduce gap sizes, turning them into useful semiconductors. On the other hand,\nopening of a small semiconducting gap occurs in graphene bilayers under applied\nfield. The aim here is to investigate to what extent substrate induced\nelectron-phonon interactions (EPIs) modify this gap change. We examine EPIs in\nseveral lattice configurations, using a perturbative approach. The typical\neffect of EPIs on the ionic bilayers is an undesirable gap widening. The size\nof this gap change varies considerably with lattice structure and the magnitude\nof the bias. When bias is larger than the non-interacting gap size, EPIs have\nthe smallest effect on the bandgap, especially in configurations with\n$AA^{\\prime}$ and $AB$ structures. Thus careful selection of substrate, lattice\nconfiguration and bias strength to minimise the effects of EPIs could be\nimportant for optimising the properties of electronic devices. We use\nparameters related to BN in this article. In practice, the results presented\nhere are broadly applicable to other graphitic bilayers, and are likely to be\nqualitatively similar in metal dichalcogenide bilayers such as MoS$_2$, which\nare already of high interest for their use in FETs.\n", "  In a DC point-to-plane corona discharge reactor, the mono filamentary\nstreamers cross the inter electrode gap with a natural repetition frequency of\nsome tens of kHz. The discharge phase (including the primary and the secondary\nstreamers development) lasts only some hundred of nanoseconds while the\npost-discharge phases occurring between two successive discharge phases last\nsome tens of microseconds. From the point of view of chemical activation, the\ndischarge phases create radical and excited species located inside the very\nthin discharge filaments while during the post-discharge phases these radical\nand excited species induce a chemical kinetics that diffuse in a part of the\nreactor volume. From the point of view of hydrodynamics activation, the\ndischarge phases induce thermal shock waves and the storage of vibrational\nenergy which relaxes into thermal form only during the post-discharge phase.\nFurthermore, the glow corona discharges that persist during the post-discharge\nphases induce the so called electrical wind. In the present work, the\npost-discharge phase is simulated in a bi-dimensional geometry using the\ncommercial FLUENT software. The discharges effects (radical and excited species\ncreation and thermal relaxation) are involved through chemical and energy\nsource terms calculated from a complete 2Drz streamer model already developed.\n", "  We discuss charm meson-meson pair production recently observed by the LHCb\nCollaboration at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV in proton-proton scattering. We examine\ndouble-parton scattering (DPS) mechanisms of double $c \\bar c$ production and\nfollowing $cc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ hadronization as well as double $g$ and mixed $g\nc\\bar c $ production with $gg \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ and $gc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$\nhadronization calculated with the help of the scale-dependent KKKS08\nfragmentation functions. A new single-parton scattering (SPS) mechanism of $gg$\nproduction is also taken into consideration. Calculated differential\ndistributions as a function of transverse momentum $p_{T}$ of one of the\n$D^{0}$ mesons, pair invariant mass $M_{D^{0}D^{0}}$ and azimuthal angle\n$\\varphi_{D^{0}D^{0}}$ distributions are confronted with the measured ones. The\nmanifestation of the new SPS mechanisms with $g \\to D^{0}$ fragmentation within\nthe scale-dependent fragmentation scheme change the overall picture suitable\nfor standard scale-independent fragmentation where only DPS $cc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$\nmechanism is present. Some consequences of the new mechanisms are discussed\n", "  We study the chiral de Rham complex (CDR) over a manifold $M$ with holonomy\n$\\rm G_2$. We prove that the vertex algebra of global sections of the CDR\nassociated to $M$ contains two commuting copies of the Shatashvili-Vafa $\\rm\nG_2$ superconformal algebra. Our proof is a tour de force, based on explicit\ncomputations.\n", "  Nuclear Clusters (NCs) are common stellar systems in the centres of galaxies.\nYet, the physical mechanisms involved in their formation are still debated.\nUsing a parsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we\npropose an updated formation scenario for NCs. In this 'wet migration\nscenario', a massive star cluster forms in the gas-rich disc, keeping a gas\nreservoir, and growing further while it migrates to the centre via a\ncombination of interactions with other substructures and dynamical friction. A\nwet merger with another dense cluster and its own gas reservoir can occur,\nalthough this is not a pre-requisite for the actual formation of the NC. The\nmerging process does significantly alter the properties of the NC (mass,\nmorphology, star formation history), also quenching the on-going local star\nformation activity, thus leading to interesting observational diagnostics for\nthe physical origin of NCs. A population of lower mass clusters co-exist during\nthe simulation, but these are either destroyed via tidal forces, or have high\nangular momentum preventing them to interact with the NC and contribute to its\ngrowth. The proposed updated scenario emphasises the role of gas reservoirs\nassociated with the densest star clusters formed in a gas-rich low-mass galaxy.\n", "  The LBNF/DUNE CDR describes the proposed physics program and experimental\ndesign at the conceptual design phase. Volume 2, entitled The Physics Program\nfor DUNE at LBNF, outlines the scientific objectives and describes the physics\nstudies that the DUNE collaboration will perform to address these objectives.\nThe long-baseline physics sensitivity calculations presented in the DUNE CDR\nrely upon simulation of the neutrino beam line, simulation of neutrino\ninteractions in the far detector, and a parameterized analysis of detector\nperformance and systematic uncertainty. The purpose of this posting is to\nprovide the results of these simulations to the community to facilitate\nphenomenological studies of long-baseline oscillation at LBNF/DUNE.\nAdditionally, this posting includes GDML of the DUNE single-phase far detector\nfor use in simulations. DUNE welcomes those interested in performing this work\nas members of the collaboration, but also recognizes the benefit of making\nthese configurations readily available to the wider community.\n", "  The decay rate of neutrinoless double beta decay could be dominated by\nshort-range diagrams involving heavy scalar particles (\"topology-II\" diagrams).\nExamples are diagrams with diquarks, leptoquarks or charged scalars. Here, we\ncompare the discovery potential for lepton number violating signals at the LHC\nwith constraints from dijet and leptoquark searches and the sensitivity of\ndouble beta decay experiments, using three example models. We note that already\nwith 20/fb the LHC will test interesting parts of the parameter space of these\nmodels, not excluded by current limits on double beta decay.\n", "  New high-precision measurements of the longitudinal magnetic field of Ap\nstars suggest the existence of secular intrinsic variations of the global\nmagnetic field in some stars. We argue that such changes are apparent in the Ap\nstar $\\alpha^2$ CVn in the time scale of $\\sim$ 10 years, which results from\nthe analysis of literature data. Therefore, such an observation implies, that\nthe rate of magnetic field evolution of Ap stars is much higher than was\npreviously thought.\n", "  A physical theory of the world is presented under the unifying principle that\nall of nature is laid out before us and experienced through the passage of\ntime. The one-dimensional progression in time is opened out into a\nmulti-dimensional mathematically consistent flow, with the simplicity of the\nformer giving rise to symmetries of the latter. The act of perception\nidentifies an extended spacetime arena of intermediate dimension, incorporating\nthe symmetry of geometric spatial rotations, against which physical objects are\nformed and observed. The spacetime symmetry is contained as a subgroup of, and\nprovides a natural breaking mechanism for, the higher general symmetry of time.\nIt will be described how the world of gravitation and cosmology, as well as\nquantum theory and particle physics, arises from these considerations.\n", "  We study the path integral solution of a system of particle moving in certain\nclass of PT symmetric non-Hermitian and non-central potential. The Hamil-\ntonian of the system is converted to a separable Hamiltonian of Liouville type\nin parabolic coordinates and is further mapped into a Hamiltonian corresponding\nto two 2-dimensional simple harmonic oscillators (SHOs). Thus the explicit\nGreen's functions for a general non-central PT symmetric non hermitian\npotential are cal- culated in terms of that of 2d SHOs. The entire spectrum for\nthis three dimensional system is shown to be always real leading to the fact\nthat the system remains in unbroken PT phase all the time.\n", "  We discuss the common features between the Standard Model taxonomy of\nparticles, based on electric charge, strangeness and isospin, and the taxonomy\nemerging from the key structural elements of the rotating neutrino model, which\ndescribes baryons as bound states formed by three highly relativistic\nelectrically polarized neutrinos forming a symmetric ring rotating around a\ncentral electrically charged or polarized lepton. It is shown that the two\ntaxonomies are fully compatible with each other.\n", "  As experimental particle physics becomes more and more precise, it is\nbecoming increasingly important for Monte Carlo simulations to improve the\nprecision of their predictions. In terms of the hard matrix element, this means\ncalculating to a higher order in perturbation theory. To be consistent this\nrequires both NNLO QCD corrections and NLO EW corrections to be included. There\nare also interference effects between these processes that are not simple to\nhandle consistently. For a broad description of the behaviour of NLO EW\ncorrections at high energies, the Sudakov logarithmic approach provides a good\napproximation, and is much less computationally expensive than the full\ncalculation. The implementation of EW Sudakov logarithms within the SHERPA\nprogram are outlined here along with some initial results. As well as this, an\noverview of the status of full NLO EW computations with SHERPA is presented.\n", "  It has been proposed recently that the SKA1-MID could be used to conduct an\nHI intensity mapping survey that could rival upcoming Stage IV dark energy\nsurveys. However, measuring the weak HI signal is expected to be very\nchallenging due to contaminations such as residual Galactic emission, RFI, and\ninstrumental 1/f noise. Modelling the effects of these contaminants on the\ncosmological HI signal requires numerical end-to-end simulations. Here we\npresent how 1/f noise within the receiver can double the effective uncertainty\nof an SKA-like survey to HI on large angular scales (l < 50).\n", "  The nuclear electric dipole moment is a very sensitive probe of CP violation\nbeyond the standard model, and for light nuclei, it can be evaluated accurately\nusing the few-body calculational methods. In this talk, we present the result\nof the evaluation of the electric dipole moment of 3-body and 4-body systems\nusing the Gaussian expansion method in the ab initio approach and in the\ncluster model. We also give the future prospects for the discovery of new\nphysics beyond it within the sensitivity of prepared experiments.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are dominated by dark matter, and may have a larger\nproportion of surviving substructure than, e.g, field galaxies. Due to the\npresence of galaxy clusters in relative proximity and their high dark matter\ncontent, they are promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter\nvia Gamma-rays. Indeed, dedicated studies of sets of up to 100 clusters have\nbeen made previously, so far with no clear indication of a dark matter signal.\nHere we report on Gamma-ray observations of some 26,000 galaxy clusters based\non Pass-7 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, with clusters selected from\nthe Tully 2MASS Groups catalog. None of these clusters is significantly\ndetected in Gamma-rays, and we present Gamma-ray flux upper limits between 20\nGeV and 500 GeV.\n  We estimate the dark matter content of each of the clusters in these\ncatalogs, and constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section, by\nanalyzing Fermi-LAT data from the directions of the clusters. We set some of\nthe tightest cluster-based constraints to date on the annihilation of dark\nmatter particles with masses between 20 GeV and 500 GeV for annihilation to a\ngamma-ray line. Our cluster based constraints are not yet as strong as bounds\nplaced using the Galactic Center, although an uncertainty still exists\nregarding the \"boost factor\" from cluster substructure, where we have chosen a\nrather conservative value. Our analysis, given this choice of possible boost,\nis not yet sensitive enough to fully rule out typical realistic DM candidates,\nespecially if the gamma-ray line is not a dominant annihilation mode.\n", "  We have obtained intermediate-resolution optical spectroscopy of 44 candidate\nvery low mass members of the nearby young open cluster IC2391. Of these, 26\nspectra are totally new, 14 were already analyzed in a previous paper and\nanother four are in common.\n  These spectra, taken at the Cerro Tololo 4-meter and Magellan I and II\ntelescopes, allow us to confirm 33 of them as likely cluster members, based on\ntheir spectral types, presence of Li, and Halpha emission. Among these new\ncluster members is CTIO-160 (M7), the first IC2391 candidate to satisfy all\ncriteria for being a substellar member of the cluster, including detection of\nthe Li 6708A doublet. With the enlarged membership, we are able to locate the\nlithium depletion boundary of the cluster more reliably than in the past. Based\non comparison to several theoretical models, we derive an age of 50+-5 Myr for\nIC2391. We also estimate new ages for the Alpha Per and Pleiades clusters; our\nages are 85+-10 Myr and 130+-20 Myr, respectively. We derive an estimate of the\ninitial mass function of IC2391 that extends to below the substellar limit, and\ncompare it to those of other well-studied young open clusters. The index of the\npower law mass function for IC2391 is alpha=0.96+-0.12, valid in the range 0.5\nto 0.072 M(sun).\n", "  We have estimated the age of the young moving group TW Hydrae Association, a\ncohort of a few dozen stars and brown dwarfs located near the Sun which share\nthe same kinematic properties and, presumably, the same origin and age. The\nchronology has been determined by analyzing different properties (magnitudes,\ncolors, activity, lithium) of its members and comparing them with several\nwell-known star forming regions and open clusters, as well as theoretical\nmodels. In addition, by using medium-resolution optical spectra of two M8\nmembers of the association (2M1139 and 2M1207 -an accreting brown dwarf with a\nplanetary mass companion), we have derived spectral types and measured H(alpha)\nand lithium equivalent widths. We have also estimated their effective\ntemperature and gravity, which were used to produce an independent age\nestimation for these two brown dwarfs. We have also collected spectra of\n2M1315, a candidate member with a L5 spectral type and measured its H(alpha)\nequivalent width. Our age estimate for the association, 10 Myr (in the range\n3-20 Myr), agrees with previous values cited in the literature. In the case of\nthe two brown dwarfs, we have derived an age of 15 Myr (in the range 5-30 Myr),\nwhich also agree with our estimate for the whole group. We compared our results\nwith recent articles published on the same subject using other techniques, and\ndiscuss the limits of the age-dating techniques.\n", "  Low-momentum excitations of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate behave as\nphonons and move at a finite velocity v_s. Yet the atoms making up the phonon\nexcitation each move very slowly; v_a = p/m --> 0. A simple \"cartoon picture\"\nis suggested to understand this phenomenon intuitively. It implies a relation\nv_s/v_a = N_ex, where N_ex is the number of excited atoms making up the phonon.\nThis relation does indeed follow from the standard Bogoliubov theory.\n", "  Predictions for (phi^4)_4 theory from renormalization-group-improved\nperturbation theory, as formulated by Luescher and Weisz, are compared to\npublished (and some unpublished) data from lattice Monte-Carlo simulations of\nthe 4-dimensional Ising model. Good agreement is found in all but one\nrespect:-- the change in the wavefunction-renormalization constant Z_R across\nthe phase transition is significantly greater than predicted. A related\nobservation is that propagator data in the broken phase show deviations from\nfree-propagator form -- deviations that become larger, not smaller, closer to\nthe continuum limit. More data closer to the critical point are needed to\nclarify the situation.\n", "  Hydrodynamics is the appropriate \"effective theory\" for describing any fluid\nmedium at sufficiently long length scales. This paper treats the vacuum as such\na medium and derives the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. Unlike a normal\nmedium the vacuum has no linear sound-wave regime; disturbances always\n\"propagate\" nonlinearly. For an \"empty vacuum\" the hydrodynamic equations are\nfamiliar ones (shallow water-wave equations) and they describe an\nexperimentally observed phenomenon -- the spreading of a clump of\nzero-temperature atoms into empty space. The \"Higgs vacuum\" case is much\nstranger; pressure and energy density, and hence time and space, exchange\nroles. The speed of sound is formally infinite, rather than zero as in the\nempty vacuum. Higher-derivative corrections to the vacuum hydrodynamic\nequations are also considered. In the empty-vacuum case the corrections are of\nquantum origin and the post-hydrodynamic description corresponds to the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. I conjecture the form of the post-hydrodynamic\ncorrections in the Higgs case. In the 1+1-dimensional case the equations\npossess remarkable `soliton' solutions and appear to constitute a new exactly\nintegrable system.\n", "  We discuss the phase transition in 3+1 dimensional lambda Phi^4 theory from a\nvery physical perspective. The particles of the symmetric phase (`phions')\ninteract via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3\nattraction. If the phion mass is sufficiently small, the lowest-energy state is\nnot the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of\nphions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate\ncorresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and\nits excitations (\"phonons\" in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs\nparticles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is\nstill positive; it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes\nnegative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than\nthe Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality;' all\nscattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate\nbecomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum\nlimit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An\nintricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises. We speculate about the\npossible implications of these ideas for gravity and inflation.\n"]}
