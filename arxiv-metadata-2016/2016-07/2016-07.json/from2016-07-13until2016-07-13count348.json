"abstract": ["  Establishing the fundamental limit of nanophotonic light-trapping schemes is\nof paramount importance and is becoming increasingly urgent for current solar\ncell research. The standard theory of light trapping demonstrated that\nabsorption enhancement in a medium cannot exceed a factor of 4n^2/\nsin^2(\\theta), where n is the refractive index of the active layer, and \\theta\nis the angle of the emission cone in the medium surrounding the cell. This\ntheory, however, is not applicable in the nanophotonic regime. Here we develop\na statistical temporal coupled-mode theory of light trapping based on a\nrigorous electromagnetic approach. Our theory reveals that the standard limit\ncan be substantially surpassed when optical modes in the active layer are\nconfined to deep-subwavelength scale, opening new avenues for highly efficient\nnext-generation solar cells.\n", "  A moire pattern is formed when two copies of a periodic pattern are overlaid\nwith a relative twist. We address the electronic structure of a twisted\ntwo-layer graphene system, showing that in its continuum Dirac model the moire\npattern periodicity leads to moire Bloch bands. The two layers become more\nstrongly coupled and the Dirac velocity crosses zero several times as the twist\nangle is reduced. For a discrete set of magic angles the velocity vanishes, the\nlowest moire band flattens, and the Dirac-point density-of-states and the\ncounterflow conductivity are strongly enhanced.\n", "  We present a comparative study of high carrier density transport in mono-,\nbi-, and trilayer graphene using electric-double-layer transistors to\ncontinuously tune the carrier density up to values exceeding 10^{14} cm^{-2}.\nWhereas in monolayer the conductivity saturates, in bi- and trilayer flling of\nthe higher energy bands is observed to cause a non-monotonic behavior of the\nconductivity, and a large increase in the quantum capacitance. These systematic\ntrends not only show how the intrinsic high-density transport properties of\ngraphene can be accessed by field-effect, but also demonstrate the robustness\nof ion-gated graphene, which is crucial for possible future applications.\n", "  In this paper we establish relationships between four important concepts: (a)\nhitting time problems of Brownian motion, (b) 3-dimensional Bessel bridges, (c)\nSchr\\\"odinger's equation with linear potential, and (d) heat equation problems\nwith moving boundary. We relate (a) and (b) by means of Girsanov's theorem,\nwhich suggests a strategy to extend our ideas to problems in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and\ngeneral diffusions. This approach also leads to (c) because we may relate,\nthrough a Feynman-Kac representation, functionals of a Bessel bridge with two\nSchr\\\"odinger-type problems. In particular, we also find a fundamental solution\nto a class of parabolic partial differential equations with linear potential.\nFinally, the relationship between (c) and (d) suggests a possible link between\nGeneralized Airy processes and their hitting times.\n", "  Adding a non-adsorbing polymer to passive colloids induces an attraction\nbetween the particles via the `depletion' mechanism. High enough polymer\nconcentrations lead to phase separation. We combine experiments, theory and\nsimulations to demonstrate that using active colloids (such as motile bacteria)\ndramatically changes the physics of such mixtures. First, significantly\nstronger inter-particle attraction is needed to cause phase separation.\nSecondly, the finite size aggregates formed at lower inter-particle attraction\nshow unidirectional rotation. These micro-rotors demonstrate the self assembly\nof functional structures using active particles. The angular speed of the\nrotating clusters scales approximately as the inverse of their size, which may\nbe understood theoretically by assuming that the torques exerted by the\noutermost bacteria in a cluster add up randomly. Our simulations suggest that\nboth the suppression of phase separation and the self assembly of rotors are\ngeneric features of aggregating swimmers, and should therefore occur in a\nvariety of biological and synthetic active particle systems.\n", "  Real physical systems with reflective and rotational symmetries such as\nviruses, fullerenes and quasicrystals have recently been modeled successfully\nin terms of three-dimensional (affine) Coxeter groups. Motivated by this\nprogress, we explore here the benefits of performing the relevant computations\nin a Geometric Algebra framework, which is particularly suited to describing\nreflections. Starting from the Coxeter generators of the reflections, we\ndescribe how the relevant chiral (rotational), full (Coxeter) and binary\npolyhedral groups can be easily generated and treated in a unified way in a\nversor formalism. In particular, this yields a simple construction of the\nbinary polyhedral groups as discrete spinor groups. These in turn are known to\ngenerate Lie and Coxeter groups in dimension four, notably the exceptional\ngroups D_4, F_4 and H_4. A Clifford algebra approach thus reveals an unexpected\nconnection between Coxeter groups of ranks 3 and 4. We discuss how to extend\nthese considerations and computations to the Conformal Geometric Algebra setup,\nin particular for the non-crystallographic groups, and construct root systems\nand quasicrystalline point arrays. We finally show how a Clifford versor\nframework sheds light on the geometry of the Coxeter element and the Coxeter\nplane for the examples of the two-dimensional non-crystallographic Coxeter\ngroups I_2(n) and the three-dimensional groups A_3, B_3, as well as the\nicosahedral group H_3.\n", "  The sum of entropic uncertainties for the measurement of two non-commuting\nobservables is not always reduced by the amount of entanglement (quantum\nmemory) between two parties, and in certain cases may be impacted by quantum\ncorrelations beyond entanglement (discord). An optimal lower bound of entropic\nuncertainty in the presence of any correlations may be determined by\nfine-graining. Here we express the uncertainty relation in a new form where the\nmaximum possible reduction of uncertainty is shown to be given by the\nextractable classical information. We show that the lower bound of uncertainty\nmatches with that using fine-graining for several examples of two-qubit pure\nand mixed entangled states, and also separable states with non-vanishing\ndiscord.\n  Using our uncertainty relation we further show that even in the absence of\nany quantum correlations between the two parties, the sum of uncertainties may\nbe reduced with the help of classical correlations.\n", "  We apply a spin-projection method to calculate microscopically the level\ndensities of a family of nickel isotopes $^{59-64}$Ni using the shell model\nMonte Carlo approach in the complete $pfg_{9/2}$ shell. Accurate ground-state\nenergies of the odd-mass nickel isotopes, required for the determination of\nexcitation energies, are determined using the Green's function method recently\nintroduced to circumvent the odd particle-number sign problem. Our results are\nin excellent agreement with recent measurements based on proton evaporation\nspectra and with level counting data at low excitation energies. We also\ncompare our results with neutron resonance data, assuming equilibration of\nparity and a spin-cutoff model for the spin distribution at the neutron binding\nenergy, and find good agreement with the exception of $^{63}$Ni.\n", "  We calculate the triangular flow parameter $v_3$ of thermal photons from an\nevent-by-event ideal hydrodynamic model for $0--40\\%$ central collisions of Pb\nnuclei at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV at LHC. $v_3$ determined with respect to the\nparticipant plane (PP) is found to be non-zero, positive and its $p_T$\ndependence is qualitatively similar to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$(PP) of\nthermal photons in the range $1 \\le p_T \\le 6$ GeV/$c$. In the range $p_T \\,\n\\le $ 3 GeV/$c$, $v_3$(PP) is found to be about $50--75\\%$ of $v_2$(PP) and for\n$p_T \\, >$ 3 GeV/$c$ the two anisotropy parameters become comparable. The local\nfluctuations in the initial density distribution as well as the initial global\ngeometry of the produced matter in the event-by-event hydrodynamic framework\nare responsible for this substantial value of $v_3({\\rm PP})$. However, as\nexpected, the triangular flow parameter calculated with respect to the reaction\nplane $v_3$(RP) is found to be close to zero. We show that $v_3$(PP) strongly\ndepends on the value of the fluctuation size scale $\\sigma$ especially in the\nhigher $p_T \\, (\\ge 3 {\\rm GeV}/c)$ region where a larger value of $\\sigma$\nresults in a smaller $v_3({\\rm PP})$. In addition, the $v_3{\\rm (PP)}$ is found\nto increase with the assumed formation time of the thermalized system.\n", "  We apply here the principle of affine symmetry to the nested fullerene cages\n(carbon onions) that arise in the context of carbon chemistry. Previous work on\naffine extensions of the icosahedral group has revealed a new organisational\nprinciple in virus structure and assembly. We adapt this group theoretic\nframework here to the physical requirements dictated by carbon chemistry, and\nshow that we can derive mathematical models for carbon onions within this\naffine symmetry approach. This suggests the applicability of affine symmetry in\na wider context in Nature, as well as offering a novel perspective on the\ngeometric principles underpinning carbon chemistry.\n", "  N-flation is a radiatively stable scenario for chaotic inflation in which the\ndisplacements of $N \\gg 1$ axions with decay constants $f_1 \\le \\ldots \\le f_N\n< M_P$ lead to a super-Planckian effective displacement equal to the\nPythagorean sum $f_{Py}$ of the $f_i$. We show that mixing in the axion kinetic\nterm generically leads to the phenomenon of kinetic alignment, allowing for\neffective displacements as large as $\\sqrt{N} f_{N} \\ge f_{Py}$, even if $f_1,\n\\ldots, f_{N-1}$ are arbitrarily small. At the level of kinematics, the\nnecessary alignment occurs with very high probability, because of eigenvector\ndelocalization. We present conditions under which inflation can take place\nalong an aligned direction. Our construction sharply reduces the challenge of\nrealizing N-flation in string theory.\n", "  The driving force behind the origin and evolution of life has been the\nthermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of the biosphere\nthrough increasing the global solar photon dissipation rate. In the upper\natmosphere of today, oxygen and ozone derived from life processes are\nperforming the short wavelength UVC and UVB dissipation. On Earth's surface,\nwater and organic pigments in water facilitate the near UV and visible photon\ndissipation. The first organic pigments probably formed, absorbed, and\ndissipated at those photochemically active wavelengths in the UVC that could\nhave reached Earth's surface during the Archean. Proliferation of these\npigments can be understood as an autocatalytic photochemical process obeying\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamic directives related to increasing solar photon\ndissipation rate. Under these directives, organic pigments would have evolved\nover time to increase the global photon dissipation rate by; 1) increasing the\nratio of their effective photon cross sections to their physical size, 2)\ndecreasing their electronic excited state life times, 3) quenching\nnon-radiative de-excitation channels (e.g. fluorescence), 4) covering ever more\ncompletely the solar spectrum, and 5) dispersing into an ever greater surface\narea of Earth. From knowledge of the evolution of the spectrum of G-type stars,\nand considering the most probable history of the transparency of Earths\natmosphere, we construct the most probable surface solar spectrum as a function\nof time and compare this with the history of molecular absorption maxima\nobtained from the available data in the literature. This comparison supports\nthe thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life, constrains models\nfor Earth's early atmosphere, and sheds some new light on the origin of\nphotosynthesis.\n", "  Empirical studies are inconclusive about the underlying mechanisms that shape\nthe interrelated dynamics of opinions and interpersonal attraction. There is\nstrong evidence that others whom are liked have a positive influence on\nopinions and similarities induce attraction (homophily). We know less about\n\"negative\" mechanisms concerning whether disliked others induce shifts away\nfrom consensus (negative influence), whether large differences (dissimilarity)\ngenerate distancing, and whether dissimilarities induce disliking\n(heterophobia). This study tests discriminating hypotheses about the presence\nof positive and negative mechanisms in controlled experiments involving dyadic\ninteractions. Results confirm the presence of homophily, do not support the\nexistence of negative social influence, and show a robust positive linear\nrelationship between opinion distance and opinion shifts. This implies that\ncontact might provide the largest push towards consensus in case of large\ninitial differences.\n", "  The use of Slater-type spinor orbitals in algebraic solution of the Dirac\nequation is investigated. The one- and two-center integrals constitute the\nmatrix elements arising in generalized eigenvalue equation for one-electron\natoms and molecules are evaluated over Slater-type spinor orbitals via\nellipsoidal coordinates. These integrals are calculated through numerical\nglobal-adaptive method with Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration extension. The\ncalculations are performed for electronic structure of ground and excited\nstates of one-electron atoms and diatomic molecules. The screening constants\nare allowed to be variationally optimum values for given nuclear separation.\nThe obtained results are compaired with the results those found in the\nliterature. The procedures discussed in this work are capable of yielding\nhighly accurate relativistic two-center one-electron integrals for all ranges\nof orbital parameters. Besides provides an efficient way to overcome the\nproblems that arise in relativistic calculations.\n", "  Starting with the well-defined product of quantum fields at two spacetime\npoints, we explore an associated Poisson structure for classical field theories\nwithin the deformation quantization formalism. We realize that the induced\nstar-product is naturally related to the standard Moyal product through an\nappropriate causal Green's functions connecting points in the space of\nclassical solutions to the equations of motion. Our results resemble the\nPeierls-DeWitt bracket analyzed in the multisymplectic context. Once our\nstar-product is defined we are able to apply the Wigner-Weyl map in order to\nintroduce a generalized version of Wick's theorem. Finally, we include some\nexamples to explicitly test our method: the real scalar field, the bosonic\nstring and a physically motivated nonlinear particle model. For the field\ntheoretic models we have encountered causal generalizations of the\ncreation/annihilation relations, and also a causal generalization of the\nVirasoro algebra for the bosonic string. For the nonlinear particle case, we\nuse the approximate solution in terms of the Green's function in order to\nconstruct a well-behaved causal bracket.\n", "  Empirical data on the dynamics of human face-to-face interactions across a\nvariety of social venues have recently revealed a number of context-independent\nstructural and temporal properties of human contact networks. This universality\nsuggests that some basic mechanisms may be responsible for the unfolding of\nhuman interactions in the physical space. Here we discuss a simple model that\nreproduces the empirical distributions for the individual, group and collective\ndynamics of face-to-face contact networks. The model describes agents that move\nrandomly in a two-dimensional space and tend to stop when meeting \"attractive\"\npeers, and reproduces accurately the empirical distributions.\n", "  We identify, through a change of variables, solution operators for evolution\nequations with generators given by certain simple first-order differential\noperators acting on Fock spaces. This analysis applies, through unitary\nequivalence, to a broad class of supersymmetric quadratic\nmultiplication-differentiation operators acting on $L^2(\\Bbb{R}^n)$ which\nincludes the elliptic and weakly elliptic quadratic operators. We demonstrate a\nvariety of sharp results on boundedness, decay, and return to equilibrium for\nthese solution operators, connecting the short-time behavior with the range of\nthe symbol and the long-time behavior with the eigenvalues of their generators.\nThis is particularly striking when it allows for the definition of solution\noperators which are compact and regularizing for large times for certain\noperators whose spectrum is the entire complex plane.\n", "  Precisely characterizing and controlling realistic open quantum systems is\none of the most challenging and exciting frontiers in quantum sciences and\ntechnologies. In this Letter, we present methods of approximately computing\nreachable sets for coherently controlled dissipative systems, which is very\nuseful for assessing control performances. We apply this to a two-qubit nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spin system and implement some tasks of quantum control in\nopen systems at a near optimal performance in view of purity: e.g., increasing\npolarization and preparing pseudo-pure states. Our work shows interesting and\npromising applications of environment-assisted quantum dynamics.\n", "  The local moment approach (LMA) has presented itself as a powerful\nsemi-analytical quantum impurity solver (QIS) in the context of the dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT) for the periodic Anderson model and it correctly\ncaptures the low energy Kondo scale for the single impurity model, having\nexcellent agreement with the Bethe ansatz and numerical renormalization group\nresults. However, the most common correlated lattice model, the Hubbard model,\nhas not been explored well within the LMA+DMFT framework beyond the insulating\nphase. Here in our work, within the framework we attempt to complete the phase\ndiagram of the single band Hubbard model at zero temperature. Our formalism is\ngeneric to any particle filling and can be extended to finite temperature. We\ncontrast our results with another QIS, namely the iterated perturbation theory\n(IPT) and show that the second spectral moment sum-rule improves better as the\nHubbard interaction strength grows stronger in LMA, whereas it severely breaks\ndown after the Mott transition in IPT. We also show that, in the metallic\nphase, the low-energy scaling of the spectral density leads to universality\nwhich extends to infinite frequency range at infinite correlation strength\n(strong-coupling). At large interaction strength, the off half-filling spectral\ndensity forms a pseudogap near the Fermi level and filling-controlled Mott\ntransition occurs as one approaches the half-filling. Finally we study optical\nproperties and find universal features such as absorption peak position\ngoverned by the low-energy scale and a doping independent crossing point, often\ndubbed as the \"isosbestic point\" in experiments.\n", "  We give a non-perturbative construction of the fermionic projector in\nMinkowski space coupled to a time-dependent external potential which is smooth\nand decays faster than quadratically for large times. The weak and strong mass\noscillation properties are proven. We show that the integral kernel of the\nfermionic projector is of Hadamard form, provided that the time integral of the\nspatial sup-norm of the potential satisfies a suitable bound. This gives rise\nto an algebraic quantum field theory of Dirac fields in an external potential\nwith a distinguished pure quasi-free Hadamard state.\n", "  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a key pathway for transporting cargo\ninto cells via membrane vesicles. It plays an integral role in nutrient import,\nsignal transduction, neurotransmission and cellular entry of pathogens and\ndrug-carrying nanoparticles. As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the\nplasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending\nand hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension\nconditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this\nstudy, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide\nfundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,\nnamely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane\ntension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through\ninstability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination\nto a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR\nproteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we\npresent a new counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the\nshape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins,\nsupported by actin-BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing\nof vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a new\nstress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the\nshapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through\ntransition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the\nintriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into\ndetached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.\n", "  Entanglement polytopes result in finitely many types of entanglement that can\nbe detected by only measuring single-particle spectra. With high probability,\nhowever, the local spectra lie in more than one polytope, hence providing no\ninformation about the entanglement type. To overcome this problem, we propose\nto additionally use local filters. We experimentally demonstrate the detection\nof entanglement polytopes in a four-qubit system. Using local filters we can\ndistinguish the entanglement type of states with the same single particle\nspectra, but which belong to different polytopes.\n", "  Quasi-periodic Schr\\\"odinger-type operators naturally arise in solid state\nphysics, describing the influence of an external magnetic field on the\nelectrons of a crystal. In the late 1970s, numerical studies for the most\nprominent model, the almost Mathieu operator (AMO), produced the first example\nof a fractal in physics known as \"Hofstadter's butterfly,\" marking the starting\npoint for the ongoing strong interest in such operators in both mathematics\n(several of B. Simon's problems) and physics (e.g. Graphene, quantum Hall\neffect).\n  Whereas research in the first three decades was focused mainly on unraveling\nthe unusual properties of the AMO and operators with similar structure of\npotential, in recent years a combination of techniques from dynamical systems\nwith those from spectral theory has allowed for a more \"global,\"\nmodel-independent point of view. Intriguing phenomena first encountered for the\nAMO, notably the appearance of criticality corresponding to purely singular\ncontinuous spectrum for a measure theoretically typical realization of the\nphase, could be tested for prevalence in general models.\n  The intention of this article is to survey the theory of quasi-periodic\nSchr\\\"odinger-type operators attaining this \"global\" view-point with an\nemphasis on dynamical aspects of the spectral theory of such operators.\n", "  We review the role of dual pairs in mechanics and use them to derive\nparticle-like solutions to regularized incompressible fluid systems. In our\ncase we have a dual pair resulting from the action of diffeomorphisms on point\nparticles (essentially by moving the points). We then augment our dual pair by\nconsidering the action of diffeomorphisms on Taylor series, also known as jets.\nThe augmented weak dual pairs induce a hierarchy of particle-like solutions and\nconservation laws with particles carrying a copy of a jet group. We call these\naugmented particles jetlets. The jet groups serve as finite-dimensional models\nof the diffeomorphism group itself, and so the jetlet particles serve as a\nfinite-dimensional model of the self-similarity exhibited by ideal\nincompressible fluids. The conservation law associated to jetlet solutions is\nshown to be a shadow of Kelvin's circulation theorem. Finally, we study the\ndynamics of infinite time particle mergers. We prove that two merging particles\nat the zeroth level in the hierarchy yield dynamics which asymptotically\napproach that of a single particle in the first level in the hierarchy. This\nmerging behavior is then verified numerically as well as the exchange of\nangular momentum which must occur during a near collision of two particles. The\nresulting particle-like solutions suggest a new class of meshless methods which\nwork in dimensions $n \\geq 2$ and which exhibit a shadow of Kelvin's\ncirculation theorem. More broadly, this provides one of the first\nfinite-dimensional models of self-similarity in ideal fluids.\n", "  We present a simple and consistent way to compute correlation functions in\ninteracting theories with non-trivial phase diagram. As an example we show how\nto consistently compute the four-point function in three dimensional\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-scalar theories. The idea is to perform the path integral by\nweighting the momentum modes that contribute to it according to their\nrenormalization group (RG) relevance, i.e. we weight each mode according to the\nvalue of the running couplings at that scale. In this way, we are able encode\nin a loop computation the information regarding the RG trajectory along which\nwe are integrating. We show that depending on the initial condition, or initial\npoint in the phase diagram, we obtain different behaviors of the four-point\nfunction at the end point of the flow.\n", "  Energetic outflows from main sequence stars accreting mass at very high rates\nmight account for the powering of some eruptive objects, such as merging main\nsequence stars, major eruptions of luminous blue variables, e.g., the Great\nEruption of Eta Carinae, and other intermediate luminosity optical transients\n(ILOTs; Red Novae; Red Transients). These powerful outflows could potentially\nalso supply the extra energy required in the common envelope process and in the\ngrazing envelope evolution of binary systems. We propose that a massive\noutflow/jets mediated by magnetic fields might remove energy and angular\nmomentum from the accretion disk to allow such high accretion rate flows. By\nexamining the possible activity of the magnetic fields of accretion disks we\nconclude that indeed main sequence stars might accrete mass at very high rates,\nup to ~0.01 Mo/yr for solar type stars, and up to ~1 Mo/yr for very massive\nstars. We speculate that magnetic fields amplified in such extreme conditions\nmight lead to the formation of massive bipolar outflows that can remove most of\nthe disk's energy and angular momentum. It is this energy and angular momentum\nremoval that allows the very high mass accretion rate on to main sequence\nstars.\n", "  The discovery of materials that simultaneously host different phases of\nmatter has often initially confounded, but ultimately enhanced, our basic\nunderstanding of the coexisting types of order. The associated intellectual\nchallenges, together with the promise of greater versatility for potential\napplications, have made such systems a focus of modern materials science. In\nparticular, great efforts have recently been devoted to making semiconductors\nferromagnetic and metallic ferromagnets superconducting. Here we report the\nunprecedented observation of a heavily donor-doped ferromagnetic semiconductor,\nSmN, becoming superconducting with ferromagnetism remaining intact. The\nextremely large exchange splitting of the conduction and valence bands in this\nmaterial necessitates that the superconducting order hosted by SmN is of an\nunconventional triplet type, most likely exhibiting p-wave symmetry. Short\nrange spin fluctuations, which are thought to be the cause of pairing\ninteractions in currently known triplet superconductors, are quenched in SmN,\nsuggesting its superconductivity to be the result of phonon- or\nCoulomb-mediated pairing mechanisms. This scenario is further supported by the\ninferred heavy mass of superconducting charge carriers. The unique near-zero\nmagnetisation associated with the ferromagnetic state in SmN further aids its\ncoexistence with superconductivity. Presenting this novel material system where\nsemiconducting, ferromagnetic and superconducting properties are combined\nprovides a versatile new laboratory for studying quantum phases of matter.\nMoreover it is a major step towards identifying materials that merge\nsuperconductivity and spintronics, urgently needed to enable the design of\nelectronic devices with superior functionality.\n", "  Electric power-systems are one of the most important critical\ninfrastructures. In recent years, they have been exposed to extreme stress due\nto the increasing demand, the introduction of distributed renewable energy\nsources, and the development of extensive interconnections. We investigate the\nphenomenon of abrupt breakdown of an electric power-system under two scenarios:\nload growth (mimicking the ever-increasing customer demand) and power\nfluctuations (mimicking the effects of renewable sources). Our results indicate\nthat increasing the system size causes breakdowns to become more abrupt; in\nfact, mapping the system to a solvable statistical-physics model indicates the\noccurrence of a first order transition in the large size limit. Such an\nenhancement for the systemic risk failures (black-outs) with increasing network\nsize is an effect that should be considered in the current projects aiming to\nintegrate national power-grids into \"super-grids\".\n", "  The combination of Dirac physics and elasticity has been explored at length\nin graphene where the so--called \"elastic gauge fields\" have given rise to an\nentire new field of research and applications: Straintronics. The fact that\nthese elastic fields couple to fermions as the electromagnetic field, implies\nthat many electromagnetic responses will have elastic counterparts not explored\nbefore. In this work we will first show that the presence of elastic gauge\nfields will be the rule rather than the exception in most of the topologically\nnon--trivial materials in two and three dimensions. In particular we will\nextract the elastic gauge fields associated to the recently observed Weyl\nsemimetals, the \"three dimensional graphene\". As it is known, quantum\nelectrodynamics suffers from the chiral anomaly whose consequences have been\nrecently explored in matter systems. We will show that, associated to the\nphysics of the anomalies, and as a counterpart of the Hall conductivity,\nelastic materials will have a Hall viscosity in two and three dimensions with a\ncoefficient orders of magnitude bigger than the previously studied response.\nThe magnitude and generality of the new effect will greatly improve the chances\nfor the experimental observation of this topological, non dissipative response.\n", "  We study theoretically, numerically, and experimentally the relaxation of a\ncollisionless gas in a quadrupole trap after a momentum kick. The\nnon-separability of the potential enables a quasi thermalization of the single\nparticle distribution function even in the absence of interactions.\nSuprinsingly, the dynamics features an effective decoupling between the strong\ntrapping axis and the weak trapping plane. The energy delivered during the kick\nis redistributed according to the symmetries of the system and satisfies the\nVirial theorem, allowing for the prediction of the final temperatures. We show\nthat this behaviour is formally equivalent to the relaxation of massless\nrelativistic Weyl fermions after a sudden displacement from the center of a\nharmonic trap.\n", "  The mutual electromagnetic correlations between two spatially separated\nsystems gives rise to Casimir and Casimir-Polder effect. The corresponding\nforces, which are generally attractive for most vacuum-separated metallic or\ndielectric geometries, are due to the contribution to the ground-state energy\nof the coupled system. We investigate here the Casimir-Polder free energy\ncorresponding to interactions of a magnetically and electrically polarizable\nmicro-particle with a magneto-dielectric sheet. Our semi-phenomenological study\nshows that such an interaction is reversibly tunable in strength and sign.The\nlatter, particularly, is true provided we look for the exotic materials\nfabricated at scales between the micron and the nanometer. The crossover\nbetween attractive and repulsive behavior is found to depend on the\npolarizability ratio of the micro-particle and the electromagnetic impedance of\nthe magneto-dielectric sheet.\n", "  We compute the cross section and differential distributions for the\nproduction of a Z boson in association with a hadronic jet to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, including the\nleptonic decay of the Z boson. We present numerical results for the transverse\nmomentum and rapidity distributions of both the Z boson and the associated jet\nat the LHC. We find that the NNLO corrections increase the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) predictions by approximately 1% and significantly reduce the scale\nvariation uncertainty.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of monoclinic double perovskite\nSr$_2$CeIrO$_6$ were examined based on both experiments and first-principles\ndensity functional theory calculations. From the calculations we conclude that\nlow-spin-state Ir$^{4+}$ (5$\\textit{d}^5$, S=$\\frac{1}{2}$) shows t$_{2g}$ band\nderived anti-ferro type orbital ordering implying alternating occupations of\n$\\textit{d}_{yz}$ and $\\textit{d}_{xz}$ orbitals at the two symmetrically\nindependent Ir sites. The experimentally determined Jahn-Teller type distorted\nmonoclinic structure is consistent with the proposed orbital ordering picture.\nSurprisingly, the Ir-5$\\textit{d}$ orbital magnetic moment was found to be\n$\\approx$ 1.3 times larger than the spin magnetic moment. The experimentally\nobserved AFM-insulating states are consistent with the calculations. Both\nelectron-electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are required to\ndrive the experimentally observed AFM-insulating ground state. This single\nactive site double perovskite provides a rare platform with a prototype\ngeometrically frustrated fcc lattice where among the different degrees of\nfreedom (i.e spin, orbital, and lattice), spin-orbit interaction and Coulomb\ncorrelation energy scales compete and interact with each other.\n", "  Ionization by relativistically intense laser pulses of finite duration is\nconsidered in the framework of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Our main\nfocus is on the formation of ionization supercontinua. More specifically, when\nstudying the energy distributions of photoelectrons ionized by circularly\npolarized pulses, we observe the appearance of broad structures lacking the\ninterference patterns. These supercontinua extend over hundreds of driving\nphoton energies, thus corresponding to high-order nonlinear processes. The\ncorresponding polar-angle distributions show asymmetries which are attributed\nto the radiation pressure experienced by photoelectrons. Moreover, our time\nanalysis shows that the electrons comprising the supercontinuum can form pulses\nof short duration. While we present the fully numerical results, their\ninterpretation is based on the saddle-point approximation for the ionization\nprobability amplitude.\n", "  Increasing control of single photons enables new applications of photonic\nquantum-enhanced technology and further experimental exploration of fundamental\nquantum phenomena. Here, we demonstrate quantum logic using narrow linewidth\nphotons that are produced under nearly perfect quantum control from a single\n^87Rb atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity. We use a controlled- NOT\ngate integrated into a photonic chip to entangle these photons, and we observe\nnon-classical correlations between events separated by periods exceeding the\ntravel time across the chip by three orders of magnitude. This enables quantum\ntechnology that will use the properties of both narrowband single photon\nsources and integrated quantum photonics, such as networked quantum computing,\nnarrow linewidth quantum enhanced sensing and atomic memories.\n", "  The Frenet equation governs the extrinsic geometry of a string in\nthree-dimensional ambient space in terms of the curvature and torsion, which\nare both scalar functions under string reparameterisations. The description\nengages a local SO(2) gauge symmetry, which emerges from the invariance of the\nextrinsic string geometry under local frame rotations around the tangent\nvector. Here we inquire how to construct the most general SO(2) gauge invariant\nHamiltonian of strings, in terms of the curvature and torsion. The construction\ninstructs us to introduce a long-range (self-) interaction between strings,\nwhich is mediated by a three dimensional bulk gauge field with a Chern-Simons\nself-interaction. The results support the proposal that fractional statistics\nshould be prevalent in the case of three dimensional string-like\nconfigurations.\n", "  Super-resolved far-field microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for\ninvestigating the structure of objects with resolution well below the\ndiffraction limit of light. Nearly all super-resolution imaging techniques\nreported to date rely on real energy states of probe molecules to circumvent\nthe diffraction limit, preventing super-resolved imaging of contrast mechanisms\nthat occur via virtual energy states such as harmonic generation (HG). Here we\nreport a super-resolution technique based on SPatIal Frequency modulated\nImaging (SPIFI) that permits super-resolved nonlinear microscopy with any\ncontrast mechanism, and with single-pixel detection. We show multimodal\nsuper-resolved images with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and\nsecond-harmonic generation (SHG) from biological and inorganic media.\nMultiphoton SPIFI (MP-SPIFI) provides spatial resolution up to 2$\\eta$ below\nthe diffraction limit, where $\\eta$ is the highest power of the nonlinear\nintensity response. MP-SPIFI has the potential to not only provide enhanced\nresolution in optically thin media, but shows promise for providing\nsuper-resolved imaging at depth in scattering media - opening the possibility\nof $\\textit{in vivo}$ super-resolved imaging.\n", "  We show that recent observations of He I and N II lines of $\\eta$ Carinae may\nprovide support for an orbital orientation where the secondary star is closest\nto us at periastron passages. This conclusion is valid both for the commonly\nassumed masses of the two stars, and for the higher stellar masses model where\nthe very massive evolved primary star mass is $M_1=170 M_\\odot$ and its hot\nsecondary star mass is $M_2 = 80 M_\\odot$. The later model better explains the\nchange in the orbital period assuming that the ninetieth century Great Eruption\nwas powered by accretion onto the secondary star. Adopting the commonly used\nhigh eccentricity $e \\simeq 0.9$ and inclination $i=41^\\circ$, we obtain a good\nfit to newly released Doppler shift observations of He I emission and\nabsorption lines assuming they are emitted and absorbed in the acceleration\nzone of the secondary stellar wind. Our model in which the secondary star is in\nthe foreground at periastron is opposite to the view presented recently in the\nliterature.\n", "  We present results from a first demonstration of a magnetic field monitoring\nsystem for a neutron electric dipole moment experiment. The system is designed\nto reconstruct the vector components of the magnetic field in the interior\nmeasurement region solely from exterior measurements.\n", "  The correlation spectroscopy has been successfully employed in the\nmeasurement of the intrinsic linewidth of electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) in time and frequency domain. We study the role of the\nsidebands of the intense fields in the measured spectra, analyzing the\ninformation that can be recovered working with different analysis frequencies.\nIn this case, the non-zero one-photon detuning appears as a necessary condition\nfor spectrally resolving the sideband resonances in the correlation\ncoefficient. Our experimental findings are supported by the perturbative model\ndefined in the frequency domain.\n", "  Significant advances in coherence have made superconducting quantum circuits\na viable platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To further extend\ncapabilities, highly coherent quantum systems could act as quantum memories for\nthese circuits. A useful quantum memory must be rapidly addressable by qubits,\nwhile maintaining superior coherence. We demonstrate a novel superconducting\nmicrowave cavity architecture that is highly robust against major sources of\nloss that are encountered in the engineering of circuit QED systems. The\narchitecture allows for near-millisecond storage of quantum states in a\nresonator while strong coupling between the resonator and a transmon qubit\nenables control, encoding, and readout at MHz rates. The observed coherence\ntimes constitute an improvement of almost an order of magnitude over those of\nthe best available superconducting qubits. Our design is an ideal platform for\nstudying coherent quantum optics and marks an important step towards\nhardware-efficient quantum computing with Josephson junction-based quantum\ncircuits.\n", "  Optical activity is ubiquitous across natural and artificial media and is\nconventionally understood in terms of scattering from electric and magnetic\nmoments. Here we demonstrate experimentally and confirm numerically a type of\noptical activity that cannot be attributed to electric and magnetic multipoles.\nWe show that our observations can only be accounted for by the inclusion of the\ntoroidal dipole moment, the first term of the recently established peculiar\nfamily of toroidal multipoles.\n", "  The solar disk is a bright gamma-ray source. Surprisingly, its flux is about\none order of magnitude higher than predicted. As a first step toward\nunderstanding the physical origin of this discrepancy, we perform a new\nanalysis in 1-100 GeV using 6 years of public Fermi-LAT data. Compared to the\nprevious analysis by the Fermi Collaboration, who analyzed 1.5 years of data\nand detected the solar disk in 0.1-10 GeV, we find two new and significant\nresults: 1. In the 1-10 GeV flux (detected at $>5\\sigma$), we discover a\nsignificant time variation that anticorrelates with solar activity. 2. We\ndetect gamma rays in 10-30 GeV at $>5\\sigma$, and in 30-100 GeV at $> 2\\sigma$.\nThe time variation strongly indicates that solar-disk gamma rays are induced by\ncosmic rays and that solar atmospheric magnetic fields play an important role.\nOur results provide essential clues for understanding the underlying gamma-ray\nproduction processes, which may allow new probes of solar atmospheric magnetic\nfields, cosmic rays in the solar system, and possible new physics. Finally, we\nshow that the Sun is a promising new target for ground-based TeV gamma-ray\ntelescopes such as HAWC and LHAASO.\n", "  We report on a numerical study of real-time dynamics of electromagnetically\ninteracting chirally imbalanced lattice Dirac fermions within the classical\nstatistical field theory approach. Namely, we perform exact simulations of the\nreal-time quantum evolution of fermionic fields coupled to classical\nelectromagnetic fields, which are in turn coupled to the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the fermionic electric current. We use Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian for\nfermions, and non-compact action for the gauge field. In general, we observe\nthat the backreaction of fermions on the electromagnetic field prevents the\nsystem from acquiring chirality imbalance. In the case of chirality pumping in\nparallel electric and magnetic fields, electric field is screened by the\nproduced on-shell fermions and the accumulation of chirality is hence stopped.\nIn the case of evolution with initially present chirality imbalance, axial\ncharge tends to transform to helicity of electromagnetic field. By performing\nsimulations on large lattices we show that in most cases this decay process is\naccompanied by the inverse cascade phenomenon which transfers energy from\nshort-wavelength to long-wavelength electromagnetic fields. In some\nsimulations, however, we observe a very clear signature of inverse cascade for\nthe helical magnetic fields which is not accompanied by the axial charge decay.\nThis suggests that the relation between inverse cascade and axial charge decay\nis not as straightforward as predicted by the simplest form of anomalous\nMaxwell equations.\n", "  In analogy to the first law of thermodynamics, the increase in entanglement\nentropy $\\delta S$ of a conformal field theory (CFT) is proportional to the\nincrease in energy, $\\delta E$, of the subsystem divided by an effective\nentanglement temperature, $T_E$. Extending this analogy, we study entanglement\nentropy when the subsystem is perturbed by applying an external field,\nexpressed as a coupling to a local marginal operator in the CFT. We show that\nthe resulting entropy change is associated with a change in the entanglement\ntemperature itself, leading to an equation analogous to the Clausius relation.\nUsing AdS/CFT duality we develop a relationship between a perturbation in the\nlocal entanglement temperature, $\\delta T_E(x)$ of the CFT and the perturbation\nof the bulk AdS metric. Using the AdS$_3$ minimal surface as a probe, we can\nconstruct bulk metric perturbations from an exact numerical computation of the\nentanglement temperature in a two dimensional $c=1$ boundary theory deformed by\na marginal perturbation.\n", "  The pioneering experiments of linear spectroscopy were performed using flames\nin the 1800s, but nonlinear optical measurements had to wait until lasers\nbecame available in the twentieth century. Because the nonlinear cross section\nof materials is very small, usually macroscopic bulk samples and pulsed lasers\nare used. Numerous efforts have explored coherent nonlinear signal generation\nfrom individual nanoparticles or small atomic ensembles with millions of atoms.\nExperiments on a single semiconductor quantum dot have also been reported,\nalbeit with a very small yield. Here, we report on coherent nonlinear\nspectroscopy of a single molecule under continuous-wave single-pass\nillumination, where efficient photon-molecule coupling in a tight focus allows\nswitching of a laser beam by less than a handful of pump photons nearly\nresonant with the sharp molecular transition. Aside from their fundamental\nimportance, our results emphasize the potential of organic molecules for\napplications such as quantum information processing, which require strong\nnonlinearities.\n", "  Quantum coherence and quantum entanglement represent two fundamental features\nof non-classical systems that can each be characterized within an operational\nresource theory. In this paper, we unify the resource theories of entanglement\nand coherence by studying their combined behavior in the operational setting of\nlocal incoherent operations and classical communication (LIOCC). Specifically\nwe analyze the coherence and entanglement trade-offs in the tasks of state\nformation and resource distillation. For pure states we identify the minimum\ncoherence-entanglement resources needed to generate a given state, and we\nintroduce a new LIOCC monotone that completely characterizes a state's optimal\nrate of bipartite coherence distillation. This result allows us to precisely\nquantify the difference in operational powers between global incoherent\noperations, LIOCC, and local incoherent operations \\textit{without} classical\ncommunication. Finally, a bipartite mixed state is shown to have distillable\nentanglement if and only if entanglement can be distilled by LIOCC, and we\nstrengthen the well-known Horodecki criterion for distillability.\n", "  We present a direct lattice gauge theory computation that, without using\ndualities, demonstrates that the entanglement entropy of Yang-Mills theories\nwith arbitrary gauge group $G$ contains a generic logarithmic term at\nsufficiently weak coupling $e$. In two spatial dimensions, for a region of\nlinear size $r$, this term equals $\\frac{1}{2} \\dim(G) \\log\\left(e^2 r\\right)$\nand it dominates the universal part of the entanglement entropy. Such\nlogarithmic terms arise from the entanglement of the softest mode in the\nentangling region with the environment. For Maxwell theory in two spatial\ndimensions, our results agree with those obtained by dualizing to a compact\nscalar with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental observations on the skyrmion creation by\ncutting chiral stripe domains under a current drive [Jiang {\\emph{et al.}},\nScience {\\bf{349}}, 283 (2015)], we study the mechanism of skyrmion generation\nby simulating the dynamics of stripe domains. Our theory for skyrmion\ngeneration is based on the fact that there are two half skyrmions attached to\nthe ends of a stripe domain. These half skyrmions move due to the coupling\nbetween the skyrmion topological charge and current. As a consequence, the\nstripe domain is bent or stretched depending on the direction of motion of the\nhalf skyrmions. For a large current, skyrmions are created by chopping the\nstripe domains via strong bending or stretching. Our theory provides an\nexplanation to the experiments and is supported by the new experiments.\nFurthermore, we predict that skyrmions can also be generated using a Bloch\nstripe domain under a spin transfer torque which can be realized in B20\ncompounds.\n", "  The highly nonlinear many-body physics of a chain of mutually interacting\natoms in contact with a periodic substrate gives rise to complex static and\ndynamical phenomena, such as structural phase transitions and friction. In the\nlimit of an infinite chain incommensurate with the substrate, Aubry predicted a\nstructural transition with increasing substrate potential, from the chain's\nintrinsic arrangement free to slide on the substrate, to a pinned arrangement\nfavoring the substrate pattern. To date, the Aubry transition has not been\nobserved. Here, using a chain of cold ions subject to a periodic optical\npotential we qualitatively and quantitatively establish a close relation\nbetween Aubry's sliding-to-pinned transition and superlubricity breaking in\nstick-slip friction. Using friction measurements with high spatial resolution\nand individual ion detection, we experimentally observe the Aubry transition\nand the onset of its hallmark fractal atomic arrangement. Notably, the observed\ncritical lattice depth for a finite chain agrees well with the Aubry prediction\nfor an infinite chain. Our results elucidate the connection between competing\nordering patterns and superlubricity in nanocontacts - the elementary building\nblocks of friction.\n", "  We have investigated the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of\nthe pyrochlore iridates Eu2Ir2O7 and Pr2Ir2O7 using a combination of resonant\nelastic x-ray scattering, x-ray powder diffraction, and resonant inelastic\nx-ray scattering (RIXS). The structural parameters of Eu2Ir2O7 have been\nexamined as a function of temperature and applied pressure, with a particular\nemphasis on regions of the phase diagram where electronic and magnetic phase\ntransitions have been reported. We find no evidence of crystal symmetry change\nover the range of temperatures (~6 to 300 K) and pressures (~0.1 to 17 GPa)\nstudied. We have also investigated the electronic and magnetic excitations in\nsingle crystal samples of Eu2Ir2O7 and Pr2Ir2O7 using high resolution Ir\nL3-edge RIXS. In spite of very different ground state properties, we find these\nmaterials exhibit qualitatively similar excitation spectra, with crystal field\nexcitations at ~3-5 eV, spin-orbit excitations at ~0.5-1 eV, and broad\nlow-lying excitations below ~0.15 eV. In Eu2Ir2O7 we observe highly damped\nmagnetic excitations at ~45 meV, which display significant momentum dependence.\nWe compare these results with recent dynamical structure factor calculations.\n", "  We describe the critical behavior of electric field-driven (dynamic) Mott\ninsulator-to-metal transitions in dissipative Fermi and Bose systems in terms\nof non-Hermitian Hamiltonians invariant under simultaneous parity (P) and\ntime-reversal (T) operations. The dynamic Mott transition is identified as a PT\nsymmetry-breaking phase transition, with the Mott insulating state\ncorresponding to the regime of unbroken PT symmetry with a real energy\nspectrum. We establish that the imaginary part of the Hamiltonian arises from\nthe combined effects of the driving field and inherent dissipation. We derive\nthe renormalization and collapse of the Mott gap at the dielectric breakdown\nand describe the resulting critical behavior of transport characteristics. The\nobtained critical exponent is in an excellent agreement with experimental\nfindings.\n", "  Neutrinoless double-beta decay, if observed, would signal physics beyond the\nStandard Model that could be discovered at energies significantly lower than\nthose at which the relevant degrees of freedom could be excited. Therefore, it\ncould be challenging to further use the neutrinoless double-beta decay\nobservations to distinguish between many beyond Standard Model mechanisms\ncontributing to this process. Accurate nuclear structure calculations of the\nnuclear matrix elements necessary to analyze the decay rates could be helpful\nto narrow down the list of contributing mechanisms, and to better identify the\nmore exotic properties of the neutrinos. We investigate the information one can\nget from the angular and energy distribution of the emitted electron assuming\nthat the right-handed currents exist. For the analysis of these distributions\nwe calculate the necessary nuclear matrix elements using shell model\ntechniques.\n", "  We study how large the rate of the lepton-flavor violating Higgs decay h->tau\nmu can be in the (R-parity conserving) MSSM. We make no assumptions, such as\nuniversality or alignment, about the flavor structure of the MSSM. We only\nassume that all couplings and, in particular, the trilinear scalar ones, are\nperturbative. We take into account lower bounds on the bino and slepton masses\nfrom tau->mu gamma and h->gamma gamma as well as upper bounds on the trilinear\nscalar couplings from the requirement that the global minimum is not charge\nbreaking. We find that in highly fine-tuned regions of parameter space, the\nratio BR(h->tau mu)/BR(h->tau tau) can be enhanced by about three orders of\nmagnitude above the estimate from naive dimensional analysis, but still about\ntwo orders of magnitude below the present bound. Thus, if h->tau mu is\nexperimentally established to be close to present bounds, the MSSM will be\nexcluded.\n", "  This work intends to give the state-of-the-art of our knowledge of the\nperformance of LEKIDs at millimetre wavelengths (from 80 to 180~GHz). We\nevaluate their optical sensitivity under typical background conditions and\ntheir interaction with ionising particles. Two LEKID arrays, originally\ndesigned for ground-based applications and composed of a few hundred pixels\neach, operate at a central frequency of 100, and 150~GHz ($\\Delta \\nu / \\nu$\nabout 0.3). Their sensitivities have been characterised in the laboratory using\na dedicated closed-circle 100~mK dilution cryostat and a sky simulator,\nallowing for the reproduction of realistic, space-like observation conditions.\nThe impact of cosmic rays has been evaluated by exposing the LEKID arrays to\nalpha particles ($^{241}$Am) and X sources ($^{109}$Cd) with a readout sampling\nfrequency similar to the ones used for Planck HFI (about 200~Hz), and also with\na high resolution sampling level (up to 2~MHz) in order to better characterise\nand interpret the observed glitches. In parallel, we have developed an\nanalytical model to rescale the results to what would be observed by such a\nLEKID array at the second Lagrangian point.\n", "  Weak Wave Turbulence is a powerful theory to predict statistical observables\nof diverse relevant physical phenomena, such as ocean waves,\nmagnetohydrodynamics and nonlinear optics. The theory is based upon an\nasymptotic closure permitted in the limit of small nonlinearity. Here, we\nexplore the possible deviations from this mean-field framework, in terms of\nanomalous scaling, focusing on the case of elastic plates. We establish the\npicture of the possible behaviors at varying the extent of nonlinearity, and we\nshow that the mean-field theory is appropriate when all excited scales remain\ndominated by linear dynamics. The other picture is non-trivial and our results\nsuggest that, when large scales contain much energy, the cascade sustains\nextreme events at small scales and the system displays intermittency.\n", "  The spin of an electron in a semiconductor quantum dot represents a natural\nnanoscale solid state qubit. Coupling to nuclear spins leads to decoherence\nthat limits the number of allowed quantum logic operations for this qubit.\nTraditional approach to characterize decoherence is to explore spin Relaxation\nand the spin echo, which are equivalent to the studies of the spins 2nd order\ntime-correlator at various external conditions. Here we develop an alternative\ntechnique by showing that considerable information about dynamics can be\nobtained from direct measurements of higher than the 2nd order correlators,\nwhich to date have been hindered in semiconductor quantum dots. We show that\nsuch correlators are sensitive to pure quantum effects that cannot be explained\nwithin the classical framework, and which allow direct determination of\nensemble and quantum dephasing times with only repeated projective measurements\nwithout the need for coherent spin control. Our method enables studies of pure\nquantum effects, including tests of the Leggett-Garg type inequalities that\nrule out local hidden variable interpretation of the spin qubit dynamics.\n", "  We discuss the abstract structure of sequential weak measurement (WM) of\ngeneral observables. In all orders, the sequential WM correlations without\npost-selection yield the corresponding correlations of the Wigner function,\noffering direct quantum tomography through the moments of the canonical\nvariables. Spin-half sequential measurements are, on the contrary, constrained\nkinematically, they are equivalent with single WMs. In sequential WMs with\npost-selection, a new anomaly occurs, different from the weak value anomaly of\nsingle WMs. In particular, the spread of polarization $\\hat\\sigma$, as measured\nin double WMs of $\\hat\\sigma$, will diverge for certain orthogonal pre- and\npost-selected states.\n", "  A short overview is presented for the recent progress in the theory of heavy\nflavor transport in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, including a summary\nof different transport models, their phenomenological results of heavy meson\nquenching and flow at RHIC and LHC, a possible solution to the $R_\\mathrm{AA}$\nvs. $v_2$ puzzle and predictions for heavy flavor observables beyond the\ncurrent measurements.\n", "  The discovery of topological insulators (TIs), materials with bulk band gaps\nand protected cross-gap surface states, in compounds such as Bi2Se3 has\ngenerated much interest in identifying topological surface states (TSSs) in\nother classes of materials. In particular, recent theory calculations suggest\nthat TSSs may be found in half-Heusler ternary compounds. If experimentally\nrealizable, this would provide a materials platform for entirely new\nheterostructure spintronic devices that make use of the structurally-identical\nbut electronically-varied nature of Heusler compounds. Here, we show the\npresence of a TSS in epitaxially grown thin films of the half-Heusler compound\nPtLuSb. Spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),\ncomplemented by theoretical calculations, reveals a surface state with linear\ndispersion and a helical tangential spin texture consistent with previous\npredictions. This experimental verification of TI behavior is a significant\nstep forward in establishing half-Heusler compounds as a viable material system\nfor future spintronics devices.\n", "  Light propagating in tissue attains a spectrum that varies with location due\nto wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation by tissue optical properties, an\neffect that causes spectral corruption. Predictions of the spectral variations\nof light fluence in tissue are challenging since the spatial distribution of\noptical properties in tissue cannot be resolved in high resolution or with high\naccuracy by current methods. Spectral corruption has fundamentally limited the\nquantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic methods and impeded the\nlong sought-after goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO2) deep in\ntissues; a critical but still unattainable target for the assessment of\noxygenation in physiological processes and disease. We discover a new principle\nunderlying light fluence in tissues, which describes the wavelength dependence\nof light fluence as an affine function of a few reference base spectra,\nindependently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties. This\nfinding enables the introduction of a previously undocumented concept termed\neigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT) that can effectively\naccount for wavelength dependent light attenuation without explicit knowledge\nof the tissue optical properties. We validate eMSOT in more than 2000\nsimulations and with phantom and animal measurements. We find that eMSOT can\nquantitatively image tissue sO2 reaching in many occasions a better than\n10-fold improved accuracy over conventional spectral optoacoustic methods.\nThen, we show that eMSOT can spatially resolve sO2 in muscle and tumor;\nrevealing so far unattainable tissue physiology patterns. Last, we related\neMSOT readings to cancer hypoxia and found congruence between eMSOT tumor sO2\nimages and tissue perfusion and hypoxia maps obtained by correlative\nhistological analysis.\n", "  The unique conduction properties of condensed matter systems with topological\norder have recently inspired a quest for similar effects in classical wave\nphenomena. Acoustic topological insulators, in particular, hold the promise to\nrevolutionize our ability to control sound, allowing for large isolation in the\nbulk and broadband one-way transport on their edges, with topological immunity\nagainst structural defects and disorder. So far these fascinating properties\nhave been obtained relying on moving media, which inherently introduce noise\nand absorption losses, hindering the practical applicability of topological\nacoustics. Here, we overcome these limitations by modulating in time the\nacoustic properties of a lattice of resonators, introducing the concept of\nacoustic Floquet topological insulators. Acoustic modulation at ultrasonic\nfrequencies can reach values as high as a few percents, enabling broadband\neffects with an on-site, moderate modulation strategy that surprisingly does\nnot require phase uniformity across the lattice. Using first-principle\nnumerical experiments, we show that acoustic waves provide a fertile ground to\napply the anomalous physics of Floquet topological insulators, and demonstrate\ntheir relevance for a wide range of acoustic applications, including broadband\nacoustic isolation and topologically protected, nonreciprocal acoustic\nemitters.\n", "  Despite decades of investigations, the physical mechanism that powers the\nbright prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still not\nidentified. One important observational clue that remains not properly\ninterpreted so far is the existence of time lags of broad light curve pulses in\ndifferent energy bands, named \"spectral lags\". Here we show that the\ntraditional view invoking the high-latitude emission \"curvature effect\" of a\nrelativistic jet cannot account for spectral lags. Rather, the observed\nspectral lags demand the sweep of a spectral peak across the observing energy\nband in a specific manner. The duration of the broad pulses and inferred\ntypical Lorentz factor of GRBs require that the emission region is in an\noptically thin emission region far from the GRB central engine. We construct a\nsimple physical model invoking synchrotron radiation from a rapidly expanding\noutflow. We show that the observed spectral lags appear naturally in our model\nlight-curves given that (1) the gamma-ray photon spectrum is curved (as\nobserved), (2) the magnetic field strength in the emitting region decreases\nwith radius as the region expands in space, and (3) the emission region itself\nundergoes rapid bulk acceleration as the prompt $\\gamma$-rays are produced.\nThese requirements are consistent with a Poynting-flux-dominated jet abruptly\ndissipating magnetic energy at a large distance from the engine.\n", "  We present the discovery of the first Neptune analog exoplanet or super-Earth\nwith Neptune-like orbit, MOA-2013-BLG-605Lb. This planet has a mass similar to\nthat of Neptune or a super-Earth and it orbits at $9\\sim 14$ times the expected\nposition of the snow-line, $a_{\\rm snow}$, which is similar to Neptune's\nseparation of $ 11\\,a_{\\rm snow}$ from the Sun. The planet/host-star mass ratio\nis $q=(3.6\\pm0.7)\\times 10^{-4}$ and the projected separation normalized by the\nEinstein radius is $s=2.39\\pm0.05$. There are three degenerate physical\nsolutions and two of these are due to a new type of degeneracy in the\nmicrolensing parallax parameters, which we designate \"the wide degeneracy\". The\nthree models have (i) a Neptune-mass planet with a mass of $M_{\\rm\np}=21_{-7}^{+6} M_{Earth}$ orbiting a low-mass M-dwarf with a mass of $M_{\\rm\nh}=0.19_{-0.06}^{+0.05} M_\\odot$, (ii) a mini-Neptune with $M_{\\rm p}=\n7.9_{-1.2}^{+1.8} M_{Earth}$ orbiting a brown dwarf host with $M_{\\rm\nh}=0.068_{-0.011}^{+0.019} M_\\odot$ and (iii) a super-Earth with $M_{\\rm p}=\n3.2_{-0.3}^{+0.5} M_{Earth}$ orbiting a low-mass brown dwarf host with $M_{\\rm\nh}=0.025_{-0.004}^{+0.005} M_\\odot$ which is slightly favored. The 3-D\nplanet-host separations are 4.6$_{-1.2}^{+4.7}$ AU, 2.1$_{-0.2}^{+1.0}$ AU and\n0.94$_{-0.02}^{+0.67}$ AU, which are $8.9_{-1.4}^{+10.5}$, $12_{-1}^{+7}$ or\n$14_{-1}^{+11}$ times larger than $a_{\\rm snow}$ for these models,\nrespectively. The Keck AO observation confirm that the lens is faint. This\ndiscovery suggests that low-mass planets with Neptune-like orbit are common. So\nprocesses similar to the one that formed Neptune in our own Solar System or\ncold super-Earth may be common in other solar systems.\n", "  Quantum correlations present in a broadband two-line squeezed microwave state\ncan induce entanglement in a spatially separated bipartite system consisting of\neither two single qubits or two qubit ensembles. By using an appropriate master\nequation for a bipartite quantum system in contact with two separate but\nentangled baths, the generating entanglement process in spatially separated\nquantum systems is thoroughly characterized. Our results provide evidence that\nthis entanglement transfer by dissipation is feasible yielding to a\nsteady-state amount of entanglement in the bipartite quantum system which can\nbe optimized for a wide range of realistic physical systems that include\nstate-of-the-art experiments with NV centers in diamond, superconducting qubits\nor even magnetic molecules embedded in a crystalline matrix.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional two-component atomic Fermi gas with an infinite\nintercomponent contact repulsion. It is found that adding an attractive\nresonant odd-wave interaction breaking the rotational symmetry one can make the\nground state ferromagnetic. A promising system for the observation of this\nitinerant ferromagnetic state is a 1D gas of $^{40}$K atoms, where 3D $s$-wave\nand $p$-wave Feshbach resonances are very close to each other and the 1D\nconfinement significantly reduces the inelastic decay.\n", "  A generalized tight-binding model, which is based on the subenvelope\nfunctions of the different sublattices, is developed to explore the novel\nmagnetic quantization in monolayer gray tin. The effects due to the $sp^{3}$\nbonding, the spin-orbital coupling, the magnetic field and the electric field\nare simultaneously taken into consideration. The unique magneto-electronic\nproperties lie in two groups of low-lying Landau levels, with different orbital\ncomponents, localization centers, state degeneracy, spin configurations, and\nmagnetic- and electric-field dependences. The first and second groups mainly\ncome from the $5p_{z}$ and ($5p_{x}$,$5p_{y}$) orbitals, respectively. Their\nLandau-level splittings are, respectively, induced by the electric field and\nspin-orbital interactions. The intragroup anti-crossings are only revealed in\nthe former. The unique tinene Landau levels are absent in graphene, silicene\nand germanene.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental progress on the strong\nspin-orbit-coupled rare earth triangular antiferromagnet, we analyze the highly\nanisotropic spin model that describes the interaction between the\nspin-orbit-entangled Kramers' doublet local moments on the triangular lattice.\nWe apply the Luttinger-Tisza method, the classical Monte Carlo simulation, and\nthe self-consistent spin wave theory to analyze the anisotropic spin\nHamiltonian. The classical phase diagram includes the 120-degree state and two\ndistinct stripe ordered phases. The frustration is very strong and\nsignificantly suppresses the ordering temperature in the regimes close to the\nphase boundary between two ordered phases. Going beyond the semiclassical\nanalysis, we include the quantum fluctuations of the spin moments within a\nself-consistent Dyson-Maleev spin-wave treatment. We find that the strong\nquantum fluctuations melt the magnetic order in the frustrated regions. We\nexplore the magnetic excitations in the three different ordered phases as well\nas in strong magnetic fields. Our results provide a guidance for the future\ntheoretical study of the generic model and are broadly relevant for strong\nspin-orbit-coupled triangular antiferromagnets such as YbMgGaO4, RCd3P3,\nRZn3P3, RCd3As3, RZn3As3, and R2O2CO3.\n", "  Broadband microwave spectroscopy has been performed on single-crystalline\nGaV$_4$S$_8$, which exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram including\ncycloidal, N\\'eel-type skyrmion lattice, as well as field-polarized\nferromagnetic phases below 13 K. At zero and small magnetic fields two\ncollective modes are found at 5 and 15 GHz, which are characteristic of the\ncycloidal state in this easy-axis magnet. In finite fields, entering the\nskyrmion lattice phase, the spectrum transforms into a multi-mode pattern with\nabsorption peaks near 4, 8, and 15 GHz. The spin excitation spectra in\nGaV$_4$S$_8$ and their field dependencies are found to be in close relation to\nthose observed in materials with Bloch-type skyrmions. Distinct differences\narise from the strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of GaV4S8 not present in\nso-far known skyrmion hosts.\n", "  We identify the norm of the semigroup generated by the non-self-adjoint\nharmonic oscillator acting on $L^2(\\Bbb{R})$, for all complex times where it is\nbounded. We relate this problem to embeddings between Gaussian-weighted spaces\nof holomorphic functions, and we show that the same technique applies, in any\ndimension, to the semigroup $e^{-tQ}$ generated by an elliptic quadratic\noperator acting on $L^2(\\Bbb{R}^n)$. The method used --- identifying the\nexponents of sharp products of Mehler formulas --- is elementary and is\ninspired by more general works of L. H\\\"ormander, A. Melin, and J. Sj\\\"ostrand.\n", "  We consider the problem of remote two-qubit state creation using the\ntwo-qubit excitation pure initial state of the sender. The communication line\nis based on the optimized boundary controlled chain with two pairs of properly\nadjusted coupling constants. The creation of the two-qubit Werner state is\nconsidered as an example. We also study the effects of imperfections of the\nchain on the state-creation.\n", "  We consider quantum entanglement of three accelerating qubits, each of which\nis locally coupled with a real scalar field, without causal influence among the\nqubits or among the fields. The initial states are assumed to be the GHZ and W\nstates, which are the two representative three-partite entangled states. For\neach initial state, we study how various kinds of entanglement depend on the\naccelerations of the three qubits. All kinds of entanglement eventually\nsuddenly die if at least two of three qubits have large enough accelerations.\nThis result implies the eventual sudden death of all kinds of entanglement\namong three particles coupled with scalar fields when they are sufficiently\nclose to the horizon of a black hole.\n", "  A way to describe the hydrodynamics of the quark-gluon plasma using a DBI\naction is proposed, based on the model found by Heisenberg for high energy\nscattering of nucleons. The expanding plasma is described as a shockwave in a\nDBI model for a real scalar standing in for the pion, and I show that one\nobtains a fluid description in terms of a relativistic fluid that near the\nshock is approximately ideal ($\\eta\\simeq 0$) and conformal. One can introduce\nan extra term inside the square root of the DBI action that generates a shear\nviscosity term in the energy-momentum tensor near the shock, as well as a bulk\nviscosity, and regulates the behaviour of the energy density at the shock,\nmaking it finite. The resulting fluid satisfies the relativistic Navier-Stokes\nequation with $u^\\mu, \\rho,P,\\eta$ defined in terms of $\\phi$ and its\nderivatives. One finds a relation between the parameters of the theory and the\nQGP thermodynamics, $\\a/\\b^2=\\eta/(sT)$, and by fixing $\\a$ and $\\b$ from usual\n(low multiplicity) particle scattering, one finds $T\\propto m_\\pi$.\n", "  It is argued that two-dimensional U(N) spin models for any N undergo a\nBKT-like phase transition, similarly to the famous XY model. This conclusion\nfollows from the Berezinskii-like calculation of the two-point correlation\nfunction in U(N) models, approximate renormalization group analysis and\nnumerical investigations of the U(2) model. It is shown, via Monte Carlo\nsimulations, that the universality class of the U(2) model coincides with that\nof the XY model. Moreover, preliminary numerical results point out that\ntwo-dimensional SU(N) spin models with the fundamental and adjoint terms and\nN>4 exhibit two phase transitions of BKT type, similarly to Z(N) vector models.\n", "  We study a scale-invariant model of quadratic gravity with a non-minimally\ncoupled scalar field. We focus on cosmological solutions and find that scale\ninvariance is spontaneously broken and a mass scale naturally emerges. Before\nthe symmetry breaking, the Universe undergoes an inflationary expansion with\nnearly the same observational predictions of Starobinsky's model. At the end of\ninflation, the Hubble parameter and the scalar field converge to a stable fixed\npoint through damped oscillations and the usual Einstein-Hilbert action is\nrecovered. The oscillations around the fixed point can reheat the Universe in\nvarious ways and we study in detail some of these possibilities.\n", "  Models of compositeness can successfully address the origin of the Higgs\nboson, as a pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson (pNGB) of a spontaneously broken\nglobal symmetry, and flavour physics via the partial compositeness mechanism.\nIf the dynamics is generated by a confining gauge group with fermionic matter\ncontent, there exists only a finite set of models that have the correct\nproperties to account for the Higgs and top partners at the same time. In this\nletter we explore the theory space of this class of models: remarkably, all of\nthem contain - beyond the pNGB Higgs - a pNGB singlet, $a$, which couples to\nStandard Model gauge bosons via Wess-Zumino-Witten interactions, thus providing\nnaturally a resonance in di-boson at the LHC. With the assumption that the\nrecently reported di-photon excess at 750 GeV at the LHC arises from the\na-resonance, we propose a generic approach on how to delineate the best\ncandidate for composite Higgs models with top-partners. We find that\nconstraints from other di-boson searches severely reduce the theory space of\nthe models under consideration. For the models which can explain the di-photon\nexcess, we make precise and testable predictions for the width and other\ndi-boson resonance searches.\n", "  The so-called NOON states are quantum optical resources known to be useful\nespecially for quantum lithography and metrology. At the same time, they are\nknown to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce\nexperimentally. Concerning the former, here we present a scheme where NOON\nstates are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes\nagainst photon losses, thus demonstrating that such resources can also be\nuseful to suppress the effect of loss. Our NOON-code is an exact code that can\nbe systematically extended from one-photon to higher-number losses. Its loss\nscaling depending on the codeword photon number is the same as for some\nexisting, exact loss codes such as bosonic and quantum parity codes, but its\ncodeword mode number is intermediate between that of the other codes. Another\ngeneralisation of the NOON-code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead\nof logical qubits. While, in general, the final codewords are always obtainable\nfrom multi-mode NOON states through application of beam splitters, both\ncodewords for the one-photon-loss qubit NOON-code can be simply created from\nsingle-photon states with beam splitters. We give various examples and also\ndiscuss a potential application of our qudit code for quantum communication.\n", "  By considering a nanoscale Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer containing a\nparrallel-coupled double dot coupled to the source and drain electrodes, we\ninvestigate the AB phase oscillations of transport current via the bonding and\nantibonding state channels. The results we obtained justify the experimental\nanalysis given in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{106}, 076801 (2011)] that bonding\nstate currents in different energy configurations are almost the same. On the\nother hand, we extend the analysis to the transient transport current\ncomponents flowing through different channels, to explore the effect of the\nparity of bonding and antibonding states on the AB phase dependence of the\ncorresponding current components in the transient regime. The relations of the\nAB phase dependence between the quantum states and the associated current\ncomponents are analyzed in details, which provides useful information for the\nreconstruction of quantum states through the measurement of the transport\ncurrent in such systems. With the coherent properties in the quantum dot states\nas well as in the transport currents, we also provide a way to manipulate the\nbonding and antibonding states by the AB magnetic flux.\n", "  We re-examine the emergence of a universal non-equilibrium steady state\nfollowing a local quench between quantum critical heat baths in spatial\ndimensions greater than one. We show that energy transport proceeds by the\nformation of an instantaneous shock wave and a broadening rarefaction wave on\neither side of the interface, and not by two shock waves as previously\nproposed. For small temperature differences the universal steady state energy\ncurrents of the two-shock and rarefaction-shock solutions coincide. Over a\nbroad range of parameters, the difference in the energy flow across the\ninterface between these two solutions is at the level of two percent. The\nproperties of the energy flow remain fully universal and independent of the\nmicroscopic theory. We briefly discuss the width of the shock wave in a viscous\nfluid, the effects of momentum relaxation, and the generalization to charged\nfluids.\n", "  We suggest that in the rare case of an Intermediate-Luminosity Optical\nTransient (ILOTs) event, evaporation of extra-solar Kuiper belt objects\n(ExtraKBOs) at distances of d ~ 500 - 10000AU from the ILOT can be detected. If\nthe ILOT lasts for 1 month to a few years, enough dust might be ejected from\nthe ExtraKBOs for the IR emission to be detected. Because of the large distance\nof the ExtraKBOs, tens of years will pass before the ILOT wind disperses the\ndust. We suggest that after an ILOT outburst there is a period of months to\nseveral years during which IR excess emission might hint at the existence of a\nKuiper belt analog (ExtraK-Belt).\n", "  Junctions of multiple one-dimensional quantum wires of interacting electrons\nhave received considerable theoretical attention as a basic constituent of\nquantum circuits. While results have been obtained on these models using\nbosonization and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods, another\npowerful technique is based on direct perturbation theory in the bulk\ninteractions, combined with the Renormalization Group (RG) and summed in the\nRandom Phase Approximation (RPA). This technique has so far only been applied\nto the case where finite length interacting wires are attached to\nnon-interacting Fermi liquid leads. We reformulate it in terms of the\nsingle-particle S-matrix, formally unifying treatments of junctions of\ndifferent numbers of leads, and extend this method to cover the case of\ninfinite length interacting leads obtaining results on 2-lead and 3-lead\njunctions in good agreement with previous bosonization and DMRG results.\n", "  Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference unveils a distinct behavior of identical\nparticles which cannot be distinguished from each other. Especially for bosons,\ntwo separated identical particles passing through a beamsplitter always go\ntogether into one of the output ports, but that is not the case with other\nparticles including fermions or classical ones. So far many elemental\nproperties of quantum physics and information have been discovered through the\nconcatenated HOM effects, which has been demonstrated in photons and recently\nin plasmons, atoms and phonons. However, all demonstrations in optical region\nemployed two particles in different spatial modes. Here we first report the HOM\ninterference between two photons in a single spatial mode with different\nfrequencies (energies) by using a partial frequency conversion. The\ndemonstrated frequency-domain interferometer allows us to replace spatial\noptical paths by optical frequency multiplexing, which opens up a distinct\narchitecture of the quantum interferometry.\n", "  Vacuum excitation by time-varying boundary conditions is not only of\nfundamental importance but also has recently been confirmed in a laboratory\nexperiment. In this paper, we study the vacuum excitation of a scalar field by\nthe instantaneous appearance and disappearance of a both-sided Dirichlet wall\nin the middle of a 1D cavity, as toy models of bifurcating and merging\nspacetimes, respectively. It is shown that the energy flux emitted positively\ndiverges on the null lines emanating from the appearance and disappearance\nevents, which is analogous to the result of Anderson and DeWitt. This result\nsuggests that the semiclassical effect prevents the spacetime both from\nbifurcating and merging. In addition, we argue that the diverging flux in the\ndisappearance case plays an interesting role to compensate for the lowness of\nambient energy density after the disappearance, which is lower than the\nzero-point level.\n", "  We advocate the possibility that the observed diphoton excess at 750 GeV at\nthe LHC can be addressed by the scalar field that is a part of the SU(5)\nsymmetry breaking sector. The field in question is the Standard Model singlet\nthat resides in the adjoint representation that breaks SU(5) down to SU(3) x\nSU(2) x U(1). We also show that the required production and subsequent decay to\ntwo photons of this singlet can be induced by individual or combined\ncontribution of two scalar multiplets $S_3$ and $R_2$ that transform as\n(3,3,-1/3) and (3,2,7/6) under SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1), respectively. The\nindividual dominance of these multiplets is directly related to the issue of\nthe charged fermion mass generation within the SU(5) framework and can be\nunambiguously tested through the diboson decay signatures of the Standard Model\nsinglet field.\n", "  In topological insulators (TIs), metallic surface conductance saturates the\ninsulating bulk resistance with de- creasing temperature, resulting in\nresistivity plateau at low temperatures as a transport signature originating\nfrom metallic surface modes protected by time reversal symmetry (TRS). Such\ncharacteristic has been found in several materials including Bi2Te2Se, SmB6\netc. Recently, similar behavior has been observed in metallic com- pound LaSb,\naccompanying an extremely large magetoresistance (XMR). Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)\noscillation at low temperatures further confirms the metallic behavior of\nplateau region under magnetic fields. LaSb[1] has been proposed by the authors\nas a possible topological semimetal (TSM), while negative magnetoresistance is\nabsent at this moment. Here, high quality single crystals of NbAs2/TaAs2 with\ninversion symmetry have been grown and the resistivity under magnetic field is\nsystematically investigated. Both of them exhibit metallic behavior under zero\nmagnetic field, and a metal-to-insulator transition occurs when a nonzero\nmagnetic field is applied, resulting in XMR (1.0*105% for NbAs2 and 7.3*105%\nfor TaAs2 at 2.5 K & 14 T). With tempera- ture decreased, a resistivity plateau\nemerges after the insulator-like regime and SdH oscillation has also been\nobserved in NbAs2 and TaAs2.\n", "  Competing orders is a general concept to describe various quantum phases and\ntransitions in various materials. One efficient way to investigate competing\norders is to first classify different class of excitations in a given quantum\nphase, then study their competing responses under various external probes. This\nstrategy may not only lead to deep understanding of the quantum phase itself,\nbut also its deep connections to various other quantum phases nearby. We\nimplement this approach by studying the Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model\n(RFHM) in two different transverse fields $h_x$ and $h_z$ which can be\nintuitively visualized as studying spin-orbit couplings (SOC) effects in 2d\nIsing or anisotropic XY model in a transverse field. At a special SOC class, it\nwas known that the RFHM at a zero field owns an exact ground state called Y-x\nstate. It supports non only the commensurate C-C$_0$ and C-C$_{\\pi} $ magnons,\nbut also the in-commensurate C-IC magnons. These magnons are non-relativistic,\nnot contained in the exact ground state, so need to be thermally excited. Their\ndramatic response under the longitudinal $ h_y $ field was recently worked out\nby the authors. Here we find they respond very differently under the two\ntransverse fields. Any $h_x$ ($h_z$) changes the collinear Y-x state to a\ncanted co-planar YX-x (YZ-x) state which suffers quantum fluctuations. The\nC-C$_0$, C-C$_{\\pi} $ and C-IC magnons sneak into the quantum ground state,\nbecome relativistic and play leading roles even at $ T=0 $. We map out the\nboundaries among the C-C$_0$, C-C$_{\\pi} $ and C-IC magnons, especially the\ndetailed evolution of the C-IC magnons inside the canted phases. As $h_x$\n($h_z$) increases further, the C-C$_0$ magnons always win the competition and\nemerge as the seeds to drive a transition from the YX-x (YZ-x) to the X-FM (\nZ-FM ) which is shown to be in the 3d Ising universality class.\n", "  Exploiting the Kepler transit data, we uncover a dramatic distinction in the\nprevalence of sub-Jovian companions, between systems that contain hot Jupiters\n(periods inward of 10 days) and those that host warm Jupiters (periods between\n10 and 200 days). Hot Jupiters, with the singular exception of WASP-47b, do not\nhave any detectable inner or outer planetary companions (with periods inward of\n50 days and sizes down to $2 R_{\\rm Earth}$). Restricting ourselves to inner\ncompanions, our limits reach down to $1 R_{\\rm Earth}$. In stark contrast, half\nof the warm Jupiters are closely flanked by small companions. Statistically,\nthe companion fractions for hot and warm Jupiters are mutually exclusive,\nparticularly in regard to inner companions.\n  The high companion fraction of warm Jupiters also yields clues to their\nformation. The warm Jupiters that have close-by siblings should have low\norbital eccentricities and low mutual inclinations. The orbital configurations\nof these systems are reminiscent of those of the low-mass, close-in planetary\nsystems abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission. This, and other arguments,\nlead us to propose that these warm Jupiters are formed in-situ. There are\nindications that there may be a second population of warm Jupiters with\ndifferent characteristics. In this picture, WASP-47b could be regarded as the\nextending tail of the in-situ warm Jupiters into the hot Jupiter region, and\ndoes not represent the generic formation route for hot Jupiters.\n", "  We compute in closed analytical form the minimal set of \"seed\" conformal\nblocks associated to the exchange of generic mixed symmetry spinor/tensor\noperators in an arbitrary representation (l,\\bar l) of the Lorentz group in\nfour dimensional conformal field theories. These blocks arise from 4-point\nfunctions involving two scalars, one (0,|l-\\bar l|) and one (|l-\\bar l|,0)\nspinors or tensors. We directly solve the set of Casimir equations, that can\nelegantly be written in a compact form for any (l,\\bar l), by using an educated\nansatz and reducing the problem to an algebraic linear system. Various details\non the form of the ansatz have been deduced by using the so called shadow\nformalism. The complexity of the conformal blocks depends on the value of\np=|l-\\bar l | and grows with p, in analogy to what happens to scalar conformal\nblocks in d even space-time dimensions as d increases. These results open the\nway to bootstrap 4-point functions involving arbitrary spinor/tensor operators\nin four dimensional conformal field theories.\n", "  We study the temperature-dependent evolution of the octahedral tilt order in\na lead-free relaxor ferroelectric and its impact on the ferroelectric\nproperties. Using diffuse neutron scattering on a\n0.964Na$_{1/2}$Bi$_{1/2}$TiO$_3$-0.036BaTiO$_3$ single crystal, we suggest a\nmodel for the temperature-dependent nanostructure of this perovskite that\nfeatures chemically pinned tetragonal platelets embedded in the rhombohedral\nmatrix, often separated by a cubic intermediate phase. Our results show a clear\ncorrelation between the squared thickness of the tetragonal platelets and the\ndielectric permittivity. This is interpreted as a sign for increased\npolarizability of the strained and distorted lattice at the center of the\ntetragonal platelets.\n", "  Many experiments have shown the detection of spin-currents driven by\nradio-frequency spin pumping from yttrium iron garnet (YIG), by making use of\nthe inverse spin-Hall effect, which is present in materials with strong\nspin-orbit coupling, such as Pt. Here we show that it is also possible to\ndirectly detect the resonance-driven spin-current using Au/permalloy (Py,\nNi$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) devices, where Py is used as a detector for the spins\npumped across the YIG/Au interface. This detection mechanism is equivalent to\nthe spin-current detection in metallic non-local spin-valve devices. By finite\nelement modeling we compare the pumped spin-current from a reference Pt strip\nwith the detected signals from the Au/Py devices. We find that for one series\nof Au/Py devices the calculated spin pumping signals mostly match the\nmeasurements, within 20%, whereas for a second series of devices additional\nsignals are present which are up to a factor 10 higher than the calculated\nsignals from spin pumping. We also identify contributions from thermoelectric\neffects caused by the resonant (spin-related) and non-resonant heating of the\nYIG. Thermocouples are used to investigate the presence of these thermal\neffects and to quantify the magnitude of the Spin-(dependent-)Seebeck effect.\nSeveral additional features are observed, which are also discussed.\n", "  At variance with structural ferroic phase transitions which give rise to\nmacroscopic tensors coupled to macroscopic fields, criteria defining\nantiferroelectric (AFE) phase transitions are still under discussion due to the\nabsence of specific symmetry properties characterizing their existence. They\nare recognized by the proximity of a ferroelectric (FE) phase induced under\napplied electric field, with a double hysteresis loop relating the induced\npolarization to the electric field and a typical anomaly of the dielectric\npermittivity. Here, we show that there exist indeed symmetry criteria defining\nAFE transitions. They relate the local symmetry of the polar crystallographic\nsites emerging at an AFE phase transition with the macroscopic symmetry of the\nAFE phase. The dielectric properties of AFE transitions are deduced from a\nLandau theoretical model in which ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases are\nshown to stabilize as the result of specific symmetry-allowed couplings of the\nAFE order- parameter with the field-induced polarization.\n", "  In the context of (2+1)--dimensional SL(N,R)\\times SL(N,R) Chern-Simons\ntheory we explore issues related to regularity and asymptotics on the solid\ntorus, for stationary and circularly symmetric solutions. We display and solve\nall necessary conditions to ensure a regular metric and metric-like higher spin\nfields. We prove that holonomy conditions are necessary but not sufficient\nconditions to ensure regularity, and that Hawking conditions do not necessarily\nfollow from them. Finally we give a general proof that once the chemical\npotentials are turn on -- as demanded by regularity -- the asymptotics cannot\nbe that of Brown-Henneaux.\n", "  Developments in atom interferometry have led to atomic inertial sensors with\nextremely high sensitivity. Their performances are for the moment limited by\nthe ground vibrations, the impact of which is exacerbated by the sequential\noperation, resulting in aliasing and dead time. We discuss several experiments\nperformed at LNE-SYRTE in order to reduce these problems and achieve the\nintrinsic limit of atomic inertial sensors. These techniques have resulted in\ntransportable and high-performance instruments that participate in gravity\nmeasurements, and pave the way to applications in inertial navigation.\n", "  In this letter, we calculate the probability for resonantly induced\ntransitions in quantum states due to time dependent gravitational\nperturbations. Contrary to common wisdom, the probability of inducing\ntransitions is not infinitesimally small. We consider a system of ultra cold\nneutrons (UCN), which are organized according to the energy levels of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation in the presence of the earth's gravitational field.\nTransitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force\nof frequency $\\omega$. The driving force is created by oscillating a\nmacroscopic mass in the neighbourhood of the system of neutrons. The neutrons\ndecay in 880 seconds while the probability of transitions increase as $t^2$.\nHence the optimal strategy is to drive the system for 2 lifetimes. The\ntransition amplitude then is of the order of $1.06\\times 10^{-5}$ hence with a\nmillion ultra cold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.\n", "  It is known that the metric and Palatini formalisms of gravity theories have\ntheir own interesting features but also suffer from some different drawbacks.\nRecently, a novel gravity theory called hybrid metric-Palatini gravity was put\nforward to cure or improve their individual deficiencies. The action of this\ngravity theory is a hybrid combination of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action and\na $f(\\mathcal{R})$ term constructed by the Palatini formalism. Interestingly,\nit seems that the existence of a light and long-range scalar field in this\ngravity may modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics without conflicting\nwith the laboratory and Solar System tests. In this paper we focus on the\ntensor perturbation of thick branes in this novel gravity theory. We consider\ntwo models as examples, namely, the thick branes constructed by a background\nscalar field and by pure gravity. The thick branes in both models have no inner\nstructure. However, the graviton zero mode in the first model has inner\nstructure when the parameter in this model is larger than its critical value.\nWe find that the effective four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced on the\nbrane for both models. Moreover, the stability of both brane systems against\nthe tensor perturbation can also be ensured.\n", "  We build up a phenomenological picture in terms of the effective dynamics of\na tracer confined in a cage experiencing random hops to capture somec\nharacteristics of glassy systems. This minimal description exhibits scale\ninvariance properties for the small-displacement distribution that echo\nexperimental observations. We predict the existence of exponential tails as a\ncross-over between two Gaussian regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the\nonset of glassy behavior is controlled only by two dimensionless numbers: the\nnumber of hops occurring during the relaxation of the particle within a local\ncage, and the ratio of the hopping length to the cage size.\n", "  We study a polarizer-analyzer mounting for the terahertz regime with\nperfectly conducting metallic polarizers made of a periodic subwavelength\npattern. We analytically investigate the influence on the transmission response\nof the multiple reflections which occur between polarizer and analyzer with a\nrenewed Jones formalism. We demonstrate that this interaction leads to a\nmodified transmission response: the extended Malus' Law. In addition, we show\nthat the transmission response can be controlled by the distance between\npolarizer and analyzer. For particular set-ups, the mounting exhibits extremely\nsensitive transmission responses. This interesting feature can be employed for\nhigh precision sensing and characterization applications. We specifically\npropose a general design for measuring electro-optical response of materials in\nthe terahertz domain allowing detection of refractive index variations as small\nas $10^{-5}$.\n", "  Observations reveal that quasar host halos at z~2 have large covering\nfractions of cool dense gas (>~60% for Lyman limit systems within a projected\nvirial radius). Most simulations have so far have failed to explain these large\nobserved covering fractions. We analyze a new set of 15 simulated massive halos\nwith explicit stellar feedback from the FIRE project, covering the halo mass\nrange M_h~2x10^12-10^13 Msun at z=2. This extends our previous analysis of the\ncircum-galactic medium of high-redshift galaxies to more massive halos. AGN\nfeedback is not included in these simulations. We find Lyman limit system\ncovering fractions consistent with those observed around quasars. The large HI\ncovering fractions arise from star formation-driven galactic winds, including\nwinds from low-mass satellite galaxies that interact with cosmological\nfilaments. We show that it is necessary to resolve these satellite galaxies and\ntheir winds to reproduce the large Lyman limit system covering fractions\nobserved in quasar-mass halos. Our simulations predict that galaxies occupying\ndark matter halos of mass similar to quasars but without a luminous AGN should\nhave Lyman limit system covering fractions comparable to quasars.\n", "  Coherent spin-wave generation by focused ultrashort laser pulse irradiation\nwas investigated for a permalloy thin film at micrometer scale using an\nall-optical space and time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The spin-wave\npacket propagating perpendicular to magnetization direction was clearly\nobserved, however that propagating parallel to the magnetization direction was\nnot observed. The propagation length, group velocity, center frequency, and\npacket-width of the observed spin-wave packet were evaluated and quantitatively\nexplained in terms of the propagation of a magneto-static spin-wave driven by\nultrafast change of an out-of-plane demagnetization field induced by the\nfocused-pulse laser.\n", "  Arrays of coupled photonic cavities driven by external lasers represent a\nhighly controllable setup to explore photonic transport. In this paper we\naddress (quasi)-steady states of this system that exhibit photonic currents\nintroduced by engineering driving and dissipation. We investigate two\napproaches: in the first one, photonic currents arise as a consequence of a\nphase difference of applied lasers and in the second one, photons are injected\nlocally and currents develop as they redistribute over the lattice. Effects of\ninteractions are taken into account within a mean-field framework. In the first\napproach, we find that the current exhibits a resonant behavior with respect to\nthe driving frequency. Weak interactions shift the resonant frequency toward\nhigher values, while in the strongly interacting regime in our mean-field\ntreatment the effect stems from multiphotonic resonances of a single driven\ncavity. For the second approach, we show that the overall lattice current can\nbe controlled by incorporating few cavities with stronger dissipation rates\ninto the system. These cavities serve as sinks for photonic currents and their\neffect is maximal at the onset of quantum Zeno dynamics.\n", "  This paper identifies two ways to extract the energy (or power) flowing into\na crack tip during propagation based on the power balance of areas enclosed by\na stationary contour and a comoving contour. It is very interesting to find a\ncontradiction that two corresponding energy release rates (ERRs), a\nsurface-forming ERR and a local ERR, are different when stress singularity\nexists at a crack tip. Besides a rigorous mathematical interpretation, we\ndeduce that the stress singularity leads to an accompanying kinetic energy at\nthe crack tip. The local ERR represents the driving force to overcome the\nsurface energy and the accompanying kinetic energy, while the surface-forming\nERR represents the driving force to overcome the surface energy only. Their\nadvantages and disadvantages are discussed. We recommend using the\nsurface-forming ERR based fracture criterion for a crack propagation in\nelastic-plastic materials, since it has a wide applicability and concise\nformulae which are easy to compute among all energy based criteria.\n", "  $f(R)$ modifications of Einstein's gravity is an interesting possibility to\nexplain the late time acceleration of the Universe. In this work we explore the\ncosmological viability of one such $f(R)$ modification proposed in\n(Kruglov:2013). We show that the model violates fifth-force constraints. The\nmodel is also plagued with the issue of curvature singularity in a spherically\ncollapsing object, where the effective scalar field reaches to the point of\ndiverging scalar curvature.\n", "  Rank-d Tensorial Group Field Theories are quantum field theories defined on a\ngroup manifold $G^{\\times d}$, which represent a non-local generalization of\nstandard QFT, and a candidate formalism for quantum gravity, since, when\nendowed with appropriate data, they can be interpreted as defining a field\ntheoretic description of the fundamental building blocks of quantum spacetime.\nTheir renormalisation analysis is crucial both for establishing their\nconsistency as quantum field theories, and for studying the emergence of\ncontinuum spacetime and geometry from them. In this paper, we study the\nrenormalisation group flow of two simple classes of TGFTs, defined for the\ngroup $G=\\mathbb{R}$ for arbitrary rank, both without and with gauge invariance\nconditions, by means of functional renormalisation group techniques. The issue\nof IR divergences is tackled by the definition of a proper thermodynamic limit\nfor TGFTs. We map the phase diagram of such models, in a simple truncation, and\nidentify both UV and IR fixed points of the RG flow. Encouragingly, for all the\nmodels we study, we find evidence for the existence of a phase transition of\ncondensation type.\n", "  Venus currently rotates slowly, with its spin controlled by solid-body and\natmospheric thermal tides. However, conditions may have been far different 4\nbillion years ago, when the Sun was fainter and most of the carbon within Venus\ncould have been in solid form, implying a low-mass atmosphere. We investigate\nhow the obliquity would have varied for a hypothetical rapidly rotating Early\nVenus. The obliquity variation structure of an ensemble of hypothetical Early\nVenuses is simpler than that Earth would have if it lacked its large Moon\n(Lissauer et al., 2012), having just one primary chaotic regime at high\nprograde obliquities. We note an unexpected long-term variability of up to\n$\\pm7^\\circ$ for retrograde Venuses. Low-obliquity Venuses show very low total\nobliquity variability over billion-year timescales -- comparable to that of the\nreal Moon-influenced Earth.\n", "  A consistent derivation of the equations of motion (EOMs) of test particles\nfor solving the spin-dependent Boltzmann-Vlasov equation is presented. The\nresulting EOMs in phase space are similar to the canonical equations in\nHamiltonian dynamics, and the EOM of spin is the same as that in the Heisenburg\npicture of quantum mechanics. Considering further the quantum nature of spin\nand choosing the direction of total angular momentum in heavy-ion reactions as\na reference of measuring nucleon spin, the EOMs of spin-up and spin-down\nnucleons are given separately. The key elements affecting the spin dynamics in\nheavy-ion collisions are identified. The resulting EOMs provide a solid\nfoundation for using the test-particle approach in studying spin dynamics in\nheavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies. Future comparisons of model\nsimulations with experimental data will help constrain the poorly known\nin-medium nucleon spin-orbit coupling relevant for understanding properties of\nrare isotopes and their astrophysical impacts.\n", "  Social scientists have criticised computer models of pedestrian streams for\ntheir treatment of psychological crowds as mere aggregations of individuals.\nIndeed most models for evacuation dynamics use analogies from physics where\npedestrians are considered as particles. Although this ensures that the results\nof the simulation match important physical phenomena, such as the deceleration\nof the crowd with increasing density, social phenomena such as group processes\nare ignored. In particular, people in a crowd have social identities and share\nthose social identities with the others in the crowd. The process of self\ncategorisation determines norms within the crowd and influences how people will\nbehave in evacuation situations. We formulate the application of social\nidentity in pedestrian simulation algorithmically. The goal is to examine\nwhether it is possible to carry over the psychological model to computer models\nof pedestrian motion so that simulation results correspond to observations from\ncrowd psychology. That is, we quantify and formalise empirical research on and\nverbal descriptions of the effect of group identity on behaviour. We use\nuncertainty quantification to analyse the model's behaviour when we vary\ncrucial model parameters. In this first approach we restrict ourselves to a\nspecific scenario that was thoroughly investigated by crowd psychologists and\nwhere some quantitative data is available: the bombing and subsequent\nevacuation of a London underground tube carriage on July 7th 2005.\n", "  Space-based photometric telescopes stirred up stellar astrophysics in the\nlast decade, and RR Lyrae stars have not been an exception from that either.\nThe long, quasi-continuous, high-precision data from MOST, CoRoT and Kepler\nrevealed a wealth of new insights about this well-known variable class. One of\nthe most surprising mysteries turned out to be the apparent omnipresence of a\ncommon additional mode in all RRd and RRc stars. Moreover, fundamental-mode\nstars seem to populate two distinct classes, one of which is characterized by\nthe presence of additional modes and/or modulation, and another limited to\nstrict single-mode pulsation. The presence of additional modes and multiple\nmodulations in RRab stars allowed us to construct Petersen diagrams for these\nparameters: while the pulsation modes show clear structures according to period\nratios, there seems to be no relation between the modulation periods\nthemselves.\n", "  The number of charged particles inside jets is a widely used discriminant for\nidentifying the quark or gluon nature of the initiating parton and is sensitive\nto both the perturbative and non-perturbative components of fragmentation. This\npaper presents a measurement of the average number of charged particles with\n$p_\\text{T}>500$ MeV inside high-momentum jets in dijet events using 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ of data recorded with the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collisions at the LHC. The jets considered have transverse\nmomenta from 50 GeV up to and beyond 1.5 TeV. The reconstructed\ncharged-particle track multiplicity distribution is unfolded to remove\ndistortions from detector effects and the resulting charged-particle\nmultiplicity is compared to several models. Furthermore, quark and gluon jet\nfractions are used to extract the average charged-particle multiplicity for\nquark and gluon jets separately.\n", "  The penetrating nature of electromagnetic signals makes them suitable probes\nto explore the properties of the strongly-interacting medium created in\nrelativistic nuclear collisions. We examine the effects of the initial\nconditions and shear relaxation time on the spectra and flow coefficients of\nelectromagnetic probes, using an event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic\nsimulation (MUSIC).\n", "  The magnetoelectric effect predicted in topological insulators makes\nheterostructures that combine magnetic materials and such insulators promising\ncandidates for spintronics applications. Here, we theoretically consider a\nsetup that exhibits two well-separated interfaces between a topological\ninsulator and a ferromagnetic insulator. We show that there is a topological\nmagnetic dipole-dipole interaction stemming from long-range Coulomb\ninteractions. We analytically derive the magnetization dynamics at the two\ninterfaces and discuss how the long-range coupling can be applied to\nnon-locally induce the formation of a magnetic texture at one interface by\nsuitably gating the other interface.\n", "  We study the role of dipolar interactions in the standard protocol used to\nachieve dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In the so-called spin-temperature\nregime, where the interactions establish an effective thermodynamic behavior in\nthe out-of-equilibrium stationary state, we provide numerical predictions for\nthe level of hyperpolarization. We show that nuclear spins equilibrate to the\neffective spin-temperature established among the electron spins of radicals, as\nexpected from the quantum theory of thermalization. Moreover, we present an\nanalytical technique to estimate the spin temperature, and thus, the nuclear\nhyperpolarization in the steady state, as a function of interaction strength\nand quenched disorder. This reproduces both our numerical data and experimental\nresults. Our central finding is that the nuclear hyperpolarization increases\nsteadily upon reducing the interaction strength (by diluting the radical\ndensity). Interestingly, the highest polarization is reached at a point where\nthe establishment of a spin temperature is just about to break down due to the\nincipient many-body localization transition in the electron spin system.\n", "  Resolving the interplay between magnetic interactions and structural\nproperties in strongly correlated materials through a quantitatively accurate\napproach has been a major challenge in condensed matter physics. Here we apply\nhighly accurate first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to obtain\nstructural and magnetic properties of the iron selenide (FeSe) superconductor\nunder pressure. Where comparable, the computed properties are very close to the\nexperimental values. Of potential ordered magnetic configurations, collinear\nspin configurations are the most energetically favorable over the explored\npressure range. They become nearly degenerate in energy with bicollinear spin\norderings at around 7 GPa, when the experimental critical temperature $T_c$ is\nthe highest. On the other hand, ferromagnetic, checkerboard, and staggered\ndimer configurations become relatively higher in energy as the pressure\nincreases. The behavior under pressure is explained by an accurate analysis of\nthe charge compressibility and the orbital occupation as described by the QMC\nmany-body wave function, which reveals how spin, charge and orbital degrees of\nfreedom are strongly coupled in this compound. This remarkable pressure\nevolution suggests that stripe-like magnetic fluctuations may be responsible\nfor the enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe and that higher T$_c$ is associated with\nnearness to a crossover between collinear and bicollinear ordering.\n", "  We present a theory of electron scattring on a magnetic skyrmion for the case\nwhen exchange interaction is moderate so that adiabatic approximation and Berry\nphase approach is not applicable. The theory explains the appearance of a\ntopological Hall current in the systems with magnetic skyrmions, of a special\nimportance its applicability to dilute magnetic semiconductors with a weak\nexchange interaction.\n", "  We discuss a possibility to explain the LHC diphoton excesses at $750$GeV by\nthe new scalar $X$ that couples to the gauge bosons through the loop of new\nmassive particles with Standard Model charges. We assume that the new particles\ndecay into the Standard Model particles at the tree level. We systematically\nexamine the models that preserve the vacuum stability and the perturbativity up\nto the Planck scale. When we take scalars for the new particles, we find that\nonly a few diquark and dilepton models can explain the observed diphoton cross\nsection without conflicting the experimental mass bounds. When we take\nvector-like fermions for the new particles, we find rather different situations\ndepending on whether their couplings to $X$ are scalar or pseudoscalar type. In\nthe former case, a few models are allowed if we introduce only one species of\nfermions. The more fermions we introduce, the more models are allowed. In the\nlater case, the most of the models are allowed because of the large coupling\nbetween $X$ and photon. It is interesting that the allowed mass regions of the\nscalar particles might be reached by the next lepton colliders.\n", "  We propose a method to perform single-shot optical readout of a quantum bit\n(qubit) using cavity quantum electrodynamics. We selectively couple the optical\ntransitions associated with different qubit basis states to the cavity, and\nutilize the change in cavity transmissivity to generate a qubit readout signal\ncomposed of many photons. We show that this approach enables single-shot\noptical readout even when the qubit does not have a good cycling transition\nrequired for standard resonance fluorescence measurements. We calculate the\nprobability that the measurement detects the correct spin state using the\nexample of a quantum dot spin under various experimental conditions and\ndemonstrate that it can exceed 0.99.\n", "  The merger of two massive 30 Msun black holes has been detected in\ngravitational waves (1,GW150914). This discovery validates recent predictions\n(2-4) that massive binary black holes would constitute the first detection.\nHowever, previous calculations have not sampled the relevant binary black hole\nprogenitors---massive, low-metallicity binary stars---with sufficient accuracy\nand input physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of\nmagnitude (5-10). Here we report a suite of high-precision numerical\nsimulations of binary black hole formation via the evolution of isolated binary\nstars, providing a framework to interpret GW150914 and predict the properties\nof subsequent binary black hole gravitational-wave events. Our models imply\nthat these events form in an environment where the metallicity is less than 10\npercent of solar; have initial masses of 40-100 Msun; and interact through mass\ntransfer and a common envelope phase. Their progenitors likely form either at 2\nGyr, or somewhat less likely, at 11 Gyr after the Big Bang. Most binary black\nholes form without supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged\nsince birth, but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of\nbinary black holes proposed in this study, with low natal kicks and restricted\ncommon envelope evolution, produces 40 times more binary black holes than\ndynamical formation channels involving globular clusters (11) and is comparable\nto the rate from homogeneous evolution channels (12-15). Our calculations\npredict detections of about 1,000 black hole mergers per year with total mass\nof 20-80 Msun once second generation ground-based gravitational wave\nobservatories reach full sensitivity.\n", "  The most observable leakage radiation from an advanced civilization may well\nbe from the use of power beaming to transfer energy and accelerate spacecraft.\nApplications suggested for power beaming involve launching spacecraft to orbit,\nraising satellites to a higher orbit, and interplanetary concepts involving\nspace-to-space transfers of cargo or passengers. We also quantify beam-driven\nlaunch to the outer solar system, interstellar precursors and ultimately\nstarships. We estimate the principal observable parameters of power beaming\nleakage. Extraterrestrial civilizations would know their power beams could be\nobserved, and so could put a message on the power beam and broadcast it for our\nreceipt at little additional energy or cost. By observing leakage from power\nbeams we may find a message embedded on the beam. Recent observations of the\nanomalous star KIC8462852 by the Allen Telescope Array set some limits on\nextraterrestrial power beaming in that system. We show that most power beaming\napplications commensurate with those suggested for our solar system would be\ndetectable if using the frequency range monitored by the ATA, and so the lack\nof detection is a meaningful, if modest, constraint on extraterrestrial power\nbeaming in that system. Until more extensive observations are made, the limited\nobservation time and frequency coverage are not sufficiently broad in frequency\nand duration to produce firm conclusions. Such beams would be visible over\nlarge interstellar distances. This implies a new approach to the SETI search:\nInstead of focusing on narrowband beacon transmissions generated by another\ncivilization, look for more powerful beams with much wider bandwidth. This\nrequires a new approach for their discovery by telescopes on Earth. Further\nstudies of power beaming applications should be done, which could broaden the\nparameter space of observable features we have discussed here.\n", "  We model the possible afterglow of the Fermi GBM event associated with LIGO\ndetection GW150914, under the assumption that the gamma-ray are produced by a\nshort GRB-like relativistic outflow. We model GW150914-GBM as both a weak,\non-axis short GRB and normal short GRB seen far off axis. Given the large\nuncertainty in the position of GW150914, we determine that the best chance of\nfinding the afterglow is with ASKAP or possibly the MWA, with the flux from an\noff-axis short GRB reaching 0.2 - 4 mJy (0.12 - 16 mJy) at 150 MHz (863.5 MHz)\nby 1 - 12 months after the initial event. At low frequencies, the source would\nevolve from a hard to soft spectrum over several months. The radio afterglow\nwould be detectable for several months to years after it peaks, meaning the\nafterglow may still be detectable and increasing in brightness NOW (mid-July\n2016). With a localization from the MWA or ASKAP, the afterglow would be\ndetectable at higher radio frequencies with the ATCA and in X-rays with Chandra\nor XMM.\n", "  We present an efficient framework to numerically treat infinite periodic\nvortex lattices in rotating superfluids described by the Gross-Pitaevskii\ntheory. The commonly used split-step Fourier (SSF) spectral methods are\ninapplicable to such systems as the standard Fourier transform does not respect\nthe boundary conditions mandated by the magnetic translation group. We present\na generalisation of the SSF method which incorporates the correct boundary\nconditions by employing the so-called magnetic Fourier transform. We test the\nmethod and show that it reduces to known results in the lowest-Landau-level\nregime. While we focus on rotating scalar superfluids for simplicity, the\nframework can be naturally extended to treat multicomponent systems and systems\nunder more general `synthetic' gauge fields.\n", "  We present the first data release (DR1) from our UV-bright Quasar Survey\n(UVQS) for new $z \\sim 1$ active galactic nuclei (AGN) across the sky. Using\nsimple GALEX UV and WISE near-IR color selection criteria, we generated a list\nof 1450 primary candidates with $FUV < 18.5$ mag. We obtained discovery\nspectra, primarily on 3m-class telescopes, for 1040 of these candidates and\nconfirmed 86% as AGN with redshifts generally at $z>0.5$. Including a small set\nof observed secondary candidates, we report the discovery of 217 AGN with $FUV\n< 18$ mag that had no previously reported spectroscopic redshift. These are\nexcellent potential targets for UV spectroscopy before the end of the {\\it\nHubble Space Telescope} mission. The main data products are publicly released\nthrough the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.\n", "  The phonon dispersion unfolding method is useful for obtaining hidden Bloch\nsymmetries and comparing theoretical results with experiment spectrums (e.g.,\ninelastic neutron scattering, inelastic X-ray scattering, Raman). In this\npaper, we propose a method to unfold phonon dispersions. The main advantage of\nthis method is the ability to handle systems with heavy breaking of spatial\ntranslational symmetry. Its validity is tested by pure diamond, diamond with Si\nsubstitution, and diamond with C vacancies.\n", "  We report results from a series of three-dimensional (3D) rotational\ncore-collapse simulations for $11.2$ and 27 $M_{/odot}$ stars employing\nneutrino transport scheme by the isotropic diffusion source approximation. By\nchanging the initial strength of rotation systematically, we find a\nrotation-assisted explosion for the 27$M_{/odot}$ progenitor, which fails in\nthe absence of rotation. The unique feature was not captured in previous\ntwo-dimensional (2D) self-consistent rotating models because the growing\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities play a key role. In the rapidly rotating case,\nstrong spiral flows generated by the so-called low $T/|W|$ instability enhance\nthe energy transport from the proto-neutron star (PNS) to the gain region,\nwhich makes the shock expansion more energetic. The explosion occurs more\nstrongly in the direction perpendicular to the rotational axis, which is\ndifferent from previous 2D predictions.\n", "  We have uncovered a giant gyrotropic magneto-optical response for doped\nferromagnetic manganite La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 around the near room-temperature\nparamagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition. At odds with current wisdom, where\nthis response is usually assumed to be fundamentally fixed by the electronic\nband structure, we point to the presence of small polarons as the driving force\nfor this unexpected phenomenon. We explain the observed properties by the\nintricate interplay of mobility, Jahn-Teller effect and spin-orbit coupling of\nsmall polarons. As magnetic polarons are ubiquitously inherent to many strongly\ncorrelated systems, our results provide an original, general pathway towards\nthe generation of gigantic gyrotropic responses that can be harnessed for\nnonreciprocal devices that exploit the polarization of light.\n", "  The Kuiper belt is a population of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.\nThe complex orbital structure of the Kuiper belt, including several categories\nof objects inside and outside of resonances with Neptune, emerged as a result\nof Neptune's migration into an outer planetesimal disk. An outstanding problem\nwith the existing migration models is that they invariably predict excessively\nlarge resonant populations, while observations show that the non-resonant\norbits are in fact common (e.g., the main belt population is 2-4 times larger\nthan Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance). Here we show that this problem can\nresolved if it is assumed that Neptune's migration was grainy, as expected from\nscattering encounters of Neptune with massive planetesimals. The grainy\nmigration acts to destabilize resonant bodies with large libration amplitudes,\na fraction of which ends up on stable non-resonant orbits. Thus, the\nnon-resonant--to--resonant ratio obtained with the grainy migration is higher,\nup to ~10 times higher for the range of parameters investigated here, than in a\nmodel with smooth migration. The grainy migration leads to a narrower\ndistribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance. The best fit to\nobservations is obtained when it is assumed that the outer planetesimal disk\nbelow 30 AU contained 1000-4000 Plutos, or ~1000 bodies twice as massive as\nPluto. We find that the probability for an outer disk object to end up on a\nstable orbit in the Kuiper belt is ~10^{-3}. Together, these results are\nconsistent with having only two (known) Pluto-mass bodies in the Kuiper belt\ntoday (Pluto and Eris). The combined mass of Pluto-class objects in the\noriginal disk was ~2-8 Earth masses (M_Earth), which represents 10-40% of the\nestimated disk mass (M_disk ~ 20 M_Earth).\n", "  The dynamics of a pair of three-dimensional matter-wave harmonic oscillators\n(HOs) coupled by a repulsive cubic nonlinearity is investigated through direct\nsimulations of the respective GrossPitaevskii equations (GPEs) and with the\nhelp of the finite-mode Galerkin approximation (GA),which represents the two\ninteracting wave functions by a superposition of 3 + 3 HO p -wave\neigenfunctions with orbital and magnetic quantum numbers l = 1 and m = 1; 0; 1.\nFirst, the GA very accurately predicts a broadly degenerate set of the system's\nground states in the p -wave manifold, in the form of complexes built of a\ndipole coaxial with another dipole or vortex, as well as complexes built of\nmutually orthogonal dipoles. Next, pairs of non-coaxial vortices and/or\ndipoles, including pairs of mutually perpendicular vortices, develop remarkably\nstable dynamical regimes, which feature periodic exchange of the angular\nmomentum and periodic switching between dipoles and vortices. For a moderately\nstrong nonlinearity, simulations of the coupled GPEs agree very well with\nresults produced by the GA, demonstrating that the dynamics is accurately\nspanned by the set of six modes limited to l = 1.\n", "  High level of dissipation in normal metals makes challenging development of\nactive and passive plasmonic devices. One possible solution to this problem is\nto use alternative materials. Graphene is a good candidate for plasmonics in\nnear infrared (IR) region. In this paper we develop quantum theory of a\ngraphene plasmon generator. We account for the first time quantum correlations\nand dissipation effects that allows describing such regimes of quantum\nplasmonic amplifier as surface plasmon emitting diode and surface plasmon\namplifier by stimulated emission of radiation. Switching between these\ngeneration types is possible in situ with variance of graphene Fermi-level or\ngain transition frequency. We provide explicit expressions for dissipation and\ninteraction constants through material parameters and find the generation\nspectrum and correlation function of second order which predicts laser\nstatistics.\n", "  The proton radius puzzle, i.e. the large discrepancy in the extraction of the\nproton charge radius between regular and muonic hydrogen, challenges our\nunderstanding of the structure of the proton. It can also be an indication of a\nnew force that couples to muons, but not to electrons. An effective field\ntheory analysis using Non Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (NRQED)\nindicates that the muonic hydrogen result can be interpreted as a large,\ncompared to some model estimates, muon-proton spin-independent contact\ninteraction. The muonic hydrogen result can be tested by a muon-proton\nscattering experiment, MUSE, that is planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute in\nSwitzerland. The typical momenta of the muons in this experiment are of the\norder of the muon mass. In this energy regime the muons are relativistic but\nthe protons are still non-relativistic. The interaction between the muons and\nprotons can be described by a hybrid QED-NRQED effective field theory. We\npresent some elements of this effective field theory. In particular we consider\n${\\cal O}(Z\\alpha)$ scattering up to power $m^2/M^2$, where $m$ ($M$) is the\nmuon (proton) mass and $Z=1$ for a proton, and ${\\cal O}(Z^2\\alpha^2)$\nscattering at leading power. We show how the former reproduces Rosenbluth\nscattering up to power $m^2/M^2$ and the latter the relativistic scattering off\na static potential. Proton structure corrections at ${\\cal O}(Z^2\\alpha^2)$\nwill be considered in a subsequent paper.\n", "  We numerically study the propagation of a few-cycle pulse carrying orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) through a dense atomic system. Nonlinear precursors\nconsisting of high-order vortex har- monics are generated in the transmitted\nfield due to ultrafast Bloch oscillation. The nonlinear precursors survive to\npropagation effects and are well separated with the main pulse, which provide a\nstraightforward way of measuring precursors. By the virtue of carrying\nhigh-order OAM, the obtained vortex precursors as information carriers have\npotential applications in optical informa- tion and communication fields where\ncontrollable loss, large information-carrying capacity and high speed\ncommunication are required.\n", "  The explicit solution for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in an external\nmagnetic field, sometimes called the Melvin-Kerr-Newman black hole, has been\nderived by Ernst and Wild in 1976. In this paper, we clarify the first law and\nSmarr formula for black holes in a magnetic field. We then define the unique\nmass which is integrable and reduces to the Kerr-Newman mass in the absence of\nmagnetic field. This defines the thermodynamic potentials of the black hole.\nQuite strikingly, the mass coincides with the standard Christodoulou-Ruffini\nmass of a black hole as a function of the entropy, angular momentum and\nelectric charge.\n", "  The spatial development of hadronic showers in the CALICE scintillator-steel\nanalogue hadron calorimeter is studied using test beam data collected at CERN\nand FNAL for single positive pions and protons with initial momenta in the\nrange from 10 to 80 GeV/c. Both longitudinal and radial development of hadron\nshowers are parametrised with two-component functions. The parametrisation is\nfit to test beam data and simulations using the QGSP_BERT and FTFP_BERT physics\nlists from Geant4 version 9.6. The parameters extracted from data and simulated\nsamples are compared for the two types of hadrons. The response to pions and\nthe ratio of the non-electromagnetic to the electromagnetic calorimeter\nresponse, h/e, are estimated using the extrapolation and decomposition of the\nlongitudinal profiles.\n", "  In the CMSSM the heaviest scalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons decay largely\ninto b-quarks and tau-leptons because of the large $\\tan\\beta$ values favored\nby the relic density. In the NMSSM the number of possible decay modes is much\nricher. In addition to the CMSSM-like scenarios, the decay of the heavy Higgs\nbosons is preferentially into top quark pairs (if kinematically allowed),\nlighter Higgs bosons or neutralinos, leading to invisible decays. We provide a\nscan over the NMSSM parameter space to project the 6D parameter space of the\nHiggs sector on the 3D space of the Higgs masses to determine the range of\nbranching ratios as function of the Higgs boson mass for all Higgs bosons.\nSpecific LHC benchmark points are proposed, which represent the salient NMSSM\nfeatures.\n", "  The $\\alpha$ cluster states are discussed in a model frame of extended\nquantum molecular dynamics. Different alpha cluster structures are studied in\ndetails, such as $^8$Be two-$\\alpha$ cluster structure, $^{12}$C triangle\nstructure, $^{12}$C chain structure, $^{16}$O chain structure, $^{16}$O kite\nstructure, and $^{16}$O square structure. The properties studied, include as\nthe width of wave packets for different $\\alpha$ clusters, momentum\ndistribution, and the binding energy among $\\alpha$ clusters. It is also\ndiscussed how the $\\alpha$ cluster degree of freedom affects nuclear collective\nvibrations. The cluster configurations in $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O are found to\nhave corresponding characteristic spectra of giant dipole resonance (GDR), and\nthe coherences of different $\\alpha$ clusters's dipole oscillation are\ndescribed in details. The geometrical and dynamical symmetries of\n$\\alpha$-clustering configurations are responsible for the number and centroid\nenergies of peaks of GDR spectra. Therefore, the GDR can be regarded as an\neffective probe to diagnose different $\\alpha$ cluster configurations in light\nnuclei.\n", "  We study the collective dephasing process of a system of non-interacting\natomic qubits, immersed in a spatially uniform magnetic field of fluctuating\nintensity. The correlation properties of bipartite states are analysed based on\na geometric representation of the state space. Particular emphasis is put on\nthe dephasing-assisted generation of states with a high correlation rank, which\ncan be related to discord-type correlations and allow for direct applications\nin quantum information theory. Finally we study the conditions that ensure the\nrobustness of initial entanglement and discuss the phenomenon of time-invariant\nentanglement.\n", "  We study the diphoton excesses near $750$ GeV recently reported by the ATLAS\nand CMS collaborations within the context of a phenomenologically interesting\nintersecting/magnetized D-brane model on a toroidal orientifold. It is shown\nthat the model contains a SM singlet scalar as well as vector-like quarks and\nleptons. In addition, it is shown that the singlet scalar has Yukawa couplings\nwith vector-like quarks and leptons such that it may be produced in\nproton-proton collisions via gluon fusion as well as decay to diphotons through\nloops involving the vector-like quarks. Moreover, the required vector-like\nquarks and leptons may appear in complete $SU(5)$ multiplets so that gauge\ncoupling unification may be maintained. Finally, it is shown that the diphoton\nsignal may be explained within the model.\n", "  We analyzed a sample of 9418 fundamental-mode and first-overtone Classical\nCepheids from the OGLE-IV Collection of Classical Cepheids. The distance to\neach Cepheid was calculated using the period-luminosity relation for the\nWesenheit magnitude, fitted to our data.\n  The classical Cepheids in the LMC are situated mainly in the bar and in the\nnorthern arm. The eastern part of the LMC is closer to us and the plane fit to\nthe whole LMC sample yields the inclination $i=24.2\\pm0.7$ deg and position\nangle ${\\rm P.A.}=151.4\\pm1.7$ deg. We redefined the LMC bar by extending it in\nthe western direction and found no offset from the plane of the LMC contrary to\nprevious studies. On the other hand, we found that the northern arm is offset\nfrom a plane by about $-0.5$ kpc, which was not observed before. The age\ndistribution of the LMC Cepheids shows one maximum at about 100 Myr.\n  We demonstrate that the SMC has a non-planar structure and can be described\nas an extended ellipsoid. We identified two large ellipsoidal off-axis\nstructures in the SMC. The northern one is located closer to us and is younger,\nwhile the south-western is farther and older. The age distribution of the SMC\nCepheids is bimodal with one maximum at 110 Myr, and another one at 220 Myr.\nYounger stars are located in the closer part of this galaxy while older ones\nare more distant.\n  We classified nine Cepheids from our sample as Magellanic Bridge objects.\nThese Cepheids show a large spread in three-dimensions although five of them\nform a connection between the Clouds. The closest one is closer than any of the\nLMC Cepheids, while the farthest one -- farther than any SMC Cepheid. All but\none Cepheids in the Magellanic Bridge are younger than 300 Myr. The oldest one\ncan be associated with the SMC Wing.\n", "  We study the applicability of collisional models for non-Markovian dynamics\nof open quantum systems. By allowing interactions between the separate\nenvironmental degrees of freedom in between collisions we are able to construct\na collision model that allows to study quantum memory effects in open system\ndynamics. We also discuss the possibility to embed non-Markovian collision\nmodel dynamics into Markovian collision model dynamics in an extended state\nspace. As a concrete example we show how using the proposed class of collision\nmodels we can discretely model non- Markovian amplitude damping of a qubit. In\nthe time-continuous limit, we obtain the well-known results for spontaneous\ndecay of a two level system in to a structured zero-temperature reservoir\n", "  Time-of-flight three dimensional imaging is an important tool for many\napplications, such as object recognition and remote sensing. Unlike\nconventional imaging approach using pixelated detector array, single-pixel\nimaging based on projected patterns, such as Hadamard patterns, utilises an\nalternative strategy to acquire information with sampling basis. Here we show a\nmodified single-pixel camera using a pulsed illumination source and a\nhigh-speed photodiode, capable of reconstructing 128x128 pixel resolution 3D\nscenes to an accuracy of ~3 mm at a range of ~5 m. Furthermore, we demonstrate\ncontinuous real-time 3D video with a frame-rate up to 12 Hz. The simplicity of\nthe system hardware could enable low-cost 3D imaging devices for precision\nranging at wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum.\n", "  Spin current injection and spin accumulation near a ferromagnetic insulator\n(FI)/nonmagnetic metal (NM) bilayer film under a thermal gradient is\ninvestigated theoretically. Using the Fermi golden rule and the Boltzmann\nequations, we find that FI and NM can exchange spins via interfacial\nelectron-magnon scattering because of the imbalance between magnon emission and\nabsorption caused by either non-equilibrium distribution of magnons or\nnon-equilibrium between magnons and electrons. A temperature gradient in FI\nand/or a temperature difference across the FI/NM interface generates a spin\ncurrent which carries angular momenta parallel to the magnetization of FI from\nthe hotter side to the colder one. Interestingly, the spin current induced by a\ntemperature gradient in NM is negligibly small due to the nonmagnetic nature of\nthe non-equilibrium electron distributions. The results agree well with all\nexisting experiments.\n", "  We study spontaneous dimerization transitions in a Heisenberg spin-1 chain\nwith additional next-nearest neighbor (NNN) and 3-site interactions using\nextensive numerical simulations and a conformal field theory analysis. We show\nthat the transition can be second order in the WZW SU(2)$_2$ or Ising\nuniversality class, or first-order. We argue that these features are generic\nbecause of a marginal operator in the WZW SU(2)$_2$ model, and because of two\ntopologically distinct non-dimerized phases with or without edge states. We\nalso provide explicit numerical evidence of conformal towers of singlets inside\nthe spin gap at the Ising transition. Implications for other models are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We explore the emergence of chiral magnetism in one-dimensional monatomic Mn,\nFe, and Co chains deposited at the Pt(664) step-edge carrying out an ab-initio\nstudy based on density functional theory (DFT). The results are analyzed\nemploying several models: (i) a micromagnetic model, which takes into account\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) besides the spin stiffness and the\nmagnetic anisotropy energy, and (ii) the Fert-Levy model of the DMI for diluted\nmagnetic impurities in metals. Due to the step-edge geometry, the direction of\nthe Dzyaloshinskii vector (D-vector) is not predetermined by symmetry and\npoints in an off-symmetry direction. For the Mn chain we predict a long-period\ncycloidal spin-spiral ground state of unique rotational sense on top of an\notherwise atomic-scale antiferromagnetic phase. The spins rotate in a plane\nthat is tilted relative to the Pt surface by $62^\\circ$ towards the upper step\nof the surface. The Fe and Co chains show a ferromagnetic ground state since\nthe DMI is too weak to overcome their respective magnetic anisotropy barriers.\nBeyond the discussion of the monatomic chains we provide general expressions\nrelating ab-initio results to realistic model parameters that occur in a\nspin-lattice or in a micromagnetic model. We prove that a planar homogeneous\nspiral of classical spins with a given wave vector rotating in a plane whose\nnormal is parallel to the D-vector is an exact stationary state solution of a\nspin-lattice model for a periodic solid that includes Heisenberg exchange and\nDMI. The validity of the Fert-Levy model for the evaluation of micromagnetic\nDMI parameters and for the analysis of ab-initio calculations is explored for\nchains. The results suggest that some care has to be taken when applying the\nmodel to infinite periodic one-dimensional systems.\n", "  In the broad line region of AGN, acceleration occurs naturally when a cloud\ncondenses out of the hot confining medium due to the increase in line opacity\nas the cloud cools. However, acceleration by radiation pressure is not very\nefficient when the flux is time-independent, unless the flow is\none-dimensional. Here we explore how acceleration is affected by a time-varying\nflux, as AGN are known to be highly variable. If the period of flux\noscillations is longer than the thermal timescale, we expect the gas to cool\nduring the low flux state, and therefore line opacity should quickly increase.\nThe cloud will receive a small kick due to the increased radiation force. We\nperform hydrodynamical simulations using Athena to confirm this effect and\nquantify its importance. We find that despite the flow becoming turbulent in 2D\ndue to hydrodynamic instabilities, a 20% modulation of the flux leads to a net\nincrease in acceleration --- by more than a factor of 2 --- in both 1D and 2D.\nWe show that this is sufficient to produce the observed line widths, although\nwe only consider optically thin clouds. We discuss the implications of our\nresults for photoionization modeling and reverberation mapping.\n", "  We study the details and time dependence of particle production in nuclear\ncollisions at a fixed target beam energy of $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}= 1.76$ A GeV with\nthe UrQMD transport model. We find that the previously proposed production\nmechanism for multi strange hadrons, $\\phi$ and $\\Xi$, are possible due to\nsecondary interactions of incoming nuclei of the projectile and target with\nalready created nuclear resonances, while the Fermi momenta of the nuclei play\nonly a minor role. We also show how the centrality dependence of these particle\nmultiplicities can be used to confirm the proposed mechanism, as it strongly\ndepends on the number of participants in the reaction. Furthermore we\ninvestigate the time dependence of particle production in collisions of Ca+Ca\nat this beam energy, in order to understand the origins of the apparent\nchemical equilibration of the measured particle yields. We find that indeed the\nlight hadron yields appear to be in equilibrium already from the very early\nstage of the collision while in fact no local equilibration, through multi\ncollision processes, takes place. The apparent equilibrium is reached only\nthrough the decay of the resonances according to available phase space.\n", "  We measured the binding energy of N$_2$, CO, O$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$ on\nnon-porous (compact) amorphous solid water (np-ASW), of N$_2$ and CO on porous\namorphous solid water (p-ASW), and of NH$_3$ on crystalline water ice. We were\nable to measure binding energies down to a fraction of 1\\% of a layer, thus\nmaking these measurements more appropriate for astrochemistry than the existing\nvalues. We found that CO$_2$ forms clusters on np-ASW surface even at very low\ncoverages. The binding energies of N$_2$, CO, O$_2$, and CH$_4$ decrease with\ncoverage in the submonolayer regime. Their values at the low coverage limit are\nmuch higher than what is commonly used in gas-grain models. An empirical\nformula was used to describe the coverage dependence of the binding energies.\nWe used the newly determined binding energy distributions in a simulation of\ngas-grain chemistry for cold cloud and hot core models. We found that owing to\nthe higher value of desorption energy in the sub-monlayer regime a fraction of\nall these ices stays much longer and up to higher temperature on the grain\nsurface compared to the single value energies currently used in the\nastrochemical models.\n", "  We analyse eight XMM-Newton observations of the bright Narrow-Line Seyfert 1\ngalaxy Arakelian 564 (Ark 564). These observations, separated by ~6 days, allow\nus to look for correlations between the simultaneous UV emission (from the\nOptical Monitor) with not only the X-ray flux but also with the different X-ray\nspectral parameters. The X-ray spectra from all the observations are found to\nbe adequately fitted by a double Comptonization model where the soft excess and\nthe hard X-ray power law are represented by thermal Comptonization in a low\ntemperature plasma and hot corona, respectively. Apart from the fluxes of each\ncomponent, the hard X-ray power law index is found to be variable. These\nresults suggest that the variability is associated with changes in the geometry\nof the inner region. The UV emission is found to be variable and well\ncorrelated with the high energy index while the correlations with the fluxes of\neach component are found to be weaker. Using viscous time-scale arguments we\nrule out the possibility that the UV variation is due to fluctuating accretion\nrate in the outer disc. If the UV variation is driven by X-ray reprocessing,\nthen our results indicate that the strength of the X-ray reprocessing depends\nmore on the geometry of the X-ray producing inner region rather than on the\nX-ray luminosity alone.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the band alignments of two-dimensional\n(2D) semiconducting materials and highlight the possibilities of forming\nmomentum-matched type I, II and III heterojunctions; an enticing possibility\nbeing atomic heterostructures where the constituent monolayers have band edges\nat the zone center. Our study, which includes the Group IV and III-V compound\nmonolayer materials, Group V elemental monolayer materials, transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMD) and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMT) reveals that\nalmost half of these materials have conduction and/or valence band edges\nresiding at the zone center. Using first-principles density functional\ncalculations, we present the type of the heterojunction for 903 different\npossible combination of these 2D materials which establishes a periodic table\nof heterojunctions.\n", "  General circulation models of the atmosphere of hot Jupiters have shown the\nexistence of a supersonic eastward equatorial jet. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effects of compressibility on the atmospheric dynamics by\nsolving the standard Euler equations. This is done by means of a series of\nsimulations performed in the framework of the equatorial beta-plane\napproximation using the finite volume shock-capturing code RAMSES. At low\nresolution, we recover the classical results described in the literature: we\nfind a strong and steady supersonic equatorial jet of a few km/s that displays\nno signature of shocks. We next show that the jet zonal velocity depends\nsignificantly on the grid meridional resolution. When that resolution is fine\nenough to properly resolve the jet, the latter is subject to a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. The jet zonal mean velocity displays regular oscillations with a\ntypical timescale of few days and a significant amplitude of about 15% of the\njet velocity. We also find compelling evidence for the development of a\nvertical shear instability at pressure levels of a few bars. It seems to be\nresponsible for an increased downward kinetic energy flux, significantly\naffecting the temperature of the deep atmosphere, and appears to act as a form\nof drag on the equatorial jet. This instability also creates velocity\nfluctuations that propagate upward and steepen into weak shocks at pressure\nlevels of a few mbars. We conclude that hot Jupiter equatorial jets are\npotentially unstable to both a barotropic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a\nvertical shear instability. Upon confirmation using more realistic models, both\ninstabilities could result in significant time variability of the atmospheric\nwinds, may provide a small scale dissipation mechanism in the flow, and might\nhave consequences for the internal evolution of hot Jupiters.\n", "  Since the release of LAMOST (the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber\nSpectroscopic Telescope) catalog, we have the opportunity to use the LAMOST DR2\nstellar catalog and \\emph{WISE All-sky catalog} to search for 22 $\\mu$m excess\ncandidates. In this paper, we present 10 FGK candidates which show an excess in\nthe infrared (IR) at 22 $\\mu$m. The ten sources are all the newly identified 22\n$\\mu$m excess candidates. Of these 10 stars, 5 stars are F type and 5 stars are\nG type. The criterion for selecting candidates is $K_s-[22]_{\\mu m}\\geq0.387$.\nIn addition, we present the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) covering\nwavelength from optical to mid-infrared band. Most of them show an obvious\nexcess from 12 $\\mu$m band and three candidates even show excess from 3.4\n$\\mu$m. To characterize the amount of dust, we also estimate the fractional\nluminosity of ten 22 $\\mu$m excess candidates.\n", "  We consider the Standard Model extended with a dark matter particle in curved\nspacetime, motivated by the fact that the only current evidence for dark matter\nis through its gravitational interactions, and we investigate the impact on the\ndark matter stability of terms in the Lagrangian linear in the dark matter\nfield and proportional to the Ricci scalar. We show that this \"gravity portal\"\ninduces decay even if the dark matter particle only has gravitational\ninteractions, and that the decay branching ratios into Standard Model particles\nonly depend on one free parameter: the dark matter mass. We study in detail the\ncase of a singlet scalar as dark matter candidate, which is assumed to be\nabsolutely stable in flat spacetime due to a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry, but which\nmay decay in curved spacetimes due to a $Z_2$-breaking non-minimal coupling to\ngravity. We calculate the dark matter decay widths and we set conservative\nlimits on the non-minimal coupling parameter from experiments. The limits are\nvery stringent and suggest that there must exist an additional mechanism\nprotecting the singlet scalar from decaying via this gravity portal.\n", "  We present the physical and geometrical parameters of the individual\ncomponents of the close visual double-lined spectroscopic binary system Gliese\n762.1, which were estimated using Al-Wardat's complex method for analyzing\nclose visual binary systems. The estimated parameters of the individual\ncomponents of the system are as follows: radius $R_{A}=0.845\\pm0.09 R_\\odot$,\n$R_{B}=0.795\\pm0.10 R_\\odot$, effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}^{A}\n=5300\\pm50$\\,K, $T_{\\rm eff}^{B} =5150\\pm50$\\,K, surface gravity log\n$g_{A}=4.52\\pm0.10$, log $g_{B}=4.54\\pm0.15$ and luminosity $L_A=0.51\\pm0.08\nL_\\odot$, $L_B=0.40\\pm0.07L_\\odot$. New orbital elements are presented with a\nsemi-major axis of $0.0865 \\pm 0.010 $ arcsec using the Hippracos parallax\n$\\pi=58.96\\pm0.65$ mas, and an accurate total mass and individual masses of the\nsystem are determined as $M=1.72\\pm0.60M_\\odot$, $M_A=0.89 \\pm0.08M_\\odot$ and\n$M_B=0.83 \\pm0.07M_\\odot$. Finally, the spectral types and luminosity classes\nof both components are assigned as K0V and K1.5V for the primary and secondary\ncomponents respectively, and their positions on the H-R diagram and\nevolutionary tracks are given.\n", "  We consider implications of the microscopic dynamics of spacetime for the\nevolution of cosmological models. We argue that quantum geometry effects may\nlead to stochastic fluctuations of the gravitational constant, which is thus\nconsidered as a macroscopic effective dynamical quantity. Consistency with\nRiemannian geometry entails the presence of a time-dependent dark energy term\nin the modified field equations, which can be expressed in terms of the\ndynamical gravitational constant. We suggest that the late-time accelerated\nexpansion of the Universe may be ascribed to quantum fluctuations in the\ngeometry of spacetime rather than the vacuum energy from the matter sector.\n", "  We show how by assuming at least 8 real timelike supersymmetries in the\nmaximally supersymmetric three-dimensional ungauged supergravity and a further\nsimplifying Ansatz, we are naturally led to a pair of Liouville field\nequations. We also show that there are no solutions that preserve only 6 real\ntimelike supersymmetries. The solution relies on the classification of complex\nspinors of Spin(8) to which the problem quickly reduces.\n", "  Pulsar glitches, sudden jumps in frequency observed in many radio pulsars,\nmay be the macroscopic manifestation of superfluid vortex avalanches on the\nmicroscopic scale. Small scale quantum mechanical simulations of vortex motion\nin a decelerating container have shown that such events are possible and\npredict power-law distributions for the size of the events, and exponential\ndistributions for the waiting time. Despite a paucity of data, this prediction\nis consistent with the size and waiting time distributions of most glitching\npulsars. Nevertheless a few object appear to glitch quasi-periodically, and\nexhibit many large glitches, while a recent study of the Crab pulsar has\nsuggested a cut-off deviations from a power-law distribution for smaller\nglitches. In this paper we incorporate the results of quantum mechanical\nsimulations in a macroscopic scale superfluid hydrodynamics simulation. We show\nthat the effect of vortex coupling to the neutron and proton fluids in the\nneutron star naturally leads to deviations from power-law distributions for\nsizes and from exponential distributions for waiting times. In particular we\npredict a cut-off in the size distribution for small glitches.\n", "  Recent results in deeply subwavelength thickness films demonstrated coherent\ncontrol and logical gate operations with both classical and single photon light\nsources. However, quantum processing and devices typically involve more than\none photon and non-trivial input quantum states. Here we experimentally\ninvestigate two-photon N00N state coherent absorption in a multilayer graphene\nfilm. Depending on the N00N state input phase, it is possible to selectively\nchoose between single or two photon absorption of the input state in the\ngraphene film. These results demonstrate that coherent absorption in the\nquantum regime exhibits unique features opening up applications in multiphoton\nspectroscopy and imaging.\n", "  Within the derivative expansion of conformally reduced gravity, the modified\nsplit Ward identities are shown to be compatible with the flow equations if and\nonly if either the anomalous dimension vanishes or the cutoff profile is chosen\nto be power law. No solutions exist if the Ward identities are incompatible. In\nthe compatible case, a clear reason is found for why Ward identities can still\nforbid the existence of fixed points; however, for any cutoff profile, a\nbackground independent (and parametrisation independent) flow equation is\nuncovered. Finally, expanding in vertices, the combined equations are shown\ngenerically to become either over-constrained or highly redundant beyond the\nsix-point level.\n", "  In contrast to the fully projective limit of strong quantum measurement,\nwhere the evolution is locked to a small subspace (quantum Zeno dynamics), or\neven frozen completely (quantum Zeno effect), the weak non-projective\nmeasurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to\nnontrivial effects. Here we consider global weak measurement addressing\ncollective variables, thus preserving quantum superpositions due to the lack of\nwhich path information. While for certainty we focus on ultracold atoms, the\nidea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems, including various\nquantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely photonic systems with\nmultiple-path interferometers (photonic circuits). We show that light\nscattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining\nmacroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent\ndynamics. Even if the measurement strength remains constant, the quantum\nmeasurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi-periodically and\ninduces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms. We introduce an\neffective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an analytic\nsolution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its stable\npoint. We confirm our finding describing the atomic observables in terms of\nstochastic differential equations.\n", "  We examine non-Markovian effects in an open quantum system from the point of\nview of information flow. To this end, we consider the spin-boson model with a\ncold reservoir, accounting for the exact time-dependent correlations between\nthe system and the bath to study the exchange of information and heat. We use\nan information theoretic measure of the relevant memory effects and demonstrate\nthat the information backflow from the reservoir to the system does not\nnecessarily correlate with the backflow of heat. We also examine the influence\nof temperature and coupling strength on the loss and gain of information\nbetween the system and the bath. Finally, we discuss how additional driving\nchanges the backflow of information, giving rise to potential applications in\nreservoir engineering.\n", "  At redshift larger than 3 there is a disagreement between the number of\nblazars (whose jet is pointing at us) and the number of expected parents (whose\njet is pointing elsewhere). Now we strengthen this claim because (i) the number\nof blazars identified within the SDSS+FIRST survey footprint increased,\ndemanding a more numerous parent population, and (ii) the detected blazars have\na radio flux large enough to be above the FIRST flux limit even if the jet is\nslightly misaligned. The foreseen number of these slightly misaligned jets, in\nprinciple detectable, is much larger than the radio-detected sources in the\nFIRST+SDSS survey (at redshift larger than 4). This argument is independent of\nthe presence of an isotropic radio component, such as the hot spot or the radio\nlobe, and does not depend on the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma. We propose a\nscenario that ascribes the lack of slightly misaligned sources to an\nover-obscuration of the nucleus by a \"bubble\" of dust, possibly typical of the\nfirst high-redshift quasars.\n", "  Coherent optical phonons in bulk solid system play a crucial role in\nunderstanding and designing light-matter interactions and can be detected by\nthe transient-reflectivity measurement. In this paper, we demonstrate\nspectrally resolved detection of coherent optical phonons in diamond from\nultrashort infrared pump-probe measurements using optical band-pass filters. We\nshow that this enhances the sensitivity approximately 35 times in measuring the\ncoherent oscillations in the transient reflectivity compared with the commonly\nused spectrally integrated measurement. To explain this observation, we discuss\nits mechanism.\n", "  Scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in galaxy clusters\ninduces polarization signals determined by the quadrupole anisotropy in the\nphoton distribution at the location of clusters. This \"remote quadrupole\"\nderived from the measurements of the induced polarization in galaxy clusters\nprovides an opportunity of reconstruction of local CMB temperature\nanisotropies. In this {\\em Letter} we develop an algorithm of the\nreconstruction through the estimation of the underlying primordial\ngravitational potential, which is the origin of the CMB temperature and\npolarization fluctuations and CMB induced polarization in galaxy clusters. We\nfound a nice reconstruction for the quadrupole and octopole components of the\nCMB temperature anisotropies with the assistance of the CMB induced\npolarization signals. The reconstruction can be an important consistency test\non the puzzles of CMB anomaly, especially for the low quadrupole and axis of\nevil problems reported in WMAP and Planck data.\n", "  Quantum work is usually determined from two projective measurements of the\nenergy at the beginning and at the end of a thermodynamic process. However,\nthis paradigm cannot be considered thermodynamically consistent as it does not\naccount for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this\nconceptual inconsistency we introduce a novel paradigm that relies only on the\nexpected change of the average energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In\nparticular, we completely omit quantum measurements in the definition of\nquantum work, and hence quantum work is identified as a thermodynamic quantity\nof only the system. As main results we derive a modified quantum Jarzynski\nequality and a sharpened maximum work theorem in terms of the information free\nenergy. Comparison of our results with the standard approach allows to quantify\nthe informational cost of projective measurements.\n", "  The diphoton excess around 750 GeV observed by ATLAS and CMS can be\ninterpreted as coming from a massive spin-2 excitation. We explore this\npossibility in the context of warped five-dimensional models with the Standard\nModel (SM) fields propagating in the bulk of the extra dimension. The 750 GeV\nresonance is identified with the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the\nfive-dimensional graviton that is parametrically lighter than KK resonances of\nSM fields. Our set-up makes it possible to realize non-universal couplings of\nthe spin-2 resonance to matter, and thus to explain non-observation of the 750\nGeV resonance in leptonic channels. Phenomenological predictions of the model\ndepend on the localization of fields in the extra dimension. If, as required by\nnaturalness arguments, the zero modes of the Higgs and top fields are localized\nnear the IR brane, one expects large branching fractions to ttbar, hh, WW, and\nZZ final states. Decays to a Z boson and a photon can also be observable when\nthe KK graviton couplings to the SM gauge fields are non-universal.\n", "  We study the coherent dynamics of a two-level parabolic model and ways to\nenhance population transfer and even to obtain complete population inversion in\nsuch models. Motivated by the complete population inversion effect of zero-area\npulses found in [1], we consider a scheme where a given coupling function is\ntransformed to a zero-area coupling by performing phase-jump in the middle of\nthe evolution. We also derive a universal formula for the effect of the\nphase-jump.\n", "  We construct a class of Abelian and non-Abelian local gauge theories that\nconsist only of matter fields of fermions. The Lagrangian is compact and local\nwithout containing an auxiliary vector field nor a subsidiary condition on the\nmatter fields. Because of the special structure, this Lagrangian can be\nextended to non-Abelian gauge symmetry only in the case of SU(2) doublet matter\nfields. We carry out explicit dynamical computation in the leading 1/N order to\nshow that massless spin-one bound states appear with the correct gauge\ncoupling. Our diagram calculation exposes the dynamical features that cannot be\nexplored in the formal auxiliary vector-field trick. For instance, it shows\nthat the s-wave fermion-antifermion interaction alone cannot form the bound\ngauge-bosons; the fermion-antifermion pairs must couple to the d-wave state\ntoo. One feature common to our class of Lagrangian is that the Noether current\ndoes not exist. Therefore it evades possible conflict with the no-go theorem of\nWeinberg and Witten on formation of the non-Abelian gauge bosons.\n", "  Using numerical cosmological simulations completed under the \"Cosmic\nReionization On Computers\" (CROC) project, I explore theoretical predictions\nfor the faint end of the galaxy UV luminosity functions at $z\\geq 6$. A\ncommonly used Schechter function approximation with the magnitude cut at\n$M_{\\rm CUT}\\sim-13$ provides a reasonable fit to the actual luminosity\nfunction of simulated galaxies. When the Schechter functional form is forced on\nthe luminosity functions from the simulations, the magnitude cut $M_{\\rm CUT}$\nis found to vary between $-12$ and $-14$ with a mild redshift dependence. An\nanalytical model of reionization from Madau, Haardt & Rees (1997), as used by\nRobertson et al. (2015), provides a good description of the simulated results,\nbut only if the redshift dependence of the effective escape fraction (induced\nby physical processes not captured by the Madau, Haardt & Rees model) is\naccounted for.\n", "  The photophysics and charge state dynamics of the nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenter in diamond has been extensively investigated but is still not fully\nunderstood. In contrast to previous work, we find that NV$^{0}$ converts to\nNV$^{-}$ under excitation with low power near-infrared (1064 nm) light,\nresulting in $increased$ photoluminescence from the NV$^{-}$ state. We used a\ncombination of spectral and time-resolved photoluminescence experiments and\nrate-equation modeling to conclude that NV$^{0}$ converts to NV$^{-}$ via\nabsorption of 1064 nm photons from the valence band of diamond. We report fast\nquenching and recovery of the photoluminescence from $both$ charge states of\nthe NV center under low power 1064 nm laser excitation, which has not been\npreviously observed. We also find, using optically detected magnetic resonance\nexperiments, that the charge transfer process mediated by the 1064 nm laser is\nspin-dependent.\n", "  The first discovery of the gravitational wave (GW) event, GW150914, suggests\na higher merger rate of black-hole (BH) binaries. If this is true, a number of\nBH binaries will be observed via the second-generation GW detectors, and the\nstatistical properties of the observed BH binaries can be scrutinized. A naive\nbut important question to ask is whether the spatial distribution of BH\nbinaries faithfully traces the matter inhomogeneities in the Universe or not.\nAlthough the BH binaries are thought to be formed inside the galaxies in most\nof the scenarios, there is no observational evidence to confirm such a\nhypothesis. Here, we estimate how well the second-generation GW detectors can\nstatistically confirm the BH binaries to be a tracer of the large-scale\nstructure by looking at the auto- and cross-correlation of BH binaries with\nphotometric galaxies and weak lensing measurements, finding that, with a 3 year\nobservation, the $>3\\sigma$ detection of non-zero signal is possible if the BH\nmerger rate today is $\\dot{n}_0\\gtrsim100$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ and the\nclustering bias of BH binaries is $b_{\\rm BH,0}\\gtrsim1.5$.\n", "  Topological quantum error correction codes are currently among the most\npromising candidates for efficiently dealing with the decoherence effects\ninherently present in quantum devices. Numerically, their theoretical error\nthreshold can be calculated by mapping the underlying quantum problem to a\nrelated classical statistical-mechanical spin system with quenched disorder.\nHere, we present results for the general fault-tolerant regime, where we\nconsider both qubit and measurement errors. However, unlike in previous\nstudies, here we vary the strength of the different error sources\nindependently. Our results highlight peculiar differences between toric and\ncolor codes. This study complements previous results published in New J. Phys.\n13, 083006 (2011).\n", "  We use a holographic method to investigate thermalization of a\nboost-invariant strongly interacting non-Abelian plasma. Boundary sourcing, a\ndistorsion of the boundary metric, is employed to drive the system far from\nequilibrium. Thermalization is analyzed through nonlocal probes: the equal-time\ntwo-point correlation function of large conformal dimension operators in the\nboundary theory, and Wilson loops of different shapes. We study the dependence\nof the thermalization time on the size of the probes, and compare the results\nto the ones obtained using local observables: the onset of thermalization is\nfirst observed at short distances.\n", "  Despite much scientific evidence, a large fraction of the American public\ndoubts that greenhouse gases are causing global warming. We present a\nsimulation model as a computational test-bed for climate prediction markets.\nTraders adapt their beliefs about future temperatures based on the profits of\nother traders in their social network. We simulate two alternative climate\nfutures, in which global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon\ndioxide or by solar irradiance. These represent, respectively, the scientific\nconsensus and a hypothesis advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct\nsensitivity analyses to determine how a variety of factors describing both the\nmarket and the physical climate may affect traders' beliefs about the cause of\nglobal climate change. Market participation causes most traders to converge\nquickly toward believing the \"true\" climate model, suggesting that a climate\nmarket could be useful for building public consensus.\n", "  We construct a hadron-quark two-phase model based on the Walecka-quantum\nhadrodynamics and the improved Polyakov-Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with an\nexplicit chemical potential dependence of Polyakov-loop potential ($\\mu$PNJL\nmodel). With respect to the original PNJL model, the confined-deconfined phase\ntransition is largely affected at low temperature and large chemical potential.\nUsing the two-phase model, we investigate the equilibrium transition between\nhadronic and quark matter at finite chemical potentials and temperatures. The\nnumerical results show that the transition boundaries from nuclear to quark\nmatter move towards smaller chemical potential (lower density) when the\n$\\mu$-dependent Polyakov loop potential is taken. In particular, for charge\nasymmetric matter, we compute the local asymmetry of $u, d$ quarks in the\nhadron-quark coexisting phase, and analyse the isospin-relevant observables\npossibly measurable in heavy-ion collision (HIC) experiments. In general new\nHIC data on the location and properties of the mixed phase would bring relevant\ninformation on the expected chemical potential dependence of the Polyakov Loop\ncontribution.\n", "  The dependence on centrality, or on the number of nucleon participants, of\nthe midrapidity density of charged particles measured in heavy-ion collisions\nat the collision energy of about 20 GeV at RHIC to the highest LHC energy of 5\nTeV is investigated within the recently proposed effective-energy approach.\nThis approach relates multihadron production in different types of collisions\nby combining, under the proper scaling of the collision energy, the constituent\nquark picture with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics. The measurements are\nshown to be well described based on the similarity of multihadron production\nprocess in (anti)proton-proton interactions and heavy-ion collisions driven by\nthe centrality-dependent effective energy of participants.\n", "  Measurements of the $W^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\ell^{\\pm} \\nu$ and $Z \\rightarrow\n\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ production cross sections (where $\\ell^{\\pm}=e^{\\pm},\\mu^{\\pm}$)\nin proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are presented using data\nrecorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to\na total integrated luminosity of 81 pb$^{-1}$ The total inclusive\n$W^{\\pm}$-boson production cross sections times the single-lepton-flavour\nbranching ratios are $\\sigma_{W^+}^{tot}= 11.83 \\pm 0.02 (stat) \\pm 0.32 (sys)\n\\pm 0.25 (lumi)$ nb and $\\sigma_{W^-}^{tot} = 8.79 \\pm 0.02 (stat) \\pm 0.24\n(sys) \\pm 0.18 (lumi)$ nb for $W^+$ and $W^-$, respectively. The total\ninclusive $Z$-boson production cross section times leptonic branching ratio,\nwithin the invariant mass window $66 < m_{\\ell\\ell} < 116$ GeV, is\n$\\sigma_{Z}^{tot} = 1.981 \\pm 0.007 (stat) \\pm 0.038 (sys) \\pm 0.042 (lumi)$\nnb. The $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z$-boson production cross sections and cross-section\nratios within a fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance are also\nmeasured. The cross-section ratios benefit from significant cancellation of\nexperimental uncertainties, resulting in $\\sigma_{W^+}^{fid}/\\sigma_{W^-}^{fid}\n= 1.295 \\pm 0.003 (stat) \\pm 0.010 (sys)$ and\n$\\sigma_{W^{\\pm}}^{fid}/\\sigma_{Z}^{fid} = 10.31 \\pm 0.04 (stat) \\pm 0.20\n(sys)$. Theoretical predictions, based on calculations accurate to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order for quantum chromodynamics and to next-to-leading\norder for electroweak processes and which employ different parton distribution\nfunction sets, are compared to these measurements.\n", "  Correlation spectroscopy has been proposed as a spectroscopic technique for\nmeasuring the coherence between the ground states in electromagnetically\ninduced transparency (EIT). While in time domain the steep dispersion in EIT\ncondition accounts for the robustness of the correlation linewidth against\npower broadening, such physical insight was not directly established in the\nfrequency domain. We propose a perturbative approach to describe the\ncorrelation spectroscopy of two noisy lasers coupled to a $\\Lambda$-transition\nin cold atoms, leading to EIT. Such approach leads to an analytical expression\nthat maps the intensity correlation directly in terms of the absorption and\ndispersion of the light fields. Low and high perturbative regimes are\ninvestigated and demonstrate that, for coherent light sources, the first oder\nterm in perturbation expansion represents a sufficient description for the\ncorrelation. Sidebands resonances are also observed, showing the richness of\nthe frequency domain approach.\n", "  We study a simple, well-motivated model based on a custodial symmetry which\ndescribes the tree-level production of a 750 GeV diphoton resonance from a\ndecay of a singly produced vector-like quark. The model has several novel\nfeatures. The identification of the resonance as an SU(2)$_R$ triplet provides\na symmetry explanation for suppression of its decays to hh, WW, and gg.\nMoreover, the ratio of the 13 TeV to 8 TeV cross sections can be larger than\nsingle production of a 750 GeV resonance, reaching ratios of up to 7 for TeV\nscale vector-like quark masses. This eliminates any tension between the results\nfrom Run I and Run II diphoton searches. Lastly, we study the kinematics of our\nsignal and conclude that the new production mechanism is consistent with\navailable experimental distributions in large regions of parameter space but,\ndepending on the mass of the new vector-like quarks, can be differentiated from\nthe background with more statistics.\n", "  We study the ascent of granular-sized magnetic bubbles from the solar\nphotosphere through the chromosphere into the transition region and above, for\nthe first time. Such events occurred in a flux emerging region in NOAA 11850 on\nSeptember 25, 2013. During that time, the first co-observing campaign between\nthe Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and the IRIS spacecraft was carried out.\nSimultaneous observations of the chromospheric H$\\alpha$ 656.28 nm and\n\\ion{Ca}{2} 854.2 nm lines, plus the photospheric \\ion{Fe}{1} 630.25 nm line,\nwere made with the CRISP spectropolarimeter at the SST reaching a spatial\nresolution of 0.\"14. At the same time, IRIS was performing a four-step dense\nraster of the said emerging flux region, taking slit-jaw images at 133 (C~{\\sc\nii}, transition region), 140 (\\ion{Si}{4}, transition region), 279.6\n(\\ion{Mg}{2} k, core, upper chromosphere), and 283.2 nm (\\ion{Mg}{2} k, wing,\nphotosphere). Spectroscopy of several lines was performed by the IRIS\nspectrograph in the far and near ultraviolet, of which we have used the\n\\ion{Si}{4} 140.3 and the \\ion{Mg}{2} k 279.6 nm lines. Coronal images from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly of the Solar Dynamics Observatory were used to\ninvestigate the possible coronal signatures of the flux emergence events. The\nphotospheric and chromospheric properties of small-scale emerging magnetic\nbubbles have been described in detail in Ortiz et al. (2014). Here we are able\nto follow such structures up to the transition region. We describe the\nproperties, including temporal delays, of the observed flux emergence in all\nlayers. We believe this may be an important mechanism of transporting energy\nand magnetic flux from subsurface layers to the transition region and corona.\n", "  Using deep Hubble and Spitzer observations Oesch et al. (2016) have\nidentified a bright ($M_{\\rm UV}\\approx -22$) star forming galaxy candidate at\n$z \\approx 11$. The presence of GN-$z11$ implies a number density $\\sim\n10^{-6}\\,{\\rm Mpc^{-3}}$, roughly an order of magnitude higher than the\nexpected value based on extrapolations from lower redshift. Using the\nunprecedented volume and high resolution of the BlueTides cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation, we study the population of luminous rare objects at\n$z > 10$. The luminosity function in BlueTides implies an enhanced number of\nmassive galaxies, consistent with the observation of GN-$z11$. We find about 30\ngalaxies at $M_{\\rm UV}\\approx -22$ at $z = 11$ in the BlueTides volume,\nincluding a few objects about 1.5 magnitudes brighter. The probability of\nobserving GN-$z11$ in the volume probed by Oesch et al. (2016) is $\\sim 13$ per\ncent. The predicted properties of the rare bright galaxies at $z = 11$ in\nBlueTides closely match those inferred from the observations of GN-$z11$.\nBlueTides predicts a negligible contribution from faint AGN in the observed\nSED. The enormous increase in volume surveyed by WFIRST will provide\nobservations of $\\sim1000$ galaxies with $M_{\\rm UV} < -22$ beyond $z = 11$ out\nto $z = 13.5$.\n", "  Using anyon-fermion mapping method, we investigate the ground state\nproperties of hard-core anyons confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. The\nconcise analytical formula of the reduced one-body density matrix are obtained.\nBasing on the formula, we evaluated the momentum distribution, the natural\norbitals and their occupation distributions for different statistical\nparameters. The occupation and occupation fraction of the lowest natural\norbital versus anyon number are also displayed. It is shown that the ground\nstate properties of anyons interplay between Bosons and Fermions continuously.\nWe can expect that the hard-core anyons of larger statistical parameter exhibit\nthe similar properties to the hard-core Bosons although anyon system satisfy\nspecific fractional statistics.\n", "  We consider a new form of analytical perturbation theory expansion in the\nmassless $SU(N_c)$ theory, for the non-singlet part of the\n$e^+e^-$-annihilation to hadrons Adler function $D^{ns}$ and of the Bjorken sum\nrule of the polarized lepton-hadron deep-inelastic scattering $C_{ns}^{Bjp}$,\nand demonstrate its validity at the $O(\\alpha_s^4)$-level at least. It is a\ntwo-fold series in terms of powers of the conformal anomaly and of $SU(N_c)$\ncoupling $\\alpha_s$. Explicit expressions are obtained for the\n$\\{\\beta\\}$-expanded perturbation coefficients at $O(\\alpha_s^4)$ level in\n$\\bar{\\rm MS}$ scheme, for both considered physical quqantities. Comparisons of\nthe terms in the $\\{\\beta\\}$-expanded coefficients are made with the\ncorresponding terms obtained by using extra gluino degrees of freedom, or\nskeleton-motivated expansion, or $R_{\\delta}$-scheme motivated expansion in the\nPrinciple of Maximal Conformality. Relations between terms of the\n$\\{\\beta\\}$-expansion for the $D^{ns}$- and $C_{ns}^{Bjp}$-functions, which\nfollow from the conformal symmetry limit and its violation, are presnted. The\nrelevance to the possible new analysis of the experimental data for the Adler\nfunction and Bjorken sum rule is discussed.\n", "  We present a general formula for the topological part of the effective action\nfor quantum Hall systems in higher dimensions, including fluctuations of the\ngauge field and metric around background fields of a specified topological\nclass. The result is based on a procedure of integrating up from the Dolbeault\nindex density which applies for the degeneracies of Landau levels, combined\nwith some input from the standard descent procedure for anomalies. Features of\nthe topological action in (2+1), (4+1), (6+1) dimensions, including the\ncontribution due to gravitational anomalies, are discussed in some detail.\n", "  We have investigated spin-electricity conversion on surface states of\nbulk-insulating topological insulator (TI) materials using a spin pumping\ntechnique. The sample structure is Ni-Fe|Cu|TI trilayers, in which magnetic\nproximity effects on the TI surfaces are negligibly small owing to the inserted\nCu layer. Voltage signals produced by the spin-electricity conversion are\nclearly observed, and enhanced with decreasing temperature in line with the\ndominated surface transport at lower temperatures. The efficiency of the\nspin-electricity conversion is greater for TI samples with higher resistivity\nof bulk states and longer mean free path of surface states, consistent with the\nsurface spin-electricity conversion.\n", "  We investigate single crystalline samples of Ce$_{1-x}$Nd$_{x}$RhIn$_{5}$ by\nmeans of X-ray diffraction, microprobe, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity,\nand electrical resistivity measurements. Our data reveal that the\nantiferromagnetic transition temperature of CeRhIn$_{5}$, $T_{N}^{\\mathrm{Ce}}\n= 3.8$ K, is linearly suppressed with $x_{\\mathrm{Nd}}$, by virtue of the\n\"Kondo hole\" created by Nd substitution. The extrapolation of\n$T^{\\mathrm{Ce}}_{N}$ to zero temperature, however, occurs at $x_{c} \\sim 0.3$,\nwhich is below the 2D percolation limit found in Ce$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$RhIn$_{5}$.\nThis result strongly suggests the presence of crystal-field frustration\neffects. Near $x_{\\mathrm{Nd}} \\sim 0.2$, the Ising AFM order from Nd ions is\nstabilized and $T^{\\mathrm{Nd}}_{N}$ increases up to $11$ K in pure\nNdRhIn$_{5}$. Our results shed light on the effects of magnetic doping in\nheavy-fermion antiferromagnets and stimulate the study of such systems under\napplied pressure.\n", "  We present the results of an experiment where a short focal length (~ 1.3 cm)\npermanent magnet electron lens is used to image micron-size features of a metal\nsample in a single shot, using an ultra- high brightness ps-long 4 MeV electron\nbeam from a radiofrequency photoinjector. Magnifcation ratios in excess of 30x\nwere obtained using a triplet of compact, small gap (3.5 mm), Halbach-style\npermanent magnet quadrupoles with nearly 600 T/m field gradients. These results\npave the way to- wards single shot time-resolved electron microscopy and open\nnew opportunities in the applications of high brightness electron beams.\n", "  The next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments will be\nsensitive to both coherent neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering.\nThis will enable them to explore aspects of solar physics, perform the lowest\nenergy measurement of the weak angle to date, and probe contributions from new\ntheories with light mediators. In this article, we compute the projected\nnuclear and electron recoil rates expected in several dark matter direct\ndetection experiments due to solar neutrinos, and use these estimates to\nquantify errors on future measurements of the neutrino fluxes, weak mixing\nangle and solar observables, as well as to constrain new physics in the\nneutrino sector. Our analysis shows that the combined rates of solar neutrino\nevents in second generation experiments (SuperCDMS and LZ) can yield a\nmeasurement of the $pp$ flux to 2.5% accuracy via electron recoil, and slightly\nimprove the $^8$B flux determination. Assuming a low-mass argon phase,\nprojected tonne-scale experiments like DARWIN can reduce the uncertainty on\nboth the $pp$ and boron-8 neutrino fluxes to below 1%. Finally, we use current\nresults from LUX, SuperCDMS and CDMSlite to set bounds on new interactions\nbetween neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, and show that future direct\ndetection experiments can be used to set complementary constraints on the\nparameter space associated with light mediators.\n", "  We use a high resolution cosmological zoom simulation of a Milky Way-sized\nhalo to study the observable features in velocity and metallicity space\nassociated with the dynamical influence of spiral arms. For the first time, we\ndemonstrate that spiral arms, that form in a disc in a fully cosmological\nenvironment with realistic galaxy formation physics, drive large-scale\nsystematic streaming motions. In particular, on the trailing edge of the spiral\narms the peculiar galacto-centric radial and azimuthal velocity field is\ndirected radially outward and azimuthally backward, whereas it is radially\ninward and azimuthally forward on the leading edge. Owing to the negative\nradial metallicity gradient, this systematic motion drives, at a given radius,\nan azimuthal variation in the residual metallicity that is characterised by a\nmetal rich trailing edge and a metal poor leading edge. We show that these\nsignatures are theoretically observable in external galaxies with Integral\nField Unit instruments such as VLT/MUSE, and if detected, would provide\nevidence for large-scale systematic radial migration driven by spiral arms.\n", "  This work reports the first discovery of (negative) spectral lags in the\nX-ray emission below 10 keV from the gamma ray binary $LSI +61^{o} $ 303 during\nlarge flaring episodes using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)\nobservations. It is found from the RXTE data that during the flares, low energy\n(3-5 KeV) variations lead the higher energy (8-10 keV) variations by few tens\nof seconds whereas no significant time lag is observed during the non-flaring\nstates. The observed spectral lag features for flaring events suggest that\ninverse Compton scattering may be operative, at least in some part of the\nsystem. Another possibility is that the sites of particle acceleration may be\ndifferent for flaring and non-flaring events such as in the microquasar model\nthe flaring radiation may come from hot spots sitting above the black hole\nwhile steady state emissions are due to the jets.\n", "  Majorana neutrinos naturally lead to a Lepton Number Violation (LNV). A\nsuperposition of Majorana states can mimic Dirac-type neutrinos, leading to its\nconservation (LNC). We demonstrate on the example of specific observables\nrelated to high and low energy processes how a strength of LNV correlates with\nneutrino parameters such as CP-phases, flavor mixings, mass ratios. We stress\nthe coaction between low and high energy studies for putting phenomenological\nmodels to a quantitative test. Secondly, we conclude that in order to fully\nstudy the role of heavy neutrinos in search for New Physics (NP) signals, a\ndeparture from trivial scenarios assuming degeneracy in mass and no flavor\nmixing or CP-phases becomes necessary for a proper physical analysis.\n", "  Current constraints on spatial curvature show that it is dynamically\nnegligible: $|\\Omega_{\\rm K}| \\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ (95% CL). Neglecting\nit as a cosmological parameter would be premature however, as more stringent\nconstraints on $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ at around the $10^{-4}$ level would offer\nvaluable tests of eternal inflation models and probe novel large-scale\nstructure phenomena. This precision also represents the \"curvature floor\",\nbeyond which constraints cannot be meaningfully improved due to the cosmic\nvariance of horizon-scale perturbations. In this paper, we discuss what future\nexperiments will need to do in order to measure spatial curvature to this\nmaximum accuracy. Our conservative forecasts show that the curvature floor is\nunreachable - by an order of magnitude - even with Stage IV experiments, unless\nstrong assumptions are made about dark energy evolution and the $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameter values. We also discuss some of the novel problems that arise when\nattempting to constrain a global cosmological parameter like $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$\nwith such high precision. Measuring curvature down to this level would be an\nimportant validation of systematics characterisation in high-precision\ncosmological analyses.\n", "  In 2013 we conducted a large multi-wavelength campaign on the archetypical\nSeyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. Unexpectedly, this usually unobscured source\nappeared strongly absorbed in the soft X-rays during the entire campaign, and\nsignatures of new and strong outflows were present in the almost simultaneous\nUV HST/COS data. Here we carry out a comprehensive spectral analysis of all\navailable XMM-Newton observations of NGC 5548 (for a total of ~763 ks) in\ncombination with 3 simultaneous NuSTAR obs. We obtain a best-fit composed by i)\na weakly varying flat (Gamma~1.5-1.7) power-law component; ii) a constant, cold\nreflection (FeK + continuum) component; iii) a soft excess, possibly due to\nthermal Comptonization; and iv) a constant, ionized scattered emission-line\ndominated component. Our main findings are that, during the 2013 campaign, the\nfirst 3 of these components appear to be partially covered by a heavy and\nvariable obscurer located along the l.o.s. that is consistent with a multilayer\nof cold and mildly ionized gas. We characterize in detail the short timescale\n(~ks-to-days) spectral variability of this new obscurer, and find it is mostly\ndue to a combination of Nh and Cf variations, on top of intrinsic power-law\nvariations. In addition, our best-fit spectrum is left with several (but\nmarginal) absorption features at rest-frame energies ~6.7-6.9 keV and ~8 keV,\nas well as a weak broad emission line feature redwards of the 6.4 keV emission\nline. These could indicate a more complex underlying model, e.g. a P-Cygni-type\nprofile if allowing for a large velocity and wide-angle outflow. These findings\nare consistent with a picture where the obscurer represents the manifestation\nalong the l.o.s. of a multilayer of gas that is likely outflowing at high\nspeed, and simultaneously producing heavy obscuration and scattering in the\nX-rays and broad absorption features in the UV.\n", "  We provide numerical evidence that a finite-dimensional inertial manifold on\nwhich the dynamics of a chaotic dissipative dynamical system lives can be\nconstructed solely from the knowledge of a set of unstable periodic orbits. In\nparticular, we determine the dimension of the inertial manifold for\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky system, and find it to be equal to the `physical\ndimension' computed previously via the hyperbolicity properties of covariant\nLyapunov vectors.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of a model based on the $SU(3)_c\\times\nSU(3)_L\\times U(1)_X$ gauge theory, the so-called 331 model. In particular, we\nfocus on the Higgs sector of the model which is composed of three $SU(3)_L$\ntriplet Higgs fields, and this corresponds to the minimal form to realize\nphenomenologically acceptable scenario. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking\n$SU(3)_L\\times U(1)_X\\to SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$, our Higgs sector effectively\nbecomes that with two $SU(2)_L$ doublet scalar fields, in which the first and\nthe second generation quarks couple to the different Higgs doublet from that\ncouples to the third generation quarks. This structure causes the flavour\nchanging neutral current mediated by Higgs bosons at the tree level. By taking\nan alignment limit of the mass matrix for the CP-even Higgs bosons, which is\nnaturally realized in the case with the breaking scale of $SU(3)_L\\times\nU(1)_X$ to be much larger than that of $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$, we can avoid\ncurrent constraints from flavour experiments such as the $B^0$-$\\bar{B}^0$\nmixing even for the Higgs bosons masses being ${\\cal O}(100)$ GeV. In this\nallowed parameter space, we clarify that a characteristic deviation in quark\nYukawa couplings of the standard model-like Higgs boson is predicted, which has\na different pattern from that seen in two Higgs doublet models with a\nsoftly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. We also find that the flavour violating decay\nmodes of the extra Higgs boson, e.g., $H/A \\to tc$ and $H^\\pm \\to ts$ can be\ndominant, and they yield the important signature to distinguish our model from\nthe two Higgs doublet models.\n", "  A search for a narrow baryonic state in the $pK^0_S$ and $\\bar{p}K^0_S$\nsystem has been performed in $ep$ collisions at HERA with the ZEUS detector\nusing an integrated luminosity of 358 pb$^{-1}$ taken in 2003-2007. The search\nwas performed with deep inelastic scattering events at an $ep$ centre-of-mass\nenergy of 318 GeV for exchanged photon virtuality, $Q^2$, between 20 and 100\n$\\rm{} GeV^{2}$. Contrary to evidence presented for such a state around 1.52\nGeV in a previous ZEUS analysis using a sample of 121 pb$^{-1}$ taken in\n1996-2000, no resonance peak was found in the $p(\\bar{p})K^0_S$ invariant-mass\ndistribution in the range 1.45-1.7 GeV. Upper limits on the production cross\nsection are set.\n", "  Quantum walks are considered to be quantum counterparts of random walks.They\nshow us impressive probability distributions which are different from those of\nrandom walks.That fact has been precisely proved in terms of mathematics and\nsome of the results were reported as limit theorems.When we analyze quantum\nwalks, some conventional methods are used for the computations.Especially, the\nFourier analysis has played a role to do that.It is, however, compatible with\nsome types of quantum walks (e.g. quantum walks on the line with a spatially\nhomogeneous dynamics) and can not well work on the derivation of limit theorems\nfor all the quantum walks.In this paper we try to obtain a limit theorem for a\nquantum walk on the half line by the usage of the Fourier analysis.Substituting\na quantum walk on the line for it, we will lead to a possibility that the\nFourier analysis is useful to compute a limit distribution of the quantum walk\non the half line.\n", "  We calculate the joint min--max distribution and the Edwards-Anderson's order\nparameter for the circular model of $1 / f$-noise. Both quantities, as well as\ngeneralisations, are obtained exactly by combining the freezing-duality\nconjecture and Jack-polynomial techniques. Numerical checks come with\nsignificantly improved control of finite-size effects in the glassy phase, and\nthe results convincingly validate the freezing-duality conjecture. Application\nto diffusive dynamics is discussed. We also provide a formula for the\npre-factor ratio of the joint/marginal Carpentier-Le Doussal tail for\nminimum/maximum which applies to any logarithmic random energy model.\n", "  We present a general framework for deriving effective spin Hamiltonians of\ncorrelated magnetic systems based on a combination of relativistic ab initio\ndensity functional theory calculations (DFT), exact diagonalization of a\ngeneralized Hubbard Hamiltonian on finite clusters and spin projections onto\nthe low-energy subspace. A key motivation is to determine anisotropic bilinear\nexchange couplings in materials of interest. As an example, we apply this\nmethod to the pyrochlore Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ where the vanadium ions form a\nlattice of corner-sharing spin-1/2 tetrahedra. In this compound, anisotropic\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) play an essential role in inducing a\nmagnon Hall effect. We obtain quantitative estimates of the nearest-neighbor\nHeisenberg exchange, the DMI, and the symmetric part of the anisotropic\nexchange tensor. Finally, we compare our results with experimental ones on the\nLu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ compound.\n", "  We study entanglement generation and control in bi-directional waveguide QED\ndriven by a two photon Gaussian wavepacket. In particular, we focus on how\nincreasing the number of qubits affects the overall average pairwise\nentanglement in the system. We also investigate how the presence of a second\nphoton can introduce non-linearities, thereby manipulating the generated\nentanglement. In addition, we show that through the introduction of chirality\nand small decay rates, entanglement can be stored and enhanced up to factors of\n2 and 3, respectively. Finally, we analyze the influence of finite detunnings\nand time-delays on the generated entanglement.\n", "  We study the properties of a D6-brane probe in the ABJM background with\nsmeared massless dynamical quarks in the Veneziano limit. Working at zero\ntemperature and non-vanishing charge density, we show that the system undergoes\na quantum phase transition in which the topology of the brane embedding changes\nfrom a black hole to a Minkowski embedding. In the unflavored background the\nphase transition is of second order and takes place when the charge density\nvanishes. We determine the corresponding critical exponents and show that the\nscaling behavior near the quantum critical point has multiplicative logarithmic\ncorrections. In the background with dynamical quarks the phase transition is of\nfirst order and occurs at non-zero charge density. In this case we compute the\ndiscontinuity of several physical quantities as functions of the number $N_f$\nof unquenched quarks of the background.\n", "  We consider dipolar excitations propagating via dipole-induced exchange among\nimmobile molecules randomly spaced in a lattice. The character of the\npropagation is determined by long-range hops (Levy flights). We analyze the\neigen-energy spectra and the multifractal structure of the wavefunctions. In 1D\nand 2D all states are localized, although in 2D the localization length can be\nextremely large leading to an effective localization-delocalization crossover\nin realistic systems. In 3D all eigenstates are extended but not always\nergodic, and we identify the energy intervals of ergodic and non-ergodic\nstates. The reduction of the lattice filling induces an ergodic to non-ergodic\ntransition, and the excitations are mostly non-ergodic at low filling.\n", "  We investigate how discrete internal degrees of freedom in a\nquasi-macroscopic system affect the violation of the Leggett--Garg inequality,\na test of macroscopic-realism based on temporal correlation functions. As a\nspecific example, we focus on an ensemble of qubits subject to collective and\nindividual noise. This generic model can describe a range of physical systems,\nincluding atoms in cavities, electron or nuclear spins in NV centers in\ndiamond, erbium in Y$_2$SiO$_5$, bismuth impurities in silicon, or arrays of\nsuperconducting circuits, to indicate but a few. Such large ensembles are\npotentially more macroscopic than other systems that have been used so far for\ntesting the Leggett--Garg inequality, and open a route toward probing the\nboundaries of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. We find that, because of\nthe non-trivial internal structure of such an ensemble, the behavior of\ndifferent measurement schemes, under the influence of noise, can be surprising.\nWe discuss which measurement schemes are optimal for flux qubits and NV\ncenters, and some of the technological constraints and difficulties for\nobserving such violations with present-day experiments.\n", "  The WISE satellite has detected hundreds of millions sources over the entire\nsky. Classifying them reliably is however a challenging task due to\ndegeneracies in WISE multicolour space and low levels of detection in its two\nlongest-wavelength bandpasses. Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and\nreliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source\nclassification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification\nwill employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those\nreliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification\nwe applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a\ntraining sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use\nthe SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier\non the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel\nis preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three\nclassification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential\naperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the\ntests. At the bright end, the completeness for stars and galaxies reaches ~95%,\ndeteriorating to ~80% at W1=16 mag, while for quasars it stays at a level of\n~95% independently of magnitude. Similar numbers are obtained for purity.\nApplication of the classifier to full-sky WISE data, flux-limited to 16 mag\n(Vega) in the 3.4 {\\mu}m channel, and appropriate a posteriori cleaning allowed\nus to obtain reliably-looking catalogues of star and galaxy candidates.\nHowever, the sources flagged by the classifier as `quasars' are in fact\ndominated by dusty galaxies but also exhibit contamination from sources located\nmainly at low ecliptic latitudes, consistent with Solar System objects.\n[abridged]\n", "  In this paper, we exactly solve, within the grand canonical ensemble, a\nminimal spin model with the hybrid phase transition. We call the model\n\"diffusion-based\" because its hamiltonian can be recovered from a simple\ndynamic procedure, which can be seen as an equilibrium statistical mechanics\nrepresentation of a biased random walk. We outline the derivation of the phase\ndiagram of the model, in which the triple point has the hallmarks of the hybrid\ntransition: discontinuity in the average magnetization and algebraically\ndiverging susceptibilities. At this point, two second-order transition curves\nmeet in equilibrium with the first-order curve, resulting in a prototypical\nmixed-order behavior.\n", "  The recurrent symbiotic nova V745 Sco exploded on 2014 February 6 and was\nobserved on February 22 and 23 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Transmission\nGrating Spectrometers. By that time the supersoft source phase had already\nended and Chandra spectra are consistent with emission from a hot, shock-heated\ncircumstellar medium with temperatures exceeding 10^7K. X-ray line profiles are\nmore sharply peaked than expected for a spherically-symmetric blast wave, with\na full width at zero intensity of approximately 2400 km/s, a full width at half\nmaximum of 1200 +/- 30 km/s and an average net blueshift of 165 +/- 10 km/s.\nThe red wings of lines are increasingly absorbed toward longer wavelengths by\nmaterial within the remnant. We conclude that the blast wave was sculpted by an\naspherical circumstellar medium in which an equatorial density enhancement\nplays a role, as in earlier symbiotic nova explosions. Expansion of the\ndominant X-ray emitting material is aligned close to the plane of the sky and\nmost consistent with an orbit seen close to face-on. Comparison of an\nanalytical blast wave model with the X-ray spectra, Swift observations and\nnear-infrared line widths indicates the explosion energy was approximately\n10^43 erg, and confirms an ejected mass of approximately 10^-7 Msun. The total\nmass lost is an order of magnitude lower than the accreted mass required to\nhave initiated the explosion, indicating the white dwarf is gaining mass and is\na supernova Type 1a progenitor candidate.\n", "  The CALICE Semi-Digital Hadron Calorimeter (SDHCAL) technological prototype\nis a sampling calorimeter using Glass Resistive Plate Chamber detectors with a\nthree-threshold readout as the active medium. This technology is one of the two\noptions proposed for the hadron calorimeter of the International Large Detector\nfor the International Linear Collider. The prototype was exposed to beams of\nmuons, electrons and pions of different energies at the CERN Super Proton\nSynchrotron. To be able to study the performance of such a calorimeter in\nfuture experiments it is important to ensure reliable simulation of its\nresponse. In this paper we present our prototype simulation performed with\nGEANT4 and the digitization procedure achieved with an algorithm called\nSimDigital. A detailed description of this algorithm is given and the methods\nto determinate its parameters using muon tracks and electromagnetic showers are\nexplained. The comparison with hadronic shower data shows a good agreement up\nto 50 GeV. Discrepancies are observed at higher energies. The reasons for these\ndifferences are investigated.\n", "  A fluctuational electrodynamics-based formalism for calculating near-field\nradiative heat transfer between objects of arbitrary size and shape and an\ninfinite surface is presented. The surface interactions are treated\nanalytically via Sommerfeld's theory of electric dipole radiation above an\ninfinite plane. The volume integral equation for the electric field is\ndiscretized using the thermal discrete dipole approximation (T-DDA). The\nframework is verified against exact results in the sphere-surface\nconfiguration, and is applied to analyze near-field radiative heat transfer\nbetween a complex-shaped probe and an infinite plane both made of silica. It is\nfound that when the probe tip size is approximately equal to or smaller than\nthe gap d separating the probe and the surface, coupled localized surface\nphonon (LSPh)-surface phonon-polariton (SPhP) mediated heat transfer occurs. In\nthis regime, the net spectral heat rate exhibits four resonant modes due to\nLSPhs along the minor axis of the probe while the net total heat rate in the\nnear field follows a d -0.3 power law. Conversely, when the probe tip size is\nmuch larger than the separation gap d, heat transfer is mediated by SPhPs\nresulting in two resonant modes in the net spectral heat rate corresponding to\nthose of a single emitting silica surface while the net total heat rate\napproaches a d -2 power law. It is also demonstrated that a complex-shaped\nprobe can be approximated by a prolate spheroidal electric dipole when the\nthermal wavelength is larger than the major axis of the spheroidal dipole and\nwhen the separation gap d is much larger than the radius of curvature of the\ndipole tip facing the surface.\n", "  We report and discuss post-explosion observations of supernova iPTF13bvn. We\nfind that the brightness of the SN at +740 days is below the level of the\npre-explosion source and thus confirm that the progenitor star has gone. We\nestimate that the late-time brightness is still dominated by the supernova,\nwhich constrains the magnitude and thus mass of a possible companion star to\nbelow approximately 10Msun. In turn this implies that the progenitor's initial\nmass is constrained to a narrow range of between 10 to 12Msun. The progenitor\nof iPTF13bvn would have been a helium giant rather than a Wolf-Rayet star. In\naddition, we suggest that sufficiently deep observations acquired in 2016 would\nnow stand a chance to directly observe the companion star.\n", "  We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the new eclipsing\nCataclysmic Variable MASTER OTJ192328.22+612413.5, discovered by the MASTER\nteam. We find the orbital period to be P=0.16764612(5) day /4.023507(1) hour.\nThe depth of the eclipse (2.9$\\pm$0.1 mag) suggests that the system is nearly\nedge on, and modeling of the system confirms the inclination to be between\n81.3-83.6 degree. The brightness outside of eclipse varies between\nobservations, with a change of 1.6$\\pm$0.1 mag. Spectroscopy reveals\ndouble-peaked Balmer emission lines. By using spectral features matching a late\nM-type companion, we bound the distance to be 750$\\pm$250 pc, depending on the\ncompanion spectral type. The source displays 2 mag brightness changes on\ntimescales of days. The amplitude of these changes, along with the spectrum at\nthe faint state, suggest the system is possibly a dwarf nova. The lack of any\nhigh excitation HeII lines suggests this system is not magnetically dominated.\nThe light curve in both quiescence and outburst resembles that of Lanning 386,\nimplying MASTER OTJ192328.22+612413.5 is a possible cross between a dwarf nova\nand a SW Sextantis star.\n", "  We investigate numerically the possibility to detect the spatial profile of\nMajorana fermions (MFs) modeling STM tips that are made of either normal or\nsuperconducting material. In both cases, we are able to resolve the\nlocalization length and the oscillation period of the MF wavefunction. We show\nthat the tunneling between the substrate and the tip, necessary to get the\ninformation on the wave function oscillations, has to be smaller in the case of\na superconducting STM. In the strong tunneling regime, the differential\nconductance saturates making it more difficult to observe the exponential decay\nof MFs. The temperature broadening of the profile is strongly suppressed in\ncase of the superconducting lead resulting, generally, in better resolution.\n", "  We study the influence of non-magnetic impurity scatterings on the tunneling\nconductance of a junction consisting of a normal metal and a disordered\nunconventional superconductor by solving the quasiclassical Eilenberger\nequation self-consistently. We find that the impurity scatterings in both the\nBorn and unitary limits affect the formation of the Andreev bound states and\nmodify strongly the tunneling spectra around zero bias. Our results are\ninterpreted well by the appearance of odd-frequency Cooper pairs near the\ninterface and by the divergent behavior of the impurity self-energy. The\npresent paper provides a useful tool to identify the pairing symmetry of\nunconventional superconductors in experiments.\n", "  (Abridged) We present the first public release of high-quality data products\n(DR1) from Hi-GAL, the {\\em Herschel} infrared Galactic Plane Survey. Hi-GAL is\nthe keystone of a suite of continuum Galactic Plane surveys from the near-IR to\nthe radio, and covers five wavebands at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron,\nencompassing the peak of the spectral energy distribution of cold dust for 8 <\nT < 50K. This first Hi-GAL data release covers the inner Milky Way in the\nlongitude range 68{\\deg} > l > -70{\\deg} in a |b|<1{\\deg} latitude strip.\nPhotometric maps have been produced with the ROMAGAL pipeline, that optimally\ncapitalizes on the excellent sensitivity and stability of the bolometer arrays\nof the {\\em Herschel} PACS and SPIRE photometric cameras, to deliver images of\nexquisite quality and dynamical range, absolutely calibrated with {\\em Planck}\nand {\\em IRAS}, and recovering extended emission at all wavelengths and all\nspatial scales. The compact source catalogues have been generated with the\nCuTEx algorithm, specifically developed to optimize source detection and\nextraction in the extreme conditions of intense and spatially varying\nbackground that are found in the Galactic Plane in the thermal infrared. Hi-GAL\nDR1 images will be accessible via a dedicated web-based image cutout service.\nThe DR1 Compact Source Catalogues are delivered as single-band photometric\nlists containing, in addition to source position, peak and integrated flux and\nsource sizes, a variety of parameters useful to assess the quality and\nreliability of the extracted sources, caveats and hints to help this assessment\nare provided. Flux completeness limits in all bands are determined from\nextensive synthetic source experiments and depend on the specific line of sight\nalong the Galactic Plane. Hi-GAL DR1 catalogues contain 123210, 308509, 280685,\n160972 and 85460 compact sources in the five bands, respectively.\n", "  Schemes to achieve strong coupling between mechanical modes of aluminum\nnitride microstructures and microwave cavity modes due to the piezoelectric\neffect are proposed. We show that the strong coupling regime is feasible for an\non-chip aluminum nitride device that is either enclosed by a three-dimensional\nmicrowave cavity or integrated with a superconducting coplanar resonator.\nCombining with optomechanics, the piezomechanical strong coupling permits\ncoherent conversion between microwave and optical modes with high efficiency.\nHence, the piezomechanical system will be an efficient transducer for\napplications in hybrid quantum systems.\n", "  The geometric-mean method is often used to estimate the spatial resolution of\na position-sensitive detector probed by tracks. It calculates the resolution\nsolely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation\nand without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Two separate\nlinear track fits are performed on the same data, one excluding and the other\nincluding the hit from the probed detector. The geometric mean of the widths of\nthe corresponding exclusive and inclusive residual distributions for the probed\ndetector is then taken as a measure of the intrinsic spatial resolution of the\nprobed detector: $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\sigma_{ex}\\cdot\\sigma_{in}}$. The validity of\nthis method is examined for a range of resolutions with a stand-alone Geant4\nMonte Carlo simulation that specifically takes multiple Coulomb scattering in\nthe tracking detector materials into account. Using simulated as well as actual\ntracking data from a representative beam test scenario, we find that the\ngeometric-mean method gives systematically inaccurate spatial resolution\nresults. Good resolutions are estimated as poor and vice versa. The more the\nresolutions of reference detectors and probed detector differ, the larger the\nsystematic bias. An attempt to correct this inaccuracy by statistically\nsubtracting multiple-scattering effects from geometric-mean results leads to\nresolutions that are typically too optimistic by 10-50\\%. This supports an\nearlier critique of this method based on simulation studies that did not take\nmultiple scattering into account.\n", "  BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) is the dominant population of TeV emitting\nblazars. In this work, we investigate whether there is any special\nobservational properties for TeV sources. To do so, we will compare the\nobservational properties of TeV detected BL Lacs (TeV BLs) and non-TeV detected\nBL Lac objects (non-TeV BLs). From the 3rd $Fermi$/LAT catalog (3FGL), we can\nget 662 BL Lacs, out of which, 47 are TeV BLs and 615 are non-TeV BLs. Their\nmulti-wavelength flux densities ($F_{\\rm R}$, $F_{\\rm O}$, $F_{\\rm X}$,\n$F_{\\gamma}$), photon spectral indexes ($\\alpha_{\\rm X}^{\\rm ph}$,\n$\\alpha_{\\gamma}^{\\rm ph}$), and effective spectral indexes ($\\alpha_{\\rm RO}$\nand $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$) are compiled from the available literatures. Then the\nluminosities ($\\log\\,{\\nu}L_{\\rm R}$, $\\log\\,{\\nu}L_{\\rm O}$,\n$\\log\\,{\\nu}L_{\\rm X}$, $\\log\\,{\\nu}L_{\\gamma}$) are calculated. From\ncomparisons, we found that TeV BLs are different from low-synchrotron-peaked\nBLs (LSP) and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BLs (ISP), but TeV BLs show\nsimilar properties as high-synchrotron-peaked BLs (HSP). Therefore, we\nconcentrated on comparison between TeV HSP BLs and non-TeV HSP BLs. Analysis\nresults suggest that TeV HSP BLs and non-TeV HSP BLs show some differences in\ntheir $\\alpha_{\\rm RO}$ and $\\alpha_{\\gamma}^{\\rm ph}$, while their other\nproperties are quite similar.\n", "  Supernova (SN) iPTF13bvn in NGC 5806 was the first Type Ib SN to have been\ntentatively associated with a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion images. We\nperformed deep ultraviolet (UV) and optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations of the SN site 740 days after explosion. We detect an object in\nthe optical bands that is fainter than the pre-explosion object. This dimming\nis likely not produced by dust absorption in the ejecta; thus, our finding\nconfirms the connection of the progenitor candidate with the SN. The object in\nour data is likely dominated by the fading SN, which implies that the pre-SN\nflux is mostly due to the progenitor. We compare our revised pre-SN photometry\nwith previously proposed progenitor models. Although binary progenitors are\nfavored, models need to be refined. In particular, to comply with our deep UV\ndetection limit, any companion star must be less luminous than a late-O star or\nsubstantially obscured by newly formed dust. A definitive progenitor\ncharacterization will require further observations to disentangle the\ncontribution of a much fainter SN and its environment.\n", "  We study the decay of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in one-dimensional Bose\ngases. Starting from the hydrodynamic Hamiltonian, we develop a microscopic\ntheory that enables one to systematically study both the excitations and their\ndecay. At zero temperature, the leading mechanism of decay of a quasiparticle\nis disintegration into three others. We find that low-energy quasiparticles\n(phonons) decay with the rate that scales with the seventh power of momentum,\nwhereas the rate of decay of the high-energy quasiparticles does not depend on\nmomentum. In addition, our approach allows us to study analytically the\nquasiparticle decay in the whole crossover region between the two limiting\ncases. When applied to integrable models, including the Lieb-Liniger model of\nbosons with contact repulsion, our theory confirms the absence of the decay of\nquasiparticle excitations. We account for two types of integrability-breaking\nperturbations that enable finite decay: three-body interaction between the\nbosons and two-body interaction of finite range.\n", "  A symmetry-preserving truncation of the two-body bound-state problem in\nrelativistic quantum field theory is used to compute the leading-twist parton\ndistribution amplitudes (PDAs) for the first radial excitations of the $\\pi$-\nand $K$-mesons. In common with ground states in these channels, the PDAs are\nfound to be dilated with respect to the relevant conformal-limit form and\nskewed toward the heavier valence-quark in asymmetric systems. In addition, the\nPDAs of radially-excited pseudoscalar mesons are not positive definite, owing\nto the fact that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) forces the leptonic\ndecay constant of such states to vanish in the chiral limit. These results\nhighlight that DCSB is expressed visibly in every pseudoscalar meson\nconstituted from light-quarks. Hence, so long as its impact is empirically\nevident in the pseudoscalar members of a given spectrum level, it is unlikely\nthat chiral symmetry is restored in any of the hadrons that populate this\nlevel.\n", "  The present work reports results from systematic multiconfiguration\nDirac-Hartree-Fock calculations of isotope shifts for several well-known\ntransitions in neutral magnesium. Relativistic normal and specific mass shift\nfactors as well as the electronic probability density at the origin are\ncalculated. Combining these electronic quantities with available nuclear data,\nenergy and transition level shifts are determined for the $^{26}$Mg$-^{24}$Mg\npair of isotopes. Different models for electron correlation are adopted. It is\nshown that although valence and core-valence models provide accurate values for\nthe isotope shifts, the inclusion of core-core excitations in the computational\nstrategy significantly improves the accuracy of the transition energies and\nnormal mass shift factors.\n", "  Image cubes of differential column density as a function of dust temperature\nare constructed for Galactic Centre molecular cloud G0.253+0.016 (\"The Brick\")\nusing the recently described PPMAP procedure. The input data consist of\ncontinuum images from the Herschel Space Telescope in the wavelength range\n70-500 $\\mu$m, supplemented by previously published interferometric data at 1.3\nmm wavelength. While the bulk of the dust in the molecular cloud is consistent\nwith being heated externally by the local interstellar radiation field, our\nimage cube shows the presence, near one edge of the cloud, of a filamentary\nstructure whose temperature profile suggests internal heating. The structure\nappears as a cool ($\\sim 14$ K) tadpole-like feature, $\\sim 6$ pc in length, in\nwhich is embedded a thin spine of much hotter ($\\sim$ 40-50 K) material. We\ninterpret these findings in terms of a cool filament whose hot central region\nis undergoing gravitational collapse and fragmentation to form a line of\nprotostars. If confirmed, this would represent the first evidence of widespread\nstar formation having started within this cloud.\n", "  Although thick stellar discs are detected in nearly all edge-on disc\ngalaxies, their formation scenarios still remain a matter of debate. Due to\nobservational difficulties, there is a lack of information about their stellar\npopulations. Using the Russian 6-m telescope BTA we collected deep spectra of\nthick discs in three edge-on S0-a disc galaxies located in different\nenvironments: NGC4111 in a dense group, NGC4710 in the Virgo cluster, and\nNGC5422 in a sparse group. We see intermediate age (4-5 Gyr) metal rich ([Fe/H]\n$\\sim$ -0.2 - 0.0 dex) stellar populations in NGC4111 and NGC4710. On the other\nhand, NGC5422 does not harbour young stars, its disc is thick and old (10 Gyr),\nwithout evidence for a second component, and its $\\alpha$-element abundance\nsuggests a 1.5-2 Gyr long formation epoch implying its formation at high\nredshift. Our results suggest the diversity of thick disc formation scenarios.\n", "  For inversion-symmetric topological insulators and superconductors\ncharacterized by ${\\mathbb Z}_{2}$ topological invariants, two scaling schemes\nare proposed to judge topological phase transitions driven by an energy\nparameter. The scaling schemes renormalize either the phase gradient or the\nsecond derivative of the Pfaffian of the time-reversal operator, through which\nthe renormalization group flow of the driving energy parameter can be obtained.\nThe Pfaffian near the time-reversal invariant momentum is revealed to display a\nuniversal critical behavior for a great variety of models examined.\n", "  We show that quarkonia-like states of a hidden SU(N) gauge group can account\nfor the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed by ATLAS and CMS, even with\nconstituents carrying standard model hypercharge only. The required hypercharge\nis modest, varying between about 1.3-1.6 for strong SU(N) coupling, to 2-3 for\nweak SU(N) coupling, for N=3, 4. This scenario predicts a variety of diphoton\nand multi-photon resonances, as well as photons from continuum pair production,\nand possibly exotic decays into standard model fermions, with no multi-jet\nresonances.\n", "  We present a new metric that uses the spectral curvature (SC) above 10 keV to\nidentify Compton-thick AGN in low-quality Swift BAT X-ray data. Using NuSTAR,\nwe observe nine high SC-selected AGN. We find that high-sensitivity spectra\nshow the majority are Compton-thick (78% or 7/9) and the remaining two are\nnearly Compton-thick (NH~5-8x10^23 cm^-2). We find the SC_bat and SC_nustar\nmeasurements are consistent, suggesting this technique can be applied to future\ntelescopes. We tested the SC method on well-known Compton-thick AGN and find it\nis much more effective than broad band ratios (e.g. 100% using SC vs. 20% using\n8-24/3-8 keV). Our results suggest that using the >10 keV emission may be the\nonly way to identify this population since only two sources show Compton-thick\nlevels of excess in the OIII to X-ray emission ratio (F_OIII/F_2-10 keV>1) and\nWISE colors do not identify most of them as AGN. Based on this small sample, we\nfind that a higher fraction of these AGN are in the final merger stage than\ntypical BAT AGN. Additionally, these nine obscured AGN have, on average, four\ntimes higher accretion rates than other BAT-detected AGN (Edd ratio=0.068\ncompared to 0.016). The robustness of SC at identifying Compton-thick AGN\nimplies a higher fraction of nearby AGN may be Compton-thick (~22%) and the sum\nof black hole growth in Compton-thick AGN (Eddington ratio times population\npercentage), is nearly as large as mildly obscured and unobscured AGN.\n", "  Massive galaxies are key probes to understand how the baryonic matter evolves\nwithin the dark matter halos. We use the \"archaeological\" approach to infer the\nstellar population properties and star formation histories of the most massive\n(M > 10^10.75 Msun) and passive early-type galaxies (ETGs) at 0 < z < 0.3,\nbased on stacked, high signal to noise ratio (SNR), Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nspectra. We exploit the information present in the full-spectrum by means of\nthe STARLIGHT public code to retrieve the ETGs evolutionary properties, such as\nage, metallicity and star formation history. We find that the stellar\nmetallicities are slightly supersolar (Z ~ 0.027 +/- 0.002) and do not depend\non redshift. Dust extinction is very low, with a mean of Av ~ 0.08 +/- 0.03\nmag. The ETGs show an anti-hierarchical evolution (downsizing) where more\nmassive galaxies are older. The SFHs can be approximated by a parametric\nfunction of the form SFR(t) \\propto \\tau^-(c+1) t^(c) exp(-t/\\tau), with\ntypical short e-folding times of \\tau ~ 0.6 - 0.8 Gyr (and a dispersion of +/-\n0.1 Gyr) and c ~ 0.1 (and a dispersion of +/- 0.05). The inferred SFHs are also\nused to place constraints on the properties and evolution of the ETG\nprogenitors. In particular, the ETGs of our samples should have formed most\nstars through a phase of vigorous star formation (SFRs > 350-400 Msun yr^-1) at\nz ~ 4 - 5, and are quiescent by z ~ 1.5 -2. Our results represent an attempt to\ndemonstrate quantitatively the evolutionary link between the most massive ETGs\nat z < 0.3 and the properties of suitable progenitors at high redshifts, also\nshowing that the full-spectrum fitting is a powerful approach to reconstruct\nthe star formation histories of massive quiescent galaxies.\n", "  How the accreted mass settling on the surface of a neutron star affects the\ntopology of the magnetic field and how the secular evolution of the binary\nsystem depends on the magnetic field change is still an open issue. We report\nevidence for a clear drop in the observed magnetic field in the accreting\npulsar V0332+53 after undergoing a bright 3-month long X-ray outburst. We\ndetermine the field from the position of the fundamental cyclotron line in its\nX-ray spectrum and relate it to the luminosity. For equal levels of luminosity,\nin the declining phase we measure a systematically lower value of the cyclotron\nline energy with respect to the rising phase. This results in a drop of ~1.7 x\n10^11 G of the observed field between the onset and the end of the outburst.\nThe settling of the accreted plasma onto the polar cap seems to induce a\ndistortion of the magnetic field lines weakening their intensity along the\naccretion columns. Therefore the dissipation rate of the magnetic field could\nbe much faster than previously estimated, unless the field is able to restore\nits original configuration on a time-scale comparable with the outbursts\nrecurrence time.\n", "  Color octet bosons are a universal prediction of models in which the 750 GeV\ndiphoton resonance corresponds to a pion of a QCD-like composite sector. We\nshow that the existing searches for dijet and photon plus jet resonances at the\nLHC constrain single productions of color octet states and can be translated\ninto stringent limits on the 750 GeV diphoton rate. For a minimal 5 + 5bar\nmodel, the 750 GeV diphoton signal cross section at the 13 TeV LHC is\nconstrained to be below around 5 fb. Future LHC searches for the photon plus\njet resonances can establish evidence of a new color-octet state with 20/fb and\nvalidate a pion-like explanation for the 750 GeV resonance.\n", "  The miscibility of two interacting quantum systems is an important testing\nground for the understanding of complex quantum systems. Two-component\nBose-Einstein condensates enable the investigation of this scenario in a\nparticularly well controlled setting. In a homogeneous system, the transition\nbetween mixed and separated phases is fully characterised by a `miscibility\nparameter', based on the ratio of intra- to inter-species interaction\nstrengths. Here we show, however, that this parameter is no longer the optimal\none for trapped gases, for which the location of the phase boundary depends\ncritically on atom numbers. We demonstrate how monitoring of damping rates and\nfrequencies of dipole oscillations enables the experimental mapping of the\nphase diagram by numerical implementation of a fully self-consistent\nfinite-temperature kinetic theory for binary condensates. The change in damping\nrate is explained in terms of surface oscillation in the immiscible regime, and\ncounterflow instability in the miscible regime, with collisions becoming only\nimportant in the long time evolution.\n", "  The strength of the amplitudes for the coupling between the bottomonium\n$\\Upsilon(nS)$ states, the bottomonium-like isovector resonances $Z_b$ and a\npion, $\\Upsilon(nS) Z_b \\pi$, is considered. These amplitudes describe the\ndecays $Z_b \\to \\Upsilon(nS) \\pi$ for $n=1,\\,2,\\,3$, and the processes\n$\\Upsilon(nS) \\to Z_b \\pi$ for $n=5,\\,6, \\ldots$ with either $Z_b(10610)$ or\n$Z_b(10650)$. It is pointed out that analyticity and unitarity impose a sum\nrule for these couplings to each of the $Z_b$ resonances. With the currently\navailable data it appears to be difficult or impossible to simultaneously\nsatisfy the sum rules for the $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ resonances. This\ndifficulty can be resolved if there is a considerable dissimilarity in the\nyield of the states $Z_b(10610) \\pi$ and $Z_b(10650) \\pi$ in the $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at energies above the $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonance.\n", "  We consider the question of entanglement conservation in the context of the\nER=EPR correspondence equating quantum entanglement with wormholes. In quantum\nmechanics, the entanglement between a system and its complement is conserved\nunder unitary operations that act independently on each; ER=EPR suggests that\nan analogous statement should hold for wormholes. We accordingly prove a new\narea theorem in general relativity: for a collection of dynamical wormholes and\nblack holes in a spacetime satisfying the null curvature condition, the maximin\narea for a subset of the horizons (giving the largest area attained by the\nminimal cross section of the multi-wormhole throat separating the subset from\nits complement) is invariant under classical time evolution along the outermost\napparent horizons. The evolution can be completely general, including horizon\nmergers and the addition of classical matter satisfying the null energy\ncondition. This theorem is the gravitational dual of entanglement conservation\nand thus constitutes an explicit characterization of the ER=EPR duality in the\nclassical limit.\n", "  The Curiosity rover recently detected a background of 0.7 ppb and spikes of 7\nppb of methane on Mars. This in situ measurement reorients our understanding of\nthe Martian environment and its potential for life, as the current theories do\nnot entail any geological source or sink of methane that varies sub-annually.\nIn particular, the 10-fold elevation during the southern winter indicates\nepisodic sources of methane that are yet to be discovered. Here we suggest a\nnear-surface reservoir could explain this variability. Using the temperature\nand humidity measurements from the rover, we find that perchlorate salts in the\nregolith deliquesce to form liquid solutions, and deliquescence progresses to\ndeeper subsurface in the season of the methane spikes. We therefore formulate\nthe following three testable hypotheses. The first scenario is that the\nregolith in Gale Crater adsorbs methane when dry and releases this methane to\nthe atmosphere upon deliquescence. The adsorption energy needs to be 36 kJ/mol\nto explain the magnitude of the methane spikes, higher than existing laboratory\nmeasurements. The second scenario is that microorganisms convert organic matter\nin the soil to methane when they are in liquid solutions. This scenario does\nnot require regolith adsorption, but entails extant life on Mars. The third\nscenario is that deep subsurface aquifers produce the bursts of methane.\nContinued in situ measurements of methane and water, as well as laboratory\nstudies of adsorption and deliquescence, will test these hypotheses and inform\nthe existence of the near-surface reservoir and its exchange with the\natmosphere.\n", "  Symbiotic star surveys have traditionally relied almost exclusively on low\nresolution optical spectroscopy. However, we can obtain a more reliable\nestimate of their total Galactic population by using all available signatures\nof the symbiotic phenomenon. Here we report the discovery of a hard X-ray\nsource, 4PBC J0642.9+5528, in the Swift hard X-ray all-sky survey, and identify\nit with a poorly studied red giant, SU Lyn, using pointed Swift observations\nand ground-based optical spectroscopy. The X-ray spectrum, the optical to UV\nspectrum, and the rapid UV variability of SU Lyn are all consistent with our\ninterpretation that it is a symbiotic star containing an accreting white dwarf.\nThe symbiotic nature of SU Lyn went unnoticed until now, because it does not\nexhibit emission lines strong enough to be obvious in low resolution spectra.\nWe argue that symbiotic stars without shell-burning have weak emission lines,\nand that the current lists of symbiotic stars are biased in favor of\nshell-burning systems. We conclude that the true population of symbiotic stars\nhas been underestimated, potentially by a large factor.\n", "  A micro-electro-mechanical system vibrating in its shear mode was used to\nstudy the viscosity of normal liquid $^3$He from 20mK to 770mK at 3bar, 21bar,\nand 29bar. The damping coefficient of the oscillator was determined by\nfrequency sweeps through its resonance at each temperature. Using a slide film\ndamping model, the viscosity of the fluid was obtained. Our viscosity values\nare compared with previous measurements and with calculated values from Fermi\nliquid theory. The crossover from the classical to the Fermi liquid regime is\nmanifest in the temperature dependence of viscosity. In the Fermi liquid\nregime, the temperature dependence of viscosity changes from $T^{-1}$ to\n$T^{-2}$ on cooling, indicating a transition from the Stokes flow to the\nCouette flow regime.\n", "  Current observational evidence suggests that the star formation rate (SFR)\nefficiency of neutral atomic hydrogen gas measured in Damped Ly-alpha Systems\n(DLAs) at z~3 is more than 10 times lower than predicted by the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. To understand the origin of this deficit, and\nto investigate possible evolution with redshift and galaxy properties, we\nmeasure the SFR efficiency of atomic gas at z~1, z~2, and z~3 around\nstar-forming galaxies. We use new robust photometric redshifts in the Hubble\nUltra Deep Field to create galaxy stacks in these three redshift bins, and\nmeasure the SFR efficiency by combining DLA absorber statistics with the\nobserved rest-frame UV emission in the galaxies' outskirts. We find that the\nSFR efficiency of HI gas at z>1 is ~1-3% of that predicted by the KS relation.\nContrary to simulations and models that predict a reduced SFR efficiency with\ndecreasing metallicity and thus with increasing redshift, we find no\nsignificant evolution in the SFR efficiency with redshift. Our analysis instead\nsuggests that the reduced SFR efficiency is driven by the low molecular content\nof this atomic-dominated phase, with metallicity playing a secondary effect in\nregulating the conversion between atomic and molecular gas. This interpretation\nis supported by the similarity between the observed SFR efficiency and that\nobserved in local atomic-dominated gas, such as in the outskirts of local\nspiral galaxies and local dwarf galaxies.\n", "  By extending the $\\Phi$-derivable approach in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to\nfinite magnetic field we calculate the properties of pion, $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$\nmesons in a magnetic field at finite temperature in not only the\nquark-antiquark bound state scheme but also the pion-pion scattering resonant\nstate scenario. Our calculation results manifest that the masses of $\\pi^{0}$\nand $\\sigma$ meson can be nearly degenerate at the pseudo-critical temperature\nwhich increases with increasing the magnetic field strength, and the\n$\\pi^{\\pm}$ mass ascends suddenly at almost the same critical temperature.\nWhile the $\\rho$ mesons' masses decrease with the temperature but increase with\nthe magnetic field strength. We also check the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation\nand find that the relation can be violated obviously with increasing the\ntemperature, and the effect of the magnetic field becomes pronounced around the\ncritical temperature. With different criteria, we analyze the effect of the\nmagnetic field on the chiral phase transition and find that the pseudo-critical\ntemperature of the chiral phase cross, $T_{c}^{\\chi}$, is always enhanced by\nthe magnetic field. Moreover our calculations indicate that the $\\rho$ mesons\nwill get melted as the chiral symmetry has not yet been restored, but the\n$\\sigma$ meson does not disassociate even at very high temperature.\nParticularly, it is the first to show that there does not exist vector meson\ncondensate in the QCD vacuum in the pion-pion scattering scheme.\n", "  When combining lumped mesoscopic electronic components to form a circuit,\nquantum fluctuations of electrical quantities lead to a non-linear\nelectromagnetic interaction between the components that is not generally\nunderstood. The Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism that is frequently used to\ndescribe non-interacting coherent mesoscopic components is not directly suited\nto describe such circuits since it assumes perfect voltage bias, i.e. the\nabsence of fluctuations. Here, we show that for short coherent conductors of\narbitrary transmission, the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism can be extended to\ntake into account quantum voltage fluctuations similarly to what is done for\ntunnel junctions. The electrodynamics of the whole circuit is then formally\nworked out disregarding the non-Gaussianity of fluctuations. This reveals how\nthe aforementioned non-linear interaction operates in short coherent\nconductors: voltage fluctuations induce a reduction of conductance through the\nphenomenon of dynamical Coulomb blockade but they also modify their internal\ndensity of states leading to an additional electrostatic modification of the\ntransmission. Using this approach we can account quantitatively for conductance\nmeasurements performed on Quantum Point Contacts in series with impedances of\nthe order of $R_K = h / e^2$. Our work should enable a better engineering of\nquantum circuits with targeted properties.\n", "  Recently, anomalous subdiffusion, aging, and scatter of the diffusion\ncoefficient have been reported in many single-particle-tracking experiments,\nthough origins of these behaviors are still elusive. Here, as a model to\ndescribe such phenomena, we investigate a Langevin equation with diffusivity\nfluctuating between a fast and a slow state. We assume that the sojourn time\ndistributions of these two states are given by power laws. It is shown that,\nfor a non-equilibrium ensemble, the ensemble-averaged mean square displacement\n(MSD) shows transient subdiffusion. In contrast, the time-averaged MSD shows\nnormal diffusion, but an effective diffusion coefficient transiently shows\naging behavior. The propagator is non-Gaussian for short time, and converges to\na Gaussian distribution in a long time limit; this convergence to Gaussian is\nextremely slow for some parameter values. For equilibrium ensembles, both\nensemble-averaged and time-averaged MSDs show only normal diffusion, and thus\nwe cannot detect any traces of the fluctuating diffusivity with these MSDs.\nTherefore, as an alternative approach to characterize the fluctuating\ndiffusivity, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the time-averaged MSD is\nutilized, and it is shown that the RSD exhibits slow relaxation as a signature\nof the long-time correlation in the fluctuating diffusivity. Furthermore, it is\nshown that the RSD is related to a non-Gaussian parameter of the propagator. To\nobtain these theoretical results, we develop a two-state renewal theory as an\nanalytical tool.\n", "  Cassiopeia A (Cas A) as the nearby young remnant of a core-collapse supernova\nis the best candidate for astrophysical studies in supernova explosion and its\nenvironment. We studied hard X-ray emissions from Cas A using the ten-year data\nof INTEGRAL observations, and first detected non-thermal continuum emission\nfrom the source up to 220 keV. The $^{44}$Ti line emissions at 68 and 78 keV\nare confirmed by our observations with a mean flux of $\\sim (2.2\\pm 0.4)\\times\n10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $^{44}$Ti yield in Cas A of\n$(1.3\\pm 0.4)\\times 10^{-4}$ \\ms. The continuum emission from 3 -- 500 keV can\nbe fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung of $kT\\sim 0.79\\pm 0.08$ keV plus a\npower-law model of $\\Gamma \\sim 3.13\\pm 0.03$. The non-thermal emission from\nCas A is well fitted with a power-law model without a cutoff up to 220 keV.\nThis radiation characteristic is inconsistent with the diffusive shock\nacceleration models with the remnant shock velocity of only 5000km s$^{-1}$.\nThe central compact object in Cas A cannot contribute to the emission above 80\nkeV significantly. Some possible physical origins of the non-thermal emission\nabove 80 keV from the remnant shock are discussed. We deduce that the\nasymmetrical supernova explosion scenario of Cas A is a promising scenario to\nproduce high energy synchrotron radiation photons, where a part of ejecta with\nthe velocity of $\\sim 0.1c$ and opening angle of $\\sim10^\\circ$ can account for\nthe 100-keV emission, consistent with the \"jet\" observed in Cas A.\n", "  The dependence of the Landau gauge two point gluon and ghost correlation\nfunctions on the lattice spacing and on the physical volume are investigated\nfor pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions using lattice simulations.\nWe present data from very large lattices up to $128^4$ and for two lattice\nspacings $0.10$ fm and $0.06$ fm corresponding to volumes of $\\sim$ (13 fm)$^4$\nand $\\sim$ (8 fm)$^4$, respectively. Our results show that, for sufficiently\nlarge physical volumes, both propagators have a mild dependence on the lattice\nvolume. On the other hand, the gluon and ghost propagators change with the\nlattice spacing $a$ in the infrared region, with the gluon propagator having a\nstronger dependence on $a$ compared to the ghost propagator. In what concerns\nthe strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s (p^2)$, as defined from gluon and ghost\ntwo point functions, the simulations show a sizeable dependence on the lattice\nspacing for the infrared region and for momenta up to $\\sim 1$ GeV.\n", "  I present approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (aNNLO) total and\ndifferential cross sections for charged Higgs production in association with a\ntop quark at LHC energies. The aNNLO results for the process $bg \\rightarrow\ntH^-$ are derived from next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) resummation of\nsoft-gluon corrections. Scale and parton-distribution uncertainties for the\ncross sections are shown. The top-quark transverse-momentum and rapidity\ndistributions are also calculated.\n", "  We study the purely leptonic decays of $W^\\pm \\to e^\\pm e^\\pm \\mu^\\mp \\nu$\nand $\\mu^\\pm \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp \\nu$ produced at the LHC, induced by sterile\nneutrinos with mass $m_N$ below $M_W$ in the intermediate state. Since the\nfinal state neutrino escapes detection, one cannot tell whether this process\nviolates lepton number, what would indicate a Majorana character for the\nintermediate sterile neutrino. Our study shows that when the sterile neutrino\nmixings with electrons and muons are different enough, one can still\ndiscriminate between the Dirac and Majorana character of this intermediate\nneutrino by simply counting and comparing the above decay rates. After\nperforming collider simulations and statistical analysis, we find that at the\n$14~\\text{TeV}$ LHC with an integrated luminosity of $3000~\\text{fb}^{-1}$, for\ntwo benchmark scenarios $m_N$ = 20 GeV and 50 GeV, at least a $3\\sigma$ level\nof exclusion on the Dirac case can be achieved for disparities as mild as e.g.\n$|U_{Ne}|^2 < 0.7~ |U_{N\\mu}|^2$ or $|U_{N\\mu}|^2 < 0.7~ |U_{N e}|^2$, provided\nthat $|U_{Ne}|^2$, $|U_{N\\mu}|^2$ are both above $\\sim 2\\times 10^{-6}$.\n", "  We study the dynamical evolution toward steady state of the stochastic\nnon-equilibrium model known as totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, in\nboth uniform and non-uniform (staggered) one-dimensional systems with open\nboundaries. Domain-wall theory and numerical simulations are used and, where\npertinent, their results are compared to existing mean-field predictions and\nexact solutions where available. For uniform chains we find that the inclusion\nof fluctuations inherent to the domain-wall formulation plays a crucial role in\nproviding good agreement with simulations, which is severely lacking in the\ncorresponding mean-field predictions. For alternating-bond chains the\ndomain-wall predictions for the features of the phase diagram in the parameter\nspace of injection and ejection rates turn out to be realized only in an\nincipient and quantitatively approximate way. Nevertheless, significant\nquantitative agreement can be found between several additional domain-wall\ntheory predictions and numerics.\n", "  The separate universe technique provides a means of establishing consistency\nrelations between short wavelength observables and the long wavelength matter\ndensity fluctuations within which they evolve by absorbing the latter into the\ncosmological background. We extend it to cases where non-gravitational forces\nintroduce a Jeans scale in other species like dynamical dark energy or massive\nneutrinos. The technique matches the synchronous gauge matter density\nfluctuations to the local expansion using the acceleration equation and\naccounts for the temporal nonlocality and scale dependence of the long\nwavelength response of small scale matter observables, e.g. the nonlinear power\nspectrum, halo abundance and the implied halo bias, and $N$-point correlation\nfunctions. Above the Jeans scale, the local Friedmann equation relates the\nexpansion to real energy densities and a curvature that is constant in comoving\ncoordinates. Below the Jeans scale, the curvature evolves and acts like a fake\ndensity component. In all cases, the matter evolution on small scales is\ncorrectly modeled as we illustrate using scalar field dark energy with\nadiabatic or isocurvature initial conditions across the Jeans scale set by its\nfinite sound speed.\n", "  We have argued previously, based on the analysis of two-dimensional stringy\nblack holes, that information in stringy versions of four-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black holes (whose singular regions are represented by\nappropriate Wess-Zumino-Witten models) is retained by quantum $W$-symmetries\nwhen the horizon area is not preserved due to Hawking radiation. It is key that\nthe exactly-marginal conformal world-sheet operator representing a massless\nstringy particle interacting with the black hole requires a contribution from\n$W_\\infty$ generators in its vertex function. The latter correspond to\ndelocalised, non-propagating, string excitations that guarantee the transfer of\ninformation between the string black hole and external particles. When\ninfalling matter crosses the horizon, these topological states are excited via\na process: (Stringy black hole) + infalling matter $\\rightarrow $ (Stringy\nblack hole)$^\\star$, where the black hole is viewed as a stringy state with a\nspecific configuration of $W_\\infty$ charges that are conserved. Hawking\nradiation is then the reverse process, with conservation of the $W_\\infty$\ncharges retaining information. The Hawking radiation spectrum near the horizon\nof a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole is specified by matrix elements of\nhigher-order currents that form a phase-space $W_{1+\\infty}$ algebra. We show\nthat an appropriate gauging of this algebra preserves the horizon\ntwo-dimensional area classically, as expected because the latter is a conserved\nNoether charge.\n", "  WISE J104915.57-531906.1 is the nearest brown dwarf binary to our Solar\nsystem, consisting of two brown dwarfs in the L/T transition: Luhman 16A & B.\nIn this paper we present the first map of Luhman 16A, and maps of Luhman 16B\nfor two epochs. Our maps were created by applying Aeolus, a Markov-Chain Monte\nCarlo code that maps the top-of-the-atmosphere structure of brown dwarf and\nother ultracool atmospheres, to light curves of Luhman 16A & B using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope's G141 and G102 grisms. Aeolus retrieved three or four spots in\nthe top-of-the-atmosphere of Luhman 16A & B, with a surface coverage of 19%-32%\n(depending on an assumed rotational period of 5 hr or 8 hr) or 21%-38.5%\n(depending on the observational epoch) respectively. The brightness temperature\nof the spots of the best-fit models was ~200 K hotter than the background\ntop-of-the-atmosphere. We compared our Luhman 16B map with the only previously\npublished map. Interestingly, our map contained a large, cooler (DT~51 K) than\nthe background top-of-the-atmosphere spot that lay at low latitudes, in\nagreement with the previous Luhman 16B map. Finally, we report the detection of\na feature reappearing in Luhman 16B light curves that are separated by tens of\nhundreds of rotations from each other. We speculate this feature is related to\ntop-of-the-atmosphere structures of Luhman 16B.\n", "  We use the latest compilation of observational Hubble parameter measurements\nestimated with the differential evolution of cosmic chronometers, in\ncombination with the local value of the Hubble constant recently measured with\n2.4% precision, to constrain the cosmological scenario where dark energy\ninteracts directly with the dark matter sector. To diminish the degeneracy\nbetween the parameters we additionally consider standard probes, such as\nSupernovae Type Ia from joint light curves (JLA) sample, Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation distance measurements (BAO), and cosmic microwave background data\nfrom Planck 2015 estimations. Our analysis shows that the direct interaction\nbetween dark energy and dark matter is mildly flavored, while the dark energy\nequation-of-state parameter is w < - 1 at 3$\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  The Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) homologous series Sr$_{n+1}$Ti$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$\nprovides a useful template for the study and control of the effects of\ndimensionality and quantum confinement on the excited state properties of the\ncomplex oxide SrTiO$_3$. We use ab initio many-body perturbation theory within\nthe $GW$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach to calculate\nquasiparticle energies and absorption spectrum of Sr$_{n+1}$Ti$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$\nfor $n=1-5$ and $\\infty$. Our computed direct and indirect optical gaps are in\nexcellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements. The calculated optical\nspectra reproduce the main experimental features and reveal excitonic structure\nnear the gap edge. We find that electron-hole interactions are important across\nthe series, leading to significant exciton binding energies that increase for\nsmall $n$ and reach a value of 330~meV for $n=1$, a trend attributed to\nincreased quantum confinement. We find that the lowest-energy singlet exciton\nof Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ ($n=1$) localizes in the 2D plane defined by the TiO$_2$\nlayer, and explain the origin of its localization.\n", "  We revisit the problem of predicting the spin magnitude and direction of the\nblack hole resulting from the merger of two black holes with arbitrary masses\nand spins inspiralling in quasi-circular orbits. We do this by analyzing a\ncatalog of 619 recent numerical-relativity simulations collected from the\nliterature and spanning a large variety of initial conditions. By combining\ninformation from the post-Newtonian approximation, the extreme mass-ratio limit\nand perturbative calculations, we improve our previously proposed\nphenomenological formulae for the final remnant spin. In contrast with\nalternative suggestions in the literature, and in analogy with our previous\nexpressions, the new formula is a simple algebraic function of the initial\nsystem parameters and is not restricted to binaries with spins\naligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, but can be employed for\nfully generic binaries. The accuracy of the new expression is significantly\nimproved, especially for almost extremal progenitor spins and for small mass\nratios, yielding a root-mean-square error $\\sigma\\approx0.002$ for\naligned/anti-aligned binaries and $\\sigma\\approx0.006$ for generic binaries.\nOur new formula is suitable for cosmological applications and can be employed\nrobustly in the analysis of the gravitational waveforms from advanced\ninterferometric detectors.\n", "  We conducted survey observations of a glycine precursor, methanimine or\nmethylenimine (CH$_2$NH), with the NRO 45 m telescope and the SMT telescope\ntowards 12 high-mass and two low-mass star-forming regions in order to increase\nnumber of CH$_2$NH sources and to better understand the characteristics of\nCH2NH sources. As a result of our survey, CH$_2$NH was detected in eight\nsources, including four new sources. The estimated fractional abundances were\n~10$^8$ in Orion KL and G10.47+0.03, while they were ~10$^9$ towards the other\nsources. Our hydrogen recombination line and past studies suggest that\nCH$_2$NH-rich sources have less evolved HII regions. The less destruction rates\nby UV flux from the central star would be contributed to the high CH$_2$NH\nabundances towards CH$_2$NH-rich sources. Our gas-grain chemical simulations\nsuggest that CH$_2$NH is mostly formed in the gas-phase by neutral-neutral\nreactions rather than the product of thermal evaporation from the dust\nsurfaces.\n", "  In the list of young stellar objects compiled by Megeath et al. (2012) for\nthe Orion A molecular cloud, only 44 out of 1208 sources found projected onto\nlow extinction (Ak<0.8 mag) gas are identified as protostars. These objects are\npuzzling because protostars are not typically expected to be associated with\nextended low extinction material. Here, we use high resolution extinction maps\ngenerated from Herschel data, optical/infrared and Spitzer Space Telescope\nphotometry and spectroscopy of the low extinction protostellar candidate\nsources to determine if they are likely true protostellar sources or\ncontaminants. Out of 44 candidate objects, we determine that 10 sources are\nlikely protostars, with the rest being more evolved young stellar objects (18),\ngalaxies (4), false detections of nebulosity and cloud edges (9), or real\nsources for which more data are required to ascertain their nature (3). We find\nnone of the confirmed protostars to be associated with recognizable dense cores\nand we briefly discuss possible origins for these orphaned objects.\n", "  A significant fraction of all metal-poor stars are carbon-rich. Most of these\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars also show enhancement in elements\nproduced mainly by the s-process (CEMP-s stars) and evidence suggests that the\norigin of these non-standard abundances can be traced to mass transfer from a\nbinary asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. Thus, observations of CEMP-s\nstars are commonly used to infer the nucleosynthesis output of low-metallicity\nAGB stars. A crucial step in this exercise is understanding what happens to the\naccreted material after mass transfer ceases. Here we present models of the\npost-mass-transfer evolution of CEMP-s stars considering the physics of\nthermohaline mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative levitation. We\nfind that stars with typical CEMP-s star masses (M ~ 0.85 Msun) have very\nshallow convective envelopes (Menv < 1e-7 Msun). Hence, the surface abundance\nvariations arising from the competition between gravitational settling and\nradiative levitation should be orders of magnitude larger than observed (e.g.\n[C/Fe]<-1 or [C/Fe]>+4). We are therefore unable to reproduce the spread in the\nobserved abundances with these models and conclude that some other physical\nprocess must largely suppress atomic diffusion in the outer layers of CEMP-s\nstars. We demonstrate that this could be achieved by some additional\n(turbulent) mixing process operating at the base of the convective envelope, as\nfound by other authors. Alternatively, mass-loss rates around 1e-13 Msun/yr\ncould also negate most of the abundance variations by eroding the surface\nlayers and forcing the base of the convective envelope to move inwards in mass.\nSince atomic diffusion cannot have a substantial effect on the surface\nabundances of CEMP-s stars, the dilution of the accreted material, while\nvariable in degree from one star to the next, is most likely the same for all\nelements.\n", "  We study the effects of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy\nproperties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems\nin the COSMOS field at $z\\lesssim$ 3. We show that at $z\\lesssim$ 1, the median\nstar-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on\nenvironment, but they become independent of environment at $z\\gtrsim$ 1.\nHowever, we find that only for \\textit{star-forming} galaxies, the median SFR\nand sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and\nstellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at\n$z\\lesssim$ 1, and on stellar mass out to $z\\sim$ 3. We show that at\n$z\\lesssim$ 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that\nthe overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time.\nEnvironmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At $z\\lesssim$\n1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses\n(log($M/M_{\\odot}$)$\\gtrsim$ 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of\nmassive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more\nefficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency\n($\\epsilon_{mass}$) for more massive galaxies (log($M/M_{\\odot}$)$\\gtrsim$\n10.2) rises with cosmic time until $z\\sim$ 1 and flattens out since then.\nHowever, for less massive galaxies, the rise in $\\epsilon_{mass}$ continues to\nthe present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only\nrelevant at $z\\lesssim$ 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the\ndominant mechanism at $z\\gtrsim$ 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.\n", "  In recent years, temperature scales in cool supergiants (CSGs) have been\ndisputed, and the possibility that spectral types (SpTs) do not depend\nprimarily on temperature has been raised. We explore the relations between\ndifferent observed parameters and the capability of deriving accurate intrinsic\nstellar parameters from them through the analysis of the largest spectroscopic\nsample of CSGs to date from SMC and LMC. We explore possible correlations\nbetween different observational parameters, also making use of near- and\nmid-infrared colours and literature on photometric variability. Direct\ncomparison between the behaviour of atomic lines (Fe I, Ti I, and Ca II) in the\nobserved spectra and synthetic atmospheric models provides compelling evidence\nthat effective temperature is the prime underlying variable driving the SpT\nsequence in CSGs. However, there is a clear correlation between SpT and\nluminosity, with later ones tending to correspond to more luminous stars with\nheavier mass loss. The population of CSGs in the SMC is characterised by a\nhigher degree of spectral variability, early spectral types (centred on type\nK1) and low mass-loss rates (at least as measured by dust-sensitive\nmid-infrared colours). The population in the LMC displays less spectroscopic\nvariability and later spectral types. The distribution of spectral types is not\nsingle-peaked. Instead, the brightest CSGs have a significantly different\ndistribution from less luminous objects, presenting mostly M subtypes (centred\non M2), and increasing mass-loss rates for later types. In conclusion, the\nobserved properties of CSGs in the SMC and the LMC cannot be described\ncorrectly by standard evolutionary models. The very strong correlation between\nspectral type and bolometric luminosity, supported by all data from the Milky\nWay, cannot be reproduced at all by current evolutionary tracks.\n", "  We perform adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) cosmological zoom simulations of a region around a forming galaxy\ncluster, comparing the ability of the methods to handle successively more\ncomplex baryonic physics. In the simplest, non-radiative case, the two methods\nare in good agreement with each other, but the SPH simulations generate central\ncores with slightly lower entropies and virial shocks at slightly larger radii,\nconsistent with what has been seen in previous studies. The inclusion of\nradiative cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback leads to much larger\ndifferences between the two methods. Most dramatically, at z=5, rapid cooling\nin the AMR case moves the accretion shock well within the virial radius, while\nthis shock remains near the virial radius in the SPH case, due to excess\nheating, coupled with poorer capturing of the shock width. On the other hand,\nthe addition of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the simulations\nresults in much better agreement between the methods. In this case both\nsimulations display halo gas entropies of 100 keV cm^2, similar decrements in\nthe star-formation rate, and a drop in the halo baryon content of roughly 30%.\nThis is consistent with AGN growth being self-regulated, regardless of the\nnumerical method. However, the simulations with AGN feedback continue to differ\nin aspects that are not self-regulated, such that in SPH a larger volume of gas\nis impacted by feedback, and the cluster still has a lower entropy central\ncore.\n", "  For the hot exoplanets CoRoT-24b and CoRoT-24c, observations have provided\ntransit radii R$_{\\rm T}$ of 3.7$\\pm$0.4 R$_{\\oplus}$ and 4.9$\\pm$0.5\nR$_{\\oplus}$, and masses of $\\le$5.7 M$_{\\oplus}$ and 28$\\pm$11 M$_{\\oplus}$,\nrespectively. We study their upper atmosphere structure and escape applying an\nhydrodynamic model. Assuming R$_{\\rm T} \\approx$ R$_{\\rm PL}$, where R$_{\\rm\nPL}$ is the planetary radius at the pressure of 100 mbar, we obtained for\nCoRoT-24b unrealistically high thermally-driven hydrodynamic escape rates. This\nis due to the planet's high temperature and low gravity, independent of the\nstellar EUV flux. Such high escape rates could last only for $<$100 Myr, while\nR$_{\\rm PL}$ shrinks till the escape rate becomes less than or equal to the\nmaximum possible EUV-driven escape rate. For CoRoT-24b, R$_{\\rm PL}$ must be\ntherefore located at $\\approx 1.9-2.2$ R$_{\\oplus}$ and high altitude\nhazes/clouds possibly extinct the light at R$_{\\rm T}$. Our analysis\nconstraints also the planet's mass to be 5$-$5.7 M$_{\\oplus}$. For CoRoT-24c,\nR$_{\\rm PL}$ and R$_{\\rm T}$ lie too close together to be distinguished in the\nsame way. Similar differences between R$_{\\rm PL}$ and R$_{\\rm T}$ may be\npresent also for other hot, low-density sub-Neptunes.\n", "  Computational atomic-scale methods continue to provide new information about\ngeometry, energetics, and transition states for interstitial elements in\ncrystalline lattices. This data can be used to determine the diffusivity of\ninterstitials by finding steady-state solutions to the master equation. In\naddition, atomic-scale computations can provide not just the site energy, but\nalso the stress in the cell due to the introduction of the defect to compute\nthe elastic dipole. We derive a general expression for the fully anistropic\ndiffusivity tensor from site and transition state energies, and three\nderivatives of the diffusivity: the elastodiffusion tensor (derivative of\ndiffusivity with respect to strain), the activation barrier tensor (logarithmic\nderivative of diffusivity with respect to inverse temperature) and activation\nvolume tensor (logarithmic derivative of diffusivity with respect to pressure).\nComputation of these quantities takes advantage of crystalline symmetry, and we\nprovide an open-source implementation of the algorithm. We provide analytic\nresults for octahedral-tetrahedral networks in face-centered cubic,\nbody-centered cubic, and hexagonal closed-packed lattices, and conclude with\nnumerical results for C in Fe.\n", "  We report the operation of a cold-atom inertial sensor in a joint\ninterrogation scheme, where we simultaneously prepare a cold-atom source and\noperate an atom interferometer in order to eliminate dead times. Noise aliasing\nand dead times are consequences of the sequential operation which is intrinsic\nto cold-atom atom interferometers. Both phenomena have deleterious effects on\nthe performance of these sensors. We show that our continuous operation\nimproves the short-term sensitivity of atom interferometers, by demonstrating a\nrecord rotation sensitivity of $100$ nrad.s$^{-1}/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ in a cold-atom\ngyroscope of $11$ cm$^2$ Sagnac area. We also demonstrate a rotation stability\nof $1$ nrad.s$^{-1}$ after $10^4$ s of integration, improving previous results\nby an order of magnitude. We expect that the continuous operation will allow\ncold-atom inertial sensors with long interrogation time to reach their full\nsensitivity, determined by the quantum noise limit.\n", "  Violation of Mermin inequalities is tested on the 5-qubit IBM quantum\ncomputer. For 3, 4 and 5 parties, quantum states that violate the corresponding\nMermin inequalities are constructed using quantum circuits on superconducting\nqubits. Measurements on different basis are included as additional final gates\nin the circuits. The experimental results obtained using the quantum computer\nshow violation of all Mermin inequalitites, with a clear degradation of the\nresults in the 5 qubit case. Though this quantum computer is not competitive to\ntest Mermin inequalities as compared to other techniques when applied to few\nqubits, it does offer the opportunity to explore multipartite entanglement for\nfour and five qubits beyond the reach of other alternative technologies.\n", "  Motivated by recent interest in their applications, we report a systematic\nstudy of Cs atomic properties calculated by a high-precision relativistic\nall-order method. Excitation energies, reduced matrix elements, transition\nrates, and lifetimes are determined for levels with principal quantum numbers\n$n \\leq 12$ and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers $l \\leq 3$.\nRecommended values and estimates of uncertainties are provided for a number of\nelectric-dipole transitions and the electric dipole polarizabilities of the\n$ns$, $np$, and $nd$ states. We also report a calculation of the electric\nquadrupole polarizability of the ground state. We display the dynamic\npolarizabilities of the $6s$ and $7p$ states for optical wavelengths between\n1160 nm and 1800 nm and identify corresponding magic wavelengths for the\n$6s-7p_{1/2}$, $6s-7p_{3/2}$ transitions. The values of relevant matrix\nelements needed for polarizability calculations at other wavelengths are\nprovided.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) is one of the main drivers for transition from\nstar-forming disk to passive spheroidal galaxies. However, the role of\nlarge-scale environment versus one-on-one interactions in triggering different\ntypes of AGN is still uncertain. We present a statistical study of the\nprevalence of the nuclear activity in isolated galaxies and physically bound\nisolated pairs. For the purpose of this study we considered optically and radio\nselected nuclear activity types. We aim to assess the effect of one-on-one\ninteraction on the fraction of AGN and the role of their large-scale\nenvironment. To study the effect of one-on-one interaction on the fraction of\nAGN in isolated galaxy pairs, we compare with a sample of isolated galaxies\nhomogeneously selected under the same isolation criterion. We examine the\neffect of the large-scale environment by comparing with control samples of\nsingle galaxies and galaxy pairs. In general we found no difference in the\nprevalence of optical AGN for the considered samples. For massive galaxies, the\nfraction of optical AGN in isolated galaxies is slightly higher than that in\ncontrol samples. Also the fraction of passives in high mass isolated galaxies\nis smaller than in any other sample. Generally, there is no dependence on\noptical nuclear activity with local environment. On the other hand, we found\nevidence that radio AGN are strongly affected by the local environment. Optical\nAGN phenomenon is related to cold gas accretion, while radio AGN is related to\nhot gas accretion. In this context, there is more cold gas, fueling the central\noptical AGN, in isolated systems. Our results are in agreement with a scenario\nwhere cold gas accretion by secular evolution is the main driver of optical\nAGN, while hot gas accretion and one-on-one interactions are the main drivers\nof radio AGN activity.\n", "  The ability to directly follow and time resolve the rearrangement of the\nnuclei within molecules is a frontier of science that requires atomic spatial\nand few-femtosecond temporal resolutions. While laser induced electron\ndiffraction can meet these requirements, it was recently concluded that\nmolecules with particular orbital symmetries (such as {\\pi}g) cannot be imaged\nusing purely backscattering electron wave packets without molecular alignment.\nHere, we demonstrate, in direct contradiction to these findings, that the\norientation and shape of molecular orbitals presents no impediment for\nretrieving molecular structure with adequate sampling of the momentum transfer\nspace. We overcome previous issues by showcasing retrieval of the structure of\nrandomly oriented O2 and C2H2 molecules, with {\\pi}g and {\\pi}u symmetries,\nrespectively, and where their ionisation probabilities do not maximise along\ntheir molecular axes. While this removes a serious bottleneck for laser induced\ndiffraction imaging, we find unexpectedly strong back scattering contributions\nfrom low-Z atoms.\n", "  We assess current experimental constraints on the bi-doublet + singlet model\nof top compositeness previously proposed in the literature. This model extends\nthe standard model's spectrum by adding a custodially-embedded vector-like\nelectroweak bi-doublet of quarks and a vector-like electroweak singlet quark.\nWhile either of those states alone would produce a model in tension with\nconstraints from precision electroweak data, in combination they can produce a\nviable model. We show that current precision electroweak data, in the wake of\nthe Higgs discovery, accommodate the model and we explore the impact of direct\ncollider searches for the partners of the top quark.\n", "  We analyse structural decompositions of 500 late-type galaxies (Hubble\n$T$-type $\\ge 6$) from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies\n(S$^4$G), spanning a stellar mass range of about $10^7$ to a few times\n$10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$. Their decomposition parameters are compared with those of\nthe early-type dwarfs in the Virgo cluster from Janz et al. They have\nmorphological similarities, including the fact that the fraction of simple\none-component galaxies in both samples increases towards lower galaxy masses.\nWe find that in the late-type two-component galaxies both the inner and outer\nstructures are by a factor of two larger than those in the early-type dwarfs,\nfor the same stellar mass of the component. While dividing the late-type\ngalaxies to low and high density environmental bins, it is noticeable that both\nthe inner and outer components of late types in the high local galaxy density\nbin are smaller, and lie closer in size to those of the early-type dwarfs. This\nsuggests that, although structural differences between the late and early-type\ndwarfs are observed, environmental processes can plausibly transform their\nsizes sufficiently, thus linking them evolutionarily.\n", "  We present perturbation theory for analysis of generic third-order nonlinear\nprocesses in graphene integrated photonic structures. Optical response of\ngraphene is treated as the nonlinear boundary condition in Maxwell equations.\nThe derived models are applied for analysis of third harmonic generation in a\ngraphene coated dielectric micro-fibre. The efficiency of up to few percent is\npredicted when using sub-picosecond pump pulses with energies of the order of\n$0.1$nJ in a sub-millimeter long fibre, when operating near the resonance of\nthe graphene nonlinear conductivity $\\hbar\\omega=(2/3)E_F$.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of models of inflation with a large\nGauss-Bonnet coupling at late times, which have been shown to modify and\nprevent the end of inflation. Despite the potential of Gauss-Bonnet models in\npredicting favourable power spectra, capable of greatly lowering the\ntensor-to-scalar-ratio compared to now-disfavoured models of standard chaotic\ninflation, it is important to also understand in what context it is possible\nfor post-inflationary (p)reheating to proceed and hence recover an acceptable\nlate-time cosmology. We argue that in the previously-studied inverse power law\ncoupling case, reheating cannot happen due to a lack of oscillatory solutions\nfor the inflaton, and that neither instant preheating nor gravitational\nparticle production would avoid this problem due to the persistence of the\ninflaton's energy density, even if it were to partially decay. Hence we proceed\nto define a minimal generalisation of the model which can permit perturbative\nreheating and study the consequences of this, including heavily modified\ndynamics during reheating and predictions of the power spectra.\n", "  Using a specialized technique sensitive to the presence of expanding ionized\ngas we have detected a set of three concentric expanding shells in an HII\nregion in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. After mapping the kinematics in\nH{\\alpha} with Fabry-Perot spectroscopy we used slit spectra to measure the\nintensities of the [SII] doublet at {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 671.9, 673.1 nm and the\n[NII] doublet at {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 645.8, 658.3 nm to corroborate the\nkinematics and apply diagnostic tests using line ratios. These showed that the\nexpanding shells are shock dominated as would be the case if they had\noriginated with supernova explosions. Estimating their kinetic energies we find\nfairly low values, indicating a fairly advanced stage of evolution. We obtain\ndensity, mass and parent star mass estimates, which, along with the kinetic\nenergies, are inconsistent with the simplest models of shock-interstellar\nmedium interaction. We propose that the presence and properties of an\ninhomogeneous medium offer a scenario which can account for these observations,\nand discuss the implications. Comparing our results with data from the\nliterature supports the combined presence of an HII region and supernova\nremnant material at the observed position.\n", "  We analyze the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) density and its spatial gradient in\nForbush Decreases (FDs) observed with the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN)\nand neutron monitors (NMs). By superposing the GCR density and density gradient\nobserved in FDs following 45 interplanetary shocks (IP-shocks), each associated\nwith an identified eruption on the sun, we infer the average spatial\ndistribution of GCRs behind IP-shocks. We find two distinct modulations of GCR\ndensity in FDs, one in the magnetic sheath and the other in the coronal mass\nejection (CME) behind the sheath. The density modulation in the sheath is\ndominant in the western flank of the shock, while the modulation in the CME\nejecta stands out in the eastern flank. This east-west asymmetry is more\nprominent in GMDN data responding to $\\sim$ 60 GV GCRs than in NM data\nresponding to $\\sim$ 10 GV GCRs, because of softer rigidity spectrum of the\nmodulation in the CME ejecta than in the sheath. The GSE-y component of the\ndensity gradient, $G_y$ shows a negative (positive) enhancement in FDs caused\nby the eastern (western) eruptions, while $G_z$ shows a negative (positive)\nenhancement in FDs by the northern (southern) eruptions. This implies the GCR\ndensity minimum being located behind the central flank of IP-shock and\npropagating radially outward from location of the solar eruption. We also\nconfirmed the average $G_z$ changing its sign above and below the heliospheric\ncurrent sheet, in accord with the prediction of the drift model for the\nlarge-scale GCR transport in the heliosphere.\n", "  Observations have shown that magnetohydrodynamic waves over a large frequency\nrange are ubiquitous in solar prominences. The waves are probably driven by\nphotospheric motions and may transport energy up to prominences suspended in\nthe corona. Dissipation of wave energy can lead to heating of the cool\nprominence plasma, so contributing to the local energy balance within the\nprominence. Here we discuss the role of Alfv\\'en wave dissipation as a heating\nmechanism for the prominence plasma. We consider a slab-like quiescent\nprominence model with a transverse magnetic field embedded in the solar corona.\nThe prominence medium is modelled as a partially ionized plasma composed of a\ncharged ion-electron single fluid and two separate neutral fluids corresponding\nto neutral hydrogen and neutral helium. Friction between the three fluids acts\nas a dissipative mechanism for the waves. The heating caused by\nexternally-driven Alfv\\'en waves incident on the prominence slab is\nanalytically explored. We find that the dense prominence slab acts as a\nresonant cavity for the waves. The fraction of incident wave energy that is\nchannelled into the slab strongly depends upon the wave period, $P$. Using\ntypical prominence conditions, we obtain that wave energy trapping and\nassociated heating are negligible when $P \\gtrsim 100$ s, so that it is\nunlikely that those waves have a relevant influence on prominence energetics.\nWhen $1$ s $\\lesssim P \\lesssim 100$ s the energy absorption into the slab\nshows several sharp and narrow peaks, that can reach up to 100%, when the\nincident wave frequency matches a cavity resonance of the slab. Wave heating is\nenhanced at those resonant frequencies. Conversely, when $P \\lesssim 1$ s\ncavity resonances are absent, but the waves are heavily damped by the strong\ndissipation. We estimate that wave heating may compensate for about 10% of\nradiative losses of the prominence plasma.\n", "  We develop Chiral Perturbation Theory for chirally broken theories with\nfermions in two different representations of the gauge group. Any such theory\nhas a non-anomalous singlet $U(1)_A$ symmetry, yielding an additional\nNambu-Goldstone boson when spontaneously broken. We calculate the\nnext-to-leading order corrections for the pseudoscalar masses and decay\nconstants, which include the singlet Nambu-Goldstone boson, as well as for the\ntwo condensates. The results can be generalized to more than two\nrepresentations.\n", "  This paper includes two main parts. In the first part, we present generalized\ngauge models based on SU(3)_C x SU(4)_L x U(1)_X (3-4-1) gauge group with\narbitrary electric charge of leptons. The mixing matrix of neutral gauge bosons\nis analysed, the eigenmasses and eigenstates are obtained. The anomaly free as\nwell as matching conditions are discussed precisely. In the second part, we\npresent new development of the original 3-4-1 model [1,2]. In difference from\nprevious works, in this paper the neutrinos, with the help of the decuplet H,\nget the Dirac masses at the tree level. The VEV of the Higgs field in the\ndecuplet H acquiring VEV responsible for neutrino Dirac mass leads to mixing in\nseparated pairs of singly charged gauge bosons, namely the SM W boson and K -\nnew gauge boson acting in right-handed lepton sector, and the singly charged\nbileptons X and Y. Due to the mixing, there occurs a right-handed current\ncarried by the SM W bosons. From the expression of the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant, ones get the limit of square sinus of the Weinberg angle: sin^2\n\\theta_W < 0.25 and a constraint on electric charges of extra leptons. In the\nlimit of lepton number conservation, the Higgs sector contains all massless\nGoldstone bosons for massive gauge bosons and the SM-like Higgs. Some\nphenomenology are pointed out.\n", "  The galaxy cluster RXJ1257$+$4738 at $z=0.866$ is one of the highest redshift\nclusters with a richness of multi-wavelength data, and thus a good target to\nstudy the star formation-density relation at early epochs. Using a sample of\nspectroscopically-confirmed cluster members, we derive the star formation rates\nof our galaxies using two methods, (I) the relation between SFR and total\ninfrared luminosity extrapolated from the observed \\textit{Spitzer} MIPS\n24$\\mu$m imaging data, and (II) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting\nusing the MAGPHYS code, including eight different bands.\n  We show that, for this cluster, the SFR-density relation is very weak and\nseems to be dominated by the two central galaxies and the SFR presents a mild\ndependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies having higher SFR.\nHowever, the specific SFR (SSFR) decreases with stellar mass, meaning that more\nmassive galaxies are forming less stars per unit of mass, and thus suggesting\nthat the increase in star-forming members is driven by cluster assembly and\ninfall.\n  If the environment is somehow driving the SF, one would expect a relation\nbetween the SSFR and the cluster centric distance, but that is not the case. A\npossible scenario to explain this lack of correlation is the contamination by\ninfalling galaxies in the inner part of the cluster which may be on their\ninitial pass through the cluster center. As these galaxies have higher SFRs for\ntheir stellar mass, they enhance the mean SSFR in the center of the cluster.\n", "  The combination of configuration interaction and many-body perturbation\ntheory methods (CI+MBPT) is extended to non-perturbatively include\nconfigurations with electron holes below the designated Fermi level, allowing\nus to treat systems where holes play an important role. For example, the method\ncan treat valence-hole systems like Ir$^{17+}$, particle-hole excitations in\nnoble gases, and difficult transitions such as the $6s \\rightarrow 5d^{-1}6s^2$\noptical clock transition in Hg$^+$. We take the latter system as our test case\nfor the method and obtain very good accuracy (~1%) for the low-lying transition\nenergies. The $\\alpha$-dependence of these transitions is calculated and used\nto reinterpret the existing best laboratory limits on the time-dependence of\nthe fine-structure constant.\n", "  A two-dimensional special relativistic radiation-hydrodynamics code is\ndeveloped and applied to numerical simulations of supernova shock breakout in\nbipolar explosions of a blue supergiant. Our calculations successfully simulate\nthe dynamical evolution of a blast wave in the star and its emergence from the\nsurface. Results of the model with spherical energy deposition show a good\nagreement with previous simulations. Furthermore, we calculate several models\nwith bipolar energy deposition and compare their results with the spherically\nsymmetric model. The bolometric light curves of the shock breakout emission are\ncalculated by a ray-tracing method. Our radiation-hydrodynamic models indicate\nthat the early part of the shock breakout emission can be used to probe the\ngeometry of the blast wave produced as a result of the gravitational collapse\nof the iron core.\n", "  The nature of the pairing states of superconducting LaNiC$_2$ and LaNiGa$_2$\nhas to date remained a puzzling question. Broken time reversal symmetry has\nbeen observed in both compounds and a group theoretical analysis implies a\nnon-unitary triplet pairing state. However all the allowed non-unitary triplet\nstates have nodal gap functions but most thermodynamic and NMR measurements\nindicate fully gapped superconductivity in LaNiC$_2$. Here we probe the gap\nsymmetry of LaNiGa$_2$ by measuring the London penetration depth, specific heat\nand upper critical field. These measurements demonstrate two-gap nodeless\nsuperconductivity in LaNiGa$_2$, suggesting that this is a common feature of\nboth compounds. These results allow us to propose a novel triplet\nsuperconducting state, where the pairing occurs between electrons of the same\nspin, but on different orbitals. In this case the superconducting wavefunction\nhas a triplet spin component but isotropic even parity gap symmetry, yet the\noverall wavefunction remains antisymmetric under particle exchange. This model\nleads to a nodeless two-gap superconducting state which breaks time reversal\nsymmetry, and therefore accounts well for the seemingly contradictory\nexperimental results.\n", "  In this paper we calculate properties of the three-dimensional system of N\nspecies of fermions at zero temperature and finite chemical potential, with the\nfour-fermionic interaction of the Thirring type. We observe that this model\nfits consistently into framework of the Landau Fermi liquid theory, and\npossesses a non-trivial zeroth and first Landau parameters. Our result is\nderived to all orders of the Thirring coupling constant and to the leading\norder of the large-N expansion. In particular we solve for the exact\ncurrent-current correlation function, and show that it exhibits a singular\nbehavior at zero frequency and twice of the Fermi momentum.\n", "  The Thomson Problem, arrangement of identical charges on the surface of a\nsphere, has found many applications in physics, chemistry and biology. Here we\nshow that the energy landscape of the Thomson Problem for $N$ particles with\n$N=132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147$ and $150$ is single funnelled, characteristic\nof a structure-seeking organisation where the global minimum is easily\naccessible. Algorithmically constructing starting points close to the global\nminimum of such a potential with spherical constraints is one of Smale's 18\nunsolved problems in mathematics for the 21st century because it is important\nin the solution of univariate and bivariate random polynomial equations. By\nanalysing the kinetic transition networks, we show that a randomly chosen\nminimum is in fact always `close' to the global minimum in terms of the number\nof transition states that separate them, a characteristic of small world\nnetworks.\n", "  We calculate the microlensing event rate and typical time-scales for the\nfree-floating planet (FFP) population that is predicted by the core accretion\ntheory of planet formation. The event rate is found to be ~$1.8\\times 10^{-3}$\nof that for the stellar population. While the stellar microlensing event\ntime-scale peaks at around 20 days, the median time-scale for FFP events (~0.1\nday) is much shorter. Our values for the event rate and the median time-scale\nare significantly smaller than those required to explain the \\cite{Sum+11}\nresult, by factors of ~13 and ~16, respectively. The inclusion of planets at\nwide separations does not change the results significantly. This discrepancy\nmay be too significant for standard versions of both the core accretion theory\nand the gravitational instability model to explain satisfactorily. Therefore,\neither a modification to the planet formation theory is required, or other\nexplanations to the excess of short-time-scale microlensing events are needed.\nOur predictions can be tested by ongoing microlensing experiment such as\nKMTNet, and by future satellite missions such as WFIRST and Euclid.\n", "  An alternative approach to Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) is\nreviewed, which is motivated by a range of serious theoretical issues\ninflicting the theory, such as the cosmological constant problem, presence of\nnon-Machian solutions, problems related with the energy-stress tensor $T^{ik}$\nand unphysical solutions.\n  The new approach emanates from a critical analysis of these problems,\nproviding a novel insight that the matter fields, together with the ensuing\ngravitational field, are already present inherently in the spacetime without\ntaking recourse to $T^{ik}$. Supported by numerous evidences, the new insight\nrevolutionizes our views on the representation of the source of gravitation and\nestablishes the spacetime itself as the source, which becomes crucial for\nunderstanding the unresolved issues in a unified manner. This leads to a new\nparadigm in GR by establishing equation $R^{ik}=0$ as the field equation of\ngravitation plus inertia in the very presence of matter.\n", "  Class I CH$_3$OH masers trace interstellar shocks. They have received little\nattention mostly as a consequence of their low luminosities; this situation has\nchanged recently and Class I masers are now routinely used as signposts of\noutflows. The recent detection of polarisation in Class I lines now makes it\npossible to obtain information on magnetic fields in shocks. We make use of\nnewly calculated collisional rates to investigate the excitation of Class I\nmasers and to reconcile their observed properties with model results. We\nperformed LVG calculations with a plane-parallel slab geometry to compute the\npump and loss rates which regulate the interactions of the different maser\nsystems with the maser reservoir. We study the dependence of the pump rate, the\nloss rate, and the inversion efficiency of the pumping scheme of Class I masers\non the physics of the gas. Bright Class I masers are mainly high-temperature\nhigh-density structures with maser emission measures corresponding to high\nCH$_3$OH abundances close to the limits set by collisional quenching. Our model\nreproduces reasonably well most of the observed properties of Class I masers.\nThe 25 GHz masers are the most sensitive to the density and mase at higher\ndensities than other lines. Moreover, even at high density and high abundance,\ntheir luminosity is lower than that of the 44 GHz and 36 GHz lines. By\ncomparison between observed isotropic photon luminosities and our model, we\ninfer beam solid angles of ~0.001 steradian. Class I masers can be separated\ninto 3 families: the $(J+1)_{-1}-J_{0}$-E type, the $(J+1)_0-J_1$-A type, and\nthe $J_2-J_1$-E lines. The 25 GHz lines behave in a different fashion from the\nother masers as they are only inverted at densities above $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ in\ncontrast to other Class I masers. Therefore, the detection of maser activity in\nall 3 families is a clear indication of high densities.\n", "  Based on the exact relationship to random matrix theory, we present an\nalternative method of evaluating the probability distribution of the k-th\nsmallest Dirac eigenvalue in the epsilon-regime of QCD and QCD-like theories.\nBy utilizing the Nystrom-type discretization of Fredholm determinants and\nPfaffians, practical trouble of evaluating multiple integrations is\ncircumvented and technical restrictions on the parities of the number of\nflavors and of the topological charge present in our previous treatment for\nbeta=1 and 4 cases [Phys. Rev. D 63, 045012 (2001)] are partly lifted. This\nmethod is also applied to the distributions of spacings between k-th\nnearest-neighboring levels in the mobility edges of Anderson Hamiltonian and\nDirac operator in high-temperature QCD.\n", "  We investigate the stability of self-propelled particle flocks in the\nTaylor-Green vortex, a steady vortical flow. We consider a model where\nparticles align themselves to a combination of the orientation and the\nacceleration of particles within a critical radius. We identify two distinct\nregimes, if alignment with orientation is dominant the particles tend to be\nexpelled from regions of high vorticity. In contrast if anticipation is\ndominant the particles accumulate in areas of large vorticity. In both regimes\nthe relative order of the flock is reduced. However we show that there can be a\ncritical balance of the two effects which stabilises the flock in the presence\nof external fluid forcing. This strategy could provide a mechanism for animal\nflocks to remain globally ordered in the presence of fluid forcing, and may\nalso have applications in the design of flocking autonomous drones and\nartificial microswimmers.\n", "  Convective core overshooting extends the main-sequence lifetime of a star.\nEvolutionary tracks computed with overshooting are quite different from those\nthat use the classical Schwarzschild criterion, which leads to rather different\npredictions for the stellar properties. Attempts over the last two decades to\ncalibrate the degree of overshooting with stellar mass using detached\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries have been largely inconclusive, mainly due to a\nlack of suitable observational data. Here we revisit the question of a possible\nmass dependence of overshooting with a more complete sample of binaries, and\nexamine any additional relation there might be with evolutionary state or metal\nabundance Z. We use a carefully selected sample of 33 double-lined eclipsing\nbinaries strategically positioned in the H-R diagram, with accurate absolute\ndimensions and component masses ranging from 1.2 to 4.4 solar masses. We\ncompare their measured properties with stellar evolution calculations to infer\nsemi-empirical values of the overshooting parameter alpha(ov) for each star.\nOur models use the common prescription for the overshoot distance d(ov) =\nalpha(ov) Hp, where Hp is the pressure scale height at the edge of the\nconvective core as given by the Schwarzschild criterion, and alpha(ov) is a\nfree parameter. We find a relation between alpha(ov) and mass that is defined\nmuch more clearly than in previous work, and indicates a significant rise up to\nabout 2 solar masses followed by little or no change beyond this mass. No\nappreciable dependence is seen with evolutionary state at a given mass, or with\nmetallicity at a given mass despite the fact that the stars in our sample span\na range of a factor of ten in [Fe/H], from -1.01 to +0.01.\n", "  We report transport measurements in a single edge channel of an InAs/GaSb\nquantum spin Hall insulator, where the conduction occurs through only one pair\nof counterpropagating edge modes. By using a specific sample design involving\nhighly asymmetric current paths, we electrically isolate a single edge channel\nof the two-dimensional topological insulator from the other edge. This enables\nus to probe a single edge by multiterminal measurements. Both two-terminal and\nfour-terminal resistances show a nearly quantized plateau around $h/e^2$ for a\n4-$\\mu$m-long edge, indicating quasiballistic transport. Our approach is\nadvantageous in that it allows us to gain insight into a microscopic region\nfrom local measurements.\n", "  We obtain analytic expressions for the conductivity of pristine (pure)\ngraphene in the framework of the Dirac model using the polarization tensor in\n(2+1)-dimensions defined along the real frequency axis. It is found that at\nboth zero and nonzero temperature $T$ the in-plane and out-of-plane\nconductivities of graphene are equal to each other with a high precision and\nessentially do not depend on the wave vector. At $T=0$ the conductivity of\ngraphene is real and equal to $\\sigma_0=e^2/(4\\hbar)$ up to small nonlocal\ncorrections in accordance with many authors. At some fixed $T\\neq 0$ the real\npart of the conductivity varies between zero at low frequencies $\\omega$ and\n$\\sigma_0$ for optical $\\omega$. If $\\omega$ is fixed, the conductivity varies\nbetween $\\sigma_0$ at low $T$ and zero at high $T$. The imaginary part of the\nconductivity of graphene is shown to depend on the ratio of $\\omega$ to $T$. In\naccordance to the obtained asymptotic expressions, at fixed $T$ it varies from\ninfinity at $\\omega=0$ to a negative minimum value reached at some $\\omega$,\nand then approaches to zero with further increase of $\\omega$. At fixed\n$\\omega$ the imaginary part of the conductivity varies from zero at $T=0$,\nreaches a negative minimum at some $T$ and then goes to infinity together with\n$T$. The numerical computations of both the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity are performed. The above results are obtained in the framework of\nquantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature and can be generalized for\ngraphene samples with nonzero mass gap parameter and chemical potential.\n", "  Majorana bound states (MBSs) nested in a topological nanowire are predicted\nto manifest nonlocal correlations in the presence of a finite energy splitting\nbetween the MBSs. However, the signal of the nonlocal correlations has not yet\nbeen detected in experiments. A possible reason is that the energy splitting is\ntoo weak and seriously affected by many system parameters. Here we investigate\nthe charging energy induced nonlocal correlations in a hybrid device of MBSs\nand quantum dots. The nanowire that hosts the MBSs is assumed in proximity to a\nmesoscopic superconducting island with a finite charging energy. Each end of\nthe nanowire is coupled to one lead via a quantum dot with resonant levels.\nWith a floating superconducting island, the devices shows a negative\ndifferential conductance and giant super-Poissonian shot noise, due to the\ninterplay between the nonlocality of the MBSs and dynamical Coulomb blockade\neffect. When the island is strongly coupled to a bulk superconductor, the\ncurrent cross correlations at small lead chemical potentials are negative by\ntuning the dot energy levels. In contrast, the cross correlation is always\npositive in a non-Majorana setup. This difference may provide a signature for\nthe existence of the MBSs.\n", "  We present a simple numerical scheme for perturbation theory (PT)\ncalculations of large-scale structure. Solving the evolution equations for\nperturbations numerically, we construct the PT kernels as building blocks of\nstatistical calculations, from which the power spectrum and/or correlation\nfunction can be systematically computed. The scheme is especially applicable to\nthe generalized structure formation including modified gravity, in which the\nanalytic construction of PT kernels is intractable. As an illustration, we show\nseveral examples for power spectrum calculations in $f(R)$ gravity and\n$\\Lambda$CDM models.\n", "  The Multipurpose Detector (MPD) \\cite{cite1.MPD_CDR} is designed to study of\nhot and dense baryonic matter in collisions of heavy ions over the atomic mass\nrange 1--197 at the centre of mass energy up to $\\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ = 11 GeV (for\nAu79+). The MPD experiment will be carried out at the JINR accelerator complex\nNICA \\cite{cite2.NICA_CDR} which is under construction. The barrel part of the\nMPD consists of various detectors surrounding the interaction point. It\nincludes a precise tracking system (time projection chamber (TPC) and silicon\ninner tracker (IT)) and high-performance particle identification system based\non time-of-flight (TOF) and calorimeter (ECal). The triple-stack multigap\nresistive plate chamber is chosen as an active element of the TOF. It provides\ngood time resolution and long term stability.\n  This article presents parameters of the MRPC obtained using the deuteron beam\nof JINR accelerator Nuclotron. The time resolution is $\\sim$40 ps with\nefficiency of 99\\%. Rate capability studies resulted with a time resolution of\n60 ps and efficiency higher than 90\\% on the beam with particle flux densities\nup to 2 kHz/cm$^2$.\n", "  Gravitational wave searches for continuous-wave signals from neutron stars\nare especially challenging when the star's spin frequency is unknown a priori\nfrom electromagnetic observations and wanders stochastically under the action\nof internal (e.g. superfluid or magnetospheric) or external (e.g. accretion)\ntorques. It is shown that frequency tracking by hidden Markov model (HMM)\nmethods can be combined with existing maximum likelihood coherent matched\nfilters like the F-statistic to surmount some of the challenges raised by spin\nwandering. Specifically it is found that, for an isolated, biaxial rotor whose\nspin frequency walks randomly, HMM tracking of the F-statistic output from\ncoherent segments with duration T_drift = 10d over a total observation time of\nT_obs = 1yr can detect signals with wave strains h0 > 2e-26 at a noise level\ncharacteristic of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave\nObservatory (Advanced LIGO). For a biaxial rotor with randomly walking spin in\na binary orbit, whose orbital period and semi-major axis are known\napproximately from electromagnetic observations, HMM tracking of the\nBessel-weighted F-statistic output can detect signals with h0 > 8e-26. An\nefficient, recursive, HMM solver based on the Viterbi algorithm is\ndemonstrated, which requires ~10^3 CPU-hours for a typical, broadband (0.5-kHz)\nsearch for the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, including generation of the\nrelevant F-statistic input. In a \"realistic\" observational scenario, Viterbi\ntracking successfully detects 41 out of 50 synthetic signals without spin\nwandering in Stage I of the Scorpius X-1 Mock Data Challenge convened by the\nLIGO Scientific Collaboration down to a wave strain of h0 = 1.1e-25, recovering\nthe frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of <= 4.3e-3 Hz.\n", "  We report the relationship between epitaxial strain and the crystallographic\norientation of the in-phase rotation axis and A-site displacements in Pbnm-type\nperovskite films. Synchrotron diffraction measurements of EuFeO3 films under\nstrain states ranging from 2% compressive to 0.9% tensile on cubic or\nrhombohedral substrates exhibit a combination of a-a+c- and a+a-c- rotational\npatterns. We compare the EuFeO3 behavior with previously reported experimental\nand theoretical work on strained Pbnm-type films on non-orthorhombic\nsubstrates, as well as additional measurements from LaGaO3, LaFeO3, and\nEu0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films on SrTiO3. Compiling the results from various material\nsystems reveals a general strain dependence in which compressive strain\nstrongly favors a-a+c- and a+a-c- rotation patterns and tensile strain weakly\nfavors a-a-c+ structures. In contrast, EuFeO3 films grown on Pbnm-type GdScO3\nunder 2.3% tensile strain take on a uniform a-a+c- rotation pattern imprinted\nfrom the substrate, despite strain energy considerations that favor the a-a-c+\npattern. These results point to the use of substrate imprinting as a more\nrobust route than strain for tuning the crystallographic orientations of the\noctahedral rotations and A-site displacements needed to realize\nrotation-induced hybrid improper ferroelectricity in oxide heterostructures.\n", "  Observations of afterglows of gamma-ray bursts suggest (GRBs) that post-shock\nmagnetic fields are strongly amplified to about 100 times the shock-compressed\nvalue. The Weibel instability appears to play an important role in generating\nof the magnetic field. However, recent simulations of collisionless shocks in\nhomogeneous plasmas show that the magnetic field generated by the Weibel\ninstability rapidly decays. There must be some density fluctuations in\ninterstellar and circumstellar media. The density fluctuations are\nanisotropically compressed in the downstream region of relativistic shocks. In\nthis paper, we study the Weibel instability in electron--positron plasmas with\nthe spatially anisotropic density distributions by means of two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations. We find that large magnetic fields are maintained\nfor a longer time by the Weibel instability driven by the spatially anisotropic\ndensity structure. Particles anisotropically escape from the high density\nregion, so that the temperature anisotropy is generated and the Weibel\ninstability becomes unstable. Our simulation results suggest that the Weibel\ninstability driven by an anisotropic density structure can generate\nsufficiently large magnetic fields and they can cover sufficiently large\nregions to explain the afterglow emission of GRBs.\n", "  Data from the Herschel Space Observatory is freely available to the public\nbut no uniformly processed catalogue of the observations has been published so\nfar. To date, the Herschel Science Archive does not contain the exact sky\ncoverage (footprint) of individual observations and supports search for\nmeasurements based on bounding circles only. Drawing on previous experience in\nimplementing footprint databases, we built the Herschel Footprint Database and\nWeb Services for the Herschel Space Observatory to provide efficient search\ncapabilities for typical astronomical queries. The database was designed with\nthe following main goals in mind: (a) provide a unified data model for\nmeta-data of all instruments and observational modes, (b) quickly find\nobservations covering a selected object and its neighbourhood, (c) quickly find\nevery observation in a larger area of the sky, (d) allow for finding solar\nsystem objects crossing observation fields. As a first step, we developed a\nunified data model of observations of all three Herschel instruments for all\npointing and instrument modes. Then, using telescope pointing information and\nobservational meta-data, we compiled a database of footprints. As opposed to\nmethods using pixellation of the sphere, we represent sky coverage in an exact\ngeometric form allowing for precise area calculations. For easier handling of\nHerschel observation footprints with rather complex shapes, two algorithms were\nimplemented to reduce the outline. Furthermore, a new visualisation tool to\nplot footprints with various spherical projections was developed. Indexing of\nthe footprints using Hierarchical Triangular Mesh makes it possible to quickly\nfind observations based on sky coverage, time and meta-data. The database is\naccessible via a web site (http://herschel.vo.elte.hu) and also as a set of\nREST web service functions.\n", "  We present measurements of the electron-temperature based oxygen abundance\nfor a highly star-forming galaxy at z=3.08, COSMOS-1908. This is the highest\nredshift at which [OIII]$\\lambda$4363 has been detected, and the first time\nthat this line has been measured at z>2. We estimate an oxygen abundance of\n12+log(O/H)$=8.00^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. This galaxy is a low-mass ($10^{9.3}$\nM$_{\\odot}$), highly star-forming ($\\sim50$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) system that\nhosts a young stellar population ($\\sim160$ Myr). We investigate the physical\nconditions of the ionized gas in COSMOS-1908 and find that this galaxy has a\nhigh ionization parameter, little nebular reddening ($E(B-V)_{\\rm gas}<0.14$),\nand a high electron density ($n_e\\sim500$ cm$^{-3}$). We compare the ratios of\nstrong oxygen, neon, and hydrogen lines to the direct-method oxygen abundance\nfor COSMOS-1908 and additional star-forming galaxies at z=0-1.8 with\n[OIII]$\\lambda$4363 measurements, and show that galaxies at z$\\sim$1-3 follow\nthe same strong-line correlations as galaxies in the local universe. This\nagreement suggests that the relationship between ionization parameter and O/H\nis similar for z$\\sim$0 and high-redshift galaxies. These results imply that\nmetallicity calibrations based on lines of oxygen, neon, and hydrogen do not\nstrongly evolve with redshift and can reliably estimate abundances out to\nz$\\sim$3, paving the way for robust measurements of the evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation to high redshift.\n", "  In semiconductors almost all heat is conducted by phonons (lattice\nvibrations), which is limited by their quasi-particle lifetimes. Phonon-phonon\ninteractions represent scattering mechanisms that produce thermal resistance.\nIn thermoelectric materials, this resistance due to anharmonicity should be\nmaximised for optimal performance. We use a first-principles lattice-dynamics\napproach to explore the changes in lattice dynamics across an isostructural\nseries where the average atomic mass is conserved: ZnS to CuGaS$_2$ to\nCu$_2$ZnGeS$_4$. Our results demonstrate an enhancement of phonon interactions\nin the multernary materials, and confirm that lattice thermal conductivity can\nbe controlled independently of the average mass and local coordination\nenvironments.\n", "  This project is a massive near-infrared (NIR) search for variable stars in\nhighly reddened and obscured open cluster (OC) fields projected on regions of\nthe Galactic bulge and disk. The search is performed using photometric NIR data\nin the $J$-, $H$- and $K_s$- bands obtained from the Vista Variables in the\nV\\'ia L\\'actea (VVV) Survey. We performed in each cluster field a variability\nsearch using Stetson's variability statistics to select the variable\ncandidates. Later, those candidates were subjected to a frequency analysis\nusing the Generalized Lomb-Scargle and the Phase Dispersion Minimization\nalgorithms. The number of independent observations range between 63 and 73. The\nnewly discovered variables in this study, 157 in total in three different known\nOCs, are classified based on their light curve shapes, periods, amplitudes and\ntheir location in the corresponding color-magnitude $(J-K_s,K_s)$ and\ncolor-color $(H-K_s,J-H)$ diagrams. We found 5 possible Cepheid stars which,\nbased on the period-luminosity relation, are very likely type II Cepheids\nlocated behind the bulge. Among the newly discovered variables, there are\neclipsing binaries, $\\delta$ Scuti, as well as background RR Lyrae stars. Using\nthe new version of the Wilson & Devinney code as well as the \"Physics Of\nEclipsing Binaries\" (PHOEBE) code, we analyzed some of the best eclipsing\nbinaries we discovered. Our results show that these studied systems turn out to\nbe ranging from detached to double-contact binaries, with low eccentricities\nand high inclinations of approximately $80^{\\circ}$. Their surface temperatures\nrange between $3500$K and $8000$K.\n", "  Since 2008 we used high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained\nwith different telescopes to detect signatures of massive planets around\nmain-sequence and evolved stars of the open cluster (OC) M67. We aimed to\nperform a long-term study on giant planet formation in open clusters and\ndetermine how this formation depends on stellar mass and chemical composition.\nA new hot Jupiter (HJ) around the main-sequence star YBP401 is reported in this\nwork. An update of the RV measurements for the two HJ host-stars YBP1194 and\nYBP1514 is also discussed. Our sample of 66 main-sequence and turnoff stars\nincludes 3 HJs, which indicates a high rate of HJs in this cluster (~5.6% for\nsingle stars and ~4.5% for the full sample ). This rate is much higher than\nwhat has been discovered in the field, either with RV surveys or by transits.\nHigh metallicity is not a cause for the excess of HJs in M67, nor can the\nexcess be attributed to high stellar masses. When combining this rate with the\nnon-zero eccentricity of the orbits, our results are qualitatively consistent\nwith a HJ formation scenario dominated by strong encounters with other stars or\nbinary companions and subsequent planet-planet scattering, as predicted by\nN-body simulations.\n", "  Presolar grains constitute remnants of stars that existed before the\nformation of the solar system. In addition to providing direct information on\nthe materials from which the solar system formed, these grains provide\nground-truth information for models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.\nHere we report the in-situ identification of two unique presolar graphite\ngrains from the primitive meteorite LaPaz Icefield 031117. Based on these two\ngraphite grains, we estimate a bulk presolar graphite abundance of 5(-3)(+7)\nppm in this meteorite. One of the grains (LAP-141) is characterized by an\nenrichment in 12C and depletions in 33,34S, and contains a small iron sulfide\nsubgrain, representing the first unambiguous identification of presolar iron\nsulfide. The other grain (LAP-149) is extremely 13C-rich and 15N-poor, with one\nof the lowest 12C/13C ratios observed among presolar grains. Comparison of its\nisotopic compositions with new stellar nucleosynthesis and dust condensation\nmodels indicates an origin in the ejecta of a low-mass CO nova. Grain LAP-149\nis the first putative nova grain that quantitatively best matches nova model\npredictions, providing the first strong evidence for graphite condensation in\nnova ejecta. Our discovery confirms that CO nova graphite and presolar iron\nsulfide contributed to the original building blocks of the solar system.\n", "  Network couplings of oscillatory large-scale systems, such as the brain, have\na space-time structure composed of connection strengths and signal transmission\ndelays. We provide a theoretical framework, which allows treating the spatial\ndistribution of time delays with regard to synchronization, by decomposing it\ninto patterns and therefore reducing the stability analysis into the tractable\nproblem of a finite set of delay-coupled differential equations. We analyse\ndelay-structured networks of phase oscillators and we find that, depending on\nthe heterogeneity of the delays, the oscillators group in phase-shifted,\nanti-phase, steady, and non-stationary clusters, and analytically compute their\nstability boundaries. These results find direct application in the study of\nbrain oscillations.\n", "  The search for small planets orbiting late M dwarfs holds the promise of\ndetecting Earth-size planets for which their atmospheres could be characterised\nwithin the next decade. The recent discovery of TRAPPIST-1 entertains hope that\nthese systems are common around hosts located at the bottom of the main\nsequence. In this Letter, we investigate the ability of the repurposed Kepler\nmission (K2) to probe planetary systems similar to TRAPPIST-1. We perform a\nconsistent data analysis of 189 spectroscopically confirmed M5.5 to M9 late M\ndwarfs from campaigns 1-6 to search for planet candidates and inject transit\nsignals with properties matching TRAPPIST-1b and c. We find no transiting\nplanet candidates across our K2 sample. Our injection tests show that K2 is\nable to recover both TRAPPIST-1 planets for 10% of the sample only, mainly\nbecause of the inefficient throughput at red wavelengths resulting in\nPoisson-limited performance for these targets. Increasing injected planetary\nradii to match GJ1214b's size yields a recovery rate of 70%. The strength of K2\nis its ability to probe a large number of cool hosts across the different\ncampaigns, out of which the recovery rate of 10% may turn into bona-fide\ndetections of TRAPPIST-1 like systems within the next two years.\n", "  We present here results from observations at 5.5 and 9 GHz of the Bullet\ncluster 1E 0657-55.8 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our\nresults show detection of diffuse emission in the cluster. Our findings are\nconsistent with the previous observations by Shimwell et al. (2014) and\nShimwell et al. (2015) at 1.1-3.1 GHz. Morphology of diffuse structures (relic\nregions A and B and the radio halo) are consistent with those reported by the\nprevious study. Our results indicate steepening in the spectral index at higher\nfrequencies (at and greater than 5.0 GHz) for region A. The spectrum can be fit\nwell by a broken power law. We discuss the possibility of a few recent\ntheoretical models explaining this break in the power law spectrum, and find\nthat a modified Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) model or a turbulent\nreacceleration model may be relevant. Deep radio observations at high\nfrequencies (at and greater than 5 GHz) are required for a detailed comparison\nwith this model.\n", "  The present study aims to characterise the physical and chemical properties\nof the protostellar core Orion B9-SMM3. The APEX telescope was used to perform\na follow-up molecular line survey of SMM3. The following species were\nidentified from the frequency range 218.2-222.2 GHz: $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO,\npara-H$_2$CO, and E$_1$-type CH$_3$OH. The on-the-fly mapping observations at\n215.1-219.1 GHz revealed that SMM3 is associated with a dense gas core as\ntraced by DCO$^+$ and p-H$_2$CO. Altogether three different p-H$_2$CO\ntransitions were detected with clearly broadened linewidths (8.2-11 km s$^{-1}$\nin FWHM). The derived p-H$_2$CO rotational temperature, $64\\pm15$ K, indicates\nthe presence of warm gas. We also detected a narrow p-H$_2$CO line (FWHM=0.42\nkm s$^{-1}$) at the systemic velocity. The p-H$_2$CO abundance for the broad\ncomponent appears to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude with respect to the\nnarrow line value ($\\sim3\\times10^{-9}$ versus $\\sim2\\times10^{-11}$). The\ndetected methanol line shows a linewidth similar to those of the broad\np-H$_2$CO lines, which indicates their coexistence. The CO isotopologue data\nsuggest that the CO depletion factor decreases from $\\sim27\\pm2$ towards the\ncore centre to a value of $\\sim8\\pm1$ towards the core edge. In the latter\nposition, the N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio is revised down to $0.14\\pm0.06$. The\norigin of the subfragments inside the SMM3 core we found previously can be\nunderstood in terms of the Jeans instability if non-thermal motions are taken\ninto account. The estimated fragmentation timescale, and the derived chemical\nabundances suggest that SMM3 is a few times $10^5$ yr old, in good agreement\nwith its Class 0 classification inferred from the spectral energy distribution\nanalysis. The broad p-H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH lines, and the associated warm gas\nprovide the first clear evidence of a molecular outflow driven by SMM3.\n", "  We present a real-time and fully integrated quantum random number generator\n(QRNG) by measuring laser phase fluctuations. The QRNG scheme based on laser\nphase fluctuations is featured for its capability of generating ultra\nhigh-speed random numbers. However, the speed bottleneck of a practical QRNG\nlies on the limited speed of randomness extraction. To close the gap between\nthe fast randomness generation and the slow post-processing, we propose a\npipeline extraction algorithm based on Toeplitz matrix hashing and implement it\nin a high-speed field-programmable gate array. Further, all the QRNG components\nare integrated into a module, including a compact and actively stabilized\ninterferometer, high-speed data acquisition, and real-time data post-processing\nand transmission. The final generation rate of the QRNG module with real-time\nextraction can reach 3.2 Gbps.\n", "  In the development of equations of state for polyatomic molecules,\nthermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT) is widely used to calculate the change\nin free energy due to chain formation. TPT is a simplification of a more\ngeneral and exact multi-density cluster expansion for associating fluids. In\nTPT all contributions to the cluster expansion which contain chain - chain\ninteractions are neglected. That is, all inter-chain interactions are treated\nat the reference fluid level. This allows for the summation of the cluster\ntheory in terms of reference system correlation functions only. While highly\nsuccessful, TPT has many handicaps which result from the neglect of chain -\nchain interactions. The subject of this document is to move beyond the\nlimitations of TPT, and included chain - chain contributions to the equation of\nstate.\n", "  We study a XXZ spin-chain in a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) phase\nwith time dependent anisotropy of spin exchange interactions. To begin we focus\non a linear ramp of $J_z$, starting at XX point and slowly increasing towards\nthe anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg point. Although the problem of a linear ramp\nin the TLL has been recently under intense scrutiny in a perturbative\n\\emph{g-ology} framework, an aspect that has been overlooked so far is the role\nof the Galilean invariance breaking. We find that, although the differential\nequation that needs to be solved to find time evolution of the system is\nsubstantially more complicated, in some cases exact analytic solutions can be\ngiven. We obtain them for the linear ramp in the limit of small $J_z$ as well\nas $J_z\\rightarrow 1$, and for such protocols that are tailored to keep the\nGalilean invariance breaking term constant for every $J_z$. We point out the\nfeatures of dynamics during the quench that stays unaltered, and those that\nneed to be taken with care when Galilean invariance breaking is present. We are\nable to deduce that it is the shape of the propagating front that is affected\nin the most pronounced way.\n", "  The light variations of first-overtone RR Lyrae stars and contact eclipsing\nbinaries can be difficult to distinguish. The Catalina Periodic Variable Star\ncatalog contains several misclassified objects, despite the classification\nefforts by Drake et al. (2014). They used metallicity and surface gravity\nderived from spectroscopic data (from the SDSS database) to rule out binaries.\nOur aim is to further constrain the catalog using SDSS colours to estimate\nphysical parameters for stars that did not have spectroscopic data.\n", "  We investigate one-way quantum deficit for $2\\otimes d$ systems. Analytical\nexpressions of one-way quantum deficit under both von Neumann measurement and\nweak measurement are presented. As an illustration, qubit-qutrit systems are\nstudied in detail. It is shown that there exists non-zero one-way quantum\ndeficit even quantum entanglement vanishes. Moreover, one-way quantum deficit\nvia weak measurement turns out to be weaker than that via von Neumann\nmeasurement. The dynamics of entanglement and one-way quantum deficit under\ndephasing channels is also investigated.\n", "  This article presents the main topics related to one-quadrant power\nconverters. The basic topologies are analysed and a simple methodology to\nobtain the steady-state output-input voltage ratio is set out. A short\ndiscussion of different methods to control one-quadrant power converters is\npresented. Some of the reported derived topologies of one-quadrant power\nconverters are also considered. Some topics related to one-quadrant power\nconverters such as synchronous rectification, hard and soft commutation, and\ninterleaved converters are discussed. Finally, a brief introduction to resonant\nconverters is given.\n", "  At interfaces between complex oxides it is possible to generate electronic\nsystems with unusual electronic properties, which are not present in the\nisolated oxides. One important example is the appearance of superconductivity\nat the interface between insulating oxides, although, until now, with very low\nTc. We report the occurrence of high Tc superconductivity in the bilayer\nCaCuO2/SrTiO3, where both the constituent oxides are insulating. In order to\nobtain a superconducting state, the CaCuO2/SrTiO3 interface must be realized\nbetween the Ca plane of CaCuO2 and the TiO2 plane of SrTiO3. Only in this case\nextra oxygen ions can be incorporated in the interface Ca plane, acting as\napical oxygen for Cu and providing holes to the CuO2 planes. A detailed hole\ndoping spatial profile has been obtained by STEM/EELS at the O K-edge, clearly\nshowing that the (super)conductivity is confined to about 1-2 CaCuO2 unit cells\nclose to the interface with SrTiO3. The results obtained for the CaCuO2/SrTiO3\ninterface can be extended to multilayered high Tc cuprates, contributing to\nexplain the dependence of Tc on the number of CuO2 planes in these systems.\n", "  We present a general method to identify infalling substructure in discrete\ndatasets with position and line-of-sight velocity data. We exploit the fact\nthat galaxies falling onto a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in a virialised\ncluster, or dwarf satellites falling onto a central galaxy like the Milky Way,\nfollow nearly radial orbits. If the orbits are exactly radial, we show how to\nfind the probability distribution for a satellite's energy, given a tracer\ndensity for the satellite population, by solving an Abel integral equation.\nThis is an extension of Eddington (1916)'s classical formula for the isotropic\ndistribution function. When applied to a system of galaxies, clustering in\nenergy space can then be quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and\ngroups of objects can be identified which, though separated in the sky, may be\nfalling in on the same orbit. This method is tested using mock data and applied\nto the satellite galaxy population around M87, the BCG in Virgo, and a number\nof associations are found which may represent infalling galaxy groups.\n", "  We study an SIS epidemic process over a static contact network where the\nnodes have partial information about the epidemic state. They react by limiting\ntheir interactions with their neighbors when they believe the epidemic is\ncurrently prevalent. A node's awareness is weighted by the fraction of infected\nneighbors in their social network, and a global broadcast of the fraction of\ninfected nodes in the entire network. The dynamics of the benchmark (no\nawareness) and awareness models are described by discrete-time Markov chains,\nfrom which mean-field approximations (MFA) are derived. The states of the MFA\nare interpreted as the nodes' probabilities of being infected. We show a\nsufficient condition for existence of a \"metastable\", or endemic, state of the\nawareness model coincides with that of the benchmark model. Furthermore, we use\na coupling technique to give a full stochastic comparison analysis between the\ntwo chains, which serves as a probabilistic analogue to the MFA analysis. In\nparticular, we show that adding awareness reduces the expectation of any\nepidemic metric on the space of sample paths, e.g. eradication time or total\ninfections. We characterize the reduction in expectations in terms of the\ncoupling distribution. In simulations, we evaluate the effect social distancing\nhas on contact networks from different random graph families (geometric,\nErd\\H{o}s-Renyi, and scale-free random networks).\n", "  Growth models have been proposed for constructing the scale-free overlay\ntopology to improve the performance of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P)\nnetworks. However, previous growth models are able to maintain the limited\nscale-free topology when nodes only join but do not leave the network; the case\nof nodes leaving the network while preserving a precise scaling parameter is\nnot included in the solution. Thus, the full dynamic of node participation,\ninherent in P2P networks, is not considered in these models. In order to handle\nboth nodes joining and leaving the network, we propose a robust growth model\nE-SRA, which is capable of producing the perfect limited scale-free overlay\ntopology with user-defined scaling parameter and hard cut-offs. Scalability of\nour approach is ensured since no global information is required to add or\nremove a node. E-SRA is also tolerant to individual node failure caused by\nerrors or attacks. Simulations have shown that E-SRA outperforms other growth\nmodels by producing topologies with high adherence to the desired scale-free\nproperty. Search algorithms, including flooding and normalized flooding,\nachieve higher efficiency over the topologies produced by E-SRA.\n", "  The effect of local environment on the formation of magnetic moments on Fe\natoms in iron silicides are studied by combination of ab initio and model\ncalculations. The suggested model includes all Fe d- and Si p-orbitals,\nintra-atomic Coulomb interactions, inter-atomic Fe-Fe exchange and hopping of\nelectrons to nearest and next nearest neighboring atoms and takes into account\nall symmetries within the Slater-Koster scheme. The parameters of the model are\nfound from the requirement that self-consistent moments on atoms and density of\nstates found from ab initio and model calculations within the Hartree-Fock\napproximation are close to each other as much as possible. Contrary to the\ncommonly accepted statement that an increase of the Si concentration within\nnearest environment of Fe atoms in the ordered Fe3Si and FexSi1-x alloys leads\nto a decrease of Fe magnetic moment we find that a crucial role in the\nformation of magnetic moments is played by second coordination sphere of Fe\natoms. Particularly, the Fe atoms have higher magnetic moments in amorphous\nfilms compared to the epitaxial ones due to decrease in the number of\niron-atoms in the next nearest environment. Both our model and ab initio\ncalculations confirm existence of known spin crossover with pressure and\npredict second crossover at higher pressure\n", "  The development of high-efficiency porous catalyst membranes critically\ndepends on our understanding of where the majority of the chemical conversions\noccur within the porous structure. This requires mapping of chemical reactions\nand mass transport inside the complex nano-scale architecture of porous\ncatalyst membranes which is a multiscale problem in both the temporal and\nspatial domain. To address this problem, we developed a multi-scale mass\ntransport computational framework based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)\nthat allows us to account for catalytic reactions at the gas-solid interface by\nintroducing a new boundary condition. In good agreement with experiments, the\nsimulations reveal that most catalytic reactions occur near the gas-flow facing\nside of the catalyst membrane if chemical reactions are fast compared to mass\ntransport within the porous catalyst membrane.\n", "  In plasma turbulence theory, due to the complexity of the system with many\nnon-linearly interacting waves, the dynamics of the phases is often disregarded\nand the so-called random-phase approximation (RPA) is used assuming the\nexistence of a Chirikov-like criterion for the onset of wave stochasticity. The\ndynamical amplitudes are represented as complex numbers, $\\psi = \\psi_r +\ni\\psi_i = ae^{i\\theta}$, with the amplitudes slowly varying whereas the phases\nare rapidly varying and, in particular, distributed uniformly over the interval\n$[0;2\\pi)$. However, one could expect that the phase dynamics can play a role\nin the self-organisation and the formation of coherent structures. In the same\nmanner it is also expected that the RPA falls short to take coherent\ninteraction between phases into account. In this work therefore, we studied the\nrole of phase dynamics and the coupling of phases between different modes on\nthe characteristic time evolution of the turbulent. We assume a simple\nturbulent system where the so-called stochastic oscillator model can be\nemployed. The idea of interpreting turbulence by stochastic oscillators. The\nstochastic oscillator models can be derived from radical simplifications of the\nnonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes or Gyro-Kinetic equations. In this\nparticular case we adopt the basic equation for the stochastic oscillator model\nwith passive advection and random forcing from Ref.\n", "  We investigate fundamental connections between thermodynamics and quantum\ninformation theory. First, we show that the operational framework of thermal\noperations is nonequivalent to the framework of Gibbs-preserving maps, and we\ncomment on this gap. We then introduce a fully information-theoretic framework\ngeneralizing the above by making further abstraction of physical quantities\nsuch as energy. It is technically convenient to work with and reproduces known\nresults for finite-size quantum thermodynamics. With our framework we may\ndetermine the minimal work cost of implementing any logical process. In the\ncase of information processing on memory registers with a degenerate\nHamiltonian, the answer is given by the max-entropy, a measure of information\nknown from quantum information theory. In the general case, we obtain a new\ninformation measure, the \"coherent relative entropy\", which generalizes both\nthe conditional entropy and the relative entropy. It satisfies a collection of\nproperties which justifies its interpretation as an entropy measure and which\nconnects it to known quantities. We then present how, from our framework,\nmacroscopic thermodynamics emerges by typicality, after singling out an\nappropriate class of thermodynamic states possessing some suitable\nreversibility property. A natural thermodynamic potential emerges, dictating\npossible state transformations, and whose differential describes the physics of\nthe system. The textbook thermodynamics of a gas is recovered as well as the\nform of the second law relating thermodynamic entropy and heat exchange.\nFinally, noting that quantum states are relative to the observer, we see that\nthe procedure above gives rise to a natural form of coarse-graining in quantum\nmechanics: Each observer can consistently apply the formalism of quantum\ninformation according to their own fundamental unit of information.\n", "  This paper introduces a Quantum Correlation Matrix Memory (QCMM) and Enhanced\nQCMM (EQCMM), which are useful to work with quantum memories. A version of\nclassical Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process in Dirac notation (called\nQuantum Orthogonalisation Process: QOP) is presented to convert a\nnon-orthonormal quantum basis, i.e., a set of non-orthonormal quantum vectors\n(called qudits) to an orthonormal quantum basis, i.e., a set of orthonormal\nquantum qudits. This work shows that it is possible to improve the performance\nof QCMM thanks QOP algorithm. Besides, the EQCMM algorithm has a lot of\nadditional fields of applica-tions, e.g.: Steganography, as a replacement\nHopfield Net-works, Bi-level image processing, etc. Finally, it is important to\nmention that the EQCMM is an extremely easy to implement in any firmware.\n", "  We develop a new methodology called double-probe analysis with the aim of\nminimizing informative priors in the estimation of cosmological parameters. We\nextract the dark-energy-model-independent cosmological constraints from the\njoint data sets of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy sample\nand Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement. We measure the mean\nvalues and covariance matrix of $\\{R$, $l_a$, $\\Omega_b h^2$, $n_s$,\n$log(A_s)$, $\\Omega_k$, $H(z)$, $D_A(z)$, $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)\\}$, which give an\nefficient summary of Planck data and 2-point statistics from BOSS galaxy\nsample, where $R=\\sqrt{\\Omega_m H_0^2}\\,r(z_*)$, and $l_a=\\pi r(z_*)/r_s(z_*)$,\n$z_*$ is the redshift at the last scattering surface, and $r(z_*)$ and\n$r_s(z_*)$ denote our comoving distance to $z_*$ and sound horizon at $z_*$\nrespectively. The advantage of this method is that we do not need to put\ninformative priors on the cosmological parameters that galaxy clustering is not\nable to constrain well, i.e. $\\Omega_b h^2$ and $n_s$. Using our double-probe\nresults, we obtain $\\Omega_m=0.304\\pm0.009$, $H_0=68.2\\pm0.7$, and\n$\\sigma_8=0.806\\pm0.014$ assuming $\\Lambda$CDM; and $\\Omega_k=0.002\\pm0.003$\nand $w=-1.00\\pm0.07$ assuming o$w$CDM. The results show no tension with the\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. By comparing with the full-likelihood\nanalyses with fixed dark energy models, we demonstrate that the double-probe\nmethod provides robust cosmological parameter constraints which can be\nconveniently used to study dark energy models. We extend our study to measure\nthe sum of neutrino mass and obtain $\\Sigma m_\\nu<0.10/0.22$ (68\\%/95\\%)\nassuming $\\Lambda$CDM and $\\Sigma m_\\nu<0.26/0.52$ (68\\%/95\\%) assuming $w$CDM.\nThis paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset\nfrom BOSS.\n", "  This paper presents a new encryption scheme called Compact Coding that\nencodes information in time, phase, and intensity domains, simultaneously.\nWhile these approaches have previously been used one at a time, the proposed\nscheme brings to bear for the first time their strengths simultaneously leading\nto an increase in the secure information transfer rate. The proposed scheme is\napplicable to both optical fibers and free space optics, and can be considered\nas an alternative to polarization coding. This paper applies the proposed\ncompact coding scheme to multi-photon tolerant quantum protocols in order to\nproduce quantum-level security during information transfer. We present the\nstructure of the proposed coding scheme in a multi-photon environment and\naddress its operation.\n", "  We consider a large community of individuals who mix strongly and meet in\npairs to bet on a coin toss. We investigate the asset distribution of the\nplayers involved in this zero-sum repeated game. Our main result is that the\nasset distribution converges to the exponential distribution, irrespective of\nthe size of the bet, as long as players can never go bankrupt. Analytical\nresults suggests that the exponential distribution is a stable fixed point for\nthis zero-sum repreated game. This is confirmed in numerical experiments.\n", "  The lithium-carbon binary system possesses a broad range of chemical\ncompounds, which exhibit fascinating chemical bonding characteristics that give\nrise diverse and technologically important properties. While lithium carbides\nwith various compositions have been studied or suggested previously, the\ncrystal structures of these compounds are far from well understood. In this\nwork we present the first comprehensive survey of all ground state (GS)\nstructures of lithium carbides over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions,\nusing \\textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) crystal structure\nsearching methods. Thorough searches were performed for 29 stoichiometries\nranging from Li$_{12}$C to LiC$_{12}$ at 0 GPa as well as 40 GPa. Based on\nformation enthalpies from optimized van der Waals density functional\ncalculations, three thermodynamically stable phases (Li$_4$C$_3$, Li$_2$C$_2$\nand LiC$_{12}$) were identified at 0 GPa, and seven thermodynamically stable\nphases (Li$_8$C, Li$_6$C, Li$_4$C, Li$_8$C$_3$, Li$_2$C, Li$_3$C$_4$, and\nLi$_2$C$_3$) were predicted at 40 GPa. A rich diversity of carbon bonding,\nincluding monomers, dimers, trimers, nanoribbons, sheets and frameworks, was\nfound within these structures, and the dimensionality of carbon connectivity\nexisting within each phase was observed to increase with increasing carbon\nconcentration. Of particular interest, we find that the well-known composition\nLiC$_6$ is actually a metastable one. We also find a unique coexistence of\ncarbon monomers and dimers within the predicted thermodynamically stable phase\nLi$_8$C$_3$, and different widths of carbon nanoribbons coexist in a metastable\nphase of Li$_2$C$_2$ (\\textit{Imm}2). Interesting mixed\n\\textit{sp}$^2$-\\textit{sp}$^3$ carbon frameworks are predicted in metastable\nphases with composition LiC$_6$.\n", "  Charged dust particles form structures which are extended in the vertical\ndirection in the electrode sheath of a rf discharge when confined within a\nglass box. The charge on each particle as a function of height varies due to\nthe changing plasma conditions and the wakefield of upstream particles. Here an\nanalysis of the equilibrium state of chains of varying number of particles is\nanalyzed to determine the charge on each particle within a vertically extended\nchain as well as the magnitude of the positive wakefield charge.\n", "  In this work we study the effect of long range electron-electron correlations\non the behavior of the normal state of metal-intercalated phenacene crystals.\nWhile the individual phenacene molecules are modeled by the Pariser-Parr-Pople\nHamiltonian with long range Coulomb interactions, we derive a correlated\nminimal model for describing the phenacene ionic crystals. We find that long\nrange electron correlations do not change the behavior of the phenacene ions\nwith molecular valence $-1$ (monoanion) and $-2$ (dianion), compared to that\nobserved for short range electron interactions. The monoanion crystal is a\nsingle-band $\\frac{1}{2}$-filled antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard semiconductor\nwhile the dianion crystal is a two-band semiconductor with inter-molecular\nantiferromagnetic and intra-molecular ferromagnetic spin orderings. However,\nthe trianion crystal is no longer a nearly degenerate $\\frac{3}{4}$-filled\ntwo-band system. We show that this occurs because the kinetic stability of the\n$\\frac{3}{4}$-filled two-band system with long range correlations is smaller\ncompared to that with short range correlations, for the lattice sizes\nconsidered in this study. We argue that with large finite lattices, behavior of\nthe trianion crystal with long range correlations will be same as that with\nshort range correlations. We thus conclude that long range correlations fail to\nalter the normal states of metal-intercalated phenacene crystals.\n", "  It was aimed to determine whether plasma processing could contribute to\nenhanced capacitance and energy density of activated carbon electrode based\nelectrochemical capacitors, through the formation of additional surface\ncharges. While an increase of up to 35% of the gravimetric capacitance, along\nwith ~ 20% decrease in resistance, was obtained through optimal plasma\nprocessing, increased plasma exposure yielded a drastic reduction (/increase)\nin the capacitance (/resistance). It was also found that the capacitance and\nresistance modulation was a sensitive function of sample processing as well as\nelectrochemical testing procedure. Considering the complexity of modeling\nrealistic porous matrices, a metric to parameterize the reach of an electrolyte\ninto the matrix has been posited.\n", "  In NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) quantum computation, the selective\ncontrol of multiple homonuclear spins is usually slow because their resonance\nfrequencies are very close to each other. To quickly implement controls against\ndecoherence effects, this paper presents an efficient numerical algorithm\nfordesigning minimum-time local transformations in two homonuclear spins. We\nobtain an accurate minimum-time estimation via geometric analysis on the\ntwo-timescale decomposition of the dynamics. Such estimation narrows down the\nrange of search for the minimum-time control with a gradient-type optimization\nalgorithm. Numerical simulations show that this method can remarkably reduce\nthe search efforts, especially when the frequency difference is very small and\nthe control field is high. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated by NMR\nexperiments with two homunuclear carbon spins in a trichloroethylene (C2H1Cl3)\nsample system.\n", "  In this paper we study, using Monte Carlo simulations, the possibility to\ndiscriminate the mass of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) by\ncombining information obtained from the maximum $X_{max}^{\\mu}$ of the muon\nproduction rate longitudinal profile of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) and the\nnumber of muons, $N^{\\mu}$, which hit an array of detectors located in the\nhorizontal plane. We investigate the sensitivity of the 2D distribution\n$X_{max}^{\\mu}$ versus $N^{\\mu}$ to the mass of the primary particle generating\nthe air shower. To this purpose we analyze a set of CORSIKA showers induced by\nprotons and iron nuclei at energies of $10^{19}$eV and $10^{20}$eV, at five\nangles of incidence, $0^{\\circ}$, $37^{\\circ}$, $48^{\\circ}$, $55^{\\circ}$ and\n$60^{\\circ}$. Using the simulations we obtain the 2D Probability Functions\n$Prob(X_{max}^{\\mu},N^{\\mu} \\ | \\ p)$ and $Prob(X_{max}^{\\mu},N^{\\mu} \\ | \\\nFe)$ which give the probability that a shower induced by a proton or iron\nnucleus contributes to a specific point on the plane ($X_{max}^{\\mu}$,\n$N^{\\mu}$). Then we construct the probability functions $Prob(p\\ | \\\nX_{max}^{\\mu},N^{\\mu})$ and $Prob(Fe \\ | \\ X_{max}^{\\mu},N^{\\mu})$ which give\nthe probability that a certain point on the plane ($X_{max}^{\\mu}$, $N^{\\mu}$)\ncorresponds to a shower initiated by a proton or an iron nucleus, respectively.\nFinally, a test of this procedure using a Bayesian approach, confirms an\nimproved accuracy of the primary mass estimation in comparison with the results\nobtained using only the $X_{max}^{\\mu}$ distributions.\n", "  Photosynthetic proteins have evolved over billions of years so as to undergo\noptimal energy transfer to the sites of charge separation. Based on\nspectroscopically detected quantum coherences, it has been suggested that this\nenergy transfer is partially wavelike. This conclusion critically depends on\nassignment of the coherences to the evolution of excitonic superpositions. Here\nwe demonstrate for a bacterial reaction centre protein that long-lived coherent\nspectroscopic oscillations, which bear canonical signatures of excitonic\nsuperpositions, are essentially vibrational excited state coherences shifted to\nthe ground state of the chromophores . We show that appearance of these\ncoherences is brought about by release of electronic energy during the energy\ntransfer. Our results establish how energy migrates on vibrationally hot\nchromophores in the reaction centre and they call for a re-examination of\nclaims of quantum energy transfer in photosynthesis.\n", "  The HP model of protein folding, where the chain exists in a free medium, is\ninvestigated using a parallel Monte Carlo scheme based upon Wang-Landau\nsampling. Expanding on the work of Wust and Landau by introducing a lesser\nknown replica -exchange scheme between individual Wang- Landau samplers, the\nproblem of dynamical trapping (spiking in the density of states) was avoided\nand an enhancement in the efficiency of traversing configuration space was\nobtained. Highlighting dynamical trapping as an issue for lattice polymer\nsimulations for increasing lengths is explicitly done here for the first time.\nThe 1/t scheme is also integrated within this sophisticated Monte Carlo\nmethodology. A trial move set was developed which includes pull, bond\nre-bridging, pivot, kink-flip and a newly invented and implemented fragment\nrandom walk move which allowed rapid exploration of high and low temperature\nconfigurations. A native state search was conducted leading to the attainment\nof the native states of the benchmark sequences of 2D50 (-21), 2D60 (-36)and\n2D64 (-42), whilst attaining minimum energies close to the native state for\n2D85(-52 NATIVE= -53), 2D100a (-47 NATIVE= -48) and 2D100b (-49 NATIVE=-50).\nThermodynamic observables such as the specific heat, internal energy, entropy\nand free energy were computed for 2D benchmark sequences at varying\ntemperatures and folding and unfolding behaviour was investigated. Lattice\npolymers with monomeric hydrophobic structure were also studied in the same\nmanner with the recording of minimum energy values and thermodynamic behaviour.\nThe native results for the benchmark sequences and lattice polymers were\ncompared with varying computational methods.\n", "  We experimentally and numerically study the dependence of different\nnavigation strategies regarding the effectivity of an active particle to reach\na predefined target area. As the only control parameter, we vary the particle's\npropulsion velocity depending on its position and orientation relative to the\ntarget site. By introducing different figures of merit, e.g. the time to target\nor the total consumed propulsion energy, we are able to quantify and compare\nthe efficiency of different strategies. Our results suggest, that each strategy\nto navigate towards a target, has its strengths and weaknesses and none of them\noutperforms the other in all regards. Accordingly, the choice of an ideal\nnavigation strategy will strongly depend on the specific conditions and the\nfigure of merit which should be optimized.\n", "  We report the detection of a very low mass star (VLMS) companion to the\nprimary star 1SWASPJ234318.41+295556.5A (J2343+29A), using radial velocity (RV)\nmeasurements from the PARAS (PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search) high\nresolution echelle spectrograph. The periodicity of the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary (SB1) system, as determined from 20 sets of RV observations from PARAS\nand 6 supporting sets of observations from SOPHIE data, is found to be 16.953 d\nas against the 4.24 d period reported from SuperWasp photometry. It is likely\nthat inadequate phase coverage of the transit with SuperWasp photometry led to\nthe incorrect determination of the period for this system. We derive the\nspectral properties of the primary star from the observed stellar spectra: Teff\n= 5125 +/- 67 K, [Fe/H] = 0.1 +/- 0.14 and log g = 4.6 +/- 0.14, indicating a\nK1V primary. Applying the Torres relation to the derived stellar parameters, we\nestimate a primary mass 0.864 +/- 0.097 M_sun and a radius of 0.854 +/- 0.050\nR_sun. We combine RV data with SuperWASP photometry to estimate the mass of the\nsecondary, M_B = 0.098 +/- 0.007 M_sun, and its radius, R_B = 0.127 +/- 0.007\nR_sun, with an accuracy of around 7%. Although the observed radius is found to\nbe consistent with the Baraffe's theoretical models, the uncertainties on the\nmass and radius of the secondary reported here are model dependent and should\nbe used with discretion. Here, we establish this system as a potential\nbenchmark for the study of VLMS objects, worthy of both photometric follow-up\nand the investment of time on high-resolution spectrographs paired with\nlarge-aperture telescopes.\n", "  The production of a strongly interacting medium in heavy-ion collisions is\nidentified through suppression of high transverse momentum jets leading to an\neffect known as jet quenching. Detailed measurements of nuclear modification\nfactors and energy flow of the aforementioned quenched jets are performed with\nthe CMS detector. These new results extend previous measurements to large\nangles with respect to the quenched jets and increase reach in the transverse\nmomentum range. High statistics pp, pPb and PbPb data taken in 2011-13 are used\nin the following analysis. A new data-driven method to estimate the underlying\nevent contribution from the forward calorimeter energy distribution is employed\nwhich takes into account possible event by event flow modulation. The flavor\ndependence of energy loss of jets is studied by tagging heavy flavor b-jets in\nthese systems.\n", "  The dynamics of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in solids are dictated by\nmany-body interactions such as electron-electron and electron-phonon\nscattering. Hence, understanding and controlling these scattering channels is\ncrucial for many optoelectronic applications, ranging from light harvesting to\noptical amplification. Here we measure the formation and relaxation of the\nphoto-generated non-thermal carrier distribution in monolayer graphene with\ntime- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using sub 10fs pulses we\nidentify impact ionization as the primary scattering channel, which dominates\nthe dynamics for the first 25fs after photo-excitation. Auger recombination is\nfound to set in once the carriers have accumulated at the Dirac point with time\nscales between 100 and 250fs, depending on the number of non-thermal carriers.\nOur observations help in gauging graphene's potential as a solar cell and\nTeraHertz lasing material.\n", "  Mobile dating applications (MDAs) have skyrocketed in popularity in the last\nfew years, with popular MDA Tinder alone matching 26 million pairs of users per\nday. In addition to becoming an influential part of modern dating culture, MDAs\nfacilitate a unique form of mediated communication: dyadic mobile text messages\nbetween pairs of users who are not already acquainted. Furthermore, mobile\ndating has paved the way for analysis of these digital interactions via massive\nsets of data generated by the instant matching and messaging functions of its\nmany platforms at an unprecedented scale. This paper looks at one of these sets\nof data: metadata of approximately two million conversations, containing 19\nmillion messages, exchanged between 400,000 heterosexual users on an MDA.\nThrough computational analysis methods, this study offers the very first large\nscale quantitative depiction of mobile dating as a whole. We report on\ndifferences in how heterosexual male and female users communicate with each\nother on MDAs, differences in behaviors of dyads of varying degrees of social\nseparation, and factors leading to \"success\"-operationalized by the exchange of\nphone numbers between a match. For instance, we report that men initiate 79% of\nconversations--and while about half of the initial messages are responded to,\nconversations initiated by men are more likely to be reciprocated. We also\nreport that the length of conversations, the waiting times, and the length of\nmessages have fat-tailed distributions. That said, the majority of reciprocated\nconversations lead to a phone number exchange within the first 20 messages.\n", "  We analysed the light curve of four, apparently extremely metal-rich\nfundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars. We identified two stars, MT Tel and ASAS\nJ091803-3022.6 as RRc (first-overtone) pulsators that were misclassified as\nRRab ones in the ASAS survey. In the case of the other two stars, V397 Gem and\nASAS J075127-4136.3, we could not decide conclusively, as they are outliers in\nthe period-Fourier-coefficient space from the loci of both classes, but their\nphotometric metallicities also favour the RRc classification.\n", "  As measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters improve it is becoming\nmore interesting to study antineutrino oscillations, to investigate CP and CPT\nviolation in the lepton sector and nonstandard matter effects. We present the\nmost recent T2K antineutrino oscillation results, from data collected using a\nmuon antineutrino-enhanced neutrino beam corresponding to 4.01E20 protons on\ntarget. The first analysis of electron antineutrino appearance at T2K is\npresented, as well as world-leading measurements of the dominant oscillation\nparameters for muon antineutrino disappearance. T2K measures\n$\\sin^2(\\bar{\\theta}_{23}) = 0.46^{+0.14}_{-0.06}$ and $\\Delta \\bar{m}^2_{32} =\n2.50^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \\times 10^{-3} \\mbox{eV}^2$, which is consistent with\nprevious T2K measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters and existing\nantineutrino measurements.\n", "  We explain the results of Yu et al. (2015b) of the novel sharpness angle\nmeasurement to a large number of spectra obtained from the Fermi gamma-ray\nburst monitor. The sharpness angle is compared to the values obtained from\nvarious representative emission models: blackbody, single-electron synchrotron,\nsynchrotron emission from a Maxwellian or power-law electron distribution. It\nis found that more than 91% of the high temporally and spectrally resolved\nspectra are inconsistent with any kind of optically thin synchrotron emission\nmodel alone. It is also found that the limiting case, a single temperature\nMaxwellian synchrotron function, can only contribute up to 58+23 -18% of the\npeak flux. These results show that even the sharpest but non-realistic case,\nthe single-electron synchrotron function, cannot explain a large fraction of\nthe observed spectra. Since any combination of physically possible synchrotron\nspectra added together will always further broaden the spectrum, emission\nmechanisms other than optically thin synchrotron radiation are likely required\nin a full explanation of the spectral peaks or breaks of the GRB prompt\nemission phase.\n", "  In the framework of a hamiltonian nonperturbative approach we show that after\ndemanding current conservation together with the Gauss constraints at some\ninitial time in a nonabelian Nambu model, we recover the corresponding\nYang-Mills theory. In this way, the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking\npresent in the Nambu model becomes unobservable and the Goldstone modes can be\nidentified with the corresponding gauge bosons.\n", "  Thermoelectric effects allow the generation of electrical power from waste\nheat and the electrical control of cooling and heating. Remarkably, these\neffects are also highly sensitive to the asymmetry in the density of states\naround the Fermi energy and can therefore be exploited as probes of distortions\nin the electronic structure at the nanoscale. Here we consider two-dimensional\ngraphene as an excellent nanoscale carbon material for exploring the\ninteraction between electronic and thermal transport phenomena, by presenting a\ndirect and quantitative measurement of the Peltier component to electronic\ncooling and heating in graphene. Thanks to an architecture including nanoscale\nthermometers, we detected Peltier component modulation of up to 15 mK for\ncurrents of 20 $\\mu$A at room temperature and observed a full reversal between\nPeltier cooling and heating for electron and hole regimes. This fundamental\nthermodynamic property is a complementary tool for the study of nanoscale\nthermoelectric transport in two-dimensional materials.\n", "  Evolutionary tracks for the X-ray binaries Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1,\nSS 433, and M33 X-7 are computed using the Scenario Machine code. The compact\nobjects in IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and M33 X-7 are the most massive stellar\nmass black hole candidates. Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, and NGC 300 X-1 are the only\ncurrently known Wolf-Rayet stars with degenerate companions. SS 433 is the only\nknown superaccretor in the Milky Way. Therefore, the stars studied provide\nexcellent laboratories for testing scenarios for the evolution of binaries\nunder extreme conditions. The classical evolutionary scenario is consistent\nwith modern observational data. During the evolution of these binaries,\nhypernova explosions accompanied by the collapse of stellar cores with large\nangular momenta can occur, leading to long gamma-ray bursts. At the end of\ntheir evolution, Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and SS 433 may form binary\nrelativistic objects, which will subsequently merge due to the radiation of\ngravitational waves. The gravitational waves emitted during mergers of\nrelativistic stars should be detectable by existing and future\ngravitational-wave antennas. In the course of its future evolution, M33 X-7\nwill pass through a Thorne-Zytkow stage. The formation of a Thorne-Zytkow\nobject can also be accompanied by gravitational-wave radiation. Figure 2\ncontains two merging black holes with masses almost identical to the second\nLIGO event GW151226.\n", "  Motivated by observations of heterogeneous domain structure on the surface of\ncells, we consider a minimal model to describe the dynamics of phase separation\non the surface of a spherical particle. Finite-size effects on the curved\nparticle surface lead to the formation of long-lived, metastable states for\nwhich the density is distributed in patches over the particle surface. We study\nthe time evolution and stability of these states as a function of both the\nparticle size and the thermodynamic parameters. Finally, by connecting our\nfindings with studies of patchy particles, we consider the implications for\nself-assembly in many-particle systems.\n", "  The authors investigate the ideal, nondriven multifluid equations of motion\nto identify consistent (i.e., truly stationary), mechanically static models for\ncomposition profiles within the thermosphere. These physically faithful\nfunctions are necessary to define the parametric core of future empirical\natmospheric models and climatologies. Based on the strength of interspecies\ncoupling, the thermosphere has three altitude regions: (1) the lower\nthermosphere (herein z < ~100 km), in which all species move together at the\ncomposite fluid velocity with an effective particle mass equal to the average\nparticle mass of the composite fluid; (2) the upper thermosphere (herein z >\n~200 km), in which the species flows are approximately uncoupled; and (3) a\ntransition region in between, where the effective species particle mass and the\neffective species vertical flow interpolate between the solutions for the upper\nand lower thermosphere. We place this view in the context of current\nterminology within the community, i.e., a fully mixed (lower) region and an\nupper region in diffusive equilibrium (DE). The latter condition, DE, currently\nused in empirical composition models, does not represent a truly static\ncomposition profile in the presence of finite thermal diffusion. Rather,\nspecies by species hydrostatic balance is a consistent (i.e., stationary)\nstatic representation of vertical thermospheric composition profiles.\n", "  We report here and experimentally demonstrate an actively controlled\ngatetunable plasmonic metasurface operating in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, where strikingly the operating voltages for\nreflectance modulation are much less than 1V. The electrically tunable\nmetasurface consists of inverse dolmen structures (iDolmen) patterned on silver\nand chromium on a quartz substrate and subsequently covered with a 5 nm thin\nlayer of Al2O3 followed by a 110 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, which acts as\na transparent electrode. Our designed structures show up to 78 percent change\nin reflection upon applying small voltages (less than 1V). We explain this\nbehaviour via ion conductance of silver through Al2O3 and ITO, leading to\nactive resistive switching. Interesting complementary effects such as decreased\nreflection in the same structures over a broadband of wavelengths is also seen\non reversing the applied bias. The results provide an insight into the use of\nthe resistive switching for electrical control over light-matter interaction in\nplasmonic metasurfaces.\n", "  The Universe dynamical equations discovered by Alexander Friedmann in 1922\nare simple enough to be clear for undergraduate students or even for smart\nsenior schoolkids. The background cosmology driven by the dust-like matter and\nby positive cosmological constant in General Relativity can be understood as a\nradial motion of a test particle in the superposition of Newtonian and\nanti-Hook potentials according to Newtonian mechanics. This analogy was\nmentioned by George Gamov in his book (1952). The present paper was written as\na pedagogical and methodological text.\n", "  Even though it has been almost a century since quantum mechanics planted\nroots, the field has its share of unresolved problems. It could be the result\nof a wrong mathematical structure providing inadequate understanding of the\nquantum phenomena.\n", "  In this study, we probe the cosmic homogeneity with the BOSS CMASS galaxy\nsample in the redshift region of $0.43 < z < 0.7$. We use the normalised\ncounts-in-spheres estimator $\\mathcal{N}(<r)$ and the fractal correlation\ndimension $\\mathcal{D}_{2}(r)$ to assess the homogeneity scale of the universe.\nWe verify that the universe becomes homogenous on scales greater than\n$\\mathcal{R}_{H} \\simeq 64.3\\pm1.6\\ h^{-1}Mpc$, consolidating the Cosmological\nPrinciple with a consistency test of $\\Lambda$CDM model at the percentage\nlevel. Finally, we explore the evolution of the homogeneity scale in redshift.\n", "  Modification of calcium carbonate particles with surfactant significantly\nimproves the properties of the calcium carbonate coating on paper. Unmodified\nand CTAB and oleate-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles were prepared\nusing the wet carbonation technique for paper coating. CTAB (cationic\nsurfactant) and sodium oleate (anionic surfactant) were used to modify the\nsize, morphology, and surface properties of the precipitated nanoparticles. The\nobtained particles were characterized by XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, zeta\npotential measurements, TGA and TEM. Coating colors were formulated from the\nprepared unmodified and modified calcium carbonates and examined by creating a\nthin coating layer on reference paper. The effect of calcium carbonate particle\nsize and surface modification on paper properties, such as coating thickness,\ncoating weight, surface roughness, air permeability, brightness, whiteness,\nopacity, and hydrophobicity, were investigated and compared with GCC calcium\ncarbonate-coated papers. The obtained calcium carbonate nanoparticles are in\nthe calcite phase. The morphology of the prepared calcium carbonate\nnanoparticles is rhombohedral, and the average particle diameter is <100 nm.\nCompared to commercial GCC, the use of unmodified and CTAB- and oleate-modified\ncalcium carbonate nanoparticles in paper coating improves the properties of\npaper. The highest measured paper properties were observed for paper coated\nwith oleate-modifed nanoparticles, where an increase in smoothness (decrease in\npaper roughness) (+23%), brightness (+1.3%), whiteness (+2.8%), and opacity\n(+2.3%) and a decrease in air permeability (-26%) was obtained with 25% less\ncoat weight. The WCA at 10 min was about 112{\\deg} for the paper coated with\noleate-modified nanoparticles and 42{\\deg} for paper coated with CTAB-modified\nnanoparticles compared to 104{\\deg} for GCC-coated paper.\n", "  We consider odd Poisson (odd symplectic) structure on supermanifolds induced\nby an odd symmetric rank $2$ (non-degenerate) contravariant tensor field. We\ndescribe the difference between odd Riemannian and odd symplectic structure in\nterms of the Cartan prolongation of the corresponding Lie algebras, and\nformulate an analogue of the Levi-Civita theorem for an odd symplectic\nsupermanifold.\n", "  We study a potential genetic relationship of comets C/1846 O1 and C/1973 D1,\nwhose apparent orbital similarity was tested by Kresak (1982) only\nstatistically, using the Southworth-Hawkins (1963) criterion D. Our orbit\ndetermination for C/1846 O1 shows its period was ~500 yr, ~30 times shorter\nthan that of C/1973 D1. Formerly unrecognized, this incongruity makes the\nobjects' common origin less likely. Long-term orbit integration suggests that,\nif related, the two comets would have to have separated far away from the Sun\n(probably ~700 AU) 21 millennia ago and, unlike C/1973 D1, C/1846 O1 would have\nto have been subjected to a complex orbital evolution. Given the chance of\nencountering Jupiter to ~0.6 AU some 400 days after perihelion, C/1846 O1 and\nC/1973 D1 may have been perturbed, during their return in the 15th millennium\nBCE, into orbits that were, respectively, smaller and larger than was the\nparent's, with a net difference of more than 0.002 (AU)^{-1} in 1/a. Whereas\nC/1973 D1 was on the way to its 1973 perihelion, C/1846 O1 should have been\nsubjected to recurring encounters with Jupiter, during which the orbital period\ncontinued to shorten by integral multiples of the Jovian orbital period, a\nprocess called high-order orbital-cascade resonance. While the integrated\nperturbation effect of C/1846 O1 by Jupiter does not appear to reduce the\ncomet's orbital period to below ~1200 yr by the mid-19th century, we find that\norbital-cascade resonance offers an attractive mechanism for rapid inward\ndrifting of aphelion especially among dynamically new comets.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the influence of a continuous particles creation\nprocesses on the linear and nonlinear matter clustering, and its consequences\non the weak lensing effect induced by structure formation. We study the line of\nsight behavior of the contribution to the bispectrum signal at a given angular\nmultipole $l$, showing that the scale where the nonlinear growth overcomes the\nlinear effect depends strongly of particles creation rate.\n", "  Locating sources on the sky is one of the largest challenges in gravitational\nwave astronomy, owing to the omni-directional nature of gravitational wave\ndetection techniques, and the often intrinsically weak signals being observed.\nGround-based detectors can address the pointing problem by observing with a\nnetwork of detectors, effectively triangulating signal locations by observing\nthe arrival times across the network. Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams. Taking the signals from multiple\ndetectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a two\nparameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wave\nsignal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of the\nsource. This technique has been demonstrated for a network of ground-based\ninterferometric observatories, and for 6-link space interferometers. This paper\nderives and extends the null-stream pointing method to the unique case of\npulsar timing residuals. The basic method is derived and demonstrated, and the\nnecessity of using the method with multiple sub-arrays of pulsars in the pulsar\ntiming array network is considered.\n", "  The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) routinely performs coronal\npolarimetric measurements using the Fe XIII 10747 $\\AA$ and 10798 $\\AA$ lines,\nwhich are sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. However, inverting such\npolarimetric measurements into magnetic field data is a difficult task because\nthe corona is optically thin at these wavelengths and the observed signal is\ntherefore the integrated emission of all the plasma along the line of sight. To\novercome this difficulty, we take on a new approach that combines a\nparameterized 3D magnetic field model with forward modeling of the polarization\nsignal. For that purpose, we develop a new, fast and efficient, optimization\nmethod for model-data fitting: the Radial-basis-functions Optimization\nApproximation Method (ROAM). Model-data fitting is achieved by optimizing a\nuser-specified log-likelihood function that quantifies the differences between\nthe observed polarization signal and its synthetic/predicted analogue. Speed\nand efficiency are obtained by combining sparse evaluation of the magnetic\nmodel with radial-basis-function (RBF) decomposition of the log-likelihood\nfunction. The RBF decomposition provides an analytical expression for the\nlog-likelihood function that is used to inexpensively estimate the set of\nparameter values optimizing it. We test and validate ROAM on a synthetic test\nbed of a coronal magnetic flux rope and show that it performs well with a\nsignificantly sparse sample of the parameter space. We conclude that our\noptimization method is well-suited for fast and efficient model-data fitting\nand can be exploited for converting coronal polarimetric measurements, such as\nthe ones provided by CoMP, into coronal magnetic field data.\n", "  Non-relativistic bound state theories for QED and QCD have become fairly\nmature and amenable to a textbook-level understanding and computation. In this\ntalk we give an introductory review of the following subjects related to the\nrecent computation of the heavy quarkonium spectrum using perturbative QCD: (1)\nTechnological developments in higher-order computation, (2) Physics\npredictions, (3) Challenge towards analytic evaluation of the 3-loop static QCD\npotential.\n", "  We report on the crystal growth and characterization of ABi3 (A=Ba,Sr)\nsuperconductors. Single crystals of both compounds were grown by the self-flux\ntechnique. BaBi3 crystallized in a tetragonal structure with space group P4/mmm\nand SrBi3 in a cubic structure with space group Pm-3m. Superconductivity at Tc\n= 6.0 K for BaBi3 and Tc = 5.6 K for SrBi3 have been confirmed through dc\nmagnetic susceptibility and electrical transport measurements. The dc magnetic\nsusceptibility under hydrostatic pressure shows a positive pressure coefficient\nof dTc/dP = 1.22 K/GPa for BaBi3 and a negative pressure coefficient of dTc/dP\n= -0.48 K/GPa for SrBi3. The normal state electrical resistivity shows that\nboth compounds are highly metallic in nature. The upper critical fields Hc2\nevaluated by resistivity under magnetic fields $\\rho(T,H)$ are 22 kOe for BaBi3\nand 2.9 kOe for SrBi3. A specific heat jump of $\\Delta Ce/\\gamma Tc = 1.05$\nsuggests weak coupling superconductivity in BaBi3, whereas $\\Delta Ce/\\gamma Tc\n= 2.08$ for SrBi3 is higher than the BCS theory value of 1.43, indicating a\nstrong coupling superconductor.\n", "  We solve the Maxwell and heat equations self-consistently for metal\nnanoparticles under intense continuous wave (CW) illumination. Unlike previous\nstudies, we rely on {\\em experimentally}-measured data for the metal\npermittivity for increasing temperature and for the visible spectral range. We\nshow that the thermal nonlinearity of the metal can lead to substantial\ndeviations from the predictions of the linear model for the temperature and\nfield distribution, and thus, can explain qualitatively the strong nonlinear\nscattering from such configurations observed experimentally. We also show that\nthe incompleteness of existing data of the temperature dependence of the\nthermal properties of the system prevents reaching a quantitative agreement\nbetween the measured and calculated scattering data. This modelling approach is\nessential for the identification of the underlying physical mechanism\nresponsible for the thermo-optical nonlinearity of the metal and should be\nadopted in all applications of high temperature nonlinear plasmonics,\nespecially for refractory metals, both for CW and pulsed illumination.\n"]}
