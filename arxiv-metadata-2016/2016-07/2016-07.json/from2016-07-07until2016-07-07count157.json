In order to do this we employ several\napproaches that have been developed starting from the potential-density pair\nand, essentially using the method introduced by Kalnajs (Ap. J., 205, 751,\n1976) we obtain some distribution functions that depend on the Jacobi integral.\nNow, as this method demands that the mass density can be properly expressed as\na function of the gravitational potential, we can do this only for the first\nfour discs of the family. We also find another kind of distribution functions\nby starting with the even part of the previous distribution functions and using\nthe maximum entropy principle in order to find the odd part and so a new\ndistribution function, as it was pointed out by Dejonghe (Phys. Rep., 133, 217,\n1986). The result is a wide variety of equilibrium states corresponding to\nseveral self-consistent finite flat galaxy models.\n", "  A new coordinate system is defined for the Four-Body dynamical problem with\ngeneral masses, having as its origin of coordinates the center of mass. The\ntransformation from the inertial coordinate system involves a combination of a\nrotation to the principal axis of inertia, followed by three changes of scale\nleading the principal moments of inertia to yield a body with three equal\nmoments of inertia, and finally a second rotation that leaves unaltered the\nequal moments of inertia. These three transformations yield a mass-dependent\nrigid orthogonal tetrahedron of constant volume in the inertial coordinates.\nEach of those three linear transformations is a function of three coordinates\nthat produce the nine degrees of freedom of the Four-Body problem, in a\ncoordinate system with the center of mass as origin. The relation between the\nwell known equilateral tetrahedron solution of the gravitational Four-Body\nproblem and the new coordinates is exhibited, and the plane case of central\nconfigurations with four different masses is computed numerically in these\ncoordinates.\n", "  We investigate the magnitude and internal alignment of the angular momentum\nof cold dark matter haloes in simulations with and without baryons. We analyse\nthe cumulative angular momentum profiles of hundreds of thousands of haloes in\nthe Millennium simulation and in a smaller, but higher resolution, simulation,\nin total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. For haloes of a given mass,\nthe median specific angular momentum increases as j(<r) proportional to r. The\ndirection of the vector varies considerably with radius: the median angle\nbetween the inner (< 0.25 Rvir) and total (< Rvir) angular momentum vectors is\nabout 25degr. To investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another high\nresolution simulation, which includes gas cooling, star formation and feedback.\nThis simulation produces a sample of galaxies with a realistic distribution of\ndisc-to-total ratios. The formation of the galaxy spins up the dark matter\nwithin 0.1 Rvir such that the specific halo angular momentum increases by\napprox 50% in the median. The dark matter angular momentum becomes better\naligned, but there remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between the\nhalo and the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momenta\nof ~ 30degr. Galaxies have a range of orientations relative to the shape of the\nhalo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than 45degr.\nFinally, we align a sample of haloes according to the orientation of their\ngalaxies and stack the projected mass distributions. Although the individual\nhaloes are aspherical, galaxy--halo misalignments produce a stacked mass\ndistribution that is indistinguishable from circular. If the misalignment found\nin our simulations is realistic, it will be extremely difficult for weak\nlensing studies to measure the shape of dark haloes using this technique.\n", "  Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation typically form the spheroidal\ncomponents of galaxies (\"bulges\"), solely through galactic major mergers.\nHowever, it is possible that non-merger events (e.g. a \"fly-by\" by a smaller\nhalo) can perturb a galaxy--halo system sufficiently to form a bulge. We\npresent a preliminary investigation into the frequency of major changes in halo\nand galaxy spin direction, which could be signatures of such events.\n", "  An interesting description of a collinear configuration of four particles is\nfound in terms of two spherical coordinates. An algorithm to compute the four\ncoordinates of particles of a collinear Four-Body central configuration is\npresented by using an orthocentric tetrahedron, which edge lengths are function\nof given masses. Each mass is placed at the corresponding vertex of the\ntetrahedron. The center of mass (and orthocenter) of the tetrahedron is at the\norigin of coordinates. The initial position of the tetrahedron is placed with\ntwo pairs of vertices each in a coordinate plan, the lines joining any pair of\nthem parallel to a coordinate axis, the center of masses of each and the center\nof mass of the four on one coordinate axis. From this original position the\ntetrahedron is rotated by two angles around the center of mass until the\ndirection of configuration coincides with one axis of coordinates. The four\ncoordinates of the vertices of the tetrahedron along this direction determine\nthe central configuration by finding the two angles corresponding to it. The\ntwelve possible configurations predicted by Moulton's theorem are computed for\na particular mass choice.\n", "  During the growth of a cold dark matter halo, the direction of its spin can\nundergo rapid changes. These could disrupt or even destroy a stellar disc\nforming in the halo, possibly resulting in the generation of a bulge or\nspheroid. We investigate the frequency of significant changes in the\norientation of the angular momentum vector of dark matter haloes (\"spin\nflips\"), and their degree of correlation with mergers. We focus on haloes of\nmass similar to that of the Milky Way (MW) halo at redshift z=0 (log M/(Msol/h)\n= 12.0 to 12.5) and consider flips in the spin of the whole halo or just its\ninner parts. We find that a greater fraction of major mergers are associated\nwith large spin flips than minor mergers. However, since major mergers are\nrare, the vast majority (93%) of large whole-halo spin flips (angle change >=\n45 degrees) coincide with small mass changes, not major mergers. The spin\nvector of the inner halo experiences much more frequent flips than the halo as\na whole. Over their entire lifetimes (i.e. after a halo acquires half of its\nfinal mass), over 10% of halos experience a flip of at least 45 degrees in the\nspin of the entire halo and nearly 60 percent experience a flip this large in\nthe inner halo. These numbers are reduced to 9 percent for the whole halo and\n47 percent for the inner halo when we consider only haloes with no major\nmergers after formation. Our analysis suggests that spin flips (whose effects\nare not currently included in galaxy formation models) could be an important\nfactor in the morphological transformation of disc galaxies.\n", "  We analyse the impact of galaxy--halo misalignment on the ability of weak\nlensing studies to constrain the shape of dark matter haloes, using a\ncombination of the Millennium dark matter N-body simulation and different\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation models, as well as simpler Monte Carlo tests.\nSince the distribution of galaxy--halo alignments is not known in detail, we\ntest various alignment models, together with different methods of determining\nthe halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass\nand shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked\nprojected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers\nof galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo\naxis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such\nas those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity\nsignal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure\nobservationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis\nratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models,\nand between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty:\nIt is naive to assume that, simply because LCDM predicts aspherical haloes, the\nstacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust LCDM\nprediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such\nelliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will\nbe extremely difficult.\n", "  We use the Millennium Simulation series to study how the dynamical state of\ndark matter halos affects the relation between mass and concentration. We find\nthat a large fraction of massive systems are identified when they are\nsubstantially out of equilibrium and in a particular phase of their dynamical\nevolution: the more massive the halo, the more likely it is found at a\ntransient stage of high concentration. This state reflects the recent assembly\nof massive halos and corresponds to the first pericentric passage of\nrecently-accreted material when, before virialization, the kinetic and\npotential energies reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. This result\nexplains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported in\nrecent work for massive halos; indeed, the upturn disappears when only\ndynamically-relaxed systems are considered in the analysis. Our results warn\nagainst applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare,\nmassive galaxy clusters and urges caution when extrapolating scaling laws\ncalibrated on lower-mass systems, where such deviations from equilibrium are\nless common. The evolving dynamical state of galaxy clusters ought to be\ncarefully taken into account if cluster studies are to provide precise\ncosmological constraints.\n", "  In this paper we prove that a fundamental constraint on the cooling dynamic\nimplies that it is impossible to cool, via a unitary system-bath quantum\nevolution, a system that is embedded in a thermal environment down to its\nground state, if the initial state is a factorized product of system and bath\nstates. The latter is a crucial but artificial assumption often included in\nmany descriptions of system-bath dynamics. The analogous conclusion holds for\n'cooling' to any pure state of the system.\n", "  We use the Millennium Simulation series to study the relation between the\naccretion history (MAH) and mass profile of cold dark matter halos. We find\nthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo density\nprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density\nof the Universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals the\nmass enclosed within r_{-2}. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and\ndensity, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the\nUniverse, M(\\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,\nM(<\\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the\nsimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo\nMAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose\naccretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show\ncorrelated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.\nFitting both M(<\\rho >) and M(\\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles\nyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and\nextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion\nhistory. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to\ninitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from\nthe NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a\nresult, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,\nwhich do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than\nCDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass\nprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong\nsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose\nhere.\n", "  This paper deals with the old yet unsolved problem of defining and evaluating\nthe stored electromagnetic energy - a quantity essential for calculating the\nquality factor, which reflects the intrinsic bandwidth of the considered\nelectromagnetic system. A novel paradigm is proposed to determine the stored\nenergy in the time domain leading to the method, which exhibits positive\nsemi-definiteness and coordinate independence, i.e. two key properties actually\nnot met by the contemporary approaches. The proposed technique is compared with\ntwo up-to-date frequency domain methods that are extensively used in practice.\nAll three concepts are discussed and compared on the basis of examples of\nvarying complexity, starting with lumped RLC circuits and finishing with\nrealistic radiators.\n", "  We present the direct photon production for $1<p_{T}<10$ GeV/$c$ derived from\ncontinuum in the dielectron invariant mass region $0.1<M_{ee}<0.3$ GeV/$c^{2}$\nfrom one billion $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au events taken in year 2010 and\n2011. A clear excess in the invariant yield compared to the number of binary\ncollision scaled $p+p$ reference is observed in the \\pt~range 1-4 GeV/$c$.\nModel calculations with contributions from thermal radiation and initial hard\nparton scattering are consistent within uncertainties with the direct photon\ninvariant yield.\n", "  We define intrinsic torsion in generalised geometry and use it to introduce a\nnew notion of generalised special holonomy. We then consider generic warped\nsupersymmetric flux compactifications of M theory and Type II of the form\n$\\mathbb{R}^{D-1,1}\\times M$. Using the language of\n$E_{d(d)}\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ generalised geometry, we show that, for $D\\geq 4$,\npreserving minimal supersymmetry is equivalent to the manifold $M$ having\ngeneralised special holonomy and list the relevant holonomy groups. We\nconjecture that this result extends to backgrounds preserving any number of\nsupersymmetries. As a prime example, we consider $\\mathcal{N}=1$ in $D=4$. The\ncorresponding generalised special holonomy group is $SU(7)$, giving the natural\nM theory extension to the notion of a $G_2$ manifold, and, for Type II\nbackgrounds, reformulating the pure spinor $SU(3)\\times SU(3)$ conditions as an\nintegrable structure.\n", "  We study chaotic dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theory through\nout-of-time order thermal correlators of the form $\\langle W(t)VW(t)V\\rangle$.\nWe reproduce bulk calculations similar to those of [1], by studying the large\n$c$ Virasoro identity block. The contribution of this block to the above\ncorrelation function begins to decrease exponentially after a delay of $\\sim\nt_* - \\frac{\\beta}{2\\pi}\\log \\beta^2E_w E_v$, where $t_*$ is the scrambling\ntime $\\frac{\\beta}{2\\pi}\\log c$, and $E_w,E_v$ are the energy scales of the\n$W,V$ operators.\n", "  Dijkgraaf-Witten theories are quantum field theories based on (form degree 1)\ngauge fields valued in finite groups. We describe their generalization based on\n$p$-form gauge fields valued in finite abelian groups, as field theories\nextended to codimension 2.\n", "  Collider, direct and indirect searches for dark matter have typically little\nor no sensitivity to weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with masses\nabove a few TeV. This rather unexplored regime can however be probed through\nthe search for distinctive gamma-ray spectral features produced by the\nannihilation of WIMPs at very high energies. Here we present a dedicated search\nfor gamma-ray boxes -- sharp spectral features that cannot be mimicked by\nastrophysical sources -- with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\nUsing realistic projections for the instrument performance and detailed\nbackground modelling, a profile likelihood analysis is implemented to derive\nthe expected upper limits and sensitivity reach after 100 h of observations\ntowards a $2^\\circ\\times2^\\circ$ region around the Galactic centre. Our results\nshow that CTA will be able to probe gamma-ray boxes down to annihilation cross\nsections of $10^{-27}-10^{-26}\\,\\text{cm}^3\\text{/s}$ up to tens of TeV. We\nalso identify a number of concrete particle physics models providing thermal\ndark matter candidates that can be used as target benchmarks in future search\ncampaigns. This constitutes a golden opportunity for CTA to either discover or\nrule out multi-TeV thermal dark matter in a corner of parameter space where all\nother experimental efforts are basically insensitive.\n", "  We investigate the charge transport property of superconductor (S) /normal\nmetal (N) / ferromagnet insulator (FI) /(normal metal) N' and S/N/FI/N'/S\nJosephson junctions on a three-dimensional topological insulator surface. We\nfind asymmetric local density of states (LDOSs) in a S/N/FI/N' junction and\nshow that the finite length of the N interlayer gives rise to subgap resonant\nspikes in the differential conductance and LDOSs. In a S/N/FI/N'/S junction,\nthe Josephson current shows a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation and the N\n(or N') interlayer decreases the magnitude of the critical current\nmonotonically.\n", "  Topological states of matter such as quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are of great\ninterest because of their remarkable predicted properties including protection\nof quantum information and the emergence of Majorana fermions. Such QSLs,\nhowever, have proven difficult to identify experimentally. The most promising\napproach is to study their exotic nature via the wave-vector and intensity\ndependence of their dynamical response in neutron scattering. A major search\nhas centered on iridate materials which are proposed to realize the celebrated\nKitaev model on a honeycomb lattice - a prototypical topological QSL system in\ntwo dimensions (2D). The difficulties of iridium for neutron measurements have,\nhowever, impeded progress significantly. Here we provide experimental evidence\nthat a material based on ruthenium, {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ realizes the same Kitaev\nphysics but is highly amenable to neutron investigation. Our measurements\nconfirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling, and a low temperature\nmagnetic order that matches the predicted phase proximate to the QSL. We also\nshow that stacking faults, inherent to the highly 2D nature of the material,\nreadily explain some puzzling results to date. Measurements of the dynamical\nresponse functions, especially at energies and temperatures above that where\ninterlayer effects are manifest, are naturally accounted for in terms of\ndeconfinement physics expected for QSLs. Via a comparison to the recently\ncalculated dynamics from gauge flux excitations and Majorana fermions of the\npure Kitaev model we propose {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ as the prime candidate for\nexperimental realization of fractionalized Kitaev physics.\n", "  We propose a stochastic approach for the description of the time evolution of\nthe magnetization of nanomagnets, that interpolates between the\nLandau--Lifshitz--Gilbert and the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch approximations, by\nvarying the strength of the noise. In addition, we take into account the\nautocorrelation time of the noise and explore the consequences, when it is\nfinite, on the scale of the response of the magnetization, i.e. when it may be\ndescribed as colored, rather than white, noise and non-Markovian features\nbecome relevant. We close the hierarchy for the moments of the magnetization,\nby introducing a suitable truncation scheme, whose validity is tested by direct\nnumerical solution of the moment equations and compared to the average deduced\nfrom a numerical solution of the corresponding stochastic Langevin equation. In\nthis way we establish a general framework, that allows both coarse-graining\nsimulations and faster calculations beyond the truncation approximation used\nhere.\n", "  Spatial gaps correspond to the projection in position space of the gaps of a\nperiodic structure whose envelope varies spatially. They can be easily\ngenerated in cold atomic physics using finite-size optical lattice, and provide\na new kind of tunnel barriers which can be used as a versatile tool for quantum\ndevices. We present in detail different theoretical methods to quantitatively\ndescribe these systems, and show how they can be used to realize in one\ndimension matter wave Fabry-Perot cavities. We also provide experimental and\nnumerical results that demonstrate the interest of spatial gaps structures for\nphase space engineering. We then generalize the concept of spatial gaps in two\ndimensions and show that this enables to design multiply connected cavities\nwhich generate a quantum dot structure for atoms or allow to construct curved\nwave guides for matter waves. At last, we demonstrate that modulating in time\nthe amplitude of the periodic structure offers a wide variety of possible atom\nmanipulations including the control of the scattering of an incoming wave\npacket, the loading of cavities delimited by spatial gaps, their coupling by\nmultiphonon processes or the realization of a tunable source of atoms. This\nlarge range of possibilities offered by space and time engineering of optical\nlattices demonstrates the flexibility of such band gap structures for matter\nwave control, quantum simulators and atomtronics.\n", "  Let $K(\\gamma)$ be the weakly equilibrium Cantor type set introduced in [10].\nIt is proven that the monic orthogonal polynomials $Q_{2^s}$ with respect to\nthe equilibrium measure of $K(\\gamma)$ coincide with the Chebyshev polynomials\nof the set. Procedures are suggested to find $Q_{n}$ of all degrees and the\ncorresponding Jacobi parameters. It is shown that the sequence of the Widom\nfactors is bounded below.\n", "  We have investigated electronic transport in graphene nanoribbon devices with\nadditional bar-shaped extensions (\"wings\") at each side of the device. We find\nthat the Coulomb-blockade dominated transport found in conventional ribbons is\nstrongly modified by the presence of the extensions. States localized far away\nfrom the central ribbon contribute significantly to transport. We discuss these\nfindings within the picture of multiple coupled quantum dots. Finally, we\ncompare the experimental results with tight-binding simulations which reproduce\nthe experiment both qualitatively and quantitatively.\n", "  We study Josephson effect of $d$-wave superconductor (DS)/ferromagnet\ninsulator(FI)/DS junctions on a surface of topological insulator (TI). We\ncalculate Josephson current $I\\left(\\varphi \\right) $ for various orientations\nof the junctions where $\\varphi $ is the macroscopic phase difference between\ntwo DSs. In certain configurations, we find anomalous current-phase relation\n$I(\\varphi)=-I\\left( -\\varphi +\\pi \\right)$ with $2\\pi$ periodicity. In the\ncase where the first order Josephson coupling is absent without magnetization\nin FI, $I(\\varphi)$ can be proportional to $\\cos \\varphi$. The magnitude of the\nobtained Josephson current is enhanced due to the zero energy states on the\nedge of DS on TI. Even if we introduce an $s$-wave component of pair potential\nin DS, we can still expect the anomalous current-phase relation in asymmetric\nDS junctions with $I\\left( \\varphi =0\\right) \\neq 0$. This can be used to probe\nthe induced $d$-wave component of pair potential on TI surface in high-$T_{c}$\ncuperate/TI hybrid structures.\n", "  We present weak lensing constraints on the ellipticity of galaxy-scale matter\nhaloes and the galaxy-halo misalignment. Using data from the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), we measure the\nweighted-average ratio of the aligned projected ellipticity components of\ngalaxy matter haloes and their embedded galaxies, $f_\\mathrm{h}$, split by\ngalaxy type. We then compare our observations to measurements taken from the\nMillennium Simulation, assuming different models of galaxy-halo misalignment.\nUsing the Millennium Simulation we verify that the statistical estimator used\nremoves contamination from cosmic shear. We also detect an additional signal in\nthe simulation, which we interpret as the impact of intrinsic shape-shear\nalignments between the lenses and their large-scale structure environment.\nThese alignments are likely to have caused some of the previous observational\nconstraints on $f_\\mathrm{h}$ to be biased high. From CFHTLenS we find\n$f_\\mathrm{h}=-0.04 \\pm 0.25$ for early-type galaxies, which is consistent with\ncurrent models for the galaxy-halo misalignment predicting $f_\\mathrm{h}\\simeq\n0.20$. For late-type galaxies we measure $f_\\mathrm{h}=0.69_{-0.36}^{+0.37}$\nfrom CFHTLenS. This can be compared to the simulated results which yield\n$f_\\mathrm{h}\\simeq 0.02$ for misaligned late-type models.\n", "  During cell migration, cells become polarized, change their shape, and move\nin response to various internal and external cues. Cell polarization is defined\nthrough the spatio-temporal organization of molecules such as PI3K or small\nGTPases, and is determined by intracellular signaling networks. It results in\ndirectional forces through actin polymerization and myosin contractions. Many\nexisting mathematical models of cell polarization are formulated in terms of\nreaction-diffusion systems of interacting molecules, and are often defined in\none or two spatial dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a 3D\nreaction-diffusion model of interacting molecules in a single cell, and find\nthat cell geometry has an important role affecting the capability of a cell to\npolarize, or change polarization when an external signal changes direction. Our\nresults suggest a geometrical argument why more roundish cells can repolarize\nmore effectively than cells which are elongated along the direction of the\noriginal stimulus, and thus enable roundish cells to turn faster, as has been\nobserved in experiments. On the other hand, elongated cells preferentially\npolarize along their main axis even when a gradient stimulus appears from\nanother direction. Furthermore, our 3D model can accurately capture the effect\nof binding and unbinding of important regulators of cell polarization to and\nfrom the cell membrane. This spatial separation of membrane and cytosol, not\npossible to capture in 1D or 2D models, leads to marked differences of our\nmodel from comparable lower-dimensional models.\n", "  We study spreading on networks where the contact dynamics between the nodes\nis governed by a random process and where the inter-contact time distribution\nmay differ from the exponential. We consider a process of imperfect spreading,\nwhere transmission is successful with a determined probability at each contact.\nWe first derive an expression for the inter-success time distribution,\ndetermining the speed of the propagation, and then focus on a problem related\nto epidemic spreading, by estimating the epidemic threshold in a system where\nnodes remain infectious during a finite, random period of time. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications of our work to design an efficient strategy to enhance\nspreading on temporal networks.\n", "  Consistency of the unconventional view of de Sitter space as a quantum theory\nof gravity with a finite number of degrees of freedom requires that Coleman-De\nLuccia tunneling rates to vacua with negative cosmological constant should be\ninterpreted as recurrences to low-entropy states. This demand translates into\ntwo constraints, or consistency conditions, on the scalar potential which are\ngenerically: 1) the distance in field space between the de Sitter vacuum and\nany other vacuum with negative cosmological constant must be of the order of\nthe reduced Planck mass or larger and 2) the fourth root of the vacuum energy\ndensity of the de Sitter vacuum must be smaller than the fourth root of the\ntypical scale of the scalar potential. These consistency conditions shed a\ndifferent light on both outstanding hierarchy problems of the Standard Model of\nparticle physics: the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale of\nthe cosmological constant. Beyond the unconventional interpretation of quantum\nde Sitter space, we complete the analytic understanding of the thin-wall\napproximation of Coleman-De Luccia tunneling, extend its numerical analysis to\ngeneric potentials and discuss the role of gravity in stabilizing the Standard\nModel potential.\n", "  We report joint Lagrangian velocity and temperature measurements in turbulent\nthermal convection. Measurements are performed using an improved version\n(extended autonomy) of the neutrally-buoyant instrumented particle that was\nused by to performed experiments in a parallelepipedic Rayleigh-Benard cell.\nThe temperature signal is obtained from a RFtransmitter. Simultaneously, we\ndetermine particle's position and velocity with one camera, which grants access\nto the Lagrangian heat flux. Due to the extended autonomy of the present\nparticle, we obtain well converged temperature and velocity statistics, as well\nas pseudo-eulerian maps of velocity and heat flux. Present experimental results\nhave also been compared with the results obtained by a corresponding campaign\nof Direct Numerical Simulations and Lagrangian Tracking of massless tracers.\nThe comparison between experimental and numerical results show the accuracy and\nreliability of our experimental measurements. Finally, the analysis of\nlagrangian velocity and temperature frequency spectra is shown and discussed.\nIn particular, we observe that temperature spectra exhibit an anomalous f^2.5\nfrequency scaling, likely representing the ubiquitous passive and active scalar\nbehavior of temperature\n", "  We study the bipartite entanglement per bond to determine characteristic\nfeatures of the phase diagram of various quantum spin models in different\nspatial dimensions. The bipartite entanglement is obtained from a tensor\nnetwork representation of the ground state wave-function. Three spin-1/2 models\n(Ising, XY, XXZ, all in a transverse field) are investigated. Imaginary-time\nevolution (TEBD in 1D, `simple update' in 2D and 3D) is used to determine the\nground states of these models. The phase structure of the models is discussed\nfor all three dimensions.\n", "  In this work we investigate the issue of integrability in a classical model\nfor noninteracting fermionic fields. This model is constructed via\nclassical-quantum correspondence obtained from the semiclassical treatment of\nthe quantum system. Our main finding is that the classical system, contrary to\nthe quantum system, is not integrablein general. Regarding this contrast it is\nclear that in general classical models for fermionic quantum systems have to be\nhandled with care. Further numerical investigation of the system showed that\nthere may be islands of stability in the phase space. We also investigated a\nsimilar model that is used in theoretical chemistry and found this one to be\nmost probably integrable, although also here the integrability is not assured\nby the quantum-classical correspondence principle.\n", "  We report on the formation of the high-energy empty-state resonance in the\nelectronic spectrum of the iron adatom on the Pt(111) surface. By using the\ncombination of the first-principles methods and the finite-temperature exact\ndiagonalization approach, we show that the resonance is the result of the\nvalence fluctuations between atomic configurations of the impurity. Our\ntheoretical finding is fully confirmed by the results of the scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy measurements [M.F. Crommie et al., Phys. Rev. B 48, 2851 (1993)]. In\ncontrast to the previous theoretical results obtained by using local spin\ndensity approximation, the paramagnetic state of the impurity in the experiment\nis naturally reproduced within our approach. This opens a new way for\ninterpretation of STM data collected earlier for metallic surface nanosystems\nwith iron impurities.\n", "  We construct a theory in which the gravitational interaction is described\nonly by torsion, but that generalizes the Teleparallel Theory still keeping the\ninvariance of local Lorentz transformations in one particular case. We show\nthat our theory falls, to a certain limit of a real parameter, in the\n$f(\\bar{R})$ Gravity or, to another limit of the same real parameter, in a\nmodified $f(T)$ Gravity, interpolating between these two theories and still can\nfall on several other theories. We explicitly show the equivalence with\n$f(\\bar{R})$ Gravity for cases of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker flat\nmetric for diagonal tetrads, and a metric with spherical symmetry for diagonal\nand non-diagonal tetrads. We do still four applications, one in the\nreconstruction of the de Sitter universe cosmological model, for obtaining a\nstatic spherically symmetric solution type-de Sitter for a perfect fluid, for\nevolution of the state parameter $\\omega_{DE}$ and for the thermodynamics to\nthe apparent horizon.\n", "  We study the coexistence of strain- and charge-mediated magnetoelectric\ncoupling in a cobalt (0-7 nm) wedge on ferroelectric\n[Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$/Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$]$_{0.68}$-[PbTiO$_{3}$]$_{0.32}$ (011) using\nsurface-sensitive x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy at the Co\nL$_{3,2}$ edges. Three distinct electric field driven remanent magnetization\nstates can be set in the Co film at room temperature. Ab-initio density\nfunctional theory calculations unravel the relative contributions of both\nstrain and charge to the observed magnetic anisotropy changes illustrating\nmagnetoelectro-elastic coupling at artificial multiferroic interfaces.\n", "  The use of methods borrowed from statistics and physics to analyze written\ntexts has allowed the discovery of unprecedent patterns of human behavior and\ncognition by establishing links between models features and language structure.\nWhile current models have been useful to unveil patterns via analysis of\nsyntactical and semantical networks, only a few works have probed the relevance\nof investigating the structure arising from the relationship between relevant\nentities such as characters, locations and organizations. In this study, we\nrepresent entities appearing in the same context as a co-occurrence network,\nwhere links are established according to a null model based on random, shuffled\ntexts. Computational simulations performed in novels revealed that the proposed\nmodel displays interesting topological features, such as the small world\nfeature, characterized by high values of clustering coefficient. The\neffectiveness of our model was verified in a practical pattern recognition task\nin real networks. When compared with traditional word adjacency networks, our\nmodel displayed optimized results in identifying unknown references in texts.\nBecause the proposed representation plays a complementary role in\ncharacterizing unstructured documents via topological analysis of named\nentities, we believe that it could be useful to improve the characterization of\nwritten texts (and related systems), specially if combined with traditional\napproaches based on statistical and deeper paradigms.\n", "  We construct a general measure for detecting the quantum speedup in both\nclosed and open systems. The speed measure is based on the changing rate of the\nposition of quantum states on a manifold with appropriate monotone Riemannian\nmetrics. Any increase in speed is a clear signature of dynamical speedup. To\nclarify the mechanisms for quantum speedup, we first introduce the concept of\nlongitudinal and transverse types of speedup: the former stems from the time\nevolution process itself with fixed initial conditions, while the latter is a\nresult of adjusting initial conditions. We then apply the proposed measure to\nseveral typical closed and open quantum systems, illustrating that quantum\ncoherence (or entanglement) and the memory effect of the environment together\ncan become resources for longitudinally or transversely accelerating dynamical\nevolution under specific conditions and assumptions.\n", "  We study quantum cosmology with conformal matter comprising a perfect\nradiation fluid and a number of conformally coupled scalar fields. Focusing\ninitially on the collective coordinates (minisuperspace) associated with\nhomogeneous, isotropic backgrounds, we are able to perform the quantum gravity\npath integral exactly. The evolution describes a \"perfect bounce\", in which the\nUniverse passes smoothly through the singularity. We extend the analysis to\nspatially flat, anisotropic universes, treated exactly, and to generic\ninhomogeneous, anisotropic perturbations treated at linear and nonlinear order.\nThis picture provides a natural, unitary description of quantum mechanical\nevolution across a cosmological bounce. We provide evidence for a semiclassical\ndescription in which all fields pass \"around\" the cosmological singularity\nalong complex classical paths.\n", "  An asymptotic description of the formation of dispersive shock waves in\nsolutions to the generalized Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) equation is\nconjectured. The asymptotic description based on a multiscales expansion is\ngiven in terms of a special solution to an ordinary differential equation of\nthe Painleve' I hierarchy. Several examples are discussed numerically to\nprovide strong evidence for the validity of the conjecture.\n", "  Subwavelength resonators, ranging from single atoms to metallic\nnanoparticles, typically exhibit a narrow-bandwidth response to optical\nexcitations. We computationally design and experimentally synthesize tailored\ndistributions of silver nanodisks to extinguish light over broad and varied\nfrequency windows. We show that metallic nanodisks are two-to-ten-times more\nefficient in absorbing and scattering light than common structures, and can\napproach fundamental limits to broadband scattering for subwavelength\nparticles. We measure broadband extinction per volume that closely approaches\ntheoretical predictions over three representative visible-range wavelength\nwindows, confirming the high efficiency of nanodisks and demonstrating the\ncollective power of computational design and experimental precision for\ndeveloping new photonics technologies.\n", "  This paper reports a series of measurements that characterize the directional\ndependence of the scintillation response of crystalline anthracene to incident\nDT neutrons, DD neutrons, Cs-137 gamma rays, and, for the first time, cosmic\nray muons. The neutron measurements give the amplitude and pulse shape\ndependence on the proton recoil direction over one hemisphere of the crystal,\nconfirming and extending previous results in the literature. In similar\nmeasurements using incident gamma rays, no directional effect is evident, and\nany anisotropy with respect to the electron recoil direction is constrained to\nhave a magnitude of less than a tenth of that present in the proton recoil\nevents. Cosmic muons are measured at two directions, and no anisotropy is\nobserved. This set of observations indicates that high dE/dx is necessary for\nan anisotropy to be present for a given type of scintillation event, which in\nturn could be used to discriminate among different hypotheses for the\nunderlying causes of the anisotropy, which are not well understood.\n", "  The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information (EUR-QSI)\nfrom [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating\ntwo distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to\nmeasurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum\nuncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two\nincompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the \"uncertainty witness\"\nlower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An\ninsightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,\n210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the\npostulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative\nentropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish\na tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower\nbound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement.\nAs such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and\ncan be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement\ncauses. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum\nmechanics with the others mentioned above. We have experimentally tested our\ntheoretical predictions on the IBM Quantum Experience and find reasonable\nagreement between our predictions and experimental outcomes.\n", "  A stochastic approach for the description of the time evolution of the\nmagnetization of nanomagnets is proposed, that interpolates between the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch approximations, by\nvarying the strength of the noise. Its finite autocorrelation time, i.e. when\nit may be described as colored, rather than white, is, also, taken into account\nand the consequences, on the scale of the response of the magnetization are\ninvestigated. It is shown that the hierarchy for the moments of the\nmagnetization can be closed, by introducing a suitable truncation scheme, whose\nvalidity is tested by direct numerical solution of the moment equations and\ncompared to the averages obtained from a numerical solution of the\ncorresponding colored stochastic Langevin equation. This comparison is\nperformed on magnetic systems subject to both an external uniform magnetic\nfield and an internal one-site uniaxial anisotropy.\n", "  Statistical averaging theorems allow us to derive a set of equations for the\naveraged magnetization dynamics in the presence of colored (non-Markovian)\nnoise. The non-Markovian character of the noise is described by a finite\nauto-correlation time, tau, that can be identified with the finite response\ntime of the thermal bath to the system of interest. Hitherto, this model was\nonly tested for the case of weakly correlated noise (when tau is equivalent or\nsmaller than the integration timestep). In order to probe its validity for a\nbroader range of auto-correlation times, a non-Markovian integration model,\nbased on the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is presented.\nComparisons between the two models are discussed, and these provide evidence\nthat both formalisms remain equivalent, even for strongly correlated noise\n(i.e. tau much larger than the integration timestep).\n", "  We provide an introduction to the theory of Eisenstein series and automorphic\nforms on real simple Lie groups G, emphasising the role of representation\ntheory. It is useful to take a slightly wider view and define all objects over\nthe (rational) adeles A, thereby also paving the way for connections to number\ntheory, representation theory and the Langlands program. Most of the results we\npresent are already scattered throughout the mathematics literature but our\nexposition collects them together and is driven by examples. Many interesting\naspects of these functions are hidden in their Fourier coefficients with\nrespect to unipotent subgroups and a large part of our focus is to explain and\nderive general theorems on these Fourier expansions. Specifically, we give\ncomplete proofs of the Langlands constant term formula for Eisenstein series on\nadelic groups G(A) as well as the Casselman--Shalika formula for the p-adic\nspherical Whittaker function associated to unramified automorphic\nrepresentations of G(Q_p). In addition, we explain how the classical theory of\nHecke operators fits into the modern theory of automorphic representations of\nadelic groups, thereby providing a connection with some key elements in the\nLanglands program, such as the Langlands dual group LG and automorphic\nL-functions. Somewhat surprisingly, all these results have natural\ninterpretations as encoding physical effects in string theory. We therefore\nalso introduce some basic concepts of string theory, aimed toward\nmathematicians, emphasising the role of automorphic forms. In particular, we\nprovide a detailed treatment of supersymmetry constraints on string amplitudes\nwhich enforce differential equations of the same type that are satisfied by\nautomorphic forms. Our treatise concludes with a detailed list of interesting\nopen questions and pointers to additional topics which go beyond the scope of\nthis book.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of testing Einstein's general theory of\nrelativity (GR) and the standard cosmological model via the $E_{\\rm G}$\nstatistic using neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping. We generalise the\nFourier space estimator for $E_{\\rm G}$ to include HI as a biased tracer of\nmatter and forecast statistical errors using HI clustering and lensing surveys\nthat can be performed in the near future, in combination with ongoing and\nforthcoming optical galaxy and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys. We\nfind that fractional errors $< 1\\%$ in the $E_{\\rm G}$ measurement can be\nachieved in a number of cases and compare the ability of various survey\ncombinations to differentiate between GR and specific modified gravity models.\nMeasuring $E_{\\rm G}$ with intensity mapping and the Square Kilometre Array can\nprovide exquisite tests of gravity at cosmological scales.\n", "  We present a semiclassical approach to many-body quantum propagation in terms\nof coherent sums over quantum amplitudes associated with the solutions of\ncorresponding classical nonlinear wave equations. This approach adequately\ndescribes interference effects in the many-body space of interacting bosonic\nsystems.\n  The main quantity of interest, the transition amplitude between Fock states\nwhen the dynamics is driven by both single-particlecontributions and many-body\ninteractions of similar magnitude, is non-perturbatively constructed in the\nspirit of Gutzwiller's derivation of the van Vleck propagator from the path\nintegral representation of the time evolution operator, but lifted to the space\nof symmetrized many-body states. Effects beyond mean-field, here representing\nthe classical limit of the theory, are semiclassically described by means of\ninterfering amplitudes where the action and stability of the classical\nsolutions enter. In this way, a genuinely many-body echo phenomenon, coherent\nbackscattering in Fock space, is presented arising due to coherent quantum\ninterference between classical solutions related by time reversal.\n", "  Discoveries of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variable stars with multiple modes of\npulsation have increased tremendously in recent years. The Fourier spectra of\nthese stars can be quite complicated due to the large number of combination\nfrequencies that can exist between their modes. As a result, light-curve fits\nto these stars often suffer from undesirable ringing effects that arise from\nnoisy observations and poor phase coverage. These non-physical overfitting\nartifacts also occur when fitting the harmonics of single-mode stars as well.\nHere we present a new method for fitting light curves that is much more robust\nagainst these effects. We prove that the amplitude measurement problem is very\ndifficult (NP-hard) and provide a heuristic algorithm for solving it quickly\nand accurately.\n", "  We consider extending the Standard Model by including an additional Abelian\ngauge group broken at low energies under which the right-handed top quark is\nthe only effectively charged Standard Model fermion. The associated gauge boson\n$(Z')$ is then naturally top-philic and couples only to the rest of the SM\nparticle content at loop-level or via kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge\nboson which is assumed to be small. Working at the effective theory level, we\ndemonstrate that such a minimal extension allows for an improved fitting of the\n$\\sim 2\\sigma$ excess observed in $t\\bar{t}h$ searches at the LHC in a region\nof parameter space that satisfies existing collider constraints. We also\npresent the reach of the LHC at 13 TeV in constraining the relevant region of\nparameter space. Additionally we show that within the same framework a suitably\nchosen fermion charged only under the exotic Abelian group can, in the region\nof parameter space preferred by the $\\bar{t}th$ measurements, simultaneously\nexplain the dark matter relic density and the $\\gamma$-ray excess at the\ngalactic center observed by the Fermi-LAT experiment.\n", "  The metal organic framework (MOF) material UiO-66 has emerged as one of the\nmost promising MOF materials due to its thermal and chemical stability and its\npotential for catalytic applications. Typically, as-synthesised UiO-66 has a\nrelatively high concentration of missing linker defects. The presence of these\ndefects has been correlated with catalytic activity but characterisation of\ndefect structure has proved elusive. We refine a recent experimental\ndetermination of defect structure using static and dynamic first principles\napproaches, which reveals a dynamic and labile acid centre that could be\ntailored for functional applications in catalysis.\n", "  We discuss the properties of atom-photon bound states in waveguide QED\nsystems consisting of single or multiple atoms coupled strongly to a\nfinite-bandwidth photonic channel. Such bound states are formed by an atom and\na localized photonic excitation and represent the continuum analog of the\nfamiliar dressed states in single-mode cavity QED. Here we present a detailed\nanalysis of the linear and nonlinear spectral features associated with single-\nand multi-photon dressed states and show how the formation of bound states\naffects the waveguide-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between separated\natoms. Our results provide a both qualitative and quantitative description of\nthe essential strong-coupling processes in waveguide QED systems, which are\ncurrently being developed in the optical and the microwave regime.\n", "  Interferometric measurements with matter waves are established techniques for\nsensitive gravimetry, rotation sensing, and measurement of surface\ninteractions, but compact interferometers will require techniques based on\ntrapped geometries. In a step towards the realization of matter wave\ninterferometers in toroidal geometries, we produce a large, smooth ring trap\nfor Bose-Einstein condensates using rapidly scanned time-averaged dipole\npotentials. The trap potential is smoothed by using the atom distribution as\ninput to an optical intensity correction algorithm. Smooth rings with a\ndiameter up to 300 $\\mu$m are demonstrated. We experimentally observe and\nsimulate the dispersion of condensed atoms in the resulting potential, with\ngood agreement serving as an indication of trap smoothness. Under time of\nflight expansion we observe low energy excitations in the ring, which serves to\nconstrain the lower frequency limit of the scanned potential technique. The\nresulting ring potential will have applications as a waveguide for atom\ninterferometry and studies of superfluidity.\n", "  This is a comment on a paper by Gromov and Abanov [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,\n016802 (2015)]. We will show that there is an inconsistency which renders the\nresults untenable.\n", "  New results of the NA61/SHINE Collaboration at the CERN SPS on mean hadron\nmultiplicities in proton-proton (p+p) interactions are analyzed within the\ntransport models and the hadron resonance gas (HRG) statistical model. The\nchemical freeze-out parameters in p+p interactions and central Pb+Pb (or Au+Au)\ncollisions are found and compared with each other in the range of the center of\nmass energy of the nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.2-17.3$ GeV. The canonical\nensemble formulation of the HRG model is used to describe mean hadron\nmultiplicities in p+p interactions and the grand canonical ensemble in central\nPb+Pb and Au+Au collisions. The chemical freeze-out temperatures in p+p\ninteractions are found to be larger than the corresponding temperatures in\ncentral nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n", "  The vector and axial-vector ALEPH hadronic spectral functions from\n$\\tau$-decay are used to probe potential quark-hadron duality violations (DV).\nThis is done in the framework of finite energy QCD sum rules (FESR). A pinched\nintegration kernel is introduced in the FESR in order to (a) quench potential\nduality violations on the real axis in the complex squared energy $s$-plane,\nand (b) effectively extend the analysis well beyond the kinematical\n$\\tau$-decay end-point where there is no longer data, i.e.\\ in the range $s = 3\n- 10 \\,{\\mbox{GeV}}^2$. In the vector channel this procedure is supplemented\nwith actual data from $e^+ e^-$-annihilation into hadrons, above the tau-decay\nkinematical end-point, with results fully supporting this extension. Very good\nagreement is obtained between data and two specific pinched FESR. Results from\nthis analysis are confronted with those from a specific model of DV. As the sum\nrules are well satisfied in both cases within experimental errors, we conclude\nthat possible DV must be buried under the experimental uncertainties. In other\nwords, there seems to be no need for explicit models of DV in this case.\nPinched kernels work as well, but with far less free parameters.\n", "  A fast and furnace-free method of combustion synthesis is employed for the\nfirst time to synthesize iron-based superconductors. Using this method,\nFe1.1Se1-xTex (0<=x<=1) samples can be prepared from self-sustained reactions\nof element powders in only tens of seconds. The obtained Fe1.1Se1-xTex samples\nshow clear zero resistivity and corresponding magnetic susceptibility drop at\naround 10-14 K. The Fe1.1Se0.33Te0.67 sample shows the highest onset Tc of\nabout 14 K, and its upper critical field is estimated to be approximately 54 T.\nCompared with conventional solid state reaction for preparing polycrystalline\nFeSe samples, combustion synthesis exhibits much-reduced time and energy\nconsumption, but offers comparable superconducting properties. It is expected\nthat the combustion synthesis method is available for preparing plenty of\niron-based superconductors, and in this direction further related work is in\nprogress.\n", "  We construct exact solutions of BPS pion domain walls in the four-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric SU(N) chiral Lagrangian with pion masses\nintroduced via linear and quadratic superpotentials. The model admits N\ndiscrete vacua in the center of SU(N) for the linear superpotential. In\naddition to the latter, new vacua appear for the quadratic superpotential. We\nfind that the domain wall solutions of pions (Nambu-Goldstone bosons) that\ninterpolate between a pair of (pion) vacua preserve half of supersymmetry.\nContrary to our expectations, we have not been able to find domain walls\ninvolving the quasi-Nambu-Goldstone bosons present in the theory, which in turn\nhas the consequence that not all vacua of the theory are connected by a BPS\ndomain wall solution.\n", "  The next generation of atomic frequency standards based on an ensemble of\nneutral atoms or a single-ion will provide very stringent tests in metrology,\napplied and fundamental physics requiring a new step in very precise control of\nexternal systematic corrections. In the proceedings of the 8th Symposium on\nFrequency Standards and Metrology, we present a generalization of the recent\nHyper-Ramsey spectroscopy with separated oscillating fields using composites\npulses in order to suppress field frequency shifts induced by the interrogation\nlaser itself. Sequences of laser pulses including specific selection of phases,\nfrequency detunings and durations are elaborated to generate spectroscopic\nsignals with a strong reduction of the light-shift perturbation by off resonant\nstates. New optical clocks based on weakly allowed or completely forbidden\ntransitions in atoms, ions, molecules and nuclei will benefit from these\ngeneralized Ramsey schemes to reach relative accuracies well below the\n10$^{-18}$ level.\n", "  Our aim is to unveil how resonances of parametric systems are affected when\nsymmetry is broken. We showed numerically and experimentally that odd\nresonances indeed come about when the pendulum is excited along a tilted\ndirection. Applying the Melnikov subharmonic function, we not only determined\nanalytically the loci of saddle-node bifurcations delimiting resonance regions\nin parameter space, but also explained these observations by demonstrating\nthat, under the Melnikov method point of view, odd resonances arise due to an\nextra torque that appears in the asymmetric case.\n", "  We present several criteria for genuine multipartite entanglement from\nuniversal uncertainty relations based on majorization theory. Under\nnon-negative Schur-concave functions, the vector-type uncertainty relation\ngenerates a family of infinitely many detectors to check genuine multipartite\nentanglement. We also introduce the concept of $k$-separable circles via\ngeometric distance for probability vectors, which include at most\n$(k-1)$-separable states. The entanglement witness is also generalized to a\nuniversal entanglement witness which is able to detect the $k$-separable states\nmore accurately.\n", "  We use a description based on differential forms to systematically explore\nthe space of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Within this formalism, we\npropose a basis for the scalar sector at the lowest order in derivatives of the\nfield and in any number of dimensions. This minimal basis is used to construct\na finite and closed set of Lagrangians describing general scalar-tensor\ntheories invariant under Local Lorentz Transformations in a pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold, which contains ten physically distinct elements in four spacetime\ndimensions. Subsequently, we compute their corresponding equations of motion\nand find which combinations are at most second order in derivatives in four as\nwell as arbitrary number of dimensions. By studying the possible exact forms\n(total derivatives) and algebraic relations between the basis components, we\ndiscover that there are only four Lagrangian combinations producing second\norder equations, which can be associated with Horndeski's theory. In this\nprocess, we identify a new second order Lagrangian, named kinetic Gauss-Bonnet,\nthat was not previously considered in the literature. However, we show that its\ndynamics is already contained in Horndeski's theory. Finally, we provide a full\nclassification of the relations between different second order theories. This\nallows us to clarify, for instance, the connection between different\ncovariantizations of Galileons theory. In conclusion, our formulation affords\ngreat computational simplicity with a systematic structure. As a first step we\nfocus on theories with second order equations of motion. However, this new\nformalism aims to facilitate advances towards unveiling the most general\nscalar-tensor theories.\n", "  We develop a simulational methodology allowing for simulation of the\npressure-driven flow in the pore with flat and polymer-modified walls. Our\napproach is based on dissipative particle dynamics and we combine earlier ideas\nof fluid-like walls and reverse flow. As a test case we consider the oligomer\nflow through the pore with flat walls and demonstrate good thermostatting\nqualities of the proposed method. We found the inhomogeneities in both oligomer\nshape and alignment across the pore leading to a non-parabolic velocity\nprofiles. The method is subsequently applied to a nano-channel decorated with a\npolymer brush stripes arranged perpendicularly to the flow direction. At\ncertain threshold value of a flow force we find a pillar-to-lamellar\nmorphological transition, which leads to the brush enveloping the pore wall by\na relatively smooth layer. At higher flow rates, the flow of oligomer has\nsimilar properties as in the case of flat walls, but for the narrower effective\npore size. We observe stretching and aligning of the polymer molecules along\nthe flow near the pore walls.\n", "  Amplitudes derived from scattering data on elementary targets are basic\ninputs to neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions. A prominent example is\nthe isovector axial nucleon form factor, $F_A(q^2)$, which controls charged\ncurrent signal processes at accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments.\nPrevious extractions of $F_A$ from neutrino-deuteron scattering data rely on a\ndipole shape assumption that introduces an unquantified error. A new analysis\nof world data for neutrino-deuteron scattering is performed using a\nmodel-independent, and systematically improvable, representation of $F_A$. A\ncomplete error budget for the nucleon isovector axial radius leads to\n$r_A^2=0.46(22) \\,{\\rm fm}^2$, with a much larger uncertainty than determined\nin the original analyses. The quasielastic neutrino-neutron cross section is\ndetermined as $\\sigma(\\nu_\\mu n \\to \\mu^- p)\\big|_{E_\\nu =1\\,{\\rm GeV}} =\n10.1(0.9) \\times 10^{-39}{\\rm cm}^2$. The propagation of nucleon-level\nconstraints and uncertainties to nuclear cross sections is illustrated using\nMINERvA data and the GENIE event generator. These techniques can be readily\nextended to other amplitudes and processes.\n", "  We use the voltage biased tip of a scanning force microscope at a temperature\nof 35\\,mK to locally induce the fractional quantum Hall state of $\\nu=1/3$ in a\nsplit-gate defined constriction. Different tip positions allow us to vary the\npotential landscape. From temperature dependence of the conductance plateau at\n$G=1/3 \\times e^2/h$ we determine the activation energy of this local $\\nu=1/3$\nstate. We find that at a magnetic field of 6\\,T the activation energy is\nbetween 153\\,$\\mu$eV and 194\\,$\\mu$eV independent of the shape of the confining\npotential, but about 50\\% lower than for bulk samples.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the time required for a wave packet to tunnel\nthrough the potential barriers of an optical lattice. The experiment is carried\nout by loading adiabatically a Bose-Einstein condensate into a 1D optical\nlattice. A sudden displacement of the lattice by a few tens of nm excites the\nmicromotion of the dipole mode. We then directly observe in momentum space the\nsplitting of the wave packet at the turning points and measure the delay\nbetween the reflected and the tunneled packets for various initial\ndisplacements. Using this atomic beam splitter twice, we realize a chain of\ncoherent micron-size Mach-Zehnder interferometers at the exit of which we get\nessentially a wave packet with a negative momentum, a result opposite to the\nprediction of classical physics.\n", "  A number of results on quantum quenches in the Luttinger and related models\nare surveyed with emphasis on post-quench correlations. For the Luttinger model\nand initial gaussian states, we discuss both sudden and smooth quenches of the\ninteraction and the emergence of a steady state described by a generalized\nGibbs ensemble. Comparisons between analytics and numerics, and the question of\nuniversality or lack thereof are also discussed. The relevance of the\ntheoretical results to current and future experiments in the fields of\nultracold atomic gases and mesoscopic systems of electrons is also briefly\ntouched upon. Wherever possible, our approach is pedagogical and\nself-contained. This work is dedicated to the memory of our colleague Alejandro\nMuramatsu.\n", "  (Abridged) We derive an analytical formula which provides estimates on\nmultiscale gravitational energy distribution using the observed surface density\nPDF. Our analytical formalism also enables one to convert the observed column\ndensity PDF into an estimated volume density PDF, and to obtain average radial\ndensity profile $\\rho(r)$. For a region with $N_{\\rm col} \\sim N^{-\\gamma_{\\rm\nN}}$, the gravitational energy spectra is $E_{\\rm p}(k)\\sim k^{-4(1 -\n1/\\gamma_{\\rm N})}$. We apply the formula to observations of molecular clouds,\nand find that a scaling index of $-2$ of the surface density PDF implies that\n$\\rho \\sim r^{-2}$ and $E_{\\rm p}(k) \\sim k^{-2}$. The results are valid from\nthe cloud scale (a few parsec) to around $\\sim 0.1 \\;\\rm pc$. Because of the\nresemblance the scaling index of the gravitational energy spectrum and the that\nof the kinetic energy power spectrum of the Burgers turbulence (where $E\\sim\nk^{-2}$), our result indicates that gravity can act effectively against\nturbulence over a multitude of physical scales. This is the critical scaling\nindex which divides molecular clouds into two categories: clouds like Orion and\nOphiuchus have shallower power laws, and the amount of gravitational energy is\ntoo large for turbulence to be effective inside the cloud. Because gravity\ndominates, we call this type of cloud g-type clouds. On the other hand, clouds\nlike the California molecular cloud and the Pipe nebula have steeper power\nlaws, and turbulence can overcome gravity if it can cascade effectively from\nthe large scale. We call this type of cloud t-type clouds. The analytical\nformula can be used to determine if gravity is dominating cloud evolution when\nthe column density probability distribution function (PDF) can be reliably\ndetermined.\n", "  This paper presents a connection between the topological properties of\nhardcore bosons and that of magnons in quantum spin magnets. We utilize the\nHaldane-like hardcore bosons on the honeycomb lattice as an example. We show\nthat this system maps to a spin-$1/2$ quantum XY model with a\nnext-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction. We obtain the magnon\nexcitations of the quantum spin model and compute the edge states, Berry\ncurvature, thermal and spin Nernst conductivities. Due to the mapping from spin\nvariables to bosons, the hardcore bosons possess the same nontrivial\ntopological properties as those in quantum spin system. These results are\nimportant in the study of magnetic excitations in quantum magnets and they are\nalso useful for understanding the control of ultracold bosonic quantum gases in\nhoneycomb optical lattices, which is experimentally accessible.\n", "  We review the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems after a\nquantum quench with spatial inhomogeneities, either in the Hamiltonian or in\nthe initial state. We focus on integrable and many-body localized systems that\nfail to self-thermalize in isolation and for which the standard hydrodynamical\npicture breaks down. The emphasis is on universal dynamics, non-equilibrium\nsteady states and new dynamical phases of matter, and on phase transitions far\nfrom thermal equilibrium. We describe how the infinite number of conservation\nlaws of integrable and many-body localized systems lead to complex\nnon-equilibrium states beyond the traditional dogma of statistical mechanics.\n", "  We study multiple-period Bloch states of a Bose-Einstein condensate with\nspatially periodic interactomic interaction. Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation for the continuum model, and also using a simplified discrete version\nof it, we investigate the energy-band structures and the corresponding\nstability properties. We observe a new \"attraction-induced dynamical stability\"\nmechanism caused by the localization of the density distribution in the\nattractive domains of the system and the isolation of these higher-density\nregions. This makes the superfluid stable near the zone boundary, and also\nenhances the stability of higher-periodic states if the nonlinear interaction\nstrength is sufficiently high.\n", "  We show that the 750 GeV di-photon excess could be explained by the\n${\\mathcal Q}-$onium system of a new QCD-like theory with fermions vectorial\nunder the SM. Beside the spin-0 di-photon singlet this scenario predicts almost\ndegenerate colored scalars and spin-1 resonances analogous to the $J/\\Psi$ in\nQCD. All these states are within the reach of the LHC. An apparent large width\ncan be explained as due to production of excited states with splitting $\\Delta\nm\\sim \\Gamma$.\n", "  In this paper, we give a brief review of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM) and \"$\\mu$ from $\\nu$\" Supersymmetric Standard Model ($\\mu\n\\nu$SSM). Then we propose a generalization of $\\mu \\nu$SSM in order to explain\nthe recent ATLAS, CMS and LHCb results. This \"new\" $\\mu \\nu$SSM generalizes the\nsuperpotential $W_{suppot}$ of $\\mu \\nu$SSM by including two terms that\ngenerate a mixing among leptons, gauginos and higgsinos while keeping the\ncharginos and neutralinos masses unchanged. Also, it is potentially interesting\nfor cosmological applications as it displays flat directions of the\nsuperpotential and a viable leptogenesis mechanism.\n", "  Topological Kondo insulator SmB6 has attracted quite a lot of attentions from\ncondensed matter physics community. A number of unique electronic properties,\nincluding low- temperature resistivity anomaly, 1D electronic transport and 2D\nFermi surfaces have been observed in SmB6. Here, we report on thermoelectric\ntransport properties of polycrystalline SmB6 over a broad temperature from 300\nK to 2 K. An anomalous transition in the temperature-dependent Seebeck\ncoefficient S from S(T) ~ T-1 to S(T) ~ T was observed around 12 K. Such a\ntransition demonstrates a transition of conductivity from 3D metallic bulk\nstates to 2D metallic surface states with insulating bulk states. Our results\nsuggest that the thermotransport measurements could be used for the\ncharacterization of state transition in topological insulators.\n", "  We study dynamics of fermions loaded in an optical lattice with a\nsuperimposed parabolic trap potential. In the recent Hamburg experiments\n[J.Heinze et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 085302 (2013)] on quantum simulation of\nphotoconductivity, a modulation pulse on the optical lattice transferred part\nof the population of the lowest band to an excited band, leaving a hole in the\nparticle distribution of the lowest band. Subsequent intricate dynamics of both\nexcited particles and holes can be explained by a semiclassical approach based\non the evolution of Wigner function. Here we provide a more detailed analysis\nof the dynamics taking into account the dimensionality of the system and finite\ntemperature effects, aiming at reproducing experimental results on longer\ntimescales. A semiclassical wave packet is constructed more accurately than in\nthe previous theory. As a result, semiclassical dynamics indeed reproduces\nexperimental data and full quantum numerical calculations with much better\naccuracy. In particular, fascinating phenomenon of collapse and revival of\nholes is investigated in a more detail. We presume the experimental setup can\nbe used for deeper exploration of nonlinear waves in fermionic gases.\n", "  Generalized fluid equations, using sound speed $c_{\\rm eff}^2$ and viscosity\n$c_{\\rm vis}^2$ as effective parameters, provide a convenient phenomenological\nformalism for testing the relic neutrino \"null hypothesis,\" i.e. that that\nneutrinos are relativistic and free-streaming prior to recombination. In this\nwork, we relax the relativistic assumption and ask \"to what extent can the\ngeneralized fluid equations accommodate finite neutrino mass?\" We consider both\nthe mass of active neutrinos, which are largely still relativistic at\nrecombination $m^2 / T^2 \\sim 0.2$, and the effect of a semi-relativistic\nsterile component. While there is no one-to-one mapping between mass/mixing\nparameters and $c_{\\rm eff}^2$ and $c_{\\rm vis}^2$, we demonstrate that the\nexistence of a neutrino mass could induce a bias to measurements of $c_{\\rm\neff}^2$ and $c_{\\rm vis}^2$ at the level of $0.01 m^2 / T^2 \\sim 10^{-3}$.\n", "  We present a general theory for designing realistic omega-type bianisotropic\nmetasurfaces (O-BMSs), unlocking their full potential for molding\nelectromagnetic fields. These metasurfaces, characterized by electric surface\nimpedance, magnetic surface admittance, and magnetoelectric coupling\ncoefficient, were previously considered for wavefront manipulation. However,\nprevious reports mainly considered plane-wave excitations, and implementations\nincluded cumbersome metallic features. In this work, we prove that any field\ntransformation which locally conserves real power can be implemented via\npassive and lossless meta-atoms characterized by closed-form expressions; this\nallows rigorous incorporation of arbitrary source and scattering\nconfigurations. Subsequently, we show that O-BMS meta-atoms can be implemented\nusing an asymmetric stack of three impedance sheets, an appealing structure for\nprinted circuit board fabrication. Our formulation reveals that, as opposed to\nHuygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), which exhibit negligible magnetoelectric\ncoupling, O-BMSs are not limited to controlling the phase of transmitted\nfields, but can rather achieve high level of control over the amplitude and\nphase of reflected fields. This is demonstrated by designing O-BMSs for\nreflectionless wide-angle refraction, independent surface-wave guiding, and a\nhighly-directive low-profile antenna, verified with full-wave simulations. This\nstraightforward methodology facilitates development of O-BMS-based devices for\ncontrolling the near and far fields of arbitrary sources in complex scattering\nconfigurations.\n", "  Although there is always an interplay between the dynamics of information\ndiffusion and disease spreading, the empirical research on the systemic\ncoevolution mechanisms connecting these two spreading dynamics is still\nlacking. Here we investigate the coevolution mechanisms and dynamics between\ninformation and disease spreading by utilizing real data and a proposed\nspreading model on multiplex network. Our empirical analysis finds asymmetrical\ninteractions between the information and disease spreading dynamics. Our\nresults obtained from both the theoretical framework and extensive stochastic\nnumerical simulations suggest that an information outbreak can be triggered in\na communication network by its own spreading dynamics or by a disease outbreak\non a contact network, but that the disease threshold is not affected by\ninformation spreading. Our key finding is that there is an optimal information\ntransmission rate that markedly suppresses the disease spreading. We find that\nthe time evolution of the dynamics in the proposed model qualitatively agrees\nwith the real-world spreading processes at the optimal information transmission\nrate.\n", "  The problem of the timelike Pomeron coupling to light mesons and photons is\nconsidered in light of available data on high-energy meson-proton scattering.\nPossible correspondence of $f_2(1950)$ resonance to the ground state of the\nPomeron is argued.\n", "  According to the hydrodynamic Drude model, surface-plasmon resonances of\nmetallic nanostructures blueshift owing to the nonlocal response of the metal's\nelectron gas. The screening length characterising the nonlocal effect is often\nsmall relative to the overall dimensions of the metallic structure, which\nenables us to derive a coarse-grained nonlocal description using matched\nasymptotic expansions; a perturbation theory for the blueshifts of arbitrary\nshaped nanometallic structures is then developed. The effect of nonlocality is\nnot always a perturbation and we present a detailed analysis of the \"bonding\"\nmodes of a dimer of nearly touching nanowires where the leading-order\neigenfrequencies and eigenmode distributions are shown to be a renormalisation\nof those predicted assuming a local metal permittivity.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of string order in a spin-1 chain following a\nquantum quench. After initializing the chain in the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki\nstate, we analyze in detail how string order evolves as a function of time at\ndifferent length scales. The Hamiltonian after the quench is chosen either to\npreserve or to suddenly break the symmetry which ensures the presence of string\norder. Depending on which of these two situations arises, string order is\neither preserved or lost even at infinitesimal times in the thermodynamic\nlimit. The fact that non-local order may be abruptly destroyed, what we call\nstring-order melting, makes it qualitatively different from typical order\nparameters in the manner of Landau. This situation is thoroughly characterized\nby means of numerical simulations based on matrix product states algorithms and\nanalytical studies based on a short-time expansion for several simplified\nmodels.\n", "  We give the global homotopy classification of nematic textures for a general\ndomain with weak anchoring boundary conditions and arbitrary defect set in\nterms of twisted cohomology, and give an explicit computation for the case of\nknotted and linked defects in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, showing that the distinct\nhomotopy classes have a 1-1 correspondence with the first homology group of the\nbranched double cover, branched over the disclination loops. We show further\nthat the subset of those classes corresponding to elements of order 2 in this\ngroup have representatives that are planar and characterise the obstruction for\nother classes in terms of merons. The planar textures are a feature of the\nglobal defect topology that is not reflected in any local characterisation.\nFinally, we describe how the global classification relates to recent\nexperiments on nematic droplets and how elements of order 4 relate to the\npresence of $\\tau$ lines in cholesterics.\n", "  We study the interplay of topological band structure and conventional\nmagnetic long-range order in spinful Haldane model with onsite repulsive\ninteraction. Using the dynamical cluster approximation with clusters of up to\n24 sites we find evidence of a first order phase transition from a Chern\ninsulator at weak coupling to a topologically trivial antiferromagnetic\ninsulator at strong coupling. These results call into question a previously\nfound intermediate state with coexisting topological character and\nantiferromagnetic long-range order. Experimentally measurable signatures of the\nfirst order transition include hysteretic behavior of the double occupancy,\nsingle-particle excitation gap and nearest neighbor spin-spin correlations.\nThis first order transition is contrasted with a continuous phase transition\nfrom the conventional band insulator to the antiferromagnetic insulator in the\nionic Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice.\n", "  This paper presents a search for massive charged long-lived particles\nproduced in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at the LHC using the ATLAS\nexperiment. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$. Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of\nmassive charged long-lived particles, such as $R$-hadrons. These massive\nparticles are expected to be produced with a velocity significantly below the\nspeed of light, and therefore to have a specific ionization higher than any\nStandard Model particle of unit charge at high momenta. The Pixel subsystem of\nthe ATLAS detector is used to measure the ionization energy loss of\nreconstructed charged particles and to search for such highly ionizing\nparticles. The search presented here has much greater sensitivity than a\nsimilar search performed using the ATLAS detector in the $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV\ndataset, thanks to the increase in expected signal cross-section due to the\nhigher center-of-mass energy of collisions, to an upgraded detector with a new\nsilicon layer close to the interaction point, and to analysis improvements. No\nsignificant deviation from Standard Model background expectations is observed,\nand lifetime-dependent upper limits on $R$-hadron production cross-sections and\nmasses are set. Gluino $R$-hadrons with lifetimes above 0.4 ns and decaying to\n$q\\bar{q}$ plus a 100 GeV neutralino are excluded at the 95% confidence level,\nwith lower mass limit ranging between 740 GeV and 1590 GeV. In the case of\nstable $R$-hadrons the lower mass limit at the 95% confidence level is 1570\nGeV.\n", "  When a strongly correlated quantum dot is tunnel-coupled to a superconductor,\nit leads to the formation of Shiba bound states inside the superconducting gap.\nThey have been measured experimentally in a superconductor-quantum dot-normal\nlead setup. Side coupling the quantum dot to a topological superconducting wire\nthat supports Majorana bound states at its ends, drastically affects the\nstructure of the Shiba states and induces supplementary in-gap states. The\nanomalous coupling between the Majorana bound states and the quantum dot gives\nrise to a characteristic imbalance in the spin resolved spectral functions for\nthe dot operators. These are clear fingerprints for the existence of Majorana\nfermions and they can be detected experimentally in transport measurements. In\nterms of methods employed, we have used analytical approaches combined with the\nnumerical renormalization group approach.\n", "  Indirect reciprocity is one of the major mechanisms of the evolution of\ncooperation. Because constant monitoring and accurate evaluation in moral\nassessments tend to be costly, indirect reciprocity can be exploited by cost\nevaders. A recent study crucially showed that a cooperative state achieved by\nindirect reciprocators is easily destabilized by cost evaders in the case with\nno supportive mechanism. Here, we present a simple and widely applicable\nsolution that considers pre-assessment of cost evaders. In the pre-assessment,\nthose who fail to pay for costly assessment systems are assigned a nasty image\nthat leads to being rejected by discriminators. We demonstrate that considering\nthe pre-assessment can crucially stabilize reciprocal cooperation for a broad\nrange of indirect reciprocity models. In particular for the most leading social\nnorms we analyse the conditions under which a prosocial state becomes locally\nstable.\n", "  We consider epidemic extinction in finite networks with broad variation in\nlocal connectivity. Generalizing the theory of large fluctuations to random\nnetworks with a given degree distribution, we are able to predict the most\nprobable, or optimal, paths to extinction in various configurations, including\ntruncated power-laws. We find that paths for heterogeneous networks follow a\nlimiting form in which infection first decreases in low-degree nodes, which\ntriggers a rapid extinction in high- degree nodes, and finishes with a residual\nlow-degree extinction. The usefulness of the approach is further demonstrated\nthrough optimal control strategies that leverage finite-size fluctuations.\nInterestingly, we find that the optimal control is a mix of treating both high\nand low-degree nodes based on large-fluctuation theoretical predictions.\n", "  In this paper I will combine and use two Cardy-Jacobsen and Yaffe-Svetitsky\nconjectures \\cite{c.1,c.2} to present a mechanism for a late-time inflation\nduring the electroweak symmetry breaking due to discrete $Z_3$ symmetry at\n$\\textit{O} (10)^2$ GeV and a psudo-inflation at $\\textit{O}(10)^2$ MeV scale\nin order to solve the cosmological domain wall problem as well as thermal and\nnon-thermal relics overproduction in the early universe. We will see that\nCardy-Jacobsen conjecture and Zel'dovic statement for cosmological domain wall\nproblem are incompatible. Also, in the psudo-inflation mechanism presented here\nthere would be a latent heat release and entropy injection without an\nexponential expansion and reheating period.\n", "  Due to the fact that the numbers of annually published papers have witnessed\na linear growth in some citation networks, a geometric model is thus proposed\nto predict some statistical features of those networks, in which the academic\ninfluence scopes of the papers are denoted through specific geometric areas\nrelated to time and space. In the model, nodes (papers) are uniformly and\nrandomly sprinkled onto a cluster of circles of the Minkowski space whose\ncenters are on the time axis. Edges (citations) are linked according to an\ninfluence mechanism which indicates that an existing paper will be cited by a\nnew paper located in its influence zone. Considering the citations among papers\nin different disciplines, an interdisciplinary citation mechanism is added to\nthe model in which some papers with a small probability of being chosen will\ncite some existing papers randomly and uniformly. Different from most existing\nmodels that only study the power-law tail of the in-degree distribution, this\nmodel also characterizes the overall in-degree distribution. Moreover, it\npresents the description of some other important statistical characteristics of\nreal networks, such as in- and out-assortativity, giant component and clear\ncommunity structure. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that a good example\nis provided in the paper to study real networks by geometric graphs.\n", "  In this work, the normal modes of a two-dimensional oscillating system have\nbeen studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view. The normal\nfrequencies predicted by the Hessian matrix for a coupled two-dimensional\nparticle system are compared to those obtained for a real system consisting of\ntwo oscillating smartphones coupled one to the other by springs. Experiments\nare performed on an air table in order to remove the friction forces. The\noscillation data are captured by the acceleration sensor of the smartphones and\nexported to file for further analysis. The experimental frequencies compare\nreasonably well with the theoretical predictions, namely, within 1.7 % of\ndiscrepancy.\n", "  Recently the CHY approach has been extended to one loop level using elliptic\nfunctions and modular forms over a Jacobian variety. Due to the difficulty in\nmanipulating these kind of functions, we propose an alternative prescription\nthat is totally algebraic. This new proposal is based on an elliptic algebraic\ncurve embedded in a $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ space. We show that for the simplest\nintegrand, namely the ${\\rm n-gon}$, our proposal indeed reproduces the\nexpected result. By using the recently formulated $\\Lambda-$algorithm, we found\na novel recurrence relation expansion in terms of tree level off-shell\namplitudes. Our results connect nicely with recent results on the one-loop\nformulation of the scattering equations. In addition, this new proposal can be\neasily stretched out to hyperelliptic curves in order to compute higher genus.\n", "  Point island models (PIMs) are presented for the formation of supported\nnanoclusters (or islands) during deposition on flat crystalline substrates at\nlower submonolayer coverages. These models treat islands as occupying a single\nadsorption site, although carrying a label to track their size (i.e., they\nsuppress island structure). However, they are particularly effective in\ndescribing the island size and spatial distributions. In fact, these PIMs\nprovide fundamental insight into the key features for homogeneous nucleation\nand growth processes on surfaces. PIMs are also versatile being readily adapted\nto treat both diffusion-limited and attachment-limited growth, and also a\nvariety of other nucleation processes with modified mechanisms. Their behavior\nis readily and precisely assessed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  We consider a weakly interacting quantum spin chain with random local\ninteractions. We prove that many-body localization follows from a physically\nreasonable assumption that limits the extent of level attraction in the\nstatistics of eigenvalues. In a KAM-style construction, a sequence of local\nunitary transformations is used to diagonalize the Hamiltonian by deforming the\ninitial tensor product basis into a complete set of exact many-body\neigenfunctions.\n", "  A competition of the low-energy Coulomb excitation (CE) with the compound\nnucleus (CN) formation in $\\alpha$-induced reactions below the Coulomb barrier\nhas been assumed by Rauscher [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 061104 (2013)] in order to\nuse the same optical model (OM) potential for description of the latter and the\nalpha-particle emission as well. In this Comment we show that the corresponding\npartial waves and integration radii provide evidence for the distinct account\nof the CE cross section and OM total-reaction cross section.\n", "  We investigate semiclassical backreaction on a conical naked singularity\nspace-time with a negative cosmological constant in (2+1)-dimensions. In\nparticular, we calculate the renormalized quantum stress-energy tensor for a\nconformally coupled scalar field on such naked singularity space-time. We then\nobtain the backreacted metric via the semiclassical Einstein equations. We show\nthat, in the regime where the semiclassical approximation can be trusted,\nbackreaction dresses the naked singularity with an event horizon, thus\nenforcing cosmic censorship.\n", "  The behavior of general nonclassical two-mode Gaussian states at a beam\nsplitter is investigated. Single-mode nonclassicality as well as two-mode\nentanglement of both input and output states are analyzed suggesting their\nsuitable quantifiers. These quantifiers are derived from local and global\ninvariants of linear unitary two-mode transformations such that the sum of\ninput (or output) local nonclassicality measures and entanglement measure gives\na global invariant. This invariant quantifies the global nonclassicality\nresource. Mutual transformations of local nonclassicalities and entanglement\ninduced by the beam splitter are analyzed considering incident noisy twin\nbeams, single-mode noisy squeezed vacuum states, and states encompassing both\nsqueezed states and twin beams. A rich tapestry of interesting nonclassical\noutput states is predicted.\n", "  A very simple, quadratic potential is used to construct vortex strings in a\ngeneralized Skyrme model and an additional quadratic potential is used to embed\nsine-Gordon-type halfkinks onto the string worldline, yielding half-Skyrmions\non a string. The strings are furthermore compactified onto a circle and the\nhalfkinks are forced to appear in pairs; in particular 2B halfkinks\n(half-Skyrmions) will appear as beads on a ring with B being the number of\ntimes the host vortex is twisted and also the baryon number (Skyrmion number)\nfrom the bulk point of view. Finally, we construct an effective field theory on\nthe torus, describing the kinks living on the vortex rings.\n", "  We study the winding angles of random and self-avoiding walks on square and\ncubic lattices with number of steps $N$ ranging up to $10^7$. We show that the\nmean square winding angle $\\langle\\theta^2\\rangle$ of random walks converges to\nthe theoretical form when $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. For self-avoiding walks on the\nsquare lattice, we show that the ratio\n$\\langle\\theta^4\\rangle/\\langle\\theta^2\\rangle^2$ converges slowly to the\nGaussian value 3. For self avoiding walks on the cubic lattice we find that the\nratio $\\langle\\theta^4\\rangle/\\langle\\theta^2\\rangle^2$ exhibits non-monotonic\ndependence on $N$ and reaches a maximum of 3.73(1) for $N\\approx10^4$. We show\nthat to a good approximation, the square winding angle of a self-avoiding walk\non the cubic lattice can be obtained from the summation of the square change in\nthe winding angles of $\\ln N$ independent segments of the walk, where the\n$i$-th segment contains $2^i$ steps. We find that the square winding angle of\nthe $i$-th segment increases approximately as $i^{0.5}$, which leads to an\nincrease of the total square winding angle proportional to $(\\ln N)^{1.5}$.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the close relationship between Dicke\nsuperradiance, originally predicted for an ensemble of two-level atoms in\nentangled states, and the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, initially established\nin astronomy to determine the dimensions of classical light sources like stars.\nBy studying the state evolution of the fields produced by classical sources --\ndefined by a positive Glauber-Sudarshan P function -- when recording intensity\ncorrelations of higher order in a generalized Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup we\nfind that the angular distribution of the last detected photon, apart from an\noffset, is identical to the superradiant emission pattern generated by an\nensemble of two-level atoms in entangled symmetric Dicke states. We show that\nthe phenomenon derives from projective measurements induced by the measurement\nof photons in the far field of the sources and the permutative superposition of\nquantum paths identical to those leading to superradiance in the case of single\nphoton emitters. We thus point out an important similarity between classical\nsources and quantum emitters upon detection of photons if the particular photon\nsource remains unknown. We finally present a compact result for the\ncharacteristic functional which generates intensity correlations of arbitrary\norder for any kind of light sources.\n", "  We present a procedure that is helpful to reduce the computational complexity\nof large-scale shell-model calculations, by preserving as much as possible the\nrole of the rejected degrees of freedom in an effective approach. Our\ntruncation is driven first by the analysis of the effective single-particle\nenergies of the original large-scale shell-model hamiltonian, so to locate the\nrelevant degrees of freedom to describe a class of isotopes or isotones, namely\nthe single-particle orbitals that will constitute a new truncated model space.\nThe second step is to perform an unitary transformation of the original\nhamiltonian from its model space into the truncated one. This transformation\ngenerates a new shell-model hamiltonian, defined in a smaller model space, that\nretains effectively the role of the excluded single-particle orbitals. As an\napplication of this procedure, we have chosen a realistic shell-model\nhamiltonian defined in a large model space, set up by seven and five proton and\nneutron single-particle orbitals outside 88Sr, respectively. We study the\ndependence of shell-model results upon different truncations of the original\nmodel space for the Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd, Cd, and Sn isotopic chains, showing the\nreliability of this truncation procedure.\n", "  While the interactions between water molecules are dominated by strongly\ndirectional hydrogen bonds (HBs), it was recently proposed that relatively\nweak, isotropic van der Waals (vdW) forces are essential for understanding the\nproperties of liquid water and ice. This insight was derived from ab initio\ncomputer simulations, which provide an unbiased description of water at the\natomic level and yield information on the underlying molecular forces. However,\nthe high computational cost of such simulations prevents the systematic\ninvestigation of the influence of vdW forces on the thermodynamic anomalies of\nwater. Here we develop efficient ab initio-quality neural network potentials\nand use them to demonstrate that vdW interactions are crucial for the formation\nof water's density maximum and its negative volume of melting. Both phenomena\ncan be explained by the flexibility of the HB network, which is the result of a\ndelicate balance of weak vdW forces, causing e.g. a pronounced expansion of the\nsecond solvation shell upon cooling that induces the density maximum.\n", "  One very important object for understanding the nature of red novae is V1309\nSco. Its pre-outburst observations showed that, before its red-nova eruption in\n2008, it was a contact binary quickly evolving to the merger of the components.\nIt thus provided us with a direct evidence that the red novae result from\nstellar mergers. We analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the\nobject and its evolution with time. From various optical and infrared surveys\nand observing programmes carried out with OGLE, HST, VVV, Gemini South, WISE,\nSpitzer, and Herschel we constructed observed SED in 2010 and 2012. Some\nlimited data are also available for the red-nova progenitor in 2007. We analyse\nthe data with our model of a dusty envelope surrounding a central star. Dust\nwas present in the pre-outburst state of V1309 Sco. Its high temperature\n(900-1000 K) suggests that this was a freshly formed dust in a presumable\nmass-loss from the spiralling-in binary. Shortly after its 2008 eruption,\nV1309~Sco became almost completely embedded in dust. The parameters\n(temperature, dimensions) of the dusty envelope in 2010 and 2012 evidence that\nwe then observed matter lost by the object during the 2008 outburst. Its mass\nis at least $10^{-3}\\,M_\\odot$. The object remains quite luminous, although\nsince its maximum brightness in September 2008, it has faded in luminosity by a\nfactor of ~50 (in 2012). Far infrared data from Herschel reveal presence of a\ncold (~30 K) dust at a distance of a few thousand AU from the object. This\nconclusion could be verified by submillimeter interferometric observations.\n", "  The direction of polarization produced by a moving source rotates with the\nrespect to the rest frame. We show that this effect, induced by pulsar\nrotation, leads to an important correction to polarization swings within the\nframework of rotating vector model (RVM); this effect has been missed by\nprevious works. We construct relativistic RVM taking into account finite\nheights of the emission region that lead to aberration, time-of-travel effects\nand relativistic rotation of polarization. Polarizations swings at different\nfrequencies can be used, within the assumption of the radius-to-frequency\nmapping, to infer emission radii and geometry of pulsars.\n", "  The use of high voltage (HV) electrodes in vacuum is commonplace in physics\nlaboratories. In such systems, it has long been known that electron emission\nfrom an HV cathode can lead to bremsstrahlung X-rays; indeed, this is the basic\nprinciple behind the operation of standard X-ray sources. However, in\nlaboratory setups where X-ray production is not the goal and no electron source\nis deliberately introduced, field-emitted electrons accelerated by HV can\nproduce X-rays as an unintended hazardous byproduct. Both the level of hazard\nand the safe operating regimes for HV vacuum electrode systems are not widely\nappreciated, at least in university laboratories. A reinforced awareness of the\nradiation hazards associated with vacuum HV setups would be beneficial. We\npresent a case study of a HV vacuum electrode device operated in a university\natomic physics laboratory. We describe the characterisation of the observed\nX-ray radiation, its relation to the observed leakage current in the device,\nthe steps taken to contain and mitigate the radiation hazard, and suggest\nsafety guidelines.\n", "  MeV-GeV dark matter (DM) is theoretically well motivated but remarkably\nunexplored. This proposal presents the MeV-GeV DM discovery potential for a\n$\\sim$1 m$^3$ segmented CsI(Tl) scintillator detector placed downstream of the\nHall A beam-dump at Jefferson Lab, receiving up to 10$^{22}$\nelectrons-on-target (EOT) in 285 days. This experiment (Beam-Dump eXperiment or\nBDX) would be sensitive to elastic DM-electron and to inelastic DM scattering\nat the level of 10 counts per year, reaching the limit of the neutrino\nirreducible background. The distinct signature of a DM interaction will be an\nelectromagnetic shower of few hundreds of MeV, together with a reduced activity\nin the surrounding active veto counters. A detailed description of the DM\nparticle $\\chi$ production in the dump and subsequent interaction in the\ndetector has been performed by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Different\napproaches have been used to evaluate the expected backgrounds: the cosmogenic\nbackground has been extrapolated from the results obtained with a prototype\ndetector running at INFN-LNS (Italy), while the beam-related background has\nbeen evaluated by GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed experiment will\nbe sensitive to large regions of DM parameter space, exceeding the discovery\npotential of existing and planned experiments in the MeV-GeV DM mass range by\nup to two orders of magnitude.\n", "  In this contribution we summarize the recent calculation of the complete\nelectron contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at four-loop\norder.\n", "  We introduce a numerical algorithm to stochastically sample the dual fermion\nperturbation series around the dynamical mean field theory, generating all\ntopologies of two-particle interaction vertices. We show results in the weak\nand strong coupling regime of the half-filled Hubbard model in two dimensions,\nillustrating that the method converges quickly where dynamical mean field\ntheory is a good approximation, and show that corrections are large in the\nstrong correlation regime at intermediate interaction. The fast convergence of\ndual corrections to dynamical mean field results illustrates the power of the\napproach and opens a practical avenue towards the systematic inclusion of\nnon-local correlations in correlated materials simulations. An analysis of the\nfrequency scale shows that only low-frequency propagators contribute\nsubstantially to the diagrams, putting the inclusion of higher order vertices\nwithin reach.\n", "  Discrete Element Methods (DEM) are a useful tool to model the fracture of\ncohesive granular materials. For this kind of application, simple particle\nshapes (discs in 2D, spheres in 3D) are usually employed. However, dealing with\nmore general particle shapes allows to account for the natural heterogeneity of\ngrains inside real materials. We present a discrete model allowing to mimic\ncohesion between contacting or non-contacting particles whatever their shape in\n2D and 3D. The cohesive interactions are made of cohesion points placed on\ninteracting particles, with the aim of representing a cohesive phase lying\nbetween the grains. Contact situations are solved according to unilateral\ncontact and Coulomb friction laws. In order to test the developed model, 2D\nunixial compression simulations are performed. Numerical results show the\nability of the model to mimic the macroscopic behavior of an aggregate grain\nsubject to axial compression, as well as fracture initiation and propagation. A\nstudy of the influence of model and sample parameters provides important\ninformation on the ability of the model to reproduce various behaviors.\n", "  We present an update of a spectroscopic follow-up survey at low-resolution of\na large number of RR Lyrae halo overdensity candidates found in the southern\nsky. The substructure candidates were identified in the RR Lyrae catalog of\nTorrealba et al. (2015) using Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) data.\nRadial velocities and mean metallicities have been estimated for target stars\nin almost half of the original overdensities to assess their potential\nmembership to coherent halo features.\n", "  There is substantial evidence for disk formation taking place during the\nearly stages of star formation and for most stars being born in multiple\nsystems; however, protostellar multiplicity and disk searches have been\nhampered by low resolution, sample bias, and variable sensitivity. We have\nconducted an unbiased, high-sensitivity Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)\nsurvey toward all known protostars (n = 94) in the Perseus molecular cloud\n(d~230 pc), with a resolution of ~15 AU (0.06\") at 8 mm. We have detected\ncandidate protostellar disks toward 17 sources (with 12 of those in the Class 0\nstage) and we have found substructure on < 50AU scales for three Class 0 disk\ncandidates, possibly evidence for disk fragmentation. We have discovered 16 new\nmultiple systems (or new components) in this survey; the new systems have\nseparations < 500 AU and 3 by < 30 AU. We also found a bi-modal distribution of\nseparations, with peaks at ~75 AU and ~3000 AU, suggestive of formation through\ntwo distinct mechanisms: disk and turbulent fragmentation. The results from\nthis survey demonstrate the necessity and utility of uniform, unbiased surveys\nof protostellar systems at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths.\n", "  In [7] Klainerman introduced the hyperboloidal method to prove the global\nexistence results for nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations by using commuting\nvector fields. In this paper, we extend the hyperboloidal method from Minkowski\nspace to Lorentzian spacetimes. This approach is developed in [14] for proving,\nunder the maximal foliation gauge, the global nonlinear stability of Minkowski\nspace for Einstein equations with massive scalar fields, which states that, the\nsufficiently small data in a compact domain, surrounded by a Schwarzschild\nmetric, leads to a unique, globally hyperbolic, smooth and geodesically\ncomplete solution to the Einstein Klein-Gordon system.\n  In this paper, we set up the geometric framework of the intrinsic hyperboloid\napproach in the curved spacetime. By performing a thorough geometric comparison\nbetween the radial normal vector field induced by the intrinsic hyperboloids\nand the canonical $\\p_r$, we manage to control the hyperboloids when they are\nclose to their asymptote, which is a light cone in the Schwarzschild zone. By\nusing such geometric information, we not only obtain the crucial boundary\ninformation for running the energy method in [14], but also prove that the\nintrinsic geometric quantities including the Hawking mass all converge to their\nSchwarzschild values when approaching the asymptote.\n", "  Confocal x-ray fluorescence microscopy (CXRF) allows direct detection of\nx-ray fluorescence from a micron-scale 3D volume of an extended, unthinned\nsample. We have previously demonstrated the use of a novel collection optic,\nfabricated from silicon, that improves the spatial resolution of this approach\nby an order of magnitude over CXRF using polycapillaries. The optic, called a\ncollimating channel array (CCA), consists of micron-scale,\nlithographically-fabricated arrays of collimating channels, all directed\ntowards a single source position. Due to the limited absorbing power of\nsilicon, the useful energy range of these optics was limited to fluorescence\nemission below about 10 keV. Here, we report fabrication of CCAs from germanium\nsubstrates, and demonstrate their practical use for CXRF up to 20 keV.\nSpecifically we demonstrate a nearly energy-independent critical spatial\nresolution $d_R$ of 2.1$\\pm$0.17 \\um from 2-20 keV, as well as excellent\nbackground reduction compared to silicon-based CCAs throughout this energy\nrange. Design details of the optic and background-reduction holder are\ndescribed. Two versions of the optic are now available upon request at the\nbeamline 20ID-B, Advanced Photon Source (APS) - Argonne National Laboratory.\n", "  In this paper, a method to solve functionally commutative time- dependent\nlinear homogeneous differential equation is discussed. We apply this technique\nto solve some dynamical quantum problems.\n", "  The most energetically favourable accommodation processes for common\nimpurities and alloying elements in Be metal and Be-Fe-Al intermetallics were\ninvestigated using atomic scale simulations. Fe additions, combined with\nsuitable heat treatments, may scavange Al and Si through their incorporation\ninto the FeBe5 intermetallic. In the absence of Fe, Al and Si will not be\nassociated with Be metal. Li and Mg are also not soluble, but may react with\nother impurities if present (such as Al or H). Mg may also form the MgBe13\nintermetallic phase under certain conditions. He and H exhibit negligible\nsolubility in all phases investigated and whilst He will tend to form bubbles,\nH can precipitate as BeH2. Similarly, C additions will form the stable compound\nBe2C. Finally, oxygen exhibits a strong affinity to Be, exhibiting both some\ndegree of solubility in all phases considered here (though especially metallic\nBe) and a highly favourable energy of formation for BeO.\n", "  We study the structural dynamics of photoexcited [Co(terpy)2]2+ in an aqueous\nsolution with ultrafast x-ray diffuse scattering experiments conducted at the\nLinac Coherent Light Source. Through direct comparisons with density functional\ntheory calculations, our analysis shows that the photoexcitation event leads to\nelongation of the Co-N bonds, followed by coherent Co-N bond length\noscillations arising from the impulsive excitation of a vibrational mode\ndominated by the symmetrical stretch of all six Co-N bonds. This mode has a\nperiod of 0.33 ps and decays on a subpicosecond time scale. We find that the\nequilibrium bond-elongated structure of the high spin state is established on a\nsingle-picosecond time scale and that this state has a lifetime of ~ 7 ps.\n", "  Cell-cell adhesion is established by specific binding of receptor and ligand\nproteins. The adhesion bonds attract each other and often aggregate into large\nclusters that are central to many biological processes. One possible origin of\nattractive interactions between adhesion bonds is the elastic response of the\nmembranes to their deformation by the bonds. Here, we analyze these\nelasticity-mediated interactions using a novel mean-field approach. Analysis of\nsystems at different densities of bonds, $\\phi$, reveals that the phase diagram\nexhibits a nearly-universal behavior when the temperature $T$ is plotted vs.\nthe scaled density $x=\\phi \\xi^2$, where $\\xi$ is the linear size of the\nmembrane's region affected by a single bond. The critical point $(\\phi_c,T_c)$\nis located at very low densities and slightly below $T_c$ we identify phase\ncoexistence between two low-density phases. Dense domains are observed only\nwhen the height by which the bonds deform the membranes, $h_0$, is much larger\nthan their thermal roughness, $\\Delta$, which occurs at very low temperatures\n$T\\ll T_c$. We conclude that the elasticity-mediated interactions are weak and\ncannot be regarded as responsible for the formation of dense adhesion domains.\nThe weakness of the elasticity-mediated effect and its relevance to dilute\nsystems only can be attributed to the fact that the membrane's elastic energy\nsaturates in the semi-dilute regime, when the typical spacing between the bonds\n$r\\gtrsim \\xi$, i.e., for $x\\lesssim 1$. Therefore, at higher densities, only\nthe mixing entropy of the bonds (which favors uniform distributions) is\nthermodynamically relevant. We discuss the implications of our results to the\nquestion of immunological synapse formation, and demonstrate the\nelasticity-mediated interactions may be involved in the aggregation of these\nsemi-dilute membrane domains.\n", "  We clarify the relation between the wave function renormalization for Wilson\nactions and that for the 1PI actions in the exact renormalization group\nformalism. Our study depends crucially on the use of two independent cutoff\nfunctions for the Wilson actions. We relate our results to those obtained\npreviously by Bervillier, Rosten, and Osborn & Twigg.\n", "  We study the onset of delamination blisters in a growing elastic sheet\nadhered to a flat stiff substrate. When the ends of the sheet are kept fixed,\nits growth arouses residual stresses that lead to delamination. This\ninstability can be viewed as a discontinuous buckling between the complete\nadhered solution and the buckled solution. We provide an analytic expression\nfor the critical deformation at which the instability occurs. We show that the\ncritical threshold scales with a single dimensionless parameter that comprises\ninformation from the geometry of the sheet, the mechanical parameters of\nmaterial and the adhesive features of the substrate.\n", "  A short summary of results for top-quark pair production in association with\na jet with NLO QCD off-shell effects at the LHC is given. The calculation is\nbased on the matrix element for the $pp \\to e^+ \\nu_e \\mu^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\nb\\bar{b} j$ process. All quantum effects are properly accounted for, which\namounts to including all Feynman diagrams that result in this final state with\ninterference effects as well as non-zero top-quark width effects. Results for\ntotal cross sections and a few differential distributions at the LHC Run1\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV are presented. In addition, the size of top-quark\noff-shell effects is quantified for the total cross section in presence of\nrather inclusive cuts on all final states. Numerical results shown in this\nproceedings have been obtained with the HELAC-NLO Monte Carlo program.\n", "  The paper is intended to introduce power conversion principles and to define\ncommon terms in the domain. The concepts of sources and switches are defined\nand classified. From the basic laws of source interconnections, a generic\nmethod of power converter synthesis is presented. Some examples illustrate this\nsystematic method. Finally, the commutation cell and soft commutation are\nintroduced and discussed.\n", "  One of the main concerns for power electronic engineers regarding capacitors\nis to predict their remaining lifetime in order to anticipate costly failures\nor system unavailability. This may be achieved using a Weibull statistical law\ncombined with acceleration factors for the temperature, the voltage, and the\nhumidity. This paper discusses the different capacitor failure modes and their\neffects and consequences.\n", "  This paper discusses the subject of power quality for power converters. The\nfirst part gives an overview of most of the common disturbances and power\nquality issues in electrical networks for particle accelerators, and explains\ntheir consequences for accelerator operation. The propagation of asymmetrical\nnetwork disturbances into a network is analysed. Quantitative parameters for\nnetwork disturbances in a typical network are presented, and immunity levels\nfor users' electrical equipment are proposed. The second part of this paper\ndiscusses the technologies and strategies used in particle accelerator networks\nfor power quality improvement. Particular focus is given to networks supplying\nloads with cycling active and reactive power.\n", "  This paper describes the main challenges related to power converters in a\nscientific environment. It proposes some methods of EMC analysis, design,\nmeasurement, and EMC troubleshooting.\n", "  This paper was originally presented at CAS-2004, and was slightly modified\nfor CAS-2014. It presents a review of the key parameters that impact the design\nchoices for a true four-quadrant power converter, in the range 1-10 kW, mainly\nbased on switching mode converter topology. This paper will first describe the\nstate-of-the-art for this power converter family, giving the drawbacks and\nadvantages of different possible solutions. It will also present practical\nresults obtained from the CERN-designed converter. It will finally give some\nimportant tips regarding critical phases like test one, when conducting a\nproject dealing with this type of power converter.\n", "  We prove an asymptotic formula for the determinant of the bundle Laplacian on\ndiscrete $d$-dimensional tori as the number of vertices tends to infinity. This\ndeterminant has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of cycle-rooted\nspanning forests. We also establish a relation (in the limit) between the\nspectral zeta function of a line bundle over a discrete torus, the spectral\nzeta function of the infinite graph $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ and the Epstein-Hurwitz zeta\nfunction. The latter can be viewed as the spectral zeta function of the twisted\ncontinuous torus which is the limit of the sequence of discrete tori.\n", "  Solid state amplifiers are being increasingly used instead of electronic\nvacuum tubes to feed accelerating cavities with radio frequency power in the\n100 kW range. Power is obtained from the combination of hundreds of transistor\namplifier modules. This paper summarizes a one hour lecture on solid state\namplifiers for accelerator applications.\n", "  Long pulse modulators are used to produce high-voltage, high-power pulses\nwith durations of several hundred microseconds up to some milliseconds. The\nloads are one or more klystrons for producing RF power to accelerate the\nparticle beam in superconducting cavities. After years of development and\nimprovements in different institutes a variety of topologies exist, and are\npresented. The basics of modulators, pulse requirements and klystrons are\nexplained. Additionally, the charging of internal energy storage will be\naddressed. The outlook for future developments is given.\n", "  Electrical and electronic systems can be disturbed by radiation-induced\neffects. In some cases, radiation-induced effects are of a low probability and\ncan be ignored; however, radiation effects must be considered when designing\nsystems that have a high mean time to failure requirement, an impact on\nprotection, and/or higher exposure to radiation. High-energy physics power\nsystems suffer from a combination of these effects: a high mean time to failure\nis required, failure can impact on protection, and the proximity of systems to\naccelerators increases the likelihood of radiation-induced events. This paper\npresents the principal radiation-induced effects, and radiation environments\ntypical to high-energy physics. It outlines a procedure for designing and\nvalidating radiation-tolerant systems using commercial off-the-shelf\ncomponents. The paper ends with a worked example of radiation-tolerant power\nconverter controls that are being developed for the Large Hadron Collider and\nHigh Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\n", "  Risk is a fundamental consideration when designing electronic systems. For\nmost systems a view of risk can assist in setting design objectives, whereas\nboth a qualitative and quantitative understanding of risk is mandatory when\nconsidering protection systems. This paper gives an overview of the risks due\nto stored magnetic and beam energies in high-energy physics, and shows how a\nrisk-based approach can be used to design new systems mitigating these risks,\nusing a lifecycle inspired by IEC 61508. Designing new systems in high-energy\nphysics can be challenging as new and novel techniques are difficult to\nquantify and predict. This paper shows how the same lifecycle approach can be\nused in reverse to analyse existing systems, following their operation and\nfirst experiences.\n", "  The heart of every switched mode converter consists of several switching\nsemiconductor elements. Due to their non-ideal behaviour there are ON state and\nswitching losses heating up the silicon chip. That heat must effectively be\ntransferred to the environment in order to prevent overheating or even\ndestruction of the element. For a cost-effective design, the semiconductors\nshould be operated close to their thermal limits. Unfortunately the chip\ntemperature cannot be measured directly. Therefore a detailed understanding of\nhow losses arise, including their quantitative estimation, is required.\nFurthermore, the heat paths to the environment must be understood in detail.\nThis paper describes the main issues of loss generation and its transfer to the\nenvironment and how it can be estimated by the help of datasheets and/or\nexperiments.\n", "  This paper reviews the design of regulation loops for power converters. Power\nconverter control being a vast domain, it does not aim to be exhaustive. The\nobjective is to give a rapid overview of the main synthesis methods in both\ncontinuous- and discrete-time domains.\n", "  The accurate measurement of power converter currents is essential to\ncontrolling and delivering stable and repeatable currents to magnets in\nparticle accelerators. This paper reviews the most commonly used devices for\nthe measurement of power converter currents and discusses test and calibration\nmethods.\n", "  This is a review paper updated from that presented for CAS 2004. Essentially,\nsince then, commercial components have continued to extend their performance\nboundaries but the basic building blocks and the techniques for choosing the\nbest device and implementing it in a design have not changed. Analogue to\ndigital and digital to analogue converters are crucial components in the\ncontinued drive to replace analogue circuitry with more controllable and less\ncostly digital processing. This paper discusses the technologies available to\nperform in the likely measurement and control applications that arise within\naccelerators. It covers much of the terminology and 'specmanship' together with\nan application-oriented analysis of the realisable performance of the various\ntypes. Finally, some hints and warnings on system integration problems are\ngiven.\n", "  In this paper, we study the ordering states with Tsallis relative\n$\\alpha$-entropies of coherence and $l_{1}$ norm of coherence for single-qubit\nstates. We show that any Tsallis relative $\\alpha$-entropies of coherence and\n$l_{1}$ norm of coherence give the same ordering for single-qubit pure states.\nHowever, they don't generate the same ordering for some high dimensional pure\nstates, even though these states are pure. We also consider three special\nTsallis relative $\\alpha$-entropies of coherence, such as $C_{1}$ ,$C_{2}$ and\n$C_{\\frac{1}{2}}$, and show any one of these three measures and $C_{l_{1}}$\nwill not generate the same ordering for single-qubit mixed states. Furthermore,\nwe find that any two of these three special measures generate different\nordering for single-qubit mixed states.\n", "  Mesons are extended objects, hence their interaction can be described by\nutilizing form factors. At the Lagrangian level, one can use nonlocal\ninteraction terms. Here we describe two possible nonlocal Lagrangians leading\nto a 3D form factor: the first one is simple but does not fulfill covariance\n(if one insists on a 3D cutoff), the second extension is more involved but\nguarantees covariance. Such form factors are useful when calculating mesonic\nloops. As an important example, we discuss the scalar kaonic sector,\n$I(J^{P})=\\frac{1}{2}(0^{+})$. The Lagrangian contains a single scalar kaon\n(the well-establish state $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$), but through loops\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ emerges as a dynamically generated companion pole (which\ndisappears in the large-$N_{c}$ limit).\n", "  Reliable powering of accelerator magnets requires reliable power converters\nand controls, able to meet the powering specifications in the long term. In\nthis paper, some of the issues that will challenge a power converter controls\nengineer are discussed.\n", "  Particle accelerators use a great variety of power converters for energizing\ntheir sub-systems; while the total number of power converters usually depends\non the size of the accelerator or combination of accelerators (including the\nexperimental setup), the characteristics of power converters depend on their\nloads and on the particle physics requirements: this paper aims to provide an\noverview of the magnet power converters in use in several facilities worldwide.\n", "  This paper presents the latest trends in the powering of particle\naccelerators. A series of solutions is proposed for responding to the\nchallenges of high performance machines. This paper covers the domains of\nmagnetic field uncertainty, power converter control, and energy saving. This\nlist is not exhaustive, but it does correspond to the latest innovations in the\nfield of powering particle accelerators.\n", "  This paper introduces the requirements for power converters needed for\nparticle accelerators. It describes the role of power converters and the\nchallenges and constraints when powering magnets. The different circuit layouts\nare presented as well as the operating cycles. The power converter control and\nhigh precision definition are also introduced. This paper lists the key circuit\nparameters to be taken into consideration to properly specify a power converter\nthat can be compiled in a functional specification.\n", "  We present a physical example, where a fractional (both in space and time)\nSchr\\\"odinger equation appears only as a formal effective description of\ndiffusive wave transport in complex inhomogeneous media. This description is a\nresult of the parabolic equation approximation that corresponds to the paraxial\nsmall angle approximation of the fractional Helmholtz equation. The obtained\neffective quantum dynamics is fractional in both space and time. As an example,\nL\\'evy flights in an infinite potential well are considered numerically. An\nanalytical expression for the effective wave function of the quantum dynamics\nis obtained as well.\n", "  We propose a dynamical model depicting the interactions between DNA and a\nspecific binding protein involving long range transmissions. The dynamics rely\non the coupling between Hydrogen bonds formed between DNA and protein and\nbetween the base pairs because they account for site specificity of the\nbinding. We adopt the Morse potential with coupling terms to construct the\nHamiltonian. This model gives rise to a breather excitation, corresponding to\nthe DNA bubble formation, which propagates as the carrier of genetic\ninformation. We examine the various kind of possible coupling dynamics and\nsuggest the model feasibility in depicting the renaturation or hybridization\nprocesses.\n", "  It has been a puzzle whether quarks may exist in the interior of massive\nneutron stars, since the hadron-quark phase transition softens the equation of\nstate (EOS) and reduce the neutron star (NS) maximum mass very significantly.\nIn this work, we consider the light U-boson that increases the NS maximum mass\nappreciably through its weak coupling to fermions. The inclusion of the U-boson\nmay thus allow the existence of the quark degrees of freedom in the interior of\nlarge mass neutron stars. Unlike the consequence of the U-boson in hadronic\nmatter, the stiffening role of the U-boson in the hybrid EOS is not sensitive\nto the choice of the hadron phase models. In addition, we have also\ninvestigated the effect of the effective QCD correction on the hybrid EOS. This\ncorrection may reduce the coupling strength of the U-boson that is needed to\nsatisfy NS maximum mass constraint. While the inclusion of the U-boson also\nincreases the NS radius significantly, we find that appropriate in-medium\neffects of the U-boson may reduce the NS radii significantly, satisfying both\nthe NS radius and mass constraints well.\n", "  We report synthesis, crystal structure and physical properties of a quinary\niron-arsenide fluoride KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$. The new compound crystallizes\nin a body-centered tetragonal lattice (with space group $I4/mmm$, $a$ =\n3.8684(2) {\\AA}, c = 31.007(1) {\\AA}, and $Z$ = 2), which contains double\nFe$_2$As$_2$ conducting layers separated by insulating Ca$_2$F$_2$ layers. Our\nmeasurements of electrical resistivity, dc magnetic susceptibility and heat\ncapacity demonstrate bulk superconductivity at 33 K in\nKCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$.\n", "  The handling of weak networks with asymmetric loads and disturbances implies\nthe accurate handling of the second-harmonic component that appears in an\nunbalanced network. This paper proposes a classic vector control approach using\na PI-based controller with superior decoupling capabilities for operation in\nweak networks with unbalanced phase voltages. A synchronization method for weak\nunbalanced networks is detailed, with dedicated dimensioning rules. The use of\na double-frame controller allows a current symmetry or controlled imbalance to\nbe forced for compensation of power oscillations by controlling the negative\ncurrent sequence. This paper also serves as a useful reminder of the proper way\nto cancel the inherent coupling effect due to the transformation to the\nsynchronous rotating reference frame, and of basic considerations of the\nrelationship between switching frequency and control bandwidth.\n", "  We construct a toy model for weak interaction based on the assumption that\ngauge bosons form condensates. We then discuss the model predictions calculated\nfrom the effective Feynman rules which are derived through computing the\neffective action.\n", "  On a sufficiently-soft substrate, a resting fluid droplet will cause\nsignificant deformation of the substrate. This deformation is driven by a\ncombination of capillary forces at the contact line and the fluid pressure at\nthe solid surface. These forces are balanced at the surface by the solid\ntraction stress induced by the substrate deformation. Young's Law, which\npredicts the equilibrium contact angle of the droplet, also indicates an a\npriori radial force balance for rigid substrates, but not necessarily for soft\nsubstrates which deform under loading. It remains an open question whether the\ncontact line transmits a non-zero radial force to the substrate surface in\naddition to the conventional vertical force. We present an analytic Fourier\ntransform solution technique that includes general interfacial energy\nconditions which govern the contact angle of a 2D droplet. This includes\nevaluating the effect of gravity on the droplet shape in order to determine the\ncorrect fluid pressure at the substrate surface for larger droplets.\nImportantly, we find that in order to avoid a strain singularity at the contact\nline under a nonzero radial contact line force, it is necessary to include a\npreviously-neglected radial traction boundary condition. To quantify the\neffects of the contact line and identify key quantities that will be\nexperimentally-accessible for testing the model, we evaluate solutions for the\nsubstrate surface displacement field as a function of Poisson's ratio and\nzero/non-zero radial contact line forces.\n", "  Collective protein modes are expected to be important for facilitating energy\ntransfer in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, however to date little work\nhas focussed on the microscopic details of these vibrations. The nonlinear\nnetwork model (NNM) provides a computationally inexpensive approach to studying\nvibrational modes at the microscopic level, whilst incorporating anharmonicity\nin the inter-residue interactions which can influence protein dynamics. We\napply the NNM to the FMO complex and find evidence for the existence of\nnonlinear discrete breather modes. These modes tend to transfer energy to the\nhighly connected core pigments, potentially opening up alternative excitation\nenergy transfer routes. Incorporating localised modes based on these discrete\nbreathers in the optical spectra calculations for FMO using ab initio site\nenergies and excitonic couplings can substantially improve their agreement with\nexperimental results.\n", "  We report on the synthesis, characterization, stability and pharmacokinetics\nof novel iron based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nStatistical copolymers combining multiple phosphonic acid groups and\npoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were synthesized and used as coating agents for 10\nnm iron oxide nanocrystals. In vitro, protein corona and stability assays show\nthat phosphonic acid PEG copolymers outperform all other coating types\nexamined, including low molecular weight anionic ligands and polymers. In vivo,\nthe particle pharmacokinetics is investigated by monitoring the MRI signal\nintensity from mouse liver, spleen and arteries as a function of the time,\nbetween one minute and seven days after injection. Iron oxide particles coated\nwith multi-phosphonic acid PEG polymers are shown to have a blood circulation\nlifetime of 250 minutes, i.e. 10 to 50 times greater than that of recently\npublished PEGylated probes and benchmarks. The clearance from the liver takes\nin average 2 to 3 days and is independent of the core size, coating and\nparticle stability. By comparing identical core particles with different\ncoatings, we are able to determine the optimum conditions for stealth MRI\nprobes.\n", "  The dynamics of nonstationary, nonlinear, axisymmetric, warm-core geophysical\nsurface frontal vortices affected by Rayleigh friction is investigated\nsemi-analytically using the nonlinear, nonstationary reduced-gravity\nshallow-water equations. In this frame, it is found that vortices characterized\nby linear distributions of their radial velocity and arbitrary structures of\ntheir section and azimuthal velocity can be described exactly by a set of\nnonstationary, nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations. The\nfirst-order problem (i.e., that describing vortices characterized by a linear\nazimuthal velocity field and a quadratic section) consists of a system of 4\ndifferential equations, and each further order introduces in the system three\nadditional ordinary differential equations and two algebraic equations. In\norder to illustrate the behavior of the nonstationary decaying vortices, the\nsystem's solution for the first-order and for the second-order problem is then\nobtained numerically using a Runge-Kutta method. The solutions demonstrate that\ninertial oscillations and an exponential attenuation dominate the vortex\ndynamics: Expansions and shallowings, contractions and deepenings alternate\nduring an exact inertial period while the vortex decays. The dependence of the\nvortex dissipation rate on its initial radius is found to be non-monotonic: It\nis higher for small and large radii. Our analysis adds realism to previous\ntheoretical investigations on mesoscale vortices, represents an ideal tool for\ntesting the accuracy of numerical models in simulating nonlinear, nonstationary\nfrictional frontal phenomena in a rotating ocean, and paves the way to further\nextensions of (semi-) analytical solutions of hydrodynamical geophysical\nproblems to more arbitrary forms and more complex density stratifications.\n", "  Probes for the small-x parton densities and predicted effects of gluon\nsaturation are discussed. At very low x and intermediate Q, only results on\nhadronic observables at the LHC are available, which do not provide unambiguous\ninformation. It is shown that the measurement of direct photons at forward\nrapidity at the LHC is particularly promising to provide a unique signal. We\nfurther discuss the possibilities to perform such measurements with a detector\nupgrade in the ALICE experiment and present the R&D activities ongoing.\n", "  Accessing the Sivers TMD function in proton+proton collisions through the\nmeasurement of transverse single spin asymmetries (TSSAs) in Drell-Yan and weak\nboson production is an effective path to test the fundamental QCD prediction of\nthe non-universality of the Sivers function. Furthermore, it provides data to\nstudy the spin-flavor structure of valence and sea quarks inside the proton and\nto test the evolution of parton distributions. The TSSA amplitude, $A_{N}$, has\nbeen measured at STAR in proton+proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV, with\na recorded integrated luminosity of 25 pb$^{-1}$. Within relatively large\nstatistical uncertainties, the current data favor theoretical models that\ninclude a change of sign for the Sivers function relative to observations in\nSIDIS measurements, if TMD evolution effects are small. RHIC plans to run\nproton+proton collisions of transversely polarized beams at $\\sqrt{s} = 510$\nGeV in 2017, delivering an integrated luminosity of 400 pb$^{-1}$. This will\nallow STAR to perform a precise measurement of TSSAs in both Drell-Yan and weak\nboson production. The present status and future plans for the Sivers function\nprogram at STAR will be discussed as well as other observables sensitive to the\nnon-universality of the Sivers function in the Twist-3 framework, e.g. the TSSA\nof direct photons.\n", "  Astrophysical tests of the stability of dimensionless fundamental couplings,\nsuch as the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass\nratio $\\mu$, are an optimal probe of new physics. There is a growing interest\nin these tests, following indications of possible spacetime variations at the\nfew parts per million level. Here we make use of the latest astrophysical\nmeasurements, combined with background cosmological observations, to obtain\nimproved constraints on Bekenstein-type models for the evolution of both\ncouplings. These are arguably the simplest models allowing for $\\alpha$ and\n$\\mu$ variations, and are characterized by a single free dimensionless\nparameter, $\\zeta$, describing the coupling of the underlying dynamical degree\nof freedom to the electromagnetic sector. In the former case we find that this\nparameter is constrained to be $|\\zeta_\\alpha|<4.8\\times10^{-6}$ (improving\nprevious constraints by a factor of 6), while in the latter (which we\nquantitatively compare to astrophysical measurements for the first time) we\nfind $\\zeta_\\mu=(2.7\\pm3.1)\\times10^{-7}$; both of these are at the $99.7\\%$\nconfidence level. For $\\zeta_\\alpha$ this constraint is about 20 times stronger\nthan the one obtained from local Weak Equivalence Principle tests, while for\n$\\zeta_\\mu$ it is about 2 orders of magnitude weaker. We also discuss the\nimprovements on these constraints to be expected from the forthcoming ESPRESSO\nand ELT-HIRES spectrographs, conservatively finding a factor around 5 for the\nformer and around 50 for the latter.\n", "  We present NECTAR, a community detection algorithm that generalizes Louvain\nmethod's local search heuristic for overlapping community structures. NECTAR\nchooses dynamically which objective function to optimize based on the network\non which it is invoked. Our experimental evaluation on both synthetic benchmark\ngraphs and real-world networks, based on ground-truth communities, shows that\nNECTAR provides excellent results as compared with state of the art community\ndetection algorithms.\n", "  This document is dedicated to recent results on the measurements of a vector\nboson production associated with jets (V+jets) using CMS detector experiment,\nwith a central proton-proton (pp) collision energy of respectively 8 TeV (RunI)\nand 13 TeV (RunII). The vector boson can be a W boson, Z boson, or\nphoton({\\gamma}). The jets are of any flavor, as well as the ones containing\nheavy flavor quarks, such as bottom(b) quarks. The inclusive cross sections of\nV+jets processes and differential cross sections as a function of various\nkinematic observables are presented and compared to several theoretical\npredictions. In general, the comparison between theoretical calculations and\nmeasurement are crucial for improving modeling and precision on QCD dynamics.\n", "  We compute the entanglement entropy variation between initial (separable or\nentangled in the momenta) and final states $\\Delta S_E$ in an elastic\nscattering of a bipartite system composed by two interacting scalar particles.\nWe perform a quantum field theoretical calculation to one loop order and verify\nthat $\\Delta S_E $ changes as we vary the energy of incoming particles and the\ncoupling strength in a non-trivial way.\n", "  In practice, many empirical networks, including co-authorship and collocation\nnetworks are unimodal projections of a bipartite data structure where one layer\nrepresents entities, the second layer consists of a number of sets representing\naffiliations, attributes, groups, etc., and an inter-layer link indicates\nmembership of an entity in a set. The edge weight in the unimodal projection,\nwhich we refer to as a co-occurrence network, counts the number of sets to\nwhich both end-nodes are linked. Interpreting such dense networks requires\nstatistical analysis that takes into account the bipartite structure of the\nunderlying data. Here we develop a statistical significance metric for such\nnetworks based on a maximum entropy null model which preserves both the\nfrequency sequence of the individuals/entities and the size sequence of the\nsets. Solving the maximum entropy problem is reduced to solving a system of\nnonlinear equations for which fast algorithms exist, thus eliminating the need\nfor expensive Monte-Carlo sampling techniques. We use this metric to prune and\nvisualize a number of empirical networks.\n", "  We give a brief overview of our calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading\norder (NNLO) QCD corrections to Z+jet production in hadronic collisions.\nPhenomenological results are presented which comprise various differential\ndistributions for 8 TeV proton-proton collisions. A significant reduction of\nthe scale uncertainties is observed throughout as we move from NLO to NNLO. We\nfurther discuss how this calculation can be used to describe the inclusive\nZ-boson production at large transverse momentum. To this end, the theory\nprediction is compared to the measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Here, the inclusion of NNLO\nQCD effects are found to result in a substantial improvement in the agreement\nbetween theory and data for the normalised distributions.\n", "  We give upper and lower bounds on the information-theoretic threshold for\ncommunity detection in the stochastic block model. Specifically, consider the\nsymmetric stochastic block model with $q$ groups, average degree $d$, and\nconnection probabilities $c_\\text{in}/n$ and $c_\\text{out}/n$ for within-group\nand between-group edges respectively; let $\\lambda =\n(c_\\text{in}-c_\\text{out})/(qd)$. We show that, when $q$ is large, and $\\lambda\n= O(1/q)$, the critical value of $d$ at which community detection becomes\npossible---in physical terms, the condensation threshold---is \\[ d_\\text{c} =\n\\Theta\\!\\left( \\frac{\\log q}{q \\lambda^2} \\right) \\, , \\] with tighter results\nin certain regimes. Above this threshold, we show that any partition of the\nnodes into $q$ groups which is as `good' as the planted one, in terms of the\nnumber of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it. This gives an\nexponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance; specifically,\ncommunity detection becomes possible below the Kesten-Stigum bound for $q \\ge\n5$ in the disassortative case $\\lambda < 0$, and for $q \\ge 11$ in the\nassortative case $\\lambda >0$ (similar upper bounds were obtained independently\nby Abbe and Sandon). Conversely, below this threshold, we show that no\nalgorithm can label the vertices better than chance, or even distinguish the\nblock model from an \\ER\\ random graph with high probability.\n  Our lower bound on $d_\\text{c}$ uses Robinson and Wormald's small subgraph\nconditioning method, and we also give (less explicit) results for non-symmetric\nstochastic block models. In the symmetric case, we obtain explicit results by\nusing bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to\nAchlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on $d_\\text{c}$ is their second\nmoment lower bound on the $q$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a\ncertain effective degree.\n", "  We consider in what sense quantum tunnelling is associated with non-classical\nprobabilistic behaviour. We use the Wigner function quasi-probability\ndescription of quantum states. We give a definition of tunnelling that allows\nus to say whether in a given scenario there is tunnelling or not. We prove that\nthis can only happen if either the Wigner function is negative and/or a certain\nmeasurement operator which we call the tunnelling rate operator has a negative\nWigner function.\n", "  This study represents the most sensitive Chandra X-ray point source catalogue\nof M31. Using 133 publicly available Chandra ACIS-I/S observations totalling ~1\nMs, we detected 795 X-ray sources in the bulge, northeast, and southwest fields\nof M31, covering an area of approximately 0.6 deg$^{2}$, to a limiting\nunabsorbed 0.5-8.0 keV luminosity of $10^{34}$ erg/s. In the inner bulge, where\nexposure is approximately constant, X-ray fluxes represent average values\nbecause they were determined from many observations over a long period of time.\nSimilarly, our catalogue is more complete in the bulge fields since monitoring\nallowed more transient sources to be detected. The catalogue was\ncross-correlated with a previous XMM-Newton catalogue of M31's $D_{25}$\nisophote consisting of 1948 X-ray sources, with only 979 within the field of\nview of our survey. We found 387 (49%) of our Chandra sources (352 or 44%\nunique sources) matched to within 5 arcsec of 352 XMM-Newton sources. Combining\nthis result with matching done to previous Chandra X-ray sources we detected\n259 new sources in our catalogue. We created X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs)\nin the soft (0.5-2.0 keV) and hard (2.0-8.0 keV) bands that are the most\nsensitive for any large galaxy based on our detection limits.\nCompleteness-corrected XLFs show a break around $1.3\\times10^{37}$ erg/s,\nconsistent with previous work. As in past surveys, we find the bulge XLFs are\nflatter than the disk, indicating a lack of bright high-mass X-ray binaries in\nthe disk and an aging population of low-mass X-ray binaries in the bulge.\n"]}
