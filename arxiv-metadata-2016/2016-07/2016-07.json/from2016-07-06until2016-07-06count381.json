of cis-3-aminophenol and trans-3-aminophenol are determined using\nFourier-transform microwave spectroscopy. We examine several $J=2\\leftarrow{}1$\nand $1\\leftarrow{}0$ hyperfine-resolved rotational transitions for both\nconformers. The transitions are fit to a rigid rotor Hamiltonian including\nnuclear quadrupole coupling to account for the nitrogen nucleus. For\ncis-3-aminophenol we obtain rotational constants of A=3734.930 MHz, B=1823.2095\nMHz, and C=1226.493 MHz, for trans-3-aminophenol of A=3730.1676 MHz,\nB=1828.25774 MHz, and C=1228.1948 MHz. The dipole moments are precisely\ndetermined using Stark effect measurements for several hyperfine transitions to\n$\\mu_a=1.7735$ D, $\\mu_b=1.5195$ D for cis-3-aminophenol and $\\mu_a=0.5563$ D,\n$\\mu_b=0.5376$ D for trans-3-aminophenol. Whereas the rotational constants and\nquadrupole coupling constants do not allow to determinate the absolute\nconfiguration of the two conformers, this assignment is straight-forward based\non the dipole moments. High-level \\emph{ab initio} calculations (B3LYP/6-31G^*\nto MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ) are performed providing error estimates of rotational\nconstants and dipole moments obtained for large molecules by these theoretical\nmethods.\n", "  We have performed full-relativistic density functional theory calculations to\nstudy the geometry and binding energy of different isomers of free platinum\nclusters Pt$_{n}$ ($n=4-6$) within the spin multiplicities from singlet to\nnonet. The spin-orbit coupling effect has been discussed for the minimum-energy\nstructures, relative stabilities, vibrational frequencies, magnetic moments,\nand the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular-orbital gaps. It is\nfound in contrast to some of the previous calculations that 3-dimentional\nconfigurations are still lowest energy structures of these clusters, although\nspin-orbit effect makes some planar or quasi-planar geometries more stable than\nsome other 3-dimentional isomers.\n", "  Amorphous materials as diverse as foams, emulsions, colloidal suspensions and\ngranular media can {\\em jam} into a rigid, disordered state where they\nwithstand finite shear stresses before yielding. The jamming transition has\nbeen studied extensively, in particular in computer simulations of\nfrictionless, soft, purely repulsive spheres. Foams and emulsions are the\nclosest realizations of this model, and in foams, the (un)jamming point\ncorresponds to the wet limit, where the bubbles become spherical and just form\ncontacts. Here we sketch the relevance of the jamming perspective for the\ngeometry and flow of foams --- and also discuss the impact that foams studies\nmay have on theoretical studies on jamming.\n  We first briefly review insights into the crucial role of disorder in these\nsystems, culminating in the breakdown of the affine assumption that underlies\nthe rich mechanics near jamming. Second, we discuss how crucial theoretical\npredictions, such as the square root scaling of contact number with packing\nfraction, and the nontrivial role of disorder and fluctuations for flow have\nbeen observed in experiments on 2D foams. Third, we discuss a scaling model for\nthe rheology of disordered media that appears to capture the key features of\nthe flow of foams, emulsions and soft colloidal suspensions. Finally, we\ndiscuss how best to confront predictions of this model with experimental data.\n", "  Measurements of charge dependent azimuthal correlations with the ALICE\ndetector at the LHC are reported for Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =\n2.76$ TeV. Two- and three-particle charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in\nthe pseudo-rapidity range $|\\eta| < 0.8$ are presented as a function of the\ncollision centrality, particle separation in pseudo-rapidity, and transverse\nmomentum. A clear signal compatible with a charge-dependent separation relative\nto the reaction plane is observed, which shows little or no collision energy\ndependence when compared to measurements at RHIC energies. This provides a new\ninsight for understanding the nature of the charge dependent azimuthal\ncorrelations observed at RHIC and LHC energies.\n", "  Systems which rapidly evolve through symmetry-breaking transitions on\ntimescales comparable to the fluctuation timescale of the single-particle\nexcitations may behave very differently than under controlled near-ergodic\nconditions. A real-time investigation with high temporal resolution may reveal\nnew insights into the ordering through the transition that are not available in\nstatic experiments. We present an investigation of the system trajectory\nthrough a normal-to-superconductor transition in a prototype high-temperature\nsuperconducting cuprate in which such a situation occurs. Using a multiple\npulse femtosecond spectroscopy technique we measure the system trajectory and\ntime-evolution of the single-particle excitations through the transition in\nLa$_{1.9}$Sr$_{0.1}$CuO$_{4}$ and compare the data to a simulation based on\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, using laser excitation fluence as an\nadjustable parameter controlling the quench conditions in both experiment and\ntheory. The comparison reveals the presence of significant superconducting\nfluctuations which precede the transition on short timescales. By including\nsuperconducting fluctuations as a seed for the growth of superconducting order\nwe can obtain a satisfactory agreement of the theory with the experiment.\nRemarkably, the pseudogap excitations apparently play no role in this process.\n", "  Shearing stresses can change the volume of a material via a nonlinear effect\nknown as shear dilatancy. We calculate the elastic dilatancy coefficient of\nsoft sphere packings and random spring networks, two canonical models of\nmarginal solids close to their rigidity transition. We predict a dramatic\nenhancement of dilatancy near rigidity loss in both materials, with a\nsurprising distinction: while packings expand under shear, networks contract.\nWe show that contraction in networks is due to the destabilizing influence of\nincreasing hydrostatic or uniaxial loads, which is counteracted in packings by\nthe formation of new contacts.\n", "  The world appears to be well described by gauge theories; why? I suggest that\ngauge is more than mathematical redundancy. Gauge-dependent quantities can not\nbe predicted, but there is a sense in which they can be measured. They describe\n\"handles\" though which systems couple: they represent real relational\nstructures to which the experimentalist has access in measurement by supplying\none of the relata in the measurement procedure itself. This observation leads\nto a physical interpretation for the ubiquity of gauge: it is a consequence of\na relational structure of physical quantities.\n", "  The phase behavior of a model suspension of colloidal polydisperse platelets\nis studied using density-functional theory. Platelets are modelled as parallel\nrectangular prisms of square section $l$ and height $h$, with length and height\ndistributions given by different polydispersities $\\delta_l$ and $\\delta_h$. We\nobtain the phase behavior of the model, including nematic, smectic and columnar\nphases and its dependence with the two polydispersities $\\delta_l$ and\n$\\delta_h$. When $\\delta_l>\\delta_h$ we observe that the smectic phase\nstabilises first with respect to the columnar. If $\\delta_h>\\delta_l$ we\nobserve the opposite behavior. Other more complicated cases occur, e.g. the\nsmectic stabilises from the nematic first but then exists a first-order\ntransition to the columnar phase. Our model assumes plate-rod symmetry, but the\nregions of stability of smectic and columnar phases are non-symmetric in the\n$\\delta_l-\\delta_h$ plane due to the different dimensionality of ordering in\nthe two phases. Microsegregation effects, i.e. different spatial distribution\nfor different sizes within the periodic cell, take place in both phases.\n", "  In this paper, I tentatively put forward a new hypothesis that the emergence\nof a single chiral form of biomolecules in living organisms is specifically\ndetermined by the electron spin state during their enzyme-catalyzed synthesis\nprocesses. Specifically speaking, the electrons released from the coenzyme\nNAD(P)H of amino acid synthase are heterogeneous in spin states; however, when\nthey pass through the chiral alpha-helix structure of the enzymes to the site\nof amino acid synthesis at the other end of the helix, their spin states are\nfiltered and polarized, producing only spin up electrons; once the\nspin-polarized electrons participate in the reductive reaction between\nalpha-oxo acid and ammonia, only L-amino acids are formed according to the\nPauli exclusion principle.\n", "  We present a lattice dynamics study of orthorhombic antimony sulphide (Sb2S3)\nobtained using density-functional calculations in conjunction with the\nsupercell force-constant method. The effect of Born effective charges is taken\ninto account using a mixed-space approach, resulting in the splitting of\nlongitudinal and transverse optical (LO-TO) phonon branches near the zone\ncenter. Zone-center frequencies agree well with Raman scattering experiments.\nDue to the slow decay of the interatomic force constants (IFC), a minimal 2x4x2\nsupercell (Pnma setting) with 320 atoms is crucial for an accurate\ndetermination of the dispersion relations. Smaller supercells result in\nartificial acoustic phonon softening and unphysical lifting of degeneracies\nalong high symmetry directions. We propose a scheme to investigate the\nconvergence of the IFC with respect to the supercell sizes. The phonon\nsoftening can be attributed to the periodic images that affect the accuracy of\nthe force constants, and the truncation of long-ranged forces. The\ncommensuration of the q-vectors with the supercell size is crucial to preserve\ndegeneracies in Sb2S3 crystals.\n", "  Ceria (CeO$_{2}$) co-doping has been suggested as a means to achieve ionic\nconductivities that are significantly higher than those in singly-doped\nsystems. Rekindled interest in this topic over the last decade has given rise\nto claims of much improved performance. The present study makes use of computer\nsimulations to investigate the bulk ionic conductivity of Rare Earth (RE) doped\nceria, where RE = Sc, Gd, Sm, Nd and La. The results from the singly doped\nsystems are compared to those from ceria co-doped with Nd/Sm and Sc/La. The\npattern that emerges from the conductivity data is consistent with the\ndominance of local lattice strains from individual defects, rather than the\nsynergistic co-doping effect reported recently and, as a result no enhancement\nin the conductivity of co-doped samples is observed.\n", "  We provide a full derivation of Laughlin's Jastrow-type wave functions for\nquantized Hall states subject to periodic boundary conditions using an operator\nformalism. The construction includes the quasi-hole and the technically more\nchallenging quasi-electron excitation, which was left as an open problem in the\nclassic paper by Haldane and Rezayi [Phys. Rev. B 31, 2529 (1985)].\n", "  A classic problem with intriguing implications at the level of both applied\ndifferential geometry and theoretical physics is dealt with in this short work:\nIs there any criterion in order to decide whether a pseudo-Riemannian space can\nbe locally described using curvature scalars solely? Surprisingly enough, this\nquestion is susceptible of a very simple and elegant answer. In order to avoid\nunnecessary complexity, the analysis is restricted to local rather than global\nconsiderations, without any loss of not only the generality but also the\ninsights to the initial problem.\n", "  The thermal conductivity kappa of the heavy-fermion metal CeCoIn5 was\nmeasured in the normal and superconducting states as a function of temperature\nT and magnetic field H, for a current and field parallel to the [100]\ndirection. Inside the superconducting state, when the field is lower than the\nupper critical field Hc2, kappa/T is found to increase as T approaches absolute\nzero, just as in a metal and in contrast to the behavior of all known\nsuperconductors. This is due to unpaired electrons on part of the Fermi\nsurface, which dominate the transport above a certain field. The evolution of\nkappa/T with field reveals that the electron-electron scattering (or transport\nmass m^*) of those unpaired electrons diverges as H approaches Hc2 from below,\nin the same way that it does in the normal state as H approaches Hc2 from\nabove. This shows that the unpaired electrons sense the proximity of the\nfield-tuned quantum critical point of CeCoIn5 at H^* = Hc2 even from inside the\nsuperconducting state. The fact that the quantum critical scattering of the\nunpaired electrons is much weaker than the average scattering of all electrons\nin the normal state reveals a k-space correlation between the strength of\npairing and the strength of scattering, pointing to a common mechanism,\npresumably antiferromagnetic fluctuations.\n", "  We probe the momentum dependence of the isovector mean-field potential by\ncomparing the energy spectra of neutrons and protons emitted in\n$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn collisions at incident energies\nof E/A=50 and 120 MeV. We achieve experimental precision that discriminates\nbetween different momentum dependencies for the symmetry mean-field potential.\nComparisons of the experimental results to Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics\nmodel calculations with Skyrme Interactions indicate small differences between\nthe neutron and proton effective masses.\n", "  We consider a gauge theory action for continuous spin particles formulated in\na spacetime enlarged by an extra coordinate recently proposed by Schuster and\nToro. It requires one scalar gauge field and has two local symmetries. We show\nthat the local symmetries are reducible in the sense that the parameters also\nhave a local symmetry. Using reducibility we get an action which has two scalar\ngauge fields and a reducible but simpler local symmetry. We then show how this\naction and equations of motion are related to previously proposed formulations\nfor continuous spin particles and higher spin theories. We also discuss the\nphysical contents of each formulation to reveal the physical degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  Electroweak corrections can play a crucial role in dark matter annihilation.\nThe emission of gauge bosons, in particular, leads to a secondary flux\nconsisting of all Standard Model particles, and may be described by electroweak\nfragmentation functions. To assess the quality of the fragmentation function\napproximation to electroweak radiation in dark matter annihilation, we have\ncalculated the flux of secondary particles from gauge-boson emission in models\nwith Majorana fermion and vector dark matter, respectively. For both models, we\nhave compared cross sections and energy spectra of positrons and antiprotons\nafter propagation through the galactic halo in the fragmentation function\napproximation and in the full calculation. Fragmentation functions fail to\ndescribe the particle fluxes in the case of Majorana fermion annihilation into\nlight fermions: the helicity suppression of the lowest-order cross section in\nsuch models cannot be lifted by the leading logarithmic contributions included\nin the fragmentation function approach. However, for other classes of models\nlike vector dark matter, where the lowest-order cross section is not\nsuppressed, electroweak fragmentation functions provide a simple,\nmodel-independent and accurate description of secondary particle fluxes.\n", "  A variety of methods have been proposed to define and to quantify galaxy\nenvironments. While these techniques work well in general with spectroscopic\nredshift samples, their application to photometric redshift surveys remains\nuncertain. To investigate whether galaxy environments can be robustly measured\nwith photo-z samples, we quantify how the density measured with the nearest\nneighbor approach is affected by photo-z uncertainties by using the Durham mock\ngalaxy catalogs in which the 3D real-space environments and the properties of\ngalaxies are exactly known. Furthermore, we present an optimization scheme in\nthe choice of parameters used in the 2D projected measurements which yield the\ntightest correlation with respect to the 3D real-space environments. By\nadopting the optimized parameters in the density measurements, we show that the\ncorrelation between the 2D projected optimized density and real-space density\ncan still be revealed, and the color-density relation is also visible out to $z\n\\sim 0.8$ even for a photo-z uncertainty ($\\sigma_{\\Delta_{z}/(1+z)}$) up to\n0.06. We find that at the redshift $0.3 < z < 0.5$ a deep ($i \\sim 25$)\nphotometric redshift survey with $\\sigma_{\\Delta_{z}/(1+z)} = 0.02$ yields a\ncomparable performance of small-scale density measurement to a shallower $i\n\\sim$ 22.5 spectroscopic sample with $\\sim$ 10% sampling rate. Finally, we\ndiscuss the application of the local density measurements to the Pan-STARRS1\nMedium Deep survey, one of the largest deep optical imaging surveys. Using data\nfrom $\\sim5$ square degrees of survey area, our results show that it is\npossible to measure local density and to probe the color-density relation with\n3$\\sigma$ confidence level out to $z \\sim 0.8$ in the PS-MDS. The color-density\nrelation, however, quickly degrades for data covering smaller areas.\n", "  We present status of the 3-3-1 models and their implications to cosmological\nevolution such as inflation, phase transitions and sphalerons. The models can\ndeal not only with the issues such as neutrino physics, dark matter, etc, but\nthey are also able to provide quite good agreement with the Standard Cosmology:\nthe inflation happens at the GUT scale, while phase transition has two\nsequences corresponding two steps of symmetry breaking in the models, namely:\nSU(3) --> SU(2) and SU(2) --> U(1). Some bounds on the model parameters are\nobtained: in the RM331, the mass of the heavy neutral Higgs boson is fixed in\nthe range: 285.56 GeV <M_{h_2}< 1.746 TeV, and for the doubly charged scalar:\n3.32 TeV <M_{h_{--}}< 5.61 TeV.\n", "  We derive a formula describing the transformation of the Hawking-Hayward\nquasi-local energy under a conformal rescaling of the spacetime metric. A known\nformula for the transformation of the Misner-Sharp-Hernandez mass is recovered\nas a special case.\n", "  This article proposes a topological method that extracts hierarchical\nstructures of various amorphous solids. The method is based on the persistence\ndiagram (PD), a mathematical tool for capturing shapes of multiscale data. The\ninput to the PDs is given by an atomic configuration and the output is\nexpressed as 2D histograms. Then, specific distributions such as curves and\nislands in the PDs identify meaningful shape characteristics of the atomic\nconfiguration. Although the method can be applied to a wide variety of\ndisordered systems, it is applied here to silica glass, the Lennard-Jones\nsystem, and Cu-Zr metallic glass as standard examples of continuous random\nnetwork and random packing structures. In silica glass, the method classified\nthe atomic rings as short-range and medium-range orders and unveiled\nhierarchical ring structures among them. These detailed geometric\ncharacterizations clarified a real space origin of the first sharp diffraction\npeak and also indicated that PDs contain information on elastic response. Even\nin the Lennard-Jones system and Cu-Zr metallic glass, the hierarchical\nstructures in the atomic configurations were derived in a similar way using\nPDs, although the glass structures and properties substantially differ from\nsilica glass. These results suggest that the PDs provide a unified method that\nextracts greater depth of geometric information in amorphous solids than\nconventional methods.\n", "  The Gaussian chain model is the classical description of a polymeric chain,\nwhich provides the analytical results regarding end-to-end distance, the\ndistribution of segments around the mass center of a chain, coarse grained\ninteractions between two chains and effective interactions in binary mixtures.\nThis hierarchy of results can be calculated thanks to the alpha stability of\nthe Gaussian distribution. In this paper we show that it is possible to\ngeneralize the model of Gaussian chain to the entire class of alpha stable\ndistributions, obtaining the analogous hierarchy of results expressed by the\nanalytical closed-form formulas in the Fourier space. This allows us to\nestablish the alpha-stable chain model. We begin with reviewing the\napplications of Levy flights in the context of polymer sciences, which include:\nchains with heavy-tailed distributions of persistence length, polymers adsorbed\nto the surface and the chains driven by a noise with power-law spatial\ncorrelations. Further, we derive the distribution of segments around the mass\ncenter of the alpha-stable chain and the coarse-grained interaction potential\nbetween two chains is constructed. These results are employed to discuss the\nmodel of binary mixture consisting of the alpha-stable chains. On what follows,\nwe establish the spinodal decomposition condition generalized to the particles\ndescribed by the shape of alpha-stable distributions. This condition is finally\napplied to analyze the on-surface phase separation of adsorbed polymers, which\nare known to be described with heavy tailed statistics.\n", "  A mesoscopic model of amorphous plasticity is discussed in the context of\ndepinning models. After embedding in a d + 1 dimensional space, where the\naccumulated plastic strain lives along the additional dimension, the gradual\nplastic deformation of amorphous media can be regarded as the motion of an\nelastic manifold in a disordered landscape. While the associated depinning\ntransition leads to scaling properties, the quadrupolar Eshelby interactions at\nplay in amorphous plasticity induce specific additional features like\nshear-banding and weak ergodicity breakdown. The latters are shown to be\ncontrolled by the existence of soft modes of the elastic interaction, the\nconsequence of which is discussed in the context of depinning.\n", "  The so-called 'raspberry' model refers to the hybrid lattice-Boltzmann (LB)\nand Langevin molecular dynamics scheme for simulating the dynamics of\nsuspensions of colloidal particles, originally developed by [V. Lobaskin and B.\nD\\\"unweg, New J. Phys. 6, 54 (2004)], wherein discrete surface points are used\nto achieve fluid-particle coupling. In this paper, we present a follow up to\nour study of the effectiveness of the raspberry model in reproducing\nhydrodynamic interactions in the Stokes regime for spheres arranged in a\nsimple-cubic crystal [L. Fischer, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 143, 084108 (2015)].\nHere, we consider the accuracy with which the raspberry model is able to\nreproduce such interactions for particles confined between two parallel plates.\nTo this end, we compare our LB simulation results to established theoretical\nexpressions and finite-element calculations. We show that there is a\ndiscrepancy between the translational and rotational mobility when only surface\ncoupling points are used, as also found in Part I of our joint publication. We\ndemonstrate that adding internal coupling points to the raspberry, can be used\nto correct said discrepancy in confining geometries as well. Finally, we show\nthat the raspberry model accurately reproduces hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween a spherical colloid and planar walls up to roughly one LB lattice\nspacing.\n", "  During last years poker has gained a lot of prestige in several countries\nand, beyond to be one of the most famous card games, it represents a modern\nchallenge for scientists belonging to different communities, spanning from\nartificial intelligence to physics and from psychology to mathematics. Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently,\na work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to\nsucceed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions,\nfew irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although\nrationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of\nchallenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly\ninfluence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies\non related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be\nconsidered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must\nbe chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans.\n", "  We study the influence of the fluctuations of a Lorentz invariant and\nconserved vacuum on cosmological metric perturbations, and show that they\ngenerically blow up in the IR. We compute this effect using the\nK\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann spectral representation of stress correlators in generic\nquantum field theories, as well as the holographic bound on their entanglement\nentropy, both leading to an IR cut-off that scales as the fifth power of the\nhighest UV scale (in Planck units). One may view this as analogous to the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle, which is imposed on the phase space of\ngravitational theories by the Einstein constraint equations. The leading effect\non cosmological observables come from anisotropic vacuum stresses which imply:\ni) any extension of the standard model of particle physics can only have masses\n(or resonances) $\\lesssim$ 24 TeV, and ii) perturbative quantum field theory or\nquantum gravity becomes strongly coupled beyond a cut-off scale of\n$\\Lambda\\lesssim1$ PeV. Such a low cut-off is independently motivated by the\nHiggs hierarchy problem. This result, which we dub the cosmological\nnon-constant problem, can be viewed as an extension of the cosmological\nconstant (CC) problem, demonstrating the non-trivial UV-IR coupling and (yet\nanother) limitation of effective field theory in gravity. However, it is more\nsevere than the old CC problem, as vacuum fluctuations cannot be tuned to\ncancel due to the positivity of spectral densities or entropy. We thus predict\nthat future advances in cosmological observations and collider technology will\nsandwich from above and below, and eventually discover, new (non-perturbative)\nphysics beyond the Standard Model within the TeV-PeV energy range.\n", "  Nano-structuring impurity-doped crystals affects the phonon density of states\nand thereby modifies the atomic dynamics induced by interaction with phonons.\nWe propose the use of nano-structured materials in the form of powders or\nphononic bandgap crystals to enable or improve persistent spectral hole-burning\nand coherence for inhomogeneously broadened absorption lines in\nrare-earth-ion-doped crystals. This is crucial for applications such as\nultra-precise radio-frequency spectrum analyzers and optical quantum memories.\nAs an example, we discuss how phonon engineering can enable spectral hole\nburning in erbium-doped materials operating in the convenient telecommunication\nband, and present simulations for density of states of nano-sized powders and\nphononic crystals for the case of Y2SiO5, a widely-used material in current\nquantum memory research.\n", "  The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii $<4\\\nR_\\oplus$, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics,\nformation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary\nmasses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast\nmajority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern\nis therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in this\nEarth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous\nworks have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and\nmass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then\nan intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here\nwe present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation)\nevaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic\ndispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. We analyze how\nthe results depend on the radius range of the sample, and on how the masses\nwere measured. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law\nwith a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that\n$M/M_\\oplus=2.7(R/R_\\oplus)^{1.3}$, a scatter in mass of $1.9\\ M_\\oplus$, and a\nmass constraint to physically plausible densities, is the \"best-fit\"\nprobabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting\nsub-Neptunes ($R_{pl}<4\\ R_\\oplus$). More broadly, this work provides a\nframework for further analyses of the M-R relation and its probable\ndependencies on period and stellar properties.\n", "  In this paper, the isolated horizons with rotation are considered. It is\nshown that the symplectic form is the same as that in the nonrotating case. As\na result, the boundary degrees of freedom can be also described by an SO$(1,1)$\nBF theory. The entropy satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law with the same\nBarbero-Immirzi parameter.\n", "  An optical procedure in the context of continuous variables to verify\nbipartite entanglement without destroying both systems and their entanglement\nis proposed. To perform the nondestructive verification of entanglement, the\nmethod relies on beam-splitter and quantum nondemolition (QND) interactions of\nthe signal modes with two ancillary probe modes. The probe modes are measured\nby homodyne detections, and the obtained information is used to feed forward\nmodulation of signal modes, concluding the procedure. Characterizing the method\nby figures of merit used in QND processes, we can establish the conditions for\nan effectively quantum scheme. Based on such conditions, it is shown that the\nclassical information acquired from the homodyne detections of probe modes is\nsufficient to verify the entanglement of the output signal modes. The\nprocessing impact due to added noise on the output entanglement is assessed in\nthe case of Gaussian modes.\n", "  The discretization of overdamped Langevin dynamics, through schemes such as\nthe Euler-Maruyama method, can be corrected by some acceptance/rejection rule,\nbased on a Metropolis-Hastings criterion for instance. In this case, the\ninvariant measure sampled by the Markov chain is exactly the Boltzmann-Gibbs\nmeasure. However, rejections perturb the dynamical consistency of the resulting\nnumerical method with the reference dynamics. We present in this work some\nmodifications of the standard correction of discretizations of overdamped\nLangevin dynamics on compact spaces by a Metropolis-Hastings procedure, which\nallow us to either improve the strong order of the numerical method, or to\ndecrease the bias in the estimation of transport coefficients characterizing\nthe effective dynamical behavior of the dynamics. For the latter approach, we\nrely on modified numerical schemes together with a Barker rule for the\nacceptance/rejection criterion.\n", "  Particle-vortex duality is a powerful theoretical tool that has been used to\nstudy bosonic systems. Here we propose an analogous duality for Dirac fermions\nin 2+1 dimensions. The physics of a single Dirac cone is proposed to be\ndescribed by a dual theory, QED3 with a dual Dirac fermion coupled to a gauge\nfield. This duality is established by considering two alternate descriptions of\nthe 3d topological insulator (TI) surface. The first description is the usual\nDirac cone surface state. The second description is accessed via an\nelectric-magnetic duality of the bulk TI coupled to a gauge field, which maps\nit to a gauged topological superconductor. This alternate description\nultimately leads to a new surface theory - dual QED3. The dual theory provides\nan explicit derivation of the T-Pfaffian state, a proposed surface topological\norder of the TI, which is simply the paired superfluid state of the dual\nfermions. The roles of time reversal and particle-hole symmetry are exchanged\nby the duality, which connects some of our results to a recent conjecture by\nSon on particle-hole symmetric quantum Hall states.\n", "  The Geometrical Localization mechanism in Randall-sundrum (RS) scenarios is\nextended by considering the coupling between a quadratic mass term and\ngeometrical tensors. Since the quadratic term is symmetric, tensors with two\nsymmetric indices have to be taken into account. These are the Ricci and the\nEinstein tensors. For the Ricci tensor it is shown that a localized zero mode\nexists while that is not possible for the Einstein tensor. It is already known\nthat the Ricci scalar generates a localized solution but the metrics do not.\nTherefore, it can be conclude that divergenceless tensors do not localize the\nzero mode of gauge fields. The result is valid for any warp factor recovering\nthe RS metrics at the boundaries, and therefore is valid for RS I and II\nmodels. We also compute resonances for all couplings. These are calculated\nusing the transfer matrix method. The cases studied consider the standard RS\nwith delta-like branes, and branes generated by kinks and domain-wall as well.\nThe parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. We\nfind that, for all cases considered, geometrical coupling does not generate\nresonances. This enforces similar results for the coupling with the Ricci\nscalar and points to the existence of some unidentified fundamental structure\nof these couplings.\n", "  We propose examples of a hybrid quantum-classical simulation where a\nclassical computer assisted by a small quantum processor can efficiently\nsimulate a larger quantum system. First we consider sparse quantum circuits\nsuch that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any\nsparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits\nand a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Secondly, we\nstudy Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are\nnon-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The\ncomputation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state.\nThis model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show\nthat any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical\nprocessing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Finally, we propose a purely\nclassical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time $2^{c n}\npoly(n)$ where $c\\approx 0.94$. This improves upon the brute-force simulation\nmethod which takes time $2^n poly(n)$. Our algorithm exploits the fact that\nn-fold tensor products of magic states admit a low-rank decomposition into\nn-qubit stabilizer states.\n", "  One of the ubiquitous features of real-life turbulent flows is the existence\nand persistence of coherent vortices. Here we show that such coherent vortices\ncan be extracted as clusters of Lagrangian trajectories. We carry out the\nclustering on a weighted graph, with the weights measuring pairwise distances\nof fluid trajectories in the extended phase space of positions and time. We\nthen extract coherent vortices from the graph using tools from spectral graph\ntheory. Our method locates all coherent vortices in the flow simultaneously,\nthereby showing high potential for automated vortex tracking. We illustrate the\nperformance of this technique by identifying coherent Lagrangian vortices in\nseveral two- and three-dimensional flows.\n", "  We propose a universal inequality that unifies the Bousso bound with the\nclassical focussing theorem. Given a surface $\\sigma$ that need not lie on a\nhorizon, we define a finite generalized entropy $S_\\text{gen}$ as the area of\n$\\sigma$ in Planck units, plus the von Neumann entropy of its exterior. Given a\nnull congruence $N$ orthogonal to $\\sigma$, the rate of change of\n$S_\\text{gen}$ per unit area defines a quantum expansion. We conjecture that\nthe quantum expansion cannot increase along $N$. This extends the notion of\nuniversal focussing to cases where quantum matter may violate the null energy\ncondition. Integrating the conjecture yields a precise version of the\nStrominger-Thompson Quantum Bousso Bound. Applied to locally parallel\nlight-rays, the conjecture implies a Quantum Null Energy Condition: a lower\nbound on the stress tensor in terms of the second derivative of the von Neumann\nentropy. We sketch a proof of this novel relation in quantum field theory.\n", "  We study the formation of longer lived states via internal coupling near a\nspecial avoided resonance crossing between the interacting states in an open\noptical system. Away from PT symmetry limit, we discuss the unconventional\ncavity resonance states created by a spatially varying gain/loss profile. Near\ncertain avoided-resonant crossings (ARC), the parity symmetries of the chosen\ncoupled states dictate the destructive interference resulting high Q, while\navoided crossing in the imaginary part of the poles embraces the longer lived\nstate. Now, via S-matrix formalism, we have numerically demonstrated that with\nsuitably chosen system openness and coupling strengths, the excess noise\ngeneration among the interacting non-orthogonal states (calculated as Petermann\nfactor K) can be suppressed close to the ideal value 1 with simultaneous order\nof magnitude enhancement in Q-factor of the longer lived state.\n", "  We obtain bounds on the stability of various self-gravitating astrophysical\nobjects using a new measure of shape complexity known as configurational\nentropy. We apply the method to Newtonian polytropes, neutron stars with an\nOppenheimer-Volkoff equation of state, and to self-gravitating configurations\nof complex scalar field (boson stars) with different self-couplings, showing\nthat the critical stability region of these stellar configurations obtained\nfrom traditional perturbation methods correlates well with critical points of\nthe configurational entropy with accuracy of a few percent or better.\n", "  In the quantum anomalous Hall effect, chiral edge modes are expected to\nconduct spin polarized current without dissipation and thus hold great promise\nfor future electronics and spintronics with low energy consumption. However,\nspin polarization of chiral edge modes has never been established in\nexperiments. In this work, we theoretically study spin polarization of chiral\nedge modes in the quantum anomalous Hall effect, based on both the effective\nmodel and more realistic tight-binding model constructed from the first\nprinciples calculations. We find that spin polarization can be manipulated by\ntuning either a local gate voltage or the Fermi energy. We also propose to\nextract spin information of chiral edge modes by contacting the quantum\nanomalous Hall insulator to a ferromagnetic (FM) lead. The establishment of\nspin polarization of chiral edge modes, as well as the manipulation and\ndetection in a fully electrical manner, will pave the way to the applications\nof the quantum anomalous Hall effect in spintronics.\n", "  The continuous quantum phase transition between noninteracting, time-reversal\nsymmetric topological and trivial insulators in three dimensions is described\nby the massless Dirac fermion. We address the stability of this quantum\ncritical point against short range electronic interactions by using\nrenormalization group analysis and mean field theory. For sufficiently weak\ninteractions, we show that the nature of the direct transition remains\nunchanged. Beyond a critical strength of interactions we find that either (i)\nthere is a direct first order transition between two time reversal symmetric\ninsulators or (ii) the direct transition is eliminated by an intervening time\nreversal and inversion odd \"axionic\" insulator. We also demonstrate the\nexistence of an interaction driven first order quantum phase transition between\ntopological and trivial gapped states in lower dimensions.\n", "  We employ very high resolution simulations of isolated Milky Way-like\ngalaxies to study the effect of triaxial dark matter haloes on exponential\nstellar discs. Non-adiabatic halo shape changes can trigger two-armed\ngrand-design spiral structures which extend all the way to the edge of the\ndisc. Their pattern speed coincides with the inner Lindblad resonance\nindicating that they are kinematic density waves which can persist up to\nseveral Gyr. In dynamically cold discs, grand-design spirals are swing\namplified and after a few Gyr can lead to the formation of (multi-armed)\ntransient recurrent spirals. Stellar discs misaligned to the principal planes\nof the host triaxial halo develop characteristic integral shaped warps, but\notherwise exhibit very similar spiral structures as aligned discs. For the\ngrand-design spirals in our simulations, their strength dependence with radius\nis determined by the torque on the disc, suggesting that by studying\ngrand-design spirals without bars it may be possible to set constraints on the\ntidal field and host dark matter halo shape.\n", "  We present galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) at $z=$ 4-8 from a\nrest-frame ultraviolet (UV) selected sample of $\\sim$4500 galaxies, found via\nphotometric redshifts over an area of $\\sim$280 arcmin$^2$ in the CANDELS/GOODS\nfields and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The deepest Spitzer/IRAC data\nyet-to-date and the relatively large volume allow us to place a better\nconstraint at both the low- and high-mass ends of the GSMFs compared to\nprevious space-based studies from pre-CANDELS observations. Supplemented by a\nstacking analysis, we find a linear correlation between the rest-frame UV\nabsolute magnitude at 1500 \\AA\\ ($M_{\\rm UV}$) and logarithmic stellar mass\n($\\log M_*$) that holds for galaxies with $\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot}) \\lesssim 10$. We\nuse simulations to validate our method of measuring the slope of the $\\log\nM_*$-$M_{\\rm UV}$ relation, finding that the bias is minimized with a hybrid\ntechnique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with stacked\nphotometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do not\nsignificantly evolve over $z=$ 4-8, while the normalization of the trend\nexhibits a weak evolution toward lower masses at higher redshift. We combine\nthe $\\log M_*$-$M_{\\rm UV}$ distribution with observed rest-frame UV luminosity\nfunctions at each redshift to derive the GSMFs, finding that the low-mass-end\nslope becomes steeper with increasing redshift from\n$\\alpha=-1.55^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ at $z=4$ to $\\alpha=-2.25^{+0.72}_{-0.35}$ at\n$z=8$. The inferred stellar mass density, when integrated over\n$M_*=10^8$-$10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, increases by a factor of $10^{+30}_{-2}$\nbetween $z=7$ and $z=4$ and is in good agreement with the time integral of the\ncosmic star formation rate density.\n", "  We analyze the Stern-Gerlach experiment in phase space with the help of the\nmatrix Wigner function, which includes the spin degree of freedom. Such\nanalysis allows for an intuitive visualization of the quantum dynamics of the\napparatus. We include the interaction with the environment, as described by the\nCaldeira-Leggett model. The diagonal terms of the matrix provide us with\ninformation about the two components of the state, that arise from interaction\nwith the magnetic field gradient. In particular, from the marginals of these\ncomponents, we obtain an analytical formula for the position and momentum\nprobability distributions in presence of decoherence, that show a diffusive\nbehavior for large values of the decoherence parameter. These features limit\nthe dynamics of the present model. We also observe the decay of the\nnon-diagonal terms with time, and use this fact to quantify the amount of\ndecoherence, from the norm of those terms in phase space. From here, we can\ndefine a decoherence time scale, which differs from previous results that make\nuse of the same model.\n", "  For macroscopic quantum systems, we study what are measured when equilibrium\nfluctuations of macrovariables are measured in an ideal way that mimics\nclassical ideal measurements as closely as possible. We find that the\nsymmetrized time correlation (symTC) is always obtained for such measurements.\nAs an important consequence, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\n(FDT) is partially violated as a relation between observed quantities in\nmacroscopic quantum systems even if measurements are made in such an ideal way.\n", "  Purpose: For Monte Carlo simulation of radiotherapy, x-ray CT number of every\nsystem needs to be calibrated and converted to mass density and elemental\ncomposition. This study aims to formulate material properties of body tissues\nfor practical two-step conversion from CT number. Methods: We used the latest\ncompilation on body tissues that constitute reference adult male and female. We\nformulated the relations among mass, electron, and elemental densities into\npolylines to connect representative tissues, for which we took mass-weighted\nmean for the tissues in limited density regions. We compared the polyline\nfunctions of mass density with a bi-line for electron density and broken lines\nfor elemental densities, which were derived from preceding studies. Results:\nThere was generally high correlation between mass density and the other\ndensities except of C, N, and O for light spongiosa tissues occupying 1% of\nbody mass. The polylines fitted to the dominant tissues and were generally\nconsistent with the bi-line and the broken lines. Conclusions: We have\nformulated the invariant relations between mass and electron densities and from\nmass to elemental densities for body tissues. The formulation enables Monte\nCarlo simulation in treatment planning practice without additional burden with\nCT-number calibration.\n", "  We provide a new efficient adaptive algorithm for performing phase estimation\nthat does not require that the user infer the bits of the eigenphase in reverse\norder; rather it directly infers the phase and estimates the uncertainty in the\nphase directly from experimental data. Our method is highly flexible, recovers\nfrom failures, and can be run in the presence of substantial decoherence and\nother experimental imperfections and is as fast or faster than existing\nalgorithms.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to find operator algebra variants of certain\ndeep results of Stormer, Friedman and Russo, Choi and Effros, Effros and\nStormer, Robertson and Youngson, Youngson, and others, concerning projections\non C*-algebras and their ranges. (See papers of these authors referenced in the\nbibliography.) In particular we investigate the `bicontractive projection\nproblem' and related questions in the category of operator algebras. To do\nthis, we will add the ingredient of `real positivity' from recent papers of the\nfirst author with Read.\n", "  The relation between the Star Formation Rate (SFR) and stellar mass (${\\rm\nM}_{\\star}$) of galaxies represents a fundamental constraint on galaxy\nformation and has been studied extensively both in observations and\ncosmological simulations. However, the observed amplitude has not been\nsuccessfully reproduced in simulations, indicating either that the halo\naccretion history and baryonic physics are poorly modeled or that observations\ncontain biases. We examine the evolution of the SFR$-{\\rm M}_{\\star}$ relation\nof $z\\sim1-4 $ galaxies and display the inconsistency between observed\nrelations that are obtained using different techniques. We employ cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations and compare these with a range of observed SFR$-{\\rm\nM}_{\\star}$ relations. We find that numerical results are consistent with\nobservations that use Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) techniques to estimate\nstar formation rates and dust corrections. On the contrary, simulations are not\nable to reproduce results that were obtained by combining only UV and IR\nluminosities. These imply SFRs at a fixed stellar mass that are larger almost\nby a factor of 5 than those of SED measurements for $z \\sim1.5-4$. Furthermore,\nwe find remarkable agreement between the numerical results from various authors\nwho have employed different cosmological codes and run simulations with\ndifferent resolutions. This is interesting for two reasons. A) simulations can\nproduce realistic populations of galaxies within representative cosmological\nvolumes even at relatively modest resolutions. B) It is likely that current\nnumerical codes that rely on similar subgrid multiphase Inter-Stellar Medium\n(ISM) models and are tuned to reproduce statistical properties of galaxies,\nproduce similar results for the SFR$-{\\rm M}_{\\star}$ relation by construction,\nregardless of resolution, box size and, to some extent, the adopted feedback\nprescriptions.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the mean-field limit for the gradient flow\nevolution of particle systems with pairwise Riesz interactions, as the number\nof particles tends to infinity. Based on a modulated energy method, using\nregularity and stability properties of the limiting equation, as inspired by\nthe work of Serfaty in the context of the Ginzburg-Landau vortices, we prove a\nmean-field limit result in dimensions 1 and 2 in cases for which this problem\nwas still open.\n", "  Studying event time series is a powerful approach for analyzing the dynamics\nof complex dynamical systems in many fields of science. In this paper, we\ndescribe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for\nquantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical\ninterrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to\nformulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed\ninterrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more\ngenerally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time\ndistribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to\ncountry-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted\nas triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected\nfuture changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical\ntechniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for\ninvestigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies\nand ecosystems worldwide.\n", "  We explore a long Josephson contact transporting Cooper pairs between 1D\ncharge-neutral chiral Majorana modes in the leads via charged Dirac chiral\nmodes in the normal region. We investigate the regimes of (i) transparent\ncontacts and (ii) tunnel junctions implemented in 3D topological\ninsulator/superconductor/magnet hybrid structures. The setup acts as a SQUID\ncontrolled by the magnetic flux enclosed by the chiral loop of the normal\nregion. This chirality leads to the fractional $h/e$-periodic pattern of\ncritical current. The current-phase relation can have sawtooth-like shape with\nspikes at unusual even phases of $2\\pi n$.\n", "  The stellar population of the Milky Way bulge is thoroughly studied, with a\nplethora of measurements from virtually the full suite of instruments available\nto astronomers. It is thus perhaps surprising that alongside well-established\nresults lies some substantial uncertainty in its star-formation history.\nCosmological models predict the bulge to host the Galaxy's oldest stars for\n[Fe/H]$\\lesssim -1$, and this is demonstrated by RR Lyrae stars and globular\ncluster observations. There is consensus that bulge stars with\n[Fe/H]$\\lesssim0$ are older than $t \\approx10$ Gyr. However, at super-solar\nmetallicity, there is a substantial unresolved discrepancy. Data from\nspectroscopic measurements of the main-sequence turnoff and subgiant branch,\nthe abundances of asymptotic giant branch stars, the period distribution of\nMira variables, the chemistry and central-star masses of planetary nebulae, all\nsuggest a substantial intermediate-age population ($t \\approx 3$ Gyr). This is\nin conflict with predictions from cosmologically-motivated chemical evolution\nmodels and photometric studies of the main-sequence turnoff region, which both\nsuggest virtually no stars younger than $t \\approx 8$ Gyr. A possible\nresolution to this conflict is enhanced helium-enrichment, as this would shift\nnearly all of the age estimates in the direction of decreasing discrepancy.\nEnhanced helium-enrichment is also arguably suggested by measurements of the\nred giant branch bump and the R-parameter.\n", "  This paper presents the measured sensitivity of CSIRO's first Mk. II phased\narray feed (PAF) on an ASKAP antenna. The Mk. II achieves a minimum\nsystem-temperature-over-efficiency $T_\\mathrm{sys}/\\eta$ of 78 K at 1.23 GHz\nand is 95 K or better from 835 MHz to 1.8 GHz. This PAF was designed for the\nAustralian SKA Pathfinder telescope to demonstrate fast astronomical surveys\nwith a wide field of view for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).\n", "  One-electron self-interaction and an incorrect asymptotic behavior of the\nKohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential are among the most prominent\nlimitations of many present-day density functionals. However, a one-electron\nself-interaction-free energy does not necessarily lead to the correct\nlong-range potential. This is here shown explicitly for local hybrid\nfunctionals. Furthermore, carefully studying the ratio of the von Weizs\\\"acker\nkinetic energy density to the (positive) Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density,\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{W}/\\tau$, reveals that this ratio, which frequently serves as an\niso-orbital indicator and is used to eliminate one-electron self-interaction\neffects in meta-generalized-gradient approximations and local hybrid\nfunctionals, can fail to approach its expected value in the vicinity of orbital\nnodal planes. This perspective article suggests that the nature and\nconsequences of one-electron self-interaction and some of the strategies for\nits correction need to be reconsidered.\n", "  In the framework of the concordance cosmological model the first-order scalar\nand vector perturbations of the homogeneous background are derived in the weak\ngravitational field limit without any supplementary approximations. The sources\nof these perturbations (inhomogeneities) are presented in the discrete form of\na system of separate point-like gravitating masses. The found expressions for\nthe metric corrections are valid at all (sub-horizon and super-horizon) scales\nand converge at all points except at locations of the sources. The average\nvalues of these metric corrections are zero (thus, first-order backreaction\neffects are absent). Both the Minkowski background limit and the Newtonian\ncosmological approximation are reached under certain well-defined conditions.\nAn important feature of the velocity-independent part of the scalar\nperturbation is revealed: up to an additive constant this part represents a sum\nof Yukawa potentials produced by inhomogeneities with the same finite\ntime-dependent Yukawa interaction range. The suggested connection between this\nrange and the homogeneity scale is briefly discussed along with other possible\nphysical implications.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate robust selective excitation and attenuation of\natomic Rydberg level populations in sodium vapor (Na I) using intense laser\npulses in the strong field limit ($> 10^{12} W/cm^{2}$). The coherent control\nof the atomic population and related ionization channels is realized for\nintensities above the over-the-barrier ionization intensity. A qualitative\nmodel predicts that this strong field coherent control arises through the\nmanifestation of a Freeman resonance.\n", "  We define the entropy operator as the negative of the logarithm of the\ndensity matrix, give a prescription for extracting its thermodynamically\nmeasurable part, and discuss its dynamics. For an isolated system we derive the\nfirst, second and third laws of thermodynamics. For weakly-coupled subsystems\nof an isolated system, an expression for the long time limit of the expectation\nvalue of the rate of change of the thermodynamically measurable part of the\nentropy operator is derived and interpreted in terms of entropy production and\nentropy transport terms. The interpretation is justified by comparison to the\nknown expression for the entropy production in an aged classical Markovian\nsystem with Gaussian fluctuations and by a calculation of the current-induced\nentropy production in a conductor with electron-phonon scattering.\n", "  We report on a study of the exchange tunneling reaction\nD+HD$\\rightarrow$D$_{2}$+H in a pure solid HD matrix and in a D$_{2}$ matrix\nwith 0.23$\\%$ HD admixture at temperatures between 130$\\,$mK and 1.5$\\,$K. We\nfound that the exchange reaction rates,\n$k_{exHD}\\sim3\\times10^{-27}$cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ in the pure HD matrix, and\n$k_{exD_{2}}=9(4)\\times10^{-28}$cm$^{-3}$ in the D$_{2}$ matrix are nearly\nindependent of temperature within this range. This confirms quantum tunnelling\nnature of these reactions, and their ability to proceed at temperatures down to\nabsolute zero. Based on these observations we concluded that exchange tunneling\nreaction H+H$_{2}\\rightarrow$H$_{2}$+H should also proceed in a H$_{2}$ matrix\nat the lowest temperatures. On contrary, the recombination of H atoms in solid\nH$_{2}$ and D atoms in solid D$_{2}$ is substantially suppressed at the lowest\ntemperatures as a result of increasing of violation for resonance tunneling of\natoms when they approach each other.\n", "  Axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons inter-convert in the presence of a\nmagnetic field. At keV energies in the environment of galaxy clusters, the\nconversion probability can become unsuppressed for light ALPs. Conversion of\nthermal X-ray photons into ALPs can introduce a step-like feature into the\ncluster thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum, and we argue that existing X-ray data\non galaxy clusters should be sufficient to extend bounds on ALPs in the\nlow-mass region $m_a \\lesssim 1 \\times 10^{-12}\\,{\\rm eV}$ down to $M \\sim\n7\\times 10^{11}\\, {\\rm GeV}$, and that for $10^{11}\\, {\\rm GeV} < M \\lesssim\n10^{12}$ GeV light ALPs give rise to interesting and unique observational\nsignatures that may be probed by existing and upcoming X-ray (and potentially\nX-ray polarisation) observations of galaxy clusters.\n", "  Networks with nodes embedded in a metric space have gained increasing\ninterest in recent years. The effects of spatial embedding on the networks'\nstructural characteristics, however, are rarely taken into account when\nstudying their macroscopic properties. Here, we propose a hierarchy of null\nmodels to generate random surrogates from a given spatially embedded network\nthat can preserve global and local statistics associated with the nodes'\nembedding in a metric space. Comparing the original network's and the resulting\nsurrogates' global characteristics allows to quantify to what extent these\ncharacteristics are already predetermined by the spatial embedding of the nodes\nand links. We apply our framework to various real-world spatial networks and\nshow that the proposed models capture macroscopic properties of the networks\nunder study much better than standard random network models that do not account\nfor the nodes' spatial embedding. Depending on the actual performance of the\nproposed null models, the networks are categorized into different classes.\nSince many real-world complex networks are in fact spatial networks, the\nproposed approach is relevant for disentangling underlying complex system\nstructure from spatial embedding of nodes in many fields, ranging from social\nsystems over infrastructure and neurophysiology to climatology.\n", "  We expand our previous study on the relationship between changes in the\norientation of the angular momentum vector of dark matter haloes (\"spin flips\")\nand changes in their mass (Bett & Frenk 2012), to cover the full range of halo\nmasses in a simulation cube of length 100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Since strong\ndisturbances to a halo (such as might be indicated by a large change in the\nspin direction) are likely also to disturb the galaxy evolving within, spin\nflips could be a mechanism for galaxy morphological transformation without\ninvolving major mergers. We find that 35% of haloes have, at some point in\ntheir lifetimes, had a spin flip of at least $45\\deg$ that does not coincide\nwith a major merger. Over 75% of large spin flips coincide with non-major\nmergers; only a quarter coincide with major mergers. We find a similar picture\nfor changes to the inner-halo spin orientation, although here there is an\nincreased likelihood of a flip occurring. Changes in halo angular momentum\norientation, and other such measures of halo perturbation, are therefore very\nimportant quantities to consider, in addition to halo mergers, when modelling\nthe formation and evolution of galaxies and confronting such models with\nobservations.\n", "  We report on the mass and distance measurements of two single-lens events\nfrom the 2015 \\emph{Spitzer} microlensing campaign. With both finite-source\neffect and microlens parallax measurements, we find that the lens of\nOGLE-2015-BLG-1268 is very likely a brown dwarf. Assuming that the source star\nlies behind the same amount of dust as the Bulge red clump, we find the lens is\na $45\\pm7$ $M_{\\rm J}$ brown dwarf at $5.9\\pm1.0$ kpc. The lens of of the\nsecond event, OGLE-2015-BLG-0763, is a $0.50\\pm0.04$ $M_\\odot$ star at\n$6.9\\pm1.0$ kpc. We show that the probability to definitively measure the mass\nof isolated microlenses is dramatically increased once simultaneous ground- and\nspace-based observations are conducted.\n", "  We propose a minimal vector-like leptonic dark matter (DM) with\nrenormalisable interaction in a beyond the Standard Model (SM) scenario, where\nthe SM is augmented with a vector-like doublet and a singlet leptons. The\nadditional fermions are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry, while the rest of\nthe SM particles are singlets, and thus providing stability to the DM. In this\nscenario, we show that, the DM emerges as an admixture of the neutral component\nof the vector-like doublet and the singlet leptons. The singlet-doublet mixing\n($\\sin \\theta$) plays a crucial role in yielding the correct relic density as\nwell as in obtaining null direct DM search results through an interplay of\ninteractions via $Z$ and Higgs mediation. The mixing is also strongly\nconstrained from the invisible Z and Higgs decay width. We found that the\ncorrect relic abundance of DM can be obtained in a large region of parameter\nspace for DM-mass larger than $ M_Z/2$ and $\\sin \\theta \\le 0.1$. The details\nof model phenomenology with collider signatures at the Large hadron Collider\n(LHC) are discussed. In particular, we show that for $\\sin \\theta \\le 0.01$,\nthe charged companion of the DM can give rise to an observable displaced vertex\nsignature, marking a significant departure from other fermionic DM scenarios,\nwhile keeping the relic abundance intact.\n", "  The force network of a granular assembly, defined by the contact network and\nthe corresponding contact forces, carries valuable information about the state\nof the packing. Simple analysis of these networks based on the distribution of\nforce strengths is rather insensitive to the changes in preparation protocols\nor to the types of particles. In this paper we consider two dimensional\nsimulations of tapped systems built from frictional disks and pentagons, and\nstudy the structure of the force networks of granular packings by considering\nnetwork's topology as force thresholds are varied. We show that the number of\nclusters and loops observed in the force networks as a function of the force\nthreshold are markedly different for disks and pentagons if the tangential\ncontact forces are considered, whereas they are surprisingly similar for the\nnetwork defined by the normal forces. In particular, the results indicate that,\noverall, the force network is more heterogeneous for disks than for pentagons.\nAdditionally, we show that the states obtained by tapping with different\nintensities that display similar packing fraction are difficult to distinguish\nbased on simple topological invariants.\n", "  The compressibility of molecular cloud (MC) turbulence plays a crucial role\nin star formation models, because it controls the amplitude and distribution of\ndensity fluctuations. The relation between the compressive ratio (the ratio of\npowers in compressive and solenoidal motions) and the statistics of turbulence\nhas been previously studied systematically only in idealized simulations with\nrandom external forces. In this work, we analyze a simulation of large-scale\nturbulence (250 pc) driven by supernova (SN) explosions that has been shown to\nyield realistic MC properties. We demonstrate that SN driving results in MC\nturbulence with a broad lognormal distribution of the compressive ratio, with a\nmean value $\\approx 0.3$, lower than the equilibrium value of $\\approx 0.5$\nfound in the inertial range of isothermal simulations with random solenoidal\ndriving. We also find that the compressibility of the turbulence is not\nnoticeably affected by gravity, nor are the mean cloud radial (expansion or\ncontraction) and solid-body rotation velocities. Furthermore, the clouds follow\na general relation between the rms density and the rms Mach number similar to\nthat of supersonic isothermal turbulence, though with a large scatter, and\ntheir average gas density PDF is described well by a lognormal distribution,\nwith the addition of a high-density power-law tail when self-gravity is\nincluded.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of creating X-waves, or localized wave\npackets, in resonantly excited exciton-polariton superfluids. We demonstrate\nthe existence of X-wave traveling solutions in the coupled exciton-photon\nsystem past the inflection point, where the effective mass of lower polaritons\nis negative in the direction perpendicular to the wavevector of the pumping\nbeam. Contrary to the case of bright solitons, X-waves do not require\nnonlinearity for sustaining their shape. Nevertheless, we show that\nnonlinearity is important for their dynamics, as it allows for their\nspontaneous formation from an initial Gaussian wave packet. Unique properties\nof exciton-polaritons may lead to applications of their X-waves in\nlong-distance signal propagation inside novel integrated optoelectronic\ncircuits based on excitons.\n", "  Subvacuum phenomena on a massive particle induced by a squeezed vacuum state\nof strongly coupled critical fields with a dynamical scaling $z$ are studied by\nemploying the holographic approach. The corresponding dual description is the\nstring moving in the 4+1-dimensional Lifshitz geometry. The squeezed vacuum\nstate is constructed from the Bogoliubov transformations of the creation and\nannihilation operators of the pure vacuum state as a result from the perturbed\ngeometry. Then the influence on particle's velocity dispersion from the\nsqueezed vacuum is studied. With appropriate choices of squeezing parameters,\nthe velocity dispersion is found smaller than the value caused by the normal\nvacuum fluctuations. This leads to a subvacuum effect. We find that the\nreduction in the velocity dispersion is suppressed by a large coupling constant\nof quantum critical fields, but is in principle observable. We then investigate\nthe effect of the squeezed vacuum to the decoherence dynamics of a quantum\nparticle. It is found possible for this decoherence to be below the level from\nthe pure vacuum, rendering another subvacuum phenomenon of recoherence. We make\nsome estimates of the degree of recoherence, and show that, in contrary to the\nvelocity dispersion, the recoherence effect is proportional to the large\ncoupling constant, and can potentially be observed. Finally we make a\ncomparison with the effect on the particle influenced by a relativistic free\nfield with the dynamical scaling $z=1$.\n", "  A view of the Galactic bulge by means of their globular clusters is necessary\nfor a deep understanding of its formation and evolution. Connections between\nthe globular cluster and field star properties in terms of kinematics, orbits,\nchemical abundances and ages should shed light on different stellar population\ncomponents. Based on spatial distribution and metallicity, we define a probable\nbest list of bulge clusters, containing 43 entries. Future work on newly\ndiscovered objects, mostly from the VVV survey, is suggested. These candidates\nmight alleviate the issue of missing clusters on the far side of the bulge. We\ndiscuss the reddening law affecting the cluster distances towards the center of\nthe Galaxy, and conclude that the most suitable total-to-selective absorption\nvalue appears to be R$_{\\rm V}$=3.2, in agreement with recent analyses. An\nupdate of elemental abundances for bulge clusters is provided.\n", "  The Magellanic Clouds provide the only laboratory to study the effect of\nmetallicity and galaxy mass on molecular gas and star formation at high (~20\npc) resolution. We use the dust emission from HERITAGE Herschel data to map the\nmolecular gas in the Magellanic Clouds, avoiding the known biases of CO\nemission as a tracer of H$_{2}$. Using our dust-based molecular gas estimates,\nwe find molecular gas depletion times of ~0.4 Gyr in the LMC and ~0.6 SMC at 1\nkpc scales. These depletion times fall within the range found for normal disk\ngalaxies, but are shorter than the average value, which could be due to recent\nbursts in star formation. We find no evidence for a strong intrinsic dependence\nof the molecular gas depletion time on metallicity. We study the relationship\nbetween gas and star formation rate across a range in size scales from 20 pc to\n~1 kpc, including how the scatter in molecular gas depletion time changes with\nsize scale, and discuss the physical mechanisms driving the relationships. We\ncompare the metallicity-dependent star formation models of Ostriker, McKee, and\nLeroy (2010) and Krumholz (2013) to our observations and find that they both\npredict the trend in the data, suggesting that the inclusion of a diffuse\nneutral medium is important at lower metallicity.\n", "  Microwave photons inside lattices of coupled resonators and superconducting\nqubits can exhibit surprising matter-like behavior. Realizing such open-system\nquantum simulators presents an experimental challenge and requires new tools\nand measurement techniques. Here, we introduce Scanning Defect Microscopy as\none such tool and illustrate its use in mapping the normal-mode structure of\nmicrowave photons inside a 49-site Kagome lattice of coplanar waveguide\nresonators. Scanning is accomplished by moving a probe equipped with a sapphire\ntip across the lattice. This locally perturbs resonator frequencies and induces\nshifts of the lattice resonance frequencies which we determine by measuring the\ntransmission spectrum. From the magnitude of mode shifts we can reconstruct\nphoton field amplitudes at each lattice site and thus create spatial images of\nthe photon-lattice normal modes.\n", "  We explicitly derive the duality between a free electronic Dirac cone and\nquantum electrodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions (QED$_3$) with $N = 1$ fermion\nflavors. The duality proceeds via an exact, non-local mapping from electrons to\ndual fermions with long-range interactions encoded by an emergent gauge field.\nThis mapping allows us to construct parent Hamiltonians for exotic\ntopological-insulator surface phases, derive the particle-hole-symmetric field\ntheory of a half-filled Landau level, and nontrivially constrain QED$_3$\nscaling dimensions. We similarly establish duality between bosonic topological\ninsulator surfaces and $N = 2$ QED$_3$.\n", "  Strong Brillouin coupling has only recently been realized in silicon using a\nnew class of optomechanical waveguides that yield both optical and phononic\nconfinement. Despite these major advances, appreciable Brillouin amplification\nhas yet to be observed in silicon. Using a new membrane-suspended silicon\nwaveguide we report large Brillouin amplification for the first time, reaching\nlevels greater than 5 dB for modest pump powers, and demonstrate a record low\n(5 mW) threshold for net amplification. This work represents a crucial advance\nnecessary to realize high-performance Brillouin lasers and amplifiers in\nsilicon.\n", "  Lyapunov exponents, a purely classical quantity, play an important role in\nthe evolution of quantum chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. We\nconjecture the existence of an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponents that\ncontribute to the quantum motion, namely, even in the semiclassical limit only\na limited range of Lyapunov exponents, bounded from above, are important for\nthe quantum evolution. This is a universal feature in any quantum system or\nquantum field theory, including those with a gravity dual. It has its origin in\nthe finite size of the Hilbert space that is available to an initial\nquasi-classical configuration. An upper bound also exists in the limit of an\ninfinite Hilbert space provided that the system is in contact with an\nenvironment, for instance a thermal bath. An important consequence of this\nresult is a universal quantum bound on the maximum growth rate of the\nentanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature.\n", "  The link of two concepts, indistinguishability and entanglement, with the\nenergy-time uncertainty principle is demonstrated in a system composed of two\nstrongly coupled bosonic modes. Working in the limit of a short interaction\ntime, we find that the inclusion of the antiresonant terms to the coupling\nHamiltonian leads the system to relax to a state which is not the ground state\nof the system. This effect occurs passively by just presence of the\nantiresonant terms and is explained in terms of the time-energy uncertainty\nprinciple for the simple reason that at a very short interaction time, the\nuncertainty in the energy is of order of the energy of a single excitation,\nthereby leading to a distribution of the population among the zero, singly and\ndoubly excited states. The population distribution, correlations and\nentanglement are shown to be substantially depend on whether the modes decay\nindependently or collectively to an exterior reservoir. In particular, when the\nmodes decay independently with equal rates, entanglement with the complete\ndistinguishability of the modes is observed. The modes can be made mutually\ncoherent if they decay with unequal rates. However, the visibility in the\nsingle-photon interference cannot exceed $50\\%$. When the modes experience\ncollective damping, they are indistinguishable even if decay with equal rates\nand the visibility can, in principle, be as large as unity. We find that this\nfeature derives from the decay of the system to a pure entangled state rather\nthan the expected mixed state. When the modes decay with equal rates, the\nsteady-state values of the density matrix elements are found dependent on their\ninitial values.\n", "  We study Hawking radiation of Dirac particles with spin-$1/2$ as a tunneling\nprocess from Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter black\nholes in background spacetimes with a spinning cosmic string and a global\nmonopole. Solving Dirac's equation by employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method and\nWKB approximation we find the corresponding tunneling probabilities and the\nHawking temperature. Furthermore, we show that the Hawking temperature of those\nblack holes remains unchanged in presence of topological defects in both cases.\n", "  The $\\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities of neutron rich Hg and Tl\nnuclei have been measured together with $\\beta$-decay half-lives for 20\nisotopes of Au, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi in the mass region N$\\gtrsim$126. These are\nthe heaviest species where neutron emission has been observed so far. These\nmeasurements provide key information to evaluate the performance of nuclear\nmicroscopic and phenomenological models in reproducing the high-energy part of\nthe $\\beta$-decay strength distribution. In doing so, it provides important\nconstraints to global theoretical models currently used in $r$-process\nnucleosynthesis.\n", "  We present first results from a LOFAR census of non-recycled pulsars. The\ncensus includes almost all such pulsars known (194 sources) at declinations\n${\\rm Dec}> 8^\\circ$ and Galactic latitudes $|{\\rm Gb}| > 3^\\circ$, regardless\nof their expected flux densities and scattering times. Each pulsar was observed\nfor $\\geq 20$ minutes in the contiguous frequency range of 110--188 MHz.\nFull-Stokes data were recorded. We present the dispersion measures, flux\ndensities, and calibrated total intensity profiles for the 158 pulsars detected\nin the sample. The median uncertainty in census dispersion measures ($1.5\n\\times 10^{-3}$ pc cm$^{-3}$) is ten times smaller, on average, than in the\nATNF pulsar catalogue. We combined census flux densities with those in the\nliterature and fitted the resulting broadband spectra with single or broken\npower-law functions. For 48 census pulsars such fits are being published for\nthe first time. Typically, the choice between single and broken power-laws, as\nwell as the location of the spectral break, were highly influenced by the\nspectral coverage of the available flux density measurements. In particular,\nthe inclusion of measurements below 100 MHz appears essential for investigating\nthe low-frequency turnover in the spectra for most of the census pulsars. For\nseveral pulsars, we compared the spectral indices from different works and\nfound the typical spread of values to be within 0.5--1.5, suggesting a\nprevailing underestimation of spectral index errors in the literature. The\ncensus observations yielded some unexpected individual source results, as we\ndescribe in the paper. Lastly, we will provide this unique sample of wide-band,\nlow-frequency pulse profiles via the European Pulsar Network Database.\n", "  Many alternatives to canonical slow-roll inflation have been proposed over\nthe years, one of the main motivations being to have a model, capable of\ngenerating observable values of non-Gaussianity. In this work, we (re-)explore\nthe physical implications of a great majority of such models within a single,\neffective field theory framework (including novel models with large\nnon-Gaussianity discussed for the first time below.) The constraints we\napply---both theoretical and experimental---are found to be rather robust,\ndetermined to a great extent by just three parameters: the coefficients of the\nquadratic EFT operators $(\\delta N)^2$ and $\\delta N \\delta E$, and the\nslow-roll parameter $\\varepsilon$. This allows to significantly limit the\nmajority of single-field alternatives to canonical slow-roll inflation. While\nthe existing data still leaves some room for most of the considered models, the\nsituation would change dramatically if the current upper limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio decreased down to $r < 10^{-2}$. Apart from inflationary\nmodels driven by plateau-like potentials, the single-field model that would\nhave a chance of surviving this bound is the recently proposed slow-roll\ninflation with weakly-broken galileon symmetry. In contrast to\n\\textit{canonical} slow-roll inflation, the latter model can support $r <\n10^{-2}$ even if driven by a convex potential, as well as generate observable\nvalues for the amplitude of non-Gaussianity.\n", "  We show clear evidence of a quadratic speedup of a quantum annealing (QA)\nSchroedinger dynamics over a Glauber master-equation simulated annealing (SA)\nfor a random Ising model in one dimension, via an equal-footing exact\ndeterministic dynamics of the Jordan-Wigner fermionized problems. This is\nremarkable, in view of the arguments of Katzgraber et al., PRX 4, 021008\n(2014), since SA does not encounter any phase transition, while QA does. We\nalso find a second remarkable result: that a \"quantum-inspired\" imaginary-time\nSchroedinger QA provides a further exponential speedup, i.e., an asymptotic\nresidual error decreasing as a power-law $\\tau^{-\\mu}$ of the annealing time\n$\\tau$.\n", "  We report a structural study of the Weyl semimetals TaAs, TaP, NbP, and NbAs,\nutilizing diffraction techniques (single crystal x-ray diffraction and energy\ndispersive spectroscopy) and imaging techniques (transmission electron\nmicroscopy/scanning transmission electron microscopy). We observe defects of\nvarious degrees, leading to non-stoichiometric single crystals of all four\nsemimetals. While TaP displays a large pnictide deficiency with composition\nTaP$_{0.83(3)}$, and stacking faults accompanied by anti-site disorder and site\nvacancies, TaAs displays transition metal deficiency with composition\nTa$_{0.92(2)}$As and a high density of stacking faults. NbP also displays\npnictide deficiency, yielding composition NbP$_{0.95(2)}$, and lastly, NbAs\ndisplay very little deviation from a 1:1 composition, NbAs$_{1.00(3)}$, and is\ntherefore recommended to serve as the model compound for these semimetals.\n", "  (Abridged) Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to be associated with\npowerful shock fronts that originate during cluster mergers, and are a testbed\nfor the acceleration of relativistic particles in the intracluster medium.\nRecently, radio relic observations have pushed into the cm-wavelength domain\n(1-30 GHz) where a break from the standard synchrotron power-law spectrum has\nbeen found, most noticeably in the famous 'Sausage' relic. In this paper, we\npoint to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant\nwhile interpreting these new high-frequency radio data, namely the\ncontamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect that changes the\nobserved synchrotron flux. Even though the radio relics reside in the cluster\noutskirts, the shock-driven pressure boost increases the SZ signal locally by\nroughly an order of magnitude. The resulting flux contamination for some\nwell-known relics are non-negligible already at 10 GHz, and at 30 GHz the\nobserved synchrotron fluxes can be diminished by a factor of several from their\ntrue values. Interferometric observations are not immune to this contamination,\nsince the change in the SZ signal occurs roughly at the same length scale as\nthe synchrotron emission, although there the flux loss is less severe than\nsingle-dish observations. We present a simple analytical approximation for the\nsynchrotron-to-SZ flux ratio, based on a theoretical radio relic model that\nconnects the non-thermal emission to the thermal gas properties, and show that\nby measuring this ratio one can potentially estimate the relic magnetic fields\nor the particle acceleration efficiency.\n", "  Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory\ncomprising a BF model and a finite set of massless real scalar fields are\nconstructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based\non specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of analyticity in\nthe coupling constant, Lorentz covariance, spacetime locality, Poincare\ninvariance, supplemented with the requirement on the preservation of the number\nof derivatives on each field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that\nthe deformation procedure leads to two classes of gauge-invariant interacting\ntheories with a mass term for the BF vector field $A_{\\mu }$ with U(1) gauge\ninvariance. In order to derive this result we have not used the Higgs mechanism\nbased on spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n", "  We suggest a quantum black hole model that is based on an analogue to\nhydrogen atoms. A self-regular Schwarzschild-AdS black hole is investigated,\nwhere the mass density of the extreme black hole is given by the probability\ndensity of the ground state of hydrogen atoms and the mass densities of\nnon-extreme black holes are given by the probability densities of excited\nstates with no angular momenta. Such an analogue is inclined to adopt\nquantization of black hole horizons. In this way, the total mass of black holes\nis quantized. Furthermore, the quantum hoop conjecture and the Correspondence\nPrinciple are discussed.\n", "  The impact of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction on the optical\nconductivity of graphene has led to a controversy that calls into question the\nuniversality of collisionless transport in this and other Dirac materials.\nUsing a lattice calculation that avoids divergences present in previous nodal\nDirac approaches, our work settles this controversy and obtains results in\nquantitative agreement with experiment over a wide frequency range. We also\ndemonstrate that dimensional regularization methods agree, as long as the\nscaling properties of the conductivity and the regularization of the theory in\nmodified dimension are correctly implemented. Tight-binding lattice and nodal\nDirac theory calculations are shown to coincide at low energies even when the\nnon-zero size of the atomic orbital wave function is included, conclusively\ndemonstrating the universality of the optical conductivity of graphene.\n", "  The Galactic bulge of the Milky Way is made up of stars with a broad range of\nmetallicity, -3.0 < [Fe/H] < 1 dex. The mean of the Metallicity Distribution\nFunction (MDF) decreases as a function of height z from the plane and, more\nweakly, with galactic radius. The most metal rich stars in the inner Galaxy are\nconcentrated to the plane and the more metal poor stars are found predominantly\nfurther from the plane, with an overall vertical gradient in the mean of the\nMDF of about -0.45 dex/kpc. This vertical gradient is believed to reflect the\nchanging contribution with height of different populations in the inner-most\nregion of the Galaxy. The more metal rich stars of the bulge are part of the\nboxy/peanut structure and comprise stars in orbits which trace out the\nunderlying X-shape. There is still a lack of consensus on the origin of the\nmetal poor stars ([Fe/H] < -0.5) in the region of the bulge. Some studies\nattribute the more metal poor stars of the bulge to the thick disk and stellar\nhalo that are present in the inner region, and other studies propose that the\nmetal poor stars are a distinct \"old spheroid\" bulge population. Understanding\nthe origin of the populations that make up the MDF of the bulge, and\nidentifying if there is a unique bulge population which has formed separately\nfrom the disk and halo, has important consequences for identifying the relevant\nprocesses in the the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.\n", "  We report neutron scattering experiments which reveal a large spin gap in the\nmagnetic excitation spectrum of weakly-monoclinic double perovskite Sr2ScOsO6.\nThe spin gap is demonstrative of appreciable spin-orbit-induced anisotropy,\ndespite nominally orbitally-quenched 5d3 Os5+ ions. The system is successfully\nmodeled including nearest neighbor interactions in a Heisenberg Hamiltonian\nwith exchange anisotropy. We find that the presence of the spin-orbit-induced\nanisotropy is essential for the realization of the type I antiferromagnetic\nground state. This demonstrates that physics beyond the LS or JJ coupling\nlimits plays an active role in determining the collective properties of 4d3 and\n5d3 systems, and that theoretical treatments must include spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We present self-consistent, axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations\nperformed with the Prometheus-Vertex code for 18 pre-supernova models in the\nrange of 11-28 solar masses, including progenitors recently investigated by\nother groups. All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability. The latter plays a supportive role at least for\nthe initiation of the re-expansion of the stalled shock before runaway. Taking\ninto account the effects of turbulent pressure in the gain layer, we derive a\ngeneralized condition for the critical neutrino luminosity that captures the\nexplosion behavior of all models very well. We validate the robustness of our\nfindings by testing the influence of stochasticity, numerical resolution, and\napproximations in some aspects of the microphysics.\n", "  We classify the trace anomaly for parity-invariant non-relativistic\nSchr\\\"odinger theories in 2+1 dimensions coupled to background Newton-Cartan\ngravity. The general anomaly structure looks very different from the one in the\nz=2 Lifshitz theories. The type A content of the anomaly is remarkably\nidentical to that of the relativistic 3+1 dimensional case, suggesting the\nconjecture that an a-theorem should exist also in the Newton-Cartan context.\n  Erratum: due to an overcounting of the number of linearly-independent terms\nin the basis, the type A anomaly disappears if Frobenius condition is imposed.\nSee appended erratum for details. This crucial mistake was pointed out to us in\narXiv:1601.06795.\n", "  A general theory of edge spin wave excitations in semi-infinite and finite\nperiodic arrays of magnetic nanodots existing in a spatially uniform\nmagnetization ground state is developed. The theory is formulated using a\nformalism of multi-vectors of magnetization dynamics, which allows one to study\nedge excitations in arrays having arbitrary complex primitive cells and lattice\ngeometry. The developed formalism can describe edge excitations localized both\nat the physical edges of the array and at the internal \"domain walls\"\nseparating array regions existing in different static magnetization states.\nUsing a perturbation theory in the framework of the developed formalism it is\npossible to calculate damping of edge modes and their excitation by external\nvariable magnetic fields. The theory is illustrated on the following\npractically important examples: (i) calculation of the FMR absorption in a\nfinite nanodot array having the shape of a right triangle, (ii) calculation of\nnonreciprocal spin wave spectra of edge modes, including modes at the physical\nedges of an array and modes at the domain walls inside an array, (iii) study of\nthe influence of the domain wall modes on the FMR spectrum of an array existing\nin a non-ideal chessboard antiferromagnetic ground state.\n", "  Quantum state transfer between distant nodes is at the heart of quantum\nprocessing and quantum networking. Stimulated by this, we propose a scheme\nwhere one can highly achieve quantum state transfer between sites in a cavity\nquantum optomechanical network. There, each individual cell site is composed of\na localized mechanical mode which interacts with a laser-driven cavity mode via\nradiation pressure, and photons exchange between neighboring sites is allowed.\nAfter the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of each cell, we show that the\nsystem can be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian of two decoupled bosonic\nchains, and therefore we can apply the well-known results regarding quantum\nstate transfer in conjuction with an additional condition on the transfer\ntimes. In fact, we show that our transfer protocol works for any arbitrary\nquantum state, a result that we will illustrate within the red sideband regime.\nFinally, in order to give a more realistic scenario we take into account the\neffects of independent thermal reservoirs for each site. Thus, solving the\nstandard master equation within the Born-Markov approximation, we reassure both\nthe effective model as well as the feasibility of our protocol.\n", "  Weyl points in three-dimensional photonic crystals behave as monopoles of\nBerry flux in momentum space. Here, based on general symmetry analysis, we show\nthat a minimal number of four symmetry-related (consequently equifrequency)\nWeyl points can be realized in time-reversal invariant photonic crystals. We\nfurther propose an experimentally-feasible way to modify double-gyroid photonic\ncrystals to realize four equifrequency Weyl points, which is explicitly\nconfirmed by our first-principle photonic band-structure calculations.\nRemarkably, photonic crystals with equifrequency Weyl points are qualitatively\nadvantageous in applications including angular selectivity, frequency\nselectivity, invisibility cloaking, and three dimensional imaging.\n", "  We study glassy dynamics using a simulation of three soft Brownian particles\nconfined to a two-dimensional circular region. If the circular region is large,\nthe disks freely rearrange, but rearrangements are rarer for smaller system\nsizes. We directly measure a one-dimensional free energy landscape\ncharacterizing the dynamics. This landscape has two local minima corresponding\nto the two distinct disk configurations, separated by a free energy barrier\nwhich governs the rearrangement rate. We study several different interaction\npotentials and demonstrate that the free energy barrier is composed of a\npotential energy barrier and an entropic barrier. The heights of both of these\nbarriers depend on temperature and system size, demonstrating how non-Arrhenius\nbehavior can arise close to the glass transition.\n", "  We show that the measured yield ratio $^3_{\\Lambda}$H/$^3$He\n($^3_{\\overline{\\Lambda}}\\overline{\\text{H}}$/$^3\\overline{\\text{He}}$) in\nAu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV can be understood within a covariant coalescence model\nif (anti-)$\\Lambda$ particles freeze out earlier than (anti-)nucleons but their\nrelative freezeout time is closer at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV than at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The earlier (anti-)$\\Lambda$ freezeout can\nsignificantly enhance the yield of (anti)hypernucleus $^4_{\\Lambda}$H\n($^4_{\\overline{\\Lambda}}\\overline{\\text{H}}$), leading to that\n$^4_{\\overline{\\Lambda}}\\overline{\\text{H}}$ has a comparable abundance with\n$^4\\overline{\\text{He}}$ and thus provides an easily measured antimatter\ncandidate heavier than $^4\\overline{\\text{He}}$. The future measurement on\n$^4_{\\Lambda}$H ($^4_{\\overline{\\Lambda}}\\overline{\\text{H}}$) would be very\nuseful to understand the (anti-)$\\Lambda$ freezeout dynamics and the production\nmechanism of (anti)hypernuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Superconducting magnets enable precise control of nuclear and electron spins,\nand are used in experiments that explore biological and condensed matter\nsystems, and fundamental atomic particles. In high-precision applications, a\ncommon view is that that slow (<1 Hz) drift of the homogeneous magnetic field\nlimits control and measurement precision. We report on previously undocumented\nhigher-frequency field noise (10 Hz to 200 Hz) that limits the coherence time\nof 9Be+ electron-spin qubits in the 4.46 T field of a superconducting magnet.\nWe measure a spin-echo T2 coherence time of ~6 ms for the 9Be+ electron-spin\nresonance at 124 GHz, limited by part-per-billion fractional fluctuations in\nthe magnet's homogeneous field. Vibration isolation of the magnet improved T2\nto ~50 ms.\n", "  Violation of a Bell inequality guarantees the existence of quantum\ncorrelations in a quantum state. A pure bipartite quantum state, having\nnonvanishing quantum correlation, always violates a Bell inequality. Such\ncorrespondence is absent for multipartite pure quantum states. For a shared\nmultipartite quantum state, we establish a connection between the monogamy of\nBell inequality violation and genuine multi-site entanglement as well as\nmonogamy-based multiparty quantum correlation measures. We find that\ngeneralized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and another single-parameter\nfamily states which we refer to as the \"special Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\"\nstates have the status of extremal states in such relations.\n", "  Unlike optical CCDs, near-infrared detectors, which are based on CMOS hybrid\nreadout technology, typically suffer from electrical crosstalk between the\npixels. The interpixel capacitance (IPC) responsible for the crosstalk affects\nthe point-spread function (PSF) of the telescope, increasing the size and\nmodifying the shape of all objects in the images while correlating the Poisson\nnoise. Upcoming weak lensing surveys that use these detectors, such as WFIRST,\nplace stringent requirements on the PSF size and shape (and the level at which\nthese are known), which in turn must be translated into requirements on IPC. To\nfacilitate this process, we present a first study of the effect of IPC on\nWFIRST PSF sizes and shapes. Realistic PSFs are forward-simulated from physical\nprinciples for each WFIRST bandpass. We explore how the PSF size and shape\ndepends on the range of IPC coupling with pixels that are connected along an\nedge or corner; for the expected level of IPC in WFIRST, IPC increases the PSF\nsizes by $\\sim$5\\%. We present a linear fitting formula that describes the\nuncertainty in the PSF size or shape due to uncertainty in the IPC, which could\narise for example due to unknown time evolution of IPC as the detectors age or\ndue to spatial variation of IPC across the detector. We also study of the\neffect of a small anisotropy in the IPC, which further modifies the PSF shapes.\nOur results are a first, critical step in determining the hardware and\ncharacterization requirements for the detectors used in the WFIRST survey.\n", "  Two-particle pseudorapidity correlations are analyzed in a simple model,\nwhere in the initial stage of the reaction multiple sources, extended in\nrapidity, are created. We show how the fluctuations of the length of the\nsources in rapidity generate correlations in the initial entropy deposition,\nwhich later contribute to the observed longitudinal correlations in hadron\nproduction. Our analysis, which is analytic and leads to straightforward\nformulas, allows us to understand the structure of the correlations, in\nparticular to identify the component related to the fluctuation of the numbers\nof sources and the component from the length fluctuations. We also present the\nresults in terms of the expansion in the basis of the Legendre polynomials. A\nnumber of further effects is discussed, such as smearing of the pseudorapidity\ndistributions or resonance decays. Our results reproduce qualitatively and\nsemiquantitatively the basic features of the recent measurements at the LHC.\n", "  To explore the hypothesis that KIC 8462852's aperiodic dimming is caused by\nartificial megastructures in orbit (Wright et al. 2015), rather than a natural\ncause such as cometary fragments in a highly elliptical orbit (Marengo et al.\n2015), we searched for electromagnetic signals from KIC 8462852 indicative of\nextraterrestrial intelligence. The primary observations were in the visible\noptical regime using the Boquete Optical SETI Observatory in Panama. In\naddition, as a preparatory exercise for the possible future detection of a\ncandidate signal (Heidmann 1991), three of six observing runs simultaneously\nsearched radio frequencies at the Allen Telescope Array in California. No\nperiodic optical signals greater than 67 photons/m2 within a time frame of 25\nns were seen. This limit corresponds to isotropic optical pulses of 8E22\njoules. If, however, any inhabitants of KIC 8462852 were targeting our solar\nsystem (Shostak & Villard 2004), the required energy would be reduced greatly.\nThe limits on narrowband radio signals were 180 - 300 Jy Hz at 1 and 8 GHz,\nrespectively, corresponding to a transmitter with an effective isotropic\nradiated power of 4E15 W (and 7E15 W) at the distance of KIC 8462852. While\nthese powers requirements are high, even modest targeting could - just as for\noptical signals - lower these numbers substantially.\n", "  In this paper, we show how the motion of physical fields, in particular the\nelectromagnetic potential, is connected with the choice of a space and time\ndecomposition of the background spacetime manifold. The relation of the field\ndynamics and its kinematic description is derived with the help of the\nparametrization approach. In this context, we give an original proof for the\nmain statement of this approach. With regard to generally covariant theories,\nthe arising kinematic constraints are investigated for the class of non-linear\nelectrodynamics. We reduce the problem of finding the explicit form of the\nsuper-Hamiltonian constraint to the problem of solving two non-linear\nequations. By this, we provide a plug-and-play approach to find the whole set\nof constraints for an arbitrary theory of non-linear electrodynamics and apply\nit to selected examples. Furthermore, it will be shown that the parametrization\napproach is connected with the description of a charged point particle within\nits own electromagnetic field.\n", "  A beam of linearly polarized light transmitted through magnetically biased\ngraphene can have its axis of polarization rotated by several degrees after\npassing the graphene sheet. This large Faraday effect is due to the action of\nthe magnetic field on graphene's charge carriers. As deformations of the\ngraphene membrane result in pseudomagnetic fields acting on the charge\ncarriers, the effect of random mesoscopic corrugations (ripples) can be\ndescribed as the exposure of graphene to a random pseudomagnetic field. We aim\nto clarify the interplay of these typically sample inherent fields with the\nexternal magnetic bias field and the resulting effect on the Faraday rotation.\nIn principle, random gauge disorder can be identified from a combination of\nFaraday angle and optical spectroscopy measurements.\n", "  The interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in strongly\ncorrelated fermionic systems, in particular of Dirac fermions, is a\nlong-standing problem in condensed matter physics. We investigate the competing\norders in the half-filled SU(2N) Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, which\ncan be accurately realized in optical lattices with large-spin ultra-cold\nalkaline-earth fermions. Employing large-scale projector determinant quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations, we have explored quantum phase transitions from the\ngapless Dirac semi-metals to the gapped Mott-insulating phases in the SU(4) and\nSU(6) cases. Both of these Mott-insulating states are found to be columnar\nvalence bond solid (cVBS) and to be absent of the antiferromagnetic Neel\nordering and the loop current ordering. Inside the cVBS phases, the dimer\nordering is enhanced by increasing fermion components and behaves\nnon-monotonically as the interaction strength increases. Although the\ntransitions generally should be of first order due to a cubic invariance\npossessed by the cVBS order, the coupling to gapless Dirac fermions can soften\nthe transitions to second order through a non-analytic term in the free energy.\nOur simulations provide important guidance for the experimental exploration of\nnovel states of matter with ultra-cold alkaline earth fermions.\n", "  We present new Keck/MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopy for a sample of 14 faint,\nX-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the COSMOS field. The data\ncover the spectral region surrounding the broad Balmer emission lines, which\nenables the estimation of black hole masses (M_BH) and accretion rates (in\nterms of L/L_Edd). We focus on 10 AGN at z~3.3, where we observe the Hbeta\nspectral region, while for the other four z~2.4 sources we use the Halpha broad\nemission line. Compared with previous detailed studies of unobscured AGNs at\nthese high redshifts, our sources are fainter by an order of magnitude,\ncorresponding to number densities of order ~10^-6--10^-5 Mpc^-3. The lower AGN\nluminosities also allow for a robust identification of the host galaxy\nemission, necessary to obtain reliable intrinsic AGN luminosities, BH masses\nand accretion rates. We find the AGNs in our sample to be powered by\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a typical mass of M_BH~5*10^8 M_Sol --\nsignificantly lower than the higher-luminosity, rarer quasars reported in\nprevious studies. The accretion rates are in the range L/L_Edd~0.1-0.5, with an\nevident lack of sources with lower L/L_Edd (and higher M_BH), as found in\nseveral studies of faint AGNs at intermediate redshifts. Based on the early\ngrowth expected for the SMBHs in our sample, we argue that a significant\npopulation of faint z~6 AGNs, with M_BH~10^6 M_Sol, should be detectable in the\ndeepest X-ray surveys available, but this is not observed. We discuss several\npossible explanations for the apparent absence of such a population, concluding\nthat the most probable scenario involves an evolution in source obscuration\nand/or radiative efficiencies.\n", "  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool in\nimaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are\ncommonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nthe acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias\nfield) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of\nbias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different\nimage analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to\nincreased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction\napproaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared\nto the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and\nanatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective\nbias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that\ncan reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a\nunified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias\nfield as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated,\nbias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel\nstochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model\nto mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR\ndata. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR\ndata, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using\nendorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that\nthe proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to\nother tested bias correction methods. As such, the proposed NCBC method may\nhave potential as a useful retrospective approach for improving the consistency\nof image interpretations.\n", "  Large-scale transitions in societies are associated with both individual\nbehavioural change and restructuring of the social network. These two factors\nhave often been considered independently, yet recent advances in social network\nresearch challenge this view. Here we show that common features of societal\nmarginalization and clustering emerge naturally during transitions in a\nco-evolutionary adaptive network model. This is achieved by explicitly\nconsidering the interplay between individual interaction and a dynamic network\nstructure in behavioural selection. We exemplify this mechanism by simulating\nhow smoking behaviour and the network structure get reconfigured by changing\nsocial norms. Our results are consistent with empirical findings: The\nprevalence of smoking was reduced, remaining smokers were preferentially\nconnected among each other and formed increasingly marginalised clusters. We\npropose that self-amplifying feedbacks between individual behaviour and dynamic\nrestructuring of the network are main drivers of the transition. This\ngenerative mechanism for co-evolution of individual behaviour and social\nnetwork structure may apply to a wide range of examples beyond smoking.\n", "  We consider a system of weakly coupled wires with quantum Hall effect (QHE)\nand in the presence of a spatially periodic modulation of the chemical\npotential along the wire, equivalent to a charge density wave (CDW). We\ninvestigate the competition between the two effects which both open a gap. We\nshow that by changing the ratio between the amplitudes of the CDW modulation\nand the tunneling between wires, one can switch between non-topological\nCDW-dominated phase to topological QHE-dominated phase. Both phases host edge\nstates of chiral and non-chiral nature robust to on-site disorder. However,\nonly in the topological phase, the edge states are immune to disorder in the\nphase shifts of the CDWs. We provide analytical solutions for filling factor\n$\\nu=1$ and study numerically effects of disorder as well as present numerical\nresults for higher filling factors.\n", "  We report a numerical study on generation and stability of parabolic pulses\nduring their propagation through highly nonlinear specialty optical fibers.\nHere, we have generated a parabolic pulse at 2.1 $\\mu$m wavelength from a\nGaussian input pulse with 1.9 ps FWHM and 75 W peak power after travelling\nthrough only 20 cm length of a chalcogenide glass based microstructured optical\nfiber (MOF). Dependence on input pulse shapes towards most efficient conversion\ninto self similar states is reported. The stability in terms of any deviation\nfrom dissipative self-similar nature of such pulses has been analyzed by\nintroducing a variable longitudinal loss profile within the spectral loss\nwindow of the MOF, and detailed pulse shapes are captured. Moreover, three\ndifferent dispersion regimes of propagation have been considered to study the\nsuitability to support most stable propagation of the pulse.\n", "  Warped extra dimensions can address both the Planck-weak and flavor\nhierarchies of the Standard Model (SM). In this paper we discuss the SM\nneutrino mass generation in a scenario in which a SM singlet bulk fermion -\ncoupled to the Higgs and the lepton doublet near the IR brane - is given a\nMajorana mass of order the Planck scale on the UV brane. Despite the\nresemblance to a type I seesaw mechanism, a careful investigation based on the\nmass basis for the singlet 4D modes reveals a very different picture. Namely,\nthe SM neutrino masses are generated dominantly by the exchange of the\nTeV-scale mass eigenstates of the singlet, that are pseudo-Dirac and have a\nsizable Higgs- induced mixing with the SM doublet neutrino: remarkably, in\nwarped 5D models the anticipated type I seesaw morphs into a natural\nrealization of the so-called \"inverse\" seesaw. This understanding uncovers an\nintriguing and direct link between neutrino mass generation (and possibly\nleptogenesis) and TeV-scale physics. We also perform estimates using the dual\nCFT picture of our framework, which back-up our 5D calculation.\n", "  We argue that the diphoton excess recently reported by ATLAS and CMS can be\nexplained, along with several anomalies seen in the flavor sector, in models\nwhere a Standard-Model singlet scalar resonance with mass $M \\approx 750$ GeV\nis produced in gluon fusion via loops containing a scalar color- triplet\nleptoquark $\\phi$. For a leptoquark mass $M_\\phi \\lesssim$ 1 TeV, the\nproduction cross section is naturally in the 10 fb range. A large $S \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ branching ratio can be obtained by coupling the scalar S to new\ncolor-singlet fermions $\\chi$ with electroweak scale masses, which can be part\nof an $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, whose neutral component has the right mass and\nquantum numbers to be a dark matter candidate. Our model reveals a connection\nbetween flavor anomalies, the nature of dark matter and a new scalar, which\nacts as a mediator to the dark sector. The loop-mediated decay $S \\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$ could be a striking signature of this model.\n", "  The recent proposal of photon and neutrino pair beam is extensively\ninvestigated. Production rates, both differential and total, of single photon,\ntwo-photon and neutrino-pair emitted from quantum ions in circular motion are\ncalculated for any velocity of ion. This part is an extension of our previous\nresults at highest energies to lower energies of circulating ions, and helps\nmuch to identify the new process at a low energy ion ring. We clarify how to\nutilize the circulating ion for a new source of coherent neutrino beam despite\nof much stronger background photons. Once one verifies that the coherence is\nmaintained in the initial phases of time evolution after laser irradiation,\nlarge background photon emission rates are not an obstacle against utilizing\nthe extracted neutrino pair beam.\n", "  We demonstrate that chimera behavior can be observed in nonlocally coupled\nnetworks of excitable systems in the presence of noise. This phenomenon is\ndistinct from classical chimeras, which occur in deterministic oscillatory\nsystems, and it combines temporal features of coherence resonance, i.e., the\nconstructive role of noise, and spatial properties of chimera states, i.e.,\ncoexistence of spatially coherent and incoherent domains in a network of\nidentical elements. Coherence-resonance chimeras are associated with\nalternating switching of the location of coherent and incoherent domains, which\nmight be relevant in neuronal networks.\n", "  It has been recently pointed out that a momentum-dependent coupling of the\nasymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) with nucleons can explain the broad disagreement\nbetween helioseismological observables and the predictions of standard solar\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a minimal simplified ADM model consisting of\na scalar and a pseudoscalar mediator, in addition to a Dirac fermionic DM, for\ngenerating such momentum-dependent interactions. Remarkably, the pseudoscalar\nwith mass around 750 GeV can simultaneously explain the solar anomaly and the\nrecent diphoton excess observed by both ATLAS and CMS experiments in the early\n$\\sqrt s=13$ TeV LHC data. In this framework, the total width of the resonance\nis naturally large, as suggested by the ATLAS experiment, since the resonance\nmostly decays to the ADM pair. The model predicts the existence of a new light\nscalar in the GeV range, interacting with quarks, and observable dijet, monojet\nand $t\\bar{t}$ signatures for the 750 GeV resonance at the LHC.\n", "  We present a model of discrete quantum evolution based on quantum\ncorrelations between the evolving system and a reference quantum clock system.\nA quantum circuit for the model is provided, which in the case of a constant\nHamiltonian is able to represent the evolution over $2^n$ time steps in terms\nof just $n$ time qubits and $n$ control gates. We then introduce the concept of\nsystem-time entanglement as a measure of distinguishable quantum evolution,\nbased on the entanglement between the system and the reference clock. This\nquantity vanishes for stationary states and is maximum for systems jumping onto\na new orthogonal state at each time step. In the case of a constant Hamiltonian\nleading to a cyclic evolution it is a measure of the spread over distinct\nenergy eigenstates, and satisfies an entropic energy-time uncertainty relation.\nThe evolution of mixed states is also examined. Analytical expressions for the\nbasic case of a qubit clock, as well as for the continuous limit in the\nevolution between two states, are provided.\n", "  We study a tripartite system of coupled spins, where a first set of one or\ntwo spins is our central system which is coupled to another set considered, the\nnear environment, in turn coupled to the third set, the far environment. The\ndynamics considered are those of a generalized kicked spin chain in the regime\nof quantum chaotic dynamics. This allows to test recent results that suggest\nthat the presence of a far environment, coupled to the near environment, slows\ndecoherence of the central system. After an extensive numerical study, we\nconfirm previous results for extreme values and special cases. In particular,\nunder a wide variety of circumstances an increasingly large coupling between\nnear and far environment, slows decoherence, as measured by purity, and\nprotects internal entanglement.\n", "  Some recently discovered short-period Earth to Neptune sized exoplanets\n(super Earths) have low observed mean densities which can only be explained by\nvoluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the conditions allowing the\naccretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the\nnebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas\nenvelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we\naddress mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We\nfind that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass)\nfollowing the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their\natmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the\nunderlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles\nthan the core (equivalently, lighter than a few % of the planet's mass) can be\nblown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool\nand contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale\nto the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the\nmass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets\nhave to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres,\nwhile not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion\nand become gas giants (Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed\nsuper-Earth population and find that low-density planets are indeed\nconcentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive\nmodel can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.\n", "  We revisit a class of $SU(5)$ SUSY GUT models which arise in the context of\nthe spectral cover with Klein Group monodromy $V_4=Z_2\\times Z_2$. We show that\n$Z_2$ matter parities can be realised via new geometric symmetries respected by\nthe spectral cover. We discuss a particular example of this kind, where the low\nenergy effective theory below the GUT scale is just the MSSM with no exotics\nand standard matter parity, extended by the seesaw mechanism with two\nright-handed neutrinos.\n", "  We present a high-precision measurement of the parallax for the 12-day\nCepheid SS Canis Majoris, obtained via spatial scanning with the Wide Field\nCamera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Spatial scanning enables\nastrometric measurements with a precision of 20-40 muas, an order of magnitude\nbetter than pointed observations. SS CMa is the second Cepheid targeted for\nparallax measurement with HST, and is the first of a sample of eighteen\nlong-period >~ 10 days) Cepheids selected in order to improve the calibration\nof their period-luminosity relation and eventually permit a determination of\nthe Hubble constant H_0 to better than 2%. The parallax of SS CMa is found to\nbe 348 +/- 38 muas, corresponding to a distance of 2.9 +/- 0.3 kpc. We also\npresent a refinement of the static geometric distortion of WFC3 obtained using\nspatial scanning observations of calibration fields, with a typical magnitude\n<~0.01 pixels on scales of 100 pixels.\n", "  The shear response of soft solids can be modeled with linear elasticity,\nprovided the forcing is slow and weak. Both of these approximations must break\ndown when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their\n(un)jamming point -- suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near\njamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs\nremains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of\nstress relaxation and shear startup experiments in athermal soft sphere\npackings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain\namplitude, strain rate, distance to jamming, and system size, we identify\ncharacteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of\nlinear elasticity closes, and relate these scales to changes in the microscopic\ncontact network. Our findings indicate that the mechanical response of jammed\nsolids are generically nonlinear and rate-dependent on experimentally\naccessible strain and time scales.\n", "  The bright soft X-ray transient Nova Muscae 1991 was intensively observed\nduring its entire 8-month outburst using the Large Area Counter (LAC) onboard\nthe Ginga satellite. Recently, we obtained accurate estimates of the mass of\nthe black hole primary, the orbital inclination angle of the system, and the\ndistance. Using these crucial input data and Ginga X-ray spectra, we have\nmeasured the spin of the black hole using the continuum-fitting method. For\nfour X-ray spectra of extraordinary quality we have determined the\ndimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a/M = 0.63 (-0.19, +0.16)\n(1 sigma confidence level), a result that we confirm using eleven additional\nspectra of lower quality. Our spin estimate challenges two published results:\nIt is somewhat higher than the value predicted by a proposed relationship\nbetween jet power and spin; and we find that the spin of the black hole is\ndecidedly prograde, not retrograde as has been claimed.\n", "  The optical counterpart of the black-hole soft X-ray transient Nova Muscae\n1991 has brightened by $\\Delta{V}\\approx0.8$ mag since its return to quiescence\n23 years ago. We present the first clear evidence that the brightening of soft\nX-ray transients in quiescence occurs at a nearly linear rate. This discovery,\nand our precise determination of the disk component of emission obtained using\nour $simultaneous$ photometric and spectroscopic data, have allowed us to\nidentify and accurately model archival ellipsoidal light curves of the highest\nquality. The simultaneity, and the strong constraint it provides on the\ncomponent of disk emission, is a key element of our work. Based on our analysis\nof the light curves, and our earlier measurements of the mass function and mass\nratio, we have obtained for Nova Muscae 1991 the first accurate estimates of\nits systemic inclination $i=43.2^{+2.1}_{-2.7}$ deg, and black hole mass\n$M=11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.4}\\ M_\\odot$. Based on our determination of the radius of\nthe secondary, we estimate the distance to be $D=4.95^{+0.69}_{-0.65}$ kpc. We\ndiscuss the implications of our work for future dynamical studies of black-hole\nsoft X-ray transients.\n", "  Recently, both ATLAS and CMS collaborations report an excess at 750GeV in the\ndiphoton invariant mass spectrum at 13TeV LHC. If it is a new scalar produced\nvia loop induced gluon-gluon fusion process, it is important to know what is\nthe particle in the loop. In this work, we investigate the possibility of\ndetermine the fraction of the contribution from the standard model top-quark in\nthe loop.\n", "  We propose a class of photonic Floquet topological insulators based on\nstaggered helical lattices and an efficient numerical method for calculating\ntheir Floquet bandstructure. The lattices support anomalous Floquet topological\ninsulator phases with vanishing Chern number and tunable topological\ntransitions. At the critical point of the topological transition, the\nbandstructure hosts a single unpaired Dirac cone, which yields a variety of\nunusual transport effects: a discrete analogue of conical diffraction, weak\nantilocalization not limited by intervalley scattering, and suppression of\nAnderson localization. Unlike previous designs, the effective gauge field\nstrength can be controlled via lattice parameters such as the inter-helix\ndistance, significantly reducing radiative losses and enabling applications\nsuch as switchable topological wave-guiding.\n", "  Quasi-periodic disturbances of emission-line parameters are frequently\nobserved in the corona. These disturbances propagate upward along the magnetic\nfield with speeds $\\sim100~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$. This phenomenon has been\ninterpreted as evidence of the propagation of slow magnetosonic waves or argued\nto be signature of the intermittent outflows superposed on the background\nplasmas. Here we aim to present a new \"wave + flow\" model to interpret these\nobservations. In our scenario, the oscillatory motion is a slow mode wave, and\nthe flow is associated with a beam created by the wave-particle interaction\nowing to Landau resonance. With the help of a Vlasov model, we simulate the\npropagation of the slow mode wave and the generation of the beam flow. We find\nthat weak periodic beam flows can be generated owing to Landau resonance in the\nsolar corona, and the phase with strongest blueward asymmetry is ahead of that\nwith strongest blueshift by about 1/4 period. We also find that the slow wave\ndamps to the level of 1/e after the transit time of two wave periods, owing to\nLandau damping and Coulomb collisions in our simulation. This damping time\nscale is similar to that resulting from thermal-conduction in the\nmagnetohydrodynamics regime. The beam flow is weakened/attenuated with\nincreasing wave period and decreasing wave amplitude since Coulomb collision\nbecomes more and more dominant over the wave action. We suggest that this \"wave\n+ flow\" kinetic model provides an alternative explanation for the observed\nquasi-periodic propagating perturbations in various parameters in the solar\ncorona.\n", "  Observations of the microwave background fluctuations suggest a\nscale-dependent amplitude asymmetry of roughly 2.5 sigma significance.\nInflationary explanations for this 'anomaly' require non-Gaussian fluctuations\nwhich couple observable modes to those on much larger scales. In this Letter we\ndescribe an analysis of such scenarios which significantly extends previous\ntreatments. We identify the non-Gaussian 'response function' which\ncharacterizes the asymmetry, and show that it is non-trivial to construct a\nmodel which yields a sufficient amplitude: many independent fine tunings are\nrequired, often making such models appear less likely than the anomaly they\nseek to explain. We present an explicit model satisfying observational\nconstraints and determine for the first time how large its bispectrum would\nappear to a Planck-like experiment. Although this model is merely illustrative,\nwe expect it is a good proxy for the bispectrum in a sizeable class of models\nwhich generate a scale-dependent response using a large eta parameter.\n", "  Occurrence of topological Anderson insulator (TAI) in HgTe quantum well\nsuggests that when time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is maintained, the pertinent\ntopological phase transition, marked by re-entrant $2e^2/h$ quantized\nconductance contributed by helical edge states, is driven by disorder. Here we\nshow that when TRS is broken, the physics of TAI becomes even richer. The\npattern of longitudinal conductance and nonequilibrium local current %Unlike\nfor conventional topological insulators that, in the %absence of an external\nmagnetic field, support only a single quantized %conductance in the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect region or a single %re-entrant quantized conductance in\nTAI, %our model exhibits novel TAI distribution displays novel TAI phases\ncharacterized by nonzero Chern numbers, indicating the occurrence of multiple\nchiral edge modes. Tuning either disorder or Fermi energy (in both\ntopologically trivial and nontrivial phases), drives transitions between these\ndistinct TAI phases, characterized by jumps of the quantized conductance from\n$0$ to $e^2/h$ and from $e^2/h$ to $2e^2/h$. An effective medium theory based\non the Born approximation yields an accurate description of different TAI\nphases in parameter space.\n", "  Massive black holes at galaxy center may tear apart a star when the star\npasses occasionally within the disruption radius, which is the so-called tidal\ndisruption event(TDE). Most TDEs radiate with thermal emission resulted from\nthe accretion disk, but three TDEs have been detected in bright non-thermal\nX-ray emission, which is interpreted as arising from the relativistic jets.\nSearch for high-energy gamma-ray emission from one relativistic TDE (Swift\nJ164449.3+573451) with the \\textsl{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) has\nyielded non-detection. In this paper, we report the search for high energy\nemission from the other two relativistic TDEs (Swift J2058.4+0516 Swift\nJ1112.2-8238) during the flare period. No significant GeV emission is found,\nwith an upper limit fluence in LAT energy range being less than $1\\%$ of that\nin X-rays. Compared with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars, these TDEs have\nthe lowest flux ratio between GeV emission and X-ray emission. The\nnon-detection of high-energy emission from relativistic TDEs could be due to\nthat the high-energy emission is absorbed by soft photons in the source. Based\non this hypothesis, upper limits on the bulk Lorentz factors, $\\Gamma\\la 30$,\nare then obtained for the jets in these TDEs. We also search for high-energy\ngamma-ray emission from the nearest TDE discovered to date, ASASSN-14li. No\nsignificant GeV emission is found and an upper limit of $L(\\rm 0.1-10 GeV)\\le\n4.4\\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at $95\\%$ confidence level) is obtained for\nthe first $10^{7}$ s after the disruption.\n", "  We review the observational evidences concerning the three-dimensional\nstructure of the Galactic bulge. Although the inner few kpc of our Galaxy are\nnormally referred to as {\\it the bulge}, all the observations demonstrate that\nthis region is dominated by a bar, i.e., the bulge is a bar. The bar has a\nboxy/peanut (X\\--shaped) structure in its outer regions, while it seems to\nbecome less and less elongated in its innermost region. A thinner and longer\nstructure departing from the main bar has also been found, although the\nobservational evidences that support the scenario of two separate structures\nhas been recently challenged. Metal poor stars ([Fe/H]$\\lesssim -0.5$ dex)\ntrace a different structure, and also have different kinematics.\n", "  An object moving through a plane interface into a fluid deforms the interface\nin such a way that fluid from one side of the interface is entrained into the\nother side, a phenomenon known as Darwin's drift. We investigate this\nphenomenon experimentally using a disc which is started exactly at the\ninterface of two immiscible fluids, namely oil and water. First, we observe\nthat due to the density difference between the two fluids the deformation of\nthe interface is influenced by gravity, and show that there exits a time window\nof universal behavior. Secondly, we show by comparing with boundary integral\nsimulations that, even though the deformation is universal, our results cannot\nbe fully explained by potential flow solutions. We attribute this difference to\nthe starting vortex, which is created in the wake of the disc. Universal\nbehavior is preserved, however, because the size and strength of the vortex\nshows the same universality as the potential flow solution.\n", "  We give a unified description of the flip-flop effect in spinning binary\nblack holes and the anti-alignment instability in terms of real and imaginary\nflip-flop frequencies. We find that this instability is only effective for mass\nratios $0.5<q<1$. We provide analytic expressions that determine the region of\nparameter space for which the instability occurs in terms of maps of the mass\nratio and spin magnitudes $(q,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$. This restricts the priors of\nparameter estimation techniques for the observation of gravitational waves from\nbinary black holes and it is relevant for astrophysical modeling and final\nrecoil computations of such binary systems.\n", "  Light beams with azimuthal phase dependence [$exp(i \\ell\\phi)$] carry orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) which differs fundamentally from spin angular momentum\n(SAM) associated with polarization. Striking difference between the two momenta\nis manifested in the allowable values: where SAM is limited to $\\hbar k_0$ per\nphoton, the OAM has unbounded value of $\\ell\\hbar$ per photon ($\\ell$ is\ninteger), thus dramatically exceeding the value of SAM \\cite{Ref1,Ref2, Ref3}.\nOAM has thus been utilized in optical trapping \\cite{Ref4}, imaging\\cite{Ref2},\nand material processing \\cite{Ref5}. Furthermore, the unbounded\ndegrees-of-freedom in OAM states have been deployed in data communications\n\\cite{Ref6}. Here, we report an \\textit{exceptional} behavior for a class of\nlight beams---known as Frozen Waves (FWs)---whose intensity and azimuthal phase\nprofiles can be controlled along the propagation direction, at will.\nAccordingly, we generate rotating light patterns that can change their sense of\nrotation and order of phase twist with propagation. Manipulating OAM along the\nbeam axis can open new directions in optical science and its applications.\n", "  We numerically study the work distributions in a chaotic system and examine\nthe relationship between quantum work and classical work. Our numerical results\nsuggest that there exists a correspondence principle between quantum and\nclassical work distributions in a chaotic system. This correspondence was\nproved for one-dimensional (1D) integrable systems in a recent work [Jarzynski,\nQuan, and Rahav, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031038 (2015)]. Our investigation further\njustifies the definition of quantum work via two point energy measurements.\n", "  Three dimensional topological Dirac semi-metals represent a novel state of\nquantum matter with exotic electronic properties, in which a pair of Dirac\npoints with the linear dispersion along all momentum directions exist in the\nbulk. Herein, by using the first principles calculations, we discover a new\nmetastable allotrope of Ge and Sn in the staggered layered dumbbell structure,\nnamed as germancite and stancite, to be Dirac semi-metals with a pair of Dirac\npoints on its rotation axis. On the surface parallel to the rotation axis, a\npair of topologically non-trivial Fermi arcs are observed and a Lifshitz\ntransition is found by tuning the Fermi level. Furthermore, the quantum thin\nfilm of germancite is found to be an intrinsic quantum spin Hall insulator.\nThese discoveries suggest novel physical properties and future applications of\nthe new metastable allotrope of Ge and Sn.\n", "  The motion of spinning massless particles in gravitationally curved\nbackgrounds is revisited by considering new types of constraints. Those\nconstraints guarantee zero mass ($P_\\mu P^\\mu=0$) and they allow for the\npossibility of trajectories which are not simply null geodesics. To exemplify\nthis previously unknown possibility, the equations of motion are solved for\nradial motion in Schwarzschild background. It is found that the particle\nexperiences a spin-induced energy shift, which is proportional to the Hawking\ntemperature of the black hole background.\n", "  Backward Raman amplification is limited by relativistic nonlinear dephasing\nresulting in saturation of the leading spike of the amplified pulse. Pump\ndetuning is employed to mitigate the relativistic phase mismatch and to\novercome the associated saturation. The amplified pulse can then be reshaped\ninto a mono-spike pulse with little precursory power ahead of it, with the\nmaximum intensity increasing by a factor of two. This detuning can be employed\nadvantageously both in regimes where the group velocity dispersion is\nunimportant and where the dispersion is important but small.\n", "  We show that the projected number density profiles of SDSS photometric\ngalaxies around galaxy clusters displays strong evidence for the splashback\nradius, a sharp halo edge corresponding to the location of the first orbital\napocenter of satellite galaxies after their infall. We split the clusters into\ntwo subsamples with different mean projected radial distances of their members,\n$\\langle R_{\\rm mem}\\rangle$, at fixed richness and redshift, and show that the\nsample with smaller $\\langle R_{\\rm mem}\\rangle$ has a smaller ratio of the\nsplashback radius to the traditional halo boundary $R_{\\rm 200m}$, than the\nsubsample with larger $\\langle R_{\\rm mem}\\rangle$, indicative of different\nmass accretion rates for the two subsamples. The same cluster samples were\nrecently used by Miyatake et al. to show that their large-scale clustering\ndiffers despite their similar weak lensing masses, demonstrating strong\nevidence for halo assembly bias. We expand on this result by presenting a\n6.6-$\\sigma$ detection of halo assembly bias using the cluster-photometric\ngalaxy cross-correlations. Our measured splashback radii are smaller, while the\nstrength of the assembly bias signal is stronger, than expectations from N-body\nsimulations based on the $\\Lambda$-dominated, cold dark matter structure\nformation model. Dynamical friction or cluster-finding systematics such as\nmiscentering or projection effects are not likely to be the sole source of\nthese discrepancies.\n", "  A basic kinetic model that incorporates a coupled dynamics of the carbon\natoms and dimers on a copper surface is used to compute growth of a\nsingle-layer graphene island. The speed of the island's edge advancement on\nCu[111] and Cu[100] surfaces is computed as a function of the growth\ntemperature and pressure. Spatially resolved concentration profiles of the\natoms and dimers are determined, and the contributions provided by these\nspecies to the growth speed are discussed. Island growth in the conditions of a\nthermal cycling is studied.\n", "  In recent years, material-induced noise arising from defects has emerged as\nan impediment to quantum-limited measurement in systems ranging from microwave\nqubits to gravity wave interferometers. As experimental systems push to ever\nsmaller dimensions, extrinsic system properties can affect its internal\nmaterial dynamics. In this paper, we identify surprising new regimes of\nmaterial physics (defect-phonon and defect-defect dynamics) that are produced\nby dimensional confinement. Our models show that a range of tell-tale\nsignatures, encoded in the characteristics of defect-induced noise,\ndissipation, and nonlinearity, are profoundly altered by geometry. Building on\nthis insight, we demonstrate that the magnitude and character of this\nmaterial-induced noise is transformed in microscale systems, providing an\nopportunity to improve the fidelity of quantum measurements. Moreover, we show\nthat many emerging nano-electromechanical, cavity optomechanical and\nsuperconducting resonator systems are poised to probe these new regimes of\ndynamics, in both high and low field limits, providing a new way to explore the\nfundamental tenets of glass physics.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of the accuracy of the digitized magnitudes\nof photometric plates on the time scale of decades. In our examination of\narchival Johnson B photometry from the Harvard DASCH archive, we find a median\nRMS scatter of lightcurves of order 0.15mag over the range B~9-17 for all\ncalibrations. Slight underlying systematics (trends or flux discontinuities)\nare on a level of ~<=0.2mag per century (1889-1990) for the majority of\nconstant stars. These historic data can be unambiguously used for processes\nthat happen on scales of magnitudes, and need to be carefully examined in cases\napproaching the noise floor. The characterization of these limits in\nphotometric stability may guide future studies in their use of plate archives.\nWe explain these limitations for the example case of KIC8462852, which has been\nclaimed to dim by 0.16mag per century, and show that this trend cannot be\nconsidered as significant.\n", "  Stochastic heat engines are devices that generate work from random thermal\nmotion using a small number of highly fluctuating degrees of freedom. Proposals\nfor such devices have existed for more than a century and include the Maxwell\ndemon and the Feynman ratchet. Only recently have they been demonstrated\nexperimentally, using e.g., thermal cycles implemented in optical traps.\nHowever, the recent demonstrations of stochastic heat engines are\nnonautonomous, since they require an external control system that prescribes a\nheating and cooling cycle, and consume more energy than they produce. This\nReport presents a heat engine consisting of three coupled mechanical resonators\n(two ribbons and a cantilever) subject to a stochastic drive. The engine uses\ngeometric nonlinearities in the resonating ribbons to autonomously convert a\nrandom excitation into a low-entropy, nonpassive oscillation of the cantilever.\nThe engine presents the anomalous heat transport property of negative thermal\nconductivity, consisting in the ability to passively transfer energy from a\ncold reservoir to a hot reservoir.\n", "  We prove the existence of a large class of initial data for the vacuum\nEinstein equations which possess a finite number of asymptotically Euclidean\nand asymptotically conformally cylindrical or periodic ends. Aside from being\nasymptotically constant, only mild conditions on the mean curvature of these\ninitial data sets are imposed.\n", "  We extend the relaxation mechanism to the Elementary Goldstone Higgs\nframework. Besides studying the allowed parameter space of the theory we add\nthe minimal ingredients needed for the framework to be phenomenologically\nviable. The very nature of the extended Higgs sector allows to consider very\nflat scalar potential directions along which the relaxation mechanism can be\nimplemented. This fact translates into wider regions of applicability of the\nrelaxation mechanism when compared to the Standard Model Higgs case. Our\nresults show that, if the electroweak scale is not fundamental but radiatively\ngenerated, it is possible to generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry\nvia the relaxation mechanism.\n", "  Recent large scale surveys of galactic bulge stars allowed to build a\ndetailed map of the bulge kinematics. The bulge exhibits cylindrical rotation\nconsistent with a disky origin which evolved through bar driven secular\nevolution. However correlations between metallicity and kinematics complicate\nthis picture. In particular a metal-poor component with distinct kinematic\nsignatures has been detected. Its origin, density profile and link with the\nother Milky Way stellar populations are currently still poorly constrained.\n", "  Ionic current through a charge-selective interface in a binary electrolyte is\na basic element of many electrochemical engineering and microfluidic processes.\nSuch current passage is diffusion-limited: it induces a decrease of electrolyte\nconcentration towards the interface (concentration polarization, CP), expressed\nin the saturation of current upon increasing voltage at some value (limiting\ncurrent, LC). With further increase of voltage, this saturation breaks down\n(overlimiting conductance, OLC). In open systems OLC is mediated by a\nmicroscale vortical flow which develops as a result of electroconvective\ninstability (ECI) of quiescent CP near LC. Electroconvection (EC) is a flow\ndriven by the electric force acting either upon the space charge of the\ninterfacial EDL (electroosmosis, EO) or the residual space charge of the\nquasielectroneutral bulk (bulk EC). There are two types of EO, the equilibrium\nand the nonequilibrium one. The former relates to the action of the tangential\nelectric field upon the space charge of the EDL, and the latter pertains to the\nsimilar action upon the extended space charge, forming next to the EDL near LC.\nFor a perfectly charge-selective interface, CP is stable under the equilibrium\nEO or bulk EC, but nonequilibrium EO may cause ECI. For this reason until\nrecently, ECI in CP was attributed to this latter mechanism. Lately, it was\nshown that imperfect charge-selectivity of the interface makes equilibrium ECI\npossible, driven by either equilibrium EO or bulk EC, or both. Here we identify\nand analyze the major surface and bulk factors affecting the ECI. These factors\n(diffusioosmosis, EO, bulk EC, and some newly identified ones) are\nmanifestations of the electric force and pressure gradient, balanced by the\nviscous force acting in various locations in solution. The contribution of\nthese factors to ECI in CP is analyzed for a varying interface permselectivity.\n", "  We report on the detection and early characterization of a hot Jupiter in a\n3-day orbit around K2-34 (EPIC~212110888), a metal-rich F-type star located in\nthe K2 Cycle 5 field. Our follow-up campaign involves precise radial velocity\n(RV) measurements and high-contrast imaging using multiple facilities. The\nabsence of a bright nearby source in our high-contrast data suggests that the\ntransit-like signals are not due to light variations from such a companion\nstar. Our intensive RV measurements show that K2-34b has a mass of\n$1.773\\pm0.086M_J$, confirming its status as a planet. We also detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect for K2-34b and show that the system has a good\nspin-orbit alignment ($\\lambda=-1_{-9}^{+10}$ degrees). High-contrast images\nobtained by the HiCIAO camera on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope reveal a faint\ncompanion candidate ($\\Delta m_H=6.19\\pm 0.11$ mag) at a separation of\n$0\\farcs36$. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm that the companion\ncandidate is physically associated with K2-34. K2-34b appears to be an example\nof a typical \"hot Jupiter,\" albeit one which can be precisely characterized\nusing a combination of K2 photometry and ground-based follow-up.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies are considered to be the leading candidate sources that\ndominate the cosmic reionization at z>7, and the search for analogs at moderate\nredshift showing Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage is currently a active line of\nresearch. We have observed a star-forming galaxy at z=3.2 with Hubble/WFC3 in\nthe F336W filter, corresponding to the 730-890A rest-frame, and detect LyC\nemission. This galaxy is very compact and also has large Oxygen ratio\n[OIII]5007/[OII]3727 (>=10). No nuclear activity is revealed from\noptical/near-infrared spectroscopy and deep multi-band photometry (including\nthe 6Ms X-ray, Chandra). The measured escape fraction of ionizing radiation\nspans the range 50-100\\%, depending on the IGM attenuation. The LyC emission is\ndetected at S/N=10 with m(F336W)=27.57+/-0.11 and it is spatially unresolved,\nwith effective radius R_e<200pc. Predictions from photoionization and radiative\ntransfer models are in line with the properties reported here, indicating that\nstellar winds and supernova explosions in a nucleated star-forming region can\nblow cavities generating density-bounded conditions compatible with optically\nthin media. Irrespective to the nature of the ionizing radiation, spectral\nsignatures of these sources over the entire electromagnetic spectrum are of\ncentral importance for their identification during the epoch of reionization,\nwhen the LyC is unobservable. Intriguingly, the Spitzer/IRAC photometric\nsignature of intense rest-frame optical emissions ([OIII]+Hbeta) observed\nrecently at z~7.5-8.5 is similar to what is observed in this galaxy. Only the\nJames Webb Space Telescope will measure optical line ratios at z>7 allowing a\ndirect comparison with lower redshift LyC emitters, as reported here.\n", "  We consider the 750 GeV diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC in the ${\\cal\nF}$-$SU(5)$ model with a Standard Model (SM) singlet field which couples to\nTeV-scale vector-like particles, dubbed $flippons$. This singlet field assumes\nthe role of the 750 GeV resonance, with production via gluon fusion and\nsubsequent decay to a diphoton via the vector-like particle loops. We present a\nnumerical analysis showing that the observed 8 TeV and 13 TeV diphoton\nproduction cross-sections can be generated in the model space with realistic\nelectric charges and Yukawa couplings for light vector-like masses. We further\ndiscuss the experimental viability of light vector-like masses in a General\nNo-Scale ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ model, offering a few benchmark scenarios in this\nconsistent GUT that can satisfy all experimental constraints imposed by the LHC\nand other essential experiments.\n", "  The electronic structure of bilayer graphene under pressure develops very\ninteresting features with an enhancement of the trigonal warping and a\nsplitting of the parabolic touching bands at the K point of the reciprocal\nspace into four Dirac cones, one at K and three along the T symmetry lines. As\npressure is increased, these cones separate in reciprocal space and in energy,\nbreaking the electron-hole symmetry. Due to their energy separation, their\nopposite Berry curvature can be observed in valley Hall effect experiments and\nin the structure of the Landau levels. Based on the electronic structure\nobtained by Density Functional Theory, we develop a low energy Hamiltonian that\ndescribes the effects of pressure on measurable quantities such as the Hall\nconductivity and the Landau levels of the system.\n", "  Which quantum states minimise the unavoidable uncertainty arising from the\nnon-commutativity of two observables? The immediate answer to such a question\nis: it depends. Due to the plethora of uncertainty measures there are many\nanswers. Here, instead of restricting our study to a particular measure, we\npresent plausible axioms for the set $\\mathcal{F}$ of bona-fide\ninformation-theoretic uncertainty functions. Then, we discuss the existence of\nstates minimising uncertainty with respect to all members of $\\mathcal{F}$,\ni.e., universal minimum uncertainty states (MUS). We prove that such states do\nnot exist within the full state space and study the effect of classical noise\non the structure of minimum uncertainty states. We present an explicit example\nof a qubit universal MUS that arises when purity is constrained by introducing\na threshold amount of noise. For higher dimensional systems we derive several\nno-go results limiting the existence of noisy universal MUS. However, we\nconjecture that universality may emerge in an approximate sense. We conclude by\ndiscussing connections with thermodynamics, and highlight the privileged role\nthat non-equilibrium free energy $F_2$ plays close to equilibrium.\n", "  This paper investigates the fast Hamiltonian control of $n=2$ density\noperators by continuously varying the flag as one moves away from the\ncompletely mixed state. In general, the critical points and zeros of the purity\nderivative can only be solved analytically in the limit of minimal purity. We\nderive differential equations that maintain these features as the purity\nincreases. In particular, there is a thread of points in the Bloch ball that\nlocally maximizes the purity derivative, and a corresponding thread that\nminimizes it. Additionally, we show there is a closed surface of points inside\nof which the purity derivative is positive, and inside of which is negative. We\nargue that this approach may be useful in studying higher-dimensional systems.\n", "  We show the possibility of long-range ferrimagnetic ordering with a\nsaturation magnetisation of the order of 1 Bohr magneton per spin for\narbitrarily low concentration of magnetic impurities in semiconductors,\nprovided that the impurities form a superstructure satisfying the conditions of\nthe Lieb-Mattis theorem. Explicit examples of such superstructures are given\nfor the wurtzite lattice, and the temperature of ferrimagnetic transition is\nestimated from a high-temperature expansion. Exact diagonalization studies show\nthat small fragments of the structure exhibit enhanced magnetic response and\nisotropic superparamagnetism at low temperatures. A quantum transition in a\nhigh magnetic field is considered and similar superstructures in cubic\nsemiconductors are discussed as well.\n", "  We consider the model of a single optical cavity mode interacting with\ntwo-level systems (spins) driven by a linearly time-dependent field. When this\nfield passes through values at which spin energy level splittings become\ncomparable to spin coupling to the optical mode, a cascade of Landau-Zener (LZ)\ntransitions leads to co-flips of spins in exchange for photons of the cavity.\nWe derive exact transition probabilities between different diabatic states\ninduced by such a sweep of the field.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework for the linear and nonlinear visco-elastic\nproperties of reversibly crosslinked networks of semiflexible polymers. In\ncontrast to affine models where network strain couples to the polymer\nend-to-end distance, in our model strain rather serves to locally distort the\nnetwork structure. This induces bending modes in the polymer filaments, the\nproperties of wich are slaved to the surrounding network structure.\nSpecifically, we investigate the frequency-dependent linear rheology, in\nparticular in combination with crosslink binding/unbinding processes. We also\ndevelop schematic extensions to describe the nonlinear response during creep\nmeasurements as well as during constant-strainrate ramps.\n", "  We calculate---for the first time in three-flavor lattice QCD---the hadronic\nmatrix elements of all five local operators that contribute to neutral $B^0$-\nand $B_s$-meson mixing in and beyond the Standard Model. We present a complete\nerror budget for each matrix element and also provide the full set of\ncorrelations among the matrix elements. We also present the corresponding bag\nparameters and their correlations, as well as specific combinations of the\nmixing matrix elements that enter the expression for the neutral $B$-meson\nwidth difference. We obtain the most precise determination to date of the\nSU(3)-breaking ratio $\\xi = 1.206(18)(6)$, where the second error stems from\nthe omission of charm sea quarks, while the first encompasses all other\nuncertainties. The threefold reduction in total uncertainty, relative to the\n2013 Flavor Lattice Averaging Group results, tightens the constraint from $B$\nmixing on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity triangle. Our\ncalculation employs gauge-field ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration\nwith four lattice spacings and pion masses close to the physical value. We use\nthe asqtad-improved staggered action for the light valence quarks, and the\nFermilab method for the bottom quark. We use heavy-light meson chiral\nperturbation theory modified to include lattice-spacing effects to extrapolate\nthe five matrix elements to the physical point. We combine our results with\nexperimental measurements of the neutral $B$-meson oscillation frequencies to\ndetermine the CKM matrix elements $|V_{td}| = 8.00(34)(8) \\times 10^{-3}$,\n$|V_{ts}| = 39.0(1.2)(0.4) \\times 10^{-3}$, and $|V_{td}/V_{ts}| =\n0.2052(31)(10)$, which differ from CKM-unitarity expectations by about\n2$\\sigma$. These results and others from flavor-changing-neutral currents point\ntowards an emerging tension between weak processes that are mediated at the\nloop and tree levels.\n", "  The geometry and topology of quantum systems have deep connections to quantum\ndynamics. In this paper, I show how to measure the non-Abelian Berry curvature\nand its related topological invariant, the second Chern number, using dynamical\ntechniques. The second Chern number is the defining topological characteristic\nof the four-dimensional generalization of the quantum Hall effect and has\nrelevance in systems from three-dimensional topological insulators to\nYang-Mills field theory. I illustrate its measurement using the simple example\nof a spin-3/2 particle in an electric quadrupole field. I show how one can\ndynamically measure diagonal components of the Berry curvature in an\nover-complete basis of the degenerate ground state space and use this to\nextract the full non-Abelian Berry curvature. I also show that one can\naccomplish the same ideas by stochastically averaging over random initial\nstates in the degenerate ground state manifold. Finally I show how this system\ncan be manufactured and the topological invariant measured in a variety of\nrealistic systems, from superconducting qubits to trapped ions and cold atoms.\n", "  We derive the single-particle eigenenergies and eigenfunctions for massless\nDirac fermions confined to the surface of a sphere in the presence of a\nmagnetic monopole, i.e., we solve the Landau level problem for electrons in\ngraphene on the Haldane sphere. With the single-particle eigenfunctions and\neigenenergies we calculate the Haldane pseudopotentials for the Coulomb\ninteraction in the second Landau level and calculate the effective\npseudopotentials characterizing an effective Landau level mixing Hamiltonian\nentirely in the spherical geometry to be used in theoretical studies of the\nfractional quantum Hall effect in graphene. Our treatment is analogous to the\nformalism in the planar geometry and reduces to the planar results in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  We present deep optical images of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC\nand SMC) using a low cost telephoto lens with a wide field of view to explore\nstellar substructure in the outskirts of the stellar disk of the LMC (r < 10\ndegrees from the center). These data have higher resolution than existing star\ncount maps, and highlight the existence of stellar arcs and multiple spiral\narms in the northern periphery, with no comparable counterparts in the South.\nWe compare these data to detailed simulations of the LMC disk outskirts,\nfollowing interactions with its low mass companion, the SMC. We consider\ninteraction in isolation and with the inclusion of the Milky Way tidal field.\nThe simulations are used to assess the origin of the northern structures,\nincluding also the low density stellar arc recently identified in the DES data\nby Mackey et al. 2015 at ~ 15 degrees. We conclude that repeated close\ninteractions with the SMC are primarily responsible for the asymmetric stellar\nstructures seen in the periphery of the LMC. The orientation and density of\nthese arcs can be used to constrain the LMC's interaction history with and\nimpact parameter of the SMC. More generally, we find that such asymmetric\nstructures should be ubiquitous about pairs of dwarfs and can persist for 1-2\nGyr even after the secondary merges entirely with the primary. As such, the\nlack of a companion around a Magellanic Irregular does not disprove the\nhypothesis that their asymmetric structures are driven by dwarf-dwarf\ninteractions.\n", "  We analysed the $\\phi$ meson production in central Ni+Ni collisions at the\nbeam kinetic energy of 1.93A GeV with the FOPI spectrometer and found the\nproduction probability per event of $[8.6 ~\\pm~ 1.6 ~(\\text{stat}) \\pm 1.5\n~(\\text{syst})] \\times 10^{-4}$. This new data point allows for the first time\nto inspect the centrality dependence of the subthreshold $\\phi$ meson\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions. The rise of $\\phi$ meson multiplicity per\nevent with mean number of participants can be parameterized by the power\nfunction with exponent $\\alpha = 1.8 \\pm 0.6$. The ratio of $\\phi$ to\n$\\text{K}^-$ production yields seems not to depend within the experimental\nuncertainties on the collision centrality, and the average of measured values\nwas found to be $0.36 \\pm 0.05$.\n", "  Conventionally ordered magnets possess bosonic elementary excitations, called\nmagnons. By contrast, no magnetic insulators in more than one dimension are\nknown whose excitations are not bosons but fermions. Theoretically, some\nquantum spin liquids (QSLs) -- new topological phases which can occur when\nquantum fluctuations preclude an ordered state -- are known to exhibit Majorana\nfermions as quasiparticles arising from fractionalization of spins. Alas,\ndespite much searching, their experimental observation remains elusive. Here,\nwe show that fermionic excitations are remarkably directly evident in\nexperimental Raman scattering data across a broad energy and temperature range\nin the two-dimensional material $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This shows the importance of\nmagnetic materials as hosts of Majorana fermions. In turn, this first\nsystematic evaluation of the dynamics of a QSL at finite temperature emphasizes\nthe role of excited states for detecting such exotic properties associated with\notherwise hard-to-identify topological QSLs.\n", "  Vacuum stability in the Standard Model is problematic as the Higgs quartic\nself-coupling runs negative at a renormalization scale of about $10^{10}$ GeV.\nWe consider a non-supersymmetric SO(10) grand unification model for which gauge\ncoupling unification is made possible through an intermediate scale gauge\ngroup, $G_{\\text{int}}=\\text{SU}(3)_C\\otimes \\text{SU}(2)_L\\otimes\n\\text{SU}(2)_R \\otimes \\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$. $G_{\\text{int}}$ is broken by the\nvacuum expectation value of a 126 of SO(10) which not only provides for\nneutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism but also preserves a discrete\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ that can account for the stability of a dark matter candidate,\nhere taken to be the Standard Model singlet component of a bosonic 16. We show\nthat in addition to these features the model insures the positivity of the\nHiggs quartic coupling through its interactions to the dark matter multiplet\nand 126. We also show that the Higgs mass squared runs negative triggering\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. Thus, the vacuum stability is achieved along\nwith radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and captures two more important\nelements of supersymmetric models without low-energy supersymmetry. The\nconditions for perturbativity of quartic couplings and for radiative\nelectroweak symmetry breaking lead to tight upper and lower limits on the dark\nmatter mass, respectively, and this dark matter mass region (1.35-2 TeV) can be\nprobed in future direct detection experiments.\n", "  The differential cross section of high-energy electroproduction in the\nelectric field of heavy atoms is derived. The result is obtained with the exact\naccount of the atomic field by means of the quasiclassical approximation to the\nwave functions in the external field. The Coulomb corrections substantially\nmodify the differential cross section compared with the Born result. They lead\nto the azimuth asymmetry in the differential cross section for the polarized\nincoming electron. The Coulomb corrections to the total cross section are\nobtained in the leading logarithmic approximation.\n", "  MMonochromatic neutrinos from dark matter annihilations ($\\chi\\chi\\to\n\\nu\\bar\\nu$) are always produced in association with a gamma-ray spectrum\ngenerated by electroweak bremsstrahlung. Consequently, these neutrino lines can\nbe searched for not only with neutrino detectors but also indirectly with\ngamma-ray telescopes. Here, we derive limits on the dark matter annihilation\ncross section into neutrinos based on recent Fermi-LAT and HESS data. We find\nthat, for dark matter masses above 200 GeV, gamma-ray data actually set the\nmost stringent constraints on neutrino lines from dark matter annihilation and,\ntherefore, an upper bound on the dark matter total annihilation cross section.\nIn addition, we point out that gamma-ray telescopes, unlike neutrino detectors,\nhave the potential to distinguish the flavor of the final state neutrino. Our\nresults indicate that we have already entered into a new era where gamma-ray\ntelescopes are more sensitive than neutrino detectors to neutrino lines from\ndark matter annihilation.\n", "  We study systems which are close to or within the many-body localized (MBL)\nregime and are driven by strong electric field. In the ergodic regime, the\ndisorder extends applicability of the equilibrium linear--response theory to\nstronger drivings, whereas the response of the MBL systems is very distinctive,\nrevealing currents with damped oscillations. The oscillation frequency is\nindependent of driving and the damping is not due to heating but rather due to\ndephasing. The details of damping depend on the system's history reflecting\nnonergodicity of the MBL phase, while the frequency of the oscillations remains\na robust hallmark of localization. We show that the distinctive characteristic\nof the driven MBL phase is also a logarithmic increase of the energy and the\npolarization with time.\n", "  Heisenberg spin chains can act as quantum wires transferring quantum states\neither perfectly or with high fidelity. Gaussian packets of excitations passing\nthrough dual rails can encode the two states of a logical qubit, depending on\nwhich rail is empty and which rail is carrying the packet. With extra\ninteractions in one or between different chains, one can introduce interaction\nzones in arrays of such chains, where specific one or two qubit gates act on\nany qubit which passes through these interaction zones. Therefore universal\nquantum computation is made possible in a static way where no external control\nis needed. This scheme will then pave the way for a scalable way of quantum\ncomputation where specific hardwares can be connected to make large quantum\ncircuits. Our scheme is an improvement of a recent scheme where we have\nachieved to borrow an idea from quantum electrodynamics to replace non-local\ninteractions between spin chains with local interactions mediated by an\nancillary chain.\n", "  Generating non-reciprocal radio frequency transduction plays important roles\nin a wide range of research and applications, and an aspiration is to integrate\nthis functionality into micro-circuit without introducing magnetic field,\nwhich, however, remains challenging. By designing a 1D artificial lattice\nstructure with neighbor-interaction engineered parametrically, we predicted a\nnon-reciprocity transduction with giant unidirectionality. We then\nexperimentally demonstrated the phenomenon on a nano-electromechanical chip\nfabricated by conventional complementary metal-silicon processing. A\nunidirectionality with isolation as high as 24dB is achieved and several\ndifferent transduction schemes are realized by programming the control voltages\ntopology. Apart from being used as a radio frequency isolator, the system\nprovides a way to build practical on-chip programmable device for many\nresearches and applications in radio frequency domain.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility to drive an antiferromagnet domain-wall at\nhigh velocities by field-like N\\'{e}el spin-orbit torques. Such torques arise\nfrom current-induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each\nsub-lattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depend primarily on\nthe current direction, giving them their field-like character. The domain-wall\nvelocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are two orders of magnitude\ngreater than the ones in ferromagnets. This arises from the efficiency of the\nstaggered spin-orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the\nexchange-enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics, which leads\nto a low domain-wall effective mass and the absence of a Walker break-down\nlimit. In addition, because of its nature, the staggered spin-orbit field can\nlift the degeneracy between two 180$^\\circ$ rotated states in a collinear\nantiferromagnet and provides a force that can move such walls and control the\nswitching of the states.\n", "  We present HST images for nine megamaser disk galaxies with the primary goal\nof studying photometric BH-galaxy scaling relations. The megamaser disks\nprovide the highest-precision extragalactic BH mass measurements, while our\nhigh-resolution HST imaging affords us the opportunity to decompose the complex\nnuclei of their late-type hosts in detail. Based on the morphologies and shapes\nof the galaxy nuclei, we argue that most of these galaxies' central regions\ncontain secularly evolving components (pseudo-bulges), and in many cases we\nphotometrically identify co-existing \"classical\" bulge components as well.\nUsing these decompositions, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The\nmegamaser BH masses span two orders of magnitude ($10^6$ -- $10^8 M_\\odot$)\nwhile the stellar mass of their spiral host galaxies are all $\\sim 10^{11}\nM_\\odot$ within a factor of three; (2) the BH masses at a given bulge mass or\ntotal stellar mass in the megamaser host spiral galaxies tend to be lower than\nexpected, when compared to an extrapolation of the BH-bulge relation based on\nearly-type galaxies; (3) the observed large intrinsic scatter of BH masses in\nthe megamaser host galaxies raises the question of whether scaling relations\nexist in spiral galaxies.\n", "  We show that coupling ultracold atoms in optical lattices to quantized modes\nof an optical cavity leads to quantum phases of matter, which at the same time\nposses properties of systems with both short- and long-range interactions. This\nopens perspectives for novel quantum simulators of finite-range interacting\nsystems, even though the light-induced interaction is global (i.e. infinitely\nlong range). This is achieved by spatial structuring of the global light-matter\ncoupling at a microscopic scale. Such simulators can directly benefit from the\ncollective enhancement of the global light-matter interaction and constitute an\nalternative to standard approaches using Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. The\nsystem in the steady state of light induces effective many-body interactions\nthat change the landscape of the phase diagram of the typical Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. Therefore, the system can support non-trivial superfluid states, bosonic\ndimer, trimers, etc. states and supersolid phases depending on the choice of\nthe wavelength and pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical\nlattice potential. We find that by carefully choosing the system parameters one\ncan investigate diverse strongly correlated physics with the same setup, i.e.,\nmodifying the geometry of light beams. In particular, we present the interplay\nbetween the density and bond (or matter-wave coherence) interactions. We show\nhow to tune the effective interaction length in such a hybrid system with both\nshort-range and global interactions.\n", "  We follow up on a suggestion by Adams and construct explicit domain wall\nfermion operators with staggered kernels. We compare different domain wall\nformulations, namely the standard construction as well as Borici's modified and\nChiu's optimal construction, utilizing both Wilson and staggered kernels. In\nthe process, we generalize the staggered kernels to arbitrary even dimensions\nand introduce both truncated and optimal staggered domain wall fermions. Some\nnumerical investigations are carried out in the (1+1)-dimensional setting of\nthe Schwinger model, where we explore spectral properties of the bulk,\neffective and overlap Dirac operators in the free-field case, on quenched\nthermalized gauge configurations and on smooth topological configurations. We\ncompare different formulations using the effective mass, deviations from\nnormality and violations of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation as measures of\nchirality.\n", "  In this letter, we consider a class of scenarios in which the dark matter is\npart of a heavy hidden sector that is thermally decoupled from the Standard\nModel in the early universe. The dark matter freezes-out by annihilating to a\nlighter, metastable state, whose subsequent abundance can naturally come to\ndominate the energy density of the universe. When this state decays, it reheats\nthe visible sector and dilutes all relic abundances, thereby allowing the dark\nmatter to be orders of magnitude heavier than the weak scale. For concreteness,\nwe consider a simple realization with a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate\ncoupled to a massive gauge boson that decays to the Standard Model through its\nkinetic mixing with hypercharge. We identify viable parameter space in which\nthe dark matter can be as heavy as ~1-100 PeV without being overproduced in the\nearly universe.\n", "  Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the\nprocess of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis\nshows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host\nstars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact\noutcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass\nloss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.\nIn this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments\nin Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous\nplanets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion\nthat accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that\ndepends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a\ngas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction\nthat can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO.\nWe conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed\npopulation of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that\nmay be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some\nshort-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can\nelucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain\nlargely unconstrained.\n", "  The Geminga pulsar, one of the brighest gamma-ray sources, is a promising\ncandidate for emission of very-high-energy (VHE > 100 GeV) pulsed gamma rays.\nAlso, detection of a large nebula have been claimed by water Cherenkov\ninstruments. We performed deep observations of Geminga with the MAGIC\ntelescopes, yielding 63 hours of good-quality data, and searched for emission\nfrom the pulsar and pulsar wind nebula. We did not find any significant\ndetection, and derived 95% confidence level upper limits. The resulting upper\nlimits of 5.3 x 10^{-13} TeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} for the Geminga pulsar and 3.5 x\n10^{-12} TeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} for the surrounding nebula at 50 GeV are the most\nconstraining ones obtained so far at VHE. To complement the VHE observations,\nwe also analyzed 5 years of Fermi-LAT data from Geminga, finding that the\nsub-exponential cut-off is preferred over the exponential cut-off that has been\ntypically used in the literature. We also find that, above 10 GeV, the\ngamma-ray spectra from Geminga can be described with a power law with index\nsofter than 5. The extrapolation of the power-law Fermi-LAT pulsed spectra to\nVHE goes well below the MAGIC upper limits, indicating that the detection of\npulsed emission from Geminga with the current generation of Cherenkov\ntelescopes is very difficult.\n", "  We propose a set of subradiant states which can be prepared and detected in a\none-dimensional optical lattice. We find that the decay rates are highly\ndependent on the spatial phases imprinted on the atomic chain, which gives\nsystematic investigations of the subradiance in the fluorescence experiments.\nThe time evolution of these states can have long decay time where up to hundred\nmilliseconds of lifetime is predicted for one hundred atoms. They can also show\ndecayed Rabi-like oscillations with a beating frequency determined by the\ndifference of cooperative Lamb shift in the subspace. Experimental requirements\nare also discussed for practical implementation of the subradiant states. Our\nproposal provides a novel scheme for quantum storage of photons in arrays of\ntwo-level atoms through the preparation and detection of subradiant states,\nwhich offer opportunities for quantum many-body state preparation and quantum\ninformation processing in optical lattices.\n", "  In a recent paper, Smith and Tombleson (2015) state that the Luminous Blue\nVariables (LBVs) in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds are isolated; that\nthey are not spatially associated with young O-type stars. They propose a novel\nexplanation that would overturn the standard view of LBVs. In this paper we\ntest their hypothesis for the LBVs in M31 and M33 as well as the LMC and SMC.\nIn M31 and M33, the LBVs are associated with luminous young stars and\nsupergiants appropriate to their luminosities and positions on the HR Diagram.\nMoreover, in the Smith and Tombleson scenario most of the LBVs should be\nrunaway stars, but the stars' velocities are consistent with their positions in\nthe respective galaxies. In the Magellanic Clouds, those authors' sample was a\nmixed population. We reassess their analysis, removing seven stars that have no\nclear relation to LBVs. When we separate the more massive classical and the\nless luminous LBVs, the classical LBVs have a distribution similar to the late\nO-type stars, while the less luminous LBVs have a distribution like the red\nsupergiants. None of the confirmed LBVs have high velocities or are candidate\nrunaway stars. These results support the accepted description of LBVs as\nevolved massive stars that have shed a lot of mass, and are now close to their\nEddington limit.\n", "  We observe and characterize intrinsic optical bistability in a dilute Rydberg\nvapor. The bistability is characterized by sharp jumps between states of low\nand high Rydberg occupancy with jump up and down positions displaying\nhysteresis depending on the direction in which the control parameter is\nchanged. We find that the shift in frequency of the jump point scales with the\nfourth power of the principal quantum number. Also, the width of the hysteresis\nwindow increases with increasing principal quantum number, before reaching a\npeak and then closing again. The experimental results are consistent with\npredictions from a simple theoretical model based on semiclassical\nMaxwell-Bloch equations including the effect of broadening and frequency\nshifts. These results provide insight to the dynamics of driven dissipative\nsystems.\n", "  The staggered quantum walk model allows to establish an unprecedented\nconnection between discrete-time quantum walks and graph theory. We call\nattention to the fact that a large subclass of the coined model is included in\nSzegedy's model, which in its turn is entirely included in the staggered model.\nIn order to compare those three quantum walk models, we put them in the\nstaggered formalism and we show that the Szegedy and coined models are defined\non a special subclass of graphs. This inclusion scheme is also true when the\nsearching framework is added. We use graph theory to characterize which\nstaggered quantum walks can be reduced to the Szegedy or coined quantum walk\nmodel. We analyze a staggered-based search that cannot be included in Szegedy's\nmodel and we show numerically that this search is more efficient than a\nrandom-walk-based search.\n", "  We investigate when Taylor expansions can be used to prove the Runge-Gross\nTheorem, which is at the foundation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory\n(TDDFT). We start with a general analysis of the conditions for the Runge-Gross\nargument, especially the time-differentiability of the density. The latter\nshould be questioned in the presence of singular (e.g. Coulomb) potentials.\nThen, we show that a singular potential in a one-body operator considerably\ndecreases the class of time-dependent external potentials to which the original\nargument can be applied. A two-body singularity has an even stronger impact and\nan external potential is essentially incompatible with it. For the Coulomb\ninteraction and all reasonable initial many-body states, the Taylor expansion\nonly exists to a finite order, except for constant external potentials.\nTherefore, high-order Taylor expansions are not the right tool to study atoms\nand molecules in TDDFT.\n", "  In this study, we reanalyze the magnetic interactions in the Kitaev spin\nliquid candidate materials Na$_2$IrO$_3$, $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and\n$\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ using nonperturbative exact diagonalization methods.\nThese methods are more appropriate given the relatively itinerant nature of the\nsystems suggested in previous works. We treat all interactions up to third\nneighbours on equal footing. The computed terms reveal significant long range\ncoupling, bond-anisotropy, and/or off-diagonal couplings which we argue\nnaturally explain the observed ordered phases in these systems. Given these\nobservations, the potential for realizing the spin-liquid state in real\nmaterials is analyzed, and synthetic challenges are defined and explained.\n", "  The ability to induce a sizable gap in the excitation spectrum of a normal\nlayer placed in contact with a conventional superconductor has become\nincreasingly important in recent years in the context of engineering a\ntopological superconductor. The quasiclassical theory of the proximity effect\nshows that Andreev reflection at the superconductor/normal interface induces a\nnonzero pairing amplitude in the metal but does not endow it with a gap.\nConversely, when the normal layer is atomically thin, the tunneling of Cooper\npairs induces an excitation gap that can be as large as the bulk gap of the\nsuperconductor. We study how these two seemingly different views of the\nproximity effect evolve into one another as the thickness of the normal layer\nis changed. We show that a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of the problem\npredicts that the induced gap is always finite but falls off with the thickness\nof the normal layer, $d$. If $d$ is less than a certain crossover scale, which\nis much larger than the Fermi wavelength, the induced gap is comparable to the\nbulk gap. As a result, a sizable excitation gap can be induced in normal layers\nthat are much thicker than the Fermi wavelength.\n", "  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) contains perturbations that are close\nto Gaussian and isotropic. This means that its information content, in the\nsense of the ability to constrain cosmological models, is closely related to\nthe number of modes probed in CMB power spectra. Rather than making forecasts\nfor specific experimental setups, here we take a more pedagogical approach and\nask how much information we can extract from the CMB if we are only limited by\nsample variance. We show that, compared with temperature measurements, the\naddition of E-mode polarization doubles the number of modes available out to a\nfixed maximum multipole, provided that all of the TT, TE, and EE power spectra\nare measured. However, the situation in terms of constraints on particular\nparameters is more complicated, as we explain and illustrate graphically. We\nalso discuss the enhancements in information that can come from adding B-mode\npolarization and gravitational lensing. We show how well one could ever\ndetermine the basic cosmological parameters from CMB data compared with what\nhas been achieved with Planck, which has already probed a substantial fraction\nof the TT information. Lastly, we look at constraints on neutrino mass as a\nspecific example of how lensing information improves future prospects beyond\nthe current 6-parameter model.\n", "  Entanglement-assisted quantum communication employs pre-shared entanglement\nbetween sender and receiver as a resource. We apply the same framework to\nquantum metrology, introducing shared entanglement between the preparation and\nthe measurement stage, namely using some entangled ancillary system that does\nnot interact with the system to be sampled. This is known to be useless in the\nnoiseless case, but was recently shown to be useful in the presence of noise.\nHere we detail how and when it can be of use. For example, surprisingly it is\nuseful when randomly time sharing two channels where ancillas do not help\n(depolarizing). We show that it is useful for all levels of noise for many\nnoise models and propose a simple experiment to test these results.\n", "  Large scale tidal field estimated directly from the distribution of dark\nmatter halos is used to investigate how halo shapes and spin vectors are\naligned with the cosmic web. The major, intermediate and minor axes of halos\nare aligned with the corresponding tidal axes, and halo spin axes tend to be\nparallel with the intermediate axes and perpendicular to the major axes of\ntidal field. The strengths of these alignments generally increase with halo\nmass and redshift, but the dependencies are only through the peak height,\n{\\nu}. The scaling relations of the alignment strengths with the value of {\\nu}\nindicate that the alignment strengths remain roughly constant when the\nstructures within which the halos reside are still in quasi-linear regime, but\ndecreases as nonlinear evolution becomes more important. We also calculate the\nalignments in projection so that our results can be compared directly with\nobservations. Finally, we investigate the alignments of tidal tensors on large\nscales, and use the results to understand alignments of halo pairs separated at\nvarious distances. Our results suggest coherent structure of the tidal field is\nthe underlying reason for the alignments of halos and galaxies seen in\nnumerical simulations and in observations.\n", "  We incorporate gauge-invariant local composite operators into the\ntwistor-space formulation of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In this\nformulation, the interactions of the elementary fields are reorganized into\ninfinitely many interaction vertices and we argue that the same applies to\ncomposite operators. To test our definition of the local composite operators in\ntwistor space, we compute several corresponding form factors, thereby also\ninitiating the study of form factors using the position twistor-space\nframework. Throughout this letter, we use the composite operator built from two\nidentical complex scalars as a pedagogical example; we treat the general case\nin a follow-up paper.\n", "  It is always some constraint that yields any nontrivial structure from\nstatistical averages. As epitomized by the Boltzmann distribution, the energy\nconservation is often the principal constraint acting on mechanical systems.\nHere, we investigate a different type: the topological constraint imposed on\n`space'. Such constraint emerges from the null space of the Poisson operator\nlinking energy gradient to phase space velocity, and appears as an adiabatic\ninvariant altering the preserved phase space volume at the core of statistical\nmechanics. The correct measure of entropy, built on the distorted invariant\nmeasure, behaves consistently with the second law of thermodynamics. The\nopposite behavior (decreasing entropy and negative entropy production) arises\nin arbitrary coordinates. An ensamble of rotating rigid bodies is worked out.\nThe theory is then applied to up-hill diffusion in a magnetosphere.\n", "  We propose a flavor symmetric approach to unify the origin of dark matter\n(DM) with the non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ in the lepton sector. In this framework,\nbreaking of a $U(1)$ flavor symmetry to a remnant $Z_2$ ensures the stability\nof the DM and gives rise to a modification to the existing $A_4$-based\ntri-bimaximal neutrino mixing to attain the required non-zero $\\sin\n\\theta_{13}$. This results in a range of Higgs portal coupling of the DM which\ncan be potentially accessible at various ongoing and future direct and collider\nsearch experiments.\n", "  A study of the $\\lambda$- and $N$-atomic configurations under dipolar\ninteraction with $2$ modes of electromagnetic radiation is presented. The\ncorresponding quantum phase diagrams are obtained by means of a variational\nprocedure. Both configurations exhibit normal and collective (super-radiant)\nregimes. While the latter in the $\\lambda$-configuration divides itself into\n$2$ subregions, corresponding to each of the modes, that in the\n$N$-configuration may be divided into $2$ or $3$ subregions depending on\nwhether the field modes divide the atomic system into $2$ separate subsystems\nor not.\n  Our variational procedure compares well with the exact quantum solution. The\nproperties of the relevant field and matter observables are obtained.\n", "  The Galactic bulge, that is the prominent out-of-plane over-density present\nin the inner few kiloparsecs of the Galaxy, is a complex structure, as the\nmorphology, kinematics, chemistry and ages of its stars indicate. To understand\nthe nature of its main components -- those at [Fe/H] >~ -1 dex -- it is\nnecessary to make an inventory of the stellar populations of the Galactic\ndisc(s), and of their borders : the chemistry of the disc at the solar\nvicinity, well known from detailed studies of stars over many years, is not\nrepresentative of the whole disc. This finding, together with the recent\nrevisions of the mass and sizes of the thin and thick discs, constitutes a\nmajor step in understanding the bulge complexity. N-body models of a\nboxy/peanut-shaped bulge formed from a thin disc through the intermediary of a\nbar have been successful in interpreting a number of global properties of the\nGalactic bulge, but they fail in reproducing the detailed chemo-kinematic\nrelations satisfied by its components and their morphology. It is only by\nadding the thick disc to the picture that we can understand the nature of the\nGalactic bulge.\n", "  A systematic study of hadron masses and widths shows regular oscillations\nthat can be fitted by a simple cosine function. This property can be observed\nwhen the difference between adjacent masses of each family is plotted versus\nthe mean mass.\n", "  For quantum field theories with topological sectors, Monte Carlo simulations\non fine lattices tend to be obstructed by an extremely long auto-correlation\ntime with respect to the topological charge. Then reliable numerical\nmeasurements are feasible only within individual sectors. The challenge is to\nassemble such restricted measurements in a way that leads to a substantiated\napproximation to the fully fledged result, which would correspond to the\ncorrect sampling over the entire set of configurations. We test an approach for\nsuch a topological summation, which was suggested by Brower, Chandrasekharan,\nNegele and Wiese. Under suitable conditions, energy levels and susceptibilities\ncan be obtained to a good accuracy, as we demonstrate for O(N) models, SU(2)\nYang-Mills theory, and for the Schwinger model.\n", "  The passive states of a quantum system minimize the average energy among all\nthe states with a given spectrum. We prove that passive states are the optimal\ninputs of single-jump lossy quantum channels. These channels arise from a weak\ninteraction of the quantum system of interest with a large Markovian bath in\nits ground state, such that the interaction Hamiltonian couples only\nconsecutive energy eigenstates of the system. We prove that the output\ngenerated by any input state $\\rho$ majorizes the output generated by the\npassive input state $\\rho_0$ with the same spectrum of $\\rho$. Then, the output\ngenerated by $\\rho$ can be obtained applying a random unitary operation to the\noutput generated by $\\rho_0$. This is an extension of De Palma et al., IEEE\nTrans. Inf. Theory 62, 2895 (2016), where the same result is proved for\none-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. We also prove that for finite temperature\nthis optimality property can fail already in a two-level system, where the best\ninput is a coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates.\n", "  A known feature of electrically charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti-de Sitter\nplanar black holes is that they can become unstable when considered as\nsolutions of Einstein--Yang-Mills theory. The mechanism for this is that the\nlinearized Yang-Mills equations in the background of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\n(RN) black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-Abelian\n(nA) magnetic clouds near the horizon. In this work we show that the same\npattern may occur also for asymptotically flat RN black holes. Different from\nthe anti-de Sitter case, in the Minkowskian background the prerequisite for the\nexistence of the nA clouds is $i)$ a large enough gauge group and $ii)$ the\npresence of some extra interaction terms in the matter Lagrangian. To\nillustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and the\nother in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. In the first case, we\naugment the usual $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic)\ncurvature term, while for the second one we add the Chern-Simons density to the\n$SO(6)$ Yang-Mills system. In both cases, an Abelian gauge symmetry is\nspontaneously broken near a RN black hole horizon with the appearance of a\ncondensate of nA gauge fields. In addition to these two examples, we review the\ncorresponding picture for anti-de Sitter black holes. All these solutions are\nstudied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs being provided for\nnA clouds in the background of RN black holes. The proofs use shooting\ntechniques which are suggested by and in turn offer insights for our numerical\nmethods. They indicate that, for a black hole of given mass, appropriate\nelectric charge values are required to ensure the existence of solutions\ninterpolating desired boundary behavior at the horizons and spatial infinity.\n", "  We review the dynamics after quantum quenches in integrable quantum spin\nchains. We give a pedagogical introduction to relaxation in isolated quantum\nsystems, and discuss the description of the steady state by (gen- eralized)\nGibbs ensembles. When then turn to general features in the time evolution of\nlocal observables after the quench, using a simple model of free fermions as an\nexample. In the second part we present an overview of recent progress in\ndescribing quench dynamics in two key paradigms for quantum integrable models,\nthe transverse field Ising chain and the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.\n", "  We present the implementation of a programmable atom-photon quantum\ninterface, employing a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion and single photons.\nDepending on its mode of operation, the interface serves as a bi-directional\natom-photon quantum-state converter, as a source of entangled atom-photon\nstates, or as a quantum frequency converter of single photons. The interface\nlends itself particularly to interfacing ions with single or entangled photons\nin hybrid quantum networks.\n", "  Observations reveal that mass-transferring binary systems may have non-zero\norbital eccentricities. The time-evolution of the orbital semi-major axis and\neccentricity of mass-transferring eccentric binary systems is an important part\nof binary evolution theory and has been widely studied. However, various\ndifferent approaches and assumptions on the subject have made the literature\ndifficult to comprehend and comparisons between different orbital element\ntime-evolution equations not easy to make. Consequently, no self-consistent\ntreatment of this phase has been ever included in binary population synthesis\ncodes. In this paper, we present a general formalism to derive the\ntime-evolution equations of the binary orbital elements, treating mass-loss and\nmass-transfer as perturbations to the general two-body problem. We present the\nself-consistent form of the perturbing acceleration and the phase-dependent\ntime-evolution equations for the orbital elements under different\nmass-loss/transfer processes. First, we study the cases of isotropic and\nanisotropic wind mass-loss. Then, we proceed with the non-isotropic ejection\nand accretion in conservative as well as non-conservative manner for both point\nmasses and extended bodies. Comparison of the derived equations with similar\nwork in the literature is made and explanation of the existing discrepancies is\nprovided.\n", "  Finite eccentricities in mass-transferring eccentric binary systems can be\nexplained by taking into account mass-loss and mass-transfer processes that\noften occur in these systems. These processes can be treated as perturbations\nto the general two-body problem. The time-evolution equations for the\nsemi-major axis and the eccentricity derived from perturbative methods are in\ngeneral phase-dependent. The osculating semi-major axis and eccentricity change\nover the orbital timescale and they are not easy to implement in binary\nevolution codes like MESA. However, the secular orbital element evolution\nequations can be simplified averaging over the rapidly varying true anomalies.\nIn this paper, we derive the secular time-evolution equations for the\nsemi-major axis and the eccentricity for various mass-loss/transfer processes\nusing either the adiabatic approximation or the assumption of delta-function\nmass-loss/transfer at periastron. We begin with the cases of isotropic and\nanisotropic wind mass-loss. We continue with conservative and non-conservative\nnon-isotropic mass ejection/accretion (including RLOF) for both point-masses\nand extended bodies. We conclude with the case of phase-dependent mass\naccretion. Comparison of the derived equations with similar work in the\nliterature is included and explanation of the existing discrepancies is\nprovided.\n", "  I review the literature covering the issue of interstellar extinction toward\nthe Milky Way bulge, with emphasis placed on findings from planetary nebulae,\nRR Lyrae, and red clump stars. I also report on observations from HI gas and\nglobular clusters. I show that there has been substantial progress in this\nfield in recent decades, most particularly from red clump stars. The spatial\ncoverage of extinction maps has increased by a factor $\\sim 100 \\times$ in the\npast twenty years, and the total-to-selective extinction ratios reported have\nshifted by $\\sim$20-25\\%, indicative of the improved accuracy and separately,\nof a steeper-than-standard extinction curve. Problems remain in modelling\ndifferential extinction, explaining anomalies involving the planetary nebulae,\nand understanding the difference between bulge extinction coefficients and\n\"standard\" literature values.\n", "  We propose a definition of mass for characteristic hypersurfaces in\nasymptotically vacuum space-times with non-vanishing cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda \\in {\\mathbb R}^*$, generalising the definition of Trautman and Bondi\nfor $\\Lambda=0$. We show that our definition reduces to some standard\ndefinitions in several situations. We establish a balance formula linking the\ncharacteristic mass and a suitably defined renormalised volume of the null\nhypersurface, generalising the positivity identity of one of us (PTC) and Paetz\nproved when $\\Lambda=0$.\n", "  When monoclinic monazite-type LaVO4 (space group P21/n) is squeezed up to 12\nGPa at room temperature, a phase transition to another monoclinic phase has\nbeen found. The structure of the high-pressure phase of LaVO4 is indexed with\nthe same space group (P21/n), but with a larger unit-cell in which the number\nof atoms is doubled. The transition leads to an 8% increase in the density of\nLaVO4. The occurrence of such a transition has been determined by x-ray\ndiffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations. The combination of\nthe three techniques allows us to also characterize accurately the pressure\nevolution of unit-cell parameters and the Raman (and IR)-active phonons of the\nlow- and high-pressure phase. In particular, room-temperature equations of\nstate have been determined. The changes driven by pressure in the crystal\nstructure induce sharp modifications in the color of LaVO4 crystals, suggesting\nthat behind the monoclinic-to-monoclinic transition there are important changes\nof the electronic properties of LaVO4.\n", "  Deep observations of galaxies reveal faint extended stellar components\n(hereafter ESCs) of streams, shells, and halos. These are a natural prediction\nof hierarchical galaxy formation, as accreted satellite galaxies are tidally\ndisrupted by their host. We investigate whether or not global properties of the\nESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be\nsensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying\ndark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the\nfavoured Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models ($m_{\\rm\nWDM}$=0.5,1,2 keV/$c^2$), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites,\nwe find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent\nacross models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure,\nas anticipated -- a factor of $\\sim$10 drop in spherically averaged mass\ndensity between $\\sim$10% and $\\sim$75% of the virial radius in the more\nextreme WDM runs ($m_{\\rm WDM}$=0.5, 1 keV/$c^2$) relative to the CDM run.\nThese differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the\ndifferent components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least\ndiscrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits\non $m_{\\rm WDM}$. Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the\nunderlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we\nexpect within a fixed dark matter model. This suggests that it will be\nchallenging to place limits on dark matter using only the unresolved spatial\nstructure of the the ESC.\n", "  A semiclassical quantization condition is derived for Landau levels in\ngeneral spin-orbit coupled systems. This generalizes the Onsager quantization\ncondition via a matrix-valued phase which describes spin dynamics along the\nclassical cyclotron trajectory. We discuss measurement of the matrix phase via\nmagnetic oscillations and electron spin resonance, which may be used to probe\nthe spin structure of the precessing wavefunction. We compare the resulting\nsemiclassical spectrum with exact results which are obtained for a variety of\nspin-orbit interactions in 2D systems.\n", "  The virial expansion for cold two-component Fermi and Bose atomic gases is\nconsidered in the presence of a waveguide and in the vicinity of a Feshbach\nresonance. The interaction between atoms and the coupling with the Feshbach\nmolecules is modeled using a quantitative separable two-channel model. The\nscattering phase-shift in an atomic waveguide is defined. This permits us to\nextend the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the second-order virial coefficient to\nthis inhomogeneous case.\n", "  We present a study of interstellar medium in the host galaxies of 9 QSOs at\n0.1<z<0.2 with blackhole masses of $3\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot$ to\n$3\\times10^9\\,M_\\odot$ based on the far-IR spectroscopy taken with {\\it\nHerschel Space Observatory}. We detect the [OI]63$\\mu$m ([CII]158$\\mu$m)\nemission in 6(8) out of 8(9) sources. Our QSO sample has far-infrared\nluminosities (LFIR)~several times $10^{11}L_\\odot$. The observed line-to-LFIR\nratios (LOI/LFIR and LCII/LFIR) are in the ranges of\n$2.6\\times10^{-4}$-$10^{-2}$ and $2.8\\times10^{-4}$-$2\\times10^{-3}$\nrespectively (including upper limits). These ratios are comparable to the\nvalues found in local ULIRGs, but higher than the average value published so\nfar for $z$$>$1 IR bright QSOs. One target, W0752+19, shows an additional broad\nvelocity component (~720 km/s), and exceptionally strong [OI]63$\\mu$m emission\nwith LOI/LFIR of $10^{-2}$, an order of magnitude higher than that of average\nvalue found among local (U)LIRGs. Combining with the analyses of the {\\it SDSS}\noptical spectra, we conclude that the [OI]63$\\mu$m emission in these QSOs is\nunlikely excited by shocks. We infer that the broad [OI]63 micron emission in\nW0752+19 could arise from the warm and dense ISM in the narrow line region of\nthe central AGN. Another possible explanation is the existence of a dense gas\noutflow with $n_{\\rm H}\\sim10^4$\\,cm$^{-3}$, where the corresponding broad\n[CII] emission is suppressed. Based on the far-IR [OI] and [CII] line ratios,\nwe estimate the constraints on the ISM density and UV radiation field intensity\nof $n_{\\rm H} \\lesssim 10^{3.3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $10^3<G_0 \\lesssim 10^{4.2}$,\nrespectively. These values are consistent with those found in local Seyfert 1\nULIRGs. In contrast, the gas with broad velocity width in W0752+19 has $n_{\\rm\nH} \\gtrsim 10^{4.3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $G_0>10^4$.\n", "  Recent supernova and transient surveys have revealed an increasing number of\nnon-terminal stellar eruptions. Though the progenitor class of these eruptions\nincludes the most luminous stars, little is known of the pre-supernova\nmechanics of massive stars in their most evolved state, thus motivating a\ncensus of possible progenitors. From surveys of evolved and unstable luminous\nstar populations in nearby galaxies, we select a sample of yellow and red\nsupergiant candidates in M31 and M33 for review of their spectral\ncharacteristics and spectral energy distributions. Since the position of\nintermediate and late-type supergiants on the color-magnitude diagram can be\nheavily contaminated by foreground dwarfs, we employ spectral classification\nand multi-band photometry from optical and near-infrared surveys to confirm\nmembership. Based on spectroscopic evidence for mass loss and the presence of\ncircumstellar dust in their SEDs, we find that $30-40\\%$ of the yellow\nsupergiants are likely in a post-red supergiant state. Comparison with\nevolutionary tracks shows that these mass-losing, post-RSGs have initial masses\nbetween $20-40\\,M_{\\odot}$. More than half of the observed red supergiants in\nM31 and M33 are producing dusty circumstellar ejecta. We also identify two new\nwarm hypergiants in M31, J004621.05+421308.06 and J004051.59+403303.00, both of\nwhich are likely in a post-RSG state.\n", "  We investigate the formation of icy super-Earth mass planets within a\ngravitationally unstable ring of solids orbiting at 250-750 AU around a 1 solar\nmass star. Coagulation calculations demonstrate that a system of a few large\noligarchs and a swarm of pebbles generates a super-Earth within 100-200 Myr at\n250 AU and within 1-2 Gyr at 750 AU. Systems with more than ten oligarchs fail\nto yield super-Earths over the age of the solar system. As these systems\nevolve, destructive collisions produce detectable debris disks with\nluminosities of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ relative to the central star.\n", "  We describe the first data release from the Spitzer-IRAC Equatorial Survey\n(SpIES); a large-area survey of 115 deg^2 in the Equatorial SDSS Stripe 82\nfield using Spitzer during its 'warm' mission phase. SpIES was designed to\nprobe sufficient volume to perform measurements of quasar clustering and the\nluminosity function at z > 3 to test various models for \"feedback\" from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). Additionally, the wide range of available\nmulti-wavelength, multi-epoch ancillary data enables SpIES to identify both\nhigh-redshift (z > 5) quasars as well as obscured quasars missed by optical\nsurveys. SpIES achieves 5{\\sigma} depths of 6.13 {\\mu}Jy (21.93 AB magnitude)\nand 5.75 {\\mu}Jy (22.0 AB magnitude) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively -\ndepths significantly fainter than WISE. We show that the SpIES survey recovers\na much larger fraction of spectroscopically-confirmed quasars (98%) in Stripe\n82 than are recovered by WISE (55%). This depth is especially powerful at\nhigh-redshift (z > 3.5), where SpIES recovers 94% of confirmed quasars, whereas\nWISE only recovers 25%. Here we define the SpIES survey parameters and describe\nthe image processing, source extraction, and catalog production methods used to\nanalyze the SpIES data. In addition to this survey paper, we release 234 images\ncreated by the SpIES team and three detection catalogs: a 3.6 {\\mu}m-only\ndetection catalog containing 6.1 million sources, a 4.5 {\\mu}m-only detection\ncatalog containing 6.5 million sources, and a dual-band detection catalog\ncontaining 5.4 million sources.\n", "  Most theoretical investigations of dust charging processes in space have\ntreated the current balance condition as independent of grain size. However,\nfor small grains, as they are often observed in space environments, a\ndependence on grain size is expected due to secondary electron emission (SEE).\nHere, by the term \"small\" we mean a particle size comparable to the typical\npenetration depth for given primary electron energy. The results are relevant\nfor the dynamics of small, charged dust particles emitted by the volcanic moon\nIo, which form the Jovian dust streams. We revise the theory of charging of\nsmall (sub-micron sized) micrometeoroids to take into account a high production\nof secondary electrons for small grains immersed in an isotropic flux of\nelectrons. We apply our model to obtain an improved estimate for the charge of\nthe dust streams leaving the Jovian system, detected by several spacecraft. For\nthe Jupiter plasma environment we derive the surface potential of grains\ncomposed of NaCl (believed to be the major constituent of Jovian dust stream\nparticles) or silicates. For small particles the potential depends on grain\nsize and the secondary electron current induces a sensitivity to material\nproperties. As a result of the small particle effect, the estimates for the\ncharging times and for the fractional charge fluctuations of NaCl grains\nobtained using our general approach to SEE give results qualitatively different\nfrom the analogous estimates derived from the traditional approach to SEE. We\nfind that for the charging environment considered in this paper field emission\ndoes not limit the charging of NaCl grains.\n", "  Unaccounted for systematics from foregrounds and instruments can severely\nlimit the sensitivity of current experiments from detecting redshifted 21~cm\nsignals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Upcoming experiments are faced\nwith a challenge to deliver more collecting area per antenna element without\ndegrading the data with systematics. This paper and its companions show that\ndishes are viable for achieving this balance using the Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array (HERA) as an example. Here, we specifically identify\nspectral systematics associated with the antenna power pattern as a significant\ndetriment to all EoR experiments which causes the already bright foreground\npower to leak well beyond ideal limits and contaminate the otherwise clean EoR\nsignal modes. A primary source of this chromaticity is reflections in the\nantenna-feed assembly and between structures in neighboring antennas. Using\nprecise foreground simulations taking wide-field effects into account, we\nprovide a framework to set cosmologically-motivated design specifications on\nthese reflections to prevent further EoR signal degradation. We show HERA will\nnot be impeded by such spectral systematics and demonstrate that even in a\nconservative scenario that does not perform removal of foregrounds, HERA will\ndetect EoR signal in line-of-sight $k$-modes, $k_\\parallel \\gtrsim\n0.2\\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$, with high significance. All baselines in a 19-element HERA\nlayout are capable of detecting EoR over a substantial observing window on the\nsky.\n", "  The orthorhombic perovskite SrIrO3 is a semimetal, an intriguing exception in\niridates where the strong spin-orbit interaction coupled with electron\ncorrelations tends to impose a novel insulating state. We report results of our\ninvestigation of bulk single-crystal Sr0.94Ir0.78O2.68 or Ir-deficient,\northorhombic perovskite SrIrO3. It retains the same crystal structure as\nstoichiometric SrIrO3 but exhibits a sharp, simultaneous antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) and metal-insulator (MI) transition at 185 K. Above it, the basal-plane\nresistivity features an extended regime of almost linear-temperature dependence\nup to 800 K but the strong electronic anisotropy renders an insulating behavior\nin the out-of-plane resistivity. The Hall resistivity undergoes an abrupt sign\nchange and grows below 40 K, which along with the Sommerfeld constant of 20\nmJ/mole K2 suggests a multiband effect. All results including our\nfirst-principles calculations underscore a delicacy of the metallic state in\nSrIrO3 that is in close proximity to an AFM insulating state. The contrasting\nground states in isostructural Sr0.94Ir0.78O2.68 and SrIrO3 illustrate a\ncritical role of even slight lattice distortions in rebalancing the ground\nstate in the iridates. Finally, the observed simultaneous AFM and MI\ntransitions reveal a direct correlation between the magnetic transition and\nformation of a charge gap in the iridate, which is conspicuously absent in\nSr2IrO4.\n", "  Motivated by sine-square deformation (SSD) for quantum critical systems in\n1+1-dimension, we discuss a Mobius quantization approach to the two-dimensional\nconformal field theory (CFT), which bridges the conventional radial\nquantization and the dipolar quantization recently proposed by Ishibashi and\nTada. We then find that the continuous Virasoro algebra of the dipolar\nquantization can be interpreted as a continuum limit of the Virasoro algebra\nfor scaled generators in the SSD limit of the Mobius quantization approach.\n", "  We show that the inflaton coupling to all other fields is exponentially\nsuppressed during inflation in the cosmological $\\alpha$-attractor models. In\nthe context of supergravity, this feature is a consequence of the underlying\nhyperbolic geometry of the moduli space which has a flat direction\ncorresponding to the inflaton field. A combination of these factors protects\nthe asymptotic flatness of the inflaton potential.\n", "  There has been considerable interest in applying the gauge/gravity duality to\ncondensed matter theories with particular attention being devoted to gravity\nduals (Lifshitz spacetimes) of theories that exhibit anisotropic scaling. In\nthis context, black hole solutions with Lifshitz asymptotics have also been\nconstructed aiming at incorporating finite temperature effects. The goal here\nis to look at quantum polarization effects in these spacetimes, and to this\naim, we develop a way to compute the coincidence limit of the Green's function\nfor massive, non-minimally coupled scalar fields, adapting to the present\nsituation the analysis developed for the case of asymptotically anti de Sitter\nblack holes. The basics are similar to previous calculations, however in the\nLifshitz case one needs to extend previous results to include a more general\nform for the metric and dependence on the dynamical exponent. All formulae are\nshown to reduce to the AdS case studied before once the value of the dynamical\nexponent is set to unity and the metric functions are accordingly chosen. The\nanalytical results we present are general and can be applied to a variety of\ncases, in fact, to all spherically symmetric Lifshitz black hole solutions. We\nalso implement the numerical analysis choosing some known Lifshitz black hole\nsolutions as illustration.\n", "  We measure the $D^0 - {\\bar{D}}^0$ mixing parameters using a time-dependent\namplitude analysis of the decay $D^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$. The data were recorded\nwith the BABAR detector at center-of-mass energies at and near the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of\napproximately 468.1 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$. The neutral $D$ meson candidates are\nselected from $D^{*}(2010)^+\\to D^0 \\pi_s^+$ decays where the flavor at the\nproduction is identified by the charge of the low momentum pion, $\\pi_s^+$. The\nmeasured mixing parameters are $x = (1.5\\pm1.2\\pm0.6) \\%$ and $y =\n(0.2\\pm0.9\\pm0.5) \\%$, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical and\nsystematic, respectively.\n", "  Magnetic fields have a crucial role in physics at all scales, from\nastrophysics to nanoscale phenomena. Large fields, constant or pulsed, allow\ninvestigation of material in extreme conditions, opening up plethora of\npractical applications based on ultra-fast process, and studying phenomena\nexisting only in exotic astro-objects like neutron stars or pulsars. Magnetic\nfields are indispensable in particle accelerators, for guiding the relativistic\nparticles along a curved trajectory and for making them radiate in synchrotron\nlight sources and in free electron lasers. In the presented paper we propose a\nnovel and effective method for generating solenoidal quasi-static magnetic\nfield on the GigaGauss level and beyond, in under-dense plasma, using\nscrew-shaped high intensity laser pulses. In comparison with already known\ntechniques which typically rely on interaction with over-dense or solid\ntargets, where radial or toroidal magnetic field localized at the stationary\ntarget were generated, our method allows to produce gigantic solenoidal fields,\nwhich is co-moving with the driving laser pulse and collinear with accelerated\nelectrons. The solenoidal field is quasi-stationary in the reference frame of\nthe laser pulse and can be used for guiding electron beams and providing\nsynchrotron radiation beam emittance cooling for laser-plasma accelerated\nelectron and positron beams, opening up novel opportunities for designs of the\nlight sources, free electron lasers, and high energy colliders based on laser\nplasma acceleration.\n", "  The VISTA Variables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea (VVV) is a near-IR time-domain\nsurvey of the Galactic bulge and southern plane. One of the main goals of this\nsurvey is to reveal the 3D structure of the Milky Way through their variable\nstars. Particularly the RR Lyrae stars have been massively discovered in the\ninner regions of the bulge ($-8^\\circ \\lesssim b \\lesssim -1^\\circ$) by optical\nsurveys such as OGLE and MACHO but leaving an unexplored window of more than\n$\\sim 47$ sq deg ($-10.0^\\circ \\lesssim \\ell \\lesssim +10.7^\\circ$ and\n$-10.3^\\circ \\lesssim b \\lesssim -8.0^\\circ$) observed by the VVV Survey. Our\ngoal is to characterize the RR Lyrae stars in the outer bulge in terms of their\nperiods, amplitudes, Fourier coefficients, and distances, in order to evaluate\nthe 3D structure of the bulge in this area. The distance distribution of RR\nLyrae stars will be compared to the one of red clump stars that is known to\ntrace a X-shaped structure in order to determine if these two different stellar\npopulations share the same Galactic distribution. We report the detection of\nmore than 1000 RR Lyrae ab-type stars in the VVV Survey located in the\noutskirts of the Galactic bulge. Some of them are possibly associated with the\nSagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. We calculated colors, reddening,\nextinction, and distances of the detected RR Lyrae stars in order to determine\nthe outer bulge 3D structure. Our main result is that, at the low galactic\nlatitudes mapped here, the RR Lyrae stars trace a centrally concentrated\nspheroidal distribution. This is a noticeably different spatial distribution to\nthe one traced by red clump stars known to follow a bar and X-shape structure.\nWe estimate the completeness of our RRab sample in $80\\%$ for $K_{\\rm\ns}\\lesssim15$ mag.\n", "  We present a broadband polarization analysis of 36 discrete polarized radio\nsources over a very broad, densely-sampled frequency band. Our sample was\nselected on the basis of polarization behaviour apparent in narrowband archival\ndata at 1.4 GHz: half the sample show complicated frequency-dependent\npolarization behaviour (i.e. Faraday complexity) at these frequencies, while\nhalf show comparatively simple behaviour (i.e. they appear Faraday simple). We\nre-observed the sample using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in\nfull polarization, with 6 GHz of densely sampled frequency coverage spanning\n1.3 to 10 GHz. We have devised a general polarization modelling technique that\nallows us to identify multiple polarized emission components in a source, and\nto characterize their properties. We detect Faraday complex behaviour in almost\nevery source in our sample. Several sources exhibit particularly remarkable\npolarization behaviour. By comparing our new and archival data, we have\nidentified temporal variability in the broadband integrated polarization\nspectra of some sources. In a number of cases, the characteristics of the\npolarized emission components, including the range of Faraday depths over which\nthey emit, their temporal variability, spectral index, and the linear extent of\nthe source, allow us to argue that the spectropolarimetric data encodes\ninformation about the magnetoionic environment of active galactic nuclei\nthemselves. Furthermore, the data place direct constraints on the geometry and\nmagnetoionic structure of this material. We discuss the consequences of\nrestricted frequency bands on the detection and interpretation of polarization\nstructures, and implications for upcoming spectropolarimetric surveys.\n", "  We compute the connected four point correlation function (the trispectrum in\nFourier space) of cosmological density perturbations at one-loop order in\nStandard Perturbation Theory (SPT) and the Effective Field Theory of Large\nScale Structure (EFT of LSS). This paper is a companion to our earlier work on\nthe non-Gaussian covariance of the matter power spectrum, which corresponds to\na particular wavenumber configuration of the trispectrum. In the present\ncalculation, we highlight and clarify some of the subtle aspects of the EFT\nframework that arise at third order in perturbation theory for general\nwavenumber configurations of the trispectrum. We consistently incorporate\nvorticity and non-locality in time into the EFT counterterms and lay out a\ncomplete basis of building blocks for the stress tensor. We show predictions\nfor the one-loop SPT trispectrum and the EFT contributions, focusing on\nconfigurations which have particular relevance for using LSS to constrain\nprimordial non-Gaussianity.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the construction and analysis of boson stars in\nthe context of nonminimal derivative coupling theories. In particular we embed\nour model in the biscalar extension of Horndeski gravity, considering a scalar\nfield theory displaying a nonminimally coupled kinetic term given by the\nEinstein tensor. We focus on the case where the potential is given by a mass\nterm only, and when a six order self-interaction is included. In the latter\ncase we consider specific couplings in the self-interacting terms in such a way\nthat our self-interaction is given by a positive definite potential presenting\ntwo degenerate local vacua. We show how solutions can be obtained and we\ncompare its principal properties with standard configurations constructed with\nthe usual minimally coupled kinetic term.\n", "  We present new theoretical stellar yields and surface abundances for three\ngrids of metal-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. Post-processing\nnucleosynthesis results are presented for stellar models with initial masses\nbetween 1$M_{\\odot}$ and 7.5$M_{\\odot}$ for $Z=0.007$, and 1$M_{\\odot}$ and\n8$M_{\\odot}$ for $Z=0.014$ (solar) and $Z=0.03$. We include stellar surface\nabundances as a function of thermal pulse on the AGB for elements from C to Bi\nand for a selection of isotopic ratios for elements up to Fe and Ni (e.g.,\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C), which can be obtained from observations of molecules in\nstars and from the laboratory analysis of meteoritic stardust grains. Ratios of\nelemental abundances of He/H, C/O, and N/O are also included, which are useful\nfor direct comparison to observations of AGB stars and their progeny including\nplanetary nebulae. The integrated elemental stellar yields are presented for\neach model in the grid for hydrogen, helium and all stable elements from C to\nBi. Yields of Li are also included for intermediate-mass models with hot bottom\nburning. We present the first $slow$ neutron-capture ($s$-process) yields for\nsuper-solar metallicity AGB stars with $Z=0.03$, and the first complete\n$s$-process yields for models more massive than 6$M_{\\odot}$ at all three\nmetallicities.\n", "  The $D^4\\mathcal{R}^4$ and $D^6\\mathcal{R}^4$ coefficient functions in the\neffective action of type II string theory compactified on $T^d$ contain terms\nof the form $\\mathcal{E}_1 {\\rm ln}g_d$ and $\\mathcal{E}_2 ({\\rm ln}g_d)^2$ in\nspecific dimensions, where $g_d$ is the T--duality invariant string coupling,\nand $\\mathcal{E}_1$ and $\\mathcal{E}_2$ are U--duality invariant coefficient\nfunctions. We derive these non--analytic terms from nested ultraviolet\ndivergences in two and three loop maximal supergravity. For the\n$D^4\\mathcal{R}^4$ coupling, the contribution involves\n$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{R}^4} {\\rm ln} g_d$, while for the $D^6\\mathcal{R}^4$\ncoupling, it involves $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{R}^4} {\\rm ln} g_d$,\n$\\mathcal{E}_{D^2\\mathcal{R}^4} ({\\rm ln} g_d)^2$ and\n$\\mathcal{E}_{D^4\\mathcal{R}^4} {\\rm ln} g_d$; where\n$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{R}^4}$, $\\mathcal{E}_{D^2\\mathcal{R}^4}$ and\n$\\mathcal{E}_{D^4\\mathcal{R}^4}$ are the $\\mathcal{R}^4$, $D^2\\mathcal{R}^4$\nand $D^4\\mathcal{R}^4$ coefficient functions respectively. The contribution\nfrom $\\mathcal{E}_{D^2\\mathcal{R}^4}$, the coefficient function of an amplitude\nthat vanishes onshell, arises from a two loop nested subdivergence of the three\nloop amplitude.\n", "  By analyzing two Kinetically Constrained Models of supercooled liquids we\nshow that the anomalous transport of a driven tracer observed in supercooled\nliquids is another facet of the phenomenon of dynamical heterogeneity. We focus\non the Fredrickson-Andersen and the Bertin-Bouchaud-Lequeux models. By\nnumerical simulations and analytical arguments we demonstrate that the\nviolation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and the observed field-induced\nsuperdiffusion have the same physical origin: while a fraction of probes do not\nmove, others jump repeatedly because they are close to local mobile regions.\nThe anomalous fluctuations observed out of equilibrium in presence of a pulling\nforce $\\epsilon$, $\\sigma_x^2(t) = \\langle x_\\epsilon^2(t) \\rangle - \\langle\nx_\\epsilon(t) \\rangle^2 \\sim t^{3/2}$, which are accompanied by the asymptotic\ndecay $\\alpha_\\epsilon(t)\\sim t^{-1/2}$ of the non-Gaussian parameter from\nnon-trivial values to zero, are due to the splitting of the probes population\nin the two (mobile and immobile) groups and to dynamical correlations, a\nmechanism expected to happen generically in supercooled liquids.\n", "  The Muttalib-Borodin biorthogonal ensemble is a joint density function for\n$n$ particles on the positive real line that depends on a parameter $\\theta$.\nThere is an equilibrium problem that describes the large $n$ behavior. We show\nthat for rational values of $\\theta$ there is an equivalent vector equilibrium\nproblem.\n", "  The origin of Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of only a few days is\nstill uncertain. It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current\nsample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot\nJupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior\nJupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.\nThis result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the\napproximate location of the water-ice line. These results are difficult to\nreconcile with the high-eccentricity migration scenario for hot Jupiter\nformation.\n", "  We discuss the neutrino mass matrix based on the Occam's Razor approach in\nthe framework of the seesaw mechanism. We impose four zeros in the Dirac\nneutrino mass matrix, which give the minimum number of parameters needed for\nthe observed neutrino masses and lepton mixing angles, while the charged lepton\nmass matrix and the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix are taken to be\nreal diagonal ones. The low-energy neutrino mass matrix has only seven physical\nparameters. We show successful predictions for the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$\nand the CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$ with the normal mass hierarchy of\nneutrinos by using the experimental data on the neutrino mass squared\ndifferences, the mixing angles $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\theta_{23}$. The most\nfavored region of $\\sin\\theta_{13}$ is around $0.13\\sim 0.15$, which is\ncompletely consistent with the observed value. The CP violating phase\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is favored to be close to $\\pm \\pi/2$. We also discuss the\nMajorana phases as well as the effective neutrino mass for the neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay $m_{ee}$, which is around $7\\sim 8$ meV. It is extremely\nremarkable that we can perform a \"complete experiment\" to determine the\nlow-energy neutrino mass matrix, since we have only seven physical parameters\nin the neutrino mass matrix. In particular, two CP violating phases in the\nneutrino mass matrix are directly given by two CP violating phases at high\nenergy. Thus, assuming the leptogenesis we can determine the sign of the cosmic\nbaryon in the universe from the low-energy experiments for the neutrino mass\nmatrix.\n", "  We present a detailed, multi-wavelength study of star formation (SF) and AGN\nactivity in 11 near-infrared (IR) selected, spectroscopically confirmed,\nmassive ($\\gtrsim10^{14}\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) galaxy clusters at $1<z<1.75$. Using\nnew, deep $Herschel$/PACS imaging, we characterize the optical to far-IR\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) for IR-luminous cluster galaxies, finding\nthat they can, on average, be well described by field galaxy templates.\nIdentification and decomposition of AGN through SED fittings allows us to\ninclude the contribution to cluster SF from AGN host galaxies. We quantify the\nstar-forming fraction, dust-obscured SF rates (SFRs), and specific-SFRs for\ncluster galaxies as a function of cluster-centric radius and redshift. In good\nagreement with previous studies, we find that SF in cluster galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim1.4$ is largely consistent with field galaxies at similar epochs,\nindicating an era before significant quenching in the cluster cores\n($r<0.5\\,$Mpc). This is followed by a transition to lower SF activity as\nenvironmental quenching dominates by $z\\sim1$. Enhanced SFRs are found in lower\nmass ($10.1< \\log \\rm{M_{\\star}}/\\rm{M_{\\odot}}<10.8$) cluster galaxies. We\nfind significant variation in SF from cluster-to-cluster within our uniformly\nselected sample, indicating that caution should be taken when evaluating\nindividual clusters. We examine AGN in clusters from $z=0.5-2$, finding an\nexcess AGN fraction at $z\\gtrsim1$, suggesting environmental triggering of AGN\nduring this epoch. We argue that our results $-$ a transition from field-like\nto quenched SF, enhanced SF in lower mass galaxies in the cluster cores, and\nexcess AGN $-$ are consistent with a co-evolution between SF and AGN in\nclusters and an increased merger rate in massive haloes at high redshift.\n", "  Inspired by the recent experimental signatures of relativistic hydrodynamics\nin graphene, we investigate theoretically the behavior of hydrodynamic sound\nmodes in such quasi-relativistic fluids near charge neutrality, within linear\nresponse. Locally driving an electron fluid at a resonant frequency to such a\nsound mode can lead to large increases in the electrical response at the edges\nof the sample, a signature which cannot be explained using diffusive models of\ntransport. We discuss the robustness of this signal to various effects,\nincluding electron-acoustic phonon coupling, disorder, and long-range Coulomb\ninteractions. These long range interactions convert the sound mode into a\ncollective plasmonic mode at low frequencies unless the fluid is charge\nneutral. At the smallest frequencies, the response in a disordered fluid is\nquantitatively what is predicted by a \"momentum relaxation time\" approximation.\nHowever, this approximation fails at higher frequencies (which can be\nparametrically small), where the classical localization of sound waves cannot\nbe neglected. Experimental observation of such resonances is a clear signature\nof relativistic hydrodynamics, and provides an upper bound on the viscosity of\nthe electron-hole plasma.\n", "  Torsional Alfv{\\'e}n waves propagating in the Earth's core have been inferred\nby inversion techniques applied to geomagnetic models. They appear to propagate\nacross the core but vanish at the equator, exchanging angular momentum between\ncore and mantle. Assuming axial symmetry, we find that an electrically\nconducting layer at the bottom of the mantle can lead to total absorption of\ntorsional waves that reach the equator. We show that the reflection coefficient\ndepends on G Br , where Br is the strength of the radial magnetic field at the\nequator, and G the conductance of the lower mantle there. With Br = 7e-4 T.,\ntorsional waves are completely absorbed when they hit the equator if G = 1.3e8\nS. For larger or smaller G, reflection occurs. As G is increased above this\ncritical value, there is less attenuation and more angular momentum exchange.\nOur finding dissociates efficient core-mantle coupling from strong ohmic\ndissipation in the mantle.\n", "  We use finite size scaling to study Ising spin glasses in two spatial\ndimensions. The issue of universality is addressed by comparing discrete and\ncontinuous probability distributions for the quenched random couplings. The\nsophisticated temperature dependency of the scaling fields is identified as the\nmajor obstacle that has impeded a complete analysis. Once temperature is\nrelinquished in favor of the correlation length as the basic variable, we\nobtain a reliable estimation of the anomalous dimension and of the thermal\ncritical exponent. Universality among binary and Gaussian couplings is\nconfirmed to a high numerical accuracy.\n", "  Nantais et al. used the Hubble Space Telescope to localize probable globular\nclusters (GCs) in M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.63 Mpc. Theory\npredicts that GCs can host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses\nM_BH \\sim 100 - 100,000 M_sun. Finding IMBHs in GCs could validate a formation\nchannel for seed BHs in the early universe, bolster gravitational-wave\npredictions for space missions, and test scaling relations between stellar\nsystems and the central BHs they host. We used the NRAO Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array (VLA) to search for the radiative signatures of IMBH accretion from\n206 probable GCs in a mosaic of M81. The observing wavelength was 5.5 cm and\nthe spatial resolution was 1.5 arcsec (26.4 pc). None of the individual GCs are\ndetected, nor are weighted-mean image stacks of the 206 GCs and the 49 massive\nGCs with stellar masses M_star \\gtrsim 200,000 M_sun. We apply a semi-empirical\nmodel to predict the mass of an IMBH that, if undergoing accretion in the\nlong-lived hard X-ray state, is consistent with a given radio luminosity. The\n3$\\sigma$ radio-luminosity upper limits correspond to mean IMBH masses of\nM_BH(all) < 42,000 M_sun for the all-cluster stack and M_BH(massive) < 51,000\nM_sun for the massive-cluster stack. We also apply the empirical\nfundamental-plane relation to two X-ray-detected clusters, finding that their\nindividual IMBH masses at 95% confidence are M_BH < 99,000 M_sun and M_BH <\n15,000 M_sun. Finally, no analog of HLX-1, a strong IMBH candidate in an\nextragalactic star cluster, occurs in any individual GC in M81. This\nunderscores the uniqueness or rarity of the HLX-1 phenomenon.\n", "  We present the first numerical study of the full dynamics of a braneworld\nscenario, working within the framework of the single brane model of Randall and\nSundrum (RSII). In particular, we study the process of gravitational collapse\ndriven by a massless scalar field which is confined to the brane. Imposing\nspherical symmetry on the brane, we show that the evolutions of sufficiently\nstrong initial configurations of the scalar field result in black holes that\nhave finite extension into the bulk. Furthermore, we find preliminary evidence\nthat the black holes generated form a unique sequence, irrespective of the\ndetails of the initial data. The black hole solutions we obtain from dynamical\nevolutions are consistent with those previously computed from a static vacuum\nansatz.\n", "  The complexity and cost of building and running high-power electrical systems\nmake the use of simulations unavoidable. The simulations available today\nprovide great understanding about how systems really operate. This paper helps\nthe reader to gain an insight into simulation in the field of power converters\nfor particle accelerators. Starting with the definition and basic principles of\nsimulation, two simulation types, as well as their leading tools, are\npresented: analog and numerical simulations. Some practical applications of\neach simulation type are also considered. The final conclusion then summarizes\nthe main important items to keep in mind before opting for a simulation tool or\nbefore performing a simulation.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often accompanied by coronal dimming\nevident in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray observations. The locations\nof dimming are sometimes considered to map footpoints of the erupting flux\nrope. As the emitting material expands in the corona, the decreased plasma\ndensity leads to reduced emission observed in spectral and irradiance\nmeasurements. Therefore, signatures of dimming may reflect properties of CMEs\nin the early phase of its eruption. In this study, we analyze the event of\nflare, CME, and coronal dimming on December 26, 2011. We use the data from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on Solar Dynamics Observatories (SDO) for\ndisk observations of the dimming, and analyze images taken by EUVI, COR1, and\nCOR2 onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories to obtain the height\nand velocity of the associated CMEs observed at the limb. We also measure\nmagnetic reconnection rate from flare observations. Dimming occurs in a few\nlocations next to the flare ribbons, and it is observed in multiple EUV\npassbands. Rapid dimming starts after the onset of fast reconnection and CME\nacceleration, and its evolution well tracks the CME height and flare\nreconnection. The spatial distribution of dimming exhibits cores of deep\ndimming with a rapid growth, and their light curves are approximately linearly\nscaled with the CME height profile. From the dimming analysis, we infer the\nprocess of the CME expansion, and estimate properties of the CME.\n", "  We studied the variations of line-of-sight photospheric plasma flows during\nthe formation phase of the penumbra around a pore in Active Region NOAA 11490.\nWe used a high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution data set acquired by\nthe Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) operating at the NSO/Dunn\nSolar Telescope as well as data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite (SDO/HMI). Before the penumbra\nformed we observed a redshift of the spectral line in the inner part of the\nannular zone surrounding the pore as well as a blueshift of material associated\nwith opposite magnetic polarity further away from the pore. We found that the\nonset of the classical Evershed flow occurs in a very short time scale -- 1-3\nhours -- while the penumbra is forming. During the same time interval we found\nchanges in the magnetic field inclination in the penumbra, with the vertical\nfield actually changing sign near the penumbral edge, while the total magnetic\nfield showed a significant increase, about 400 G. To explain these and other\nobservations related to the formation of the penumbra and the onset of the\nEvershed flow we propose a scenario in which the penumbra is formed by magnetic\nflux dragged down from the canopy surrounding the initial pore. The Evershed\nflow starts when the sinking magnetic field dips below the solar surface and\nmagnetoconvection sets in.\n", "  We report trigonometric parallaxes for 134 low mass stars and brown dwarfs,\nof which 38 have no previously published measurement and 79 more have improved\nuncertainties. Our survey targeted nearby targets, so 119 are closer than 30\npc. Of the 38 stars with new parallaxes, 14 are within 20 pc and seven are\nlikely brown dwarfs (spectral types later than L0). These parallaxes are useful\nfor studies of kinematics, multiplicity, and spectrophotometric calibration.\nTwo objects with new parallaxes are confirmed as young stars with membership in\nnearby young moving groups: LP 870-65 in AB Doradus and G 161-71 in Argus. We\nalso report the first parallax for the planet-hosting star GJ 3470; this allows\nus to refine the density of its Neptune-mass planet. One T-dwarf, 2MASS\nJ12590470-4336243, previously thought to lie within 4 pc, is found to be at 7.8\npc, and the M-type star 2MASS J01392170-3936088 joins the ranks of nearby stars\nas it is found to be within 10 pc. Five stars that are over-luminous and/or too\nred for their spectral types are identified and deserve further study as\npossible young stars.\n", "  We develop a detailed chemical network relevant to the conditions\ncharacteristic of prestellar core collapse. We solve the system of\ntime-dependent differential equations to calculate the equilibrium abundances\nof molecules and dust grains, with a size distribution given by size-bins for\nthese latter. These abundances are used to compute the different non-ideal\nmagneto-hydrodynamics resistivities (ambipolar, Ohmic and Hall), needed to\ncarry out simulations of protostellar collapse. For the first time in this\ncontext, we take into account the evaporation of the grains, the thermal\nionisation of Potassium, Sodium and Hydrogen at high temperature, and the\nthermionic emission of grains in the chemical network, and we explore the\nimpact of various cosmic ray ionisation rates. All these processes\nsignificantly affect the non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics resistivities, which\nwill modify the dynamics of the collapse. Ambipolar diffusion and Hall effect\ndominate at low densities, up to n_H = 10^12 cm^-3, after which Ohmic diffusion\ntakes over. We find that the time-scale needed to reach chemical equilibrium is\nalways shorter than the typical dynamical (free fall) one. This allows us to\nbuild a large, multi-dimensional multi-species equilibrium abundance table over\na large temperature, density and ionisation rate ranges. This table, which we\nmake accessible to the community, is used during first and second prestellar\ncore collapse calculations to compute the non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics\nresistivities, yielding a consistent dynamical-chemical description of this\nprocess.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of high-order primordial\nperturbations with nonlinear dispersion relations due to quantum gravitational\neffects in the framework of {\\em uniform asymptotic approximations}. Because of\nthese effects, the equation of motion of the mode function in general has\nmultiple-turning points. After obtaining analytically approximated solutions to\nany order in different regions, associated with different types of turning\npoints, we match them to the third one. To this order the errors are less than\n$0.15\\%$. General expressions of the power spectra of the primordial tensor and\nscalar perturbations are derived explicitly. We also investigate effects of\nback-reactions of the quantum gravitational corrections, and make sure that\ninflation lasts long enough in order to solve the underlying problems, such as\nflatness, horizon and monopole. Then, we study various features of the spectra\nthat are observationally relevant. In particular, under a moderate assumption\nabout the energy scale of the underlying theory of quantum gravity, we have\nshown that the quantum gravitational effects may alter significantly the ratio\nbetween the tensor and scalar power spectra, thereby providing a natural\nmechanism to alleviate the tension between observations and certain\ninflationary models, including the one with a quadratic potential.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) distribution of the volume-density molecular fraction,\ndefined by fmol_rho=rho_H2/(rho_HI + rho_H2), is studied in the Milky Way\nGalaxy. The molecular front appears at galacto-centric distance of R \\sim 8\nkpc, where the phase transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs\nsuddenly with fmol_rho dropping from \\sim 0.8 to 0.2 within a radial interval\nas narrow as \\sim 0.5 kpc. The front in fmol_rho is much sharper than that for\nsurface density molecular fraction. The front also appears in the vertical\ndirection with a full width of the high-fmol_rho disk to be \\sim 100 pc. The\nradial and vertical fmol_rho profiles, particularly the front behaviors, are\nfitted by theoretical curves calculated using the observed density profile and\nassumed radiation field and metallicity with exponential gradients. The\nmolecular fraction was found to be enhanced along the Perseus and some other\nspiral arms. The fmol_rho arms imply that the molecular clouds are produced\nfrom HI gas in the spiral arms and are dissociated in the interarm region. We\nalso show that there is a threshold HI density over which the gas is\ntransformed into molecules.\n", "  We present a semi-automatic procedure to obtain fundamental physical\nparameters and distances of classical Be (CBe) stars, based on the\nBarbier-Chalonge-Divan (BCD) spectrophotometric system. Our aim is to apply\nthis procedure to a large sample of CBe stars detected by the IPHAS photometric\nsurvey, to determine their fundamental physical parameters and to explore their\nsuitability as galactic structure tracers. In this paper we describe the\nmethodology used and the validation of the procedure by comparing our results\nwith those obtained from different independent astrophysical techniques for\nsubsamples of stars in common with other studies. We also present a test case\nstudy of the galactic structure in the direction of the Perseus Galactic Arm,\nin order to compare our results with others recently obtained with different\ntechniques and the same sample of stars. We did not find any significant\nclustering of stars at the expected positions of the Perseus and Outer Galactic\nArms, in agreement with previous studies in the same area that we used for\nverification.\n", "  Atomic nanowires on semiconductor surfaces induced by the adsorption of\nmetallic atoms have attracted a lot of attention as possible hosts of the\nelusive, Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The Au/Ge(100) system in particular is the\nsubject of controversy as to whether the Au-induced nanowires do indeed host\nexotic, 1D metallic states. We report on a thorough study of the electronic\nproperties of high quality nanowires formed at the Au/Ge(100) surface. High\nresolution ARPES data show the low-lying Au-induced electronic states to\npossess a dispersion relation that depends on two orthogonal directions in\nk-space. Comparison of the E(k$_x$,k$_y$) surface measured using ARPES to\ntight-binding calculations yields hopping parameters in the two different\ndirections that differ by a factor of two. We find that the larger of the two\nhopping parameters corresponds, in fact, to the direction perpendicular to the\nnanowires (t$_{\\perp}$). This, the topology of the $E$=$E_F$ contour in\nk$_{\\||}$, and the fact that $t_{\\||}$/$t_{\\perp}\\sim 0.5$ proves that the\nAu-induced electron pockets possess a 2D, closed Fermi surface, this firmly\nplaces the Au/Ge(100) nanowire system outside being a potential hosts of a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We combine these ARPES data with STS measurements of\nthe spatially-resolved electronic structure and find that the spatially\nstraight conduction channels observed up to energies of order one electron volt\nbelow the Fermi level do not originate from the Au-induced states seen in the\nARPES data. The former are more likely to be associated with bulk Ge states\nthat are localized to the subsurface region. Despite our proof of the 2D nature\nof the Au-induced nanowire and sub-surface Ge-related states, an anomalous\nsuppression of the density of states at the Fermi level is observed in both the\nSTS and ARPES data, this phenomenon is discussed in the light of the effects of\ndisorder.\n", "  I examine the standard model of planet formation, including pebble accretion,\nusing numerical simulations. Planetary embryos large enough to become giant\nplanets do not form beyond the ice line within a typical disk lifetime unless\nicy pebbles stick at higher speeds than in experiments using rocky pebbles.\nSystems like the Solar System (small inner planets, giant outer planets) can\nform if (i) icy pebbles are stickier than rocky pebbles, and (ii) the\nplanetesimal formation efficiency increases with pebble size, which prevents\nthe formation of massive terrestrial planets. Growth beyond the ice line is\ndominated by pebble accretion. Most growth occurs early, when the surface\ndensity of pebbles is high due to inward drift of pebbles from the outer disk.\nGrowth is much slower after the outer disk is depleted. The outcome is\nsensitive to the disk radius and turbulence level, which control the lifetime\nand maximum size of pebbles. The outcome is sensitive to the size of the\nlargest planetesimals since there is a threshold mass for the onset of pebble\naccretion. The planetesimal formation rate is unimportant provided that some\nlarge planetesimals form while pebbles remain abundant. Two outcomes are seen,\ndepending on whether pebble accretion begins while pebbles are still abundant.\nEither (i) multiple gas giant planets form beyond the ice line, small planets\nform close to the star, and a Kuiper-belt-like disk of bodies is scattered\noutwards by the giant planets; or (ii) no giants form and bodies remain\nEarth-mass or smaller.\n", "  We present measurements of the evolution of normal-galaxy X-ray emission from\n$z \\approx$ 0-7 using local galaxies and galaxy samples in the 6 Ms Chandra\nDeep Field-South (CDF-S) survey. The majority of the CDF-S galaxies are\nobserved at rest-frame energies above 2 keV, where the emission is expected to\nbe dominated by X-ray binary (XRB) populations; however, hot gas is expected to\nprovide small contributions to the observed- frame < 1 keV emission at $z < 1$.\nWe show that a single scaling relation between X-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm X}$)\nand star-formation rate (SFR) is insufficient for characterizing the average\nX-ray emission at all redshifts. We establish that scaling relations involving\nnot only SFR, but also stellar mass ($M_\\star$) and redshift, provide\nsignificantly improved characterizations of the average X-ray emission from\nnormal galaxy populations at $z \\approx$ 0-7. We further provide the first\nempirical constraints on the redshift evolution of X-ray emission from both\nlow-mass XRB (LMXB) and high-mass XRB (HMXB) populations and their scalings\nwith $M_\\star$ and SFR, respectively. We find $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}({\\rm\nLMXB})/M_\\star \\propto (1 + z)^{2-3}$ and $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}({\\rm HMXB})$/SFR\n$\\propto (1 + z)$, and show that these relations are consistent with XRB\npopulation-synthesis model predictions, which attribute the increase in LMXB\nand HMXB scaling relations with redshift as being due to declining host galaxy\nstellar ages and metallicities, respectively. We discuss how emission from XRBs\ncould provide an important source of heating to the intergalactic medium in the\nearly Universe, exceeding that of active galactic nuclei.\n", "  Recently, the discovery of a Venus-mass planet orbiting a brown-dwarf host in\na binary system was reported from the analysis of the microlensing event\nOGLE-2013-BLG-0723. We reanalyze the event considering the possibility of other\ninterpretations. From this, we find a new solution where the lens is composed\nof 2 bodies in contrast to the 3-body solution of the previous analysis. The\nnew solution better explains the observed light curve than the previous\nsolution with $\\Delta\\chi^2\\sim 202$, suggesting that the new solution is a\ncorrect model for the event. From the estimation of the physical parameters\nbased on the new interpretation, we find that the lens system is composed of\ntwo low-mass stars with $\\sim 0.2\\ M_\\odot$ and $\\sim 0.1\\ M_\\odot$ and located\nat a distance $\\sim 3$ kpc. The fact that the physical parameters correspond to\nthose of the most common lens population located at a distance with a large\nlensing probability further supports the likelihood of the new interpretation.\nConsidering that two dramatically different solutions can approximately explain\nthe observed light curve, the event suggests the need of carefully testing all\npossible lens-system geometries.\n", "  The discovery of topological semimetal phase in three-dimensional (3D)\nsystems is a new breakthrough in topological material research. Dirac\nnodal-line semimetal is one of the three topological semimetal phases\ndiscovered so far; it is characterized by linear band crossing along a\nline/loop, contrasted with the linear band crossing at discrete momentum points\nin 3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals. The study of nodal-line semimetal is still at\ninitial stage; only three material systems have been verified to host nodal\nline fermions until now, including PbTaSe2, PtSn 4and ZrSiS. In this letter, we\nreport evidence of nodal line fermions in ZrSiSe and ZrSiTe probed in de Haas -\nvan Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations. Although ZrSiSe and ZrSiTe share\nsimilar layered structure with ZrSiS, our measurements of angular dependences\nof dHvA oscillations indicate the Fermi surface (FS) enclosing Dirac nodal line\nis of 2D character in ZiSiTe, in contrast with 3D-like FS in ZrSiSe and ZrSiS.\nAnother important property revealed in our experiment is that the nodal line\nfermion density in ZrSi(S/Se) (~ 10^20-10^21 cm^-3) is much higher than the\nDirac/Weyl fermion density of any known topological materials. In addition, we\nhave demonstrated ZrSiSe and ZrSiTe single crystals can be thinned down to 2D\natomic thin layers through microexfoliation, which offers a promising platform\nto verify the predicted 2D topological insulator in the monolayer materials\nwith ZrSiS-type structure\n", "  We report the results of a wide field CO mapping in the region of IRAS\n19312+1950. This IRAS object exhibits SiO/H$_2$O/OH maser emission, and is\nembedded in a chemically-rich molecular component, of which the origin is still\nunknown. In order to reveal the entire structure and gas mass of the\nsurrounding molecular component for the first time, we have mapped a wide\nregion around IRAS 19312+1950 in the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$, $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$ and\nC$^{18}$O $J=1-0$ lines using the Nobeyama 45m telescope. In conjunction with\nthe archival CO maps, we investigated a region with a size up to $20' \\times\n20'$ around this IRAS object. We calculated CO gas mass assuming the LTE\ncondition, a stellar velocity against to the interstellar medium assuming an\nanalytic model of a bow shock, and absolute luminosity using the latest\narchival data and trigonometric parallax distance. The derived gas-mass (225\nM$_{\\odot}$ $-$ 478 M$_{\\odot}$) of the molecular component and the relatively\nlarge luminosity ($2.63\\times10^{4}$ L$_{\\odot}$) suggest that the central\nSiO/H$_2$O/OH maser source seems to be a red supergiant (RSG) rather than an\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or post-AGB star.\n", "  The binary stellar system HD 93129A is one of the most massive known binaries\nin our Galaxy. This system presents non-thermal emission in the radio band,\nwhich can be used to infer its physical conditions and predict its emission in\nthe high-energy band. We intend to constrain some of the unknown parameters of\nHD 93129A through modelling the non-thermal emitter, and also to analyse the\ndetectability of this source in hard X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays. We develop a\nbroadband radiative model for the wind-collision region taking into account the\nevolution of the accelerated particles streaming along the shocked region, the\nemission by different radiative processes, and the attenuation of the emission\npropagating through the local matter and radiation fields. From the analysis of\nthe radio emission, we find that the binary HD~93129A is more likely to have a\nlow inclination and a high eccentricity. The minimum energy of the non-thermal\nelectrons seems to be between $\\sim 20 - 100$MeV, depending on the intensity of\nthe magnetic field in the wind-collision region. The latter can be in the range\n$\\sim 20 - 1500$ mG. Our model is able to reproduce the observed radio\nemission, and predicts that the non-thermal radiation from HD~93129A will\nincrease in the near future. With instruments such as \\textit{NuSTAR},\n\\textit{Fermi}, and CTA, it will be possible to constrain the relativistic\nparticle content of the source, and other parameters such as the magnetic field\nstrength in the wind collision zone, which in turn can be used to obtain\nupper-limits of the magnetic field on the surface of the very massive stars,\nthereby inferring whether magnetic field amplification is taking place in the\nparticle acceleration region.\n", "  We investigate the accretion-ejection process of jets from magnetized\naccretion disks. We apply a novel approach to the jet-launching problem in\norder to obtain correlations between the physical properties of the jet and the\nunderlying disk. We extend and confirm the previous works of\n\\citet{2009MNRAS.400..820T} and \\citet{2010A&A...512A..82M} by scanning a large\nparameter range for the disk magnetization, $\\mu_{\\rm D} = 10^{-3.5} ...\n10^{-0.7}$. We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the\noutflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We\nshow how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to\nthe disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual\nfindings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations\nfrom time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the\ndisk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the\nlocal disk magnetization and (i)the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass\nloading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate.\nEssentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and\nfaster jets, and, due to a larger Alfv\\'en lever arm, these jets extract more\nangular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have,\nhowever, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass\nejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where\nthe magnetization is $\\mu(r,z) \\simeq 0.1$. The magnetization rapidly increases\nvertically providing the energy reservoir for subsequent jet acceleration. We\nfind indication for a critical disk magnetization $\\mu_{\\rm D} \\simeq 0.01$\nthat separates the regimes of magnetocentrifugally-driven and magnetic\npressure-driven jets.\n", "  It has been proposed that particles bouncing between magnetized flows\nconverging in a reconnection region can be accelerated by the first order Fermi\nmechanism. Analytical considerations of this mechanism have shown that the\nspectral index of accelerated particles is related to the total plasma\ncompression within the reconnection region similarly to the case of diffusive\nshock acceleration mechanism. As a first step to investigate the efficiency of\nFermi acceleration in reconnection regions in producing hard energy spectra of\nparticles in the solar corona, we explore the degree of plasma compression that\ncan be achieved at reconnection sites. In particular, we aim to determine the\nconditions for the strong compressions to form. Using a two-dimensional\nresistive MHD numerical model we consider a set of magnetic field\nconfigurations where magnetic reconnection can occur including a Harris current\nsheet, a force-free current sheet, and two merging flux ropes. Plasma\nparameters are taken to be characteristic of the solar corona. Numerical\nsimulations show that strong plasma compressions ($\\geq 4$) in the reconnection\nregions can form when the plasma heating due to reconnection is efficiently\nremoved by fast thermal conduction or radiative cooling process. The radiative\ncooling process which is negligible in the typical 1 MK corona can play an\nimportant role in the low corona/transition region. It is found that plasma\ncompression is expected to be strongest in low-beta plasma $\\beta \\sim\n0.01-0.07$ at reconnection magnetic nulls.\n", "  The observed line intensity ratios of the Si II 1263 and 1307 \\AA\\ multiplets\nto that of Si II 1814\\,\\AA\\ in the broad line region of quasars are both an\norder of magnitude larger than the theoretical values. This was first pointed\nout by Baldwin et al. (1996), who termed it the \"Si II disaster\", and it has\nremained unresolved. We investigate the problem in the light of newly-published\natomic data for Si II. Specifically, we perform broad line region calculations\nusing several different atomic datasets within the CLOUDY modeling code under\noptically thick quasar cloud conditions. In addition, we test for selective\npumping by the source photons or intrinsic galactic reddening as possible\ncauses for the discrepancy, and also consider blending with other species.\nHowever, we find that none of the options investigated resolves the Si II\ndisaster, with the potential exception of microturbulent velocity broadening\nand line blending. We find that a larger microturbulent velocity ($\\sim 500 \\rm\n\\, kms^{-1}$) may solve the Si II disaster through continuum pumping and other\neffects. The CLOUDY models indicate strong blending of the Si II 1307 \\AA\\\nmultiplet with emission lines of O I, although the predicted degree of blending\nis incompatible with the observed 1263/1307 intensity ratios. Clearly, more\nwork is required on the quasar modelling of not just the Si II lines but also\nnearby transitions (in particular those of O I) to fully investigate if\nblending may be responsible for the Si II disaster.\n", "  Lightning induced radio emission has been observed on Solar system planets.\nThere have been many attempts to observe exoplanets in the radio wavelength,\nhowever, no unequivocal detection has been reported. Lecavelier des Etangs et\nal. carried out radio transit observations of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, and\nsuggested that a small part of the radio flux can be attributed to the planet.\nHere, we assume that this signal is real, and study if this radio emission\ncould be caused by lightning with similar energetic properties like in the\nSolar system. We find that a lightning storm with 3.8 x $10^6$ times larger\nflash densities than the Earth-storms with the largest lightning activity is\nneeded to produce the observed signal from HAT-P-11b. The optical emission of\nsuch thunderstorm would be comparable to that of the host star. We show that\nHCN produced by lightning chemistry is observable 2-3 yr after the storm, which\nproduces signatures in the L (3.0-4.0 \\mu m) and N (7.5-14.5 \\mu m) infrared\nbands. We conclude that it is unlikely that the observed radio signal was\nproduced by lightning, however, future, combined radio and infrared\nobservations may lead to lightning detection on planets outside the Solar\nsystem.\n", "  We generalize the concept of three-dimensional topological Weyl semimetal to\na class of five dimensional (5D) gapless solids, where Weyl points are\ngeneralized to Weyl surfaces which are two-dimensional closed manifolds in the\nmomentum space. Each Weyl surface is characterized by a U(1) second Chern\nnumber $C_2$ defined on a four-dimensional manifold enclosing the Weyl surface,\nwhich is equal to its topological linking number with other Weyl surfaces in\n5D. In analogy to the Weyl semimetals, the surface states of the 5D metal take\nthe form of topologically protected Weyl fermion arcs, which connect the\nprojections of the bulk Weyl surfaces. The further generalization of\ntopological metal in $2n+1$ dimensions carrying the $n$-th Chern number $C_n$\nis also discussed.\n", "  We describe the discovery of a satellite in orbit about the dwarf planet\n(136472) Makemake. This satellite, provisionally designated S/2015 (136472) 1,\nwas detected in imaging data collected with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide\nField Camera 3 on UTC April 27, 2015 at 7.80$\\pm$0.04 magnitudes fainter than\nMakemake. It likely evaded detection in previous satellite searches due to a\nnearly edge-on orbital configuration, placing it deep within the glare of\nMakemake during a substantial fraction of its orbital period. This\nconfiguration would place Makemake and its satellite near a mutual event\nseason. Insufficient orbital motion was detected to make a detailed\ncharacterization of its orbital properties, prohibiting a measurement of the\nsystem mass with the discovery data alone. Preliminary analysis indicates that\nif the orbit is circular, its orbital period must be longer than 12.4 days, and\nmust have a semi-major axis $\\gtrsim$21,000 km. We find that the properties of\nMakemake's moon suggest that the majority of the dark material detected in the\nsystem by thermal observations may not reside on the surface of Makemake, but\nmay instead be attributable to S/2015 (136472) 1 having a uniform dark surface.\nThis \"dark moon hypothesis\" can be directly tested with future JWST\nobservations. We discuss the implications of this discovery for the spin state,\nfigure, and thermal properties of Makemake and the apparent ubiquity of\ntrans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites.\n", "  Magnetic flux rope (MFR) plays an important role in solar activities. A\nquantitative assessment of the topology of an MFR and its evolution is crucial\nfor a better understanding of the relationship between the MFR and the\nassociated activities. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic field of\nactive region 12017 from 2014 March 28 to 29, where 12 flares were triggered by\nthe intermittent eruptions of a filament (either successful or confined). Using\nthe vector magnetic field data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on\nboard the \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we calculate the magnetic energy\nand helicity injection in the active region, and extrapolate the 3D magnetic\nfield with a nonlinear force-free field model. From the extrapolations, we find\nan MFR that is cospatial with the filament. We further determine the\nconfiguration of this MFR by a closed quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) around it.\nThen, we calculate the twist number and the magnetic helicity for the field\nlines composing the MFR. The results show that the closed QSL structure\nsurrounding the MFR gets smaller as a consequence of the flare occurrence. We\nalso find that the flares in our sample are mainly triggered by kink\ninstability. Moreover, the twist number varies more sensitively than other\nparameters to the occurrence of flares.\n", "  Heusler alloys have been intensively studied due to the wide variety of\nproperties that they exhibit. One of these properties is of particular interest\nfor technological applications, i.e. the fact that some Heusler alloys are\nhalf-metallic. In the following, a systematic study of the magnetic properties\nof three different Heusler families $\\textrm{Co}_2\\textrm{Mn}\\textrm{Z}$,\n$\\text{Co}_2\\text{Fe}\\text{Z}$ and $\\textrm{Mn}_2\\textrm{V}\\textrm{Z}$ with\n$\\text{Z}=\\left(\\text{Al, Si, Ga, Ge}\\right)$ is performed. A key aspect is the\ndetermination of the Gilbert damping from first principles calculations, with\nspecial focus on the role played by different approximations, the effect that\nsubstitutional disorder and temperature effects. Heisenberg exchange\ninteractions and critical temperature for the alloys are also calculated as\nwell as magnon dispersion relations for representative systems, the\nferromagnetic $\\textrm{Co}_2\\textrm{Fe}\\textrm{Si}$ and the ferrimagnetic\n$\\textrm{Mn}_2\\textrm{V}\\textrm{Al}$. Correlations effects beyond standard\ndensity-functional theory are treated using both the local spin density\napproximation including the Hubbard $U$ and the local spin density\napproximation plus dynamical mean field theory approximation, which allows to\ndetermine if dynamical self-energy corrections can remedy some of the\ninconsistencies which were previously reported for these alloys.\n", "  Fluxes emitted at different wavebands from active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nfluctuate at both long and short timescales. The variation can typically be\ncharacterized by a broadband power spectrum, which exhibits a red-noise process\nat high frequencies. The standard method of estimating power spectral density\n(PSD) of AGN variability is easily affected by systematic biases such as\nred-noise leakage and aliasing, in particular, when the observation spans a\nrelatively short period and is gapped. Focusing on the high-frequency PSD that\nis strongly distorted due to red-noise leakage and usually not significantly\naffected by aliasing, we develop a novel and observable normalized leakage\nspectrum (NLS), which describes sensitively the effects of leaked red-noise\npower on the PSD at different temporal frequencies. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we demonstrate how an AGN underlying PSD sensitively determines\nthe NLS when there is severe red-noise leakage and thereby how the NLS can be\nused to effectively constrain the underlying PSD.\n", "  The atomic transition from an excited state $|{\\rm e}\\rangle$ to the ground\nstate $|{\\rm g}\\rangle$ by emitting a neutrino pair and a photon, i.e., $|{\\rm\ne}\\rangle \\to |{\\rm g}\\rangle + |\\gamma\\rangle + |\\nu^{}_i\\rangle +\n|\\bar{\\nu}^{}_j\\rangle$ with $i, j = 1, 2, 3$, has been proposed by Yoshimura\nand his collaborators as an alternative way to determine the absolute scale\n$m^{}_0$ of neutrino masses. More recently, a statistical analysis of the fine\nstructure of the photon spectrum from this atomic process has been performed\n[N. Song {\\it et al.}, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 93}, 013020 (2016)] to\nquantitatively examine the experimental requirements for a realistic\ndetermination of absolute neutrino masses. In this paper, we show how to\nimprove the statistical analysis and demonstrate that the previously required\ndetection time can be reduced by one order of magnitude for the case of a\n$3\\sigma$ determination of $m_0^{} \\sim 0.01~\\text{eV}$ with an accuracy better\nthan $10\\%$. Such an improvement is very encouraging for further investigations\non measuring absolute neutrino masses through atomic processes.\n", "  The first two observational sky \"blocks\" of the Outer Solar System Origins\nSurvey (OSSOS) have significantly increased the number of well-characterized\nobserved trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in Neptune's mean motion resonances. We\ndescribe the 31 securely resonant TNOs detected by OSSOS so far, and we use\nthem to independently verify the resonant population models from the\nCanada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS; Gladman et al. 2012), with which we\nfind broad agreement. We confirm that the 5:2 resonance is more populated than\nmodels of the outer Solar System's dynamical history predict; our minimum\npopulation estimate shows that the high eccentricity (e>0.35) portion of the\nresonance is at least as populous as the 2:1 and possibly as populated as the\n3:2 resonance. One OSSOS block was well-suited to detecting objects trapped at\nlow libration amplitudes in Neptune's 3:2 resonance, a population of interest\nin testing the origins of resonant TNOs. We detected three 3:2 objects with\nlibration amplitudes below the cutoff modeled by CFEPS; OSSOS thus offers new\nconstraints on this distribution. The OSSOS detections confirm that the 2:1\nresonance has a dynamically colder inclination distribution than either the 3:2\nor 5:2 resonances. Using the combined OSSOS and CFEPS 2:1 detections, we\nconstrain the fraction of 2:1 objects in the symmetric mode of libration to be\n0.2-0.85; we also constrain the fraction of leading vs. trailing asymmetric\nlibrators, which has been theoretically predicted to vary depending on\nNeptune's migration history, to be 0.05-0.8. Future OSSOS blocks will improve\nthese constraints.\n", "  Context: Detailed oscillation spectra comprising individual frequencies for\nnumerous solar-type stars and red giants are or will become available. These\ndata can lead to a precise characterisation of stars.\n  Aims: Our goal is to test and compare different methods for obtaining stellar\nproperties from oscillation frequencies and spectroscopic constraints, in order\nto evaluate their accuracy and the reliability of the error bars.\n  Methods: In the context of the SpaceInn network, we carried out a\nhare-and-hounds exercise in which one group produced \"observed\" oscillation\nspectra for 10 artificial solar-type stars, and various groups characterised\nthese stars using either forward modelling or acoustic glitch signatures.\n  Results: Results based on the forward modelling approach were accurate to 1.5\n% (radius), 3.9 % (mass), 23 % (age), 1.5 % (surface gravity), and 1.8 % (mean\ndensity). For the two 1 Msun stellar targets, the accuracy on the age is better\nthan 10 % thereby satisfying PLATO 2.0 requirements. The average accuracies for\nthe acoustic radii of the base of the convection zone, the He II ionisation,\nand the Gamma_1 peak were 17 %, 2.4 %, and 1.9 %, respectively. Glitch fitting\nanalysis seemed to be affected by aliasing problems for some of the targets.\n  Conclusions: Forward modelling is the most accurate approach, but needs to be\ncomplemented by model-independent results from, e.g., glitch analysis.\nFurthermore, global optimisation algorithms provide more robust error bars.\n", "  We study the expansion of an initially strongly confined wave packet in a\none-dimensional weak random potential with short correlation length. At long\ntimes, the expansion of the wave packet comes to a halt due to destructive\ninterferences leading to Anderson localization. We develop an analytical\ndescription for the disorder-averaged localized density profile. For this\npurpose, we employ the diagrammatic method of Berezinskii which we extend to\nthe case of wave packets, present an analytical expression of the Lyapunov\nexponent which is valid for small as well as for high energies and, finally,\ndevelop a self-consistent Born approximation in order to analytically calculate\nthe energy distribution of our wave packet. By comparison with numerical\nsimulations, we show that our theory describes well the complete localized\ndensity profile, not only in the tails, but also in the center.\n", "  We consider response function and spin evolution in spin-orbit coupled cold\natomic gases in a synthetic gauge magnetic field influencing solely the orbital\nmotion of atoms. We demonstrate that various regimes of spin-orbit coupling\nstrength, magnetic field, and disorder can be treated within a single approach\nbased on the representation of atomic motion in terms of auxiliary collective\nclassical trajectories. Our approach allows for a unified description of\nfermionic and bosonic gases.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of four high redshift blazars, S5 0014+81\n($z=3.37$), CGRaBS J0225+1846 ($z=2.69$), BZQ J1430+4205 ($z=4.72$), and 3FGL\nJ1656.2$-$3303 ($z=2.40$), using the quasi-simultaneous data from {\\it Swift},\n{\\it NuSTAR}, and {\\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) and also the archival\n{\\it XMM-Newton} observations. Other than 3FGL J1656.2$-$3303, none of the\nsources were known as $\\gamma$-ray emitters and our analysis of $\\sim$7.5 years\nof LAT data reveals the first time detection of the statistically significant\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from CGRaBS J0225+1846. We generate the broadband\nspectral energy distributions (SED) of all the objects, centering at the epoch\nof {\\it NuSTAR} observations and reproduce them using a one zone leptonic\nemission model. The optical$-$UV emission in all the objects can be explained\nby the radiation from the accretion disk, whereas, X-ray to $\\gamma$-ray window\nof the SEDs are found to be dominated by the inverse Compton scattering off the\nbroad line region photons. All of them host billion solar mass black holes.\nComparing the accretion disk luminosity and the jet power of these sources with\na large sample of blazars, we find them to occupy high disk luminosity-jet\npower regime. We also investigate the X-ray spectral properties of the sources\nin detail with a major focus on studying the causes of soft X-ray deficit, a\nfeature generally seen in high redshift radio-loud quasars. We summarize that\nthis feature could be explained based on the intrinsic curvature in the jet\nemission rather than due to external effects predicted in the earlier studies,\nsuch as host galaxy and/or warm absorption.\n", "  We initiated the Robo-AO Kepler Planetary Candidate Survey in 2012 to observe\neach Kepler exoplanet candidate host star with high-angular-resolution\nvisible-light laser-adaptive-optics imaging. Our goal is to find nearby stars\nlying in Kepler's photometric apertures that are responsible for the relatively\nhigh probability of false-positive exoplanet detections and that cause\nunderestimates of the size of transit radii. Our comprehensive survey will also\nshed light on the effects of stellar multiplicity on exoplanet properties and\nwill identify rare exoplanetary architectures. In this second part of our\nongoing survey, we observed an additional 969 Kepler planet candidate hosts and\nwe report blended stellar companions up to $\\Delta m \\approx 6$ that contribute\nto Kepler's measured light curves. We found 203 companions within $\\sim$4\" of\n181 of the Kepler stars, of which 141 are new discoveries. We measure the\nnearby-star probability for this sample of Kepler planet candidate host stars\nto be 10.6% $\\pm$ 1.1% at angular separations up to 2.5\", significantly higher\nthan the 7.4% $\\pm$ 1.0% probability discovered in our initial sample of 715\nstars; we find the probability increases to 17.6% $\\pm$ 1.5% out to a\nseparation of 4.0\". The median position of KOIs observed in this survey are\n1.1$^{\\circ}$ closer to the galactic plane which may account for some of the\nnearby-star probability enhancement. We additionally detail 50 Keck adaptive\noptics images of Robo-AO observed KOIs in order to confirm 37 companions\ndetected at a $<5\\sigma$ significance level and to obtain additional infrared\nphotometry on higher-significance detected companions.\n", "  We study the direction- and wavelength-dependent polarization anisotropy in\nlight scattering at the air-photonic crystal interface as a function of angle\nof incidence for TE and TM polarized light. This is done using optical\nreflectivity measurements at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone of a\nthree-dimensional photonic crystal with fcc symmetry. Polarized reflectivity\nmeasurements indicate the presence of stop gap branching for TE polarization,\nwhich is absent for TM polarization till the Brewster angle at K point. In\ncontrast, stop gap branching is present for both TE and TM polarizations at W\npoint due to the intricate mixing of crystal planes. This characteristic\nbehavior signifies the inevitable role of energy exchange in the stop gap\nbranching. The measured polarization anisotropy shows a prominent shift in the\nBrewster angle for on-resonance wavelength as compared to the off-resonance\nalong both K and W points, and that, in accordance with theory. Our results\nhave implications in polarization-induced light scattering in sub-wavelength\nphotonic structures like plasmonic crystals, and meta-materials.\n", "  We discuss hydrogen diffusion and solubility in aluminum alloyed Fe-Mn\nalloys. The systems of interest are subjected to tetragonal and isotropic\ndeformations. Based on ab initio modelling, we calculate solution energies,\nthen employ Oriani's theory which reflects the influence of Al alloying via\ntrap site diffusion. This local equilibrium model is complemented by\nqualitative considerations of Einstein diffusion. Therefore, we apply the\nclimbing image nudged elastic band method to compute the minimum energy paths\nand energy barriers for hydrogen diffusion. Both for diffusivity and solubility\nof hydrogen, we find that the influence of the substitutional Al atom has both\nlocal chemical and nonlocal volumetric contributions.\n", "  Wrinkles commonly develop in a thin film deposited on a soft elastomer\nsubstrate when the film is subject to compression. Motivated by recent\nexperiments [Agrawal et al., Soft Matter 8, 7138 (2012)] that show how wrinkle\nmorphology can be controlled by using a nematic elastomer substrate, we develop\nthe theory of small-amplitude wrinkles of an isotropic film atop a nematic\nelastomer. The directors of the nematic elastomer are assumed to lie in a plane\nparallel to the plane of the undeformed film. For uniaxial compression of the\nfilm along the direction perpendicular to the elastomer directors, the system\nbehaves as a compressed film on an isotropic substrate. When the uniaxial\ncompression is along the direction of nematic order, we find that the soft\nelasticity characteristic of liquid crystal elastomers leads to a critical\nstress for wrinkling which is very small compared to the case of an isotropic\nsubstrate. We also determine the wavelength of the wrinkles at the critical\nstress, and show how the critical stress and wavelength depend on substrate\ndepth and the anisotropy of the polymer chains in the nematic elastomer.\n", "  The observed relation between the X-ray and radio properties of\nlow-luminosity accreting black holes has enabled the identification of multiple\ncandidate black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) in globular clusters. Here we\nreport an identification of the radio source VLA J213002.08+120904 (aka M15\nS2), recently reported in Kirsten et al. 2014, as a BHXB candidate. They showed\nthat the parallax of this flat-spectrum variable radio source indicates a\n2.2$^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ kpc distance, which identifies it as lying in the\nforeground of the globular cluster M15. We determine the radio characteristics\nof this source, and place a deep limit on the X-ray luminosity of\n$\\sim4\\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we astrometrically identify a\nfaint red stellar counterpart in archival Hubble images, with colors consistent\nwith a foreground star; at 2.2 kpc its inferred mass is 0.1-0.2 $M_{\\odot}$. We\nrule out that this object is a pulsar, neutron star X-ray binary, cataclysmic\nvariable, or planetary nebula, concluding that VLA J213002.08+120904 is the\nfirst accreting black hole X-ray binary candidate discovered in quiescence\noutside a globular cluster. Given the relatively small area over which parallax\nstudies of radio sources have been performed, this discovery suggests a much\nlarger population of quiescent BHXBs in our Galaxy,\n$2.6\\times10^4-1.7\\times10^8$ BHXBs at $3\\sigma$ confidence, than has been\npreviously estimated ($\\sim10^2-10^4$) through population synthesis.\n", "  We present spectroscopic stellar parameters for the complete target list of\n164 evolved stars from the Pan-Pacific Planet Search, a five-year radial\nvelocity campaign using the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope. For 87 of these\nbright giants, our work represents the first determination of their fundamental\nparameters. Our results carry typical uncertainties of 100 K, 0.15 dex, and 0.1\ndex in $T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, and [Fe/H] and are consistent with literature\nvalues where available. The derived stellar masses have a mean of\n$1.31^{+0.28}_{-0.25}$ Msun, with a tail extending to $\\sim$2 Msun, consistent\nwith the interpretation of these targets as \"retired\" A-F type stars.\n", "  We study inflation in the Brans-Dicke gravity as a special model of the\nscalar-tensor gravity. We obtain the inflationary observables containing the\nscalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the scalar\nspectral index and the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter in terms of the\ngeneral form of the potential in the Jordan frame. Then, we compare the results\nfor various inflationary potentials in light of the Planck 2015 data. Our study\nshows that in the Brans-Dicke gravity, the power-law, inverse power-law and\nexponential potentials are ruled out by the Planck 2015 data. But, the hilltop,\nHiggs, Coleman-Weinberg and natural potentials can be compatible with Planck\n2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data at 95\\% CL. Moreover, the D-brane, SB SUSY and\ndisplaced quadratic potentials can be in well agreement with the observational\ndata since their results can lie inside the 68\\% CL region of Planck 2015\nTT,TE,EE+lowP data.\n", "  We present the results of ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxy, IRAS 20551-4250, at HCN/HCO+/HNC J=3-2 lines at both\nvibrational-ground (v=0) and vibrationally excited (v2=1) levels. This galaxy\ncontains a luminous buried active galactic nucleus (AGN), in addition to\nstarburst activity, and our ALMA Cycle 0 data revealed a tentatively detected\nvibrationally excited HCN v2=1f J=4-3 emission line. In our ALMA Cycle 2 data,\nthe HCN/HCO+/HNC J=3-2 emission lines at v=0 are clearly detected. The HCN and\nHNC v2=1f J=3-2 emission lines are also detected, but the HCO+ v2=1f J=3-2\nemission line is not. Given the high-energy level of v2=1 and the resulting\ndifficulty of collisional excitation, we compared these results with those of\nthe calculation of infrared radiative pumping, using the available infrared\n5-35 micron spectrum. We found that all of the observational results were\nreproduced, if the HCN abundance was significantly higher than that of HCO+ and\nHNC. The flux ratio and excitation temperature between v2=1f and v=0, after\ncorrection for possible line opacity, suggests that infrared radiative pumping\naffects rotational (J-level) excitation at v=0 at least for HCN and HNC. The\nHCN-to-HCO+ v=0 flux ratio is higher than those of starburst-dominated regions,\nand will increase even more when thederived high HCN opacity is corrected. The\nenhanced HCN-to-HCO+ flux ratio in this AGN-hosting galaxy can be explained by\nthe high HCN-to-HCO+ abundance ratio and sufficient HCN excitation at up to\nJ=4, rather than the significantly higher efficiency of infrared radiative\npumping for HCN than HCO+.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel powerful strategy to perform searches for\nnew electroweak states. Uncolored electroweak states appear in generic\nextensions of the Standard Model (SM) and yet are challenging to discover at\nhadron colliders. This problem is particularly acute when the lightest state in\nthe electroweak multiplet is neutral and all multiplet components are\napproximately degenerate. In this scenario, production of the charged fields of\nthe multiplet is followed by decay into nearly invisible states; if this decay\noccurs promptly, the only way to infer the presence of the reaction is through\nits missing energy signature. Our proposal relies on emission of photon\nradiation from the new charged states as a means of discriminating the signal\nfrom SM backgrounds. We demonstrate its broad applicability by studying two\nexamples: a pure Higgsino doublet and an electroweak quintuplet field.\n", "  New near- and far-ultraviolet (NUV and FUV) HST spectra of Mrk 231, the\nnearest quasar known, are combined with ground-based optical spectra to study\nthe remarkable dichotomy between the FUV and NUV-optical spectral regions in\nthis object. The FUV emission-line features are faint, broad, and highly\nblueshifted (up to ~7000 km/s), with no significant accompanying absorption. In\ncontrast, the profiles of the NUV absorption features resemble those of the\noptical Na I D, He I, and Ca II H and K lines, exhibiting broad blue-shifted\ntroughs that overlap in velocity space with the FUV emission-line features and\nindicate a dusty, high-density and patchy broad absorption line (BAL) screen\ncovering ~90% of the observed continuum source at a distance less than ~2 - 20\npc. The FUV continuum emission does not show the presence of any obvious\nstellar features and is remarkably flat compared with the steeply declining NUV\ncontinuum. The NUV (FUV) features and continuum emission have not varied\nsignificantly over the past ~22 (3) years and are unresolved on scales ~40\n(170) pc. These results favor an AGN origin for the NUV - FUV line and\ncontinuum emission. The observed FUV line emission is produced in the\noutflowing BAL cloud system, while the Balmer lines arise primarily from the\nstandard broad line region seen through the dusty BAL screen. Our data are\ninconsistent with the recently proposed binary black hole model. We argue\ninstead that Mrk~231 is the nearest example of weak-lined \"wind-dominated\"\nquasars with high Eddington ratios and geometrically thick (\"slim\") accretion\ndisks; these quasars are likely more common in the early universe.\n", "  Effect of dc electric field on transport of highly mobile 2D electrons is\nstudied in wide GaAs single quantum wells placed in titled magnetic fields. The\nstudy shows that in perpendicular magnetic field resistance oscillates due to\nelectric field induced Landau-Zener transitions between quantum levels that\ncorresponds to geometric resonances between cyclotron orbits and periodic\nmodulation of electron density of states. Magnetic field tilt inverts these\noscillations. Surprisingly the strongest inverted oscillations are observed at\na tilt corresponding to nearly absent modulation of the electron density of\nstates in regime of magnetic breakdown of semiclassical electron orbits. This\nphenomenon establishes an example of quantum resistance oscillations due to\nLandau quantization, which occur in electron systems with a constant density of\nstates.\n", "  Nearly 1/3 of the sources listed in the Third Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) catalog (3FGL) remain unassociated. It is possible that predicted and\neven unanticipated gamma-ray source classes are present in these data waiting\nto be discovered. Taking advantage of the excellent spectral capabilities\nachieved by the Fermi LAT, we use machine learning classifiers (Random Forest\nand XGBoost) to pinpoint potentially novel source classes in the unassociated\n3FGL sample outside the Galactic plane. Here we report a total of 34\nhigh-confidence Galactic candidates at |b| > 5 degrees. The currently favored\nstandard astrophysical interpretations for these objects are pulsars or\nlow-luminosity globular clusters hosting millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Yet, these\nobjects could also be interpreted as dark matter annihilation taking place in\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies or dark matter subhalos. Unfortunately, Fermi LAT\nspectra are not sufficient to break degeneracies between the different\nscenarios. Careful visual inspection of archival optical images reveals no\nobvious evidence for low-luminosity globular clusters or ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies inside the 95% error ellipses. If these are pulsars, this would bring\nthe total number of MSPs at |b| > 5 degrees to 106. We find this number to be\nin excellent agreement with predictions from a new population synthesis of MSPs\nthat predicts 100-126 high-latitude 3FGL MSPs depending on the choice of\nhigh-energy emission model. If, however, these are dark matter substructures,\nwe can place upper limits on the number of Galactic subhalos surviving today\nand on dark matter annihilation cross sections. These limits are beginning to\napproach the canonical thermal relic cross section for dark matter particle\nmasses below ~100 GeV in the bottom quark annihilation channel.\n", "  We propose a scheme in which the cooling of a mechanical resonator is\nachieved by exposing the optomechanical system to a non-Markovian environment.\nBecause of the backflow from the non-Markovian environment, the phonon number\ncan go beyond the conventional cooling limit in a Markovian environment.\nUtilizing the spectrum density obtained in the recent experiment [Nature\nCommunications 6, 7606 (2015)], we show that the cooling process is highly\neffective in a non-Markovian environment. The analysis of the cooling mechanism\nin a non-Markovian environment reveals that the non-Markovian memory effect is\ninstrumental to the cooling process.\n", "  We consider the minimal U(1)' extension of the standard model (SM) with the\nclassically conformal invariance, where an anomaly-free U(1)' gauge symmetry is\nintroduced along with three generations of right-handed neutrinos and a U(1)'\nHiggs field. Since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional\nparameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson\n($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling\nbetween the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative\nU(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry. In this model context, we first investigate the electroweak vacuum\ninstability problem in the SM. Employing the renormalization group equations at\nthe two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the\ntop quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform\nparameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak\nvacuum instability problem. Next we interpret the recent ATLAS and CMS search\nlimits at the LHC Run-2 for the sequential $Z$' boson to constrain the\nparameter region in our model. Combining the constraints from the electroweak\nvacuum stability and the LHC Run-2 results, we find a bound on the $Z$' boson\nmass as $m_{Z'} \\gtrsim 3.5$ TeV. We also calculate self-energy corrections to\nthe SM Higgs doublet field through the heavy states, the right-handed neutrinos\nand the $Z$' boson, and find the naturalness bound as $m_{Z'} \\lesssim 7$ TeV,\nin order to reproduce the right electroweak scale for the fine-tuning level\nbetter than 10\\%. The resultant mass range of $3.5$ TeV $\\lesssim m_{Z'}\n\\lesssim 7$ TeV will be explored at the LHC Run-2 in the near future.\n", "  Reverse shock (RS) emission from Gamma Ray Bursts is an important tool in\ninvestigating the nature of the ejecta from the central engine. If the ejecta\nmagnetization is not high enough to suppress the RS, a strong RS emission\ncomponent, usually peaking in the optical/IR band early on, would give\nimportant contribution to early afterglow light curves. In the radio band,\nsynchrotron self-absorption may suppress early RS emission, and also delay the\nRS peak time. In this paper, we calculate the self-absorbed RS emission in the\nradio band for different dynamical conditions. In particular, we stress that\nthe RS radio emission is subject to self-absorption in both reverse and forward\nshocks. We calculate the ratio between the reverse to forward shock flux at the\nRS peak time for different frequencies, which is a measure of the detectability\nof the RS emission component. We then constrain the range of physical\nparameters for a detectable RS, in particular the role of magnetization. We\nnotice that unlike optical RS emission which is enhanced by moderate\nmagnetization, a moderately magnetized ejecta does not necessarily produce a\nbrighter radio RS due to the self-absorption effect. For typical parameters,\nthe RS emission component would not be detectable below 1 GHz unless the medium\ndensity is very low (e.g. $n < 10^{-3} ~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ for ISM and $A_* <\n5\\times 10^{-4}$ for wind). These predictions can be tested with the afterglow\nobservations with current and upcoming radio facilities such as JVLA, LOFAR,\nFAST, and SKA.\n", "  We present a combined analysis of the Chandra and Swift observations of the\n2015 X-ray echo of V404 Cygni. Using stacking analysis, we identify eight\nseparate rings in the echo. We reconstruct the soft X-ray lightcurve of the\nJune 2015 outburst using the high-resolution Chandra images and\ncross-correlations of the radial intensity profiles, indicating that about 70%\nof the outburst fluence occurred during the bright flare at the end of the\noutburst on MJD 57199.8.By deconvolving the intensity profiles with the\nreconstructed outburst lightcurve, we show that the rings correspond to eight\nseparate dust concentrations with precise distance determinations. We further\nshow that the column density of the clouds varies significantly across the\nfield of view, with the centroid of most of the clouds shifted toward the\nGalactic plane, relative to the position of V404 Cyg, invalidating the\nassumption of uniform cloud column typically made in attempts to constrain dust\nproperties from light echoes. We present a new XSPEC spectral dust scattering\nmodel that calculates the differential dust scattering cross section for a\nrange of commonly used dust distributions and compositions and use it to\njointly fit the entire set of Swift echo data. We find that a standard\nMathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck model provides an adequate fit to the ensemble of echo\ndata. The fit is improved by allowing steeper dust distributions, and models\nwith simple silicate and graphite grains are preferred over models with more\ncomplex composition.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of enforcing a massless Majorana neutrino in the\ndirect and semi-direct approaches to lepton mixing, in which the PMNS matrix is\npartly predicted by subgroups of a discrete family symmetry, extending previous\ngroup searches up to order 1535. We find a phenomenologically viable scheme for\nthe semi-direct approach based on $Q(648)$ which contains $\\Delta(27)$ and the\nquaternion group as subgroups. This leads to novel predictions for the first\ncolumn of the PMNS matrix corresponding to a normal neutrino mass hierarchy\nwith $m_1=0$, and sum rules for the mixing angles and phase which are\ncharacterised by the solar angle being on the low side $\\theta_{12}\\sim\n31^{\\circ}$ and the Dirac (oscillation) CP phase $\\delta$ being either about\n$\\pm 45^\\circ$ or $\\pm \\pi$.\n", "  Origin of mass may be strong dynamics of matter in the vacuum. Since the\ninitial proposal of Nambu for the origin of the nucleon mass, the dynamical\nsymmetry breaking in the strongly coupled underlying theories has been\nexpanding the horizons in the context of the modern version of the origin of\nmass beyond the Standard Model (SM). The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is a\ntypical strong coupling theory with the non-zero critical coupling, in sharp\ncontrast to its precedent model, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for the\nsuperconductor. The non-zero critical coupling is also hidden in the\nasymptotically free gauge theories including QCD and walking technicolor. As is\nwell known, the NJL model can be cast into the SM Higgs Lagrangian. We show\nthat the SM Higgs Lagrangian is simply rewritten into a form of the\n(approximately) scale-invariant nonlinear sigma model, with both the chiral\nsymmetry and scale symmetry realized nonlinearly, with the SM Higgs being\nnothing but the (pseudo-) dilaton. The SM Higgs Lagrangian is further gauge\nequivalent to the scale-invariant Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian,\ns-HLS, having spin 1 bosons hidden in the SM. As the simplest possible\nunderlying theory for the SM Higgs Lagrangian we first discuss the top quark\ncondensate (\"top-mode SM\"), where the top-mode dilaton is the 125 GeV Higgs. We\nthen discuss the walking technicolor having near infrared conformality, whose\neffective theory is the s-HLS model precisely the same as the SM Higgs\nLagrangian (with larger chiral symmetry), where the 125 GeV Higgs is\nsuccessfully identified with the techidilaton.\n", "  As followup to our recent detection of a pre-transit signal around HD 189733\nb, we obtained full pre-transit phase coverage of a single planetary transit.\nThe pre-transit signal is again detected in the Balmer lines but with variable\nstrength and timing, suggesting that the bow shock geometry reported in our\nprevious work does not describe the signal from the latest transit. We also\ndemonstrate the use of the Ca II H and K residual core flux as a proxy for the\nstellar activity level throughout the transit. A moderate trend is found\nbetween the pre-transit absorption signal in the 2013 data and the Ca II H\nflux. This suggests that some of the 2013 pre-transit hydrogen absorption can\nbe attributed to varying stellar activity levels. A very weak correlation is\nfound between the Ca II H core flux and the Balmer line absorption in the 2015\ntransit, hinting at a smaller contribution from stellar activity compared to\nthe 2013 transit. We simulate how varying stellar activity levels can produce\nchanges in the Balmer line transmission spectra. These simulations show that\nthe strength of the 2013 and 2015 pre-transit signals can be reproduced by\nstellar variability. If the pre-transit signature is attributed to\ncircumplanetary material, its evolution in time can be described by accretion\nclumps spiraling towards the star, although this interpretation has serious\nlimitations. Further high-cadence monitoring at H-alpha is necessary to\ndistinguish between true absorption by transiting material and short-term\nvariations in the stellar activity level.\n", "  Blazars are usually classified following their synchrotron peak frequency\n($\\nu F(\\nu)$ scale) as high, intermediate, low frequency peaked BL Lacs (HBLs,\nIBLs, LBLs), and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), or, according to their\nradio morphology at large scale, FR~I or FR~II. However, the diversity of\nblazars is such that these classes seem insufficient to chart the specific\nproperties of each source. We propose to classify a wide sample of blazars\nfollowing the kinematic features of their radio jets seen in very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI). For this purpose we use public data from the MOJAVE\ncollaboration in which we select a sample of blazars with known redshift and\nsufficient monitoring to constrain apparent velocities. We selected 161 blazars\nfrom a sample of 200 sources. We identify three distinct classes of VLBI jets\ndepending on radio knot kinematics: class I with quasi-stationary knots, class\nII with knots in relativistic motion from the radio core, and class I/II,\nintermediate, showing quasi-stationary knots at the jet base and relativistic\nmotions downstream. A notable result is the good overlap of this kinematic\nclassification with the usual spectral classification; class I corresponds to\nHBLs, class II to FSRQs, and class I/II to IBLs/LBLs. We deepen this study by\ncharacterizing the physical parameters of jets from VLBI radio data. Hence we\nfocus on the singular case of the class I/II by the study of the blazar BL Lac\nitself. Finally we show how the interpretation that radio knots are\nrecollimation shocks is fully appropriate to describe the characteristics of\nthese three classes.\n", "  We study the proposal that a $d+1$ dimensional induced metric is constructed\nfrom a $d$ dimensional field theory using gradient flow. Applying the idea to\nthe O($N$) $\\varphi^4$ model and normalizing the flow field, we have shown in\nthe large $N$ limit that the induced metric is finite and universal in the\nsense that it does not depend on the details of the flow equation and the\noriginal field theory except for the renormalized mass, which is the only\nrelevant quantity in this limit. We have found that the induced metric\ndescribes Euclidean Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space in both ultra-violet (UV) and\ninfra-red (IR) limits of the flow direction, where the radius of the AdS is\nbigger in the IR than in the UV.\n", "  At the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton ($p\\bar{p}$) collider, Drell-Yan\nlepton pairs are produced in the process $p \\bar{p} \\rightarrow e^+e^- + X$\nthrough an intermediate $\\gamma^*/Z$ boson. The forward-backward asymmetry in\nthe polar-angle distribution of the $e^-$ as a function of the $e^+e^-$-pair\nmass is used to obtain $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff}$, the effective\nleptonic determination of the electroweak-mixing parameter $\\sin^2\\theta_W$.\nThe measurement sample, recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF),\ncorresponds to 9.4~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from $p\\bar{p}$\ncollisions at a center-of-momentum energy of 1.96 TeV, and is the full CDF Run\nII data set. The value of $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff}$ is found to be\n$0.23248 \\pm 0.00053$. The combination with the previous CDF measurement based\non $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ pairs yields $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff} = 0.23221 \\pm\n0.00046$. This result, when interpreted within the specified context of the\nstandard model assuming $\\sin^2 \\theta_W = 1 - M_W^2/M_Z^2$ and that the $W$-\nand $Z$-boson masses are on-shell, yields $\\sin^2\\theta_W = 0.22400 \\pm\n0.00045$, or equivalently a $W$-boson mass of $80.328 \\pm 0.024 \\;{\\rm\nGeV}/c^2$.\n", "  To explain the high temperature of the corona, much attention has been paid\nto the distribution of energy in dissipation events. Indeed, if the event\nenergy distribution is steep enough, the smallest, unobservable events could be\nthe largest contributors to the total energy dissipation in the corona.\nPrevious observations have shown a wide distribution of energies but remain\ninconclusive about the precise slope. Furthermore, these results rely on a very\ncrude estimate of the energy. On the other hand, more detailed spectroscopic\nstudies of structures such as coronal bright points do not provide enough\nstatistical information to derive their total contribution to heating. We aim\nat getting a better estimate of the distributions of the energy dissipated in\ncoronal heating events using high-resolution, multi-channel Extreme\nUltra-Violet (EUV) data. To estimate the energies corresponding to heating\nevents and deduce their distribution, we detect brightenings in five EUV\nchannels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). We combine the results of these detections and we use maps\nof temperature and emission measure derived from the same observations to\ncompute the energies. We obtain distributions of areas, durations, intensities,\nand energies (thermal, radiative, and conductive) of events. These\ndistributions are power-laws, and we find also power-law correlations between\nevent parameters. The energy distributions indicate that the energy from a\npopulation of events like the ones we detect represents a small contribution to\nthe total coronal heating, even when extrapolating to smaller scales. The main\nexplanations for this are how heating events can be extracted from\nobservational data, and the incomplete knowledge of the thermal structure and\nprocesses in the coronal plasma attainable from available observations.\n", "  The problem of coupling multiple spin ensembles through cavity photons is\nrevisited by using PyBTM organic radicals and a high-$T_c$ superconducting\ncoplanar resonator. An exceptionally strong coupling is obtained and up to\nthree spin ensembles are simultaneously coupled. The ensembles are made\nphysically distinguishable by chemically varying the $g$ factor and by\nexploiting the inhomogeneities of the applied magnetic field. The coherent\nmixing of the spin and field modes is demonstrated by the observed multiple\nanticrossing, along with the simulations performed within the input-output\nformalism, and quantified by suitable entropic measures.\n", "  To explore the role of titanium- and calcium-dust depletion in gas in and\naround galaxies we systematically study Ti/Ca abundance ratios in intervening\nabsorption-line systems at low and high redshift. We investigate\nhigh-resolution optical spectra obtained by the UVES instrument at the Very\nLarge Telescope and spectroscopically analyze 34 absorption-line systems at\nz<=0.5 to measure column densities (or limits) for CaII and TiII. We complement\nour UVES data set with previously published absorption-line data on Ti/Ca for\nredshifts up to z~3.8. Our absorber sample contains 110 absorbers (DLAs,\nsub-DLAs & LLSs). We compare our Ti/Ca findings with results from the Milky Way\nand the Magellanic Clouds and discuss the properties of Ti/Ca absorbers in the\ngeneral context of quasar absorption-line systems.Our analysis indicates that\nthere are two distinct populations of absorbers with either high or low Ti/Ca\nratios with a separation at [Ti/Ca}]~1. While the calcium dust depletion in\nmost of the absorbers appears to be severe, the titanium depletions are mild in\nsystems with high Ti/Ca ratios. The derived trend indicates that absorbers with\nhigh Ti/Ca ratios have dust-to-gas ratios that are substantially lower than in\nthe Milky Way. We characterize the overall nature of the absorbers by\ncorrelating Ti/Ca with other observables (e.g., metallicity, velocity-component\nstructure) and by modeling the ionization properties of singly-ionized Ca and\nTi in different environments. We conclude that CaII and TiII bearing\nabsorption-line systems trace predominantly neutral gas in the disks and inner\nhalo regions of galaxies, where the abundance of Ca and Ti reflects the local\nmetal and dust content of the gas. Our study suggests that the Ti/Ca ratio\nrepresents a useful measure for the gas-to-dust ratio and overall metallicity\nin intervening absorption-line systems.\n", "  Over two decades ago, a prominent, mysterious emission band peaking at ~20.1\nmicrometer was serendipitously detected in four preplanetary nebulae (PPNe;\nalso known as \"protoplanetary nebulae\"). So far, this spectral feature,\ndesignated as the \"21 micrometer\" feature, has been seen in 18 carbon-rich\nPPNe. The nature of the carriers of this feature remains unknown although many\ncandidate materials have been proposed. The 21 micrometer sources also exhibit\nan equally mysterious, unidentified emission feature peaking at 30 micrometer.\nWhile the 21 micrometer feature is exclusively seen in PPNe, a short-lived\nevolutionary stage between the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and\nplanetary nebula (PN) phases, the 30 micrometer feature is commonly observed in\nall stages of stellar evolution from the AGB through PPN to PNe phases. We\nderive the stellar mass loss rates (M_{loss}) of these 21 micrometer sources\nfrom their dust infrared (IR) emission, using the \"2-DUST\" radiative transfer\ncode for axisymmetric dusty systems which allows one to distinguish the mass\nloss rates of the AGB phase (\\dot{M_{AGB}}) from that of the superwind\n(\\dot_{M_{SW}}) phase. We examine the correlation between \\dot{M_{AGB}} or\n\\dot_{M_{SW}} and the fluxes emitted from the 21 and 30 micrometer features. We\nfind that both features tend to correlate with \\dot{M_{AGB}}, suggesting that\ntheir carriers are probably formed in the AGB phase. The nondetection of the 21\nmicrometer feature in AGB stars suggests that, unlike the 30 micrometer\nfeature, the excitation of the carriers of the 21 micrometer feature may\nrequire ultraviolet photons which are available in PPNe but not in AGB stars.\n", "  We present our optical follow-up observations to search for an\nelectromagnetic counterpart of the first gravitational wave source GW150914 in\nthe framework of the Japanese collaboration for Gravitational wave\nElectroMagnetic follow-up (J-GEM), which is an observing group utilizing\noptical and radio telescopes in Japan, as well as those in New Zealand, China,\nSouth Africa, Chile, and Hawaii. We carried out a wide-field imaging survey\nwith Kiso Wide Field Camera (KWFC) on the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope in\nJapan and a galaxy-targeted survey with Tripole5 on the B&C 61-cm telescope in\nNew Zealand. Approximately 24 deg2 regions in total were surveyed in i-band\nwith KWFC and 18 nearby galaxies were observed with Tripole5 in g-, r-, and\ni-bands 4-12 days after the gravitational wave detection. Median 5-sigma depths\nare i~18.9 mag for the KWFC data and g~18.9 mag, r~18.7 mag, and i~18.3 mag for\nthe Tripole5 data. Probability for a counterpart to be in the observed area is\n1.2% in the initial skymap and 0.1% in the final skymap. We do not find any\ntransient source associated to an external galaxy with spatial offset from its\ncenter, which is consistent with the local supernova rate. We summarize future\nprospects and ongoing efforts to pin down electromagnetic counterparts of\nbinary black hole mergers as well as neutron star mergers.\n", "  We study the damping of longitudinal oscillations of a prominence thread\ncaused by the mass accretion. In this model we considered a thin curved\nmagnetic tube filled with the plasma. The parts of the tube at the two sides of\nthe thread are filled with hot rarefied plasma. We assume that there are flows\nof rarefied plasma toward the thread caused by the plasma evaporation at the\nmagnetic tube footpoints. Our main assumption is that the hot plasma is\ninstantaneously accommodated by the thread when it arrives at the thread, and\nits temperature and density become equal to those of the thread. Then we derive\nthe system of ordinary differential equations describing the thread dynamics.\nWe consider linear and nonlinear oscillation. The nonlinearity reduces the\ndamping time, however this reduction is small. The damping time is inversely\nproportional to the accretion rate. We also obtain that the oscillation periods\ndecrease with time. However even for the largest initial oscillation amplitude\nconsidered in our article the period reduction does not exceed 20%. We conclude\nthat the mass accretion can damp the motion of the threads rapidly. Thus, this\nmechanism can explain the observed strong damping of large-amplitude\nlongitudinal oscillations. In addition, the damping time can be used to\ndetermine the mass accretion rate and indirectly the coronal heating.\n", "  A key outstanding question in Martian science is 'are the polar caps gaining\nor losing mass and what are the implications for past, current and future\nclimate?' To address this question, we use observations from the Compact\nReconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) of the north polar cap\nduring late summer for multiple Martian years, to monitor the summertime water\ncycle in order to place quantitative limits on the amount of water ice\ndeposited and sublimed in late summer.\n  We establish here for the first time the summer cycle of water ice absorption\nband signatures on the north polar cap. We show that in a key region in the\ninterior of the north polar cap, the absorption band depths grow until Ls=120,\nwhen they begin to shrink, until they are obscured at the end of summer by the\nnorth polar hood. This behavior is transferable over the entire north polar\ncap, where in late summer regions 'flip' from being net sublimating into net\ncondensation mode. This transition or 'mode flip' happens earlier for regions\ncloser to the pole, and later for regions close to the periphery of the cap.\n  The observations and calculations presented herein estimate that on average a\nwater ice layer ~70 microns thick is deposited during the Ls=135-164 period.\nThis is far larger than the results of deposition on the south pole during\nsummer, where an average layer 0.6-6 microns deep has been estimated by Brown\net al. (2014).\n", "  We develop the consequences of introducing a purely leptonic, lepton number\nviolating non-standard interaction (NSI) and standard model neutrino mixing\nwith a fourth, sterile neutrino in the analysis of short-baseline, neutrino\nexperiments. We focus on the muon decay at rest (DAR) result from the Liquid\nScintillation Neutrino Experiment (LSND) and the Karlsruhe and Rutherford\nMedium Energy Neutrino Experiment (KARMEN). We make a comprehensive analysis of\nlepton number violating, NSI effective operators and find nine that affect muon\ndecay relevant to LSND results. Two of these preserve the standard model (SM)\nvalue 3/4 for the Michel rho and delta parameters and, overall, show favorable\nagreement with precision data and the electron anti-neutrino signal from LSND\ndata. We display theoretical models that lead to these two effective operators.\nIn the model we choose to apply to DAR data, both electron anti-neutrino\nappearance from muon anti-neutrino oscillation and electron anti-neutrino\nsurvival after production from NSI decay of the positive muon contribute to the\nexpected signal. This is a unique feature of our scheme. We find a range of\nparameters where both experiments can be accommodated consistently with recent\nglobal, sterile neutrino fits to short baseline data. We comment on\nimplications of the models for new physics searches at colliders and comment on\nfurther implications of the lepton number violating interactions plus sterile\nneutrino-standard model neutrino mixing.\n", "  The probability distribution for the free energy of directed polymers in\nrandom media (DPRM) with uncorrelated noise in $d=1+1$ dimensions satisfies the\nTracy-Widom distribution. We inquire if and how this universal distribution is\nmodified in the presence of spatially correlated noise. The width of the\ndistribution scales as the DPRM length to an exponent $\\beta$, in good (but not\nfull) agreement with previous renormalization group and numerical results. The\nscaled probability is well described by the Tracy-Widom form for uncorrelated\nnoise, but becomes symmetric with increasing correlation exponent. We thus find\na class of distributions that continuously interpolates between Tracy-Widom and\nGaussian forms.\n", "  The rare kaon decays $K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ are strongly suppressed in the\nstandard model and widely regarded as processes in which new phenomena, not\npredicted by the standard model, may be observed. Recognizing such new\nphenomena requires precise standard model prediction for the braching ratio of\n$K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ with controlled uncertainty for both short-distance and\nlong-distance contributions. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of\nlattice QCD calculation of the long-distance contribution to rare kaon decays\nwith the emphasis on $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$. Our methodology covers the\ncalculation of both $W$-$W$ and $Z$-exchange diagrams. We discuss the\nestimation of the power-law, finite-volume corrections and two methods to\nconsistently combine the long distance contribution determined by the lattice\nmethods outlined here with the short distance parts that can be reliably\ndetermined using perturbation theory. It is a subsequent work of our first\nmethodology paper on $K\\to\\pi\\ell^+\\ell^-$, where the focus was made on the\n$\\gamma$-exchange diagrams.\n", "  We exploit the widely-separated images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1029+2623\n($z_{em}$=2.197, $\\theta =22^{\\prime\\prime}\\!\\!.5$) to observe its outflowing\nwind through two different sightlines. We present an analysis of three\nobservations, including two with the Subaru telescope in 2010 February (Misawa\net al. 2013) and 2014 April (Misawa et al. 2014), separated by 4 years, and one\nwith the Very Large Telescope, separated from the second Subaru observation by\n$\\sim$2 months. We detect 66 narrow absorption lines (NALs), of which 24 are\nclassified as intrinsic NALs that are physically associated with the quasar\nbased on partial coverage analysis. The velocities of intrinsic NALs appear to\ncluster around values of $v_{ej}$ $\\sim$ 59,000, 43,000, and 29,000 km/s, which\nis reminiscent of filamentary structures obtained by numerical simulations.\nThere are no common intrinsic NALs at the same redshift along the two\nsightlines, implying that the transverse size of the NAL absorbers should be\nsmaller than the sightline distance between two lensed images. In addition to\nthe NALs with large ejection velocities of $v_{ej}$ > 1,000 km/s, we also\ndetect broader proximity absorption lines (PALs) at $z_{abs}$ $\\sim$ $z_{em}$.\nThe PALs are likely to arise in outflowing gas at a distance of r $\\leq$ 620 pc\nfrom the central black hole with an electron density of $n_e$ $\\geq$\n8.7$\\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$. These limits are based on the assumption that\nthe variability of the lines is due to recombination. We discuss the\nimplications of these results on the three-dimensional structure of the\noutflow.\n", "  We present an analysis of physical conditions in the Orion Veil, a largely\natomic PDR that lies just in front (about 2 pc) of the Trapezium stars. We have\nobtained 21 cm HI and 18 cm OH VLA Zeeman effect data. These data yield images\nof the line-of-sight magnetic field strength Blos in atomic and molecular\nregions of the Veil. We find Blos is typically -50 to -75 microgauss in the\natomic gas across much of the Veil (25\" resolution); Blos is -350 microgauss at\none position in the molecular gas (40\" resolution). The Veil has two principal\nHI velocity components. Magnetic and kinematical data suggest a close\nconnection between these components. They may represent gas on either side of a\nshock wave preceding a weak-D ionization front. Magnetic fields in the Veil HI\ncomponents are 3-5 times stronger than they are elsewhere in the ISM where N(H)\nand n(H) are comparable. The HI components are magnetically subcritical\n(magnetically dominated), like the CNM, although they are about 1 dex denser.\nStrong fields in the Veil HI components may have resulted from low turbulence\nconditions in the diffuse gas that gave rise to OMC-1. Strong fields may also\nbe related to magnetostatic equilibrium that has developed in the Veil since\nstar formation. We consider the location of the Orion-S molecular core,\nproposing a location behind the main Orion H+ region.\n", "  Variable emission from Sgr~A*, the luminous counterpart to the super-massive\nblack hole at the center of our Galaxy, arises from the innermost portions of\nthe accretion flow. Better characterization of the variability is important for\nconstraining models of the low-luminosity accretion mode powering Sgr~A*, and\ncould further our ability to use variable emission as a probe of the strong\ngravitational potential in the vicinity of the\n$4\\times10^{6}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ black hole. We use the \\textit{Herschel}\nSpectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) to monitor Sgr~A* at\nwavelengths that are difficult or impossible to observe from the ground. We\nfind highly significant variations at 0.25, 0.35, and 0.5 mm, with temporal\nstructure that is highly correlated across these wavelengths. While the\nvariations correspond to $<$1% changes in the total intensity in the\n\\textit{Herschel} beam containing Sgr~A*, comparison to independent,\nsimultaneous observations at 0.85 mm strongly supports the reality of the\nvariations. The lowest point in the light curves, $\\sim$0.5 Jy below the\ntime-averaged flux density, places a lower bound on the emission of Sgr~A* at\n0.25 mm, the first such constraint on the THz portion of the SED. The\nvariability on few hour timescales in the SPIRE light curves is similar to that\nseen in historical 1.3 mm data, where the longest time series is available, but\nthe distribution of variations in the sub-mm do not show a tail of\nlarge-amplitude variations seen at 1.3 mm. Simultaneous X-ray photometry from\nXMM-Newton shows no significant variation within our observing period, which\nmay explain the lack of very large variations if X-ray and submillimeter flares\nare correlated.\n", "  Using a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies selected from the ALFALFA blind\nHI-survey and observed using the VIMOS IFU, we investigate the relationship\nbetween H$\\alpha$ emission and Balmer optical depth ($\\tau_{\\text{b}}$). We\nfind a positive correlation between H$\\alpha$ luminosity surface density and\nBalmer optical depth in 8 of 11 at $\\geq$ 0.8$\\sigma$ significance (6 of 11 at\n$\\geq$ 1.0$\\sigma$) galaxies. Our spaxels have physical scales ranging from 30\nto 80 pc, demonstrating that the correlation between these two variables\ncontinues to hold down to spatial scales as low as 30 pc. Using the Spearman's\nrank correlation coefficient to test for correlation between\n$\\Sigma_{\\text{H}\\alpha}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{b}}$ in all the galaxies combined,\nwe find $\\rho = 0.39$, indicating a positive correlation at 4$\\sigma$\nsignificance. Our low stellar-mass galaxy results are in agreement with\nobservations of emission line regions in larger spiral galaxies, indicating\nthat this relationship is independent of the size of the galaxy hosting the\nemission line region. The positive correlation between H$\\alpha$ luminosity and\nBalmer optical depth within spaxels is consistent with the hypothesis that\nyoung star-forming regions are surrounded by dusty birth-clouds.\n", "  Numerical approaches to higher-order calculations often employ subtraction\nterms, both for the real emission and the virtual corrections. These\nsubtraction terms have to be added back. In this paper we show that at NLO the\nreal subtraction terms, the virtual subtraction terms, the integral\nrepresentations of the field renormalisation constants and -- in the case of\ninitial-state partons -- the integral representation for the collinear\ncounterterm can be grouped together to give finite integrals, which can be\nevaluated numerically. This is useful for an extension towards NNLO.\n", "  With about 2000 extrasolar planets confirmed, the results show that planetary\nsystems have a whole range of unexpected properties. We present a full\ninvestigation of the HD219828 system, a bright metal-rich star for which a hot\nneptune has previously been detected. We used a set of HARPS, SOPHIE, and\nELODIE radial velocities to search for the existence of orbiting companions to\nHD219828. A dynamical analysis is also performed to study the stability of the\nsystem and to constrain the orbital parameters and planet masses. We announce\nthe discovery of a long period (P=13.1years) massive (msini=15.1MJup) companion\n(HD219828c) in a very eccentric orbit (e=0.81). The same data confirms the\nexistence of a hot-neptune, HD219828b, with a minimum mass of 21 MEarth and a\nperiod of 3.83days. The dynamical analysis shows that the system is stable. The\nHD219828 system is extreme and unique in several aspects. First, among all\nknown exoplanet systems it presents an unusually high mass ratio. We also show\nthat systems like HD219828, with a hot neptune and a long-period massive\ncompanion are more frequent than similar systems with a hot jupiter instead.\nThis suggests that the formation of hot neptunes follows a different path than\nthe formation of their hot jovian counterparts. The high mass, long period, and\neccentricity of HD219828c also make it a good target for Gaia astrometry as\nwell as a potential target for atmospheric characterisation, using direct\nimaging or high-resolution spectroscopy. Astrometric observations will allow us\nto derive its real mass and orbital configuration. If a transit of HD219828b is\ndetected, we will be able to fully characterise the system, including the\nrelative orbital inclinations. With a clearly known mass, HD219828c may become\na benchmark object for the range in between giant planets and brown dwarfs.\n", "  Most radio galaxies are hosted by giant gas-poor ellipticals, but some\ncontain significant amounts of dust, which is likely to be of external origin.\nIn order to characterize the mid-IR properties of two of the most nearby and\nbrightest merger-remnant radio galaxies of the Southern hemisphere, NGC 1316\n(Fornax A) and NGC 612 (PKS 0131-36), we used observations with the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 micron\nand Spitzer mid-infrared spectra. By applying a resolution-enhancement\ntechnique, new WISE images were produced at angular resolutions ranging from\n2.6\" to 5.5\". Global measurements were performed in the four WISE bands, and\nstellar masses and star-formation rates were estimated using published scaling\nrelations. Two methods were used to uncover the distribution of dust, one\nrelying on two-dimensional fits to the 3.4 micron images to model the\nstarlight, and the other one using a simple scaling and subtraction of the 3.4\nmicron images to estimate the stellar continuum contribution to the emission in\nthe 12 and 22 micron bands. The two galaxies differ markedly in their mid-IR\nproperties. The 3.4 micron brightness distribution can be well represented by\nthe superposition of two Sersic models in NGC 1316 and by a Sersic model and an\nexponential disk in NGC 612. The WISE colors of NGC 1316 are typical of those\nof early-type galaxies; those of NGC 612 are in the range found for\nstar-forming galaxies. From the 22 micron luminosity, we infer a star-formation\nrate of about 0.7 solar masses per year in NGC 1316 and about 7 solar masses\nper year in NGC 612. Spitzer spectroscopy shows that the 7.7-to-11.3 micron PAH\nline ratio is significantly lower in NGC 1316 than in NGC 612. The WISE images\nreveal resolved emission from dust in the central 1'-2' of the galaxies.\n(Abridged)\n", "  We present MUSE integral field spectroscopic data of the S0 galaxy NGC 3115\nobtained during the instrument commissioning at the ESO Very Large Telescope\n(VLT). We analyse the galaxy stellar kinematics and stellar populations and\npresent two dimensional maps of their associated quantities. We thus illustrate\nthe capacity of MUSE to map extra-galactic sources to large radii in an\nefficient manner, i.e., ~4 Re, and provide relevant constraints on its mass\nassembly. We probe the well known set of substructures of NGC 3115 (its nuclear\ndisc, stellar rings, outer kpc-scale stellar disc and spheroid) and show their\nindividual associated signatures in the MUSE stellar kinematics and stellar\npopulations maps. In particular, we confirm that NGC 3115 has a thin fast\nrotating stellar disc embedded in a fast rotating spheroid, and that these two\nstructures show clear differences in their stellar age and metallicity\nproperties. We emphasise an observed correlation between the radial stellar\nvelocity, V, and the Gauss-Hermite moment, h3, creating a \"butterfly\" shape in\nthe central 15\" of the h3 map. We further detect the previously reported weak\nspiral and ring-like structures, and find evidence that these features can be\nassociated with regions of younger mean stellar ages. We provide tentative\nevidence for the presence of a bar, despite the fact that the V-h3 correlation\ncan be reproduced by a simple axisymmetric dynamical model. Finally, we present\na reconstruction of the two dimensional star formation history of NGC 3115 and\nfind that most of its current stellar mass was formed at early epochs (>12Gyr\nago), while star formation continued in the outer (kpc-scale) stellar disc\nuntil recently. Since z~2, and within ~4 Re, we suggest that NGC 3115 has been\nmainly shaped by secular processes.\n", "  Here we present the first results from ALMA observations of 1 mm polarized\ndust emission towards the W43-MM1 high mass star forming clump. We have\ndetected a highly fragmented filament with source masses ranging from 14Msun to\n312Msun, where the largest fragment, source A, is believed to be one of the\nmost massive in our Galaxy. We found a smooth, ordered, and detailed\npolarization pattern throughout the filament which we used to derived magnetic\nfield morphologies and strengths for 12 out of the 15 fragments detected\nranging from 0.2 to 9 mG. The dynamical equilibrium of each fragment was\nevaluated finding that all the fragments are in a super-critical state which is\nconsistent with previously detected infalling motions towards W43-MM1.\nMoreover, there are indications suggesting that the field is being dragged by\ngravity as the whole filament is collapsing.\n", "  We report the detection of large variations in the outflow wind velocity from\na young eruptive star, V899 Mon during its ongoing high accretion outburst\nphase. Such large variations in the outflow velocity (from -722 km s$^{-1}$ to\n-425 km s$^{-1}$) have never been reported previously in this family of\nobjects. Our continuous monitoring of this source shows that the\nmulti-component, clumpy, and episodic high velocity outflows are stable in the\ntime scale of a few days, and vary over the time scale of a few weeks to\nmonths. We detect significant decoupling in the instantaneous outflow strength\nto accretion rate. From the comparison of various possible outflow mechanisms\nin magnetospheric accretion of young stellar objects, we conclude magnetically\ndriven polar winds to be the most consistent mechanism for the outflows seen in\nV899 Mon. The large scale fluctuations in outflow over the short period makes\nV899 Mon the most ideal source to constrain various magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulations of magnetospheric accretion.\n  *footnote: based on observations made with the Southern African Large\nTelescope (SALT)\n", "  Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for fermions are becoming the\nstandard to provide high quality reference data in systems that are too large\nto be investigated via quantum chemical approaches. DMC with the fixed-node\napproximation relies on modifications of the Green function to avoid\nsingularities near the nodal surface of the trial wavefunction. We show that\nthese modifications affect the DMC energies in a way that is not\nsize-consistent, resulting in large time-step errors. Building on the\nmodifications of Umrigar {\\em et al.} and of DePasquale {\\em et al.} we propose\na simple Green function modification that restores size-consistency to large\nvalues of time-step; substantially reducing the time-step errors. The new\nalgorithm also yields remarkable speedups of up to two orders of magnitude in\nthe calculation of molecule-molecule binding energies and crystal cohesive\nenergies, thus extending the horizons of what is possible with DMC.\n", "  We report the first direct imaging of protoplanetary disks in the\nstar-forming region of Carina, the most distant, massive cluster in which disks\nhave been imaged. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array\n(ALMA), disks are observed around two young stellar objects (YSOs) that are\nembedded inside evaporating gaseous globules and exhibit jet activity. The\ndisks have an average size of 120 AU and total masses of 30 and 50 M_Jup. Given\nthe measured masses, the minimum timescale required for planet formation (~1-2\nMyr) and the average age of the Carina population (~1-4 Myr), it is plausible\nthat young planets are present or their formation is currently ongoing in these\ndisks. The non-detection of millimeter emission above the 4sigma threshold (~7\nM_Jup) in the core of the massive cluster Trumpler~14, an area containing\npreviously identified proplyd candidates, suggest evidence for rapid\nphoto-evaporative disk destruction in the cluster's harsh radiation field. This\nwould prevent the formation of giant gas planets in disks located in the cores\nof Carina's dense sub-clusters, whereas the majority of YSO disks in the wider\nCarina region remain unaffected by external photo-evaporation.\n", "  Pulsars are rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron stars, with highly\nstable rotational period and gradual spin-down over a long timescale due to the\nloss of radiation. Glitches refer to the events that suddenly increase the\nrotational speed of a pulsar. The exact causes of glitches and the resulting\nprocesses are not fully understood. It is generally believed that couplings\nbetween the normal matter and the superfluid components, and the starquakes,\nare the common causes of glitches. In this study, one famous glitching pulsar,\nPSR~J2021+4026, is investigated. PSR~J2021+4026 is the first variable gamma-ray\npulsar observed by Fermi. From the gamma-ray observations, it is found that the\npulsar experienced a significant flux drop, an increase in the spin-down rate,\na change in the pulse profile and a shift in the spectral cut-off to a lower\nenergy, simultaneously around 2011 October 16. To explain these effects on the\nhigh-energy emissions by the glitch of PSR~J2021+4026, we hypothesized the\nglitch to be caused by the rearrangement of the surface magnetic field due to\nthe crustal plate tectonic activities on the pulsar which is triggered by a\nstarquake. In this glitch event, the inclination angle of the magnetic dipole\naxis is slightly shifted. This proposition is then tested by numerical modeling\nusing a three-dimensional two-layer outer gap model. The simulation results\nindicate that a modification of the inclination angle can affect the pulse\nprofile and the spectral properties, which can explain the observation changes\nafter the glitch.\n", "  Heating of whole interstellar dust grains by cosmic-ray (CR) particles\naffects the gas-grain chemistry in molecular clouds by promoting molecule\ndesorption, diffusion, and chemical reactions on grain surfaces. The frequency\nof such heating $f_T$, s$^{-1}$, determines how often a certain temperature\n$T_{\\rm CR}$, K, is reached for grains hit by CR particles. This study aims to\nprovide astrochemists with comprehensive and updated dataset on the CR-induced\nwhole-grain heating. We present calculations of $f_T$ and $T_{\\rm CR}$ spectra\nfor bare olivine grains with radius $a$ of 0.05; 0.1; 0.2 $\\mu$m, and such\ngrains covered with ice mantles of thickness 0.1$a$ and 0.3$a$. Grain shape and\nstructure effects are considered, as well as 30 CR elemental constituents with\nan updated energy spectrum corresponding to a translucent cloud with $A_V=2$\nmag. Energy deposition by CRs in grain material was calculated with the SRIM\nprogram. We report full $T_{\\rm CR}$ spectra for all nine grain types and\nconsider initial grain temperatures of 10 K and 20 K. We also provide\nfrequencies for a range of minimum $T_{\\rm CR}$ values. The calculated dataset\ncan be simply and flexibly implemented in astrochemical models. The results\nshow that, in the case of translucent clouds, the currently adopted rate for\nheating of whole grains to temperatures in excess of 70 K is underestimated by\napproximately two orders of magnitude in astrochemical numerical simulations.\nAdditionally, grains are heated by CRs to modest temperatures (20--30 K) with\nintervals of a few years, which reduces the possibility of ice chemical\nexplosions.\n", "  We present a method for analyzing the interaction between radiation and\nmatter in regions of intense, relativistic shear that can arise in many\nastrophysical situations. We show that there is a simple velocity profile that\nshould be manifested in regions of large shear that have \"lost memory\" of their\nboundary conditions, and we use this self-similar velocity profile to construct\nthe surface of last scattering, or $\\tau \\simeq 1$ surface, as viewed from any\ncomoving point within the flow. We demonstrate that a simple treatment of\nscattering from this $\\tau \\simeq 1$ surface exactly conserves photon number,\nand derive the rate at which the radiation field is heated due to the shear\npresent in the flow. The components of the comoving radiation energy-momentum\ntensor are calculated, and we show that they have relatively simple,\napproximate forms that interpolate between the viscous (small shear) and\nstreaming (large shear) limits. We put our expression for the energy-momentum\ntensor in a covariant form that does not depend on the explicit velocity\nprofile within the fluid and, therefore, represents a natural means for\nanalyzing general, radiation-dominated, relativistic shear flows.\n", "  Solar p-mode oscillations exhibit a systematic offset towards higher\nfrequencies due to shortcomings in the 1D stellar structure models, especially,\nthe lack of turbulent pressure in the superadiabatic layers just below the\noptical surface, arising from the convective velocity field. We study the\ninfluence of the turbulent expansion, chemical composition, and magnetic fields\non the stratification in the upper layers of the solar models in comparison\nwith solar observations. Furthermore, we test alternative <3D> averages for\nimproved results on the oscillation frequencies. We appended temporally and\nspatially averaged <3D> stratifications to 1D models to compute adiabatic\noscillation frequencies that we then tested against observations. We also\ndeveloped depth-dependent corrections for the solar 1D model, for which we\nexpanded the geometrical depth to match the pressure stratification of the\nsolar <3D> model, and we reduced the density that is caused by the turbulent\npressure. We obtain the same results with our <3D> models as have been reported\npreviously. Our depth-dependent corrected 1D models match the observations to\nalmost a similar extent as the <3D> model. We find that correcting for the\nexpansion of the geometrical depth and the reducing of the density are both\nequally necessary. Interestingly, the influence of the adiabatic exponent Gam1\nis less pronounced than anticipated. The turbulent elevation directly from the\n<3D> model does not match the observations properly. Considering different\nreference depth scales for the <3D> averaging leads to very similar\nfrequencies. Solar models with high metal abundances in their initial chemical\ncomposition match the low-frequency part much better. We find a linear relation\nbetween the p-mode frequency shift and the vertical magnetic field strength\nwith dvnl = 26.21Bz microHz/kG, which is able to render the solar activity\ncycles correctly.\n", "  We demonstrate thermally limited force spectroscopy using a probe formed by a\ndielectric microsphere optically trapped in water near a dielectric surface. We\nachieve force resolution below 1 fN in 100 s, corresponding to a 2 {\\AA} rms\ndisplacement of the probe. Our measurement combines a calibrated evanescent\nwave particle tracking technique and a lock-in detection method. We demonstrate\nthe accuracy of our method by measurement of the height-dependent force exerted\non the probe by an evanescent wave, the results of which are in agreement with\nMie theory calculations.\n", "  We show that the nonlinear stage of modulational instability induced by\nparametric driving in the {\\em defocusing} nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation can\nbe accurately described by combining mode truncation and averaging methods,\nvalid in the strong driving regime. The resulting integrable oscillator reveals\na complex hidden heteroclinic structure of the instability. A remarkable\nconsequence, validated by the numerical integration of the original model, is\nthe existence of breather solutions separating different Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\nrecurrent regimes. Our theory also shows that optimal parametric amplification\nunexpectedly occurs outside the bandwidth of the resonance (or Arnold tongues)\narising from the linearised Floquet analysis.\n", "  We have been conducting a survey for distant solar system objects beyond the\nKuiper Belt edge (~50 AU) with new wide-field cameras on the Subaru 8 meter and\nCTIO 4 meter telescopes. We are interested in the orbits of objects that are\ndecoupled from the giant planet region in order to understand the structure of\nthe outer solar system, including whether a massive planet exists beyond a few\nhundred AU as first reported by Trujillo and Sheppard (2014). In addition to\ndiscovering extreme trans-Neptunian objects detailed elsewhere, we have found\nseveral objects with high perihelia (q>40 AU) that differ from the extreme and\ninner Oort cloud objects due to their moderate semi-major axes (50<a<100 AU)\nand eccentricities (e<0.3). Newly discovered objects 2014 FZ71 and 2015 FJ345\nhave the third and fourth highest perihelia known after Sedna and 2012 VP113,\nyet their orbits are not nearly as eccentric or distant. We found several of\nthese high perihelion but moderate orbit objects and observe that they are\nmostly near Neptune mean motion resonances and have significant inclinations\n(i>20 degrees). These moderate objects likely obtained their unusual orbits\nthrough combined interactions with Neptune's mean motion resonances and the\nKozai resonance, similar to the origin scenarios for 2004 XR190. We also find\nthe distant 2008 ST291 has likely been modified by the MMR+KR mechanism through\nthe 6:1 Neptune resonance. We discuss these moderately eccentric, distant\nobjects along with some other interesting low inclination outer classical belt\nobjects like 2012 FH84 discovered in our ongoing survey.\n", "  We predict the distribution of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), under the assumption that the dwarf galaxy hosts\na central massive black hole (MBH). For the majority of stars ejected from the\nLMC the orbital velocity of the LMC has contributed a significant fraction of\ntheir galactic rest frame velocity, leading to a dipole density distribution on\nthe sky. We quantify the dipole using spherical harmonic analysis and contrast\nwith the monopole expected for HVSs ejected from the Galactic Center. There is\na tendril in the density distribution that leads the LMC which is coincident\nwith the well-known and unexplained clustering of HVSs in the constellations of\nLeo and Sextans. Our model is falsifiable, since it predicts that Gaia will\nreveal a large density of HVSs in the southern hemisphere.\n", "  We study Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity and construct the dyonic (A)dS planar\nblack holes in general even dimensions, that carry both the electric charge and\nmagnetic fluxes along the planar space. In four dimensions, the solution can be\nconstructed with also spherical and hyperbolic topologies. We study the black\nhole thermodynamics and obtain the first law. We also classify the singularity\nstructure.\n", "  The nature of the early Martian climate is one of the major unanswered\nquestions of planetary science. Key challenges remain, but a new wave of\norbital and in situ observations and improvements in climate modeling have led\nto significant advances over the last decade. Multiple lines of geologic\nevidence now point to an episodically warm surface during the late Noachian and\nearly Hesperian periods 3-4 Ga. The low solar flux received by Mars in its\nfirst billion years and inefficiency of plausible greenhouse gases such as CO2\nmeans that the steady-state early Martian climate was likely cold. A denser CO2\natmosphere would have caused adiabatic cooling of the surface and hence\nmigration of water ice to the higher altitude equatorial and southern regions\nof the planet. Transient warming caused melting of snow and ice deposits and a\ntemporarily active hydrological cycle, leading to erosion of the valley\nnetworks and other fluvial features. Precise details of the warming mechanisms\nremain unclear, but impacts, volcanism and orbital forcing all likely played an\nimportant role. The lack of evidence for glaciation across much of Mars'\nancient terrain suggests the late Noachian surface water inventory was not\nsufficient to sustain a northern ocean. While mainly inhospitable on the\nsurface, early Mars may nonetheless have presented significant opportunities\nfor the development of microbial life.\n", "  We report the discovery of a dwarf protoplanetary disk around the star XZ Tau\nB that shows all the features of a classical transitional disk but on a much\nsmaller scale. The disk has been imaged with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), revealing that its dust emission has a\nquite small radius of ~ 3.4 au and presents a central cavity of ~ 1.3 au in\nradius that we attribute to clearing by a compact system of orbiting\n(proto)planets. Given the very small radii involved, evolution is expected to\nbe much faster in this disk (observable changes in a few months) than in\nclassical disks (observable changes requiring decades) and easy to monitor with\nobservations in the near future. From our modeling we estimate that the mass of\nthe disk is large enough to form a compact planetary system.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of a mid infrared study of G49.5-0.4, or\nW51A, part of the massive starbirth complex W51. Combining public data from the\n$Spitzer$ IRAC camera, and Gemini mid infrared camera T-ReCS at 7.73, 9.69,\n12.33 and 24.56 \\micron, with spatial resolution of $\\sim$0.5\\arcsec, we have\nidentified the mid infrared counterparts of 8 ultracompact HII regions, showing\nthat two radio sources are deeply embedded in molecular clouds and another is a\ncloud of ionized gas. From the T-ReCS data we have unveiled the central core of\nW51 region, revealing massive young stellar candidates. We modeled the spectral\nenergy distribution of the detected sources suggesting the embedded objects are\nsources with spectral types ranging from B3 to O5, but the majority of the fits\nindicate stellar objects with B1 spectral types. We also present an extinction\nmap of IRS~2, showing that a region with lower extinction corresponds to the\nregion where a proposed jet of gas has impacted the foreground cloud. From this\nmap, we also derived the total extinction towards the enigmatic source IRS~2E,\nwhich amounts to $\\sim$60 magnitudes in the $V$ band. We calculated the color\ntemperature due to thermal emission of the circumstellar dust of the detected\nsources; the temperatures are in the interval of $\\sim$100 -- 150 K, which\ncorresponds to the emission of dust located at 0.1 pc from the central source.\nFinally, we show a possible mid infrared counterpart of a detected source at mm\nwavelengths that was found by \\cite{zap08,zap09} to be a massive young stellar\nobject undergoing a high accretion rate.\n", "  A pulsar timing array is a Galactic-scale detector of nanohertz gravitational\nwaves (GWs). Its target signals contain two components: the `Earth term' and\nthe `pulsar term' corresponding to GWs incident on the Earth and pulsar\nrespectively. In this work we present a Frequentist method for the detection\nand localization of continuous waves that takes into account the pulsar term\nand is significantly faster than existing methods. We investigate the role of\npulsar terms by comparing a full-signal search with an Earth-term-only search\nfor non-evolving black hole binaries. By applying the method to synthetic data\nsets, we find that (i) a full-signal search can slightly improve the detection\nprobability (by about five percent); (ii) sky localization is biased if only\nEarth terms are searched for and the inclusion of pulsar terms is critical to\nremove such a bias; (iii) in the case of strong detections (with\nsignal-to-noise ratio $\\gtrsim$ 30), it may be possible to improve pulsar\ndistance estimation through GW measurements.\n", "  The physical properties and elemental abundances of the interstellar medium\nin galaxies during cosmic reionization are important for understanding the role\nof galaxies in this process. We report the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array detection of an oxygen emission line at a\nwavelength of 88 micrometers from a galaxy at an epoch about 700 million years\nafter the Big Bang. The oxygen abundance of this galaxy is estimated at about\none-tenth that of the Sun. The non-detection of far-infrared continuum emission\nindicates a deficiency of interstellar dust in the galaxy. A carbon emission\nline at a wavelength of 158 micrometers is also not detected, implying an\nunusually small amount of neutral gas. These properties might allow ionizing\nphotons to escape into the intergalactic medium.\n", "  Liquid transportation fuels require costly and time-consuming tests to\ncharacterize metrics, such as Research Octane Number (RON) for gasoline. If\nfuel sale restrictions requiring use of standard Cooperative Fuel Research\ntesting procedures do not apply, these tests may be avoided by using\nmultivariate statistical models to predict RON and other quantities. Here we\nshow that an accurate statistical model for the RON of gasoline and\ngasoline-like fuels can be constructed by ensuring the representation of key\nfunctional groups in the spectroscopic data set are used to train the model. We\nfound that a principal component regression model for RON based on IR\nabsorbance and informed using neat and 134 mixtures of n-heptane, isooctane,\ntoluene, ethanol, methylcyclohexane, and 1-hexene could predict RON for the 10\nCoordinating Research Council Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engine (FACE)\ngasolines and 12 FACE gasoline blends with ethanol within 34.8+/-36.1 on\naverage and 51.2 in the worst case. We next studied the effect of adding 28\nadditional minor components found in the FACE gasolines to the statistical\nmodel, and determined that it was necessary to add additional representatives\nof the branched alkane and aromatics classes to reduce model error. For\nexample, adding 2,3-dimethylpentane and xylene to the previous model allowed it\nto predict RON for the 22 target fuels within 0.3+/-4.4 on average and 7.9 in\nthe worst case. However, we determined that the specific choice of fuel in\nthose classes mattered less than ensuring the representation of the relevant\nfunctional group. This work builds upon previous efforts by creating models\ninformed by neat and surrogate fuels---rather than complex real fuels---that\ncould predict the performance of complex unknown fuels.\n", "  We study the effect of an elliptically polarized magnetic field on a system\nof non-interacting, single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles characterized by\na uniform distribution of easy axis directions. Our main goal is to determine\nthe average magnetization of this system and the power loss in it. In order to\ncalculate these quantities analytically, we develop a general perturbation\ntheory for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and find its steady-state\nsolution for small magnetic field amplitudes. On this basis, we derive the\nsecond-order expressions for the average magnetization and power loss,\ninvestigate their dependence on the magnetic field frequency, and analyze the\nrole of subharmonic resonances resulting from the nonlinear nature of the LLG\nequation. For arbitrary amplitudes, the frequency dependence of these\nquantities is obtained from the numerical solution of this equation. The impact\nof transitions between different regimes of regular and chaotic dynamics of\nmagnetization, which can be induced in nanoparticles by changing the magnetic\nfield frequency, is examined in detail.\n", "  We study wave scattering from a gently curved surface. We show that the\nrecursive relations, implied by shift invariance, among the coefficients of the\nperturbative series for the scattering amplitude allow to perform an infinite\nresummation of the perturbative series to all orders in the amplitude of the\ncorrugation. The resummed series provides a derivative expansion of the\nscattering amplitude in powers of derivatives of the height profile, which is\nexpected to become exact in the limit of quasi-specular scattering. We discuss\nthe relation of our results with the so-called small-slope approximation\nintroduced some time ago by Voronovich.\n", "  We examine the Casimir free energy and pressure of magnetic metal films,\nwhich are free-standing in vacuum, sandwiched between two dielectric plates,\nand deposited on either nonmagnetic or magnetic metallic plates. All\ncalculations are performed using both the Drude and plasma model approaches to\nthe Lifshitz theory. According to our results, the Casimir free energies and\npressures calculated using both theoretical approaches are significantly\ndifferent in the magnitude and sign even for thin films of several tens of\nnanometers thickness. Thus, for the Ni film of 47\\,nm thickness deposited on a\nFe plate the obtained magnitudes of the Casimir free energy differ by the\nfactor of 5866. We show that the Casimir free energy and pressure of a magnetic\nfilm calculated using the plasma model approach do not possess the classical\nlimit, but exponentially fast drop to zero with increasing film thickness. If\nthe Drude model approach is used, the classical limit is reached for magnetic\nfilms of about 150\\,nm thickness, but the Casimir free energy remains nonzero\nin the limit of ideal metal, contrary to expectations. For the plasma model\napproach the Casimir free energy of a film vanishes in this case. Numerical\ncomputations are performed for the magnetic films made of Ni, nonmagnetic\nplates made of Cu and Al, and magnetic plates made of Fe using the tabulated\noptical data for the complex indexes of refraction of all metals. The obtained\nresults can be used for a discrimination between the plasma and Drude model\napproaches in the Casimir physics and in the investigation of stability of thin\nfilms.\n", "  The analytical solution of the modified radial Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for\nthe Hulth\\'en potential is obtained within ordinary quantum mechanics by\napplying the Nikiforov-Uvarov method and supersymmetric quantum mechanics by\napplying the shape invariance consept that was introduced by Gendenshtein\nmethod by using the improved approximation scheme to the centrifugal potential\nfor arbitrary $l$ states. The energy levels are worked out and the\ncorresponding normalized eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of orthogonal\npolynomials for arbitrary $l$ states.\n", "  We give a solution to the classical master equation of D=11 supergravity in\nthe conventional component formulation. Based on a careful investigation of the\nsymmetry algebra including terms proportional to the equation of motion, we\nconstruct an explicit expression of the master action in an order-by-order\nmanner.\n", "  Quantum systems with variables in ${\\mathbb Z}(d)$ are considered, and three\ndifferent structures are studied. The first is weak mutually unbiased bases,\nfor which the absolute value of the overlap of any two vectors in two different\nbases is $1/\\sqrt{k}$ (where $k|d$) or $0$. The second is maximal lines through\nthe origin in the ${\\mathbb Z}(d)\\times {\\mathbb Z}(d)$ phase space. The third\nis an analytic representation in the complex plane based on Theta functions,\nand their zeros. It is shown that there is a correspondence (triality) that\nlinks strongly these three apparently different structures. For simplicity, the\ncase where $d=p_1\\times p_2$, where $p_1,p_2$ are odd prime numbers different\nfrom each other, is considered.\n", "  C and O isotopic ratios are reported for a sample of 46 Mira and SRa-type\nvariable AGB stars. Vibration-rotation 1st and 2nd overtone CO lines in 1.5 to\n2.5 $\\mu$m spectra were measured to derive isotopic ratios for 12C/13C,\n16O/17O, and 16O/18O. Comparisons with previous measurements for individual\nstars and with various samples of evolved stars are discussed. Models for solar\ncomposition AGB stars of different initial masses are used to interpret our\nresults. We find that the majority of the M stars had main sequence masses < 2\nMsun and have not experienced sizable third dredge-up episodes. The progenitors\nof the four S-type stars in our sample are slightly more massive. Of the 6 C\nstars in the sample three have clear evidence relating their origin to the\noccurrence of the third dredge-up. Comparisons with O-rich presolar grains from\nAGB stars that lived before the formation of the solar system reveal variations\nin the interstellar medium chemical composition. The present generation of\nlow-mass AGB stars show a large spread of 16O/17O ratios, similar to that of\ngroup 1 presolar grains and in agreement with theoretical expectations for the\ncomposition of mass 1.2 to 2 Msun stars after the 1st dredge up. On the\ncontrary, the 16O/18O ratios of present-day LPVs are definitely smaller than\nthose of group 1 grains. This occurrence is most probably a consequence of the\nthe decrease with time of the 16O/18O ratio in the interstellar medium due to\nthe chemical evolution of the Milky Way. One star in our sample has an O\ncomposition similar to that of group 2 presolar grains originating in an AGB\nstar undergoing extramixing. This occurrence may indicate that the extramixing\nprocess is hampered at high metallicity or, equivalently, favored at low\nmetallicity. Similar to O-rich grains no star in our sample shows evidence of\nHBB, expected for massive AGB stars.\n", "  We present radial velocities and chemical abundances for red giant branch\nstars in the Galactic bulge globular clusters NGC 6342 and NGC 6366. The\nvelocities and abundances are based on measurements of high resolution (R >\n20,000) spectra obtained with the MMT-Hectochelle and WIYN-Hydra spectrographs.\nWe find that NGC 6342 has a heliocentric radial velocity of +112.5 km/s (sigma\n= 8.6 km/s), NGC 6366 has a heliocentric radial velocity of -122.3 km/s (sigma\n= 1.5 km/s), and that both clusters have nearly identical metallicities ([Fe/H]\n~ -0.55). NGC 6366 shows evidence of a moderately extended O-Na\nanti-correlation, but more data are needed for NGC 6342 to determine if this\ncluster also exhibits the typical O-Na relation likely found in all other\nGalactic globular clusters. The two clusters are distinguished from similar\nmetallicity field stars as having larger [Na/Fe] spreads and enhanced [La/Fe]\nratios, but we find that NGC 6342 and NGC 6366 display alpha and Fe-peak\nelement abundance patterns that are typical of other metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1)\ninner Galaxy clusters. However, the median [La/Fe] abundance may vary from\ncluster-to-cluster.\n", "  The Polarized Electrons for Polarized Positrons experiment at the injector of\nthe Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility has demonstrated for the\nfirst time the efficient transfer of polarization from electrons to positrons\nproduced by the polarized bremsstrahlung radiation induced by a polarized\nelectron beam in a high-$Z$ target. Positron polarization up to 82\\% have been\nmeasured for an initial electron beam momentum of 8.19~MeV/$c$, limited only by\nthe electron beam polarization. This technique extends polarized positron\ncapabilities from GeV to MeV electron beams, and opens access to polarized\npositron beam physics to a wide community.\n", "  The interplay between black holes and fundamental fields has attracted much\nattention over the years from both physicists and mathematicians. In this paper\nwe study {\\it analytically} a physical system which is composed of massive\nscalar fields linearly coupled to a rapidly-rotating Kerr black hole. Using\nsimple arguments, we first show that the coupled black-hole-scalar-field system\nmay possess stationary bound-state resonances (stationary scalar `clouds') in\nthe bounded regime $1<\\mu/m\\Omega_{\\text{H}}<\\sqrt{2}$, where $\\mu$ and $m$ are\nrespectively the mass and azimuthal harmonic index of the field, and\n$\\Omega_{\\text{H}}$ is the angular velocity of the black-hole horizon. We then\nshow explicitly that these two bounds on the dimensionless ratio\n$\\mu/m\\Omega_{\\text{H}}$ can be saturated in the asymptotic $m\\to\\infty$ limit.\nIn particular, we derive a remarkably simple analytical formula for the\nresonance mass spectrum of the stationary bound-state scalar clouds in the\nregime $M\\mu\\gg1$ of large field masses: $\\mu_n = \\sqrt{2}m \\Omega_{\\text{H}}\n\\big[1-{{\\pi({\\cal R}+n)} \\over {m|\\ln\\tau|}}\\big]$, where $\\tau$ is the\ndimensionless temperature of the rapidly-rotating (near-extremal) black hole,\n${\\cal R}<1$ is a constant, and $n=0,1,2,...$ is the resonance parameter. In\naddition, it is shown that, contrary to the flat-space intuition, the effective\nlengths of the scalar field configurations in the curved black-hole spacetime\napproach a {\\it finite} asymptotic value in the large mass $M\\mu\\gg1$ limit. In\nparticular, we prove that in the large mass limit, the characteristic length\nscale of the scalar clouds scales linearly with the black-hole temperature.\n", "  By pumping thulium-doped silica-based fibers at 1.07~\\mu m, rapid generation\nof absorbing centers leads to photo-induced attenuation (PIA). This detrimental\neffect prevents exploiting laser emissions in the visible and near infrared. We\nreport on the characterization of the PIA versus the fiber core composition,\nparticularly the concentration of thulium (Tm), lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce)\nions. We show that UV emision induced by Tm-Tm energy transfers is the source\nof photo-darkening, and that lanthanum and cerium are efficient hardeners\nagainst PIA.\n", "  We present the results of simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric\nobservations of the cataclysmic variable star (hereafter CVs) V455 Andromedae,\nbelonging to the WZ Sge sub-class, in quiescence. Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows\nthat two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the\nradiation of the \"hot line\" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,\nlocated approximately at the orbital phases $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.75$; the\namplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four \"superhumps\"\nshifting over the light curve with the precessional period. These two effects,\nwhen overlapping, change the shape of the light curves, shift the hump maxima,\nand they sometimes produce more than two humps in the light curve. We should\nemphasize that when saying \"superhumps\" we imply an effect that is observed in\nquiescent light curves of WZ Sge stars, as opposed to \"classical\" superhumps\nusually observed in outbursts.\n", "  The first results of the construction of a 3D reddening map for stars within\n1600 pc of the Sun are presented. Analysis of the distribution of 70 million\nstars from the 2MASS catalog with the most accurate photometry on the (J-Ks) -\nKs diagram supplemented with Monte Carlo simulations has shown that one of the\nmaxima of this distribution corresponds to F-type dwarfs and subgiants with a\nmean absolute magnitude MKs=2.5m. The shift of this maximum toward large (J-Ks)\nwith increasing $Ks$ reflects the reddening of these stars with increasing\nheliocentric distance. The distribution of the sample of stars over Ks, l, and\nb cells with corresponds to their distribution over 3D spatial cells. As a\nresult, the reddening E(J-Ks) has been determined with an accuracy of 0.03m for\nspatial cells with a side of 100 pc. All of the known large absorbing clouds\nwithin 1600 pc of the Sun have manifested themselves in the results obtained.\nThe distances to the near and far edges of the clouds have been determined with\na relative accuracy of 15\\%. The cases where unknown clouds are hidden behind\nknown ones on the same line of sight have been found. The distance dependence\nof reddening is considered for various Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The\nabsorbing matter of the Gould Belt is shown to manifest itself at latitudes up\nto 40 deg and within 600 pc of the Sun. The size and influence of the Gould\nBelt may have been underestimated thus far. The absorbing matter at latitudes\nup to 60 deg and within 1600 pc of the Sun has been found to be distributed\npredominantly in the first and second quadrants in S hemisphere and in the\nthird and fourth quadrants in N hemisphere. A nonrandom orientation of the\nclouds relative to the Sun is possible. The mass of the baryonic dark matter in\nsolar neighborhoods can then be considerably larger than is generally believed.\n", "  Based on multicolor photometry from the 2MASS and Tycho-2 catalogues, we have\nproduced a sample of 38 368 branch red giants that has less than 1\\% of\nadmixtures and is complete within 500 pc of the Sun. The sample includes 30 671\nK giants, 7544 M giants, 49 C giants, and 104 suspected supergiants or S stars.\nThe photometric distances have been calculated for K, M, and C stars with an\naccuracy of 40\\%. Tycho-2 proper motions and PCRV radial velocities are used to\nanalyze the stellar kinematics. The decrease in the stellar distribution\ndensity with distance from the Galactic equator approximated by the barometric\nlaw, contrary to the Besancon model of the Galaxy, and the kinematic parameters\ncalculated using the Ogorodnikov--Milne model characterize the overwhelming\nmajority of the selected K and M giants as disk stars with ages of more than 3\nGyr. A small number of K and M giants are extremely young or, conversely,\nthick-disk ones. The latter show a nonuniform distribution in the phase space\nof coordinates and velocities, arguing against isothermality and full\nrelaxation of the disk and for the theory of dynamical streams or\nsuperclusters. The spatial distribution and kinematics of the selected C stars\nforce us to consider them as asymptotic branch giants with masses of more than\n2 $M_{\\odot}$ and ages of less than 2 Gyr probably associated with the Gould\nBelt. The offset of the Sun above the Galactic equator has been found from the\ndistribution of stars to be $13\\pm2$ pc, which coincides with the previously\nobtained value for the clump red giants.\n", "  The Tycho-2 proper motions and Tycho-2 and 2MASS photometry are used to\nselect 97348 red giant clump (RGC) stars. The interstellar extinction and\nphotometric distance are calculated for each of the stars. The selected stars\nare shown to form a selection-unbiased sample of RGC stars within about 350 pc\nof the Sun with the addition of more distant stars. The distribution of the\nselected stars in space and their motion are consistent with the assumption\nthat the RGC contains Galactic disk stars with various ages and metallicities,\nincluding a significant fraction of stars younger than 1 Gyr with masses of\nmore than 2 $M_{\\odot}$. These young stars show differences of their\nstatistical characteristics from those of older RGC stars, including\ndifferences in the variations of their distribution density with distance from\nthe Galactic plane and in the dispersion of their velocities found using radial\nvelocities and proper motions. The Sun has been found to rise above the\nGalactic plane by $13\\pm1$ pc. The distribution density of the stars under\nconsideration in space is probably determined by the Local Spiral Arm and the\ndistribution of absorbing matter in the plane of the Gould Belt.\n", "  An old branch of mathematics, Topology, has opened the road to the discovery\nof new phases of matter. A hidden topology in the energy spectrum is the key\nfor novel conducting/insulating properties of topological matter.\n", "  The first-principle method of mathematical modeling was used to calculate the\nstructural, electronic, phonon, and other characteristics of the normal\nmetallic phase of hydrogen at a pressure of 500 GPa. It has been shown that\nmetal hydrogen having a lattice symmetry I41 / AMD cell is a stable phase under\na high pressure hydrostatic compression. The resulting structure is a locally\nstable one with respect to the phonon spectrum.\n", "  Scalar particles $S$ which are gauge singlets under the Standard Model are\ngeneric features of many models of fundamental physics, in particular as\npossible mediators to a hidden or dark sector. We show that the decay $S\\to Zh$\nprovides a powerful probe of the CP nature of the scalar, because it is allowed\nonly if $S$ has CP-odd interactions. We perform a model-independent analysis of\nthis decay in the context of an effective Lagrangian and compute the relevant\nWilson coefficients arising from integrating out heavy fermions to one-loop\norder. We illustrate our findings with the example of the 750 GeV diphoton\nresonance seen by ATLAS and CMS and show that the $S\\to Zh$ decay rate could\nnaturally be of similar magnitude or larger than the diphoton rate.\n", "  In this PhD thesis, we investigate generic features of inflation which are\nstrictly related to fundamental aspects of UV-physics scenarios, such as string\ntheory or supergravity. After a short introduction to standard and inflationary\ncosmology, we present our research findings. On the one hand, we show that\nfocusing on universality properties of inflation can yield surprisingly\nstringent bounds on its dynamics. This approach allows us to identify the\nregime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index. Then, we derive a novel\nfield-range bound, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the original\none derived by Lyth. On the other hand, we discuss the embedding of inflation\nin supergravity and prove that non-trivial hyperbolic K\\\"ahler geometries\ninduce an attractor for the inflationary observables: the spectral tilt tends\nautomatically to the center of the Planck dome whereas the amount of primordial\ngravitational waves is directly controlled by curvature of the internal\nmanifold. We identify the origin of this attractor mechanism in the so-called\n$\\alpha$-scale supergravity model. Finally, we show how the inclusion of a\nnilpotent sector, allowing for a unified description of inflation and dark\nenergy, implies an enhancement of the attractor nature of the theory. The main\nresults of this thesis have been already published elsewhere. However, here we\npay special attention to present them in a comprehensive way and provide the\nreader with the necessary background.\n", "  Recent findings showed that users on Facebook tend to select information that\nadhere to their system of beliefs and to form polarized groups -- i.e., echo\nchambers. Such a tendency dominates information cascades and might affect\npublic debates on social relevant issues. In this work we explore the\nstructural evolution of communities of interest by accounting for users\nemotions and engagement. Focusing on the Facebook pages reporting on scientific\nand conspiracy content, we characterize the evolution of the size of the two\ncommunities by fitting daily resolution data with three growth models -- i.e.\nthe Gompertz model, the Logistic model, and the Log-logistic model. Then, we\nexplore the interplay between emotional state and engagement of users in the\ngroup dynamics. Our findings show that communities' emotional behavior is\naffected by the users' involvement inside the echo chamber. Indeed, to an\nhigher involvement corresponds a more negative approach. Moreover, we observe\nthat, on average, more active users show a faster shift towards the negativity\nthan less active ones.\n", "  A comparative study of the radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations\nin the high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure two dimensional electron\nsystem (2DES) under linearly- and circularlypolarized microwave excitation\nindicates a profound difference in the response observed upon rotating the\nmicrowave launcher for the two cases, although circularly polarized microwave\nradiation induced magnetoresistance oscillations observed at low magnetic\nfields are similar to the oscillations observed with linearly polarized\nradiation. For the linearly polarized radiation, the magnetoresistive response\nis a strong sinusoidal function of the launcher rotation (or linear\npolarization) angle, {\\theta}. For circularly polarized radiation, the\noscillatory magnetoresistive response is hardly sensitive to {\\theta}.\n", "  We consider dynamo action driven by three-dimensional rotating anelastic\nconvection in a spherical shell. Motivated by the behaviour of the solar\ndynamo, we examine the interaction of hydromagnetic modes with different\nsymmetries and demonstrate how complicated interactions between convection,\ndifferential rotation and magnetic fields may lead to modulation of the basic\ncycle. For some parameters, Type 1 modulation occurs by the transfer of energy\nbetween modes of different symmetries with little change in the overall\namplitude, for other parameters, the modulation is of Type 2, where the\namplitude is significantly affected (leading to grand minima in activity)\nwithout significant changes in symmetry. Most importantly, we identify the\npresence of \"supermodulation\" in the solutions, where the activity switches\nchaotically between Type 1 and Type 2 modulation, this is believed to be an\nimportant process in solar activity.\n", "  Quantum dots patterned by atomically precise placement of phosphorus donors\nin single crystal silicon have long spin lifetimes, advantages in\naddressability, large exchange tunability, and are readily available\nfew-electron systems. To be utilized as quantum bits, it is important to\nnon-invasively characterise these donor quantum dots post fabrication and\nextract the number of bound electron and nuclear spins as well as their\nlocations. Here, we propose a metrology technique based on electron spin\nresonance (ESR) measurements with the on-chip circuitry already needed for\nqubit manipulation to obtain atomic scale information about donor quantum dots\nand their spin configurations. Using atomistic tight-binding technique and\nHartree self-consistent field approximation, we show that the ESR transition\nfrequencies are directly related to the number of donors, electrons, and their\nlocations through the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction.\n", "  Chemical functionalization is an effective means to tune electronic and\ncrystal structure of two-dimensional material, which may be crucial for moder\nmicroelectronics industry. Based on the first-principle calculation and an\niterative solution of Boltzmann transport equation, we find that antimony films\nare potential excellent thermoelectrical materials with rather low thermal\nconductivities $k$ ($<$ 2.5 W/mK). The chemical functionalization can induce\nthe reduction in $k$ to some extent, which is mainly due to the reduction of\nphonon lifetimes limited by the anharmonic scattering. More interesting, the\norigin of the reduction in $k$ is not the anharmonic interaction but the\nharmonic interaction from the depressed phonon spectrum mechanism, and for some\nchemical functional atom in halogen, the flat modes appearing in the low\nfrequency range play also a key factor in the reduction of $k$ by significantly\nincreasing the three-phonon scattering channels. Our work analyzes the\nreduction mechanism in $k$ from the chemical functionalization for antimonene,\nand provides a new view to adjust the thermal conductivity which can benefit\nthermoelectric material design.\n", "  It is well established that the occurrence of superconductivity in iron\npnictides is closely related to the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural and\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transitions. It, however, has not been clear\nwhether the same scenario is appropriate for iron chalcogenide counterparts due\nto the absence of parent compounds for the latter family of superconductors.\nHere, we report the synthesis and structure determination of two novel phases\nin ethylenediamine intercalated FeSe, one is tetragonal and the other\northorhombic in room temperature, which can be stabilized with neutral spacer\nlayers. Both phases can be regarded as the parent compounds for\nsuperconductivity as they are non-superconducting (non-SC) in pristine form and\nsuperconducting (SC) with Tc up to 38K and 46K, respectively after Na doping,\nand the switch between SC and no-SC is reversible. Moreover, the two non-SC\nparent compounds show no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 2K,\nonly with dynamic spin fluctuations at low temperatures, suggesting that no\ncompetition between SC and AFM ordering. Our results reveal that undoped iron\nselenides are quantum paramagnetic in ground state, implying that they are\ndistinct from their pnictide counterparts in pairing mechanism.\n", "  An approach for constructing a low-dissipation numerical method is described.\nThe method is based on a combination of the operator-splitting method, Godunov\nmethod, and piecewise-parabolic method on the local stencil. Numerical method\nwas tested on a standard suite of hydrodynamic test problems. In addition, the\nperformance of the method is demonstrated on a global test problem showing the\ndevelopment of a spiral structure in a gravitationally unstable gaseous\ngalactic disk.\n", "  We present here the thermoelectric properties of olivine-type Fe2GeCh4 (Ch =\nS, Se and Te) using the linear augmented plane wave method based on first\nprinciples density functional calculations. The calculated transport properties\nusing the semi-local Boltzmann transport equation reveal very high thermopower\nfor both S and Se-based compounds compared to their Te counterparts. The main\nreason for this high thermopower is the quasi-flat nature of the bands at the\nvalence and conduction band edges. The calculated thermopower of Fe2GeCh4 is in\ngood agreement with the experimental reports at room temperature, with the\ncarrier concentration around 1018-1019cm-3. All the investigated systems show\nan anisotropic nature in their electrical conductivity, resulting in a value\nless than the order of 102 along the a-axis compared to the b- and c-axes.\nAmong the studied compounds, Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4 emerge as promising\ncandidates with good thermoelectric performance.\n", "  For future on-chip communication schemes, it is essential to integrate\nnanoscale materials with an ultrafast optoelectronic functionality into\nhigh-frequency circuits. The atomically thin graphene has been widely\ndemonstrated to be suitable for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices because\nof its broadband optical absorption and its high electron mobility. Moreover,\nthe ultrafast relaxation of photogenerated charge carriers has been verified in\ngraphene. Here, we show that dual-gated graphene junctions can be functional\nparts of THz-circuits. As the underlying optoelectronic process, we exploit\nultrafast photo-thermoelectric currents. We describe an immediate\nphoto-thermoelectric current of the unbiased device following a femtosecond\nlaser excitation. For a picosecond time-scale after the optical excitation, an\nadditional photo-thermoelectric contribution shows up, which exhibits the\nfingerprint of a spatially inverted temperature profile. The latter can be\nunderstood by the different time-constants and thermal coupling mechanisms of\nthe electron and phonon baths within graphene to the substrate and the metal\ncontacts. The interplay of the processes gives rise to ultrafast\nelectromagnetic transients in high-frequency circuits, and it is equally\nimportant for a fundamental understanding of graphene-based ultrafast\nphotodetectors and switches.\n", "  We combine experiments, theory and numerical simulation to investigate the\ndynamics of a binary suspension of paramagnetic colloidal particles dispersed\nin water and transported above a stripe patterned magnetic garnet film. The\nsubstrate generates a one-dimensional periodic energy landscape above its\nsurface. The application of an elliptically polarized rotating magnetic field\ncauses the landscape to translate, inducing direct transport of paramagnetic\nparticles placed above the film. The ellipticity of the applied field can be\nused to control and tune the interparticle interactions, from net repulsive to\nnet attractive. When considering particles of two distinct sizes, we find that,\ndepending on their elevation above the surface of the magnetic substrate, the\nparticles feel effectively different potentials, resulting in different\nmobilities. We exploit this feature to induce selective chaining for certain\nvalues of the applied field parameters. In particular, when driving two types\nof particles, we force only one type to condense into travelling parallel\nchains. These chains confine the movement of the other non-chaining particles\nwithin narrow colloidal channels. This phenomenon is explained by considering\nthe balance of pairwise magnetic forces between the particles and their\nindividual coupling with the travelling landscape.\n", "  We revisit the issue of uplifting the potential to de Sitter (dS) vacua in\ntype IIB flux compactifications of Kachru, Kallosh, Linde and Trivedi (KKLT).\nWe shed light on some tension between two constraints on dS vacua in type IIB\nstring theory. One is the well-known and much-discussed constraint which leads\nto the no-go theorem that can in principle be evaded. The other follows from\n4-dimensional Einstein's equations, which has, however, been much less\ndiscussed in connection with the former constraint. In addition to the\nchallenges previously posed, it is suggested that the uplifting scenarios, in\nparticular, obstruct the evasion of the no-go theorem more strongly than one\nmight have assumed.\n", "  A new pure quantum state, isotropic in spin variables, is defined in an\nextended spin phase space beyond standard quantum mechanics. It allows to\nrepresent the entangled singlet state in separable form. The statistical\ncorrelations between Alice and Bob measurements become self correlations\nbetween hidden spin values for each particle, together with perfect anti\ncorrelation between spin values on the pair. Alice determines through\nmeasurement on her particle the value of spin in some direction. Spin in\nanother direction is inferred from Bob measurement on the companion. Bell's\ninequalities are violated because of the wave like behaviour of quantum\nsystems. In full analogy with the two slit experiment, interference terms\nbetween spin field components appear determining the contextual character of\nquantum distributions of probability.\n", "  I summarize the theory talks presented at the 50 year anniversary conference.\nThe talks covered a wide range of topics, but common threads included\nnext-to-next-to-leading order predictions for many 2 -> 2 processes, beyond QCD\nlattice simulations, work on the set of persistent flavor physics anomalies,\nand discussions of the significance and possible explanations of the diphoton\nexcess at 750 GeV.\n", "  Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a fascinating topic in theoretical physics, because\nof its unique and counterintuitive properties. It is expected to emerge as new\nphysics beyond the standard model, and it is also a building block for\nsupergravity and superstring theory. A number of exact results obtained via\nSUSY theories provide insights into field theory. However, the dynamics of many\nSUSY theories are not yet fully understood, and numerical study of SUSY\ntheories through lattice simulations is promising as regards furthering this\nunderstanding. In this paper, I overview the current status of lattice SUSY by\ndiscussing its development in chronological order, and by reviewing some simple\nmodels. In addition, I discuss the numerical verification of gauge/gravity\nduality, which is one of the recent significant developments in this field.\n", "  The central regions of galaxies show the presence of super massive black\nholes and/or very dense stellar clusters. Both objects seem to follow similar\nhost-galaxy correlations, suggesting that they are members of the same family\nof Compact Massive Objects. We investigate here a huge data collection of\nCompact Massive Objects properties to correlate them with absolute magnitude,\nvelocity dispersion and mass of their host galaxies.\n", "  We discuss the well-known phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking for a\nlinear sigma model for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons based on the meson\ncomposite structure and the normalization of the quantum states. To test our\nformulation and validate our approach we give another proof of the Goldstone\ntheorem and derive the corresponding mass eigenstates of the theory. We briefly\ndescribe the possible wave function of a meson that leads to the adequate mass\neigenstates.\n", "  The simplest building blocks for quantum computations are the qbit-qbit\nquantum channels. In this paper we analyse the structure of these channels via\ntheir Choi representation. The restriction of a quantum channel to the space of\nclassical states (i.e. probability distributions) is called the underlying\nclassical channel. The structure of quantum channels over a fixed classical\nchannel is studied, the volume of general and unital qubit channels over real\nand complex state spaces with respect to the Lebesgue measure is computed and\nexplicit formulas are presented for the distribution of the volume of quantum\nchannels over given classical channels. Moreover an algorithm is presented to\ngenerate uniformly distributed channels with respect to the Lebesgue measure,\nwhich enables further studies. With this algorithm the distribution of\ntrace-distance contraction coefficient (Dobrushin) is investigated numerically\nby Monte-Carlo simulations, which leads to some conjectures and points out the\nstrange behaviour of the real state space.\n", "  We consider $G_2$ structures with torsion coupled with $G_2$-instantons, on a\ncompact $7$-dimensional manifold. The coupling is via an equation for $4$-forms\nwhich appears in supergravity and generalized geometry, known as the Bianchi\nidentity. The resulting system of partial differential equations can be\nregarded as an analogue of the Strominger system in $7$-dimensions. We initiate\nthe study of the moduli space of solutions and show that it is finite\ndimensional using elliptic operator theory. We also relate the associated\ngeometric structures to generalized geometry.\n", "  The use of variational nuclear motion programs to compute line lists of\ntransition frequencies and intensities is now a standard procedure. The ExoMol\nproject has used this technique to generate line lists for studies of hot\nbodies such as the atmospheres of exoplanets and cool stars. The resulting line\nlist can be huge: many contain 10 billion or more transitions. This software\nupdate considers changes made to our programs during the course of the project\nto allow for such calculations. This update considers three programs: {\\sc Duo}\nwhich computed vibronic spectra for diatomics, {\\sc DVR3D} which computes\nrotation-vibration spectra for triatomics, and {\\sc TROVE} which computes\nrotation-vibration spectra for general polyatomic systems. Important updates in\nfunctionality include the calculation of quasibound (resonance) states and\nLand\\'e $g$-factors by {\\sc Duo} and the calculation of resonance states by\n{\\sc DVR3D}. Significant algorithmic improvements are reported for both {\\sc\nDVR3D} and {\\sc TROVE}. All three programs are publically available from\nccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk. Future developments are also considered.\n", "  Using 10 monopole antennas reaching into a rectangular multi mode waveguide\nwe shape the incident wave to create specific transport even after scattering\nevents. Each antenna is attached to an IQ-Modulator, which allows the\nadjustment of the amplitude and phase in a broad band range of 6-18 GHz. All of\nthem are placed in the near field of the other, thus the excitation of an\nindividual antenna is influenced by the presence of the other antennas. Still\nthese 10 antennas are sufficient to generate any combination of the 10\npropagating modes in the far field. At the output the propagating modes are\nextracted using a movable monopole antenna that is scanning the field. If the\nmodes are scattered in a scattering region, the incident wave can be adjusted\nin such a way, that the outgoing wave can still be adjusted as long as\nlocalization is not present.\n", "  The measurement of weak temporal phase for picosecond and nanosecond laser\npulses is important but quite difficult. We propose a simple iterative\nalgorithm, which is based on a temporally movable phase modulation process, to\nretrieve the weak temporal phase of laser pulses. This unambiguous method can\nachieve a high accuracy and simultaneously measure the weak temporal phase and\ntemporal profile of pulses, which are almost transform-limited. Detailed\nanalysis shows that this iterative method has valuable potential applications\nin the characterization of pulses with weak temporal phase.\n", "  A set of constructs, definitions, and propositions that present a systematic\nview of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), i.e. how the\ninfluence of higher energy processes is localizable in a few structural\nproperties which can be captured by a handful of Wilson coefficients.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to obtain\nsolutions of Hamiltonian systems in Classical Mechanics, that are either\ncompatible with a cosymplectic or a contact structure. As it is well known, the\nfirst structure plays a central role in the theory of time-dependent\nHamiltonians, whilst the second is here used to treat classical Hamiltonians\nincluding dissipation terms.\n  On the other hand, the interest of a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi equation is\nthe primordial observation that a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be\nprojected into the configuration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the\nintegral curves of the projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$can be transformed\ninto integral curves of $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the\nHamilton--Jacobi equation.\n  In this way, we use the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to derive solutions\nof physical systems with a Hamiltonian formulation. A new expression for a\ngeometric Hamilton Jacobi equation is obtained for time dependent Hamiltonians\ndescribed with the aid of a cosymplectic structure. Then, another expression\nfor the Hamilton Jacobi equation is retrieved for Hamiltonians with frictional\nterms described through contact geometry. Both approaches shall be applied to\nphysical examples.\n", "  Stochastic systems characterised by a random driving in a form of the general\nstable noise are considered. The particle experiences long rests due to the\ntraps the density of which is position-dependent and obeys a power-law form\nattributed to the underlying self-similar structure. Both one and two\ndimensional case are analysed. The random walk description involves a\nposition-dependent waiting time distribution. On the other hand, the stochastic\ndynamics is formulated in terms of the subordination technique where the random\ntime generator is position-dependent. The first passage time problem is\naddressed by evaluating a first passage time density distribution and an escape\nrate. The influence of the medium nonhomogeneity on those quantities is\ndemonstrated; moreover, the dependence of the escape rate on the stability\nindex and the memory parameter is evaluated. Results indicate essential\ndifferences between the Gaussian case and the case involving Levy flights.\n", "  We introduce a heterogeneous network structure into the Bass diffusion model,\nin order to study the diffusion times of innovation or information in networks\nwith a scale-free structure, typical of regions where diffusion is sensitive to\ngeographic and logistic influences (like for instance Alpine regions). We\nconsider both the diffusion peak times of the total population and of the link\nclasses. In the familiar trickle-down processes the adoption curve of the hubs\nis found to anticipate the total adoption in a predictable way. In a major\ndeparture from the standard model, we model a trickle-up process by introducing\nheterogeneous publicity coefficients (which can also be negative for the hubs,\nthus turning them into stiflers) and a stochastic term which represents the\nerratic generation of innovation at the periphery of the network. The results\nconfirm the robustness of the Bass model and expand considerably its range of\napplicability.\n", "  One the base of Maxwell and Dirac equations the one biquaternionic model of\nelectro-gravimagnetic (EGM) fields is considered. The closed system of\nbiquaternionic wave equations is constructed for determination of free system\nof electric and gravimagnetic charges and currents and generated by them\nEGM-field. By using generalized functions theory the fundamental and regular\nsolutions of this system are determined and some of them are considered\n(spinors, plane waves, shock EGMwaves and others). The properties of these\nsolutions are investigated.\n", "  We applied a mean-field approach associated to Monte Carlo simulations in\norder to study the spin-1 ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model in the square and the\nlinear lattice. This new technique, which we call MFT-MC, determines the\nmolecular field as the magnetization response of a Monte Carlo simulation. The\nresulting phase diagram is qualitatively correct, in contrast to\neffective-field approximations, in which the first-order line is not\nperpendicular to the anisotropy axis at low temperatures. Thermodynamic\nquantities, as the entropy and the specific heat curves can be obtained so as\nto analyze the nature of the phase transition points. Also, the possibility of\nusing larger sizes constitutes an improvement regarding other mean-field\napproximations that use clusters.\n", "  The activity levels of the solar-twin candidates HD 101364 and HD 197027 are\nmeasured and compared with the Sun, the known solar twin 18 Sco, and the\nsolar-like star 51 Peg. Furthermore, the absolute ages of these five objects\nare estimated from their positions in the HR diagram and the evolutionary\n(relative) age compared with their activity levels. To represent the activity\nlevel of these stars, the Mount Wilson S-indices were used. To obtain\nconsistent ages and evolutionary advance on the main sequence, we used\nevolutionary tracks calculated with the Cambridge Stellar Evolution Code. From\nour spectroscopic observations of HD 101364 and HD 197027 and based on the\nestablished calibration procedures, the respective Mount Wilson S-indices are\ndetermined. We find that the chromospheric activity of both stars is comparable\nwith the present activity level of the Sun and that of 18 Sco, at least for the\nperiod in consideration. Furthermore, the absolute age of HD 101364, HD 197027,\n51 Peg, and 18 Sco are found to be 7.2, 7.1, 6.1, and 5.1 Gyr, respectively.\nWith the exception of 51 Peg, which has a significantly higher metallicity and\na mass higher by about 10% than the Sun, the present Sun and its twins compare\nrelatively well in their activity levels, even though the other twins are\nsomewhat older. Even though 51 Peg has a similar age of 6.1 Gyr, this star is\nsignificantly less active. Only when we compare it on a relative age scale\n(which is about 20% shorter for 51 Peg than for the Sun in absolute terms) and\nuse the higher-than-present long-term S$_{\\rm{MWO}}$ average of 0.18 for the\nSun, does the S-index show a good correlation with evolutionary (relative) age.\nThis shows that in the search for a suitably similar solar twin, the relative\nmain-sequence age matters for obtaining a comparable activity level.\n", "  By the time icy objects grow to about the mass of Europa and silicate bodies\ngrow to approximately lunar mass, a large high-speed impact can generate an\nintact melt region that allows the dense material to gravitationally segregate,\nforming a large density anomaly. If this anomaly generates sufficient\ndifferential stress, it rapidly segregates to the object's center, triggering\nwhole body differentiation. We used an impact melting model based on the\nHugoniot equations, the linear shock-particle velocity relationship, and the\nempirical relationship between shock pressure and distance coupled with a Monte\nCarlo simulation of the late accretion process to determine conditions under\nwhich large impacts trigger differentiation in icy bodies. In a gas-free\nenvironment, impacts of projectiles in the satellite's accretion zone have a\nsmall probability of triggering differentiation in surviving proto-satellites\nas small as Triton. The probability increases to 100% by the time surviving\nproto-satellites grow to the mass of Europa. The impact of heliocentric\nparticles captured by the central planet also effectively triggers\ndifferentiation in the icy satellites. If the largest projectiles in the\nheliocentric distribution are comparable to the mass of the growing satellites,\nthey trigger differentiation in all surviving proto-satellites by the time they\ngrow to the mass of Callisto. However, Callisto and Ganymede have different\nprobabilities of impact-induced differentiation if they captured a small\nfraction (0.01 and 0.5%) of the particles they accreted from a distribution of\nsmall (largest particles ~10% of the satellite's mass) heliocentric objects.\nImpact induced differentiation explains the apparent difference between these\ntwo objects in a plausible way.\n", "  Gravitational effective action is calculated to second order in transverse\nmomentums for a planar asymptotically anti-de Sitter geometry by gauge fixing\nmethod. The first order bulk energy-momentum tensor is calculated. The zeroth\norder equations of motion are solved and a new black brane-like solution is\nfound. We show that once the contribution of matter quantum modes is taken into\naccount, the horizon of the black brane disappears. This is also correct for\nBTZ black hole. Our result strengthens the black hole non-existence proposal by\nHawking.\n", "  Using the Coulomb Eikonal Phase associated with a transversely polarized\nnucleon, we calculate the azimuthal single spin asymmetry of unpolarized\nelectrons elastically scattered from a transversely polarized nucleon target.\nThe azimuthal asymmetry in this case is attributed to the fact that in a\ntransversely polarized nucleon, the transverse charge density is no longer\naxially symmetric and is distorted due to the transverse spin of the nucleon.\nThis asymmetry in the nucleon charge density causes a left-right asymmetry in\nthe azimuthal distribution of the scattered electrons. In our approach, we\nutilize the relativistic Eikonal approximation to calculate the one and two\nphoton exchange amplitudes from which a non zero azimuthal asymmetry appears\ndue to the interference between the two amplitudes.\n", "  Cellular Automata are discrete--time dynamical systems on a spatially\nextended discrete space which provide paradigmatic examples of nonlinear\nphenomena. Their stochastic generalizations, i.e., Probabilistic Cellular\nAutomata, are discrete time Markov chains on lattice with finite single--cell\nstates whose distinguishing feature is the \\textit{parallel} character of the\nupdating rule. We review some of the results obtained about the metastable\nbehavior of Probabilistic Cellular Automata and we try to point out\ndifficulties and peculiarities with respect to standard Statistical Mechanics\nLattice models.\n", "  Neutrinoless double-beta decay is a predicted beyond Standard Model process\nthat could clarify some of the not yet known neutrino properties, such as the\nmass scale, the mass hierarchy, and its nature as a Dirac or Majorana fermion.\nShould this transition be observed, there are still challenges in understanding\nthe underlying contributing mechanisms. We perform a detailed shell model\ninvestigation of several beyond Standard Model mechanisms that consider the\nexistence of right-handed currents. Our analysis presents different venues that\ncan be used to identify the dominant mechanisms for nuclei of experimental\ninterest in the mass A$\\sim$130 region ($^{124}$Sn, $^{130}$Te, and\n$^{136}$Xe). It requires an accurate knowledge of nine nuclear matrix elements\nthat we calculate, in addition to the associated energy dependent phase-space\nfactors.\n", "  We study the generation of superpositions of N00N states by overlapping\nfew-photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum states and coherent states on a 50/50\nbeam splitter. Assuming parameters that are feasible with current technology\nresults in output states with mean photon numbers of several tens. We show that\nthe generated quantum states violate local realism even in the presence of\nconsiderable loss. The occurrence of strong quantum correlations for mesoscopic\nquantum states of light is particularly beneficial for coupling light and\nmatter quantum systems.\n", "  Asymptotically quadratic potentials $V_{(d]}(x)=d^2-2d\\,|x|+x^2$ are\nconsidered as an elementary one-dimensional interaction model exhibiting a\nsingle-well shape at negative $d=-\\mu<0$ and a double-well shape at positive\n$d=\\nu>0$. The existence of terminating, polynomial {\\it alias\\,} quasi-exact\nbound states is revealed and discussed. All of the $N-$plets of these states\nare constructed in closed form.\n", "  An essential property of magnetic devices is the relaxation rate in magnetic\nswitching which strongly depends on the energy dissipation and magnetic inertia\nof the magnetization dynamics. Both parameters are commonly taken as a\nphenomenological entities. However very recently, a large effort has been\ndedicated to obtain Gilbert damping from first principles. In contrast, there\nis no ab initio study that so far has reproduced measured data of magnetic\ninertia in magnetic materials. In this letter, we present and elaborate on a\ntheoretical model for calculating the magnetic moment of inertia based on the\ntorque-torque correlation model. Particularly, the method has been applied to\nbulk bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni in the framework of the tight-binding\napproximation and the numerical values are comparable with recent experimental\nmeasurements. The theoretical results elucidate the physical origin of the\nmoment of inertia based on the electronic structure. Even though the moment of\ninertia and damping are produced by the spin-orbit coupling, our analysis shows\nthat they are caused by undergo different electronic structure mechanisms.\n", "  The experimental search for the location of the QCD critical point in the\nphase diagram is of primary importance. In a recent publication it is claimed\nthat measurements at RHIC lead not only to the location of the critical point\n($\\mu_{cep}=95$ MeV, $T_{cep}=165$ MeV) but also to the verification of its\nuniversality class ($3d$ Ising system) by extracting the values of the critical\nexponents ($\\gamma=1.2$, $\\nu=0.66$). We argue that this claim is based on an\nerroneous treatment of scaling relations near the critical point. As a result,\nthe correct interpretation of the measurements cannot be linked to the QCD\ncritical point.\n", "  This paper explores the generalization of the concept of a \"probability\ncurrent\", familiar from wave-function quantum mechanics, to quantum systems\nwith finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The generalized definition applies both\nto isolated systems evolving via the Schr\\\"odinger equation and to more general\nopen systems obeying the Lindblad master equation. We establish several\nproperties of the probability current and explore its relation to thermodynamic\nheat and work.\n", "  A self-consistent relativistic two-fluid model is proposed for\none-dimensional electron-ion plasma dynamics. A multiple scales perturbation\ntechnique is employed, leading to an evolution equation for the wave envelope,\nin the form of a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger type equation (NLSE). The inclusion of\nrelativistic effects is shown to introduce density-dependent factors, not\npresent in the non-relativistic case - in the conditions for modulational\ninstability. The role of relativistic effects on the linear dispersion laws and\non envelope soliton solutions of the NLSE is discussed.\n", "  In this comment, we point out some shortcomings in two papers \"Fractional\nquantum mechanics\" [Phys. Rev. E 62, 3135 (2000)] and \"Fractional Schroedinger\nequation\" [Phys. Rev. E 66, 056108 (2002)]. We prove that the fractional\nuncertainty relation does not hold generally. The probability continuity\nequation in fractional quantum mechanics has a missing source term, which leads\nto particle teleportation, i.e., a particle can teleport from one place to\nanother. Since the relativistic kinetic energy can be viewed as an approximate\nrealization of the fractional kinetic energy, the particle teleportation should\nbe an observable relativistic effect in quantum mechanics. With the help of\nthis concept, superconductivity could be viewed as the teleportation of\nelectrons from one side of a superconductor to another and superfluidity could\nbe viewed as the teleportation of helium atoms from one end of a capillary tube\nto the other. We also point out how to teleport a particle to a destination.\n", "  We examine a two-media 2-dimensional fluid system consisting of a lower\nmedium bounded underneath by a flatbed and an upper medium with a free surface\nwith wind generated surface waves but considered bounded above by a lid by an\nassumption that surface waves have negligible amplitude. An internal wave\ndriven by gravity which propagates in the positive $x$-direction acts as a free\ncommon interface between the media. The current is such that it is zero at the\nflatbed but a negative constant, due to an assumption that surface winds blow\nin the negative $x$-direction, at the lid. We are concerned with the layers\nadjacent to the internal wave in which there exists a depth dependent current\nfor which there is a greater underlying than overlying current. Both media are\nconsidered incompressible and having non-zero constant vorticities. The\ngoverning equations are written in canonical Hamiltonian form in terms of the\nvariables, associated to the wave (in a presence of a constant current). The\nresultant equations of motion show that wave-current interaction is influenced\nonly by the current profile in the 'strip' adjacent to the internal wave.\n", "  The extension of the singular perturbative approach to the second order is\npresented in this paper. The general expansion to the second order is derived.\nThe second order expansion is considered as a small correction to the first\norder expansion. Using this approach it is demonstrated that the second order\nexpansion is reducible to a first order expansion via a re-definition of the\nfirst order pertubative fields. Even if in practice the second order correction\nis small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order\nexpansion indicates a degeneracy problem. In general this degeneracy is hard to\nbreak. A useful and simple second order approximation is the thin source\napproximation which offers a direct estimation of the correction. The practical\napplication of the corrections derived in this paper are illustrated by using\nan elliptical NFW lens model. The second order pertubative expansion provides a\nnoticeable improvement, even for the simplest case of thin source\napproximation. To conclude it is clear that for accurate modelisation of\ngravitational lenses using the perturbative method the second order\nperturbative expansion should be considered. In particular an evaluation of the\ndegeneracy due to the second order term should be performed, for which the thin\nsource approximation is particularly useful.\n", "  We investigate optical (transverse gradient) forces between two high-index\ndielectric planar waveguides immersed in low-index dielectric fluid media.\nComplimentary to previous studies, we extend optical forces calculations, in\norder to take into account a non-vacuum (and non-air) background medium, by\nusing the Minkowski stress tensor formulation; we derived a very simple set of\nequations in terms of the effective refractive indexes of the waveguide\neigenmodes. We also used a normalized version of the dispersion relation method\nto calculate the optical forces, in order to validate our results for different\ndielectric fluid media. Excellent agreement between the two methods was\nobtained for all analyzed cases. We show that, due to slot-waveguide effect,\nthe TM modes are more sensitive to changes in the fluid refractive index than\nthe TE ones. Furthermore, the repulsive optical force of the antisymmetric TM1\nmode becomes stronger for higher refractive indexes, whereas the attractive\nforce of the symmetric TM0 mode becomes weaker. The methodology and results\npresented in this work provide a rigorous analysis of nano-optomechanical\ndevices actuated by optical forces in a broader range of materials and\napplications.\n", "  From celestial mechanics to quantum theory of atoms and molecules,\nperturbation theory has played a central role in natural sciences. Particularly\nin quantum mechanics, the amount of information needed for specifying the state\nof a many-body system commonly scales exponentially as the system size. This\nposes a fundamental difficulty in using perturbation theory at arbitrary order.\nAs one computes the terms in the perturbation series at increasingly higher\norders, it is often important to determine whether the series converges and if\nso, what is an accurate estimation of the total error that comes from the next\norder of perturbation up to infinity. Here we present a set of efficient\nalgorithms that compute tight upper bounds to perturbation terms at arbitrary\norder. We argue that these tight bounds often take the form of symmetric\npolynomials on the parameter of the quantum system. We then use cellular\nautomata as our basic model of computation to compute the symmetric polynomials\nthat account for all of the virtual transitions at any given order. At any\nfixed order, the computational cost of our algorithm scales polynomially as a\nfunction of the system size. We present a non-trivial example which shows that\nour error estimation is nearly tight with respect to exact calculation.\n", "  An equation of state of the hard sphere fluid which is not analytical at the\nfreezing density is proposed and tested. The nonanalytical term is based on the\nthe classical nucleation theory and is able to capture the observed ``anomalous\nincrease'' of pressure at high densities. It is combined with the virial\nexpansion at low densities.\n", "  Rotationally resolved infrared spectra are reported for the X-HCN (X = Cl,\nBr, I) binary complexes solvated in helium nanodroplets. These results are\ndirectly compared with that obtained previously for the corresponding X-HF\ncomplexes [J. M. Merritt, J. K\\\"upper, and R. E. Miller, PCCP, 7, 67 (2005)].\nFor bromine and iodine atoms complexed with HCN, two linear structures are\nobserved and assigned to the $^{2}\\Sigma_{1/2}$ and $^{2}\\Pi_{3/2}$ ground\nelectronic states of the nitrogen and hydrogen bound geometries, respectively.\nExperiments for HCN + chlorine atoms give rise to only a single band which is\nattributed to the nitrogen bound isomer. That the hydrogen bound isomer is not\nstabilized is rationalized in terms of a lowering of the isomerization barrier\nby spin-orbit coupling. Theoretical calculations with and without spin-orbit\ncoupling have also been performed and are compared with our experimental\nresults. The possibility of stabilizing high-energy structures containing\nmultiple radicals is discussed, motivated by preliminary spectroscopic evidence\nfor the di-radical Br-HCCCN-Br complex. Spectra for the corresponding molecular\nhalogen HCN-X$_{2}$ complexes are also presented.\n"]}
