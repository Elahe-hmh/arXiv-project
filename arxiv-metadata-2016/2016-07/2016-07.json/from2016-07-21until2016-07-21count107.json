Our results provide firm evidence that\nphonons has negligibly smaller effect on skew scattering contributions to AHE\nresistivity than defects, the overlook of which in conventional scaling laws\nresults in significant discrepancies and exponent n beyond 2 when fitting the\ndata. We find that the broken of long-range chemical ordering strongly affects\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic contributions of AHE conductivity, e.g., it\ngreatly suppresses intrinsic contributions by influencing the topology of the\nband structures. Our results are of great importance for both physical\nunderstanding and technological engineering of the AHE.\n", "  Inertial lift forces are exploited within inertial microfluidic devices to\nposition, segregate, and sort particles or droplets. However the forces and\ntheir focusing positions can currently only be predicted by numerical\nsimulations, making rational device design very difficult. Here we develop\ntheory for the forces on particles in microchannel geometries. We use numerical\nexperiments to dissect the dominant balances within the Navier-Stokes equations\nand derive an asymptotic model to predict the lateral force on the particle as\na function of particle size. Our asymptotic model is valid for a wide array of\nparticle sizes and Reynolds numbers, and allows us to predict how focusing\nposition depends on particle size.\n", "  Quantum field theory in the $4$-dimensional de Sitter space-time is\nconstructed in the ambient space formalism in a rigorous mathematical\nframework. This work is based on the group representation theory and the\nanalyticity of the complexified pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The unitary\nirreducible representations of de Sitter group and their corresponding Hilbert\nspaces are reformulated in the ambient space formalism. Defining the creation\nand annihilation operators, quantum field operators and their corresponding\nanalytic two-point functions for various spin fields have been constructed. The\nvarious spin massless fields can be constructed in terms of the massless\nconformally coupled scalar field in this formalism. Then the quantum massless\nminimally coupled scalar field operator, for the first time, is also\nconstructed on Bunch-Davies vacuum state which preserve the analyticity. We\nshow that the massless fields with $s \\geq 3$ cannot propagate in de Sitter\nambient space formalism. The massless gauge invariant field equations for $s=1,\n\\frac{3}{2}, 2$ are studied. The gauge spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ fields satisfy the\nGrassmannian algebra, and hence provoke one to couple them with the gauge\nspin-$2$ field and the super-algebra is naturally appeared.\n", "  Stochastically driven nonlinear processes limit the number of amplified modes\nin a natural system due to competitive mode interaction, which is accompanied\nby loss of coherence when increasing the complexity of system. Specifically, we\nfind that modulation instability, which exhibits great fluctuations when it is\nspontaneously grown from noise in conservative systems, may possess a high\ndegree of coherence in dissipative laser system with gain. Nonlinear mode\ninteractions can be competitive or cooperative: adjusting the intracavity\npolarization state controls the process of loss of coherence. Single-shot\nspectra reveal that fiber laser redistributes its energy from center wavelength\nmode to sidebands through parametric instabilities, and subsequently\nlongitudinal modes are populated via cascaded four-wave-mixing. Parametric\nfrequency conversion populates longitudinal modes with a random distribution of\nposition, intensity and polarization, resulting in partially (rather than\nhighly) coherent pulses. These dynamics unveil a new route towards complex\npattern formation in nonlinear laser systems.\n", "  We systematically analyze nuclear reaction data that are sensitive to nuclear\nsize, namely, proton-nucleus total reaction cross sections and differential\nelastic cross sections, using a phenomenological black-sphere approximation of\nnuclei that we are developing. In this framework, the radius of the black\nsphere is found to be a useful length scale that simultaneously accounts for\nthe observed proton-nucleus total reaction cross section and first diffraction\npeak in the proton elastic differential cross section. This framework is\nexpected to be applicable to any kind of projectile that is strongly attenuated\nin the nucleus. On the basis of a cross-section formula constructed within this\nframework, we find that a less familiar $A^{1/6}$ dependence plays a crucial\nrole in describing the energy dependence of proton-nucleus total reaction cross\nsections.\n", "  We show that the surface states of pristine 3D topological insulators (TIs)\nare analogs of ferromagnetic half metals due to complete polarization of an\nemergent momentum independent pseudospin (SU(2)) degree of freedom on the\nsurface. To put this claim on firm footing, we present results for TI surfaces\nperpendicular to the crystal growth axis, which clearly show that the tunneling\nconductance between two such TI surfaces of the same TI material is dominated\nby this half metallic behavior leading to physics reminiscent of a spin-valve.\nFurther using the generalized tunnel magnetoresistance derived in this work we\nalso study the tunneling current between arbitrary TI surfaces. We also perform\na comprehensive study of the effect of all possible surface potentials allowed\nby time reversal symmetry on this spin-valve effect and show that it is robust\nagainst most of such potentials.\n", "  We revisit the modeling of the properties of the remnant black hole resulting\nthe merger of a black-hole binary as a function of the parameters of the\nbinary. We provide a set of empirical formulas for the final mass, spin and\nrecoil velocity of the final black hole as a function of the mass ratio and\nindividual spins of the progenitor. In order to determine the fitting\ncoefficients for these formulas, we perform a set of 128 new numerical\nevolutions of precessing, unequal-mass black-hole binaries, and fit to the\nresulting remnant mass, spin, and recoil. In order to reduce the complexity of\nthe analysis, we chose configurations that have one of the black holes\nspinning, with dimensionless spin alpha=0.8, at different angles with respect\nto the orbital angular momentum, and the other non-spinning. In addition to\nevolving families of binaries with different spin-inclination angles, we also\nevolved binaries with mass ratios as small as q=1/6. We use the resulting\nempirical formulas to predict the probabilities of black hole mergers leading\nto a given recoil velocity, total radiated gravitational energy, and final\nblack hole spin.\n", "  We report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1950+2414\n($P=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit in\nPulsar ALFA survey observations with the Arecibo telescope. Its companion star\nhas a median mass of 0.3 $M_\\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. Fully\nrecycled MSPs like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by mass\ntransfer from a companion star. This process should circularize the orbit, as\nis observed for the vast majority of binary MSPs, which predominantly have\norbital eccentricities $e < 0.001$. However, four recently discovered binary\nMSPs have orbits with $0.027 < e < 0.44$; PSR J1950+2414 is the fifth such\nsystem to be discovered. The upper limits for its intrinsic spin period\nderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to those\nof the general MSP population. The large eccentricities are incompatible with\nthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happened\nduring their evolution. Proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of the\npulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in an\nexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationally\ndelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)\ndynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. We compare the\nproperties of all five known eccentric MSPs with the predictions of these\nformation channels. Future measurements of the masses and proper motion might\nallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.\n", "  This work establishes a connection between canonical perturbation series in\nquantum mechanics and a Kato expansion for the resolvent of the Liouville\nsuperoperator. Our approach leads to an explicit expression for a generator of\na block-diagonalizing Dyson's ordered exponential in arbitrary perturbation\norder. Unitary intertwining of perturbed and unperturbed averaging\nsuperprojectors allows for a description of ambiguities in the generator and\nblock-diagonalized Hamiltonian.\n  We compare the efficiency of the corresponding computational algorithm with\nthe efficiencies of the Van Vleck and Magnus methods for high perturbative\norders.\n", "  We study a two-dimensional rotating Bose-Einstein condensate confined by an\nanharmonic trap in the framework of the Gross-Pitaevksii theory. We consider a\nrapid rotation regime close to the transition to a giant vortex state. It was\nproven in [M. Correggi {\\it et al}, {\\it J. Math. Phys. \\textbf{53}(2012)] that\nsuch a transition occurs when the angular velocity is of order $ \\varepsilon\n^{-4}$, with $ \\varepsilon ^{-2} $ denoting the coefficient of the nonlinear\nterm in the Gross-Pitaevskii functional and $ \\varepsilon \\ll 1 $ (Thomas-Fermi\nregime). In this paper we identify a finite value $ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{c}} $ such\nthat, if $ \\Omega = \\Omega_0/\\varepsilon ^4 $ with $ \\Omega_0 >\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{c}} $, the condensate is in the giant vortex phase. Under the\nsame condition we prove a refined energy asymptotics and an estimate of the\nwinding number of any Gross-Pitaevskii minimizer.\n", "  Laterally periodic nanostructures were investigated with grazing incidence\nsmall angle X-ray scattering. To support an improved reconstruction of\nnanostructured surface geometries, we investigated the origin of the\ncontributions to the diffuse scattering pattern which is correlated to the\nsurface roughness. Resonant diffuse scattering leads to a palm-like structure\nof intensity sheets. Dynamic scattering generates the so-called Yoneda band\ncaused by a resonant scatter enhancement at the critical angle of total\nreflection and higher-order Yoneda bands originating from a subsequent\ndiffraction of the Yoneda enhanced scattering at the grating. Our explanations\nare supported by modelling using a solver for the time-harmonic Maxwell's\nequations based on the finite-element method.\n", "  Neighborhoods populated by amenities--such as restaurants, cafes, and\nlibraries--are considered to be a key property of desirable cities. Yet,\ndespite the global enthusiasm for amenity-rich neighborhoods, little is known\nabout the empirical laws governing the colocation of amenities at the\nneighborhood scale. Here, we contribute to our understanding of the naturally\noccurring neighborhood-scale agglomerations of amenities observed in cities by\nusing a dataset summarizing the precise location of millions of amenities. We\nuse this dataset to build the network of co-location of amenities, or Amenity\nSpace, by first introducing a clustering algorithm to identify neighborhoods,\nand then using the identified neighborhoods to map the probability that two\namenities will be co-located in one of them. Finally, we use the Amenity Space\nto build a recommender system that identifies the amenities that are missing in\na neighborhood given its current pattern of specialization. This opens the door\nfor the construction of amenity recommendation algorithms that can be used to\nevaluate neighborhoods and inform their improvement and development.\n", "  We put forward a strategy to encode a quantum operation into the unmodulated\ndynamics of a quantum network without the need of external control pulses,\nmeasurements or active feedback. Our optimization scheme, inspired by\nsupervised machine learning, consists in engineering the pairwise couplings\nbetween the network qubits so that the target quantum operation is encoded in\nthe natural reduced dynamics of a network section. The efficacy of the proposed\nscheme is demonstrated by the finding of uncontrolled four-qubit networks that\nimplement either the Toffoli gate, the Fredkin gate, or remote logic\noperations. The proposed Toffoli gate is stable against imperfections, has a\nhigh-fidelity for fault tolerant quantum computation, and is fast, being based\non the non-equilibrium dynamics.\n", "  We analyze the thermalization of a photoexcited charge carrier coupled to a\nsingle branch of quantum phonons within the Holstein model. To this end, we\ncalculate the far-from-equilibrium time evolution of a pure many-body state and\ncompare it with predictions of the thermal Gibbs ensemble. We show that at\nstrong enough carrier excitation, the nonequilibrium system evolves towards a\nthermal steady state. Our analysis is based on two classes of observables.\nFirst, the occupations of fermionic momenta, which are the eigenvalues of the\none-particle density matrix, match in the steady state the values in the\ncorresponding Gibbs ensemble. This indicates thermalization of static fermionic\ncorrelations on the entire lattice. Second, the dynamic current-current\ncorrelations, including the time-resolved optical conductivity, also take the\nform of their thermal counterparts. Remarkably, both static and dynamic\nfermionic correlations thermalize with identical temperatures. Our results\nsuggest that the subsequent relaxation processes, observed in time-resolved\nultrafast spectroscopy, may be efficiently described by applying quasithermal\napproaches, e.g., multi-temperature models.\n", "  Correlations of galaxy ellipticities with large-scale structure, due to\ngalactic tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to\nmeasurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still\npoorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear\nanalyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant\nin determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic\nellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we\ncalculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model\nfrom non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate\nthis to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured\ncross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential.\nOn the scales relevant for CMB lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the\ngravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale\nmode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the\nintrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular\ncross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in\nthe linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.\nThe amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the\nformation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift\nwhen the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we\nmake simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the\ncorrelation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing\nmeasurements. We note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in\nmeasurements of the difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and\nspiral galaxies if these can be separated (e.g., using colour).\n", "  Electron spins of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are important quantum\nresources for nanoscale sensing and quantum information. Combining NV spins\nwith levitated optomechanical resonators will provide a hybrid quantum system\nfor novel applications. Here we optically levitate a nanodiamond and\ndemonstrate electron spin control of its built-in NV centers in low vacuum. We\nobserve that the strength of electron spin resonance (ESR) is enhanced when the\nair pressure is reduced. To better understand this system, we investigate the\neffects of trap power and measure the absolute internal temperature of\nlevitated nanodiamonds with ESR after calibration of the strain effect. We also\nobserve that oxygen and helium gases have different effects on both the\nphotoluminescence and the ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centers, indicating\npotential applications of NV centers in oxygen gas sensing. Our results pave\nthe way towards a levitated spin-optomechanical system for studying macroscopic\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  We address the dynamics of continuous-time quantum walks on one-dimensional\ndisordered lattices inducing dynamical noise in the system. Noise is described\nas time-dependent fluctuations of the tunneling amplitudes between adjacent\nsites, and attention is focused on non-Gaussian telegraph noise, going beyond\nthe usual assumption of fast Gaussian noise. We observe the emergence of two\ndifferent dynamical behaviors for the walker, corresponding to two opposite\nnoise regimes: slow noise (i.e. strong coupling with the environment) confines\nthe walker into few lattice nodes, while fast noise (weak coupling) induces a\ntransition between quantum and classical diffusion over the lattice. A phase\ntransition between the two dynamical regimes may be observed by tuning the\nratio between the autocorrelation time of the noise and the coupling between\nthe walker and the external environment generating the noise. We also address\nthe non-Markovianity of the quantum map by assessing its memory effects, as\nwell as evaluating the information backflow to the system. Our results suggest\nthat the non-Markovian character of the evolution is linked to the dynamical\nbehavior in the slow noise regime, and that fast noise induces a Markovian\ndynamics for the walker.\n", "  Elucidating the nature of the magnetism of a high-temperature superconductor\nis crucial for establishing its pairing mechanism. The parent compounds of the\ncuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors exhibit N\\'eel and stripe magnetic\norder, respectively. However, FeSe, the structurally simplest iron-based\nsuperconductor, shows nematic order (Ts = 90 K), but not magnetic order in the\nparent phase, and its magnetic ground state is intensely debated. Here, we\nreport inelastic neutron-scattering experiments that reveal both stripe and\nN\\'eel spin fluctuations over a wide energy range at 110 K. On entering the\nnematic phase, a substantial amount of spectral weight is transferred from the\nN\\'eel to the stripe spin fluctuations. Moreover, the total fluctuating\nmagnetic moment of FeSe is ~ 60% larger than that in the iron pnictide\nBaFe2As2. Our results suggest that FeSe is a novel S = 1 nematic\nquantum-disordered paramagnet interpolating between the N\\'eel and stripe\nmagnetic instabilities.\n", "  We study the static three-quark (3Q) potential for more than 300 different\npatterns of 3Q systems with high statistics, i.e., 1000-2000 gauge\nconfigurations, in SU(3) lattice QCD at the quenched level. For all the\ndistances, the 3Q potential is found to be well described by the Y-ansatz,\ni.e., one-gluon-exchange (OGE) Coulomb plus Y-type linear potential. Also, we\ninvestigate Abelian projection of quark confinement in the context of the dual\nsuperconductor picture proposed by Yoichiro~Nambu~{\\it et al.} in SU(3) lattice\nQCD. Remarkably, quark confinement forces in both Q$\\bar{\\rm Q}$ and 3Q systems\ncan be described only with Abelian variables in the maximally Abelian gauge,\ni.e., $\\sigma_{\\rm Q \\bar Q} \\simeq \\sigma_{\\rm Q \\bar Q}^{\\rm Abel} \\simeq\n\\sigma_{\\rm 3Q} \\simeq \\sigma_{\\rm 3Q}^{\\rm Abel}$, which we call ``perfect\nAbelian dominance'' of quark confinement.\n", "  We present an evaluation of the background induced by $^{241}$Am-$^{13}$C\nneutron calibration sources in the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment. As a\nsignificant background for electron-antineutrino detection at 0.26$\\pm$0.12 per\ndetector per day on average, it has been estimated by a Monte Carlo simulation\nthat was benchmarked by a special calibration data set. This dedicated data set\nalso provided the energy spectrum of the background.\n", "  Axions with broken discrete shift symmetry (axion monodromy) have recently\nplayed a central role both in the discussion of inflation and the `relaxion'\napproach to the hierarchy problem. We suggest a very minimalist way to\nconstrain such models by the weak gravity conjecture for domain walls: While\nthe electric side of the conjecture is always satisfied if the\ncosine-oscillations of the axion potential are sufficiently small, the magnetic\nside imposes a cutoff, $\\Lambda^3 \\sim m f M_{pl}$, independent of the height\nof these `wiggles'. We compare our approach with the recent related proposal by\nIbanez, Montero, Uranga and Valenzuela. We also discuss the non-trivial\nquestion which version, if any, of the weak gravity conjecture for domain walls\nshould hold. In particular, we show that string compactifications with branes\nof different dimensions wrapped on different cycles lead to a `geometric weak\ngravity conjecture' relating volumes of cycles, norms of corresponding forms\nand the volume of the compact space. Imposing this `geometric conjecture',\ne.g.~on the basis of the more widely accepted weak gravity conjecture for\nparticles, provides at least some support for the (electric and magnetic)\nconjecture for domain walls.\n", "  The physics of light-matter interactions is strongly constrained by both the\nsmall value of the fine-structure constant and the small size of the atom.\nOvercoming these limitations is a long-standing challenge. Recent theoretical\nand experimental breakthroughs have shown that two dimensional systems, such as\ngraphene, can support strongly confined light in the form of plasmons. These 2D\nsystems have a unique ability to squeeze the wavelength of light by over two\norders of magnitude. Such high confinement requires a revisitation of the main\nassumptions of light-matter interactions. In this letter, we provide a general\ntheory of light-matter interactions in 2D systems which support plasmons. This\ntheory reveals that conventionally forbidden light-matter interactions, such\nas: high-order multipolar transitions, two-plasmon spontaneous emission, and\nspin-flip transitions can occur on very short time-scales - comparable to those\nof conventionally fast transitions. Our findings enable new platforms for\nspectroscopy, sensing, broadband light generation, and a potential test-ground\nfor non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  We develop techniques, based on differential geometry, to compute holomorphic\nYukawa couplings for heterotic line bundle models on Calabi-Yau manifolds\ndefined as complete intersections in projective spaces. It is shown explicitly\nhow these techniques relate to algebraic methods for computing holomorphic\nYukawa couplings. We apply our methods to various examples and evaluate the\nholomorphic Yukawa couplings explicitly as functions of the complex structure\nmoduli. It is shown that the rank of the Yukawa matrix can decrease at specific\nloci in complex structure moduli space. In particular, we compute the up Yukawa\ncoupling and the singlet-Higgs-lepton trilinear coupling in the heterotic\nstandard model described in arXiv:1404.2767\n", "  We present a detailed security analysis of a d-dimensional quantum key\ndistribution protocol based on two and three mutually unbiased bases (MUBs)\nboth in an asymptotic and finite key length scenario. The finite secret key\nrates are calculated as a function of the length of the sifted key by (i)\ngeneralizing the uncertainly relation-based insight from BB84 to any d-level\n2-MUB QKD protocol and (ii) by adopting recent advances in the second-order\nasymptotics for finite block length quantum coding (for both d-level 2- and\n3-MUB QKD protocols). Since the finite and asymptotic secret key rates increase\nwith d and the number of MUBs (together with the tolerable threshold) such QKD\nschemes could in principle offer an important advantage over BB84. We discuss\nthe possibility of an experimental realization of the 3-MUB QKD protocol with\nthe orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom of photons.\n", "  The nonminimal coupling of the kinetic term to Einstein's tensor helps the\nimplementation of inflationary models due to the gravitationally enhanced\nfriction. We calculate the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters for the\nscalar--tensor theory of gravity with nonminimally derivative coupling. We find\nthat under experimental constraint from the orbits of millisecond pulsars in\nour galaxy, the theory deviates from Einstein's general relativity in the order\nof $10^{-20}$, and the effect of the nonminimal coupling is negligible if we\ntake the scalar field as dynamical dark energy. With the assumed conditions\nthat the background scalar field is spatially homogeneous and evolves only on\ncosmological timescales and the contribution to stress--energy in the solar\nsystem from the background scalar field is subdominant, the scalar field is\nrequired to be massless.\n", "  This work focuses on the relationship between L-H (or L-I) transitions and\nMHD activity in the low magnetic shear TJ-II stellarator. It is shown that the\npresence of a low order rational surface in the plasma edge (gradient) region\nlowers the threshold density for H-mode access. MHD activity is systematically\nsuppressed near the confinement transition.\n  We apply a causality detection technique (based on the Transfer Entropy) to\nstudy the relation between magnetic oscillations and locally measured plasma\nrotation velocity (related to Zonal Flows). For this purpose, we study a large\nnumber of discharges in two magnetic configurations, corresponding to 'fast'\nand 'slow' transitions. With the 'slow' transitions, the developing Zonal Flow\nprior to the transition is associated with the gradual reduction of magnetic\noscillations. The transition itself is marked by a strong spike of 'information\ntransfer' from magnetic to velocity oscillations, suggesting that the magnetic\ndrive may play a role in setting up the final sheared flow responsible for the\nH-mode transport barrier. Similar observations were made for the 'fast'\ntransitions. Thus, it is shown that magnetic oscillations associated with\nrational surfaces play an important and active role in confinement transitions,\nso that electromagnetic effects should be included in any complete transition\nmodel.\n", "  We experimentally investigate and utilize electrothermal feedback in a\nmicrowave nanobolometer based on a normal-metal\n($\\mbox{Au}_{x}\\mbox{Pd}_{1-x}$) nanowire with proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity. The feedback couples the temperature and the electrical\ndegrees of freedom in the nanowire, which both absorbs the incoming microwave\nradiation, and transduces the temperature change into a radio-frequency\nelectrical signal. We tune the feedback in situ and access both positive and\nnegative feedback regimes with rich nonlinear dynamics. In particular, strong\npositive feedback leads to the emergence of two metastable electron temperature\nstates in the millikelvin range. We use these states for efficient threshold\ndetection of coherent 8.4 GHz microwave pulses containing approximately 200\nphotons on average, corresponding to $1.1 \\mbox{ zJ} \\approx 7.0 \\mbox{ meV}$\nof energy.\n", "  In the context of track fitting problems by a Kalman filter, the appropriate\nfunctional forms of the elements of the random process noise matrix are derived\nfor tracking through thick layers of dense materials and magnetic field. This\nwork complements the form of the process noise matrix obtained by Mankel[1].\n", "  We study linear scalar perturbations around a flat FLRW background in mimetic\nHorndeski gravity. In the absence of matter, we show that the Newtonian\npotential satisfies a second-order differential equation with no spatial\nderivatives. This implies that the sound speed for scalar perturbations is\nexactly zero on this background. We also show that in mimetic $G^3$ theories\nthe sound speed is equally zero. We obtain the equation of motion for the\ncomoving curvature perturbation (first order differential equation) and solve\nit to find that the comoving curvature perturbation is constant on all scales\nin mimetic Horndeski gravity. We find solutions for the Newtonian potential\nevolution equation in two simple models. Finally we show that the sound speed\nis zero on all backgrounds and therefore the system does not have any wave-like\nscalar degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the timelike and null geodesics around the static\n[GMGHS (Gibbons, Maeda, Garfinkle, Horowitz and Strominger), magnetically\ncharged GMGHS, electrically charged GMGHS] and the rotating (Kerr-Sen\ndilaton-axion) dilaton black holes. The geodesic equations are solved in terms\nof Weierstrass elliptic functions. To classify the trajectories around the\nblack holes, we use the analytical solution and effective potential techniques\nand then characterize the different types of the resulting orbits in terms of\nthe conserved energy and angular momentum. Also, using the obtained results we\nstudy astrophysical applications.\n", "  When a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor first ignites carbon in its core,\nit undergoes ${\\sim} \\,10^{3}-10^{4} \\,$yr of convective burning prior to the\nonset of thermonuclear runaway. This carbon simmering phase is important for\nsetting the thermal profile and composition of the white dwarf. Using the\n\\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, we follow this convective burning and\nexamine the production of neutron-rich isotopes. The neutron content of the SN\nfuel has important consequences for the ensuing nucleosynthesis, and, in\nparticular, for the production of secondary Fe-peak nuclei like Mn and stable\nNi. These elements have been observed in the X-ray spectra of SN remnants like\nTycho, Kepler, and 3C 397, and their yields can provide valuable insights into\nthe physics of SNe Ia and the properties of their progenitors. We find that\nweak reactions during simmering can at most generate a neutron excess of\n${\\approx} \\, 3 \\times 10^{-4}$. This is ${\\approx} \\, 8 \\times 10^{-4}$ lower\nthan that found in previous studies that do not take the full density and\ntemperature profile of the simmering region into account. Our results imply\nthat the progenitor metallicity is the main contributor to the neutron excess\nin SN Ia fuel for $Z \\gtrsim 1/3 \\, Z_{\\odot}$. Alternatively, at lower\nmetallicities, this neutron excess provides a floor that should be present in\nany centrally-ignited SN~Ia scenario.\n", "  We construct a noncommutative (Grassmann) extension of the well known Adler\nYang-Baxter map. It satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation, it is reversible and\nbirational. Our extension preserves all the properties of the original map\nexcept the involutivity.\n", "  There has been a puzzle between experiments and theoretical predictions on\nthe charge ordering of layered titanium-oxypnictides superconductors.\nUnconventional mechanisms to explain this discrepancy have been argued so far,\neven affecting the understanding of superconductivity on the compound. We\nprovide a new theoretical prediction, by which the discrepancy itself is\nresolved without any complicated unconventional explanation. Phonon dispersions\nand changes of nesting vectors in Fermi surfaces are clarified to lead to the\nvariety of superlattice structures even for the common crystal structures when\nwithout CDW, including orthorhombic $2 \\times 2 \\times 1$ one for\nBaTi$_2$As$_2$O, which has not yet been explained successfully so far, being\ndifferent from tetragonal $\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\times 1$ for\nBaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O and BaTi$_2$Bi$_2$O. The electronic structure analysis can\nnaturally explain experimental observations about CDW including most latest\nones without any cramped unconventional mechanisms.\n", "  We report a measurement of the nuclear polarization of laser-cooled,\noptically-pumped $^{37}\\mathrm{K}$ atoms which will allow us to precisely\nmeasure angular correlation parameters in the beta-decay of the same atoms.\nThese results will be used to test the $V-A$ framework of the weak interaction\nat high precision. At the TRIUMF Neutral Atom Trap (TRINAT), a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT) confines and cools neutral $^{37}\\mathrm{K}$ atoms and optical\npumping spin-polarizes them. We monitor the nuclear polarization of the same\natoms that are decaying in situ by photoionizing a small fraction of the\npartially polarized atoms and then use the standard optical Bloch equations to\nmodel their population distribution. We obtain an average nuclear polarization\nof $P = 0.9913\\pm0.0008$, which is significantly more precise than previous\nmeasurements with this technique. Since our current measurement of the\nbeta-asymmetry has $0.2\\%$ statistical uncertainty, the polarization\nmeasurement reported here will not limit its overall uncertainty. This result\nalso demonstrates the capability to measure the polarization to $<0.1\\%$,\nallowing for a measurement of angular correlation parameters to this level of\nprecision, which would be competitive in searches for new physics.\n", "  It has been recently shown that in the Heisenberg (anti)ferromagnet on the\nhoneycomb lattice, the magnons (spin wave quasipacticles) realize a massless\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Dirac-like Hamiltonian. It was shown that the Dirac magnon\nHamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo\nspins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon-magnon interactions. The\nDirac points also occur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple\nrealization of nontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system. We show\nthat the Dirac points are gapped when the inversion symmetry of the lattice is\nbroken by introducing a next-nearest neighbour Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction. Thus, the system realizes magnon edge states similar to Haldane\nmodel for quantum anomalous Hall effect in electronic systems. However, in\ncontrast to electronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to\nOhmic heating, noninteracting topological magnons can propagate for long time\nwithout dissipation as magnons are uncharged particles. We observe the same\nmagnon edge states for the XY model on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, in\nthis case the model maps to interacting hardcore bosons on the honeycomb\nlattice. Quantum magnetic systems with nontrivial magnon edge states are called\ntopological magnon insulators. They have been studied theoretically on the\nkagome lattice and recently observed experimentally on the kagome magnet\nCu(1-3, bdc) with three magnon bulk bands. Our results for the honeycomb\nlattice suggests an experimental procedure to search for honeycomb topological\nmagnon insulators within a class of 2D quantum magnets and ultracold atoms\ntrapped in honeycomb optical lattices.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases\nprovides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between strong interaction\nand SOC in a tunable, disorder-free system. We present here precision ab initio\nnumerical results on the two-dimensional, unpolarized, uniform Fermi gas with\nattractive interactions and Rashba SOC. Using auxiliary-field quantum Monte\nCarlo and incorporating recent algorithmic advances, we carry out exact\ncalculations on sufficiently large system sizes to provide accurate results\nsystematically as a function of experimental parameters. We obtain the equation\nof state, the momentum distributions, the pseudo-spin correlations and the\npairing wave functions. Our results help illuminate the rich pairing structure\ninduced by SOC, and provide benchmarks for theory and guidance to future\nexperimental efforts.\n", "  Ultrashort electron bunches are crucial for an increasing number of\napplications, however, diagnosing their longitudinal phase space remains a\nchallenge. We propose a new method that harnesses the strong electric fields\npresent in a laser driven plasma wakefield. By transversely displacing driver\nlaser and witness bunch, a streaking field is applied to the bunch. This field\nmaps the time information to a transverse momentum change and, consequently, to\na change of transverse position. We illustrate our method with simulations\nwhere we achieve a time resolution in the attosecond range.\n", "  Ensemble density-functional theory (eDFT) suffers from the so-called \"ghost\ninteraction\" error when approximate exchange-correlation functionals are used.\nIn this work, we present a rigorous ghost interaction correction (GIC) scheme\nin the context of range-separated eDFT. The method relies on an exact\ndecomposition of the ensemble short-range exchange-correlation energy into a\nmultideterminantal exact exchange term, which involves the long-range\ninteracting ensemble density matrix instead of the Kohn--Sham (KS) one, and a\ncomplementary density-functional correlation energy. A generalized adiabatic\nconnection formula is derived for the latter. In order to perform practical\ncalculations, the complementary correlation functional has been simply modeled\nby its ground-state local density approximation (LDA) while long-range\ninteracting ground- and excited-state wavefunctions have been obtained\nself-consistently by combining a long-range configuration interaction\ncalculation with a short-range LDA potential. We show that GIC reduces the\ncurvature of approximate range-separated ensemble energies drastically while\nproviding considerably more accurate excitation energies, even for\ncharge-transfer and double excitations. Interestingly, the method performs well\nalso in the context of standard KS-eDFT, which is recovered when the\nrange-separation parameter is set to zero.\n", "  We discuss large $N$ rules of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the bi-local\nrepresentation of holography of this theory. This is done by establishing $1/N$\nFeynman rules in terms of bi-local propagators and vertices, which can be\nevaluated following the recent procedure of Polchinski and Rosenhaus. These\nrules can be interpreted as Witten type diagrams of the dual AdS theory, which\nwe are able to define at IR fixed point and off.\n", "  We study a Higgs inflation model with a running kinetic term, taking account\nof the renormalization group evolution of relevant coupling constants.\nSpecifically we study two types of the running kinetic Higgs inflation, where\nthe inflaton potential is given by the quadratic or linear term potential in a\nframe where the Higgs field is canonically normalized. We solve the\nrenormalization group equations at two-loop level and calculate the scalar\nspectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We find that, even if the\nrenormalization group effects are included, the quadratic inflation is ruled\nout by the CMB observations, while the linear one is still allowed.\n", "  The grain boundary-mediated mechanisms that control plastic deformation of\nnanocrystalline metals should cause evolution of the grain boundary network,\nsince they directly alter misorientation relationships between crystals.\nUnfortunately, current experimental techniques are unable to track such\nevolution, due to limits on both spatial and temporal resolution. In this work,\nmolecular dynamics simulations are used to study grain boundary restructuring\nin nanocrystalline Al during both monotonic tension and cyclic loading. This\ntask is enabled by the creation of new analysis tools for atomistic datasets\nthat allow for a complete characterization and tracking of microstructural\ndescriptors of the grain boundary network. Quantitative measurements of grain\nboundary character distribution, triple junction type, grain boundary plane\nnormal, and other interfacial network characteristics are extracted and\nanalyzed. The results presented here show that nanocrystalline plasticity leads\nto an increase in special boundary fraction and disruption of two-dimensional\nboundary connectivity, with the most dramatic evolution occurring in the\nsmallest grain sizes.\n", "  The importance of antiferromagnetic fluctuations are widely acknowledged in\nmost unconventional superconductors. In addition, cuprates and iron pnictides\noften exhibit unidirectional (nematic) electronic correlations, including\nstripe and orbital orders, whose fluctuations may also play a key role for\nelectron pairing. However, these nematic correlations are intertwined with\nantiferromagnetic or charge orders, preventing us to identify the essential\nrole of nematic fluctuations. This calls for new materials having only\nnematicity without competing or coexisting orders. Here we report systematic\nelastoresistance measurements in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ superconductors, which,\nunlike other iron-based families, exhibit an electronic nematic order without\naccompanying antiferromagnetic order. We find that the nematic transition\ntemperature decreases with sulphur content $x$, whereas the nematic\nfluctuations are strongly enhanced. Near $x\\approx0.17$, the nematic\nsusceptibility diverges towards absolute zero, revealing a nematic quantum\ncritical point. This highlights FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ as a unique nonmagnetic\nsystem suitable for studying the impact of nematicity on superconductivity.\n", "  Neutrino oscillation experiments presently suggest that neutrinos have a\nsmall but finite mass. If neutrinos are to have mass, there should be a Lorentz\nframe in which they can be brought to rest. This paper discusses how Wigner's\nlittle groups can be used to distinguish between massive and massless\nparticles. We derive a representation of the SL(2,c) group which separates out\nthe two sets of spinors contained therein. One set is gauge dependent. The\nother set is gauge-invariant and represents polarized neutrinos. We show that a\nsimilar calculation can be done for the Dirac equation. In the\nlarge-momentum/zero-mass limit, the Dirac spinors can be separated into large\nand small components. The large components are gauge invariant, while the small\ncomponents are not. These small components represent spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\nnon-zero mass particles. If we renormalize the large components, these gauge\ninvariant spinors again represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive\nneutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.\n", "  Probing the Higgs potential and new physics behind the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is one of the most important issues of particle physics. In\nparticular, nature of electroweak phase transition is essential for\nunderstanding physics at the early Universe, such that the strongly first order\nphase transition is required for a successful scenario of electroweak\nbaryogenesis. The strongly first order phase transition is expected to be\ntested by precisely measuring the triple Higgs boson coupling at future\ncolliders like the International Linear Collider. It can also be explored via\nthe spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves to be measured at future\nspace-based interferometers such as eLISA and DECIGO. We discuss\ncomplementarity of both the methods in testing the strongly first order phase\ntransition of the electroweak symmetry in models with additional isospin\nsinglet scalar fields with and without classical scale invariance. We find that\nthey are synergetic in identifying specific models of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking in more details.\n", "  The sluggish and heterogeneous dynamics of glass forming liquids is\nfrequently associated to the transient coexistence of two phases of particles,\nrespectively with an high and low mobility. In the absence of a dynamical order\nparameter that acquires a transient bimodal shape, these phases are commonly\nidentified empirically, which makes difficult investigating their relation with\nthe structural properties of the system. Here we show that the distribution of\nsingle particle diffusivities can be accessed within a Continuous Time Random\nWalk description of the intermittent motion, and that this distribution\nacquires a transient bimodal shape in the deeply supercooled regime, thus\nallowing for a clear identification of the two coexisting phase. In a simple\ntwo-dimensional glass forming model, the dynamic phase coexistence is\naccompanied by a striking structural counterpart: the distribution of the\ncrystalline-like order parameter becomes also bimodal on cooling, with\nincreasing overlap between ordered and immobile particles. This simple\nstructural signature is absent in other models, such as the three-dimesional\nKob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture, where more sophisticated order parameters\nmight be relevant. In this perspective, the identification of the two dynamical\ncoexisting phases opens the way to deeper investigations of structure-dynamics\ncorrelations.\n", "  In this letter, we examine a new class of CPT-even nonminimal interactions,\nbetween fermions and photons, deprived of higher order derivatives, that yields\nelectric dipole moment (EDM) and magnetic dipole moment (MDM) in the context of\nthe Dirac equation. The couplings are dimension-five CPT-even and\nLorentz-violating nonminimal structures, composed of a rank-2 tensor,\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}$, the electromagnetic tensor, and gamma matrices, being addressed\nin its axial and non-axial Hermitian versions, and also comprising general\npossibilities. We then use the electron's anomalous magnetic dipole moment and\nelectron electric dipole moment measurements to reach upper bounds of $1$ part\nin $10^{20}$ and $10^{25}$ (eV )$^{-1}$.\n", "  Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) have been suggested to be powered by\nstrongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars which are often called\nmagnetars. In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via\nmagnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars\nare highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost\nas gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe. By\nsimply comparing electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission timescales, we\nconstrain upper limits to the ellipticity of magnetars by assuming that they\npower the observed SLSNe. We find that their ellipticity typically needs to be\nless than about a few 1e-3. This indicates that the toroidal magnetic field\nstrengths in these magnetars are typically less than a few 1e16 G so that their\ndistortions remain small. Because light-curve modelling of SLSNe shows that\ntheir dipole magnetic field strengths are of the order of 1e14 G, the ratio of\npoloidal to toroidal magnetic field strengths is found to be larger than ~ 0.01\nin magnetars powering SLSNe.\n", "  We study the low temperature conductivity of the electron accumulation layer\ninduced by the very strong electric field at the surface of $\\text{SrTiO}_3$\nsample. Due to the strongly nonlinear lattice dielectric response, the\nthree-dimensional density of electrons $n(x)$ in such a layer decays with the\ndistance from the surface $x$ very slowly as $n(x) \\propto 1/x^{12/7}$. We show\nthat when the mobility is limited by the surface scattering the contribution of\nsuch a tail to the conductivity diverges at large $x$ because of growing time\nelectrons need to reach the surface. We explore truncation of this divergence\nby the finite sample width, by the bulk scattering rate, or by the crossover to\nthe bulk linear dielectric response with the dielectric constant $\\kappa$. As a\nresult we arrive at the anomalously large mobility, which depends not only on\nthe rate of the surface scattering, but also on the physics of truncation.\nSimilar anomalous behavior is found for the Hall factor, the magnetoresistance,\nand the thermopower.\n", "  Here we sketch a new derivation of Zipf's law for word frequencies based on\noptimal coding. The structure of the derivation is reminiscent of Mandelbrot's\nrandom typing model but it has multiple advantages over random typing: (1) it\nstarts from realistic cognitive pressures (2) it does not require fine tuning\nof parameters and (3) it sheds light on the origins of other statistical laws\nof language and thus can lead to a compact theory of linguistic laws. Our\nfindings suggest that the recurrence of Zipf's law in human languages could\noriginate from pressure for easy and fast communication.\n", "  The spatial distribution of the satellite populations of the Milky Way and\nAndromeda are puzzling in that they are nearly perpendicular to the disks of\ntheir central galaxies. To understand the origin of such configurations we\nstudy the alignment of the central galaxy, satellite system and dark matter\nhalo in the largest of the \"Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their\nEnvironments\" (EAGLE) simulation. We find that centrals and their satellite\nsystems tend to be well aligned with their haloes, with a median misalignment\nangle of $33^{\\circ}$ in both cases. While the centrals are better aligned with\nthe inner $10$ kpc halo, the satellite systems are better aligned with the\nentire halo indicating that satellites preferentially trace the outer halo. The\ncentral - satellite alignment is weak (median misalignment angle of\n$52^{\\circ}$) and we find that around $20\\%$ of systems have a misalignment\nangle larger than $78^{\\circ}$, which is the value for the Milky Way. The\ncentral - satellite alignment is a consequence of the tendency of both\ncomponents to align with the dark matter halo. As a consequence, when the\ncentral is parallel to the satellite system, it also tends to be parallel to\nthe halo. In contrast, if the central is perpendicular to the satellite system,\nas in the case of the Milky Way and Andromeda, then the central - halo\nalignment is much weaker. Dispersion-dominated (spheroidal) centrals have a\nstronger alignment with both their halo and their satellites than\nrotation-dominated (disk) centrals. We also found that the halo, the central\ngalaxy and the satellite system tend to be aligned with the surrounding\nlarge-scale distribution of matter, with the halo being the better aligned of\nthe three.\n", "  We calculate the resistance and shot noise in the edge states of a 2D\ntopological insulator that result from the exchange of electrons between these\nstates and conducting puddles in the bulk of the insulator. The two limiting\ncases where the energy relaxation is either absent or very strong are\nconsidered. A finite time of spin relaxation in the puddles is introduced\nphenomenologically. Depending on this time and on the strength of coupling\nbetween the edge states and the puddles, the Fano factor $F=S_I/2eI$ ranges\nfrom 0 to 1/3, which is in an agreement with the available experimental data.\n", "  The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model has been proposed as a\npossible solution to the quantum measurement problem by modifying the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. In this work, we apply the CSL model to two\ncosmological models of the early Universe: the matter bounce scenario and slow\nroll inflation. In particular, we focus on the generation of the classical\nprimordial inhomogeneities and anisotropies that arise from the dynamical\nevolution, provided by the CSL mechanism, of the quantum state associated to\nthe quantum fields. In each case, we obtained a prediction for the shape and\nthe parameters characterizing the primordial spectra (scalar and tensor), i.e.\nthe amplitude, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We found that\nthere exist CSL parameter values, allowed by other non-cosmological\nexperiments, for which our predictions for the angular power spectrum of the\nCMB temperature anisotropy are consistent with the best fit canonical model to\nthe latest data released by the Planck Collaboration.\n", "  We show that aqueous solutions of ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) can be used\nto match the index of refraction of several transparent materials commonly used\nin experiments, while maintaining low viscosity and density compared to other\ncommon refractive index-matching liquids. We present empirical models for\nestimating the index of refraction, density, and kinematic viscosity of these\nsolutions as a function of temperature and concentration. Finally, we summarize\nthe chemical compatibility of ammonium thiocyanate with materials commonly used\nin apparatus.\n", "  We estimate the thermal masses and damping rates of active (m < eV) and\nsterile (M ~ GeV) neutrinos with thermal momenta k ~ 3T at temperatures below\nthe electroweak crossover (5 GeV < T < 160 GeV). These quantities fix the\nequilibration or \"washout\" rates of Standard Model lepton number densities.\nSterile neutrinos interact via direct scatterings mediated by Yukawa couplings,\nand via their overlap with active neutrinos. Including all leading-order\nreactions we find that the washout rate generally exceeds the Hubble rate for 5\nGeV < T < 30 GeV. Therefore it is challenging to generate a large lepton\nasymmetry facilitating dark matter computations operating at T < 5 GeV, whereas\nthe generation of a baryon asymmetry at T > 130 GeV remains an option. Our\ndifferential rates are tabulated in a form suitable for studies of specific\nscenarios with given neutrino Yukawa matrices.\n", "  In the present paper we study the geodesic motion of test particles and light\nrays in the spacetime of a static charged black hole in $f(R)$ gravity. The\ncomplete set of analytic solutions of the geodesic equations in the spacetime\nof this black hole are presented. The geodesic equations are solved in terms of\nWeierstrass elliptic $\\wp$ function and derivatives of Kleinian $\\sigma$\nfunction. With the help of parametric diagrams and effective potentials we\nanalyze the geodesic motion and give a list of all possible orbit types. The\ndifferent types of the resulting orbits are characterized in terms of the\nconserved energy, angular momentum, charge and cosmological constant.\n", "  Conventional approaches to the capture of CO_2 by metal-organic frameworks\nfocus on equilibrium conditions, and frameworks that contain little CO_2 in\nequilibrium are often rejected as carbon-capture materials. Here we use a\nstatistical mechanical model, parameterized by quantum mechanical data, to\nsuggest that metal-organic frameworks can be used to separate CO_2 from a\ntypical flue gas mixture when used under {\\em nonequilibrium} conditions. The\norigin of this selectivity is an emergent gas-separation mechanism that results\nfrom the acquisition by different gas types of different mobilities within a\ncrowded framework. The resulting distribution of gas types within the framework\nis in general spatially and dynamically heterogeneous. Our results suggest that\nrelaxing the requirement of equilibrium can substantially increase the\nparameter space of conditions and materials for which selective gas capture can\nbe effected.\n", "  The systematic monitoring of the solar wind in high-cadence and\nhigh-resolution heliospheric images taken by the Solar-Terrestrial Relation\nObservatory (STEREO) spacecraft permits the study of the spatial and temporal\nevolution of variable solar wind flows from the Sun out to 1~AU, and beyond. As\npart of the EU Framework 7 (FP7) Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and\nTechniques Service (HELCATS) project, we have generated a catalogue listing the\nproperties of 190 corotating structures well-observed in images taken by the\nHeliospheric Imager instruments on-board STEREO-A. We present here one of very\nfew long-term analyses of solar wind structures advected by the background\nsolar wind. This analysis confirms that most of the corotating density\nstructures detected by the heliospheric imagers comprises a series of density\ninhomogeneities advected by the slow solar wind that eventually become\nentrained by stream interaction regions. We have derived the spatial-temporal\nevolution of each of these corotating density structures by using a\nwell-established fitting technique. The mean radial propagation speed of the\ncorotating structures is found to be $311 \\pm 31$ km~s$^{-1}$. We predicted the\narrival time of each corotating density structure at different probes. We show\nthat the speeds of the corotating density structures derived using our fitting\ntechnique track well the long-term variation of the radial speed of the slow\nsolar wind during solar minimum years (2007--2008). Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat these features originate near the coronal neutral line that eventually\nbecomes the heliospheric current sheet.\n", "  During the last 40 years, Monte Carlo calculations based upon Importance\nSampling have matured into the most widely employed method for determinig first\nprinciple results in QCD. Nevertheless, Importance Sampling leads to\nspectacular failures in situations in which certain rare configurations play a\nnon-secondary role as it is the case for Yang-Mills theories near a first order\nphase transition or quantum field theories at finite matter density when\nstudied with the re-weighting method. The density-of-states method in its LLR\nformulation has the potential to solve such overlap or sign problems by means\nof an exponential error suppression. We here introduce the LLR approach and its\ngeneralisation to complex action systems. Applications include U(1), SU(2) and\nSU(3) gauge theories as well as the Z3 spin model at finite densities and\nheavy-dense QCD.\n", "  We report Monte Carlo simulations of a simple off-lattice patchy-particle\nmodel for DNA `bricks'. We relate the parameters that characterise this model\nwith the binding free energy of pairs of single-stranded DNA molecules. We\nverify that an off-lattice potential parameterised in this way reproduces much\nof the behaviour seen with a simpler lattice model we introduced previously,\nalthough the relaxation of the geometric constraints leads to a more\nerror-prone self-assembly pathway. We investigate the self-assembly process as\na function of the strength of the non-specific interactions. We show that our\noff-lattice model for DNA bricks results in robust self-assembly into a variety\nof target structures.\n", "  The dynamical arrest of gels is the consequence of a well defined structural\nphase transition, leading to the formation of a spanning cluster of bonded\nparticles. The dynamical glass transition, instead, is not accompanied by any\nclear structural signature. Nevertheless, both transitions are characterized by\nthe emergence of dynamical heterogeneities. Reviewing recent results from\nnumerical simulations, we discuss the behavior of dynamical heterogeneities in\ndifferent systems and show that a clear connection with the structure exists in\nthe case of gels. The emerging picture may be also relevant for the more\nelusive case of glasses. We show, as an example, that the relaxation process of\na simple glass-forming model can be related to a reverse percolation transition\nand discuss further perspective in this direction.\n", "  We attempt to interpret existing data on the evolution of the UV luminosity\nfunction and UV colours, $\\beta$, of galaxies at $5 \\leq z \\leq 8$, to improve\nour understanding of their dust content and ISM properties. To this aim, we\npost-process the results of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a\nchemical evolution model, which includes dust formation by supernovae and\nintermediate mass stars, dust destruction in supernova shocks, and grain growth\nby accretion of gas-phase elements in dense gas. We find that observations\nrequire a steep, Small Magellanic Cloud-like extinction curve and a clumpy dust\ndistribution, where stellar populations younger than 15 Myr are still embedded\nin their dusty natal clouds. Investigating the scatter in the colour\ndistribution and stellar mass, we find that the observed trends can be\nexplained by the presence of two populations: younger, less massive galaxies\nwhere dust enrichment is mainly due to stellar sources, and massive, more\nchemically evolved ones, where efficient grain growth provides the dominant\ncontribution to the total dust mass. Computing the IR-excess - UV color\nrelation we find that all but the dustiest model galaxies follow a relation\nshallower than the Meurer et al. (1999) one, usually adopted to correct the\nobserved UV luminosities of high-$z$ galaxies for the effects of dust\nextinction. As a result, their total star formation rates might have been\nover-estimated. Our study illustrates the importance to incorporate a proper\ntreatment of dust in simulations of high-$z$ galaxies, and that massive, dusty,\nUV-faint galaxies might have already appeared at $z \\lesssim 7$.\n", "  The vibro-acoustic response of a structure-liner-fluid system is predicted by\napplication of a patch impedance coupling methodology. In contrast to existing\nnumerical approaches, impedance matrices of structure and liner are determined\nby a direct experimental approach, avoiding the requirement of material\nparameters. Emphasis is placed on poroelastic lining materials. The method\naccounts for surface input and transfer terms and for cross and cross-transfer\nterms through the specimen. A single test-rig characterisation procedure for\nlayered poroelastic media is proposed. The specimen is considered as a single\ncomponent -- no separation of layers is necessary. Problem specific boundary\nconditions for skeleton and fluid, which may cause non-reciprocal cross terms,\nare dealt with by the procedure. Methods of measurement for the assessment of\nimpedance matrices are presented and their accuracy and limitations are\ndiscussed. An air gap correction method for surface impedance measurements is\npresented.\n", "  In this paper we present a comparative study in order to specify the\ninfluence of equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN) for pre- and\npost-compensation of chromatic dispersion in high capacity and high\nconstellation systems. This is - to our knowledge - the first detailed study in\nthis area for pre-compensation systems. Our main results show that the local\noscillator phase noise determines the EEPN influence in post-compensation\nimplementations whereas the transmitter laser determines the EEPN in\npre-compensation implementations. As a result of significance for the\nimplementation of practical longer-range systems it is to be emphasized that\nthe use of chromatic dispersion equalization in the optical domain - e.g. by\nthe use of dispersion compensation fibers - eliminates the EEPN entirely. Thus,\nthis seems a good option for such systems operating at high constellations in\nthe future.\n", "  We consider a general model for a network of oscillators with time delayed,\ncirculant coupling. We use the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to reduce\nthe system of delay differential equations to a phase model where the time\ndelay enters as a phase shift. We use the phase model to study the existence\nand stability of cluster solutions. Cluster solutions are phase locked\nsolutions where the oscillators separate into groups. Oscillators within a\ngroup are synchronized while those in different groups are phase-locked. We\ngive model independent existence and stability results for symmetric cluster\nsolutions. We show that the presence of the time delay can lead to the\ncoexistence of multiple stable clustering solutions. We apply our analytical\nresults to a network of Morris Lecar neurons and compare these results with\nnumerical continuation and simulation studies.\n", "  In this letter, a new approach to chemically dope black phosphorus (BP) is\npresented, which significantly enhances the device performance of BP\nfield-effect transistors for an initial period of 18 h, before degrading to\npreviously reported levels. By applying\n2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), low ON-state\nresistance of 3.2 ohm.mm and high field-effect mobility of 229 cm2/Vs are\nachieved with a record high drain current of 532 mA/mm at a moderate channel\nlength of 1.5 {\\mu}m.\n", "  We show that the water dissociation reaction H$_2$O$\\rightarrow$OH+H in the\nconfined environment of MOF-74 channels can be precisely controlled by the\naddition of the noble gas He. Elucidating the entire reaction process with ab\ninitio methods and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, we prove that the interaction\nbetween water molecules is critical to the formation of water clusters, which\nreduce the dissociation barrier by up to 37% and thus influence the reaction\nsignificantly. Our time-resolved IR measurements confirm that the formation of\nthese clusters can be suppressed by introducing He gas, providing unprecedented\ncontrol over water dissociation rates. Since the water dissociation reaction is\nthe cause of the structural instability of MOF-74 in the presence of water, our\nfinding of the reaction mechanism lays the groundwork for designing water\nstable versions of MOF-74 as well as understanding water related phenomena in\nMOFs in general.\n", "  The size, shape and degree of emptiness of void interiors sheds light on the\ndetails of galaxy formation. A particularly interesting question is whether\nvoid interiors are completely empty or contain a dwarf population. However the\nnearby voids that are most conducive for dwarf searches have large angular\ndiameters, on the order of a steradian, making it difficult to redshift-map a\nstatistically significant portion of their volume to the magnitude limit of\ndwarf galaxies. As part of addressing this problem, we investigate here the\nusefulness of number counts in establishing the best locations to search inside\nnearby (d < 300 Mpc) galaxy voids, utilizing Wolf plots of log(n < m) vs. m as\nthe basic diagnostic. To illustrate expected signatures, we consider the\nsignature of three void profiles, \"cut out\", \"built up\", and \"universal\nprofile\" carved into Monte-Carlo Schechter function models. We then investigate\nthe signatures of voids in the Millennium Run dark matter simulation and the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. We find in all of these the evidence for cut-out and\nbuilt-up voids is most discernible when the void diameter is similar to the\ndistance to its center. However the density distribution of the universal\nprofile that is characteristic of actual voids is essentially undetectable at\nany distance. A useful corollary of this finding is that galaxy counts are a\nreliable measure of survey completeness and stellar contamination even when\nsampling through significant voids.\n", "  We employ a length-dependent conical jet model for the jet structure and\nemission properties of flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 in the steady state.\nIn the model, ultra-relativistic leptons are injected at the base of jet and\npropagate along the jet structure, non-thermal photons are produced by both\nsynchrotron emission and inverse Comtpon scattering off synchrotron photons and\nexternal soft photons at each segment of jet. We derive the total energy\nspectra contribution through integrating every segment. We apply the model to\nthe quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength observed data of two quiescent epoches.\nUsing the observed radio data of source, we determine the length of jet $L\\sim\n100$ pc, and magnetic field $B_{0}\\sim 0.1-1$ G at the base of jet. Assuming a\nsteady geometry of the jet structure and suitable physical parameters, we\nreproduce the multi-wavelength spectra during two quiescent observed epoches,\nrespectively. Our results show that the initial $\\gamma$-ray emission site\ntakes place at $\\sim 0.5$ pc from black hole.\n", "  This paper presents a system of differential equations that describes the\nspreading of a rumor when it is propagated by different subgroups of spreaders.\nThe system that is developed is a generalization of the model proposed by Daley\nand Kendall. Finally, the system is applied to the exchange rate of the\nparallel dollar in Venezuela, where the source data that was used were obtained\nfrom Google Trends.\n", "  The mathematical basis for the Gaussian entanglement is discussed in detail,\nas well as its implications in the internal space-time structure of\nrelativistic extended particles. It is shown that the Gaussian entanglement\nshares the same set of mathematical formulas with the harmonic oscillator in\nthe Lorentz-covariant world. It is thus possible to transfer the concept of\nentanglement to the Lorentz-covariant picture of the bound state which requires\nboth space and time separations between two constituent particles. These space\nand time variables become entangled as the bound state moves with a\nrelativistic speed. It is shown also that our inability to measure the\ntime-separation variable leads to an entanglement entropy together with a rise\nin the temperature of the bound state. As was noted by Paul A. M. Dirac in\n1963, the system of two oscillators contains the symmetries of O(3,2) de Sitter\ngroup containing two O(3,1) Lorentz groups as its subgroups. Dirac noted also\nthat the system contains the symmetry of the Sp(4) group which serves as the\nbasic language for two-mode squeezed states. Since the Sp(4) symmetry contains\nboth rotations and squeezes, one interesting case is the combination of\nrotation and squeeze resulting in a shear. While the current literature is\nmostly on the entanglement based on squeeze along the normal coordinates, the\nshear transformation is an interesting future possibility. The mathematical\nissues on this problem are clarified.\n", "  The recent observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration\nprovides a unique opportunity to probe the extreme gravity of coalescing binary\nblack holes. In this regime, the gravitational interaction is not only strong,\nbut the spacetime curvature is large, characteristic velocities are a\nnon-negligible fraction of the speed of light, and the time scale on which the\ncurvature and gravity change is small. This contribution discusses some\nconsequences of these observations on modifications to General Relativity, with\na special emphasis on Lorentz-violating theories.\n", "  Electron tunneling through a single magnetic barrier in a HgTe topological\ninsulator has been theoretically investigated. We find that the perpendicular\nmagnetic field would not lead to spin-flip of the edge states due to the\nconservation of the angular moment. By tuning the magnetic field and Fermi\nenergy, the edge channels can be transited from switch-on states to switch-off\nstates and the current can be transmitted from unpolarized states to totally\nspin polarized states. These features offer us and efficient way to control the\ntopological edge state transport, and pave a way to construct the\nnanoelectronic devices utilizing the topological edge states.\n", "  Diabolical points (degeneracies) can naturally occur in spectra of\ntwo-dimensional quantum systems and classical wave resonators due to simple\nsymmetries. Geometric Berry phase is associated with these spectral\ndegeneracies. Here, we demonstrate a diabolical point and the corresponding\nBerry phase in the spectrum of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles --\nexciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. It is well known that\nsufficiently strong optical pumping can drive exciton-polaritons to quantum\ndegeneracy, whereby they form a macroscopically populated quantum coherent\nstate similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. By pumping a microcavity with a\nspatially structured light, we create a two-dimensional quantum billiard for\nthe exciton-polariton condensate and demonstrate a diabolical point in the\nspectrum of the billiard eigenstates. The fully reconfigurable geometry of the\npotential walls controlled by the optical pump enables a striking experimental\nvisualisation of the Berry phase associated with the diabolical point. The\nBerry phase is observed and measured by direct imaging of the macroscopic\nexciton-polariton wavefunctions.\n", "  With respect to earlier investigations, the theory of multi-component,\nconcentric, copolar, axisymmetric, rigidly rotating polytropes is improved and\nextended, including subsystems with nonzero density on the boundary and\nsubsystems with intersecting boundaries. The formulation is restricted to two\nsubsystems for simplicity but, in principle, can be extended to $N$ subsystems.\nEquilibrium configurations are independent of the nature of the fluid i.e.\ncollisional or collisionless, provided the polytropic index lies within the\nrange, $1/2\\le n\\le5$, as in one-component systems. The solution of the\nequilibrium equations is expanded in power series, which can be continued up to\nthe boundary and outside via starting points placed at increasingly larger\ndistance from the centre of mass. A detailed analysis is devoted to special\ncases where the solution of the equilibrium equations can be expressed\nanalytically. Finally a guidance example is shown, involving homogeneous\nsubsystems with intersecting boundaries, where a substantially flattened\ncomponent extends outside a slightly flattened one.\n", "  The free energy of mixing and the entropy of mixing for Cu$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$\nliquid binary alloys have been systematically investigated by using the\nelectronic theory of metals along with the perturbation approach at a\nthermodynamic state $T=1373$ K. The interionic interaction and a reference\nliquid are the fundamental components of the theory. The interionic interaction\nis described by a local pseudopotential. A liquid of hard spheres (HS) of two\ndifferent effective diametres is used to describe the reference system for\nalloys. The results of the calculations for energy of mixing agree well with\nthe available experimental data. Calculation of entropy of mixing is parameter\nfree and, the agreement with experiment, in this case, is found to be fairly\ngood.\n", "  We present the explicit form of the next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO)\nSkyrme interaction in momentum space by including the fourth-order gradient\npotentials to the standard Skyrme interaction. With the N$^2$LO Skyrme\ninteraction, we evaluate the second-order corrections to the nuclear bulk\nquantities of nuclear matter: equation of state (EoS) of isospin symmetric and\npure neutron matter, density-dependent in-medium effective nucleon mass,\nisospin-asymmetry energy, pressure and incompressibility. These second-order\ncontributions are ultraviolet (UV) divergent due to the zero range character of\nthe interaction and renormalized using the techniques of dimensional\nregularization (DR) with the minimal subtraction scheme (MS). We adjust the 18\nparameters of the interaction by performing a global fit to the nuclear bulk\nquantities. Besides the too strong dependence $k_F^{12}$ of several\nsecond-order corrections, a very good reproduction of a realistic nuclear\nmatter saturation curve with all the nuclear bulk quantities in the density\nregion $0.12<\\rho<0.20\\;$ fm$^{-3}$ is obtained.\n", "  We give the alternative formulation of quasiparticle model of quark gluon\nplasma with medium dependent dispersion relation. The model is\nthermodynamically consistent provided the medium dependent contribution to the\nenergy density is taken in to account. We establish the connection of our model\nwith other variants of quasiparticle models which are thermodynamically\nconsistent. We test the model by comparing the equation of state with the\nlattice gauge theory simulations of SU(3) pure gluodynamics .\n", "  Studies on Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) throw light on discoveries,\nidentification, orbit prediction and civil alert capabilities, including\npotential asteroid impact hazards. Due to various new observational programs,\nthe discovery rate of NEAs has drastically increased over the last few years.\nIn this paper we present the statistical survey and analysis of fundamental\nparameters (derived from Photometric and Spectroscopic observations) of a large\nsample of NEAs from various databases like IAU Minor Planet Center, European\nAsteroid Research Node (E.A.R.N.), Near Earth Objects - Dynamic Site (NEODyS-\n2), M4AST and SMASSMTT portals. We also discuss the characterization of NEAs on\nthe basis of the correlations between theparametersstudied from different\nobservationsand theirphysical implicationsin understanding the nature and\nphysical properties of these objects.\n  Keywords: NEOs; Apollo; Amor; Aten; Observations: Photometric, Spectroscopic.\n", "  We devise a systematic method to determine the Fisher information required\nfor resolving two incoherent point sources with a diffraction-limited linear\nimaging device. The resulting Cram\\'er-Rao bound gives the lowest variance\nachievable for an unbiased estimator. When only intensity in the image plane is\nrecorded, this bound diverges as the separation between the sources tends to\nzero, an effect which has been dubbed as Rayleigh's curse. However, this curse\ncan be lifted using suitable coherent measurements. In particular, we determine\na class of measurements that can be easily implemented as projections on the\northogonalised derivatives of the point spread function of the system.\n", "  We present our results on the {\\gamma}-ray emission from interaction-powered\nsupernovae (SNe), a recently discovered SN type that is suggested to be\nsurrounded by a circumstellar medium (CSM) with densities 10^7-10^12~ cm^-3.\nSuch high densities favor inelastic collisions between relativistic protons\naccelerated in the SN blast wave and CSM protons and the production of\n{\\gamma}-ray photons through neutral pion decays. Using a numerical code that\nincludes synchrotron radiation, adiabatic losses due to the expansion of the\nsource, photon-photon interactions, proton-proton collisions and proton-photon\ninteractions, we calculate the multi-wavelength non-thermal photon emission\nsoon after the shock breakout and follow its temporal evolution until 100-1000\ndays. Focusing on the {\\gamma}-ray emission at >100 MeV, we show that this\ncould be detectable by the Fermi-LAT telescope for nearby (<10 Mpc) SNe with\ndense CSM (>10^11 cm^-3).\n", "  We survey some recent developments on the mathematical modeling of opinion\ndynamics. After an introduction on opinion modeling through interacting\nmulti-agent systems described by partial differential equations of kinetic\ntype, we focus our attention on two major advancements: optimal control of\nopinion formation and influence of additional social aspects, like conviction\nand number of connections in social networks, which modify the agents' role in\nthe opinion exchange process.\n", "  Almost 60 years ago Andrew Huxley with his seminal paper \\cite{Huxley1957}\nlaid the foundation of modern muscle modeling, linking chemical events to\nmechanical performance. He described mechanics and energetics of muscle\ncontraction through the cyclical attachment and detachment of myosin motors to\nthe actin filament with ad hoc assumptions on the dependence of the rate\nconstants on the strain of the myosin motors. That relatively simple hypothesis\nis still present in recent models, even though with several modifications to\nadapt the model to the different experimental constraints which became\nsubsequently available. However, already in that paper, one controversial\naspect of the model became clear. Relatively high attachment and detachment\nrates of myosin to the actin filament were needed to simulate the high power\noutput at intermediate velocity of contraction. However, these rates were\nincompatible with the relatively slow rise in tension after activation, despite\nthe rise should be generated by the same rate functions. This discrepancy has\nnot been fully solved till today, despite several hypotheses have been\nforwarded to reconcile the two aspects. Here, using a conventional muscle\nmodel, we show that the recently revealed mechanosensing mechanism of\nrecruitment of myosin motors \\cite{Linarietal2015} can solve this long standing\nproblem without any further ad-hoc hypotheses.\n", "  The Markov evolution of states of a continuum migration model is studied. The\nmodel describes an infinite system of entities placed in $\\mathds{R}^d$ in\nwhich the constituents appear (immigrate) with rate $b(x)$ and disappear, also\ndue to competition. For this model, we prove the existence of the evolution of\nstates $\\mu_0 \\mapsto \\mu_t$ such that the moments $\\mu_t(N_\\Lambda^n)$, $n\\in\n\\mathds{N}$, of the number of entities in compact $\\Lambda \\subset\n\\mathds{R}^d$ remain bounded for all $t>0$. Under an additional condition, we\nprove that the density of entities and the second correlation function remain\nbounded globally in time.\n", "  We studied experimentally the high-temperature magnetoelectric $({\\rm\nBa}_{x}{\\rm Sr}_{1-x})_3\\rm Co_2Fe_{24}O_{41}$ prepared as ceramics (x = 0,\n0.2) and a single crystal (x = 0.5) using inelastic neutron scattering, THz\ntime-domain, Raman and far-infrared spectroscopies. The spectra, measured with\nvarying temperature and magnetic field, reveal rich information about the\ncollective spin and lattice excitations. In the ceramics, we observed an\ninfrared-active magnon which is absent in $E^{\\omega}\\perp z$ polarized THz\nspectra of the crystal, and we assume that it is an electromagnon active in\n$E^{\\omega} \\| z$ polarized spectra. On heating from 7 to 250 K, the frequency\nof this electromagnon drops from 36 to 25 cm$^{-1}$ and its damping gradually\nincreases, so it becomes overdamped at room temperature. Applying external\nmagnetic field has a similar effect on the damping and frequency of the\nelectromagnon, and the mode is no more observable in the THz spectra above 2 T,\nas the transverse-conical magnetic structure transforms into a collinear one.\nRaman spectra reveal another spin excitation with a slightly different\nfrequency and much higher damping. Upon applying magnetic field higher than 3\nT, in the low-frequency part of the THz spectra, a narrow excitation appears\nwhose frequency linearly increases with magnetic field. We interpret this\nfeature as the ferromagnetic resonance.\n", "  We report on development of controllably oxidized CoFeB ferromagnetic films\ndemonstrating the extraordinary Hall effect (EHE) resistivity exceeding 1 Ohmcm\nand magnetic field sensitivity up to 10^6 Ohm/T. Such EHE resistivity is four\norders of magnitude higher than previously observed in ferromagnetic materials,\nwhile sensitivity is two orders larger than the best of semiconductors\n", "  Magnetars are neutron stars endowed with surface magnetic fields of the order\nof $10^{14}-10^{15}$~G, and with presumably much stronger fields in their\ninterior. As a result of Landau quantization of electron motion, the\nneutron-drip transition in the crust of a magnetar is shifted to either higher\nor lower densities depending on the magnetic field strength. The impact of\nnuclear uncertainties is explored considering the recent series of\nBrussels-Montreal microscopic nuclear mass models. All these models are based\non the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with generalized Skyrme functionals. They\ndiffer in their predictions for the symmetry energy coefficient at saturation,\nand for the stiffness of the neutron-matter equation of state. For comparison,\nwe have also considered the very accurate but more phenomenological model of\nDuflo and Zuker. Although the equilibrium composition of the crust of a\nmagnetar and the onset of neutron emission are found to be model dependent, the\nquantum oscillations of the threshold density are essentially universal.\n", "  Pulsars are spinning extremely rapidly with periods as short as about $1.4$\nmilliseconds and delays of a few milliseconds per year at most, thus providing\nthe most accurate clocks in the Universe. Nevertheless, sudden spin ups have\nbeen detected in some pulsars like the emblematic Vela pulsar. These abrupt\nchanges in the pulsar's rotation period have long been thought to be the\nmanifestation of a neutron superfluid permeating the inner crust of neutron\nstars. However, the neutron superfluid has been recently found to be so\nstrongly coupled to the crust that it does not carry enough angular momentum to\nexplain the Vela data. We explore the extent to which pulsar-timing\nobservations can be reconciled with the standard glitch theory considering the\nlack of knowledge of the dense-matter equation of state.\n", "  The renormalization method has been previously used in conjunction with the\nLippman-Schwinger equation to calculate transmission probabilities for benzene\nmolecules, within the tight-binding approximation. Those results are extended\nhere by presenting explicit formulas for the transmission probability\nfunctions, which are subsequently analysed for their anti-resonances,\nresonances and other maxima and minima.\n", "  The cosmological arrow of time may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow by\nsecond law of thermodynamics. The time asymmetry is also associated with\ndissipative fluid as Tolman introduced a viscous fluid to generate an arrow of\ntime in cyclic cosmology. An arrow of time in cyclic cosmology has been shown\nusing scalar field.In this work we find out the cosmological arrow of time in\nf(R) gravity. Here we use the relation between a new scalar field and $f(R)$.\nThe dynamics of this new scalar field may emerge the arrow of time.\n", "  In this work, the single-component Cu metallic glass was fabricated by the\nphysical vapor deposition on the Zr (0001) crystal substrate at 100 K using the\nclassical molecular dynamic simulation. The same deposition process was\nperformed on the Cu (1 0 0) and Ni (1 0 0) crystal substrate for comparison,\nonly the Cu crystal deposited layer with the fcc structure can be obtained.\nWhen depositing the Cu atoms on the Zr substrate at 300 K, the crystal\nstructure was formed, which indicates that except the suitable substrate, low\ntemperature is also a key factor for the amorphous structure formation. The Cu\nliquid quenching from 2000 K to 100 K were also simulated with the cooling rate\n1012 K/s to form the Cu glass film in this work. The Cu metallic glass from the\ntwo different processes (physical vapor deposition and rapid thermal quenching\nfrom liquid) revealed the same radial distribution function and X-ray\ndiffraction pattern, but the different microstructure from the coordination\nnumber and Voronoi tessellation analysis.\n", "  A novel mid-infrared/near-infrared double resonant absorption setup for\nstudying infrared-inactive vibrational states is presented. A strong\nvibrational transition in the mid-infrared region is excited using an idler\nbeam from a singly resonant continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator, to\npopulate an intermediate vibrational state. High output power of the optical\nparametric oscillator and the strength of the mid-infrared transition result in\nefficient population transfer to the intermediate state, which allows measuring\nsecondary transitions from this state with a high signal-to-noise ratio. A\nsecondary, near-infrared transition from the intermediate state is probed using\ncavity ring down spectroscopy, which provides high sensitivity in this\nwavelength region. Due to the narrow linewidths of the excitation sources, the\nrovibrational lines of the secondary transition are measured with sub-Doppler\nresolution. The setup is used to access a previously unreported symmetric\nvibrational state of acetylene, $\\nu_1+\\nu_2+\\nu_3+\\nu_4^1+\\nu_5^{-1}$ in the\nnormal mode notation. Single-photon transitions to this state from the\nvibrational ground state are forbidden. Ten lines of the newly measured state\nare observed and fitted with the linear least-squares method to extract the\nband parameters. The vibrational term value was measured to be at 9775.0018(45)\n$\\text{cm}^{-1}$, the rotational parameter $B$ was 1.162222 $\\text{cm}^{-1}$,\nand the quartic centrifugal distortion parameter $D$ was 3.998(62)$\\times\n10^{-6} \\text{cm}^{-1}$, where the numbers in the parenthesis are one-standard\nerrors in the least significant digits.\n", "  Homogeneous highly epitaxial LaSrMnO3 (LSMO) thin films have been grown on\nYttria-stabilized-Zirconia (YsZ) / CeO2 buffer layers on technological relevant\n4\" silicon wafers using a Twente Solid State Technology B.V. (TSST) developed\nlarge area Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) setup. We study and show the results\nof the effect of an additional SrRuO3 buffer layer on the growth temperature\ndependent structural and magnetic properties of LSMO films. With the\nintroduction of a thin SrRuO3 layer on top of the buffer stack, LSMO films show\nferromagnetic behaviour for growth temperatures as low as 250C. We suggest that\noccurrence of epitaxial crystal growth of LSMO at these low growth temperatures\ncan be understood by an improved surface diffusion, which ensures sufficient\nintermixing of surface species for formation of the correct phase. This\nintermixing is necessary because the full plume is collected on the 4\" wafer\nresulting in a compositional varying flux of species on the wafer, in contrast\nto small scale experiments.\n", "  In the heart of the Creighton Mine near Sudbury (Canada), the SNO+ detector\nis foreseen to observe almost in equal proportion electron antineutrinos\nproduced by U and Th in the Earth and by nuclear reactors. SNO+ will be the\nfirst long baseline experiment to measure a reactor signal dominated by CANDU\ncores ($\\sim$55\\% of the total reactor signal), which generally burn natural\nuranium. Approximately 18\\% of the total geoneutrino signal is generated by the\nU and Th present in the rocks of the Huronian Supergroup-Sudbury Basin: the\n60\\% uncertainty on the signal produced by this lithologic unit plays a crucial\nrole on the discrimination power on the mantle signal as well as on the\ngeoneutrino spectral shape reconstruction, which can in principle provide a\ndirect measurement of the Th/U ratio in the Earth.\n", "  Spontaneous violation of relativistic invariance of the vacuum can derive\nquantum chromodynamics from an U(1) Higgs model including fermions, if the\nemergent theory is Lorentz invariant. In this model, the vacuum becomes\nanisotropic, and a fermion created on a triplet of spin-one vacua acquires\ndegeneracy analogous to the color degrees of freedom. The Nambu-Goldstone\nbosons originating from the breakdown of rotational symmetry provide the quasi\nfermions with SU(3)$\\times$U(1) effective interactions, which are interpretable\nas mediated by gluons and photons. The confinement of quasi quarks as well as\nthat of Nambu-Goldstone gluons follow from the Lorentz invariance of the\nemergent theory.\n", "  We report an experimental test of non-Newtonian gravitational forces at mi-\ncrometer range. To experimentally subtract off the Casimir force and the\nelectrostatic force background, differential force measurements were performed\nby sensing the lateral force between a gold sphere and a density modulated\nsource mass using a soft cantilever. The current sensitivity is limited by the\npatch electrostatic force, which is further improved by two dimensional (2D)\nforce mapping. The preliminary result sets a model independent constraint on\nthe Yukawa type force at this range.\n", "  We consider the low-energy effects of a selected set of Lorentz- and\nCPT-violating quark and gluon operators by deriving the corresponding chiral\neffective lagrangian. Using this effective lagrangian, low-energy hadronic\nobservables can be calculated. We apply this to magnetometer experiments and\nderive the best bounds on some of the Lorentz-violating coefficients. We point\nout that progress can be made by studying the nucleon-nucleon potential, and by\nconsidering storage-ring experiments for deuterons and other light nuclei.\n", "  During the common envelope (CE) phase, a giant star in a binary system\noverflows its Roche lobe and unstable mass transfer leads to a spiral-in of the\ncompanion, resulting in a close binary system or in a merger of the stellar\ncores. Dynamo processes during the CE phase have been proposed as a mechanism\nto generate magnetic fields that are important for forming magnetic white\ndwarfs (MWDs) and for shaping planetary nebulae. Here, we present the first\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations of the dynamical spiral-in during a CE phase.\nWe find that magnetic fields are strongly amplified in the accretion stream\naround the $1M_\\odot$ companion as it spirals into the envelope of a $2M_\\odot$\nRG. This leads to field strengths of 10 to 100 kG throughout the envelope after\n120 d. The magnetic field amplification is consistent with being driven by the\nmagnetorotational instability. The field strengths reached in our simulation\nmake the magnetic field interesting for diagnostic purposes, but they are\ndynamically irrelevant. They are also too small to explain the formation of the\nhighest fields found in MWDs, but may be relevant for luminous red novae, and\ndetecting magnetic fields in these events would support the scenario as\nproposed here.\n", "  Building on a previous conjecture, we argue that the holographic dual of the\nlight-front vacuum state of a superconformal field theory quantized in the\nfront form of dynamics contains the Kaigorodov spacetime, which is nothing but\na pp-wave propagating in AdS. Evidence in favor of this conjecture is\npresented. In particular we verify the matching of global symmetries and\ndiscuss the contribution of the zero mode sector in both sides of the\ncorrespondence.\n", "  In order to realize fast OCT-systems with adjustable line rate, we\ninvestigate averaging of image data from an FDML based MHz-OCT-system. The line\nrate can be reduced in software and traded in for increased system sensitivity\nand image quality. We compare coherent and incoherent averaging to effectively\nscale down the system speed of a 3.2 MHz FDML OCT system to around 100 kHz in\npostprocessing. We demonstrate that coherent averaging is possible with MHz\nsystems without special interferometer designs or digital phase stabilisation.\nWe show OCT images of a human finger knuckle joint in vivo with very high\nquality and deep penetration.\n", "  Next generation deep neural networks for classification hosted on embedded\nplatforms will rely on fast, efficient, and accurate learning algorithms.\nInitialization of weights in learning networks has a great impact on the\nclassification accuracy. In this paper we focus on deriving good initial\nweights by modeling the error function of a deep neural network as a\nhigh-dimensional landscape. We observe that due to the inherent complexity in\nits algebraic structure, such an error function may conform to general results\nof the statistics of large systems. To this end we apply some results from\nRandom Matrix Theory to analyse these functions. We model the error function in\nterms of a Hamiltonian in N-dimensions and derive some theoretical results\nabout its general behavior. These results are further used to make better\ninitial guesses of weights for the learning algorithm.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of generating pure heralded single photons\nthrough spontaneous parametric down-conversion comparing the\ncounter-propagating geometry studied in [1] with more conventional\nco-propagating configurations which enhance the purity of the heralded photon\nstate through the technique of group-velocity matching. We estimate the Schmidt\nnumber associated to the temporal modes as a function of the pump pulse\nduration for three particular configurations, showing how the different\nphase-matching conditions influences the degree of separability that can be\nachieved.\n", "  Acoustic holographic rendering in complete analogy with optical holography\nare useful for various applications, ranging from multi-focal lensing,\nmultiplexed sensing and synthesizing three-dimensional complex sound fields.\nConventional approaches rely on a large number of active transducers and phase\nshifting circuits. In this paper we show that by using passive metamaterials as\nsubwavelength pixels, holographic rendering can be achieved without cumbersome\ncircuitry and with only a single transducer, thus significantly reducing system\ncomplexity. Such metamaterial-based holograms can serve as versatile platforms\nfor various advanced acoustic wave manipulation and signal modulation, leading\nto new possibilities in acoustic sensing, energy deposition and medical\ndiagnostic imaging.\n", "  The metal--insulator phase transition is considered on the basis of\nGinzburg-Landau type equations with two different order parameters. An\ninclusion of magnetic field in this picture is an important step for\nunderstanding of behavior of the metal--insulator phase transition kinetics.\nThe magnetic field leads to various singularities of the surface tension and\nresults in drastic variations of the phase transition kinetics. The strongest\nsingularity is due to Landau diamagnetism and determines anomalous features of\nMI transition kinetics. This singularity supports the well known experimental\nfact that almost all semimetals behave like diamagnetic materials.\n", "  Electricity transmission networks dissipate a non-negligible fraction of the\npower they transport due to the heat loss in the transmission lines. In this\nwork we explore how the transport of energy can be more efficient by adding to\nthe network multiple batteries that can coordinate their operations. Such\nbatteries can both charge using the current excess in the network or discharge\nto meet the network current demand. Either way, the presence of batteries in\nthe network can be leveraged to mitigate the intrinsic uncertainty in the power\ngeneration and demand and, hence, transport the energy more efficiently through\nthe network. We consider a resistive DC network with stochastic external\ncurrent injections or consumptions and show how the expected total heat loss\ndepends on the network structure and on the batteries operations. Furthermore,\nin the case where the external currents are modeled by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocesses, we derive the dynamical optimal control for the batteries over a\nfinite time interval.\n", "  We present linear ensembles of dangling bond chains on a hydrogen terminated\nSi(100) surface, patterned in the closest spaced arrangement allowed by the\nsurface lattice. Local density of states maps over a range of voltages\nextending spatially over the close-coupled entities reveal a rich energetic and\nspatial variation of electronic states. These artificial molecules exhibit\ncollective electronic states resulting from covalent interaction of the\nconstituent atoms. A pronounced electrostatic perturbation of dangling bond\nchain structure is induced by close placement of a negatively dangling bond.\nThe electronic changes so induced are entirely removed, paradoxically, by\naddition of a second dangling bond.\n", "  In this work, we are trying to extent the existing photometric redshift\nregression models from modeling pure photometric data back to the spectra\nthemselves. To that end, we developed a PCA that is capable of describing the\ninput uncertainty (including missing values) in a dimensionality reduction\nframework. With this \"spectrum generator\" at hand, we are capable of treating\nthe redshift regression problem in a fully Bayesian framework, returning a\nposterior distribution over the redshift. This approach allows therefore to\napproach the multimodal regression problem in an adequate fashion. In addition,\ninput uncertainty on the magnitudes can be included quite naturally and lastly,\nthe proposed algorithm allows in principle to make predictions outside the\ntraining values which makes it a fascinating opportunity for the detection of\nhigh-redshifted quasars.\n", "  Transverse mode coupling instability of a bunch with space charge is\nconsidered in frameworks of the boxcar model. Presented results demonstrate a\nmonotonous growth of the TMCI threshold at increasing space charge tune shift,\nand do not support the supposition that the monotony can be violated at a\nhigher SC.\n"]}
