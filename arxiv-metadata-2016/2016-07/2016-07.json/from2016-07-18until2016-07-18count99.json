We\nexpress the Darcy velocity as a Weierstrass elliptic function of the transverse\ncoordinate. It allows us to get analytical expressions for volume flux and the\nrate of dissipation. The Weierstrass elliptic function is a doubly-periodic,\ncomplex-valued function defined over the complex plane. It takes real values\nonly on certain segments in the complex plane. We show how to align the\ntransverse coordinate axis along these segments to ensure real values of Darcy\nvelocity. Lastly, we give an algorithm to generate velocity profile and compute\nvolume flux given the flow parameters.\n", "  An adaptation of the WKB method in the deformation quantization formalism is\npresented with the aim to obtain an approximate technique of solving the\neigenvalue problem for energy in the phase space quantum approach. A\nrelationship between the phase $\\sigma(\\vec{r})$ of a wave function $\\exp\n\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\sigma(\\vec{r}) \\right)$ and its respective Wigner\nfunction is derived. Formulas to calculate the Wigner function of a product and\nof a superposition of wave functions are proposed. Properties of a Wigner\nfunction of interfering states are also investigated. Examples of this quasi -\nclassical approximation in deformation quantization are analysed. A strict form\nof the Wigner function for states represented by tempered generalised functions\nhas been derived. Wigner functions of unbound states in the Poeschl - Teller\npotential have been found.\n", "  This article presents the first direct \"observation\" of the global-scale, 3D\ncoronal magnetic fields of Carrington Rotation (CR) Cycle 2112 using vector\ntomographic inversion techniques. The Vector tomographic inversion uses\nobservational measurements of the Fe {\\sc{xiii}} 10747 \\AA\\ Hanle effect\npolarization signals by the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) and coronal\ndensity and temperature structures derived from scalar tomographic inversion of\nSTEREO/EUVI coronal emission lines (CELs) intensity images as inputs to derive\na coronal magnetic field model that best reproduces the observed polarization\nsignals. While independent verifications of the vector tomography results\ncannot be performed, we compared the tomography inverted coronal magnetic\nfields with those constructed by MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) simulation based on\nobserved photospheric magnetic fields of CR 2112 and 2113. We found that the\nMHD model for CR 2112 is qualitatively consistent with the tomography inverted\nresult for most of the reconstruction domain except for a couple of regions.\nParticularly for one of the most noticeable exception region, we found that the\nMHD simulation for CR 2113 predicted a model that more closely resemble the\nvector tomography inverted magnetic fields. We discuss the utilities and\nlimitations of the tomographic inversion technique, and present ideas for\nfuture developments.\n", "  The present article concludes that a ferromagnetic sample could be considered\nlike a paramagnetic system where the role of magnetic moments plays magnetic\ndomains. Based on this conclusion and taking into account presence of an\nanisotropic field the formula which describes magnetization dependence on the\nexternal magnetic field is derived. Expressions for a remanent magnetization\nand a coercive force are presented. The new parameter to characterize a\nmagnetic stiffness of a material is introduced. A physical expression for a\ndynamic magnetic susceptibility as a function of material's characteristics,\nexternal magnetic field, and a temperature is given.\n", "  We investigate a calculation method for solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation\nin slow-roll $k$-inflation based on the uniform approximation (UA) in\nconjunction with an expansion scheme for slow-roll parameters with respect to\nthe number of $e$-folds about the so-called \\textit{turning point}. Earlier\nworks on this method has so far gained some promising results derived from the\napproximating expressions for the power spectra among others, up to second\norder with respect to the Hubble and sound flow parameters, when compared to\nother semi-analytical approaches (e.g., Green's function and WKB methods).\nHowever, a closer inspection is suggestive that there is a problem when\nhigher-order parts of the power spectra are considered; residual logarithmic\ndivergences may come out that can render the prediction physically\ninconsistent. Looking at this possibility, we map out up to what order with\nrespect to the mentioned parameters several physical quantities can be\ncalculated before hitting a logarithmically divergent result. It turns out that\nthe power spectra are limited up to second order, the tensor-to-scalar ratio up\nto third order, and the spectral indices and running converge to all orders.\nThis indicates that the expansion scheme is incompatible with the working\nequations derived from UA for the power spectra but compatible with that of the\nspectral indices. For those quantities that involve logarithmically divergent\nterms in the higher-order parts, existing results in the literature for the\nconvergent lower-order parts calculated in the equivalent fashion should be\nviewed with some caution; they do not rest on solid mathematical ground.\n", "  We discuss semicanonical bases from the point of view of Cohomological Hall\nalgebras via the \"dimensional reduction\" from 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau\ncategories to 2-dimensional ones. Also, we discuss the notion of motivic\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants (as defined by M. Kontsevich and Y. Soibelman) in\nthe framework of 2-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories. In particular we propose\na conjecture which allows one to define Kac polynomials for a 2-dimensional\nCalabi-Yau category (this is a theorem of S. Mozgovoy in the case of\npreprojective algebras).\n", "  Using a Corner Transfer Matrix approach, we compute the bipartite\nentanglement R\\'enyi entropy in the off-critical perturbations of non-unitary\nconformal minimal models realised by lattice spin chains Hamiltonians related\nto the Forrester Baxter RSOS models in regime III. This allows to show on a set\nof explicit examples that the R\\'enyi entropies for non-unitary theories\nrescale near criticality as the logarithm of the correlation length with a\ncoefficient proportional to the effective central charge. This complements a\nsimilar result, recently established for the size rescaling at the critical\npoint, showing the expected agreement of the two behaviours. We also compute\nthe first subleading unusual correction to the scaling behaviour, showing that\nit is expressible in terms of expansions of various fractional powers of the\ncorrelation length, related to the differences $\\Delta-\\Delta_{\\min}$ between\nthe conformal dimensions of fields in the theory and the minimal conformal\ndimension. Finally, a few observations on the limit leading to the off-critical\nlogarithmic minimal models of Pearce and Seaton are put forward.\n", "  A realistic five-dimensional warped scenario with all standard model fields\npropagating in the bulk is proposed. Mass hierarchies would in principle be\naccounted for by judicious choices of the bulk mass parameters, while fermion\nmixing angles are restricted by a $\\Delta(27)$ flavor symmetry broken on the\nbranes by flavon fields. The latter gives stringent predictions for the\nneutrino mixing parameters, and the Dirac CP violation phase, all described in\nterms of only two independent parameters at leading order. The scheme also\ngives an adequate CKM fit and should be testable within upcoming oscillation\nexperiments.\n", "  We propose a new method to compute connection matrices of quantum\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated to integrable vertex models with\nsuper algebra and Hecke algebra symmetries. The scheme relies on decomposing\nthe underlying spin representation of the affine Hecke algebra in principal\nseries modules and invoking the known solution of the connection problem for\nquantum affine Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated to principal series\nmodules. We apply the method to the spin representation underlying the\n$\\mathcal{U}_q\\bigl(\\hat{\\mathfrak{gl}}(2|1)\\bigr)$ Perk-Schultz model. We show\nthat the corresponding connection matrices are described by an elliptic\nsolution of a supersymmetric version of the dynamical quantum Yang-Baxter\nequation with spectral parameter.\n", "  We formulate a microscopic, no adjustable parameter, theory of activated\nrelaxation in supercooled liquids directly in terms of the repulsive and\nattractive forces within the framework of pair correlations. Under isochoric\nconditions, attractive forces can nonperturbatively modify slow dynamics, but\nat high enough density their influence vanishes. Under isobaric conditions,\nattractive forces play a minor role. High temperature apparent Arrhenius\nbehavior and density-temperature scaling are predicted. Our results are\nconsistent with recent isochoric simulations and isobaric experiments on a\ndeeply supercooled molecular liquid. The approach can be generalized to treat\ncolloidal gelation and glass melting, and other soft matter slow dynamics\nproblems.\n", "  It is noted that the low-energy behavior of the pion-photon transition form\nfactor $F_{\\pi\\gamma}(Q^2)$ is sensitive to the transverse distribution of the\npion wavefunction, and its high-energy behavior is sensitive to the\nlongitudinal one. Thus a careful study on $F_{\\pi\\gamma}(Q^2)$ can provide\nhelpful information on the pion wavefunction precisely. In this paper, we\npresent a combined analysis of the data on $F_{\\pi\\gamma}(Q^2)$ reported by the\nCELLO, the CLEO, the BABAR and the BELLE collaborations. It is performed by\nusing the method of least squares. By using the combined measurements of BELLE\nand CLEO Collaborations, the pion wavefunction longitudinal and transverse\nbehavior can be fixed to a certain degree, i.e. we obtain $\\beta \\in\n[0.691,0.757] \\rm GeV$ and $B \\in [0.00,0.235]$ for $P_{\\chi^2} \\geq 90\\%$,\nwhere $\\beta$ and $B$ are two parameters of a convenient pion wavefunction\nmodel whose distribution amplitude can mimic the various longitudinal behavior\nunder proper choice of parameters. We observe that the CELLO, CLEO and BELLE\ndata are consistent with each other, all of which prefers the asymptotic-like\ndistribution amplitude; while the BABAR data prefers a more broad distribution\namplitude, such as the CZ-like one.\n", "  Quantum steering---a strong correlation to be verified even when one party or\nits measuring device is fully untrusted---not only provides a profound insight\ninto quantum physics but also offers a crucial basis for practical\napplications. For continuous-variable (CV) systems, Gaussian states among\nothers have been extensively studied, however, mostly confined to Gaussian\nmeasurements. While the fulfillment of Gaussian criterion is sufficient to\ndetect CV steering, whether it is also necessary for Gaussian states is a\nquestion of fundamental importance in many contexts. This critically questions\nthe validity of characterizations established only under Gaussian measurements\nlike the quantification of steering and the monogamy relations. Here, we\nintroduce a formalism based on local uncertainty relations of non-Gaussian\nmeasurements, which is shown to manifest quantum steering of some Gaussian\nstates that Gaussian criterion fails to detect. To this aim, we look into\nGaussian states of practical relevance, i.e. two-mode squeezed states under a\nlossy and an amplifying Gaussian channel. Our finding significantly modifies\nthe characteristics of Gaussian-state steering so far established such as\nmonogamy relations and one-way steering under Gaussian measurements, thus\nopening a new direction for critical studies beyond Gaussian regime.\n", "  During decades the study of networks has been divided between the efforts of\nsocial scientists and natural scientists, two groups of scholars who often do\nnot see eye to eye. In this review I present an effort to mutually translate\nthe work conducted by scholars from both of these academic fronts hoping to\ncontinue to unify what has become a diverging body of literature. I argue that\nsocial and natural scientists fail to see eye to eye because they have\ndiverging academic goals. Social scientists focus on explaining how context\nspecific social and economic mechanisms drive the structure of networks and on\nhow networks shape social and economic outcomes. By contrast, natural\nscientists focus primarily on modeling network characteristics that are\nindependent of context, since their focus is to identify universal\ncharacteristics of systems instead of context specific mechanisms. In the\nfollowing pages I discuss the differences between both of these literatures by\nsummarizing the parallel theories advanced to explain link formation and the\napplications used by scholars in each field to justify their approach to\nnetwork science. I conclude by providing an outlook on how these literatures\ncan be further unified.\n", "  Recently the four-loop perturbative QCD contributions to the relations\nbetween pole and running masses of charm, bottom and top quarks were evaluated\nin the $\\rm{\\overline{MS}}$-scheme with identical numerical error bars. In this\nwork the flavour dependence of the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$ correction to\nthese asymptotic series is obtained in the semi-analytical form with the help\nof the least squares method. The numerical structure of the corresponding\nasymptotic perturbative relations between pole and running $c$, $b$ and\n$t$-quark masses is considered and the theoretical errors of the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$-contributions are discussed. The explicit dependence\nfor these relations on the renormalization scale $\\mu^2$ and the flavour number\n$n_l$ is presented.\n", "  A wide variety of apparently contradictory piezoresistance (PZR) behaviors\nhave been reported in p-type silicon nanowires (SiNW), from the usual positive\nbulk effect to anomalous (negative) PZR and giant PZR. The origin of such a\nrange of diverse phenomena is unclear, and consequently so too is the\nimportance of a number of parameters including SiNW type (top down or bottom\nup), stress concentration, electrostatic field effects, or surface chemistry.\nHere we observe all these PZR behaviors in a single set of nominally p-type,\n$\\langle 110 \\rangle$ oriented, top-down SiNWs at uniaxial tensile stresses up\nto 0.5 MPa. Longitudinal $\\pi$-coefficients varying from $-800\\times10^{-11}$\nPa$^{-1}$ to $3000\\times10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$ are measured. Micro-Raman\nspectroscopy on chemically treated nanowires reveals that stress concentration\nis the principal source of giant PZR. The sign and an excess PZR similar in\nmagnitude to the bulk effect are related to the chemical treatment of the SiNW.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a driven-dissipative spin\nensemble with competing power-law interactions. We demonstrate that dynamical\nphase transitions as well as bistabilities can emerge for asymptotic van der\nWaals interactions, but critically rely on the presence of a slower decaying\npotential-core. Upon introducing random particle motion, we show that a finite\ngas temperature can drive a phase transition with regards to the spin degree of\nfreedom and eventually leads to mean-field behaviour in the high-temperature\nlimit. Our work reconciles contrasting observations of recent experiments with\nRydberg atoms in the cold-gas and hot-vapour domain, and introduces an\nefficient theoretical framework in the latter regime.\n", "  Oxides have many potentially desirable characteristics for thermoelectric\napplications, including low cost and stability at high temperatures, but thus\nfar there are few known high $zT$ $n$-type oxide thermoelectrics. In this work,\nwe use high-throughput first principles calculations to screen transition metal\noxides, nitrides, and sulfides for candidate materials with high power factors\nand low thermal conductivity. We find a variety of promising materials, and we\ninvestigate these materials in detail in order to understand the mechanisms\nthat cause them to have high power factors. These materials all combine a high\ndensity of states near the Fermi level with dispersive bands, reducing the\ntrade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity, but\nthey do so for several different reasons. In addition, our calculations\nindicate that many of our candidate materials have low thermal conductivity.\n", "  We consider geometric and supergravity Killing spinors and the spinor\nbilinears constructed out of them. The spinor bilinears of geometric Killing\nspinors correspond to the antisymmetric generalizations of Killing vector\nfields which are called Killing-Yano forms. They constitute a Lie superalgebra\nstructure in constant curvature spacetimes. We show that the Dirac currents of\ngeometric Killing spinors satisfy a Lie algebra structure up to a condition on\n2-form spinor bilinears. We propose that the spinor bilinears of supergravity\nKilling spinors give way to different generalizations of Killing vector fields\nto higher degree forms. It is also shown that those supergravity Killing forms\nconstitute a Lie algebra structure in six and ten dimensional cases. For five\nand eleven dimensional cases, the Lie algebra structure depends on an extra\ncondition on supergravity Killing forms.\n", "  We report some nonsmooth dynamics of a Bloch state in a one-dimensional tight\nbinding model with the periodic boundary condition. After a sudden change of\nthe potential of an arbitrary site, quantities like the survival probability of\nthe particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically, with the\nperiod being the Heisenberg time associated with the energy spectrum. This\nphenomenon is a \\emph{nonperturbative} counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics\nobserved previously (Zhang and Haque, arXiv:1404.4280) in a periodically driven\ntight binding model. Underlying the cusps is an exactly solvable model, which\nconsists of equally spaced levels extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty $,\nbetween which two arbitrary levels are coupled to each other by the same\nstrength.\n", "  We revisit the problem of a BCS superconductor in the regime where the Fermi\nenergy is smaller than the Debye energy. This regime is relevant for\nlow-density superconductors such as SrTiO$_3$ that are not in the BEC limit, as\nwell as in the problem of \"shape resonances\" associated with the confinement of\na three-dimensional superconductor. While the problem is not new, exact results\nwere lacking in the low-density limit. In two dimensions, we find that the\ninitial rise of the pairing temperature $T_c$ at low density $n$ is nonanalytic\nand faster than any power of $n$. In three dimensions, we also find that $T_c$\nis nonanalytic, but starts with zero slope at weak coupling and infinite slope\nat strong coupling. Self-consistent treatment of the chemical potential and\nenergy dependence of the density of states are crucial ingredients to obtain\nthese results. We also present exact results for multiband systems and confirm\nour analytical expressions by numerical simulations.\n", "  We develop in this article a microscopic version of the successful\nphenomenological hydrodynamic Bohr-Davydov-Faessler-Greiner (BDFG) model for\nthe collective rotation-vibration motion of a deformed nucleus. The model\nderivation is not limited to small oscillation amplitudes. The model\ngeneralizes the author's previous model to include interaction between\ncollective oscillations in each pair of spatial directions, and to remove many\nof the previous-model approximations. To derive the model, the nuclear\nSchrodinger equation is canonically transformed to collective coordinates and\nthen linearized using a constrained variational method. The associated\ntransformation constraints are imposed on the wavefunction and not on the\nparticle co-ordinates. This approach yields four self-consistent, time-reversal\ninvariant, cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the rotation-vibration and\nintrinsic motions, and a self-consistency equation. To facilitate comparison\nwith the BDFG model, simplify the solution of the equations, and gain physical\ninsight, we restrict in this article the collective oscillations to only two\nspace dimensions. For harmonic oscillator mean-field potentials, the equations\nare then solved in closed forms and applied to the ground-state rotational\nbands in some even-even light and rare-earth nuclei. The computed ground-state\nrotational band excitation energy, quadrupole moment and electric quadrupole\ntransition probabilities are found to agree favourably with measured data and\nthe results from mean-field, Sp(3,R), and SU(3) models.\n", "  Exciton-photon beats known as polariton Rabi oscillations in semiconductor\nmicrocavities are usually excited by short pulses of light. We consider a\ndifferent pumping scheme, assuming a cw pumping of the Rabi oscillator from an\nexciton reservoir. We account for the initial pulse of light setting the phase,\nexciton decay due to exciton-phonon and exciton-exciton scattering, photon\nleakage, and blueshift of the exciton resonance due to interactions. We find\nnon-trivial stationary solutions reminiscent of Kapitza pendulum, where\npolaritons are accumulated at the upper branch while the lower branch empties.\n", "  Electron switching in waveguides coupled to a photon cavity is found to be\nstrongly influenced by the photon energy and polarization. Therefore, the\ncharge dynamics in the system is investigated in two different regimes, for\noff- and on-resonant photon fields. In the off-resonant photon field, the\nphoton energy is smaller than the energy spacing between the first two lowest\nsubbands of the waveguide system, the charge splits between the waveguides\nimplementing a $\\sqrt{\\rm NOT}$-quantum logic gate action. In the on-resonant\nphoton field, the charge is totally switched from one waveguide to the other\ndue to the appearance of photon replica states of the first subband in the\nsecond subband region instigating a quantum-NOT transition.In addition, the\nimportance of the photon polarization to control the charge motion in the\nwaveguide system is demonstrated.The idea of charge switching in electronic\ncircuits may serve to built quantum bits.\n", "  It is shown that superconducting charge and phase qubits are quantum versions\nof memory capacitive and inductive systems, respectively. We demonstrate that\nsuch quantum memcapacitive and meminductive devices offer remarkable and rich\nresponse functionalities. In particular, when subjected to periodic input,\nqubit-based memcapacitors and meminductors exhibit unusual hysteresis curves.\nOur work not only extends the set of known memcapacitive and meminductive\nsystems to qubit-based quantum devices but also highlights their unique\nproperties potentially useful for future technological applications.\n", "  We study the structure of inactive states in a prototypical model glass, the\nKob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture. These inactive states are obtained\nby transition path sampling and are at dynamical phase coexistence with an\nactive equilibrium state. Configurations in the inactive states are kinetically\nstable and are located in deeper basins of the energy landscape than their\nactive counterparts. By analyzing trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations within\nthe inactive state, we assess correlations between kinetic stability, energy\nand other structural properties. We show that measures of local order\nassociated to stable local packings and bond-orientational order are weakly\ncorrelated with energy and kinetic stability. We discuss what kinds of\nstructural measurement might capture the relevant dynamical features of the\ninactive state.\n", "  Inspired by the 750 GeV diphoton state recently reported by ATLAS and CMS, we\npropose a U(1)_{B-L} extension of the MSSM which predicts the existence of four\nspin zero resonance states that are degenerate in mass in the supersymmetric\nlimit. Vector-like fields, a gauge singlet field, as well as the MSSM Higgsinos\nare prevented from acquiring arbitrary large masses by a U(1) R-symmetry.\nIndeed, these masses can be considerably lighter than the Z' gauge boson mass.\nDepending on kinematics the resonance states could decay into right handed\nneutrinos and sneutrinos, and/or MSSM Higgs fields and Higgsinos with total\ndecay widths in the multi-GeV range.\n", "  We propose a systematic magnetic-flux-free approach to detect, manipulate and\nbraid Majorana fermions in a semiconductor nanowire-based topological Josephson\njunction by utilizing the Majorana spin degree of freedom. We find an intrinsic\n$\\pi$-phase difference between spin-triplet pairings enforced by the Majorana\nzeros modes (MZMs) at the two ends of a one-dimensional spinful topological\nsuperconductor. This $\\pi$-phase is identified to be a spin-dependent\nsuperconducting phase, referred to as the spin-phase, which we show to be\ntunable by controlling spin-orbit coupling strength via electric gates. This\nelectric controllable spin-phase not only affects the coupling energy between\nMZMs but also leads to a fractional Josephson effect in the absence of any\napplied magnetic flux, which enables the efficient topological qubit readout.\nWe thus propose an all-electrically controlled superconductor-semiconductor\nhybrid circuit to manipulate MZMs and to detect their non-Abelian braiding\nstatistics properties. Our work on spin properties of topological Josephson\neffects potentially opens up a new thrust for spintronic applications with\nMajorana-based semiconductor quantum circuits.\n", "  The potential sensitivity to isospin-breaking effects makes LHC searches for\nmono-W signatures promising probes of the coupling structure between the\nStandard Model and dark matter. It has been shown, however, that the strong\nsensitivity of the mono-W channel to the relative magnitude and sign of the\nup-type and down-type quark couplings to dark matter is an artefact of\nunitarity violation. We provide three different solutions to this mono-W\nproblem in the context of spin-1 simplified models and briefly discuss the\nimpact that our findings have on the prospects of mono-W searches at future LHC\nruns.\n", "  We show that the solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a homogeneous\nand isotropic universe are given by triconfluent Heun functions for the\nspatially closed, flat, and open geometries of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse filled with different forms of energy. In a matter-dominated universe,\nwe find the polynomial solution and the energy density spectrum. In the cases\nof radiation-dominated and vacuum universes, there are no polynomial solutions\nas shown.\n", "  In a multi-wire proportional chamber detector(MWPC), the anode and signal\nwires must maintain suitable tensions, which is very important for the\ndetector's stable and perfect performance. As a result, wire tension control\nand measurement is essential in MWPC's construction. The thermal neutron\ndetector of multi-functional reflectometer at China Spallation Neutron Source\nis designed using a high pressure $^{3}$He MWPC detector, and in the\nconstruction of the detector, we developed a wire tension measurement system.\nThis system is accurate, portable and time-saving. With it, the wires' tension\non a anode wire plane has been tested, the measurement results show that the\nwire tension control techniques used in detector manufacture is reliable.\n", "  The run-and-tumble walk, consisting in randomly reoriented ballistic\nexcursions, models phenomena ranging from gas kinetics to bacteria motility. We\nevaluate the mean time required for this walk to find a fixed target within a\n2D or 3D spherical confinement. We find that the mean search time admits a\nminimum as a function of the mean run duration for various types of boundary\nconditions and run duration distributions (exponential, power-law,\ndeterministic). Our result stands in sharp contrast to the pure ballistic\nmotion, which is predicted to be the optimal search strategy in the case of\nPoisson distributed targets.\n", "  We investigate the relation between two approaches to the characterisation of\nquantum Markovianity, divisibility and lack of information backflow. We show\nthat a bijective dynamical map is completely-positive-divisible if and only if\na monotonic non-increase of distinguishability is observed for two equiprobable\nstates of the evolving system and an ancilla. Moreover our proof is\nconstructive: given any such map that is not completely-positive-divisible, we\ngive an explicit construction of two states that, when taken with the same a\npriori probability, exhibit information back-flow. Finally, while an ancilla is\nnecessary for the equivalence to hold in general, we show that it is always\npossible to witness the non-Markovianity of bijective maps without using any\nentanglement between system and ancilla.\n", "  We give a pedagogical introduction to the methodology of the Quench Action,\nwhich is an effective representation for the calculation of time-dependent\nexpectation values of physical operators following a generic out-of-equilibrium\nstate preparation protocol (for example a quantum quench). The representation,\noriginally introduced in [Caux and Essler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 257203\n(2013)], is founded on a mixture of exact data for overlaps together with\nvariational reasonings. It is argued to be quite generally valid and\nthermodynamically exact for arbitrary times after the quench (from short times\nall the way up to the steady state), and applicable to a wide class of\nphysically relevant observables. Here, we introduce the method and its\nlanguage, give an overview of some recent results, suggest a roadmap and offer\nsome perspectives on possible future research directions.\n", "  Gravitational wave (GW) source counts have been recently shown to be able to\ntest how gravitational radiation propagates with the distance from the source.\nHere, we extend this formalism to cosmological scales, i.e. the high redshift\nregime, and we discuss the complications of applying this methodology to high\nredshift sources. We also allow for models with compactified extra dimensions\nlike in the Kaluza-Klein model. Furthermore, we also consider the case of\nintermediate redshifts, i.e. $0<z\\lesssim1$, where we show it is possible to\nfind an analytical approximation for the source counts $\\frac{dN}{d(S/N)}$.\nThis can be done in terms of cosmological parameters, such as the matter\ndensity $\\Omega_{m,0}$ of the cosmological constant model or the cosmographic\nparameters for a general dark energy model. Our analysis is as general as\npossible, but it depends on two important factors: a source model for the black\nhole binary mergers and the GW source to galaxy bias. This methodology also\nallows us to obtain the higher order corrections of the source counts in terms\nof the signal-to-noise $S/N$. We then forecast the sensitivity of future\nobservations in constraining GW physics but also the underlying cosmology by\nsimulating sources distributed over a finite range of signal-to-noise with a\nnumber of sources ranging from 10 to 500 sources as expected from future\ndetectors. We find that with 500 events it will be possible to provide\nconstraints on the matter density parameter at present $\\Omega_{m,0}$ on the\norder of a few percent and with the precision growing fast with the number of\nevents. In the case of extra dimensions we find that depending on the\ndegeneracies of the model, with 500 events it may be possible to provide\nstringent limits on the existence of the extra dimensions if the aforementioned\ndegeneracies can be broken.\n", "  Recently, a braking index for the pulsar PSR J1640-4631 has been measured.\nWith a braking index of $n = 3.15 \\pm 0.03$, this pulsar has the highest\nbraking index ever measured. As it is well known, a pure magnetic dipole brake\nyields $n = 3$, whereas a pure gravitational wave brake yields $n = 5$.\nTherefore, each of these mechanisms alone can not account for the braking index\nfound for PSR J1640-4631. Here we show that such a braking index can be\naccounted for if the spindown model combines magnetic dipole and gravitational\nwave brakes. Then, we briefly discuss the detectability of this pulsar by aLIGO\nand the planned Einstein Telescope. In particular, we show that the amplitude\nof the gravitational wave that comes from our model is around a factor four\nlower than the amplitude modeled exclusively by gravitational wave energy loss.\nAnother interesting outcome of our modeling is that we are able to obtain the\nellipticity from the braking index and other pulsar parameters.\n", "  Theoretical models and spectroscopic observations of newborn stars suggest\nthat protoplantary disks have an inner \"wall\" at a distance set by the disk\ninteraction with the star. Around T Tauri stars, the size of this disk hole is\nexpected to be on a 0.1-AU scale that is unresolved by current adaptive optics\nimaging, though some model-dependent constraints have been obtained by\nnear-infrared interferometry. Here we report the first measurement of the inner\ndisk wall around a solar-mass young stellar object, YLW 16B in the {\\rho}\nOphiuchi star-forming region, by detecting the light travel time of the\nvariable radiation from the stellar surface to the disk. Consistent time lags\nwere detected on two nights, when the time series in H (1.6 {\\mu}m) and K (2.2\n{\\mu}m) bands were synchronized while the 4.5 {\\mu}m emission lagged by 74.5\n+/- 3.2 seconds. Considering the nearly edge-on geometry of the disk, the inner\nrim should be 0.084 AU from the protostar on average, with an error of order\n0.01 AU. This size is likely larger than the range of magnetospheric\ntruncations, and consistent with an optically and geometrically thick disk\nfront at the dust sublimation radius at ~1500 K. The widths of the\ncross-correlation functions between the data in different wavebands place\npossible new constraints on the geometry of the disk.\n", "  In a circuit consisting of two or more resonators, the inter-cavity crosstalk\nis inevitable, which could create some problems, such as degrading the\nperformance of quantum operations and the fidelity of various quantum states.\nThe focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for\nsimultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in\nlarge-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network\nconsisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2N resonators\nof different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system\n(qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an\neffective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple\npairs of resonators.~The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of\ninter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of\ndifferent frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator\ndispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is\nvirtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This\neffective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with\nphotonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this\nHamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR pairs of\nphotonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that\nit is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of\nfour one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting\nflux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.\n", "  The sensitivity of classical and quantum sensing is impaired in a noisy\nenvironment. Thus, one of the main challenges facing sensing protocols is to\nreduce the noise while preserving the signal. State of the art quantum sensing\nprotocols that rely on dynamical decoupling achieve this goal under the\nrestriction of long noise correlation times. We implement a proof-of-principle\nexperiment of a protocol to recover sensitivity by using an error correction\nfor photonic systems that does not have this restriction. The protocol uses a\nprotected entangled qubit to correct a single error. Our results show a\nrecovery of about 87% of the sensitivity, independent of the noise rate.\n", "  We provide an informal introduction to tensor field theories and to their\nassociated renormalization group. We focus more on the general motivations\ncoming from quantum gravity than on the technical details. In particular we\ndiscuss how asymptotic freedom of such tensor field theories gives a concrete\nexample of a natural \"quantum relativity\" postulate: physics in the deep\nultraviolet regime becomes asymptotically more and more independent of any\nparticular choice of Hilbert basis in the space of states of the universe.\n", "  This paper is devoted to a study of the connections between three different\nanalytic descriptions for the immersion functions of 2D-surfaces corresponding\nto the following three types of symmetries: gauge symmetries of the linear\nspectral problem, conformal transformations in the spectral parameter and\ngeneralized symmetries of the associated integrable system. After a brief\nexposition of the theory of soliton surfaces and of the main tool used to study\nclassical and generalized Lie symmetries, we derive the necessary and\nsufficient conditions under which the immersion formulas associated with these\nsymmetries are linked by gauge transformations. We illustrate the theoretical\nresults by examples involving the sigma model.\n", "  Exact asymptotic expressions of the uniform parts of the two-point\ncorrelation functions of bilinear spin operators in the Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chain are obtained. Apart from the\nalgebraic decay, the logarithmic contribution is identified, and the numerical\nprefactor is determined. We also confirm numerically the multiplicative\nlogarithmic correction of the staggered part of the bilinear spin operators\n$\\langle\\langle S^{a}_0S^{a}_{1}S^{b}_{r}S^{b}_{r+1} \\rangle\\rangle=(-1)^rd/(r\n\\ln^{\\frac{3}{2}}r) +(3\\delta_{a,b}-1) \\ln^2r /(12 \\pi^4 r^4)$, and estimate\nthe numerical prefactor as $d\\simeq 0.067$. The relevance of our results for\nground state fidelity susceptibility at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\nquantum phase transition points in one-dimensional systems is discussed at the\nend of our work.\n", "  We present new regular solutions of Einstein-charged scalar field theory in a\ncavity. The system is enclosed inside a reflecting mirror-like boundary, on\nwhich the scalar field vanishes. The mirror is placed at the zero of the scalar\nfield closest to the origin, and inside this boundary our solutions are\nregular. We study the stability of these solitons under linear, spherically\nsymmetric perturbations of the metric, scalar and electromagnetic fields. If\nthe radius of the mirror is sufficiently large, we present numerical evidence\nfor the stability of the solitons. For small mirror radius, some of the\nsolitons are unstable. We discuss the physical interpretation of this\ninstability.\n", "  We present a simple design to achieve bianisotropy at visible wavelengths: an\nultrathin plasmonic grating made of a gold grating covered by a thin flat layer\nof gold. We show experimentally and through simulations that the grating\nexhibits magneto-electric coupling and features asymmetric reflection and\nabsorption, all that with a device thickness of a tenth of the operating\nwavelength. We compared the spectral results and retrieved the effective\nmaterial parameters of different polarizations and devices. We show that both\nasymmetry and strong coupling between the incoming light and the optically\ninteracting surfaces are required for obtaining asymmetric optical behavior in\nmetasurfaces.\n", "  We develop a linear-response transport theory of diffusive spin and heat\ntransport by magnons in magnetic insulators with metallic contacts. The magnons\nare described by a position dependent temperature and chemical potential that\nare governed by diffusion equations with characteristic relaxation lengths.\nProceeding from a linearized Boltzmann equation, we derive expressions for\nlength scales and transport coefficients. For yttrium iron garnet (YIG) at room\ntemperature we find that long-range transport is dominated by the magnon\nchemical potential. We compare the model's results with recent experiments on\nYIG with Pt contacts [L.J. Cornelissen, et al., Nat. Phys. 11, 1022 (2015)] and\nextract a magnon spin conductivity of $\\sigma_{m}=5\\times10^{5}$ S/m. Our\nresults for the spin Seebeck coefficient in YIG agree with published\nexperiments. We conclude that the magnon chemical potential is an essential\ningredient for energy and spin transport in magnetic insulators.\n", "  The astrophysical capture process $\\alpha+d$ $\\rightarrow$ $^6$Li + $\\gamma$\nis studied in a three-body model.\n  The initial state is factorized into the deuteron bound state and the\n$\\alpha+d$ scattering state. The final nucleus $^6$Li(1+) is described as a\nthree-body bound state $\\alpha+n+p$ in the hyperspherical Lagrange-mesh method.\n  The contribution of the E1 transition operator from the initial isosinglet\nstates to the isotriplet components of the final state is estimated to be\nnegligible. An estimation of the forbidden E1 transition to the isosinglet\ncomponents of the final state is comparable with the corresponding results of\nthe two-body model.\n  However, the contribution of the E2 transition operator is found to be much\nsmaller than the corresponding estimations of the two-body model.\n  The three-body model perfectly matches the new experimental data of the LUNA\ncollaboration with the spectroscopic factor 2.586 estimated from the\nbound-state wave functions of $^6$Li and deuteron.\n", "  We present a new spectral-timing technique for phase-resolved spectroscopy\nand apply it to the low-frequency Type B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) from\nthe black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4. We show that on the QPO time-scale the\nspectrum changes not only in normalisation, but also in spectral shape. Using\nseveral different spectral models which parameterise the blackbody and\npower-law components seen in the time-averaged spectrum, we find that both\ncomponents are required to vary, although the fractional rms amplitude of\nblackbody emission is small, ~1.4 per cent compared to ~25 per cent for the\npower-law emission. However the blackbody variation leads the power-law\nvariation by ~0.3 in relative phase (~110 degrees), giving a significant break\nin the Fourier lag-energy spectrum that our phase-resolved spectral models are\nable to reproduce. Our results support a geometric interpretation for the QPO\nvariations where the blackbody variation and its phase relation to the\npower-law are explained by quasi-periodic heating of the approaching and\nreceding sides of the disc by a precessing Comptonising region. The small\namplitude of blackbody variations suggests that the Comptonising region\nproducing the QPO has a relatively large scale-height, and may be linked to the\nbase of the jet, as has previously been suggested to explain the binary orbit\ninclination-dependence of Type B QPO amplitudes.\n", "  We consider the relation between the c-completion of a Lorentz manifold V and\nits quotient M = V/G, where G is an isometry group acting freely and properly\ndiscontinuously. First, we consider the future causal completion case,\ncharacterizing virtually when such a quotient is well behaved with the future\nchronological topology and improving the existing results on the literature.\nSecondly, we show that under some general assumptions, there exists an\nhomeomorphism and chronological isomorphism between both, the c-completion of M\nand some adequate quotient of the c-completion of V defined by G. Our results\nare optimal, as we show in several examples. Finally, we give a practical\napplication by considering isometric actions over Robertson-Walker spacetimes,\nincluding in particular the Anti-de Sitter model.\n", "  The UV/optical variability of active galactic nuclei and quasars is useful\nfor understanding the physics of the accretion disk and is gradually attributed\nto the stochastic fluctuations over the accretion disk. Quasars generally\nappear bluer when they brighten in the UV/optical, the nature of which remains\ncontroversial. Recently \\citeauthor{Sun2014} discovered that the color\nvariation of quasars is timescale dependent, in the way that faster variations\nare even bluer than longer term ones. While this discovery can directly rule\nout models that simply attribute the color variation to contamination from the\nhost galaxies, or to changes in the global accretion rates, it favors the\nstochastic disk fluctuation model as fluctuations in the innermost hotter disk\ncould dominate the short-term variations. In this work, we show that a revised\ninhomogeneous disk model, where the characteristic timescales of thermal\nfluctuations in the disk are radius-dependent (i.e., $\\tau \\sim r$; based on\nthe one originally proposed by \\citeauthor{DexterAgol2011}), can well reproduce\na timescale dependent color variation pattern, similar to the observed one and\nunaffected by the un-even sampling and photometric error. This demonstrates\nthat one may statistically use variation emission at different timescales to\nspatially resolve the accretion disk in quasars, thus opens a new window to\nprobe and test the accretion disk physics in the era of time domain astronomy.\nCaveats of the current model, which ought to be addressed in future\nsimulations, are discussed.\n", "  We present a synthesis/processing method for fabricating ferrimagnetic\ninsulator (Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet) thin films with tunable magnetic\nanisotropy. Since the desired magnetic properties rely on controllable\nthickness and successful doping, we pay attention to the entire\nsynthesis/processing procedure (nanopowder synthesis, nanocrystalline target\npreparation and pulsed laser deposition (PLD)). Atomically flat films were\ndeposited by PLD on (111)-orientated yttrium aluminum garnet. We show a\nsignificant enhancement of perpendicular anisotropy in the films, caused by\nstrain-induced anisotropy. In addition, the perpendicular anisotropy is tunable\nby decreasing the film thickness and overwhelms the shape anisotropy at a\ncritical thickness of 3.5 nm.\n", "  Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) play a\npivotal role in many of the cutting edge experiments in plasmonics. EELS and CL\nexperiments are usually supported by numerical simulations, which, whilst\naccurate, may not provide as much physical insight as analytical calculations\ndo. Fully analytical solutions to EELS and CL systems in plasmonics are rare\nand difficult to obtain. This paper aims to narrow this gap by introducing a\nnew method based on Transformation optics that allows to calculate the\nquasi-static frequency and time-domain response of plasmonic particles under\nelectron beam excitation.\n", "  We present the largest collection of RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic System\nand in its foreground. The sample consists of 45 451 RR Lyr stars, of which 39\n082 were detected toward the Large Magellanic Cloud and 6369 toward the Small\nMagellanic Cloud. We provide long-term time-series photometric measurements\ncollected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing\nExperiment (OGLE-IV).\n  We discuss several potential astrophysical applications of our collection:\ninvestigation of the structure of the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic halo,\nstudies of the globular clusters in the Magellanic System, analysis of\ndouble-mode RR Lyr stars, and search for RR Lyr stars in eclipsing binary\nsystems.\n", "  One of the disadvantages of the Hamiltonian formulation is that Lorentz\ninvariance is not manifest in the former. Given a Hamiltonian, there is no\nsimple way to check whether it is relativistic or not. One would either have to\nsolve for the equations of motion or calculate the Poisson Brackets of the\nNoether charges to perform such a check. In this paper we show that, for a\nclass of Hamiltonians, it is possible to check Lorentz invariance directly from\nthe Hamiltonian. Our work is particularly useful for theories where the other\nmethods may not be readily available.\n", "  We present a sample of 59 periodic variables from the Palomar Transient\nFactory, selected from published catalogues of white dwarf (WD) candidates. The\nvariability can likely be attributed to ellipsoidal variation of the tidally\ndistorted companion induced by the gravity of the primary (WD or hot subdwarf)\nor to the reflection of hot emission by a cooler companion. We searched 11311\nspectroscopically or photometrically selected WD candidates from three hot\nstar/WD catalogues, using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to single out promising\nsources. We present period estimates for the candidates, 45 of which were not\npreviously identified as periodic variables, and find that most have a period\nshorter than a few days. Additionally, we discuss the eclipsing systems in our\nsample and present spectroscopic data on selected sources.\n", "  There is no doubt that in the coming years we will witness the renaissance of\nkaon flavour physics with crucial measurements of the branching ratios for the\nrare decays $K^+\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and\n$K_{L}\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ that are very sensitive to new physics (NP)\nand are theoretically very clean. Simultaneously the role of\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$, $\\varepsilon_K$, $\\Delta M_K$, $K_L\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nand $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$ in searching for NP will significantly increase\nthrough their improved estimates within the SM. In fact the hints for NP\ncontributing to $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ have been signalled last year\nthrough improved estimates of hadronic matrix elements of QCD and electroweak\npenguin operators $Q_6$ and $Q_8$ by lattice QCD and large $N$ dual QCD\napproach. Also recent increased tensions between $\\varepsilon_K$ and $\\Delta\nM_{s,d}$ mass differences in $B_{s,d}^0-\\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixing within the SM\nand models with constrained MFV tell us that we should have tremendous fun in\nchasing NP through all these observables. The present talk discusses the hinted\nanomalies in $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$,and $\\Delta F=2$ transitions and\nsummarizes possible implications of simultaneous anomalies in\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon_K$ for\n$K^+\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $K_{L}\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and\n$\\Delta M_K$ in models with tree-level $Z$ and $Z^\\prime$ exchanges. The\nanomalies in $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon_K$, if confirmed,\nwould signal new sources of CP violation. This is in contrast to the recent\nanomalies in $B$ physics that signal lepton flavour non-universalities and NP\nin CP-conserving observables. Highlights from recent flavour analyses of 331\nmodels are briefly described.\n", "  Bio-inspired hardware holds the promise of low-energy, intelligent and highly\nadaptable computing systems. Applications span from automatic classification\nfor big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for\nbio-medical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating\nbio-inspired hardware is building ultra-high density networks out of complex\nprocessing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices\nexploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this\ncontext. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions are well suited for this\npurpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such\nfunctionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in\nunconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when\nmemory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic\ndevices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable\nfast non-linear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single\ndevices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks\nof interacting spintronic nano-devices can have their interactions tuned to\ninduce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion,\nphase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states.\nA number of groups have recently proposed bio-inspired architectures that\ninclude one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this article we show\nhow spintronics can be used for bio-inspired computing. We review the different\napproaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and\nthe challenges towards fully integrated spintronics-CMOS (Complementary metal -\noxide - semiconductor) bio-inspired hardware.\n", "  Low-energy electron excitation spectra were measured on a single crystal of a\ntypical iron-based superconductor PrFeAsO$_{0.7}$ using resonant inelastic\nX-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Fe-$L_3$ edge. Characteristic RIXS features are\nclearly observed around 0.5, 1-1.5 and 2-3 eV energy losses. These excitations\nare analyzed microscopically with theoretical calculations using a 22-orbital\nmodel derived from first-principles electronic structure calculation. Based on\nthe agreement with the experiment, the RIXS features are assigned to Fe-$d$\norbital excitations which, at low energies, are accompanied by spin flipping\nand dominated by Fe $d_{yz}$ and $d_{xz}$ orbital characters. Furthermore, our\ncalculations suggest dispersive momentum dependence of the RIXS excitations\nbelow 0.5 eV, and predict remarkable splitting and merging of the lower-energy\nexcitations in momentum space. Those excitations, which were not observed in\nthe present experiment, highlight the potential of RIXS with an improved energy\nresolution to unravel new details of the electronic structure of the iron-based\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Clouds form on extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs where lightning could\noccur. Lightning is a tracer of atmospheric convection, cloud formation and\nionization processes as known from the Solar System, and may be significant for\nthe formation of prebiotic molecules. We study lightning climatology for the\ndifferent atmospheric environments of Earth, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. We\npresent lightning distribution maps for Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, and flash\ndensities for these planets and Venus, based on optical and/or radio\nmeasurements from the WWLLN and STARNET radio networks, the LIS/OTD satellite\ninstruments, the Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons and Venus Express spacecraft.\nWe also present flash densities calculated for several phases of two volcano\neruptions, Eyjafjallaj\\\"okull's (2010) and Mt Redoubt's (2009). We estimate\nlightning rates for sample, transiting and directly imaged extrasolar planets\nand brown dwarfs. Based on the large variety of exoplanets, six categories are\nsuggested for which we use the lightning occurrence information from the Solar\nSystem. We examine lightning energy distributions for Earth, Jupiter and\nSaturn. We discuss how strong stellar activity may support lightning activity.\nWe provide a lower limit of the total number of flashes that might occur on\ntransiting planets during their full transit as input for future studies. We\nfind that volcanically very active planets might show the largest lightning\nflash densities. When applying flash densities of the large Saturnian storm\nfrom 2010/11, we find that the exoplanet HD 189733b would produce high\nlightning occurrence even during its short transit.\n", "  This paper is the second in a pair of articles presenting data release 1\n(DR1) of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS), the\nlargest single open-time key project carried out with the Herschel Space\nObservatory. The H-ATLAS is a wide-area imaging survey carried out in five\nphotometric bands at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500$\\mu$m covering a total area of\n600deg$^2$. In this paper we describe the identification of optical\ncounterparts to submillimetre sources in DR1, comprising an area of 161 deg$^2$\nover three equatorial fields of roughly 12$^\\circ$x4.5$^\\circ$ centred at\n9$^h$, 12$^h$ and 14.5$^h$ respectively. Of all the H-ATLAS fields, the\nequatorial regions benefit from the greatest overlap with current\nmulti-wavelength surveys spanning ultraviolet (UV) to mid-infrared regimes, as\nwell as extensive spectroscopic coverage. We use a likelihood-ratio technique\nto identify SDSS counterparts at r<22.4 for 250-$\\mu$m-selected sources\ndetected at $\\geq$ 4$\\sigma$ ($\\approx$28mJy). We find `reliable' counterparts\n(reliability R$\\geq$0.8) for 44,835 sources (39 per cent), with an estimated\ncompleteness of 73.0 per cent and contamination rate of 4.7 per cent. Using\nredshifts and multi-wavelength photometry from GAMA and other public\ncatalogues, we show that H-ATLAS-selected galaxies at $z<0.5$ span a wide range\nof optical colours, total infrared (IR) luminosities, and IR/UV ratios, with no\nstrong disposition towards mid-IR-classified AGN in comparison with optical\nselection. The data described herein, together with all maps and catalogues\ndescribed in the companion paper (Valiante et al. 2016), are available from the\nH-ATLAS website at www.h-atlas.org.\n", "  A detailed study of the impact of the data collected by the European Muon\nCollaboration (EMC) on the parton distribution function (PDF) of the charm\nquark is presented. The analysis is performed in the NNPDF framework, and the\ncharm PDF is freely parametrized on equal footing as light quark and gluon\ndistributions. We find that variations in the treatment of EMC data do not\nmodify the charm PDF and do not affect our previous conclusion on the presence\nof an intrinsic component in the charm PDF.\n", "  We cross-match the two currently largest all-sky photometric catalogs,\nmid-infrared WISE and SuperCOSMOS scans of UKST/POSS-II photographic plates, to\nobtain a new galaxy sample that covers 3pi steradians. In order to characterize\nand purify the extragalactic dataset, we use external GAMA and SDSS\nspectroscopic information to define quasar and star loci in multicolor space,\naiding the removal of contamination from our extended-source catalog. After\nappropriate data cleaning we obtain a deep wide-angle galaxy sample that is\napproximately 95% pure and 90% complete at high Galactic latitudes. The catalog\ncontains close to 20 million galaxies over almost 70% of the sky, outside the\nZone of Avoidance and other confused regions, with a mean surface density of\nover 650 sources per square degree. Using multiwavelength information from two\noptical and two mid-IR photometric bands, we derive photometric redshifts for\nall the galaxies in the catalog, using the ANNz framework trained on the final\nGAMA-II spectroscopic data. Our sample has a median redshift of z_{med} = 0.2\nbut with a broad dN/dz reaching up to z>0.4. The photometric redshifts have a\nmean bias of |delta_z|~10^{-3}, normalized scatter of sigma_z = 0.033 and less\nthan 3% outliers beyond 3sigma_z. Comparison with external datasets shows no\nsignificant variation of photo-z quality with sky position. Together with the\noverall statistics, we also provide a more detailed analysis of photometric\nredshift accuracy as a function of magnitudes and colors. The final catalog is\nappropriate for `all-sky' 3D cosmology to unprecedented depths, in particular\nthrough cross-correlations with other large-area surveys. It should also be\nuseful for source pre-selection and identification in forthcoming surveys such\nas TAIPAN or WALLABY.\n", "  We present an updated constrained hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning\nalgorithm for smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) that remains\nconservative with wave cleaning speeds which vary in space and time. This is\naccomplished by evolving the quantity $\\psi / c_h$ instead of $\\psi$. Doing so\nallows each particle to carry an individual wave cleaning speed, $c_h$, that\ncan evolve in time without needing an explicit prescription for how it should\nevolve, preventing circumstances which we demonstrate could lead to runaway\nenergy growth related to variable wave cleaning speeds. This modification\nrequires only a minor adjustment to the cleaning equations and is trivial to\nadopt in existing codes. Finally, we demonstrate that our constrained\nhyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning algorithm, run for a large number of\niterations, can reduce the divergence of the field to an arbitrarily small\nvalue, achieving $\\nabla \\cdot B=0$ to machine precision.\n", "  The rock-paper-scissors game is a paradigmatic model for biodiversity, with\napplications ranging from microbial populations to human societies. Research\nhas shown, however, that mobility jeopardizes biodiversity by promoting the\nformation of spiral waves, especially if there is no conservation law in place\nfor the total number of competing players. Firstly, we show that even if such a\nconservation law applies, mobility still jeopardizes biodiversity in the\nspatial rock-paper-scissors game if only a small fraction of links of the\nsquare lattice is randomly rewired. Secondly, we show that zealots are very\neffective in taming the amplitude of oscillations that emerge due to mobility\nand/or interaction randomness, and this regardless of whether the later is\nquenched or annealed. While even a tiny fraction of zealots brings significant\nbenefits, at 5\\% occupancy zealots practically destroy all oscillations\nregardless of the intensity of mobility, and regardless of the type and\nstrength of randomness in the interaction structure. Interestingly, by annealed\nrandomness the impact of zealots is qualitatively the same as by mobility,\nwhich highlights that fast diffusion does not necessarily destroy the\ncoexistence of species, and that zealotry thus helps to recover the stable\nmean-field solution. Our results strengthen the important role of zealots in\nmodels of cyclic dominance, and they reveal fascinating evolutionary outcomes\nin structured populations that are a unique consequence of such uncompromising\nbehavior.\n", "  This study is an introduction to the theory of three-dimensional\nconsolidation. The point of departure in the description are the basic\nequations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in\nterms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle\nof effective stress, and the law of Darcy for fluid flow in porous media. These\nequations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only\npremises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. Next,\nthe increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -\nwith its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass\nbalance. Pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced\nand useful relations are proven. Where appropriate, the physical meaning of\nthese coefficients is proven mathematically. Equations of equilibrium and fluid\nmass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid\ncontent and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of\nconsolidation theory. Thus the initial approach of using drained description is\nextended to the formalism of Rice and Cleary. This approach to\nthree-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. It does not\nrequire the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy\npotential. Instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts\nfor the coupling of skeletal deformations and fluid behaviour.\n", "  This is the stars chapter of the Kavli workshop report, which resulted from\nthe community-based study of needed US OIR capabilities in the LSST era. The\nfull report, which will include this chapter, is anticipated to be available in\nFall 2016. See NOAO website (http://www.noao.edu/meetings/lsst-oir-study/) for\nmore details.\n", "  This paper presents Gemini-$gri'$ high quality photometry for cluster\ncandidates in the field of NGC 1316 (Fornax A) as part of a study that also\nincludes GMOS spectroscopy. A preliminary discussion of the photometric data\nindicates the presence of four stellar cluster populations with distinctive\nfeatures in terms of age, chemical abundance and spatial distribution. Two of\nthem seem to be the usually old (metal poor and metal rich) populations\ntypically found in elliptical galaxies. In turn, an intermediate-age (5 Gyr)\nglobular cluster population is the dominant component of the sample (as\nreported by previous papers). We also find a younger cluster population with a\ntentative age of $\\approx$ 1 Gyr.\n", "  This paper describes Comments to the paper of Mrowiec et al. published in the\nJ. Atmos. Sci. in May 2016 (Vol 73, Issue 5, pages 1857-1870) and entitled\n\"Isentropic analysis of a simulated hurricane\".\n  It is explained that the plotting of isentropic surfaces (namely the\nisentropes) requires a precise definition of the specific moist-air entropy,\nand that most of existing \"equivalent potential temperatures\" lead to\ninaccurate definitions of isentropes.\n  It is shown that the use of the third law of thermodynamics leads to a\ndefinition of the specific moist-air entropy (and of a corresponding potential\ntemperature) which allow the plotting of unambigous moist-air isentropes.\n  Numerical applications are shown by using a numerical simulation of the\nhurricane DUMILE.\n", "  The effect of the Fe-Ga ratio on the magnetic and electric properties of the\nmultiferroic Ga2-xFexO3 compound has been studied in order to determine the\ncomposition range exhibiting magnetic and electric orders coexistence and their\ncritical temperatures. A magnetoelectric phase diagram, showing the evolution\nof both the Neel magnetic ordering temperature and the electric ordering\ntemperature, versus the iron content has been established for x values between\n0.9 and 1.4. While the ferrimagnetic Neel temperature increases with the iron\ncontent, the electric ordering temperature shows an opposite trend. The\nelectric polarization has been found to exist far above room temperature for\nthe x value of 1.1 composition which shows the highest observed electric\nordering temperature of approx. 580K. The compounds with x values of 1.3 and\n1.4 are ferrimagnetic-electric relaxors with both properties coexisting at room\ntemperature.\n", "  We present models of wormhole under the Finslerian structure of spacetime.\nThis is a sequel of our previous work (Eur Phys J 75:564, 2015) where we\nconstructed a toy model for compact stars based on the Finslerian spacetime\ngeometry. In the present investigation, a wide variety of solutions are\nobtained that explore wormhole geometry by considering different choices for\nthe form function and energy density. The solutions, like the previous work,\nare revealed to be physically interesting and viable models for the explanation\nof wormholes as far as the background theory and literature are concerned.\n", "  The quest for an integrated light source that promises high energy efficiency\nand fast modulation for high-performance photonic circuits has led to the\ndevelopment of room-temperature telecom-wavelength nanoscale laser with high\nspontaneous emission factors, \\beta. The coherence characterization of this\ntype of lasers is inherently difficult with the conventional measurement of\noutput light intensity versus input pump intensity due to the diminishing kink\nin the measurement curve. We demonstrate the transition from chaotic to\ncoherent emission of a high-{\\beta} pulse-pump metallo-dielectric nanolaser can\nbe determined by examining the width of a second order intensity correlation\npeak, which shrinks below and broadens above threshold. Photon fluctuation\nstudy, first one ever reported for this type of nanolaser, confirms the\nvalidity of this measurement technique. Additionally, we show that the width\nvariation above threshold results from the delayed threshold phenomenon,\nproviding the first indirect observation of dynamical hysteresis in a\nnanolaser.\n", "  We present a rotary-stage microwave probe station suitable for magnetic films\nand spintronic devices. Two stages, one for field rotation from parallel to\nperpendicular to the sample plane (Out-of-Plane) and the other intended for\nfield rotation within the sample plane (In-Plane) have been designed. The\nsample, probes and micro positioners are rotated simultaneously with the\nstages, which allows the field orientation to cover $\\theta$ from 0 to\n$90^{\\circ}$ and $\\varphi$ from 0 to $360^{\\circ}$. $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$\nbeing the angle between the direction of current flow and field in a\nOut-of-Plane and an In-Plane rotation, respectively. The operation frequency is\nup to 40 GHz and the magnetic field up to 1 T. The sample holder, vision system\nand probe assembly are compactly designed for the probes to land on a wafer\nwith diameter up to 3$\\,$cm. Using homemade multi-pin probes and commercially\navailable high frequency probes, several applications including 4-probe DC\nmeasurements, the determination of domain wall velocity and spin transfer\ntorque ferromagnetic resonance are demonstrated.\n", "  In this letter we investigate the role played by quantum mechanics before the\nbig-bang in heterotic-M-theory assuming an orbifold compactification of time.\nAs we will see particles are localized around a black hole but only in regions\nwhere a constructive quantum interference takes place. We infer that the\ncreation of this interference pattern is interesting for many reasons: (A) it\nis a mechanism to localize particles on $S^4$ branes; (B) the Casimir potential\nfor the dilaton can be interpreted as a gravitational effective potential for a\ntwo-body problem; (C) the quantum interference is a new way to define the\nbranes in heterotic-M-theory. Remarkably, a modified Schroedinger equation is\nobtained. The stabilization of the branes' position is related to the absence\nof a cosmological singularity.\n", "  Single-photon stimulated four wave mixing (StFWM) processes have great\npotential for photonic quantum information processing, compatible with optical\ncommunication technologies and integrated optoelectronics. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate single-photon StFWM process in a piece of optical fiber, with\nseeded photons generated by spontaneous four wave mixing process (SpFWM). The\neffect of the single-photon StFWM is confirmed by time-resolved four-photon\ncoincidence measurement and variation of four-photon coincidence counts under\ndifferent seed-pump delays. According to the experiment results, the potential\nperformance of quantum cloning machine based on the process is analyzed.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically the coexistence of Dirac semimetal and\ntopological insulator phases in InSb/$\\alpha$-Sn conventional semiconductor\nsuperlattices, based on advanced first-principles calculations combined with\nlow-energy $k\\cdot p$ theory. By proper interfaces designing, a large interface\npolarization emerges when the growth direction is chosen along {[}111{]}. Such\nan intrinsic polarized electrostatic field reduces band gap largely and invert\nthe band structure finally, leading to emerge of the topological Dirac\nsemimetal phase with a pair of Dirac nodes appearing along the (111)\ncrystallographic direction near the $\\Gamma$ point. The surface states and\nFermi arc are clearly observed in (100) projected surface. In addition, we also\nfind a two-dimensional topological insulator phase with large nontrivial band\ngap approaching 70 meV, which make it possible to observe the quantum spin Hall\neffect at room temperature. Our proposal paves a way to realize topological\nnontrivial phases coexisted in conventional semiconductor superlattices by\nproper interface designing.\n", "  We explore the possibility of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in 5D\nconformally invariant gravity, whose action consists of a scalar field\nnonminimally coupled to the curvature with its potential. Performing\ndimensional reduction via ADM decomposition, we find that the model allows an\nexact solution giving rise to the 4D Minkowski vacuum. Exploiting the conformal\ninvariance with Gaussian warp factor, we show that it also admits a solution\nwhich implement the spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry. We investigate\nits stability by performing the tensor perturbation and find the resulting\nsystem is described by the conformal quantum mechanics. Possible applications\nto the spontaneous symmetry breaking of time-translational symmetry along the\ndynamical fifth direction and the brane-world scenario are discussed.\n", "  Recent data on the critical events accompanying the quenching of the\npseudogap (PG) phase in hole-doped cuprates are analysed. An original multiband\nmodel with the spectrum influenced by doping has been used. Two critical\ndopings are expected in evolving of the PG to destruction. The first of them\ncorresponds to metallization (antinodal) of the sample. Extended doping leads\nto a second critical point where the PG is lost. In between the restoration of\nthe full Fermi surface proceeds. Band overlaps besides the location of the\nchemical potential ({\\mu}) are decisive.\n", "  We revisit the computation of the phase space factors (PSF) involved in the\npositron decay and electron capture (EC) processes for a large number of nuclei\nof experimental interest. To obtain the electron/positron wave functions needed\nin computation, we develop a code for solving accurately the Dirac equation\nwith a nuclear potential derived from a realistic proton density distribution\nin the nucleus. The finite nuclear size (FNS) and screening effects are\nincluded through recipes which differ from those used in previous calculations.\nComparing our results with former calculations employing approximate methods\nbut computed with the same Q-values, we find a close agreement for positron\ndecays, while for the EC process there are relevant differences. For the EC\nprocess we also find that the screening effect has a notable influence on the\ncomputed PSF values specially for light nuclei. Further, we re-computed the\nsame PSF values but using the most recent Q-values reported in literature. In\nseveral cases these new Q-values differ significantly from the older ones,\nwhich results in large differences in the PSF values as compared with previous\nresults. These new PSF values proposed here, can contribute to a more reliable\ncalculation of the beta decay rates, which are key quantities in the study of\nnuclei far from the stability line, as well as to better understanding of the\nstellar evolution.\n", "  We have considered the effect of different spin-orbit interaction mechanisms\non the process of demagnetization under the influence of short-pulse lasers.\nAll-optical magnetization reversal of perpendicularly magnetized thin films can\noccur if there are sufficient strong spin-Hall, skew scattering, and Rashba\ninteractions. In the presence of spin-orbit interactions, the transient charge\ncurrents provide the generation of transverse-spin currents and accumulations,\nwhich eventually exert spin-transfer torque on the magnetization. By combining\nthe optically excited spin-dependent diffusive transport with the spin and\ncharge currents due to skew scattering, spin-Hall, inverse spin-Hall and Rashba\ninteractions, into a numerical model, we demonstrate a possibility of\nultra-fast all-optical magnetization reversal. This understanding provokes\nintriguing, more in-depth experimental studies on the role of spin-orbit\ninteraction mechanisms in optimizing structures for all-optical magnetization\nreversal.\n", "  We study the potential of the next $ep$ collider, namely LHeC, with two\noptions $\\sqrt{s}=1.3$ TeV $\\sqrt{s}=1.98$ TeV, to search for excited spin-1/2\nand spin-3/2 neutrinos. We calculate the single production cross section of\nexcited spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 neutrinos according to their effective currents\ndescribing their interactions between gauge bosons and SM leptons. We choose\nthe $\\nu^{\\star}\\rightarrow eW$ decay mode of excited neutrinos and\n$W\\rightarrow jj$ decay mode of $W$-boson for the analysis. We put some\nkinematical cuts for the final state detectable particles and plot the\ninvariant mass distributions for signal and the corresponding backgrounds. In\norder to obtain accessible limits for excited neutrino couplings, we show the\n$f-f^{\\prime}$ and $c_{iV}-c_{iA}$ contour plots for excited spin-1/2 and\nexcited spin-3/2 neutrinos, respectively.\n", "  To understand complex physics of a system with strong electron electron\ninteractions, it is ideal to control and monitor its properties while tuning an\nexternal electric field applied to the system. Indeed, complete electric field\ncontrol of many body states in strongly correlated electron systems is\nfundamental to the next generation of condensed matter research and devices.\nHowever, the material must be thin enough to avoid shielding of the electric\nfield in bulk material. Two-dimensional materials do not experience electrical\nscreening, and their charge carrier density can be controlled by gating. 1T\nTiSe2 is a prototypical 2D material that shows charge density wave(CDW) and\nsuperconductivity in its phase diagram, presenting several similarities with\nother layered systems such as copper oxides, iron pnictides, crystals of\nrare-earth and actinide atoms. By studying 1T TiSe2 single crystals with\nthicknesses of 10 nm or less, encapsulated in 2D layers of hexagonal boron\nnitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition temperature,\ntuned from 170 K to 40 K, and over the superconductivity transition\ntemperature, tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 K up to 3 K. Electrically\ndriving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases allows us to study the\ndetails of the phase transitions between many-body states. Observations of\nperiodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the Little Parks effect\nshow that the appearance of superconductivity is directly correlated to the\nspatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the superconductivity order\nparameter, corresponding to a 2D matrix of superconductivity. We infer that\nthis superconductivity matrix is supported by a matrix of incommensurate CDW\nstates embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our results show that spatially\nmodulated electronic states are fundamental to the appearance of 2D\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We discuss how to search for a possibe signal of the recently observed 750\nGeV enhancement in the diphoton channel in the four-jet production. In the\npresent studies we assume that the produced state is pseudoscalar. This fact,\nwhen combined with specificity of the corresponding amplitude, allows to\nimprove the signal-to-background (S/B) ratio. We discuss in detail how to\nimpose cuts on jets in rapidity and transverse momenta in order to find optimal\nS/B ratio and not to loose too much statistics. Our study suggest a measurement\nof two soft (low cut on $p_t$) large-rapidity jets and two hard (high cut on\n$p_t$) mid-rapidity jets. Azimuthal correlation between the soft external jets\nmay be useful to further improve the situation. Several differential\ndistributions in rapidities and transverse momenta of jets as well as dijet\ninvariant mass are shown. The integrated cross sections corresponding to\ndifferent cuts are collected in a table and number of events are presented.\n", "  In this paper, static electrically charged black hole solutions with\ncosmological constant are investigated in an Einstein-Hilbert theory of gravity\nwith additional quadratic curvature terms. Beside the analytic Schwarzschild\n(Anti-) de Sitter solutions, non-Schwarzschild (Anti-) de Sitter solutions are\nalso obtained numerically by employing the shooting method. The results show\nthat there exist two groups of asymptotically (Anti-) de Sitter spacetimes for\nboth charged and uncharged black holes. In particular, it was found that for\nuncharged black holes the first group can be reduced to the Schwarzschild\n(Anti-) de Sitter solution, while the second group is intrinsically different\nfrom a Schwarzschild (Anti-) de Sitter solution even when the charge and the\ncosmological constant become zero.\n", "  We obtained exact solutions for the wave function and the Green function in\nthe slow light pulse with the group velocity, consistent with the Fermi\nvelocity in graphene.\n", "  Casimir effects manifests that, the two closely paralleled plates, generally\nproduce a macroscopic attractive force due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations\nof the electromagnetic fields. The derivation of the force requires an {\\it\nartificial} regulator by removing the divergent summation. By including\nnaturally a spectrum density factor, based on the observation that an\nincomplete eigenvectors of observable, such as the eigenstates for the photons\nin the free field, can form a complete set of eigenvectors by introducing a\nunique spectrum transformation, an alternative way is presented to rederive the\nforce, without using a regulator. As a result, the Casimir forces are obtained\nwith the first term $-\\pi^2 \\hbar c/(240 a^4)$ attractive, and the second one,\n$-\\pi^4 \\hbar c^3 \\sigma^2/(1008 a^6)$, also attractive but smaller, with $a$\nthe plate separation, and $\\sigma$ a to-be-determined small constant number in\nthe spectrum density factor.\n", "  A model for Pomeron-Pomeron total cross section in the resonance region\n$\\sqrt{M^{2}} \\le$ 5 GeV is presented. This model is based on Regge poles from\nthe Pomeron and two different $f$ trajectories, and includes the isolated\nf$_{0}(500)$ resonance in the region $\\sqrt{M^{2}}\\lesssim 1$ GeV. A slowly\nvarying background is included. The presented Pomeron-Pomeron cross section is\nnot directly measurable, but is an essential ingredient for calculating\nexclusive resonance production at the LHC.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a class of\nspherically symmetric potentials in a simple and unified manner using the Lie\nalgebraic approach within the framework of quasi-exact solvability. We\nillustrate that all models give rise to the same basic differential equation,\nwhich is expressible as an element of the universal enveloping algebra of\nsl(2). Then, we obtain the general exact solutions of the problem by employing\nthe representation theory of sl(2) Lie algebra.\n", "  The effects of social groups on pedestrian dynamics, especially in evacuation\nscenarios, have attracted some interest recently. However, due to the lack of\nreliable empirical data, most of the studies focussed on modelling aspects. It\nwas shown that social groups can have a considerable effect, e.g. on evacuation\ntimes. In order to test the model predictions we have performed laboratory\nexperiments of evacuations with different types and sizes of the social groups.\nThe experiments have been performed with pupils of different ages. Parameters\nthat have been considered are (1) group size, (2) strength of intra-group\ninteractions, and (3) composition of the groups (young adults, children, and\nmixtures). For all the experiments high-quality trajectories for all\nparticipants have been obtained using the PeTrack software. This allows for a\ndetailed analysis of the group effects. One surprising observation is a\ndecrease of the evacuation time with increasing group size.\n", "  Electrical conductivity of finite-temperature plasma in neutron star crusts\nis studied for applications in magneto-hydrodynamical description of compact\nstars. We solve the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation\ntaking into account the anisotropy of transport due to the magnetic field, the\neffects of dynamical screening in the scattering matrix element and corre-\nlations among the nuclei. We show that conductivity has a minimum at a non-zero\ntemperature, a low-temperature decrease and a power-law increase with\nincreasing temperature. Selected numerical results are shown for matter\ncomposed of carbon, iron, and heavier nuclei present in the outer crusts of\nneutron star.\n", "  We present a measurement of the cosmogenic activation in the germanium\ncryogenic detectors of the EDELWEISS III direct dark matter search experiment.\nThe decay rates measured in detectors with different exposures to cosmic rays\nabove ground are converted into production rates of different isotopes. The\nmeasured production rates in units of nuclei/kg/day are 82 $\\pm$ 21 for $^3$H,\n2.8 $\\pm$ 0.6 for $^{49}$V, 4.6 $\\pm$ 0.7 for $^{55}$Fe, and 106 $\\pm$ 13 for\n$^{65}$Zn. These results are the most accurate for these isotopes. A lower\nlimit on the production rate of $^{68}$Ge of 74 nuclei/kg/day is also\npresented. They are compared to model predictions present in literature and to\nestimates calculated with the ACTIVIA code.\n", "  Composite dark matter (DM) comprised of electrically charged constituents can\ninteract with the electromagnetic field via the particle's dipole moment. This\ninteraction results in a dispersive optical index of refraction for the DM\nmedium. We compute this refractive index for atomic dark matter and more\nstrongly bound systems, modeled via a harmonic oscillator potential. The\ndispersive nature of the index will result in a time lag between high and low\nenergy photons simultaneously emitted from a distant astrophysical observable.\nThis time lag, due to matter dispersion, could confound potential claims of\nLorentz invariance violation (LIV) which can also result in such time lags. We\ncompare the relative size of the two effects and determine that the dispersion\ndue to DM is dwarfed by potential LIV effects for energies below the Planck\nscale.\n", "  We use experimental limits on Lorentz violation to obtain new constraints on\nKaluza-Klein-type theories in which the extra dimensions may be large but do\nnot necessarily have units of length. The associated variation in fundamental\nquantities such as rest mass must occur slowly, on cosmological scales.\n", "  Pre-class reading assignments help prepare students for active classes by\nproviding a first exposure to the terms and concepts to be used during class.\nWe investigate if the use of inquiry-oriented PhET-based activities in\nconjunction with pre-class reading assignments can improve both the preparation\nof students for in-class learning and student attitudes towards and engagement\nwith pre-class assignments. Over three course modules covering different\ntopics, students were assigned randomly to complete either a textbook-only\npre-class assignment or both a textbook pre-class assignment and a PhET-based\nactivity. The assignments helped prepare students for class, as measured by\nperformance on the pre-class quiz relative to a beginning-of-semester pre-test,\nbut no evidence for increased learning due the PhET activity was observed.\nStudents rated the assignments which included PhET as more enjoyable and, for\nthe topic latest in the semester, reported engaging more with the assignments\nwhen PhET was included.\n", "  We study the interplay between collective and individual optically-induced\nmagnetic responses in quadrumers made of identical dielectric nanoparticles.\nUnlike their plasmonic counterparts, all-dielectric nanoparticle clusters are\nshown to exhibit multiple dimensions of resonant magnetic responses that can be\nemployed for the realization of anomalous scattering signatures. We focus our\nanalysis on symmetric quadrumers made from silicon nanoparticles and verify our\ntheoretical results in proof-of-concept radio frequency experiments\ndemonstrating the existence of a novel type of magnetic Fano resonance in\nnanophotonics.\n", "  Developing accurate solvers for the Poisson Boltzmann (PB) model is the first\nstep to make the PB model suitable for implicit solvent simulation. Reducing\nthe grid size influence on the performance of the solver benefits to increasing\nthe speed of solver and providing accurate electrostatics analysis for solvated\nmolecules. In this work, we explore the accurate coarse grid PB solver based on\nthe Green's function treatment of the singular charges, matched interface and\nboundary (MIB) method for treating the geometric singularities, and posterior\nelectrostatic potential field extension for calculating the reaction field\nenergy. We made our previous PB software, MIBPB, robust and provides almost\ngrid size independent reaction field energy calculation. Large amount of the\nnumerical tests verify the grid size independence merit of the MIBPB software.\nThe advantage of MIBPB software directly make the acceleration of the PB solver\nfrom the numerical algorithm instead of utilization of advanced computer\narchitectures. Furthermore, the presented MIBPB software is provided as a free\nonline sever.\n", "  For a harmonic oscillator, Nos\\'e's single-thermostat approach to simulating\nGibbs' canonical ensemble with dynamics samples only a small fraction of the\nphase space. Nos\\'e's approach has been improved in a series of three steps: [\n1 ] several two-thermostat sets of motion equations have been found which cover\nthe complete phase space in an ergodic fashion, [ 2 ] sets of single-thermostat\nmotion equations, exerting \"weak control\" over both forces and momenta, have\nbeen shown to be ergodic, and [ 3 ] sets of single-thermostat motion equations\nexerting weak control over two velocity moments provide ergodic phase-space\nsampling for the oscillator and for the rigid pendulum, but not for the quartic\noscillator or for the Mexican Hat potential. The missing fourth step, motion\nequations providing ergodic sampling for anharmonic potentials requires a\nfurther advance. The 2016 Ian Snook Prize will be awarded to the author(s) of\nthe most interesting original submission addressing the problem of finding\nergodic algorithms for Gibbs' canonical ensemble using a single thermostat.\n", "  The threading of a polymer chain through a small pore is a classic problem in\npolymer dynamics and underlies nanopore sensing technology. However important\nexperimental aspects of the polymer motion in a solid-state nanopore, such as\nan accurate measurement of the velocity variation during translocation, have\nremained elusive. In this work we analysed the translocation through conical\nquartz nanopores of a 7 kbp DNA double-strand labelled with six markers equally\nspaced along its contour. These markers, constructed from DNA hairpins, give\ndirect experimental access to the translocation dynamics. On average we measure\na 5% reduction in velocity during the translocation. We also find a striking\ncorrelation in velocity fluctuations with a decay constant of 100s of {\\mu}s.\nThese results shed light on hitherto unresolved problems in the dynamics of DNA\ntranslocation and provide guidance for experiments seeking to determine\npositional information along a DNA strand.\n", "  Fast oxygen transport materials are necessary for a range of technologies,\nincluding efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation\nmembranes, oxygen sensors, chemical looping devices, and memristors. Strain is\noften proposed as a method to enhance the performance of oxygen transport\nmaterials, but the magnitude of its effect and its underlying mechanisms are\nnot well-understood, particularly in the widely-used perovskite-structured\noxygen conductors. This work reports on an ab initio prediction of strain\neffects on migration energetics for nine perovskite systems of the form LaBO3,\nwhere B = [Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ga]. Biaxial strain, as might be\neasily produced in epitaxial systems, is predicted to lead to approximately\nlinear changes in migration energy. We find that tensile biaxial strain reduces\nthe oxygen vacancy migration barrier across the systems studied by an average\nof 66 meV per percent strain for a single selected hop, with a low of 36 and a\nhigh of 89 meV decrease in migration barrier per percent strain across all\nsystems. The estimated range for the change in migration barrier within each\nsystem is approximately 25 meV per percent strain when considering all hops.\nThese results suggest that strain can significantly impact transport in these\nmaterials, e.g., a 2% tensile strain can increase the diffusion coefficient by\nabout three orders of magnitude at 300 K (one order of magnitude at 500 {\\deg}C\nor 773 K) for one of the most strain-responsive materials calculated here\n(LaCrO3). We show that a simple elasticity model, which assumes only dilative\nor compressive strain in a cubic environment and a fixed migration volume, can\nqualitatively but not quantitatively model the strain dependence of the\nmigration energy, suggesting that factors not captured by continuum elasticity\nplay a significant role in the strain response.\n", "  We have studied neuronal synchronisation in a random network of adaptive\nexponential integrate-and-fire neurons. We study how spiking or bursting\nsynchronous behaviour appears as a function of the coupling strength and the\nprobability of connections, by constructing parameter spaces that identify\nthese synchronous behaviours from measurements of the inter-spike interval and\nthe calculation of the order parameter. Moreover, we verify the robustness of\nsynchronisaton by applying an external perturbation to each neuron. The\nsimulations show that bursting synchronisation is more robust than spike\nsynchronisation.\n", "  We study an inverse problem for the wave equation where localized wave\nsources in random scattering media are to be determined from time resolved\nmeasurements of the waves at an array of receivers. The sources are far from\nthe array, so the measurements are affected by cumulative scattering in the\nmedium, but they are not further than a transport mean free path, which is the\nlength scale characteristic of the onset of wave diffusion that prohibits\ncoherent imaging. The inversion is based on the Coherent Interferometric (CINT)\nimaging method which mitigates the scattering effects by introducing an\nappropriate smoothing operation in the image formation. This smoothing\nstabilizes statistically the images, at the expense of their resolution. We\ncomplement the CINT method with a convex ($l_1$) optimization in order to\nimprove the source localization and obtain quantitative estimates of the source\nintensities. We analyze the method in a regime where scattering can be modeled\nby large random wavefront distortions, and quantify the accuracy of the\ninversion in terms of the spatial separation of individual sources or clusters\nof sources. The theoretical predictions are demonstrated with numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  The Angstrom-scale transport characteristics of water and six different\nsolutes, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, urea, Na+, and Cl-, were studied for a\npolyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, FT-30, using non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics (NEMD) simulations. Results indicate that water transport increases\nwith an increasing fraction of connected percolated free volume, or\nwater-accessible open space, in the membrane polymer structure. This free\nvolume is enhanced by the dynamic structure of the membrane at the molecular\nlevel as it swells when hydrated and vibrates due to molecular collisions\nallowing a continuous path connecting the opposite membrane surfaces. The\ntortuous paths available for transport of solutes result in Brownian motion of\nsolute molecules and hopping from pore to pore as they pass through the polymer\nnetwork structure of the membrane. The transport of alcohol solutes decreases\nfor solutes with larger Van der Waals volume, which corresponds to less\navailable percolated free volume, or solute-accessible space, within the\nmembrane polymer structure. However, the Van der Waals size of the dehydrated\nsolutes is generally not a good measure to predict solute transport or\nrejection. Urea has reduced transport compared to ethanol, most likely due to\nmore complex chemistry, even though urea has a smaller Van der Waals volume\nthan ethanol. Na+ and Cl- experience the lowest transport, likely due to strong\nion-water and ion-ion electrostatic interactions.\n"]}
