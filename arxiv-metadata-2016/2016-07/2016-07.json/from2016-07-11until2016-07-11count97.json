In particular we observe spatially localized\ncollapse and revival of Ramsey fringe contrast and show how the pattern of\ncoherence depends on strength of the spin wave excitation. We find that the\nspatial character of the coherence dynamics is incompatible with a simple model\nbased only on position-space overlap of wave functions. This phenomenon\nrequires a full phase-space description of the atomic spin using a quantum\nBoltzmann transport equation, which highlights spin wave-induced coherent spin\ncurrents and the ensuing dynamics they drive.\n", "  The effect of epitaxial strain on the phonon spectra, crystal structure,\nspontaneous polarization, dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic properties of\n(001)-oriented ferroelectric (BaTiO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices ($m\n= n = {}$1-4) was studied using the first-principles density-functional theory.\nThe ground state of free-standing superlattices is the monoclinic $Cm$ polar\nphase. Under the in-plane biaxial compressive strain, it transforms to\ntetragonal $P4mm$ polar phase, and under the in-plane biaxial tensile strain,\nit transforms to orthorhombic $Amm2$ polar phase. When changing the in-plane\nlattice parameter, a softening of several optical and acoustic modes appears at\nthe boundaries between the polar phases, and corresponding components of\ndielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors diverge critically. The\ncomparison of the mixing enthalpy of disordered Ba$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$\nsolid solution modeled using two special quasirandom structures SQS-4 with the\nmixing enthalpy of the superlattices reveals a tendency of the\nBaTiO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ system to short-range ordering and shows that these\nsuperlattices are thermodynamically quite stable.\n", "  We consider random walks that start and are absorbed on the leaves of random\nnetworks and study the length of such walks. For the networks we investigate,\nErdos-Renyi random graphs and Barabasi-Albert scale free networks, these walks\nare not transient and we consider various approaches to computing the\nprobability of a given length walk.One approach is to label nodes according to\nboth their total degree and the number of links connected to leaf nodes, and as\na byproduct we compute the probability of a random node of a scale free network\nhaving such a label.\n", "  With the largest spectroscopic galaxy survey volume drawn from the SDSS-III\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), we can extract cosmological\nconstraints from the measurements of redshift and geometric distortions at\nquasi-linear scales (e.g. above 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc). We analyze the broad-range\nshape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions of the BOSS Data\nRelease 12 (DR12) CMASS galaxy sample, at the effective redshift $z=0.59$, to\nobtain constraints on the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$, the angular-diameter\ndistance $D_A(z)$, the normalized growth rate $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$, and the\nphysical matter density $\\Omega_mh^2$. We obtain robust measurements by\nincluding a polynomial as the model for the systematic errors, and find it\nworks very well against the systematic effects, e.g., ones induced by stars and\nseeing. We provide accurate measurements $\\{D_A(0.59)r_{s,fid}/r_s$ $\\rm Mpc$,\n$H(0.59)r_s/r_{s,fid}$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, $f(0.59)\\sigma_8(0.59)$, $\\Omega_m\nh^2\\}$ = $\\{1427\\pm26$, $97.3\\pm3.3$, $0.488 \\pm 0.060$, $0.135\\pm0.016\\}$,\nwhere $r_s$ is the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch and\n$r_{s,fid}=147.66$ Mpc is the sound scale of the fiducial cosmology used in\nthis study. The parameters which are not well constrained by our galaxy\nclustering analysis are marginalized over with wide flat priors. Since no\npriors from other data sets, e.g., cosmic microwave background (CMB), are\nadopted and no dark energy models are assumed, our results from BOSS CMASS\ngalaxy clustering alone may be combined with other data sets, i.e., CMB, SNe,\nlensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parameters of a given\ncosmological model. The uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state\nparameter, $w$, from CMB+CMASS is about 8 per cent. The uncertainty on the\ncurvature fraction, $\\Omega_k$, is 0.3 per cent. We do not find deviation from\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Enabling perfect light absorption in ultrathin materials promises the\ndevelopment of exotic photonic devices. Here we demonstrate new strategies that\ncan provide capabilities to rationally design ultrathin (thickness <\n{\\lambda}/10~{\\lambda}/5) semiconductor perfect absorbers for arbitrary\nwavelengths, including those at which the intrinsic absorption of the\nsemiconductor is weak, e.g. Si for near-IR wavelengths. This is in stark\ncontrast with the existing studies on ultrathin perfect absorbers, which have\nfocused on metallic materials or highly-absorptive semiconductors. Our design\nstrategies are built upon an intuitive model, coupled leaky mode theory that we\nrecently developed and can turn the design for perfect absorbers to the design\nfor leaky modes. The designed absorber is featured with extraordinary\nabsorption enhancement, miniaturized dimension, and high selectivity for the\nwavelength, polarization, and angle of incident light. It can enable the\ndevelopment of flexible, light-weight, high-performance, cost-effective, and\nmultifunctional optoelectronic devices that are difficult with current light\nabsorbers.\n", "  Many approaches of coarse-graining have been developed under the names of\nCosserat theory or polar-fluid theory, for those materials in which some\ncomponent elements undergo non-affine deformations, such as elastic materials\nwith inclusions or granular matters. For the complex elements such as living\ncells, however, the microscopic variables and their dynamics are often unknown,\nand there have been no systematic theory of coarse-graining from the\nmicroscales, nor the formulas like Irving-Kirkwood formula that constitutes the\nmacroscopic stress or couple-stress in terms of some microscale quantities. We\nshow that, for the quasi-steady states, the coarse-graining procedure must\ngenerally provides with the Cosserat-type balance equations as long as the\nprocedure keeps track of the conservation of linear and angular momenta, and\nthat the fluxes of these conserved quantities should generally be expressed in\nthe Irving-Kirkwood-type formulas, where the inter- particle distance or\nforces/torques should be replaced by those associated to the pair of\nneighboring coarse-graining volumes. This framework, which refers to no\nparticular micro-variables or dynamics, is valid for active complex matters out\nof equilibrium and with any multi-body interactions.\n", "  We present two general approaches to obtain the strong converse rate of\nquantum hypothesis testing for correlated quantum states. One approach requires\nthat the states satisfy a certain factorization property; typical examples of\nsuch states are the temperature states of translation-invariant finite-range\ninteractions on a spin chain. The other approach requires the differentiability\nof a regularized R\\'enyi $\\alpha$-divergence in the parameter $\\alpha$; typical\nexamples of such states include temperature states of non-interacting fermionic\nlattice systems, and classical irreducible Markov chains. In all cases, we get\nthat the strong converse exponent is equal to the Hoeffding anti-divergence,\nwhich in turn is obtained from the regularized R\\'enyi divergences of the two\nstates.\n", "  The recent claim by BICEP2 of evidence for primordial gravitational waves\nfrom inflation has focused interest on the potential for early-Universe\ncosmology using observations of gravitational waves. In addition to cosmic\nmicrowave background detectors, efforts are underway to carry out\ngravitational-wave astronomy over a wide range of frequencies including pulsar\ntiming arrays (nHz), space-based detectors (mHz), and terrestrial detectors\n($\\sim$10-2000 Hz). This multiband effort will probe a wide range of times in\nthe early Universe (each corresponding to a different energy scale), during\nwhich gravitational-wave backgrounds may have been produced through processes\nsuch as phase transitions or preheating. In this letter, we derive a rule of\nthumb (not quite so strong as an upper limit) governing the maximum energy\ndensity of cosmological backgrounds. For most cosmological scenarios, we expect\nthe energy density spectrum to peak at values of\n$\\Omega_\\text{gw}(f)\\lesssim10^{-12\\pm2}$. We discuss the applicability of this\nrule of thumb and the implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.\n", "  Significant progress has been made recently on theoretical analysis of\nestimators for the stochastic block model (SBM). In this paper, we consider the\nmulti-graph SBM, which serves as a foundation for many application settings\nincluding dynamic and multi-layer networks. We explore the asymptotic\nproperties of two estimators for the multi-graph SBM, namely spectral\nclustering and the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE), as the number of layers\nof the multi-graph increases. We derive sufficient conditions for consistency\nof both estimators and propose a variational approximation to the MLE that is\ncomputationally feasible for large networks. We verify the sufficient\nconditions via simulation and demonstrate that they are practical. In addition,\nwe apply the model to two real data sets: a dynamic social network and a\nmulti-layer social network with several types of relations.\n", "  There has been great interest in recent years on statistical models for\ndynamic networks. In this paper, I propose a stochastic block transition model\n(SBTM) for dynamic networks that is inspired by the well-known stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) for static networks and previous dynamic extensions of the SBM.\nUnlike most existing dynamic network models, it does not make a hidden Markov\nassumption on the edge-level dynamics, allowing the presence or absence of\nedges to directly influence future edge probabilities while retaining the\ninterpretability of the SBM. I derive an approximate inference procedure for\nthe SBTM and demonstrate that it is significantly better at reproducing\ndurations of edges in real social network data.\n", "  Approximate Message Passing (AMP) has been shown to be an excellent\nstatistical approach to signal inference and compressed sensing problem. The\nAMP framework provides modularity in the choice of signal prior; here we\npropose a hierarchical form of the Gauss-Bernouilli prior which utilizes a\nRestricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) trained on the signal support to push\nreconstruction performance beyond that of simple iid priors for signals whose\nsupport can be well represented by a trained binary RBM. We present and analyze\ntwo methods of RBM factorization and demonstrate how these affect signal\nreconstruction performance within our proposed algorithm. Finally, using the\nMNIST handwritten digit dataset, we show experimentally that using an RBM\nallows AMP to approach oracle-support performance.\n", "  We study the singular values of the product of two coupled rectangular random\nmatrices as a determinantal point process. Each of the two factors is given by\na parameter dependent linear combination of two independent, complex Gaussian\nrandom matrices, which is equivalent to a coupling of the two factors via an\nItzykson-Zuber term. We prove that the squared singular values of such a\nproduct form a biorthogonal ensemble and establish its exact solvability. The\nparameter dependence allows us to interpolate between the singular value\nstatistics of the Laguerre ensemble and that of the product of two independent\ncomplex Ginibre ensembles which are both known. We give exact formulae for the\ncorrelation kernel in terms of a complex double contour integral, suitable for\nthe subsequent asymptotic analysis. In particular, we derive a\nChristoffel-Darboux type formula for the correlation kernel, based on a five\nterm recurrence relation for our biorthogonal functions. It enables us to find\nits scaling limit at the origin representing a hard edge. The resulting\nlimiting kernel coincides with the universal Meijer G-kernel found by several\nauthors in different ensembles. We show that the central limit theorem holds\nfor the linear statistics of the singular values and give the limiting variance\nexplicitly.\n", "  The quantum stochastic Schroedinger equation or Hudson-Parthasareathy (HP)\nequation is a powerful tool to construct unitary dilations of quantum dynamical\nsemigroups and to develop the theory of measurements in continuous time via the\nconstruction of output fields. An important feature of such an equation is that\nit allows to treat not only absorption and emission of quanta, but also\nscattering processes, which however had very few applications in physical\nmodelling. Moreover, recent developments have shown that also some\nnon-Markovian dynamics can be generated by suitable choices of the state of the\nquantum noises involved in the HP-equation. This paper is devoted to an\napplication involving these two features, non-Markovianity and scattering\nprocess. We consider a micro-mirror mounted on a vibrating structure and\nreflecting a laser beam, a process giving rise to a radiation-pressure force on\nthe mirror. We show that this process needs the scattering part of the\nHP-equation to be described. On the other side, non-Markovianity is introduced\nby the dissipation due to the interaction with some thermal environment which\nwe represent by a phonon field, with a nearly arbitrary excitation spectrum,\nand by the introduction of phase noise in the laser beam. Finally, we study the\nfull power spectrum of the reflected light and we show how the laser beam can\nbe used as a temperature probe.\n", "  We examine the reliability of the theoretical methods presently used for\nanalysis and prediction of neutrino oscillation phenomena. Of particular\ninterest are the limitations imposed by branch points when expansions in one of\nthe small parameters of the Standard Neutrino Model (SNM) are made to obtain\ntractable results. Our evaluation compares the approximate oscillation\nprobabilities for flavor-changing transitions in the $(\\nu_e , \\nu_\\mu)$ sector\nto exact results obtained from of a recently-developed exact analytical\nrepresentation of neutrino oscillations in matter within the SNM. From our\nnumerical comparisons, we are able to identify regions where the existing\napproaches can be improved to take full advantage of the higher quality data\nexpected at future neutrino facilities.\n", "  The sequence of ground states for SrTiO3 film subjected to epitaxial strain\nas well as to mechanical stress along the [001] and [110] axes is calculated\nfrom first principles within the density functional theory. Under the\nfixed-strain boundary conditions, an increase in the lattice parameter of a\nsubstrate results in the $I4cm \\to I4/mcm \\to Ima2 \\to Cm \\to Fmm2 \\to\nIma2$(II) sequence of ground states. Under the fixed-stress boundary\nconditions, the phase sequence is different and depends on how the stress is\napplied. It is revealed that the simultaneous presence of competing\nferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities in SrTiO3 gives rise to the\nappearance of metastable phases, whose number increases dramatically under the\nfixed-stress conditions. In the metastable phases, the octahedral rotation\npatterns are shown to differ substantially from those in the ground state. It\nis suggested that in systems with competing instabilities, each polar phase has\nits optimal octahedral rotation pattern which stabilizes this phase and creates\na potential barrier preventing this phase to be transformed into other\nstructures.\n", "  A search is presented for pair production of a new heavy quark ($Q$) that\ndecays into a $W$ boson and a light quark ($q$) in the final state where one\n$W$ boson decays leptonically (to an electron or muon plus a neutrino) and the\nother $W$ boson decays hadronically. The analysis is performed using an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$\nTeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No evidence of $Q\\bar{Q}$\nproduction is observed. New chiral quarks with masses below 690 GeV are\nexcluded at 95% confidence level, assuming BR$(Q\\to Wq)=1$. Results are also\ninterpreted in the context of vectorlike quark models, resulting in the limits\non the mass of a vectorlike quark in the two-dimensional plane of BR$(Q\\to Wq)$\nversus BR$(Q\\to Hq)$.\n", "  We report on the first measurement of an excess in the yield of J/$\\psi$ at\nvery low transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}< 0.3$ GeV/$c$) in peripheral hadronic\nPb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, performed by ALICE at the\nCERN LHC. Remarkably, the measured nuclear modification factor of J/$\\psi$ in\nthe rapidity range $2.5<y<4$ reaches about 7 (2) in the $p_{\\rm T}$ range 0-0.3\nGeV/$c$ in the 70-90% (50-70%) centrality class. The J/$\\psi$ production cross\nsection associated with the observed excess is obtained under the hypothesis\nthat coherent photoproduction of J/$\\psi$ is the underlying physics mechanism.\nIf confirmed, the observation of J/$\\psi$ coherent photoproduction in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at impact parameters smaller than twice the nuclear radius opens new\ntheoretical and experimental challenges and opportunities. In particular,\ncoherent photoproduction accompanying hadronic collisions may provide insight\ninto the dynamics of photoproduction and nuclear reactions, as well as become a\nnovel probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.\n", "  We study the relaxation dynamics of interacting, one-dimensional fermions\nwith band curvature after a weak quench in the interaction parameter. After the\nquench, the system is described by a non-equilibrium initial state, which\nrelaxes towards thermal equilibrium, featuring prethermal behavior on\nintermediate time and length scales. The model corresponds to the class of\ninteracting Luttinger Liquids, which extends the quadratic Luttinger theory by\na weak integrability breaking phonon scattering term. In order to solve for the\nnon-equilibrium time evolution, we use kinetic equations for the phonon\ndensities, exploiting the resonant but subleading character of the phonon\ninteraction term. The interplay between phonon scattering and the quadratic\nLuttinger theory leads to the emergence of three distinct spatio-temporal\nregimes for the fermionic real-space correlation function. It features the\ncrossover from a prequench to a prethermal state, finally evolving towards a\nthermal state on increasing length and time scales. The characteristic\nalgebraically decaying real-space correlations in the prethermalized regime\nbecome modulated by an amplitude, which, as an effect of the interactions, is\ndecaying in time according to a stretched-exponential, while in the thermal\nregime exponentially decaying real-space correlations emerge. The asymptotic\nthermalization dynamics is governed by energy transport over large distances\nfrom the thermalized to the non-thermalized regions, which is carried out by\nmacroscopic, dynamical slow modes. This is revealed in an algebraic decay of\nthe system's effective temperature. The numerical value of the associated\nexponent agrees with the dynamical critical exponent of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nuniversality class, which shares with the present interacting Luttinger Liquid\nthe conservation of total energy and momentum.\n", "  The missing mass spectroscopy of $\\Xi^{-}$ hypernuclei with the\n$(K^{-},K^{+})$ reaction is planned to be performed at the J-PARC K1.8 beam\nline by using a new magnetic spectrometer, Strangeness $-2$ Spectrometer\n(S-2S). A $\\v{C}$cerenkov detector with a radiation medium of pure water\n(refractive index of 1.33) is designed to be used for on-line proton rejection\nfor a momentum range of 1.2 to 1.6 GeV/$c$ in S-2S. Prototype water\n$\\v{C}$erenkov detectors were developed and tested with positron beams and\ncosmic rays to estimate their proton-rejection capability. We achieved an\naverage number of photoelectrons of greater than 200 with the latest prototype\nfor cosmic rays, which was stable during an expected beam time of one month.\nThe performance of the prototype in the cosmic-ray test was well reproduced\nwith a Monte Carlo simulation in which some input parameters were adjusted.\nBased on the Monte Carlo simulation, we expect to achieve $>90\\%$\nproton-rejection efficiency while maintaining $>95\\%$ $K^{+}$ survival ratio in\nthe whole S-2S acceptance. The performance satisfies the requirements to\nconduct the spectroscopic study of $\\Xi^{-}$ hypernuclei at J-PARC.\n", "  The next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) has already exploded, and\nits electromagnetic (EM) waves, neutrinos, and gravitational waves (GWs) may\narrive at any moment. We present an extensive study on the potential\nsensitivity of prospective detection scenarios for GWs from CCSNe within 5Mpc,\nusing realistic noise at the predicted sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO and\nAdvanced Virgo detectors for 2015, 2017, and 2019. We quantify the\ndetectability of GWs from CCSNe within the Milky Way and Large Magellanic\nCloud, for which there will be an observed neutrino burst. We also consider\nextreme GW emission scenarios for more distant CCSNe with an associated EM\nsignature. We find that a three detector network at design sensitivity will be\nable to detect neutrino-driven CCSN explosions out to ~5.5 kpc, while rapidly\nrotating core collapse will be detectable out to the Large Magellanic Cloud at\n50kpc. Of the phenomenological models for extreme GW emission scenarios\nconsidered in this study, such as long-lived bar-mode instabilities and disk\nfragmentation instabilities, all models considered will be detectable out to\nM31 at 0.77 Mpc, while the most extreme models will be detectable out to M82 at\n3.52 Mpc and beyond.\n", "  We study the symmetry group properties of the variable coefficient\nDavey-Stewartson (vcDS) system. The Lie point symmetry algebra with a\nKac-Moody-Virasoro (KMV) structure is shown to be isomorphic to that of the\nusual (constant coefficient) DS system if and only if the coefficients satisfy\nsome conditions. These conditions turn out to coincide with those for the vcDS\nsystem to be transformable to the DS system by a point transformation.\n  The equivalence group of the vcDS system is applied to pick out the\nintegrable subsystems from a class of non-integrable ones. Additionally, the\nfull symmetry group of the DS system is derived explicitly without\nexponentiating its symmetry algebra.\n  Lump solutions (rationally localized in all directions in $\\mathbb{R}^2$)\nintroduced by Ozawa for the DS system is shown to hold even for the vcDS system\nprecisely when the system belongs to the integrable class, i.e. equivalent to\nthe DS system. These solutions can be used for establishing exact blow-up\nsolutions in finite time in the space $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ in the focusing case.\n", "  We study the classical and quantum values of one- and two-party linear games,\nan important class of unique games that generalizes the well-known XOR games to\nthe case of non-binary outcomes. We introduce a ``constraint graph\" associated\nto such a game, with the constraints defining the linear game represented by an\nedge-coloring of the graph. We use the graph-theoretic characterization to\nrelate the task of finding equivalent games to the notion of signed graphs and\nswitching equivalence from graph theory. We relate the problem of computing the\nclassical value of single-party anti-correlation XOR games to finding the edge\nbipartization number of a graph, which is known to be MaxSNP hard, and connect\nthe computation of the classical value of more general XOR-d games to the\nidentification of specific cycles in the graph. We construct an orthogonality\ngraph of the game from the constraint graph and study its Lov\\'{a}sz theta\nnumber as a general upper bound on the quantum value even in the case of\nsingle-party contextual XOR-d games. Linear games possess appealing properties\nfor use in device-independent applications such as randomness of the local\ncorrelated outcomes in the optimal quantum strategy. We study the possibility\nof obtaining quantum algebraic violation of these games, and show that no\nfinite linear game possesses the property of pseudo-telepathy leaving the\nfrequently used chained Bell inequalities as the natural candidates for such\napplications. We also show this lack of pseudo-telepathy for multi-party\nXOR-type inequalities involving two-body correlation functions.\n", "  A model including a periodically corrugated thin layer with GaAs substrate is\nemployed to investigate the effects of the corrugations on the transmission\nprobability of the nanostructure. We find that transmission gaps and resonant\ntunneling domains emerge from the corrugations, in the tunneling domains the\ntunneling peaks and valleys result from the boundaries between adjacent regions\nin which electron has different effective masses, and can be slightly modified\nby the layer thickness. These results can provide an access to design a\ncurvature-tunable filter.\n", "  In this article we study Kaluza-Klein (KK) dimensional reduction of massive\nAbelian gauge theories with charged matter fields on a circle. Since local\ngauge transformations change position dependence of the charged fields, the\ndecomposition of the charged matter fields into KK modes is gauge dependent.\nWhile whole KK mass spectrum is independent of the gauge choice, the mode\nnumber depends on the gauge. The masses of the KK modes also depend on the\nfield value of the zero-mode of the extra dimensional component of the gauge\nfield. In particular, one of the KK modes in the KK tower of each massless 5D\ncharged field becomes massless at particular values of the extra-dimensional\ncomponent of the gauge field. When the extra-dimensional component of the gauge\nfield is identified with the inflaton, this structure leads to recursive\ncosmological particle productions.\n", "  We propose a single photon source based on a pair of weakly nonlinear optical\ncavities subject to a one-directional dissipative coupling. When both cavities\nare driven by mutually coherent fields, sub-poissonian light is generated in\nthe target cavity even when the nonlinear energy per photon is much smaller\nthan the dissipation rate. The sub-poissonian character of the field holds over\na delay measured by the inverse photon lifetime, as in the conventional photon\nblockade, thus allowing single-photon emission under pulsed excitation. We\ndiscuss a possible implementation of the dissipative coupling relevant to\nphotonic platforms.\n", "  Reversible evolution of macroscopic and mesoscopic systems can be\nconveniently constructed from two ingredients: an energy functional and a\nPoisson bracket. The goal of this paper is to elucidate how the Poisson\nbrackets can be constructed and what additional features we also gain by the\nconstruction. In particular, the Poisson brackets governing reversible\nevolution in one-particle kinetic theory, kinetic theory of binary mixtures,\nbinary fluid mixtures, classical irreversible thermodynamics and classical\nhydrodynamics are derived from Liouville equation. Although the construction is\nquite natural, a few examples where it does not work are included (e.g. the\nBBGKY hierarchy). Finally, a new infinite grand-canonical hierarchy of Poisson\nbrackets is proposed, which leads to Poisson brackets expressing non-local\nphenomena such as turbulent motion or evolution of polymeric fluids.\nEventually, Lie-Poisson structures standing behind some of the brackets are\nidentified.\n", "  A key ingredient for quantum photonic technologies is an on-demand source of\nindistinguishable single photons. State-of-the-art indistinguishable\nsingle-photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed\nrepetition rates, creating a string of single photons with predetermined\narrival times. However, in future applications, an independent electronic\nsignal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of\nan indistinguishable photon. Further, operating the photon source up to the\nlimit imposed by its lifetime is desirable. Here, we report on the application\nof a true on-demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise\narrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse\nduration based on resonance fluorescence from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot.\nWe investigate in detail the effect of the finite duration of an excitation\n$\\pi$ pulse on the degree of photon antibunching. Finally, we demonstrate that\nhighly indistinguishable single photons can be generated using this on-demand\napproach, enabling maximum flexibility for future applications.\n", "  Inclusive jet production in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon (NN)\ncenter-of-mass energy of sqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV is studied with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n35 inverse nanobarns is analyzed. The jet transverse momentum spectra are\nstudied in seven pseudorapidity intervals covering the range -2.0 < eta[CM] <\n1.5 in the NN center-of-mass frame. The jet production yields at forward and\nbackward pseudorapidity are compared and no significant asymmetry about eta[CM]\n= 0 is observed in the measured kinematic range. The measurements in the pPb\nsystem are compared to reference jet spectra obtained by extrapolation from\nprevious measurements in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. In all\npseudorapidity ranges, nuclear modifications in inclusive jet production are\nfound to be small, as predicted by next-to-leading order perturbative QCD\ncalculations that incorporate nuclear effects in the parton distribution\nfunctions.\n", "  In this work we use gauge/string dualities and a dynamical model that takes\ninto account dynamical corrections to the metric of the anti de Sitter space\ndue to a quadratic dilaton field and calculate the masses of even and odd spin\nglueball states with $P=C=+1$, and $P=C=-1$, respectively. Then we construct\nthe corresponding Regge trajectories which are associated with the pomeron for\neven states with $P=C=+1$, and with the odderon for odd states with $P=C=-1$.\nWe compare our results with those coming from experimental data as well as\nother models.\n", "  We previously reported on a recursive method to generate the expansion of the\nlattice Green function of the $d$-dimensional face-centred cubic lattice (fcc).\nThe method was used to generate many coefficients for d=7 and the corresponding\nlinear differential equation has been obtained. In this paper, we show the\nstrength and the limit of the method by producing the series and the\ncorresponding linear differential equations for d=8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The\ndifferential Galois groups of these linear differential equations are shown to\nbe symplectic for d=8, 10, 12 and orthogonal for d= 9, 11. The recursion\nrelation naturally provides a 2-dimensional array $ T_d(n,j)$ where only the\ncoefficients $ t_d(n,0)$ correspond to the coefficients of the lattice Green\nfunction of the d-dimensional fcc. The coefficients $ t_d(n,j)$ are associated\nto D-finite bivariate series annihilated by linear partial differential\nequations that we analyze.\n", "  Displacement of propagating quantum states of light is a fundamental\noperation for quantum communication. It enables fundamental studies on\nmacroscopic quantum coherence and plays an important role in quantum\nteleportation protocols with continuous variables. In our experiments we have\nsuccessfully implemented this operation for propagating squeezed microwave\nstates. We demonstrate that, even for strong displacement amplitudes, there is\nno degradation of the squeezing level in the reconstructed quantum states.\nFurthermore, we confirm that path entanglement generated by using displaced\nsqueezed states stays constant over a wide range of the displacement power.\n", "  Three-level quantum systems, which possess some unique characteristics beyond\ntwo-level ones, such as electromagnetically induced transparency, coherent\ntrapping, and Raman scatting, play important roles in solid-state quantum\ninformation processing. Here, we introduce an approach to implement the\nphysically feasible three-level transitionless quantum driving with multiple\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics (MSDs). It can be used to control accurately\npopulation transfer and entanglement generation for three-level quantum systems\nin a nonadiabatic way. Moreover, we propose an experimentally realizable hybrid\narchitecture, based on two nitrogen-vacancy-center ensembles coupled to a\ntransmission line resonator, to realize our transitionless scheme which\nrequires fewer physical resources and simple procedures, and it is more robust\nagainst environmental noises and control parameter variations than conventional\nadiabatic passage techniques. All these features inspire the further\napplication of MSDs on robust quantum information processing in experiment.\n", "  We consider the isotropic perimeter generating functions of three-choice,\nimperfect, and 1-punctured staircase polygons, whose 8th order linear Fuchsian\nODEs are previously known. We derive simple relationships between the three\ngenerating functions, and show that all three generating functions are joint\nsolutions of a common 12th order Fuchsian linear ODE. We find that the 8th\norder differential operators can each be rewritten as a direct sum of a direct\nproduct, with operators no larger than 3rd order. We give closed-form\nexpressions for all the solutions of these operators in terms of $_2F_1$\nhypergeometric functions with rational and algebraic arguments. The solutions\nof these linear differential operators can in fact be expressed in terms of two\nmodular forms, since these $_2F_1$ hypergeometric functions can be expressed\nwith two, rational or algebraic, pullbacks.\n", "  We introduce an accurate non-Hermitian Schr\\\"odinger-type approximation of\nBloch optical equations for two-level systems. This approximation provides a\ncomplete description of the excitation, relaxation and decoherence dynamics in\nboth weak and strong laser fields. In this approach, it is sufficient to\npropagate the wave function of the quantum system instead of the density\nmatrix, providing that relaxation and dephasing are taken into account via\nautomatically-adjusted time-dependent gain and decay rates. The developed\nformalism is applied to the problem of scattering and absorption of\nelectromagnetic radiation by a thin layer comprised of interacting two-level\nemitters.\n", "  We report on single-object spectroscopic studies of a characteristic set of\nthree resonances which appear in GaAlAs/AlAs quantum dot structures. The\nexperiments included the photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence\nexcitation (PLE) spectroscopy, photon-correlation measurements, analysis of the\nlinear polarization of the emission spectra as well as the PL and PLE\nspectroscopy performed as a function of magnetic field. The investigated\nresonances are assigned to three different states of a positively charged\nexciton: a singlet ground state, a conventional triplet state (involving an\nelectron from the ground state electronic $s$-shell), and additionally, a\nhighly excited triplet state (involving the electron from the excited\nelectronic $p$-shell). Advantageously (due to partially suppressed relaxation\nefficiency), the emission due to the highly excited triplet can seen in the\nspectra which allows us to scrupulously determine its properties and compare\nthem to those of the conventional triplet state. Whereas both triplet states\nshow similar patterns of the fine structure and Zeeman splitting, the splitting\namplitudes are found to be significantly different for these two states. The\npresented results emphasize the role of the symmetry of the electronic state on\nthe properties of the triplet states of the two holes + electron excitonic\ncomplex.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the energy exchange between electrons of two\nco-propagating, out-of-equilibrium edge states with opposite spin polarization\nin the integer quantum Hall regime. A quantum dot tunnel-coupled to one of the\nedge states locally injects electrons at high energy. Thereby a narrow peak in\nthe energy distribution is created at high energy above the Fermi level. A\nsecond downstream quantum dot performs an energy resolved measurement of the\nelectronic distribution function. By varying the distance between the two dots,\nwe are able to follow every step of the energy exchange and relaxation between\nthe edge states - even analytically under certain conditions. In the absence of\ntranslational invariance along the edge, e.g. due to the presence of disorder,\nenergy can be exchanged by non-momentum conserving two-particle collisions. For\nweakly broken translational invariance, we show that the relaxation is\ndescribed by coupled Fokker-Planck equations. From these we find that\nrelaxation of the injected electrons can be understood statistically as a\ngeneralized drift-diffusion process in energy space for which we determine the\ndrift-velocity and the dynamical diffusion parameter. Finally, we provide a\nphysically appealing picture in terms of individual edge state heating as a\nresult of the relaxation of the injected electrons.\n", "  It is well known that the category of finite sets and cospans, composed by\npushout, contains the universal {\\em special} commutative Frobenius algebra. In\nthis note we observe that the same construction yields also general commutative\nFrobenius algebras, if just the pushouts are changed to homotopy pushouts.\n", "  Strong field gravitational lensings are dramatically disparate from those in\nthe weak field by representing relativistic images due to light winds one to\ninfinity loops around a lens before escaping. We study such a lensing caused by\na charged Galileon black hole, which is expected to have possibility to evade\nno-hair theorem. We calculate the angular separations and time delays between\ndifferent relativistic images of the charged Galileon black hole. All these\nobservables can potentially be used to discriminate a charged Galileon black\nhole from others. We estimate the magnitudes of these observables for the\nclosest supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The strong field lensing observables of\nthe charged Galileon black hole can be close to those of a tidal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole or those of a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black\nhole. It will be helpful to distinguish these black holes if we can separate\nthe outermost relativistic images and determine their angular separation,\nbrightness difference and time delay, although it requires techniques beyond\nthe current limit.\n", "  Binary transition metal chalcogenides have attracted increasing attention for\ntheir unique structural and electronic properties. High pressure is powerful\ntool for tuning their crystal structure and electronic structure away from\ntheir pristine states.In this work, we systematically studied the in situ\nstructural and optical behavior of silver sulfide (Ag2S) under pressure by\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements in a\ndiamond anvil cell. Upon compression, Ag2S undergoes structural symmetrization\nfrom monoclinic to orthorhombic, represented by the decrease of angle from 99\nto 90 degrees through a series of structural transitions coupled with lattice\ncontractions. IR transmission and reflectivity measurements showed that\npressure effectively tunes semiconducting Ag2S into a metal at ~ 22 GPa. Drude\nmodel analysis of the IR reflectivity indicates that the optical conductivity\nevolves significantly, reaching the highest conductivity at ~ 40 GPa. Our\nresults highlight pressure's dramatic role in tuning the structural and\nelectronic state of silver chacogenides.\n", "  Cubic SrTiO$_{3}$ becomes tetragonal below 105 K. The antiferrodistortive\n(AFD) distortion leads to clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of adjacent\nTiO$_{6}$ octahedra. This insulator becomes a metal upon the introduction of\nextremely low concentration of n-type dopants. However, signatures of the\nstructural phase transition in charge conduction have remained elusive.\nEmploying the Montgomery technique, we succeed in resolving the anisotropy of\ncharge conductivity induced by the AFD transition, in the presence of different\ntypes of dopants. We find that the slight lattice distortion ($<6 \\times\n10^{-4}$) gives rise to a twenty percent anisotropy in charge conductivity, in\nagreement with the expectations of band calculations. Application of uniaxial\nstrain amplifies the detectable anisotropy by disfavoring one of the three\npossible tetragonal domains. In contrast with all other known anisotropic Fermi\nliquids, the anisotropy has opposite signs for elastic and inelastic\nscattering. Increasing the concentration of dopants leads to a drastic shift in\nthe temperature of the AFD transition either upward or downward. The latter\nresult puts strong constraints on any hypothetical role played by the AFD soft\nmode in the formation of Cooper pairs and the emergence of superconductivity in\nSrTiO$_3$.\n", "  Quantum localization of classical mechanics within the BRST-BFV and BV (or\nfield-antifield) quantization methods are studied. It is shown that a special\nchoice of gauge fixing functions (or BRST-BFV charge) together with the unitary\nlimit leads to Hamiltonian localization in the path integral of the BRST-BFV\nformalism. In turn, we find that a special choice of gauge fixing functions\nbeing proportional to extremals of an initial non-degenerate classical action\ntogether with a very special solution of the classical master equation result\nin Lagrangian localization in the partition function of the BV formalism.\n", "  We consider the quantum centipede made of $N$ fermionic quantum walkers on\nthe one-dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all\nhard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either\none or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads\nballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the\ninteractions between the internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its\ncenter-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time\nlimit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution.\nThe spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are\nanalyzed by direct means for the first few values of $N$. Some analytical\nresults are obtained for arbitrary $N$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the\nproblem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity\ndescribing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede\nwavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-$N$ limit.\n", "  For short-ranged disordered quantum models in one dimension, the\nMany-Body-Localization is analyzed via the adaptation to the Many-Body context\n[M. Serbyn, Z. Papic and D.A. Abanin, PRX 5, 041047 (2015)] of the Thouless\npoint of view on the Anderson transition : the question is whether a local\ninteraction between two long chains is able to reshuffle completely the\neigenstates (Delocalized phase with a volume-law entanglement) or whether the\nhybridization between tensor states remains limited (Many-Body-Localized Phase\nwith an area-law entanglement). The central object is thus the level of\nHybridization induced by the matrix elements of local operators, as compared\nwith the difference of diagonal energies. The multifractal analysis of these\nmatrix elements of local operators is used to analyze the corresponding\nstatistics of resonances. Our main conclusion is that the critical point is\ncharacterized by the Strong-Multifractality Spectrum $f(0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq\n2)=\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$, well known in the context of Anderson Localization in\nspaces of effective infinite dimensionality, where the size of the Hilbert\nspace grows exponentially with the volume. Finally, the possibility of a\ndelocalized non-ergodic phase near criticality is discussed.\n", "  We propose a model describing the phase behavior of two-component membranes\nconsisting of binary mixtures of electrically charged and neutral lipids. We\ntake into account the structural phase transition (main-transition) of the\nhydrocarbon chains, and investigate the interplay between this phase transition\nand the lateral phase separation. The presence of charged lipids significantly\naffects the phase behavior of the multi-component membrane. Due to the\nconservation of lipid molecular volume, the main-transition temperature of\ncharged lipids is lower than that of neutral ones. Furthermore, as compared\nwith binary mixtures of neutral lipids, the membrane phase separation in binary\nmixtures of charged lipids is suppressed, in accord with recent experiments. We\ndistinguish between two types of charged membranes: mixtures of charged\nsaturated lipid/neutral unsaturated lipid and a second case of mixtures of\nneutral saturated lipid/charged unsaturated lipid. The corresponding phase\nbehavior is calculated and shown to be very different. Finally, we discuss the\neffect of added salt on the phase separation and the temperature dependence of\nthe lipid molecular area.\n", "  A binned Dalitz plot analysis of the decays $B^0 \\to D K^{\\ast 0}$, with $D\n\\to K_{S}^{0} \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ and $K_{S}^{0} K^{+} K^{-}$, is performed to\nmeasure the observables $x_\\pm$ and $y_\\pm$, which are related to the CKM angle\n$\\gamma$ and the hadronic parameters of the decays. The $D$ decay strong phase\nvariation over the Dalitz plot is taken from measurements performed at the\nCLEO-c experiment, making the analysis independent of the $D$ decay model. With\na sample of proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of $3.0\\,\\rm{fb}^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment, the values\nof the $CP$ violation parameters are found to be $x_+ = 0.05 \\pm 0.35 \\pm\n0.02$, $x_-=-0.31\\pm 0.20 \\pm 0.04$, $y_+=-0.81\\pm 0.28\\pm 0.06$ and\n$y_-=0.31\\pm 0.21 \\pm 0.05$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and\nthe second systematic. These observables correspond to values $\\gamma$ = $(71\n\\pm 20)^\\circ$, $r_{B^0} = 0.56\\pm 0.17$ and $\\delta_{B^0} =\n(204\\,^{+21}_{-20})^\\circ$. The parameters $r_{B^0}$ and $\\delta_{B^0}$ are the\nmagnitude ratio and strong phase difference between the suppressed and favoured\n$B^0$ decay amplitudes, and have been measured in a region of $\\pm 50$\nMeV/$c^2$ around the $K^{\\ast}(892)^{0}$ mass and with the magnitude of the\ncosine of the $K^{\\ast}(892)^{0}$ helicity angle larger than 0.4.\n", "  We propose a versatile Loschmidt echo protocol to detect and quantify\nmultiparticle entanglement. It allows us to extract the quantum Fisher\ninformation for arbitrary pure states, and finds direct application in quantum\nmetrology. In particular, the protocol applies to states that are generally\ndifficult to characterize, as non-Gaussian states, and states that are not\nsymmetric under particle exchange. We focus on atomic systems, including\ntrapped ions, polar molecules, and Rydberg atoms, where entanglement is\ngenerated dynamically via long-range interaction, and show that the protocol is\nstable against experimental detection errors.\n", "  Non-local currents and voltages are better able at withstanding the\ndeleterious effects of dephasing than local currents and voltages in nanoscale\nsystems. This hypothesis is known to be true in quantum Hall set-ups. We test\nthis hypothesis in a four terminal quantum spin Hall set up wherein we compare\nthe local resistance measurement with the non-local one. In addition to\ninelastic scattering induced dephasing we also test resilience of the\nresistance measurements in the aforesaid set-ups to disorder and spin-flip\nscattering. We find the axiom that non-local resistance is less affected by the\ndetrimental effects of disorder and dephasing to be in general untrue for\nquantum spin Hall case. This has important consequences since it has been\nwidely communicated that non-local transport through edge channels in\ntopological insulators will have potential applications in low power\ninformation processing.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires based on non-nitride III-V compounds can be\nsynthesized under certain growth conditions to favor the appearance of wurtzite\ncrystal phase. Despite the reports in literature of ab initio band structures\nfor these wurtzite compounds, we still lack effective multiband models and\nparameter sets that can be simply used to investigate physical properties of\nsuch systems, for instance, under quantum confinement effects. In order to\naddress this deficiency, in this study we calculate the ab initio band\nstructure of bulk InAs and InP in wurtzite phase and develop an 8$\\times$8 k.p\nHamiltonian to describe the energy bands around $\\Gamma$ point. We show that\nour k.p model is robust and can be fitted to describe the important features of\nthe ab initio band structure. The correct description of the spin splitting\neffects that arise due to the lack of inversion symmetry in wurtzite crystals,\nis obtained with the $k$-dependent spin-orbit term in the Hamiltonian, often\nneglected in the literature. All the energy bands display a Rashba-like spin\ntexture for the in-plane spin expectation value. We also provide the density of\nstates and the carrier density as functions of the Fermi energy. Alternatively,\nwe show an analytical description of the conduction band, valid close to\n$\\Gamma$ point. The same fitting procedure is applied to the 6$\\times$6 valence\nband Hamiltonian. However, we find that the most reliable approach is the\n8$\\times$8 k.p Hamiltonian for both compounds. The k.p Hamiltonians and\nparameter sets that we develop in this paper provide a reliable theoretical\nframework that can be easily applied to investigate electronic, transport,\noptical, and spin properties of InAs- and InP-based nanostructures.\n", "  We develop an analytically solvable model able to qualitatively explain\nnonhydrogenic exciton spectra observed recently in two-dimensional (2d)\nsemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Our exciton Hamiltonian\nexplicitly includes additional angular momentum associated with the pseudospin\ndegree of freedom unavoidable in 2d semiconducting materials with honeycomb\nstructure. We claim that this is the key ingredient for understanding the\nnonhydrogenic exciton spectra that was missing so far.\n", "  With the semiclassical Landau-Vlasov transport model we studied the stopping\nobservable $R_E$, the energy-based isotropy ratio, for the\n$^{129}$Xe\\,+\\,$^{120}$Sn reaction at beam energies spanning 12$A$ to 100$A$\nMeV. We investigated the impacts of the nonlocality of the nuclear mean field,\nof the in-medium modified nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) cross section and of the\nreaction centrality. A fixed set of model parameters yields $R_E$ values that\nfavorably compare with the experimental ones, but only for energies below the\nFermi energy $E_F$. Above $E_F$ agreement is readily possible, but by a smooth\nevolution with energy of the parameter that controls the in-medium modification\nof $NN$ cross section. By comparing the simulation correction factor ${\\cal F}$\napplied to the free $NN$ cross section with the one deduced from experimental\ndata [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ C\\,{\\bf 90}, 064602 (2014)], we infer that the zero-range\nmean field almost entirely reproduces it. Also, in accordance with what has\nbeen deduced from experimental data, around $E_F$ a strong reduction of the\nfree $NN$ cross section is found. In order to test the impact of sampling\ncentral collisions by multiplicity an event generator (HIPSE) was used. We\nobtain that high multiplicity events are spread over a broad impact parameter\nrange, but it turns out that this has a small effect on the observable $R_E$\nand, thus, on ${\\cal F}$ as well.\n", "  The difficulty that the probabilities infinitely increase with time as time\nis long enough in time-dependent perturbation theory for some quantum systems\nis resolved by means of simply transforming the perturbative series into\nnatural exponential functions of the re-summed perturbative series. Three\nexactly solvable models are taken to check our new formulation, and excellent\nagreements with the exact solution are achieved.\n", "  The dynamics of electrons in counter-propagating, circularly polarized laser\nbeams are shown to exhibit attractors whose ability to trap particles depends\non the ratio of the beam intensities and a single parameter describing\nradiation reaction. Analytical expressions are found for the underlying limit\ncycles and the parameter range in which they are stable. In high-intensity\noptical pulses, where radiation reaction strongly modifies the trajectories,\nthe production of collimated gamma-rays and the initiation of non-linear\ncascades of electron-positron pairs can be optimized by a suitable choice of\nthe intensity ratio.\n", "  Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) can be tested by the time delay\nbetween photons with different energies passing through a gravitational field.\nAs one of the most energetic explosions in the Universe, gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) provide an effective tool to test the accuracy of EEP. In this paper, we\nuse the continuous spectra of 20 short GRBs detected by the Swift/BAT to test\nthe validity of EEP. Taking the duration of GRBs as the upper limit of the time\ndelay induced by EEP violation (assuming that the high energy photons arrive\nlater than the low energy photons), the difference of the parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameter is constrained with high accuracy. The strictest\nconstraint, $|\\gamma(150~{\\rm keV})-\\gamma(15~{\\rm keV})|<5.59\\times 10^{-10}$\nfrom GRB 150101B, is about $1\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude tighter than previous\nconstraints. Moreover, our result is more statistically significant than\nprevious results because we use the continuous spectra instead of isolated\nphotons.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of carriers bound to helical tube surfaces is\ninvestigated in a thin-layer quantization scheme. By numerically solving the\nopen-boundary Schr$\\ddot{\\rm o}$dinger equation in curvilinear coordinates,\ngeometric effect on the coherent transmission spectra is analysed in the case\nof single propagating mode as well as multimode. It is shown that, the coiling\nendows the helical nanotube with different transport properties from a bent\ncylindrical surface. Fano resonance appears as a purely geometric effect in the\nconductance, the corresponding energy of quasibound state is obviously\ninfluenced by the torsion and length of the nanotube. We also find new plateaus\nin the conductance. The transport of double-degenerate mode in this geometry is\nreminiscent of the Zeeman coupling between the magnetic field and spin angular\nmomentum in quasi-one-dimensional structure.\n", "  Topologically protected fermionic quasiparticles appear in metals, where band\ndegeneracies occur at the Fermi level, dictated by the band structure topology.\nWhile in some metals these quasiparticles are direct analogues of elementary\nfermionic particles of the relativistic quantum field theory, other metals can\nhave symmetries that give rise to quasiparticles, fundamentally different from\nthose known in high-energy physics. Here we report on a new type of topological\nquasiparticles -- triple point fermions -- realized in metals with symmorphic\ncrystal structure, which host crossings of three bands in the vicinity of the\nFermi level protected by point group symmetries. We find two topologically\ndifferent types of triple point fermions, both distinct from any other\ntopological quasiparticles reported to date. We provide examples of existing\nmaterials that host triple point fermions of both types, and discuss a variety\nof physical phenomena associated with these quasiparticles, such as the\noccurrence of topological surface Fermi arcs, transport anomalies and\ntopological Lifshitz transitions.\n", "  An experimental setup for electrostatic measurement of $\\varepsilon_0$,\nseparated magneto-static measurement of $\\mu_0$ and determination of the\nvelocity of light $c=1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_0 \\mu_0}$ according to Maxwell theory\nwith percent accuracy is described. No forces are measured with the\nexperimental setup therefore there is no need of a scale and the experiment\nprice less than \\pounds20 is mainly due to the batteries used. Multiplied\n137~times, this experimental setup was given at the fourth open international\nExperimental Physics Olympiad (EPO4) and a dozen high school students did very\nwell. This article, however, focuses on the catastrophe theory, which is the\nbasis of the methodology.\n", "  Plasmonic metasurfaces provide an effective way to increase the efficiency of\nseveral nonlinear processes while maintaining nanoscale dimensions. In this\nwork, nonlinear metasurfaces based on film-coupled silver nanostripes loaded\nwith Kerr nonlinear material are proposed to achieve efficient four-wave mixing\n(FWM). Highly localized plasmon resonances are formed in the nanogap between\nthe metallic film and nanostripes. The local electric field is dramatically\nenhanced in this subwavelength nanoregion. These properties combined with the\nrelaxed phase matching condition due to the ultrathin area lead to a giant FWM\nefficiency, which is enhanced by nineteen orders of magnitude compared to a\nbare silver screen. In addition, efficient visible and low-THz sources can be\nconstructed based on the proposed nonlinear metasurfaces. The FWM generated\ncoherent wave has a directional radiation pattern and its output power is\nrelatively insensitive to the incident angles of the excitation sources. This\nradiated power can be further enhanced by increasing the excitation power. The\ndielectric nonlinear material placed in the nanogap is mainly responsible for\nthe ultrastrong FWM response. Compact and efficient wave mixers and optical\nsources spanning different frequency ranges are envisioned to be designed based\non the proposed nonlinear metasurface designs.\n", "  Capillary interactions can be used to direct assembly of particles adsorbed\nat fluid-fluid interfaces. Precisely controlling the magnitude and direction of\ncapillary interactions to assemble particles into favoured structures for\nmaterials science purposes is desirable but challenging. In this paper, we\ninvestigate capillary interactions between magnetic Janus particles adsorbed at\nfluid-fluid interfaces. We develop a pair-interaction model that predicts that\nthese particles should arrange into a side--side configuration, and carry out\nsimulations that confirm the predictions of our model. Finally, we investigate\nthe monolayer structures that form when many magnetic Janus particles adsorb at\nthe interface. We find that the particles arrange into long, straight chains\nexhibiting little curvature, in contrast with capillary interactions between\nellipsoidal particles. We further find a regime in which highly ordered,\nlattice-like monolayer structures form, which can be tuned dynamically using an\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  We perform an in-plane optical spectroscopy measurement on high quality FeSe\nsingle crystals grown by a vapor transport technique. Below the structural\ntransition at $T_{\\rm s}\\sim$90 K, the reflectivity spectrum clearly shows a\ngradual suppression around 400 cm$^{-1}$ and the conductivity spectrum shows a\npeak at higher frequency. The energy scale of this gap-like feature is\ncomparable to the width of the band splitting observed by ARPES. The\nlow-frequency conductivity consists of two Drude components and the overall\nplasma frequency is smaller than that of the FeAs based compounds, suggesting a\nlower carrier density or stronger correlation effect. The plasma frequency\nbecomes even smaller below $T_{\\rm s}$ which agrees with the very small Fermi\nenergy estimated by other experiments. Similar to iron pnictides, a clear\ntemperature-induced spectral weight transfer is observed for FeSe, being\nindicative of strong correlation effect.\n", "  The firehose and mirror instabilities are thought to arise in a variety of\nspace and astrophysical plasmas, constraining the pressure anisotropies and\ndrifts between particle species. The plasma stability depends on all species\nsimultaneously, meaning that a combined analysis is required. Here, we present\nthe first such analysis in the solar wind, using the long-wavelength stability\nparameters to combine the anisotropies and drifts of all major species (core\nand beam protons, alphas, and electrons). At the threshold, the firehose\nparameter was found to be dominated by protons (67%), but also to have\nsignificant contributions from electrons (18%) and alphas (15%). Drifts were\nalso found to be important, contributing 57% in the presence of a proton beam.\nA similar situation was found for the mirror, with contributions of 61%, 28%,\nand 11% for protons, electrons, and alphas, respectively. The parallel electric\nfield contribution, however, was found to be small at 9%. Overall, the\nlong-wavelength thresholds constrain the data well (<1% unstable), and the\nimplications of this are discussed.\n", "  We extend the Einstein-aether theory to take into account the interaction\nbetween a pseudoscalar field, which describes the axionic dark matter, and a\ntime-like dynamic unit vector field, which characterizes the velocity of the\naether motion. The Lagrangian of the Einstein-aether-axion theory includes\ncross-terms based on the axion field and its gradient four-vector, on the\ncovariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector, and on the Riemann\ntensor and its convolutions. We follow the principles of the Effective Field\ntheory, and include into the Lagrangian of interactions all possible terms up\nto the second order in the covariant derivative. Interpretation of new\ncouplings is given in terms of irreducible parts of the covariant derivative of\nthe aether velocity, namely, the acceleration four-vector, the shear and\nvorticity tensors, and the expansion scalar. A spatially isotropic and\nhomogeneous cosmological model with dynamic unit vector field and axionic dark\nmatter is considered as an application of the established theory; new exact\nsolutions are discussed, which describe models with a Big Rip, Pseudo Rip and\nde Sitter-type asymptotic behavior.\n", "  We show that a system of four particles in a one-dimensional box with a\ntwo-particle harmonic interaction can by described by means of the symmetry\npoint group $O_h$. Group theory proves useful for the discussion of both the\nsmall-box and large-box regimes. We apply perturbation theory and obtain the\ncorrections of first order for the lowest states. We carry out a simple\nRayleigh-Ritz variational calculation with basis sets adapted to the symmetries\nof the system. We also obtain alternative variational results for the first\nthree lowest energy levels that are more suitable for larger box sizes.\n", "  Mays celebrated theoretical work of the 70s contradicted the established\nparadigm by demonstrating that complexity leads to instability in biological\nsystems. Here Mays random-matrix modelling approach is generalized to realistic\nlarge-scale webs of species interactions, be they structured by networks of\ncompetition, mutualism or both. Simple relationships are found to govern these\notherwise intractable models, and control the parameter ranges for which\nbiological systems are stable and feasible. Our analysis of model and real\nempirical networks is only achievable upon introducing a simplifying\nGoogle-matrix reduction scheme, which in the process, yields a practical\necological eigenvalue stability index. These results provide an understanding\non how network topology, especially connectance, influences species stable\ncoexistence. Constraints controlling feasibility (positive equilibrium\npopulations) in these systems, are found more restrictive than those\ncontrolling stability, helping explain the enigma of why many classes of\nfeasible ecological models are nearly always stable.\n", "  We propose a new model for explaining the diphoton excess observed at the\nLHC. The uniqueness of our model is that this excess is being produced by\nphoton-photon induced sub-process. The model includes an isospin $3/2$ scalar\nmultiplet (having triply, doubly and singly charged scalars) at the electroweak\n(EW) scale to explain the observed neutrino masses via the effective dimension\n$7$ operator. The model also include a singlet scalar which is the di-photon\nresonance. The loop induced coupling of the singlet scalar with a pair of\nphotons is enhanced due to contributions from multi-charged EW-scale scalars\n(component of isospin $3/2$ multiplet) in the loop. We examine the production\nof the singlet scalar at the LHC via photon-photon fusion sub-process and its\nsubsequent decay to di-photon. We found that a large part of parameter space of\nthe present model can explain the observed excess of di-photon events at the\nLHC. We also study the other decay modes of the singlet scalar and the ensuing\npredictions can be tested in the upcoming runs at the LHC.\n", "  The overabundance of high-energy cosmic positrons, observed by PAMELA and\nAMS-02, can be considered as the consequence of dark matter decays or\nannihilations. We show that recent FERMI/LAT measurements of the isotropic\ndiffuse gamma-ray background impose severe constraints on dark matter\nexplanations and make them practically inconsistent.\n", "  We study pattern formation in a complex Swift Hohenberg equation with\nphase-sensitive (parametric) gain. Such an equation serves as a universal order\nparameter equation describing the onset of spontaneous oscillations in extended\nsystems submitted to a kind of forcing dubbed rocking when the instability is\ntowards long wavelengths. Applications include two-level lasers and\nphotorefractive oscillators. Under rocking, the original continuous phase\nsymmetry of the system is replaced by a discrete one, so that phase bistability\nemerges. This leads to the spontaneous formation of phase-locked spatial\nstructures like phase domains and dark-ring (phase-) cavity solitons. Stability\nof the homogeneous solutions is studied and numerical simulations are made\ncovering all the dynamical regimes of the model, which turn out to be very\nrich. Formal derivations of the rocked complex Swift-Hohenberg equation, using\nmultiple scale techniques, are given for the two-level laser and the\nphotorefractive oscillator.\n", "  More than one Higgs boson may be present near the currently discovered Higgs\nmass, which can not be properly resolved due to the limitations in the\nintrinsic energy resolution at the Large Hadron Collider. We investigated the\nscenarios where two $CP$-even Higgs bosons are degenerate in mass. To correctly\npredict the Higgs signatures, quantum interference effects between the two\nHiggs bosons must be taken into account, which, however, has been often\nneglected in the literature. We carried out a global analysis including the\ninterference effects for a variety of Higgs searching channels at the Large\nHadron Collider, which suggests that the existence of two degenerate Higgs\nbosons near 125 GeV is highly likely. Prospects of distinguishing the\ndegenerate Higgs case from the single Higgs case are discussed.\n", "  \\'Eliashberg theory, being generalized to the electron-phonon (EP) systems\nwith not constant density of electronic states, as well as to the frequency\nbehavior of the renormalization of both the electron mass and the chemical\npotential, is used to study hydrogen sulphide phase under pressure. The phonon\ncontribution to the anomalous electron Green's function (GF) is considered. The\npairing is considered within the overall width of the electron band, and not\nonly in a narrow layer at the Fermi surface. The frequency and the temperature\ndependences of the electron mass renormalization ReZ , the density of\nelectronic states , renormalized by the EP interaction , the spectral function\nof the electron-phonon interaction, obtained by calculation are used to\ncalculate the electronic abnormal GF. The \\'Eliashberg generalized equations\nwith the variable density of electronic states are resolved. The dependence of\nboth the real and the imaginary part of the order parameter on the frequency in\nthe phase is obtained. The value in the hydrogen sulfide phase at the pressure\nP = 225 GPa has been defined.\n", "  Power converters require passive low-pass filters which are capable of\nreducing voltage ripples effectively. In contrast to signal filters, the\ncomponents of power filters must carry large currents or withstand large\nvoltages, respectively. In this paper, three different suitable filter\nstructures for d.c./d.c. power converters with inductive load are introduced.\nThe formulas needed to calculate the filter components are derived step by step\nand practical examples are given. The behaviour of the three discussed filters\nis compared by means of the examples. Practical aspects for the realization of\npower filters are also discussed.\n", "  The Jovian magnetosphere is complicated by the multiple plasma sources and\nion species present within it, as well as fast rotation with its dipole axis\ntitled from its rotational axis. To date global models of Jovian have neglected\nthe presence of the different ion species as well as the tilted nature of the\ndipole axis. This paper reports the results of the first multi-fluid global\nmodeling of these effects in a single self-consistent study for processes\noccurring in the outer magnetosphere. In the inner magnetosphere the model\ndensities are shown to be comparable to observed densities with much of the\ndensity variables due to the wobble. The wobble enables plasma to be\ntransported to higher latitudes and then centrifugal acceleration leads to\nradial transport of the plasma. At the interface between the middle and outer\nmagnetosphere, the wobble produces a sinusoidal modulation of the plasma\nproperties, which yields at a fixed observing point two density peaks, each\nwith the planetary period. However, because of solar wind forcing and the fast\nrotation of Jupiter, torques are exerted on the outer magnetospheric plasma\nsuch that the azimuthal speed between the southern and northern hemispheres are\nunequal. This leads to the asymmetric square wave modulation of the plasma\nproperties in the outer magnetosphere such that only one density peak is seen\neach planetary period in the outer magnetosphere. This differential speed leads\nto reconnection in the tail at the planetary period and enhanced ejection of\nplasma down the tail at the planetary period. These processes could explain the\nperiodicity seen in the New Horizons' data without the need for invoking\narbitrary solar wind conditions. The energetic particles generated by these\nprocesses are shown to map to the arc-like structures seen in the dusk side\nauroral features.\n", "  The goal of climate change governance is to stabilize greenhouse gas\nconcentrations. This requires the reduction of anthropogenic global net\nemissions. In the pursuit of such a reduction, knowledge of greenhouse gas\nsources and sinks is critical to define baselines, and assess the effectiveness\nof climate governance over time. Such information and the means to\nindependently verify its credibility continue to remain out of reach including\nin the recent Paris agreement. This essay argues that to make real progress in\nmitigating future climate change, this status quo must be challenged both\nintellectually and practically. First, it proposes to acknowledge and address\nthe inconsistency between the objectives of a climate regime and the role of\ntransparency as a mean to achieve these objectives. It does so by redefining\ntransparency as the addition of publicity and measurability, which turns it\ninto a credible information generating mechanism for governance. Second, it\nshows how in practice, a global monitoring system of greenhouse gas net\nemissions, based on this new definition of transparency and designed as a\nglobal public good, could provide the necessary knowledge to help frame\ngovernance solutions by providing both credibility and completeness in\nunderstanding the scope of the problem to solve.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of a Fermi gas\ntrapped in a three-site optical lattice exposed to a fermionic environment. The\nlattice sites admit at most one spin-up and one spin-down particle at a time\nand its interaction with the fermionic environment cause particles to either be\ntrapped by or expelled from it. It is then shown that apart from each lattice\nsite being populated by at least one particle, spin exchange is observed, which\nallows the possibility for the system to be used to encrypt information via\nquantum cryptography. Furthermore, we also observe entanglement among the\nlattice sites, denoting that transport of quantum information among particles\nis possible in this ultracold atomic system.\n", "  2.5D time-dependent ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in Cartesian\ncoordinates were used in previous studies to seek MHD equilibria involving a\nmagnetic flux rope embedded in a bipolar, partially open background field. As\ndemonstrated by these studies, the equilibrium solutions of the system are\nseparated into two branches: the flux rope sticks to the photosphere for\nsolutions at the lower branch but is suspended in the corona for those at the\nupper branch. Moreover, a solution originally at the lower branch jumps to the\nupper, as the related control parameter increases and reaches a critical value,\nand the associated jump is here referred to as upward catastrophe. The present\npaper advances these studies in three aspects. First, the magnetic field is\nchanged to be force-free. The system still experiences an upward catastrophe\nwith an increase in each control parameter. Secondly, under the force-free\napproximation, there also exists a downward catastrophe, characterized by a\njump of a solution from the upper branch to the lower. Both catastrophes are\nirreversible processes connecting the two branches of equilibrium solutions so\nas to form a cycle. Finally, the magnetic energy in the numerical domain is\ncalculated. It is found that there exists a magnetic energy release for both\ncatastrophes. The Amp\\`{e}re's force, which vanishes everywhere for force-free\nfields, appears only during the catastrophes and does a positive work, which\nserves as a major mechanism for the energy release. The implications of the\ndownward catastrophe and its relevance to solar activities are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Transformation of carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes, CNTs, by electrolysis\nin molten carbonates provides a low cost route to extract and store this\ngreenhouse gas. CNTs are more stable, compact and valuable than fuels or other\nCO2 conversion products, providing an incentive to remove CO2 for climate\nmitigation. Previously, solid core carbon nanofibers, CNFs were formed with\nC-13 isotope CO2, whereas hollow core fibers - carbon nanotubes, CNTs, were\nformed with natural isotope CO2 splitting in molten lithium carbonate. Here we\ndemonstrate the extraordinary range of specific morphologies and conductivities\nof CNTs that can be achieved through control of the electrolysis conditions in\na one pot-synthesis, and scale-up of this process by which the greenhouse gas\nCO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes by molten carbonate electrolysis.\nAddition of Li2BO3, boron dopes and greatly enhances CNT conductivity formed at\nthe galvanized steel cathode. Addition of CaCO3 to the Li2CO3 electrolyte,\ndecreases oxide solubility in the region of CNT growth, producing straight\nthin-walled CNTs.\n", "  The concept of potential energy landscapes is applied in many areas of\nscience. We experimentally realize a random potential energy landscape (rPEL)\nto which colloids are exposed. This is achieved exploiting the interaction of\nmatter with light. The optical set-up is based on a special diffuser, which\ncreates a top-hat beam containing a speckle pattern. This is imposed on\ncolloids. The effect of the speckle pattern on the colloids can be described by\na rPEL. The speckle pattern as well as the rPEL are quantitatively\ncharacterized. The distributions of both, intensity and potential energy\nvalues, can be approximated by Gamma distributions. They can be tuned from\nexponential to approximately Gaussian with variable standard deviation, which\ndetermines the contrast of the speckles and the roughness of the rPEL.\nMoreover, the characteristic length scales, e.g. the speckle size, can be\ncontrolled. By rotating the diffuser, furthermore, a flat potential can be\ncreated and hence only radiation pressure exerted on the particles.\n", "  We have studied the properties of biaxial particles interacting via an\nanisotropic pair potential, involving second rank quadrupolar and third rank\noctupolar coupling terms, using Monte Carlo simulation. The particles occupy\nthe sites of a 2D square lattice and the interactions are restricted to nearest\nneighbours. The system exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking from an\nisotropic phase to a chiral modulated nematic phase, composed of ambidextrous\nchiral domains. When two-fold axes of quadrupolar and octupolar tensors\ncoincide this modulated phase appears to be the ambidextrous cholesteric phase\nof pitch comparable with a few lattice spacings, which can be regarded as a\nlimiting case of the nematic twist bend phase. The associated phase transition\nis first-order.\n", "  Light-induced conical intersections (LICIs) can be formed both by standing or\nby running laser waves. The position of a LICI is determined by the laser\nfrequency while the laser intensity controls the strength of the nonadiabatic\ncoupling. Recently, it was shown within the LICI framework that linearly\nchirped laser pulses have an impact on the dissociation dynamics of the\n$D_{2}^{+}$ molecule (J. Chem. Phys. 143, 014305, (2015); ibid 144, 074309,\n(2016)). In this work we exploit this finding and perform calculations using\nchirped laser pulses in which the time dependence of the laser frequency is\ndesigned so as to force the LICI to move together with the field-free\nvibrational wave packet as much as possible. Since nonadiabaticity is strongest\nin the vicinity of the conical intersection, this is the first step towards\ncontrolling the dissociation process via the LICI. Our showcase example is\nagain the $D_{2}^{+}$ molecular ion. To demonstrate the impact of the LICIs on\nthe dynamical properties of diatomics, the total dissociation probabilities and\nthe population of the different vibrational levels after the dissociation\nprocess are studied and discussed.\n", "  Guided-wave platforms such as fiber and silicon-on-insulator waveguide show\ngreat advances over traditional free space implementations in quantum\ninformation technology for significant advantages of low transmission loss, low\ncost, integrability and compatible with mature fiber communication systems.\nInterference between independent photon sources is the key to realize complex\nquantum systems for more sophisticated applications such as multi-photon\nentanglement generation and quantum teleportation. In this work, we report\nHong-Ou-Mandel interference between two independent all fiber photon pair\nsources over two 100GHz dense wave division multiplexing channels, the\nvisibility reaches 53.2(8.4)% (82.9(5.3)%) without (with) back ground counts\nsubtracted. In addition, we give a general theoretical description of the\npurity of the photon pair generation in dispersion shifted fiber and obtain the\noptimized condition for high purity photon pair generation. We also obtain a\nmaximum coincidence to back ground ratio of 131 by cooling the fiber in liquid\nnitrogen. Our study shows great promising of integrated optical elements for\nfuture scalable quantum information promising.\n", "  We demonstrate that, for a fermionic lattice system, the ground-state\nparticle density uniquely determines the external potential except for the\nsites corresponding to nodes of the wave function, and the limiting case where\nthe Pauli exclusion principle completely determines the occupation of all\nsites. Our fundamental finding completes, for this general class of systems,\nthe one-to-one correspondence between ground states, their densities, and the\nexternal potential at the base of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Moreover we\ndemonstrate that the mapping from wave function to potential is unique not just\nfor the ground state, but also for excited states. To illustrate our findings,\nwe develop a practical inversion scheme to determine the external potential\nfrom a given density. Our results hold for a general class of lattice models,\nwhich includes the Hubbard model.\n", "  Properties of soliton stars that could be expected to naturally arise out of\na first order phase transition in non-minimally coupled scalar-field-induced\ngravity theories are investigated. Of particular interest are configurations,\nsimilar to Lee-Wick stars, with vanishing effective gravitational constant in\nthe interiors.\n", "  In plane orientation of magnetic easy axis of sputtered strontium hexaferrite\nthin films has been explained using classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The\nvariation of average value of in plane spin component with temperature was\nplotted in order to determine the temperature at which easy axis is oriented in\nthe plane of the strontium ferrite film. The average value of in plane spin\ncomponent in this 2-D model reaches zero at one particular temperature. This\nparticular temperature obtained using our theoretical model agrees with the\nexperimental value of the temperature of rf sputtered polycrystalline strontium\nferrite thin films deposited on polycrystalline Al2O3 substrates (500 0C). This\nspin reorientation temperature solely depends on the values of energy\nparameters used in our modified Heisenberg Hamiltonian equation.\n", "  Betweenness centrality of a vertex in a graph measures the fraction of\nshortest paths going through the vertex. This is a basic notion for determining\nthe importance of a vertex in a network. The k-betweenness centrality of a\nvertex is defined similarly, but only considers shortest paths of length at\nmost k. The sequence of k-betweenness centralities for all possible values of k\nforms the betweenness centrality profile of a vertex. We study properties of\nbetweenness centrality profiles in trees.\n  We show that for scale-free random trees, for fixed k, the expectation of\nk-betweenness centrality strictly decreases as the index of the vertex\nincreases. We also analyze worst-case properties of profiles in terms of the\ndistance of profiles from being monotone, and the number of times pairs of\nprofiles can cross. This is related to whether k-betweenness centrality, for\nsmall values of k, may be used instead of having to consider all shortest\npaths. Bounds are given that are optimal in order of magnitude. We also present\nsome experimental results for scale-free random trees.\n", "  The effect of the resonance of electron scattering energy difference and\nphonon energy on the electron-phonon-electron interaction (EPEI) is studied.\nResults show that the resonance of electron transition energy and phonon energy\ncan enhance EPEI by a magnitude of 1 to 2. Moreover, the anisotropic S-wave\nelectron or dx2-y2 electron can enhance resonance EPEI, and the self-energy\ncorrection of the electron will weaken resonance EPEI. Particularly, the\nasymmetrical spin-flip scattering process in k space can reduce the effect of\nelectronic self-energy to enhance resonance EPEI\n", "  The data were accumulated with the HERMES forward spectrometer using the 27.6\nGeV longitudinally polarized electron or positron beam of HERA. Exclusive\nelectroproduction of $\\omega$ mesons on unpolarized hydrogen and deuterium\ntargets is studied in the kinematic region of $Q^2>1.0$ GeV$^2$, 3.0 GeV $< W\n<$ 6.3 GeV, and $-t'< 0.2 $ GeV$^{2}$, while for $\\rho^0$-meson production on a\ntransversely polarized hydrogen target $-t'< 0.4$ GeV$^{2}$ is used.\n  Spin-density matrix elements for $\\omega$ production are presented in\nprojections of $Q^2$ or $-t'$, while the ratios of the helicity amplitudes for\nthe reaction $\\gamma^*+p \\to \\rho^0+p$ are obtained in the entire kinematic\nregion. The usage of the transversely polarized target allows for the first\ntime the extraction of the ratios of certain nucleon-helicity-flip amplitudes\nto the natural-parity exchange amplitude $T_{0\\frac{1}{2}0\\frac{1}{2}}$ without\nthe nucleon-helicity flip describing the longitudinal $\\rho^0$-meson production\nby the longitudinal virtual photon. Violation of $s$-channel helicity\nconservation is observed for both mesons.\n  A dominant contribution from unnatural-parity exchange (UPE) is established\nfor special combinations of the $\\omega$ spin-density matrix elements. For\n$\\rho^0$-meson production, the UPE amplitude without the nucleon-helicity flip,\n$U_{1\\frac{1}{2}1\\frac{1}{2}}$, is shown to be the largest UPE amplitude. Good\nagreement is found between the HERMES data on $\\omega$ production on the proton\nand results of the perturbative QCD-inspired Goloskokov-Kroll model that\nincludes pion-pole contribution.\n", "  H$_3$S is believed to the most possible high-temperature superconducting\n($T_{\\text{c}}$) phase of hydrogen sulfide at $\\sim$200 GPa. It's isotope\nsubstitution of hydrogen (H) by deuterium (D), however, shows an anomalous\n$T_{\\text{c}}$ decrease of $\\sim$100 K at 140 to 160 GPa, much larger than the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory prediction. Using ab initio path-integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD), we show that the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs)\ninfluence the structures of H$_3$S and D$_3$S differently at finite\ntemperatures and the interval when H$_3$S possesses the symmetric high\n$T_{\\text{c}}$ structure while D$_3$S does not is in agreement with, though\ntheir absolute values are lower than experiments. This is consistent with an\nearlier theoretical study using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic\napproximation method in descriptions of the nuclei at 0 K.The remaining\ndiscrepancy can be substantially improved when the electronic structures are\ncalculated using a hybrid function. Our study presents a simple picture to\ninterpret the isotope dependent of $T_{\\text{c}}$ and emphasizes the quantum\nnature in the high-pressure hydrogen sulfide system.\n", "  The propagation of magnetoacoustic waves in the neighbourhood of a 2D null\npoint is investigated for both $\\beta=0$ and $\\beta \\neq 0$ plasmas. Previous\nwork has shown that the Alfv\\'en speed, here $v_A \\propto r$, plays a vital\nrole in such systems and so a natural choice is to switch to polar coordinates.\nFor the $\\beta=0$ plasma, we derive an analytical solution for the behaviour of\nthe fast magnetoacoustic wave in terms of the Klein-Gordon equation. We also\nsolve the system with a semi-analytical WKB approximation which shows that the\n$\\beta=0$ wave focuses on the null and contracts around it but, due to\nexponential decay, never reaches the null in a finite time. For the $\\beta \\neq\n0$ plasma, we solve the system numerically and find the behaviour to be similar\nto that of the $\\beta=0$ system at large radii, but completely different close\nto the null. We show that for an initially cylindrically-symmetric fast\nmagnetoacoustic wave perturbation, there is a decrease in wave speed along the\nseparatrices and so the perturbation starts to take on a quasi-diamond shape;\nwith the corners located along the separatrices. This is due to the growth in\npressure gradients that reach a maximum along the separatrices, which in turn\nreduces the acceleration of the fast wave along the separatrices leading to a\ndeformation of the wave morphology.\n", "  Most qubit-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols extract the secure\nkey merely from single-photon component of the attenuated lasers. However, with\nthe Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) QKD protocol, the unconditionally\nsecure key can be extracted from the two-photon component by modifying the\nclassical post-processing procedure in the BB84 protocol. Employing the merits\nof SARG04 QKD protocol and six-state preparation, one can extract secure key\nfrom the components of single photon up to four photons. In this paper, we\nprovide the exact relations between the secure key rate and the bit error rate\nin a six-state SARG04 protocol with single-photon, two-photon, three-photon,\nand four-photon sources. By restricting the mutual information between the\nphase error and bit error, we obtain a higher secure bit error rate threshold\nof the multiphoton components than previous works. Besides, we compare the\nperformances of the six-state SARG04 with other prepare-and-measure QKD\nprotocols using decoy states.\n", "  The dynamics of ultrafast energy transfer to water clusters and to bulk water\nby a highly intense, sub-cycle THz pulse of duration $\\approx$~150~fs is\ninvestigated in the context of force-field molecular dynamics simulations. We\nfocus our attention on the mechanisms by which rotational and translational\ndegrees of freedom of the water monomers gain energy from these sub-cycle\npulses with an electric field amplitude of up to about 0.6~V/{\\AA}. It has been\nrecently shown that pulses with these characteristics can be generated in the\nlaboratory [PRL 112, 213901 (2014)]. Through their permanent dipole moment,\nwater molecules are acted upon by the electric field and forced off their\npreferred hydrogen-bond network conformation. This immediately sets them in\nmotion with respect to one another as energy quickly transfers to their\nrelative center of mass displacements. We find that, in the bulk, the operation\nof these mechanisms is strongly dependent on the initial temperature and\ndensity of the system. In low density systems, the equilibration between\nrotational and translational modes is slow due to the lack of collisions\nbetween monomers. As the initial density of the system approaches 1~g/cm$^3$,\nequilibration between rotational and translational modes after the pulse\nbecomes more efficient. In turn, low temperatures hinder the direct energy\ntransfer from the pulse to rotational motion owing to the resulting stiffness\nof the hydrogen bond network. For small clusters of just a few water molecules\nwe find that fragmentation due to the interaction with the pulse is faster than\nequilibration between rotations and translations, meaning that the latter\nremain colder than the former after the pulse.\n", "  We study the propagation of a fast magnetoacoustic wave in a 3D magnetic\nfield created from two magnetic dipoles. The magnetic topology contains an\nX-line. We aim to contribute to the overall understanding of MHD wave\npropagation within inhomogeneous media, specifically around X-lines. We\ninvestigate the linearised, 3D MHD equations under the assumptions of ideal and\ncold plasma. We utilise the WKB approximation and Charpit's method during our\ninvestigation. It is found that the behaviour of the fast magnetoacoustic wave\nis entirely dictated by the local, inhomogeneous, equilibrium Alfv\\'en speed\nprofile. All parts of the wave experience refraction during propagation, where\nthe magnitude of the refraction effect depends on the location of an individual\nwave element within the inhomogeneous magnetic field. The X-line, along which\nthe Alfv\\'en speed is identically zero, acts as a focus for the refraction\neffect. There are two main types of wave behaviour: part of the wave is either\ntrapped by the X-line or escapes the system, and there exists a critical\nstarting region around the X-line that divides these two types of behaviour.\nFor the set-up investigated, it is found that $15.5\\%$ of the fast wave energy\nis trapped by the X-line. We conclude that linear, $\\beta=0$ fast\nmagnetoacoustic waves can accumulate along X-lines and thus these will be\nspecific locations of fast wave energy deposition and thus preferential\nheating. The work here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic\ntopology of a system. We also demonstrate how the 3D WKB technique described in\nthis paper can be applied to other magnetic configurations.\n", "  In loop quantum gravity, a spherical black hole can be described in terms of\na Chern-Simons theory on a punctured 2-sphere. The sphere represents the\nhorizon. The punctures are the edges of spin-networks in the bulk which cross\nthe horizon and carry quanta of area. One can generalize this construction and\nmodel a rotating black hole by adding an extra puncture colored with the\nangular momentum J in the 2-sphere. We compute the entropy of rotating black\nholes in this model and study its semi-classical limit. After performing an\nanalytic continuation which sends the Barbero-Immirzi parameter to +/- i, we\nshow that the leading order term in the semi-classical expansion of the entropy\nreproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking law independently of the value of J.\n", "  We study the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients of double Grothendieck\npolynomials indexed by Grassmannian permutations. Geometrically, these are the\nstructure constants of the equivariant $K$-theory ring of Grassmannians.\nRepresenting the double Grothendieck polynomials as partition functions of an\nintegrable vertex model, we use its Yang-Baxter equation to derive a series of\nproduct rules for the former polynomials and their duals. The\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients that arise can all be expressed in terms of\npuzzles without gashes, which generalize previous puzzles obtained by\nKnutson-Tao and Vakil.\n", "  This note rebuts an old, but recurring claim by Antoniou, Davis and Diakonos\n[1] that the critical point and associated critical exponents reported in Ref.\n[2], is based on an erroneous treatment of scaling relations near the critical\npoint.\n", "  We define Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distances $\\hat{d}_\\alpha(z,\nz_c)$, $\\hat{d}_z(z, z_c)$, and $\\hat{d}_/(z, z_c)$ that do not depend on\ncosmological parameters. These BAO distances are measured as a function of\nredshift $z$ with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release DR12. From\nthese BAO distances alone, or together with the correlation angle\n$\\theta_\\textrm{MC}$ of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we constrain the\ncosmological parameters in several scenarios. We find $4.3 \\sigma$ tension\nbetween the BAO plus $\\theta_\\textrm{MC}$ data and a cosmology with flat space\nand constant dark energy density $\\Omega_\\textrm{DE}(a)$. Releasing one and/or\nthe other of these constraints obtains agreement with the data. We measure\n$\\Omega_\\textrm{DE}(a)$ as a function of $a$.\n", "  Understanding the electronic and phononic transport properties of junctions\nconsisting of a scattering region such as a nanoscale matters or molecules\nconnected to two or more electrodes is the central basis for future nano and\nmolecular scale applications. The theoretical and mathematical techniques to\ntreat electron and phonon transport are leading to model the physical\nproperties of nano and molecular scale junctions. My aim in this paper is to\nreview the theoretical and mathematical techniques to treat electron and phonon\ntransport in nano and molecular scale junctions leading to models of their\nphysical properties. This helps not only to understand the experimental\nobservations but also provides a vital design tool to develop strategies for\nmolecular electronic building blocks, thermoelectric device and sensors.\n", "  The requirement of axial magnetic field for focusing and transportation of\nsheet beam using cusped magnets is less as compared to solenoid magnetic fields\nwhich is uniform. There is often some confusion about how a cusped magnetic\nfield focuses high current density sheet beam because it is generally\nunderstood that non-uniform magnetic field cannot guide the particle beam along\nits axis of propagation .In this paper, we perform simple analysis of the\ndynamics of sheet beam in a cusped magnetic field with single electron model\nand emphasize an intuitive understanding of interesting features (as beam\ngeometry, positioning of permanent magnets, particle radius,particle\nvelocity,radius of curvature of particle inside cusped magnetic field)\n", "  A non-native English speaking physics professor formulates obvious yet useful\nrules for writing research papers.\n"]}
