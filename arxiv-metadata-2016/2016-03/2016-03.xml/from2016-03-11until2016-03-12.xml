  Static Magnetic Field at First Order</title><categories>quant-ph hep-th</categories><comments>4 figures, 12 pages, content refined</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We investigate the spin dynamics and the conservation of helicity in the
first order $S-$matrix of a Dirac particle in any static magnetic field. We
express the dynamical quantities using a coordinate system defined by the three
mutually orthogonal vectors; the total momentum
$\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{p_f}+\mathbf{p_i}$, the momentum transfer
$\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{p_f-p_i}$, and $\mathbf{l}=\mathbf{k\times q}$. We show
that this leads to an alternative symmetric description of the conservation of
helicity in a static magnetic field at first order. In particular, we show that
helicity conservation in the transition can be viewed as the invariance of the
component of the spin along $\mathbf{k}$, and the flipping of its component
along $\mathbf{q}$, just as what happens to the momentum vector of a ball
bouncing off a wall. We also derive a &quot;plug and play&quot; formula for the
transition matrix element where the only reference to the specific field
configuration, and the incident and outgoing momenta is through the kinematical
factors multiplying a general matrix element that is independent of the
specific vector potential present.

of pseudospin in realistic models of weakly disordered graphene-based
materials. Using an efficient Kubo computational method, and simulating the
effect of charges trapped in the oxide, different magnetoconductance
fingerprints are numerically obtained in system sizes as large as 0.3
micronmeter squared, containing tens of millions of carbon atoms. In
two-dimensional graphene, a strong valley mixing is found to irreparably yield
a positive magnetoconductance (weak localization), whereas crossovers from
positive to a negative magnetoconductance (weak antilocalization) are obtained
by reducing disorder strength down to the ballistic limit. In sharp contrast,
graphene nanoribbons with lateral size as large as 10nm show no sign of weak
antilocalization, even for very small disorder strength. Our results
rationalize the emergence of a complex phase diagram of magnetoconductance
fingerprints, shedding some new light on the microscopical origin of pseudospin
effects.

series at certain special values of their analytic parameter s. These series
arise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy
expansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory
reduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d&lt;8. For each d these amplitudes
are automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular
significance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when
expanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain
limits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety
of instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the
limit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are
related to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines
wrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give
nonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third
limit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional
supergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions
have certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In
particular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly
fewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics
involves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported
on only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial
orbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial
orbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the
next-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and
hence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic
theta-functions.

the hottest fields in condensed matter physics and materials science[1-9].
However, the coexistence of magnetism and conventional ferroelectricity is
physically unfavoured[10]. Recently several remedies have been proposed, e.g.,
improper ferroelectricity induced by specific magnetic[6] or charge orders[2].
Guiding by these theories, currently most research is focused on frustrated
magnets, which usually have complicated magnetic structure and low magnetic
ordering temperature, consequently far from the practical application. Simple
collinear magnets, which can have high magnetic transition temperature, have
never been considered seriously as the candidates for multiferroics. Here, we
argue that actually simple interatomic magnetic exchange interaction already
contains a driving force for ferroelectricity, thus providing a new microscopic
mechanism for the coexistence and strong coupling between ferroelectricity and
magnetism. We demonstrate this mechanism by showing that even the simplest
antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator MnO, can display a magnetically induced
ferroelectricity under a biaxial strain.

Newtonian gravitation to spaces of constant positive curvature. Our goal is to
explore the spectral stability of tetrahedral orbits of the corresponding
4-body problem in the 2-dimensional case, a situation that can be reduced to
studying the motion of the bodies on the unit sphere. We first perform some
extensive and highly precise numerical experiments to find the likely regions
of stability and instability, relative to the values of the masses and to the
latitude of the position of three equal masses. Then we support the numerical
evidence with rigorous analytic proofs in the vicinity of some limit cases in
which certain masses are either very large or negligible, or the latitude is
close to zero.

  Society</comments><doi>10.1080/01972243.2014.944728</doi><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The dominant understanding of Internet censorship posits that blocking access
to foreign-based websites creates isolated communities of Internet users. We
question this discourse for its assumption that if given access people would
use all websites. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates access
blockage with social structures to explain web users' choices, and argue that
users visit websites they find culturally proximate and access blockage matters
only when such sites are blocked. We examine the case of China, where online
blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese web usage patterns
with those elsewhere. Analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited
websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography.
Chinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such
geo-linguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and degree of
isolation. Our sociological investigation reveals a greater role of cultural
proximity than access blockage in explaining online behaviors.

investigated. The cosmic string induces global oscillations of the Earth whose

the line density maximally allowed by the cosmic observations, the oscillations
are perceivable even to human beings and may cause serious damages to the
environment. Use of the sophisticated accelerograph enables us to detect the
string of a line density down to ten orders of magnitude smaller than the
cosmologically relevant value.

PD effluent samples were characterized using high resolution 1H and 1H-13C NMR
spectroscopy. The various spectra were recorded (at 800 MHz proton frequency)
on PD effluent samples obtained after 4 hour (intraperitoneal) dwell time from
patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) and continuing normally on PD
therapy. Inspite of devastating spectral feature of PD effluent due to the
presence of intense resonances from glucose and lactate, we were able to
identify about 53 small endogenous metabolites (including many complex coupled
spin systems) and more than 90 % of the total CH cross peaks of 1H-13C HSQC
spectrum were identified specific to various metabolites of PD effluent. We
foresee that the characteristic fingerprints of various metabolites of control
PD effluent samples will be used to identify and distinguish metabolic
differences from PD related complications.

triple resonance three dimensional NMR experiments involving amide 1H and 15N
resonances. However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical
proteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment
becomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In
this backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment
-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the
sequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR
experiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from
the joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity
involved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and
Hi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks. The experiment -encoding 5D spectral
information- leads to a conventional 3D spectrum with significantly reduced
spectral crowding and complexity. The improvisation is based on the fact that
the linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical
shifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral
range and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.
Taken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D
NMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and
13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve
the nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time
efficient manner. The performance of the experiment and application of the
method have been demonstrated here using a 15.4 kDa size folded protein and a
12 kDa size unfolded protein.

forces. Originally conceived to rectify stochastic motion and describe
operational principles of biological motors, the ratchet effect can be used to
achieve controllable coherent quantum transport. This transport is an
ingredient of several perspective quantum devices including atomic chips. Here
we examine coherent transport of ultra-cold atoms in a rocking quantum ratchet.
This is realized by loading a rubidium atomic Bose-Einstein condensate into a
periodic optical potential subjected to a biharmonic temporal drive. The
achieved long-time coherence allows us to resolve resonance enhancement of the
atom transport induced by avoided crossings in the Floquet spectrum of the
system. By tuning the strength of the temporal modulations, we observe a
bifurcation of a single resonance into a doublet. Our measurements reveal the
role of interactions among Floquet eigenstates for quantum ratchet transport.

  Signal From The Cosmic Dawn And The Dark Ages</title><categories>astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM</categories><comments>15 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal. This is
  an updated version after addressing the comments from the referee</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Detection of the global HI 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of
Reionization is the key science driver for several ongoing ground-based and
future ground/space-based experiments. The crucial spectral features in the
global 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies &lt;100 MHz.
In addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts
low-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we examine the
effects of time-varying ionospheric refraction, absorption and thermal emission
at these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based
global 21 cm experiment. It should be noted that this is the first study of the
effect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in
the ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise
characteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric
corruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere. As a result, any
ground based observations of the faint global 21 cm signal are corrupted by
flicker noise (or &quot;$1/f$&quot; noise, where &quot;$f$&quot; is the dynamical frequency) which
scales as $\nu^{-2}$ (where $\nu$ is the frequency of observation) in the
presence of a bright galactic foreground ($\propto \nu^{-s}$, where $s$ is
radio spectral index). Hence, the calibration of the ionosphere for any such
experiment is critical. Any attempt to calibrate the ionospheric effects will
be subject to the inaccuracies in the current ionospheric measurements using
GPS ionospheric measurements, riometer measurements, ionospheric soundings,
etc. Even considering an optimistic improvement in the accuracy of GPS-TEC
(Total Electron Content) measurements, we conclude that the detection of the
global 21 cm signal below 100 MHz is best done from above the Earth's
atmosphere in orbit of the Moon.

Gaussian curvature and study the relationship between the masses of the
Lagrangian relative equilibria, which are orbits that form a rigidly rotating
equilateral triangle at all times. There are three classes of Lagrangian
relative equilibria in 3-dimensional spaces of constant nonzero curvature:
positive elliptic and positive elliptic-elliptic, on 3-spheres, and negative
elliptic, on hyperbolic 3-spheres. We prove that all these Lagrangian relative
equilibria exist only for equal values of the masses.

the setting choices due to non-ideal random number generators. We discuss
necessary adaptations of the CH/Eberhard inequality when using such imperfect
devices and -- using Hoeffding's inequality and Doob's optional stopping

spatial complexity. Mount Wilson or McIntosh sunspot classifications measure
such complexity but in a categorical way, and may therefore not use all the
information present in the observations. Moreover, such categorical schemes
hinder a systematic study of an active region's evolution for example. We
propose fine-scale quantitative descriptors for an active region's complexity
and relate them to the Mount Wilson classification. We analyze the local
correlation structure within continuum and magnetogram data, as well as the
cross-correlation between continuum and magnetogram data. We compute the
intrinsic dimension, partial correlation, and canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) of image patches of continuum and magnetogram active region images taken
from the SOHO-MDI instrument. We use masks of sunspots derived from continuum
as well as larger masks of magnetic active regions derived from the magnetogram
to analyze separately the core part of an active region from its surrounding
part. We find the relationship between complexity of an active region as
measured by Mount Wilson and the intrinsic dimension of its image patches.
Partial correlation patterns exhibit approximately a third-order Markov
structure. CCA reveals different patterns of correlation between continuum and
magnetogram within the sunspots and in the region surrounding the sunspots.
These results also pave the way for patch-based dictionary learning with a view
towards automatic clustering of active regions.

The possibility that fundamental discreteness implicit in a quantum gravity
theory may act as a natural regulator for ultraviolet singularities arising in
quantum field theory has been intensively studied. Here, along the same
expectations, we investigate whether a nonstandard representation, called
polymer representation can smooth away the large amount of negative energy that
afflicts the Hamiltonians of higher-order time derivative theories; rendering
the theory unstable when interactions come into play. We focus on the
fourth-order Pais-Uhlenbeck model which can be reexpressed as the sum of two
decoupled harmonic oscillators one producing positive energy and the other
negative energy. As expected, the Schrodinger quantization of such model leads
to the stability problem or to negative norm states called ghosts. Within the
framework of polymer quantization we show the existence of new regions where
the Hamiltonian can be defined well bounded from below.

curvature perturbation is not identically invariant, but is invariant on
superhorizon scales for any theory that is disformally related to Horndeski's
theory. The difference between disformally related curvature perturbations is
found to be given in terms of the comoving density perturbation associated with
a single canonical scalar field. In General Relativity it is well-known that
this quantity vanishes on superhorizon scales through the Poisson equation that
is obtained on combining the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, and we
confirm that a similar result holds for any theory that is disformally related
to Horndeski's scalar-tensor theory so long as the invertibility condition for
the disformal transformation is satisfied. We also consider the curvature
perturbation at full nonlinear order in the unitary gauge, and find that it is
invariant under a general disformal transformation if we assume that an
attractor regime has been reached. Finally, we also discuss the counting of
degrees of freedom in theories disformally related to Horndeski's.

key issue in Space Weather applications. Traditional classification schemes
such as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been effective in relating an active
region large scale magnetic configuration to its ability to produce eruptive
events. However, their qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an
active region's evolution for example. We introduce a new clustering of active
regions that is based on the local geometry observed in Line of Sight
magnetogram and continuum images. We use a reduced-dimension representation of
an active region that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix
comprised of local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the
definition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The distances
obtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the active regions. We
find that these metrics result in natural clusterings of active regions. The
clusterings are related to large scale descriptors of an active region such as
its size, its local magnetic field distribution, and its complexity as measured
by the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We also find that including data
focused on the neutral line of an active region can result in an increased
correspondence between our clustering results and other active region
descriptors such as the Mount Wilson classifications and the $R$ value. We
provide some recommendations for which metrics, matrix factorization
techniques, and regions of interest to use to study active regions.

of height 4-30\% and four times the width of the local boundary layer thickness
$\delta_{99}$. The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped
plate is studied with particular emphasis on stabilisation and destabilisation
of the Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves and subsequently on transition. The
interaction between TS waves at a range of frequencies and a base flow over a
single/two forward facing smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis. The
results indicate that for a high frequency TS wave, the amplitude of the TS
wave is attenuated in the unstable regime of the neutral stability curve
corresponding to a flat plate boundary layer. Furthermore, it is observed that
two smooth forward facing steps lead to a more acute reduction of the amplitude
of the TS wave. When the height of a step is increased to more than 20\% of the
local boundary layer thickness for a fixed width parameter, the TS wave is
amplified and thereby a destabilisation effect is introduced. Therefore,
stabilisation or destabilisation effect of a smooth step is typically dependent
on its shape parameters. To validate the results of the linear stability
analysis, where a high-frequency TS wave is damped by the forward facing smooth
steps direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed. The results of the DNS
correlate favorably with the linear analysis and show that for the investigated
high frequency TS wave, the K-type transition process is altered whereas the
onset of the H-type transition is postponed. The results of the DNS suggest
that for a high-frequency perturbation $\mathcal{F}=150$ and in the absence of
other external perturbations, two forward facing steps of height 5\% and 12\%
of the boundary layer thickness delayed H-type transition scenario and
completely suppresses it for the K-type transition.

estimators) as well as information about the learning problem to improve upon
the performance of a single base learner. For example, the Bayes error rate of
a given feature space, if known, can be used to aid in choosing a classifier,
as well as in feature selection and model selection for the base classifiers
and the meta classifier. Recent work in the field of f-divergence functional
estimation has led to the development of simple and rapidly converging
estimators that can be used to estimate various bounds on the Bayes error. We
estimate multiple bounds on the Bayes error using an estimator that applies
meta learning to slowly converging plug-in estimators to obtain the parametric
convergence rate. We compare the estimated bounds empirically on simulated data
and then estimate the tighter bounds on features extracted from an image patch
analysis of sunspot continuum and magnetogram images.

steps requires that particles possess desired attributes such as size and
shape. Controlling the particle production process to obtain required
attributes will be greatly facilitated using robust algorithms providing the
size and shape information of the particles from in situ measurements. However,
obtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has
been a big challenge. This is because the problem of estimating particle size
and shape (aspect ratio) from signals provided by in-line measuring tools is
often ill posed, and therefore it calls for appropriate constraints to be
imposed on the problem. One way to constrain uncertainty in estimation of
particle size and shape from in-line measurements is to combine data from
different measurements such as chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging.
This paper presents two different methods for combining imaging and CLD data
obtained with in-line tools in order to get reliable estimates of particle size
distribution and aspect ratio, where the imaging data is used to constrain the
search space for an aspect ratio from the CLD data.

the pulsar wind. Inside the light cylinder both primary and secondary plasma
move along dipole magnetic field lines where their energies can be arbitrary.
But at larger distances the theory predicts quasi-radial motion with the
velocity exactly corresponding to the drift velocity which cannot be the same
for primary and secondary plasma. Hence, the deceleration of the primary beam
is to take place simultaneously resulting in the acceleration of the secondary
plasma. We investigate this process in the three-fluid MHD approximation and
demonstrate that for most pulsars the energy of the beam remains practically
unchanged. Only for young radio pulsars (Crab, Vela) essential deceleration up
to the energy of the secondary plasma takes place outside the fast magnetosonic
surface $r_{\rm F} \sim (10$-$100) R_{\rm L}$, the energy of secondary plasma
itself increasing insufficiently.

new iron-pnictide high temperature superconductor NaFeAs compared with the
recent high quality angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments on this
system [1]. The universal manifestation of correlation effects in
iron-pnictides is narrowing of conducting bands near the Fermi level. Our
calculations demonstrate that for NaFeAs the effective mass is renormalized on
average by a factor of the order of 3, in good agreement with ARPES data. This
is essentially due to correlation effects on Fe-3d orbitals only and no
additional interactions with with any kind of Boson modes, as suggested in [1],
are necessary to describe the experiment. Also we show that ARPES data taken at
about 160 eV beam energy most probably corresponds to $k_z=\pi$ Brillouin zone
boundary, while ARPES data measured at about 80 eV beam energy rather
represents $k_z=0$. Contributions of different Fe-3d orbitals into spectral
function map are also discussed.

  lower bound</title><categories>stat.ML physics.geo-ph stat.CO stat.ME</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Experimental design is crucial for inference where limitations in the data
collection procedure are present due to cost or other restrictions. Optimal
experimental designs determine parameters that in some appropriate sense make
the data the most informative possible. In a Bayesian setting this is
translated to updating to the best possible posterior. Information theoretic
arguments have led to the formation of the expected information gain as a
design criterion. This can be evaluated mainly by Monte Carlo sampling and
maximized by using stochastic approximation methods, both known for being
computationally expensive tasks. We propose a framework where a lower bound of
the expected information gain is used as an alternative design criterion. In
addition to alleviating the computational burden, this also addresses issues
concerning estimation bias. The problem of permeability inference in a large
contaminated area is used to demonstrate the validity of our approach where we
employ the massively parallel version of the multiphase multicomponent
simulator TOUGH2 to simulate contaminant transport and a Polynomial Chaos
approximation of the forward model that further accelerates the objective
function evaluations. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to a setting
where field measurements are available.

been widely used to describe the ground-state and excited-state properties for
the nuclei all over the nuclear chart. In order to describe exotic properties
of unstable nuclei, the contribution of the continuum and its coupling with
bound states should be treated properly. In this Topical Review, the
development of the covariant density functional theory in continuum will be
introduced, including the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory, the
relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory in continuum, and the deformed
relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum. Then the descriptions and
predictions of the neutron halo phenomena in both spherical and deformed nuclei
will be reviewed. The diffuseness of the nuclear potentials, nuclear shapes and
density distributions, and the impact of the pairing correlations on nuclear
size will be discussed.

set of gaps, where each gap represents a quantum Hall state whose quantized
conductivity is characterized by topological invariants known as the Chern
numbers. Here we obtain simple rules to determine the Chern numbers at all
scales in the butterfly fractal and lay out a very detailed topological map of
the butterfly. Our study reveals the existence of a set of critical points,
each corresponding to a macroscopic annihilation of orderly patterns of both
the positive and the negative Cherns that appears as a fine structure in the
butterfly. Such topological collapses are identified with the Van Hove
singularities that exists at every band center in the butterfly landscape. We
thus associate a topological character to the Van Hove anomalies. Finally, we
show that this fine structure is amplified under perturbation, inducing quantum
phase transitions to higher Chern states in the system.

activities, particularly of solar flares. Here, we develop a method to
construct thermodynamic spectrum (TDS) charts based on the EVE spectral lines.
This tool could be potentially useful to the EUV astronomy to learn the
eruptive activities on the distant astronomical objects. Through several cases,
we illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the
TDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than M5.0-class, and reach the
following statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft
X-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have a faster cooling rate. There
is a power law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates,
suggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions.
Second, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and
Type II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low
temperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares, the drift pattern
looks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are
more impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak
intensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with
the flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We
believe that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, that
unsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong
late phase found in a confined flare. Besides, with some cases we illustrate
the signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and
transition region in TDS charts. These results provide new clues to advance our
understanding of the thermodynamic processes of solar flares and associated
solar eruptions, e.g., coronal mass ejections.

competing against each other for middle-distance races, we present a
mathematical model relying on an optimal control problem for a system of
ordinary differential equations. The model is based on energy conservation and
on Newton's second law: resistive forces, propulsive forces and variations in
the maximal oxygen uptake are taken into account. The interaction between the
runners provides a minimum for staying one meter behind one's competitor. We
perform numerical simulations and show how a runner can win a race against
someone stronger by taking advantage of staying behind, or how he can improve
his personal record by running behind someone else. Our simulations show when
it is the best time to overtake, depending on the difference between the
athletes. Finally, we compare our numerical results with real data from the
men's 1500 -- m finals of different competitions.

attracting large interest. Indeed, a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an
important leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical
applications, such as certification of photonic quantum devices, whose
computational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle
interference. Quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many
particles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the Fourier
transformation in the Fock space. In this work we develop a scalable approach
for the implementation of quantum fast Fourier transform using 3-D photonic
integrated interferometers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique.
We observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4-
and 8-mode optical circuits: the experimental results demonstrate genuine
quantum interference between the injected photons, thus offering a powerful
tool for diagnostic of photonic platforms.

essentially non-linear quantum evolution, unusual in naturally occurring
quantum processes. Sensitivity to initial states in quantum systems, stemming
from such non-linear dynamics, is a promising perspective for applications.
Here we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state
selective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all initial states
in an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational
polynomial map, including the example of the Mandelbrot set, can be directly
realised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of initial
states, the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that
exponential sensitivity to initial states in any quantum system have to be
related to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially. Our results show
that magnifying initial differences of quantum states (a Schr\&quot;odinger
microscope) is possible, however, there is a strict bound on the number of
copies needed.

presence of a random distribution of structural vacancies. By using an
efficient real-space Kubo-Greenwood transport methodology, the impact of a
varying density of dimer versus non-dimer vacancies is investigated in very
large scale disordered models. While non-dimer vacancies are shown to induce
localization regimes, dimer vacancies result in an unexpected ballistic regime
whose energy window surprisingly enlarges with increasing impurity density.
Such counterintuitive phenomenon is explained by the formation of an effective
linear dispersion in the bilayer bandstructure, which roots in the symmetry
breaking effects driven by dimer vacancies, and provides a novel realization of
Dirac semimetals in high dimension.

end-facets of optical fibers, are used in an increasing number of technical and
scientific applications, where they typically require precise stabilization of
their optical resonances. Here, we study two different approaches to construct
fiber Fabry-Perot resonators and stabilize their length for experiments in
cavity quantum electrodynamics with neutral atoms. A piezo-mechanically
actuated cavity with feedback based on the Pound-Drever-Hall locking technique
is compared to a novel rigid cavity design that makes use of the high passive
stability of a monolithic cavity spacer and employs thermal self-locking and
external temperature tuning. Furthermore, we present a general analysis of the
mode matching problem in fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, which explains the
asymmetry in their reflective line shapes and has important implications for
the optimal alignment of the fiber resonators. Finally, we discuss the issue of
fiber-generated background photons. We expect that our results contribute
towards the integration of high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities into compact
and robust quantum-enabled devices in the future.

using nonequilibrium self-consistent perturbation theory within the second-Born
approximation. When compared with exact diagonalization performed on small
clusters, we demonstrate that for strong disorder this technique approaches the
exact result on all available timescales, while for intermediate disorder, in
the vicinity of the many-body localization transition, it produces
quantitatively accurate results up to nontrivial times. Our method allows for
the treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and
for the complete elimination of finite size effects for the times considered.
We show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes nonergodic,
while for intermediate disorder strengths and for all accessible time scales
transport in the system is strictly subdiffusive. We argue that these results
are incompatible with a simple percolation picture, but are consistent with the
heuristic random resistor network model where subdiffusion may be observed for
long times until a crossover to diffusion occurs. The prediction of slow
finite-time dynamics in a two-dimensional interacting and disordered system can
be directly verified in future cold atoms experiments

matter halos, galaxies, and supermassive black holes to estimate the formation
rates of supermassive black hole binaries and the resulting low-frequency
stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We find this GWB to be
relatively insensitive ($\lesssim10\%$) to cosmological parameters, with only
slight variation between WMAP5 and Planck cosmologies. We find that uncertainty
in the astrophysical scaling relations changes the amplitude of the GWB by a
factor of $\sim 2$. Current observational limits are already constraining this
predicted range of models. We investigate the Poisson variance in the amplitude
of the GWB for randomly-generated populations of supermassive black holes,
finding a scatter of order unity per frequency bin below 10 nHz, and increasing
to a factor of $\sim 10$ near 100 nHz. This variance is a result of the rarity
of the most massive binaries, which dominate the signal, and acts as a
fundamental uncertainty on the amplitude of the underlying power law spectrum.
This Poisson uncertainty dominates at $\gtrsim 20$ nHz, while at lower
frequencies the dominant uncertainty is related to our poor understanding of
the astrophysical scaling relations, although very low frequencies may be
dominated by uncertainties related to the final parsec problem and the
processes which drive binaries to the gravitational wave dominated regime.
Cosmological effects are negligible at all frequencies.

as modeled in the Q-tensor framework. The main purpose is to establish the
uniqueness of weak solutions in a two dimensional setting, without imposing an
extra regularity on the solutions themselves. This result only requires the
initial data to fulfill the features which allow the existence of a weak
solution. Thus, we also present a revisit of the global existence result in
dimension two and three.

configuration mixing of intruder excitations in the 118-128Te isotopes. A
transitional interacting boson model Hamiltonian in both IBM-1 and IBM-2
versions which are based on affine Lie Algebra are employed to describe the
evolution from spherical to deformed gamma unstable shapes along the chain of
Te isotopes. The excitation energies, B(E0) and B(E2) transition rates are
rather well reproduced in comparison with experimental counterparts when the
weight of SO(6) limit is increased in Hamiltonian. Also our results show
obvious relations between the configuration mixing ratio and quadrupole,
hexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole deformation values in this isotopic chain.

with \SLC structure group. The description is geometric and foliates in a
causal and physically transparent manner. The general observables of this model
are constructed from local Lorentz symmetry considerations only. For smooth
configurations, the local lattice actions reduce to the Hilbert-Palatini
action, a cosmological term and the three topological terms of dimension four
of Pontyagin, Euler and Nieh-Yan. Consistency conditions for a topologically
hypercubic complex with null 4-simplexes are derived and a topological lattice
theory that enforces these non-local constraints is constructed. The lattice
integration measure is derived from an \SLC-invariant integration measure by
localization of the non-local structure group. This measure is unique up to a
density that depends on the local 4-volume. It can be expressed in terms of
manifestly coordinate invariant geometrical quantities. The density provides an
invariant regularization of the lattice integration measure that suppresses
configurations with small local 4-volumes. Amplitudes conditioned on geodesic
distances between local observables have a physical interpretation and may have
a smooth ultraviolet limit. Numerical studies on small lattices in the
unphysical strong coupling regime of large imaginary cosmological constant
suggest that this model of triangulated causal manifolds is finite. Two
topologically different triangulations of space-time are discussed: a single,
causally connected universe and a duoverse with two causally disjoint connected
components. In the duoverse, two hypercubic sublattices are causally disjoint
but the local curvature depends on fields of both sublattices. This may
simulate effects of dark matter in the continuum limit.

as M\&quot;obius strip, real projective plane and Klein bottle, etc., which are
obtained by twisting the parent topological phases by their underlying pairty
symmetries through introducing parity defects. We construct the ground states
on arbitrary non-orientable closed manifolds and calculate the ground state
degeneracy. Such degeneracy is shown to be robust against continuous
deformation of the underlying manifold. We also study the action of the mapping
class group on the multiplet of ground states on the Klein bottle. The physical
properties of the topological states on non-orientable surfaces are deeply
related to the parity symmetric anyons which do not have a notion of
orientation in their statistics. The number of ground states on the projective
plane equals the root of the number of distinguishable parity symmetric anyons,
while the ground state degeneracy on the Klein bottle equals the total number
of parity symmetric anyons; In deforming the Klein bottle, the Dehn twist
encodes the topological spins whereas the Y-homeomorphism tells the
particle-hole relation of the parity symmetric anyons.

measurements of a weak interaction away from the weak-value-amplification
approximation. Two detectors are used to collect full statistics of the
correlations between two weakly entangled degrees of freedom. Without the need
of postselection, the protocol resembles the anomalous amplification of an
imaginary-weak-value-like response. The amplification is induced in the
difference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of
technical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals
for precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of
interest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response. We
experimentally demonstrate the proposed technique by measuring polarization
rotations in a linearly polarized laser pulse. The effective sensitivity and
precision of a split detector is increased when compared to a conventional
continuous-wave balanced detection technique.

and updated fits to the Cas A fast cooling data. Our model is built on the
assumption that the transient behaviour of the star in Cas A is due to a phase
transition within the dense QCD matter in the core of the star. Specifically,
the fast cooling is attributed to an enhancement in the neutrino emission
triggered by a transition from a fully gapped, two-flavor, red-green
color-superconducting quark condensate to a superconducting crystalline or an
alternative gapless, color-superconducting phase. The blue colored condensate
is modeled as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type color superconductor with
spin-one pairing order parameter. We study the sensitivity of the fits to the
phase transition temperature, the pairing gap of blue quarks and the time-scale
characterizing the phase transition (the latter modelled in terms of a width
parameter). Relative variations in these parameter around their best fit values
larger than $10^{-3}$ spoil the fit to the data. We confirm the previous
finding that the cooling curves show significant variations as a function of
compact star mass, which allows one to account for dispersion in the data on
the surface temperatures of thermally emitting neutron stars.

graphene and the upper time and length scales on which spin devices can operate
are prerequisites to realizing graphene spintronic technologies. Here we
theoretically reveal the nature of fundamental spin relaxation mechanisms in
clean graphene on different substrates with spin-orbit Rashba fields as low as
a few tens of micron eV. Spin lifetimes ranging from 50 picoseconds up to
several nanoseconds are found to be dictated by substrate-induced electron-hole
characteristics. A crossover in the spin relaxation mechanism from a
Dyakonov-Perel type for SiO2 substrates to a broadening-induced dephasing for
hBN substrates is described. The energy dependence of spin lifetimes, their
ratio for spins pointing out-of-plane and in-plane, and the scaling with
disorder provide a global picture about spin dynamics and relaxation in
ultraclean graphene in presence of electron-hole puddles.

study and compare the consequences of two GUPs that one implies a minimal
length while the other predicts a minimal length and a maximal momentum. Using
a semiclassical method, we exactly calculate the modified internal energies and
heat capacities in the presence of generalized commutation relations. We show
that the total shift in these quantities only depends on the deformed algebra
not on the system under study. Finally, the modified internal energy for an
specific physical system such as ideal gas is obtained in the framework of two
different GUPs.

(NMMs), discussing both the constraints on the magnitudes of the three
transition moments Lambda_i as well as the role of the CP violating phases
present both in the mixing matrix and in the NMM matrix. The scattering of
solar neutrinos off electrons in Borexino provides the most stringent
restrictions, due to its robust statistics and the low energies observed, below
1 MeV. Our new limit on the effective neutrino magnetic moment which follows
from the most recent Borexino data is 3.1 x 10^-11 mu_B at 90% C.L. This
corresponds to the individual transition magnetic moment constraints:
|Lambda_1| &lt; 5.6 x10^-11 mu_B, |Lambda_2| &lt; 4.0 x 10^-11 mu_B, and |Lambda_3| &lt;
3.1 x 10^-11 mu_B (90% C.L.), irrespective of any complex phase. Indeed, the
incoherent admixture of neutrino mass eigenstates present in the solar flux
makes Borexino insensitive to the Majorana phases present in the NMM matrix.
For this reason we also provide a global analysis including the case of reactor
and accelerator neutrino sources, and presenting the resulting constraints for
different values of the relevant CP phases. Improved reactor and accelerator
neutrino experiments will be needed in order to underpin the full profile of
the neutrino electromagnetic properties.

Corrected Holographic Dark Energy (PLECHDE) and the Logarithmic Entropy
Corrected Holographic Dark Energy (LECHDE) models in the context of Brans-Dicke
(BD) cosmology for both non-interacting and interacting DE and Dark Matter (DM)
are studied. As the system infrared cut-off, we choose the recently proposed
Granda-Oliveros cut-off, which contains a term proportional to the first time
derivative of the Hubble parameter and one term proportional to $H^2$, i.e. the
Hubble parameter squared. We obtain the expressions of three quantities, i.e.
the Equation of State (EoS) parameter $\omega_D$, the deceleration parameter
$q$ and the evolutionary form of the energy density parameter $\Omega'_D$ of
the PLECHDE and LECHDE models in a non-flat Universe for non-interacting and
interacting DE and DM as well. Moreover, we investigate the limiting cases
corresponding to: a) absence of entropy corrections; b) Einstein's gravity; and
c) concomitantly absence of entropy corrections and Einstein's gravity.
Furthermore, we consider the limiting case corresponding to the Ricci scale,
which is recovered for some particular values of the parameters characterizing
the Granda-Oliveros scale. We also study the statefinder diagnostic and the
cosmographic parameters for both models considered in this work.

they receive and their online experience. Although a host of socioeconomic and
cognitive factors were implicated in the formation of offline social ties, few
of them have been empirically validated, particularly in an online setting. In
this study, we analyze a large corpus of geo-referenced messages, or tweets,
posted by social media users from a major US metropolitan area. We linked these
tweets to US Census data through their locations. This allowed us to measure
emotions expressed in the tweets posted from an area, the structure of social
connections, and also use that area's socioeconomic characteristics in
analysis. %We extracted the structure of online social interactions from the
people mentioned in tweets from that area. We find that at an aggregate level,
places where social media users engage more deeply with less diverse social
contacts are those where they express more negative emotions, like sadness and
anger. Demographics also has an impact: these places have residents with lower
household income and education levels. Conversely, places where people engage
less frequently but with diverse contacts have happier, more positive messages
posted from them and also have better educated, younger, more affluent
residents. Results suggest that cognitive factors and offline characteristics
affect the quality of online interactions. Our work highlights the value of
linking social media data to traditional data sources, such as US Census, to
drive novel analysis of online behavior.

Gravito-Optical Surface Trap (GOST) allowing for transfer into the GOST with

compromise between simplicity and expressivity. It claims that central actors
are those connected with central others. For at least 70 years, this equation
has been explored in disparate contexts, including econometrics, sociometry,
bibliometrics, Web information retrieval, and network science. We propose an
equally elegant counterpart: the power equation $x = A x^{\div}$, where
$x^{\div}$ is the vector whose entries are the reciprocal of those of $x$. It
asserts that power is in the hands of those connected with powerless others. It
is meaningful, for instance, in bargaining situations, where it is advantageous
to be connected to those who have few options. We tell the parallel, mostly
unexplored story of this intriguing equation.

  Studies&quot;, Edited by: Giorgio Fasano, J\'anos D. Pint\'er. Springer, 2016</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The design of interplanetary trajectories often involves a preliminary search
for options later refined/assembled into one final trajectory. It is this broad
search that, often being intractable, inspires the international event called
Global Trajectory Optimization Competition. In the first part of this chapter,
we introduce some fundamental problems of space flight mechanics, building
blocks of any attempt to participate successfully in these competitions, and we
describe the use of the open source software PyKEP to solve them. In the second
part, we formulate an instance of a multiple asteroid rendezvous problem,
related to the 7th edition of the competition, and we show step by step how to
build a possible solution strategy. In doing so, we introduce two new
techniques useful in the design of this particular mission type: the use of an
asteroid phasing value and its surrogates and the efficient computation of
asteroid clusters. We show how the basic building blocks, sided to these
innovative ideas, allow designing an effective global search for possible
trajectories.

anyon Hubbard model is studied systematically on a one dimensional lattice. The
model can be expressed as a Bose-Hubbard model with a density-dependent-phase
term. When the phase angle is $\theta=0$ or $\theta=\pi$, the model will be
equivalent to boson and pseudo fermion models, respectively. In the mean field
frame, we find a broken-symmetry superfluid (BSF), in which the
$b^{\dagger}(b)$ operators on the nearest neighborhood sites have exactly
opposite directions and behave like a directed oscillation pattern. By the
density matrix reorganization group method, in the broken-symmetry superfluid,
both the real and imaginary parts of the correlation $b^{\dagger}_ib_{i+r}$
behave according to a {\it beat phenomenon} with $0&lt;\theta&lt;\pi$ in the form
$C_0e^{i k r}(-1)^{r}$ or behave like waves with different wavelengths in the
form $C_0e^{i k r}$. The distributions of the broken-symmetry superfluid phase
and other phases are shown in the phase diagrams with different values of
$\theta$ and the direct phase transition between the two types of superfluid is
observed. The beats phenomenon is explained by double peaks of momentum
distribution with two wave numbers ${k}_1$ and ${k}_2$ satisfying the condition
$\frac{{k}_1-{k}_2}{{k}_1+{k}_2}&lt;\frac{1}{3}$, which are expected to be
observed in the optical experiments.

II supernova with several hitherto-unseen properties. Although it initially
showed strong symmetric spectral emission features attributable to
\ion{He}{ii}, \ion{N}{iii}, and \ion{C}{iii}, reminiscent of some interacting
SNe, it transitioned into an object that would fall more naturally under a type
II-Plateau (IIP) classification. However, its spectral evolution revealed
several unusual properties: metal lines appeared later than expected, were
weak, and some species were conspicuous by their absence. Furthermore, the line
velocities were found to be lower than expected given the plateau brightness,
breaking the SNe~IIP standardised candle method for distance estimates. We
found that, in combination with a short phase of early-time
ejecta-circumstellar material interaction, metal-poor ejecta, and a large
progenitor radius could reasonably account for the observed behaviour.
Comparisons with synthetic model spectra of SNe~IIP of a given progenitor mass
would imply a progenitor star metallicity as low as 0.1\,Z$_{\odot}$. LSQ13fn
highlights the diversity of SNe~II and the many competing physical effects that
come into play towards the final stages of massive star evolution immediately
preceding core-collapse.

boson models in the thermodynamic limit with numerical linked cluster
expansions. We show that while quenches in which the initial state is a thermal
equilibrium state of an integrable model and the final Hamiltonian is
nonintegrable (quantum chaotic) lead to thermalization, the reverse is not
true. While this might appear counterintuitive given the fact that the
eigenstates of both Hamiltonians are related by a unitary transformation, we
argue that it is generic. Hence, the lack of thermalization of integrable
systems is robust against quenches starting from stationary states of
nonintegrable ones. Nonintegrable systems thermalize independently of the
nature of the initial Hamiltonian.

we found that at moderate buffer gas pressures RR-CPT did not improved the

Its connection
to the Mott insulator at low doping $p$ remains ambiguous and its relation to
the charge order that reconstructs the Fermi surface at intermediate $p$ is
still unclear. Here we use measurements of the Hall coefficient in magnetic
fields up to 88 T to show that Fermi-surface reconstruction by charge order in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ ends sharply at a critical doping $p = 0.16$, distinctly
lower than the pseudogap critical point at $p^* = 0.19$. This shows that
pseudogap and charge order are separate phenomena. We then find that the change
of carrier density from $n = 1 + p$ in the conventional metal at high p to $n =
p$ at low $p$ - a signature of the lightly doped cuprates - starts at $p^*$.
This shows that pseudogap and antiferromagnetic Mott insulator are linked.

+ $^{94,96}$Zr and $^{40}$Ca + $^{94,96}$Zr are studied with the universal
fusion function formalism and an empirical coupled channel (ECC) model. An
examination of the reduced fusion functions shows that the total effect of
couplings to inelastic excitations and neutron transfer channels on fusion in
$^{32}$S + $^{94}$Zr ($^{40}$Ca + $^{94}$Zr) is almost the same as that in
$^{32}$S + $^{96}$Zr ($^{40}$Ca + $^{96}$Zr). The enhancements of the fusion
cross section at sub-barrier energies due to inelastic channel coupling and
neutron transfer channel coupling are evaluated separately by using the ECC
model. The results show that effect of couplings to inelastic excitations
channels in the reactions with $^{94}$Zr as target should be similar as that in
the reactions with $^{96}$Zr as target. This implies that the quadrupole
deformation parameters $\beta_2$ of $^{94}$Zr and $^{96}$Zr should be similar
to each other. However, $\beta_2$'s predicted from the finite-range droplet
model, which are used in the ECC model, are quite different. Experiments on
$^{48}$Ca + $^{94}$Zr or $^{36}$S + $^{94}$Zr are suggested to solve the
puzzling issue concerning $\beta_2$ for $^{94}$Zr.

average in an Einstein-Maxwell background. For uncorrelated disorder this
perturbation is relevant however we show that it can become marginal or even
irrelevant by tuning disorder correlations. At zero temperature we find that,
to leading order in the disorder strength, the correction to the conductivity
for irrelevant perturbations vanishes. In the marginal case, in order to
renormalize a logarithmic divergence, we carry out a resummation of the
perturbative expansion of the metric that leads to a Lifshitz-like geometry in
the infrared. Disorder in this case also induces a positive correction to the
conductivity. At finite temperature the black hole acquires an effective charge
and the thermal conductivity has the expected Drude peak that signals the
breaking of translational invariance. However the electric conductivity is not
affected by the random chemical potential to leading order in the disorder
strength.

underlying-event activity in a pseudorapidity-separated region is studied in
4.0 pb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV $pp$ collision data recorded with the
ATLAS detector at the LHC. The underlying event is characterised through
measurements of the average value of the sum of the transverse energy at large
pseudorapidity downstream of one of the protons, which are reported here as a
function of hard-scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering is
characterised by the average transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the two
highest transverse momentum jets in the event. The dijet kinematics are used to
estimate, on an event-by-event basis, the scaled longitudinal momenta of the
hard-scattered partons in the target and projectile beam-protons moving toward
and away from the region measuring transverse energy, respectively. Transverse
energy production at large pseudorapidity is observed to decrease with a linear
dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton and to
depend only weakly on that in the projectile proton. The results are compared
to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, which qualitatively
reproduce the trends observed in data but generally underpredict the overall
level of transverse energy at forward pseudorapidity.

addressed by Hatano, Nelson, and followers. But we show that for a conservative
stochastic process the implied spectral properties are dramatically different.
In particular we determine the threshold for under-damped relaxation, and
observe &quot;complexity saturation&quot; as the bias is increased.

is shown to support bound state excitations, with a threshold, not present for
the pure Chern-Simons theory. In the present case, the bound state gets
destabilized by vacuum fluctuations. The bound state itself finds justification
in the duality of the theory with massive topological vector field. Thermal
fluctuations further destabilize this state, leading to smooth dissociation at
high temperatures. Physical systems are suggested for observing such a bound
state.

quantum Hall system on the torus geometry at total filling factor $\nu=1$ in
the lowest Landau level. We consider short-range interactions within and
between the two layers, as well as the inter-layer tunneling. In the fully
polarized regime, we provide an updated detailed numerical analysis to
establish the presence of the Moore-Read phase of both even and odd numbers of
particles. In the actual bilayer situation, we find that both inter-layer
interactions and tunneling can provide the physical mechanism necessary for the
low-energy physics to be driven by the fully polarized regime, thus leading to
the emergence of the Moore-Read phase. Inter-layer interactions favor a
ferromagnetic phase when the system is $SU(2)$ symmetric, while the inter-layer
tunneling acts as a Zeeman field polarizing the system. Besides the Moore-Read
phase, the $(220)$ Halperin state and the coupled Moore-Read state are also
realized in this model. We study their stability against each other.

non-Euclidian transformation on the SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) Grassmannian which give the
projected SO(2N+1) Tamm-Dancoff equation. We derive a classical time dependent
(TD) SO(2N+1) Lagrangian which, through the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion
for SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset variables, brings another form of the previous
extended-TD Hartree-Bogoliubov (HB) equation. The SO(2N+1) random phase
approximation (RPA) is derived using Dyson representation for paired and
unpaired operators. In the SO(2N) HB case, one boson and two boson excited
states are realized. We, however, stress non existence of a higher RPA vacuum.
An integrable system is given by a geometrical concept of zero-curvature, i.e.,
integrability condition of connection on the corresponding Lie group. From the
group theoretical viewpoint, we show the existence of a symplectic two-form
omega.

ellipsoidal particles carrying a linear quadrupole moment in their center.
These particles represent a simple model for a variety of uncharged, non-polar
conjugated organic molecules. Using optimization tools based on ideas of
Evolutionary Algorithms, we first examine the ground state structures as we
vary the aspect ratio of the particles and the pressure. Interestingly, we
find, besides the intuitively expected T-like configurations, a variety of
complex structures, characterized with up to three different particle
orientations. In an effort to explore the impact of thermal fluctuations, we
perform constant-pressure Molecular Dynamics simulations within a range of
rather low temperatures. We observe that ground state structures formed by
particles with a large aspect ratio are in particular suited to withstand
fluctuations up to rather high temperatures. Our comprehensive investigations
allow for a deeper understanding of molecular or colloidal monolayer
arrangements under the influence of a typical electrostatic interaction on a
coarse-grained level.

solutions to generally covariant gravitational theories with possibly other
internal gauge symmetries, in any dimensions and with generic asymptotic
behaviors. These solutions are generically specified by a number of exact
(continuous, global) symmetries and some parameters. We define &quot;parametric
variations&quot; as field perturbations generated by variations of the solution
parameters. Employing the covariant phase space method, we establish that the
set of these solutions (up to pure gauge transformations) form a phase space,
the \emph{solution phase space}, and that the tangent space of this phase space
includes the parametric variations. We then compute conserved charge variations
associated with the exact symmetries of the family of solutions, caused by
parametric variations. Integrating the charge variations over a path in the
solution phase space, we define the conserved charges. In particular, we
revisit &quot;black hole entropy as a conserved charge&quot; and the derivation of the
first law of black hole thermodynamics. We show that the solution phase space
setting enables us to define black hole entropy by an integration over any
compact, codminesion-2, smooth spacelike surface encircling the hole, as well
as to a natural generalization of Wald and Iyer-Wald analysis to cases
involving gauge fields.

lead to the formation of hybrid light--matter states where material properties
such as the work function\cite{Hutchison_AM2013a}, chemical
reactivity\cite{Hutchison_ACIE2012a}, ultra--fast energy relaxation
\cite{Salomon_ACIE2009a,Gomez_TJOPCB2012a} and electrical
conductivity\cite{Orgiu_NM2015a} of matter differ significantly to those of the
same material in the absence of strong interactions with the electromagnetic
fields. Here we show that strong light--matter coupling between confined
photons on a semiconductor waveguide and localised plasmon resonances on metal
nanowires modifies the efficiency of the photo--induced charge--transfer rate
of plasmonic derived (hot) electrons into accepting states in the semiconductor
material. Ultra--fast spectroscopy measurements reveal a strong correlation
between the amplitude of the transient signals, attributed to electrons
residing in the semiconductor, and the hybridization of waveguide and plasmon
excitations.

perovskite material at its interface with a another ferroelectric material
based on first principle calculations. The operating principle is that the
rotation of oxygen octahedra tuned by the ferroelectric polarization can
modulate the superexchange interaction in this perovskite. We designed a
tri-color superlattice of (BiFeO$_3$)$_N$/LaNiO$_3$/LaTiO$_3$, in which the
BiFeO$_3$ layers are ferroelectric, the LaNiO$_3$ layer is the layer of which
the electronic structure is to be tuned, and LaTiO$_3$ layer is inserted to
enhance the inversion asymmetry. By reversing the ferroelectric polarization in
this structure, there is a metal-insulator transition of the LaNiO$_3$ layer
because of the changes of crystal field splitting of the Ni $e_g$ orbitals and
the bandwidth of the Ni in-plane $e_g$ orbital. It is highly expected that a
metal-transition can be realized by designing the structures at the interfaces
for more materials.

Starting from a toy example, we show the computations for three different

have checked that our results match with the existing results at the analytical
level. This proposal can be automatized and should be useful to compute the
phase space for long cascade decays, without any Monte Carlo sampling.

generator WHIZARD. The program provides an automated FKS subtraction and phase
space integration over the FKS regions, while the (QCD) NLO matrix element is
accessed via the Binoth Les Houches Interface from an externally linked
one-loop program. Massless and massive test cases and validation are shown for
several e+e- processes. Furthermore, we discuss work in progress and future
plans. The second part covers the matching of the NRQCD prediction with NLL
threshold resummation to the NLO continuum top pair production at lepton
colliders. Both the S-wave and P-wave production of the top pair are taken into
account in the resummation. The inclusion in WHIZARD allows to study more
exclusive observables than just the total cross section and automatically
accounts for important electroweak and relativistic corrections in the
threshold region.

fluid flow and copper plate is carried out based on atomistic-continuum hybrid
method. Navier-Stokes equations for continuum domain are solved through the
Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm, and the atom
evolution in molecular domain is solved through the Verlet algorithm. The
solver is validated by solving Couette flow and heat conduction problems. With
both momentum and energy coupling method applied, simulations on convection of
argon flows between two parallel plates are performed. The top plate is kept as
a constant velocity and has higher temperature, while the lower one, which is
modeled with FCC copper lattices, is also fixed but has lower temperature. It
is found that, heat transfer between argon fluid flow and copper plate in this
situation is much higher than that at macroscopic when the flow is fully
developed.

As bigger
detectors are being built to increase their sensitivity, background reduction
is an ever more challenging issue. To this end, a new type of dark matter
detector is proposed, a xenon bubble chamber, which would combine the strengths
of liquid xenon TPCs, namely event by event energy resolution, with those of a
bubble chamber, namely insensitivity to electronic recoils. In addition, it
would be the first time ever that a dark matter detector is active on all three
detection channels, ionization and scintillation characteristic of xenon
detectors, and heat through bubble formation in superheated fluids. Preliminary
simulations show that, depending on threshold, a discrimination of 99.99\% to
99.9999+\% can be achieved, which is on par or better than many current
experiments. A prototype is being built at the University at Albany, SUNY. The
prototype is currently undergoing seals, thermal, and compression testing.

the statistical significance of observed results. The recent surge of big data
research has made the p-value an even more popular tool to test the
significance of a study. However, substantial literature has been produced
critiquing how p-values are used and understood. In this paper we review this
recent critical literature, much of which is routed in the life sciences, and
consider its implications for social scientific research. We provide a coherent
picture of what the main criticisms are, and draw together and disambiguate
common themes. In particular, we explain how the False Discovery Rate is
calculated, and how this differs from a p-value. We also make explicit the
Bayesian nature of many recent criticisms, a dimension that is often
underplayed or ignored. We conclude by identifying practical steps to help
remediate some of the concerns identified. We recommend that (i) far lower
significance levels are used, such as $0.01$ or $0.001$, and (ii) p-values are
interpreted contextually, and situated within both the findings of the
individual study and the broader field of inquiry (through, for example,
meta-analyses).

double expansion to obtain a generic axisymmetric metric expression. In
particular, we use a continued-fraction expansion in terms of a compactified
radial coordinate to express the radial dependence, while we exploit a Taylor
expansion in terms of the cosine of the polar angle for the polar dependence.
These choices lead to a superior convergence in the radial direction and to an
exact limit on the equatorial plane. As a validation of our approach, we build
parametrized representations of Kerr, rotating dilaton, and
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The match is already very good at
lowest order in the expansion and improves as new orders are added. We expect a
similar behavior for any stationary and axisymmetric black-hole metric.

two dimensions off-diagonal long-range order is destroyed by the fluctuations
at any finite temperature, drastically modifying the critical properties with
respect to the three-dimensional counterpart. Recently two-dimensional systems
of interacting fermions have been the subject of Montecarlo studies and
experimental investigations, in particular an ultracold gas of attractive
fermions with a widely tunable interaction due to a Feshbach resonance has been
realized and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition has been observed.
  The present work deals with the theoretical description of an ultracold Fermi
gas: we discuss the role of Gaussian fluctuations of the order parameter in the
equation of state, in particular we take into account the first sound velocity,
showing that the inclusion of order parameter fluctuations is needed in order
to get the correct composite-boson limit in the strong-coupling regime. The
theory is also compared with experimental data. Finally we focus on the
superfluid density in the weak-coupling, intermediate and strong-coupling
regimes at finite temperature, through which the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature is obtained.

Collider (FCC-ee) is summarized. The FCC-ee aims at collecting multi-ab$^{-1}$
integrated luminosities in $e^+e^-$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 90, 160, 240, and 350 GeV,
yielding 10$^{12}$ Z bosons, 10$^{8}$ W$^+$W$^-$ pairs, 10$^{6}$ Higgs bosons
and $4\cdot 10^{5}$ top-quark pairs per year. Such huge data samples combined
with a $\cal{O}(100 \rm keV)$ c.m. energy uncertainty will allow for Standard
Model measurements with unparalleled precision and searches for new physics in
regions not probed so far. The FCC-ee will be able to (i) indirectly discover
new particles coupling to the Higgs and electroweak bosons up to scales
$\Lambda \approx$ 7 and 100 TeV; (ii) perform competitive SUSY tests at the
loop level in regions beyond the LHC reach; and (iii) achieve the best
potential in direct collider searches for dark matter and sterile neutrinos
with masses below 60 GeV.

shape of the confining potential defining the wall. In contrast, it has been
shown recently [A.P. Solon et al., Nat. Phys. 11, 673 (2015)] that a gas of
overdamped active particles exerts on a wall a force that depends on the
confining potential, resulting in a net force on an asymmetric wall between two
chambers at equal densities. Here, considering a model of underdamped
self-propelled dumbbells in two dimensions, we study how the behavior of the
pressure depends on the damping coefficient of the dumbbells, thus exploring
inertial effects. We find in particular that the force exerted on a moving wall
between two chambers at equal density continuously vanishes at low damping
coefficient, and exhibits a complex dependence on the damping coefficient at
low density, when collisions are scarce. We further show that this behavior of
the pressure can to a significant extent be understood in terms of the
trajectories of individual particles close to and in contact with the wall.

new era of exoplanet spectroscopy. JWST will be the first telescope sensitive
enough to potentially characterize terrestrial planets from their transmission
spectra. In this work, we explore the possibility that terrestrial planets with
Venus-type and Earth-type atmospheres could be distinguished from each other
using spectra obtained by JWST. If we find a terrestrial planet close to the
liquid water habitable zone of an M5 star within a distance of 10 parsecs, it
would be possible to detect atmospheric ozone if present in large enough
quantities, which would enable an oxygen-rich atmosphere to be identified.
However, the cloudiness of a Venus-type atmosphere would inhibit our ability to
draw firm conclusions about the atmospheric composition, making any result
ambiguous. Observing small, temperate planets with JWST requires significant
investment of resources, with single targets requiring of order 100 transits to
achieve sufficient signal to noise. The possibility of detecting a crucial
feature such as the ozone signature would need to be carefully weighed against
the likelihood of clouds obscuring gas absorption in the spectrum.

beam epitaxy on Si substrates. We produce films in the full composition range
from x = 0 to 3, and determine their material properties using energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. By
fitting the parameters of a kinetic growth model to these results, we obtain a
consistent description of growth at a microscopic level. Our main finding is
that despite the incorporation of Se in the central layer being much more
probable than that of Te, the formation of a fully ordered Te-Bi-Se-Bi-Te layer
is prevented by kinetic of the growth process. Indeed, the Se concentration in
the central layer of Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se$_1$ reaches a maximum of only $\approx$ 75%
even under ideal growth conditions. A second finding of our work is that the
intensity ratio of the 0 0 12 and 0 0 6 X-ray reflections serves as an
experimentally accessible quantitative measure of the degree of ordering in
these films.

insulator, and the surrounding conventional insulators, including vacuum, are
not generally treated as part of the TI system. Here, we implement the first
material system where the roles are reversed, and the TSS form around the
non-TI (instead of the TI) layers. This is realized by growing a layer of the
tunable non-TI $(Bi_{1-x}In_{x})_{2}Se_{3}$ in between two layers of the TI
$Bi_2Se_3$ using the atomically-precise molecular beam epitaxy technique. On
this tunable inverse topological platform, we systematically vary the thickness
and the composition of the $(Bi_{1-x}In_{x})_{2}Se_{3}$ layer and show that
this tunes the coupling between the TI layers from strongly-coupled metallic to
weakly-coupled, and finally to a fully-decoupled insulating regime. This system
can be used to probe the fundamental nature of coupling in TI materials and
provides a tunable insulating layer for TI devices.

spin-based logic devices and spintronic circuits. Graphene has been heralded as
an ideal material to achieve spin manipulation but so far new paradigms and
demonstrators are limited. Here we show that certain impurities such as
fluorine ad-atoms, which locally break sublattice symmetry without the
formation of strong magnetic moment, could result in a remarkable variability
of spin transport characteristics. The impurity resonance level is found to be
associated with a long range sublattice pseudospin polarization, which by
locally decoupling spin and pseudospin dynamics, provokes a huge spin lifetime
electron-hole asymmetry. In the dilute impurity limit, spin lifetimes could be
tuned electrostatically from hundred picoseconds to several nanoseconds,
providing a protocol to chemically engineer an unprecedented spin device
functionality.

phosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and even nitrogene. Motivated by them, based
upon first-principles density functional calculations, we propose a new
two-dimensional phosphorus nitride (PN) structure that is stable well above the
room temperature, due to its extremely high cohesive energy. Unlike
phosphorene, PN structure is resistant to high temperature oxidation. The
structure is predicted to be a semiconductor with a wide, indirect band gap of
2.64 eV. More interestingly, the phosphorus nitride monolayer experiences an
indirect-to-direct band-gap transition at a relatively small tensile strain.
Such dramatic transformation in the electronic structure combined with
structural stability and oxidation resistance at high temperature could pave
the way for exciting innovations in high-speed ultrathin transistors, power
electronic modules, ultra-high efficiency LEDs and semiconductor lasers.

time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform dictionary
design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for reconstructing missing
information from graph signals via sparse representations, and yield new graph
analysis tools. While previous work has focused on generalizing notions of
spreads of a graph signal in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our
approach is to generalize the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty
principles that provide limits on the concentration of the analysis
coefficients of any graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are
jointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data domain,
the local structure in a single small region of the graph can drastically
affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in different regions of
the graph, limiting the information provided by global uncertainty principles.
Accordingly, we suggest a new way to incorporate a notion of locality, and
develop local uncertainty principles that bound the concentration of the
analysis coefficients of each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame
in terms of quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around
the center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed
local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of graph signals.

attributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra, even when the
signal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this is possible when the
dimensionality of the label space is large (Teff, logg, and 15 abundances: C,
N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear
in its response to abundance and parameter changes. We adopt ideas from
compressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model
freedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high
signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and
abundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train
and use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a
good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex),
even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding ~50% of the observing
time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect
to abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements
belonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover
(anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent
with the literature. However we find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster
abundances is 3--4 times smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels
with associated errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code
to extend this work to other spectroscopic surveys.

Felline, F. Paoli, and E. Rossanese (editors), New
  Developments in Logic and Philosophy of Science. London: College Publications</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Bohmian mechanics is a realistic interpretation of quantum theory. It shares
the same ontology of classical mechanics: particles following continuous
trajectories in space through time. For this ontological continuity, it seems
to be a good candidate for recovering the classical limit of quantum theory.
Indeed, in a Bohmian framework, the issue of the classical limit reduces to
showing how classical trajectories can emerge from Bohmian ones, under specific
classicality assumptions. In this paper, we shall focus on a technical problem
that arises from the dynamics of a Bohmian system in bounded regions; and we
suggest that a possible solution is supplied by the action of environmental
decoherence. However, we shall show that, in order to implement decoherence in
a Bohmian framework, a stronger condition is required (disjointness of
supports) rather than the usual one (orthogonality of states).

  Theory&quot;</title><categories>hep-ph</categories><comments>15 pages, 1 figure</comments><report-no>LMU-ASC 10/16</report-no><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In a recent paper [1] a master formula has been presented for the power
counting of a general effective field theory. We first show that this master
formula follows immediately from the concept of chiral dimensions (loop
counting), together with standard dimensional analysis. Subsequently, [1] has
disputed the relevance of chiral counting for chiral Lagrangians, and in
particular for the electroweak chiral Lagrangian including a light Higgs boson.
As an alternative, a power counting based on `primary dimensions' has been
proposed. The difficulties encountered with this scheme led the authors to
suggest that even the leading order of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian could
not be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that the concept of primary
dimensions is irrelevant for the organization of chiral Lagrangians. We
re-emphasize that the correct counting is based on chiral dimensions, or the
counting of loop orders, and show how the problems encountered in [1] are
resolved.

kink in its band dispersion signalling the unusual electron dynamics therein.
However, the origin of this kink remains elusive. By taking advantage of the
combo of reactive molecular beam epitaxy and in situ angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we systematically studied the evolution of the
low-energy electronic structure of SrRuO3 films with thickness thinning down to
nearly two-dimensional limit in a well-controlled way. The kink structure
persists even in the 4-unit-cell-thick film. Moreover, through quantitative
self-energy analysis, we observed the negligible thickness dependence of the
binding energy of the kink, which is in sharp contrast to the downward trend of
the Curie temperature with reducing the film thickness. Together with
previously reported transport and Raman studies, this finding suggests that the
kink of perovskite SrRuO3 should originate from the electron-phonon coupling
rather than magnetic collective modes, and the in-plane phonons may play a
dominant role. Considering such a kink structure of SrRuO3 is similar to these
of many other correlated oxides, we suggest the possible ubiquity of the
coupling of electrons to oxygen-related phonons in correlated oxides.

angular frequency on the quantum numbers of the system is obtained. In
particular, it is shown that the possible values of the angular frequency
associated with the ground state of the system are determined by a third-degree
algebraic equation.

Observatory (NRAO) have collaborated to develop, install, and commission a new
commensal system on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The VLA Low Band
Ionospheric and Transient Experiment (VLITE) makes use of dedicated samplers
and fibers to tap the signal from 10 VLA low band receivers and correlate those
through a real-time DiFX correlator. VLITE allows for the simultaneous use of
the VLA to observe primary science using the higher frequencies receivers (1-50
GHz) through the NRAO WIDAR correlator and lower frequencies through the DiFX
correlator. VLITE operates during nearly all observing programs and provides 64
MHz of bandwidth centered at 352 MHz. The operation of VLITE requires no
additional resources from the VLA system running the primary science and
produces an ad-hoc sky survey. The commensal system greatly expands the
capabilities of the VLA through value-added PI science, stand-alone
astrophysics, the opening of a new window on transient searches, and
serendipity. In the first year of operation we have recorded more than 6300
hours spread across the sky. We present an overview of the VLITE program,
discuss the sky coverage and depth obtained during the first year of operation,
and briefly outline the astrophysics and transients programs.

their own mistakes. Experts are unlikely to make the same mistakes when asked
to solve a problem a second time, especially if they have had access to a
correct solution. Here, we discuss a case study in which fourteen advanced
undergraduate physics students taking an honors-level quantum mechanics course
were given the same four problems in both a midterm and final exam. The
solutions to the midterm problems were provided to students. The performance on
the final exam shows that while some advanced students performed equally well
or improved compared to their performance on the midterm exam on the questions
administered a second time, a comparable number performed less well on the
final exam than on the midterm exam. The wide distribution of students'
performance on problems administered a second time suggests that most advanced
students do not automatically exploit their mistakes as an opportunity for
learning, and for repairing, extending, and organizing their knowledge
structure. Interviews with a subset of students revealed attitudes towards
problem-solving and gave insight into their approach to learning.

progress towards a solution. One characteristic of expertise is self-diagnosis
directed towards elaboration of the solvers' conceptual understanding,
knowledge organization or strategic approach. &quot;Self-diagnosis tasks&quot; aim at
fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present
diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. We have
been investigating how introductory physics students perform in such tasks.
Developing a robust rubric is essential for objective evaluation of students'
self-diagnosis skills. We discuss the development of a grading rubric that
takes into account introductory physics students' content knowledge as well as
analysis, planning and presentation skills. Using this rubric, we have found
the inter-rater reliability to be better than 80%. The rubric can easily be
adapted to other problems, as will be discussed in a companion paper.

  application to fault diagnosis</title><categories>quant-ph</categories><comments>22 pages, 4 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations
such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and
control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In
particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a
hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two
new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly
into hardware.
  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising
models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in
different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In
contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising
model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to
generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of
CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local
mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.
  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based
fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is
typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N
using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a
leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms
to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than
can be solved directly on current hardware.

three premises: (1) The carrier of the DIB is polar as concluded by T. Oka et
al. from the anomalous spectrum toward Herschel 36. (2) The sharp central
feature observed by P. J. Sarre's group is the $Q$-branch of a parallel band of
a prolate top. (3) The radiative temperature of the environment is $T_r$=2.73
K.
  A $^2 \Pi \leftarrow$ $^2\Pi$ transition of a linear radical is simulated.
Results depend on 10 parameters, with the rotational constant $B$ being the
most critical. Comparisons of calculated spectra with observed data constrain
$B$, which in turn constrains the number of heavy atoms to 5 $\leq n \leq 7$.
Upper limits based on the Her 36 spectrum and lower limits based on stability
against photodissociation are also discussed. The latter is based on the
assumption that the DIB molecules are produced top-down from the breakdown of
dust rather than bottom-up by chemical reactions.
  A difficulty with this limit is that J. P. Maier's laboratory has observed
many molecules within this size range, some of which have been tested
astronomically. Candidates are discussed in light of many prolate tops observed
by the P. Thaddeus and M. C. McCarthy microwave group.

distribution is studied. It is shown how the information leakage through a side
channel from the trusted sender station increases the vulnerability of the
protocols to the eavesdropping in the main quantum communication channel.
Moreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted
receiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum
channel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage
on the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the
side-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light
on the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation
on the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case
of the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side
channel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving
side, the method of optimal monitoring of the residual noise from the
side-channel noise infusion is suggested and shown to be able to completely
eliminate the presence of the noisy side channel. We therefore prove that the
side-channel effects can be completely removed using feasible operations if the
trusted parties access the respective parts of the side channels.

The observed images illustrate not only pieces of a triangular vortex lattice

metastable ones. We comparatively analyze vortex configurations found in
different sample geometries and discuss the symmetry and stability of
commensurate and incommensurate vortex configurations against deformations of
the sample shape.

characteristics of nanoscale field-effect transistors are derived. The meaning
of carrier mobility at the nanoscale is discussed by defining two related
quantities, the apparent mobility and the ballistic mobility. The validity of
Matthiessen's Rule for relating the apparent ability to the ballistic and
diffusive mobilities is examined. Other questions that arise in the analysis
and characterization of nanoscale field-effect transistors are also discussed.
These notes are intended to pull together in one place some key equations
needed to analyze the linear region performance of nanoscale MOSFETs and to
point out some errors in previous publications.

debate concerning the notions of intrinsic/extrinsic frame-dragging, the use of
the electromagnetic analogy in such classification, and the question of whether
there is a fundamental difference between the gravitomagnetic field arising
from the translational motion of the sources, detected with Lunar Laser Raging
and in the observations of binary pulsars, and the gravitomagnetic field
produced by the rotation of the Earth, detected in the LAGEOS Satellites data
and by the Gravity Probe-B mission. In this work we clarify both the algebraic
and physical meaning of the curvature invariants and their electromagnetic
counterparts. The structure of the invariants of the astrophysical setups of
interest is studied in detail, and its relationship with the gravitomagnetic
effects is dissected. Finally, a new classification for intrinsic/extrinsic
gravitomagnetism is put forth.

and nonlinearity and allows coherent, low-noise comb operation. We study the
intracavity waveform of an on-chip microcavity soliton in a silicon nitride
microresonator configured with a drop port. Whereas combs measured at the
through port are accompanied by a very strong pump line which accounts for &gt;99%
of the output power, our experiments reveal that inside the microcavity, most
of the power is in the soliton. Time-domain measurements performed at the drop
port provide information that directly reflects the intracavity field. Data
confirm a train of bright, close to bandwidth-limited pulses, accompanied by a
weak continuous wave (CW) background with a small phase shift relative to the
comb.

driven by radio frequency electric fields to cause nuclear magnetic resonance.
The resulting spectra are discussed in terms of both large quadrupole fields
created around the wire and hyperfine fields associated with the oscillating
domain walls. This provides the experimental fact that the domain walls survive
near the confined geometry despite of potential deformation, by which a
localized magnetic resonance is allowed in electrical means.

in the Earth's fluid core and core-mantle coupling, which are also largely
responsible for the geomagnetic field variations, particularly the geomagnetic
jerks (GMJs). A previous study (Malkin, 2013) revealed that the epochs of the
observed extremes in the FCN amplitude and phase variations are close to the
GMJ epochs. In this paper, a new evidence of this connection was found. The
large FCN amplitude and phase disturbance occurred at the epoch close to the
newly revealed GMJ 2011. This event occurred to be the second large change in
the FCN amplitude and phase after the 1999 disturbance that is also associated
with the GMJ 1999. Moreover, the long-time FCN phase drift had changed suddenly
in 1998--1999, immediately before the GMJ 1999, and seemed to change again at
the epoch immediately preceding the GMJ 2011. The FCN amplitude showed a
general long-time decrease before GMJ 1999, and it subsequently grew until GMJ
2011, and then seemed to decrease again. A smaller FCN change can be observed
at the epoch around 2013, which is also suspected as the GMJ epoch. The latter
confirms the suggestion that a rapid change in the FCN amplitude and/or phase
can be used as an evidence of the GMJ that is not clearly detected from the
geomagnetic observations.

carbon capture applications due to their high CO2 capacities and tunable
properties. Amongst the many possible MOFs, metal-substituted compounds based
on M-DOBDC and M-HKUST-1 have demonstrated amongst the highest CO2 capacities
at the low pressures typical of flue gasses. Here we explore the possibility
for additional performance tuning of these compounds by computationally
screening 36 metal-substituted variants (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W, Sn, and Pb) with respect to their CO2 adsorption
enthalpy, $\Delta$H (T=300K). Supercell calculations based on van der Waals
density functional theory (vdW-DF) yield enthalpies in good agreement with
experimental measurements, out-performing semi-empirical (DFT-D2) and
conventional (LDA and GGA) functionals. Our screening identifies 13 compounds
having $\Delta$H values within the targeted thermodynamic window 40 $\leq$
$\Delta$H $\leq$ 75 kJ/mol: 8 are based on M-DODBC (M=Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Ti, V,
Mo, and W), and 5 on M-HKUST-1 (M= Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Sc). Variations in the
electronic structure and the geometry of the structural building unit are
examined and used to rationalize trends in CO2 affinity. In particular, the
partial charge on the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites is found to
correlate with $\Delta$H, suggesting that this property may be used as a simple
performance descriptor. The ability to rapidly distinguish promising MOFs from
those that are &quot;thermodynamic dead-ends&quot; will be helpful in guiding synthesis
efforts towards promising compounds.

material engineering is a broad avenue to be explored, since it makes possible
steps toward the limits of quantum mechanics and the design of novel materials
with applications on emerging quantum technologies. In this context, this
Letter explores the potential of molecular magnets to be prototypes of
materials for quantum information technology. More precisely, we engineered a
material and from its geometric quantum discord we found significant quantum
correlations up to 9540 K (even without entanglement); and, in addition, a pure
singlet state occupied up to around 80 K (above liquid nitrogen temperature).
These results could only be achieved due to the carboxylate group promoting a
metal-to-metal huge magnetic interaction.

where atoms interact through nonlocal pair potentials, is presented. A special
attention is paid to nonintegrable potentials, such as the dipolar interaction
potential. The potentials that are not absolutely integrable can have not well
defined Fourier transforms. Using formally such not defined Fourier transforms
leads to unphysical conclusions. For making the Fourier transform well defined,
the interaction potential has to be regularized. This is illustrated by the
example of dipolar interactions.

with topological features and where the bandwidths and bandgaps are
dramatically broadened. The resulting edge modes cover a very wide frequency
range. We relate this behavior to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian
describing the system's amplitudes is long-range. We also develop a method to
analyze the scheme in the presence of a Kerr medium. We assess robustness and
stability of the topological features, and predict the presence of chiral
squeezed fluctuations at the edges in some parameter regimes.

individual systems are in agreement with values reported in previous studies.
We refined transit ephemerides and reduced uncertainties of orbital periods by
a factor between 2 and 7. No sign of any variations in transit times was
detected for the planets studied.

with Swift, the Chandra HETG and NuSTAR during its recent dwarf nova (DN)
outburst in March - April 2015. Monitoring the outburst, we noticed several
processes occurring on different time scales, such as: the slow evolution of
the very soft X-ray emission (below 0.6 keV) during the first two weeks of the
outburst and the very fast saturation of the X-ray flux above 1 keV. The Swift
UVOT lights curves also showed different behaviour, depending on the filter.
The broad band X-ray spectra revealed the presence of at least three different
emitting sources. The white dwarf (WD) spin was observed even in the very hard
X-ray range of NuSTAR, indicating that the modulation is not due to absorption,
in contrast to a typical IP. It is also supported by the similarity of the
on-pulse and off-pulse X-ray spectra. We propose that the scenario when the
inner accretion disk pushed towards the WD by the increased accretion obscures
the lower WD pole can work also for GK Per.

narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Was~61 using 90 ks archival {\it XMM-Newton} data.
The X-ray spectrum in 0.2-10 keV can be characterized by an absorbed power-law
plus soft excess and an Fe K$\alpha$ emission line. The power-law spectral
index remains constant during the flux variation. The absorbing material is
mildly ionized, with a column density of 3.2$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, and
does not appear to vary during the period of the X-ray observation. If the same
material causes the optical reddening (E(B-V)$\simeq$0.6 mag), it must be
located outside the narrow line region with a dust-to-gas ratio similar to the
average Galactic value. We detect significant variations of the Fe K$\alpha$
line during the observational period. A broad Fe K$\alpha$ line at $\simeq$6.7
keV with a width of $\sim$0.6 keV is detected in the low flux segment of the
first 40 ks exposure, and is absent in the spectra of other segments; a narrow
Fe K$\alpha$ emission line $\sim$6.4 keV with a width of $\sim$0.1 keV is
observed in the subsequent 20 ks segment, which has a count rate of 35% higher
and is in the next day. We believe this is due to the change in geometry and
kinematics of the X-ray emitting corona. The temperature and flux of soft X-ray
excess appear to correlate with the flux of the hard power-law component.
Comptonization of disc photons by a warm and optically thick inner disk is
preferred to interpret the soft excess, rather than the ionized reflection.

in two catalogs: the extended Greenwich (1874--2014) and Schwabe ones
(1825--1867). We demonstrate that both datasets reveal similar links between
latitude and amplitude characteristics of the 11-year cycle: the latitude
dispersion correlates with the current activity and the mean latitude of
sunspots in the cycle's maximum is proportional to its amplitude, It agrees
with conclusions that we made in previous papers for the Greenwich catalog.
  We show that the latitude properties of sunspot distribution are much more
stable against loss of observational data than traditional amplitude indices of
activity. Therefore, the found links can be used for estimates of quality of
observations and independent normalizing of activity levels in a gappy
pre-Greenwich data. We demonstrate it using the Schwabe catalog as an example.
  In addition, we show that the first part of the Schwabe data probably
contains errors in determination of sunspot latitudes that lead to
overestimation of the sunspot latitude dispersions.

trends in social media content. There is still relatively little understanding,
however, of methods to characterize the early adopters of these trends: who
picks up on these trends at different points in time, and what is their role in
the system? We develop a framework for analyzing the population of users who
participate in trending topics over the course of these topics' lifecycles.
Central to our analysis is the notion of a &quot;status gradient&quot;, describing how
users of different activity levels adopt a trend at different points in time.
Across multiple datasets, we find that this methodology reveals key differences
in the nature of the early adopters in different domains.

scale bolometric experiment whose detector consists of an array of 988 TeO2
crystals arranged in a cylindrical compact structure of 19 towers. This will be
the largest bolometric mass ever operated. The experiment will work at a
temperature around or below 10 mK. CUORE cryostat consists of a cryogen-free
system based on pulse tubes and a custom high power dilution refrigerator,
designed to match these specifications. The cryostat has been commissioned in
2014 at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories and reached a record temperature
of 6 mK on a cubic meter scale. In this paper, we present results of CUORE
commissioning runs. Details on the thermal characteristics and cryogenic
performances of the system will be also given.

is coupled into the silicon absorber with a twin-slot antenna designed to
couple to 160-GHz radiation through a silicon lens.The first device has a
highly doped silicon absorber, the second has a highly doped strained-silicon
absorber.Using a novel method of cross-correlating the outputs from two
parallel amplifiers, we measure noise-equivalent powers of $3.0 \times
10^{-16}$ and $6.6 \times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ for the control and
strained device, respectively, when observing radiation from a 77-K source. In
the case of the strained device, the noise-equivalent power is limited by the
photon noise.

multi-dimensional parameter space. We use K-means -a simple yet powerful
unsupervised clustering algorithm which picks out structure in unlabeled data-
to study a sample of quasar UV spectra from the Quasar Catalog of the 10th Data
Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of Paris et al. (2014). Detecting
patterns in large datasets helps us gain insights into the physical conditions
and processes giving rise to the observed properties of quasars. We use K-means
to find clusters in the parameter space of the equivalent width (EW), the blue-
and red-half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the Mg II 2800 A line, the C IV
1549 A line, and the C III] 1908 A blend in samples of Broad Absorption-Line
(BAL) and non-BAL quasars at redshift 1.6-2.1. Using this method, we
successfully recover correlations well-known in the UV regime such as the
anti-correlation between the EW and blueshift of the C IV emission line and the
shape of the ionizing Spectra Energy distribution (SED) probed by the strength
of He II and the Si III]/C III] ratio. We find this to be particularly evident
when the properties of C III] are used to find the clusters, while those of Mg
II proved to be less strongly correlated with the properties of the other lines
in the spectra such as the width of C IV or the Si III]/C III] ratio. We
conclude that unsupervised clustering methods (such as K-means) are powerful
methods for finding &quot;natural&quot; binning boundaries in multidimensional datasets
and discuss caveats and future work.

widely used as compact descriptions of rules in diverse fields of contemporary
science. Detailed numerical analysis shows that (i) logic complexity is
effective in discriminating between classes of functions commonly employed in
modelling contexts; (ii) it extends the notion of canalisation, used in the
study of genetic regulation, to a more general and detailed measure; (iii) it
is tightly linked to the resilience of a function's output to noise affecting
its inputs. We demonstrate its utility by measuring it in empirical data on
gene regulation, digital circuitry, and propositional calculus. Logic
complexity is exceptionally low in these systems. The asymmetry between &quot;on&quot;
and &quot;off&quot; states in the data correlates with the complexity in a non-null way;
a model of random Boolean networks clarifies this trend and indicates a common
hierarchical architecture in the three systems.

constant curvature. Using the concept of locked inertia tensor, we compute the
moment of inertia for systems moving on spheres and hyperbolic spheres and show
that we can recover the classical definition in the Euclidean case. After
proving some criteria for the existence of relative equilibria, we find a
natural way to define the concept of central configuration in curved spaces
using the moment of inertia, and show that our definition is formally similar
to the one that governs the classical problem. The existence criteria we
develop for central configurations help us provide several examples and prove
that, for any given point masses on spheres and hyperbolic spheres, central
configurations always exist. We end our paper with results concerning the
number of central configurations that lie on the same geodesic, thus extending
the celebrated theorem of Moulton to hyperbolic spheres and pointing out that
it has no straightforward generalization to spheres, where the count gets
complicated even in the case $N=2$.

  an in vitro study</title><categories>physics.flu-dyn</categories><comments>33 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Stent implantation in coronary bifurcations presents unique challenges and
currently there is no universally accepted stent deployment approach. Despite
clinical and computational studies, to date, the effect of each stent
implantation method on the coronary artery hemodynamics is not well understood.
In this study the hemodynamics of stented coronary bifurcations under pulsatile
flow conditions were investigated experimentally. Three implantation methods,
provisional side branch (PSB), culotte (CUL), and crush (CRU), were
investigated using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure
the velocity fields. Subsequently, hemodynamic parameters including wall shear
stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT)
were calculated and the pressure field through the vessel was non-invasively
quantified. The effects of each stented case were evaluated and compared
against an un-stented case. CRU provided the lowest compliance mismatch, but
demonstrated detrimental stent interactions. PSB, the clinically preferred
method, and CUL maintained many normal flow conditions. However, PSB provided
about a 300% increase in both OSI and RRT. CUL yielded a 10% and 85% increase
in OSI and RRT, respectively. The results of this study support the concept
that different bifurcation stenting techniques result in hemodynamic
environments that deviate from that of un-stented bifurcations, to varying
degrees.

  a Blended Introductory Mechanics Course</title><categories>physics.ed-ph</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The advent of MOOCs has stimulated interest in using online videos to deliver
content in university courses. We examined student engagement with 78 online
videos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended
introductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We found
that students were more engaged with videos that supported laboratory
activities than with videos that presented lecture content. In particular, the
percentage of students accessing laboratory videos was consistently greater
than 80 percent throughout the semester while the percentage of students
accessing lecture videos dropped to less than 40 percent by the end of the
term. Moreover, students were more likely to access the entirety of a
laboratory video than a lecture video. Our results suggest that students may
access videos based on perceived value: students appear to consider the
laboratory videos as essential for successfully completing the laboratories
while students appear to consider the lecture videos as something more akin to
supplementary material. We found there was little correlation between student
engagement with the videos and the performance in the course. In addition, an
examination of the in-video content suggests that students focus more on
concrete information that is explicitly required for assignment completion
(e.g., actions required to complete laboratory work, or formulas/mathematical
expressions needed to solve particular problems) and less on content that is
considered more conceptual in nature. The results of the study suggest ways in
which instructors may revise courses to better support student learning.

sizes and size distributions, including mono-sized, uniform and Gaussian
distribution, are investigated by using two different history dependent contact
models with Discrete Element Method (DEM). The simulation is carried out in the
framework of LIGGGHTS which is a DEM simulation package extended based on
branch of granular package of widely used open-source code LAMMPS. Contact
force caused by translation and rotation, frictional and damping forces due to
collision with other particles or container boundaries, cohesive force, van der
Waals force, and gravity are considered. The radial distribution functions
(RDFs), force distributions, porosities, and coordination numbers under
cohesive and non-cohesive conditions are reported. The results indicate that
particle size and size distributions have great influences on the packing
density for particle packing under cohesive effect: particles with Gaussian
distribution have the lowest packing density, followed by the particles with
uniform distribution; the particles with mono-sized distribution have the
highest packing density. It is also found that cohesive effect to the system
does not significantly affect the coordination number that mainly depends on
the particle size and size distribution. Although the magnitude of net force
distribution is different, the results for porosity, coordination number and

  II. Application to periodic lattices of finite length</title><categories>physics.class-ph</categories><proxy>ccsd</proxy><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The paper deals with the generic problem of two waveguides coupled by
perforations, which can be perforated tube mufflers without or with partitions,
possibly with absorbing materials. Other examples are ducts with branched
resonators of honeycomb cavities , which can be coupled or not, and splitter
silencers. Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is considered in each guide.
The propagation in the two waveguides can be very different, thanks e.g. to the
presence of constrictions. The model is a discrete, periodic one, based upon
4th-order impedance matrices and their diagonalization. All the calculation is
analytical, thanks to the partition of the matrices in 2nd-order matrices, and
allows the treatment of a very wide types of problems. Several aspects are
investigated: the local or non-local character of the reaction of one guide to
the other; the definition of a coupling coefficient; the effect of finite size
when a lattice with n cells in inserted into an infinite guide; the
relationship between the Insertion Loss and the dispersion. The assumptions are
as follows: linear acoustics, no mean flow, rigid wall. However the effect of
the series impedance of the perforations, which is generally ignored, is taken
into account, and is dis- cussed. When there are no losses, it is shown that,
for symmetry reasons, the cutoff frequencies depend on either the series
impedance or the shunt admittance , and are the eigenfrequencies of the cells
of the lattice, with zero-pressure or zero-velocity at the ends of the cells.

  Interstellar Infrared Spectrum Source Considering Astronomical Chemical
  Evolution Step To Biological Organic Purine And Adenine</title><categories>physics.chem-ph astro-ph.GA</categories><comments>17pages, 16Figures, 6 Tables</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In order to find out capable chemical evolution step from astronomically
created organic in interstellar space to biological organic on the earth,
infrared spectrum of nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon coupled
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was analyzed by the density functional theory.
Ionization was modeled from neutral to tri-cation. Among one nitrogen and two
nitrogen substituted NPAH, we could find good examples showing similar IR
behavior with astronomically well observed one as like C8H6N1, C7H5N2, and
C7H5N2. We can imagine that such ionized NPAH may be created in interstellar
space by attacks of high energy nitrogen and photon. Whereas, in case of three
and four nitrogen substituted cases as like C6H4N3 and C5H3N4, there were no
candidate showing similar behavior with observed one. Also, IR of typical
biological organic with four and five nitrogen substituted one as like purine
and adenine resulted no good similarity with observed one. By such theoretical
comparison, one capable story of chemical evolution of PAH in interstellar
space was that one and two nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon
molecules may have a potential to be created in interstellar space, whereas
more than three nitrogen substituted molecules including biological organic
purine and adenine may not be synthesized in space, possibly on the earth.

with possible applications ranging from molecular gas adsorption to particle
size selective permeability or solubility. Here, we use inverse methods of
statistical mechanics to design an isotropic pair interaction that, in the
absence of an external field, assembles particles into an inhomogeneous {\em
fluid} matrix surrounding pores of prescribed size ordered in a lattice
morphology. The pore size can be tuned via modification of temperature or
particle concentration. Moreover, modulating density reveals a rich series of
microphase-separated morphologies including pore- or particle-based lattices,
pore- or particle-based columns, and bicontinuous or lamellar structures.
Sensitivity of pore assembly to the form of the designed interaction potential
is explored.

  polarization</title><categories>cond-mat.mes-hall</categories><comments>4 pages, 1 figure</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In semiconductor nanostructures nonradiative Auger recombination is enhanced
by the presence of boundaries which relax the momentum conservation and thereby
removes the threshold reduction for these processes. We propose a method to
strongly reduce the Auger recombination rate by injecting spin-polarized
carriers. Our method is illustrated on the example of a quantum well in which
the spin-orbit coupling of conduction band is negligible as compared to valence
band and thus holes can be considered as spin-unpolarized. The suppression
factor of the Auger recombination is determined by the two-dimensional
character of the system, given by the ratio of the Fermi energy of electrons
and the separation of the electron levels quantized in the growth direction.
Our predictions can be tested experimentally and we discuss their implications
for semiconductor lasers relying on injection of spin-polarized electrons.

based on a radio-frequency optically pumped atomic magnetometer operating in
magnetic induction tomography modality. Imaging of conductive objects is
performed at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and without
background subtraction. Conductivity maps of target objects exhibit not only
excellent performance in terms of shape reconstruction but also demonstrate
detection of sub-millimetric cracks and penetration of conductive barriers. The
results presented here demonstrate the potential of a future generation of
imaging instruments, which combine magnetic induction tomography and the
unmatched performance of atomic magnetometers.

differential rotation and flux emergence has on a star's non-potential coronal
magnetic field. In particular we consider the effects on the star's surface
magnetic flux, open magnetic flux, mean azimuthal field strength, coronal free
magnetic energy, coronal heating and flux rope eruptions. To do this, we apply
a magnetic flux transport model to describe the photospheric evolution, and
couple this to the non-potential coronal evolution using a magnetofrictional
technique. A flux emergence model is applied to add new magnetic flux onto the
photosphere and into the corona. The parameters of this flux emergence model
are derived from the solar flux emergence profile, however the rate of
emergence can be increased to represent higher flux emergence rates than the
Sun's. Overall we find that flux emergence has a greater effect on the
non-potential coronal properties compared to differential rotation, with all
the aforementioned properties increasing with increasing flux emergence rate.
Although differential rotation has a lesser effect on the overall coronal
properties compared to flux emergence, varying differential rotation does alter
the coronal structure. As the differential rotation rate increases, the corona
becomes more open, and more non-potential.
