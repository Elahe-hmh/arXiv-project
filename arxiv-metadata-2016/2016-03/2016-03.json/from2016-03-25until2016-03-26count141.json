Usually, this superstructure is suppressed by the substitution of lead,\nbut there have been reports of a phase separation in so called {\\alpha} and\n{\\beta} phases. This paper shows in high detail time how and why the phase\nseparation develops and what happens to the quasi-1$\\times$5 superstructure\nupon lead substitution. For this purpose, the lanthanum- and lead-substituted\nsingle-layered superconductor Bi$_{2+z}$Sr$_{2-z}$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ has been\ninvestigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron\ndiffraction. The La content was kept constant at slightly under-doped\nconcentration while the Pb content was changed systematically.

Nevertheless sessile drops from\ndifferent but completely miscible liquids often do not fuse instantaneously\nupon contact. Rather, intermediate non-coalescence is observed. Two separate\ndrop bodies, connected by a thin liquid neck move over the substrate. Supported\nby new experimental data a thin film hydrodynamic analysis of this state is\npresented. Presumably advective and diffusive volume fluxes in the neck region\nestablish a localized and temporarily stable surface tension gradient. This\ninduces a local surface (Marangoni) flow that stabilizes a traveling wave i.e.,\nthe observed moving twin drop configuration. The theoretical predictions are in\nexcellent agreement with the experimental findings.\n", "  Competition between a complex system's constituents and a corresponding\nreward mechanism based on it have profound influence on the functioning,\nstability, and evolution of the system. But determining the dominance hierarchy\nor ranking among the constituent parts from the strongest to the weakest --\nessential in determining reward or penalty -- is almost always an ambiguous\ntask due to the incomplete nature of competition networks. Here we introduce\n``Natural Ranking,\" a desirably unambiguous ranking method applicable to a\ncomplete (full) competition network, and formulate an analytical model based on\nthe Bayesian formula inferring the expected mean and error of the natural\nranking of nodes from an incomplete network. We investigate its potential and\nuses in solving issues in ranking by applying to a real-world competition\nnetwork of economic and social importance.\n", "  In this work we investigate Ricci flows of almost Kaehler structures on Lie\nalgebroids when the fundamental geometric objects are completely determined by\n(semi) Riemannian metrics, or effective) regular generating Lagrange/ Finsler,\nfunctions. There are constructed canonical almost symplectic connections for\nwhich the geometric flows can be represented as gradient ones and characterized\nby nonholonomic deformations of Grigory Perelman's functionals. The first goal\nof this paper is to define such thermodynamical type values and derive almost\nK\\\"ahler - Ricci geometric evolution equations. The second goal is to study how\nfixed Lie algebroid, i.e. Ricci soliton, configurations can be constructed for\nRiemannian manifolds and/or (co) tangent bundles endowed with nonholonomic\ndistributions modelling (generalized) Einstein or Finsler - Cartan spaces.\nFinally, there are provided some examples of generic off-diagonal solutions for\nLie algebroid type Ricci solitons and (effective) Einstein and Lagrange-Finsler\nalgebroids.\n", "  Unexpectedly, under certain conditions, sessile drops from different but\ncompletely miscible liquids do not always coalesce instantaneously upon\ncontact: the drop bodies remain separated in a temporary state of\nnoncoalescence, connected through a thin liquid bridge. Here we investigate the\ntransition between the states of instantaneous coalescence and temporary\nnoncoalescence. Experiments reveal that it is barely influenced by viscosities\nand absolute surface tensions. The main system control parameters for the\ntransition are the arithmetic means of the three-phase angles,\n$\\overline{\\Theta}_a$ and the surface tension differences $\\Delta\\gamma$\nbetween both liquids. These relevant parameters can be combined into a single\nsystem parameter, a speciffic Marangoni number $\\widetilde{M} = 3\\Delta\\gamma /\n(2\\overline{\\gamma}\\overline{\\Theta}_a^2)$. This $\\widetilde{M}$ universally\ncharacterizes the coalescence respectively transition behavior as a function of\nboth, the physicochemical liquid properties and the shape of the liquid body in\nthe contact region. The transition occurs at a certain threshold value\n$\\widetilde{M}_t$ and is sharp within the experimental resolution. The\nexperimentally observed threshold value of $\\widetilde{M}_t \\approx 2$ agrees\nquantitatively with values obtained by simulations assuming authentic real\nspace data. The simulations indicate that the absolute value of\n$\\widetilde{M}_t$ very weakly depends on the molecular diffusivity.\n", "  Electronic transport through chaotic quantum dots exhibits universal\nbehaviour which can be understood through the semiclassical approximation.\nWithin the approximation, transport moments reduce to codifying classical\ncorrelations between scattering trajectories. These can be represented as\nribbon graphs and we develop an algorithmic combinatorial method to generate\nall such graphs with a given genus. This provides an expansion of the linear\ntransport moments for systems both with and without time reversal symmetry. The\ncomputational implementation is then able to progress several orders higher\nthan previous semiclassical formulae as well as those derived from an\nasymptotic expansion of random matrix results. The patterns observed also\nsuggest a general form for the higher orders.\n", "  We explore the stability of far-from-equilibrium metastable states of a\nthree-dimensional Coulomb glass at zero temperature by studying charge\navalanches triggered by a slowly varying external electric field. Surprisingly,\nwe identify a sharply defined dynamical (\"depinning\") phase transition from\nstationary to nonstationary charge displacement at a critical value of the\nexternal electric field. Using particle-conserving dynamics, scale-free\nsystem-spanning avalanches are observed only at the critical field. We show\nthat the qualitative features of this depinning transition are completely\ndifferent for an equivalent short-range model, highlighting the key importance\nof long-range interactions for nonequilibrium dynamics of Coulomb glasses.\n", "  The gamma-ray burst (GRB) rate is essential for revealing the connection\nbetween GRBs, supernovae and stellar evolution. Additionally, the GRB rate at\nhigh redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early\nuniverse. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to\ndetermine the intrinsic GRB rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of Swift.\nCurrent studies of the GRB rate usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm\nby a single detection threshold. However, unlike the previously flown GRB\ninstruments, Swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and\nadditional image threshold for localization. To investigate possible systematic\nbiases and explore the intrinsic GRB properties, we develop a program that is\ncapable of simulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image\nthreshold. Our simulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of\nSwift increases the detection rate of dim bursts. As a result, our simulations\nsuggest bursts need to be dimmer than previously expected to avoid\nover-producing the number of detections and to match with Swift observations.\nMoreover, our results indicate that these dim bursts are more likely to be high\nredshift events than low-luminosity GRBs. This would imply an even higher\ncosmic GRB rate at large redshifts than previous expectations based on\nstar-formation rate measurements, unless other factors, such as the luminosity\nevolution, are taken into account. The GRB rate from our best result gives a\ntotal number of 4571^{+829}_{-1584} GRBs per year that are beamed toward us in\nthe whole universe.\n  SPECIAL NOTE (2015.05.16): This new version incorporates an erratum. All the\nGRB rate normalizations ($R_{\\rm GRB}(z=0)$) should be a factor of 2 smaller\nthan previously reported. Please refer to the Appendix for more details. We\nsincerely apologize for the mistake.\n", "  Results are presented on a search for neutrino emission from a sample of six\nmicroquasars, based on the data collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope\nbetween 2007 and 2010. By means of appropriate time cuts, the neutrino search\nhas been restricted to the periods when the acceleration of relativistic jets\nwas taking place at the microquasars under study. The time cuts have been\nchosen using the information from the X-ray telescopes RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT,\nand, in one case, the gamma-ray telescope Fermi/LAT. Since none of the searches\nhas produced a statistically significant signal, upper limits on the neutrino\nfluences are derived and compared to the predictions from theoretical models.\n", "  The production of Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) mesons decaying\ninto the dimuon final state is studied with the LHCb detector using a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.3 pb^{-1} collected in\nproton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV. The\ndifferential production cross-sections times dimuon branching fractions are\nmeasured as functions of the Upsilon transverse momentum and rapidity, over the\nranges p_T<15 GeV/c and 2.0<y<4.5. The total cross-sections in this kinematic\nregion, assuming unpolarised production, are measured to be sigma(pp ->\nUpsilon(1S) X) x B(Upsilon(1S) -> mu+mu-) = 1.111 +/- 0.043 +/- 0.044 nb,\nsigma(pp -> Upsilon(2S) X) x B(Upsilon(2S) -> mu+mu-) = 0.264 +/- 0.023 +/-\n0.011 nb, sigma(pp -> Upsilon(3S) X) x B(Upsilon(3S) -> mu+mu-) = 0.159 +/-\n0.020 +/- 0.007 nb, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second\nsystematic.\n", "  Measurements of $b$-hadron lifetimes are reported using $pp$ collision data,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb$^{-1}$, collected by the\nLHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $7$Tev.

These represent the most precise lifetime measurements in these\ndecay modes. In addition, ratios of these lifetimes, and the ratio of the\ndecay-width difference, $\\Delta\\Gamma_d$, to the average width, $\\Gamma_d$, in\nthe $B^0$ system, $\\Delta \\Gamma_d/\\Gamma_d = -0.044 \\pm 0.025 \\pm 0.011$, are\nreported. All quantities are found to be consistent with Standard Model\nexpectations.\n", "  A facility that can deliver beams of electron and muon neutrinos from the\ndecay of a stored muon beam has the potential to unambiguously resolve the\nissue of the evidence for light sterile neutrinos that arises in short-baseline\nneutrino oscillation experiments and from estimates of the effective number of\nneutrino flavors from fits to cosmological data. In this paper, we show that\nthe nuSTORM facility, with stored muons of 3.8 GeV/c $\\pm$ 10%, will be able to\ncarry out a conclusive muon neutrino appearance search for sterile neutrinos\nand test the LSND and MiniBooNE experimental signals with 10$\\sigma$\nsensitivity, even assuming conservative estimates for the systematic\nuncertainties. This experiment would add greatly to our knowledge of the\ncontribution of light sterile neutrinos to the number of effective neutrino\nflavors from the abundance of primordial helium production and from constraints\non neutrino energy density from the cosmic microwave background. The appearance\nsearch is complemented by a simultaneous muon neutrino disappearance analysis\nthat will facilitate tests of various sterile neutrino models.\n", "  The LHCb measurement of the lifetime ratio of the $\\Lambda^0_b$ to the\n$\\overline{B}^0$ meson is updated using data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected using 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy\n$pp$ collisions at the LHC. The decay modes used are $\\overline{B}^0\\to J/\\psi\np K^-$ and $\\overline{B}^0\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+ K^-$, where the $\\pi^+K^-$ mass is\nconsistent with that of the $\\overline{K}^{*0}(892)$ meson. The lifetime ratio\nis determined with unprecedented precision to be $0.974\\pm0.006\\pm0.004$, where\nthe first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This result is\nin agreement with original theoretical predictions based on the heavy quark\nexpansion. Using the current world average of the $\\overline{B}^0$ lifetime,\nthe $\\Lambda^0_b$ lifetime is found to be $1.479 \\pm 0.009 \\pm 0.010$ ps.\n", "  The resonant structure of the decay $\\overline{B}_s^0\\to J/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ is\nstudied using data corresponding to 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from\n$pp$ collisions by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ states are required to describe the decay:\n$f_0(980),f_0(1500),f_0(1790),f_2(1270)$, and $f_2^{\\prime}(1525)$. An\nalternative model including these states and a non-resonant $J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$\ncomponent also provides a good description of the data. Based on the different\ntransversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final\nstate is found to be compatible with being entirely $CP$-odd. The $CP$-even\npart is found to be $<2.3$% at 95% confidence level. The $f_0(500)$ state is\nnot observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing\nangle with the $f_0(980)$ of $<7.7^{\\circ}$ at 90% confidence level, consistent\nwith a tetraquark interpretation of the $f_0(980)$ substructure.\n", "  We calculate the spin-polarized electronic transport through a molecular\nbilayer spin valve from first principles, and establish the link between the\nmagnetoresistance and the spin-dependent inter- actions at the metal-molecule\ninterfaces. The magnetoresistance of a Fe|bilayer-C70|Fe spin valve attains a\nhigh value of 70% in the linear response regime, but it drops sharply as a\nfunction of the applied bias. The current polarization has a value of 80% in\nlinear response, and also decreases as a function of bias. Both these trends\ncan be modelled in terms of prominent spin-dependent Fe|C70 interface states\nclose to the Fermi level, unfolding the potential of spinterface science to\ncontrol and optimize spin currents.\n", "  These expository notes propose to follow, across fields, some aspects of the\nconcept of entropy. Starting from the work of Boltzmann in the kinetic theory\nof gases, various universes are visited, including Markov processes and their\nHelmholtz free energy, the Shannon monotonicity problem in the central limit\ntheorem, the Voiculescu free probability theory and the free central limit\ntheorem, random walks on regular trees, the circular law for the complex\nGinibre ensemble of random matrices, and finally the asymptotic analysis of\nmean-field particle systems in arbitrary dimension, confined by an external\nfield and experiencing singular pair repulsion. The text is written in an\ninformal style driven by energy and entropy. It aims to be recreative and to\nprovide to the curious readers entry points in the literature, and connections\nacross boundaries.\n", "  Liquid drops on soft solids generate strong deformations below the contact\nline, resulting from a balance of capillary and elastic forces. The movement of\nthese drops may cause strong, potentially singular dissipation in the soft\nsolid. Here we show that a drop on a soft substrate moves by surfing a ridge:\nthe initially flat solid surface is deformed into a sharp ridge whose\norientation angle depends on the contact line velocity. We measure this angle\nfor water on a silicone gel and develop a theory based on the substrate\nrheology. We quantitatively recover the dynamic contact angle and provide a\nmechanism for stick-slip motion when a drop is forced strongly: the contact\nline depins and slides down the wetting ridge, forming a new one after a\ntransient. We anticipate that our theory will have implications in problems\nsuch as self-organization of cell tissues or the design of capillarity-based\nmicrorheometers.\n", "  We initiate the study of passive environment-assisted communication via a\nquantum channel, modeled as a unitary interaction between the information\ncarrying system and an environment. In this model, the environment is\ncontrolled by a benevolent helper who can set its initial state such as to\nassist sender and receiver of the communication link. (The case of a malicious\nenvironment, also known as jammer, or arbitrarily varying channel, is\nessentially well-understood and comprehensively reviewed.) Here, after setting\nout precise definitions, focussing on the problem of quantum communication, we\nshow that entanglement plays a crucial role in this problem: indeed, the\nassisted capacity where the helper is restricted to product states between\nchannel uses is different from the one with unrestricted helper. Furthermore,\nprior shared entanglement between the helper and the receiver makes a\ndifference, too.\n", "  One of the stiffest equations of state for matter in a compact star is\nconstant energy density and this generates the interior Schwarzschild radius to\nmass relation and the Misner maximum mass for relativistic compact stars. If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse.\n", "  The emergence of a critical dimension is one of the most striking features of\nstring theory. One way to obtain it is by demanding closure of the Lorentz\nalgebra in the light-cone gauge quantisation, as discovered for bosonic strings\nmore than fourty years ago. We give a detailed derivation of this classical\nresult based on the operator product expansion on the Lorentzian world-sheet.\n", "  We propose and study the use of photon-mediated interactions for the\ngeneration of long-range steady-state entanglement between N atoms. Through the\njudicious use of coherent drives and the placement of the atoms in a network of\nCavity QED systems, a balance between their unitary and dissipative dynamics\ncan be precisely engineered to stabilize a long-range correlated state of\nqubits in the steady state. We discuss the general theory behind such a scheme,\nand present an example of how it can be used to drive a register of N atoms to\na generalized W state and how the entanglement can be sustained indefinitely.\nThe achievable steady-state fidelities for entanglement and its scaling with\nthe number of qubits are discussed for presently existing superconducting\nquantum circuits. While the protocol is primarily discussed for a\nsuperconducting circuit architecture, it is ideally realized in any Cavity QED\nplatform that permits controllable delivery of coherent electromagnetic\nradiation to specified locations.\n", "  The theoretical construction of a traversable wormhole proposed by Morris and\nThorne maintains complete control over the geometry by assigning both the shape\nand redshift functions, thereby leaving open the determination of the\nstress-energy tensor. This paper examines the effect of introducing the linear\nbarotropic equation of state $p_r=\\omega\\rho$ on the theoretical construction.\nIf either the energy density or the closely related shape function is known,\nthen the Einstein field equations do not ordinarily yield a finite redshift\nfunction. If, however, the wormhole admits a one-parameter group of conformal\nmotions, then both the redshift and shape functions exist provided that $\\omega\n<-1$. In a cosmological setting, the equation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$, $\\omega\n<-1$, is associated with phantom dark energy, which is known to support\ntraversable wormholes.\n", "  In this paper, a statistical model for the coupling of electromagnetic\nradiation into enclosures through apertures is presented. The model gives a\nunified picture bridging deterministic theories of aperture radiation, and\nstatistical models necessary for capturing the properties of irregular shaped\nenclosures. A Monte Carlo technique based on random matrix theory is used to\npredict and study the power transmitted through the aperture into the\nenclosure. Universal behavior of the net power entering the aperture is found.\nResults are of interest for predicting the coupling of external radiation\nthrough openings in irregular enclosures and reverberation chambers.\n", "  The recent measurements of the masses of the pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR\nJ0348-0432 provide independent proof for the existence of neutron stars with\nmasses in range of 2 $M_\\odot$. This fact has significant implications for the\nphysics of high density matter and it challenges the hypothesis that the cores\nof NS can be composed of deconfined quark matter. In this contribution we study\na description of quark matter based on the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio effective model\nand construct the equation of state for matter in beta equilibrium. This\nequation of state together with the hadronic Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\nequation of state is used here to describe neutron star and hybrid star\nconfigurations. We show that compact stars masses of 2 $M_\\odot$ are compatible\nwith the possible existence of deconfined quark matter in their core.\n", "  We study the nodal count of the so-called bi-dendral graphs and show that it\nexhibits an anomaly: the nodal surplus is never equal to 0 or $\\beta$, the\nfirst Betti number of the graph. According to the nodal-magnetic theorem, this\nmeans that bands of the magnetic spectrum (dispersion relation) of such graphs\ndo not have maxima or minima at the \"usual\" symmetry points of the fundamental\ndomain of the reciprocal space of magnetic parameters.\n  In search of the missing extrema we prove a necessary condition for a smooth\ncritical point to happen inside the reciprocal fundamental domain. Using this\ncondition, we identify the extrema as the singularities in the dispersion\nrelation of the maximal abelian cover of the graph (the honeycomb graph being\nan important example).\n  In particular, our results show that the anomalous nodal count is an\nindication of the presence of the conical points in the dispersion relation of\nthe maximal universal cover. Also, we discover that the conical points are\npresent in the dispersion relation of graphs with much less symmetry than was\nrequired in previous investigations.\n", "  We performed time lag analysis on the X-ray light curves of Centaurus A (Cen\nA) obtained by the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) aboard the Monitor of All-sky X-ray\nImage ({\\it MAXI}) in three energy bands (2--4 keV, 4--10 keV, and 10--20 keV).\nWe discovered a soft X-ray lag relative to higher energies (soft lag) on a\ntimescale of days in a flaring episode by employing the discrete correlation\nfunction (DCF) and the z-transformed discrete correlation function (ZDCF)\nmethod. In the episode, a peak and a centroid in the DCF and the ZDCF was\nobserved at a soft lag of $\\sim 5$ days in 2--4 keV versus 4--10 keV and in\n4--10 keV versus 10--20 keV, and $\\sim 10$ days in 2--4 keV versus 10--20 keV.\nWe found it difficult to explain the observed X-ray variation by a single\nenergy injection with the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, in\nwhich the soft lags in these three energy bands reflect the different cooling\ntimes of the relativistic electrons, by assuming the magnetic field and minimum\nLorentz factor estimated from a broad-band SED. Alternatively, if the\nphenomenon is interpreted as cooling of Comptonizing electrons in a corona\ncovering the accretion disk, the temperature of the corona producing the\nvariable X-rays should be $\\sim$10 keV for reconciliation with the soft lag in\nthe energy range of 2--20 keV.\n", "  Magic state distillation is a crucial component in the leading approaches to\nimplementing universal fault tolerant quantum computation, with existing\nprotocols for both qubit and higher dimensional systems. Early work focused on\ndetermining the region of distillable states for qubit protocols, yet\ncomparatively little is known about which states can be distilled and with what\ndistillable region for d>2. Here we focus on d=3 and present new four-qutrit\ndistillation schemes that improve upon the known distillable region, and\nachieve distillation tight to the boundary of undistillable states for some\nclasses of state. As a consequence of recent results, this implies that there\nis a family of quantum states that enable universality if and only if they\nexhibit contextuality with respect to stabilizer measurements. We also identify\na new routine whose fixed point is a magic state with maximal sum-negativity\ni.e., it is maximally non-stabilizer in a specific sense.\n", "  We examine the location of the eigenvalues of the generator $G$ of a\nsemi-group $V(t) = e^{tG},\\: t \\geq 0,$ related to the wave equation in an\nunbounded domain $\\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^d$ with dissipative boundary\ncondition $\\partial_{\\nu}u - \\gamma(x) \\partial_t u = 0$ on $\\Gamma = \\partial\n\\Omega.$ We study two cases: $(A): \\: 0 < \\gamma(x) < 1,\\: \\forall x \\in\n\\Gamma$ and $(B):\\: 1 < \\gamma(x), \\: \\forall x \\in \\Gamma.$ We prove that for\nevery $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1,$ the eigenvalues of $G$ in the case $(A)$ lie in the\nregion $\\Lambda_{\\epsilon} = \\{z \\in {\\mathbb C}:\\: |\\Re z | \\leq C_{\\epsilon}\n(|\\Im z|^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon} + 1), \\: \\Re z < 0\\},$ while in the case\n$(B)$ for every $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ and every $N \\in {\\mathbb N}$ the\neigenvalues lie in $\\Lambda_{\\epsilon} \\cup {\\mathcal R}_N,$ where ${\\mathcal\nR}_N = \\{z \\in {\\mathbb C}:\\: |\\Im z| \\leq C_N (|\\Re z| + 1)^{-N},\\: \\Re z <\n0\\}.$\n", "  During the Italian research assessment exercise, the national agency ANVUR\nperformed an experiment to assess agreement between grades attributed to\njournal articles by informed peer review (IR) and by bibliometrics. A sample of\narticles was evaluated by using both methods and agreement was analyzed by\nweighted Cohen's kappas. ANVUR presented results as indicating an overall\n'good' or 'more than adequate' agreement. This paper re-examines the experiment\nresults according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting\nkappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range\n0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor\nor, in a few cases, as, at most, fair. The only notable exception, confirmed\nalso by a statistical meta-analysis, was a moderate agreement for economics and\nstatistics (Area 13) and its sub-fields. We show that the experiment protocol\nadopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other\nresearch fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to\nbe considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the\nconclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that\nthe adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly\nintroduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results. The conclusion\nreached by ANVUR must be reversed: the available evidence does not justify at\nall the joint use of IR and bibliometrics within the same research assessment\nexercise.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to use large deviation theory in order to compute\nthe entropy of macrostates for the microcanonical measure of the shallow water\nsystem. The main prediction of this full statistical mechanics computation is\nthe energy partition between a large scale vortical flow and small scale\nfluctuations related to inertia-gravity waves. We introduce for that purpose a\ndiscretized model of the continuous shallow water system, and compute the\ncorresponding statistical equilibria. We argue that microcanonical equilibrium\nstates of the discretized model in the continuous limit are equilibrium states\nof the actual shallow water system. We show that the presence of small scale\nfluctuations selects a subclass of equilibria among the states that were\npreviously computed by phenomenological approaches that were neglecting such\nfluctuations. In the limit of weak height fluctuations, the equilibrium state\ncan be interpreted as two subsystems in thermal contact: one subsystem\ncorresponds to the large scale vortical flow, the other subsystem corresponds\nto small scale height and velocity fluctuations. It is shown that either a\nnon-zero circulation or rotation and bottom topography are required to sustain\na non-zero large scale flow at equilibrium. Explicit computation of the\nequilibria and their energy partition is presented in the quasi-geostrophic\nlimit for the energy-enstrophy ensemble. The possible role of small scale\ndissipation and shocks is discussed. A geophysical application to the Zapiola\nanticyclone is presented.\n", "  We have conducted extensive investigations on the magnetization and its\ndynamical relaxation on a Ba$_{0.66}$K$_{0.32}$BiO$_{3+\\delta}$ single crystal.\nIt is found that the magnetization relaxation rate is rather weak compared with\nthat in the cuprate superconductors, indicating a higher collective vortex\npinning potential (or activation energy), although the intrinsic pinning\npotential $U_\\mathrm{c}$ is weaker. Detailed analysis leads to the following\ndiscoveries: (1) A second-peak effect on the magnetization-hysteresis-loop was\nobserved in a very wide temperature region, ranging from 2K to 24K. Its general\nbehavior looks like that in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$; (2) Associated with the second\npeak effect, the magnetization relaxation rate is inversely related to the\ntransient superconducting current density $J_\\mathrm{s}$ revealing a quite\ngeneral and similar mechanism for the second peak effect in many high\ntemperature superconductors; (3) A detailed analysis based on the collective\ncreep model reveals a large glassy exponent $\\mu$ and a small intrinsic pinning\npotential $U_\\mathrm{c}$; (4) Investigation on the volume pinning force density\nshows that the data can be scaled to the formula $F_{p}\\propto b^p(1-b)^q$ with\n$p=2.79$ and $q=3.14$, here $b$ is the reduced magnetic field to the\nirreversible magnetic field. The maximum normalized pinning force density\nappears near $b\\approx0.47$. Finally, a vortex phase diagram is drawn for\nshowing the phase transitions or crossovers between different vortex phases.\n", "  This paper is about nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) of a class of\nstochastic models in which particles exchange energy with their \"local\nenvironments\" rather than directly with one another. The physical domain of the\nsystem can be a bounded region of $\\mathbb R^d$ for any $d \\ge 1$. We assume\nthat the temperature at the boundary of the domain is prescribed and is\nnonconstant, so that the system is forced out of equilibrium. Our main result\nis local thermal equilibrium in the infinite volume limit. In the Hamiltonian\ncontext, this would mean that at any location $x$ in the domain, local marginal\ndistributions of NESS tend to a probability with density $\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta\n(x) H}$, permitting one to define the local temperature at $x$ to be\n$\\beta(x)^{-1}$. We prove also that in the infinite volume limit, the mean\nenergy profile of NESS satisfies Laplace's equation for the prescribed boundary\ncondition. Our method of proof is duality: by reversing the sample paths of\nparticle movements, we convert the problem of studying local marginal energy\ndistributions at $x$ to that of joint hitting distributions of certain random\nwalks starting from $x$, and prove that the walks in question become\nincreasingly independent as system size tends to infinity.\n", "  We report experimental evidence of strong orientational coupling between the\ncrystal lattice and the vortex lattice in a weakly pinned Co-doped NbSe2 single\ncrystal through direct imaging using low temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy. At low fields, when the magnetic field is applied\nalong the six-fold symmetric c-axis of the NbSe2 crystal, the equilibrium\nconfiguration of the vortex lattice is preferentially aligned along the basis\nvectors of the crystal lattice. The orientational coupling between the vortex\nlattice and crystal lattice becomes more pronounced as the magnetic field is\nincreased. We show that this coupling enhances the stability of the\norientational order of the vortex lattice, which persists even in the\ndisordered state at high fields where dislocations and disclinations have\ndestroyed the topological order.\n", "  We show that intrinsic (not lensing-induced) correlations between galaxy\nshapes offer a new probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and inflationary physics\nwhich is complementary to galaxy number counts. Specifically, intrinsic\nalignment correlations are sensitive to an anisotropic squeezed limit\nbispectrum of the primordial perturbations. Such a feature arises in solid\ninflation, as well as more broadly in the presence of light higher spin fields\nduring inflation (as pointed out recently by Arkani-Hamed and Maldacena). We\npresent a derivation of the all-sky two-point correlations of intrinsic shapes\nand number counts in the presence of non-Gaussianity with general angular\ndependence, and show that a quadrupolar (spin-2) anisotropy leads to the analog\nin galaxy shapes of the well-known scale-dependent bias induced in number\ncounts by isotropic (spin-0) non-Gaussianity. Moreover, in presence of non-zero\nanisotropic non-Gaussianity, the quadrupole of galaxy shapes becomes sensitive\nto far superhorizon modes. These effects come about because long-wavelength\nmodes induce a local anisotropy in the initial power spectrum, with which\ngalaxies will correlate. We forecast that future imaging surveys could provide\nconstraints on the amplitude of anisotropic non-Gaussianity that are comparable\nto those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). These are complementary as\nthey probe different physical scales. The constraints, however, depend on the\nsensitivity of galaxy shapes to the initial conditions which we only roughly\nestimate from observed tidal alignments.\n", "  Three identical bosons or fermions are considered in the limit of zero-range\ninteractions and finite effective range. By using a two channel model, we show\nthat these systems are not integrable and that the wave function verifies\nspecific continuity conditions at the contact of three particles. This last\nfeature permits us to solve a contradiction brought by the contact model which\ncan lead to an opposite result concerning the integrability issue. For\nfermions, the vicinity of integrability is characterized by large deviations\nwith respect to the predictions of the Bethe ansatz.\n", "  We demonstrate a compact iodine-stabilized laser operating at 531 nm using a\ncoin-sized light source consisting of a 1062-nm distributed-feedback diode\nlaser and a frequency-doubling element. A hyperfine transition of molecular\niodine is observed using the light source with saturated absorption\nspectroscopy. The light source is frequency stabilized to the observed iodine\ntransition and achieves frequency stability at the 10$^{-12}$ level. The\nabsolute frequency of the compact laser stabilized to the $a_{1}$ hyperfine\ncomponent of the $R(36)32-0$ transition is determined as\n$564\\,074\\,632\\,419(8)$ kHz with a relative uncertainty of $1.4\\times10^{-11}$.\nThe iodine-stabilized laser can be used for various applications including\ninterferometric measurements.\n", "  Direct detection of and LHC search for the singlet fermion dark matter (SFDM)\nmodel with Higgs portal interaction are considered in a renormalizable model\nwhere the full Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry is imposed by introducing a\nsinglet scalar messenger. In this model, direct detection is described by an\neffective operator m_q \\bar{q} q \\bar{\\chi} \\chi as usual, but the full\namplitude for monojet + \\not E_T involves two intermediate scalar propagators,\nwhich cannot be seen within the effective field theory (EFT) or in the\nsimplified model without the full SM gauge symmetry. We derive the collider\nbounds from the ATLAS monojet + \\not E_T as well as the CMS t\\bar{t} + \\not E_T\ndata, finding out that the bounds and the interpretation of the results are\ncompletely different from those obtained within the EFT or simplified models.\nIt is pointed out that it is important to respect unitarity, renormalizability\nand local gauge invariance of the SM.\n", "  We establish an operational theory of coherence (or of superposition) in\nquantum systems, by focusing on the optimal rate of performance of certain\ntasks. Namely, we introduce the two basic concepts - \"coherence distillation\"\nand \"coherence cost\" in the processing quantum states under so-called\nincoherent operations [Baumgratz/Cramer/Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113:140401\n(2014)]. We then show that in the asymptotic limit of many copies of a state,\nboth are given by simple single-letter formulas: the distillable coherence is\ngiven by the relative entropy of coherence (in other words, we give the\nrelative entropy of coherence its operational interpretation), and the\ncoherence cost by the coherence of formation, which is an optimization over\nconvex decompositions of the state.\n  An immediate corollary is that there exists no bound coherent state in the\nsense that one would need to consume coherence to create the state but no\ncoherence could be distilled from it. Further we demonstrate that the coherence\ntheory is generically an irreversible theory by a simple criterion that\ncompletely characterizes all reversible states.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Klein-Gordon equation in a 3D charged rotating\nhairy black hole background to study behavior of a massive scalar field. In the\ngeneral case we find periodic-like behavior for the scalar field which may be\nvanishes at the black hole horizon or far from the black hole horizon. For the\nspecial cases of non-rotating or near horizon approximation we find radial\nsolution of Klein-Gordon equation in terms of hypergeometric and Kummer\nfunctions. Also for the case of uncharged black hole we find numerical solution\nof the Klein-Gordon equation as periodic function which may enhanced out of the\nblack hole or vanish at horizon. We find allowed boundary conditions which\nyield to the identical bosons described by scalar field.\n", "  Starting from a microscopic model, we investigate the optical spectra of\nmolecules in strongly-coupled organic microcavities examining how they might\nself-consistently adapt their coupling to light. We consider both rotational\nand vibrational degrees of freedom, focusing on features which can be seen in\nthe peak in the center of the spectrum at the bare excitonic frequency. In both\ncases we find that the matter-light coupling can lead to a self-consistent\nchange of the molecular states, with consequent temperature-dependent\nsignatures in the absorption spectrum. However, for typical parameters, these\neffects are much too weak to explain recent measurements. We show that another\nmechanism which naturally arises from our model of vibrationally dressed\npolaritons has the right magnitude and temperature dependence to be at the\norigin of the observed data.\n", "  The ATLAS collaboration has recently reported excesses about 2.5 sigma at\nmass around 2 TeV in the diboson channels, which can be identified with new\nvector bosons as a hint for the new physics. It is shown that spontaneously\nbroken conformal/scale symmetry prohibits new vector bosons decay to the Higgs,\nwhich is contrasted to the popular \"equivalence theorem\" valid only in a\nspecial limit not necessarily relevant to the 2 TeV mass. If the decay $V\\to\nWH/ZH$ is not observed in the ongoing Run II of the LHC, then the 125 GeV Higgs\ncan be a dilaton.\n", "  Entanglement witness is a Hermitian operator which is useful for detection\nthe genuine multi-partite entanglement of mixed states. Nonlinear entanglement\nwitnesses have the advantage of a wider detection range in the entangled\nregion. We construct genuine and optimal entanglement witnesses for four qubits\ndensity matrices in the mutually unbiased basis. First, we find the convex\nfeasible region with positive partial transpose states. Then, to reveal the\nentangled regions, we present some appropriate optimal linear entanglement\nwitnesses and we find the envelope of these family of linear witnesses as a\nnonlinear witness. Finally, we study thermal entanglement and show for some\nHamiltonians the witnesses have ability to detect the entanglement at all\ntemperatures.\n", "  We develop a hydrodynamic approach to non-equilibrium conformal field theory.\nWe study non-equilibrium steady states in the context of one-dimensional\nconformal field theory perturbed by the $T\\bar T$ irrelevant operator. By\ndirect quantum computation, we show, to first order in the coupling, that a\nrelativistic hydrodynamic emerges, which is a simple modification of\none-dimensional conformal fluids. We show that it describes the steady state\nand its approach, and we provide the main characteristics of the steady state,\nwhich lies between two shock waves. The velocities of these shocks are modified\nby the perturbation and equal the sound velocities of the asymptotic baths.\nPushing further this approach, we are led to conjecture that the approach to\nthe steady state is generically controlled by the power law $t^{-1/2}$, and\nthat the widths of the shocks increase with time according to $t^{1/3}$.\n", "  Superconducting circuits offer tremendous design flexibility in the quantum\nregime culminating most recently in the demonstration of few qubit systems\nsupposedly approaching the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information\nprocessing. Competition in the solid-state comes from semiconductor qubits,\nwhere nature has bestowed some very useful properties which can be utilized for\nspin qubit based quantum computing. Here we begin to explore how selective\ndesign principles deduced from spin-based systems could be used to advance\nsuperconducting qubit science. We take an initial step along this path\nproposing an encoded qubit approach realizable with state-of-the-art tunable\nJosephson junction qubits. Our results show that this design philosophy holds\npromise, enables microwave-free control, and offers a pathway to future qubit\ndesigns with new capabilities such as with higher fidelity or, perhaps,\noperation at higher temperature. The approach is also especially suited to\nqubits based on variable super-semi junctions.\n", "  In recent years there has been considerable interest in utilizing embedded\nfiber optic based sensors for fabricating smart materials. One of the primary\nmotivations is to provide real-time information on the structural integrity of\nthe material so as to enable proactive actions that prevent catastrophic\nfailure. In this preliminary study we have examined the impact of embedding on\nthe temperature-dependent response of fiber Bragg gratings.\n", "  The ordered double perovskites Sr2CrOsO6 and Ca2CrOsO6 have been synthesized\nand characterized with neutron powder diffraction, electrical transport\nmeasurements, and high field magnetization experiments. Sr2CrOsO6 and Ca2CrOsO6\ncrystallize with R-3 and P21/n space group symmetry, respectively. Both\nmaterials are found to be ferrimagnetic insulators with saturation\nmagnetizations near 0.2 {\\mu}B. Sr2CrOsO6 orders at 660 K, showing\nnon-monotonic magnetization temperature dependence, while Ca2CrOsO6 orders at\n490 K and does not show non-monotonic behavior. Evidence for a theoretically\npredicted canted magnetic structure in Sr2CrOsO6 is sought and not found.\n", "  We revisit the color-diffusion algorithm [P. C. Aeberhard et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 108, 095901 (2012)] in nonequilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics\n(NE-AIMD), and propose a simple efficient approach for the estimation of\nmonovacancy jump rates in crystalline solids at temperatures well below\nmelting. Color-diffusion applied to monovacancy migration entails that one\nlattice atom (colored-atom) is accelerated toward the neighboring defect-site\nby an external constant force F. Considering bcc molybdenum between 1000 and\n2800 K as a model system, NE-AIMD results show that the colored-atom jump rate\nk_{NE} increases exponentially with the force intensity F, up to F values far\nbeyond the linear-fitting regime employed previously. Using a simple model, we\nderive an analytical expression which reproduces the observed k_{NE}(F)\ndependence on F. Equilibrium rates extrapolated by NE-AIMD results are in\nexcellent agreement with those of unconstrained dynamics. The gain in\ncomputational efficiency achieved with our approach increases rapidly with\ndecreasing temperatures, and reaches a factor of four orders of magnitude at\nthe lowest temperature considered in the present study.\n", "  A second order self-adjoint operator $\\Delta=S\\partial^2+U$ is uniquely\ndefined by its principal symbol $S$ and potential $U$ if it acts on\nhalf-densities. We analyse the potential $U$ as a compensating field (gauge\nfield) in the sense that it compensates the action of coordinate\ntransformations on the second derivatives in the same way as an affine\nconnection compensates the action of coordinate transformations on first\nderivatives in the first order operator, a covariant derivative,\n$\\nabla=\\partial+\\Gamma$. Usually a potential $U$ is derived from other\ngeometrical constructions such as a volume form, an affine connection, or a\nRiemannian structure, etc. The story is different if $\\Delta$ is an odd\noperator on a supermanifold. In this case the second order potential becomes a\nprimary object. For example, in the case of an odd symplectic supermanifold,\nthe compensating field of the canonical odd Laplacian depends only on this\nsymplectic structure, and can be expressed by the formula obtained by K.Bering.\nWe also study modular classes of odd Poisson manifolds via $\\Delta$-operators,\nand consider an example of a non-trivial modular class which is related with\nthe Nijenhuis bracket.\n", "  We report on two-particle charge-dependent correlations in pp, p-Pb, and\nPb-Pb collisions as a function of the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle\ndifference, $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\eta$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\varphi$ respectively.\nThese correlations are studied using the balance function that probes the\ncharge creation time and the development of collectivity in the produced\nsystem. The dependence of the balance function on the event multiplicity as\nwell as on the trigger and associated particle transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}\n= 7$, 5.02, and 2.76 TeV, respectively, are presented. In the low transverse\nmomentum region, for $0.2 < p_{\\mathrm{T}} < 2.0$ GeV/$c$, the balance function\nbecomes narrower in both $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\eta$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\varphi$\ndirections in all three systems for events with higher multiplicity. The\nexperimental findings favor models that either incorporate some collective\nbehavior (e.g. AMPT) or different mechanisms that lead to effects that resemble\ncollective behavior (e.g. PYTHIA8 with color reconnection). For higher values\nof transverse momenta the balance function becomes even narrower but exhibits\nno multiplicity dependence, indicating that the observed narrowing with\nincreasing multiplicity at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is a feature of bulk particle\nproduction.\n", "  We study the dynamical chaos and integrable motion in the planar circular\nrestricted three-body problem and determine the fractal dimension of the spiral\nstrange repeller set of non-escaping orbits at different values of mass ratio\nof binary bodies and of Jacobi integral of motion. We find that the spiral\nfractal structure of the Poincar\\'e section leads to a spiral density\ndistribution of particles remaining in the system. We also show that the\ninitial exponential drop of survival probability with time is followed by the\nalgebraic decay related to the universal algebraic statistics of Poincar\\'e\nrecurrences in generic symplectic maps.\n", "  Ground state cooling of micromechanical oscillator is a paradigmatic goal for\nobserving quantum mechanical effects in cavity optomechanics. We study\ntheoretically the ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an\noptomechanical cavity in presence of a quantum well placed inside the cavity.\nDue to mode tailoring in presence of the quantum well, the cavity response gets\nmodified and leads to asymmetric heating and cooling processes. This\nfacilitates the cooling of the mechanical oscillator even in the\nunresolved-sideband regime, via inhibition of Stokes scattering.\n", "  The notion that any physical quantity is defined and measured relative to a\nreference frame is traditionally not explicitly reflected in the theoretical\ndescription of physical experiments where, instead, the relevant observables\nare typically represented as \"absolute\" quantities. However, the emergence of\nthe resource theory of quantum reference frames as a new branch of quantum\ninformation science in recent years has highlighted the need to identify the\nphysical conditions under which a quantum system can serve as a good reference.\nHere we investigate the conditions under which, in quantum theory, an account\nin terms of absolute quantities can provide a good approximation of relative\nquantities. We find that this requires the reference system to be large in a\nsuitable sense.\n", "  Current nonequilibrium Monte Carlo methods suffer from a dynamical sign\nproblem that makes simulating real-time dynamics for long times exponentially\nhard. We propose a new `Inchworm Algorithm', based on iteratively reusing\ninformation obtained in previous steps to extend the propagation to longer\ntimes. The algorithm largely overcomes the dynamical sign problem, changing the\nscaling from exponential to quadratic. We use the method to solve the Anderson\nimpurity model in the Kondo and mixed valence regimes, obtaining results both\nfor quenches and for spin dynamics in the presence of an oscillatory magnetic\nfield.\n", "  We first derive the primordial power spectra, spectral indices and runnings\nof both scalar and tensor perturbations of a flat inflationary universe to the\nsecond-order approximations of the slow-roll parameters, in the framework of\nloop quantum cosmology with the inverse-volume quantum corrections. This\nrepresents an extension of our previous work in which the parameter $\\sigma$\nwas assumed to be an integer, where $\\sigma$ characterizes the quantum\ncorrections and in general can take any of values from the range $\\sigma \\in\n(0, 6]$. Restricting to the first-order approximations of the slow-roll\nparameters, we find corrections to the results obtained previously in the\nliterature, and point out the causes for such errors. To our best knowledge,\nthese represent the most accurate calculations of scalar and tensor\nperturbations given so far in the literature. Then, fitting the perturbations\nto the recently released data by Planck (2015), we obtain the most severe\nconstraints for various values of $\\sigma$. Using these constraints as our\nreferring point, we discuss whether these quantum gravitational corrections can\nlead to measurable signatures in the future cosmological observations. We show\nthat, depending on the value of $\\sigma$, the scale-dependent contributions to\nthe relativistic inflationary spectra due to the inverse-volume corrections\ncould be well within the range of the detectability of the forthcoming\ngenerations of experiments, such as the Stage IV experiments.\n", "  Superconducting spin valves based on the superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F)\nproximity effect are considered to be a key element in the emerging field of\nsuperconducting spintronics. Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of the\nmorphology of the superconducting layer in the operation of a multilayer\nS/F1/F2 spin valve. We study two types of superconducting spin valve\nheterostructures, with rough and with smooth superconducting layers, using\ntransmission electron microscopy in combination with transport and magnetic\ncharacterization. We find that the quality of the S/F interface is not critical\nfor the S/F proximity effect, as regards the suppression of the critical\ntemperature of the S layer. However, it appears to be of paramount importance\nin the performance of the S/F1/F2 spin valve. As the morphology of the S layer\nchanges from the form of overlapping islands to a smooth case, the magnitude of\nthe conventional superconducting spin valve effect significantly increases. We\nattribute this dramatic effect to a homogenization of the Green function of the\nsuperconducting condensate over the S/F interface in the S/F1/F2 valve with a\nsmooth surface of the S layer.\n", "  Random access codes are important for a wide range of applications in quantum\ninformation. However, their implementation with quantum theory can be made in\ntwo very different ways: (i) by distributing data with strong spatial\ncorrelations violating a Bell inequality, or (ii) using quantum communication\nchannels to create stronger-than-classical sequential correlations between\nstate preparation and measurement outcome. Here, we study this duality of the\nquantum realization. We present a family of Bell inequalities tailored to the\ntask at hand and study their quantum violations. Remarkably, we show that the\nuse of spatial and sequential quantum correlations imposes different\nlimitations on the performance of quantum random access codes. We also show\nthat there exist random access codes for which spatial quantum correlations\noffer no gain over classical strategies, whereas sequential quantum\ncorrelations can yield an advantage. We discuss the physics behind the observed\ndiscrepancy between spatial and sequential quantum correlations.\n", "  Accelerator technology has advanced tremendously since the introduction of\naccelerators in the 1930s, and particle accelerators have become indispensable\ninstruments in high energy physics (HEP) research to probe Nature at smaller\nand smaller distances. At present, accelerator facilities can be classified\ninto Energy Frontier colliders that enable direct discoveries and studies of\nhigh mass scale particles and Intensity Frontier accelerators for exploration\nof extremely rare processes, usually at relatively low energies. The near term\nstrategies of the global energy frontier particle physics community are\ncentered on fully exploiting the physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN through its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), while the intensity\nfrontier HEP research is focused on studies of neutrinos at the MW-scale beam\npower accelerator facilities, such as Fermilab Main Injector with the planned\nPIP-II SRF linac project. A number of next generation accelerator facilities\nhave been proposed and are currently under consideration for the medium- and\nlong-term future programs of accelerator-based HEP research. In this paper, we\nbriefly review the post-LHC energy frontier options, both for lepton and hadron\ncolliders in various regions of the world, as well as possible future intensity\nfrontier accelerator facilities.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Power Law Entropy Corrected Holographic Dark\nEnergy (PLECHDE) model in the framework of a non-flat Universe and of\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology with infrared cut-off given by recently proposed\nGranda-Oliveros cut-off, which contains one term proportional to the Hubble\nparameter squared $H^2$ and one term proportional to the first time derivative\nof the Hubble parameter $\\dot{H}$. Moreover, this cut-off is characterized by\ntwo constant parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. For the two cases corresponding\nto non-interacting and interacting DE and Dark Matter (DM), we derive the\nevolutionary form of the energy density of DE $\\Omega_D'$, the Equation of\nState (EoS) parameter of DE $\\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$.\nUsing the parametrization of the EoS parameter\n$\\omega_D\\left(z\\right)=\\omega_0+\\omega_1 z$, we obtain the expressions of the\ntwo parameters $\\omega_0$ and $\\omega_1$. We also study the statefinder\nparameters $\\left\\{ r,s \\right\\}$, the snap and lerk cosmographic parameters\nand the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$. We also calculate the values of the\nquantities we study for different values of the running parameter $\\lambda$ and\nfor different set of values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n", "  Chirality of neutrinos modifies the conventional kinetic theory and\nhydrodynamics, leading to unusual chiral transport related to quantum anomalies\nin field theory. We argue that these corrections have new phenomenological\nconsequences for hot and dense neutrino gases, especially in core-collapse\nsupernovae. We find that the neutrino density can be converted to the fluid\nhelicity through the chiral vortical effect. This fluid helicity effectively\nacts as a chiral chemical potential for electrons via the momentum exchange\nwith neutrinos and induces a \"helical plasma instability\" that generates a\nstrong helical magnetic field. This provides a new mechanism for converting the\ngravitational energy released by the core collapse to the electromagnetic\nenergy and potentially explains the origin of magnetars. The other possible\napplications of the neutrino chiral transport theory are also discussed.\n", "  Water is believed to be harmful for the stability of phosphorene.On the\ncontrary, the presence of small amount of water allows the synthesis of\nhigh-quality material in liquid exfoliation of black phosphorus using\ndimethylsulfoxide as solvent. A phosphorus/water molar ratio between 1.5 and 14\nmaximizes the quality of the phosphorene flakes and their stability.\n", "  We describe a microscope-based optical setup that allows us to perform\nspace-and time-resolved measurements of the spectral reflectance of transparent\nsubstrates coated with ultrathin films. This technique is applied to\ninvestigate the behavior in water of thermosensitive polymer brushes made of\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) grafted on glass. We show that spectral reflectance\nmeasurements yield quantitative information about the conformation and axial\nstructure of the brushes as a function of temperature. We study how molecular\nparameters (grafting density, chain length) affect the hydra-tion state of a\nbrush, and provide one of the few experimental evidence for the occurrence of\nvertical phase separation in the vicinity of the lower critical solution\ntemperature of the polymer. The origin of the hysteretic behavior of\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes upon cycling the temperature is also\nclarified. We thus demonstrate that our optical technique allows for in-depth\ncharacterization of stimuli-responsive polymer layers, which is crucial for the\nrational design of smart polymer coatings in actuation, gating or sensing\napplications.\n", "  The Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy is the archetype of\ninfinite-dimensional integrable systems, which describes nonlinear ion acoustic\nwaves in two-dimensional space. This remarkably ordered system resides on a\nsingular submanifold (leaf) embedded in a larger phase space of more general\nion acoustic waves (low-frequency electrostatic perturbations). The KP\nhierarchy is characterized not only by small amplitudes but also by\nirrotational (zero-vorticity) velocity fields. In fact, the KP equation is\nderived by eliminating vorticity at every order of the reductive perturbation.\nHere we modify the scaling of the velocity field so as to introduce a vortex\nterm. The newly derived system of equations consists of a generalized\nthree-dimensional KP equation and a two-dimensional vortex equation. The former\ndescribes `scattering' of vortex-free waves by ambient vortexes that are\ndetermined by the latter. We say that the vortexes are `ambient' because they\ndo not receive reciprocal reactions from the waves (i.e., the vortex equation\nis independent of the wave fields). This model describes a minimal departure\nfrom the integrable KP system. By the Painlev\\'e test, we delineate how the\nvorticity term violates integrability, bringing about an essential\nthree-dimensionality to the solutions. By numerical simulation, we show how the\nsolitons are scattered by vortexes and become chaotic.\n", "  In this study we investigate regular black hole solutions of the\nnon-minimally coupled $ Y(R)F^2 $ gravity model. We give two regular black hole\nsolutions and the corresponding non-minimal model for both electrically or\nmagnetically charged cases. We calculate all the energy conditions for these\nsolutions.\n", "  We study a singlet extension of the minimal $U(1)_R$ symmetric model, which\nshares nice properties of Dirac gauginos and $R$-symmetric Higgs sector. At the\nsame time, a superpotential coupling of $R$-charged singlet to the Higgs\ndoublets can give a substantial contribution to the Higgs boson mass. We show\nthat the 125 GeV Higgs boson is consistent with perturbative unification, even\nif the SUSY scale is as low as 1 TeV and if the $D$-term Higgs potential is\nsuppressed as is often the case in Dirac gauginos. The model also contains a\nlight scalar and fermion, pseudo-moduli and pseudo-Goldstino: The former gets a\nmass mainly from SUSY breaking soft terms, in addition to a small explicit\n$R$-symmetry breaking for the latter. We examine how the Higgs mass and width\nare affected by these light degrees of freedom. Specifically we find\nthatdepending on parameters of $R$-charged Higgses, the pseudo-moduli lighter\nthan a half of the SM-Higgs boson mass is still allowed by the constraints from\ninvisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons. We also find that such a light\nscalar can reduce the Higgs boson mass, at most by a few percents.\n", "  Binary sequences with minimal autocorrelations have applications in\ncommunication engineering, mathematics and computer science. In statistical\nphysics they appear as groundstates of the Bernasconi model. Finding these\nsequences is a notoriously hard problem, that so far can be solved only by\nexhaustive search. We review recent algorithms and present a new algorithm that\nfinds optimal sequences of length $N$ in time $\\Theta(N\\,1.73^N)$. We computed\nall optimal sequences for $N\\leq 66$ and all optimal skewsymmetric sequences\nfor $N\\leq 119$.\n", "  Charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via $H^{\\pm}\n\\rightarrow tb$ are searched for in proton--proton collisions measured with the\nATLAS experiment at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with\na top quark, $gb \\rightarrow tH^{\\pm}$, is explored in the mass range 200 to\n600 GeV using multi-jet final states with one electron or muon. In order to\nseparate the signal from the Standard Model background, analysis techniques\ncombining several kinematic variables are employed. An excess of events above\nthe background-only hypothesis is observed across a wide mass range, amounting\nto up to 2.4 standard deviations. Upper limits are set on the $gb\\rightarrow\ntH^{\\pm}$ production cross section times the branching fraction\n$\\mathrm{BR}(H^{\\pm} \\rightarrow tb)$. Additionally, the complementary\n$s$-channel production, $qq' \\rightarrow H^{\\pm}$, is investigated through a\nreinterpretation of $W' \\rightarrow tb$ searches in ATLAS. Final states with\none electron or muon are relevant for $H^{\\pm}$ masses from 0.4 to 2.0 TeV,\nwhereas the all-hadronic final state covers the range 1.5 to 3.0 TeV. In these\nsearch channels, no significant excesses from the predictions of the Standard\nModel are observed, and upper limits are placed on the $qq' \\rightarrow\nH^{\\pm}$ production cross section times the branching fraction BR$(H^{\\pm}\n\\rightarrow tb)$.\n", "  The $ZZ$ production cross section in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV\ncenter-of-mass energy is measured using 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded with the\nATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The considered $Z$ boson\ncandidates decay to an electron or muon pair of mass 66-116 GeV. The cross\nsection is measured in a fiducial phase space reflecting the detector\nacceptance. It is also extrapolated to a total phase space for $Z$ bosons in\nthe same mass range and of all decay modes, giving\n$16.7^{+2.2}_{-2.0}$(stat.)$^{+0.9}_{-0.7}$(syst.)$^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$(lumi.) pb.\nThe results agree with standard model predictions.\n", "  We study vacuum stability in 1+1 dimensional Conformal Field Theories with\nexternal background fields. We show that the vacuum decay rate is given by a\nnon-local two-form. This two-form is a boundary term that must be added to the\neffective in/out Lagrangian. The two-form is expressed in terms of a\nRiemann-Hilbert decomposition for background gauge fields, and its novel\n\"functional\" version in the gravitational case.\n", "  Many real-world networks such as the gene networks, protein-protein\ninteraction networks and metabolic networks exhibit community structures,\nmeaning the existence of groups of densely connected vertices in the networks.\nMany local similarity measures in the networks are closely related to the\nconcept of the community structures, and may have positive effect on community\ndetection in the networks. Here, various local similarity measures are used to\nextract the local structural information and then are applied to community\ndetection in the networks by using the edge-reweighting strategy. The effect of\nthe local similarity measures on community detection is carefully investigated\nand compared in various networks. The experimental results show that the local\nsimilarity measures are crucial to the improvement for the community detection\nmethods, while the positive effect of the local similarity measures is closely\nrelated to the networks under study and the applied community detection\nmethods.\n", "  In this paper, we interpret the 750 GeV diphoton excess in the Zee-Babu\nextension of the two-Higgs-doublet model by introducing a top partner\n($T$)/bottom partner ($B$). In the alignment limit, the 750 GeV resonance is\nidentified as the heavy CP-even Higgs boson ($H$), which can be sizably\nproduced via the QCD process $pp \\to T\\bar{T}$ or $pp \\to B\\bar{B}$ followed by\nthe decay $T\\to Ht$ or $B \\to Hb$. The diphoton decay rate of $H$ is greatly\nenhanced by the charged singlet scalars predicted in the Zee-Babu extension and\nthe total width of $H$ can be as large as 7 GeV. Under the current LHC\nconstraints, we scan the parameter space and find that such an extension can\naccount for the observed diphoton excess.\n", "  We perform a theoretical study of nonlinear optical isolator devices based on\ncoupled microcavities with gain and loss. Using coupled-mode theory, we derive\na correspondence between the boundary of asymptotic stability in the nonlinear\nregime, where gain saturation is present, and the PT-breaking transition in the\nunderlying linear system. For zero detuning and weak input intensity, the onset\nof optical isolation can be rigorously derived, and corresponds precisely to\nthe PT transition point. When the couplings to the external ports are unequal,\nthe isolation ratio exhibits an abrupt jump at the transition point, determined\nby the ratio of the couplings. This could be exploited to realize an actively\ncontrolled nonlinear optical isolator, in which strong optical isolation can be\nswitched on or off using tiny variations in the inter-resonator separation.\n", "  This work has the main objective to provide a detailed investigation of\ncosmic ray propagation in magnetohydrodynamic turbulent fields generated by\nforcing the fluid velocity field at large scales. It provides a derivation of\nthe particle mean free path dependences in terms of the turbulence level\ndescribed by the Alfv\\'enic Mach number and in terms of the particle rigidity.\nWe use an upgrade version of the magnetohydrodynamic code {\\tt RAMSES} which\nincludes a forcing module and a kinetic module and solve the Lorentz equation\nfor each particle. The simulations are performed using a 3 dimension periodical\nbox in the test-particle and magnetostatic limits. The forcing module is\nimplemented using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An ensemble average over a\nlarge number of particle trajectories is applied to reconstruct the particle\nmean free paths. We derive the cosmic ray mean free paths in terms of the\nAlfv\\'enic Mach numbers and particle reduced rigidities in different turbulence\nforcing geometries. The reduced particle rigidity is $\\rho=r_L/L$ where $r_L$\nis the particle Larmor radius and $L$ is the simulation box length related to\nthe turbulence coherence or injection scale $L_{inj}$ by $L \\sim 5 L_{inj}$. We\nhave investigated with a special attention compressible and solenoidal forcing\ngeometries. We find that compressible forcing solutions are compatible with the\nquasi-linear theory or more advanced non-linear theories which predict a\nrigidity dependence as $\\rho^{1/2}$ or $\\rho^{1/3}$. Solenoidal forcing\nsolutions at least at low or moderate Alfv\\'enic numbers are not compatible\nwith the above theoretical expectations and require more refined arguments to\nbe interpreted. It appears especially for Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers close to one\nthat the wandering of field lines controls perpendicular mean free path\nsolutions whatever the forcing geometry.\n", "  We investigate collective emission from coherently driven ultracold $ ^{88} $\nSr atoms. We perform two sets of experiments, using a strong and weak\ntransition that are insensitive and sensitive, respectively, to atomic motion\nat one microKelvin. We observe highly directional forward emission with a peak\nintensity that is enhanced, for the strong transition, by > $ 10 ^3 $ compared\nto that in the transverse direction. This is accompanied by substantial\nbroadening of spectral lines. For the weak transition, the forward enhancement\nis substantially reduced due to motion. Meanwhile, a density-dependent\nfrequency shift of the weak transition (~10% of the natural linewidth) is\nobserved. In contrast, this shift is suppressed to <1% of the natural linewidth\nfor the strong transition. Along the transverse direction, we observe strong\npolarization dependences of the fluorescence intensity and line broadening for\nboth transitions. The measurements are reproduced with a theoretical model\ntreating the atoms as coherent, interacting, radiating dipoles.\n", "  Neutrino-neutrino refraction in dense media can cause self-induced flavor\nconversion triggered by collective run-away modes of the interacting flavor\noscillators. The growth rates were usually found to be of order a typical\nvacuum oscillation frequency $\\Delta m^2/2E$. However, even in the simple case\nof a $\\nu_e$ beam interacting with an opposite-moving $\\bar\\nu_e$ beam, and\nallowing for spatial inhomogeneities, the growth rate of the fastest-growing\nFourier mode is of order $\\mu=\\sqrt{2} G_{\\rm F} n_{\\nu}$, a typical\n$\\nu$--$\\nu$ interaction energy. This growth rate is much larger than the\nvacuum oscillation frequency and gives rise to flavor conversion on a much\nshorter time scale. This phenomenon of \"fast flavor conversion\" occurs even for\nvanishing $\\Delta m^2/2E$ and thus does not depend on energy, but only on the\nangle distributions. Moreover, it does not require neutrinos to mix or to have\nmasses, except perhaps for providing seed disturbances. We also construct a\nsimple homogeneous example consisting of intersecting beams and study a\nschematic supernova model proposed by Ray Sawyer, where $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$\nemerge with different zenith-angle distributions, the key ingredient for fast\nflavor conversion. What happens in realistic astrophysical scenarios remains to\nbe understood.\n", "  In simulations and experiments, we study the drying of films containing\nmixtures of large and small colloidal particles in water. During drying, the\nmixture stratifies into a layer of the larger particles at the bottom with a\nlayer of the smaller particles on top. We developed a model to show that a\ngradient in osmotic pressure, which develops dynamically during drying, is\nresponsible for the segregation mechanism behind stratification.\n", "  We review progress that has been made to constructa theory for the jet\nformation and maintenance in planetary atmospheres. The theory is built in the\nregime where velocityfluctuations around the base jet are very small compared\nto the zonaljet velocity itself. Such situations are frequent in many\nnaturaljets, for instance in the atmosphere of outer planets, the most\nprominentexample being probably Jupiter's troposphere jets. As discussed\ninother chapters of this book, fluctuations close to Jupiter zonaljets are\nsmaller than the zonal jets themselves. In such a regime, it is natural and\noften justified to treat the non-zonalpart of the dynamics with a quasi-linear\napproximation: at leadingorder the dynamics of the non-zonal flow is described\nby theequation linearized close to the quasi-stationary zonal jets. The theory,\nbased on a multi-scale method called stochastic averaging, share similarities\nwith Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T) and with second order\nclosure(CE2), also discussed in other chapters of the book.The aim of this\ncontribution is to discuss the theoretical aspects of sucha quasilinear\ndescription of statistically stationary jets. The basicquestions are: when does\nsuch an approach is expected to be valid,why, what are the limitations and the\nexpected errors done doing suchapproximations?\n", "  Fourier ptychographic (FP) microscope is a coherent imaging method that can\nsynthesize an image with a higher bandwidth using multiple low-bandwidth images\ncaptured at different spatial frequency regions. The method's demand for\nmultiple images drives the need for a brighter illumination scheme and a\nhigh-frame-rate camera for a faster acquisition. We report the use of a guided\nlaser beam as an illumination source for an FP microscope. It uses a mirror\narray and a 2-dimensional scanning Galvo mirror system to provide a sample with\nplane-wave illuminations at diverse incidence angles. The use of a laser\npresents speckles in the image capturing process due to reflections between\nglass surfaces in the system. They appear as slowly varying background\nfluctuations in the final reconstructed image. We are able to mitigate these\nartifacts by including a phase image obtained by differential phase contrast\n(DPC) deconvolution in the FP algorithm. We use a 1-Watt laser configured to\nprovide a collimated beam with 150 mW of power and beam diameter of 1 cm to\nallow for the total capturing time of 0.96 seconds for 96 raw FP input images\nin our system, with the camera sensor's frame rate being the bottleneck for\nspeed. We demonstrate a factor of 4.25 resolution improvement using a 0.1 NA\nobjective lens over the full camera field-of-view of 2.7 mm by 1.5 mm.\n", "  On 14th September 2015, a transient gravitational wave (GW150914) was\ndetected by the two LIGO detectors at Hanford and Livingston from the\ncoalescence of a binary black hole system located at a distance of about 400\nMpc. We point out that GW150914 experienced a Shapiro delay due to the\ngravitational potential of the mass distribution along the line of sight of\nabout 1800 days. Also, the near-simultaneous arrival of gravitons over a\nfrequency range of about 100 Hz within a 0.2 second window allows us to\nconstrain any violations of Shapiro delay and Einstein's equivalence principle\nbetween the gravitons at different frequencies. From the calculated Shapiro\ndelay and the observed duration of the signal, frequency-dependent violations\nof the equivalence principle for gravitons are constrained to an accuracy of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$\n", "  This paper describes a robust linear time-invariant output-feedback control\nstrategy to reduce turbulent fluctuations, and therefore skin-friction drag, in\nwall-bounded turbulent fluid flows, that nonetheless gives performance\nguarantees in the nonlinear turbulent regime. The novel strategy is effective\nin reducing the supply of available energy to feed the turbulent fluctuations,\nexpressed as reducing a bound on the supply rate to a quadratic storage\nfunction. The nonlinearity present in the equations that govern the dynamics of\nthe flow is known to be passive and can be considered as a feedback forcing to\nthe linearised dynamics (a Lur'e decomposition). Therefore, one is only\nrequired to control the linear dynamics in order to make the system close to\npassive. The ten most energy-producing spatial modes of a turbulent channel\nflow were identified. Passivity-based controllers were then generated to\ncontrol these modes. The controllers require measurements of streamwise and\nspanwise wall-shear stress, and they actuate via wall transpiration. Nonlinear\ndirect numerical simulations demonstrated that these controllers were capable\nof significantly reducing the turbulent energy and skin-friction drag of the\nflow.\n", "  We study geometric relativistic flow and Ricci soliton equations which (for\nrespective nonholonomic constraints and self-similarity conditions) are\nequivalent to the gravitational field equations of $R^2$ gravity and/or to the\nEinstein equations with scalar field in general relativity, GR. Perelman's\nfunctionals are generalized for modified gravity theories, MGTs, which allows\nto formulate an analogous statistical thermodynamics for geometric flows and\nRicci solitons. There are constructed and analyzed generic off-diagonal black\nellipsoid, black hole and solitonic exact solutions in MGTs and GR encoding\ngeometric flow evolution scenarios and nonlinear parametric interactions. Such\nnew classes of solutions in MGTs can be with polarized and/or running\nconstants, nonholonomically deformed horizons and/or imbedded self-consistently\ninto solitonic backgrounds. They exist also in GR as generic off-diagonal\nvacuum configurations with effective cosmological constant and/or mimicking\neffective scalar field interactions. Finally, we compute Perelman's energy and\nentropy for black ellipsoids and evolution solitons in $R^2$ gravity.\n", "  A quantum-mechanical (QM) method rooted on density functional theory (DFT)\nhas been employed to determine conformations of the methane-thiosulfonate spin\nlabel (MTSL) attached to a fragment extracted from the activation loop of\nAurora-A kinase. The features of the calculated energy surface revealed low\nenergy barriers between isoenergetic minima and the system could be described\nin a population of 76 rotamers that can be also considered for other systems\nsince it was found that the X3, X4 and X5 do not depend on the previous two\ndihedral angles. Conformational states obtained were seen to comparable to\nthose obtained in the {\\alpha}-helix systems studied previously, indicating\nthat the protein backbone does not affect the torsional profiles significantly\nand suggesting the possibility to use determined conformations for other\nprotein systems for further modelling studies.\n", "  The study of the Brownian motion of a charged particle in electric and\nmagnetic fields fields has many important applications in plasma and heavy ions\nphysics, as well as in astrophysics. In the present paper we consider the\nelectromagnetic radiation properties of a charged non-relativistic particle in\nthe presence of electric and magnetic fields, of an exterior\nnon-electromagnetic potential, and of a friction and stochastic force,\nrespectively. We describe the motion of the charged particle by a Langevin and\ngeneralized Langevin type stochastic differential equation. We investigate in\ndetail the cases of the Brownian motion with or without memory in a constant\nelectric field, in the presence of an external harmonic potential, and of a\nconstant magnetic field. In all cases the corresponding Langevin equations are\nsolved numerically, and a full description of the spectrum of the emitted\nradiation and of the physical properties of the motion is obtained. The Power\nSpectral Density (PSD) of the emitted power is also obtained for each case,\nand, for all considered oscillating systems, it shows the presence of peaks,\ncorresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.\n", "  This white paper informs the nuclear astrophysics community and funding\nagencies about the scientific directions and priorities of the field and\nprovides input from this community for the 2015 Nuclear Science Long Range\nPlan. It summarizes the outcome of the nuclear astrophysics town meeting that\nwas held on August 21-23, 2014 in College Station at the campus of Texas A&M\nUniversity in preparation of the NSAC Nuclear Science Long Range Plan. It also\nreflects the outcome of an earlier town meeting of the nuclear astrophysics\ncommunity organized by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) on\nOctober 9- 10, 2012 Detroit, Michigan, with the purpose of developing a vision\nfor nuclear astrophysics in light of the recent NRC decadal surveys in nuclear\nphysics (NP2010) and astronomy (ASTRO2010). The white paper is furthermore\ninformed by the town meeting of the Association of Research at University\nNuclear Accelerators (ARUNA) that took place at the University of Notre Dame on\nJune 12-13, 2014. In summary we find that nuclear astrophysics is a modern and\nvibrant field addressing fundamental science questions at the intersection of\nnuclear physics and astrophysics. These questions relate to the origin of the\nelements, the nuclear engines that drive life and death of stars, and the\nproperties of dense matter. A broad range of nuclear accelerator facilities,\nastronomical observatories, theory efforts, and computational capabilities are\nneeded. With the developments outlined in this white paper, answers to long\nstanding key questions are well within reach in the coming decade.\n", "  Thin layers of black phosphorus present an ideal combination of a 2D material\nwith a tunable direct bandgap and high carrier mobility. However the material\nsuffers from degradation in ambient conditions due to an oxidation reaction\nwhich involves water, oxygen and light. We have measured the spatial profile of\nthe conductivity on flakes of black phosphorus as a function of time using\nscanning microwave impedance microscopy. A microwave excitation (3 GHz) allows\nto image a conducting sample even when covered with a dielectric layer. We\nobserve that on bare black phosphorus, the conductivity changes drastically\nover the whole surface within a day. We demonstrate that the degradation\nprocess is slowed down considerably by covering the material with a 10 nm layer\nof hafnium oxide. It is stable for more than a week, opening up a route towards\nstable black phosphorus devices in which the high dielectric constant of\nhafnium oxide can be exploited. Covering black phosphorus with a 15 nm boron\nnitride flake changes the degradation process qualitatively, it is dominated by\nthe edges of the flake indicating a diffusive process and happens on the scale\nof days.\n", "  The mechanism of Cooper pair formation in iron-based superconductors remains\na controversial topic. The main question is whether spin or orbital\nfluctuations are responsible for the pairing mechanism. To solve this problem,\na crucial clue can be obtained by examining the remarkable enhancement of\nmagnetic neutron scattering signals appearing in a superconducting phase. The\nenhancement is called spin resonance for a spin fluctuation model, in which\ntheir energy is restricted below twice the superconducting gap value (2Ds),\nwhereas larger energies are possible in other models such as an orbital\nfluctuation model. Here we report the doping dependence of low-energy magnetic\nexcitation spectra in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 for 0.5<x<0.84 studied by inelastic neutron\nscattering. We find that the behavior of the spin resonance dramatically\nchanges from optimum to overdoped regions. Strong resonance peaks are observed\nclearly below 2Ds in the optimum doping region, while they are absent in the\noverdoped region. Instead, there is a transfer of spectral weight from energies\nbelow 2Ds to higher energies, peaking at values of 3Ds for x = 0.84. These\nresults suggest a reduced impact of magnetism on Cooper pair formation in the\noverdoped region.\n", "  We obtain a nonsmooth higher-order extension of Noether's symmetry theorem\nfor variational isoperimetric problems with delayed arguments. The result is\nproved to be valid in the class of Lipschitz functions, as long as the delayed\nhigher-order Euler--Lagrange extremals are restricted to those that satisfy the\ndelayed higher-order DuBois--Reymond necessary optimality condition. The\nimportant case of delayed isoperimetric optimal control problems is considered\nas well.\n", "  We suggest an analogy between energetic particle and magnetic field\nobservations made by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in the distant heliosheath at 122\nAU in August 2012, and those made in the distant geomagnetic tail by the ISEE 3\nspacecraft in 1982-1983, despite large differences in the time and distance\nscales. The analogy suggests that in August, 2012, Voyager 1 may not have moved\nfrom the anomalous cosmic ray (ACR)-dominated heliosheath into the interstellar\nmedium but into a region equivalent to the \"lobes\" of the geomagnetic tail,\ncomposed of heliospheric field lines which have reconnected with the\ninterstellar medium beyond the spacecraft and so are open to the entry of\ncosmic rays, while heliospheric particles (e.g., ACRs) are free to escape, and\nwhich maintain a ~Parker spiral configuration. The heliopause, analogous to the\nmagnetopause forming the outer boundary of the lobes, may then lie beyond this\nso-called \"heliocliff\". Even if this analogy is incorrect, the remarkable\nsimilarities between the energetic particle and magnetic field observations in\nthese very different regions are worth noting.\n", "  We present a laboratory experiment of the growth of a turbulent patch in a\nstably stratified fluid, due to a localized source of turbulence, generated by\nan oscillating grid. Synchronized and overlapping particle image velocimetry\nand planar laser induced fluorescence measurements have been conducted\ncapturing the evolution of the patch through its initial growth until it\nreached a maximum size, followed by its collapse. The simultaneous measurements\nof density and velocity fields allow for a direct quantification of the degree\nof mixing within the patch, the propagation speed of the\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface and its thickness. The velocity measurements\nindicate significant non-equilibrium effects inside the patch which are not\nconsistent with the classical used grid-action model. A local analysis of the\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface provides direct measurements of the\nentrainment velocity $w_{e}$ as compared to the local vertical velocity and\nturbulent intensity at the proximity of the interface. It is found that the\nentrainment rate $E$ is constrained in the range of $0{\\div}0.1$ and that the\nlocal, gradient Richardson number at the interface is $\\mathcal{O} (100)$.\nFinally, we show that the mean flow is responsible for the patch collapse.\n", "  In the random acceleration process, a point particle is accelerated according\nto $\\ddot{x}=\\eta(t)$, where the right hand side represents Gaussian white\nnoise with zero mean. We begin with the case of a particle with initial\nposition $x_0$ and initial velocity $v_0$ and review the statistics of its\nfirst arrival at the origin and its first return to the origin. Multiple\nreturns to the origin, motion with a constant force in addition to a random\nforce, and persistence properties for several boundary conditions at the origin\nare also considered. Next we review first-exit properties of a randomly\naccelerated particle from the finite interval $0<x<1$. Then the close\nconnection between the extreme value statistics of a randomly accelerated\nparticle and its first-passage properties is discussed. Finally some\napplications where first-passage statistics of the random acceleration process\nplay a role are considered.\n", "  A new model of nonlinear electromagnetic fields possessing a dimensional\nparameter $\\beta$ is proposed. Electromagnetic fields are considered as the\nsource of the gravitation field and accelerated expansion of the universe is\ndriven by nonlinear electromagnetic fields. We consider the magnetic universe\nand the stochastic magnetic field is a source of the universe acceleration.\nAfter the universe inflation and the accelerated expansion the universe\ndecelerates. We show the causality of the model and a classical stability at\nthe deceleration phase. The spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the\nrunning of the spectral index were estimated that approximately fulfil the\nPLANK, WMAP, and BICEP2 data.\n", "  BEANS software is a web based, easy to install and maintain, new tool to\nstore and analyse data in a distributed way for a massive amount of data. It\nprovides a clear interface for querying, filtering, aggregating, and plotting\ndata from an arbitrary number of datasets. Its main purpose is to simplify the\nprocess of storing, examining and finding new relations in the so-called Big\nData.\n  Creation of BEANS software is an answer to the growing needs of the\nastronomical community to have a versatile tool to store, analyse and compare\nthe complex astrophysical numerical simulations with observations (e.g.\nsimulations of the Galaxy or star clusters with the Gaia archive). However,\nthis software was built in a general form and it is ready to use in any other\nresearch field or open source software.\n", "  Measuring microorganisms in food products is a critical issue for food safety\nand human health. Although various approaches for detecting low-levels of\nmicroorganisms in food have been developed, they require high-cost, complex\nequipment, invasive procedures, and skilled technicians which limit their\nwidespread use in the food industry. Here, we present a simple,\nnon-destructive, non-contact, and rapid optical method for measuring living\nmicroorganisms in meat products using laser speckle decorrelation. By simply\nmeasuring dynamic speckle intensity patterns reflected from samples and\nanalyzing the temporal correlation time, the presence of living microorganisms\ncan be non-invasively detected with high sensitivity. We present\nproof-of-principle demonstrations for detecting E. coli and B. cereus in\nchicken breast tissues.\n", "  The Gaia archive is being designed and implemented by the DPAC Consortium.\nThe purpose of the archive is to maximize the scientific exploitation of the\nGaia data by the astronomical community. Thus, it is crucial to gather and\ndiscuss with the community the features of the Gaia archive as much as\npossible. It is especially important from the point of view of the GENIUS\nproject to gather the feedback and potential use cases for the archive. This\npaper presents very briefly the general ideas behind the Gaia archive and\npresents which tools are already provided to the community.\n", "  There has been increasing interest in studying the Richardson model from\nwhich one can derive the exact solution for certain pairing Hamiltonians.\nHowever, it is still a numerical challenge to solve the nonlinear equations\ninvolved. In this paper we tackle this problem by employing a simple hybrid\npolynomial approach. The method is found to be robust and is valid for both\ndeformed and nearly spherical nuclei. It also provides important and convenient\ninitial guesses for spherical systems with large degeneracy. As an example, we\napply the method to study the shape coexistence in neutron-rich Ni isotopes.\n", "  The path-integral formulation of the hadronic tensor W_{\\mu\\nu} of deep\ninelastic scattering is reviewed. It is shown that there are 3 gauge invariant\nand topologically distinct contributions. The separation of the connected sea\npartons from those of the disconnected sea can be achieved with a combination\nof the global fit of the parton distribution function (PDF), the semi-inclusive\nDIS data on the strange PDF and the lattice calculation of the ratio of the\nstrange to $u/d$ momentum fraction in the disconnected insertion. We shall\ndiscuss numerical issues associated with lattice calculation of the hadronic\ntensor involving a four-point function, such as large hadron momenta and\nimproved maximum entropy method to obtain the spectral density from the\nhadronic tensor in Euclidean time. We also draw a comparison between the large\nmomentum approach to the parton distribution function (PDF) and the hadronic\ntensor approach.\n", "  We present systematic wetting experiments and numerical simulations of\ngravity driven liquid drops sliding on a plane substrate decorated with a\nlinear chemical step. Surprisingly, the optimal direction to observe crossing\nis not the one perpendicular to the step, but a finite angle that depends on\nthe material parameters. We computed the landscapes of the force acting on the\ndrop by means of a contact line mobility model showing that contact angle\nhysteresis dominates the dynamics at the step and determines whether the drop\npasses onto the lower substrate. This analysis is very well supported by the\nexperimental dynamic phase diagram in terms of pinning, crossing, sliding and\nsliding followed by pinning.\n", "  Frequencies of the three quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) modes observed\nsimultaneously in the accreting black hole GRO J1655-40 are compared with the\npredictions of models. Models in which all three QPO signals are produced at\nthe same radius are considered: these include different versions of\nrelativistic precession, epicyclic resonance, tidal disruption, and warped disc\nmodels. Models that were originally proposed to interpret only the twin\nhigh-frequency QPOs are generalized here to interpret also the low-frequency\nQPO in terms of relativistic nodal precession. Inferred values of the black\nhole mass and spin from each QPO model are compared with the mass measured from\noptical observations and the spin inferred from X-ray spectroscopy techniques.\nWe find that along with the relativistic precession model predicting\n$M=(5.3\\pm0.1)~M_{\\odot}, a=0.286\\pm0.004$, the so-called total precession\nmodel ($M=(5.5\\pm0.1)~M_{\\odot}, a=0.276\\pm0.003$), and the resonance epicyclic\nmodel with beat frequency ($M=(5.1\\pm0.1)~M_{\\odot}, a=0.274\\pm0.003$) also\nsatisfy the optical mass test. We compare our results with those inferred from\nX-ray spectral measurements.\n", "  Large complexes of classical particles play central roles in biology, in\npolymer physics, and in other disciplines. However, physics currently lacks\nmathematical methods for describing such complexes in terms of component\nparticles, interaction energies, and assembly rules. Here we describe a Fock\nspace structure that addresses this need, as well as diagrammatic methods that\nfacilitate the use of this formalism. These methods can dramatically simplify\nthe equations governing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium stochastic\nchemical systems. A mathematical relationship between the set of all complexes\nand a list of rules for complex assembly is also identified.\n", "  Ionized geocosmic media parameters in a thermal and a subthermal range of\nenergy have a number of unique features. The photoresonance plasma that is\nformed by optical excitation of the lowest excited (resonance) atomic states is\none example of conversion of radiation energy into electrical one. Since\nspontaneous fluorescence of excited atoms is probabilistic, the description of\nthe radiating quantized system evolution along with photons energy transfer in\na cold atoms medium, should include elements of stochastic dynamics. Finally,\nthe chaotic dynamics of a weakly bound Rydberg electron over a grid of the\nenergy levels diagram of a quasi-molecular Rydberg complex provides an\nexcitation migration of the electron forward to the ionization continuum. This\nwork aims at discussing the specific features of the dynamic resonances\nformalism in the description of processes involving Rydberg states of an\nexcited atom, including features in the fluorescence spectrum partially caused\nby the quantum defect control due to the presence of statistic electromagnetic\nfields.\n", "  Creep mechanisms in uniaxially compressed 3D granular solids comprised of\nfaceted frictionless grains are studied numerically using a constant pressure\nand constant stress simulation method. Rapid uniaxial compression followed by\nslow dilation is predicted on the basis of a logarithmic creep phenomenon.\nMicromechanical analysis indicates the existence of a correlation between\ngranular creep and grain-scale deformations. Localized regions of large strain\nappear during creep and grow in magnitude and size with time. Furthermore, the\naccumulation of non-affine granular displacements increases linearly with local\nstrain, thereby providing insights into the origins of plastic dissipation\nduring stress-driven creep evolution. The prediction of slow logarithmic\ndynamics in the absence of friction indicates a universality in the role of\nplastic dissipation during the creep of granular solids.\n", "  Diamond has been extensively investigated recently due to a wide range of\npotential applications of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers existing in a\ndiamond lattice. The applications include magnetometry and quantum information\ntechnologies, and long decoherence time ($T_2$) of NV centers is critical for\nthose applications. Although it has been known that $T_2$ highly depends on the\nconcentration of paramagnetic impurities in diamond, precise measurement of the\nimpurity concentration remains challenging. In the preset work, we show a\nmethod to determine a wide range of the nitrogen concentration ($n$) in diamond\nusing a wide-band high-frequency electron spin resonance and double\nelectron-electron resonance spectrometer. Moreover, we investigate $T_2$ of the\nnitrogen impurities and show the relationship between $T_2$ and $n$. The method\ndeveloped here is applicable for various spin systems in solid and\nimplementable in nanoscale magnetic resonance spectroscopy with NV centers to\ncharacterize the concentration of the paramagnetic spins within a microscopic\nvolume.\n", "  We report absolute frequency measurements of 81 hyperfine components of the\nrovibrational transitions of molecular iodine at 578 nm using the second\nharmonic generation of an 1156-nm external-cavity diode laser and a fiber-based\noptical frequency comb. The relative uncertainties of the measured absolute\nfrequencies are typically $1.4\\times10^{-11}$. Accurate hyperfine constants of\nfour rovibrational transitions are obtained by fitting the measured hyperfine\nsplittings to a four-term effective Hamiltonian including the electric\nquadrupole, spin-rotation, tensor spin-spin, and scalar spin-spin interactions.\nThe observed transitions can be good frequency references at 578 nm, and are\nespecially useful for research using atomic ytterbium since the transitions are\nclose to the $^{1}S_{0}-^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition of ytterbium.\n", "  Three-dimensional (3D) superconducting microwave cavities with large mode\nvolumes typically have high quality factors ($>10^6$). This is due to a reduced\nsensitivity to surface dielectric losses, which is the limiting source of\ndissipation in two-dimensional transmission line resonators. In recent years,\n3D microwave cavities have been extensively used for coupling and interacting\nwith superconducting quantum bits (qubits), providing a versatile platform for\nquantum information processing and hybrid quantum systems. A current issue that\nhas arisen is that 3D superconducting cavities do not permit magnetic field\ncontrol of qubits embedded in these cavities. In contrast, microwave cavities\nmade of normal metals can be transparent to magnetic fields, but experience a\nmuch lower quality factor ($\\sim 10^4$), which negates many of the advantages\nof the 3D architecture. In an attempt to create a device that bridges a gap\nbetween these two types of cavities, having magnetic field control and high\nquality factor, we have created a hybrid 3D cavity. This new cavity is\nprimarily composed of aluminium but also contains a small copper insert. We\nmeasured the internal quality factor of the hybrid cavity to be $102000$, which\nis an order of magnitude improvement over all previously tested copper\ncavities. An added benefit to that our hybrid cavity possesses is that it also\nprovides an improved thermal link to the sample that superconducting cavities\nalone cannot provide. In order to demonstrate precise magnetic control within\nthe cavity, we performed spectroscopy of three superconducting qubits placed in\nthe cavity, where individual control of each qubit's frequency was exerted with\nsmall wire coils attached to the cavity. A large improvement in quality factor\nand magnetic field control makes this 3D hybrid cavity an attractive new\nplatform for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments.\n", "  Non-invasive and single-shot holographic imaging through complex media is\ntechnically challenging due to random light scattering which significantly\nscrambles optical information. Recently, several methods have been presented to\naddress this issue. However, they require complicated measurements of optical\ntransmission matrices, or existing techniques do only retrieve intensity\ninformation. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a holographic\napproach for single-shot imaging through a scattering layer based on digital\nin-line holography in combination with the autocorrelation of the speckle\nintensity. Using a simple optical configuration and experimental procedure, the\nproposed method enables to retrieve the complex amplitude image of an object\nlocated at arbitrary planes behind scattering media. The technique has\npotential applications in biomedical imaging, deep tissue microscopy, and 3D\nimaging through turbid media.\n", "  A relatively unexplored issue in cybersecurity science and engineering is\nwhether there exist intrinsic patterns of cyberattacks. Conventional wisdom\nfavors absence of such patterns due to the overwhelming complexity of the\nmodern cyberspace. Surprisingly, through a detailed analysis of an extensive\ndata set that records the time-dependent frequencies of attacks over a\nrelatively wide range of consecutive IP addresses, we successfully uncover\nintrinsic spatiotemporal patterns underlying cyberattacks, where the term\n\"spatio\" refers to the IP address space. In particular, we focus on analyzing\n{\\em macroscopic} properties of the attack traffic flows and identify two main\npatterns with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics: deterministic and\nstochastic. Strikingly, there are very few sets of major attackers committing\nalmost all the attacks, since their attack \"fingerprints\" and target selection\nscheme can be unequivocally identified according to the very limited number of\nunique spatiotemporal characteristics, each of which only exists on a\nconsecutive IP region and differs significantly from the others. We utilize a\nnumber of quantitative measures, including the flux-fluctuation law, the Markov\nstate transition probability matrix, and predictability measures, to\ncharacterize the attack patterns in a comprehensive manner. A general finding\nis that the attack patterns possess high degrees of predictability, potentially\npaving the way to anticipating and, consequently, mitigating or even preventing\nlarge-scale cyberattacks using macroscopic approaches.\n", "  We develop relativistic non-Hermitian quantum theory and its application to\nneutrino physics in a strong magnetic field. It is well known, that one of the\nfundamental postulates of quantum theory is the requirement of Hermiticity of\nphysical parameters. This condition not only guarantees the reality of the\neigenvalues of Hamiltonian operators, but also implies the preservation of the\nprobabilities of the considered quantum processes. However as it was shown\nrelatively recently (Bender, Boettcher 1998), Hermiticity is a sufficient but\nit is not a necessary condition. It turned out that among non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians it is possible to allocate a number of such which have real energy\nspectra and can ensure the development of systems over time with preserving\nunitarity. This type of Hamiltonians includes so-called parity-time (${\\cal\nPT}$) symmetric models which is already used in various fields of modern\nphysics. The most developed in this respect are models, which used in the field\nof ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric optics, where for several years produced not only\ntheoretical but experimental studies.\n", "  The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with\nembedded nanoparticles (NPs) was calculated in range of the quantum-ballistic\nmodel. The simulation was performed for electron tunneling through the\ninsulating layer with embedded magnetic and nonmagnetic NPs within the approach\nof the double barrier subsystem connected in parallel to the single barrier\none. This model can be applied for both MTJs with in-plane magnetization and\nperpendicular one. We also calculated the in-plane component of the spin\ntransfer torque (STT) versus the applied voltage in MTJs with magnetic NPs and\ndetermined that its value can be much larger than in single barrier system\n(SBS) for the same tunneling thickness. The reported simulation reproduces\nexperimental data of the TMR suppression and peak-like TMR anomalies at low\nvoltages available in literature.\n", "  We consider the massive Klein-Gordon equation on a class of asymptotically\nstatic spacetimes. We prove the existence and Hadamard property of the in and\nout states constructed by scattering theory methods. Assuming in addition that\nthe metric approaches that of Minkowski space at infinity in a short-range way,\njointly in time and space variables, we define Feynman scattering data and\nprove the Fredholm property of the Klein-Gordon operator with the associated\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions. We then construct a parametrix (with\ncompact remainder terms) for the Fredholm problem and prove that it is also a\nFeynman parametrix in the sense of Duistermaat and H{\\\"o}rmander.\n", "  Ewald summation is an efficient method for computing the periodic sums that\nappear when considering the Green's functions of Stokes flow together with\nperiodic boundary conditions. We show how Ewald summation, and accompanying\ntruncation error estimates, can be easily derived for the rotlet, by\nconsidering it as a superposition of electrostatic force calculations.\n", "  In the quark sector, we experience a correlation between the mixing angles\nand the mass ratios. A partial realization of the similar tie-up in the\nneutrino sector helps to constrain the parametrization of masses and mixing,\nand hints for a predictive framework. We derive five hierarchy dependent\ntextures of neutrino mass matrix with minimum number of parameters ($\\leq\\,4$),\nfollowing a model-independent strategy.\n", "  This thesis reports advances in the theory of design, characterization and\nsimulation of multi-photon multi-channel interferometers. I advance the design\nof interferometers through an algorithm to realize an arbitrary discrete\nunitary transformation on the combined spatial and internal degrees of freedom\nof light. This procedure effects an arbitrary $n_{s}n_{p}\\times n_{s}n_{p}$\nunitary matrix on the state of light in $n_{s}$ spatial and $n_{p}$ internal\nmodes.\n  I devise an accurate and precise procedure for characterizing any multi-port\nlinear optical interferometer using one- and two-photon interference. Accuracy\nis achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to\nspatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision\nare attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to a curve simulated\nusing measured source spectra. The efficacy of our characterization procedure\nis verified by numerical simulations.\n  I develop group-theoretic methods for the analysis and simulation of linear\ninterferometers. I devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson\nrealizations of the canonical SU$(n)$ basis states, which reduce the canonical\nsubgroup chain, for arbitrary $n$. The boson realizations are employed to\nconstruct $\\mathcal{D}$-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary\nirreducible representations, of SU$(n)$ in the canonical basis. I show that\nimmanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum of the\ndiagonal $\\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$-functions of group element $\\Omega$ over $t$\ndetermined by the choice of submatrix and over the irrep $(\\lambda)$ determined\nby the immanant under consideration. The algorithm for $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$\n$\\mathcal{D}$-function computation and the results connecting these functions\nwith immanants open the possibility of group-theoretic analysis and simulation\nof linear optics.\n", "  We discuss the issue of distributed and cooperative decision-making in a\nnetwork game of public service location. Each node of the network can choose to\nbe a provider of service which is accessible to the provider itself and also to\nall the neighboring nodes. A node may also choose only to be a consumer, and\nthen it has to pay a tax, and the collected tax is evenly distributed to all\nthe service providers to remedy their cost. If nodes do not communicate with\neach other but make individual best-response decisions, the system will be\ntrapped in an inefficient situation of high tax level. In this work we\ninvestigate a decentralized local-consensus selection mechanism, according to\nwhich nodes in need of service recommend their neighbors of highest local\nimpact as candidate servers, and a node may become a server only if all its\nnon-server neighbors give their assent. We demonstrate that this\nlocal-consensus mechanism, although only involving information exchange among\nneighboring nodes, leads to socially efficient solutions with tax level\napproaching the lowest possible value. Our results may help in understanding\nand improving collective problem-solving in various networked social systems\nand robotic systems.\n", "  Magnetism is a key driving force controlling several thermodynamic and\nkinetic properties of Fe-Cr systems. We present a newly-developed TB model for\nFe-Cr, where magnetism is treated beyond the usual collinear approcimation. A\nmajor advantage of this model consists in a rather simple fitting procedure. In\nparticular, no specific properties of the binary system is explicitly required\nin the fitting database. The present model is proved to be accurate and highly\ntransfer-able for electronic, magnetic and energetic properties of a large\nvariety of structural and chemical environments: surfaces, interfaces, embedded\nclusters, and the whole compositional range of the binary alloy. The occurence\nof non-collinear magnetic configurations caused by magnetic frustrations is\nsuccessfully predicted. The present TB approach can apply for other binary\nmagnetic transition-metal alloys. It is expected to be particularly promissing\nif the size difference between the alloying elements is rather small and the\nelectronic properties prevail.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the inverse problem for a mixed Li\\'enard type\nnonlinear oscillator equation $\\ddot{x}+f(x)\\dot{x}^2+g(x)\\dot{x}+h(x)=0$,\nwhere $f(x),\\,g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are arbitrary functions of $x$. Very recently,\nwe have reported the Lie point symmetries of this equation. By exploiting the\ninterconnection between Jacobi last multiplier, Lie point symmetries and\nPrelle-Singer procedure we construct a time independent integral for the case\nexhibiting maximal symmetry from which we identify the associated conservative\nnon-standard Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions. The classical dynamics of\nthe nonlinear oscillator is also discussed and certain special properties\nincluding isochronous oscillations are brought out.\n", "  The organic salt $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ is considered a model system\nfor metal-insulator transition due to electronic charge ordering at $T_{\\rm\nCO}=135$~K. The optical properties obtained from polarized reflection\nmeasurements above and below $T_{\\rm CO}$ can be well described by calculations\nbased on first-principle density-functional theory (DFT). We discuss the effect\nof electronic correlations on the metal-insulator transition.\n", "  To consider a contribution of the spin-orbit interaction in the extraordinary\nwave spectrum we derive a generalization of the separate spin evolution quantum\nhydrodynamics. Applying corresponding nonlinear Pauli equation we include Fermi\nspin current contribution in the spin evolution. We find that the spectrum of\nextraordinary waves consists of three branches: two of them are well-known\nextraordinary waves and the third one is the spin-electron acoustic wave\n(SEAW). Earlier SEAWs have been considered in the electrostatic limit. Here we\ninclude the electromagnetic effects in their spectrum at the propagation\nperpendicular to the external magnetic field. We find that the SEAW spectrum\nconsiderably changes at the account of transverse part of electric field. We\nobtain that the separate spin evolution modifies spectrum of the well-known\nextraordinary waves either. A change of the extraordinary wave spectrum due to\nthe spin-orbit interaction is obtained as well.\n", "  We study semiclassical resonances generated by homoclinic trapped sets.\nFirst, under some general assumptions, we prove that there is no resonance in a\nregion below the real axis. Then, we obtain a quantization rule and the\nasymptotic expansion of the resonances when there is a finite number of\nhomoclinic trajectories. The same kind of results is proved for homoclinic sets\nof maximal dimension. Next, we generalize to the case of\nhomoclinic/heteroclinic trajectories and we study the three bump case. In all\nthese settings, the resonances may either accumulate on curves or form clouds.\nWe also describe the corresponding resonant states.\n", "  In a floating water bridge the total radiation scattering of water stressed\nby a moderately strong electric field (1mV/nm) was compared to water without an\napplied electric field using X-ray and small angle neutron scattering.\nStructure refinement was carried out using the EPSR method and the TIP4P/2005\nwater model. These results did not reveal a significant difference in the local\nstatic structure of water however analysis of the simulation indicated that the\nmodeled local potential energy surface reveals a departure between electrically\nstressed and unstressed water. The observed differences show that the local\nenvironment is changed by the applied electric field although weak relative to\nthe intermolecular coulombic field. When discussing the results we show that\nthe current methods used to simulate the pair potentials are still insufficient\nto treat such non-equilibrium systems and further simulation techniques have to\nbe developed to properly reconstruct the microscopic dielectric relaxation\nprocess.\n", "  Four-dimensional spacetime, together with a natural generalisation to extra\ndimensions, is obtained through an analysis of the structures and symmetries\nderiving from possible arithmetic expressions for one-dimensional time. On\ntaking the infinitesimal limit this simple one-dimensional structure can be\nconsistently equated with a homogeneous form of arbitrary dimension possessing\nboth spacetime and more general symmetries. An extended 4-dimensional manifold,\nwith the associated spacetime symmetry, provides a natural breaking mechanism\nfor a higher-dimensional form and symmetry of time. It will be described how\nthis symmetry breaking leads to a series of distinct properties of the Standard\nModel of particle physics, deriving directly from the natural mathematical\ndevelopment of the theory.\n", "  We review our studies of spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects on\ncharged pion emission in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. These effects\nare found to consist in the electromagnetic {charge splitting} of pion directed\nflow as well as very large distortions in spectra and ratios of produced\ncharged particles. As it emerges from our analysis, they offer sensitivity to\nthe actual distance $d_E$ between the pion formation zone at freeze-out and the\nspectator matter. As a result, this gives a new possibility of studying the\nspace-time evolution of dense and hot matter created in the course of the\ncollision. Having established that $d_E$ traces the longitudinal evolution of\nthe system and therefore rapidly decreases as a function of pion rapidity, we\ninvestigate the latter finding in view of pion feed-over from intermediate\nresonance production. As a result we obtain a first estimate of the pion\ndecoupling time from EM effects which we compare to existing HBT data. We\nconclude that spectator-induced EM interactions can serve as a new tool for\nstudying the space-time characteristics and longitudinal evolution of the\nsystem.\n", "  The effect of an electron-hole puddle on the electrical transport when\ngoverned by snake states in a bipolar graphene structure is investigated. Using\nnumerical simulations we show that information on the size and position of the\nelectron-hole puddle can be obtained using the dependence of the conductance on\nmagnetic field and electron density of the gated region. The presence of the\nscatterer disrupts snake state transport which alters the conduction pattern.\nWe obtain a simple analytical formula that connects the position of the\nelectron-hole puddle with features observed in the conductance. Size of the\nelectron-hole puddle is estimated from the magnetic field and gate potential\nthat maximizes the effect of the puddle on the electrical transport.\n", "  Current understanding of thermal rectification asserts that the rectification\nratio (R), which measures the relative heat flux between two ends of a\nnanostructure, is determined by its geometric asymmetry. The higher the\nasymmetry, the higher the R. However, by using nonequilibrium molecular\ndynamics method we have calculated thermal transport in Si nanocones as an\nexample, the results show that such an understanding may be incorrect and R may\nnot increase monotonically with geometric asymmetry. Rather, R exhibits a sharp\nreverse when the vertex angle ({\\theta}) of the nanocone is approximately\n90{\\deg}. In other words, when {\\theta} > 90{\\deg}, R decreases, rather than\nincreasing. We show that this abnormal behavior is originated from a change in\nthe thermal transport mechanism. At small {\\theta}s, phonon transport is\ndominated by localized modes, especially for transport from tip to bottom. At\nlarge {\\theta}s, however, these localized modes disappear, leading to R\ndecrease.\n", "  In general relativity, an inertial frame can only be established in a small\nregion of spacetime, and a locally inertial frame is mathematically represented\nby a tetrad field in gravity. The tetrad field is not unique due to the freedom\nto perform a local Lorentz transformation in an inertial frame, and there\nexists freedom to choose the locally inertial frame at each spacetime. The\nlocal Lorentz transformations are known as non-Abelian gauge transformations\nfor the tetrad field, and to fix the gauge freedom, corresponding to the\nLorentz gauge $\\partial^\\mu\\mathcal{A}_\\mu=0$ and Coulomb gauge\n$\\partial^i\\mathcal{A}_i=0$ in electrodynamics, the Lorentz gauge and Coulomb\ngauge for the tetrad field are proposed in the present work. Moreover,\nproperties of the Lorentz gauge and Coulomb gauge for tetrad field are\ndiscussed, which show the similarities to those in electromagnetic field.\n", "  In a few years the Kepler and TESS missions will provide ultra-precise\nphotometry for thousands of RR Lyrae and hundreds of Cepheid stars. In the\nextended Kepler mission all targets are proposed in the Guest Observer (GO)\nProgram, while the TESS space telescope will work with full frame images and a\n~15-16th mag brightness limit with the possibility of short cadence\nmeasurements for a limited number of pre-selected objects. This paper\nhighlights some details of the enormous and important work of the target\nselection process made by the members of Working Group 7 (WG#7) of the Kepler\nand TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium.\n", "  Radio observations over the last two decades have provided evidence that\ndiffuse synchrotron emission in the form of megaparsec-scale radio halos in\ngalaxy clusters is likely tracing regions of the intracluster medium where\nrelativistic particles are accelerated during cluster mergers. In this paper we\npresent results of a survey of 14 galaxy clusters carried out with the\n7-element Karoo Array Telescope at 1.86 GHz, aimed to extend the current\nstudies of radio halo occurrence to systems with lower masses (M$_{\\rm 500} >\n4\\times10^{14}$ M${_\\odot}$). We found upper limits at the $0.6 - 1.9 \\times\n10^{24}$ Watt Hz$^{-1}$ level for $\\sim 50\\%$ of the sample, confirming that\nbright radio halos in less massive galaxy clusters are statistically rare.\n", "  Chitin is one of the most abundant biomaterials in nature, with 10^10 tons\nproduced annually as hierarchically organized nanofibril fillers to reinforce\nthe exoskeletons of arthropods. This green and cheap biomaterial has attracted\ngreat attention due to its potential application to reinforce biomedical\nmaterials. Despite that, its practical use is limited since the extraction of\nchitin nanofibrils requires surface modification involving harsh chemical\ntreatments, leading to difficulties in reproducing their natural prototypal\nhierarchical structure, i.e. chiral nematic phase. Here, we develop a chemical\netching-free approach using calcium ions, called natural way, to disintegrate\nthe chitin nanofibrils while keeping the essential moiety for the\nself-assembly, ultimately resulting in the reproduction of chitins natural\nchiral structure in a polymeric matrix. This chiral chitin nanostructure\nexceptionally toughens the composite. Our resultant chiral nematic phase of\nchitin materials can contribute to the understanding and use of the reinforcing\nstrategy in nature.\n", "  Let $M$ denote a finite volume, non-compact Riemann surface without elliptic\npoints, and let $B$ denote the Lax-Phillips scattering operator. Using the\nsuperzeta function approach due to Voros, we define a Hurwitz-type zeta\nfunction $\\zeta^{\\pm}_{B}(s,z)$ constructed from the resonances associated to\n$zI -[ (1/2)I \\pm B]$. We prove the meromorphic continuation in $s$ of\n$\\zeta^{\\pm}_{B}(s,z)$ and, using the special value at $s=0$, define a\ndeterminant of the operators $zI -[ (1/2)I \\pm B]$. We obtain expressions for\nSelberg's zeta function and the determinant of the scattering matrix in terms\nof the operator determinants.\n", "  We present the mass excesses of 59-64Cr, obtained from recent time-of-flight\nnuclear mass measurements at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory\nat Michigan State University. The mass of 64Cr is determined for the first\ntime, with an atomic mass excess of -33.48(44) MeV. We find a significantly\ndifferent two-neutron separation energy S2n trend for neutron-rich isotopes of\nchromium, removing the previously observed enhancement in binding at N=38.\nAdditionally, we extend the S2n trend for chromium to N=40, revealing behavior\nconsistent with the previously identified island of inversion in this region.\nWe compare our results to state-of-the-art shell-model calculations performed\nwith a modified Lenzi-Nowacki-Poves-Sieja interaction in the fp shell,\nincluding the g9/2 and d5/2 orbits for the neutron valence space. We employ our\nresult for the mass of 64Cr in accreted neutron star crust network calculations\nand find a reduction in the strength and depth of electron-capture heating from\nthe A=64 isobaric chain, resulting in a cooler than expected accreted neutron\nstar crust. This reduced heating is found to be due to the >1-MeV reduction in\nbinding for 64Cr with respect to values from commonly used global mass models.\n", "  Cosmological solutions derived by Nariai and Tomita (1971) and by Starobinsky\n(1980) are compared, and it is shown that the former derived de Sitter\nexpansion in the R^2 modified gravity (without cosmological constant) at the\nearliest stage, and nine years later the latter derived the well-known\ninflationary solution. Next the property of their simplified models is\ndescribed using the method of conformal transformations, and how the inflation\narises and the singularity is avoided is shown. Finally the initial and final\nstates of the inflation are discussed.\n", "  Plasmon drag effect is studied theoretically and experimentally in gold films\nwith a sine-wave height profile. Numerical simulations based on the modified\nelectromagnetic momentum loss approach are shown to correctly describe the\nphotoinduced voltage associated with propagating surface plasmon polaritons.\nDirect proportionality of energy and momentum transfer in interactions of\nplasmons and free electrons in metal is proven to be valid for surfaces with\nrelatively low height modulation amplitudes. The effect is also discussed in\nframes of an equivalent circuit model, which can provide qualitative\ndescription for surfaces with random roughness.\n", "  During the last fifteen years, multiferroic (MF) research communities have\nbeen searching for an alternative room temperature MF material with large\nmagnetoelectric (ME) coupling for possible applications in high density\nelectronic components, low heat dissipation memory and logic devices. We have\nstudied Pb(Zr0.20Ti0.80)0.70Pd0.30O3-{\\delta} (PZTP30) system with an unusually\nlarge (30%) palladium occupancy in B site of PZT. This material exhibited a\ngiant ME coupling coefficient ~0.36 mV/cm.Oe. Interestingly, this is the first\ntime any room temperature single phase compound that showed ME trends, and\nmagnitude similar to those in the well established mechanical strain-mediated\nferroelectric and ferromagnetic composites; the latter ones are already in the\ncommercial stage as nT/pT magnetic field sensors due to their large ME values.\nThe presence of Pd in PZTP30 has been confirmed by XPS and XRF studies and\nassigned with related binding energies of Pd+2 and Pd+4 ions as 336.37 eV,\n342.9 eV, and 337.53 eV, 343.43 eV, respectively, which may be the origin of\nroom temperature magnetism in Pd substituted PZT ceramics. A sharp first order\nferroelectric phase transition was observed at ~569 K (+/-5 K) that is\nconfirmed from dielectric, Raman, and thermal analysis. Both ferromagnetic and\nferroelectric orderings with large ME coupling were found above room\ntemperature, a significant step forward in the development of single phase ME\nmaterial with enhanced functionalities.\n", "  We study a 1D semilinear wave equation modeling the dynamic of an elastic\nstring interacting with a rigid substrate through an adhesive layer. The\nconstitutive law of the adhesive material is assumed elastic up to a finite\ncritical state, beyond such a value the stress discontinuously drops to zero.\nTherefore the semilinear equation is characterized by a source term presenting\njump discontinuity. Well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem of\nNeumann type, as well as qualitative properties of the solutions are studied\nand the evolution of different initial conditions are numerically investigated.\n", "  The growth of Fe nanoclusters on the Ge(001) surface has been studied using\nlowtemperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. STM results indicate that Fe nucleates on the\nGe(001) surface, forming wellordered nanoclusters of uniform size. Depending on\nthe preparation conditions, two types of nanoclusters were observed having\neither four or sixteen Fe atoms within a nanocluster. The results were\nconfirmed by DFT calculations. Annealing the nanoclusters at 420 K leads to the\nformation of nanorow structures, due to cluster mobility at such temperature.\nThe Fe nanoclusters and nanorow structures formed on the Ge(001) surface show a\nsuperparamagnetic behaviour as measured by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism.\n", "  We discuss why the scalar-isoscalar resonance $f_{0}(500)$ should in practice\nnot be included in thermal models describing the freeze-out of heavy-ion\ncollisions. Its contribution into pion multiplicities is in principle relevant\nbecause it is light and it decays only into pions. However, it is cancelled to\na very good numerical precision by the non-resonant scalar-isotensor repulsion\namong pions. Our approach is an application of a well-known theorem relating\nspectral function to phase shifts. The numerical results are solely based on\npion-pion scattering data and thus model independent.\n", "  In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing photonic\ntemperature sensors such as the Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) as an alternative to\nresistance thermometry. In this study we examine the thermal response of FBGs\nover the temperature range of 233 K to 393 K. We demonstrate, in a hermetically\nsealed dry Argon environment, that FBG devices show a quadratic dependence on\ntemperature with expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of ~500 mK. Our measurements\nindicate that the combined measurement uncertainty is dominated by uncertainty\nin determining the peak center fitting and by thermal aging of polyimide coated\nfibers.\n", "  This chapter presents a brief overview of photonic sensor and standards\ndevelopment that is currently undergoing in the thermodynamic metrology group\nat NIST in the areas of temperature, pressure, vacuum and time-resolved\npressure measurements.\n", "  We present a class of new relativistic solutions with anisotropic fluid for\ncompact stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. The interior space-time geometry\nconsidered here for compact objects are described by parameters namely,\n$\\lambda$, $k$, $A$, $R$ and $n$. The values of the geometrical parameters are\ndetermined here for obtaining a class of physically viable stellar models. The\nenergy-density, radial pressure and tangential pressure are finite and positive\ninside the anisotropic stars. Considering some stars of known mass we present\nstellar models which describe compact astrophysical objects with nuclear\ndensity.\n", "  MetalWorking Fluids (MWFs) are widely used to cool and lubricate machines and\ntools. By far, the most common MWFs are oil-in-water emulsions with oil\nconcentration (C oil) in the range from 1% to 10%, depending on type of oil,\nmaterial to be worked, etc. In order to optimize emulsion and machine\nperformance, as well as for good waste policy, the right value of C oil should\nbe kept (approximately) constant during the MWF's lifecycle to compensate\ninevitable changes due to water evaporation, bacterial attack, oil adhesion to\nmetal parts, etc.. This, however, requires periodic measurements, often skipped\nbecause they require unhandy operations and produce inaccurate results. In this\ncontext, a new system is presented that is based on the falling ball principle,\nnormally used for viscosity measurements, shown to be suitable also for\naccurate C oil measurements. In our system, the transit time of the sphere\nwithin the instrument is determined by means of inductive proximity sensors, a\nPT100 sensor is used for temperature whose effects on C oil are accounted for\nby means of an ad-hoc algorithm. A battery-operated electronic board has been\ndesigned that allows rapid and user-friendly \" in-situ \" measurements and a\nprototype of an whole portable and automatic instrument, suitable for in-situ\nmeasurements, has been fabricated.\n", "  We study in detail the quasinormal modes of linear gravitational\nperturbations of plane-symmetric anti-de Sitter black holes. The wave equations\nare obtained by means of the Newman-Penrose formalism and the Chandrasekhar\ntransformation theory. We show that oscillatory modes decay exponentially with\ntime such that these black holes are stable against gravitational\nperturbations. Our numerical results show that in the large (small) black hole\nregime the frequencies of the ordinary quasinormal modes are proportional to\nthe horizon radius $r_{+}$ (wave number $k$). The frequency of the purely\ndamped mode is very close to the algebraically special frequency in the small\nhorizon limit, and goes as $ik^{2}/3r_{+}$ in the opposite limit. This result\nis confirmed by an analytical method based on the power series expansion of the\nfrequency in terms of the horizon radius. The same procedure applied to the\nSchwarzschild anti-de Sitter spacetime proves that the purely damped frequency\ngoes as $i(l-1)(l+2)/3r_{+}$, where $l$ is the quantum number characterizing\nthe angular distribution. Finally, we study the limit of high overtones and\nfind that the frequencies become evenly spaced in this regime. The spacing of\nthe frequency per unit horizon radius seems to be a universal quantity, in the\nsense that it is independent of the wave number, perturbation parity and black\nhole size.\n"]}
