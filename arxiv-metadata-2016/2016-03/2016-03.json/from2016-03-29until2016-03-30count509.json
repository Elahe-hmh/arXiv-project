results\nin a static configuration with a density of ~64%. The ubiquity of random close\npacking (RCP) rather than the optimal crystalline array at 74% begs the\nquestion of the physical law behind this empirically deduced state. Indeed,\nthere is no signature of any macroscopic quantity with a discontinuity\nassociated with the observed packing limit. Here we show that RCP can be\ninterpreted as a manifestation of a thermodynamic singularity, which defines it\nas the \"freezing point\" in a first-order phase transition between ordered and\ndisordered packing phases. Despite the athermal nature of granular matter, we\nshow the thermodynamic character of the transition in that it is accompanied by\nsharp discontinuities in volume and entropy. This occurs at a critical\ncompactivity, which is the intensive variable that plays the role of\ntemperature in granular matter. Our results predict the experimental conditions\nnecessary for the formation of a jammed crystal by calculating an analogue of\nthe \"entropy of fusion\". This approach is useful since it maps\nout-of-equilibrium problems in complex systems onto simpler established\nframeworks in statistical mechanics.\n", "  The distribution of the population of cities has attracted a great deal of\nattention, in part because it sharply constrains models of local growth.\nHowever, to this day, there is no consensus on the distribution below the very\nupper tail, because available data need to rely on the \"legal\" rather than\n\"economic\" definition of cities for medium and small cities. To remedy this\ndifficulty, in this work we construct cities \"from the bottom up\" by clustering\npopulated areas obtained from high-resolution data. This method allows us to\ninvestigate the population and area of cities for urban agglomerations of all\nsizes using clustering methods from percolation theory. We find that Zipf's law\n(a power law with exponent close to 1) for population holds for cities as small\nas 12,000 inhabitants in the USA and 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain. In\naddition the distribution of city areas is also close to a Zipf's law. We\nprovide a parsimonious model with endogenous city area that is consistent with\nthose findings.\n", "  The application of concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics to\nout-of-equilibrium systems has a long history of describing diverse systems\nranging from glasses to granular materials. For dissipative jammed systems--\nparticulate grains or droplets-- a key concept is to replace the energy\nensemble describing conservative systems by the volume-stress ensemble. Here,\nwe test the applicability of the volume-stress ensemble to describe the jamming\ntransition by comparing the jammed configurations obtained by dynamics with\nthose averaged over the ensemble as a probe of ergodicity. Agreement between\nboth methods suggests the idea of \"thermalization\" at a given angoricity and\ncompactivity. We elucidate the thermodynamic order of the jamming transition by\nshowing the absence of critical fluctuations in static observables like\npressure and volume. The approach allows to calculate observables such as the\nentropy, volume, pressure, coordination number and distribution of forces to\ncharacterize the scaling laws near the jamming transition from a statistical\nmechanics viewpoint.\n", "  We review a recently proposed theory of random packings. We describe the\nvolume fluctuations in jammed matter through a volume function, amenable to\nanalytical and numerical calculations. We combine an extended statistical\nmechanics approach 'a la Edwards' (where the role traditionally played by the\nenergy and temperature in thermal systems is substituted by the volume and\ncompactivity) with a constraint on mechanical stability imposed by the\nisostatic condition. We show how such approaches can bring results that can be\ncompared to experiments and allow for an exploitation of the statistical\nmechanics framework. The key result is the use of a relation between the local\nVoronoi volume of the constituent grains and the number of neighbors in contact\nthat permits a simple combination of the two approaches to develop a theory of\nrandom packings. We predict the density of random loose packing (RLP) and\nrandom close packing (RCP) in close agreement with experiments and develop a\nphase diagram of jammed matter that provides a unifying view of the disordered\nhard sphere packing problem and further shedding light on a diverse spectrum of\ndata, including the RLP state. Theoretical results are well reproduced by\nnumerical simulations that confirm the essential role played by friction in\ndetermining both the RLP and RCP limits. Finally we present an extended\ndiscussion on the existence of geometrical and mechanical coordination numbers\nand how to measure both quantities in experiments and computer simulations.\n", "  Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope observations of the flat spectrum radio\nquasar 3C~454.3 show a spectral-index change $\\Delta \\Gamma \\cong 1.2\\pm 0.3$\nat break energy $E_{br} \\approx 2.4\\pm0.3$ GeV. Such a sharp break is\ninconsistent with a cooling electron distribution and is poorly fit with a\nsynchrotron self-Compton model. We show that a combination of two components,\nnamely the Compton-scattered disk and broad-line region (BLR) radiations,\nexplains this spectral break and gives a good fit to the quasi-simultaneous\nradio, optical/UV, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution\nobserved in 2008 August. A sharp break can be produced independent of the\nemitting region's distance from the central black hole if the BLR has a\ngradient in density $\\propto R^{-2}$, consistent with a wind model for the BLR.\n", "  The aim of this tutorial is to analyze the equilibrium properties of some\nsimple but widely used quantum systems. The canonical ensemble is used to\nevaluate the required properties here.\n", "  In this paper, we propose the SPR (sparse phase retrieval) method, which is a\nnew phase retrieval method for coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI).\nConventional phase retrieval methods effectively solve the problem for high\nsignal-to-noise ratio measurements, but would not be sufficient for single\nbiomolecular imaging which is expected to be realized with femto-second x-ray\nfree electron laser pulses. The SPR method is based on the Bayesian statistics.\nIt does not need to set the object boundary constraint that is required by the\ncommonly used hybrid input-output (HIO) method, instead a prior distribution is\ndefined with an exponential distribution and used for the estimation.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reconstructs the\nelectron density under a noisy condition even some central pixels are masked.\n", "  This paper discusses a possible resolution of the nonobjectivity-nonlocality\ndilemma in quantum mechanics in 'the light of experimental tests of the Bell\ninequality for two entangled photons and a Bell-like inequality for a single\nneutron. My conclusion is that these experiments show that quantum mechanics is\nnonobjective: that is, the values of physical observables cannot be assigned to\na system before measurement. Bell's assumption of nonlocality has to be\nrejected as having no direct experimental confirmation, at least thus far. I\nalso consider the relationships between nonobjectivity and contextuality.\nSpecifically, I analyze the impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem on the problem\nof contextuality of quantum observables. I argue that, just as von Neumann's\n\"no-go\" theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem is based on assumptions that do not\ncorrespond to the real physical situation. Finally, I present a theory of\nmeasurement based on a classical, purely wave model (pre-quantum classical\nstatistical field theory), a model that reproduces quantum probabilities. In\nthis model continuous fields are transformed into discrete clicks of detectors.\nWhile this model is classical, it is nonobjective. In this case, nonobjectivity\nis the result of the dependence of experimental outcomes on the context of\nmeasurement, in accordance with Bohr's view.\n", "  We develop a general optimization strategy for performing a chosen unitary or\nnon-unitary task on an open quantum system. The goal is to design a controlled\ntime-dependent system Hamiltonian by variationally minimizing or maximizing a\nchosen function of the system state, which quantifies the task success (score),\nsuch as fidelity, purity, or entanglement. If the time-dependence of the system\nHamiltonian is fast enough to be comparable or shorter than the response-time\nof the bath, then the resulting non-Markovian dynamics is shown to optimize the\nchosen task score to second order in the coupling to the bath. This strategy\ncan protect a desired unitary system evolution from bath-induced decoherence,\nbut ca also take advantage of the system-bath coupling so as to realize a\ndesired non-unitary effect on the system.\n", "  We perform an exact localization calculation for the expectation values of\nWilson-'t Hooft line operators in N=2 gauge theories on S^1xR^3. The\nexpectation values are naturally expressed in terms of the complexified\nFenchel-Nielsen coordinates, and form a quantum mechanically deformed algebra\nof functions on the associated Hitchin moduli space by Moyal multiplication. We\npropose that these expectation values are the Weyl transform of the Verlinde\noperators, which act on Liouville/Toda conformal blocks as difference\noperators. We demonstrate our proposal explicitly in SU(N) examples.\n", "  This is the last of three papers on Conformal General Relativity (CGR), which\nascribes inflation to a spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry, followed\nby a sudden energy transfer from geometry to matter identified as big bang.\nThis process is driven by a conformal-invariant, unitarity-preserving\ninteraction of two Nambu-Goldstone fields: a ghost scalar field $\\sigma$,\ninvested with geometric meaning, and a physical scalar field $\\varphi$ behaving\nlike a Higgs field of varying mass. The big bang generates a bulk of Higgs\nbosons at temperature $T_B\\simeq 141$ GeV, after which the universe evolves\nadiabatically while the Higgs bosons decay into Standard-Model particles and\nthe magnitude of the gravitational coupling constant decreases. The process\nends when the $\\sigma$-$\\varphi$ interaction potential vanishes, the amplitudes\nof these fields converge to their expectation values in a final stable vacuum\nand the Higgs-boson mass converges to about 126 GeV. The main aspects of this\nphenomenology are qualitatively described and accurately exemplified by\nnumerical simulations. The combination of CGR gravitational equation at time\nzero with entropy conservation equation results in striking predictions. The\nbest fit to astronomic data is obtained from only standard Higgs boson\nparameters and a universe age of 19.5 Gyr. The cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda\\simeq 1.35\\times 10^{-35}$s$^{-2}$, the scale factor across inflation\n$Z\\simeq 4.54\\times 10^{27}$, and the lower bound of the power spectrum of\ncosmic background anisotropies $W_{min}\\!\\simeq 37.5\\,\\mu$K$^2$ are thus\npredicted.\n", "  Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, obesity and certain forms of cancer\nhave been increasing in many countries at alarming levels. A difficulty in the\nconception of policies to reverse these trends is the identification of the\ndrivers behind the global epidemics. Here, we implement a spatial spreading\nanalysis to investigate whether diabetes, obesity and cancer show spatial\ncorrelations revealing the effect of collective and global factors acting above\nindividual choices. We adapt a theoretical framework for critical physical\nsystems displaying collective behavior to decipher the laws of spatial\nspreading of diseases. We find a regularity in the spatial fluctuations of\ntheir prevalence revealed by a pattern of scale-free long-range correlations.\nThe fluctuations are anomalous, deviating in a fundamental way from the weaker\ncorrelations found in the underlying population distribution. This collective\nbehavior indicates that the spreading dynamics of obesity, diabetes and some\nforms of cancer like lung cancer are analogous to a critical point of\nfluctuations, just as a physical system in a second-order phase transition.\nAccording to this notion, individual interactions and habits may have\nnegligible influence in shaping the global patterns of spreading. Thus, obesity\nturns out to be a global problem where local details are of little importance.\nInterestingly, we find the same critical fluctuations in obesity and diabetes,\nand in the activities of economic sectors associated with food production such\nas supermarkets, food and beverage stores--- which cluster in a different\nuniversality class than other generic sectors of the economy. These results\nmotivate future interventions to investigate the causality of this relation\nproviding guidance for the implementation of preventive health policies.\n", "  There are two main approaches to non-equlibrium statistical mechanics: one\nusing stochastic processes and the other using dynamical systems. To model the\ndynamics during inflation one usually adopts a stochastic description, which is\nknown to suffer from serious conceptual problems. To overcome the problems\nand/or to gain more insight, we develop a dynamical systems approach. A key\nassumption that goes into analysis is the chaotic hypothesis, which is a\nnatural generalization of the ergodic hypothesis to non-Hamiltonian systems.\nThe unfamiliar feature for gravitational systems is that the local phase space\ntrajectories can either reproduce or escape due to the presence of cosmological\nand black hole horizons. We argue that the effect of horizons can be studied\nusing dynamical systems and apply the so-called thermodynamic formalism to\nderive the equilibrium (or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measure given by a variational\nprinciple. We show that the only physical measure is not the Liouville measure\n(i.e. no entropy problem), but the equilibrium measure (i.e. no measure\nproblem) defined over local trajectories (i.e. no problem of observables) and\nsupported on only infinite trajectories (i.e. no problem of initial\nconditions). Phenomenological aspects of the fluctuation theorem are discussed.\n", "  We study the topological configurations of the two-component condensates of\nbosons with the $3$D $\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot \\vec{p}$ Weyl-type spin-orbit coupling\nsubject to a harmonic trapping potential. The topology of the condensate\nwavefunctions manifests in the quaternionic representation. In comparison to\nthe $U(1)$ complex phase, the quaternionic phase manifold is $S^3$ and the spin\norientations form the $S^2$ Bloch sphere through the 1st Hopf mapping. The\nspatial distributions of the quaternionic phases exhibit the 3D skyrmion\nconfigurations, and the spin distributions possess non-trivial Hopf invariants.\nSpin textures evolve from the concentric distributions at the weak spin-orbit\ncoupling regime to the rotation symmetry breaking patterns at the intermediate\nspin-orbit coupling regime. In the strong spin-orbit coupling regime, the\nsingle-particle spectra exhibit the Landau-level type quantization. In this\nregime, the three-dimensional skyrmion lattice structures are formed when\ninteractions are below the energy scale of Landau level mixings. Sufficiently\nstrong interactions can change condensates into spin-polarized plane-wave\nstates, or, superpositions of two plane-waves exhibiting helical spin spirals.\n", "  We discuss the problem of interpretation of the wave function. The latest\nversion of the V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation is presented. It differs essentially\nfrom the original V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation (2001). The main distinguishing\nfeature of the present V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation is the combination of realism\non the subquantum level with nonobjectivity of quantum observables (i.e.,\nimpossibility to assign their values before measurements). Hence, realism is\ndestroyed by detectors transforming continuous subquantum reality into discrete\nevents, clicks of detectors. The V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation-2012 is fundamentally\ncontextual in the sense that the value of an observable depends on measurement\ncontext. This is contextuality in Bohr's sense. It is more general than Bell's\ncontextuality based on joint measurements of compatible observables.\n", "  The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a superconducting state\nwith non-zero total momentum Cooper pairs in a strong magnetic field, was\npredicted more than 50 years ago and now becomes an important concept in many\nbranches of physics. However, no unambiguous experimental evidences for the\nexistence of FFLO phases have been observed yet. Recently, spin-imbalanced\nultracold degenerate Fermi gases have emerged as a new powerful platform for\nthe observation of FFLO phases due to their high experimental controllability\nand the lack of disorder. However, in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases\nwhere the FFLO phases can be described within the simple mean field theory, the\nparameter region for the FFLO phases is too small to be observed in\nexperiments. Recently, we showed that the Rashba type spin-orbit coupling and\nin-plane Zeeman field in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases provide a\nmore efficient way to create the FFLO phase because (1) the parameter region\nfor the FFLO phase is greatly enlarged in the phase diagram and (2) the FFLO\nphase is stabilized due to the enhanced energy difference between FFLO phase\nand conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase. In this work we\ninvestigate the FFLO phase in two dimensional spin-orbit coupled degenerate\nFermi gases using the mean field theory, with special concerns on the physical\norigin of the FFLO state. The basic properties of the FFLO phase are discussed\nand the phase diagram is obtained at zero temperature. The symmetry of\ndifferent quantum phases is examined, which provide important basis for the\nexperimental observation of FFLO phases using the time-of-flight imaging.\n", "  We develop further a kinetic theory of strings and derive a transport\nequation for a network of cosmic strings with Nambu-Goto evolution,\ninteractions and background gravitational effects taken into account. We prove\nan H-theorem and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a thermodynamic\nequilibrium. At the lowest order the equilibrium is estimated by the von\nMises-Fisher distributions parametrized by mean directions and dispersions of\nthe right- and left-moving tangent vectors. Under assumption of a local\nequilibrium we derive a complete set of hydrodynamic equations that govern the\nevolution of strings on large scales. We also argue that on small scales the\nassumption of a local equilibrium would break down, and non-equilibrium steady\nstates, described by the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen distributions, should be used\ninstead.\n", "  We investigate the structure of crystalline particle arrays on constant mean\ncurvature (CMC) surfaces of revolution. Such curved crystals have been realized\nphysically by creating charge-stabilized colloidal arrays on liquid capillary\nbridges. CMC surfaces of revolution, classified by Charles Delaunay in 1841,\ninclude the 2-sphere, the cylinder, the vanishing mean curvature catenoid (a\nminimal surface) and the richer and less investigated unduloid and nodoid. We\ndetermine numerically candidate ground state configurations for 1000 point-like\nparticles interacting with a pairwise-repulsive dipole-dipole interaction\npotential. We mimic stretching of capillary bridges by determining the\nequilibrium configurations of particles arrayed on a sequence of Delaunay\nsurfaces obtained by increasing or decreasing the height at constant volume\nstarting from a given initial surface, either a fat cylinder or a square\ncylinder. In this case the stretching process takes one through a complicated\nsequence of Delaunay surfaces each with different geometrical parameters\nincluding the aspect ratio, mean curvature and maximal Gaussian curvature.\nUnduloids, catenoids and nodoids all appear in this process. Defect motifs in\nthe ground state evolve from dislocations at the boundary to dislocations in\nthe interior to pleats and scars in the interior and then isolated 7-fold\ndisclinations in the interior as the capillary bridge narrows at the waist\n(equator) and the maximal (negative) Gaussian curvature grows. We also check\ntheoretical predictions that the isolated disclinations are present in the\nground state when the surface contains a geodesic disc with integrated Gaussian\ncurvature exceeding -pi/3. Finally we explore minimal energy configurations on\nsets of slices of a given Delaunay surface and obtain configurations and defect\nmotifs consistent with those seen in stretching.\n", "  We present the analysis of 26 nights of V and I time-series observations from\n2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099). We used our data to\nsearch for variable stars in this cluster and refine the periods of known\nvariables; we then used our variable star light curves to derive values for the\ncluster's parameters. We used difference image analysis to reduce our data to\nobtain high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the\ncluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light curves of\nRR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible. We also derive an\nestimate for the age of the cluster by fitting theoretical isochrones to our\ncolour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as\nvariables, we find that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR\nLyrae variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the\nliterature. We also detect four other new variables, including an eclipsing\nblue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts to a total number\nof confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform Fourier decomposition of\nthe light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to derive cluster parameters using\nempirical relations. We find a cluster metallicity [Fe/H]_ZW=-2.01 +- 0.04, or\n[Fe/H]_UVES=-2.11 +- 0.06, and a distance of 8.32 +- 0.20 kpc (using RR0\nvariables), 8.10 kpc (using one RR1 variable), and 8.35 +- 0.42 kpc (using our\nSX Phoenicis star detection in M 30). Fitting isochrones to the CMD, we\nestimate an age of 13.0 +- 1.0 Gyr for M 30.\n", "  We investigate a phenomenon of creation of excitations in the homogenous\nBose-Einstein condensate due to an impurity moving with a constant velocity. A\nsimple model is considered to take into account dynamical effects due to\nmotions of the impurity. Based on this model, we show that there can be a\nfinite amount of excitations created even if velocity of the impurity is below\nLandau's critical velocity. We also show that the total number of excitations\nscales differently for large time across the speed of sound. Thus, our result\ndictates the critical behavior across Landau's one and validates Landau's\ninstitution to the problem. We discuss how Landau's critical velocity emerges\nand its validity within our model.\n", "  Our current description of the large-scale Universe is now known with a\nprecision undreamt of a generation ago. Within the simple standard cosmological\nmodel only six basic parameters are required. The usual parameter set includes\nquantities most directly probed by the cosmic microwave background, but the\nnature of these quantities is somewhat esoteric. However, many more numbers can\nbe derived that quantify various aspects of our Universe. Using constraints\nfrom the Planck satellite, in combination with other data sets, we explore\nseveral such quantities, highlighting some specific examples.\n", "  We study the dynamics of self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\nloaded in deep optical lattices with Gaussian initial conditions, when the\ndynamics is well described by the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation\n(DNLS). In the literature an approximate dynamical phase diagram based on a\nvariational approach was introduced to distinguish different dynamical regimes:\ndiffusion, self-trapping and moving breathers. However, we find that the actual\nDNLS dynamics shows a completely different diagram than the variational\nprediction. We numerically calculate a detailed dynamical phase diagram\naccurately describing the different dynamical regimes. It exhibits a complex\nstructure which can readily be tested in current experiments in BECs in optical\nlattices and in optical waveguide arrays. Moreover, we derive an explicit\ntheoretical estimate for the transition to self-trapping in excellent agreement\nwith our numerical findings, which may be a valuable guide as well for future\nstudies on a quantum dynamical phase diagram based on the Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian.\n", "  We consider a covariant approach to coarse-graining a network of interacting\nNambu-Goto strings. A transport equation is constructed for a spatially flat\nFriedmann universe. In Minkowski space and with no spatial dependence this\nmodel agrees with a previous model. Thus it likewise converges to an\nequilibrium with a factorizability property. We present an argument that this\nproperty does not depend on a `string chaos' assumption on the correlations\nbetween strings. And in contrast to the earlier model, this transport equation\nagrees with conservation equations for a fluid of strings derived from a\ndifferent perspective.\n", "  We use both simulated and real quasar light curves to explore modeling\nphotometric reverberation-mapping (RM) data as a stochastic process. We do this\nusing modifications to our previously developed RM method based on modeling\nquasar variability as a damped random walk. We consider the feasibility of one\nand two-band photometric RM and compare the results with those fr om\nspectroscopic RM. We find that our method for two-band photometric RM can be\ncompetitive with spectroscopic RM only for strong (large equivalent width)\nlines like Halpha and Hbeta, and that the one-band method is also feasible, but\nrequires very high-precision photometry. We fail to robustly detect Halpha lags\nin single-band quasar light curves from OGLE-III and IV despite the outstanding\ncadence and time span of the data, on account of photometric uncertainties in\nthe range 0.02-0.04 mag. Simulations suggest that success could be achieved if\nthe photometric uncertainties were of order 0.01 mag. Single-band RM for all\nlines and two-band RM for lower equivalent width lines are likely only feasible\nfor statistical estimate s of mean lags for large samples of AGN of similar\nproperties (e.g., luminosity) rather than for individual quasars. Our approach\nis directly applicable to the time-domain programs within ongoing and future\nwide-field imaging surveys, and could provide robust lag measurements for an\nunprecedented number of systems.\n", "  The calculation of ground-state energies of physical systems can be\nformalised as the k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is the natural quantum\nanalogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems. One way of making the\nproblem more physically meaningful is to restrict the Hamiltonian in question\nby picking its terms from a fixed set S. Examples of such special cases are the\nHeisenberg and Ising models from condensed-matter physics.\n  In this work we characterise the complexity of this problem for all 2-local\nqubit Hamiltonians. Depending on the subset S, the problem falls into one of\nthe following categories: in P; NP-complete; polynomial-time equivalent to the\nIsing model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. The third of\nthese classes has been shown to be StoqMA-complete by Bravyi and Hastings. The\ncharacterisation holds even if S does not contain any 1-local terms; for\nexample, we prove for the first time QMA-completeness of the Heisenberg and XY\ninteractions in this setting. If S is assumed to contain all 1-local terms,\nwhich is the setting considered by previous work, we have a characterisation\nthat goes beyond 2-local interactions: for any constant k, all k-local qubit\nHamiltonians whose terms are picked from a fixed set S correspond to problems\neither in P; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse\nmagnetic fields; or QMA-complete.\n  These results are a quantum analogue of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for\nboolean constraint satisfaction problems.\n", "  Deep level transient spectroscopy shows that defects created by alpha\nirradiation of germanium are annealed by low energy plasma ions up to a depth\nof several thousand lattice units. The plasma ions have energies of 2-8eV and\ntherefore can deliver energies of the order of a few eV to the germanium atoms.\nThe most abundant defect is identified as the E-center, a complex of the dopant\nantimony and a vacancy with and annealing energy of 1.3eV as determined by our\nmeasurements. The inductively coupled plasma has a very low density and a very\nlow flux of ions. This implies that the ion impacts are almost isolated both in\ntime and at the surface of the semiconductor. We conclude that energy of the\norder of an eV is able to travel a large distance in germanium in a localized\nway and is delivered to the defects effectively. The most likely candidates are\nvibrational nonlinear wave packets known as intrinsic localized modes, which\nexist for a limited range of energies. This property is coherent with the fact\nthat more energetic ions are less efficient at producing the annealing effect.\n", "  We revisit the well-known and much studied Riesz product representation of\nthe Thue-Morse diffraction measure, which is also the maximal spectral measure\nfor the corresponding dynamical spectrum in the complement of the pure point\npart. The known scaling relations are summarised, and some new findings are\nexplained.\n", "  We investigate the parity nonconservation (PNC) effect in the dielectronic\nrecombination (DR) of a polarized electron with a heavy He-like ion into\ndoubly-excited $((1s 2p_{1/2})_{0} n{\\kappa})_{1/2}$ and $\\left(\\left(1s\n2s\\right)_{0} n{\\kappa}\\right)_{1/2}$ states of Li-like ion. We determine the\nnuclear charge number $Z$ for which these opposite-parity levels are near to\ncross and, therefore, the PNC effect will be significantly enhanced.\nCalculations are performed for quantum numbers $n \\geq 4$ and $\\kappa = \\pm 1$.\n", "  In the search for rare-earth free permanent magnets, various ideas related to\nshape anisotropy are being pursued. In this work we assess the limits of shape\ncontributions to the reversal stability using micromagnetic simulations. In a\nfirst series of tests we altered the aspect ratio of single phase prolate\nspheroids from 1 to 16. Starting with a sphere of radius $4.3$ times the\nexchange length $ L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ we kept the total magnetic volume constant\nas the aspect ratio was modified. For a ferromagnet with zero\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy the maximum coercive field reached up to $0.5$\ntimes the magnetization $M_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Therefore, in materials with moderate\nuniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the addition of shape anisotropy could\neven double the coercive field. Interestingly due to non-uniform magnetization\nreversal there is no significant increase of the coercive field for an aspect\nratio greater than 5. A similar limit of the maximum aspect ratio was observed\nin cylinders. The coercive field depends on the wire diameter. By decreasing\nthe wire diameter from $8.7 L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ to $2.2 L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ the\ncoercive field increased by 40%. In the cylinders nucleation of a reversed\ndomain starts at the corners at the end. Smoothing the edges can improve the\ncoercive field by about 10%.\n  In further simulations we compacted soft magnetic cylinders into a bulk-like\narrangement. Misalignment and magnetostatic interactions cause a spread of $0.1\nM_{\\mathrm{s}}$ in the switching fields of the rods. Comparing the volume\naveraged hysteresis loops computed for isolated rods and the hysteresis loop\ncomputed for interacting rods, we conclude that magnetostatic interactions\nreduce the coercive field by up to 20%.\n", "  We study the image reconstruction problem of a Compton camera which consists\nof semiconductor detectors. The image reconstruction is formulated as a\nstatistical estimation problem. We employ a bin-mode estimation (BME) and\nextend an existing framework to a Compton camera with multiple scatterers and\nabsorbers. Two estimation algorithms are proposed: an accelerated EM algorithm\nfor the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and a modified EM algorithm for the\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the\npotential of the proposed methods.\n", "  We discuss our work toward the construction of a light-shell effective theory\n(LSET), an effective field theory for describing the matter emerging from\nhigh-energy collisions and the accompanying radiation. We work in the highly\nsimplified venue of 0-flavor scalar quantum electrodynamics, with a gauge\ninvariant product of scalar fields at the origin of space-time as the source of\nhigh-energy charged particles. Working in this simple gauge theory allows us to\nfocus on the essential features of LSET. We describe how the effective theory\nis constructed and argue that it can reproduce the full theory tree-level\namplitude. We study the 1-loop radiative corrections in the LSET and suggest\nhow the leading double-logs in the full theory at 1-loop order can be\nreproduced by a purely angular integral in the LSET.\n", "  Continuous neural field models with inhomogeneous synaptic connectivities are\nknown to support traveling fronts as well as stable bumps of localized\nactivity. We analyze stationary localized structures in a neural field model\nwith periodic modulation of the synaptic connectivity kernel and find that they\nare arranged in a snakes-and-ladders bifurcation structure. In the case of\nHeaviside firing rates, we construct analytically symmetric and asymmetric\nstates and hence derive closed-form expressions for the corresponding\nbifurcation diagrams. We show that the ideas proposed by Beck and co-workers to\nanalyze snaking solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation remain valid for the\nneural field model, even though the corresponding spatial-dynamical formulation\nis non-autonomous. We investigate how the modulation amplitude affects the\nbifurcation structure and compare numerical calculations for steep sigmoidal\nfiring rates with analytic predictions valid in the Heaviside limit.\n", "  We study the formation of auxin peaks in a generic class of\nconcentration-based auxin transport models, posed on static plant tissues.\nUsing standard asymptotic analysis we prove that, on bounded domains, auxin\npeaks are not formed via a Turing instability in the active transport\nparameter, but via simple corrections to the homogeneous steady state. When the\nactive transport is small, the geometry of the tissue encodes the peaks'\namplitude and location: peaks arise where cells have fewer neighbours, that is,\nat the boundary of the domain. We test our theory and perform numerical\nbifurcation analysis on two models which are known to generate auxin patterns\nfor biologically plausible parameter values. In the same parameter regimes, we\nfind that realistic tissues are capable of generating a multitude of stationary\npatterns, with a variable number of auxin peaks, that can be selected by\ndifferent initial conditions or by quasi-static changes in the active transport\nparameter. The competition between active transport and production rate\ndetermines whether peaks remain localised or cover the entire domain. We relate\nthe occurrence of localised patterns to a snaking bifurcation structure, which\nis known to arise in a wide variety of nonlinear media but has not yet been\nreported in plant models.\n", "  We describe the ground state of a gas of bosonic atoms with two coherently\ncoupled internal levels in a deep optical lattice in a one dimensional\ngeometry. In the single-band approximation this system is described by a\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The system has a superfluid and a Mott insulating\nphase which can be either paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. We characterize the\nquantum phase transitions at unit filling by means of a density matrix\nrenormalization group technique and compare it with a mean-field approach. The\npresence of the ferromagnetic Ising-like transition modifies the Mott lobes. In\nthe Mott insulating region the system maps to the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel in a transverse field and the numerical results compare very well with\nthe analytical results obtained from the spin model. In the superfluid regime\nquantum fluctuations strongly modify the phase transition with respect to the\nwell established mean-field three dimensional classical bifurcation.\n", "  We study Dicke superradiance as collective and coherent absorption and\n(time-delayed) emission of photons from an ensemble of ultracold atoms in an\noptical lattice. Since this process depends on the coherence properties of the\natoms (e.g., superfluidity), it can be used as a probe for their quantum state.\nIn analogy to pump-probe spectroscopy in solid-state physics, this detection\nmethod facilitates the investigation of nonequilibrium phenomena and is less\ninvasive than time-of-flight experiments or direct (projective) measurements of\nthe atom number (or parity) per lattice site, which both destroy properties of\nthe quantum state such as phase coherence.\n", "  A generalised Schnakenberg reaction-diffusion system with source and loss\nterms and a spatially dependent coefficient of the nonlinear term is studied\nboth numerically and analytically in two spatial dimensions. The system has\nbeen proposed as a model of hair initiation in the epidermal cells of plant\nroots. Specifically the model captures the kinetics of a small G-protein ROP,\nwhich can occur in active and inactive forms, and whose activation is believed\nto be mediated by a gradient of the plant hormone auxin. Here the model is made\nmore realistic with the inclusion of a transverse co-ordinate. Localised\nstripe-like solutions of active ROP occur for high enough total auxin\nconcentration and lie on a complex bifurcation diagram of single and\nmulti-pulse solutions. Transverse stability computations, confirmed by\nnumerical simulation show that, apart from a boundary stripe, these 1D\nsolutions typically undergo a transverse instability into spots. The spots so\nformed typically drift and undergo secondary instabilities such as spot\nreplication. A novel 2D numerical continuation analysis is performed that shows\nthe various stable hybrid spot-like states can coexist. The parameter values\nstudied lead to a natural singularly perturbed, so-called semi-strong\ninteraction regime. This scaling enables an analytical explanation of the\ninitial instability, by describing the dispersion relation of a certain\nnon-local eigenvalue problem. The analytical results are found to agree\nfavourably with the numerics. Possible biological implications of the results\nare discussed.\n", "  We investigate coarse equilibrium states of a fine-scale, stochastic\nagent-based model of consumer lock-in in a duopolistic market. In the model,\nagents decide on their next purchase based on a combination of their personal\npreference and their neighbours' opinions. For agents with independent\nidentically-distributed parameters and all-to-all coupling, we derive an\nanalytic approximate coarse evolution-map for the expected average purchase. We\nthen study the emergence of coarse fronts when spatial segregation is present\nin the relative perceived quality of products. We develop a novel Newton-Krylov\nmethod that is able to compute accurately and efficiently coarse fixed points\nwhen the underlying fine-scale dynamics is stochastic. The main novelty of the\nalgorithm is in the elimination of the noise that is generated when estimating\nJacobian-vector products using time-integration of perturbed initial\nconditions. We present numerical results that demonstrate the convergence\nproperties of the numerical method, and use the method to show that macroscopic\nfronts in this model destabilise at a coarse symmetry-breaking bifurcation.\n", "  We report a fine tuned doping study of strongly overdoped\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ single crystals using electronic Raman\nscattering. Combined with theoretical calculations, we show that the doping, at\nwhich the normal state pseudogap closes, coincides with a Lifshitz quantum\nphase transition where the active hole-like Fermi surface becomes\nelectron-like. This conclusion suggests that the microscopic cause of the\npseudogap is sensitive to the Fermi surface topology. Furthermore, we find that\nthe superconducting transition temperature is unaffected by this transition,\ndemonstrating that their origins are different on the overdoped side.\n", "  We consider a characteristic initial value problem for a class of symmetric\nhyperbolic systems with initial data given on two smooth null intersecting\ncharacteristic surfaces. We prove existence of solutions on a future\nneighborhood of the initial surfaces. The general result is applied to general\nsemilinear wave equations, as well as the Einstein equations with or without\nsources, and conformal variations thereof.\n", "  In one of our previous papers we generalized the Buscher T-dualization\nprocedure. Here we will investigate the application of this procedure to the\ntheory of a bosonic string moving in the weakly curved background. We obtain\nthe complete T-dualization diagram, connecting the theories which are the\nresult of the T-dualizations over all possible choices of the coordinates. We\ndistinguish three forms of the T-dual theories: the initial theory, the theory\nobtained T-dualizing some of the coordinates of the initial theory and the\ntheory obtained T-dualizing all of the initial coordinates. While the initial\ntheory is geometric, all the other theories are non geometric and additionally\nnonlocal. We find the T-dual coordinate transformation laws connecting these\ntheories and show that the set of all T-dualizations forms an Abelian group.\n", "  It has been suggested that the York parameter $T$ (effectively the scalar\nextrinsic curvature of a spatial hypersurface) may play the role of a\nfundamental time parameter. In a flat, forever expanding cosmology the York\nparameter remains always negative, taking values $T=-\\infty$ at the big bang\nand approaching some finite non-positive value as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, $t$\nbeing the usual cosmological time coordinate. Based on previous results\nconcerning a simple, spatially flat cosmological model with a scalar field, we\nprovide a temporal extension of this model to include `times' $T>0$, an epoch\nnot covered by the cosmological time coordinate $t$, and discuss the dynamics\nof this `other side' and its significance. We argue that the extension is\nnecessary if a consistent quantisation scheme is to exist. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate which types of potentials lead to smooth transitions, paying\nparticular attention to currently favoured inflaton potentials.\n", "  Superconducting quantum systems are promising candidates for quantum\ninformation processing due to their scalability and design flexibility.\nHowever, the existence of defects, fluctuations, and inaccuracies is\nunavoidable for practical superconducting quantum circuits. In this paper, a\nsampling-based learning control (SLC) method is used to guide the design of\ncontrol fields for manipulating superconducting quantum systems. Numerical\nresults for one-qubit systems and coupled two-qubit systems show that the\n\"smart\" fields learned using the SLC method can achieve robust manipulation of\nsuperconducting qubits, even in the presence of large fluctuations and\ninaccuracies.\n", "  When the energy eigenvalues of two coupled quantum states approach each other\nin a certain parameter space, their energy levels repel each other and level\ncrossing is avoided. Such level repulsion, or avoided level crossing, is\ncommonly used to describe the dispersion relation of quasiparticles in solids.\nHowever, little is known about the level repulsion when more than two\nquasiparticles are present; for example, in an open quantum system where a\nquasiparticle can spontaneously decay into many particle continuum. Here we\nshow that even in this case level repulsion exists between a long-lived\nquasiparticle state and a continuum. In our fine resolution neutron\nspectroscopy study of magnetic quasiparticles in a frustrated quantum magnet\nBiCu2PO6, we observe a renormalization of quasiparticle dispersion relation due\nto the presence of the continuum of multi-quasiparticle states. Our results\nhave a broadimplication for understanding open quantum systems described by\nnon-hermitian Hamiltonian.\n", "  First-principles calculations to study the electronic and magnetic properties\nof bulk, oxygen-deficient SrTiO$_3$ (STO) under different doping conditions and\ndensities have been conducted. The appearance of magnetism in oxygen-deficient\nSTO is not determined solely by the presence of a single oxygen vacancy but by\nthe density of free carriers and the relative proximity of the vacant sites. We\nfind that while an isolated vacancy behaves as a non-magnetic double donor,\nmanipulation of the doping conditions allows the stability of a single donor\nstate, with emergent local moments coupled ferromagnetically by carriers in the\nconduction band. Strong local lattice distortions enhance the binding of this\nstate. The energy of the in-gap local moment can be further tuned by\northorhombic strain. Consequently we find that the free-carrier density and\nstrain are fundamental components to obtaining trapped spin-polarized electrons\nin oxygen-deficient STO, which may have important implications in the design of\noptical devices.\n", "  We discuss eternal inflation in context of classical probability spaces\ndefined by a triplet: sample space, $\\sigma$-algebra and probability measure.\nWe show that the measure problem is caused by the countable additivity axiom\napplied to the maximal $\\sigma$-algebra of countably infinite sample spaces.\nThis is a serious problem if the bulk space-time is treated as a sample space\nwhich is thought to be effectively countably infinite due to local quantum\nuncertainties. However, in semiclassical description of eternal inflation the\nphysical space expands exponentially which makes the sample space of infinite\ntrajectories uncountable and the (future) boundary space effectively\ncontinuous. Then the measure problem can be solved by defining a probability\nmeasure on the continuum of trajectories or holographically on the future\nboundary. We argue that the probability measure which is invariant under the\nsymmetries of the tree-like structure of eternal inflation can be generated\nfrom the Lebesgue measure on unit interval. According to Vitali theorem the\nLebesgue measure leaves some sets without a measure which means that there are\ncertain probabilistic questions in eternal inflation that cannot be answered.\n", "  We present a new blind formulation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ninference problem. The approach relies on a phenomenological model of the\nmulti-frequency microwave sky without the need for physical models of the\nindividual components. For all-sky and high resolution data, it unifies parts\nof the analysis that have previously been treated separately, such as component\nseparation and power spectrum inference. We describe an efficient sampling\nscheme that fully explores the component separation uncertainties on the\ninferred CMB products such as maps and/or power spectra. External information\nabout individual components can be incorporated as a prior giving a flexible\nway to progressively and continuously introduce physical component separation\nfrom a maximally blind approach. We connect our Bayesian formalism to existing\napproaches such as Commander, SMICA and ILC, and discuss possible future\nextensions.\n", "  We analyze the data about works (papers, books) from the time period\n1990-2010 that are collected in Zentralblatt MATH database. The data were\nconverted into four 2-mode networks (works $\\times$ authors, works $\\times$\njournals, works $\\times$ keywords and works $\\times$ MSCs) and into a partition\nof works by publication year. The networks were analyzed using Pajek -- a\nprogram for analysis and visualization of large networks. We explore the\ndistributions of some properties of works and the collaborations among\nmathematicians. We also take a closer look at the characteristics of the field\nof graph theory as were realized with the publications.\n", "  Contemporary theory holds that massive stars gather mass during their initial\nphases via accreting disk-like structures. However, conclusive evidence for\ndisks has remained elusive for the most massive young objects. This is mainly\ndue to significant observational challenges. Incisive studies, even targeting\nindividual objects, are therefore relevant to the progression of the field. NGC\n3603 IRS 9A* is a young massive stellar object still surrounded by an envelope\nof molecular gas. Previous mid-infrared observations with long-baseline\ninterferometry provided evidence for a disk of 50 mas diameter at its core.\nThis work aims at a comprehensive study of the physics and morphology of IRS 9A\nat near-infrared wavelengths. New sparse aperture masking interferometry data\ntaken with NACO/VLT at Ks and Lp filters were obtained and analysed together\nwith archival CRIRES spectra of the H2 and BrG lines. The calibrated\nvisibilities recorded at Ks and Lp bands suggest the presence of a partially\nresolved compact object of 30 mas at the core of IRS 9A, together with the\npresence of over-resolved flux. The spectroastrometric signal of the H2 line\nshows that this spectral feature proceeds from the large scale extended\nemission (300 mas) of IRS 9A, while the BrG line appears to be formed at the\ncore of the object (20 mas). This scenario is consistent with the brightness\ndistribution of the source for near- and mid-infrared wavelengths at various\nspatial scales. However, our model suffers from remaining inconsistencies\nbetween SED modelling and the interferometric data. Moreover, the BrG\nspectroastrometric signal indicates that the core of IRS 9A exhibits some form\nof complexity such as asymmetries in the disk. Future high-resolution\nobservations are required to confirm the disk/envelope model and to flesh out\nthe details of the physical form of the inner regions of IRS 9A.\n", "  We applied Dirac distribution, Bose-Einstein distribution, and occasionally\nBoltzmann-Gibbs distribution in order to determine which is optimal for income\ndistribution on a large pool of countries. The best fit to the data was\nobserved in the case of Fermi-Dirac distribution, for which the coefficient of\ndetermination showed the best goodness of fit to the data. Using this\ndistribution for data (spun throughout more years), we obtained the underlying\ncritical parameters of annual income distribution such as chemical potential\nand temperature. The next step was to explore the evolution of income using\neconomic analogues to chemical potential and temperature. Using as background\nthe analogy made by Yakovenko between temperature from thermodynamic systems\nand nominal income from Economics, we found other analogies that would allow\nfurther analysis and explanation of income.\n", "  This paper explores several types of income which have not been explored so\nfar by authors who tackled income and wealth distribution using Statistical\nPhysics. The main types of income we plan to analyze are income before\nredistribution (or gross income), income of retired people (or pensions), and\nincome of active people (mostly wages). The distributions used to analyze\nincome distributions are Fermi-Dirac distribution and polynomial distribution\n(as this is present in describing the behavior of dynamic systems in certain\naspects). The data we utilize for our analysis are from France and the UK. We\nfind that both distributions are robust in describing these varieties of\nincome. The main finding we consider to be the applicability of these\ndistributions to pensions, which are not regulated entirely by market\nmechanisms.\n", "  We extend the exploration regarding dynamical approach of macroeconomic\nvariables by tackling systematically expenditure using Statistical Physics\nmodels (for the first time to the best of our knowledge). Also, using\npolynomial distribution which characterizes the behavior of dynamical systems\nin certain situations, we extend also our analysis to mean income data from the\nUK that span for a time interval of 35 years. We find that most of the values\nfor coefficient of determination obtained from fitting the data from\nconsecutive years analysis to be above 80%. We used for our analysis first\ndegree polynomial, but higher degree polynomials and longer time intervals\nbetween the years considered can dramatically increase goodness of the fit. As\nthis methodology was applied successfully to income and wealth, we can conclude\nthat macroeconomic systems can be treated similarly to dynamic systems from\nPhysics. Subsequently, the analysis could be extended to other macroeconomic\nindicators.\n", "  Polynomial distribution can be applied to dynamical systems in certain\nsituations. Macroeconomic systems characterized by economic variables such as\nincome and wealth can be modelled similarly using polynomials. We extend our\nprevious work to data regarding income from a more diversified pool of\ncountries, which contains developed countries with high income, developed\ncountries with middle income, developing and underdeveloped countries. Also,\nfor the first time we look at the applicability of polynomial distribution to\nexpenditure (consumption). Using cumulative distribution function, we found\nthat polynomials are applicable with a high degree of success to the\ndistribution of income to all countries considered without significant\ndifferences. Moreover, expenditure data can be fitted very well by this\npolynomial distribution. We considered a distribution to be robust if the\nvalues for coefficient of determination are higher than 90%. Using this\ncriterion, we decided the degree for the polynomials used in our analysis by\ntrying to minimize the number of coefficients, respectively first or second\ndegree. Lastly, we look at possible correlation between the values from\ncoefficient of determination and Gini coefficient for disposable income.\n", "  Most papers which explored so far macroeconomic variables took into account\nincome and wealth. Equally important as the previous macroeconomic variables is\nthe expenditure or consumption, which shows the amount of goods and services\nthat a person or a household purchased. Using statistical distributions from\nPhysics, such as Fermi-Dirac and polynomial distributions, we try to fit the\ndata regarding the expenditure distribution divided in deciles of population\naccording to their income (gross and disposable expenditure are taken into\naccount). Using coefficient of determination as theoretical tool in order to\nassess the degree of success for these distributions, we find that both\ndistributions are really robust in describing the expenditure distribution,\nregardless the data set or the methodology used to calculate the expenditure\nvalues for the deciles of income. This is the first paper to our knowledge\nwhich tackles expenditure, especially using a method to describe expenditure\nsuch as lower limit on expenditure. This is also relevant since it allows the\napproach of macroeconomic systems using more variables characterizing their\nactivity, can help in the investigation of living standards and inequality, and\npoints to more theoretical explorations which can be very useful for the\nEconomics and business practice.\n", "  We carry out a global analysis of the experimental data on the $\\chi_c$\nproduction cross section and the ratio $\\sigma(\\chi_{c2})/\\sigma(\\chi_{c1})$ at\nthe LHC and the Tevatron. The related long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) at\nboth leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD coupling\nconstant are renewed. We also present the transverse momentum distribution of\nthe $\\chi_c$ production cross section and the ratio\n$\\sigma(\\chi_{c2})/\\sigma(\\chi_{c1})$ for several experimental conditions and\nfind that NLO predictions agree with all sets of experimental data. By\ncontrast, at LO, one cannot explain all the data with a unique value of the\ncolor-octet LDME. A brief analysis of the nonrelativistic QCD scale dependence\nof the cross sections shows that, for the conditions we are concerned with in\nthis paper, the dependence can be almost totally absorbed into the LDME.\n", "  Income and wealth distribution affect stability of a society to a large\nextent and high inequality affects it negatively. Moreover, in the case of\ndeveloped countries, recently has been proven that inequality is closely\nrelated to all negative phenomena affecting society. So far, Econophysics\npapers tried to analyse income and wealth distribution by employing\ndistributions such as Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann, lognormal\n(Gibrat), and exponential. Generally, distributions describe mostly income and\nless wealth distribution for low and middle income segment of population, which\naccounts about 90% of the population. Our approach is based on a totally new\ndistribution, not used so far in the literature regarding income and wealth\ndistribution. Using cumulative distribution method, we find that polynomial\nfunctions, regardless of their degree (first, second, or higher), can describe\nwith very high accuracy both income and wealth distribution. Moreover, we find\nthat polynomial functions describe income and wealth distribution for entire\npopulation including upper income segment for which traditionally Pareto\ndistribution is used.\n", "  In this article we provide a multitrace analysis of the theory of\nnoncommutative $\\Phi^4$ in two dimensions on the fuzzy sphere ${\\bf\nS}^2_{N,\\Omega}$, and on the Moyal-Weyl plane ${\\bf R}^{2}_{\\theta, \\Omega}$,\nwith a non-zero harmonic oscillator term added. The doubletrace matrix model\nsymmetric under $M\\longrightarrow -M$ is solved in closed form. An analytical\nprediction for the disordered-to-non-uniform-ordered phase transition and an\nestimation of the triple point, from the termination point of the critical\nboundary, are derived and compared with previous Monte Carlo measurement.\n", "  We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to understand the underlying\nattenuation mechanism in granular media, with special applicability to the\nmeasurements of the so-called effective mass developed earlier. We consider\nthat the particles interact via Hertz-Mindlin elastic contact forces and that\nthe damping is describable as a force proportional to the velocity difference\nof contacting grains. We determine the behavior of the complex-valued normal\nmode frequencies using 1) DEM, 2) direct diagonalization of the relevant\nmatrix, and 3) a numerical search for the zeros of the relevant determinant.\nAll three methods are in strong agreement with each other. The real and the\nimaginary parts of each normal mode frequency characterize the elastic and the\ndissipative properties, respectively, of the granular medium. We demonstrate\nthat, as the interparticle damping, $\\xi$, increases, the normal modes exhibit\nnearly circular trajectories in the complex frequency plane and that for a\ngiven value of $\\xi$ they all lie on or near a circle of radius $R$ centered on\nthe point $-iR$ in the complex plane, where $R\\propto 1/\\xi$. We show that each\nnormal mode becomes critically damped at a value of the damping parameter $\\xi\n\\approx 1/\\omega_n^0$, where $\\omega_n^0$ is the (real-valued) frequency when\nthere is no damping. The strong indication is that these conclusions carry over\nto the properties of real granular media whose dissipation is dominated by the\nrelative motion of contacting grains. For example, compressional or shear waves\nin unconsolidated dry sediments can be expected to become overdamped beyond a\ncritical frequency, depending upon the strength of the intergranular damping\nconstant.\n", "  We study the spatial properties of high-gain parametric down-conversion\n(PDC). From the Hamiltonian we find the Schmidt modes, apply the Bloch-Messiah\nreduction, and calculate analytically the measurable quantities, such as the\nangular distributions of photon numbers and photon-number correlations. Our\napproach shows that the Schmidt modes of PDC radiation can be considered the\nsame as for the low-gain (biphoton) case while the Schmidt eigenvalues strongly\ndepend on the parametric gain. Its validity is confirmed by comparison with\nseveral experimental results, obtained by us and by other groups.\n", "  Computing the state of a quantum mechanical many-body system composed of\nindistinguishable particles distributed over a multitude of modes is one of the\nparadigmatic test cases of computational complexity theory: Beyond\nwell-understood quantum statistical effects, the coherent superposition of\nmany-particle amplitudes rapidly overburdens classical computing devices -\nessentially by creating extremely complicated interference patterns, which also\nchallenge experimental resolution. With the advent of controlled many-particle\ninterference experiments, optical set-ups that can efficiently probe many-boson\nwave functions - baptised BosonSamplers - have therefore been proposed as\nefficient quantum simulators which outperform any classical computing device,\nand thereby challenge the extended Church-Turing thesis, one of the fundamental\ndogmas of computer science. However, as in all experimental quantum simulations\nof truly complex systems, there remains one crucial problem: How to certify\nthat a given experimental measurement record is an unambiguous result of\nsampling bosons rather than fermions or distinguishable particles, or of\nuncontrolled noise? In this contribution, we describe a statistical signature\nof many-body quantum interference, which can be used as an experimental (and\nclassically computable) benchmark for BosonSampling.\n", "  We present stringent constraints on the average mid-, far-infrared and radio\nemissions of $\\sim$14200 quiescent galaxies (QGs), identified out to $z=3$ in\nthe COSMOS field via their rest-frame NUV$-$r and r$-$J colors, and with\nstellar masses $M_{\\star}=10^{9.8-12.2} \\,M_{\\odot} $. Stacking in deep Spitzer\n(MIPS $24\\,\\mu$m), Herschel (PACS and SPIRE), and VLA (1.4 GHz) maps reveals\nextremely low dust-obscured star formation rates for QGs (SFR\n$<0.1-3\\,M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at $z \\leqslant 2$ and $<6-18\\,M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$\nat $z > 2$), consistent with the low unobscured SFRs\n($<0.01-1.2\\,M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) inferred from modeling their\nultraviolet-to-near-infrared photometry. The average SFRs of QGs are\n$>10\\times$ below those of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) within the $M_{\\star}$-\nand $z$-ranges considered. The stacked 1.4 GHz signals (S/N $> 5$) are, if\nattributed solely to star formation, in excess of the total (obscured plus\nunobscured) SFR limits, suggestive of a widespread presence of low-luminosity\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) among QGs. Our results reaffirm the existence of a\nsignificant population QGs out to $z = 3$, thus corroborating the need for\npowerful quenching mechanism(s) to terminate star formation in galaxies at\nearlier epochs.\n", "  We discuss a problem of parameter estimation for quantum two-level system,\nqubit system, in presence of unknown phase parameter. We analyze trade-off\nrelations for mean-square errors when estimating relevant parameters with\nseparable measurements based on known precision bounds; the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative Cramer-Rao bound and Hayashi-Gill-Massar (HGM) bound. We\ninvestigate the optimal measurement which attains the HGM bound and discuss its\nproperties. We show that the HGM bound for relevant parameters can be attained\nasymptotically by using some fraction of given $n$ quantum states to estimate\nthe phase parameter. We also discuss the Holevo bound which can be attained\nasymptotically by a collective measurement.\n", "  Phase space matching between two plasma-accelerator (PA) stages and between a\nPA and a traditional accelerator component is a critical issue for emittance\npreservation of beams accelerated by PAs. The drastic differences of the\ntransverse focusing strengths as the beam propagates between different stages\nand components may lead to a catastrophic emittance growth in the presence of\nboth finite energy spread and lack of proper matching. We propose using the\nlinear focusing forces from nonlinear wakes in longitudinally tailored plasma\ndensity profiles to provide exact phase space matching to properly transport\nthe electron beam through two such stages with negligible emittance growth.\nTheoretical analysis and particle-in-cell simulations show how these structures\nmay work in four different scenarios. Good agreement between theory and\nsimulation is obtained.\n", "  Probe theories are only applicable in the regime where the probe's\nperturbation of the plasma can be neglected. However, it is not always possible\nto know, a priori, that a particular probe theory can be successfully applied,\nespecially in low density plasmas. This is especially difficult in the case of\ntransient, low density plasmas. Here, we applied probe diagnostics in\ncombination with a 2D particle-in-cell model, to an experiment with a pulsed\nlow density hydrogen plasma. The calculations took into account the full\nchamber geometry, including the plasma probe as an electrode in the chamber. It\nwas found that the simulations reproduce the time evolution of the probe IV\ncharacteristics with good accuracy. The disagreement between the simulated and\nprobe measured plasma density is attributed to the limited applicability of\nprobe theory to measurements of low density pulsed plasmas. Indeed, in the case\nstudied here, probe measurements would lead to a large overestimate of the\nplasma density. In contrast, the simulations of the plasma evolution and the\nprobe characteristics do not suffer from such strict applicability limits.\nThese studies show that probe theory cannot be justified through probe\nmeasurements.\n", "  The radius and surface composition of an exploding massive star,as well as\nthe explosion energy per unit mass, can be measured using early UV observations\nof core collapse supernovae (SNe). We present the first results from a\nsimultaneous GALEX/PTF search for early UV emission from SNe. Six Type II SNe\nand one Type II superluminous SN (SLSN-II) are clearly detected in the GALEX\nNUV data. We compare our detection rate with theoretical estimates based on\nearly, shock-cooling UV light curves calculated from models that fit existing\nSwift and GALEX observations well, combined with volumetric SN rates. We find\nthat our observations are in good agreement with calculated rates assuming that\nred supergiants (RSGs) explode with fiducial radii of 500 solar, explosion\nenergies of 10^51 erg, and ejecta masses of 10 solar masses. Exploding blue\nsupergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars are poorly constrained. We describe how such\nobservations can be used to derive the progenitor radius, surface composition\nand explosion energy per unit mass of such SN events, and we demonstrate why UV\nobservations are critical for such measurements. We use the fiducial RSG\nparameters to estimate the detection rate of SNe during the shock-cooling phase\n(<1d after explosion) for several ground-based surveys (PTF, ZTF, and LSST). We\nshow that the proposed wide-field UV explorer ULTRASAT mission, is expected to\nfind >100 SNe per year (~0.5 SN per deg^2), independent of host galaxy\nextinction, down to an NUV detection limit of 21.5 mag AB. Our pilot GALEX/PTF\nproject thus convincingly demonstrates that a dedicated, systematic SN survey\nat the NUV band is a compelling method to study how massive stars end their\nlife.\n", "  The magnetic field-induced changes in the conductivity of metals are the\nsubject of intense interest, both for revealing new phenomena and as a valuable\ntool for determining their Fermi surface. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved\nmagnetoresistive effect in ultra-clean layered metals, namely a negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance that is capable of overcoming their very\npronounced orbital one. This effect is correlated with the inter-layer coupling\ndisappearing for fields applied along the so-called Yamaji angles where the\ninter-layer coupling vanishes. Therefore, it is intrinsically associated with\nthe Fermi points in the field-induced quasi-one-dimensional electronic\ndispersion, implying that it results from the axial anomaly among these Fermi\npoints. In its original formulation, the anomaly is predicted to violate\nseparate number conservation laws for left- and right-handed chiral- (e.g.\nWeyl) fermions. Its observation in PdCoO$_2$, PtCoO$_2$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$\nsuggests that the anomaly affects the transport of clean conductors,\nparticularly near the quantum limit.\n", "  Walk-off effects, originating from the difference between the group and phase\nvelocities, limit the efficiency of nonlinear optical interactions. While\ntransverse walk-off can be eliminated by proper medium engineering,\nlongitudinal walk-off is harder to avoid. In particular, ultrafast twin- beam\ngeneration via pulsed parametric down-conversion (PDC) and four-wave mixing\n(FWM) is only possible in short crystals or fibres or in double-path schemes.\nHere we show that in high-gain PDC, one can overcome the destructive role of\nboth effects and even turn them into useful tools for shaping the emission. In\nour experiment, one of the twin beams is emitted along the pump Poynting vector\nor its group velocity matches that of the pump. The result is dramatically\nenhanced generation of both twin beams, with the simultaneous narrowing of\nangular and frequency spectrum. The effect will enable efficient generation of\nultrafast twin photons and beams in cavities, waveguides, and\nwhispering-gallery mode resonators.\n", "  We study the spin and charge currents flowing at the interface of an\nitinerant ferromagnet with a topological spin-triplet superconductor having\ndifferent number of time-reversal-invariant Majorana helical modes. Depending\non the number of helical modes, the capacity of carrying spin and charge\ncurrents is shown to be directly related to the amplitude and orientation of\nthe ferromagnetic magnetization with respect to the superconducting\n$\\vec{d}$-vector. Differently from the one-helical mode spin-triplet\nsuperconductor, we find that the presence of a finite amount of electronic\nhybridization with the two pairs of Majorana helical modes leads to\nnonvanishing charge current independently of the ferromagnetic exchange. The\ncompetition between the two pairs of Majorana helical modes remarkably yields a\nspin-current response that is almost constant in the range of weak to\nintermediate ferromagnetism. The behavior of the spin current is tightly linked\nto the direction of the spin-polarization in the ferromagnet and tends to be\nflatten for a magnetization that is coplanar to the spin-triplet\n$\\vec{d}$-vector independently of the number of helical modes.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the Higgs boson spectra in several\nversions of the supersymmetric left--right model based on the gauge symmetry\n$SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_{B-L}$. A variety of\nsymmetry breaking sectors are studied, with a focus on the constraints placed\non model parameters by the lightest neutral CP even Higgs boson mass $M_h$. The\nbreaking of $SU(2)_R$ symmetry is achieved by Higgs fields transforming either\nas triplets or doublets, and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by\neither bi--doublets or doublets. The Higgs potential is analyzed with or\nwithout a gauge singlet Higgs field present. Seesaw models of Type I and Type\nII, inverse seesaw models, universal seesaw models and an $E_6$ inspired\nalternate left--right model are included in our analysis. Several of these\nmodels lead to the tree--level relation $M_h \\leq \\sqrt{2}\\,m_W$ (rather than\n$M_h \\leq m_Z$ that arises in the MSSM), realized when the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry\nbreaking scale is of order TeV. With such an enhanced upper limit, it becomes\npossible to accommodate a Higgs boson of mass 126 GeV with relatively light\nstops that mix negligibly. In models with Higgs triplets, a doubly charged\nscalar remains light below a TeV with its mass arising entirely from radiative\ncorrections. We carry out the complete one--loop calculation for its mass\ninduced by the Majorana Yukawa couplings and show the consistency of the\nframework. We argue that these models prefer a low $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale.\nOther theoretical and phenomenological implications of these models are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We use comparison with recent LHCb data on single Z/\\gamma^* production and\ndecay to lepton pairs as a vehicle to study the current status of the\napplication of our approach of {\\it exact} amplitude-based resummation in\nquantum field theory to precision QCD calculations, by realistic MC event\ngenerator methods, as needed for precision LHC physics. This represents an\nextension of the phase space of our previous studies based on comparison with\nCMS and ATLAS data, as the pseudo-rapidity range measured by the LHCb for\nleptons in the data we study is 2.0<\\eta< 4.5 to be compared with\n|\\eta|<4.6(2.4) in our previous CMS(ATLAS) data comparison for the same\nprocesses. The analyses we present here with the LHCb data thus represent an\nimportant addition to our previous results, as it is essential that theoretical\npredictions be able to control all of the measured phase space at LHC. The\nlevel of agreement between the new theory and the data continues to be a reason\nfor optimism.\n", "  We construct p-adic Euclidean random fields {\\Phi} over Q_{p}^{N}, for\narbitrary N, these fields are solutions of p-adic stochastic pseudodifferential\nequations. From a mathematical perspective, the Euclidean fields are\ngeneralized stochastic processes parametrized by functions belonging to a\nnuclear countably Hilbert space, these spaces are introduced in this article,\nin addition, the Euclidean fields are invariant under the action of certain\ngroup of transformations. We also study the Schwinger functions of {\\Phi}.\n", "  Results are presented from a 3-D Pluto general circulation model (GCM) that\nincludes conductive heating and cooling, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(non-LTE) heating by methane at 2.3 and 3.3 microns, non-LTE cooling by cooling\nby methane at 7.6 microns, and LTE CO rotational line cooling. The GCM also\nincludes a treatment of the subsurface temperature and surface-atmosphere mass\nexchange. An initially 1 m thick layer of surface nitrogen frost was assumed\nsuch that it was large enough to act as a large heat sink (compared with the\nsolar heating term) but small enough that the water ice subsurface properties\nwere also significant. Structure was found in all three directions of the 3-D\nwind field (with a maximum magnitude of order 10 m/s in the horizontal\ndirections and 10$^-5$ microbar/s in the vertical direction). Prograde jets\nwere found at several altitudes. The direction of flow over the poles was found\nto very with altitude. Broad regions of up-welling and down-welling were also\nfound. Predictions of vertical temperature profiles are provided for the Alice\nand REX instruments on New Horizons, while predictions of light curves are\nprovided for ground-based stellar occultation observations. With this model\nmethane concentrations of 0.2% and 1.0% and 8 and 24 microbar surface pressures\nare distinguishable. For ground-based stellar occultations, a detectable\ndifference exists between light curves with the different methane\nconcentrations, but not for different initial global mean surface pressures.\n", "  We study current-induced dynamics of spin textures in thin magnetic\nnanowires. We derive effective equations of motion describing the dynamics of\nthe domain-wall soft modes associated with topological defects. Because the\nmagnetic domain walls are topological objects, these equations are universal\nand depend only on a few parameters. We obtain spin spiral domain-wall\nstructure in ferromagnetic wires with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and\ncritical current dependence on this interaction. We also find the most\nefficient way to move the domain walls by resonant current pulses and propose a\nprocedure to determine their dynamics by measuring the voltage induced by a\nmoving domain wall. Based on translationally non-invariant nanowires, we show\nhow to make prospective magnetic memory nanodevices much more energy efficient.\n", "  Diffraction of light sets the fundamental limit for optical lithography. Many\nquantum lithography schemes have so far been proposed to overcome this limit\neither by making use of highly entangled photons, multi-photon processes or\nmultiple Lambda transitions, which are all experimentally high-demanding.\nRecently, Liao et al. proposed a novel quantum lithography scheme which merely\nemploys Rabi oscillation to surpass the diffraction limit. Here we report a\nfaithful experimental realization of this scheme. Resolution up to ninth of the\nRayleigh diffraction limit has been observed. Possibility of creating an\narbitrary pattern is also tested experimentally by demonstrating the peak\nnarrowing process using several Rabi floppings together with state-selective\noptical depletion. Our work may have direct applications in atom pattern\nengineering for quantum information or quantum simulation applications, and\nwill also possibly boost the adoption of quantum lithography into real-world\napplications in the near future.\n", "  In this letter we present a coherent picture for the evolution of Higgs mode\nin both neutral and charged $s$-wave fermion superfluids, as the strength of\nattractive interaction between fermions increases from the BCS to the BEC\nregime. In the case of neutral fermionic superfluid, such as ultracold\nfermions, the Higgs mode is pushed to higher energy while at the same time,\ngradually loses its spectral weight as interaction strength increases toward\nthe BEC regime, because the system is further tuned away from Lorentz\ninvariance. On the other hand, when damping is taken into account, Higgs mode\nis significantly broadened due to coupling to phase mode in the whole BEC-BCS\ncrossover. In the charged case of electron superconductor, the Anderson-Higgs\nmechanism gaps out the phase mode and suppresses the coupling between the Higgs\nand the phase modes, and consequently, stabilizes the Higgs mode.\n", "  We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris Simulation by\ndirectly tracking the baryonic content of subhalos. These merger trees are used\nto calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar\nmass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most\nappropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in\ntaking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches\nits maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned'\ngalaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a\ndescendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall'\nmoment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for\nthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are\nqualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a\nstrong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\\sim (1+z)^{2.4-2.8}$, a\npower law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on\ndescendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar\nmasses greater than $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{11} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. These trends\nare consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies\n($M_{\\ast} \\gtrsim 10^{10} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$), but in tension with some\nrecent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies ($M_{\\ast}\n\\gtrsim 10^{11} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$), which report a nearly constant or\ndecreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for\nthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar\nmasses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.\n", "  Correlated band theory is employed to investigate the magnetic and electronic\nproperties of different arrangements of oxygen di- and tri-vacancy clusters in\nSrTiO$_3$. Hole and electron doping of oxygen deficient SrTiO$_3$ yields\nvarious degrees of magnetization as a result of the interaction between\nlocalized magnetic moments at the defected sites. Different kinds of Ti atomic\norbital hybridization are described as a function of the doping level and\ndefect geometry. We find that magnetism in SrTiO$_{3-\\delta}$ is sensitive to\nthe arrangement of neighbouring vacancy sites, charge carrier density, and\nvacancy-vacancy interaction. Permanent magnetic moments in the absence of\nvacancy doping electrons are observed. Our description of the charged clusters\nof oxygen vacancies widens the previous descriptions of mono and\nmulti-vacancies and points out the importance of the controled formation at the\natomic level of defects for the realization of transition metal oxide based\ndevices with a desirable magnetic performance.\n", "  Fawzi and Renner [Commun. Math. Phys. 340(2):575, 2015] recently established\na lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) of\ntripartite quantum states $ABC$ in terms of the fidelity of recovery (FoR),\ni.e. the maximal fidelity of the state $ABC$ with a state reconstructed from\nits marginal $BC$ by acting only on the $C$ system. The FoR measures quantum\ncorrelations by the local recoverability of global states and has many\nproperties similar to the CQMI. Here we generalize the FoR and show that the\nresulting measure is multiplicative by utilizing semi-definite programming\nduality. This allows us to simplify an operational proof by Brandao et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115(5):050501, 2015] of the above-mentioned lower bound that\nis based on quantum state redistribution. In particular, in contrast to the\nprevious approaches, our proof does not rely on de Finetti reductions.\n", "  In this paper, we will study non-commutative corrections in the metric tensor\nfor the G\\\"{o}del-type universe, a model that has as its main characteristic\nthe possibility of violation of causality, allowing therefore time travel. We\nalso find that the critical radius in such a model, which eventually will\ndetermine the time travel possibility, is modified due to the non commutativity\nof spatial coordinates.\n", "  Quantum-disordering a discrete-symmetry breaking state by condensing\ndomain-walls can lead to a trivial symmetric insulator state. In this work, we\nshow that if we bind a 1D representation of the symmetry (such as a charge) to\nthe intersection point of several domain walls, condensing such modified\ndomain-walls can lead to a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT)\nstate. This result is obtained by showing that the modified domain-wall\ncondensed state has a non-trivial SPT invariant -- the symmetry-twist dependent\npartition function. We propose two different kinds of field theories that can\ndescribe the above mentioned SPT states. The first one is a\nGinzburg-Landau-type non-linear sigma model theory, but with an additional\nmulti-kink domain-wall topological term. Such theory has an anomalous $U^k(1)$\nsymmetry but an anomaly-free $Z_N^k$ symmetry. The second one is a gauge\ntheory, which is beyond Abelian Chern-Simons/BF gauge theories. We argue that\nthe two field theories are equivalent at low energies. After coupling to the\nsymmetry twists, both theories produce the desired SPT invariant.\n", "  Cooperative phenomena arising due to the coupling of individual atoms via the\nradiation field are a cornerstone of modern quantum and optical physics. Recent\nexperiments on x-ray quantum optics added a new twist to this line of research\nby exploiting superradiance in order to construct artificial quantum systems.\nHowever, so far, systematic approaches to deliberately design superradiance\nproperties are lacking, impeding the desired implementation of more advanced\nquantum optical schemes. Here, we develop an analytical framework for the\nengineering of single-photon superradiance in extended media applicable across\nthe entire electromagnetic spectrum, and show how it can be used to tailor the\nproperties of an artificial quantum system. This \"reverse engineering\" of\nsuperradiance not only provides an avenue towards non-linear and quantum\nmechanical phenomena at x-ray energies, but also leads to a unified view on and\na better understanding of superradiance across different physical systems.\n", "  We study ground states and elementary excitations of a system of bosonic\natoms and diatomic Feshbach molecules trapped in a one-dimensional optical\nlattice using exact diagonalization and variational Monte Carlo methods. We\nprimarily study the case of an average filling of one boson per site. In\nagreement with bosonization theory, we show that the ground state of the system\nin the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the Pfaffian-like state when the\nsystem is tuned towards the superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase\ntransition. Our study clarifies the possibility of the creation of exotic\nPfaffian-like states in realistic one-dimensional systems. We also present\npreliminary evidence that such states support non-Abelian anyonic excitations\nthat have potential application for fault-tolerant topological quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We calculate numerically the R\\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropy of the\nground state of Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators) after\nfixing the position (partial measurement) of some of the oscillators in $d=1,2$\nand $3$ dimensions. We show that after partial measurement as far as the two\nparts are connected the area-law is valid in generic dimensions except in $d=1$\nconformal field theories. When due to the measured region the two parts are\ndisconnected, the entanglement entropy decreases exponentially with respect to\nthe minimum distance between the regions. In the massless case the decay is\npower-law with a universal dimension-dependent exponent.\n", "  Earth-like planets are expected to provide the greatest opportunity for the\ndetection of life beyond the Solar System. However our planet cannot be\nconsidered a fair sample, especially if intelligent life exists elsewhere. Just\nas a person's country of origin is a biased sample among countries, so too\ntheir planet of origin may be a biased sample among planets. The magnitude of\nthis effect can be substantial: over 98% of the world's population live in a\ncountry larger than the median. In the context of a simple model where the mean\npopulation density is invariant to planet size, we infer that a given inhabited\nplanet (such as our nearest neighbour) has a radius $r<1.2 r_\\oplus$ (95%\nconfidence bound). We show that this result is likely to hold not only for\nplanets hosting advanced life, but also for those which harbour primitive life\nforms. Further inferences may be drawn for any variable which influences\npopulation size. For example, since population density is widely observed to\ndecline with increasing body mass, we conclude that most intelligent species\nare expected to exceed 300kg.\n", "  This paper addresses the RF link budget of a communication system using\nunusual waves carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) in order to clearly\nanalyse the fundamental changes for telecommunication applications. The study\nis based on a typical configuration using circular array antennas to transmit\nand receive OAM waves. For any value of the OAM mode order, an original\nasymptotic formulation of the link budget is proposed in which equivalent\nantenna gains and free-space losses appear. The formulations are then validated\nwith the results of a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. By this\nway, we also show how our formula can help to design a system capable of\nsuperimposing several channels on the same bandwidth and the same polarisation,\nbased on the orthogonality of the OAM. Additional losses due to the use of this\ndegree of freedom are notably clearly calculated to quantify the benefit and\ndrawback according to the case.\n", "  Recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial two-dimensional\n(2D) materials paves the way for the experimental realization of electron\nsystems moving on plane fractals. In this work, we present the results of\ncomputer simulations for the conductance and optical absorption spectrum of a\n2D electron gas roaming on a Sierpinski carpet, i.e. a plane fractal with\nHausdorff dimension intermediate between one and two. We find that the\nconductance is sensitive to the spatial location of the leads and that it\ndisplays fractal fluctuations whose dimension is compatible with the Hausdorff\ndimension of the sample. Very interestingly, electrons in this fractal display\na broadband optical absorption spectrum, which possesses sharp \"molecular\"\npeaks at low photon energies.\n", "  We evaluate the entanglement entropy of exactly solvable Hamiltonians\ncorresponding to general families of three-dimensional topological models. We\nshow that the modification to the entropic area law due to three-dimensional\ntopological properties is richer than the two-dimensional case. In addition to\nthe reduction of the entropy caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of\ncontractible loop operators a new topological invariant appears that increases\nthe entropy if the model consists of non-trivially braiding anyons. As a result\nthe three-dimensional topological entanglement entropy provides only partial\ninformation about the two entropic topological invariants.\n", "  Symplectic unitary representations for the Poincar\\'{e} group are studied.\nThe formalism is based on the noncommutative structure of the star-product, and\nusing group theory approach as a guide, a consistent physical theory in phase\nspace is constructed. The state of a quantum mechanics system is described by a\nquasi-probability amplitude that is in association with the Wigner function. As\na result, the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are derived in phase space. As\nan application, we study the Dirac equation with electromagnetic interaction in\nphase space.\n", "  Aerodynamic ground effect in flapping-wing insect flight is of importance to\ncomparative morphologies and of interest to the micro-air-vehicle (MAV)\ncommunity. Recent studies, however, show apparently contradictory results of\neither some significant extra lift or power savings, or zero ground effect.\nHere we present a numerical study of fruitfly sized insect takeoff with a\nspecific focus on the significance of leg thrust and wing kinematics.\nFlapping-wing takeoff is studied using numerical modelling and high performance\ncomputing. The aerodynamic forces are calculated using a three-dimensional\nNavier--Stokes solver based on a pseudo-spectral method with volume\npenalization. It is coupled with a flight dynamics solver that accounts for the\nbody weight, inertia and the leg thrust, while only having two degrees of\nfreedom: the vertical and the longitudinal horizontal displacement. The natural\nvoluntary takeoff of a fruitfly is considered as reference. The parameters of\nthe model are then varied to explore possible effects of interaction between\nthe flapping-wing model and the ground plane. These modified takeoffs include\ncases with decreased leg thrust parameter, and/or with periodic wing\nkinematics, constant body pitch angle. The results show that the ground effect\nduring natural voluntary takeoff is negligible. In the modified takeoffs, when\nthe rate of climb is slow, the difference in the aerodynamic forces due to the\ninteraction with the ground is up to 6%. Surprisingly, depending on the\nkinematics, the difference is either positive or negative, in contrast to the\nintuition based on the helicopter theory, which suggests positive excess lift.\nThis effect is attributed to unsteady wing-wake interactions. A similar effect\nis found during hovering.\n", "  Since 1984, various optical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have\nbeen proposed and examined. In all of them, the rate of secret key generation\ndecays exponentially with distance. A natural and fundamental question is then\nwhether there are yet-to-be discovered optical QKD protocols (without quantum\nrepeaters) that could circumvent this rate-distance tradeoff. This paper\nprovides a major step towards answering this question. We show that the\nsecret-key-agreement capacity of a lossy and noisy optical channel assisted by\nunlimited two-way public classical communication is limited by an upper bound\nthat is solely a function of the channel loss, regardless of how much optical\npower the protocol may use. Our result has major implications for understanding\nthe secret-key-agreement capacity of optical channels---a long-standing open\nproblem in optical quantum information theory---and strongly suggests a real\nneed for quantum repeaters to perform QKD at high rates over long distances.\n", "  While the novel applications of weak values have recently attracted wide\nattention, weak measurement, the usual way to extract weak values, suffers from\nrisky approximations and severe quantum noises. In this paper, we show that the\nweak-value information can be obtained exactly in strong measurement with\npostselections, via measuring the coupling-deformed pointer observables, i.e.,\nthe observables selected according to the coupling strength. With this\napproach, we keep all the advantages claimed by weak-measurement schemes and at\nthe same time solve some widely criticized problems thereof, such as the\nquestionable universality, systematical bias, and drastic inefficiency.\n", "  We study analytically and numerically the generation of shock waves in a\nquasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) made of dilute and\nultracold alkali-metal atoms. For the BEC we use an equation of state based on\na 1D nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation (1D NPSE), which takes into account\ndensity modulations in the transverse direction and generalizes the familiar 1D\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (1D GPE). Comparing 1D NPSE with 1D GPE we find\nquantitative differences in the dynamics of shock waves regarding the velocity\nof propagation, the time of formation of the shock, and the wavelength of\nafter-shock dispersive ripples.\n", "  We study numerically the detailed structure and decay dynamics of isolated\nmonopoles in conditions similar to those of their recent experimental\ndiscovery. We find that the core of a monopole in the polar phase of a spin-1\nBose-Einstein condensate contains a small half-quantum vortex ring. Well after\nthe creation of the monopole, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition\nthat destroys the polar phase. Strikingly, the resulting ferromagnetic order\nparameter exhibits a Dirac monopole in its synthetic magnetic field.\n", "  Interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures possess a fermionic (super)symmetry when\nbosons and fermions in the mixture have equal masses, and when the interaction\nstrengths are appropriately tuned. This symmetry is spontaneously broken in the\nground state of the mixture, leading to a novel Goldstone mode with fermionic\nstatistics and quadratic dispersion. Here we examine the effect of explicit\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations on the Goldstone mode. When the symmetry is not\nexact and the system is allowed to deviate from the symmetric point, we find\nthat the Goldstone mode acquires an energy gap. We show that the excitations\nmanifest themselves as a non-analyticity of the thermodynamic pressure.\n", "  In this paper we analyze Yukawa unification in a three family SO(10) SUSY\nGUT. We perform a global $\\chi^2$ analysis and show that SUSY effects do not\ndecouple even though the universal scalar mass parameter at the GUT scale,\n$m_{16}$, is found to lie between 15 and 30 TeV with the best fit given for\n$m_{16} \\approx 25$ TeV. Note, SUSY effects don't decouple since stops and\nbottoms have mass of order 5 TeV, due to RG running from $M_{GUT}$. The model\nhas many testable predictions. Gauginos are the lightest sparticles and the\nlight Higgs boson is very much Standard Model-like. The model is consistent\nwith flavor and CP observables with the $BR(\\mu \\to e\\gamma)$ close to the\nexperimental upper bound. With such a large value of $m_{16}$ we clearly cannot\nbe considered \"natural\" SUSY nor are we \"Split\" SUSY. We are thus in the region\nin between or \"SUSY on the Edge.\"\n", "  In this chapter we analyze in detail the behaviour and properties of the\nkinks found in an one dimensional model for the close packed rows of potassium\nions in mica muscovite. The model includes realistic potentials obtained from\nthe physics of the problem, ion bombardment experiments and molecular dynamics\nfitted to experiments. These kinks are supersonic and have an unique velocity\nand energy. They are ultradiscrete involving the translation of an interstitial\nion, which is the reason they are called 'crowdions'. Their energy is below the\nmost probable source of energy, the decay of the $^{40}$K isotope and above the\nenergy needed to eject an atom from the mineral, a phenomenon that has been\nobserved experimentally\n", "  How to identify the influential spreaders in social networks is crucial for\naccelerating/hindering information diffusion, increasing product exposure,\ncontrolling diseases and rumors, and so on. In this paper, by viewing the\nk-shell value of each node as its mass and the shortest path distance between\ntwo nodes as their distance, then inspired by the idea of the gravity formula,\nwe propose a gravity centrality index to identify the influential spreaders in\ncomplex networks. The comparison between the gravity centrality index and some\nwell-known centralities, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality,\ncloseness centrality, and k-shell centrality, and so forth, indicates that our\nmethod can effectively identify the influential spreaders in real networks as\nwell as synthetic networks. We also use the classical\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model to verify the good\nperformance of our method.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the rare exclusive Higgs-boson decays into\na single vector meson and a photon and investigate the possibility of using\nthese processes to probe the light-quark Yukawa couplings. We work with an\neffective Lagrangian with modified Higgs couplings to account for possible\nnew-physics effects in a model-independent way. The h->V\\gamma{} decay rate is\ngoverned by the destructive interference of two amplitudes, one of which\ninvolves the Higgs coupling to the quark anti-quark pair inside the vector\nmeson. We derive this amplitude at next-to-leading order in \\alpha_s using QCD\nfactorization, including the resummation of large logarithmic corrections and\naccounting for the effects of flavor mixing. The high factorization scale\n\\mu~m_h ensures that our results are rather insensitive to the hadronic\nparameters characterizing the light-cone distribution amplitude of the vector\nmeson. The second amplitude arises from the loop-induced effective\nh\\gamma\\gamma* and h\\gamma Z* couplings, where the off-shell gauge boson\nconverts into the vector meson. We devise a strategy to eliminate theoretical\nuncertainties related to this amplitude to almost arbitrary precision. This\nopens up the possibility to probe for O(1) modifications of the c- and b-quark\nYukawa couplings and O(30) modifications of the s-quark Yukawa coupling in the\nhigh-luminosity LHC run. In particular, we show that measurements of the ratios\nBr(h->\\Upsilon(nS)\\gamma)/Br(h->\\gamma\\gamma) and Br(h->bb)/Br(h->\\gamma\\gamma)\ncan provide complementary information on the real and imaginary parts of the\nb-quark Yukawa coupling. More accurate measurements would be possible at a\nfuture 100 TeV proton-proton collider.\n", "  We propose a new approach to the pseudogap problem in cuprates. Hole-doped\ncuprates display a broad plateau in the susceptibility centered near\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$. Competition between the softening of different $q$-modes on this\nplateau leads to anomalously slow growth of magnetic correlations with reducing\ntemperature -- i.e., extended ranges of short-range correlations. The plateau\narises from competition between Fermi- surface nesting and a `hidden' Van Hove\nsingularity (VHS) nesting, associated with a bulk contribution to the\nsusceptibility. As such, the VHS contribution is not tied to the Fermi level\nbut rather turns on near $T_{VHS}=(E_F-E_{VHS})/k_B$ [where $E_F$ is the Fermi\nenergy and $E_{VHS}$ the energy of the VHS peak]. Identifying $T^*\\simeq\nT_{VHS}$ can explain many characteristic features of the pseudogap, including\nthe transport anomalies and the termination of the pseudogap when $E_{VHS}$\ncrosses the Fermi level.\n", "  We provide an off-shell formulation of four-dimensional higher spin gravity\nbased on a covariant Hamiltonian action on an open nine-dimensional Poisson\nmanifold whose boundary consists of the direct product of spacetime and a\nnoncommutative twistor space of S^2 x S^2 topology. The fundamental field is a\nsuperconnection consisting of even and odd differential forms valued in the odd\nand even sectors of a 3-graded associative algebra given by the direct product\nof an eight-dimensional Frobenius algebra and a higher spin algebra extended by\ninner Klein operators. The superconnection consists of two one-forms gauging\nthe one-sided actions of the higher spin algebra, two bi-fundamental real forms\ngiven by the Weyl zero-form and a new dynamical two-form, an additional set of\nforms providing a maximal duality extension, and, finally, the Lagrange\nmultipliers required for the covariant Hamiltonian action. In a particular\ntwo-form background, the model yields Vasiliev's recently proposed extended\nhigher spin gravity equations, whose interaction terms are accounted for by de\nRham closed globally defined forms arising in the dynamical two-form.\n", "  In this paper we use the conformal teleparallel gravity to study an isotropic\nand homogeneous Universe which is settled by the FRW metric. We solve the field\nequations and we obtain the behavior of some cosmological parameters such as\nscale factor, deceleration parameter and the energy density of the perfect\nfluid which is the matter field of our model. The field equations, that we\ncalled modified Friedmann equations, allow us to define a dark fluid, with dark\nenergy density and dark pressure, responsible for the acceleration in the\nUniverse.\n", "  Topological phases like topological insulators or superconductors are\nfascinating quantum states of matter, featuring novel properties such as\nemergent chiral edge states or Majorana fermions with non-Abelian braiding\nstatistics. The recent experimental implementation of optical lattices with\nhighly tunable geometry in cold gases opens up a new thrust on exploring these\nnovel quantum states. Here we report that the topological non-trivial Bloch\nbands can arise naturally in a noncentrosymmetric lattice. It induces a\ncontrollable orbital hybridization, producing the topological band structure.\nIn such bands, when considering attractive fermionic atoms, we find a\ntopological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid state with finite center-of-mass momentum\nin the presence of onsite rotation. This topological superfluid supports\nMajorana fermions on its edges. Experimental signatures are predicted for cold\ngases in radio-frequency spectroscopy.\n", "  In conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, security is\nguaranteed by estimating the amount of leaked information through monitoring\nsignal disturbance, which, in practice, is generally caused by environmental\nnoise and device imperfections rather than eavesdropping. Such estimation\ntherefore tends to overrate the amount of leaked information in practice, leads\nto a fundamental threshold of the bit error rate. The threshold becomes a\nbottleneck of the development of practical QKD systems. In classical\ncommunication, according to Shannon's communication theory, information can\ntransform through a noisy channel even if the background noise is very strong\ncompare to the signal and hence the threshold of the bit error rate tends to\n50%. One might wonder whether a QKD scheme can also tolerate error rate as high\nas 50%. The question is answered affirmatively with the recent work of\nround-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol, which breaks through the\nfundamental threshold of the bit error rate and indicates another potential\ndirection in the field of quantum cryptography. The key challenge to realize\nthe RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a\nvariable-delay interferometer. The delay needs to be chosen from a set of\npredetermined values randomly. Such measurement can be realized by switching\nbetween many interferometers with different delays at a high speed in\naccordance with the system repetition rate. The more delay values can be chosen\nfrom, the higher error rate can be tolerated. By designing an optical system\nwith multiple switches and employing an active phase stabilization technology,\nwe successfully construct a variable-delay interferometer with 128 actively\nselectable delays. With this measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the\nRRDPS QKD protocol and obtain a final key rate of 15.54 bps via a total loss of\n18 dB and 8.9% error rate.\n", "  The mid-infrared (mid-IR) regime (typically the wavelength regime of $\\lambda\n\\sim 2.5-20 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) is an important spectral range for spectroscopy\nas many molecules have their fundamental rotational-vibrational absorption in\nthis band. Recently optical frequency combs based on optical microresonators\n(\"Kerr\" combs) at the onset of the mid-IR region have been generated using\ncrystalline resonators and integrated planar silicon micro-resonators. Here we\nextend for the first time Kerr combs deep into the mid-IR i.e. the 'molecular\nfingerprint' region. This is achieved by combining an ultra high quality (Q)\nfactor mid-IR microresonator based on crystalline $\\mathrm{MgF_{2}}$ with the\nquantum cascade laser (QCL) technology. Using a tapered chalgogenide (ChG)\nfiber and a QCL continuous wave pump laser, frequency combs at $\\lambda\\sim\n4.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ (i.e. 2270cm$^{-1}$) are generated, that span over 600nm\n(i.e. 300cm$^{-1}$) in bandwidth, with a mode spacing of 14.3GHz\n(0.5cm$^{-1}$), corresponding to more than 700 comb lines. Numerical\nsimulations of the Kerr comb formation and the resonator dispersion predict\nthat even larger bandwidth and coherent operation in the soliton regime may be\nachieved by dispersion engineering of the crystalline microresonator. The\ncombination of ultra-high Q crystalline microresonators and CW QCL sources is a\npromising platform for broadband, compact sources of frequency combs in the\nmid-IR, that provides a route to compact mid-IR spectrometers.\n", "  This paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, the inverse spectral\nproblem for tight-binding hamiltonians is studied. This problem is shown to\nhave an infinite number of solutions for properly chosen energies. The space of\nsuch solutions is characterized by a hypersurface in the space of hopping\namplitudes (i.e. couplings), whose dimension is half the number of sites in the\narray. Low dimensional examples for short chains are carefully studied and a\ntable of exactly solvable inverse problems is provided in terms of Lie\nalgebraic structures. With the aim of providing a method to generate lattice\nconfigurations, a set of equations for coupling constants in terms of energies\nis obtained; this is done by means of a new formula for the calculation of\ncharacteristic polynomials. Two examples with randomly generated spectra are\nstudied numerically, leading to peaked distributions of couplings. In the\nsecond part of the paper, our results are applied to the design of bent\nwaveguides, reproducing specific spectra below propagation threshold. As a\ndemonstration, the Dirac and the finite oscillator are realized in this way. A\nfew partially isospectral configurations are also presented.\n", "  We consider the back reaction of the energy due to quantum fluctuation of the\nbackground fields considering the trace anomaly for Schwarzschild black hole.\nIt is shown that it will result in modification of the horizon and also\nformation of an inner horizon. We show that the process of collapse of a thin\nshell stops before formation of the singularity at a radius slightly smaller\nthan the inner horizon at the order of $(c_{A}\\frac{M}{M_p})^{1/3}l_p$. After\nthe collapse stops the reverse process takes place. Thus we demonstrate that\nwithout turning on quantum gravity and just through the effects the coupling of\nfield to gravity as trace anomaly of quantum fluctuations the formation of the\nsingularity through collapse is obstructed. An important consequence of our\nwork is existence of an extremal solution with zero temperature and a mass\nwhich is lower bound for the Schwazschild solution. This solution is also the\nasymptotic final stable state after Hawking radiation.\n", "  We consider quantum Hall states on a space with boundary, focusing on the\naspects of the edge physics which are completely determined by the symmetries\nof the problem. There are four distinct terms of Chern-Simons type that appear\nin the low-energy effective action of the state. Two of these protect gapless\nedge modes. They describe Hall conductance and, with some provisions, thermal\nHall conductance. The remaining two, including the Wen-Zee term, which\ncontributes to the Hall viscosity, do not protect gapless edge modes but are\ninstead related to local boundary response fixed by symmetries. We highlight\nsome basic features of this response. It follows that the coefficient of the\nWen-Zee term can change across an interface without closing a gap or breaking a\nsymmetry.\n", "  We present systematic temperature-quench Monte Carlo simulations on\ndiscrete-strain pseudospin model Hamiltonians to study microstructural\nevolutions in 2D ferroelastic transitions with two-component vector order\nparameters ($N_{OP}=2$). The zero value pseudospin is the single\nhigh-temperature phase while the low-temperature phase has $N_v$ variants. Thus\nthe number of nonzero values of pseudospin are triangle-to-centered rectangle\n($N_v=3$), square-to-oblique ($N_v=4$) and triangle-to-oblique ($N_v=6$). The\nmodel Hamiltonians contain a transition-specific Landau energy term, a domain\nwall cost or Ginzburg term, and power-law anisotropic interaction potential,\ninduced from a strain compatibility condition. On quenching below a transition\ntemperature, we find behaviour similar to the previously studied\nsquare-to-rectangle transition ($N_{OP} =1, N_v = 2$), showing that the rich\nbehaviour found, is generic. Thus we find for two-component order parameters,\nthat the same Hamiltonian can describe both athermal and isothermal martensite\nregimes for different material parameters. The athermal/isothermal/austenite\nparameter regimes and temperature-time-transformation diagrams are understood,\nas previously, through parametrization of effective-droplet energies. In the\nathermal regime, we find rapid conversions below a spinodal like temperature\nand austenite-martensite conversion delays above it, as in the experiment. The\ndelays show early incubation behaviour, and at the transition to austenite the\ndelay times have Vogel-Fulcher divergences and are insensitive to Hamiltonian\nenergy scales, suggesting that entropy barriers are dominant.\n", "  Using a combination of the replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm and the\nmulticanonical method, we investigate the influence of bending stiffness on the\nconformational phases of a bead-stick homopolymer model and present the\npseudo-phase diagram for the complete range of semi-flexible polymers, from\nflexible to stiff. Although a simple model, we observe a rich variety of\nconformational phases, reminiscent of conformations observed for synthetic\npolymers or biopolymers. Changing the internal bending stiffness, the model\nexhibits different pseudo phases like bent, hairpin or toroidal. In particular,\nwe find thermodynamically stable knots and transitions into these knotted\nphases with a clear phase coexistence, but almost no change in the mean total\nenergy.\n", "  In classical physics, probabilistic or statistical knowledge has been always\nrelated to ignorance or inaccurate subjective knowledge about an actual state\nof affairs. This idea has been extended to quantum mechanics through a\ncompletely incoherent interpretation of the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein\nstatistics in terms of \"strange\" quantum particles. This interpretation,\nnaturalized through a widespread \"way of speaking\" in the physics community,\ncontradicts Born's physical account of {\\Psi} as a \"probability wave\" which\nprovides statistical information about outcomes that, in fact, cannot be\ninterpreted in terms of 'ignorance about an actual state of affairs'. In the\npresent paper we discuss how the metaphysics of actuality has played an\nessential role in limiting the possibilities of understating things\ndifferently. We propose instead a metaphysical scheme in terms of powers with\ndefinite potentia which allows us to consider quantum probability in a new\nlight, namely, as providing objective knowledge about a potential state of\naffairs.\n", "  The production of heavy quarkonia is a powerful tool to test our\nunderstanding of strong interaction dynamics. It is well-known that the\ndominant production mechanism for heavy quarkonia with large transverse\nmomentum is fragmentation. In this work we, analytically, calculate the QCD\nleading order contribution to the process-independent fragmentation functions\n(FFs) for a gluon to split into the vector ($J/\\psi$) and pseudoscalar\n($\\eta_c$) $S$-wave charmonium states. The analyses of this paper differ in\nwhich we present, for the first time, an analytical form of the $g\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi$ FF using a different approach (Suzuki's model) in comparison with other\nresults presented in literatures, where the Braaten's scheme was used and the\ntwo-dimensional integrals were presented for the gluon FFs which must be\nevaluated numerically. The universal fragmentation probability for the\n$g\\rightarrow J/\\psi$ is about $10^{-6}$ which is in good consistency with the\nresult obtained in the Braaten's model.\n", "  Through detailed electronic structure simulations we show that the electronic\norbital ordering (between d$_{yz}$ and d$_{xz}$ bands) takes place due to local\nbreaking of in-plane symmetry that generates two non-equivalent $a$, $b$\ndirections in 122 family of Fe-based superconductors. Orbital ordering is\nstrongly anisotropic and the temperature dependence of the corner zone orbital\norder maps to that of the orthorhombicity parameter. Orbital anisotropy results\nin two distinct spin density wave nesting wave vectors and causes inter-orbital\ncharge and spin fluctuations. Temperature dependence of the orbital order is\nproportional to the nematic order and it sets in at a temperature where\nmagnetic fluctuation starts building. Magnetic fluctuations in the orthorhombic\nphase is characterized through evolution of Stoner factor which reproduces\nexperimentalfindings very accurately. Orbital ordering becomes strongly spin\ndependent in presence of magnetic interaction. Occupation probabilities of all\nthe Fe-d-orbitals exhibit temperature dependence indicating their possible\ncontribution in orbital fluctuation. This need to be contrasted with the usual\ndefinition of nematic order parameter (n$_{d_{xz}}$-n$_{d_{yz}}$). Relationship\namong orbital fluctuations, magnetic fluctuations and nematicity are\nestablished.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a Bose-condensed exciton gas out of equilibrium.\nWithin the framework of the combined BCS-Leggett strong-coupling theory with\nthe non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism, we show how the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) of excitons is suppressed to eventually disappear, when the\nsystem is in the non-equilibrium steady state. The supply of electrons and\nholes from the bath is shown to induce quasi-particle excitations, leading to\nthe partial occupation of the upper branch of Bogoliubov single-particle\nexcitation spectrum. We also discuss how this quasi-particle induction is\nrelated to the suppression of exciton BEC, as well as the stability of the\nsteady state.\n", "  We demonstrate that recent advances in nanoscale thermal transport and\ntemperature manipulation can be brought to bear on the problem of tailoring\nthermal radiation from compact emitters. We show that wavelength-scale\ncomposite bodies involving complicated arrangements of phase-change\nchalcogenide (GST) glasses and metals or semiconductors can exhibit large\nemissivities and partial directivities at mid-infrared wavelengths, a\nconsequence of temperature localization within the GST. We consider multiple\nobject topologies, including spherical, cylindrical, and mushroom-like\ncomposites, and show that partial directivity follows from a complicated\ninterplay between particle shape, material dispersion, and temperature\nlocalization. Our calculations exploit a recently developed fluctuating-volume\ncurrent formulation of electromagnetic fluctuations that rigorously captures\nradiation phenomena in structures with both temperature and dielectric\ninhomogeneities.\n", "  We compute characters of the BMS group in three dimensions. The approach is\nthe same as that performed by Witten in the case of coadjoint orbits of the\nVirasoro group in the eighties, within the large central charge approximation.\nThe procedure involves finding a Poisson bracket between classical variables\nand the corresponding commutator of observables in a Hilbert space, explaining\nwhy we call this a quantization. We provide first a pedagogical warm up by\napplying the method to both SL(2,R) and Poincar\\'{e}3 groups. As for BMS3, our\nresults coincide with the characters of induced representations recently\nstudied in the literature. Moreover, we relate the 'coadjoint representations'\nto the induced representations.\n", "  Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFePO in 2006, numerous\niron-based superconductors have been identified within diverse structure\nfamilies, all of which combine iron with a group-V (pnictogen) or group-VI\n(chalco- gen) element. Unconventional superconductivity is extremely rare among\ntransition metal compounds outside these layered iron systems and the cuprates,\nand it is almost universally associated with highly anisotropic electronic\nproperties and nearly 2D Fermi surface geometries. The iron-based intermetallic\nYFe$_2$Ge$_2$ features a 3D Fermi surface and a strongly enhanced low\ntemperature heat capacity, which signals strong electronic correlations. We\npresent data from a new generation of high quality samples of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$,\nwhich show superconducting transition anomalies below 1.8 K in thermodynamic as\nwell as transport measurements, establishing that superconductivity is\nintrinsic in this layered iron compound outside the known superconducting iron\npnictide or chalcogenide families. The Fermi surface geometry of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$\nresembles that of KFe$_2$As$_2$ in the high pressure collapsed tetragonal\nphase, in which superconductivity at temperatures as high as 10 K has recently\nbeen reported, suggesting an underlying connection between the two systems.\n", "  Since the discovery of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the oxide\ninterface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3, improving carrier mobility has become an important\nissue for device applications. In this paper, by using an alternate polar\nperovskite insulator (La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3 (LSAT) for reducing lattice\nmismatch from 3.0% to 1.0%, the low-temperature carrier mobility has been\nincreased 30 fold to 35,000 cm2V-1s-1. Moreover, two critical thicknesses for\nthe LSAT/SrTiO3 (001) interface are found: one at 5 unit cell for appearance of\nthe 2DEG, the other at 12 unit cell for a peak in the carrier mobility. By\ncontrast, the conducting (110) and (111) LSAT/STO interfaces only show a single\ncritical thickness of 8 unit cells. This can be explained in terms of polar\nfluctuation arising from LSAT chemical composition. In addition to lattice\nmismatch and crystal symmetry at the interface, polar fluctuation arising from\ncomposition has been identified as an important variable to be tailored at the\noxide interfaces to optimise the 2DEG transport.\n", "  The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE is used to investigate strange\nparticle production in Au + Au collisions at GeV in different centralities and\nat 39, 11.5 and 7.7 GeV in the most central collision, respectively. It is\nshown that the transverse momentum distributions of strange particles by the\nPACIAE model fit the RHIC Beam Energy Scan experimental results well.\n", "  The gravitational influence of a planet on a nearby disk provides a powerful\ntool for detecting and studying extrasolar planetary systems. Here we\ndemonstrate that gaps can be opened in dynamically cold debris disks at the\nmean-motion resonances of an orbiting planet. The gaps are opened away from the\norbit of the planet itself, revealing that not all disk gaps need contain a\nplanetary body. These gaps are large and deep enough to be detectable in\nresolved disk images for a wide range of reasonable disk-planet parameters,\nthough we are not aware of any such gaps detected to date. The gap shape and\nsize are diagnostic of the planet location, eccentricity and mass, and allow\none to infer the existence of unseen planets, as well as many important\nparameters of both seen and unseen planets in these systems. We present\nexpressions to allow the planetary mass to be calculated from observed gap\nwidth and location.\n", "  We consider the voter model with $M$ states initially in the system. Using\ngenerating functions, we pose the spectral problem for the Markov transition\nmatrix and solve for all eigenvalues and eigenvectors exactly. With this\nsolution, we can find all future probability probability distributions, the\nexpected time for the system to condense from $M$ states to $M-1$ states, the\nmoments of consensus time, the expected local times, and the expected number of\nstates over time. Furthermore, when the initial distribution is uniform, such\nas when $M=N$, we can find simplified expressions for these quantities. In\nparticular, we show that the mean and variance of consensus time for $M=N$ is\n$\\frac{1}{N}(N-1)^2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}(\\pi^2-9)(N-1)^2$ respectively.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and computational study of\nfour-wave mixing (FWM) of optical pulses co-propagating in one-dimensional\nsilicon photonic crystal waveguides (Si-PhCWGs). Our theoretical analysis\ndescribes a very general set-up of the interacting optical pulses, namely we\nconsider nondegenerate FWM in a configuration in which at each frequency there\nexists a superposition of guiding modes. We incorporate in our theoretical\nmodel all relevant linear optical effects, including waveguide loss,\nfree-carrier (FC) dispersion and FC absorption, nonlinear optical effects such\nas self- and cross-phase modulation (SPM, XPM), two-photon absorption (TPA),\nand cross-absorption modulation (XAM), as well as the coupled dynamics of FCs\nand optical field. In particular, our theoretical analysis based on the\ncoupled-mode theory provides rigorously derived formulae for linear dispersion\ncoefficients of the guiding modes, linear coupling coefficients between these\nmodes, as well as the nonlinear waveguide coefficients describing SPM, XPM,\nTPA, XAM, and FWM. In addition, our theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations reveal key differences between the characteristics of FWM in the\nslow- and fast-light regimes, which could potentially have important\nimplications to the design of ultra-compact active photonic devices.\n", "  We introduce and study a Markov field on the edges of a graph in dimension\n$d\\geq2$ whose configurations are spin networks. The field arises naturally as\nthe edge-occupation field of a Poissonian model (a soup) of non-backtracking\nloops and walks characterized by a spatial Markov property such that,\nconditionally on the value of the edge-occupation field on a boundary set, the\ndistributions of the loops and arcs on either side of the boundary are\nindependent of each other. The field has a Gibbs distribution with a\nHamiltonian given by a sum of terms which involve only edges incident on the\nsame vertex. Its free energy density and other quantities can be computed\nexactly, and their critical behavior analyzed, in any dimension.\n", "  After growing successfully TaP single crystal, we measured its longitudinal\nresistivity (rhoxx) and Hall resistivity (rhoyx) at magnetic fields up to 9T in\nthe temperature range of 2-300K. It was found that at 2K its magnetoresistivity\n(MR) reaches to 328000 percent, at 300K to 176 percent at 8T, and both do not\nappear saturation. We confirmed that TaP is indeed a low carrier concentration,\nhole-electron compensated semimetal, with a high mobility of hole muh=371000\ncm2V-1s-1, and found that a magnetic-field-induced metal-insulator transition\noccurs at room temperature. Remarkably, as a magnetic field (H) is applied in\nparallel to the electric field (E), the negative MR due to chiral anomaly is\nobserved, and reaches to -3000 percent at 9T without any signature of\nsaturation, too, which distinguishes with other Weyl semimetals (WSMs). The\nanalysis on the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations superimposing on the MR\nreveals that a nontrivial Berry phase with strong offset of 0.3958 realizes in\nTaP, which is the characteristic feature of the charge carriers enclosing a\nWeyl nodes. These results indicate that TaP is a promising candidate not only\nfor revealing fundamental physics of the WSM state but also for some novel\napplications.\n", "  Photons have proven to be excellent carriers of quantum information, and play\nessential roles in numerous quantum information processing (QIP) applications.\nIn particular, heralded single- photon sources via spontaneous parametric-down\nconversion (SPDC) have been a key technology for demonstrating small-scale QIP,\nyet their low generation efficiency is a critical limitation for further\nscaling up optical QIP technology. In order to efficiently overcome the\nprobabilistic nature of SPDC, here we demonstrate time multiplexing for up to\n30 time slots of a periodically pumped heralded single-photon source, using a\nswitchable low-loss optical storage cavity. We observe a maximum single-photon\nprobability of 38.6% in periodic output time windows, corresponding to 6 times\nenhancement over a non-multiplexed source, but with no increase in the\ncontribution of unwanted multi-photon events. Combining this time-multiplexing\ntechnique with a heralded source producing pure single-photon states should\nenable larger scale optical QIP systems than ever realized.\n", "  The possibility that like-charges can attract each other under the mediation\nof mobile counterions is by now well documented experimentally, numerically,\nand analytically. Yet, obtaining exact results is in general impossible, or\nrestricted to some limiting cases. We work out here in detail a one dimensional\nmodel that retains the essence of the phenomena present in higher dimensional\nsystems. The partition function is obtained explicitly, from which a wealth of\nrelevant quantities follow, such as the effective force between the charges or\nthe counterion profile in their vicinity. Isobaric and canonical ensembles are\ndistinguished. The case of two equal charges screened by an arbitrary number\n$N$ of counterions is first studied, before the more general asymmetric\nsituation is addressed. It is shown that the parity of $N$ plays a key role in\nthe long range physics.\n", "  Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task\nin the development of practical quantum technology. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic numerical methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) for\ncontrol design of quantum systems with uncertainties. The SLC method includes\ntwo steps of \"training\" and \"testing\". In the training step, an augmented\nsystem is constructed using artificial samples generated by sampling\nuncertainty parameters according to a given distribution. A gradient flow based\nlearning algorithm is developed to find the control for the augmented system.\nIn the process of testing, a number of additional samples are tested to\nevaluate the control performance where these samples are obtained through\nsampling the uncertainty parameters according to a possible distribution. The\nSLC method is applied to three significant examples of quantum robust control\nincluding state preparation in a three-level quantum system, robust\nentanglement generation in a two-qubit superconducting circuit and quantum\nentanglement control in a two-atom system interacting with a quantized field in\na cavity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLC approach\neven when uncertainties are quite large, and show its potential for robust\ncontrol design of quantum systems.\n", "  We propose a method to all-electrically control a domain-wall position in a\nferromagnetic nanowire with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The strength of\nthis interaction can be controlled by an external electric field, which in turn\nallows a fine tuning of the pinning potential of a spin-spiral domain wall. It\nallows to create more mobile pinning sites and can also be advantageous for\nultra-low power electronics.\n", "  We conjecture that for superconformal field theories in even dimensions, the\nsupersymmetric Casimir energy on a space with topology $S^1\\times S^{D-1}$ is\nequal to an equivariant integral of the anomaly polynomial. The equivariant\nintegration is defined with respect to the Cartan subalgebra of the global\nsymmetry algebra that commutes with a given supercharge. We test our proposal\nextensively by computing the supersymmetric Casimir energy for large classes of\nsuperconformal field theories, with and without known Lagrangian descriptions,\nin two, four and six dimensions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the detection of accelerator neutrinos produced at\nthe China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Using the code FLUKA, we have\nsimulated the production of neutrinos in the proton beam on the tungsten target\nand obtained the yield efficiency, numerical flux, and average energy of\ndifferent flavors of neutrinos. Furthermore, detections of these accelerator\nneutrinos are investigated in two reaction channels, the neutrino-electron\nreactions and neutrino-carbon reactions. The event numbers of different flavors\nof neutrinos have also been calculated.\n", "  We show that the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) that has been\nused to ease the shock revival in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe)\nneutrino-driven explosion models, might play a much more decisive role in\nsupplying the stochastic angular momentum required to trigger an explosion with\njittering jets. We find that if the kinetic energy associated with the\ntransverse (non radial) motion of the SASI is larger than about ten percent of\nthe energy associated with the energy of the accreted gas, then the stochastic\nangular momentum can reach about five percent of the Keplerian specific angular\nmomentum around the newly born neutron star. Such an accretion flow leaves an\nopen conical region along the poles with an average opening angle of about 5\ndegrees. The outflow from the open polar regions powers an explosion according\nto the jittering-jets model.\n", "  We investigate ionization of neon atoms by an isolated attosecond pump pulse\nin the presence of two coherent extreme ultraviolet or x-ray probe fields. The\nprobe fields are tuned to a core-valence transition in the residual ion and\ninduce spectral shearing of the photoelectron distributions. We show that the\nphotoelectron-ion coincidence signal contains an interference pattern that\ndepends on the temporal structure of the attosecond pump pulse and the\nstimulated core-valence transition. Many-body perturbation theory is used to\ncompute \"atomic response times\" for the processes and we find strikingly\ndifferent behavior for stimulation to the outer-core hole (2p - 2s) and\nstimulation to the inner-core hole (2p - 1s). The response time of the\ninner-core transition is found to be comparable to that of state-of-the-art\nlaser-based characterization techniques for attosecond pulses.\n", "  We study the synchrotron component of the spectral energy distribution (SED)\non the sample of 877 blazars using the ASDC SED Builder Tool with available\nbroadband data from the literature. Our sample includes 423 flat-spectrum radio\nsources (FSRQs), 361 BL Lac objects and candidates, and 93 blazars of uncertain\ntype. We have made an estimation of the synchrotron peak frequency\n($\\nu_{peak}^{s}$) for the 875 objects and further classified them as high,\nintermediate and low synchrotron peaked sources (HSPs/ISPs/LSPs). There are 42\nHSPs with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} > 10^{16.5}$ Hz, 222 ISPs with $10^{14.5} <\n\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{16.5}$ Hz, and 611 LSPs with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{14.5}$\nHz in our sample. We have calculated an average value of $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ to be\n$10^{13.4 \\pm 1.0}$ Hz for FSRQs and $10^{14.6 \\pm 1.4}$ Hz for BL Lacs. We\nfound out that $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ and the flux density at 4.8 GHz have a\ndifferent distribution (as indicated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at significance\nlevel 0.05) for the FSRQ and BL Lac blazars, and for the RBL and XBL types of\nBL Lacs. Distribution of $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ values is broader for BL Lacs, than\nfor FSRQs. There are no ultra-high energy peaked objects (with $\\nu_{peak}^{s}\n> 10^{19}$ Hz) in our BL Lac sample according to our estimations. The\nsignificant part of FSRQs (41%) and small part of BL Lacs (9%) in our sample\ncould be considered as candidates to the very-low synchrotron peaked blazars\n(with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{13}$ Hz). Our foundations confirm results of the\nprevious studies made on samples with significantly smaller number of objects.\n", "  We study the possible existence of static traversable wormholes without\ninvoking exotic matter in the framework of the Einstein--Cartan theory. A\nfamily of exact static, spherically symmetric wormhole solutions with an\narbitrary throat radius, with flat or AdS asymptotic behavior, has been\nobtained with sources in the form of two noninteracting scalar fields with\nnonzero potentials. Both scalar fields are canonical (that is, satisfy the weak\nenergy condition), one is minimally and the other nonminimally coupled to\ngravity, and the latter is a source of torsion.\n", "  We show that the correlations of electrons with a fixed energy in metals have\nvery anomalous time and space dependences. Due to soft modes that exist in any\nFermi liquid, combined with the incomplete screening of the Coulomb interaction\nat finite frequencies, the correlations in 2-d systems grow with time as $t^2$.\nIn the presence of disorder, the spatial correlations grow as the distance\nsquared. Similar, but in general weaker, effects are present in 3-d systems and\nin the absence of quenched disorder. We propose ways to experimentally measure\nthese anomalous correlations.\n", "  We show that for an anomalous fluid carrying dissipationless chiral magnetic\nand/or vortical currents there is a frame in which a stationary obstacle\nexperiences no drag, but energy and charge currents do not vanish, resembling\nsuperfluidity. However, unlike ordinary superfluid flow, the anomalous chiral\ncurrents do transport entropy in this frame. We show that the second law of\nthermodynamics completely determines the amounts of these anomalous\nnon-dissipative currents in the \"no-drag frame\" as polynomials in temperature\nand chemical potential with known anomaly coefficients. These general results\nare illustrated and confirmed by a calculation in the chiral kinetic theory and\nquark-gluon plasma at high temperature.\n", "  Dark Matter particles with inelastic interactions are ubiquitous in\nextensions of the Standard Model, yet remain challenging to fully probe with\nexisting strategies. We propose a series of powerful searches at hadron and\nlepton colliders that are sensitive to inelastic dark matter dynamics. In\nrepresentative models featuring either a massive dark photon or a magnetic\ndipole interaction, we find that the LHC and BaBar could offer strong\nsensitivity to the thermal-relic dark matter parameter space for dark matter\nmasses between ~100 MeV-100 GeV and fractional mass-splittings above the\npercent level; future searches at Belle II with a dedicated monophoton trigger\ncould also offer sensitivity to thermal-relic scenarios with masses below a few\nGeV. Thermal scenarios with either larger masses or splittings are largely\nruled out; lower masses remain viable yet may be accessible with other search\nstrategies.\n", "  Recently Graham, Kaplan and Rajendran [1] proposed cosmological relaxation as\na mechanism for generating a hierarchically small Higgs vacuum expectation\nvalue. Inspired by this we collect some thoughts on steps towards a solution to\nthe electroweak hierarchy problem and apply them to the original model of\ncosmological relaxation [1]. To do so, we study the dynamics of the model and\ndetermine the relation between the fundamental input parameters and the\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value. Depending on the input parameters the\nmodel exhibits three qualitatively different regimes, two of which allow for\nhierarchically small Higgs vacuum expectation values. One leads to standard\nelectroweak symmetry breaking whereas in the other regime electroweak symmetry\nis mainly broken by a Higgs source term. While the latter is not acceptable in\na model based on the QCD axion, in non-QCD models this may lead to new and\ninteresting signatures in Higgs observables.\n", "  We prove that the electromagnetic field in a (1+2)-dimensional spacetime\nnecessarily inherits the symmetries of the spacetime metric in a large class of\ngeneralized Einstein-Maxwell theories. The Lagrangians of the studied theories\nhave general diff-covariant gravitational part and include both the\ngravitational and the gauge Chern-Simons terms.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetocaloric effect in single and polycrystalline\nsamples of quantum paraelectric EuTiO3 by magnetization and heat capacity\nmeasurements. Single crystalline EuTiO3 shows antiferromagnetic ordering due to\nEu2+ magnetic moments below TN = 5.6 K. This compound shows a giant\nmagnetocaloric effect around its Neel temperature. The isothermal magnetic\nentropy change is 49 Jkg-1K-1, the adiabatic temperature change is 21 K and the\nrefrigeration capacity is 500 JKg-1 for a field change of 7 T at TN. The single\ncrystal and polycrystalline samples show similar values of the magnetic entropy\nchange and adiabatic temperature changes. The large magnetocaloric effect is\ndue to suppression of the spin entropy associated with localized 4f moment of\nEu2+ ions. The giant magnetocaloric effect together with negligible hysteresis,\nsuggest that EuTiO3 could be a potential material for magnetic refrigeration\nbelow 20 K.\n", "  We present a lattice Boltzmann study of the hydrodynamics of a fully resolved\nsquirmer, radius R, confined in a slab of fluid between two no-slip walls. We\nshow that the coupling between hydrodynamics and short-range repulsive\ninteractions between the swimmer and the surface can lead to hydrodynamic\ntrapping of both pushers and pullers at the wall, and to hydrodynamic\noscillations in the case of a pusher. We further show that a pusher moves\nsignificantly faster when close to a surface than in the bulk, whereas a puller\nundergoes a transition between fast motion and a dynamical standstill according\nto the range of the repulsive interaction. Our results critically require\nnear-field hydrodynamics; they further suggest that it should be possible to\ncontrol density and speed of squirmers at a surface by tuning the range of\nsteric and electrostatic swimmer-wall interactions.\n", "  Deterministic enhancement of the superconducting (SC) critical temperature\n$T_c$ is a long-standing goal in material science. One strategy is engineering\na material at the nanometer scale such that quantum confinement strengthens the\nelectron pairing, thus increasing the superconducting energy gap $\\Delta$, as\nwas observed for individual nanoparticles. A true phase-coherent SC condensate,\nhowever, can exist only on larger scales and requires a finite phase stiffness\n$J$. In the case of coupled aluminium (Al) nanograins, $T_c$ can exceed that of\nbulk Al by a factor of three, but despite several proposals the relevant\nmechanism at play is not yet understood. Here we use optical spectroscopy on\ngranular Al to disentangle the evolution of the fundamental SC energy scales,\n$\\Delta$ and $J$, as a function of grain coupling. Starting from well-coupled\narrays, $\\Delta$ grows with progressive grain decoupling, causing the\nincreasing of $T_c$. As the grain-coupling is further suppressed, $\\Delta$\nsaturates while $T_c$ decreases, concomitantly with a sharp decline of $J$.\nThis crossover to a phase-driven SC transition is accompanied by an optical gap\npersisting above $T_c$. These findings identify granular Al as an ideal\nplayground to test the basic mechanisms that enhance superconductivity by\nnano-inhomogeneity.\n", "  In this paper we seek to demonstrate the predictability of stock market\nreturns and explain the nature of this return predictability. To this end, we\nintroduce investors with different investment horizons into the news-driven,\nanalytic, agent-based market model developed in Gusev et al. (2015). This\nheterogeneous framework enables us to capture dynamics at multiple timescales,\nexpanding the model's applications and improving precision. We study the\nheterogeneous model theoretically and empirically to highlight essential\nmechanisms underlying certain market behaviors, such as transitions between\nbull- and bear markets and the self-similar behavior of price changes. Most\nimportantly, we apply this model to show that the stock market is nearly\nefficient on intraday timescales, adjusting quickly to incoming news, but\nbecomes inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a long-lasting\nnonlinear impact on dynamics, attributable to a feedback mechanism acting over\nthese horizons. Then, using the model, we design algorithmic strategies that\nutilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the only input to trade on\nmarket return forecasts over multiple horizons, from days to months. The\nbacktested results suggest that the return is predictable to the extent that\nsuccessful trading strategies can be constructed to harness this\npredictability.\n", "  The superconducting phase of hydrogen sulfide at Tc=200 K observed by Drozdov\nand collaborators at pressures around 200 GPa is simple bcc Im-3m H3S,\npredicted beforehand by Duan {\\it et al.}, has experimental confirmation. The\nvarious \"extremes\" that are involved -- pressure, implying extreme reduction of\nvolume, extremely high H phonon energy scale around 1500K, extremely high\ntemperature for a superconductor -- necessitates a close look at new issues\nraised by these characteristics in relation to high Tc. We use first principles\nmethods to analyze the H3S electronic structure, particularly the van Hove\nsingularities (vHs) and the effect of sulfur. Focusing on the two closely\nspaced vHs near the Fermi level that give rise to the impressively sharp peak\nin the density of states, the implications of strong coupling Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory are assessed. The electron spectral density smearing due to virtual\nphonon emission and absorption needs to be included explicitly to obtain\naccurate theoretical predictions and current understanding. Means for\nincreasing Tc in H3S-like materials are addressed.\n", "  The eigenfunctions of the Two-Rotors Model are superpositions of states\ncorresponding to precessions of the rotors around two orthogonal axes. In\nNuclear Physics such an entanglement has not been directly confirmed. We\ndiscuss how it might be observed and compare with the application of the TRM to\nsingle domain nanoparticles. In the latter case, in addition to the present\nindirect evidence there is the possibility of direct observation in experiments\nat temperatures of the order of 1 K.\n", "  The quantized lateral motional states and the spin states of electrons\ntrapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed as basic\nbuilding blocks of a scalable quantum computer. Circuit quantum electrodynamics\n(cQED) allows strong dipole coupling between electrons and a high-Q\nsuperconducting microwave resonator, enabling such sensitive detection and\nmanipulation of electron degrees of freedom. Here we present the first\nrealization of a hybrid circuit in which a large number of electrons are\ntrapped on the surface of superfluid helium inside a coplanar waveguide\nresonator. The high finesse of the resonator allows us to observe large\ndispersive shifts that are many times the linewidth and make fast and sensitive\nmeasurements on the collective vibrational modes of the electron ensemble, as\nwell as the superfluid helium film underneath. Furthermore, a large ensemble\ncoupling is observed in the dispersive regime during experiment, and it shows\nexcellent agreement with our numeric model. The coupling strength of the\nensemble to the cavity is found to be >1 MHz per electron, indicating the\nfeasibility of achieving single electron strong coupling.\n", "  The physical properties of CsNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ were characterized by\nelectrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat measurements. We found\nthat the stoichiometric CsNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ compound is a superconductor with a\ntransition temperature \\textit{T$_{c}$}=2.7K. A large Sommerfeld coefficient\n$\\gamma$$_{n}$ ($\\sim$77.90 mJ/mol$\\cdot$K$^{-2}$), was obtained from the\nnormal state electronic specific heat. However, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of\nCsNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ was estimated to be about 0.041$\\times$10$^{-5}$\n$\\mu\\Omega$$\\cdot$cm(mol$\\cdot$K/mJ)$^{2}$, indicating the absence of strong\nelectron-electron correlations in this compound. In the superconducting state,\nwe found that the zero-field electronic specific heat data, $C_{es}(T)$ (0.5K\n$\\leq$ T $<$ 2.6K), can be well fitted with a two-gap BCS model. The comparison\nwith the results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested\nthat the large $\\gamma$$_{n}$ in the nickel-selenide superconductors may be\nrelated to the large Density of States (DOS) at the fermi surface.\n", "  The photoneutron source (PNS, phase 1), an electron linear accelerator\n(linac)-based pulsed neutron facility that uses the time-of-flight (TOF)\ntechnique, was constructed for the acquisition of nuclear data from the thorium\nmolten salt reactor(TMSR) at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP).\nThe neutron detector signal, with the information on the pulse arrival time,\npulse shape, and pulse height, was recorded by using a waveform digitizer\n(WFD). By using the pulse height and pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) analysis\nto identify neutrons and $\\gamma$-rays, the neutron TOF spectrum was obtained\nby employing a simple electronic design, and a new WFD-based DAQ system was\ndeveloped and tested in this commissioning experiment. The developed DAQ system\nis characterized by a very high efficiency with respect to millisecond neutron\nTOF spectroscopy\n", "  We consider asymptotics of the correlation functions of characteristic\npolynomials corresponding to random weighted $G(n, \\frac{p}{n})$ Erd{\\H o}s --\nR\\'enyi graphs with Gaussian weights in the case of finite $p$ and also when $p\n\\to \\infty$. It is shown that for finite $p$ the second correlation function\ndemonstrates a kind of transition: when $p < 2$ it factorizes in the limit $n\n\\to \\infty$, while for $p > 2$ there appears an interval $(-\\lambda_*(p),\n\\lambda_*(p))$ such that for $\\lambda_0 \\in (-\\lambda_*(p), \\lambda_*(p))$ the\nsecond correlation function behaves like that for GUE, while for $\\lambda_0$\noutside the interval the second correlation function is still factorized. For\n$p \\to \\infty$ there is also a threshold in the behavior of the second\ncorrelation function near $\\lambda_0 = \\pm 2$: for $p \\ll n^{2/3}$ the second\ncorrelation function factorizes, whereas for $p \\gg n^{2/3}$ it behaves like\nthat for GUE. For any rate of $p \\to \\infty$ the asymptotics of correlation\nfunctions of any even order for $\\lambda_0 \\in (-2, 2)$ coincide with that for\nGUE.\n", "  A measurement of vector boson ($V$) production in conjunction with a\n$D^{*}(2010)^+$ meson is presented. Using a data sample corresponding to $9.7\\,\n{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of ^Mproton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}=1.96\\rm~ TeV$ produced by the Fermilab Tevatron, we reconstruct\n$V+D^{*+}$ samples with the CDF~II detector. The $D^{*+}$ is fully\nreconstructed in the $D^{*}(2010)^+ \\rightarrow D^{0}(\\to K^-\\pi^+)\\pi^+$ decay\nmode. This technique is sensitive to the associated production of vector boson\nplus charm or bottom mesons. We measure the ratio of production cross sections\n$\\sigma(W+D^{*})/\\sigma(W)$ = $[1.75\\pm 0.13 {\\rm (stat)}\\pm 0.09 {\\rm\n(syst)}]\\% $ and $\\sigma(Z+D^{*})/\\sigma(Z)$ = $[1.5\\pm 0.4 {\\rm (stat)} \\pm\n0.2 {\\rm (syst)}]\\% $ and perform a differential measurement of\n$d\\sigma(W+D^{*})/dp_T(D^{*})$. Event properties are utilized to determine the\nfraction of $V+D^{*}(2010)^+$ events originating from different production\nprocesses. The results are in agreement with the predictions obtained with the\n{\\sc pythia} program, limiting possible contribution from non-standard-model\nphysics processes.\n", "  We show that the fully polarized triplet s-wave component is characterized\nnot only by the spin direction, but also by chirality. Interaction of a\npolarized triplet component and a singlet one results in creation of triplet\nCooper pairs with opposite spin direction or of different chiralities. Such\nspin transformation leads to interesting phenomena in multiterminal magnetic\nJosephson junctions. We calculate the dc Josephson current $I_{\\text{J}}$ in a\nmultiterminal Josephson contact of the S$_{\\text{m}}$/n/S$_{\\text{m}}^{\\prime}$\ntype with \"magnetic\" superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$ that generate fully\npolarized triplet components. The superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$ are attached\nto magnetic insulators (filters) which let to pass electrons with a fixed spin\ndirection only. The filter axes are assumed to be oriented antiparallel to each\nother. The Josephson current is zero in two-terminal Josephson junction, i.e.,\nin S/n/S$_{\\text{m}}$ or in S$_{\\text{m}}$/n/S$_{\\text{m}}^{\\prime}$ contact.\nBut in the three-terminal Josephson junction, with another S superconductor\nattached to the normal wire, the finite current $I_{\\text{J}}$ appears flowing\nfrom the S~superconductor to S$_{\\text{m}}$ superconductors. The currents\nthrough the right (left) superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$ are opposite in sign,\n${I_{\\text{R}} \\equiv I_{\\text{J}} = I_{\\text{c}} \\sin (\\chi_{\\text{R}} +\n\\chi_{\\text{L}} - 2 \\chi) = - I_{\\text{L}}}$, where $\\chi_{\\text{L/R}}$ and\n$\\chi$ are the phases of superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$,\nS$_{\\text{m}}^{\\prime}$, and S, respectively. We discuss possibilities of\nexperimental observation of the effect.\n", "  We consider the defect production of a quantum system, initially prepared in\na current-carrying non-equilibrium state, during its unitary driving through a\nquantum critical point. At low values of the initial current, the quantum\nKibble-Zurek scaling for the production of defects is recovered. However, at\nlarge values of the initial current, i.e., very far from an initial equilibrium\nsituation, a universal scaling of the defect production is obtained which shows\nan algebraic dependence with respect to the initial current value. These\nscaling predictions are demonstrated by the exactly solvable Ising quantum\nchain where the current-carrying state is selected through the imposition of a\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction term.\n", "  Simplified models are a successful way of interpreting current LHC searches\nfor models beyond the standard model (BSM). So far simplified models have\nfocused on topologies featuring a missing transverse energy (MET) signature.\nHowever, in some BSM theories other, more exotic, signatures occur. If a\ncharged particle becomes long-lived on collider time scales - as it is the case\nin parts of the SUSY parameter space - it leads to a very distinct signature.\nWe present an extension of the computer package SModelS which includes\nsimplified models for heavy stable charged particles (HSCP). As a physical\napplication we investigate the CMSSM stau co-annihilation strip containing\nlong-lived staus, which presents a potential solution to the Lithium problem.\nApplying both MET and HSCP constraints we show that, for low values of\n$\\tan\\beta$, all this region of parameter space either violates Dark Matter\nconstraints or is excluded by LHC searches.\n", "  Elastic scattering of electron vortex beams on magnetic materials leads to a\nweak magnetic contrast due to Zeeman interaction of orbital angular momentum of\nthe beam with magnetic fields in the sample. The magnetic signal manifests\nitself as a redistribution of intensity in diffraction patterns due to a change\nof sign of the orbital angular moment. While in the atomic resolution regime\nthe magnetic signal is most likely under the detection limits of present\ntransmission electron microscopes, for electron probes with high orbital\nangular momenta, and correspondingly larger spatial extent, its detection is\npredicted to be feasible.\n", "  It is found that identical bosons (fermions) show generalized bunching\n(antibunching) property in linear networks: The absolute maximum (minimum) of\nprobability that all $N$ input particles are detected in a subset of\n$\\mathcal{K}$ output modes of any nontrivial linear $M$-mode network is\nattained \\textit{only} by completely indistinguishable bosons (fermions). For\nfermions $\\mathcal{K}$ is arbitrary, for bosons it is either ($i$) arbitrary\nfor only classically correlated bosons or ($ii$) satisfies $\\mathcal{K}\\ge N$\n(or $\\mathcal{K}=1$) for arbitrary input states of $N$ particles. The\ngeneralized bunching allows to certify in a \\textit{polynomial} in $N$ number\nof runs that a physical device realizing Boson Sampling with \\textit{an\narbitrary} network operates in the regime of full quantum coherence compatible\n\\textit{only} with completely indistinguishable bosons. The protocol needs\n\\textit{only polynomial} classical computations for the standard Boson\nSampling, whereas an \\textit{analytic formula} is available for the scattershot\nversion.\n", "  We have investigated the effect of epitaxial strain on the magnetic\nproperties and $B$-site cation ordering in multiferroic Bi$_2$FeCrO$_6$ (001)\nthin films using a density-functional theory approach. We find that in thin\nfilms with rock-salt ordering of Fe and Cr the ground state is characterised by\nC-type anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) order. This is in contrast to the bulk form of\nthe material which was predicted to be a ferrimagnet with G-type AFM order.\nFurthermore, the cation ordered thin-films undergo a transition with epitaxial\nstrain from C to A-type AFM order. Other magnetic orders appear as thermally\naccessible excited states. We also find that $B$-site cation disordered\nstructures are more stable in coherent epitaxial strains thereby explaining the\nlowered magnetic moments observed in these samples at room temperature. Strain\nvaries both the sign as well as strength of the Fe-Cr superexchange coupling\nresulting in a very interesting phase diagram for Bi$_2$FeCrO$_6$ thin films.\n", "  We discuss the potential of Athena X-ray telescope, in particular of its\nX-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), for detection of the signal from the\nlight-weight decaying dark matter with mass in the keV range. We show that high\nenergy resolution and large collection area of X-IFU will provide an\nimprovement of sensitivity which will be sufficient for the full test of the\nneutrino Minimal extension of the Standard Model (nuMSM). Search for the narrow\nspectral line produced by the decay of the dark matter sterile neutrino in the\nspectra of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with X-IFU will explore the whole allowed\nrange masses and mixing angles of the nuMSM lightest sterile neutrino and in\nthis way either to find the dark matter signal or rule out the nuMSM model.\n", "  The separation of the Weyl nodes in a broken time-reversal symmetric Weyl\nsemimetal leads to helical quasi-particle excitations at the Weyl nodes, which,\nwhen coupled with overall spin conservation allows only inter-nodal transport\nat the junction of the Weyl semimetal with a superconductor. This leads to an\nunusual periodic oscillation in the Josephson current as a function of $k_0L$,\nwhere $L$ is the length of the Weyl semimetal and $2k_0$ is the inter-nodal\ndistance. This oscillation is robust and should be experimentally measurable,\nproviding a direct path to confirming the existence of chiral nodes in the Weyl\nsemimetal.\n", "  A study of fusion-evaporation and (partly) fusion-fission channels for the\n$^{88}$Mo compound nucleus, produced at different excitation energies in the\nreaction $^{48}$Ti + $^{40}$Ca at 300, 450 and 600 MeV beam energies, is\npresented. Fusion-evaporation and fusion-fission cross sections have been\nextracted and compared with the existing systematics. Experimental data\nconcerning light charged particles have been compared with the prediction of\nthe statistical model in its implementation in the Gemini++ code, well suited\neven for high spin systems, in order to tune the main model parameters in a\nmass region not abundantly covered by exclusive experimental data.\nMultiplicities for light charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation events\nare also presented. Some discrepancies with respect to the prediction of the\nstatistical model have been found for forward emitted $\\alpha$-particles; they\nmay be due both to pre-equilibrium emission and to reaction channels (such as\nDeep Inelastic Collisions, QuasiFission/QuasiFusion) different from the\ncompound nucleus formation.\n", "  We study linearized equations of a ghost-free gravity in four- and\nhigher-dimensional spacetimes. We consider versions of such a theory where the\nnonlocal modification of the $\\Box$ operator has the form $\\Box\n\\exp[(-\\Box/\\mu^2)^N]$, where $N=1$ or $N=2n$. We first obtain the Newtonian\ngravitational potential for a point mass for such models and demonstrate that\nit is finite and regular in any number of spatial dimensions $d\\ge 3$. The\nsecond result of the paper is calculation of the gravitational field of an\nultrarelativistic particle in such theories. And finally, we study a head-on\ncollision of two ultrarelativistic particles. We formulated conditions of the\napparent horizon formation and showed that there exists a mass gap for\nmini-black-hole production in the ghost-free theory of gravity. In the case\nwhen the center-of-mass energy is sufficient for the formation of the apparent\nhorizon, the latter has two branches, the outer and the inner ones. When the\nenergy increases the outer horizon tends to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini\nlimit, while the inner horizon becomes closer to $r=0$.\n", "  Motivated by the task of understanding microscopic dynamics of an evolving\nblack hole, we present a scheme describing gauge-fixed continuous time\nevolution of quantum gravitational processes in asymptotically flat spacetime\nusing the algebra of CFT operators. This allows us to study the microscopic\ndynamics of the Hawking emission process, although obtaining a full S-matrix\nmay require a modification of the minimal scheme. The role of the operator\nproduct expansion is to physically interpret the resulting time evolution by\ndecomposing the Hilbert space of the states for the entire system into those\nfor smaller subsystems. We translate the picture of an evaporating black hole\npreviously proposed by the authors into predictions for nonperturbative\nproperties of the CFTs that have weakly coupled dual gravitational\ndescriptions. We also discuss a possible relationship between the present\nscheme and a reference frame change in the bulk.\n", "  Nonassociative generalization of supersymmetry is suggested. 3- and 4-point\nassociators for supersymmetric generators are considered. On the basis of zero\nJacobiators for three supersymmetric generators, we have obtained the simplest\nform of 3-point associators. The connection between 3- and 4-point associators\nis considered. On the basis of this connection, 4-point associators are\nobtained. The Jacobiators for the product of four supersymmetric generators are\ncalculated. We discuss the possible physical meaning of numerical coefficients\npresented on the right-hand sides of associators. The possible connection\nbetween supersymmetry, hidden variables, and nonassociativity is discussed.\n", "  We seek wormholes among rotating cylindrically symmetric configurations in\ngeneral relativity. Exact wormhole solutions are presented with such sources of\ngravity as a massless scalar field, a cosmological constant, and a scalar field\nwith an exponential potential. However, none of these solutions are\nasymptotically flat, which excludes the existence of wormhole entrances as\nlocal objects in our Universe. To overcome this difficulty, we try to build\nconfigurations with flat asymptotic regions using the cut-and-paste procedure:\non both sides of the throat, a wormhole solution is matched to a properly\nchosen region of flat space-time at some surfaces $\\Sigma_-$ and $\\Sigma_+$. It\nis shown, however, that if the source of gravity in the throat region is a\nscalar field with an arbitrary potential, then one or both thin shells\nappearing on $\\Sigma_-$ and $\\Sigma_+$ inevitably violate the null energy\ncondition. Thus, although rotating wormhole solutions are easily found without\nexotic matter, such matter is still necessary for obtaining asymptotic\nflatness.\n", "  The existing solutions to the Einstein equations describing rotating\ncylindrical wormholes are not asymptotically flat and therefore cannot describe\nwormhole entrances as local objects in our Universe. To overcome this\ndifficulty, flat asymptotic regions are added to wormhole solutions by matching\nthem at some surfaces $\\Sigma_-$ and $\\Sigma_+$. It is shown, however, that if\nthe wormhole solution is obtained for scalar fields with arbitrary potentials,\npossibly interacting with an azimuthal electric or magnetic field, then the\nmatter content of one or both thin shells appearing on $\\Sigma_-$ and\n$\\Sigma_+$ violate the Null Energy Condition. Thus exotic matter is still\nnecessary for obtaining a twice asymptotically flat wormhole.\n", "  We derive complementarity relations for arbitrary quantum states of\nmultiparty systems, of arbitrary number of parties and dimensions, between the\npurity of a part of the system and several correlation quantities, including\nentanglement and other quantum correlations as well as classical and total\ncorrelations, of that part with the remainder of the system. We subsequently\nuse such a complementarity relation, between purity and quantum mutual\ninformation in the tripartite scenario, to provide a bound on the secret key\nrate for individual attacks on a quantum key distribution protocol.\n", "  We consider a simplified model for Majorana fermion dark matter and explore\nconstraints from direct, indirect and LHC collider searches. The dark matter is\nassumed to couple to the Standard Model through a vector mediator with\naxial-vector interactions. We provide detailed analyses of LHC mono-jet\nsearches and IceCube limits on dark matter annihilation in the Sun. In\nparticular, we develop a method for calculating limits on simplified WIMP dark\nmatter models from public IceCube data, which are only available for a limited\nnumber of Standard Model final states. We demonstrate that LHC and IceCube\nsearches for Majorana dark matter are complementary and derive new limits on\nthe dark matter and mediator masses, including in addition constraints from LHC\ndi-jet searches, direct detection and the dark matter relic density.\n", "  We present three-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of binary neutron\nstar (BNS) mergers from the late stage of the inspiral process up to $\\sim 20$\nms after the system has merged, either to form a hyper-massive neutron star\n(NS) or a rotating black hole (BH). We investigate five equal-mass models of\ntotal gravitational mass $2.207$, $2.373$, $2.537$, $2.697$ and $2.854\nM_\\odot$, respectively, and four unequal mass models with\n$M_{\\mathrm{ADM}}\\simeq 2.53\\ M_\\odot$ and $q\\simeq 0.94$, $0.88$, $0.82$, and\n$0.77$ (where $q = M^{(1)}/M^{(2)}$ is the mass ratio). We use a semi-realistic\nequation of state (EOS) namely, the seven-segment piece-wise polytropic SLyPP\nwith a thermal component given by $\\Gamma_{th} = 1.8$. We have also compared\nthe resulting dynamics (for one model) using both, the BSSN-NOK and CCZ4\nmethods for the evolution of the gravitational sector, and also different\nreconstruction methods for the matter sector, namely PPM, WENO and MP5. Our\nresults show agreement and high resolution, but superiority of BSSN-NOK\nsupplemented by WENO reconstruction at lower resolutions.\n  One of the important characteristics of the present investigation is that,\nfor the first time, this has been done using only publicly available open\nsource software, in particular, the Einstein Toolkit code deployed for the\ndynamical evolution and the LORENE code for the generation of the initial\nmodels. All of the source code and parameters used for the simulations have\nbeen made publicly available. This not only makes it possible to re-run and\nre-analyze our data; it also enables others to directly build upon this work\nfor future research.\n", "  We investigate the generic aspects of quantum coherence guided by the\nconcentration of measure phenomenon. We find the average relative entropy of\ncoherence of pure quantum states sampled randomly from the uniform Haar measure\nand show that it is typical, i.e., the probability that the relative entropy of\ncoherence of a randomly chosen pure state is not equal to the average relative\nentropy of coherence (within an arbitrarily small error) is exponentially small\nin the dimension of the Hilbert space. We find the dimension of a random\nsubspace of the total Hilbert space such that all pure states that reside on it\nalmost always have at least a fixed nonzero amount of the relative entropy of\ncoherence that is arbitrarily close to the typical value of coherence. Further,\nwe show, with high probability, every state (pure or mixed) in this subspace\nalso has the coherence of formation at least equal to the same fixed nonzero\namount of the typical value of coherence. Thus, the states from these random\nsubspaces can be useful in the relevant coherence consuming tasks like\ncatalysis in the coherence resource theory. Moreover, we calculate the expected\ntrace distance between the diagonal part of a random pure quantum state and the\nmaximally mixed state, and find that it does not approach to zero in the\nasymptotic limit. This establishes that randomly chosen pure states are not\ntypically maximally coherent (within an arbitrarily small error). Additionally,\nwe find the lower bound on the relative entropy of coherence for the set of\npure states whose diagonal parts are at a fixed most probable distance from the\nmaximally mixed state.\n", "  A simple extension of the Standard Model (SM), based on the gauge group\n$SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(3)_L\\otimes U(1)_Y$ with $Y$ being the hypercharge, is\nconsidered. We show that, by imposing an approximate global $SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R$ custodial symmetry at the SM energy scale, the $Z-Z'$ mixing is absent\nat tree level and the value of the $\\rho$ parameter can be kept close to one.\nTree-level flavor-changing neutral currents are also reduced to three\nparticles, namely $Z'$, a CP-odd Higgs and a CP-even Higgs. The model predicts\nnew leptons with electric charges of $\\pm 1/2e$ and new quarks with $\\pm 1/6e$\ncharges as well as new gauge and scalar bosons with $\\pm 1/2e$ charges.\nElectric charge conservation requires that one of them must be stable. Their\nmasses are unfortunately free parameters.\n", "  We introduce an alternative scheme for creating topological polaritons\n(topolaritons) by exploiting the presence of photonic Dirac cones in photonic\ncrystals with triangular lattice symmetry. As recently proposed, topolariton\nstates can emerge from a coupling between photons and excitons combined with a\nperiodic exciton potential and a magnetic field to open up a topological gap.\nWe show that in photonic crystals the opening of the gap can be substantially\nsimplified close to photonic Dirac points. Coupling to Zeeman-split excitons\nbreaks time reversal symmetry and allows to gap out the Dirac cones in a\nnon-trival way, leading to a topological gap similar to the strength of the\nperiodic exciton potential. Compared to the original topolariton proposal\n[Karzig {\\em et al}, PRX {\\bf 5}, 031001 (2015)], this scheme significantly\nincreases the size of the topological gap over a wide range of parameters.\nMoreover, the gap opening mechanism highlights an interesting connection\nbetween topolaritons and the Haldane and Raghu scheme [Haldane and Raghu, PRL\n{\\bf 100}, 013904 (2008)] to create topological photons in magneto-optically\nactive materials.\n", "  We present a systematic study of both the temperature and frequency\ndependence of the optical response in TaAs, a material that has recently been\nrealized to host the Weyl semimetal state. Our study reveals that the optical\nconductivity of TaAs features a narrow Drude response alongside a conspicuous\nlinear dependence on frequency. The width of the Drude peak decreases upon\ncooling, following a $T^{2}$ temperature dependence which is expected for Weyl\nsemimetals. Two linear components with distinct slopes dominate the 5-K optical\nconductivity. A comparison between our experimental results and theoretical\ncalculations suggests that the linear conductivity below $\\sim$230~cm$^{-1}$ is\na clear signature of the Weyl points lying in very close proximity to the Fermi\nenergy.\n", "  We construct explicit examples of globally regular static, spherically\nsymmetric solutions in general relativity with scalar and electromagnetic\nfields, describing traversable wormholes with flat and AdS asymptotics and\nregular black holes, in particular, black universes. (A black universe is a\nregular black hole with an expanding, asymptotically isotropic space-time\nbeyond the horizon.) Such objects exist in the presence of scalar fields with\nnegative kinetic energy (\"phantoms\", or \"ghosts\"), which are not observed under\nusual physical conditions. To account for that, we consider what we call\n\"trapped ghosts\" (scalars whose kinetic energy is only negative in a\nstrong-field region of space-time) and \"invisible ghosts\", i.e., phantom scalar\nfields sufficiently rapidly decaying in the weak-field region. The resulting\nconfigurations contain different numbers of Killing horizons, from zero to\nfour.\n", "  We develop the stub model for the Dirac Quantum Dot, an electron confining\ndevice on a grapheme surface. Analytical results for the average conductance\nand the correlation functions are obtained and found in agreement with those\nfound previously using semiclassical calculation. Comparison with available\ndata are presented. The results reported here demonstrate the applicability of\nRandom Matrix Theory in the case of Dirac electrons confined in a stadium.\n", "  We present high-resolution spectroscopy of Rb$_\\text{2}$ ultralong-range\nRydberg molecules bound by mixed singlet-triplet electron-neutral atom\nscattering. The mixing of the scattering channels is a consequence of the\nhyperfine interaction in the ground-state atom, as predicted recently by\nAnderson et al. \\cite{Anderson2014b}. Our experimental data enables the\ndetermination of the effective zero-energy singlet $s$-wave scattering length\nfor Rb. We show that an external magnetic field can tune the contributions of\nthe singlet and the triplet scattering channels and therefore the binding\nenergies of the observed molecules. This mixing of molecular states via the\nmagnetic field results in observed shifts of the molecular line which differ\nfrom the Zeeman shift of the asymptotic atomic states. Finally, we calculate\nmolecular potentials using a full diagonalization approach including the\n$p$-wave contribution and all orders in the relative momentum $k$, and compare\nthe obtained molecular binding energies to the experimental data.\n", "  We present a factorization formula for the inclusive production of the Higgs\nboson at large transverse momentum $P_T$ that includes all terms with the\nleading power of $1/P_T^2$. The cross section is factorized into convolutions\nof parton distributions, infrared-safe hard-scattering cross sections for\nproducing a parton, and fragmentation functions that give the distribution of\nthe longitudinal momentum fraction of the Higgs relative to the fragmenting\nparton. The infrared-safe cross sections and the fragmentation functions are\nperturbatively calculable. The most important fragmentation functions are those\nfor which the fragmenting parton is the top quark, gluon, $W$, $Z$, and the\nHiggs itself. We calculate the fragmentation functions at leading order in the\nStandard Model coupling constants. The factorization formula enables the\nresummation of large logarithms of $P_T/M_H$ due to final-state radiation by\nintegrating evolution equations for the fragmentation functions. By comparing\nthe cross section for the process $q\\bar{q}\\to H t\\bar t$ from the\nleading-power factorization formula at leading order in the coupling constants\nwith the complete leading-order cross section, we infer that the error in the\nfactorization formula decreases to less than 5\\% for $P_T>600$ GeV at a future\n$100$ TeV collider.\n", "  A cosmological analysis considering the inclusion of dark energy and dark\nmatter cosmic components in the context of some particular cases for\nintersecting S-brane solutions is presented and discussed. Direct solution of\n$d$-dim field equations and dimensional reduction processes, are implemented\nfor the pure dark energy and dark energy with dark matter cosmological\nscenarios, respectively. In the first case, explicit expressions and evolution\nfor $d$-dim scale factors are founded and studied. Secondly, a low energy\neffective $4$-dim model is obtained analytically and their resulting field\nequations are solved numerically. The role of internal space geometry is always\na central element of our analysis. In some intersecting cases and under certain\nconsiderations, a suitable late-time cosmic acceleration description is founded\nand an adequate behavior for scale factor $a(t)$ and realistic values for dark\nenergy $\\Omega_{DE}$ and dark matter $\\Omega_{DM}$ relative energy densities\nare obtained as well. As a result, we do specifically obtain late-time cosmic\nacceleration in one scenario where our universe makes part either of an\nSM2$\\bot$SM2 or an SM2$\\bot$SM5 intersection. This could give rise to further\npossible configurations where late-time cosmic acceleration is present.\n", "  Object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the impact of\nvarying dose rate and grain size up to a dose of 1.0 dpa in pure,\npolycrystalline tungsten, subjected to a neutron irradiation having a PKA\nspectrum corresponding to the High Flux Isotope Reactor. The present study\nmodels defect cluster accumulation in tungsten, but does not consider the\nimpact of transmutation or pre-existing defects beyond the grain boundary\nsinks, with varying grain size. With increasing dose rate, the vacancy cluster\ndensity increases, while the number density of vacancies decreases.\nAccordingly, the average vacancy cluster size and the fraction of vacancies\nthat are part of visible clusters decreases with increasing dose rate. With\nincreasing grain size, both the number densities of vacancies and vacancy\nclusters decrease, while both the fraction of vacancies in visible clusters and\nthe average vacancy cluster size increase. This is caused by the\npseudo-ripening of the vacancy clusters due to the longer-lived\nself-interstitial clusters in larger grains. The spatial ordering of vacancy\nclusters along {110} planes was observed for both grain sizes and all dose\nrates studied. Interplanar spacing increases with grain size; however, no clear\ndependence on dose or dose rate was observed. The results of this study show\nthat 1D diffusion of self-interstitial clusters, while necessary, is not\nsufficient to form a void lattice, and that the diffusion of vacancies is also\nrequired. A methodology is suggested for choosing the simulation box dimensions\nso as to represent more faithfully the effects of one-dimensional migrating\nself-interstitial-atom clusters.\n", "  We generalize the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to periodically driven\nsystems using Floquet theory. The method is applied to the periodically driven,\nstrongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, for which we identify two regimes\nresulting in different effective low-energy Hamiltonians. In the nonresonant\nregime, we realize an interacting spin model coupled to a static gauge field\nwith a nonzero flux per plaquette. In the resonant regime, where the Hubbard\ninteraction is a multiple of the driving frequency, we derive an effective\nHamiltonian featuring doublon association and dissociation processes. The\nground state of this Hamiltonian undergoes a phase transition between an\nordered phase and a gapless Luttinger liquid phase. One can tune the system\nbetween different phases by changing the amplitude of the periodic drive.\n", "  We report on an implementation of the multiconfigurational time-dependent\nHartree method (MCTDH) for spin-polarized fermions (MCTDHF). Our approach is\nbased on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and\nefficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations\nof motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive\nimplementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB,\nthe present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark\nthe accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a\ntime-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically\ntrapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We\ndemonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion\nSchr\\\"odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can\nhence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with\ntime-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the\nproblem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling\nthrough a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model\nproposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic\nparticles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109,\n13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from\nsequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic\nmomenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped\nsubsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the\ndifferent chemical potentials into kinetic energy. Using the two-body\ncorrelation function, we present a detailed picture of the sequentiality of the\nprocess and are able to tell tunneling from over-the-barrier escape.\n", "  Seamless connection of molecular nanonetworks to macroscale cyber networks is\nenvisioned to enable the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, which promises for\ncutting-edge applications, especially in the medical domain. The connection\nrequires the development of an interface between the biochemical domain of\nmolecular nanonetworks and the electrical domain of conventional\nelectromagnetic networks. To this aim, in this paper, we propose to exploit\nfield effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs) to devise a molecular\nantenna capable of transducing molecular messages into electrical signals. In\nparticular, focusing on the use of SiNW FET-based biosensors as molecular\nantennas, we develop deterministic and noise models for the antenna operation\nto provide a theoretical framework for the optimization of the device from\ncommunication perspective. We numerically evaluate the performance of the\nantenna in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the electrical output.\n", "  The claim some years ago, contrary to all textbooks, that the angular\nmomentum of a photon (and gluon) can be split in a gauge-invariant way into an\norbital and spin term, sparked a major controversy in the Particle Physics\ncommunity. A further cause of upset was the realization that the gluon\npolarization in a nucleon, a supposedly physically meaningful quantity,\ncorresponds only to the gauge-variant gluon spin derived from Noether's\ntheorem, evaluated in a particular gauge. On the contrary, Laser Physicists\nhave, for decades, been happily measuring physical quantities which correspond\nto orbital and spin angular momentum evaluated in a particular gauge. This\npaper reconciles the two points of view.\n", "  The coupling between the electromagnetic and gravitational fields results in\n\"faster than light\" photons and invalids the Lorentz invariance and some laws\nof physics. A typical example is that the first and third laws of geometric\noptics are invalid in the usual spacetime. By introducing an effective\nspacetime, we find that the wave vector can be casted into null and then it\nobeys the geodesic equation, the polarization vector is perpendicular to the\nrays, and the number of photons is conserved. That is to say, the laws of\ngeometric optics are still valid for the modified theory in the effective\nspacetime. We also show that the focusing theorem of light rays for the\nmodified theory in the effective spacetime takes the same form as usual.\n", "  We implement a proper-time UV regularisation of the Nambu-Goto string,\nintroducing an independent metric tensor and the corresponding Lagrange\nmultiplier, and treating them in the mean-field approximation justified for\nlong strings and/or when the dimensions of space-time is large. We compute the\nregularised determinant of the 2d Laplacian for the closed string winding\naround a compact dimension, obtaining in this way the effective action, whose\nminimisation determines the energy of the string ground state in the mean-field\napproximation. We discuss the existence of two scaling limits when the cutoff\nis taken to infinity. One scaling limit reproduces the results obtained by the\nhypercubic regularisation of the Nambu-Goto string as well as by the use of the\ndynamical triangulation regularisation of the Polyakov string. The other\nscaling limit reproduces the results obtained by canonical quantisation of the\nNambu-Goto string.\n", "  A co-dimension one critical surface in the momentum space can be either a\nfamiliar Fermi surface, which separates occupied states from empty ones in the\nnon-interacting fermion case, or a novel Bose surface, where gapless bosonic\nexcitations are anchored. Their presence gives rise to logarithmic violation of\nentanglement entropy area law. When they are convex, we show that the shape of\nthese critical surfaces can be determined by inspecting the leading logarithmic\nterm of real space entanglement entropy. The fundamental difference between a\nFermi surface and a Bose surface is revealed by the fact that the logarithmic\nterms in entanglement entropies differ by a factor of two: $S^{Bose}_{log} = 2\nS^{Fermi}_{log}$, even when they have identical geometry. Our method has\nremarkable similarity with determining Fermi surface shape using quantum\noscillation. We also discuss possible probes of concave critical surfaces in\nmomentum space.\n", "  The resonance-continuum interference is usually neglected when the width of a\nresonance is small compared to the resonance mass. We re-examine this standard\nby studying the interference effects in high-resolution decay channels,\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ and $ZZ$, of the heavy Higgs boson $H^0$ in nearly aligned\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models. For the $H^0$ with a sub-percent width-to-mass ratio,\nwe find that, in the parameter space where the LHC 14 TeV $ZZ$ resonance search\ncan be sensitive, the interference effects can modify the $ZZ$ signal rate by\n${\\cal O}(10)\\%$ and the exclusion reach by ${\\cal O}(10)$ GeV. In other\nparameter space where the $ZZ$ or $\\gamma\\gamma$ signal rate is smaller, the\nLHC 14 TeV reach is absent, but a resonance shape can be much more dramatically\nchanged. In particular, the $\\gamma\\gamma$ signal rate can change by ${\\cal\nO}(100)\\%$. Relevant to such parameter space, we suggest variables that can\ncharacterize a general resonance shape. We also illustrate the relevance of the\nwidth on the interference by adding non-standard decay modes of the heavy Higgs\nboson.\n", "  We present a complete phenomenological prospectus for thermal relic\nneutralinos. Including Sommerfeld enhancements to relic abundance and halo\nannihilation calculations, we obtain direct, indirect, and collider discovery\nprospects for all neutralinos with mass parameters $M_1,M_2,|\\mu| < 4$ TeV,\nthat freeze out to the observed dark matter abundance, with scalar\nsuperpartners decoupled. Much of the relic neutralino sector will be uncovered\nby the direct detection experiments Xenon1T and LZ, as well as indirect\ndetection with CTA. We emphasize that thermal relic higgsinos will be found by\nnext-generation direct detection experiments, so long as $M_{1,2} < 4$ TeV.\nCharged tracks at a 100 TeV hadron collider complement indirect searches for\nrelic winos. Thermal relic bino-winos still evade all planned experiments,\nincluding disappearing charged-track searches. However, they can be discovered\nby compressed electroweakino searches at a 100 TeV collider, completing the\nfull coverage of the relic neutralino surface.\n", "  At the epoch of decoupling, cosmic baryons had supersonic velocities relative\nto the dark matter that were coherent on large scales. These velocities\nsubsequently slow the growth of small-scale structure and, via feedback\nprocesses, can influence the formation of larger galaxies. We examine the\neffect of streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including\nall leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on\nthe BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of ~5) over the results of\nprevious investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a\ngalaxy retains memory of the primordial streaming velocity, it does so at its\nLagrangian, rather than Eulerian, position. Since correlations in the streaming\nvelocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a\nsignificant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact\ntracer density at the 1% level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO\nscale is shifted by approximately 0.5%. This new effect, which is required to\npreserve Galilean invariance, greatly increases the importance of including\nstreaming velocities in the analysis of upcoming BAO measurements and opens a\nnew window to the astrophysics of galaxy formation.\n", "  Binary hydrides formed by the pnictogens of phosphorus, arsenic and antimony\nare studied at high pressures using first principles methods. Stable structures\nare predicted and their electronic, vibrational and superconducting properties\nare investigated. We predict that SbH$_{4}$ and AsH$_{8}$ will be\nhigh-temperature superconductors at megabar pressures, with critical\ntemperatures in excess of 100 K. The highly symmetric hexagonal SbH$_{4}$ phase\nis predicted to be stabilized above about 150 GPa, which is readily achievable\nin diamond anvil cell experiments. We find that all phosphorus hydrides are\nmetastable with respect to decomposition into the elements within the pressure\nrange studied. Trends based on our results and literature data reveal a\nconnection between the high-pressure behaviors and ambient-pressure chemical\nquantities which provides insight into understanding which elements may form\nhydrogen-rich high-temperature superconducting phases at high pressures.\n", "  Manipulation of the domain wall propagation in magnetic wires is a key\npractical task for a number of devices including racetrack memory and magnetic\nlogic. Recently, curvilinear effects emerged as an efficient mean to impact\nsubstantially the statics and dynamics of magnetic textures. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the curvilinear form of the exchange interaction of a magnetic\nhelix results in an effective anisotropy term and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya\ninteraction with a complete set of Lifshitz invariants for a one-dimensional\nsystem. In contrast to their planar counterparts, the geometrically induced\nmodifications of the static magnetic texture of the domain walls in magnetic\nhelices offer unconventional means to control the wall dynamics relying on\nspin-orbit Rashba torque. The chiral symmetry breaking due to the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to the opposite directions of the\ndomain wall motion in left- or right-handed helices. Furthermore, for the\nmagnetic helices, the emergent effective anisotropy term and\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can be attributed to the clear geometrical\nparameters like curvature and torsion offering intuitive understanding of the\ncomplex curvilinear effects in magnetism.\n", "  In this paper, we derive the standard model with classical conformal\ninvariance from the Yang--Mills--Higgs model in noncommutative geometry (NCG).\nIn the ordinary context of the NCG, the {\\it distance matrix} $M_{nm}$ which\ncorresponds to the vacuum expectation value of Higgs fields is taken to be\nfinite. However, since $M_{nm}$ is arbitrary in this formulation, we can take\nall $M_{nm}$ to be zero. In the original composite scheme, the Higgs field\nitself vanishes with the condition $M_{nm} = 0$. Then, we adopt the elemental\nscheme, in which the gauge and the Higgs bosons are regarded as elemental\nfields. By these assumptions, all scalars do not have vevs at tree level. The\nsymmetry breaking mechanism will be implemented by the Coleman--Weinberg\nmechanism.\n  As a result, we show a possibility to solve the hierarchy problem in the\ncontext of NCG. Unfortunately, the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism does not work in\nthe SM Higgs sector, because the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential becomes\nunbounded from below for $m_{t} > m_{Z}$. However, viable models can be\npossible by proper extensions.\n", "  A new method of analysing positive bistochastic maps on the algebra of\ncomplex matrices $M_{3}$ has been proposed. By identifying the set of such maps\nwith a convex set of linear operators on $\\mathbb{R}^{8}$, one can employ\ntechniques from the theory of compact affine semigroups to obtain results\nconcerning asymptotic properties of positive maps. It turns out that the\nidempotent elements play a crucial role in classifying the convex set into\nsubsets, in which representations of extremal positive maps are to be found. It\nhas been show that all positive bistochastic maps, extremal in the set of all\npositive maps of $M_{3}$, that are not Jordan isomorphisms of $M_3$ are\nrepresented by matrices that fall into two possible categories, determined by\nthe simplest idempotent matrices: one by the zero matrix, and the other by a\none dimensional orthogonal projection. Some norm conditions for matrices\nrepresenting possible extremal maps have been specified and examples of maps\nfrom both categories have been brought up, based on the results published\npreviously.\n", "  Half Metal Magnets are of great interest in the field of spintronics because\nof their potential full spin-polarization at the Fermi level and low\nmagnetization damping. The high Curie temperature and predicted 0.7eV minority\nspin gap make the Heusler alloy Co2MnSi very promising for applications.We\ninvestigated the half-metallic magnetic character of this alloy using\nspin-resolved photoemission, ab initio calculation and ferromagnetic resonance.\nAt the surface of Co2MnSi, a gap in the minority spin channel is observed,\nleading to 100% spin polarization. However, this gap is 0.3 eV below the Fermi\nlevel and a minority spin state is observed at the Fermi level. We show that a\nminority spin gap at the Fermi energy can nevertheless be recovered either by\nchanging the stoichiometry of the alloy or by covering the surface by Mn, MnSi\nor MgO. This results in extremely small damping coefficients reaching values as\nlow as 7x 10-4.\n", "  We complete the study of a class of string-motivated effective supergravity\ntheories in which modulus-induced soft supersymmetry breaking is sufficiently\nsuppressed in the observable sector so as to be competitive with\nanomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Here we consider deflected mirage\nmediation (DMM), where contributions from gauge mediation are added to those\narising from gravity mediation and anomaly mediation. We update previous work\nthat surveyed the rich parameter space of such theories, in light of data from\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recent dark matter detection\nexperiments. Constraints arising from LHC superpartner searches at $\\sqrt{s} =\n8\\,{\\rm TeV}$ are considered, and discovery prospects at $\\sqrt{s} = 14\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ are evaluated. We find that deflected mirage mediation generally allows\nfor SU(3)-charged superpartners of significantly lower mass (given current\nknowledge of the Higgs mass and neutralino relic density) than was found for\nthe `pure' mirage mediation models of Kachru et al. Consequently, discovery\nprospects are enhanced for many combinations of matter multiplet modular\nweights. We examine the experimental challenges that will arise due to the\nprospect of highly compressed spectra in DMM, and the correlation between\naccessibility at the LHC and discovery prospects at large-scale liquid xenon\ndark matter detectors.\n", "  We study amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from wavelength-scale composite\nbodies--complicated arrangements of active and passive media--demonstrating\nhighly directional and tunable radiation patterns, depending strongly on pump\nconditions, materials, and object shapes. For instance, we show that under\nlarge enough gain, $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric dielectric spheres radiate mostly\nalong either active or passive regions, depending on the gain distribution. Our\npredictions are based on a recently proposed fluctuating volume--current (FVC)\nformulation of electromagnetic radiation that can handle inhomogeneities in the\ndielectric and fluctuation statistics of active media, e.g. arising from the\npresence of non-uniform pump or material properties, which we exploit to\ndemonstrate an approach to modelling ASE in regimes where Purcell effect (PE)\nhas a significant impact on the gain, leading to spatial dispersion and/or\nchanges in power requirements. The nonlinear feedback of PE on the active\nmedium, captured by the Maxwell--Bloch equations but often ignored in linear\nformulations of ASE, is introduced into our linear framework by a\nself-consistent renormalization of the (dressed) gain parameters, requiring the\nsolution of a large system of nonlinear equations involving many linear\nscattering calculations.\n", "  In this paper, we explicitly evaluate the one-shot quantum non-signalling\nassisted zero-error classical capacities $\\M_0^{\\mathrm{QNS}}$ for qubit\nchannels. In particular, we show that for nonunital qubit channels,\n$\\M_0^{\\mathrm{QNS}}=1$, which implies that in the one-shot setting, nonunital\nqubit channels cannot transmit any information with zero probability of error\neven when assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations. Furthermore, we show\nthat for qubit channels, $\\M_0^{\\mathrm{QNS}}$ equals to the one-shot\nentanglement-assisted zero-error classical capacities. This means that for a\nsingle use of a qubit channel, quantum non-signalling correlations are not more\npowerful than shared entanglement.\n", "  Background: Elastic scattering is probably the main event in the interactions\nof nucleons with nuclei. Even if this process has been extensively studied in\nthe last years, a consistent description, i.e. starting from microscopic two-\nand many-body forces connected by the same symmetries and principles, is still\nunder development.\n  Purpose: In this work we study the domain of applicability of microscopic\ntwo-body chiral potentials in the construction of an optical potential.\n  Methods: We basically follow the KMT approach to build a microscopic complex\noptical potential and then we perform some test calculations on 16O at\ndifferent energies.\n  Results: Our conclusion is that a particular set of potentials with a\nLippmann-Schwinger cutoff at relatively high energies (above 500 MeV) has the\nbest performances reproducing the scattering observables.\n  Conclusions: Our work shows that building an optical potential within Chiral\nPerturbation Theory is a promising approach to the description of elastic\nproton scattering, in particular, in view of the future inclusion of many-body\nforces that naturally arise in such framework.\n", "  In this work we consider translation-bounded measures over a locally compact\nAbelian group $\\mathbb{G}$, with particular interest for their so-called\ndiffraction. Given such a measure $\\Lambda$, its diffraction $\\widehat{\\gamma}$\nis another measure on the Pontryagin dual $\\widehat{\\mathbb{G}}$, whose\ndecomposition into the sum $\\widehat{\\gamma} = \\widehat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{p}}+\n\\widehat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of its atomic and continuous parts is central in\ndiffraction theory. The problem we address here is whether the above\ndecomposition of $\\widehat{\\gamma}$ lifts to $\\Lambda$ itself, that is to say,\nwhether there exists a decomposition $\\Lambda = \\Lambda _{\\mathrm{p}} + \\Lambda\n_{\\mathrm{c}}$, where $\\Lambda _{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $\\Lambda _{\\mathrm{c}}$ are\ntranslation-bounded measures having diffraction $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{p}}$\nand $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ respectively. Our main result here is the\nalmost sure existence, in a sense to be made precise, of such a decomposition.\nIt will also be proved that a certain uniqueness property holds for the above\ndecomposition. Next we will be interested in the situation where\ntranslation-bounded measures are weighted Meyer sets. In this context, it will\nbe shown that the decomposition, whether it exists, also consists of weighted\nMeyer sets. We complete this work by discussing a natural generalization of the\nconsidered problem.\n", "  We find, by an appropriate extension of the standard holographic\nsuperconductor setup, static bulk solutions which describe holographic duals to\nnon-Abelian vortices. In the core of these vortices a scalar field condenses,\nbreaking a non-Abelian global symmetry which leads to additional zero modes\ncalled orientational moduli. These moduli appear in the bulk as Goldstone\nbosons associated to the condensation of a neutral scalar field.\n", "  Algebraic connectivity, the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, is a\nmeasure of node and link connectivity on networks. When studying interconnected\nnetworks it is useful to consider a multiplex model, where the component\nnetworks operate together with inter-layer links among them. In order to have a\nwell-connected multilayer structure, it is necessary to optimally design these\ninter-layer links considering realistic constraints. In this work, we solve the\nproblem of finding an optimal weight distribution for one-to-one inter-layer\nlinks under budget constraint. We show that for the special multiplex\nconfigurations with identical layers, the uniform weight distribution is always\noptimal. On the other hand, when the two layers are arbitrary, increasing the\nbudget reveals the existence of two different regimes. Up to a certain\nthreshold budget, the second eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian is simple, the\noptimal weight distribution is uniform, and the Fiedler vector is constant on\neach layer. Increasing the budget past the threshold, the optimal weight\ndistribution can be non-uniform. The interesting consequence of this result is\nthat there is no need to solve the optimization problem when the available\nbudget is less than the threshold, which can be easily found analytically.\n", "  In this paper we determine the phase diagrams (for $T=0$ as well as $T>0$) of\nthe Penson-Kolb-Hubbard model for two dimensional square lattice within\nHartree-Fock mean-field theory focusing on investigation of superconducting\nphases and possibility of the occurrence of the phase separation. We obtain\nthat the phase separation, which is a state of coexistence of two different\nsuperconducting phases (with $s$-wave and $\\eta$-wave symmetries), occurs in\ndefine range of the electron concentration. In addition, increasing temperature\ncan change the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter (from\n$\\eta$-wave into $s$-wave). The system considered exhibits also an interesting\nmulticritical behaviour including bicritical points.\n", "  We study the $\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry breaking for the scattering problem in\na one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian tight-binding lattice model with balanced\ngain and loss distributed on two adjacent sites. In the scattering process the\nsystem undergoes a transition from the exact $\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry phase to\nthe phase with spontaneously breaking $\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry as the amplitude\nof complex potentials increases. Using the S-matrix method, we derive an exact\ndiscriminant, which can be used to distinguish different symmetry phases, and\nanalytically determine the exceptional point for the symmetry breaking. In the\n$\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry breaking region, we also confirm the appearance of the\nunique feature, i.e., the coherent perfect absorption Laser, in this simple\nnon-Hermitian lattice model. The study of the scattering problem of such a\nsimple model provides an additional way to unveil the physical effect of\nnon-Hermitian $\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetric potentials.\n", "  Vector Galileons are ghost-free systems containing higher derivative\ninteractions of vector fields. They break the vector gauge symmetry, and the\ndynamics of the longitudinal vector polarizations acquire a Galileon symmetry\nin an appropriate decoupling limit in Minkowski space. Using an ADM approach,\nwe carefully reconsider the coupling with gravity of vector Galileons, with the\naim of studying the necessary conditions to avoid the propagation of ghosts. We\ndevelop arguments that put on a more solid footing the results previously\nobtained in the literature. Moreover, working in analogy with the scalar\ncounterpart, we find indications for the existence of a `beyond Horndeski'\ntheory involving vector degrees of freedom, that avoids the propagation of\nghosts thanks to secondary constraints. In addition, we analyze a Higgs\nmechanism for generating vector Galileons through spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, and we present its consistent covariantisation.\n", "  New data are reported from the operation of the PICO-60 dark matter detector,\na bubble chamber filled with 36.8 kg of CF$_3$I and located in the SNOLAB\nunderground laboratory. PICO-60 is the largest bubble chamber to search for\ndark matter to date. With an analyzed exposure of 92.8 livedays, PICO-60\nexhibits the same excellent background rejection observed in smaller bubble\nchambers. Alpha decays in PICO-60 exhibit frequency-dependent acoustic\ncalorimetry, similar but not identical to that reported recently in a\nC$_3$F$_8$ bubble chamber. PICO-60 also observes a large population of unknown\nbackground events, exhibiting acoustic, spatial, and timing behaviors\ninconsistent with those expected from a dark matter signal. These behaviors\nallow for analysis cuts to remove all background events while retaining\n$48.2\\%$ of the exposure. Stringent limits on weakly interacting massive\nparticles interacting via spin-dependent proton and spin-independent processes\nare set, and most interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal as dark\nmatter interacting with iodine nuclei are ruled out.\n", "  One possible framework to interpret the irreversibility transition observed\nin periodically driven colloidal suspensions is that of a non-equilibrium phase\ntransition towards an absorbing reversible state at low amplitude of the\ndriving force. We consider a simple numerical model for driven suspensions\nwhich allows us to characterize in great detail a large body of physical\nobservables that can be experimentally determined to assess the existence and\nuniversality class of such a non-equilibrium phase transition. Characterizing\nthe behaviour of static and dynamic correlation functions both in real and\nFourier space we determine in particular several critical exponents for our\nmodel, which take values that are in good agreement with the universality class\nof direct ed percolation. We also provide a detailed analysis of\nsingle-particle and collective dynamics of the system near the phase\ntransition, which appear intermittent and spatially correlated over diverging\ntimescales and lengthscales, and provide clear signatures of the underlying\ncriticality.\n", "  [abridged] We present a strong-lensing analysis of MACSJ0717.5+3745, based on\nthe full depth of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) observations, which brings\nthe number of multiply imaged systems to 61, ten of which are spectroscopically\nconfirmed. The total number of images comprised in these systems rises to 165.\nOur analysis uses a parametric mass reconstruction technique, as implemented in\nthe Lenstool software, to constrain a mass distribution composed of four\nlarge-scale mass components + galaxy-scale perturbers. We find a superposition\nof cored isothermal mass components to provide a good fit to the observational\nconstraints, resulting in a very shallow mass distribution for the smooth\n(large-scale) component. Given the implications of such a flat mass profile, we\ninvestigate whether a model composed of \"peaky\" non-cored mass components can\nalso reproduce the observational constraints. We find that such a non-cored\nmass model reproduces the observational constraints equally well. Although the\ntotal mass distributions of both models are consistent, as well as the\nintegrated two dimensional mass profiles, we find that the smooth and the\ngalaxy-scale components are very different. We conclude that, even in the HFF\nera, the generic degeneracy between smooth and galaxy-scale components is not\nbroken, in particular in such a complex galaxy cluster. Consequently, insights\ninto the mass distribution of MACS J0717 remain limited, underlining the need\nfor additional probes beyond strong lensing. Our findings also have\nimplications for estimates of the lensing magnification: we show that the\namplification difference between the two models is larger than the error\nassociated with either model. This uncertainty decreases the area of the image\nplane where we can reliably study the high-redshift Universe by 50 to 70%.\n", "  Recently it was shown that the WAC model for liquid silica [L. V. Woodcock,\nC. A. Angell, and P. Cheeseman, J. Chem. Phys. 65, 1565 (1976)] is remarkably\nclose to having a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP). We demonstrate that\nincreasing the ion charge separates the global maxima of the response\nfunctions, while reducing the charge smoothly merges them into a LLCP; a\nphenomenon that might be experimentally observable with charged colloids. An\nanalysis of the Si and O coordination numbers suggests that a sufficiently low\nSi/O coordination number ratio is needed to attain a LLCP.\n", "  The coupled quark Dyson-Schwinger and meson Bethe-Salpeter equations in\nrainbow-ladder truncation for spin-0 mesons are solved in Wigner-Weyl phase in\nthe chiral limit and beyond, retaining only the ultraviolet finite terms of the\nphenomenologically most successful Maris-Tandy interaction. This allows to\nreveal and discuss the scalar and pseudoscalar meson masses in a chirally\nsymmetric setting without additional medium effects. Independent of the\ncurrent-quark mass, the found solutions are spacelike, i.\\,e.\\ have negative\nsquared masses. The current-quark mass dependence of meson masses, leptonic\ndecay constants and chiral condensate are illustrated in Wigner-Weyl phase.\n", "  We develop a description of tidal effects in astrophysical systems using\neffective field theory techniques. While our approach is equally capable of\ndescribing objects in the Newtonian regime (e.g. moons, rocky planets, main\nsequence stars, etc.) as well as relativistic objects (e.g. neutron stars and\nblack holes), in this paper we focus special attention on the Newtonian regime.\nIn this limit, we recover the dynamical equations for the \"weak friction model\"\nwith additional corrections due to tidal and rotational deformations.\n", "  We identify a new, flux-dependent correction to the antineutrino spectrum as\nproduced in nuclear reactors. The abundance of certain nuclides, whose decay\nchains produce antineutrinos above the threshold for inverse beta decay, has a\nnonlinear dependence on the neutron flux, unlike the vast majority of\nantineutrino producing nuclides, whose decay rate is directly related to the\nfission rate. We have identified four of these so-called nonlinear nuclides and\ndetermined that they result in an antineutrino excess at low-energies below\n3.2MeV, dependent on the reactor thermal neutron flux. We develop an analytic\nmodel for the size of the correction and compare it to the results of detailed\nreactor simulations for various real existing reactors, spanning 3 orders of\nmagnitude in neutron flux. In a typical pressurized water reactor the resulting\ncorrection can reach 0.9% of the low energy flux which is comparable in size to\nother, known low-energy corrections from spent nuclear fuel and the\nnon-equilibrium correction. For naval reactors the nonlinear correction may\nreach the 10% level.\n", "  The entanglement renormalization flow of a (1+1) free boson is formulated as\na path integral over some auxiliary scalar fields. The resulting effective\ntheory for these fields amounts to the dilaton term of non-critical string\ntheory in two spacetime dimensions. A connection between the scalar fields in\nthe two theories is provided, allowing to acquire novel insights into how a\ntheory of gravity emerges from the entanglement structure of another one\nwithout gravity.\n", "  The importance of additive manufacturing (AM) to the future of product design\nand manufacturing systems demands educational programs tailored to embrace its\nfundamental principles and its innovative potential. Moreover, the breadth and\ndepth of AM spans several traditional disciplines, presenting a challenge to\ninstructors yet giving the opportunity to integrate knowledge via creative and\nchallenging projects. This paper presents our approach to teaching AM at the\ngraduate and advanced undergraduate level, in the form of a 15-week course\ndeveloped and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The lectures\nbegin with in-depth technical analysis of the major AM processes. In lab\nsessions, students operate and characterize desktop AM machines, and work in\nteams to design and fabricate a bridge having maximum strength per unit weight\nwhile conforming to geometric constraints. To conclude the semester, teams\ncreated prototype machines for printing molten glass, soft serve ice cream,\nbiodegradable material, and carbon fiber composites, as well as for large area\nparallel extrusion and for in situ optical scanning during printing. We\nconclude that AM education, while arguably rooted in mechanical engineering, is\ntruly multidisciplinary, and that education programs must embrace this context.\n", "  We study the density of states in disordered s-wave superconductors with a\nsmall gap anisotropy. Disorder comes in the form of common nonmagnetic\nscatterers and pairing-potential impurities, which interact with electrons via\nan electric potential and a local distortion of the superconducting gap. A set\nof equations for the quasiclassical Green functions is derived and solved.\nWithin one spin sector, pairing-potential impurities and weak spin-polarized\nmagnetic impurities have essentially the same effect on the density of states.\nWe show that if the gap is isotropic, an isolated impurity with suppressed\npairing supports an infinite number of Andreev states. With growing impurity\nconcentration, the energy-dependent density of states evolves from a sharp gap\nedge with an impurity band below it to a smeared BCS singularity in the\nso-called universal limit. If a gap anisotropy is present, the density of\nstates becomes sensitive to ordinary potential disorder, and the existence of\nof Andreev states localized at pairing-potential impurities requires special\nconditions. An unusual feature related to the anisotropy is a nonmonotonic\ndependence of the gap edge smearing on impurity concentration.\n", "  Mean Field Games (MFG) provide a theoretical frame to model socio-economic\nsystems. In this letter, we study a particular class of MFG which shows strong\nanalogies with the {\\em non-linear Schr\\\"odinger and Gross-Pitaevski equations}\nintroduced in physics to describe a variety of physical phenomena ranging from\ndeep-water waves to interacting bosons. Using this bridge many results and\ntechniques developed along the years in the latter context can be transferred\nto the former. As an illustration, we study in some details an example in which\nthe \"players\" in the mean field game are under a strong incentive to coordinate\nthemselves.\n", "  Scalar field theory with large infrared initial occupancy develops very large\ndeep-infrared occupancy, which locally resembles a Bose-Einstein condensate. We\nstudy the structure and spatial coherence of this condensate. The O(N)\nsymmetric theory with N>1 is qualitatively different than N=1. We explain the\nthermodynamical reason why, for N>1, the condensate locally carries nearly\nmaximal conserved charge density. We also show how this property impedes the\ncondensate's decay, and we show that it prevents the condensate from ever\nbecoming fully spatially homogeneous. For N <= 4 the condensate can carry\ntopological defects, but these do not appear to control the large-k tail in its\npower spectrum, which is the same for N=8 where there are no topological\ndefects.\n", "  We describe the fissioning dynamics of Pu240 from a configuration in the\nproximity of the outer fission barrier to full scission and the formation of\nthe fragments within an implementation of density functional theory extended to\nsuperfluid systems and real-time dynamics. The fission fragments emerge with\nproperties similar to those determined experimentally, while the fission\ndynamics appears to be quite complex, with many excited shape and pairing\nmodes. The evolution is found to be much slower than previously expected, and\nthe ultimate role of the collective inertia is found to be negligible in this\nfully nonadiabatic treatment of nuclear dynamics, where all collective degrees\nof freedom (CDOF) are included (unlike adiabatic treatments with a small number\nof CDOF).\n", "  After considering the supernova shock effects, the\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effects, the neutrino collective effects, and the\nEarth matter effects, the detection of supernova neutrinos at China Spallation\nNeutron Sources is studied and the event numbers of different flavor supernova\nneutrinos observed through various reaction channels are calculated with the\nneutrino energy spectra described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution and \"beta\nfit\" distribution respectively. Furthermore, the numerical calculation method\nof supernova neutrino detection on the Earth is applied to some other\nspallation neutron sources, and the total event numbers of supernova neutrinos\nobserved through different reactions channels are given.\n", "  We present a formulation of the compositeness for baryonic resonances in\norder to discuss the meson-baryon molecular structure inside the resonances.\nFor this purpose, we derive a relation between the residue of the scattering\namplitude at the resonance pole position and the two-body wave function of the\nresonance in a sophisticated way, and we define the compositeness as the norm\nof the two-body wave functions. As applications, we investigate the\ncompositeness of the $\\Delta (1232)$, $N (1535)$, and $N (1650)$ resonances\nfrom precise $\\pi N$ scattering amplitudes in a unitarized chiral framework\nwith the interaction up to the next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation\ntheory. The $\\pi N$ compositeness for the $\\Delta (1232)$ resonance is\nevaluated in the $\\pi N$ single-channel scattering, and we find that the $\\pi\nN$ component inside $\\Delta (1232)$ in the present framework is nonnegligible,\nwhich supports the previous work. On the other hand, the compositeness for the\n$N (1535)$ and $N (1650)$ resonances is evaluated in a coupled-channels\napproach, resulting that the $\\pi N$, $\\eta N$, $K \\Lambda$ and $K \\Sigma$\ncomponents are negligible for these resonances.\n", "  We propose a transport blockade mechanism in quantum dot arrays and\nconducting molecules based on an interplay of Coulomb repulsion and the\nformation of edge states. As a model we employ a dimer chain that exhibits a\ntopological phase transition. The connection to a strongly biased electron\nsource and drain enables transport. We show that the related emergence of edge\nstates is manifest in the shot noise properties as it is accompanied by a\ncrossover from bunched electron transport to a Poissonian process. For both\nregions we develop a scenario that can be captured by a rate equation. The\nresulting analytical expressions for the Fano factor agree well with the\nnumerical solution of a full quantum master equation.\n", "  Further development of the field of all-electric spintronics requires the\nsuccessful integration of spin transport channels with spin injector/generator\nelements. While with the advent of graphene and related 2D materials high\nperformance spin channel materials are available, the use of nanostructured\nspin generators remains a major challenge. Especially promising for the latter\npurpose are 3D topological insulators, whose 2D surface states host massless\nDirac fermions with spin-momentum locking. Here, we demonstrate injection of\nspin-polarized current from a topological insulator into graphene, enabled by\nits intimate coupling to an ultrathin Bi2Te2Se nanoplatelet within a van der\nWaals epitaxial heterostructure. The spin switching signal, whose magnitude\nscales inversely with temperature, is detectable up to ~15 K. Our findings\nestablish topological insulators as prospective future components of spintronic\ndevices wherein spin manipulation is achieved by purely electrical means.\n", "  Motivated by recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of the quantum\nKagome ice model by Juan Carrasquilla, et al., [Nature Communications 6, 7421\n(2015)], we study the ground state properties of this model on the triangular\nlattice. In the presence of a magnetic field $h$, the Hamiltonian possesses\ncompeting interactions between a $Z_2$-invariant easy-axis ferromagnetic\ninteraction $J_{\\pm\\pm}$ and a frustrated Ising term $J_z$. As in the\nU(1)-invariant model, we obtain four classical distinctive phases, however, the\nclassical phases in the $Z_2$-invariant model are different. They are as\nfollows: a fully polarized (FP) ferromagnet for large $h$, an easy-axis canted\nferromagnet (CFM) with broken $Z_2$ symmetry for small $h$ and dominant\n$J_{\\pm\\pm}$, a {\\it ferrosolid} phase with broken translational and $Z_2$\nsymmetries for small $h$ and dominant $J_{z}$, and two lobes with $m=\\langle\nS_z\\rangle=\\pm 1/6$ for small $h$ and dominant $J_{z}$. We show that quantum\nfluctuations are suppressed in this model, hence the large-$S$ expansion gives\nan accurate picture of the ground state properties. When quantum fluctuations\nare introduced, we show that the {\\it ferrosolid} state is the ground state in\nthe dominant Ising limit at zero magnetic field. It remains robust for\n$J_z\\to\\infty$. With nonzero magnetic field the classical lobes acquire a\nfinite magnetic susceptibility with no $S_z$-order. We present the trends of\nthe ground state energy and the magnetizations. We also present a detail\nanalysis of the CFM.\n", "  We conduct a model-independent effective theory analysis of hypercharged\nfields with various spin structures towards understanding the diboson excess\nfound in LHC run I, as well as possible future anomalies involving $WZ$ and\n$WH$ modes. Within the assumption of no additional physics beyond the standard\nmodel up to the scale of the possible diboson resonance, we show that a\nhypercharged scalar and a spin 2 particle do not have tree-level $WZ$ and $WH$\ndecay channels up to dimension 5 operators, and cannot therefore account for\nthe anomaly, whereas a hypercharged vector is a viable candidate provided we\nalso introduce a $Z'$ in order to satisfy electroweak precision constraints. We\ncalculate bounds on the $Z'$ mass consistent with the Atlas/CMS diboson signals\nas well as electroweak precision data, taking into account both LHC run I and\nII data.\n", "  ARGO-YBJ, located at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Observatory (4300 m a.s.l.,\nTibet, China), is a full coverage air shower array, with an energy threshold of\n300 GeV for gamma-ray astronomy. Most of the recorded events are single front\nshowers, satisfying the trigger requirement of at least 20 particles detected\nin a given time window. However, in 13% of the events, two randomly arriving\nshowers may be recorded in the same time window, and the second one, in\ngenerally smaller, does not need to satisfy the trigger condition. These events\nare called double front shower events. By using these small showers, well under\nthe trigger threshold, the detector primary energy threshold can be lowered to\na few tens of GeV. In this paper, the angular resolution that can be achieved\nwith these events is evaluated by a full Monte Carlo simulation. The ARGO-YBJ\nsensitivity in detecting gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by using double front shower\nevents is also studied for various cutoff energies, time durations, and zenith\nangles of GRBs in the field view of ARGO.\n", "  Quantum metrology protocols allow to surpass precision limits typical to\nclassical statistics. However, in recent years, no-go theorems have been\nformulated, which state that typical forms of uncorrelated noise can constrain\nthe quantum enhancement to a constant factor, and thus bound the error to the\nstandard asymptotic scaling. In particular, that is the case of\ntime-homogeneous (Lindbladian) dephasing and, more generally, all semigroup\ndynamics that include phase covariant terms, which commute with the system\nHamiltonian. We show that the standard scaling can be surpassed when the\ndynamics is no longer ruled by a semigroup and becomes time-inhomogeneous. In\nthis case, the ultimate precision is determined by the system short-time\nbehaviour, which when exhibiting the natural Zeno regime leads to a\nnon-standard asymptotic resolution. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nrelevant noise feature dictating the precision is the violation of the\nsemigroup property at short timescales, while non-Markovianity does not play\nany specific role.\n", "  Honeycomb structure has a natural extension to the three dimensions. Simple\nexamples are hyperhoneycomb and stripy-honeycomb lattices, which are realized\nin $\\beta $-Li$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$ and $\\gamma $-Li$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$, respectively. We\npropose a wide class of three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb lattices which are\nloop-nodal semimetals. Their edge states have intriguing properties similar to\nthe two-dimensional honeycomb lattice in spite of dimensional difference.\nPartial flat bands emerge at the zigzag or beard edge of the 3D honeycomb\nlattice, whose boundary is given by the Fermi loop in the bulk spectrum.\nAnalytic solutions are explicitly constructed for them. On the other hand,\nperfect flat bands emerge in the zigzag-beard edge or when the anisotropy is\nlarge. All these 3D honeycomb lattices become strong topological insulators\nwith the inclusion of the spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, point-nodal\nsemimetals may be realized in the presence of both the antiferromagnetic order\nand the spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  We study the leading-power gluon transverse momentum dependent distributions\n(TMDs) of relevance to the study of asymmetries in the scattering off\ntransversely polarized hadrons. Next-to-leading-order perturbative calculations\nof these TMDs show that at large transverse momentum they have common dynamical\norigins, but that in the limit of small longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ only\none origin remains. We find that in this limit only the dipole-type gluon TMDs\nsurvive and become identical to each other. At small $x$ they are all given by\nthe expectation value of a single Wilson loop inside the transversely polarized\nhadron, the so-called spin-dependent odderon. This universal origin of\ntransverse spin asymmetries at small $x$ is of importance to current and future\nexperimental studies, paving the way to a better understanding of the role of\ngluons in the three-dimensional structure of spin-polarized protons.\n", "  We present the effect of a hydrodynamical wind on the structure and the\nsurface temperature of a vertically self-gravitating magnetized ADAFs using\nself-similar solutions. Also a model for an axisymmetric, steady-state,\nvertically self-gravitating hot accretion flow threaded by a toroidal magnetic\nfield has been formulated. The model is based on $\\alpha-$prescription for\nturbulence viscosity. It is found that the thickness and radial velocity of the\ndisc are reduced significantly as wind gets stronger. In particular, the\nsolutions indicated that the wind and advection have the same effects on the\nstructure of the disc. We also find that in the optically thin ADAF becomes\nhotter by including the wind parameter and the self-gravity parameter.\n", "  We construct self-similar inflow-outflow solutions for a hot\nviscous-resistive accretion flow with large scale magnetic fields that have odd\nsymmetry with respect to the equatorial plane in $B_\\theta$, and even symmetry\nin $B_r$ and $B_\\phi$. Following previous authors, we also assume that the\npolar velocity $v_\\theta$ is nonzero. We focus on four parameters:\n$\\beta_{r0}$, $\\beta_{\\phi0}$ (the plasma beta parameters for associated with\nmagnetic field components at the equatorial plane), the magnetic resistivity\n$\\eta_0$, and the density index $n=-d\\ln\\rho/d\\ln r$. The resulting flow\nsolutions are divided into two parts consisting of an inflow region with a\nnegative radial velocity ($v_r<0$) and an outflow region with $v_r>0$. Our\nresults show that stronger outflows emerge for smaller $\\beta_{r0}$\n($\\le10^{-2}$ for $n>1$) and larger values of $\\beta_{\\phi0}$, $\\eta_0$ and\n$n$.\n", "  Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary stars at cosmological distances\nare promising and powerful cosmological probes, referred to as the GW standard\nsirens. With future GW detectors, we will be able to precisely measure source\nluminosity distances out to a redshift $z\\sim5$. To extract cosmological\ninformation, previously proposed cosmological studies using the GW standard\nsirens rely on source redshift information obtained through an extensive\nelectromagnetic follow-up campaign. However, the redshift identification is\ntypically time consuming and rather challenging. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for cosmology with the GW standard sirens free from the redshift\nmeasurements. Utilizing the anisotropies of the number density and luminosity\ndistances of compact binaries originated from the large-scale structure, we\nshow that, once GW observations will be well established in the future, (i)\nthese anisotropies can be measured even at very high redshifts ($z\\geq 2$),\nwhere the identification of the electromagnetic counterpart is difficult, (ii)\nthe expected constraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity with the Einstein\nTelescope would be comparable to or even better than the other large-scale\nstructure probes at the same epoch, and (iii) the cross-correlation with other\ncosmological observations is found to have high-statistical significance,\nproviding additional cosmological information at very high redshifts.\n", "  Depending on the values of the energy and angular momentum per unit mass in\nthe gas supplied at large radii, inviscid advection-dominated accretion flows\ncan display velocity profiles with either preshock deceleration or preshock\nacceleration. Nakayama has shown that these two types of flow configurations\nare expected to have different stability properties. By employing the Chevalier\n\\& Imamura linearization method and the Nakayama instability boundary\nconditions, we discover that there are regions of parameter space where\ndisks/shocks with outflows can be stable or unstable. In regions of\ninstability, we find that preshock deceleration is always unstable to the\nzeroth mode with zero frequency of oscillation, but is always stable to the\nfundamental mode and overtones. Furthermore, we also find that preshock\nacceleration is always unstable to the zeroth mode and that the fundamental\nmode and overtones become increasingly less stable as the shock location moves\naway from the horizon when the disk half-height expands above $\\sim 12$\ngravitational radii at the shock radius. In regions of stability, we\ndemonstrate the zeroth mode to be stable for the velocity profiles that exhibit\npreshock acceleration and deceleration. Moreover, for models that are linearly\nunstable, our model suggests the possible existence of quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) with ratios 2:3 and 3:5. These ratios are believed to occur\nin stellar and supermassive black hole candidates, for example, in GRS 1915+105\nand Sgr A*, respectively. We expect that similar QPO ratios also exist in\nregions of stable shocks.\n", "  We study thermal transport in strongly disordered, strongly interacting\nquantum field theories without quasiparticles using gauge-gravity duality. We\nanalyze linear perturbations of black holes with broken translational symmetry\nin Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories of gravity. Using general geometric\narguments in the bulk, we derive bounds on thermal conductivity for the dual\ndisordered field theories in one and two spatial dimensions. In the latter\ncase, the thermal conductivity is always non-zero at finite temperature, so\nlong as the dilaton potential is bounded from below. Hence, generic holographic\nmodels make non-trivial predictions about the thermal conductivity in a\nstrongly disordered, strongly coupled metal in two spatial dimensions.\n", "  A two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks subject to vertical tapping\nagainst gravity was experimentally monitored from ordered to disordered\nconfigurations by varying bidispersity. The packing fraction $\\phi$,\ncoordination number $Z$, and an appropriately defined force chain orientational\norder parameter $S$, all exhibit similar sharp transition with small increase\nin disorder. A measurable change in $S$, but not $\\phi~\\&~Z$, was detected\nunder tapping. We find disorder-induced metastability does not show\nconfigurational relaxation, but can be detected via force chain reorientations.\n", "  We make predictions for momentum-integrated elliptic and triangular flow as\nwell as mean transverse momentum for 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions, as planned at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. We use hydrodynamic calculations to predict the\nchange of these observables as the center-of-mass collision energy evolves from\n2.76 TeV to 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair. By using previously measured values as a\nbaseline, we are able to make a robust prediction without relying on a\nparticular model for initial conditions and without precise knowledge of medium\nproperties such as viscosity. Thus, though the predicted changes are small,\nthey can provide a significant test of the current hydrodynamic picture of\nheavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Cold atoms bring new opportunities to study quantum magnetism, and in\nparticular, to simulate quantum magnets with symmetry greater than $SU(2)$.\nHere we explore the topological excitations which arise in a model of cold\natoms on the triangular lattice with $SU(3)$ symmetry. Using a combination of\nhomotopy analysis and analytic field-theory we identify a new family of\nsolitonic wave functions characterised by integer charge ${\\bf Q} = (Q_A, Q_B,\nQ_C)$, with $Q_A + Q_B + Q_C = 0$. We use a numerical approach, based on a\nvariational wave function, to explore the stability of these solitons on a\nfinite lattice. We find that, while solitons with charge ${\\bf Q} = (Q, -Q, 0)$\nare stable, wave functions with more general charge spontaneously decay into\npairs of solitons with emergent interactions. This result suggests that it\ncould be possible to realise a new class of interacting soliton, with no\nclassical analogue, using cold atoms. It also suggests the possibility of a new\nform of quantum spin liquid, with gauge--group U(1)$\\times$U(1).\n", "  We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in 3D Dirac\nsemimetals. Using retarded Green's functions in real space, we obtain and\nanalyze asymptotic expressions for the interaction, with magnetic impurities at\ndifferent distances and relative angle with respect to high symmetry directions\non the lattice. We show that the Fermi velocity anisotropy in these materials\nproduces a strong renormalization of the magnitude of the interaction, as well\nas a correction to the frequency of oscillation in real space. Hybridization of\nthe impurities to different conduction electron orbitals are shown to result in\ninteresting anisotropic spin-spin interactions which can generate spiral spin\nstructures in doped samples.\n", "  In this work we will explore the properties of superconducting surfaces\ndecorated by two-dimensional ferromagnetic adatom lattices. As discovered\nrecently [R\\\"ontynen and Ojanen, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{114}, 236803 (2015)],\nin the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling these systems may support\ntopological superconductivity with complex phase diagrams and high Chern\nnumbers. We show how the long-range hopping nature of the effective low-energy\ntheory generically gives rise to a phase diagram covered by a \\emph{Chern\nmosaic} -- a rich pattern of topological phases with large Chern numbers. We\nstudy different lattice geometries and the dependence of energy gaps and\nabundance of different phases as a function of system parameters. Our findings\nestablish the studied system as one of the richest platforms for topological\nmatter known to date.\n", "  We consider a model of a holographic braneworld universe in which a\ncosmological fluid occupies a 3+1 dimensional brane located at the boundary of\nthe asymptotic AdS$_5$ bulk. We combine the AdS/CFT correspondence and the\nsecond Randall-Sundrum (RSII) model to establish a relationship between the\nRSII braneworld cosmology and the boundary metric induced by the time dependent\nbulk geometry. In the framework of the Friedmann Robertson Walker cosmology we\ndiscuss some physically interesting scenarios involving the RSII and\nholographic braneworlds.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of data and analysis of Giant (G)\nMagnetoresistance (MR) with Current-flow Perpendicular-to-layer-Planes (CPP-MR)\nof magnetic multilayers [F/N]n (n = number of repeats) with alternating\nnanoscale layers of ferromagnetic (F) and non-magnetic (N) metals. GMR, a large\nchange in resistance when an applied magnetic field changes the moment ordering\nof adjacent F-layers from anti-parallel (AP) to parallel (P), was discovered in\n1988 in the Current-flow-in-layer-Planes (CIP) geometry. The CPP-MR has two\nadvantages over the CIP-MR: (1) it allows more direct access to the underlying\nphysics; and (2) it is usually larger, which should be advantageous for\ndevices. When the first CPP-MR data were published in 1991, it was not clear\nwhether electronic transport in GMR multilayers is fully diffusive or at least\npartly ballistic. It was not known whether the properties of layers and\ninterfaces would vary with layer thickness or number. It was not known if the\nCPP-MR would be dominated by scattering within the F-metals or at the F/N\ninterfaces. Nothing was known about: (1) spin-flipping within F-metals,\ncharacterized by a spin-diffusion length, l(F)sf; (2) interface specific\nresistances (AR = area A times resistance R) for N1/N2 interfaces; (3)\ninterface specific resistances and spin-dependent scattering asymmetry at F/N\nand F1/F2 interfaces; and (4) spin-flipping at F/N, F1/F2 and N1/N2 interfaces.\nKnowledge of spin-dependent scattering asymmetries in F-metals and F-alloys,\nand of spin-flipping in N-metals and N-alloys was limited. We show how CPP-MR\nmeasurements have quantified the scattering and spin-flipping parameters that\ndetermine CPP-MR for a wide range of F- and N-metals and alloys and of F/N\npairs. We also review progress in finding techniques and F-alloys and F/N pairs\nto enhance the CPP-MR to make it more competitive for devices.\n", "  The material copper pyrimidine dinitrate (Cu-PM) is a quasi-one-dimensional\nspin system described by the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg antiferromagnet with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Based on numerical results obtained by the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and accompanying\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) experiments we revisit the spin dynamics of this\ncompound in an applied magnetic field. Our calculations for momentum and\nfrequency-resolved dynamical quantities give direct access to the intensity of\nthe elementary excitations at both zero and finite temperature. This allows us\nto study the system beyond the low-energy description by the quantum\nsine-Gordon model. We find a deviation from the Lorentz invariant dispersion\nfor the single-soliton resonance. Furthermore, our calculations only confirm\nthe presence of the strongest boundary bound state previously derived from a\nboundary sine-Gordon field theory, while composite boundary-bulk excitations\nhave too low intensities to be observable. Upon increasing the temperature, we\nfind a temperature-induced crossover of the soliton and the emergence of new\nfeatures, such as interbreather transitions. The latter observation is\nconfirmed by our ESR experiments on Cu-PM over a wide range of the applied\nfield.\n", "  In this paper, we present the proof of superlensing an arbitrary object using\ncomplementary media and we study reflecting complementary media for\nelectromagnetic waves. The analysis is based on the reflecting technique and\nnew results on the compactness, existence, and stability for the Maxwell\nequations with low regularity data.\n", "  We study the decay of a heavy Higgs boson into a light Higgs pair at one loop\nin the singlet extension of the Standard Model. To this purpose, we construct\nseveral renormalization schemes for the extended Higgs sector of the model. We\napply these schemes to calculate the heavy-to-light Higgs decay width at\nnext-to-leading order electroweak accuracy, and demonstrate that certain\nprescriptions lead to gauge-dependent results. We comprehensively examine how\nthe NLO predictions depend on the relevant singlet model parameters, with\nemphasis on the trademark behavior of the quantum effects, and how these change\nunder different renormalization schemes and a variable renormalization scale.\nOnce all present constraints on the model are included, we find mild NLO\ncorrections, typically of few percent, and with small theoretical\nuncertainties.\n", "  Plasmons are commonly interpreted with classical electrodynamics, while\nnonclassical effects may influence the dynamics of plasmon resonances as the\nplasmon confinement is approaching the few--nanometer scale. However, an\nunambiguous approach to quantify the degree of nonclassical dynamics remains.\nWe propose a nonclassical-impact parameter (NCI) to characterize the degree of\nnonclassical effects from an energy perspective, i.e. which fraction of the\ntotal electromagnetic energy is attributed to classical electrodynamic terms\nand which fraction is correspondingly to be assigned to nonclassical degrees of\nfreedom? We show that the NCI relates directly to two fundamental parameters of\nplasmon resonances: the loss function and the quality factor. Guided by the\nNCI, we discuss the nonclassical effects of plasmon waveguiding modes of\nmetallic slab waveguides, and highlight the general features of the\nnonclassical effects at different microscopic levels by contrasting the\nnumerical results from the semi-classical hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM) and\nthe microscopic random-phase approximation (RPA). The formal relation between\nthe HDM and the RPA is also established for metals by exploring the limit of an\ninfinite work function.\n", "  We study one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas mixtures, including\nboth the Bose-Fermi and spin-1/2 Fermi-Fermi mixtures, with weak p-wave\ninteractions between intra-component fermions, and demonstrate that the weak\np-wave interaction can not be omitted in the strongly interacting regime where\nthe strength of p-wave interactions is comparable with the inverse of the\nstrength of strongly repulsive s-wave interactions. While the total density\ndistribution is not sensitive to the weak p-wave interaction, we find that the\np-wave interaction plays an important role in determining the species-dependent\n(or spin-dependent) density distributions and produces significant physical\neffects on the low-energy spin dynamics. We also derive effective spin-exchange\nmodels for strongly interacting quantum gas mixtures with weak p-wave\ninteractions, which indicate that a quantum phase transition from\nanti-ferromagnetic state to ferromagnetic state can be induced by tuning the\nrelative strengths of intra-component and inter-component interactions.\n", "  The effects of phase space deformations on Kalutza-Klein cosmology are\nstudied. The deformation is introduced by modifying the symplectic structure of\nthe minisuperspace variables. In the deformed model, we find an accelerating\nscale factor and therefore infer the existence of an effective cosmological\nconstant from the phase space deformation parameter $\\beta$.\n", "  We study the dimension-6 quark anomalous electroweak couplings in the\nformulation of linearly realized effective Lagrangian. We investigate the\nconstraints on these anomalous couplings from the $pp \\rightarrow W^+W^-$\nprocess in detail at the LHC. With additional kinematic cuts, we find that the\n14 TeV LHC can provide a test of anomalous couplings of $O(0.1-1)\\,{\\rm\nTeV}^{-2}$. The $pp \\rightarrow ZZ/Z\\gamma/\\gamma\\gamma$ processes can provide\na good complement as they are sensitive to those anomalous couplings which do\nnot affect the $pp \\rightarrow W^+W^-$ process. Those processes that only\ncontain anomalous triple vertices, like $p p \\to W^* \\to l \\nu_l$ or $p p \\to\n\\gamma^* / Z^* \\to l^+ l^-$, can improve the sensitivities to\n$O(0.01-0.1)\\,{\\rm TeV}^{-2}$. We also study the kinematic differences between\ndifferent anomalous couplings and discuss the potential of the\n$\\chi^2$-analysis to distinguish them. Finally, we discuss the detection\nability of the possible future 100 TeV proton-proton collider(SPPC), and find\nthat the detection sensitivity is improved by about one order of magnitude\ncompared with the LHC.\n", "  Narrow stellar streams in the Milky Way halo are uniquely sensitive to\ndark-matter subhalos, but many of these subhalos may be tidally disrupted. I\ncalculate the interaction between stellar and dark-matter streams using\nanalytical and $N$-body calculations, showing that disrupting objects can be\ndetected as low-concentration subhalos. Through this effect, we can constrain\nthe lumpiness of the halo as well as the orbit and present position of\nindividual dark-matter streams. This will have profound implications for the\nformation of halos and for direct and indirect-detection dark-matter searches.\n", "  We study novel types of contributions to the partition function of the\nMaxwell system defined on a small compact manifold. These contributions, often\nnot addressed in the perturbative treatment with physical photons, emerge as a\nresult of tunneling transitions between topologically distinct but physically\nidentical vacuum winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to\nthe Casimir pressure, yet to be measured. We argue that this effect is highly\nsensitive to a small external electric field, which should be contrasted with\nthe conventional Casimir effect where the vacuum photons are essentially\nunaffected by any external field. Furthermore, photons will be emitted from the\nvacuum in response to a time-dependent electric field, similar to the dynamical\nCasimir effect in which real particles are radiated from the vacuum due to the\ntime-dependent boundary conditions. We also propose an experimental setup using\na quantum LC circuit to detect this novel effect. We expect physical electric\ncharges to appear on the capacitor plates when the system dimension is such\nthat coherent Aharonov-Bohm phases can be maintained over macroscopically large\ndistances.\n", "  We consider non-equilibrium phenomena in a very simple model that displays a\nzero-temperature first-order phase transition. The quantum Ising model with a\nfour-spin exchange is adopted as a general representative of first-order\nquantum phase transitions that belong to the Ising universality class, such as\nfor instance the order-disorder ferroelectric transitions, and possibly\nfirst-order T = 0 Mott transitions. In particular, we address quantum quenches\nin the exactly solvable limit of infinite connectivity and show that, within\nthe coexistence region around the transition, the system can remain trapped in\na metastable phase, as long as it is spatially homogeneous so that nucleation\ncan be ignored. Motivated by the physics of nucleation, we then study in the\nsame model static but inhomogeneous phenomena that take place at surfaces and\ninterfaces. The first order nature implies that both phases remain locally\nstable across the transition, and with that the possibility of a metastable\nwetting layer showing up at the surface of the stable phase, even at T=0. We\nuse mean-field theory plus quantum fluctuations in the harmonic approximation\nto study quantum surface wetting.\n", "  We demonstrate the usefulness of flavour neutrino masses expressed in terms\nof $M_{ee},M_{e\\mu}$ and $M_{e\\tau}$. The analytical expressions for the\nflavour neutrino masses, mass eigenstates and physical CP-violating Majorana\nphases for texture two zeros are obtained exactly.\n", "  We report the novel preparation of single crystals of tetragonal iron\nsulfide, FeS, which exhibits a nearly ideal tetrahedral geometry with S--Fe--S\nbond angles of 110.2(2) $^\\circ$ and 108.1(2) $^\\circ$. Grown via hydrothermal\nde-intercalation of K${_x}$Fe${_{2-y}}$S${_2}$ crystals under basic and\nreducing conditions, the silver, plate-like crystals of FeS remain stable up to\n200 $^\\circ$C under air and 250 $^\\circ$C under inert conditions, even though\nthe mineral \"mackinawite\" (FeS) is known to be metastable. FeS single crystals\nexhibit a superconducting state below $T_c=4$ K as determined by electrical\nresistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements,\nconfirming the presence of a bulk superconducting state. Normal state\nmeasurements yield an electronic specific heat of 5~mJ/mol-K$^2$, and\nparamagnetic, metallic behavior with a low residual resistivity of\n250~$\\mu\\Omega\\cdot$cm. Magnetoresistance measurements performed as a function\nof magnetic field angle tilted toward both transverse and longitudinal\norientations with respect to the applied current reveal remarkable\ntwo-dimensional behavior. This is paralleled in the superconducting state,\nwhich exhibits the largest known upper critical field $H_{c2}$ anisotropy of\nall iron-based superconductors, with $H_{c2}^{||ab}(0) /\nH_{c2}^{||c}(0)=$(2.75~T)/(0.275~T)=10. Comparisons to theoretical models for\n2D and anisotropic-3D superconductors, however, suggest that FeS is the latter\ncase with a large effective mass anisotropy. We place FeS in context to other\nclosely related iron-based superconductors and discuss the role of structural\nparameters such as anion height on superconductivity.\n", "  We construct a class of stationary and axisymmetric solutions to the 5D\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which describe configurations of charged\nrotating black objects with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. The solutions are\nconstructed by uplifting a vacuum seed solution to six dimensions, performing a\nboost, and a subsequent circle reduction. We investigate the physical\nproperties of the charged solutions, and obtain their general relations to the\nproperties of the vacuum seed. We also derive the gyromagnetic ratio and the\nSmarr-like relations. As particular cases we study three solutions, which\ndescribe a charged rotating black string, a charged rotating black ring on\nKaluza-Klein bubbles, and a superposition of two black holes and a Kaluza-Klein\nbubble.\n", "  In this paper, the instability of layered two-phase flows caused by the\npresence of a soluble surfactant (or a surface active solute) is studied. The\nfluids have different viscosities, but are density matched to focus on\nMarangoni effects. The fluids flow between two flat plates, which are\nmaintained at different solute concentrations. This establishes a constant flux\nof solute from one fluid to the other in the base state. A linear stability\nanalysis is performed, using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods.\nIn the creeping flow regime, Marangoni stresses destabilize the flow, provided\na concentration gradient is maintained across the fluids. One long wave and two\nshort wave Marangoni instability modes arise, in different regions of parameter\nspace. A well-defined condition for the long wave instability is determined in\nterms of the viscosity and thickness ratios of the fluids, and the direction of\nmass transfer. Energy budget calculations show that the Marangoni stresses that\ndrive long and short wave instabilities have distinct origins. The former is\ncaused by interface deformation while the latter is associated with convection\nby the disturbance flow. Consequently, even when the interface is non-deforming\n(in the large interfacial tension limit), the flow can become unstable to short\nwave disturbances. On increasing $Re$, the viscosity-induced interfacial\ninstability comes into play. This mode is shown to either suppress or enhance\nthe Marangoni instability, depending on the viscosity and thickness ratios.\nThis analysis is relevant to applications such as solvent extraction in\nmicrochannels, in which a surface-active solute is transferred between fluids\nin parallel stratified flow. It is also applicable to the thermocapillary\nproblem of layered flow between heated plates.\n", "  We perform a calculation of the cross section for nine reactions induced by\n$\\bar K$ scattering on protons. The reactions studied are $K^-p \\to \\Lambda\n\\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $K^-p \\to \\Sigma^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $K^-p \\to \\Lambda \\pi^0 \\eta$,\n$K^-p \\to \\Sigma^0 \\pi^0 \\eta$, $K^-p \\to \\Sigma^+ \\pi^- \\eta$, $\\bar K^0 p \\to\n\\Lambda \\pi^+ \\eta$, $\\bar K^0 p \\to \\Sigma^0 \\pi^+ \\eta$, $\\bar K^0 p \\to\n\\Sigma^+ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $\\bar K^0 p \\to \\Sigma^+ \\pi^0 \\eta$. We find that in\nthe reactions producing $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ a clear peak for the $f_0(980)$ resonance\nis found, while no trace of $f_0(500)$ appears. Similarly, in the cases of $\\pi\n\\eta$ production a strong peak is found for the $a_0(980)$ resonance, with the\ncharacteristic strong cusp shape. Cross sections and invariant mass\ndistributions are evaluated which should serve, comparing with future data, to\ntest the dynamics of the chiral unitary approach used for the evaluations and\nthe nature of these resonances.\n", "  Near equilibrium, small current fluctuations are described by a Gaussian with\na linear-response variance regulated by the dissipation. Here, we demonstrate\nthat dissipation still plays a dominant role in structuring large fluctuations\narbitrarily far from equilibrium. In particular, we prove a\nlinear-response-like bound on the large deviation function for currents in\nMarkov jump processes. We find that nonequilibrium current fluctuations are\nalways more likely than what is expected from a linear-response analysis. As a\nsmall-fluctuations corollary, we derive a recently-conjectured uncertainty\nbound on the variance of current fluctuations.\n", "  We have investigated the effect of temperature on magnetic properties of\nBi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ (x = 0.00-0.20) multiferroic system.\nUnexpectedly, the coercive fields ($H_{c}$) of this multiferroic system\nincreased with increasing temperature. The coercive fields and remanent\nmagnetization were higher over a wide range of temperatures in sample x = 0.10\ni.e. in sample having composition Bi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_3$\nthan those of x = 0.00 and 0.20 compositions. Therefore, we have carried out\ntemperature dependent magnetization experiments extensively for sample x =\n0.10. The magnetic hysteresis loops at different temperatures exhibit an\nasymmetric shift towards the magnetic field axes which indicate the presence of\nexchange bias effect in this material system. The hysteresis loops were also\ncarried out at temperatures 150 K and 250 K by cooling down the sample from 300\nK in various cooling magnetic fields ($H_{cool}$). The exchange bias field\n($H_{EB}$) values increased with $H_{cool}$ and decreased with temperature. The\n$H_{EB}$ values were tunable by field cooling at temperatures up to 250 K.\n", "  Complex (dusty) plasmas allow experimental studies of various physical\nprocesses occurring in classical liquids and solids by directly observing\nindividual microparticles. A major problem is that the interaction between\nmicroparticles is generally not molecular-like. In this Letter, we propose how\nto achieve a molecular-like interaction potential in laboratory 2D complex\nplasmas. We argue that this principal aim can be achieved by using relatively\nsmall microparticles and properly adjusting discharge parameters. If\nexperimentally confirmed, this will make it possible to employ complex plasmas\nas a model system with an interaction potential resembling that of conventional\nliquids.\n", "  The exchange or geometric cluster algorithm allows us to define a variance\nreduced estimator of the connected two-point function in the presence of a\nbroken Z_2-symmetry. We present first numerical tests for the improved\nBlume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice. We perform simulations for the\ncritical isotherm, the low temperature phase at vanishing external field and,\nfor comparison, also the high temperature phase. For the connected two-point\nfunction a substantial reduction of the variance can be obtained, allowing us\nto compute the correlation length with high precision. Based on these results,\nestimates for various universal amplitude ratios that characterise the\nuniversality class of the three-dimensional Ising model are computed.\n", "  Planned cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments can dramatically\nimprove what we know about neutrino physics, inflation, and dark energy. The\nlow level of noise, together with improved angular resolution, will increase\nthe signal to noise of the CMB polarized signal as well as the reconstructed\nlensing potential of high redshift large scale structure. Projected constraints\non cosmological parameters are extremely tight, but these can be improved even\nfurther with information from external experiments. Here, we examine\nquantitatively the extent to which external priors can lead to improvement in\nprojected constraints from a CMB-Stage IV (S4) experiment on neutrino and dark\nenergy properties. We find that CMB S4 constraints on neutrino mass could be\nstrongly enhanced by external constraints on the cold dark matter density\n$\\Omega_{c}h^{2}$ and the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. If polarization on the\nlargest scales ($\\ell<50$) will not be measured, an external prior on the\nprimordial amplitude $A_{s}$ or the optical depth $\\tau$ will also be\nimportant. A CMB constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom,\n$N_{\\rm eff}$, will benefit from an external prior on the spectral index\n$n_{s}$ and the baryon energy density $\\Omega_{b}h^{2}$. Finally, an external\nprior on $H_{0}$ will help constrain the dark energy equation of state ($w$).\n", "  We report time-of-flight measurements on electrons travelling in quantum-Hall\nedge states. Hot-electron wave packets are emitted one per cycle into edge\nstates formed along a depleted sample boundary. The electron arrival time is\ndetected by driving a detector barrier with a square wave that acts as a\nshutter. By adding an extra path using a deflection barrier, we measure a delay\nin the arrival time, from which the edge-state velocity $v$ is deduced. We find\nthat $v$ follows $1/B$ dependence, in good agreement with the $\\vec{E} \\times\n\\vec{B}$ drift. The edge potential is estimated from the energy-dependence of\n$v$ using a harmonic approximation.\n", "  Gravitational waves are propagating undulations in the spacetime fabric,\nwhich interact very weakly with their environment. In cosmology,\ngravitational-wave distortions are produced by most of the inflationary\nscenarios and their anticipated detection should open a new window to the early\nuniverse. Motivated by the relative lack of studies on the potential\nimplications of gravitational radiation for the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse, we consider its coupling to density perturbations during the\npost-recombination era. We do so by assuming an Einstein-de Sitter background\ncosmology and by employing a second-order perturbation study. At this\nperturbative level and on superhorizon scales, we find that gravitational\nradiation adds a distinct and faster growing mode to the standard linear\nsolution for the density contrast. Given the expected weakness of cosmological\ngravitational waves, however, the effect of the new mode is currently\nsubdominant and it could start becoming noticeable only in the far future.\nNevertheless, this still raises the intriguing possibility that the late-time\nevolution of large-scale density perturbations may be dictated by the\nlong-range (the Weyl), rather than the local (the Ricci) component of the\ngravitational field.\n", "  Long-distance quantum communication through optical fibers is currently\nlimited to a few hundreds of kilometres due to fiber losses. Quantum repeaters\ncould extend this limit to continental distances. Most approaches to quantum\nrepeaters require highly multimode quantum memories in order to reach high\ncommunication rates. The atomic frequency comb memory scheme can in principle\nachieve high temporal multimode storage, without sacrificing memory efficiency.\nHowever, previous demonstrations have been hampered by the difficulty of\ncreating high-resolution atomic combs, which reduces the efficiency for\nmultimode storage. In this article we present a comb preparation method that\nallows one to increase the multimode capacity for a fixed memory bandwidth. We\napply the method to a $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$-doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, in which we\ndemonstrate storage of 100 modes for 51 $\\mu$s using the AFC echo scheme (a\ndelay-line memory), and storage of 50 modes for 0.541 ms using the AFC\nspin-wave memory (an on-demand memory). We also briefly discuss the ultimate\nmultimode limit imposed by the optical decoherence rate, for a fixed memory\nbandwidth.\n", "  We consider an effective field theory description of beyond-quasi-particle\nexcitations aiming to associate the transport properties of the system with the\nspectral density of states. Tuning various properties of the many-particle\ncorrelations, we investigate how the robust microscopic features are translated\ninto the macroscopic observables like shear viscosity and entropy density. The\nliquid-gas crossover is analysed using several examples. A thermal constraint\non the fluidity measure, the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present new spherically symmetric, dyonic soliton and black hole solutions\nof the ${\\mathfrak {su}}(N)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in four-dimensional\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. The gauge field has nontrivial\nelectric and magnetic components and is described by $N-1$ magnetic gauge field\nfunctions and $N-1$ electric gauge field functions. We explore the phase space\nof solutions in detail for ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$ and ${\\mathfrak {su}}(3)$\ngauge groups. Combinations of the electric gauge field functions are monotonic\nand have no zeros; in general the magnetic gauge field functions may have\nzeros. The phase space of solutions is extremely rich, and we find solutions in\nwhich the magnetic gauge field functions have more than fifty zeros. Of\nparticular interest are solutions for which the magnetic gauge field functions\nhave no zeros, which exist when the negative cosmological constant has\nsufficiently large magnitude. We conjecture that at least some of these\nnodeless solutions may be stable under linear, spherically symmetric,\nperturbations.\n", "  Nuclear masses play a fundamental role in understanding how the heaviest\nelements in the Universe are created in the $r$-process. We predict $r$-process\nnucleosynthesis yields using neutron capture and photodissociation rates that\nare based on nuclear density functional theory. Using six Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals based on different optimization protocols, we determine for the\nfirst time systematic uncertainty bands -- related to mass modeling -- for\n$r$-process abundances in realistic astrophysical scenarios. We find that\nfeatures of the underlying microphysics make an imprint on abundances\nespecially in the vicinity of neutron shell closures: abundance peaks and\ntroughs are reflected in trends of neutron separation energy. Further advances\nin nuclear theory and experiments, when linked to observations, will help in\nthe understanding of astrophysical conditions in extreme $r$-process sites.\n", "  Microcavity polaritons in the lasing regime undergo a spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking transition resulting in coherent emission with a well defined\npolarization. The order parameter is thus a vector describing both the laser\nglobal phase and polarization. Using an ultrafast single-shot detection\ntechnique we show that polariton lasing in GaAs-based microcavities presents a\nhigh degree of second order coherence ($g^{(2)}(\\tau=0) \\approx 1$) above\nthreshold, and that the initial polarization is stochastic, taking any possible\ndirection in the Poincar\\'e sphere (linear, elliptical or circular). Once the\npolarization direction is established, subsequent oscillations of the emission\nprobability witness the presence of an intrinsic polarization splitting. Our\nresults show the negligible role of polariton interactions in the total\nemission statistics and in the establishment of the initial polarization.\n", "  This paper is focused on the the variable-range hopping of electrons in\nsemiconductor nanocrystal (NC) films below the critical doping concentration\n$n_c$ at which it becomes metallic. The hopping conductivity is described by\nthe Efros-Shklovskii law which depends on the localization length of electrons.\nWe study how the localization length grows with the doping concentration $n$ in\nthe film of touching NCs. For that we calculate the electron transfer matrix\nelement $t(n)$ between neighboring NCs for two models when NCs touch by small\nfacets or just one point. We study two sources of disorder: variations of NC\ndiameters and random Coulomb potentials originating from random numbers of\ndonors in NCs. We use the ratio of $t(n)$ to the disorder-induced NC level\ndispersion to find the localization length of electrons due to the multi-step\nelastic co-tunneling process. We found three different phases at $n<n_c$\ndepending on the strength of disorder, the material, sizes of NCs and their\nfacets: 1) \"insulator\" where the localization length of electrons increases\nmonotonically with $n$ and 2) \"oscillating insulator\" when the localization\nlength (and the conductivity) oscillates with $n$ from the insulator base and\n3) \"blinking metal\" where the localization length periodically diverges. The\nfirst two phases were seen experimentally and we discuss how one can see the\nmore exotic third one. In all three the localization length diverges at\n$n=n_c$. This allows us to find $n_c$.\n", "  The effective-one-body theory (EOB) describes the conservative dynamics of\ncompact binary systems in terms of an effective Hamiltonian approach. The\nHamiltonian for moderately eccentric motion of two non-spinning compact objects\nin the extreme mass-ratio limit is given in terms of three potentials: $a(v),\n\\bar{d}(v), q(v)$. By generalizing the first law of mechanics for\n(non-spinning) black hole binaries to eccentric orbits, [\\prd{\\bf92}, 084021\n(2015)] recently obtained new expressions for $\\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in terms\nof quantities that can be readily computed using the gravitational self-force\napproach. Using these expressions we present a new computation of the EOB\npotential $q(v)$ by combining results from two independent numerical self-force\ncodes. We determine $q(v)$ for inverse binary separations in the range $1/1200\n\\le v \\lesssim 1/6$. Our computation thus provides the first-ever strong-field\nresults for $q(v)$. We also obtain $\\bar{d}(v)$ in our entire domain to a\nfractional accuracy of $\\gtrsim 10^{-8}$. We find to our results are compatible\nwith the known post-Newtonian expansions for $\\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in the\nweak field, and agree with previous (less accurate) numerical results for\n$\\bar{d}(v)$ in the strong field.\n", "  Organolead trihalide perovskites have drawn substantial interest for\napplications in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices due to their low\nprocessing cost and remarkable physical properties. However, perovskite thin\nfilms still suffer from low carrier mobility, limiting their device performance\nand application potential. Here we report that embedding single-walled carbon\nnanotubes into halide perovskite films can significantly enhance the hole and\nelectron mobilities to record-high values of 595.3 and 108.7 cm2 V-1 s-1,\nrespectively. In the ambipolar phototransistors with such hybrid channels,\nphoto-carriers generated in the light-absorbing perovskite matrix are\ntransported by the carbon nanotubes, leading to ultrahigh detectivity of 6 *\n1014 Jones and responsivity of 1 * 104 A W-1. We find that the perovskite\nprecursor in dimethylformamide solution serve as an excellent stabilizer for\nthe dispersion of carbon nanotubes, which potentially extend the scope of\napplications of perovskites in solution-processed functional composites. The\nunprecedented high performances underscore the perovskite/carbon nanotubes\nhybrids as an emerging class of functional materials in optoelectronic and\nother applications.\n", "  We consider a continuum model of active viscoelastic matter, whereby an\nactive nematic liquid-crystal is coupled to a minimal model of polymer dynamics\nwith a viscoelastic relaxation time $\\tau_C$. To explore the resulting\ninterplay between active and polymeric dynamics, we first generalise a linear\nstability analysis (from earlier studies without polymer) to derive criteria\nfor the onset of spontaneous heterogeneous flows (strain rate) and/or\ndeformations (strain). We find two modes of instability. The first is a viscous\nmode, associated with strain rate perturbations. It dominates for relatively\nsmall values of $\\tau_C$ and is a simple generalisation of the instability\nknown previously without polymer. The second is an elastomeric mode, associated\nwith strain perturbations, which dominates at large $\\tau_C$ and persists even\nas $\\tau_C\\to\\infty$. We explore the novel dynamical states to which these\ninstabilities lead by means of direct numerical simulations. These reveal\noscillatory shear-banded states in 1D, and activity-driven turbulence in 2D\neven in the elastomeric limit $\\tau_C\\to\\infty$. Adding polymer can also have\ncalming effects, increasing the net throughput of spontaneous flow along a\nchannel in a new type of \"drag-reduction\". Finally the effect of including\nstrong, antagonistic coupling between nematic and polymer is examined\nnumerically, revealing a rich array of spontaneously flowing states.\n", "  We compare the initial value formulation of the low-energy limit of\n(non-projectable) Horava gravity to that of Einstein-aether theory when the\naether is assumed to be hypersurface orthogonal at the level of the field\nequations. This comparison clearly highlights a crucial difference in the\ncausal structure of the two theories at the non-perturbative level: in Horava\ngravity evolution equations include an elliptic equation that is not a\nconstraint relating initial data but needs to be imposed on each slice of the\nfoliation. This feature is absent in Einstein-aether theory. We discuss its\nphysical significance in Horava gravity. We also focus on spherical symmetry\nand we revisit existing collapse simulations in Einstein-aether theory. We\nargue that they have likely already uncovered the dynamical formation of a\nuniversal horizon and that they can act as evidence that this horizon is indeed\na Cauchy horizon in Horava gravity.\n", "  We provide numerical evidence for slow dynamics of the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model evolving on finite-size random networks\nwith power-law degree distributions. Extensive simulations were done by\naveraging the activity density over many realizations of networks. We\ninvestigated the effects of outliers in both highly fluctuating (natural\ncutoff) and non-fluctuating (hard cutoff) most connected vertices. Logarithmic\nand power-law decays in time were found for natural and hard cutoffs,\nrespectively. This happens in extended regions of the control parameter space\n$\\lambda_1<\\lambda<\\lambda_2$, suggesting Griffiths effects, induced by the\ntopological inhomogeneities. Optimal fluctuation theory considering\nsample-to-sample fluctuations of the pseudo thresholds is presented to explain\nthe observed slow dynamics. A quasistationary analysis shows that response\nfunctions remain bounded at $\\lambda_2$. We argue these to be signals of a\nsmeared transition. However, in the thermodynamic limit the Griffiths effects\nloose their relevancy and have a conventional critical point at $\\lambda_c=0$.\nSince many real networks are composed by heterogeneous and weakly connected\nmodules, the slow dynamics found in our analysis of independent and finite\nnetworks can play an important role for the deeper understanding of such\nsystems.\n", "  The charge carrier density in graphene on a dielectric substrate such as\nSiO$_2$ displays inhomogeneities, the so-called charge puddles. Because of the\nlinear dispersion relation in monolayer graphene, the puddles are predicted to\ngrow near charge neutrality, a markedly distinct property from conventional\ntwo-dimensional electron gases. By performing scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy on a mesoscopic graphene device, we directly observe\nthe puddles' growth, both in spatial extent and in amplitude, as the Dirac\npoint is approached. Self-consistent screening theory provides a unified\ndescription of both the macroscopic transport properties and the\nmicroscopically observed charge disorder.\n", "  We consider the diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC in a consistent model\nwith new scalars and vector-like fermions added to the Standard Model (SM),\nwhich can be constructed from orbifold grand unified theories and string\nmodels. The gauge coupling unification can be achieved, neutrino masses can be\ngenerated radiatively, and electroweak vacuum stability problem can be solved.\nTo explain the diphoton resonance, we study a spin-0 particle, and discuss\nvarious associated final states.\n", "  We investigate the processes $e^+e^-$$\\to$$\\gamma J/\\psi\\phi$, $\\gamma\nJ/\\psi\\omega$ and $\\pi^0 J/\\psi\\eta$ to search for the charmnium-like states\nwith hidden $s\\bar{s}$, such as $Y(4140)$, $Y(4274)$, $X(4350)$ and $X(3915)$.\nThese processes will receive contributions from the charmed-strange meson\nrescatterings. When the center-of-mass energies of the $e^+e^-$ scatterings are\ntaken around the $D_{s0}(2317)D_s^{*}$, $D_{s1}(2460)D_s$ or\n$D_{s1}(2460)D_s^{*}$ threshold, the anomalous triangle singularities can be\npresent in the rescattering amplitudes, which implies a non-resonance\nexplanation about the resonance-like structures. The positions of the anomalous\ntriangle singularities are sensitive to the kinematics, which offers us a\ncriterion to distinguish the kinematic singularities from genuine particles.\n", "  We study the variational principle over an Hilbert-Einstein like action for\nan extended geometry taking into account torsion and non-metricity. By\nextending the semi-Riemannian geometry, we obtain an effective energy-momentum\ntensor which can be interpreted as physical sources. As an application we\ndevelop a new manner to obtain the gravitational wave equations on a\nWeyl-integrable manifold taking into account the non-metricity and non-trivial\nboundary conditions on the minimization of the action, which can be identified\nas possible sources for the cosmological constant and provides two different\nequations for gravitational waves. We examine gravitational waves in a\npre-inflationary cosmological model.\n", "  Singleton et al (2009) have argued that the flux of pulsars measured at 1400\nMHz shows an apparent violation of the inverse-square law with distance ($r$),\nand it is consistent with $1/r$ scaling. They deduced this from the fact that\nthe convergence error obtained in reconstructing the luminosity function of\npulsars using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure is about $10^5$ times\nlarger for a distance exponent of two (corresponding to the inverse-square law)\ncompared to an exponent of one. When we applied the same technique to this\npulsar dataset with two different values for the trial luminosity function in\nthe zeroth iteration, we find that neither of them can reproduce a value of\n$10^5$ for the ratio of the convergence error between these distance exponents.\nWe then reconstruct the differential pulsar luminosity function using\nLynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method after positing both an inverse-linear and an\ninverse-square scalings with distance. We show this method cannot help in\ndiscerning between the two exponents. Finally, when we tried to estimate the\npower law exponent with a Bayesian regression procedure, we do not get a\nbest-fit value of one for the distance exponent. The model residuals obtained\nfrom our fitting procedure are larger for the inverse-linear law compared to\nthe inverse-square law. Moreover, the observed pulsar flux cannot be\nparameterized only by power-law functions of distance, period, and period\nderivative. Therefore, we conclude from our analysis using multiple methods\nthat there is no evidence that the pulsar radio flux at 1400 MHz violates the\ninverse-square law.\n", "  GaN and ZnO microcavities have been grown on patterned silicon substrate.\nThanks to a common platform these microcavities share similar photonic\nproperties with large quality factors and low photonic disorder which gives the\npossibility to determine the optimal spot diameter and to realize a complete\ncomparative phase diagram study. Both systems have been investigated under the\nsame experimental condition. Experimental results are well reproduced by\nsimulation using Boltzmann equations. Lower polariton lasing threshold has been\nmeasured at low temperature in the ZnO microcavity as expected due to a larger\nRabi splitting. However the threshold is strongly impacted by LO phonons\nthrough phonon-assisted polariton relaxation. We observe and discuss this\neffect as a function of temperature and detuning. Finally the polariton lasing\nthreshold at room temperature is quite similar in both microcavities. This\nstudy highlights polariton relaxation mechanism and their importance for\nthreshold optimization.\n", "  Tight-binding models for ultracold atoms in optical lattices can be properly\ndefined by using the concept of maximally localized Wannier functions for\ncomposite bands. The basic principles of this approach are reviewed here, along\nwith different applications to lattice potentials with two minima per unit\ncell, in one and two spatial dimensions. Two independent methods for computing\nthe tight-binding coefficients - one ab initio, based on the maximally\nlocalized Wannier functions, the other through analytic expressions in terms of\nthe energy spectrum - are considered. In the one dimensional case, where the\ntight-binding coefficients can be obtained by designing a specific gauge\ntransformation, we consider both the case of quasi resonance between the two\nlowest bands, and that between s and p orbitals. In the latter case, the role\nof the Wannier functions in the derivation of an effective Dirac equation is\nalso reviewed. Then, we consider the case of a two dimensional honeycomb\npotential, with particular emphasis on the Haldane model, its phase diagram,\nand the breakdown of the Peierls substitution. Tunable honeycomb lattices,\ncharacterized by movable Dirac points, are also considered. Finally, general\nconsiderations for dealing with the interaction terms are presented.\n", "  ATLAS and CMS recently show the first results from run 2 of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. A resonant bump at a mass of around 750\nGeV in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum is indicated and the corresponding\ndiphoton production cross section is around 3-10 fb. Motivated by the LHC\ndiphoton excess, we propose that the possible resonance candidate is a Higgs\nsinglet. To produce the Higgs singlet via gluon-gluon fusion process, we embed\nthe Higgs singlet in the framework of vector-like triplet quark (VLTQ) model.\nAs a result, the Higgs singlet decaying to diphoton final state is via VLTQ\nloops. Using the enhanced number of new quarks and new Yukawa couplings of the\nVLTQs and Higgs singlet, we successfully explain the diphoton production cross\nsection. We find that the width of the Higgs singlet is below 1 GeV, its\nproduction cross section can be of order of 1 pb at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and the\nbranching ratio for it decaying to diphoton is around $0.017$ and is\ninsensitive to the masses of VLTQs and new Yukawa couplings. We find a strong\ncorrelation between the Higgs Yukawa couplings to $s$-$b$ and $c$-$t$; the\nresulted branching ratio for $t \\to c h$ can be $1.1\\times 10^{-4}$ when the\nconstraint from $B_s$ oscillation is applied. With the constrained parameter\nvalues, the signal strength for the SM Higgs decaying to diphoton is\n$\\mu_{\\gamma\\gamma}< 1.18$, which is consistent with the current measurements\nat ATLAS and CMS.\n", "  We investigate homogeneous cosmological models with perfect-fluid sources in\nthe framework of the Ho\\v rava-Lifshitz model for quantum gravity. We show that\nthe Hamiltonian constraint of such spacetimes can be rewritten as the Cardy\nformula for the entropy in conformal field theory. The Cardy entropy is shown\nto depend explicitly on the value of the Ho\\v rava parameter $\\lambda$ so that\nit can be interpreted as determining the entropy and the gravitational\ninteraction of the theory. Moreover, we show that Verlinde's Pythagorean\nrepresentation of the Hamiltonian constraint is also valid in the case of\nhomogeneous Ho\\v rava-Lifshitz spacetimes. We interpret these results as a\nfurther indication of a deep relationship between gravity, thermodynamics and\nholography in the quantum regime.\n", "  We consider the dynamical off-equilibrium behavior of the three-dimensional\nO$(N)$ vector model in the presence of a slowly-varying time-dependent\nspatially-uniform magnetic field ${\\bm H}(t) = h(t)\\,{\\bm e}$, where ${\\bm e}$\nis a $N$-dimensional constant unit vector, $h(t)=t/t_s$, and $t_s$ is a time\nscale, at fixed temperature $T\\le T_c$, where $T_c$ corresponds to the\ncontinuous order-disorder transition. The dynamic evolutions start from\nequilibrium configurations at $h_i < 0$, correspondingly $t_i < 0$, and end at\ntime $t_f > 0$ with $h(t_f) > 0$, or vice versa. We show that the magnetization\ndisplays an off-equilibrium scaling behavior close to the transition line ${\\bm\nH}(t)=0$. It arises from the interplay among the time $t$, the time scale\n$t_s$, and the finite size $L$. The scaling behavior can be parametrized in\nterms of the scaling variables $t_s^\\kappa/L$ and $t/t_s^{\\kappa_t}$, where\n$\\kappa>0$ and $\\kappa_t > 0$ are appropriate universal exponents, which differ\nat the critical point and for $T < T_c$. In the latter case, $\\kappa$ and\n$\\kappa_t$ also depend on the shape of the lattice and on the boundary\nconditions. We present numerical results for the Heisenberg ($N=3$) model under\na purely relaxational dynamics. They confirm the predicted off-equilibrium\nscaling behaviors at and below $T_c$. We also discuss hysteresis phenomena in\nround-trip protocols for the time dependence of the external field. We define a\nscaling function for the hysteresis loop area of the magnetization that can be\nused to quantify how far the system is from equilibrium.\n", "  We propose an efficient Bayesian MCMC algorithm for estimating cosmological\nparameters from CMB data without use of likelihood approximations. It builds on\na previously developed Gibbs sampling framework that allows for exploration of\nthe joint CMB sky signal and power spectrum posterior, P(s,Cl|d), and addresses\na long-standing problem of efficient parameter estimation simultaneously in\nhigh and low signal-to-noise regimes. To achieve this, our new algorithm\nintroduces a joint Markov Chain move in which both the signal map and power\nspectrum are synchronously modified, by rescaling the map according to the\nproposed power spectrum before evaluating the Metropolis-Hastings accept\nprobability. Such a move was already introduced by Jewell et al. (2009), who\nused it to explore low signal-to-noise posteriors. However, they also found\nthat the same algorithm is inefficient in the high signal-to-noise regime,\nsince a brute-force rescaling operation does not account for phase information.\nThis problem is mitigated in the new algorithm by subtracting the Wiener filter\nmean field from the proposed map prior to rescaling, leaving high\nsignal-to-noise information invariant in the joint step, and effectively only\nrescaling the low signal-to-noise component. To explore the full posterior, the\nnew joint move is then interleaved with a standard conditional Gibbs sky map\nmove. We apply our new algorithm to simplified simulations for which we can\nevaluate the exact posterior to study both its accuracy and performance, and\nfind good agreement with the exact posterior; marginal means agree to less than\n0.006 sigma, and standard deviations to better than 3%. The Markov Chain\ncorrelation length is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by other\nstandard samplers in the field.\n", "  We report measurements of the spin torque efficiencies in\nperpendicularly-magnetized Pt/Co bilayers where the Pt resistivity $\\rho_{Pt}$\nis strongly dependent on thickness $t_{Pt}$ . The damping-like spin Hall torque\nefficiency per unit current density, $\\xi^j_{DL}$ , varies significantly with\n$t_{Pt}$, exhibiting a peak value $\\xi^j_{DL}=0.12$ at $t_{Pt} = 2.8 - 3.9$ nm.\nIn contrast, $\\xi^j_{DL}/\\rho_{Pt}$ increases monotonically with $t_{Pt}$ and\nsaturates for $t_{Pt} > 5$ nm, consistent with an intrinsic spin Hall effect\nmechanism, in which $\\xi^j_{DL}$ is enhanced by an increase in $\\rho_{Pt}$ .\nAssuming the Elliott-Yafet spin scattering mechanism dominates we estimate that\nthe spin diffusion length $\\lambda_s = (0.77 \\pm 0.08) \\times 10^{-15} \\Omega\nm^2 /\\rho_{Pt}$.\n", "  The rich harvest of seismic observations over the past decade provides\nevidence of angular momentum redistribution in stellar interiors that is not\nreproduced by current evolution codes. In this context, transport by internal\ngravity waves can play a role and could explain discrepancies between theory\nand observations. The efficiency of the transport of angular momentum by waves\ndepends on their driving mechanism. While excitation by turbulence throughout\nthe convective zone has already been investigated, we know that penetrative\nconvection into the stably stratified radiative zone can also generate internal\ngravity waves. Therefore, we aim at developing a semianalytical model to\nestimate the generation of IGW by penetrative plumes below an upper convective\nenvelope. We derive the wave amplitude considering the pressure exerted by an\nensemble of plumes on the interface between the radiative and convective zones\nas source term in the equation of momentum. We consider the effect of a thermal\ntransition from a convective gradient to a radiative one on the transmission of\nthe wave into the radiative zone. The plume-induced wave energy flux at the top\nof the radiative zone is computed for a solar model and is compared to the\nturbulence-induced one. We show that, for the solar case, penetrative\nconvection generates waves more efficiently than turbulence and that\nplume-induced waves can modify the internal rotation rate on shorter time\nscales. We also show that a smooth thermal transition significatively enhances\nthe wave transmission compared to the case of a steep transition. We conclude\nthat driving by penetrative convection must be taken into account as much as\nturbulence-induced waves for the transport of internal angular momentum.\n", "  We compute the dark matter velocity dispersion tensor up to third order in\nperturbation theory using the Lagrangian formalism, revealing growing solutions\nat the third and higher orders. Our results are general and can be used for any\nother perturbative formalism. As an application, corrections to the matter\npower spectrum are calculated, and we find that some of them have the same\nstructure as those in the effective field theory of large-scale structure, with\n\"EFT-like\" coefficients that grow quadratically with the linear growth function\nand are further suppressed by powers of the logarithmic linear growth factor\n$f$; other corrections present additional $k$ dependence. Due to the velocity\ndispersions, there exists a free-streaming scale that suppresses the whole\n1-loop power spectrum. Furthermore, we find that as a consequence of the\nnonlinear evolution, the free-streaming length is shifted towards larger\nscales, wiping out more structure than that expected in linear theory.\nTherefore, we argue that the formalism developed here is better suited for a\nperturbation treatment of warm dark matter or neutrino clustering, where the\nvelocity dispersion effects are well known to be important. We discuss\nimplications related to the nature of dark matter.\n", "  Non-Markovian master equations describe general open quantum systems when no\napproximation is made. We provide the exact closed master equation for the\nclass of Gaussian, completely positive, trace preserving, non-Markovian\ndynamics. This very general result allows to investigate a vast variety of\nphysical systems. We show that the master equation for non-Markovian quantum\nBrownian motion is a particular case of our general result. Furthermore, we\nderive the master equation unraveled by a non-Markovian, dissipative stochastic\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, paving the way for the analysis of dissipative\nnon-Markovian collapse models.\n", "  We study electric quantum walks in two dimensions considering Grover,\nAlternate, Hadamard, and DFT quantum walks. In the Grover walk the behaviour\nunder an electric field is easy to summarize: when the field direction\ncoincides with the x or y axes, it produces a transient trapping of the\nprobability distribution along the direction of the field, while when it is\ndirected along the diagonals, a perfect 2D trapping is frustrated. The analysis\nof the alternate walk helps to understand the behaviour of the Grover walk as\nboth walks are partially equivalent; in particular, it helps to understand the\nrole played by the existence of conical intersections in the dispersion\nrelations, as we show that when these are removed a perfect 2D trapping can\noccur for suitable directions of the field. We complete our study with the\nelectric DFT and Hadamard walks in 2D, showing that the latter can exhibit\nperfect 2D trapping.\n", "  We investigate finite-volume effects in the hadronic vacuum polarization,\nwith an eye toward the corresponding systematic error in the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment. We consider both recent lattice data as well as lowest-order,\nfinite-volume chiral perturbation theory, in order to get a quantitative\nunderstanding. Even though leading-order chiral perturbation theory does not\nprovide a good description of the hadronic vacuum polarization, it turns out\nthat it gives a good representation of finite-volume effects. We find that\nfinite-volume effects cannot be ignored when the aim is a few percent level\naccuracy for the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment, even when using ensembles with $m_\\pi L> 4$ and $m_\\pi \\sim\n200$ MeV.\n", "  We reexamine genus one super-Green functions with general boundary conditions\ntwisted by $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ for $(\\sigma, \\tau)$ directions in the eigenmode\nexpansion and derive expressions as infinite series of hypergeometric\nfunctions. Using these, we compute one-loop superstring amplitudes with\nnon-maximal supersymmetry, taking an example of massless vector emissions of\nopen string type I ${\\cal Z}_2$ orbifold.\n", "  The conductance of graphene subject to a strong, tilted magnetic field\nexhibits a dramatic change from insulating to conducting behavior with\ntilt-angle, regarded as evidence for the transition from a canted\nantiferromagnetic (CAF) to a ferromagnetic (FM) \\nu=0 quantum Hall state. We\ndevelop a theory for the electric transport in this system based on the\nspin-charge connection, whereby the evolution in the nature of collective spin\nexcitations is reflected in the charge-carrying modes. To this end, we derive\nan effective field theoretical description of the low-energy excitations,\nassociated with quantum fluctuations of the spin-valley domain wall\nground-state configuration which characterizes the two-dimensional (2D) system\nwith an edge. This analysis yields a model describing a one-dimensional charged\nedge mode coupled to charge-neutral spin-wave excitations in the 2D bulk.\nFocusing particularly on the FM phase, naively expected to exhibit perfect\nconductance, we study a mechanism whereby the coupling to these bulk\nexcitations assists in generating back-scattering. Our theory yields the\nconductance as a function of temperature and the Zeeman energy - the parameter\nthat tunes the transition between the FM and CAF phases - with behavior in\nqualitative agreement with experiment.\n", "  Cooling simulations of neutron stars and their comparison with the data from\nthermally emitting x-ray sources put constraints on the properties of axions,\nand by extension of any light pseudoscalar dark matter particles, whose\nexistence has been postulated to solve the strong-CP problem of QCD. We\nincorporate the axion emission by pair-breaking and formation processes by $S$-\nand $P$-wave nucleonic condensates in a benchmark code for cooling simulations\nas well as provide fit formulas for the rates of these processes. Axion cooling\nof neutron stars has been simulated for 24 models covering the mass range 1 to\n1.8 solar masses, featuring nonaccreted iron and accreted light-element\nenvelopes, and a range of nucleon-axion couplings. The models are based on an\nequation state predicting conservative physics of superdense nuclear matter\nthat does not allow for the onset of fast cooling processes induced by phase\ntransitions to non-nucleonic forms of matter or high proton concentration. The\ncooling tracks in the temperature vs age plane were confronted with the\n(time-averaged) measured surface temperature of the central compact object in\nthe Cas A supernova remnant as well as surface temperatures of three nearby\nmiddle-aged thermally emitting pulsars.We find that the axion coupling is\nlimited to $f_a/10^{7}\\textrm{GeV} \\ge (5$--$10)$, which translates into an\nupper bound on axion mass $m_a \\le (0.06$--$0.12)~\\textrm{eV}$ for Peccei-Quinn\ncharges of the neutron $\\vert C_n \\vert \\sim 0.04$ and proton $\\vert C_p \\vert\n\\sim 0.4$ characteristic for hadronic models of axions.\n", "  Obtain time-series photometry of the very crowded central regions of Galactic\nglobular clusters with better angular resolution than previously achieved with\nconventional CCDs on ground-based telescopes to complete, or improve, the\ncensus of the variable star population in those stellar systems. Images were\ntaken using the Danish 1.54-m Telescope at the ESO observatory at La Silla in\nChile. The telescope was equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD and the\nshort-exposure-time images obtained (10 images per second) were stacked using\nthe shift-and-add technique to produce the normal-exposure-time images\n(minutes). Photometry was performed via difference image analysis. Automatic\ndetection of variable stars in the field was attempted. The light curves of\n12541 stars in the cores of 10 globular clusters were statistically analysed in\norder to automatically extract the variable stars. We obtained light curves for\n31 previously known variable stars (3 L, 2 SR, 20 RR Lyrae, 1 SX Phe, 3\ncataclysmic variables, 1 EW and 1 NC) and we discovered 30 new variables (16 L,\n7 SR, 4 RR Lyrae, 1 SX Phe and 2 NC).\n", "  How to detect the skyrmion position is a crucial problem in future\nskyrmionics since it corresponds to the reading process of information. We\npropose a method to detect the skyrmion position purely electrically by\nmeasuring the Hall conductance in a constricted geometry. The Hall conductance\nbecomes maximum when a skyrmion is at the lead position. It is possible to\ndetect the skyrmion position even at room temperature. We find an optimized\nwidth of the sample determined by the skyrmion radius. We also investigate the\neffects of elastic and inelastic scatterings, and finite temperature. We find\nthat the local density of states become minimum at the skyrmion position. Our\nresults will be a basis of future skyrmion electronics.\n", "  We present a kind of generalized Vaidya solutions of a new cubic gravity in\nfive dimensions whose field equations in spherically spacetime are always\nsecond order like the Lovelock gravity. We also study the thermodynamics of its\napparent horizon and get its entropy expression and generalized Misner-Sharp\nenergy. Finally we present the first law and second law hold in this gravity.\nAlthough all the results are analogue to those in Lovelock gravity, we in fact\nintroduce the contribution of new cubic term in five dimensions where cubic\nLovelock term is just zero.\n", "  Background: The sharp $1^-$ resonances with enhanced isoscalar dipole\ntransition strengths are observed in many light nuclei at relatively small\nexcitation energies, but their nature was unclear. Purpose: We show those\nresonances can be attributed to the cluster states with asymmetric\nconfigurations such as $\\alpha$+$^{16}{\\rm O}$. We explain why asymmetric\ncluster states are strongly excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. We also\nprovide a theoretical prediction of the isoscalar dipole transitions in\n$^{20}{\\rm Ne}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$. Method: The transition matrix is\nanalytically derived to clarify the excitation mechanism. The nuclear model\ncalculations by Brink-Bloch wave function and antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics are also performed to provide a theoretical prediction for $^{20}{\\rm\nNe}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$. Results: It is shown that the transition matrix is as\nlarge as the Weisskopf estimate even though the ground state is an ideal shell\nmodel state. Furthermore, it is considerably amplified if the ground state has\ncluster correlation. The nuclear model calculations predict large transition\nmatrix to the $\\alpha$+$^{16}{\\rm O}$ and $\\alpha$+$^{40}{\\rm Ca}$ cluster\nstates comparable with or larger than the Weisskopf estimate.\n  Conclusion: We conclude that the asymmetric cluster states are strongly\nexcited by the isoscalar dipole transition. Combined with the isoscalar\nmonopole transition that populates the $0^+$ cluster states, the isoscalar\ntransitions are promising probe for asymmetric clusters.\n", "  In the EPR experiment, each measurement addresses the question \"What spin\nvalue has this particle along this orientation?\" The outcome then proves that\nthe spin value has been affected by the distant experimenter's choice of spin\norientation. We propose a new setting where the question is reversed: \"What is\nthe orientation along which this particle has this spin value?\" It turns out\nthat the orientation is similarly subject to nonlocal effects. To enable the\nreversal, each particle's interaction with a beam-splitter at t1 leaves its\nspin orientation superposed. Then at t2, the experimenter selects an \"up\" or\n\"down\" spin value for this yet-undefined orientation. Only after the two\nparticles undergo this procedure, the two measurements are completed, each\nparticle having its spin value along a definite orientation. By Bell's theorem,\nit is now the \"choice\" of orientation that must be nonlocally transmitted\nbetween the particles upon completing the measurement. This choice, however,\nhas preceded the experimenter's selection. This seems to lend support for the\ntime-symmetric interpretations of QM, where retrocausality plays a significant\nrole. We conclude with a brief comparison between these interpretations and\ntheir traditional alternatives, Copenhagen, Bohmian mechanics and the Many\nWorlds Interpretation.\n", "  Ultracold atoms provide clues to an important many-body problem regarding the\ndependence of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition temperature $T_c$ on\ninteractions. However, cold atoms are trapped in harmonic potentials and\ntheoretical evaluations of the $T_c$ shift of trapped interacting Bose gases\nare challenging. While previous predictions of the leading-order shift have\nbeen confirmed, more recent experiments exhibit higher-order corrections beyond\navailable mean-field theories. By implementing two large-N based theories with\nthe local density approximation (LDA), we extract next-order corrections of the\n$T_c$ shift. The leading-order large-N theory produces results quantitatively\ndifferent from the latest experimental data. The leading-order auxiliary field\n(LOAF) theory containing both normal and anomalous density fields captures the\n$T_c$ shift accurately in the weak interaction regime. However, the LOAF theory\nshows incompatible behavior with the LDA and forcing the LDA leads to density\ndiscontinuities in the trap profiles. We present a phenomenological model based\non the LOAF theory, which repairs the incompatibility and provides a prediction\nof the $T_c$ shift in stronger interaction regime.\n", "  There has been a great deal of attention to the low lying energy spectum in a\nnucleus becuse of the abundance of experimetal data. Likewise ,perhaps to a\nlesser extent but still significant the high end for a given configuratiion has\nbeen examined. Here ,using single j shell calculations as a guide we examine\nthe middle part of the spectum resulting form single j shell\ncalculations.Seniority arguments are used to partially explain the midshell\nbehaviours even though in general seniority is not a good quantum number for\nmixed systems of neutrons and protons.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate macroscopic Schr\\\"odinger-cat states in a\nquantum harmonic oscillator (electromagnetic field or mechanical resonator)\ncoupled to a quantum bit (two-level system) via a conditional displacement\nmechanism. By driving the qubit monochromatically, the oscillation of the qubit\nstate modifies the effective frequency of the driving force acting on the\noscillator, and a resonant or near-resonant driving on the oscillator can be\nachieved. The displacement of the oscillator is then significantly enhanced due\nto the small detuning of the driving force and can exceed that of the\nzero-point fluctuation. This effect can be used to prepare quantum\nsuperpositions of macroscopically distinct coherent states in the oscillator.\nWe present detailed studies on this state-generation scheme in both the closed-\nand open-system cases. This approach can be implemented in various experimental\nplatforms, such as cavity- or circuit-QED systems, electromechanical systems,\nand spin-cantilever systems.\n", "  Working with a pion mass $m_\\pi \\approx 150$ MeV, we study $\\pi\\pi$ and\n$K\\pi$ scattering using two flavours of non-perturbatively improved Wilson\nfermions at a lattice spacing $a\\approx 0.071$ fm. Employing two lattice\nvolumes with linear spatial extents of $N_s=48$ and $N_s=64$ points and moving\nframes, we extract the phase shifts for p-wave $\\pi\\pi$ and $K\\pi$ scattering\nnear the $\\rho$ and $K^*$ resonances.Comparing our results to those of previous\nlattice studies, that used pion masses ranging from about 200 MeV up to 470\nMeV, we find that the coupling $g_{\\rho\\pi\\pi}$ appears to be remarkably\nconstant as a function of $m_{\\pi}$.\n", "  Tunneling of quasiparticles between two nearly-aligned graphene sheets\nproduces resonant current-voltage characteristics because of the quasi-exact\nconservation of in-plane momentum. We claim that, in this regime, vertical\ntransport in graphene/boron nitride/graphene heterostructures carries precious\ninformation on electron-electron interactions and the quasiparticle spectral\nfunction of the two-dimensional electron system in graphene. We present\nextensive microscopic calculations of the tunneling spectra with the inclusion\nof quasiparticle lifetime effects and elucidate the range of parameters\n(inter-layer bias, temperature, twist angle, and gate voltage) under which\nelectron-electron interaction physics emerges.\n", "  A much-studied system is the quasi-2D electron gas in image-potential bound\nstates at the surface of helium and hydrogen. In this paper, we report on an\nanalogous quasi-1D system: electrons bound by image-like polarization forces to\nthe surface of a helium-coated carbon nanotube. The potential is computed from\nan electron-helium pseudopotential, plus a dynamic image term evaluated from a\nsemi-classical model of the nanotube's response function. Predictions are made\nfor the bound states and potential many-body properties of this novel electron\ngas for a specific choice of tube radius and film thickness.\n", "  We investigate the mass spectra of open heavy flavor mesons in an external\nconstant magnetic field within QCD sum rules. Spectral ans\\\"atze on the\nphenomenological side are proposed in order to properly take into account\nmixing effects between the pseudoscalar and vector channels, and the Landau\nlevels of charged mesons. The operator product expansion is implemented up to\ndimension-5 operators. As a result, we find for neutral D mesons a significant\npositive mass shift that goes beyond simple mixing effects. In contrast,\ncharged D mesons are further subject to Landau level effects, which together\nwith the mixing effects almost completely saturate the mass shifts obtained in\nour sum rule analysis.\n", "  The generalized theory of Stokes Mueller polarimetry is employed to develop\nthe third-order optical polarimetry framework for third-harmonic generation\n(THG). The outgoing and incoming radiations are represented by 4-element and\n16-element column vectors, respectively, and the intervening medium is\nrepresented by a $4\\times 16$ triple Mueller matrix. Expressions for the THG\nStokes vector and the Mueller matrix are provided in terms of coherency and\ncorrelation matrices, and expanded by four-dimensional $\\gamma$ matrices that\nare analogues of Pauli matrices. Useful expressions of triple Mueller matrices\nare presented for cylindrically symmetric and isotropic structures. In\naddition, the relation between third-order susceptibilities and the measured\ntriple Mueller matrix is provided. This theoretical framework can be applied\nfor structural investigations of crystalline materials, including biological\nstructures.\n", "  Background: The quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA), within the\nframework of the nuclear density functional theory (DFT), has been a standard\ntool to access the collective excitations of the atomic nuclei. Recently,\nfinite amplitude method (FAM) has been developed, in order to perform the QRPA\ncalculations efficiently without any truncation on the two-quasiparticle model\nspace. Purpose: We discuss the nuclear giant dipole resonance (GDR) in heavy\nrare-earth isotopes, for which the conventional matrix diagonalization of the\nQRPA is numerically demanding. A role of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule\nenhancement factor, connected to the isovector effective mass, is also\ninvestigated. Methods: The electric dipole photoabsorption cross section was\ncalculated within a parallelized FAM-QRPA scheme. We employed the Skyrme energy\ndensity functional self-consistently in the DFT calculation for the ground\nstates and FAM-QRPA calculation for the excitations. Results: The mean GDR\nfrequency and width are mostly reproduced with the FAM-QRPA, when compared to\nexperimental data, although some deficiency is observed with isotopes heavier\nthan erbium. A role of the TRK enhancement factor in actual GDR strength is\nclearly shown: its increment leads to a shift of the GDR strength to\nhigher-energy region, without a significant change in the transition\namplitudes. Conclusions: The newly developed FAM-QRPA scheme shows a remarkable\nefficiency, which enables to perform systematic analysis of GDR for heavy\nrare-earth nuclei. Theoretical deficiency of photoabsorption cross section\ncould not be improved by only adjusting the TRK enhancement factor, suggesting\nthe necessity of beyond the self-consistent QRPA approach, and/or a more\nsystematic optimization of the EDF parameters.\n", "  Using the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinia (PNJL) model, we study the spinodal\ninstability of a baryon-rich quark-gluon plasma in the linear response theory.\nWe find that the spinodal unstable region in the temperature and density plane\nshrinks with increasing wave number of the unstable mode and is also reduced if\nthe effect of Polyakov loop is not included. In the small wave number or long\nwavelength limit, the spinodal boundaries in both cases of with and without the\nPolyakov loop coincide with those determined from the isothermal spinodal\ninstability in the thermodynamic approach. Also, the vector interactions among\nquarks is found to suppress unstable modes of all wave numbers. Moreover, the\ngrowth rate of unstable modes initially increases with the wave number but is\nreduced when the wave number becomes large. Including the collisional effect\nfrom quark scattering via the linearized Boltzmann equation, we further find\nthat it decreases the growth rate of unstable modes of all wave numbers.\nRelevance of these results to relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed.\n", "  We argue that the observation of the color transparency effect in the\nsemiexclusive $A(\\pi^-,l^+ l^-)$ process is important for determining whether\nit is possible to extract the generalized parton distributions of the nucleon\nfrom the elementary reaction $\\pi^- p \\to l^+ l^- n$ at $p_{\\rm lab}=15-20$\nGeV/c at small $|t|$ and large invariant mass of the dilepton pair $l^+ l^-$.\nAssuming that the transverse size of the pionic $q \\bar q$ pair in the hard\ninteraction point is similar to the one in the reaction $\\gamma^* p\\to \\pi^+ n$\nstudied at JLab we predict large color transparency effects in the discussed\nkinematic range. We also suggest that the semiexclusive $\\rho^0$ production in\n$\\pi^-$-induced reactions in the same beam momentum region may provide new\ninformation on the dynamics of the interaction in the non-vacuum channel, while\nthe $J/\\psi$ production can be used to get information on $J/\\psi N$ total\ninteraction cross section.,\n", "  We present a set of one-loop integral coefficient relations in QCD. The\nunitarity method is useful for exposing one-loop amplitudes in terms of tree\namplitudes. The coefficient relations are induced by tree-level BCJ amplitude\nrelations. We provide examples for box, triangle, and bubble coefficients.\nThese relations reduce the total number of independent coefficients needed to\ncalculate one-loop QCD amplitudes.\n", "  A high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity with a frequency-doubled continuous wave\ngreen laser (532~nm) has been built and installed in Hall A of Jefferson Lab\nfor high precision Compton polarimetry. The infrared (1064~nm) beam from a\nytterbium-doped fiber amplifier seeded by a Nd:YAG nonplanar ring oscillator\nlaser is frequency doubled in a single-pass periodically poled MgO:LiNbO$_{3}$\ncrystal. The maximum achieved green power at 5 W IR pump power is 1.74 W with a\ntotal conversion efficiency of 34.8\\%. The green beam is injected into the\noptical resonant cavity and enhanced up to 3.7~kW with a corresponding\nenhancement of 3800. The polarization transfer function has been measured in\norder to determine the intra-cavity circular laser polarization within a\nmeasurement uncertainty of 0.7\\%. The PREx experiment at Jefferson Lab used\nthis system for the first time and achieved 1.0\\% precision in polarization\nmeasurements of an electron beam with energy and current of 1.0~GeV and\n50~$\\mu$A.\n", "  We take a quick look at the different possible universally coupled scalar\nfields in nature. Then, we discuss how the gauging of the group of scale\ntransformations (dilations), together with the Poincare group, leads to a\nWeyl-Cartan spacetime structure. There the dilaton field finds a natural\nsurrounding. Moreover, we describe shortly the phenomenology of the\nhypothetical axion field. --- In the second part of our essay, we consider a\nspacetime, the structure of which is exclusively specified by the premetric\nMaxwell equations and a fourth rank electromagnetic response tensor density\n$\\chi^{ijkl}= -\\chi^{jikl}= -\\chi^{ijlk}$ with 36 independent components. This\ntensor density incorporates the permittivities, permeabilities, and the\nmagneto-electric moduli of spacetime. No metric, no connection, no further\nproperty is prescribed. If we forbid birefringence (double-refraction) in this\nmodel of spacetime, we eventually end up with the fields of an axion, a\ndilaton, and the 10 components of a metric tensor with Lorentz signature. If\nthe dilaton becomes a constant (the vacuum admittance) and the axion field\nvanishes, we recover the Riemannian spacetime of general relativity theory.\nThus, the metric is encapsulated in $\\chi^{ijkl}$, it can be derived from it.\n[file CarlBrans80_07.tex]\n", "  We investigate quantum dynamics of a generic model of light-matter\ninteraction in the context of high impedance waveguides, focusing on the\nbehavior of the emitted photonic states, in the framework of the spin-boson\nmodel Quantum quenches as well as scattering of an incident coherent pulse are\nstudied using two complementary methods. First, we develop an approximate\nansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state\nwavefunction; formally, this approach combines ideas from adiabatic\nrenormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory.\nSecond, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity\npulse by using NRG calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear\nresponse property throughout the ultra-strong coupling regime. We find that in\na sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical\nartifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously\nunnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that\ngenerates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG\nis used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as\nthe inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are\nestablished and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the\ntransport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These\nformulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in\nthe spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for\ncomparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide QED. Finally, the scattering\nresults using the coherent state wavefunction approach are compared favorably\nto the NRG results for very weak incident intensity. We end our study by\npresenting results at higher power where the response of the system is\nnonlinear.\n", "  Vacancy-mediated diffusion of an Al atom in pure Mg matrix is studied using\nthe atomistic, on-lattice self-learning kinetic Monte Carlo (SLKMC) method.\nActivation barriers for vacancy-Mg and vacancy-Al atom exchange processes are\ncalculated on-the-fly using the climbing image nudged-elastic band method and\nbinary Mg-Al modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential. Diffusivities\nof an Al atom obtained from SLKMC simulations show the same behavior as\nobserved in experimental and theoretical studies available in the literature,\nthat is, Al atom diffuses faster within the basal plane than along the c-axis.\nAlthough, the effective activation barriers for Al-atom diffusion from SLKMC\nsimulations are close to experimental and theoretical values, the effective\nprefactors are lower than those obtained from experiments. We present all the\npossible vacancy-Mg and vacancy-Al atom exchange processes and their activation\nbarriers identified in SLKMC simulations. A simple mapping scheme to map an HCP\nlattice on to a simple cubic lattice is described, which enables the simulation\nof HCP lattice using on-lattice framework. We also present the pattern\nrecognition scheme which is used in SLKMC simulations to identify the local Al\natom configuration around a vacancy.\n", "  We explore the relative strengths of spin orbit coupling and crystal field\nsplitting in the Ir5+ compounds Ba2-xSrxYIrO6. In the case of strong spin orbit\ncoupling and regular Ir5+ octahedra, one expects a nonmagnetic J = 0 state; in\nthe case of distorted octahedra where crystal field effects dominate, the t2g\nmanifold splits into a magnetic ground state. We report the results of\ncontinuously transitioning from the cubic Ba2YIrO6 double perovskite with ideal\noctahedra to the monoclinic Sr2YIrO6 double perovskite with distorted\noctahedra. We see no emergence of an enhanced Ir5+ magnetic moment in the\nseries on increasing the structural distortions, as would have been the case\nfor significant crystal field splitting. The near-constant magnetic moment\nobserved through the Ba2-xSrxYIrO6 series reinforces the notion that spin-orbit\ncoupling is the dominant force in determining the magnetism of iridium-oxygen\noctahedra in perovskite-like structures\n", "  We probe effects of the partial chiral symmetry restoration to the mass of\nheavy-light mesons in a constituent quark model by changing the constituent\nquark mass of the light quark. Due to the competing effect between the quark\nmass and the linearly rising potential, whose contribution to the energy\nincreases as the quark mass decreases, the heavy-light meson mass has a minimum\nvalue near the constituent quark mass typically used in the vacuum. Hence, the\nmeson mass increases as one decreases the constituent quark mass consistent\nwith recent QCD sum rule analyses, which show an increasing $D$ meson mass as\nthe chiral order parameter decreases.\n", "  The gas-solid budget of carbon in protoplanetary disks is related to the\ncomposition of the cores and atmospheres of the planets forming in them. The\nkey gas-phase carbon carriers CO, C$^{0}$ and C$^{+}$ can now be observed in\ndisks. The gas-phase carbon abundance in disks has not yet been well\ncharacterized, we aim to obtain new constraints on the [C]/[H] ratio in a\nsample of disks, and to get an overview of the strength of [CI] and warm CO\nemission.\n  We carried out a survey of the CO$\\,6$--$5$ and [CI]$\\,1$--$0$ and $2$--$1$\nlines towards $37$ disks with APEX, and supplemented it with [CII] data from\nthe literature. The data are interpreted using a grid of models produced with\nthe DALI code. We also investigate how well the gas-phase carbon abundance can\nbe determined in light of parameter uncertainties.\n  The CO$\\,6$--$5$ line is detected in $13$ out of $33$ sources, the\n[CI]$\\,1$--$0$ in $6$ out of $12$, and the [CI]$\\,2$--$1$ in $1$ out of $33$.\nWith deep integrations, the first unambiguous detections of [CI]~$1$--$0$ in\ndisks are obtained, in TW~Hya and HD~100546.\n  Gas-phase carbon abundance reductions of a factor $5$--$10$ or more can be\nidentified robustly based on CO and [CI] detections. The atomic carbon\ndetection in TW~Hya confirms a factor $100$ reduction of [C]/[H]$_{\\rm gas}$ in\nthat disk, while the data are consistent with an ISM-like carbon abundance for\nHD~100546. In addition, BP~Tau, T~Cha, HD~139614, HD~141569, and HD~100453 are\neither carbon-depleted or gas-poor disks. The low [CI]~$2$--$1$ detection rates\nin the survey mostly reflect insufficient sensitivity to detect T~Tauri disks.\nThe Herbig~Ae/Be disks with CO and [CII] upper limits below the models are\ndebris disk like systems. A roughly order of magnitude increase in sensitivity\ncompared to our survey is required to obtain useful constraints on the\ngas-phase [C]/[H] ratio in most of the targeted systems.\n", "  Classic calculations of the magnetic moments mu_p and mu_n of the nucleons\nusing the traditional exponential kernel show instability with respect to\nvariations of the Borel mass as well as arbitrariness with respect to the\nchoice of the onset of perturbative QCD. The use of a polynomial kernel, the\ncoefficients of which are determined by the masses of the nucleon resonances\nstabilizes the calculation and provides much better damping of the unknown\ncontribution of the nucleon continuum. The method is also applied to the\nevaluation of the coupling gA of proton to the axial current and to the strong\npart of the neutron-proton mass difference Delta M_np. All these quantities\ndepend sensitively on the value of the 4-quark condensate < 0 | qqqq | 0 > and\nthe value < 0 | qqqq | 0 > ~ 1.5< 0 | qq | 0 >^2 reproduces the experimental\nresults.\n", "  We report experiments on surface nanopatterning of Si targets which are\nirradiated with 2 keV Ar + ions impinging at near-glancing incidence, under\nconcurrent co-deposition of Au impurities simultaneously extracted from a gold\ntarget by the same ion beam. Previous recent experiments by a number of groups\nsuggest that silicide formation is a prerequisite for pattern formation in the\npresence of metallic impurities. In spite of the fact that Au is known not to\nform stable compounds with the Si atoms, ripples nonetheless emerge in our\nexperiments with nanometric wavelengths and small amplitudes, and with an\norientation that changes with distance to the Au source. We provide results of\nsample analysis through Auger electron and energy-dispersive X-ray\nspectroscopies for their space-resolved chemical composition, and through\natomic force, scanning transmission electron, and high-resolution transmission\nmicroscopies for their morphological properties. We discuss these findings in\nthe light of current continuum models for this class of systems. The\ncomposition of and the dynamics within the near-surface amorphized layer that\nensues is expected to play a relevant role to account for the unexpected\nformation of these surface structures.\n", "  The linear time-dependent constants of motion of the parametric amplifier are\nobtained and used to determine in the tomographic-probability representation\nthe evolution of a general two-mode Gaussian state. By means of the\ndiscretization of the continuous variable density matrix, the von Neumann and\nlinear entropies are calculated to measure the entanglement properties between\nthe modes of the amplifier. The obtained results for the nonlocal correlations\nare compared with those associated to a linear map of discretized symplectic\nGaussian-state tomogram onto a qubit tomogram. This qubit portrait procedure is\nused to establish Bell-type's inequalities, which provide a necessary condition\nto determine the separability of quantum states, which can be evaluated through\nhomodyne detection. Other no-signaling nonlocal correlations are defined\nthrough the portrait procedure for noncomposite systems.\n", "  We discuss how nonrelativistic spacetime symmetries can be gauged in the\ncontext of the coset construction. We consider theories invariant under the\ncentrally extended Galilei algebra as well as the Lifshitz one, and we\ninvestigate under what conditions they can be supplemented by scale\ntransformations. We also clarify the role of torsion in these theories.\n", "  High resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) revealed traveling and stationary or\nquasi-stationary radio-components in several blazar jets. The traveling ones\nare in general interpreted as shock waves generated by pressure perturbations\ninjected at the jet nozzle. The stationary features can be interpreted as\nrecollimation shocks in non-pressure matched jets if they show a\nquasi-symmetric bump in the spectral index distribution. In some jets there may\nbe interactions between the two kinds of shocks. These shock--shock\ninteractions are observable with VLBI techniques, and their signature should\nalso be imprinted on the single--dish light curves. We performed relativistic\nhydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of over-pressured and pressure-matched jets. To\nsimulate the shock interaction we injected a perturbation at the jet nozzle\nonce a steady-state was reached. We computed the non-thermal emission\n(including adiabatic and synchotron losses) resulting from the simulation. We\nshow that the injection of perturbations in a jet can produce a bump in\nemission at GHz frequencies previous to the main flare, which is produced when\nthe perturbation fills the jet in the observer's frame. The detailed analysis\nof our simulations and the non-thermal emission calculations show that\ninteraction between a recollimation shock and traveling shock produce a typical\nand clear signature in both the single--dish light curves and in the VLBI\nobservations: the flaring peaks are higher and delayed with respect to the\nevolution of a perturbation through a conical jet. This fact can allow to\ndetect such interactions for stationary components lying outside of the region\nin where the losses are dominated by inverse Compton scattering.\n", "  We present bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) data\nof the Ce3d core levels and lifetime-reduced L edge x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) in the partial fluorescence yield (PFY) mode of the CeMIn5\nfamily with M = Co, Rh, and Ir. The HAXPES data are analyzed quantitatively\nwith a combination of full multiplet and configuration interaction model which\nallows correcting for the strong plasmons in the CeMIn5 HAXPES data, and\nreliable weights wn of the different fn contributions in the ground state are\ndetermined. The CeMIn5 results are compared to HAXPES data of other heavy\nfermion compounds and a systematic decrease of the hybridization strength Veff\nfrom CePd3 to CeRh3B2 to CeRu2Si2 is observed, while it is smallest for the\nthree CeMIn5 compounds. The f-occupation, however, increases in the same\nsequence and is close to one for the CeMIn5 family. The PFY-XAS data confirm an\nidentical f-occupation in the three CeMIn5 compounds and a phenomenological fit\nto these PFY-XAS data combined with a configuration interaction model yields\nconsistent results.\n", "  Conventional $s$-wave superconductors repel external magnetic flux. However,\na recent experiment [A. Di Bernardo et al., Phys. Rev. X \\textbf{5}, 041021\n(2015)] has tailored the electromagnetic response of superconducting\ncorrelations via adjacent magnetic materials. We consider another route to\nalter the Meissner effect where spin-orbit interactions induce an anisotropic\nMeissner response that changes sign depending on the field orientation. The\ntunable electromagnetic response opens new paths in the utilization of hybrid\nsystems comprised of magnets and superconductors.\n", "  New data are reported from a second run of the 2-liter PICO-2L C$_3$F$_8$\nbubble chamber with a total exposure of 129$\\,$kg-days at a thermodynamic\nthreshold energy of 3.3$\\,$keV. These data show that measures taken to control\nparticulate contamination in the superheated fluid resulted in the absence of\nthe anomalous background events observed in the first run of this bubble\nchamber. One single nuclear-recoil event was observed in the data, consistent\nboth with the predicted background rate from neutrons and with the observed\nrate of unambiguous multiple-bubble neutron scattering events. The chamber\nexhibits the same excellent electron-recoil and alpha decay rejection as was\npreviously reported. These data provide the most stringent direct detection\nconstraints on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-proton spin-dependent\nscattering to date for WIMP masses $<$ 50$\\,$GeV/c$^2$.\n", "  We describe a measurement of the ratio of the cross sections times branching\nfractions of the $B_c^+$ meson in the decay mode $B_c^+ \\rightarrow J/\\psi\n\\mu\\nu$ to the $B^+$ meson in the decay mode $B^+ \\rightarrow J/\\psi K^+$ in\nproton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. The\nmeasurement is based on the complete CDF Run II data set, which comes from an\nintegrated luminosity of $8.7\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$. The ratio of the production\ncross sections times branching fractions for $B_c^+$ and $B_c^+$ mesons with\nmomentum transverse to the beam greater than $6~\\textrm{GeV}/c$ and rapidity\nmagnitude smaller than 0.6 is $0.211\\pm\n0.012~\\mbox{(stat)}^{+0.021}_{-0.020}~\\mbox{(syst)}$. Using the known $B^+\n\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^+$ branching fraction, the known $B^+$ production cross\nsection, and a selection of the predicted $B_c^+ \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\mu\\nu$\nbranching fractions, the range for the total $B_c^+$ production cross section\nis estimated.\n", "  Through analyzing the $B_{(s)}$ charmed decays $B^{0}\\to \\bar D_{0}f_0(980)$\nand $B_{s}\\to \\bar D_{0}f_0(980)$ within the framework of the PQCD\nfactorization approach and comparing with the current data, we find that there\nare two possible regions for the $f_0(980)-f_0(500)$ mixing angle $\\theta$: one\nis centered at $34^\\circ\\sim38^\\circ$ and the other is falls into\n$142^\\circ\\sim154^\\circ$. The former can overlap mostly with one of allowed\nangle regions extracted from the decay $B^{0}\\to \\bar D_{0}f_0(500)$. The\nbranching fractions of $B_s$ decay modes are less sensitive to the mixing angle\ncompared with those of B decay modes. Especially, for the decay $B_{s}\\to D^0\nf_0(980)$, its branching fraction changes only slightly between\n$(1.2\\sim1.8)\\times10^{-7}$ when the mixing angle $\\theta$ runs from $0^\\circ$\nto $180^\\circ$. All of our results support the picture that the $f_0(980)$ is\ndominated by two quark component in the B decay dynamic mechanism. Furthermore,\nthe $s\\bar s$ component is more important than the $q\\bar q=(u\\bar u+d\\bar\nd)/\\sqrt{2}$ component. This point is different from $f_0(500)/\\sigma$. Last\nbut not least, our picture is not in conflict with the popular four-quark\nexplanation.\n", "  Flavor SU(3) symmetry is a powerful tool to analyze charmed baryon decays,\nhowever its applicability remains to be experimentally validated. Since there\nis not much data on $\\Xi_c$ decays, various exclusive $\\Lambda_c$ decays\nespecially the ones into a neutron state are essential for the test of flavor\nsymmetry. These decay modes are also helpful to investigate final state\ninteractions in charmed baryon decays. In this work, we discuss the explicit\nroles of $\\Lambda_c$ decays into a neutron in testing the flavor symmetry and\nexploring final state interactions. The involved decay modes include\nsemileptonic decays, two-body and three-body non-leptonic decays, but all of\nthem have not been experimentally observed to date.\n", "  We identify a large family of ground states of a topological Skyrmion magnet\nwhose classical degeneracy persists to all orders in a semiclassical expansion.\nThis goes along with an exceptional robustness of the concomitant ground state\nconfigurations, which are not at all dressed by quantum fluctuations. We trace\nthese twin observations back to a common root: this class of topological ground\nstates saturates a Bogomolny inequality. A similar phenomenology occurs in\nhigh-energy physics for some field theories exhibiting supersymmetry. We\npropose quantum Hall ferromagnets, where these Skyrmions configurations arise\nnaturally as ground states away from integer filling, as the best available\nlaboratory realisations.\n", "  A microring depletion modulator is demonstrated with T-shaped lateral p-n\njunctions used to realize efficient modulation while maximizing the RC limited\nbandwidth. The device having a 3 dB bandwidth of 13 GHz has been fabricated in\na standard 45 nm microelectronics CMOS process. The cavity has a linewidth of\n17 GHz and an average wavelength-shift of 9 pm/V in reverse-bias conditions.\n", "  Glasses display a wide array of nonlinear acoustic phenomena at temperatures\n$T\\lesssim 1$ K. This behavior has traditionally been explained by an ensemble\nof weakly-coupled, two-level tunneling states, a theory that is also used to\ndescribe the thermodynamic properties of glasses at low temperatures. One of\nthe most striking acoustic signatures in this regime is the existence of phonon\nechoes, a feature that has been associated with two-level systems with the same\nformalism as spin echoes in NMR. Here we report the existence of distinctly\ndifferent type of acoustic echo in classical models of glassy materials. Our\nsimulations consist of finite-ranged, repulsive spheres and also particles with\nattractive forces using Lennard-Jones interactions. We show that these echoes\nare due to anharmonic, weakly-coupled vibrational modes, and perhaps provide an\nalternative explanation for the phonon echoes observed in glasses at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  The Gaia ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey (GES) is providing the astronomical\ncommunity with high-precision measurements of many stellar parameters including\nradial velocities (RVs) of stars belonging to several young clusters and\nstar-forming regions. One of the main goals of the young cluster observations\nis to study of their dynamical evolution and provide insight into their future,\nrevealing if they will eventually disperse to populate the field, rather than\nevolve into bound open clusters. In this paper we report the analysis of the\ndynamical state of L1688 in the $\\rho$~Ophiuchi molecular cloud using the\ndataset provided by the GES consortium. We performed the membership selection\nof the more than 300 objects observed. Using the presence of the lithium\nabsorption and the location in the Hertzspung-Russell diagram, we identify 45\nalready known members and two new association members. We provide accurate RVs\nfor all 47 confirmed members.A dynamical analysis, after accounting for\nunresolved binaries and errors, shows that the stellar surface population of\nL1688 has a velocity dispersion $\\sigma \\sim$1.14$\\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$ that is\nconsistent with being in virial equilibrium and is bound with a $\\sim$80%\nprobability. We also find a velocity gradient in the stellar surface population\nof $\\sim$1.0 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ in the northwest/southeast direction, which\nis consistent with that found for the pre-stellar dense cores, and we discuss\nthe possibility of sequential and triggered star formation in L1688.\n", "  Over the past decade donor spin qubits in isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si\nhave been intensely studied due to their exceptionally long coherence times.\nMore recently bismuth donor electron spins have become popular because Bi has a\nlarge nuclear spin which gives rise to clock transitions (first-order\ninsensitive to magnetic field noise). At every clock transition there are two\nnearly degenerate transitions between four distinct states which can be used as\na pair of qubits. Here it is experimentally demonstrated that these transitions\nare excited by microwaves of opposite helicity such that they can be\nselectively driven by varying microwave polarization. This work uses a\ncombination of a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) microresonator and a\ndielectric resonator to flexibly generate arbitrary elliptical polarizations\nwhile retaining the high sensitivity of the CPW.\n", "  We obtain the phase diagram for a harmonically trapped dilute dipolar\ncondensate with a short ranged conservative three-body interaction. We show\nthat this system supports two distinct fluid states: a usual condensate state\nand a self-cohering droplet state. We develop a simple model to quantify the\nenergetics of these states, which we verify with full numerical calculations.\nBased on our simple model we develop a phase diagram showing that there is a\nfirst order phase transition between the states. Using dynamical simulations we\nexplore the phase transition dynamics, revealing that the droplet crystal\nobserved in previous work is an excited state that arises from heating as the\nsystem crosses the phase transition. Utilising our phase diagram we show it is\nfeasible to produce a single droplet by dynamically adjusting the confining\npotential.\n", "  We present a study of the star formation and central black hole accretion\nactivity of the galaxies hosted in the two nearby (z$\\sim$0.2) rich galaxy\nclusters Abell 983 and 1731. Aims: We are able to quantify both the obscured\nand unobscured star formation rates, as well as the presence of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) as a function of the environment in which the galaxy is located.\nMethods: We targeted the clusters with unprecedented deep infrared Spitzer\nobservations (0.2 mJy @ 24 micron), near-IR Palomar imaging and optical WIYN\nspectroscopy. The extent of our observations ($\\sim$ 3 virial radii) covers the\nvast range of possible environments, from the very dense cluster centre to the\nvery rarefied cluster outskirts and accretion regions. Results: The star\nforming members of the two clusters present star formation rates comparable\nwith those measured in coeval field galaxies. The analysis of the spatial\narrangement of the spectroscopically confirmed members reveals an elongated\ndistribution for A1731 with respect to the more uniform distribution of A983.\nThe emerging picture is compatible with A983 being a fully evolved cluster, in\ncontrast with the still actively accreting A1731. Conclusions: The analysis of\nthe specific star formation rate reveals evidence of on-going galaxy\npre-processing along A1731's filament-like structure. Furthermore, the decrease\nin the number of star forming galaxies and AGN towards the cluster cores\nsuggests that the cluster environment is accelerating the ageing process of\ngalaxies and blocking further accretion of the cold gas that fuels both star\nformation and black hole accretion activity.\n", "  We introduce a class of permutation centralizer algebras which underly the\ncombinatorics of multi-matrix gauge invariant observables. One family of such\nnon-commutative algebras is parametrised by two integers. Its Wedderburn-Artin\ndecomposition explains the counting of restricted Schur operators, which were\nintroduced in the physics literature to describe open strings attached to giant\ngravitons and were subsequently used to diagonalize the Gaussian inner product\nfor gauge invariants of 2-matrix models. The structure of the algebra, notably\nits dimension, its centre and its maximally commuting sub-algebra, is related\nto Littlewood-Richardson numbers for composing Young diagrams. It gives a\nprecise characterization of the minimal set of charges needed to distinguish\narbitrary matrix gauge invariants, which are related to enhanced symmetries in\ngauge theory. The algebra also gives a star product for matrix invariants. The\ncentre of the algebra allows efficient computation of a sector of multi-matrix\ncorrelators. These generate the counting of a certain class of bi-coloured\nribbon graphs with arbitrary genus.\n", "  We observed total and polarized radio continuum emission from the spiral\ngalaxy M 101 at 6.2 cm and 11.1 cm wavelengths with the Effelsberg telescope.\nWe use these data to study various emission components in M 101 and properties\nof the magnetic field. Separation of thermal and non-thermal emission shows\nthat the thermal emission is closely correlated with the spiral arms, while the\nnon-thermal emission is more smoothly distributed indicating diffusion of\ncosmic ray electrons away from their places of origin. The radial distribution\nof both emissions has a break near R=16 kpc, where it steepens to an\nexponential scale length of about 5 kpc, which is about 2.5 times smaller than\nat R<16 kpc. The distribution of the polarized emission has a broad maximum\nnear R=12 kpc and beyond R=16 kpc also decreases with about 5 kpc scalelength.\nIt seems that near R=16 kpc a major change in the structure of M 101 takes\nplace, which also affects the distributions of the strength of the random and\nordered magnetic field. Beyond R=16 kpc the radial scale length of both fields\nis about 20 kpc, which implies that they decrease to about 0.3 \\mu G at R=70\nkpc, which is the largest optical extent. The equipartition strength of the\ntotal field ranges from nearly 10 \\mu G at R<2 kpc to 4 \\mu G at R=22-24 kpc.\nAs the random field dominates in M 101, wavelength-independent polarization is\nthe main polarization mechanism. We show that energetic events causing HI\nshells of mean diameter <625 pc could partly be responsible for this. At radii\n<24 kpc, the random magnetic field depends on the star formation rate per area\nwith a power-law exponent of 0.28+-0.02. The ordered magnetic field is\ngenerally aligned with the spiral arms with pitch angles that are about 8{\\deg}\nlarger than those of HI filaments.\n", "  We study the self-assembly leading to a gel transition occurring in a\nnumerical model of a solution of slender, colloidal sized particles, called\nlaths, who interact mostly in the direction perpendicular to their areas. At\nthe particle level, the attraction causes them to align into long aggregates of\nseveral particles, called whiskers in the literature. To simulate the process,\nwe have developed a Brownian dynamics model in which the attractive interaction\ncomes from a potential energy that depends on both the relative orientation of\nthe laths as well as normal vectors to their areas, disregarding their width.\nThe simplicity of the model allows the simulation to reach large enough times,\nof the order of minutes, needed to simulate numerical rheology tests. With this\nwe are able to characterize the whisker formation, as well as to simulate the\ngel transition. A a conclusion of this work, we have shown that the gel\ntransition can occur even if the whiskers are not allowed to branch, as is the\ncase in this model.\n", "  Context. The recent detection of warm H$_2$O vapor emission from the outflows\nof carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars challenges the current\nunderstanding of circumstellar chemistry. Two mechanisms have been invoked to\nexplain warm H$_2$O vapor formation. In the first, periodic shocks passing\nthrough the medium immediately above the stellar surface lead to H$_2$O\nformation. In the second, penetration of ultraviolet interstellar radiation\nthrough a clumpy circumstellar medium leads to the formation of H$_2$O\nmolecules in the intermediate wind.\n  Aims. We aim to determine the properties of H$_2$O emission for a sample of\n18 carbon-rich AGB stars and subsequently constrain which of the above\nmechanisms provides the most likely warm H$_2$O formation pathway.\n  Methods, Results, and Conclusions. See paper.\n", "  We develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of the quantum coherence\nof light emitted by two independent single-photon sources in an arbitrary\nenvironment. The theory provides design rules for the control of the degree of\nquantum coherence, in terms of classical quantities widely used in\nnanophotonics. As an important example, we derive generalized conditions to\ngenerate superradiant and subradiant states of the emitters, and demonstrate\nthe ability of a structured environment to induce long-range quantum coherence.\nThese results should have broad applications in quantum nanophotonics, and for\nthe sensing of fluorescent sources in complex environments.\n", "  To characterize the mechanisms of planet formation it is crucial to\ninvestigate the properties and evolution of protoplanetary disks around young\nstars, where the initial conditions for the growth of planets are set. Our goal\nis to study grain growth in the disk of the young, intermediate mass star\nHD163296 where dust processing has already been observed, and to look for\nevidence of growth by ice condensation across the CO snowline, already\nidentified in this disk with ALMA. Under the hypothesis of optically thin\nemission we compare images at different wavelengths from ALMA and VLA to\nmeasure the opacity spectral index across the disk and thus the maximum grain\nsize. We also use a Bayesian tool based on a two-layer disk model to fit the\nobservations and constrain the dust surface density. The measurements of the\nopacity spectral index indicate the presence of large grains and pebbles\n($\\geq$1 cm) in the inner regions of the disk (inside $\\sim$50 AU) and smaller\ngrains, consistent with ISM sizes, in the outer disk (beyond 150 AU).\nRe-analysing ALMA Band 7 Science Verification data we find (radially)\nunresolved excess continuum emission centered near the location of the CO\nsnowline at $\\sim$90 AU. Our analysis suggests a grain size distribution\nconsistent with an enhanced production of large grains at the CO snowline and\nconsequent transport to the inner regions. Our results combined with the excess\nin infrared scattered light found by Garufi et al. (2014) suggests the presence\nof a structure at 90~AU involving the whole vertical extent of the disk. This\ncould be evidence for small scale processing of dust at the CO snowline.\n", "  Explicit formulas for Segal-Sugawara vectors associated with the simple Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of type $G_2$ are found by using computer-assisted\ncalculations. This leads to a direct proof of the Feigin-Frenkel theorem\ndescribing the center of the corresponding affine vertex algebra at the\ncritical level. As an application, we give an explicit solution of Vinberg's\nquantization problem by providing formulas for generators of maximal\ncommutative subalgebras of $U(\\mathfrak{g})$. We also calculate the eigenvalues\nof the Hamiltonians on the Bethe vectors in the Gaudin model associated with\n$\\mathfrak{g}$.\n", "  The relativistic analogue of the Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK)\nhydrodynamics is derived making use of the phenomenological method similar to\nthat used by Bekarevich and Khalatnikov [1] in their derivation of\nHVBK-hydrodynamics. The resulting equations describe a finite-temperature\nsuperfluid liquid with the distributed vorticity. The main dissipative effects,\nincluding mutual friction, are taken into account. The proposed hydrodynamics\nis needed for reliable modeling of the dynamical properties of superfluid\nneutron stars.\n", "  Vela X-1 is among the best studied and most luminous accreting X-ray pulsars.\nThe supergiant optical companion produces a strong radiatively-driven stellar\nwind, which is accreted onto the neutron star producing highly variable X-ray\nemission. A complex phenomenology, due to both gravitational and radiative\neffects, needs to be taken into account in order to reproduce orbital spectral\nvariations. We have investigated the spectral and light curve properties of the\nX-ray emission from Vela X-1 along the binary orbit. These studies allow to\nconstrain the stellar wind properties and its perturbations induced by the\ncompact object. We took advantage of the All Sky Monitor MAXI/GSC data to\nanalyze Vela X-1 spectra and light curves. By studying the orbital profiles in\nthe $4-10$ and $10-20$ keV energy bands, we extracted a sample of orbital light\ncurves (${\\sim}15$% of the total) showing a dip around the inferior\nconjunction, i.e., a double-peaked shape. We analyzed orbital phase-averaged\nand phase-resolved spectra of both the double-peaked and the standard sample.\nThe dip in the double-peaked sample needs $N_H\\sim2\\times10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ to\nbe explained by absorption solely, which is not observed in our analysis. We\nshow how Thomson scattering from an extended and ionized accretion wake can\ncontribute to the observed dip. Fitted by a cutoff power-law model, the two\nanalyzed samples show orbital modulation of the photon index, hardening by\n${\\sim}0.3$ around the inferior conjunction, compared to earlier and later\nphases, hinting a likely inadequacy of this model. On the contrary, including a\npartial covering component at certain orbital phase bins allows a constant\nphoton index along the orbital phases, indicating a highly inhomogeneous\nenvironment. We discuss our results in the framework of possible scenarios.\n", "  Tourism is becoming a significant contributor to medium and long range\ntravels in an increasingly globalized world. Leisure traveling has an important\nimpact on the local and global economy as well as on the environment. The study\nof touristic trips is thus raising a considerable interest. In this work, we\napply a method to assess the attractiveness of 20 of the most popular touristic\nsites worldwide using geolocated tweets as a proxy for human mobility. We first\nrank the touristic sites based on the spatial distribution of the visitors'\nplace of residence. The Taj Mahal, the Pisa Tower and the Eiffel Tower appear\nconsistently in the top 5 in these rankings. We then pass to a coarser scale\nand classify the travelers by country of residence. Touristic site's visiting\nfigures are then studied by country of residence showing that the Eiffel Tower,\nTimes Square and the London Tower welcome the majority of the visitors of each\ncountry. Finally, we build a network linking sites whenever a user has been\ndetected in more than one site. This allow us to unveil relations between\ntouristic sites and find which ones are more tightly interconnected.\n", "  We present an approach to computing probabilities in quantum field theory for\na wide class of source-detector models. The approach works directly with\nprobabilities and not with squared matrix elements, and the resulting\nprobabilities can be written in terms of expectation values of nested\ncommutators and anti-commutators. We present results that help in the\nevaluation of these, including an expression for the vacuum expectation values\nof general nestings of commutators and anti-commutators in scalar field theory.\nThis approach allows one to see clearly how faster-than-light signalling is\nprevented, because it leads to a diagrammatic expansion in which the retarded\npropagator plays a prominent role. We illustrate the formalism using the simple\ncase of the much-studied Fermi two-atom problem.\n", "  The synthesis and crystallographic, thermodynamic and transport properties of\nsingle crystalline Rh$_{9}$In$_4$S$_4$ were studied. The resistivity,\nmagnetization and specific heat measurements all clearly indicate bulk\nsuperconductivity with a critical temperature, $T_{c}\\sim$ 2.25 K. The\nSommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma$ and the Debye\ntemperature($\\varTheta_{\\textrm{D}}$) were found to be 34 mJ mol$^{-1}$\nK$^{-2}$ and 217 K respectively. The observed specific heat jump, $\\Delta\nC/\\gamma T_{c}$ = 1.66, is larger than the expected BCS weak coupling value of\n1.43. Ginzburg-Landau (GL) ratio of the low temperature GL-penetration depth,\n$\\lambda_\\text{GL}$$\\approx$ 5750\\AA, to the GL-coherence length,\n$\\xi_\\text{GL}$$\\approx$ 94\\AA, is large: $\\kappa$ $\\sim$ 60. Furthermore, we\nobserved a peak effect in the resistivity measurement as a function of both\ntemperature and magnetic field.\n", "  Amplitude noise which inflicts a random two qubit term is one of the main\nobstacles preventing the implementation of a high fidelity two-body gate below\nthe fault tolerance threshold. This noise is difficult to refocus as any\nrefocusing technique could only tackle noise with frequency below the operation\nrate. Since the two qubit gate speed is normally the slowest rate in the\nsystem, it constitutes the last bottleneck towards an implementation of a gate\nbelow the fault tolerant threshold. Here we propose to use composite pulses as\na dynamical decoupling approach, in order to reduce two qubit gate noise for\ntrapped ions systems. This is done by refocusing the building blocks of\nultrafast entangling gates, where the amplitude noise is reduced to\nshot-to-shot (STS) noise. We present detailed simulations showing that the\nfault-tolerance threshold could be achieved with the proposed approach.\n", "  Open cluster (OC) stars share the same age and metallicity, and, in general,\ntheir age and mass can be estimated with higher precision than for field stars.\nFor this reason, OCs are considered an important laboratory to study the\nrelation between the physical properties of the planets and those of their host\nstars, and the evolution of planetary systems. We started an observational\ncampaign within the GAPS collaboration to search for and characterize planets\nin OCs We monitored the Praesepe member Pr0211 to improve the eccentricity of\nthe Hot-Jupiter (HJ) already known to orbit this star and search for additional\nplanets. An eccentric orbit for the HJ would support a planet-planet scattering\nprocess after its formation. From 2012 to 2015, we collected 70 radial velocity\n(RV) measurements with HARPS-N and 36 with TRES of Pr0211. Simultaneous\nphotometric observations were carried out with the robotic STELLA telescope in\norder to characterize the stellar activity. We discovered a long-term trend in\nthe RV residuals that we show to be due to the presence of a second, massive,\nouter planet. Orbital parameters for the two planets are derived by\nsimultaneously fitting RVs and photometric light curves, with the activity\nsignal modelled as a series of sinusoids at the rotational period of the star\nand its harmonics. We confirm that Pr0211b has a nearly circular orbit ($e =\n0.02 \\pm 0.01$), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the\nprevious determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr0211c has a\nmass $M_p\\sin i = 7.9 \\pm 0.2 M_J$, a period $P>$3500 days and a very eccentric\norbit ($e>$0.60). Such peculiar systems may be typical of open clusters if the\nplanet-planet scattering phase leading to the formation of HJs is caused by\nstellar encounters rather than unstable primordial orbits. Pr0211 is the first\nmulti-planet system discovered around an OC star. (abridged)\n", "  When a planet transits its host star, it blocks regions of the stellar\nsurface from view; this causes a distortion of the spectral lines and a change\nin the line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\neffect. Since the LOS velocities depend, in part, on the stellar rotation, the\nRM waveform is sensitive to the star-planet alignment (which provides\ninformation on the system's dynamical history). We present a new RM modelling\ntechnique that directly measures the spatially-resolved stellar spectrum behind\nthe planet. This is done by scaling the continuum flux of the (HARPS) spectra\nby the transit light curve, and then subtracting the in- from the\nout-of-transit spectra to isolate the starlight behind the planet. This\ntechnique does not assume any shape for the intrinsic local profiles. In it, we\nalso allow for differential stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations in\nthe convective blueshift. We apply this technique to HD189733 and compare to 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We reject rigid body rotation with high\nconfidence (> 99% probability), which allows us to determine the occulted\nstellar latitudes and measure the stellar inclination. In turn, we determine\nboth the sky-projected (lambda ~ -0.4 +/- 0.2 degrees) and true 3D obliquity\n(psi ~ 7^+12_-4 degrees). We also find good agreement with the MHD simulations,\nwith no significant centre-to-limb variations detectable in the local profiles.\nHence, this technique provides a new powerful tool that can probe stellar\nphotospheres, differential rotation, determine 3D obliquities, and remove\nsky-projection biases in planet migration theories. This technique can be\nimplemented with existing instrumentation, but will become even more powerful\nwith the next generation of high-precision radial velocity spectrographs.\n", "  As a part of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, we\nperformed a simultaneous 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0) mapping toward\nmolecular clouds in a region encompassing 3.75 square degrees. We reveal three\nmolecular clouds, the 15 km/s cloud, the 27 km/s cloud, and the 50 km/s cloud,\nin the surveyed region. The 50 km/s cloud is resolved with an angular\nresolution of around 1' for the first time. Investigating their morphology and\nvelocity structures, we find that the 27 km/s cloud is likely affected by\nfeedback from the stellar association Mon OB3 and the 50 km/s cloud is\ncharacterised by three large expanding molecular shells. The region is mapped\nin C18O (1-0) for the first time. We discover seven C18O clumps, which are\nlikely to form massive stars, and 15 dust clumps based on the BGPS archival\ndata. Using infrared color-color diagrams, we find 56 Class I and 107 Class II\nyoung stellar object (YSO) candidates. According to the distribution of YSO\ncandidates, an overdensity is found around the HII region S287 and the\nintersection of two shells, indicative of triggering. The star formation\nefficiency and rate of the 27~km/s cloud are discussed. Comparing the observed\nvalues of the filament S287-main with the models of fragmentation, we suggest\nthat turbulence controls the large scale of fragmentation in the filament while\ngravitational fragmentation plays an important role in the formation of YSOs on\nthe small scale. We find that star-forming gas tends to have higher excitation\ntemperature, higher 13CO opacity, and higher column density than\nnon-star-forming gas, which is consistent with the point that star formation\nhappens in denser gas and star-forming gas is heated by YSOs. Using the 1.1 mm\ndust emission to trace dense gas, we obtain a dense gas fraction of 2.7%-10.4%\nfor the 27 km/s cloud.\n", "  Besides total energy, three-dimensional incompressible Hall\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) possesses two inviscid invariants which are the\nmagnetic helicity and the generalized helicity. New exact relations are derived\nfor homogeneous (non-isotropic) stationary Hall MHD turbulence (and also for\nits inertialess electron MHD limit) with non-zero helicities and in the\nasymptotic limit of large Reynolds numbers. The universal laws are written only\nin terms of mixed second-order structure functions, i.e. the scalar product of\ntwo different increments. It provides, therefore, a direct measurement of the\ndissipation rates for the corresponding invariant flux. This study shows that\nthe generalized helicity cascade is strongly linked to the left polarized\nfluctuations while the magnetic helicity cascade is linked to the right\npolarized fluctuations.\n", "  The sulphur compounds SO and SO$_2$ have not been widely studied in the\ncircumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. By presenting\nand modelling a large number of SO and SO$_2$ lines in the low mass-loss rate\nM-type AGB star R Dor, and modelling the available lines of those molecules in\na further four M-type AGB stars, we aim to determine their circumstellar\nabundances and distributions. We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis\nbased on the accelerated lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and\nSO$_2$ line emission and molecular data files for both SO and SO$_2$ that are\nmore extensive than those previously available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2\nlines to constrain our models for R Dor, we find an SO abundance of\n6.7x10$^{-6}$ and an SO$_2$ abundance of 5x10$^{-6}$ with both species having\nhigh abundances close to the star. We also modelled $^{34}$SO and found an\nabundance of 3.1x10$^{-7}$, giving an $^{32}$SO/$^{34}$SO ratio of 21.6. We\nderive similar results for the circumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances and their\ndistributions for the low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the\ncircumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances are much higher than predicted by\nchemical models and these two species may account for all available sulphur.\nFor the higher mass-loss rate stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with\npeak abundances that decrease and peak abundance radii that increase with\nincreasing mass-loss rate. The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very\nwell with the photodissociation radii of H$_2$O. We find evidence that SO is\nmost likely through the photodissociation of H$_2$O and the subsequent reaction\nbetween S and OH. The S-bearing parent molecule appears not to be H$_2$S. The\nSO$_2$ models suggest an origin close to the star for this species, also\ndisagreeing with current chemical models.\n", "  Introducing the DRAGON simulation project, we present direct $N$-body\nsimulations of four massive globular clusters (GCs) with $10^6$ stars and 5$\\%$\nprimordial binaries at a high level of accuracy and realism. The GC evolution\nis computed with NBODY6++GPU and follows the dynamical and stellar evolution of\nindividual stars and binaries, kicks of neutron stars and black holes, and the\neffect of a tidal field. We investigate the evolution of the luminous (stellar)\nand dark (faint stars and stellar remnants) GC components and create mock\nobservations of the simulations (i.e. photometry, color-magnitude diagrams,\nsurface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles). By connecting internal\nprocesses to observable features we highlight the formation of a long-lived\n'dark' nuclear subsystem made of black holes (BHs), which results in a\ntwo-component structure. The inner core is dominated by the BH subsystem and\nexperiences a core collapse phase within the first Gyr. It can be detected in\nthe stellar (luminous) line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. The outer\nextended core - commonly observed in the (luminous) surface brightness profiles\n- shows no collapse features and is continuously expanding. We demonstrate how\na King (1966) model fit to observed clusters might help identify the presence\nof post core-collapse BH subsystems. For global observables like core and\nhalf-mass radii the direct simulations agree well with Monte-Carlo models.\nVariations in the initial mass function can result in significantly different\nGC properties (e.g. density distributions) driven by varying amounts of early\nmass loss and the number of forming BHs.\n", "  Tentative evidence that the properties of evolved stars with planets may be\ndifferent from what we know for MS hosts has been recently reported. We aim to\ntest whether evolved stars with planets show any chemical peculiarity that\ncould be related to the planet formation process. We determine in a consistent\nway the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of evolved\n(subgiants and red giants) and MS stars with and without known planetary\ncompanions. No differences in the <[X/Fe]> vs. condensation temperature (Tc)\nslopes are found between the samples of planet and non-planet hosts when all\nelements are considered. However, if the analysis is restricted to only\nrefractory elements, differences in the Tc-slopes between stars with and\nwithout known planets are found. This result is found to be dependent on the\nstellar evolutionary stage, as it holds for MS and subgiant stars, while there\nseem to be no difference between planet and non-planet hosts among the sample\nof giants. A search for correlations between the Tc-slope and the stellar\nproperties reveals significant correlations with the stellar mass and the\nstellar age. The data also suggest that differences in terms of mass and age\nbetween MS planet and non-planet hosts may be present. Our results are well\nexplained by radial mixing in the Galaxy. The sample of giant contains stars\nmore massive and younger than their MS counterparts. This leads to a sample of\nstars possibly less contaminated by stars not born in the solar neighbourhood,\nleading to no chemical differences between planet and non planet hosts. The\nsample of MS stars may contain more stars from the outer disc (specially the\nnon-planet host sample) which might led to the differences observed in the\nchemical trends.\n", "  We present the magnetic field dependencies of transport properties for\n$R$PtBi ($R$ = Gd, Dy, Tm, and Lu) half-Heusler compounds. Temperature and\nfield dependent resistivity measurements of high quality $R$PtBi single\ncrystals reveal an unusually large, non-saturating magnetoresistance (MR) up to\n300 K under a moderate magnetic field of $H$ = 140 kOe. At 300 K, the large MR\neffect decreases as the rare-earth is traversed from Gd to Lu and the magnetic\nfield dependence of MR shows a deviation from the conventional $H^{2}$\nbehavior. The Hall coefficient ($R_{H}$) for $R$ = Gd indicates a sign change\naround 120 K, whereas $R_{H}$ curves for $R$ = Dy, Tm, and Lu remain positive\nfor all measured temperatures. At 300 K, the Hall resistivity reveals a\ndeviation from the linear field dependence for all compounds. Thermoelectric\npower measurements on this family show strong temperature and magnetic field\ndependencies which are consistent with resistivity measurements. A highly\nenhanced thermoelectric power under applied magnetic field is observed as high\nas $\\sim$100 $\\mu$V/K at 140 kOe. Analysis of the transport data in this series\nreveals that the rare-earth-based Half-Husler compounds provide opportunities\nto tune MR effect through lanthanide contraction and to elucidate the mechanism\nof non-trivial MR.\n", "  Quark matter at high density may exhibit color superconductivity. As magnetic\nflux tubes in metallic superconductors, color magnetic flux tubes as\nnon-Abelian vortices appear in the color-flavor locked phase of high density\nQCD. ${\\mathbb C}P^2$ Nambu-Goldstone bosons and Majorana fermions belonging to\nthe triplet representation are known to be localized around a non-Abelian\nvortex. In this paper, we determine the coupling of these bosonic and fermionic\nmodes by using the nonlinear realization method.\n", "  We systematically map out the jamming transition of all 2D bidisperse\nmixtures of frictionless disks in the hard particle limit. The critical volume\nfraction, mean coordination number, number of rattlers, structural order\nparameters, and bulk modulus each show a rich variation with mixture\ncomposition and particle size ratio, and can therefore be tuned by choosing\ncertain mixtures. We identify two local minima in the critical volume fraction,\nboth of which have low structural order; one minimum is close to the widely\nstudied 50:50 mixture of particles with a ratio of radii of 1:1.4. We also\nidentify a region at low size ratios characterized by increased structural\norder and high rattler fractions, with a corresponding enhancement in the\nstiffness.\n", "  Liouville's theorem in a grand ensemble, that is for situations where a\nsystem is in equilibrium with a reservoir of energy and particles, is a subject\nthat, to our knowledge, has not been explicitly treated in literature related\nto molecular simulation. Instead Liouville's theorem, a central concept for the\ncorrect employment of molecular simulation techniques, is implicitly considered\nonly within the framework of systems where the total number of particles is\nfixed. However the pressing demand of applied science in treating open systems\nleads to the question of the existence and possible exact formulation of\nLiouville's theorem when the number of particles changes during the dynamical\nevolution of the system. The intention of this note is to stimulate a debate\nabout this crucial issue for molecular simulation.\n", "  Assuming static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in the ghost-free\nbigravity theory, we find a relativistic star solution, which is very close to\nthat in general relativity. The coupling constants are classified into two\nclasses: Class [I] and Class [II]. Although the Vainshtein screening mechanism\nis found in the weak gravitational field for both classes, we find that there\nis no regular solution beyond the critical value of the compactness in Class\n[I]. This implies that the maximum mass of a neutron star in Class [I] becomes\nmuch smaller than that in GR. On the other hand, for the solution in Class\n[II], the Vainshtein screening mechanism works well even in a relativistic star\nand the result in GR is recovered.\n", "  This is an extensive work to our previous paper \\cite{key-08} studied on the\nD0-D4/D8 holographic system. We compute the three-body force for baryons with\nthe D0-D4/D8 matrix model derived in \\cite{key-08} with considering the\nnon-zero QCD vacuum. We obtain the three-body force at short distances but\nmodified by the appearance of the smeared D0-branes i.e. considering the\neffects from the non-trivial QCD vacuum. We firstly test our matrix model in\nthe case of 't Hooft instanton and then in two more realistic case: (1)\nthree-neutrons with averaged spins and (2) proton-proton-neutron (or\nproton-neutron-proton). The three-body potential vanishes in the former case\nwhile in two latter cases it is positive i.e. repulsive and makes sense only if\nthe constraint for stable baryonic state is satisfied. We require all the\nbaryons in our computation aligned on a line. These may indicate that the cases\nin dense states of neutrons such as in neutron stars, Helium-3 or Tritium\nnucleus all with the non-trivial QCD vacuum.\n", "  The GW approximation is a well-known method to improve electronic structure\npredictions calculated within density functional theory. In this work, we have\nimplemented a computationally efficient GW approach that calculates central\nproperties within the Matsubara-time domain using the modified version of Elk,\nthe full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) package.\nContinuous-pole expansion (CPE), a recently proposed analytic continuation\nmethod, has been incorporated and compared to the widely used Pade\napproximation. Full crystal symmetry has been employed for computational\nspeedup. We have applied our approach to 18 well-studied\nsemiconductors/insulators that cover a wide range of band gaps computed at the\nlevels of single-shot G0W0, partially self-consistent GW0, and fully\nself-consistent GW (scGW). Our calculations show that G0W0 leads to band gaps\nthat agree well with experiment for the case of simple s-p electron systems,\nwhereas scGW is required for improving the band gaps in 3-d electron systems.\nIn addition, GW0 almost always predicts larger band gap values compared to\nscGW, likely due to the substantial underestimation of screening effects. Both\nthe CPE method and Pade approximation lead to similar band gaps for most\nsystems except strontium titantate, suggesting further investigation into the\nlatter approximation is necessary for strongly correlated systems. Our computed\nband gaps serve as important benchmarks for the accuracy of the Matsubara-time\nGW approach.\n", "  It was shown [Chin. Phys. Lett. 28, 020503 (2011)] that at zero temperature\nthe ground state of the one-dimensional (1D) $w$-component Fermi gas coincides\nwith that of the spinless Bose gas in the limit $\\omega\\to \\infty$. This\nbehaviour was experimentally evidenced through a quasi-1D tightly trapping\nultracold ${}^{173}$Yb atoms in the recent paper [Nature Physics 10, 198\n(2014)]. However, understanding of low temperature behaviour of the Fermi gases\nwith a repulsive interaction acquires spin-charge separated conformal field\ntheories of an effective Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an antiferromagnetic\n$SU(w)$ Heisenberg spin chain. Here we analytically derive universal\nthermodynamics of 1D strongly repulsive fermionic gases with $SU(w)$ symmetry\nvia the Yang-Yang thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method. The analytical free energy\nand magnetic properties of the systems at low temperatures in a weak magnetic\nfield are obtained through the Wiener-Hopf method. In particular, the free\nenergy essentially manifests the spin-charge separated conformal field theories\nfor the high symmetry systems with arbitrary repulsive interaction strength. We\nalso find that the sound velocity of the Fermi gases in the large $w$ limit\ncoincides with that for the spinless Bose gas, whereas the spin velocity\nvanishes quickly as $w$ becomes large. This indicates a strong suppression of\nthe Fermi exclusion statistics by the commutativity feature among the\n$w$-component fermions with different spin states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid phase. Moreover, the equations of state and critical behaviour of\nphysical quantities at finite temperatures are analytically derived in terms of\nthe polylogarithm functions in the quantum critical region.\n", "  We discuss a simple singular system in one dimension, two heavy particles\ninteracting with a light particle via an attractive contact interaction. It is\nnatural to apply Born-Oppenheimer approximation to this problem. We present a\ndetailed discussion of this approach, the advantage of this simple model is\nthat one can estimate the error terms self-consistently. Moreover, a Fock space\napproach to this problem is presented where a systematic expansion can be\nproposed to get higher order corrections. A slight modification of the same\nproblem in which the light particle is relativistic is discussed in a later\nsection. Here, the second quantized description is more challenging but with\nsome care one can recover the first order term as well as introducing a more\nsystematic approach to higher orders.\n", "  Recent numerical relativity simulations of mergers of binary black holes\nsuggest that the maximum final value of $a/M$ is $\\sim 0.95$ for the\ncoalescence of two equal mass black holes with aligned spins of the same\nmagnitude $a/M=0.994$ which is close to the upper limit $a/M=0.998$ of\naccretion spin-up shown by Thorne. Using the WKB method, we suggest that if\nquasinormal modes with $a/M \\sim 0.95$ are detected by the second generation\ngravitational wave detectors, we could confirm the strong gravity space-time\nbased on Einstein's general relativity up to $1.33M$ which is only $\\sim 1.014$\ntimes the event horizon radius and within the ergoregion. One more message\nabout black hole geometry is expected here. If the quasinormal mode is\ndifferent from that of general relativity, we need to find the true theory of\ngravity which deviates from general relativity only near the black hole\nhorizon.\n", "  The low-frequency peaked BL Lac object (LBL) AP Librae exhibits\nvery-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$GeV) $\\gamma$-ray emission and hosts an extended\njet, which has been detected in radio and X-rays. The jet X-ray spectral index\nimplies an inverse Compton origin. These observations are unusual for LBLs\ncalling for a consistent explanation of this extraordinary source. The\nobservationally constrained parameters necessary to describe the core emission\nwithin the standard one-zone model are unable to explain the broad-band\nspectrum, even if observationally unconstrained external photon fields are\ntaken into account. We demonstrate that the addition of the extended jet\nemission successfully reproduces the total spectral energy distribution. In\nparticular, the VHE radiation is produced in the $>100\\,$kpc long extended jet\nvia inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by highly\nrelativistic electrons. We present several ways to test this theory. The\nextended jet is weakly magnetized ($B_0 = 2.5\\,\\mu$G), while its minimum and\nmaximum electron Lorentz factors are $\\gamma_{min}=60$ and\n$\\gamma_{max}=5\\times 10^6$, respectively. The electron spectral index is\n$s=2.6$. These parameters are comparable to parameters of other blazars with\nextended X-ray jets dominated by inverse Compton scattering.\n", "  While quantum gravity is not solved yet, a screening mass for the graviton\nremains theoretically possible. If such a mass would screen gravity at\ndistances of the order of the cluster galaxy radius, it could account for the\nuniverse expansion. The modified Newtonian dynamics model also could be related\nto a screening graviton mass at inter-galactic scales. Moreover, massive spin-2\ntheories constitute a very active theoretical topic. We briefly show how the\nvery recent LIGO gravitational wave observation GW150914, emitted by a binary\nblack hole merger distant $\\sim 1.3 \\times 10^9$ ly from the Earth, tightens\nthe phenomenological bound on a massive graviton or on the screening of\ngravity.\n", "  The singlet-doublet fermion dark matter model (SDFDM) provides a good DM\ncandidate as well as the possibility of generating neutrino masses radiatively.\nThe search and identification of DM requires the combined effort of both\nindirect and direct DM detection experiments in addition to the LHC.\nRemarkably, an excess of GeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center (GCE) has been\nmeasured with the \\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) which appears to be\nrobust with respect to changes in the diffuse galactic background modeling.\nAlthough several astrophysical explanations have been proposed, DM remains a\nsimple and well motivated alternative. In this work, we examine the\nsensitivities of dark matter searches in the SDFDM scenario using\n$\\textit{Fermi}$-LAT, CTA, IceCube/DeepCore, LUX, PICO and LHC with an emphasis\non exploring the regions of the parameter space that can account for the GCE.\nWe find that DM particles present in this model with masses close to $\\sim 99$\nGeV and $\\sim (173-190)$ GeV annihilating predominantly into the $W^+W^-$\nchannel and $t\\bar{t}$ channel respectively, provide an acceptable fit to the\nGCE while being consistent with different current experimental bounds. We also\nfind that much of the obtained parameter space can be ruled out by future\ndirect search experiments like LZ and XENON-1T, in case of null results by\nthese detectors. Interestingly, we show that the most recent data by LUX is\nstarting to probe the best fit region in the SDFDM model.\n", "  We compute Green's functions with a bilinear quark operator inserted at\nnon-zero momentum for a generalized momentum configuration to two loops. These\nare required to assist lattice gauge theory measurements of the same quantity\nin matching to the high energy behaviour. The flavour non-singlet operators\nconsidered are the scalar, vector and tensor currents as well as the second\nmoment of the twist-2 Wilson operator used in deep inelastic scattering for the\nmeasurement of nucleon structure functions.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae, the culmination of massive stellar evolution, are\nspectacular astronomical events and the principle actors in the story of our\nelemental origins. Our understanding of these events, while still incomplete,\ncenters around a neutrino-driven central engine that is highly hydrodynamically\nunstable. Increasingly sophisticated simulations reveal a shock that stalls for\nhundreds of milliseconds before reviving. Though brought back to life by\nneutrino heating, the development of the supernova explosion is inextricably\nlinked to multi-dimensional fluid flows. In this paper, the outcomes of\nthree-dimensional simulations that include sophisticated nuclear physics and\nspectral neutrino transport are juxtaposed to learn about the nature of the\nthree dimensional fluid flow that shapes the explosion. Comparison is also made\nbetween the results of simulations in spherical symmetry from several groups,\nto give ourselves confidence in the understanding derived from this\njuxtaposition.\n", "  We present all Herschel PACS photometer observations of Mars, Saturn, Uranus,\nNeptune, Callisto, Ganymede, and Titan. All measurements were carefully\ninspected for quality problems, were reduced in a (semi-)standard way, and were\ncalibrated. The derived flux densities are tied to the standard PACS photometer\nresponse calibration, which is based on repeated measurements of five fiducial\nstars. The overall absolute flux uncertainty is dominated by the estimated 5%\nmodel uncertainty of the stellar models in the PACS wavelength range between 60\nand 210 micron. A comparison with the corresponding planet and satellite models\nshows excellent agreement for Uranus, Neptune, and Titan, well within the\nspecified 5%. Callisto is brighter than our model predictions by about 4-8%,\nGanymede by about 14-21%. We discuss possible reasons for the model offsets.\nThe measurements of these very bright point-like sources, together with\nobservations of stars and asteroids, show the high reliability of the PACS\nphotometer observations and the linear behavior of the PACS bolometer source\nfluxes over more than four orders of magnitude (from mJy levels up to more than\n1000 Jy). Our results show the great potential of using the observed solar\nsystem targets for cross-calibration purposes with other ground-based,\nairborne, and space-based instruments and projects. At the same time, the PACS\nresults will lead to improved model solutions for future calibration\napplications.\n", "  A partially non-ergodic ground-motion prediction equation is estimated for\nEurope and the Middle East. Therefore, a hierarchical model is presented that\naccounts for regional differences. For this purpose, the scaling of\nground-motion intensity measures is assumed to be similar, but not identical in\ndifferent regions. This is achieved by assuming a hierarchical model, where\nsome coefficients are treated as random variables which are sampled from an\nunderlying global distribution. The coefficients are estimated by Bayesian\ninference. This allows one to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in the\ncoefficients, and consequently in model predictions, in a rigorous way. The\nmodel is estimated based on peak ground acceleration data from nine different\nEuropean/Middle Eastern regions. There are large differences in the amount of\nearthquakes and records in the different regions. However, due to the\nhierarchical nature of the model, regions with only few data points borrow\nstrength from other regions with more data. This makes it possible to estimate\na separate set of coefficients for all regions. Different regionalized models\nare compared, for which different coefficients are assumed to be regionally\ndependent. Results show that regionalizing the coefficients for magnitude and\ndistance scaling leads to better performance of the models. The models for all\nregions are physically sound, even if only very few earthquakes comprise one\nregion.\n", "  We report muon spin rotation experiments on the magnetic penetration depth\nlambda and the temperature dependence of lambda^{-2} in the over-doped Fe-based\nhigh-temperature superconductor (Fe-HTS) Ba_{1-x}Rb_ xFe_2As_2 (x = 0.65)\nstudied at ambient and under hydrostatic pressures up to p = 2.3 GPa. We find\nthat in this system lambda^{-2}(T) is best described by d-wave scenario. This\nis in contrast to the case of the optimally doped x = 0.35 system which is\nknown to be a nodeless s^{+-}-wave superconductor. This suggests that the\ndoping induces the change of the pairing symmetry from s^{+-} to d-wave in\nBa_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}. In addition, we find that the d-wave order\nparameter is robust against pressure, suggesting that d is the common and\ndominant pairing symmetry in over-doped Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}. Application\nof pressure of p = 2.3 GPa causes a decrease of lambda(0) by less than 5 %,\nwhile at optimal doping x = 0.35 a significant decrease of lambda(0) was\nreported. The superconducting transition temperature T_c as well as the gap to\nT_c ratio 2Delta/k_BT_c show only a modest decrease with pressure. By combining\nthe present data with those previously obtained for optimally doped system x =\n0.35 and for the end member x = 1 we conclude that the SC gap symmetry as well\nas the pressure effects on the SC quantities strongly depend on the Rb doping\nlevel. These results are discussed in the light of the putative Lifshitz\ntransition, i.e., a disappearance of the electron pockets in the Fermi surface\nof Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} upon hole doping.\n", "  We present a detailed study of X-ray absorption in the local interstellar\nmedium by analyzing the X-ray spectra of 24 galactic sources obtained with the\n{\\it Chandra} High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer and the {\\it\nXMM-Newton} Reflection Grating Spectrometer. By modeling the continuum with a\nsimple broken power-law and by implementing the new {\\tt ISMabs} X-ray\nabsorption model, we have estimated the total H, O, Ne, and Fe column densities\ntowards the observed sources. We have determined the absorbing material\ndistribution as a function of source distance and galactic latitude--longitude.\nDirect estimates of the fractions of neutrally, singly, and doubly ionized\nspecies of O, Ne, and Fe reveal the dominance of the cold component, thus\nindicating an overall low degree of ionization. Our results are expected to be\nsensitive to the model used to describe the continuum in all sources.\n", "  Open clusters are distributed all across the disk and are convenient tracers\nof its properties. In particular, outer disk clusters bear a key role for the\ninvestigation of the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk. The goal of this\nstudy is to derive homogeneous elemental abundances for a sample of ten outer\ndisk OCs, and investigate possible links with disk structures such as the\nGalactic Anticenter Stellar Structure. We analyse high-resolution spectra of\nred giants, obtained from the HIRES@Keck and UVES@VLT archives. We derive\nelemental abundances and stellar atmosphere parameters by means of the\nclassical equivalent width method. We also performed orbit integrations using\nproper motions. The Fe abundances we derive trace a shallow negative radial\nmetallicity gradient of slope -0.027+/-0.007 dex.kpc-1 in the outer 12 kpc of\nthe disk. The [alpha/Fe] gradient appears flat, with a slope of 0.006+/-0.007\ndex.kpc-1 . The two outermost clusters (Be 29 and Sau 1) appear to follow\nelliptical orbits. Be 20 also exhibits a peculiar orbit with a large excursion\nabove the plane. The irregular orbits of the three most metal-poor clusters (of\nwhich two are located at the edge of the Galactic disk), if confirmed by more\nrobust astrometric measurements such as those of the Gaia mission, are\ncompatible with an inside-out formation scenario for the Milky Way, in which\nextragalactic material is accreted onto the outer disk. We cannot determine if\nBe 20, Be 29,and Sau 1 are of extragalactic origin, as they may be old genuine\nGalactic clusters whose orbits were perturbed by accretion events or minor\nmergers in the past 5 Gyr, or they may be representants of the thick disk\npopulation. The nature of these objects is intriguing and deserves further\ninvestigations in the near future.\n", "  Theoretical attempts proposed so far to describe ordinary percolation\nprocesses on real-world networks rely on the locally tree-like ansatz. Such an\napproximation, however, holds only to a limited extent, as real graphs are\noften characterized by high frequencies of short loops. We present here a\ntheoretical framework able to overcome such a limitation for the case of site\npercolation. Our method is based on a message passing algorithm that discounts\nredundant paths along triangles in the graph. We systematically test the\napproach on 98 real-world graphs and on synthetic networks. We find excellent\naccuracy in the prediction of the whole percolation diagram, with significant\nimprovement with respect to the prediction obtained under the locally tree-like\napproximation. Residual discrepancies between theory and simulations do not\ndepend on clustering and can be attributed to the presence of loops longer than\nthree edges. We present also a method to account for clustering in bond\npercolation, but the improvement with respect to the method based on the\ntree-like approximation is much less apparent.\n", "  The Gilbert damping of ferromagnetic materials is arguably the most important\nbut least understood phenomenological parameter that dictates real-time\nmagnetization dynamics. Understanding the physical origin of the Gilbert\ndamping is highly relevant to developing future fast switching spintronics\ndevices such as magnetic sensors and magnetic random access memory. Here, we\nreport an experimental study of temperature-dependent Gilbert damping in\npermalloy (Py) thin films of varying thicknesses by ferromagnetic resonance.\nFrom the thickness dependence, two independent contributions to the Gilbert\ndamping are identified, namely bulk damping and surface damping. Of particular\ninterest, bulk damping decreases monotonically as the temperature decreases,\nwhile surface damping shows an enhancement peak at the temperature of ~50 K.\nThese results provide an important insight to the physical origin of the\nGilbert damping in ultrathin magnetic films.\n", "  The heavy fermion compound Ce$_{3}$Pd$_{20}$Si$_{6}$ displays unconventional\nquantum criticality as the lower of two consecutive phase transitions is fully\nsuppressed by magnetic field. Here we report on the effects of pressure as\nadditional tuning parameter. Specific heat and electrical resistivity\nmeasurements reveal a converse effect of pressure on the two transitions,\nleading to the merging of both transitions at 6.2 kbar. The field-induced\nquantum criticality is robust under pressure tuning. We rationalize our\nfindings within an extended version of the global phase diagram for\nantiferromagnetic heavy fermion quantum criticality.\n", "  We present a method to measure rotational transitions of molecular anions in\nthe terahertz domain by sequential two-photon absorption. Ion excitation by\nbound-bound terahertz absorption is probed by absorption in the visible on a\nbound-free transition. The visible frequency is tuned to a state-selective\nphotodetachment transition of the excited anions. This provides a terahertz\naction spectrum for just few hundred molecular ions. To demonstrate this we\nmeasure the two lowest rotational transitions, J=1<-0 and J =2<-1 of OD- anions\nin a cryogenic 22-pole trap. We obtain rotational transition frequencies of\n598596.08(19) MHz for J=1<-0 and 1196791.57(27) MHz for J=2<-1 of OD-, in good\nagreement with their only previous measurement. This two-photon scheme opens up\nterahertz rovibrational spectroscopy for a range of molecular anions, in\nparticular for polyatomic and cluster anions.\n", "  Pure disk galaxies without any bulge component, i.e., neither classical nor\npseudo, seem to have escaped the affects of merger activity inherent to\nhierarchical galaxy formation models as well as strong internal secular\nevolution.\n  We discover that a significant fraction (15 - 18 %) of disk galaxies in the\nHubble Deep Field (0.4 < z < 1.0) as well as in the local Universe (0.02 < z <\n0.05) are such pure disk systems (hereafter, PDS). The spatial distribution of\nlight in these PDS is well described by a single exponential function from the\noutskirts to the centre and appears to have remained intact over the last 8\nbillion years keeping the mean central surface brightness and scale-length\nnearly constant. These two disk parameters of PDS are brighter and shorter,\nrespectively, than of those disks which are part of disk galaxies with bulges.\n  Since the fraction of PDS as well as their profile defining parameters do not\nchange, it indicates that these galaxies have not witnessed either major\nmergers or multiple minor mergers since z~1. However, there is substantial\nincrease in their total stellar mass and total size over the same time range.\nThis suggests that smooth accretion of cold gas via cosmic filaments is the\nmost probable mode of their evolution. We speculate that PDS are dynamically\nhotter and cushioned in massive dark matter halos which may prevent them from\nundergoing strong secular evolution.\n", "  The ytterbium pyrochlore magnets, Yb2B2O7 (B = Sn, Ti, Ge) are well described\nby S_eff = 1/2 quantum spins decorating a network of corner-sharing tetrahedra\nand interacting via anisotropic exchange. Structurally, only the non-magnetic\nB-site cation, and hence, primarily the lattice parameter, is changing across\nthe series. Nonetheless, a range of magnetic behaviors are observed: the low\ntemperature magnetism in Yb2Ti2O7 and Yb2Sn2O7 has ferromagnetic character,\nwhile Yb2Ge2O7 displays an antiferromagnetically ordered Neel state at low\ntemperatures. While the static properties of the ytterbium pyrochlores are\ndistinct, inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal a common character\nto their exotic spin dynamics. All three ytterbium pyrochlores show a gapless\ncontinuum of spin excitations, resembling over-damped ferromagnetic spin waves\nat low Q. Furthermore, the specific heat of the series also follows a common\nform, with a broad, high-temperature anomaly followed by a sharp\nlow-temperature anomaly at T_C or T_N. The novel spin dynamics we report\ncorrelate strongly with the broad specific heat anomaly only, remaining\nunchanged across the sharp anomaly. This result suggests that the primary order\nparameter in the ytterbium pyrochlores associated with the sharp anomaly is\n\"hidden\" and not simple magnetic dipole order.\n", "  Context. Polarimetric observations of Bok globules frequently show a decrease\nin the degree of polarization towards their central dense regions (polarization\nholes). This behaviour is usually explained with increased disalignment owing\nto high density and temperature, or insufficient angular resolution of a\npossibly complex magnetic field structure.\n  Aims. We investigate whether a significant decrease in polarized emission of\ndense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain physical conditions.\nFor instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth effects and various\nproperties of the dust phase.\n  Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature\nstructure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate the polarized thermal\nemission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we\nconsider a magnetic field and include radiative torque and internal alignment.\n  Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the\ntemperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the magnetic field are\nalso able to significantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in\nBok globules. Taking submm/mm grains and typical column densities of existing\nBok globules into consideration, the optical depth is high enough to decrease\nthe degree of polarization by up to {\\Delta}P~10%. If limited to the densest\nregions, dust grain growth to submm/mm size and accumulated graphite grains\ndecrease the degree of polarization by up to {\\Delta}P~10% and {\\Delta}P~5%,\nrespectively. However, the effect of the graphite grains occurs only if they do\nnot align with the magnetic field.\n", "  Recently, Maccone and Pati have given two stronger uncertainty relations\nbased on the sum of variances and one of them is nontrivial when the quantum\nstate is not an eigenstate of the sum of the observables. We derive a family of\nweighted uncertainty relations to provide an optimal lower bound for all\nsituations and remove the restriction on the quantum state. Generalization to\nmulti-observable cases is also given and an optimal lower bound for the\nweighted sum of the variances is obtained in general quantum situation.\n", "  The structure of $^{70}$Ge has been studied through in-beam gamma ray\nspectroscopy. A new band structure is identified that leads to forking of the\nground-state band into two excited bands. Band structures have been\ninvestigated using the microscopic triaxial projected shell model approach. The\nobserved forking is demonstrated to result from almost simultaneous band\ncrossing of the two neutron aligned and the \\gamma-band built on this\ntwo-quasiparticle configuration with the ground-state band.\n", "  We studied the number of constituent quark scaling (NCQ) behaviour of\nelliptic flow ($v_{2}$) under the framework of A Multi-Phase Transport model\n(AMPT) at both top-RHIC and LHC energies. The NCQ-scaling in $v_{2}$ holds at\ntop-RHIC energy with AMPT string melting version, while it breaks in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at LHC energy using the same framework. The breaking of NCQ-scaling\nat LHC energy has been studied by varying the magnitude of parton-parton\nscattering cross-section and lifetime of hadronic cascade as implemented in\nAMPT. We find that the breaking of NCQ scaling in Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =2.76 TeV is independent of the magnitude of parton-parton\ncross-section and the later stage hadronic interactions. Further we observed\nthat scaling holds in a small collision system like Si+Si at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n2.76 TeV. We discussed that the breaking of NCQ scaling is possibly due to high\nphase-space density of constituents quarks in Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV.\n", "  Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are bursts of $\\gamma$-rays generated from\nrelativistic jets launched from catastrophic events such as massive star core\ncollapse or binary compact star coalescence. Previous studies suggested that\nGRB emission is erratic, with no noticeable memory in the central engine. Here\nwe report a discovery that similar light curve patterns exist within individual\nbursts for at least some GRBs. Applying the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method,\nwe show that similarity of light curve patterns between pulses of a single\nburst or between the light curves of a GRB and its X-ray flare can be\nidentified. This suggests that the central engine of at least some GRBs carries\n\"memory\" of its activities. We also show that the same technique can identify\nmemory-like emission episodes in the flaring emission in Soft Gamma-Ray\nRepeaters (SGRs), which are believed to be Galactic, highly magnetized neutron\nstars named magnetars. Such a phenomenon challenges the standard black hole\ncentral engine models for GRBs, and suggest a common physical mechanism behind\nGRBs and SGRs, which points towards a magnetar central engine of GRBs.\n", "  The sources SDSS\\,J113126.08-020459.2 and SDSS\\,J110851.04+065901.4 are two\ndouble-peaked [O III] emitting AGN, identified as candidate binary AGNs by\noptical and near infrared (NIR) observations. We observed the two sources with\nhigh resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) using the European\nVLBI Network at 5\\,GHz, reduced VLA observations at three frequencies available\nfor one of the sources, and used archival HST observations.\n  For the source SDSS\\,J113126.08-020459.2, the VLBI observations detected only\none single compact component associated with the eastern NIR nucleus. In\nSDSS\\,J110851.04+065901.4, the VLBI observations did not detect any compact\ncomponents, but the VLA observations allowed us to identify a possible compact\ncore in the region of the north-western optical/NIR nucleus. In this source we\nfind kpc-scale extended radio emission that is spatially coincident to the\nultraviolet continuum and to the extended emission narrow line region. The UV\ncontinuum is significantly obscured since the amount of extended radio emission\nyields a star formation rate of about 110 \\msunyr, which is an order of\nmagnitude larger than implied by the observed ultraviolet emission.\n  Our analysis confirms the presence of only one AGN in the two candidate\nbinary AGNs.\n", "  A microscopic version of the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel (CDCC)\nmethod is used to investigate $^{6}$He scattering on $^{27}$Al, $^{58}$Ni,\n$^{120}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The $^{6}$He\nnucleus is described by an antisymmetric 6-nucleon wave function, defined in\nthe Resonating Group Method. The $^{6}$He continuum is simulated by\nsquare-integrable positive-energy states. The model is based only on well known\nnucleon-target potentials, and is therefore does not depend on any adjustable\nparameter. I show that experimental elastic cross sections are fairly well\nreproduced. The calculation suggests that breakup effects increase for high\ntarget masses. For a light system such as $^{6}$He+$^{27}$Al, breakup effects\nare small, and a single-channel approximation provides fair results. This\nproperty is explained by a very simple model, based on the sharp-cut-off\napproximation for the scattering matrix. I also investigate the $^{6}$He-target\noptical potentials, which confirm that breakup channels are more and more\nimportant when the mass increases. At large distances, polarization effects\nincrease the Coulomb barrier, and provide a long-tail absorption component in\nthe imaginary part of the nucleus-nucleus interaction.\n", "  Aim: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in\npatient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose\nprofile in treatment field overlap regions.\n  Background: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically\nchallenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which\nnecessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric\nmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it\noffers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also\noffering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards\nsmall shifts in patient position during the treatment.\n  Materials and Methods: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made\nfor a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used;\none for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like\ndose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised\nfirst, with dose prescription explicitely enforcing a ramp-like dose profile.\nThe cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the\ndose contribution of the upper spinal fields.\n  Results: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and\ncold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative\nto the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a)\nwidening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across\nthe overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear\nramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose\nprofile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on\nminor positional errors in patient set-up.\n", "  A consistent Hartree-Fock study of the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric\nnuclear matter at finite temperature has been performed using realistic choices\nof the effective, density dependent nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, which\nwere successfully used in different nuclear structure and reaction studies.\nGiven the importance of the nuclear symmetry energy in the neutron star\nformation, EOS's associated with different behaviors of the symmetry energy\nwere used to study hot asymmetric nuclear matter. The slope of the symmetry\nenergy and nucleon effective mass with increasing baryon density was found to\naffect the thermal properties of nuclear matter significantly. Different\ndensity dependent NN interactions were further used to study the EOS of hot\nprotoneutron star (PNS) matter of the $npe\\mu\\nu$ composition in\n$\\beta$-equilibrium. The hydrostatic configurations of PNS in terms of the\nmaximal gravitational mass $M_{\\rm max}$ and radius, central density, pressure\nand temperature at the total entropy per baryon $S/A= 1,2$ and 4 have been\ndetermined in both the neutrino-free and neutrino-trapped scenarios. The\nobtained results show consistently a strong impact of the symmetry energy and\nnucleon effective mass on thermal properties and composition of hot PNS matter.\n$M_{\\rm max}$ values obtained for the (neutrino-free) $\\beta$-stable PNS at\n$S/A=4$ were used to assess time $t_{\\rm BH}$ of the collapse of 40 $M_\\odot$\nprotoneutron progenitor to black hole, based on a correlation between $t_{\\rm\nBH}$ and $M_{\\rm max}$ found from the hydrodynamic simulation by Hempel {\\it et\nal.}.\n", "  We study the ground and excited resonance states of $^{26}$O with a\nthree-body model of $^{24}$O+n+n taking into account the coupling to the\ncontinuum. To this end, we use the new experimental data for the invariant mass\nspectroscopy of the unbound $^{25}$O and $^{26}$O nuclei, and present an update\nof three-body model calculations for the two-neutron decay of the $^{26}$O\nnucleus. With the new model inputs determined with the ground state decay of\n$^{26}$O, we discuss the di-neurtron correlations and a halo nature of this\nnucleus, as well as the structure of the excited states. For the energy of the\n2$^+$ state, we achieve an excellent agreement with the experimental data with\nthis calculation. We show that the 2$^+$ state consists predominantly of the\n$(d_{3/2})^2$ configuration, for which the pairing interaction between the\nvalence neutrons slightly decreases its energy from the unperturbed one. We\nalso discuss the structure of excited 0$^+$ states of the $^{26}$O nucleus. In\nparticular, we show the existence of an excited 0$^+$ state at 3.38 MeV, which\nis mainly composed of the $(f_{7/2})^2$ configuration.\n", "  We present for the first time Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry images of the\nradio galaxy Cygnus A at the frequency of $86$ $\\rm GHz$. Thanks to the high\nspatial resolution of only ${\\sim}200$ Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\\bf S}$), such\nobservations provide an extremely detailed view of the nuclear regions in this\narchetypal object and allow us to derive important constraints for theoretical\nmodels describing the launching of relativistic jets. A pixel-based analysis of\nthe jet outflow, which still appears two-sided on the scales probed, was\nperformed. By fitting Gaussian functions to the transverse intensity profiles,\nwe could determine the jet width in the nuclear region. The base of the jets\nappears wide. The minimum measured transverse width of ${\\sim} (227\\pm98)$\n$R_{\\bf S}$ is significantly larger than the radius of the Innermost Stable\nCircular Orbit, suggesting that the outer accretion disk is contributing to the\njet launching. The existence of a faster and Doppler de-boosted inner section,\npowered either from the rotation of the inner regions of the accretion disk or\nby the spinning black hole, is suggested by the kinematic properties and by the\nobserved limb brightening of the flow.\n", "  Popular models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) involve the gravitational collapse\nof neutron star progenitors to black holes. It has been proposed that the\nshedding of the strong neutron star magnetic field ($B$) during the collapse is\nthe power source for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized\nthe simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the\nmagnetic flux is magnetic \"hair\" that must be shed before final collapse. But,\nneutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr\nNewman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon.\nIn this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of\nthe electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black\nhole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will not operate due to\npair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we find that for a neutron\nstar with $B = 10^{11} - 10^{13}$ G and a long rotation period, $>1$ s this is\nnot a concern. We also discuss the observational evidence supporting the\nplausibility of magnetic flux shedding models of FRBs that are spawned from\nrapidly rotating progenitors.\n", "  We discovered two transient events in the Kepler field with light curves that\nstrongly suggest they are type II-P supernovae. Using the fast cadence of the\nKepler observations we precisely estimate the rise time to maximum for KSN2011a\nand KSN2011d as 10.5$\\pm 0.4$ and 13.3$\\pm 0.4$ rest-frame days respectively.\nBased on fits to idealized analytic models, we find the progenitor radius of\nKSN2011a (280$\\pm 20$ R$_\\odot$) to be significantly smaller than that for\nKSN2011d (490$\\pm 20$ R$_\\odot$) but both have similar explosion energies of\n2.0$\\pm 0.3\\times 10^{51}$ erg.\n  The rising light curve of KSN2011d is an excellent match to that predicted by\nsimple models of exploding red supergiants (RSG). However, the early rise of\nKSN2011a is faster than the models predict possibly due to the supernova\nshockwave moving into pre-existing wind or mass-loss from the RSG. A mass loss\nrate of $10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ from the RSG can explain the fast rise\nwithout impacting the optical flux at maximum light or the shape of the\npost-maximum light curve.\n  No shock breakout emission is seen in KSN2011a, but this is likely due to the\ncircumstellar interaction suspected in the fast rising light curve. The early\nlight curve of KSN2011d does show excess emission consistent with model\npredictions of a shock breakout. This is the first optical detection of a shock\nbreakout from a type II-P supernova.\n", "  We present the results of two 2.3 micron near-infrared radial velocity\nsurveys to detect exoplanets around 36 nearby and young M dwarfs. We use the\nCSHELL spectrograph (R ~46,000) at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility,\ncombined with an isotopic methane absorption gas cell for common optical path\nrelative wavelength calibration. We have developed a sophisticated RV forward\nmodeling code that accounts for fringing and other instrumental artifacts\npresent in the spectra. With a spectral grasp of only 5 nm, we are able to\nreach long-term radial velocity dispersions of ~20-30 m/s on our survey\ntargets.\n", "  The HST Frontier Fields cluster MACS J1149.6+2223 is one of the most complex\nmerging clusters, believed to consist of four dark matter halos. We present\nresults from deep (365 ks) Chandra observations of the cluster, which reveal\nthe most distant cold front (z=0.544) discovered to date. In the cluster\noutskirts, we also detect hints of a surface brightness edge that could be the\nbow shock preceding the cold front. The substructure analysis of the cluster\nidentified several components with large relative radial velocities, thus\nindicating that at least some collisions occur almost along the line of sight.\nThe inclination of the mergers with respect to the plane of the sky poses\nsignificant observational challenges at X-ray wavelengths. MACS J1149.6+2223\npossibly hosts a steep-spectrum radio halo. If the steepness of the radio halo\nis confirmed, then the radio spectrum, combined with the relatively regular ICM\nmorphology, could indicate that MACS J1149.6+2223 is an old merging cluster.\n", "  We explore the possibility of observing Population III (Pop~III) stars, born\nof the primordial gas.\n  Pop~III stars with masses below $0.8 M_\\odot$ should survive to date though\nare not observed yet, but the existence of stars with low metallicity as\n[Fe/H]$ < -5$ in the Milky Way halo suggests the surface pollution of Pop~III\nstars with accreted metals from the interstellar gas after birth. In this\npaper, we investigate the runaway of Pop~III stars from their host mini-halos,\nconsidering the ejection of secondary members from binary systems when their\nmassive primaries explode as supernovae.\n  These stars save them from the surface pollution.\n  By computing the star formation and chemical evolution along with the\nhierarchical structure formation based on the extended Press--Schechter merger\ntrees, we demonstrate that several hundreds to tens of thousands of low-mass\nPop~III stars escape from the building blocks of the Milky Way.\n  The second and later generations of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are also\nescaped from the mini-halos.\n  We discuss the spatial distributions of these escaped stars by evaluating the\ndistances between the mini-halos in the branches of merger trees under the\nspherical collapse model of dark matter halos.\n  It is demonstrated that the escaped stars distribute beyond the stellar halo\nwith a density profile close to the dark matter halo, while the Pop~III stars\nare slightly more centrally concentrated .\n  Some escaped stars leave the Milky Way and spread into the intergalactic\nspace.\n  Based on the results, we discuss the feasibility of observing the Pop~III\nstars with the pristine surface abundance.\n", "  Block copolymer, a synthesized polymer material, has found many applications\nin industry. It is consisting of multiple sequences of monomer alternating in\nseries with different monomer blocks. The combination of different polymers\nendows the polymer material with rich properties, which are the key to their\nimportant applications. In this paper, we model the copolymers with\nLandau-Brazovskii model with additional constraints reflecting physical\nstructures, which is in the form of a second order variational problem.\nCritical points of the functional are interpreted as states of polymers. By\nreducing to handy situations, we find a nontrivial periodic minimal solution.\nMoreover, the proof is kept as simple and self-contained as possible in our\nspecific case.\n", "  With Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations, we have discovered a diverse\nassembly of steep spectrum emission that is apparently associated with the\nintra cluster medium (ICM) of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2034. Such a\nrich variety of complex emission associated with the ICM has been observed in\nfew other clusters. This not only indicates that Abell 2034 is a more\ninteresting and complex system than previously thought but it also demonstrates\nthe importance of sensitive and high-resolution, low-frequency observations.\nThese observations can reveal emission from relativistic particles which have\nbeen accelerated to sufficient energy to produce observable emission or have\nhad their high energy maintained by mechanisms in the ICM. The most prominent\nfeature in our maps is a bright bulb of emission connected to two steep\nspectrum filamentary structures, the longest of which extends perpendicular to\nthe merger axis for 0.5Mpc across the south of the cluster. The origin of these\nobjects is unclear, with no shock detected in the X-ray images and no obvious\nconnection with cluster galaxies or AGNs. We also find that the X-ray bright\nregion of the cluster coincides with a giant radio halo with an irregular\nmorphology and a very steep spectrum. In addition, the cluster hosts up to\nthree possible radio relics, which are misaligned with the cluster X-ray\nemission. Finally, we have identified multiple regions of emission with a very\nsteep spectral index that seem to be associated with either tailed radio\ngalaxies or a shock.\n", "  We compare the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) of simulations and\nobservations of galaxies ranging from dwarfs to spirals, using various measures\nof rotational velocity Vrot. We explore the BTFR when measuring Vrot at the\nflat part of the rotation curve, Vflat, at the extent of HI gas, Vlast, and\nusing 20% (W20) and 50% (W50) of the width of HI line profiles. We also compare\nwith the maximum circular velocity of the parent halo, Vmax, within dark matter\nonly simulations. The different BTFRs increasingly diverge as galaxy mass\ndecreases. Using Vlast one obtains a power law over four orders of magnitude in\nbaryonic mass, with slope similar to the observed BTFR. Measuring Vflat gives\nsimilar results as Vlast when galaxies with rising rotation curves are\nexcluded. However, higher rotation velocities would be found for low mass\ngalaxies if the cold gas extended far enough for Vrot to reach a maximum. W20\ngives a similar slope as Vlast but with slightly lower values of Vrot for low\nmass galaxies, although this may depend on the extent of the gas in your galaxy\nsample. W50 bends away from these other relations toward low velocities at low\nmasses. By contrast, Vmax bends toward high velocities for low mass galaxies,\nas cold gas does not extend out to the radius at which halos reach Vmax. Our\nstudy highlights the need for careful comparisons between observations and\nmodels: one needs to be consistent about the particular method of measuring\nVrot, and precise about the radius at which velocities are measured.\n", "  The stellar debris structures that have been discovered around the Milky Way\nand other galaxies are thought to be formed from the disruption of satellite\nstellar systems --- dwarf galaxies or globular clusters --- by galactic tidal\nfields. The total stellar mass in these structures is typically tiny compared\nto the galaxy around which they are found, and it is hence easy to dismiss them\nas inconsequential. However, they are remarkably useful as probes of a galaxy's\nhistory (as described in this chapter) and mass distribution (covered in a\ncompanion chapter in this volume). This power is actually a consequence of\ntheir apparent insignificance: their low contribution to the overall mass makes\nthe physics that describes them both elegant and simple and this means that\ntheir observed properties are relatively easy to understand and interpret.\n", "  Tidal debris streams from galaxy satellites can provide insight into the dark\nmatter distribution in halos. This is because we have more information about\nstars in a debris structure than about a purely random population of stars: we\nknow that in the past they were all bound to the same dwarf galaxy; and we know\nthat they form a dynamically cold population moving on similar orbits. They\nalso probe a different region of the matter distribution in a galaxy than many\nother methods of mass determination, as their orbits take them far beyond the\ntypical extent of those for the bulk of stars. Although conclusive results from\nthis information have yet to be obtained, significant progress has been made in\ndeveloping the methodologies for determining both the global mass distribution\nof the Milky Way's dark matter halo and the amount of dark matter substructure\nwithin it. Methods for measuring the halo shape are divided into \"predictive\nmethods,\" which predict the tidal debris properties from the progenitor\nsatellite's mass and orbit, given an assumed parent galaxy mass distribution;\nand \"fundamental methods,\" which exploit properties fundamental to the nature\nof tidal debris as global potential constraints. Methods for quantifying the\nprevalence of dark matter subhalos within halos through the analysis of the\ngaps left in tidal streams after these substructures pass through them are\nreviewed.\n", "  Oscillatory double-diffusive convection in horizontal cavity with Soret and\nDufour effects is investigated numerically based on SIMPLE algorithm with QUICK\nscheme in non-uniform staggered grid system. The results show that\ndouble-diffusive convection develops from steady-state convection-dominated,\nperiodic oscillatory, quasi-periodic oscillatory to chaotic flow, and finally\nreturn to periodic oscillation as buoyancy ratio increases. Moreover,\nfundamental frequency and fluctuation amplitude increase with buoyancy ratio.\nAs Rayleigh number increases, transition trendy of oscillatory convection is\nsimilar to that of buoyancy ratio. But the return of periodic oscillation from\nchaos is not obtained as Rayleigh number increases. As aspect ratio decreases,\nthe oscillatory convection evolves from periodic into steady-state. In\naddition, fundamental frequency increases at first and then decreases while\nfluctuation amplitude decreases with aspect ratio.\n", "  A very weakly coupled linear oscillator is proposed as a detector for\nobserving time-irreversible characteristics of a quantum system, and it is used\nto measure the lifetime during which a classically chaotic quantum system shows\ndecay of correlation. Except for a particular case where the lifetime agrees\nwith the conventional Heisenberg time, which is proportional to the Hilbert\nspace dimension $N$, it is in general much longer: the lifetime increases in\nproportion to the product of $N$ and the number of superposed eigenstates, and\nis proportional to $N^2$ in the case of full superposition.\n", "  The study of microwave and radiofrequency multi-photon transitions in\ncontinuous wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy is extended to a Rabi resonance\ncondition, when the radio frequency of the magnetic-field modulation matches\nthe Rabi frequency of a spin system in the microwave field. Using the\nnon-secular perturbation theory based on the Bogoliubov averaging method, the\nanalytical description of the response of the spin system is derived for all\nmodulation frequency harmonics. When the modulation frequency exceeds the EPR\nlinewidth, multi-photon transitions result in sidebands in absorption EPR\nspectra measured with phase-sensitive detection at any harmonic. The saturation\nof different-order multi-photon transitions is shown to be significantly\ndifferent and to be sensitive to the Rabi resonance. The noticeable frequency\nshifts of sidebands are found to be the signatures of this resonance. The\ninversion of two-photon lines in some spectral intervals of the out-of-phase\nfirst-harmonic signal is predicted under passage through the Rabi resonance.\nThe inversion indicates the transition from absorption to stimulated emission\nor vice versa, depending on the sideband. The manifestation of the primary and\nsecondary Rabi resonance is also demonstrated in time-resolved steady-state EPR\nsignals formed by all harmonics of the modulation frequency. Our results\nprovide a theoretical framework for future developments in multi-photon CW EPR\nspectroscopy, which can be useful for samples with long spin relaxation times\nand extremely narrow EPR lines\n", "  Two types of average neutron-proton interaction formulas are compared: In the\nfirst type, neutron-proton interactions for even-even and odd-$A$ nuclei\nextracted from experimental binding energies show a smooth behavior as a\nfunction of mass number $A$ and are dominated by the contribution from the\nsymmetry energy. Whereas in the second type large systematic staggering is seen\nbetween even-$A$ and odd-$A$ nuclei. This deviation is understood in term of\nthe additional neutron-proton interaction in odd-odd nuclei relative to the\nneighboring even-even and odd-$A$ systems. We explore three possible ways to\nextract this additional interaction from the binding energy difference of\nneighboring nuclei. The extracted interactions are positive in nearly all cases\nand show weak dependence on the mass number. The empirical interactions are\nalso compared with theoretical values extracted from recent nuclear mass models\nwhere large unexpected fluctuations are seen in certain nuclei. The\nreproduction of the residual neutron-proton interaction and the correction of\nthose irregular fluctuations can be a good criterion for the refinement of\nthose mass models.\n", "  We report theoretical and experimental discovery of Lorentz-violating Weyl\nfermion semimetal type-II state in the LaAlGe class of materials. Previously\ntype-II Weyl state was predicted in WTe2 materials which remains unrealized in\nsurface experiments. We show theoretically and experimentally that LaAlGe class\nof materials are the robust platforms for the study of type-II Weyl physics.\n", "  The LaSilla/QUEST Variability Survey (LSQ) and the Carnegie Supernova Project\n(CSP II) are collaborating to discover and obtain photometric light curves for\na large sample of low redshift (z < 0.1) Type Ia supernovae. The supernovae are\ndiscovered in the LSQ survey using the 1 m ESO Schmidt telescope at the La\nSilla Observatory with the 10 square degree QUEST camera. The follow-up\nphotometric observations are carried out using the 1 m Swope telescope and the\n2.5 m du Pont telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory. This paper describes\nthe survey, discusses the methods of analyzing the data and presents the light\ncurves for the first 31 Type Ia supernovae obtained in the survey. The SALT 2.4\nsupernova light curve fitter was used to analyze the photometric data, and the\nHubble diagram for this first sample is presented. The measurement errors for\nthese supernovae averaged 4%, and their intrinsic spread was 14%.\n", "  Maximizing the speed and precision of communication while minimizing power\ndissipation is a fundamental engineering design goal. Also, biological systems\nachieve remarkable speed, precision and power efficiency using poorly\nunderstood physical design principles. Powerful theories like information\ntheory and thermodynamics do not provide general limits on power, precision and\nspeed. Here we go beyond these classical theories to prove that the product of\nprecision and speed is universally bounded by power dissipation in any physical\ncommunication channel whose dynamics is faster than that of the signal.\nMoreover, our derivation involves a novel connection between friction and\ninformation geometry. These results may yield insight into both the engineering\ndesign of communication devices and the structure and function of biological\nsignaling systems.\n", "  We prove the existence of the operator product expansion (OPE) in Euclidean\nYang-Mills theories as a short-distance expansion, to all orders in\nperturbation theory. We furthermore show that the Ward identities of the\nunderlying gauge theory are reflected in the OPE; especially, the OPE of an\narbitrary number of gauge-invariant composite operators only involves\ngauge-invariant composite operators. Moreover, we derive recursion relations\nwhich allow to construct the OPE coefficients, the quantum BRST differential\nand the quantum antibracket order by order in perturbation theory, starting\nfrom the known free-theory objects. These relations are completely finite from\nthe start, and do not need any further renormalisation as is usually the case\nin other approaches. Our results underline the importance of the OPE as a\ngeneral structure underlying quantum field theories. The proofs are obtained\nwithin the framework of the Wilson-Wegner-Polchinski-Wetterich renormalisation\ngroup flow equations, and generalise similar results recently obtained for\nscalar field theories [J. Holland and S. Hollands, Commun. Math. Phys. 336\n(2015) 1555; J. Holland and S. Hollands, J. Math. Phys. 56 (2015) 122303].\nCombining their results with our recursion formula, we also obtain\nassociativity of the OPE coefficients.\n", "  Electrospinning technologies for the realization of active polymeric\nnanomaterials can be easily up-scaled, opening perspectives to industrial\nexploitation, and due to their versatility they can be employed to finely\ntailor the size, morphology and macroscopic assembly of fibers as well as their\nfunctional properties. Light-emitting or other active polymer nanofibers, made\nof conjugated polymers or of blends embedding chromophores or other functional\ndopants, are suitable for various applications in advanced photonics and\nsensing technologies. In particular, their almost one-dimensional geometry and\nfinely tunable composition make them interesting materials for developing novel\nlasing devices. However, electrospinning techniques rely on a large variety of\nparameters and possible experimental geometries, and they need to be carefully\noptimized in order to obtain suitable topographical and photonic properties in\nthe resulting nanostructures. Targeted features include smooth and uniform\nfiber surface, dimensional control, as well as filament alignment, enhanced\nlight emission, and stimulated emission. We here present various optimization\nstrategies for electrospinning methods which have been implemented and\ndeveloped by us for the realization of lasing architectures based on polymer\nnanofibers. The geometry of the resulting nanowires leads to peculiar\nlight-scattering from spun filaments, and to controllable lasing\ncharacteristics.\n", "  We present a study on the quantum transport properties of chemically\nfunctionalized metallic double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) with lengths\nreaching the micrometer scale. First-principles calculations evidence that, for\ncoaxial tubes separated by the typical graphitic van der Waals-bond distance,\nthe chemical modification of the outer wall with sp$^3$-type defects affects\nthe electronic structure of both the outer and the inner tube, which reduces\nsignificantly the charge transport capability of the DWNT. For larger spacing\nbetween sidewalls, the conductivity of the outer wall decreases with increasing\nfunctional group coverage density while charge transport in the inner tube is\nequivalent to that of a pristine nanotube. Additionally, chemical attachment of\nCCl$_2$ onto the outer DWNT sidewall barely affect the conjugated $\\pi$-network\nof the double-wall and charge transport remains in the quasi-ballistic regime.\nThese results indicate an efficient route for tailoring electronic transport in\nDWNTs provided inner shell geometry and functional groups are properly chosen.\n", "  A high-precision test of the Glauber formula for the amplitude of\nnucleon-deuteron scattering is performed. Nucleon-nucleon amplitudes used in\nthe calculations depend on the spins of interacting particles, phase shifts,\nand mixing parameters. These amplitudes were derived by using the Nijmegen\npotentials. The differential cross sections for nucleon-deuteron scattering\nwere calculated for the projectile-nucleon energies of 65, 95, 135, 150, 190,\nand 250~MeV, and the results of these calculations were compared with\nexperimental data.\n", "  The Haber-Bosch process is the main industrial method for producing ammonia\nfrom diatomic nitrogen and hydrogen. Very demanding energetically, it uses an\niron catalyst, and requires high temperature and pressure. Any improvement of\nthe Haber process will have an extreme scientific and economic impact. We\nreport a significant increase of ammonia production using hydroxylated\ngraphene. Exploiting the polarity difference between N2/H2 and NH3, as well as\nthe universal proton acceptor behavior of NH3, we demonstrate a strong shift of\nthe equilibrium of the Haber-Bosch process towards ammonia. Hydroxylated\ngraphene provides the polar environment favoring the forward reaction, and\nremain stable under the investigated thermodynamic conditions. Ca. 50 kJ mol-1\nenthalpy gain and ca. 60-70 kJ mol-1 free energy gain are achieved at 298-1300\nK and 1-1000 bar, strongly shifting the reaction equilibrium towards the\nproduct. A clear microscopic interpretation of the observed phenomenon is given\nusing electronic structure calculations and real-time reactive simulations. The\ndemonstrated principle can be applied with many polar groups functionalizing a\nsubstrate with a high surface area, provided that the system is chemically\ninert to H2, N2 and NH3. The modified Haber-Bosch process is of significant\nimportance to the chemical industry, since it provides a substantial increase\nof the reaction yield while decreasing the temperature and pressure, thereby,\nreducing the cost.\n", "  We present a new, single step approach for generating a hexagonal lattice\nwave-field with a gradient local basis structure. We incorporate this by\ncoherently superposing two (or more) hexagonal lattice wave-fields which differ\nin their basis structures. The basis of the resultant lattice wave-field is\nhighly dependent on the relative strengths of constituent wave-fields and a\ndesired spatial modulation of basis structure is thus obtained by controlling\nthe spatial modulation of relative strengths of constituent wave-fields. The\nexperimental realization of gradient lattice is achieved by using a phase only\nspatial light modulator (SLM) in an optical 4f Fourier filter setup where the\nSLM is displayed with numerically calculated gradient phase mask. The presented\nmethod is wavelength independent and is completely scalable making it very\npromising for micro-fabrication of corresponding structures.\n", "  We study the magnetic field vs temperature ($H$--$T$) and pressure vs\ntemperature ($P$--$T$) phase diagram of the $T_c \\approx 5.5$~K superconducting\nphase in Pd$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_3$ ($x \\approx 1$) using electrical resistivity versus\ntemperature measurements at various applied magnetic fields ($H$) and magnetic\nsusceptibility versus temperature measurements at various applied magnetic\nfields ($H$) and pressure ($P$). The $H$--$T$ phase diagram has an initial\nupward curvature as observed in some unconventional superconductors. The\ncritical field extrapolated to $T = 0$~K is $H_c (0) \\approx 6$--$10$~kOe. The\n$T_c$ is suppressed approximately linearly with pressure at a rate $dT_c/dP\n\\approx -0.28$~K/GPa.\n", "  Key to realising quantum computers is minimising the resources required to\nbuild logic gates into useful processing circuits. While the salient features\nof a quantum computer have been shown in proof-of-principle experiments,\ndifficulties in scaling quantum systems have made more complex operations\nintractable. This is exemplified in the classical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP)\ngate for which, despite theoretical proposals, no quantum analogue has been\nrealised. By adding control to the SWAP unitary, we use photonic qubit logic to\ndemonstrate the first quantum Fredkin gate, which promises many applications in\nquantum information and measurement. We implement example algorithms and\ngenerate the highest-fidelity three-photon GHZ states to-date. The technique we\nuse allows one to add a control operation to a black-box unitary, something\nimpossible in the standard circuit model. Our experiment represents the first\nuse of this technique to control a two-qubit operation and paves the way for\nlarger controlled circuits to be realised efficiently.\n", "  Near transform-limited single photon sources are required for perfect photon\nindistinguishability in quantum networks. Having such sources in nanodiamonds\nis particularly important since it can enable engineering hybrid quantum\nphotonic systems. In this letter, we report the generation of optically stable,\nnearly transform-limited single silicon vacancy emitters in nanodiamonds. Lines\nas narrow as 325 MHz are reported, which is comparable to the lifetime limited\nlinewidth. Moreover, the emitters exhibit minimal spectrum diffusion and\nabsolute photostability, even if pumped well above saturation. Our results\nsuggest that nanodiamonds can host color centers with supreme properties\nsuitable for hybrid photonic devices and quantum information.\n", "  In this paper, we have proposed a plotting method based on the \" natural\nplotting rule \" (NPR) which can be used to distinguish different cosmological\nscenarios more efficiently and obtain more useful information. By using the\nNPR, we have avoided the blindness to use different diagnostics when\ndiscovering that some scenarios can be hardly differentiated from each other,\nand develop a logical line to adopt different diagnostics. As a concrete\ninstance, we take this method based on the NPR to distinguish several\nCardassian scenarios from the base cosmology scenario, and one from the other.\nWe place constraints on three Cardassian cosmological scenarios and their flat\nversions by utilizing the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic\noscillations (BAO), cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, observational\nHubble parameter (OHD) data-sets as well as the single data point from the\nnewest event GW150914, and discover that our results are more stringent than\nprevious results for constraining the cosmological parameters of the Cardassian\nscenarios. We find that the flat original Cardassian (FOC) and original\nCardassian (OC) scenarios can only be distinguished in the plane of\n$\\{\\Omega_m,S_3^{(1)}\\}$ at the present epoch, however, if applying the NPR to\nplot hierarchically for these Cardassian scenarios in the plane of\n$\\{S_3^{(1)},S_4^{(1)}\\}$, we can obtain more detailed information and\ndistinguish the two scenarios better than before. More importantly, from the\nplanes of $\\{S_4,S_4^{(2)}\\}$, $\\{S_5^{(1)},S_5^{(2)}\\}$,\n$\\{S_3^{(2)},S_4^{(2)}\\}$, $\\{\\Omega_m,S_3^{(1)}\\}$,$\\{z,\\omega\\}$\n$\\{\\epsilon(z),S_3^{(1)}\\}$ and $\\{z,Om\\}$, we dsicover that the flat modified\npolytropic Cardassian (FMPC) scenario can be directly removed from the possible\ncandidates of dark energy phenomenon, since its evolutional behavior deviates\nfrom the base cosmology scenario too much.\n", "  Insolation of the Martian soil leads to a sub-surface overpressure due to\nthermal creep gas flow. This could support particle entrainment into the\natmosphere. Short time shadowing e.g. by the traverse of a larger dust devil\nwould enhance this effect. We find in microgravity experiments that mass\nejection rates are increased by a factor of 10 for several seconds if a light\nsource of 12.6 kW/$\\rm m^2$ is turned off. Scaled to Mars this implies that\nself-shadowing of a partially opaque dust devil might lead to a strongly\namplified flux of lifted material. We therefore suggest that self-shadowing\nmight be a mechanism on Mars to increase the total dust loading of a dust devil\nand keep it self-sustained.\n", "  Magnetization and magnetic microstructure of top soft magnetic layer (Fe),\nwhich is exchange spring coupled to bottom hard magnetic layer ($L1_0$ FePt) is\nstudied using high resolution Kerr microscopy. When the sample (FePt/Fe) is at\nremanent condition of hard magnetic layer, considerable shifting of Fe layer\nhysteresis loop from centre i.e., exchange bias phenomena is observed. It is\nobserved that one can tune the magnitude of exchange bias shift by reaching the\nremanent state from different saturating fields ($H_{SAT}$) and also by varying\nthe angle between measuring field and $H_{SAT}$. The M-H loops and domain\nimages of top soft Fe layer demonstrates unambiguously that soft magnetic layer\nat remanent state in such exchange coupled system is having unidirectional\nanisotropy. An analogy is drawn and the observations are explained in terms of\nthe mostly accepted models of exchange bias phenomena exhibited by bilayers\nconsisting of ferromagnetic(FM) and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) layers, when the\nAFM layer is field cooled across $N\\acute{e}el$ transition temperature.\n", "  Present bias, the tendency to weigh costs and benefits incurred in the\npresent too heavily, is one of the most widespread human behavioral biases. It\nhas also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics\nliterature. While the simplest models assume that the agents are naive,\nreasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is\nconsiderable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated\nwith respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will\nbe present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action\nto reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are\ninstances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life.\n  Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that\nallows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a\nsophisticated agent might face. This has made it correspondingly difficult to\nmake comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the\nnotion of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent\nwork for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms -\nsophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that\nwasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem.\n  In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results\npossible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal\nplan. Second, the flexibility of our formalism makes it possible to identify\nnew phenomena that had not been seen in prior literature: these include a\nsurprising non-monotonic property in the use of rewards to motivate\nsophisticated agents and a framework for reasoning about commitment devices.\n", "  Percolation of gold films of ~15 nm thickness was controlled to achieve the\nlargest openings during Au deposition. Gold was evaporated on 300-nm-thick\nfilms of nanostructured porous and columnar SiO2, TiO2 and MgF2 which were\ndeposited by controlling the angle, rotation speed during film formation and\nambient pressure. The gold films were tested for SERS performance using\nthiophenol reporter molecules which form a stable self-assembled monolayer on\ngold. The phase retardation of these SERS substrates was up to 5% for\nwavelengths in the visible spectral range, as measured by Stokes polarimetry.\nThe SERS intensity on gold percolation films can reach 10^3 counts/(mW.s) for\ntight focusing in air, while back-side excitation through the substrate has\nshown the presence of an additional SERS enhancement via the Fresnel near-field\nmechanism.\n", "  MOL-D database is a collection of cross-sections and rate coefficients for\nspecific collisional processes and a web service within the Serbian Virtual\nObservatory (SerVO) and the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Center (VAMDC).\nThis database contains photo-dissociation cross-sections for the individual\nro-vibrational states of the diatomic molecular ions and rate coefficients for\nthe atom-Rydberg atom chemi-ionization and inverse electron-ion-atom\nchemi-recombination processes. At the moment it contains data for\nphotodissociation cross-sections of hydrogen H2+ and helium He2+ molecular ions\nand the corresponding averaged thermal photodissociation cross-sections. The\nro-vibrational energy states and the corresponding dipole matrix elements are\nprovided as well. Hydrogen and helium molecular ion data are important for\ncalculation of solar and stellar atmosphere models and for radiative transport,\nas well as for kinetics of other astrophysical and laboratory plasma (i.e.\nearly Universe).\n", "  We investigate electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of recent\nsynthetic half-Heusler $\\mathrm{ZrNiPb}$ by using generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) and GGA plus spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SOC). Calculated\nresults show that $\\mathrm{ZrNiPb}$ is a indirect-gap semiconductor. Within the\nconstant scattering time approximation, semi-classic transport coefficients are\nperformed through solving Boltzmann transport equations. It is found that the\nSOC has more obvious influence on power factor in p-type doping than in n-type\ndoping, leading to a detrimental effect in p-type doping. These can be\nexplained by considering the SOC influences on the valence bands and conduction\nbands near the Fermi level. The lattice thermal conductivity as a function of\ntemperature is calculated, and the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity\nis 14.5 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ at room temperature. By comparing the\nexperimental transport coefficients with calculated ones, the scattering time\nis attained for 0.333 $\\times$ $10^{-14}$ s. Finally, the thermoelectric figure\nof merit $ZT$ can be attained, and the $ZT$ value can be as high as 0.30 at\nhigh temperature by choosing appropriate doping level. It is possible to reduce\nlattice thermal conductivity by point defects and boundaries, and make\nhalf-Heusler $\\mathrm{ZrNiPb}$ become potential candidate for efficient\nthermoelectricity.\n", "  The fundamental role of hydrophobic interactions in nature and technology has\nmotivated decades long research aimed at measuring the distance-dependent\nhydrophobic force and identifying its origin. This quest has nevertheless\nproved more elusive than anticipated and the nature of the interaction at\ndistances shorter than 2-3 nanometers, or even its sign, have never been\nconclusively determined. Employing an ultra-high resolution\nfrequency-modulation atomic force microscope (FM-AFM) we succeeded in measuring\nthe interaction at all distances and discovered that the commonly observed\nattraction at 3-10 nanometer distances turns into pronounced repulsion below\n0.3-3 nanometers, depending on the hydrophobicity of the AFM tip and the\nsurface. This generic short-range repulsion disproves the prevailing dogma that\nhydrophobic interactions are attractive at all distances, hence bearing on\npractically all biological and technological hydrophobic phenomena. The\nshort-range repulsion, as well as the mid-range attraction, are traced by\nexperiment and theory to the prevalent air accumulation near hydrophobic\nsurfaces.\n", "  We address the question of quantifying eavesdropper's information gain in an\nindividual attack on systems of quantum key distribution. It is connected with\nthe concept of conclusive eavesdropping introduced by Brandt. Using the BB84\nprotocol, we examine the problem of estimating a performance of conclusive\nentangling probe. The question of interest depends on the choice of a\nquantitative measure of eavesdropper's information about the error-free sifted\nbits. The Fuchs--Peres--Brandt probe realizes a very powerful individual attack\non the BB84 scheme. In the usual formulation, Eve utilizes the Helstrom scheme\nin distinguishing between the two output probe states. In conclusive\neavesdropping, the unambiguous discrimination is used. Comparing these two\nversions allows to demonstrate serious distinctions between widely used\nquantifiers of mutual information. In particular, the so-called R\\'{e}nyi\nmutual information does not seem to be a completely legitimate measure of an\namount of mutual information. It is brightly emphasized with the example of\nconclusive eavesdropping.\n", "  An infinite system of point particles performing random jumps in\n$\\mathds{R}^d$ with repulsion is studied. The states of the system are\nprobability measures on the space of particle's configurations. The result of\nthe paper is the construction of the global in time evolution of states with\nthe help of the corresponding correlation functions. It is proved that for each\ninitial sub-Poissonian state $\\mu_0$, the constructed evolution $\\mu_0 \\mapsto\n\\mu_t$ preserves this property. That is, $\\mu_t$ is sub-Poissonian for all\n$t>0$.\n", "  The coercive field of permanent magnets decreases with increasing grain size.\nThe grain size dependence of coercivity is explained by a size dependent\ndemagnetizing factor. In Dy free Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B magnets the size dependent\ndemagnetizing factor ranges from 0.2 for a grain size of 55 nm to 1.22 for a\ngrain size of 8300 nm. The comparison of experimental data with micromagnetic\nsimulations suggests that the grain size dependence of the coercive field in\nhard magnets is due to the non-uniform magnetostatic field in polyhedral\ngrains.\n", "  The existence of one-phonon and possible two-phonon transverse wobbling bands\nis proposed for the first time in two even-even nuclei, $^{134}$Ce and\n$^{136}$Nd. The predominant $E2$ character of the $\\Delta I = 1$ transitions\nconnecting the one-phonon wobbling band in $^{134}$Ce to the two-quasiparticle\nyrast band supports the wobbling interpretation. The extracted wobbling\nfrequencies decrease with increasing spin, indicating the transverse character\nof the wobbling motion, with the angular momenta of the two quasiparticles\naligned perpendicular to the axis of collective rotation. A candidate for\ntwo-phonon wobbling motion is also proposed in $^{136}$Nd. The wobbling\nfrequencies calculated in the harmonic frozen approximation are in good\nagreement with the experimental ones for both the$^{134}$Ce and $^{136}$Nd\nnuclei.\n", "  The coercive field and angular dependence of the coercive field of\nsingle-grain Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B permanent magnets are computed using finite\nelement micromagnetics. It is shown that the thickness of surface defects plays\na critical role in determining the reversal process. For small defect\nthicknesses reversal is heavily driven by nucleation, whereas with increasing\ndefect thickness domain wall de-pinning becomes more important. This change\nresults in an observable shift between two well-known behavioral models.\n  A similar trend is observed in experimental measurements of bulk samples,\nwhere a Nd-Cu infiltration process has been used to enhance coercivity by\nmodifying the grain boundaries. When account is taken of the imperfect grain\nalignment of real magnets, the single-grain computed results appears to closely\nmatch experimental behaviour.\n", "  Recent years saw an increased interest in modeling and understanding the\nmechanisms of opinion and innovation spread through human networks. Using\nanalysis of real-world social data, researchers are able to gain a better\nunderstanding of the dynamics of social networks and subsequently model the\nchanges in such networks over time. We developed a social network model that\nboth utilizes an agent-based approach with a dynamic update of opinions and\nconnections between agents and reflects opinion propagation and structural\nchanges over time as observed in real-world data. We validate the model using\ndata from the Social Evolution dataset of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab describing\nchanges in friendships and health self-perception in a targeted student\npopulation over a nine-month period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach by predicting changes in both opinion spread and connectivity of the\nnetwork. We also use the model to evaluate how the network parameters, such as\nthe level of `openness' and willingness to incorporate opinions of neighboring\nagents, affect the outcome. The model not only provides insight into the\ndynamics of ever changing social networks, but also presents a tool with which\none can investigate opinion propagation strategies for networks of various\nstructures and opinion distributions.\n", "  The product formation channels of ground state carbon atoms, C(3P), reacting\nwith ammonia, NH3, have been investigated using two complementary experiments\nand electronic structure calculations. Reaction products are detected in a gas\nflow tube experiment (330 K, 4 Torr) using tunable VUV photoionization coupled\nwith time of flight mass spectrometry. Temporal profiles of the species formed\nand photoionization spectra are used to identify primary products of the C +\nNH3 reaction. In addition, H-atom formation is monitored by VUV laser induced\nfluorescence from room temperature to 50 K in a supersonic gas flow generated\nby the Laval nozzle technique. Electronic structure calculations are performed\nto derive intermediates, transition states and complexes formed along the\nreaction coordinate. The combination of photoionization and laser induced\nfluorescence experiments supported by theoretical calculations indicate that in\nthe temperature and pressure range investigated, the H + H2CN production\nchannel represents 100% of the product yield for this reaction. Kinetics\nmeasurements of the title reaction down to 50 K and the effect of the new rate\nconstants on interstellar nitrogen hydride abundances using a model of dense\ninterstellar clouds are reported in paper II.\n", "  In the article, we describe a new algebraic approach to the temporal network\nanalysis based on the notion of temporal quantities. We define the semiring for\ncomputing the foremost journey and the traveling semirings for the analysis of\ntemporal networks where the latency is given, the waiting times are arbitrary,\nand some other information on the links are known. We use the operations in the\ntraveling semiring to compute a generalized temporal betweenness centrality of\nthe nodes that corresponds to the importance of the nodes with respect to the\nubiquitous foremost journeys in a temporal network.\n", "  In the recent decades, it became more and more popular for engineers,\nphysicists, and mathematicians alike to put the Maxwell equations into a\ngenerally covariant form. This is particularly useful for understanding the\nfundamental structure of electrodynamics (conservation of electric charge and\nmagnetic flux). Moreover, it is ideally suited for applying it to media with\nlocal (and mainly linear) response behavior. We try to collect the new\nknowledge that grew out of this development. We would like to ask the\nparticipants of EMTS 2016 to inform us of work that we may have overlooked in\nour review.\n", "  We elaborate on a linear time implementation of the Collective Influence (CI)\nalgorithm introduced by Morone, Makse, Nature 524, 65 (2015) to find the\nminimal set of influencers in a network via optimal percolation. We show that\nthe computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes\none-by-one, with N the number of nodes. This is made possible by using an\nappropriate data structure to process the CI values, and by the finite radius l\nof the CI sphere. Furthermore, we introduce a simple extension of CI when l is\ninfinite, the CI propagation (CI_P) algorithm, that considers the global\noptimization of influence via message passing in the whole network and\nidentifies a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI. Remarkably, CI_P\nis able to reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold\nobtained by Bau, Wormald, Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random\nregular graphs, leaving little improvement left for random graphs. We also\nintroduce the Collective Immunization Belief Propagation algorithm (CI_BP), a\nbelief-propagation (BP) variant of CI based on optimal immunization, which has\nthe same performance as CI_P. However, this small augmented performance of the\norder of 1-2 % in the low influencers tail comes at the expense of increasing\nthe computational complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2 log N), rendering both,\nCI_P and CI_BP, prohibitive for finding influencers in modern-day big-data. The\nsame nonlinear running time drawback pertains to a recently introduced\nBP-decimation (BPD) algorithm by Mugisha, Zhou, arXiv:1603.05781. For instance,\nwe show that for big-data social networks of typically 200 million users (eg,\nactive Twitter users sending 500 million tweets per day), CI finds the\ninfluencers in less than 3 hours running on a single CPU, while the BP\nalgorithms (CI_P, CI_BP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish\nthe same task.\n", "  We observe magnetic domain structures of MgO/CoFeB with a perpendicular\nmagnetic easy axis under an electric field. The domain structure shows a maze\npattern with electric-field dependent isotropic period. We find that the\nelectric-field modulation of the period is explained by considering the\nelectric-field modulation of the exchange stiffness constant in addition to the\nknown magnetic anisotropy modulation.\n", "  Contextuality is one of the fundamental deviations of quantum mechanics from\nclassical physics. The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem shows that non-contextual\nclassical physics with hidden variables is inconsistent with the predictions of\nquantum mechanics. Parity proof is one of the many different approaches applied\nto prove KS theorem for quantum system with different dimensionality. This\nmethod of proof requires KS sets that composed of an odd number of bases and an\neven number of projectors. In most of the cases, the number of KS sets produced\nis large and its production is generally aided by computer calculation.\nHowever, manually generation of KS sets are also reported previously for qutrit\nand two-qubit systems. We put forward the first and surprisingly simple method\nto generate manually KS sets, with respect to Mermin pentagram, that can be\nused for the parity proof of KS theorem in a state space of eight-dimensional\nthree-qubit system .\n", "  One prominent structural feature of ionic liquids near surfaces is formation\nof alternating layers of anions and cations. However, how this layering\nresponds to applied potential is poorly understood. We focus on the structure\nof 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate\n(BMPY-FAP) near the surface of a strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) electric\ndouble-layer transistor. Using x-ray reflectivity, we show that at positive\nbias, the individual layers in the ionic liquid double layer thicken and the\nlayering persists further away from the interface. We model the reflectivity\nusing a modified distorted crystal model with alternating cation and anion\nlayers, which allows us to extract the charge density and the potential near\nthe surface. We find that the charge density is strongly oscillatory with and\nwithout applied potential, and that with applied gate bias of 4.5 V the first\ntwo layers become significantly more cation rich than at zero bias,\naccumulating about $2.5 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ excess charge density.\n", "  Electrolyte gating using ionic liquid electrolytes has recently generated\nconsiderable interest as a method to achieve large carrier density modulations\nin a variety of materials. In noble metal thin films, electrolyte gating\nresults in large changes in sheet resistance. The widely accepted mechanism for\nthese changes is the formation of an electric double layer with a charged layer\nof ions in the liquid and accumulation or depletion of carriers in the thin\nfilm. We report here a different mechanism. In particular, we show using x-ray\nabsorption near edge structure (XANES) that the previously reported large\nconductance modulation in gold films is due to reversible oxidation and\nreduction of the surface rather than the charging of an electric double layer.\nWe show that the double layer capacitance accounts for less than 10\\% of the\nobserved change in transport properties. These results represent a significant\nstep towards understanding the mechanisms involved in electrolyte gating.\n", "  We report on reflection spectra of caesium atoms in close vicinity of a\nnanostructured metallic meta-surface. We show that the hyperfine sub-Doppler\nspectrum of the $6S_{1/2} - 6P_{3/2}$ resonance transition at 852 nm is\nstrongly affected by the coupling to the plasmonic resonance of the\nnanostructure. Fine tuning of dispersion and positions of the atomic lines in\nthe near-field of plasmonic metamaterials could have uses and implications for\nthe atom-based metrology, sensing and the development of atom-on-a-chip\ndevices.\n", "  We discuss recently proposed observables, sensitive to BFKL dynamics, in the\ncontext of multijet production at the large hadron collider (LHC). In\nparticular, we consider ratios of azimuthal angle differences in final states\nwith three jets, well separated in rapidity from each other, with two of them\nbeing very forward/backward and the third one in the central region.\n", "  We propose a new mechanism that enables heat flow from a colder region to a\nhotter region without necessitating either particle transport or external work\non the conductor, thereby bypassing the compressor part of a classical heat\npump cycle. Our mechanism relies on thermostatting the kinetic and\nconfigurational temperatures of the same particle differently. We keep the two\nends of a conductor, which in the present study is a single dimensional\n$\\phi^4$ chain, at the same kinetic temperature $T_0$, but at different\nconfigurational temperatures - one end hotter and the other end colder than\n$T_0$. While external energy is needed within the thermostatted regions to\nachieve this differential thermostatting, no external work is performed on the\nsystem itself. We show that the mechanism satisfies the statistical form of the\nsecond law of thermodynamics (the fluctuation theorem). The proposed mechanism\nreveals two interesting findings - (i) contrary to traditional thermodynamics\nwhere only the kinetic temperature is thought to govern heat conduction,\nconfigurational temperature can also play an important role, and (ii) the\nrelative temperature difference between the kinetic and configurational\nvariables governs the direction of heat flow. The challenge, however, is in\ndeveloping experimental techniques to thermostat the kinetic and\nconfigurational variables of the same particle at different values.\n", "  The Internet is a man-made complex system under constant attacks (e.g.,\nAdvanced Persistent Threats and malwares). It is therefore important to\nunderstand the phenomena that can be induced by the interaction between cyber\nattacks and cyber defenses. In this paper, we explore the rich phenomena that\ncan be exhibited when the defender employs active defense to combat cyber\nattacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that\n{\\em active cyber defense dynamics} (or more generally, {\\em cybersecurity\ndynamics}) can exhibit the bifurcation and chaos phenomena. This has profound\nimplications for cyber security measurement and prediction: (i) it is\ninfeasible (or even impossible) to accurately measure and predict cyber\nsecurity under certain circumstances; (ii) the defender must manipulate the\ndynamics to avoid such {\\em unmanageable situations} in real-life defense\noperations.\n", "  We discuss some aspects of the relation between dualities and gauge\nsymmetries. Both of these ideas are of course multi-faceted, and we confine\nourselves to making two points. Both points are about dualities in string\ntheory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer in\ncontent' than you might think. For both points, we adopt a simple conception of\na duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriate\nbijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.\n  The first point (Section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes with\ntwo dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense of\nbeing physically equivalent. For a string duality, such as T-duality and\ngauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of a\ncompact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.\n  The second point (Sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. We give a\nresult about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries\n(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that are\nspacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect. For gauge theories,\nyou might expect that the duality bijections relate only gauge-invariant\nquantities and states, in the sense that gauge symmetries in one theory will be\nunrelated to any symmetries in the other theory. This may be so in general; and\nindeed, it is suggested by discussions of Polchinski and Horowitz. But we show\nthat in gauge/gravity duality, each of a certain class of gauge symmetries in\nthe gravity/bulk theory, viz. diffeomorphisms, is related by the duality to a\nposition-dependent symmetry of the gauge/boundary theory.\n", "  We propose a generalized GPU-based connected component labeling (CCL)\nalgorithm that can be applied to both various lattices and to non-lattice\nenvironments in a uniform fashion. We extend our recent GPU-based CCL algorithm\nwithout the use of conventional iteration to the generalized method. As an\napplication of this algorithm, we deal with the bond percolation problem. We\ninvestigate bond percolation on the honeycomb and triangle lattices to confirm\nthe correctness of this algorithm. Moreover, we deal with bond percolation on\nthe Bethe lattice as a substitute for a network structure, and demonstrate the\nperformance of this algorithm on those lattices.\n", "  The coercive field of permanent magnets decays with temperature. At non-zero\ntemperature the system can overcome a finite energy barrier through thermal\nfluctuations. Using finite element micromagnetic simulations, we quantify this\neffect, which reduces coercivity in addition to the decrease of the coercive\nfield associated with the temperature dependence of the anisotropy field, and\nvalidate the method through comparison with existing experimental data.\n", "  We have constructed the three-body permutation symmetric O(6) hyperspherical\nharmonics which can be used to solve the non-relativistic three-body Schr{\\\"\no}dinger equation in three spatial dimensions. We label the states with\neigenvalues of the $U(1) \\otimes SO(3)_{rot} \\subset U(3) \\subset O(6)$ chain\nof algebras and we present the corresponding $K \\leq 4$ harmonics. Concrete\ntransformation properties of the harmonics are discussed in some detail.\n", "  We investigate the uncertainties of fitted X-ray model parameters and fluxes\nfor relatively faint Chandra ACIS-I source spectra. Monte-Carlo (MC)\nsimulations are employed to construct a large set of 150,000 fake X-ray spectra\nin the low photon count statistics regime (from 20 to 350 net counts) using the\nXSPEC spectral model fitting package. The simulations employed both absorbed\nthermal (APEC) and non-thermal (power-law) models, in concert with the Chandra\nACIS-I instrument response and interstellar absorption. Simulated X-ray spectra\nwere fit assuming a wide set of different input parameters and C-statistic\nminimization criteria to avoid numerical artifacts in the accepted solutions.\nResults provide an error estimate for each parameter (absorption, NH, plasma\ntemperature, kT, or power-law slope, Gamma, and flux, and for different\nbackground contamination levels. The distributions of these errors are studied\nas a function of the 1 sigma quantiles and we show how these correlate with\ndifferent model parameters, net counts in the spectra and relative background\nlevel. Maps of uncertainty in terms of the 1 sigma quantiles for parameters and\nflux are computed as a function of spectrum net counts. We find very good\nagreement between our estimated X-ray spectral parameter and flux uncertainties\nand those recovered from spectral fitting for a subset of the X-ray sources\ndetected in the Chandra Cygnus OB2 Legacy Survey diagnosed to be Association\nmembers and that have between 20 and 350 net counts. Our method can provide\nuncertainties for spectral parameters whenever formal X-ray spectral fits\ncannot be well-constrained, or are unavailable, and predictions useful for\ncomputing Chandra ACIS-I exposure times for observation planning.\n", "  In the present paper, we identify several distributions from Physics and\nstudy their applicability to phenomena such as distribution of income, wealth,\nand expenditure. Firstly, we apply logistic distribution to these data and we\nfind that it fits very well the annual data for the entire income interval\nincluding for upper income segment of population. Secondly, we apply\nFermi-Dirac distribution to these data. We seek to explain possible\ncorrelations and analogies between economic systems and statistical\nthermodynamics systems. We try to explain their behavior and properties when we\ncorrelate physical variables with macroeconomic aggregates and indicators. Then\nwe draw some analogies between parameters of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and\nmacroeconomic variables. Thirdly, as complex systems are modeled using\npolynomial distributions, we apply polynomials to the annual sets of data and\nwe find that it fits very well also the entire income interval. Fourthly, we\ndevelop a new methodology to approach dynamically the income, wealth, and\nexpenditure distribution similarly with dynamical complex systems. This\nmethodology was applied to different time intervals consisting of consecutive\nyears up to 35 years. Finally, we develop a mathematical model based on a\nHamiltonian that maximizes utility function applied to Ramsey model using\nFermi-Dirac and polynomial utility functions. We find some theoretical\nconnections with time preference theory. We apply these distributions to a\nlarge pool of data from countries with different levels of development, using\ndifferent methods for calculation of income, wealth, and expenditure.\n", "  The precise radial velocity survey at Keck Observatory began over 20 years\nago. Its survey of thousands of stars now has the time baseline to be sensitive\nto planets with decade-long orbits, including Jupiter analogs. I present\nseveral newly-finished orbital solutions for long-period giant planets.\nAlthough hot Jupiters are generally \"lonely\" (i.e. they are not part of\nmultiplanet systems), those that are not appear to often have giant companions\nat 5 AU or beyond. I present two of the highest period- ratios among planets in\na two-planet system, and some of the longest orbital periods ever measured for\nexoplanets. In many cases, combining Keck radial velocities from those from\nother long-term surveys at Lick Observatory, McDonald Observatory, HARPS, and,\nof course, OHP spectrographs, produces superior orbital fits, constraining both\nperiod and eccentricity better than could be possible with any single set\nalone. Stellar magnetic activity cycles can masquerade as long-period planets.\nIn most cases this effect is very small, but a loud minority of stars,\nincluding, apparently, HD 154345, show very strong RV-activity correlations.\n", "  Oxygen plays a critical role in strongly correlated transition metal oxides\nas crystal field effect is one of the key factors that determine the degree of\nlocalization of the valence d/f states. Based on the localization, a set of\nconventional mechanisms such as Mott-Hubbard, Charge-transfer and Slater were\nformulated to explain the antiferromagnetic and insulating (AFI) phenomena in\nmany of these correlated systems. From the case study on LiFePO4, through\ndensity-functional calculations, we demonstrate that none of these mechanisms\nare strictly applicable to explain the AFI behavior when the transition metal\noxides have polyanions such as (PO4)3-. The symmetry-lowering of the\nmetal-oxygen complex, to stabilize the polyanion, creates an asymmetric crystal\nfield for d/f states. In LiFePO4 this field creates completely non-degenerate\nFe-d states which, with negligible p-d and d-d covalent interactions, become\natomically localized to ensure a gap at the Fermi level. Due to large exchange\nsplitting, high spin state is favored and an antiferromagnetic configuration is\nstabilized. For the prototype LiFePO4, independent electron approximation is\ngood enough to obtain the AFI ground state. Inclusion of additional correlation\nmeasures like Hubbard U simply amplifies the gap and therefore LiFePO4 can be\npreferably called as weakly coupled Mott insulator.\n", "  A quantitatively verifiable expression for the Gravitational Constant is\nderived in terms of quantum mechanical quantities. This derivation appears to\nbe possible by selecting a suitable physical process in which the\ntransformation of the equation of motion into a quantum mechanical wave\nequation can be obtained by Einstein's geodesic approach. The selected process\nis the pi-meson, modeled as the one-body equivalent of a two-body quantum\nmechanical oscillator in which the vibrating mass is modeled as the result of\nthe two energy fluxes from the quark and the antiquark. The quantum mechanical\nformula for the Gravitational Constant appears to show a quantitatively\nverifiable relationship with the Higgs boson as conceived in the Standard\nModel.\n", "  One of the primary goals of contemporary physics of neutrinos after discovery\nof their masses become the investigation of their electromagnetic properties.\nThis is a necessary step for creation of new physics beyond the Standard Model\n(SM), which no longer can claim the role theory explaining everything\nphenomenon of the Universe. On this it should draw attention because SM remains\nconsistent local scheme for any value of the masses of particles $0\\leq m\n<\\infty $. Now the masses of elementary particles can exceed even Planck's mass\n$m_{Planck}\\simeq 10^{19}GeV$, which is the largest scale mass in the Universe.\nFor solving this problem of studying of electromagnetic interactions of\nneutrino we suggest use the methods of relativistic quantum theory with the\nlimiting mass $m\\leq M$. The restriction of mass spectrum of fermions can be\nobtained in the frame of non-Hermitian (pseudo-Hermitian) fermion systems\nhaving the direct application to the neutrino physics. The systems of the\nsimilar type include so-called parity-time-symmetric (${\\cal PTS}$) - models,\nwhich already are used in various fields of modern physics and, in particular\nfor experimental investigation of ${\\cal PTS}$-optics. We also hope that\nexperimental problem neutrinos with the negative mass squared could be also\nsolved on the basis of ${\\cal PTS}$-notions taking into account the\ncharacteristics of neutrinos of new type (\"exotic neutrino\") emerging in the\ntheory with the Maximal Mass.\n", "  A selection of results for searches for exotic physics at the LHC are\npresented. These include a search for massive resonances, dark matter with a\nhigh energy jet in association with large missing transverse momentum,\nlong-lived neutral particles, and narrow dijet resonances. The results are\nbased on 20/fb of LHC proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV taken with\nthe CMS detector.\n", "  In this article, we consider fixed spin 1/2 particles interacting through the\nquantized electromagnetic field in a constant magnetic field. We give some\nasymptotic expansions for the ground state and the ground state energy of the\nHamiltonian operator $H(h)$ describing this system. The first terms of these\nexpansions enable to recover elementary formulas for the energy and the\nmagnetic field of the spins when considered as magnets. A first order radiative\ncorrection is computed for the energy.\n", "  We present a classically scale-invariant model where the dark matter,\nneutrino and electroweak mass scales are dynamically generated from\ndimensionless couplings. The Standard Model gauge sector is extended by a dark\n$SU(2)_X$ gauge symmetry that is completely broken through a complex scalar\ndoublet via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The three resulting dark vector\nbosons of equal mass are stable and can play the role of dark matter. We also\nincorporate right-handed neutrinos which are coupled to a real singlet scalar\nthat communicates with the other scalars through portal interactions. The\nmulti-Higgs sector is analyzed by imposing theoretical and experimental\nconstraints. We compute the dark matter relic abundance and study the\npossibility of the direct detection of the dark matter candidate from XENON 1T.\n", "  Electric field effect in electronic double layer transistor (EDLT)\nconfiguration with ionic liquids as the dielectric materials is a powerful\nmeans of exploring various properties in different materials. Here we\ndemonstrate the modulation of electrical transport properties and extremely\nhigh mobility of two-dimensional electron gas at LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO)\ninterface through ionic liquid-assisted electric field effect. By changing the\ngate voltages, the depletion of charge carrier and the resultant enhancement of\nelectron mobility up to 19380 cm$^2$/Vs are realized, leading to quantum\noscillations of the conductivity at the LAO/STO interface. The present results\nsuggest that high-mobility oxide interfaces which exhibit quantum phenomena\ncould be obtained by ionic liquid-assisted field effect.\n", "  We demonstrate resonant Faraday polarization rotation in plasmonic arrays of\nbimetallic nano-ring resonators consisting of Au and Ni sections. This\nmetamaterial design allows to optimize the trade-off between the enhancement of\nmagneto-optical effects and plasmonic dissipation. Although Ni sections\ncorrespond to as little as ~6% of the total surface of the metamaterial, the\nresulting magneto-optically induced polarization rotation is equal to that of a\ncontinuous film. Such bimetallic metamaterials can be used in compact magnetic\nsensors, active plasmonic components and integrated photonic circuits.\n", "  We demonstrate polarization controlled absorption in plasmonic bimetallic\nmetamaterials. We fabricate and experimentally characterize Au/Ni ring\nresonator arrays, where by varying the wavelength and polarization of the\nincident wave, local electromagnetic fields and dissipation can be suppressed\nor enhanced in the Au and Ni areas of the rings.\n", "  Recent experiments with Yb-173 and Sr-87 isotopes provide new possibilities\nto study high spin two-orbital systems. Within these experiments part of the\natoms are excited to a higher energy metastable electronic state mimicking an\nadditional internal (orbital) degree of freedom. The interaction between the\natoms depends on the orbital states, therefore four different scattering\nchannels can be identified in the system characterized by four independent\ncouplings. When the system is confined into a one-dimensional chain the\nscattering lengths can be tuned by changing the transverse confinement, and\ndriven through four resonances. Using the new available experimental data of\nthe scattering lengths we analyze the phase diagram of the one-dimensional\nsystem as the couplings are tuned via transverse confinement, and the\npopulations of the two orbital states are changed. We found that three orders\ncompete showing power law decay: a state with dominant density wave\nfluctuations, another one with spin density fluctuations, and a third one\ncharacterized by exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like pairs consisting\none atom in the electronic ground state and one in the excited state. We also\nshow that sufficiently close to the resonances the compressibility of the\nsystem starts to diverge indicating that the emerging order is unstable and\ncollapses to a phase separated state with a first order phase transition.\n", "  Quantum duality is a far reaching concept in contemporary theoretical\nphysics. In the present paper, we reveal the quantum dualities in quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) phases through concrete two bands Hamiltonian models. Our\nmodels can realize QAH phases with arbitrary large Chern numbers. In real\nmaterials these models may be realized by stacked $n$ layer systems of $c_1=1$\nQAH insulators. The topological phase transitions that can change the Chern\nnumbers are studied. And we investigate the gapless edge modes of our models in\ndetails, and find a new mechanism for the bulk boundary correspondence.\n", "  Searches for Dark Matter at the LHC are commonly described in terms of\nsimplified models with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and axial-vector\nmediators. In this work we explore the constraints imposed on such models from\nthe observed Dark Matter relic abundance. We present these constraints over a\nrange of mediator masses relevant for the LHC and for future, higher energy\ncolliders. We additionally compute bounds from a photon line search for the\ndecay of a pseudo-scalar mediator to di-photons that includes the mediator mass\nregion near 750 GeV. Finally, we compare cosmological constraints with the\nreach of a possible future 100 TeV circular hadron collider, indirect, and\ndirect detection experiments.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)\nand black phosphorus (BP) have beneficial electronic, optical, and physical\nproperties at the few-layer limit. As atomically thin materials, 2D TMDCs and\nBP are highly sensitive to their environment and chemical modification,\nresulting in a strong dependence of their properties on substrate effects,\nintrinsic defects, and extrinsic adsorbates. Furthermore, the integration of 2D\nsemiconductors into electronic and optoelectronic devices introduces unique\nchallenges at metal-semiconductor and dielectric-semiconductor interfaces.\nHere, we review emerging efforts to understand and exploit chemical effects to\ninfluence the properties of 2D TMDCs and BP. In some cases, surface chemistry\nleads to significant degradation, thus necessitating the development of robust\npassivation schemes. On the other hand, appropriately designed chemical\nmodification can be used to beneficially tailor electronic properties, such as\ncontrolling doping levels and charge carrier concentrations. Overall, chemical\nmethods allow substantial tunability of the properties of 2D TMDCs and BP,\nthereby enabling significant future opportunities to optimize performance for\ndevice applications.\n", "  Recently, along with the development of quantum information, quantum\nentanglemant became a hot topic of people. Quantum entanglemant is one of the\nmost amazing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is totally different from\nclassical physics. However, system would interact with environment in the\npractical quantum information process. The entanglement would be broken. In\nthis paper, we study the disentanglement evolution of three spin qubits in an\nXY spin-chain environment. The dynamical process of the disentanglement is\ninvestigated. We found the exact expression of the coherence factor. We discuss\nthe coherence factor and the parameters, and then we illustrate that the\ndisentanglement of central spins is best enhanced by the quantum critical\nbehavior of the environmental spin chain. Furthermore, a scaling rule is\nobtained.\n", "  This is a discussion on degrees of freedom of massless fermion and boson\nfields, if they are free or weakly interacting. We generalize the gauge fields\nof $S^{ab}$ - $\\omega_{abc}$ - and of $\\tilde{S}^{ab}$ - $\n\\tilde{\\omega}_{abc}$ - of the spin-charge-family to the gauge fields of all\npossible products of $\\gamma^a$'s and of all possible products of\n$\\tilde{\\gamma}^a$'s, the first taking care in the {\\it spin-charge-family}\ntheory of the spins and charges quantum numbers ($\\tau^{Ai}=\\sum_{a,b}\nc^{Ai}{}_{ab} \\,S^{ab}$) of fermions, the second ($\\tilde{\\tau}^{Ai}=\n\\sum_{a,b} \\tilde{c}^{Ai}{}_{ab}\\, \\tilde{S}^{ab}$) taking care of the families\nquantum numbers.\n", "  Rectification of thermal fluctuations in mesoscopic conductors is the key\nidea of today's attempts to build nanoscale thermoelectric energy harvesters in\norder to convert heat into a useful electric power. So far, most concepts make\nuse of the Seebeck effect in a two-terminal geometry where heat and charge are\nboth carried by the same particles. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the\nworking principle of a new kind of energy harvester, proposed recently using\ntwo capacitively coupled quantum dots. We show that due to its novel\nthree-terminal design which spatially separates the heat reservoir from the\nconductor circuit, the directions of charge and heat flow become decoupled in\nour device. This enables us to manipulate the direction of the generated charge\ncurrent by means of external gate voltages while leaving the direction of heat\nflow unaffected. Our results pave the way for a new generation of\nmulti-terminal, highly efficient nanoscale heat engines.\n", "  We present results of a multi-year study of the high-amplitude $\\delta$ Scuti\n(HADS) star GSC 03144-595. The star was observed between June and September in\n2011 and 2014 for 13 nights and 28 nights respectively. Based on our results we\nargue that GSC 03144-595 is a new triple-mode radially pulsating HADS, only the\nfifth discovered and only the second that has a fundamental frequency in the\ntraditional $\\delta$ Scuti regime. While the frequencies and amplitudes of the\nfundamental and first harmonic were found to be unchanged between 2011 and\n2014, we found that the amplitude of the second harmonic increased by 44\\%, a\nform of evolution not previously seen. This finding suggests that the second\nharmonic may be transient, thus explaining the scarcity of triple mode HADS\nstars.\n", "  Pump-and-probe photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) with femtosecond pulsed\nsources opens new perspectives in the investigation of the ultrafast dynamics\nof physical and chemical processes at the surfaces and interfaces of solids.\nNevertheless, for very intense photon pulses a large number of photoelectrons\nare simultaneously emitted and their mutual Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently\nstrong to significantly modify their trajectory and kinetic energy. This\nphenomenon, referred as space-charge effect, determines a broadening and shift\nin energy for the typical PES structures and a dramatic loss of energy\nresolution. In this article we examine the effects of space charge in PES with\na particular focus on time-resolved hard X-ray (~10 keV) experiments. The\ntrajectory of the electrons photoemitted from pure Cu in a hard X-ray PES\nexperiment has been reproduced through $N$-body simulations and the broadening\nof the photoemission core-level peaks has been monitored as a function of\nvarious parameters (photons per pulse, linear dimension of the photon spot,\nphoton energy). The energy broadening results directly proportional to the\nnumber $N$ of electrons emitted per pulse (mainly represented by secondary\nelectrons) and inversely proportional to the linear dimension $a$ of the photon\nspot on the sample surface, in agreement with the literature data about\nultraviolet and soft X-ray experiments. The evolution in time of the energy\nbroadening during the flight of the photoelectrons is also studied. Despite its\ndetrimental consequences on the energy spectra, we found that space charge has\nnegligible effects on the momentum distribution of photoelectrons and a\nmomentum broadening is not expected to affect angle-resolved experiments.\nStrategy to reduce the energy broadening and the feasibility of hard X-ray PES\nexperiments at the new free-electron laser facilities are discussed.\n", "  We present a simple alternative to the Crystal Ball function that has an\nexponential tail stitched to a Gaussian core. It has one parameter less than\nthe Crystal Ball function and, where appropriate, offers more stable fits to\npeaks that continue into exponential tails. The function may also be extended\nwith two exponential tails on each side of the Gaussian, and this has two\nparameters less than the corresponding double-shouldered Crystal Ball function.\nThis function has been used to model background and signal processes in a\nrecent Higgs pair production search and may be of versatile use in experimental\nphysics and other fields.\n", "  An exotic Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has an angular momentum\nlarger than its mass in three dimension (3D), which suggests the possibility\nthat cosmic censorship could be violated if angular momentum is extracted by\nthe Penrose process. In this paper, we propose a mass formula for the exotic\nBTZ black hole and show no violation of weak cosmic censorship in the gedanken\nprocess above by understanding properly its mass formula. Unlike the other\nblack holes, the total energy of the exotic BTZ black hole is represented by\nthe angular momentum instead of the mass, which supports a basic point of view\nthat the same geometry should be determined by the same energy in 3D general\nrelativity whose equation of motion can be given either by normal 3D Einstein\ngravity or by exotic 3D Einstein gravity. However, only the mass of the exotic\nblack hole is related to the thermodynamics and other forms of energy are\n\"dumb\", which is consistent with the earlier thermodynamic analysis about\nexotic black holes.\n", "  The present study elucidates the correlation between the structural and\noptical properties of GaN nanowires grown on Si(111) substrate by plasma\nassisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) technique under various growth\nconditions. GaN NWs exhibiting different shapes, sizes and distribution were\ngrown at various substrate temperatures with same Ga-N (III-V) ratio of 0.4. We\nobserve that sample grown at lower substrate temperature (~700 degC) results\n2-dimensional island like structure with almost very little (~30%) circularity\nwhile increasing substrate temperature (>770 degC) leads to growth of\nindividual GaN NW (>80% circularity) with excellent structural properties. The\ntemperature dependent photoluminescence measurement together with analysis of\nRAMAN active modes provides legitimate evidences of strong correlation between\nthe structure and optical properties GaN nanowires grown on Si substrates.\n", "  In this article we try to describe the physics of a standard optical\ninterferometer fed by \"quantum\" photons in terms of primitive, nevertheless\naccurate formulation. We derive explicit interferene patterns and show how they\nvary depending on the input photon state.\n", "  We give a brief exposition of the approach based on the methods of spectral\ngeometry and the spectral action principle to construction and analysis of\nmodels on a foliated space-time.\n", "  We report the magnetic, magnetocaloric, and magnetotransport properties of\nthe semi-Heusler alloy Cu0.85Ni0.15MnSb, which exhibits coexistence of\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. A broad magnetic phase\ntransition is evident from the temperature variations of magnetization, heat\ncapacity, and isothermal magnetic entropy change. This is due to the presence\nof both AFM and FM phases at low temperatures. The variation of electrical\nresistivity with temperature shows three distinct regions of magnetic phases.\nThe magnetoresistance (MR) results also show the presence of AFM and FM phases\nat temperatures below 45 K, and a FM phase at temperature above 45K. Though\nthere is no signature of a spin-glass state at low temperatures, various\nresults point towards the presence of short-range magnetic correlations at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We study both massive and massless particle's geodesic motion in the\nbackground of general dimensional AdS-Sol space-time. We find that the massive\nparticles oscillate along the radial direction, while massless particles\nexperience one-time bouncing as they approach the \"horizon\" line of the\nsoliton. Our results provide a direct way to understand the negative\nenergy/masses leading to the AdS-Sol geometry. As a potential application, we\nextend the point particle to a 3-brane and fix the background as a 5+1\ndimension AdS-Sol, thus obtain a very natural bouncing/cyclic cosmological\nmodel.\n", "  The present theory has investigated the FQHE without any quasi-particle. The\nelectric field due to the Hall voltage is taken into consideration. We find the\nground state where the electron configuration is uniquely determined so as to\nhave the minimum classical Coulomb energy. Residual Coulomb interaction HI\nyields quantum transitions which satisfy the momentum conservation along the\ncurrent direction. The number of Coulomb transitions from nearest electron\npairs is dependent sensitively upon the fractional number of the filling\nfactor. For example, the number u(2/3) of allowed transitions at nu=2/3\nabruptly decreases when the filling factor nu deviates slightly from 2/3. The\nlimiting value of the number is equal to half of u(2/3). The discontinuous\nbehavior produces the valley structure in the energy spectrum. This mechanism\nproduces the Hall plateaus at the specific filling factors nu=1/(2j+1), 2j\n/(2j+1), j/(2j+1), j/(2j-1) etc. and also at the non-standard filling factors\nnu=7/11, 4/11, 4/13, 5/13, 5/17, 6/17 etc. We have studied the pair energies of\nmore distant electron pairs in Chapter 5. Thereby the small valley structure\nyields at nu=5/2, 7/2 and so on. The shapes of polarization curves depend\nmainly upon the numerator of the fractional filling factor in nu<1 because the\nspin polarization belongs to electrons only. There are many spin-arrangements\nwith the same eigen-energy of HD. The Coulomb interaction HI yields quantum\ntransitions among these degenerate ground states. The partial Hamiltonian has\nbeen diagonalized exactly. The eigen-states give the spin polarization versus\nmagnetic field strength. The theoretical curves of the spin polarization are in\ngood agreement with the experimental data as studied in Chapter 9. Thus the\npresent theory has well explained the various phenomena of the FQHE.\n", "  The present work investigates the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid\nin $f(R)$ gravity models. For a general $f(R)$ theory, it is shown analytically\nthat a collapse is quite possible. The singularity formed as a result of the\ncollapse is found to be a curvature singularity of shell focusing type. The\npossibility of the formation of an apparent horizon hiding the central\nsingularity depends on the initial conditions.\n", "  We simulate long self-avoiding chains using a weighted-biased sampling\nMonte-Carlo algorithm, and compute the probabilities for chain looping with and\nwithout a protrusion. We find that a protrusion near one of the chain's termini\nreduces the probability of looping, even for chains much longer than the\nprotrusion-chain-terminus distance. This effect increases with protrusion size,\nand decreases with protrusion-terminus distance. We model the simulated results\ntheoretically by considering how the protrusion \"eclipses\" the chain terminus\ncloser to the protrusion from the more distant chain terminus. This eclipse\nmechanism has implications for understanding the regulatory role of proteins\nbound to DNA.\n", "  A general analytical expression for the double differential cross section of\ninclusive deuteron stripping reaction on nuclei at intermediate energies of\nincident particles was obtained in the diffraction approximation.\nNucleon-nucleus phases were calculated in the framework of Glauber formalism\nand making use of the double-folding potential. The exact wave function of\ndeuteron with correct asymptotics at short and long distances between nucleons\nwas used. The calculated angular dependencies of cross sections are in good\nagreement with corresponding experimental data.\n", "  We have started a comprehensive analysis of the Kepler K2 Field 3 data set.\nOur goals are to assess the statistics of the sample, and to search for\npeculiar stars. We found a candidate triple-mode RRab star, where the first and\nninth overtones also seem to be excited.\n", "  We analyze two-particle pseudorapidity correlations in a simple model, where\nstrings of fluctuating length are attached to wounded nucleons.The obtained\nstraightforward formulas allow us to understand the anatomy of the\ncorrelations, i.e., to identify the component due to the fluctuation of the\nnumber of wounded nucleons and the contribution from the string length\nfluctuations. Our results reproduce qualitatively and semiquantitatively the\nbasic features of the recent correlation measurements at the LHC.\n", "  The Kondo effect is the many-body screening of a local spin by a cloud of\nelectrons at very low temperature. It has been proposed as an explanation of\nthe zero-bias anomaly in quantum point contacts where interactions drive a\nspontaneous charge localization. However, the Kondo origin of this anomaly\nremains under debate, and additional experimental evidence is necessary. Here\nwe report on the first phase-sensitive measurement of the zero-bias anomaly in\nquantum point contacts using a scanning gate microscope to create an electronic\ninterferometer. We observe an abrupt shift of the interference fringes by half\na period in the bias range of the zero-bias anomaly, a behavior which cannot be\nreproduced by single-particle models. We instead relate it to the phase shift\nexperienced by electrons scattering off a Kondo system. Our experiment\ntherefore provides new evidence of this many-body effect in quantum point\ncontacts.\n", "  In this paper a simulation of measurements of the Higgs boson decay to\nelectroweak bosons in $e^+e^-$ collisions at CLIC is presented. Higgs boson\nproduction and subsequent $H\\rightarrow ZZ^\\ast$ and $H\\rightarrow WW^\\ast$\ndecay processes were simulated alongside the relevant background processes at\n350 GeV and 1.4 TeV center-of-mass energy. Full detector simulation and event\nreconstruction were used under realistic beam conditions. The achievable\nstatistical precision of the measured product of the Higgs production cross\nsection and the branching ratio for the analysed decays has been determined.\n", "  Because of the high energies involved, giant impacts that occur during\nplanetary accretion cause large degrees of melting. The depth of melting in the\ntarget body after each collision determines the pressure and temperature\nconditions of metal-silicate equilibration and thus geochemical fractionation\nthat results from core-mantle differentiation. The accretional collisions\ninvolved in forming the terrestrial planets of the inner Solar System have been\ncalculated by previous studies using N-body accretion simulations. Here we use\nthe output from such simulations to determine the volumes of melt produced and\nthus the pressure and temperature conditions of metal-silicate equilibration,\nafter each impact, as Earth-like planets accrete. For these calculations a\nparametrised melting model is used that takes impact velocity, impact angle and\nthe respective masses of the impacting bodies into account. The evolution of\nmetal-silicate equilibration pressures (as defined by evolving magma ocean\ndepths) during Earth's accretion depends strongly on the lifetime of\nimpact-generated magma oceans compared to the time interval between large\nimpacts. In addition, such results depend on starting parameters in the N-body\nsimulations, such as the number and initial mass of embryos. Thus, there is the\npotential for combining the results, such as those presented here, with\nmultistage core formation models to better constrain the accretional history of\nthe Earth.\n", "  We propose a design for an universal absorber, characterized by a resonance\nfrequency that can be tuned from visible to microwave frequencies independently\nof the choice of the metal and the dielectrics involved. An almost resonant\nperfect absorption up to 99.8 % is demonstrated at resonance for all\npolarization states of light and for a very wide angular aperture. These\nproperties originate from a magnetic Fabry-Perot mode that is confined in a\ndielectric spacer of $\\lambda/100$ thickness by a metamaterial layer and a\nmirror. An extraordinary large funneling through nano-slits explains how light\ncan be trapped in the structure. Simple scaling laws can be used as a recipe to\ndesign ultra-thin perfect absorbers whatever the materials and the desired\nresonance wavelength, making our design truly universal.\n", "  The work is devoted to the analysis of cell population dynamics where cells\nmake a choice between differentiation and apoptosis. This choice is based on\nthe values of intracellular proteins whose concentrations are described by a\nsystem of ordinary differential equations with bistable dynamics. Intracellular\nregulation and cell fate are controlled by the extracellular regulation through\nthe number of differentiated cells. Initial intracellular protein\nconcentrations are considered for each cell as random variables with a given\narea of variation. Intracellular regulation, extracellular regulation and\nrandom initial conditions work together to produce differentiated cells and to\ncontrol their number. The role of intracellular regulation is to provide a\npossible choice between differentiation and apoptosis, extracellular regulation\ncontrols the number of differentiated cells, stochastic initial conditions can\nsuppress oscillations and provide stability of the system.\n", "  We study the process of quantum tunnelling in self-interacting scalar field\ntheories with non-minimal coupling to gravity. In these theories gravitational\ninstantons can develop a neck -- a feature prohibited in theories with minimal\ncoupling, and describing the nucleation of geometries containing a wormhole. We\nalso clarify the relationship of neck geometries to violations of the null\nenergy condition.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically non-trivial spin whirls that may not be\ntransformed continuously into topologically trivial states such as\nferromagnetic spin alignment. In recent years lattice structures composed of\nskyrmions have been discovered in certain bulk chiral magnets with\nnon-centrosymmetric crystal structures. The magnetic phase diagrams of these\nmaterials share remarkable similarities despite great variations of the\ncharacteristic temperature, field, and length scales and regardless whether the\nunderlying electronic state is that of a metal, semiconductor, or insulator.\n", "  When producing electricity that collects the mass energy that is available at\nthe time of the induced disintegration of radioactive elements, other unstable\nelements are produced with half-life span durations ranging from less than one\nsecond to hundreds of thousands of years and which are considered as waste.\nManaging nuclear waste with a half-life of less than 30 years is an easy task,\nas our societies clearly know how to keep buildings safe for more than a\ncentury, the time it takes for the activity to be divided by a factor of 8.\nHigh-activity, long-lasting waste that can last for thousands of years or even\nlonger, up to geological time laps, cannot be taken care of for such long\ndurations. Therefore, these types of waste are socially unacceptable; nobody\nwants to leave a polluted planet to descendants.\n", "  For single and twochannel nucleon-nucleon scattering the asymptotic form of\nthe phase function for r->0 were taken into account for the asymptotic behavior\nof the wave function. Asymptotics of the wave function will not r^(l+1), and\nwill have a more complex view and be also determined by the behavior of the\npotential near the origin. Have examined the cases for nonsingular (weakly\nsingular) and strongly singular potentials. Were the numerical calculations of\nphase, amplitude and wave functions for the nucleon-nucleon potential Argonne\nv18. Considered 1S0-, 3P0-, 3P1- states of the np- system.\n", "  Current-induced magnetization excitation is a core phenomenon for\nnext-generation magnetic nanodevices, and has been attributed to the\nspin-transfer torque (STT) that originates from the transfer of the spin\nangular momentum between a conduction electron and a local magnetic moment\nthrough the exchange coupling. However, the same coupling can transfer not only\nspin but also energy, though the latter transfer mechanism has been largely\nignored. Here we report on experimental evidence concerning the energy transfer\nin ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers. The magnetoresistance (MR) is found to\ndepend significantly on the current direction down to low in-plane currents,\nfor which STT cannot play any significant role. Instead we find that the\nobserved MR is consistent with the energy transfer mechanism through the\nquantum spin-flip process, which predicts short wavelength,\ncurrent-direction-dependent magnon excitations in the THz frequency range. Our\nresults unveil another aspect of current-induced magnetic excitation, and open\na channel for the dc-current-induced generation of THz magnons.\n", "  The strong interaction of antikaons with nucleons and nuclei in the\nlow-energy regime represents an active research field connected intrinsically\nwith few-body physics. There are important open questions like the question of\nantikaon nuclear bound states. A unique and rather direct experimental access\nto the antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths is provided by precision X-ray\nspectroscopy of transitions in low-lying states of light kaonic atoms like\nkaonic hydrogen isotopes. In the SIDDHARTA experiment at the electron-positron\ncollider DAFNE of LNF-INFN we measured the most precise values of the strong\ninteraction observables, i.e. the strong interaction on the 1s ground state of\nthe electromagnetically bound kaonic hydrogen atom leading to a hadronic shift\nand a hadronic broadening of the 1s state. The SIDDHARTA result triggered new\ntheoretical work which achieved major progress in the understanding of the\nlow-energy strong interaction with strangeness. Antikaon-nucleon scattering\nlengths have been calculated constrained by the SIDDHARTA data on kaonic\nhydrogen. For the extraction of the isospin-dependent scattering lengths a\nmeasurement of the hadronic shift and width of kaonic deuterium is necessary.\nTherefore, new X-ray studies with the focus on kaonic deuterium are in\npreparation (SIDDHARTA2). Many improvements in the experimental setup will\nallow to measure kaonic deuterium which is challenging due to the anticipated\nlow X-ray yield. Especially important are the data on the X-ray yields of\nkaonic deuterium extracted from a exploratory experiment within SIDDHARTA.\n", "  The small-scale kinematic dynamo in a two-dimensional chaotic flow is\nstudied. The analytic approach is developed in framework of the\nKraichnan-Kazantsev model. It is shown that the growth of magnetic field\n$\\bm{B}$ fluctuations stops at large times in accordance with so-called\nanti-dynamo theorems. The value of $\\bm{B}^2$ increased therewith in square of\nthe magnetic Prandtl number times. The spatial structure of the correlation\ntensor of the magnetic field is found.\n", "  Reversible Probabilistic Cellular Automata are a special class of automata\nwhose stationary behavior is described by Gibbs-like measures. For those models\nthe dynamics can be trapped for a very long time in states which are very\ndifferent from the ones typical of stationarity. This phenomenon can be\nrecasted in the framework of metastability theory which is typical of\nStatistical Mechanics.\n  In this paper we consider a model presenting two not degenerate in energy\nmetastable states which form a series, in the sense that, when the dynamics is\nstarted at one of them, before reaching stationarity, the system must\nnecessarily visit the second one. We discuss a rule for combining the exit\ntimes from each of the metastable states.\n", "  We consider two dimensional system governed by the Hamiltonian with delta\ninteraction supported by two concentric circles separated by distance $d$. We\nanalyze the asymptotics of the discrete eigenvalues for $d \\to 0$ as well as\nfor $d\\to \\infty$.\n", "  A one-parameter generalized Wigner-Heisenberg algebra( WHA) is reviewed in\ndetail. It is shown that WHA verifies the deformed commutation rule $[\\hat{x},\n\\hat{p}_{\\lambda}] = i(1 + 2\\lambda \\hat{R})$ and also highlights the dynamical\nsymmetries of the pseudo-harmonic oscillator( PHO). \\textbf{The present article\nis devoted to the study of new cat-states} built from $\\lambda$-deformed\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger coherent states, which according to the Barut-Girardello scheme\nare defined as the eigenstates of the generalized annihilation operator.\nParticular attention is devoted to the limiting case where the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\ncat states are obtained. Nonclassical features and quantum statistical\nproperties of these states are studied by evaluation of Mandel's parameter and\nquadrature squeezing with respect to the $\\lambda-$deformed canonical pairs $(\n\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}_{\\lambda})$. It is shown that these states minimize the\nuncertainty relations of each pair of the $su(1,1)$ components.\n", "  The idea that the success rate of a team increases when playing home is\nbroadly accepted and documented for a wide variety of sports. Investigations on\nthe so-called home advantage phenomenon date back to the 70's and every since\nhas attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies\nhave been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate\nit with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is\nknown about the effects of home advantage in the microscopic dynamics of the\ngame (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this\nphenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the\nNational Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more\nthan sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that\nhome advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the\nscoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams playing\nhome. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams,\nfor instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased\n0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing\nhome, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate\nincreases in only 0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these\nmicroscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when\nanalyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams\nsome regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average\ndifferences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to\nthe time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time,\nsuggesting a weakening of the phenomenon.\n", "  We present predictions of the mean multiplicity yields for different\ncentrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV at the LHC,\nobtained using the Monte-Carlo Modified Glauber model (MGM) [1]. Contrary to\ngenerally used standard Glauber calculations, the MGM takes into account the\nenergy conservation in the soft particles production. The only one efficient\nmodel parameter was tuned and fixed previously (k=0.35) by fitting the\navailable data on multiplicity for all colliding systems up to RHIC energies.\nThe MGM has shown already a good predictive capability for the yields at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV, and it is used again within the same MC code for the\ncalculations at $\\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV\n", "  We present the experimental implementation of double Bragg diffraction of\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as proposed in [E. Giese, A. Roura, G.\nTackmann, E. M. Rasel, and W. P. Schleich, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{88}, 053608\n(2013)]. We excite Rabi oscillations between the three coupled momentum states\n$\\left| 0 \\hbar k \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| \\pm 2 \\hbar k \\right\\rangle$. By\nselecting appropriate interaction times we generate highly efficient\nbeamsplitters and mirrors for Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition, we\ndemonstrate higher-order double Bragg diffraction and display beamsplitters\nwith up to $ \\pm 6 \\hbar k$ momentum transfer. We compare double Bragg\ndiffraction to several other experimental realizations of beamsplitters.\nFinally, we show that double Bragg diffraction is well suited for matter wave\ninterferometry by realizing a Ramsey-type interferometer in a quasi\none-dimensional waveguide.\n", "  Contact processes (CP's) with particle creation requiring a minimal\nneighborhood (restrictive or threshold CP's) present a novel sort of\ndiscontinuous absorbing transitions, that revealed itself robust under the\ninclusion of different ingredients, such as distinct lattice topologies,\nparticle annihilations and diffusion. Here, we tackle on the influence of\ncompetition between restrictive and standard dynamics (that describes the usual\nCP and a continuous DP transition is presented). Systems have been studied via\nmean-field theory (MFT) and numerical simulations. Results show partial\ncontrast between MFT and numerical results. While the former predicts that\nconsiderable competition rates are required to shift the phase transition, the\nlatter reveals the change occurs for rather limited (small) fractions. Thus,\nunlike previous ingredients (such as diffusion and others), limited competitive\nrates suppress the phase coexistence.\n", "  In the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers and sMDT\nchambers with half of the tube diameter of the MDTs are used for precision muon\ntrack reconstruction. The sMDT chambers are designed for operation at high\ncounting rates due to neutron and gamma background irradiation expected for the\nHL-LHC and future hadron colliders. The existing MDT read-out electronics uses\nbipolar signal shaping which causes an undershoot of opposite polarity and same\ncharge after a signal pulse. At high counting rates and short electronics dead\ntime used for the sMDTs, signal pulses pile up on the undershoot of preceding\nbackground pulses leading to a reduction of the signal amplitude and a jitter\nin the drift time measurement and, therefore, to a degradation of drift tube\nefficiency and spatial resolution. In order to further increase the rate\ncapability of sMDT tubes, baseline restoration can be used in the read-out\nelectronics to suppress the pile-up effects. A discrete bipolar shaping circuit\nwith baseline restoration has been developed and used for reading out sMDT\ntubes under irradiation with a 24 MBq 90Sr source. The measurements results\nshow a substantial improvement of the performance of the sMDT tubes at high\ncounting rates.\n", "  We present the first study of the discrete $\\beta$-function of the $ SU(3) $\ngauge theory with 10 massless domain-wall fermions in the fundamental\nrepresentation. The renormalized coupling is obtained by the finite-volume\ngradient flow scheme, and the discrete $\\beta$-function is extrapolated to the\ncontinuum limit by the step-scaling method. Our result of the discrete\n$\\beta$-function (with $ s = 2 $) suggests that this theory possesses an\ninfrared fixed point around $ g_c^2 \\sim 7.0 $ for $ c = \\sqrt{8t}/L = 0.3 $.\n", "  Context. Solar energetic particles observed in association with coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) are produced by the CME-driven shock waves. The acceleration\nof particles is considered to be due to diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\nAims. We aim at a better understanding of DSA in the case of quasi-parallel\nshocks, in which self-generated turbulence in the shock vicinity plays a key\nrole. Methods. We have developed and applied a new Monte Carlo simulation code\nfor acceleration of protons in parallel coronal shocks. The code performs a\nself-consistent calculation of resonant interactions of particles with Alfv\\'en\nwaves based on the quasi-linear theory. In contrast to the existing Monte Carlo\ncodes of DSA, the new code features the full quasi-linear resonance condition\nof particle pitch-angle scattering. This allows us to take anisotropy of\nparticle pitch-angle scattering into account, while the older codes implement\nan approximate resonance condition leading to isotropic scattering.We performed\nsimulations with the new code and with an old code, applying the same initial\nand boundary conditions, and have compared the results provided by both codes\nwith each other, and with the predictions of the steady-state theory. Results.\nWe have found that anisotropic pitch-angle scattering leads to less efficient\nacceleration of particles than isotropic. However, extrapolations to particle\ninjection rates higher than those we were able to use suggest the capability of\nDSA to produce relativistic particles. The particle and wave distributions in\nthe foreshock as well as their time evolution, provided by our new simulation\ncode, are significantly different from the previous results and from the\nsteady-state theory. Specifically, the mean free path in the simulations with\nthe new code is increasing with energy, in contrast to the theoretical result.\n", "  On Oct. 29th, 2015, the Earth crossed through a fold in the heliospheric\ncurrent sheet. This is called a \"solar sector boundary crossing\". Under this\ncircumstances, a large coronal mass ejection (CME) occurred at 2:24 UT, behind\nthe west limb on the sun. Therefore, the boundary crossing occurred when in the\nblast's nearby environment was filled with energetic particles accelerated by\nthe CME shock waves, spacecraft measurements (ACE and GOES) have shown that in\nsuch a case, protons with energies at least up to 30 MeV were stored within the\nrange of the sector boundary. Thus, a fraction of the solar energetic particles\n(SEP) from CME, reached Earth around 03:00 UT in the aftermath of the solar\nblast, reaching the condition of an S1 (minor) radiation storm level. The\neffect at ground level was a small increase in the counting rate in some ground\nbased detectors, such as the South Pole Neutron Monitor (NM) and a sharp peak\nobserved in the counting rate in the New-Tupi detector in Rio de Janeiro,\nBrazil and Thule NM. The event is being classified as a new GLE (Ground Level\nEnhancement) in the current solar cycle, as the GLE 73. However, in all cases,\nthe counting rate increase is smaller or near than 2\\%. The Earth crossed\nthrough a fold in the heliospheric current sheet also caused a geomagnetic\ndisturbance, below the minor geomagnetic storm threshold, observed in the ACE\nspacecraft and a small decrease in the counting rates of some ground level\ndetectors, such as the New-Tupi detector and Thuly NM. Details of these\nobservations are reported.\n", "  The quantum well states of a film can be used to sample the electronic\nstructure of the parent bulk material and determine its band parameters. We\nhighlight the benefits of two-dimensional film band mapping, with respect to\ncomplex bulk analysis, in an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of\nthe 5d states of Au(111). Discrete 5d-derived quantum well states of various\norbital characters form in Au(111) films and span the width of the\ncorresponding bulk bands. For sufficiently thick films, the dispersion of these\nstates samples the bulk band edges, as confirmed by first-principles\ncalculations, thus providing the positions of the critical points of bulk Au in\nagreement with previously determined values. In turn, this analysis identifies\nseveral d-like surface states and resonances with large spin-splittings that\noriginate from the strong spin-orbit coupling of the Au 5d atomic levels.\n", "  This article is intended to supplement our 2015 paper in Medical Physics\ntitled \"Noise properties of CT images reconstructed by use of constrained\ntotal-variation, data-discrepancy minimization\", in which ordered subsets\nmethods were employed to perform total-variation constrained data-discrepancy\nminimization for image reconstruction in X-ray computed tomography. Here we\nprovide details regarding implementation of the ordered subsets algorithms and\nsuggestions for selection of algorithm parameters. Detailed pseudo-code is\nincluded for every algorithm implemented in the original manuscript.\n", "  The discovery of a superconducting dome in the proximity of the magnetic to\nparamagnetic transition in the electronic phase diagram of MnP as a function of\nhydrostatic pressure has renewed the interest in the magnetic properties of\nthis binary pnictide. Here we present an ab initio study obtained with Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) simulations as a function of pressure. We show that the\nitinerant-electron magnetism of MnP is well characterized by the mean-field\nKohn-Sham method which correctly describes the ambient pressure magnetic\nstates, the anomalous trend of the lattice parameters as a function of pressure\nand the critical pressure for the disappearance of the magnetic order. We are\nfinally able to confirm the nature of the new helical structure observed at\nhigh pressure.\n", "  Close to a zero temperature transition between ordered and disordered\nelectronic phases, quantum fluctuations can lead to a strong enhancement of the\nelectron mass and to the emergence of competing phases such as\nsuperconductivity. A correlation between the existence of such a quantum phase\ntransition and superconductivity is quite well established in some heavy\nfermion and iron-based superconductors and there have been suggestions that\nhigh temperature superconductivity in the copper oxide materials (cuprates) may\nalso be driven by the same mechanism. Close to optimal doping, where the\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is maximum in the cuprates, two\ndifferent phases are known to compete with superconductivity: a poorly\nunderstood pseudogap phase and a charge ordered phase. Recent experiments have\nshown a strong increase in quasiparticle mass $m^*$ in the cuprate\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ as optimal doping is approached suggesting that\nquantum fluctuations of the charge ordered phase may be responsible for the\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity. We have tested the robustness of this correlation\nbetween $m^*$ and $T_c$ by performing quantum oscillation studies on the\nstoichiometric compound YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ under hydrostatic pressure. In\ncontrast to the results for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$, we find that in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ the mass decreases as $T_c$ increases under pressure. This\ninverse correlation between $m^*$ and $T_c$ suggests that quantum fluctuations\nof the charge order enhance $m^*$ but do not enhance $T_c$.\n", "  We report \\textit{ab initio} (LDA + U$_{sc}$) calculations of thermoelastic\nproperties of ferric iron (Fe$^{3+}$)- and aluminum (Al)-bearing bridgmanite\n(MgSiO$_3$ perovskite), the main Earth forming phase, at relevant pressure and\ntemperature conditions and compositions. Three coupled substitutions, namely,\n[Al]$_{Mg}$-[Al]$_{Si}$, [Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Mg}$-[Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$, and\n[Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Mg}$-[Al]$_{Si}$ have been investigated. Aggregate elastic moduli\nand sound velocities are successfully compared with limited experimental data\navailable. In the case of the [Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Mg}$-[Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$\nsubstitution, the high-spin (S=5/2) to low-spin (S=1/2) crossover in\n[Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$ induces a volume collapse and elastic anomalies across the\ntransition region. However, the associated anomalies should disappear in the\npresence of aluminum in the most favorable substitution, i.e.,\n[Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Mg}$-[Al]$_{Si}$. Calculated elastic properties along a lower\nmantle model geotherm suggest that the elastic behavior of bridgmanite with\nsimultaneous substitution of Fe$_{2}$O$_3$ and Al$_{2}$O$_3$ in equal\nproportions or with Al$_{2}$O$_3$ in excess should be similar to that of\n(Mg,Fe$^{2+}$)SiO$_3$ bridgmanite. Excess Fe$_{2}$O$_3$ should produce elastic\nanomalies though.\n", "  We present the results of a meeting on numerical simulations of ionized\nnebulae held at the University of Kentucky in conjunction with the celebration\nof the 70th birthdays of Profs. Donald Osterbrock and Michael Seaton.\n", "  The Rayleigh scattering of x-rays by many-electron highly charged ions is\nstudied theoretically. The many-electron perturbation theory, based on a\nrigorous quantum electrodynamics approach, is developed and implemented for the\ncase of the elastic scattering of (high-energetic) photons by helium-like ion.\nUsing this elaborate approach, we here investigate the many-electron effects\nbeyond the independent-particle approximation (IPA) as conventionally employed\nfor describing the Rayleigh scattering. The total and angle-differential cross\nsections are evaluated for the x-ray scattering by helium-like Ni$^{26+}$,\nXe$^{52+}$, and Au$^{77+}$ ions in their ground state. The obtained results\nshow that, for high-energetic photons, the effects beyond the IPA do not exceed\n2% for the scattering by a closed $K$-shell.\n", "  Transport properties in doped manganites are studied by considering the\nSimplified double exchange mechanism in the presence of diagonal disorder. It\nis modelled by a combination the Ising double exchange with Faliccov-Kimball\nmodel. In this model, charge order ferromagnetic and transport quantities are\npresented by using Dynamical mean-field theory in the case of finite Hund\ncoupling and disorder strength. Those results suggest that, within this model\nthe insulator phase can be stated in the range of below charge order\ntemperature which is suitable with the observations in the experimental\nmanganites.\n", "  A calculation of the one loop gravitational self-energy graph in\nnon-anticommutative quantum gravity reveals that graviton loops are damped by\ninternal momentum dependent factors in the modified propagator and the vertex\nfunctions. The non-anticommutative quantum gravity perturbation theory is\nfinite for matter-free gravity and for matter interactions.\n"]}
