Protons might be accelerated up\nto 0.1-100 EeV energies possibly by, e.g., the wave dissipation in the winds,\nleading to hadronic interactions in the stellar ejecta. The resulting PeV-EeV\nneutrinos can be detected by IceCube/KM3Net with a typical peak time scale of a\nfew days after the birth of magnetars, making the characteristic soft-hard-soft\nbehavior. Detections would be important as a clue to the formation mechanism of\nmagnetars, although there are ambiguities coming from uncertainties of several\nparameters such as velocity of the ejecta. Non-detections would also lead to\nuseful constraints on the scenario.\n", "  It is crucial to identify the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) sources and\nprobe their unknown properties. Recent results from the Pierre Auger\nObservatory favor a heavy nuclear composition for the UHECRs. Under the\nrequirement that heavy nuclei survive in these sources, using gamma-ray bursts\nas an example, we predict a diagnostic gamma-ray signal, unique to nuclei - the\nemission of de-excitation gamma rays following photodisintegration. These gamma\nrays, boosted from MeV to TeV-PeV energies, may be detectable by gamma-ray\ntelescopes such as VERITAS, HESS, and MAGIC, and especially the next-generation\nCTA and AGIS. They are a promising messenger to identify and study individual\nUHE nuclei accelerators.\n", "  Motivated by Pierre Auger Observatory results favoring a heavy nuclear\ncomposition for ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays, we investigate implications\nfor the cumulative neutrino background. The requirement that nuclei not be\nphotodisintegrated constrains their interactions in sources, therefore limiting\nneutrino production via photomeson interactions. Assuming a $dN_{\\rm\nCR}/dE_{\\rm CR} \\propto E_{\\rm CR}^{-2}$ injection spectrum and\nphotodisintegration via the giant dipole resonance, the background flux of\nneutrinos is lower than $E_\\nu^2 \\Phi_\\nu \\sim {10}^{-9} {\\rm GeV} {\\rm\ncm}^{-2} {\\rm s}^{-1} {\\rm sr}^{-1}$ if UHE nuclei ubiquitously survive in\ntheir sources. This is smaller than the analogous Waxman-Bahcall flux for UHE\nprotons by about one order of magnitude, and is below the projected IceCube\nsensitivity. If IceCube detects a neutrino background, it could be due to other\nsources, e.g., hadronuclear interactions of lower-energy cosmic rays; if it\ndoes not, this supports our strong restrictions on the properties of sources of\nUHE nuclei.\n", "  We derive refined rigorous error estimates for approximate solutions of\nSturm-Liouville and Riccati equations with real or complex potentials. The\napproximate solutions include WKB approximations, Airy and parabolic cylinder\nfunctions, and certain Bessel functions. Our estimates are applied to solutions\nof the angular Teukolsky equation with a complex aspherical parameter in a\nrotating black hole Kerr geometry.\n", "  We study the sunset graph defined as the scalar two-point self-energy at\ntwo-loop order. We evaluate the sunset integral for all identical internal\nmasses in two dimensions. We give two calculations for the sunset amplitude;\none based on an interpretation of the amplitude as an inhomogeneous solution of\na classical Picard-Fuchs differential equation, and the other using arithmetic\nalgebraic geometry, motivic cohomology, and Eisenstein series. Both methods use\nthe rather special fact that the amplitude in this case is a family of periods\nassociated to the universal family of elliptic curves over the modular curve\nX_1(6). We show that the integral is given by an elliptic dilogarithm evaluated\nat a sixth root of unity modulo periods. We explain as well how this elliptic\ndilogarithm value is related to the regulator of a class in the motivic\ncohomology of the universal elliptic family.\n", "  The role of Coulomb disorder is analysed in the Anderson-Falicov-Kimball\nmodel. Phase diagrams of correlated and disordered electron systems are\ncalculated within dynamical mean-field theory applied to the Bethe lattice, in\nwhich metal-insulator transitions led by structural and Coulomb disorders and\ncorrelation can be identified. Metallic, Mott insulator, and Anderson insulator\nphases, as well as the crossover between them are studied in this perspective.\nWe show that Coulomb disorder has a relevant role in the phase-transition\nbehavior as the system is led towards the insulator regime.\n", "  We describe a new regime for low-field magnetoresistance in organic\nsemiconductors, in which the spin-relaxing effects of localized nuclear spins\nand electronic spins interfere. The regime is studied by the controlled\naddition of localized electronic spins to a material that exhibits substantial\nroom-temperature magnetoresistance ($\\sim 20$\\%). Although initially the\nmagnetoresistance is suppressed by the doping, at intermediate doping there is\na regime where the magnetoresistance is insensitive to the doping level. For\nmuch greater doping concentrations the magnetoresistance is fully suppressed.\nThe behavior is described within a theoretical model describing the effect of\ncarrier spin dynamics on the current.\n", "  Focused MeV ion beams with micrometric resolution are suitable tools for the\ndirect writing of conductive graphitic channels buried in an insulating diamond\nbulk. Their effectiveness has been shown for the fabrication of multi-electrode\nionizing radiation detectors and cellular biosensors. In this work we\ninvestigate such fabrication method for the electrical excitation of color\ncenters in diamond. Differently from optically-stimulated light emission from\ncolor centers in diamond, electroluminescence (EL) requires a high current\nflowing in the diamond subgap states between the electrodes. With this purpose,\nburied graphitic electrode pairs with a spacing of 10 $\\mu$m were fabricated in\nthe bulk of a single-crystal diamond sample using a 6 MeV C microbeam. The\nelectrical characterization of the structure showed a significant current above\nan effective voltage threshold of 150V, which was interpreted according to the\ntheory of Space Charge Limited Current. The EL imaging allowed to identify the\nelectroluminescent regions and the residual vacancy distribution associated\nwith the fabrication technique. Measurements evidenced bright\nelectroluminescent emission from native neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters ($NV^0$); the acquired spectra highlighted the absence of EL associated\nwith radiation damage.\n", "  The Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein-pigment complex acts as a molecular\nwire between the outer antenna system and the reaction center (RC); it is an\nimportant model system to study the excitonic energy transfer. Recent\ncrystallographic studies report the existence of an additional (eighth)\nbacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a). To understand the functionality of this eighth\nBChl, we simulated the two-dimensional electronic spectra of both the 7-site\n(apo form) and the 8-site (holo form) variant of the FMO complex from green\nsulfur bacteria, Prosthecochloris aestuarii. By comparing the difference\nbetween the spectrum, it was found that the eighth BChl can affect two\ndifferent excitonic energy transfer pathways, these being: (1) directly involve\nin the first pathway 6 $\\rightarrow$ 3 $\\rightarrow$ 1 of the apo form model by\npassing the excitonic energy to exciton 6; and (2) increase the excitonic wave\nfunction overlap between excitons 4 and 5 in the second pathway (7\n$\\rightarrow$ 4,5 $\\rightarrow$ 2 $\\rightarrow$ 1) and thus increase the\npossible downward sampling routes across the BChls.\n", "  Epstein and Plesset's seminal work on the rate of gas bubble dissolution and\ngrowth in a simple liquid is generalized to render it applicable to a gas\nbubble embedded in a soft elastic medium. Both the underlying diffusion\nequation and the expression for the gas bubble pressure were modified to allow\nfor the non-zero shear modulus of the elastic medium. The extension of the\ndiffusion equation results in a trivial shift (by an additive constant) in the\nvalue of the diffusion coefficient, and does not change the form of the rate\nequations. But the use of a Generalized Young-Laplace equation for the bubble\npressure resulted in significant differences on the dynamics of bubble\ndissolution and growth, relative to a simple liquid medium. Depending on\nwhether the salient parameters (solute concentration, initial bubble radius,\nsurface tension, and shear modulus) lead to bubble growth or dissolution, the\neffect of allowing for a non-zero shear modulus in the Generalized\nYoung-Laplace equation is to speed up the rate of bubble growth, or to reduce\nthe rate of bubble dissolution, respectively. The relation to previous work on\nvisco-elastic materials is discussed, as is the connection of this work to the\nproblem of Decompression Sickness (specifically, \"the bends\"). Examples of\ntissues to which our expressions can be applied are provided. Also, a new\nphenomenon is predicted whereby, for some parameter values, a bubble can be\nmetastable and persist for long times, or it may grow, when embedded in a\nhomogeneous under-saturated soft elastic medium.\n", "  We argue that the non-adiabatic evolution of spin states in Stern-Gerlach\napparatus can blur the manifestation of path spin entanglement. This fact\nintroduces a contradiction to the usual perception of spin measurement even in\na formally ideal situation. Through quantitative calculation, we have pointed\nout the specific reason behind the breakdown of adiabatic evolution to be the\nspatial inhomogeneity of applied magnetic field. The angle $\\theta$ between the\n$z$ component of magnetic moment of the particle and applied magnetic field is\nalso a determining factor for the category of evolution of spin states.\nAdiabaticity always can be restored by choosing a sufficiently small value of\n$\\theta$. Considering azimuthal inhomogeneity, we have examined the nature of\npath spin entanglement in the context of Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n", "  Recent measurements at LHC has inspired searches for TeV scale left-right\ngauge theory originating from grand unified theories. We show that inclusion of\nPlanck-scale induced effects due to ${\\rm dim.}5$ operator not only does away\nwith all the additional intermediate symmetries, but also it predicts the\nminimal set of light Higgs scalars tailored after neutrino masses and dilepton,\nor trilepton signals. The heavy-light neutrino mixings are predicted from\ncharged fermion mass fits in $SO(10)$ and LFV constraints which lead to new\npredictions for dilepton or trilepton production signals. Including\nfine-structure constant matching and two-loop, and threshold effects predicts\n$M_{W_R}= g_{2R}\\times 10^{4.3\\pm 1.5 \\pm 0.2}$ GeV and proton lifetime\n$\\tau_p=10^{36.15\\pm 5.8\\pm 0.2}$ yrs with $W_R$ gauge boson coupling\n$g_{2R}=0.56-0.57$. Predictions on lepton flavour and lepton number violations\nare accessible to ongoing experiments. Current CMS data on di-electron excess\nat $\\sqrt s= 8$ TeV are found to be consistent with $W_R$ gauge boson mass\n$M_{W_R}\\ge 1.9-2.2$ TeV which also agrees with the values obtained from dijet\nresonance production data. We also discuss plausible explanations for diboson\nproduction excesses observed at LHC and make predictions expected at $\\sqrt s\n=14$ TeV\n", "  We start from known solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation with a spectral\nparameter defined on the tensor product of two infinite-dimensional principal\nseries representations of the group $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ or Faddeev's\nmodular double. Then we describe its restriction to an irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representation in one or both spaces. In this way we obtain\nvery simple explicit formulas embracing rational and trigonometric\nfinite-dimensional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Finally, we construct\nthese finite-dimensional solutions by means of the fusion procedure and find a\nnice agreement between two approaches.\n", "  In this paper, we study the effects of polynomial $f(R)$ model on the\nstability of homogeneous energy density in self-gravitating spherical stellar\nobject. For this purpose, we construct couple of evolution equations which\nrelate the Weyl tensor with matter parameters. We explore different factors\nresponsible for density inhomogeneities with non-dissipative dust, isotropic as\nwell as anisotropic fluids and dissipative dust cloud. We find that shear,\npressure, dissipative parameters and $f(R)$ terms affect the existence of\ninhomogeneous energy density.\n", "  Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of the unpaired electron in\nsodium-doped water, methanol, ammonia, and dimethyl ether clusters is\npresented. The experimental observations and the complementary calculations are\nconsistent with surface electrons for the cluster size range studied. Evidence\nagainst internally solvated electrons is provided by the photoelectron angular\ndistribution. The trends in the ionization energies seem mainly determined by\nthe degree of hydrogen bonding in the solvent and the solvation of the ion\ncore. The onset ionization energies of water and methanol clusters do not level\noff at small cluster sizes, but decrease slightly with increasing cluster size.\n", "  We study the inflationary evolution of a scalar field $h$ with an unstable\npotential for the case where the Hubble parameter $H$ during inflation is\nlarger than the instability scale $\\Lambda_I$ of the potential. Quantum\nfluctuations in the field of size $\\delta h \\sim \\frac{H}{2 \\pi}$ imply that\nthe unstable part of the potential is sampled during inflation. We investigate\nthe evolution of these fluctuations to the unstable regime, and in particular\nwhether they generate cosmological defects or even terminate inflation. We\napply the results of a toy scalar model to the case of the Standard Model (SM)\nHiggs boson, whose quartic evolves to negative values at high scales, and\nextend previous analyses of Higgs dynamics during inflation utilizing\nstatistical methods to a perturbative and fully gauge-invariant formulation. We\nshow that the dynamics are controlled by the renormalization group-improved\nquartic coupling $\\lambda(\\mu)$ evaluated at a scale $\\mu = H$, such that Higgs\nfluctuations are enhanced by the instability if $H > \\Lambda_I$. Even if $H >\n\\Lambda_I$, the instability in the SM Higgs potential does not end inflation;\ninstead the universe slowly sloughs off crunching patches of space that never\ncome to dominate the evolution. As inflation proceeds past 50 $e$-folds, a\nsignificant proportion of patches exit inflation in the unstable vacuum, and as\nmuch as 1% of the spacetime can rapidly evolve to a defect. Depending on the\nnature of these defects, however, the resulting universe could still be\ncompatible with ours.\n", "  Light dark-matter ($M\\leq20$ MeV) particles freeze out after neutrino\ndecoupling. If the dark-matter particle couples to a neutrino or an\nelectromagnetic plasma, the late time entropy production from dark-matter\nannihilation can change the neutrino-to-photon temperature ratio, and equally\nthe effective number of neutrinos $N_{eff}$. We study the non-equilibrium\neffects of dark-matter annihilation on the $N_{eff}$ and the effects by using a\nthermal equilibrium approximation. Both results are constrained with Planck\nobservations. We demonstrate that the lower bounds of the dark-matter mass and\nthe possibilities of the existence of additional radiation particles are more\nstrongly constrained for dark-matter annihilation process in non-equilibrium.\n", "  Internal line shifts in quasars spectra have played a more prominent role in\nour understanding of quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different\nredshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of\nquasars. We have argued that the broad hydrogen lines, as well as the\nlow-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov\nquasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets\n($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{14}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$); whereas this line-like radiation\nmechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to\naccount for redshift difference, the Cerenkov line-like radiation mechanism\ncould provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which\nis different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among\nLy$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines. The different redshifts among\ndifferent broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively\nsupport that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the\nreal line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to\nthe observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component\nin the broad hydrogen lines, which indicates that, in the blended Ly$\\alpha$\nline, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of\nthe accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity\nbetween the two components in the broad Ly$\\alpha$ line). This result\nillustrates the importance of the Cerenkov component in the broad lines of\nquasars, which can be further confirmed by future observations.\n", "  We describe a novel analogue algorithm that allows the simultaneous\nfactorization of an exponential number of large integers with a polynomial\nnumber of experimental runs. It is the interference-induced periodicity of\n\"factoring\" interferograms measured at the output of an analogue computer that\nallows the selection of the factors of each integer [1,2,3,4]. At the present\nstage the algorithm manifests an exponential scaling which may be overcome by\nan extension of this method to correlated qubits emerging from n-order quantum\ncorrelations measurements. We describe the conditions for a generic physical\nsystem to compute such an analogue algorithm. A particular example given by an\n\"optical computer\" based on optical interference will be addressed in the\nsecond paper of this series [5].\n", "  We report a detailed analysis of the optical realization [1, 3, 2, 4] of the\nanalogue algorithm described in the first paper of this series [5] for the\nsimultaneous factorization of an exponential number of integers. Such an\nanalogue procedure, which scales exponentially in the context of first order\ninterference, opens up the horizon to polynomial scaling by exploiting\nmulti-particle quantum interference.\n", "  In this article we present and compare two different, coarse-grained\napproaches to model electrostatic interactions of disc-shaped aromatic\nmolecules, specifically coronene. Our study builds on previous work [J. Chem.\nPhys. 141, 214110 (2014)] where we proposed, based on a systematic\ncoarse-graining procedure starting from the atomistic level, an anisotropic\neffective (Gay-Berne-like) potential capable of describing van-der-Waals\ncontributions to the interaction energy. To take into account electrostatics,\nwe introduce, first, a linear quadrupole moment along the symmetry axis of the\ncoronene disc. The second approach takes into account the fact that the partial\ncharges within the molecules are distributed in a ring-like fashion. We then\nreparametrize the effective Gay-Berne-like potential such that it matches, at\nshort distances, the ring-ring potential. To investigate the validity of these\ntwo approaches, we perform many-particle Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations,\nfocusing on the crystalline phase (karpatite) where electrostatic interaction\neffects are expected to be particularly relevant for the formation of tilted\nstacked columns. Specifically, we investigate various structural parameters as\nwell as the melting transition. We find that the second approach yields\nconsistent results with those from experiments despite the fact that the\nunderlying potential decays with the wrong distance dependence at large\nmolecule separations. Our strategy can be transferred to a broader class of\nmolecules, such as benzene or hexabenzocoronene.\n", "  Entropy barriers and ageing states appear in martensitic\nstructural-transition models, slowly re-equilibrating after temperature\nquenches, under Monte Carlo dynamics. Concepts from protein folding and ageing\nharmonic oscillators turn out to be useful in understanding these\nnonequilibrium evolutions. We show how the athermal, non-activated delay time\nfor seeded parent-phase austenite to convert to product-phase martensite,\narises from an identified entropy barrier in Fourier space. In an ageing state\nof low Monte Carlo acceptances, the strain structure factor makes\nconstant-energy searches for rare pathways, to enter a Brillouin zone `golf\nhole' enclosing negative energy states, and to suddenly release entropically\ntrapped stresses. In this context, a stress-dependent effective temperature can\nbe defined, that re-equilibrates to the quenched bath temperature.\n", "  Let $S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$ be a $C^4$-smooth relatively compact orientable\nsurface with a sufficiently regular boundary. For $\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$, let\n$E_j(\\beta)$ denote the $j$th negative eigenvalue of the operator associated\nwith the quadratic form \\[ H^1(\\mathbb{R}^3)\\ni u\\mapsto \\iiint_{\\mathbb{R}^3}\n|\\nabla u|^2dx -\\beta \\iint_S |u|^2d\\sigma, \\] where $\\sigma$ is the\ntwo-dimensional Hausdorff measure on $S$. We show that for each fixed $j$ one\nhas the asymptotic expansion \\[ E_j(\\beta)=-\\dfrac{\\beta^2}{4}+\\mu^D_j+ o(1)\n\\;\\text{ as }\\; \\beta\\to+\\infty\\,, \\] where $\\mu_j^D$ is the $j$th eigenvalue\nof the operator $-\\Delta_S+K-M^2$ on $L^2(S)$, in which $K$ and $M$ are the\nGauss and mean curvatures, respectively, and $-\\Delta_S$ is the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator with the Dirichlet condition at the boundary of $S$.\nIf, in addition, the boundary of $S$ is $C^2$-smooth, then the remainder\nestimate can be improved to ${\\mathcal O}(\\beta^{-1}\\log\\beta)$.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenological viability of a recently proposed class of\ncomposite dark matter models where the relic density is determined by 3 to 2\nnumber-changing processes in the dark sector. Here the pions of the strongly\ninteracting field theory constitute the dark matter particles. By performing a\nconsistent next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading order chiral\nperturbative investigation we demonstrate that the leading order analysis\ncannot be used to draw conclusions about the viability of the model. We further\nshow that higher order corrections substantially increase the tension with\nphenomenological constraints challenging the viability of the simplest\nrealisation of the strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) paradigm.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and characterization of a single-crystal diamond\ndevice for the electrical stimula- tion of light emission from nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV0) and other defect-related centers. Pairs of sub-superficial graphitic\nmicro-electrodes embedded in insulating diamond were fabricated by a 6 MeV C3+\nmicro-beam irra- diation followed by thermal annealing. A photoluminescence\n(PL) characterization evidenced a low radiation damage concentration in the\ninter-electrode gap region, which did not significantly affect the PL features\ndomi- nated by NV centers. The operation of the device in electroluminescence\n(EL) regime was investigated by ap- plying a bias voltage at the graphitic\nelectrodes, resulting in the injection of a high excitation current above a\nthreshold voltage (~300V), which effectively stimulated an intense EL emission\nfrom NV0 centers. In addition, we report on the new observation of two\nadditional sharp EL emission lines (at 563 nm and 580 nm) related to\ninterstitial defects formed during MeV ion beam fabrication.\n", "  We study a two-parameter extension of the cosmological standard model\n$\\Lambda$CDM in which cold dark matter interacts with a new form of dark\nradiation. The two parameters correspond to the energy density in the dark\nradiation fluid $\\Delta N_\\mathrm{fluid}$ and the interaction strength between\ndark matter and dark radiation. The interactions give rise to a very weak \"dark\nmatter drag\" which damps the growth of matter density perturbations throughout\nradiation domination, allowing to reconcile the tension between predictions of\nlarge scale structure from the CMB and direct measurements of $\\sigma_8$. We\nperform a precision fit to Planck CMB data, BAO, large scale structure, and\ndirect measurements of the expansion rate of the universe today. Our model\nlowers the $\\chi$-squared relative to $\\Lambda$CDM by about 12, corresponding\nto a preference for non-zero dark matter drag by more than $3 \\sigma$. Particle\nphysics models which naturally produce a dark matter drag of the required form\ninclude the recently proposed non-Abelian dark matter model in which the dark\nradiation corresponds to massless dark gluons.\n", "  Assuming a non-paraxial propagation operator, we study the propagation of an\nelectromagnetic field with an arbitrary initial condition in a quadratic GRIN\nmedium. We show that at certain specific periodic distances, the propagated\nfield is given by the fractional Fourier transform of a superposition of the\ninitial field and of a reflected version of it. We also prove that for\nparticular wavelengths, there is a revival and a splitting of the initial\nfield. We apply this results, first to an initial field given by a Bessel\nfunction and show that it splits into two generalized Bessel functions, and\nsecond, to an Airy function. In both cases our results are compared with the\nexact numerical ones.\n", "  A family of spectral decompositions of the spin-weighted spheroidal wave\noperator is constructed for complex aspherical parameters with bounded\nimaginary part. As the operator is not symmetric, its spectrum is complex and\nJordan chains may appear. We prove uniform upper bounds for the length of the\nJordan chains and the norms of the idempotent operators mapping onto the\ninvariant subspaces. The completeness of the spectral decomposition is proven.\n", "  Quantum repeaters promise to enable quantum networks over global distances by\ncircumventing the exponential decrease in success probability inherent in\ndirect photon transmission. We propose a realistic, functionally integrated\nquantum repeater implementation based on single atoms in optical cavities.\nEntanglement is directly generated between the single-atom quantum memory and a\nphoton at telecom wavelength. The latter is collected with high efficiency and\nadjustable temporal and spectral properties into a spatially well-defined\ncavity mode. It is heralded by a near-infrared photon emitted from a second,\northogonal cavity. Entanglement between two remote quantum memories can be\ngenerated via an optical Bell-state measurement, while we propose entanglement\nswapping based on a highly efficient, cavity-assisted atom-atom gate. Our\nquantum repeater scheme eliminates any requirement for wavelength conversion\nsuch that only a single system is needed at each node. We investigate a\nparticular implementation with rubidium and realistic parameters for\nFabry-Perot cavities based on CO$_2$ laser-machined optical fibers. We show\nthat the scheme enables the implementation of a rather simple quantum repeater\nthat outperforms direct entanglement generation over large distances and does\nnot require any improvements in technology beyond the state of the art.\n", "  In this work we show how the inclusion of dark matter (DM) direct detection\nupper bounds in a theoretically consistent manner can affect the allowed\nparameter space of a DM model. Traditionally, the limits from DM direct\ndetection experiments on the elastic scattering cross section of DM particles\nas a function of their mass are extracted under simplifying assumptions.\nRelaxing the assumptions related to the DM particle nature, such as the neutron\nto proton ratio of the interactions, or the possibility of having similar\ncontributions from the spin independent (SI) and spin dependent (SD)\ninteractions can vary significantly the upper limits. Furthermore, it is known\nthat astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties can also affect the upper bounds.\nTo exemplify the impact of properly including all these factors, we have\nanalysed two well motivated and popular DM scenarios: neutralinos in the NMSSM\nand a Z' portal with Dirac DM. We have found that the allowed parameter space\nof these models is subject to important variations when one includes both the\nSI and SD interactions at the same time, realistic neutron to proton ratios, as\nwell as using different self-consistent speed distributions corresponding to\npopular DM halo density profiles, and distinct SD structure functions. Finally,\nwe provide all the necessary information to include the upper bounds of\nSuperCDMS and LUX taking into account all these subtleties in the investigation\nof any particle physics model. The data for each experiment and example codes\nare available at this site http://goo.gl/1CDFYi, and their use is detailed in\nthe appendices of this work.\n", "  To study the decays of $\\psi(3770)$ going to baryon anti-baryon pairs\n($B\\bar{B}$), all available experiments of measuring the cross sections of\n$e^+e^- \\to B\\bar{B}$ at center-of-mass energy ranging from 3.0 GeV to 3.9 GeV\nare combined. To relate the baryon octets, a model based on the SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry is used and the SU(3) breaking effects are also considered. Assuming\nthe elctric and magnetic form factors are equal ($|G_E|=|G_M|$), a global fit\nincluding the interference between the QED process and the resonant process is\nperformed. The branching fraction of $\\psi(3770) \\to B\\bar{B}$ is determined to\nbe $(2.4\\pm0.8\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-5}$, $(1.7\\pm0.6\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-5}$,\n$(4.5\\pm0.9\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-5}$, $(4.5\\pm0.9\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-5}$,\n$(2.0\\pm0.7\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-5}$, and $(2.0\\pm0.7\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-5}$ for\n$B=p, \\Lambda, \\Sigma^+, \\Sigma^0, \\Xi^-$ and $\\Xi^0$, respectively, where the\nfirst uncertainty is from the global fit and the second uncertainty is the\nsystematic uncertainty due to the assumption $|G_E|=|G_M|$. They are at least\none order of magnitude larger than a simple scaling of the branching fraction\nof $J/\\psi\\to B\\bar{B}$.\n", "  Let $\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ be a non-closed piecewise-$C^1$ curve, which\nis either bounded with two free endpoints or unbounded with one free endpoint.\nLet $u_\\pm|_\\Lambda \\in L^2(\\Lambda)$ be the traces of a function $u$ in the\nSobolev space $H^1({\\mathbb R}^2\\setminus \\Lambda)$ onto two faces of\n$\\Lambda$. We prove that for a wide class of shapes of $\\Lambda$ the\nSchr\\\"odinger operator $\\mathsf{H}_\\omega^\\Lambda$ with\n$\\delta^\\prime$-interaction supported on $\\Lambda$ of strength $\\omega \\in\nL^\\infty(\\Lambda;\\mathbb{R})$ associated with the quadratic form \\[\nH^1(\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus\\Lambda)\\ni u \\mapsto \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2}\\big|\\nabla u\n\\big|^2 \\mathsf{d} x\n  - \\int_\\Lambda \\omega \\big| u_+|_\\Lambda - u_-|_\\Lambda \\big|^2 \\mathsf{d} s\n\\] has no negative spectrum provided that $\\omega$ is pointwise majorized by a\nstrictly positive function explicitly expressed in terms of $\\Lambda$. If,\nadditionally, the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus\\Lambda$ is quasi-conical, we\nshow that $\\sigma(\\mathsf{H}_\\omega^\\Lambda) = [0,+\\infty)$. For a bounded\ncurve $\\Lambda$ in our class and non-varying interaction strength\n$\\omega\\in\\mathbb{R}$ we derive existence of a constant $\\omega_* > 0$ such\nthat $\\sigma(\\mathsf{H}_\\omega^\\Lambda) = [0,+\\infty)$ for all $\\omega \\in\n(-\\infty, \\omega_*]$; informally speaking, bound states are absent in the weak\ncoupling regime.\n", "  We demonstrate a gain-switched thulium fiber laser that can be continuously\ntuned over 140 nm, while maintaining stable nanosecond single-pulse operation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this system represents the broadest tuning range\nfor a gain-switched fiber laser. The system simplicity and wideband wavelength\ntunability combined with the ability to control the temporal characteristics of\nthe gain-switched pulses mean this is a versatile source highly suited to a\nwide range of applications in the eye-safe region of the infrared, including\nspectroscopy, sensing and material processing, as well as being a practical\nseed source for pumping nonlinear processes.\n", "  Quantum superposition is central to quantum theory but challenges our\nconcepts of reality and spacetime when applied to macroscopic objects like\nSchr\\\"odinger's cat. For that reason, it has been a long-standing question\nwhether quantum physics remains valid unmodified even for truly macroscopic\nobjects. By now, the predictions of quantum theory have been confirmed via\nmatter-wave interferometry for massive objects up to $10^4\\,$ atomic mass units\n(amu). The rapid development of new technologies promises to soon allow tests\nof quantum theory for significantly higher test masses by using novel\ntechniques of quantum optomechanics and high-mass matter-wave interferometry.\nSuch experiments may yield novel insights into the foundations of quantum\ntheory, pose stringent limits on alternative theoretical models or even uncover\ndeviations from quantum physics. However, performing experiments of this type\non Earth may soon face principal limitations due to requirements of long times\nof flight, ultra-low vibrations, and extremely high vacuum. Here, we present a\nshort overview of recent developments towards the implementation of the\nproposed space-mission MAQRO, which promises to overcome those limitations and\nto perform matter-wave interferometry in a parameter regime orders of magnitude\nbeyond state-of-the-art.\n", "  The latest IceCube data suggest that the all-flavor cosmic neutrino flux may\nbe as large as 10^-7 GeV/cm^2/s/sr around 30 TeV. We show that, if sources of\nthe TeV-PeV neutrinos are transparent to gamma rays with respect to two-photon\nannihilation, strong tensions with the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background\nmeasured by Fermi are unavoidable, independently of the production mechanism.\nWe further show that, if the IceCube neutrinos have a photohadronic (pgamma)\norigin, the sources are expected to be opaque to 1-100 GeV gamma rays. With\nthese general multimessenger arguments, we find that the latest data suggest a\npopulation of cosmic-ray accelerators hidden in GeV-TeV gamma rays as a\nneutrino origin. Searches for x-ray and MeV gamma-ray counterparts are\nencouraged, and TeV-PeV neutrinos themselves will serve as special probes of\ndense source environments.\n", "  We explore theoretically the physics of dynamic hysteresis for\ndriven-dissipative nonlinear photonic resonators. In the regime where the\nsemiclassical mean-field theory predicts bistability, the exact steady-state\ndensity matrix is known to be unique, being a statistical mixture of two\nstates: in particular, no static hysteresis cycle of the excited population\noccurs as a function of the driving intensity. Here, we predict that in the\nquantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when\nsweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a\nfunction of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior\nqualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis\npower-law in the slow sweep limit defines a characteristic time, which depends\ndramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning\nbetween the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the\ncharacteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters\ndue to multiphotonic resonances. We show that the dynamic hysteresis for the\nconsidered class of driven-dissipative systems is due to a non-adiabatic\nresponse region with connections to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for quenched\nphase transitions. We also consider the case of two coupled driven-dissipative\nnonlinear resonators, showing that dynamic hysteresis and power-law behavior\noccur also in presence of correlations between resonators. Our theoretical\npredictions can be explored in a broad variety of physical systems, e.g.,\ncircuit QED superconducting resonators and semiconductor optical microcavities.\n", "  The CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has reported a 2.8$\\sigma$\nexcess in the $(2e)(2jets)$ channel around 2.1 TeV. Interpretation of this data\nis reconsidered in terms of the production of a right-handed weak gauge boson,\n$W_R$, of the left-right symmetric model and in an $SO(10)$ grand unified\ntheory abiding by the Extended Survival Hypothesis. The left-right symmetric\nmodel can be consistent with this excess if (a) the heavy right-handed neutrino\nhas a mass near $W_R$, or (b) if $g_L \\neq g_R$, or (c) the right-handed CKM\nmatrix is nontrivial. Combinations of the above possibilities are also viable.\nA $W_R$ with a mass in the TeV region if embedded in $SO(10)$ is not compatible\nwith $g_L = g_R$. Rather, it implies $0.64 \\leq g_R/g_L \\leq 0.78$. Further, a\nunique symmetry-breaking route -- the order being left-right discrete symmetry\nbreaking first, followed by $SU(4)_C$ and finally $SU(2)_R$ -- to the standard\nmodel is picked out. The $L \\leftrightarrow R$ discrete symmetry has to be\nbroken at around $10^{16}$ GeV. The grand unification scale is pushed to\n$10^{18}$ GeV making the detection of proton decay in ongoing searches rather\nunlikely. The $SU(4)_C$ breaking scale can be at its allowed lower limit of\n$10^6$ GeV so that $n - \\bar{n}$ oscillation or flavour changing processes such\nas $K_L \\rightarrow \\mu e$ and $B_{d,s} \\rightarrow \\mu e$ may be detectable.\nThe Higgs scalar multiplets responsible for $SO(10)$ symmetry breaking at\nvarious stages are uniquely identified so long as one adheres to a minimalist\nprinciple. We also remark, {\\em en passant}, about a partially unified\nPati-Salam model.\n", "  We propose an experimentally accessible scheme to determine lower bounds on\nthe quantum Fisher information (QFI), which ascertains multipartite\nentanglement or usefulness for quantum metrology. The scheme is based on\ncomparing the measurement statistics of a state before and after a small\nunitary rotation. We argue that, in general, limited resolution of collective\nobservables prevents the detection of large QFI. This can be overcome by\nperforming an additional operation prior to the measurement. We illustrate the\npower of this protocol for present-day spin-squeezing experiments, where the\nsame operation used for the preparation of the initial spin-squeezed state\nimproves the lower bound on the QFI by two orders of magnitude. We also\nestablish a connection to Leggett-Garg inequalities. We show how to simulate a\nvariant of the inequalities with our protocol and demonstrate that a large QFI\nis necessary for their violation with coarse-grained detectors.\n", "  The integration of large shares of electricity produced by non-dispatchable\nRenewable Energy Sources (RES) leads to an increasingly volatile energy\ngeneration side, with temporary local overproduction. The application of energy\nstorage units has the potential to use this excess electricity from RES\nefficiently and to prevent curtailment. The objective of this work is to\ncalculate cost-optimal charging strategies for energy storage units used as\nbuffers. For this purpose, a new mathematical optimization method is presented\nthat is applicable to general storage-related problems. Due to a tremendous\ngain in efficiency of this method compared with standard solvers and proven\noptimality, calculations of complex problems as well as a high-resolution\nsensitivity analysis of multiple system combinations are feasible within a very\nshort time. As an example technology, Power-to-Heat converters used in\ncombination with thermal storage units are investigated in detail and optimal\nsystem configurations, including storage units with and without energy losses,\nare calculated and evaluated. The benefits of a problem-specific approach are\ndemonstrated by the mathematical simplicity of our approach as well as the\ngeneral applicability of the proposed method.\n", "  We propose a novel method of evaluating the effective action, wherein the\nphysical one- and two-point functions are obtained in the limit of\nnon-vanishing external sources. We illustrate the self-consistency of this\nmethod by recovering the usual 2PI effective action due to Cornwall, Jackiw and\nTomboulis, differing only by the fact that the saddle-point evaluation of the\npath integral is performed along the extremal quantum, rather than classical,\npath. As such, this approach is of particular relevance to situations where the\ndominant quantum and classical paths are non-perturbatively far away from\none-another. A pertinent example is the decay of false vacua in\nradiatively-generated potentials, as may occur for the electroweak vacuum of\nthe Standard Model. In addition, we describe how the external sources may\ninstead be chosen so as to yield the two-particle-point-irreducible (2PPI)\neffective action of Coppens and Verschelde. Finally, in the spirit of the\nsymmetry-improved effective action of Pilaftsis and Teresi, we give an example\nof how the external sources can be used to preserve global symmetries in\ntruncations of the 2PI effective action. Specifically, in the context of an\nO(2) model with spontaneous symmetry breaking, we show that this approach\nallows the Hartree-Fock approximation to be re-organized, such that the\nGoldstone boson remains massless algebraically in the symmetry-broken phase and\nwe obtain the correct second-order thermal phase transition.\n", "  Eternal inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We focus on\ndifferent tools to analyze the effects of dissipation and the presence of a\nthermal radiation bath on the fluctuation-dominated regime, for which the\nself-reproduction of Hubble regions can take place. The tools we explore are\nthe threshold inflaton field and threshold number of e-folds necessary to\nestablish a self-reproduction regime and the counting of Hubble regions, using\ngeneralized conditions for the occurrence of a fluctuation-dominated regime. We\nobtain the functional dependence of these quantities on the dissipation and\ntemperature. A Sturm-Liouville analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation for the\nprobability of having eternal inflation and an analysis for the probability of\nhaving eternal points are performed. We have considered the representative\ncases of inflation models with monomial potentials of the form of chaotic and\nhilltop ones. Our results show that warm inflation tends to initially favor the\nonset of a self-reproduction regime for smaller values of the dissipation. As\nthe dissipation increases, it becomes harder than in cold inflation (i.e., in\nthe absence of dissipation) to achieve a self-reproduction regime for both\ntypes of models analyzed. The results are interpreted and explicit analytical\nexpressions are given whenever that is possible.\n", "  The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is designed for high\nenergy gamma ray and cosmic ray detection. A Water Cherenkov Detector Array\nwhich is sensitive to gamma ray showers above a few hundred GeV is proposed to\nsurvey gamma ray sources. The WCDA consists of 3600 PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMT)\nwhich collect the Cherenkov light produced by the shower particles in water.\nBoth high precision time and charge measurement are required over a large\ndynamic range from 1 photo electron (P.E.) to 4000 P.E. Prototype of an\nanalogue front-end Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) fabricated in\nChartered 0.35 {\\mu}m CMOS technology is designed to read out PMT signal in the\nWCDA. This ASIC employs leading edge discrimination and RC4 shaping structure;\ncombined with the following Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) and\nAnalog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), both the arrival time and charge of the PMT\nsignal can be measured. Initial test results indicate that time resolution is\nbetter than 350 ps and charge resolution is better than 10% at 1 P.E. and\nbetter than 1% with large input signals (300 P.E. to 4000 P.E.). Besides, this\nASIC has a small channel-to-channel crosstalk and low ambient temperature\ndependency.\n", "  Two concepts of centrality have been defined in complex networks. The first\nconsiders the centrality of a node and many different metrics for it has been\ndefined (e.g. eigenvector centrality, PageRank, non-backtracking centrality,\netc). The second is related to a large scale organization of the network, the\ncore-periphery structure, composed by a dense core plus an outlying and\nloosely-connected periphery. In this paper we investigate the relation between\nthese two concepts. We consider networks generated via the Stochastic Block\nModel, or its degree corrected version, with a strong core-periphery structure\nand we investigate the centrality properties of the core nodes and the ability\nof several centrality metrics to identify them. We find that the three measures\nwith the best performance are marginals obtained with belief propagation,\nPageRank, and degree centrality, while non-backtracking and eigenvector\ncentrality (or MINRES}, showed to be equivalent to the latter in the large\nnetwork limit) perform worse in the investigated networks.\n", "  Most quantum computing architectures can be realized as two-dimensional\nlattices of qubits that interact with each other. We take transmon qubits and\ntransmission line resonators as promising candidates for qubits and couplers;\nwe use them as basic building elements of a quantum code. We then propose a\nsimple framework to determine the optimal experimental layout to realize\nquantum codes. We show that this engineering optimization problem can be\nreduced to the solution of standard binary linear programs. While solving such\nprograms is a NP-hard problem, we propose a way to find scalable optimal\narchitectures that require solving the linear program for a restricted number\nof qubits and couplers. We apply our methods to two celebrated quantum codes,\nnamely the surface code and the Fibonacci code.\n", "  We report an experimental study of excitons in a double quantum well van der\nWaals heterostructure made of atomically thin layers of \\Mo* and hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN). The emission of neutral and charged excitons is controlled\nby gate voltage, temperature, and both the helicity and the power of optical\nexcitation.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Wheeler-DeWitt equation modified by a\ndeformation of the second quantized canonical commutation relations. Such\nmodified commutation relations are induced by a Generalized Uncertainty\nPrinciple. Since the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be related to a\nSturm-Liouville problem where the associated eigenvalue can be interpreted as\nthe cosmological constant, it is possible to explicitly relate such an\neigenvalue to the deformation parameter of the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation. The analysis is performed in a Mini-Superspace approach where the\nscale factor appears as the only degree of freedom. The deformation of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation gives rise to a Cosmological Constant even in absence\nof matter fields. As a Cosmological Constant cannot exists in absence of the\nmatter fields in the undeformed Mini-Superspace approach, so the existence of a\nnon-vanishing Cosmological Constant is a direct consequence of the deformation\nby the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. In fact, we are able to demonstrate\nthat a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant exists even in the deformed flat\nspace. We also discuss the consequences of this deformation on the big bang\nsingularity.\n", "  Time reversal symmetry (TRS) protects the metallic surface modes of\ntopological insulators (TIs). The transport signature of robust metallic\nsurface modes of TIs is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of\nthe insulating bulk with decreasing temperature. This universal behavior is\nobserved in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, several\ntopological semimetals (TSMs) have been found that exhibit extreme\nmagnetoresistance (XMR) and TI universal resistivity behavior revealed only\nwhen breaking TRS, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these\nnew materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated for Weyl semimetal due to their lack\nof inversion symmetry, Cd3As2 is nominated for Dirac semimetal due to its\nlinear band crossing at the Fermi level, and WTe2 is nominated for resonant\ncompensated semimetal due to its perfect electron-hole symmetry. Here we\nintroduce LaSb, a simple rock-salt structure material without broken inversion\nsymmetry, without perfect linear band crossing, and without perfect\nelectron-hole symmetry. Yet LaSb portrays all the exotic field induced\nbehaviors of the aforementioned semimetals in an archetypal fashion. It shows\n(a) the universal TI resistivity with a plateau at 15 K, revealed by a magnetic\nfield, (b) ultrahigh mobility of carriers in the plateau region, (c) quantum\noscillations with a non-trivial Berry phase, and (d) XMR of about one million\npercent at 9 tesla rivaled only by WTe2 and NbP. Due to its dramatic\nsimplicity, LaSb is the ideal model system to formulate a theoretical\nunderstanding of the exotic consequences of breaking TRS in TSMs.\n", "  We present the first experimental study of the double-quantum-well (DQW)\nsystem made of 2D layers with inverted energy band spectrum: HgTe. The\nmagnetotransport reveals a considerably larger overlap of the conduction and\nvalence subbands than in known HgTe single quantum wells (QW), which may be\nregulated by an applied gate voltage $V_g$. This large overlap manifests itself\nin a much higher critical field $B_c$ separating the range above it where the\nquantum peculiarities shift linearly with $V_g$ and the range below with a\ncomplicated behavior. In the latter case the $N$-shaped and double-$N$-shaped\nstructures in the Hall magnetoresistance $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ are observed with their\nscale in field pronouncedly enlarged as compared to the pictures observed in an\nanalogous single QW. The coexisting electrons and holes were found in the whole\ninvestigated range of positive and negative $V_g$ as revealed from fits to the\nlow-field $N$-shaped $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ and from the Fourier analysis of\noscillations in $\\rho_{xx}(B)$. A peculiar feature here is that the found\nelectron density $n$ remains almost constant in the whole range of investigated\n$V_g$ while the hole density $p$ drops down from the value a factor of 6 larger\nthan $n$ at extreme negative $V_g$ to almost zero at extreme positive $V_g$\npassing through the charge neutrality point. We show that this difference\nbetween $n$ and $p$ stems from an order of magnitude larger density of states\nfor holes in the lateral valence band maxima than for electrons in the\nconduction band minimum. We interpret the observed reentrant sign-alternating\n$\\rho_{xy}(B)$ between electronic and hole conductivities and its zero\nresistivity state in the quantum Hall range of fields on the basis of a\ncalculated picture of magnetic levels in a DQW.\n", "  Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous calcium binding protein consisting of two\nstructurally similar domains with distinct stabilities, binding affinities, and\nflexibilities. We present coarse grained simulations that suggest the mechanism\nfor the domain's allosteric transitions between the open and closed\nconformations depend on subtle differences in the folded state topology of the\ntwo domains. Throughout a wide temperature range, the simulated transition\nmechanism of the N-terminal domain (nCaM) follows a two-state transition\nmechanism while domain opening in the C-terminal domain (cCaM) involves\nunfolding and refolding of the tertiary structure. The appearance of the\nunfolded intermediate occurs at a higher temperature in nCaM than it does in\ncCaM consistent with nCaM's higher thermal stability. Under approximate\nphysiological conditions, the simulated unfolded state population of cCaM\naccounts for 10% of the population with nearly all of the sampled transitions\n(approximately 95%) unfolding and refolding during the conformational change.\nTransient unfolding significantly slows the domain opening and closing rates of\ncCaM. This potentially influences the mechanism of calcium binding to each\ndomain.\n", "  We consider a pp-wave symmetric model in the framework of the\nEinstein-Maxwell-aether-axion theory. Exact solutions to the equations of axion\nelectrodynamics are obtained for the model, in which pseudoscalar, electric and\nmagnetic fields were constant before the arrival of a gravitational pp-wave. We\nshow that dynamo-optical interactions, i.e. couplings of the electromagnetic\nfield to a dynamic unit vector field, attributed to the velocity of a cosmic\nsubstratum (aether, vacuum, dark fluid...), provide the response of axionically\nactive electrodynamic system to display anomalous behavior.\n", "  Cosmology has made enormous progress through studies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground, however the subtle signals being now sought such as B-mode\npolarisation due to primordial gravitational waves are increasingly hard to\ndisentangle from residual Galactic foregrounds in the derived CMB maps. We\nrevisit our finding that on large angular scales there are traces of the nearby\nold supernova remnant Loop I in the WMAP 9-year map of the CMB and confirm this\nwith the new SMICA map from the Planck satellite.\n", "  Very recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration has released their\nsecond group of Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy candidates. With the\npublicly-available Pass 8 data of Fermi-LAT we search for $\\gamma-$ray\nemissions from the directions of these eight newly discovered dSph galaxy\ncandidates. No statistically significant $\\gamma-$ray signal has been found in\nthe combined analysis of these sources. With the empirically estimated\nJ-factors of these sources, the constraint on the annihilation channel of\n$\\chi\\chi \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is comparable to the bound set by the\njoint analysis of fifteen previously known dSphs with kinematically constrained\nJ-factors for the dark matter mass $m_\\chi>250$ GeV. In the direction of Tucana\nIII (DES J2356-5935), one of the nearest dSph galaxy candidates that is $\\sim\n25$ kpc away, there is a weak $\\gamma-$ray signal and its peak test statistic\n(TS) value for the dark matter annihilation channel $\\chi\\chi\\rightarrow\n\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-1}$ is $\\approx 6.7$ at $m_\\chi \\sim 15$ GeV. The significance\nof the possible signal likely increases with time. More data is highly needed\nto pin down the physical origin of such a GeV excess.\n", "  We propose here a quantum hoop conjecture which states: the de Broglie\nwavelength of a quantum system cannot be arbitrarily small, it must be larger\nthan the characterized Schwarzschild radius of the quantum system. Based on\nthis conjecture, we find an upper bound for the wave number (or the momentum)\nof a particle, which offers a natural cutoff for the vacuum energy of a scalar\nfield.\n", "  We study the onset of eigenstate thermalization in the two-dimensional\ntransverse field Ising model (2D-TFIM) in the square lattice. We consider two\nnon-equivalent Hamiltonians: the ferromagnetic 2D-TFIM and the\nantiferromagnetic 2D-TFIM in the presence of a uniform longitudinal field. We\nuse full exact diagonalization to examine the behavior of quantum chaos\nindicators and of the diagonal matrix elements of operators of interest in the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian. A finite size scaling analysis reveals that\nquantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization occur in those systems whenever the\nfields are nonvanishing and not too large.\n", "  Recent non-detection of gravitational-wave backgrounds from pulsar timing\narrays casts further uncertainty on the evolution of supermassive black hole\nbinaries. We study the capabilities of current gravitational-wave observatories\nto detect individual binaries and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional\nwisdom, some are in principle detectable throughout the Universe. In\nparticular, a binary with rest-frame mass $\\gtrsim10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$ can be\ndetected by current timing arrays at arbitrarily high redshifts. The same claim\nwill apply for less massive binaries with more sensitive future arrays. As a\nconsequence, future searches for nanohertz gravitational waves could be\nexpanded to target evolving high-redshift binaries. We calculate the maximum\ndistance at which binaries can be observed with pulsar timing arrays and other\ndetectors, properly accounting for redshift and using realistic binary\nwaveforms.\n", "  Recent experimental progress using ultracold gases in optical lattices\nnecessitates a quantitative theoretical description for a significant number of\nbosons. In the present paper, we investigate if time-dependent semiclassical\ninitial value methods, with propagators expressed as integrals over phase space\nusing classical trajectories, is suitable to describe interacting bosons,\nconcentrating on a single mode. Despite the nonlinear contribution from the\nself-interaction, the corresponding classical dynamics allows for a largely\nanalytical treatment of the semiclassical propagator. We find that the\nHerman-Kluk (HK) propagator conserves unitarity in the semiclassical limit\n($n\\to\\infty$), but a decay of the norm is seen for low $n$. The frozen\nGaussian approximation (FGA, i.e. HK with unit prefactor) is explicitly shown\nto violate unitarity in the present system for non-vanishing interaction\nstrength, even in the semiclassical limit. Furthermore, we show by evaluating\nthe phase space integral in steepest descent approximation, that the HK\npropagator reproduces the exact spectrum correctly in the limit $n\\to \\infty$.\nAn error is, however, incurred in next-to-next-to-leading order (small\nparameter $1/n$), as seen upon numerical evaluation of the integral or by\nconsidering finite $n$ corrections to steepest descent. The FGA, in contrast,\nis only accurate to lowest order, and an erroneous next-to-leading order term\nin the energy spectrum was found analytically. Finally, as an example\napplication, we study the dynamics of wave packets by computing the time\nevolution of the Wigner function. While the often-used truncated Wigner\napproximation cannot capture any interferences present in the exact quantum\nmechanical solution (known analytically), we find that the HK approach, despite\nalso using classical information only, reproduces the salient features of the\nexact solution correctly.\n", "  We propose an entanglement purification scheme based on material qubits and\nancillary coherent multiphoton states. We consider a typical QED scenario where\nmaterial qubits implemented by two-level atoms fly sequentially through a\ncavity and interact resonantly with a single mode of the radiation field. We\nexplore the theoretical possibilities of realizing a high-fidelity two-qubit\nquantum operation necessary for the purification protocol with the help of a\npostselective balanced homodyne photodetection. We demonstrate that the\nobtained probabilistic quantum operation can be used as a bilateral operation\nin the proposed purification scheme. It is shown that the probabilistic nature\nof this quantum operation is counterbalanced in the last step of the scheme\nwhere qubits are not discarded after inadequate qubit measurements. As this\nprotocol requires present-day experimental setups and generates high-fidelity\nentangled pairs with high repetition rates, it may offer interesting\nperspectives for applications in quantum information theory.\n", "  We elucidate a recently emergent framework in unifying the two families of\nhigh temperature (high $T_c$) superconductors, cuprates and iron-based\nsuperconductors. The unification suggests that the latter is simply the\ncounterpart of the former to realize robust extended s-wave pairing symmetries\nin a square lattice. The unification identifies that the key ingredients (gene)\nof high $T_c$ superconductors is a quasi two dimensional electronic environment\nin which the d-orbitals of cations that participate in strong in-plane\ncouplings to the p-orbitals of anions are isolated near Fermi energy. With this\ngene, the superexchange magnetic interactions mediated by anions could maximize\ntheir contributions to superconductivity. Creating the gene requires special\narrangements between local electronic structures and crystal lattice\nstructures. The speciality explains why high $T_c$ superconductors are so rare.\nAn explicit prediction is made to realize high $T_c$ superconductivity in\n$Co/Ni$-based materials with a quasi two dimensional hexagonal lattice\nstructure formed by trigonal bipyramidal complexes.\n", "  The importance of collective cellular migration during embryogenesis and\ntissue repair asks for a sound understanding of underlying principles and\nmechanisms. Here, we address recent in vitro experiments on cell monolayers\nwhich show that the advancement of the leading edge relies on cell\nproliferation and protrusive activity at the tissue margin. Within a simple\nviscoelastic mechanical model amenable to detailed analysis, we identify a key\nparameter responsible for tissue expansion, and we determine the dependence of\nthe monolayer velocity as a function of measurable rheological parameters. Our\nresults allow us to discuss the effects of pharmacological perturbations on the\nobserved tissue dynamics.\n", "  We use Hamiltonian reduction to simplify Falqui and Mencattini's recent proof\nof Sklyanin's expression providing spectral Darboux coordinates of the rational\nCalogero-Moser system. This viewpoint enables us to verify a conjecture of\nFalqui and Mencattini, and to obtain Sklyanin's formula as a corollary.\n", "  As carriers slowly move through a disordered energy landscape in organic\nsemiconductors, tiny spatial variations in spin dynamics relieve spin blocking\nat transport bottlenecks or in the electron-hole recombination process that\nproduces light. Large room-temperature magnetic-field effects (MFE) ensue in\nthe conductivity and luminescence. Sources of variable spin dynamics generate\nmuch larger MFE if their spatial structure is correlated on the nanoscale with\nthe energetic sites governing conductivity or luminescence such as in\nco-evaporated organic blends within which the electron resides on one molecule\nand the hole on the other (an exciplex). Here we show that exciplex\nrecombination in blends exhibiting thermally-activated delayed fluorescence\n(TADF) produces MFE in excess of 60% at room temperature. In addition, effects\ngreater than 4000% can be achieved by tuning the device's current-voltage\nresponse curve by device conditioning. These immense MFEs are both the largest\nreported values for their device type at room temperature. Our theory traces\nthis MFE and its unusual temperature dependence to changes in spin mixing\nbetween triplet exciplexes and light-emitting singlet exciplexes. In contrast,\nspin mixing of excitons is energetically suppressed, and thus spin mixing\nproduces comparatively weaker MFE in materials emitting light from excitons by\naffecting the precursor pairs. Demonstration of immense MFE in common organic\nblends provides a flexible and inexpensive pathway towards magnetic\nfunctionality and field sensitivity in current organic devices without\npatterning the constituent materials on the nanoscale. Magnetic fields increase\nthe power efficiency of unconditioned devices by 30% at room temperature, also\nshowing that magnetic fields may increase the efficiency of the TADF process.\n", "  A peak in coincidence events has been observed in a modified Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterferometer fed with weak coherent states inside the region of overlapping\nwave-packets. The inversion of the usual interference pattern represented by\nthe HOM dip is equally observed when the wave packets are frequency displaced.\nThe higher rate of coincidences indicates that photons are more likely to take\non different output paths of the interferometer. This effect was harnessed so a\ndetection on one of the arms could herald the presence of a photon in the\nother. The second order autocorrelation function at zero time was\nexperimentally determined by means of the Hanburry-Brown and Twiss experiment\nand its value below 1 confirmed the sub-Poisson photon statistics of the\nheralded states.\n", "  Employing density functional theory-based methods, we investigate monolayer\nand bilayer structures of hexagonal SnS$_{2}$, which is recently synthesized\nmonolayer metal dichalcogenide. Comparison of 1H and 1T phases of monolayer\nSnS$_{2}$ confirms the ground state to be the 1T phase. In its bilayer\nstructure we examine different stacking configurations of the two layers. It is\nfound that the interlayer coupling in bilayer SnS$_{2}$ is weaker than that of\ntypical transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) so that alternative stacking\norders have similar structural parameters and they are separated with low\nenergy barriers. Possible signature of the stacking order in SnS$_{2}$ bilayer\nhas been sought in the calculated absorbance and reflectivity spectra. We also\nstudy the effects of the external electric field, charging, and loading\npressure on the characteristic properties of bilayer SnS$_{2}$. It is found\nthat (i) the electric field increases the coupling between the layers at its\nprefered stacking order, so the barrier height increases, (ii) the bang gap\nvalue can be tuned by the external E-field and under sufficient E-field, the\nbilayer SnS$_{2}$ can become semi-metal, (iii) the most favorable stacking\norder can be switched by charging and (iv) a loading pressure exceeding 3 GPa\nchanges the stacking order. E-field tunable bandgap and easy-tunable stacking\nsequence of SnS$_{2}$ layers make this 2D crystal structure a good candidate\nfor field effect transistor and nanoscale lubricant applications.\n", "  Two-dimensional dumbbell (DB) stanene has been proposed as a promising\ncandidate material for realizing quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) by Tang et al\n[P. Tang, P. Chen, W. Cao, H. Huang, S. Cahangirov, L. Xian, Y. Xu, S. C.\nZhang, W. Duan, A. Rubio. Phys. Rev. B, 90, 121408 (2014)]. However, the small\nbulk-gap limits its possible applications at room temperature. Based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we predict that its band gap can be enhanced to\n148 meV under methyl-functionalization, which can be further tuned by applying\nlattice strain. The QSHE is confirmed by s-px,y band inversion, topological\ninvariant Z2 = 1, and helical gapless edge within bulk band gap. Notably, the\ncharacteristic properties of edge states, such as the large Fermi velocity and\nDirac cone, can be modulated by edge modification. The effects of substrates on\ntopological properties are explored when it is grown on various substrates,\nlike SiC, h-BN, and Bi2Te3 sheets. These findings provide significant guidance\nfor future fabrication and realistic applications of QSHE based on stanene in\nspintronics.\n", "  We present an experimental method for creating and verifying photon-number\nstates created by non-degenerate, third-order nonlinear-optical photon-pair\nsources. By using spatially multiplexed, thresholding single-photon detectors\nand inverting a conditional probability matrix, we determine the photon-number\nprobabilities created through heralded spontaneous four-wave-mixing. The\ndeleterious effects of noise photons on reliable heralding are investigated and\nshown to degrade the conditional preparation of two-photon number states more\nthan they degrade conditional single-photon states. We derive the equivalence\nbetween the presence of unwanted noise in the herald channel and loss in the\nsignal channel of heralded experiments. A procedure for characterizing the\nnoise-photon contributions, and a means of estimating the herald noise-free\nphoton-number distribution is demonstrated.\n", "  Liquid dispensing and writing in the extremely small size regime are\nimportant for applications in many current technologies, such as micro/nano\nfabrication, biological/chemical patterning and analysis, and drug discovery.\nMost of current dispensing/writing methods can be sorted into a category of\nliquid flowing through tiny tubes or nozzles that requires inputting an impulse\nenergy, which leads to complex procedures, expensive equipment and narrow\nmaterial applicability, especially for biomaterials. Here, we report a method\nthat may lead to a new category: liquid flows over the tapered surface of a pin\nwith longitudinal nano grooves on the surface to uninterruptedly perform\ndroplet dispensing and direct writing. The dispensed droplet diameters were\ncontrollable from several microns down to 150 nm, and the written line heights\nwere as low as 5 nm. The mechanism underlying automatic liquid storage on\nconical surface and spontaneous liquid transport through nano grooves is\nrevealed and well modeled by a simple relationship. Furthermore, the\nnano-grooved pins are much simpler and cheaper in fabrication than nanoscale\ntubes and nozzles, and pins have much depressed clogging problems that are\ntypically troublesome for tubes and nozzles. Our new strategy may constitute a\nbasis for creating liquid dispensing/writing technologies that are\nsimultaneously smaller, simpler, faster and applicable for more types of\nmaterials.\n", "  PbCuTe2O6 is a rare example of a spin liquid candidate featuring a three\ndimensional magnetic lattice. Strong geometric frustration arises from the\ndominant antiferromagnetic interaction which generates a hyperkagome network of\nCu2+ ions although additional interactions enhance the magnetic lattice\nconnectivity. Through a combination of magnetization measurements and local\nprobe investigation by NMR and muSR down to 20 mK, we provide a robust evidence\nfor the absence of magnetic freezing in the ground state. The local spin\nsusceptibility probed by the NMR shift hardly deviates from the macroscopic one\ndown to 1 K pointing to a homogeneous magnetic system with a low defect\nconcentration. The saturation of the NMR shift and the sublinear power law\ntemperature (T) evolution of the 1/T1 NMR relaxation rate at low T point to a\nnon-singlet ground state favoring a gapless fermionic description of the\nmagnetic excitations. Below 1 K a pronounced slowing down of the spin dynamics\nis witnessed, which may signal a reconstruction of spinon Fermi surface.\nNonetheless, the compound remains in a fluctuating spin liquid state down to\nthe lowest temperature of the present investigation.\n", "  Inverse planning algorithms for dwell time optimisation in interstitial\nhigh-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy may produce solutions with large dwell time\nvariations within catheters, which may result in undesirable selective\nhigh-dose subvolumes. Extending the optimisation model with a dwell time\nmodulation restriction (DTMR) that limits dwell time differences between\nneighboring dwell positions has been suggested to eliminate this issue. DTMRs\nmay additionally reduce the sensitivity for uncertainties in dwell positions\nthat result from catheter reconstruction errors and source positioning\ninaccuracies. This study quantifies the reduction of high-dose subvolumes and\nthe robustness against these uncertainties by applying a DTMR to template-based\nprostate HDR brachytherapy implants.\n  Three different DTMRs were consecutively applied to a linear dose-based\npenalty model (LD) and a dose-volume based model (LDV), both obtained from\nliterature. The models were solved with DTMR levels ranging from no restriction\nto uniform dwell times within catheters. Uncertainties were simulated on\nclinical cases using in-house developed software, and dose-volume metrics were\ncalculated in each simulation. For the assessment of high-dose subvolumes, the\ndose homogeneity index (DHI) and the contiguous dose volume histogram were\nanalysed. Robustness was measured by the improvement of the lowest $D_{90\\%}$\nof the planning target volume (PTV) observed in the simulations.\n  For (LD), a DTMR yields an increase in DHI of 30% and reduces the size of the\nlargest high-dose volume by 2 to 5 cc. This came at a cost of a reduction in\n$D_{90\\%}$ of the PTV of 10%, which often implies that it drops below the\ndesired minimum of 100%. For (LDV), none of the DTMRs improved high-dose volume\nmeasures. DTMRs were not capable of improving robustness of PTV $D_{90\\%}$\nagainst uncertainty in dwell positions for both models.\n", "  A new quantum-theoretical derivation of the elastic and inelastic scattering\nprobability of He atoms from a metal surface, where the energy and momentum\nexchange with the phonon gas can only occur through the mediation of the\nsurface free-electron density, shows that the Debye-Waller exponent is directly\nproportional to the electron-phonon mass coupling constant $\\lambda$. The\ncomparison between the values of $\\lambda$ extracted from existing data on the\nDebye-Waller factor for various metal surfaces and the $\\lambda$ values known\nfrom literature indicates a substantial agreement, which opens the possibility\nof directly extracting the electron-phonon coupling strength in quasi-2D\nconducting systems from the temperature or incident energy dependence of the\nelastic Helium atom scattering intensities.\n", "  We refine the method towards extraction of sub-cycle transients in the 0.1-1\nTHz frequency (mm-wavelength) range from optical rectification in lithium\nniobate using tilted pulse fronts. Our scheme exploits previously unexplored\nspatio-temporal shaping of the pump pulses, resulting in highly efficient and\nnear diffraction-limited sub-THz transients reaching 0.2 GV/m electric field\nstrengths in free-space using only mJ-level optical ps-pulses. We address\nexperimentally and theoretically the means to producing above-GV/m relativistic\nsub-THz transients with proper beam confinement and under moderate pumping\nconditions, thereby bringing widespread access to strong-field and nonlinear\nterahertz applications and devices.\n", "  By considering Dirac's equation using quaternions ($\\mathbb{H}$) with their\ngreater degree of freedom in imaginaries, it is shown that a model can be\ncreated with oscillations among flavors even if the particles, are massless.\nFurthermore the solutions are spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ and have helicities depending\non whether their energy is positive or negative.\n", "  We analyze BPS black hole attractors in 4d gauged supergravity in the\npresence of higher derivative supersymmetric terms, including a\nWeyl-squared-type action, and determine the resulting corrections to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy. The near-horizon geometry AdS$_2 \\times$S$^2$ (or\nother Riemann surface) preserves half of the supercharges in $N=2$ supergravity\nwith Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging. We derive a relation between the entropy and the\nblack hole charges that suggests via AdS/CFT how subleading corrections\ncontribute to the supersymmetric index in the dual microscopic picture.\n  Depending on the model, the attractors are part of full black hole solutions\nwith different asymptotics, such as Minkowski, AdS$_4$, and hvLif$_4$. We give\nexplicit examples for each of the asymptotic cases and comment on the\nimplications. Among other results, we find that the Weyl-squared terms spoil\nthe exact two-derivative relation to non-BPS asymptotically flat black holes in\nungauged supergravity.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the annealing effect on the structure and\ncomposition of the polar surface of SrTiO3 (111), starting with an ex-situ\nchemical etch. The relative surface concentration between Ti and Sr strongly\ndepends on both the annealing temperature and the oxygen processing. There is a\ncritical annealing temperature at which the maximum concentration ratio of Ti\nto Sr is achieved, while still maintaining a (1 x 1) surface structure. We\ndemonstrate that with proper processing it is possible to avoid surface\nreconstruction over a broad temperature range. Our results provide an optimal\ntemperature window for epitaxial film growth.\n", "  In this paper, we present a thorough stress analysis of the Cu-Zr\nmetallic-glass composite with embedded B2 particles subject to a martensitic\ntransformation. Within the framework of the Eshelby theory, we are able to\nexplain, in a quantitative manner, (1) the formation of three types of shear\nbands with distinct morphologies as observed experimentally in the severely\ndeformed Cu-Zr metallic-glass composite and (2) the work hardening ability of\nthe Cu-Zr metallic-glass composite as related to the coupled effects of elastic\nback stress and elastic mismatch caused by the martensitic transformation.\nFurthermore, we also discuss the issues about the stress affected zone of the\nindividual B2 phase and the stability of the crystalline-amorphous interface.\nGiven the general agreement between the theoretical and experimental findings,\nwe believe that the outcome of our current work can lead to a deeper\nunderstanding of the transformation-induced plasticity in the Cu-Zr based\nmetallic glass composites, which should be very useful to the design of the\nmetallic-glass composites with improved ductility.\n", "  Synthesis of single-wavelength temporal phase-shifting algorithms (PSA) for\ninterferometry is well-known and firmly based on the frequency transfer\nfunction (FTF) paradigm. Here we extend the single-wavelength FTF-theory to\ndual and multi-wavelength PSA-synthesis when several simultaneous laser-colors\nare present. The FTF-based synthesis for dual-wavelength PSA (DW-PSA) is\noptimized for high signal-to-noise ratio and minimum number of temporal\nphase-shifted interferograms. The DW-PSA synthesis herein presented may be used\nfor interferometric contouring of discontinuous industrial objects. Also DW-PSA\nmay be useful for DW shop-testing of deep free-form aspheres. As shown here,\nusing the FTF-based synthesis one may easily find explicit DW-PSA formulae\noptimized for high signal-to-noise and high detuning robustness. To this date,\nno general synthesis and analysis for temporal DW-PSAs has been given; only\nhad-hoc DW-PSAs formulas have been reported. Consequently, no explicit formulae\nfor their spectra, their signal-to-noise, their detuning and harmonic\nrobustness has been given. Here for the first time a fully general procedure\nfor designing DW-PSAs (or triple-wavelengths PSAs) with desire spectrum,\nsignal-to-noise ratio and detuning robustness is given. We finally generalize\nDW-PSA to higher number of wavelength temporal PSAs.\n", "  Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, with arced Fermi\nsurface contours that are predicted to propagate through the bulk when their\nmomentum matches that of the surface projections of the bulk's Weyl nodes. We\nuse spectroscopic mapping with a scanning tunneling microscope to visualize\nquasi-particle scattering and interference at the surface of the Weyl semimetal\nTaAs. Our measurements reveal 10 different scattering wave vectors, which can\nbe understood and precisely reproduced with a theory that takes into account\nthe shape, spin texture, and momentum-dependent propagation of the Fermi arc\nsurface states into the bulk. Our findings provide evidence that Weyl nodes act\nas sinks for electron transport on the surface of these materials.\n", "  This review focuses on numerical approaches to deducing the light-scattering\nand thermal-emission properties of primitive dust particles in planetary\nsystems from astronomical observations. The particles are agglomerates of small\ngrains with sizes comparable to visible wavelength and compositions being\nmainly magnesium-rich silicates, iron-bearing metals, and organic refractory\nmaterials in pristine phases. These unique characteristics of primitive dust\nparticles reflect their formation and evolution around main-sequence stars of\nessentially solar composition. The development of light-scattering theories has\nbeen offering powerful tools to make a thorough investigation of light\nscattering and thermal emission by primitive dust agglomerates in such a\ncircumstellar environment. In particular, the discrete dipole approximation,\nthe T-matrix method, and effective medium approximations are the most popular\ntechniques for practical use in astronomy. Numerical simulations of light\nscattering and thermal emission by dust agglomerates of submicrometer-sized\nconstituent grains have a great potential to provide new state-of-the-art\nknowledge of primitive dust particles in planetary systems. What is essential\nto this end is to combine the simulations with comprehensive collections of\nrelevant results from not only astronomical observations, but also in-situ data\nanalyses, laboratory sample analyses, laboratory analogue experiments, and\ntheoretical studies on the origin and evolution of the particles.\n", "  Adhesion forces between submicrometer-sized silicate grains play a crucial\nrole in the formation of silicate dust agglomerates, rocky planetesimals, and\nterrestrial planets. The surface energy of silicate dust particles is the key\nto their adhesion and rolling forces in a theoretical model based on the\ncontact mechanics. Here we revisit the cohesion of amorphous silica spheres by\ncompiling available data on the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica\nin various circumstances. It turned out that the surface energy for hydrophilic\namorphous silica in a vacuum is a factor of 10 higher than previously assumed.\nTherefore, the previous theoretical models underestimated the critical velocity\nfor the sticking of amorphous silica spheres, as well as the rolling friction\nforces between them. With the most plausible value of the surface energy for\namorphous silica spheres, theoretical models based on the contact mechanics are\nin harmony with laboratory experiments. Consequently, we conclude that silicate\ngrains with a radius of $0.1~\\mu$m could grow to planetesimals via coagulation\nin a protoplanetary disk. We argue that the coagulation growth of silicate\ngrains in a molecular cloud is advanced either by organic mantles rather than\nicy mantles or, if there are no mantles, by nanometer-sized grain radius.\n", "  We present theoretical and experimental studies of the elastic response of\nfibrous networks subjected to uniaxial strain. Uniaxial compression or\nextension is applied to extracellular networks of fibrin and collagen using a\nshear rheometer with free water in/outflow. Both axial stress and the network\nshear modulus are measured. Prior work [van Oosten et al., Scientific Reports,\n2015, 6, 19270] has shown softening/stiffening of these networks under\ncompression/extension, together with a nonlinear response to shear, but the\norigin of such behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we study how uniaxial\nstrain influences the nonlinear mechanics of fibrous networks. Using a\ncomputational network model with bendable and stretchable fibres, we show that\nthe softening/stiffening behaviour can be understood for fixed lateral\nboundaries in 2D and 3D networks with comparable average connectivities to the\nexperimental extracellular networks. Moreover, we show that the onset of\nstiffening depends strongly on the imposed uniaxial strain. Our study\nhighlights the importance of both axial strain and boundary conditions in\ndetermining the mechanical response of hydrogels.\n", "  The equation of state (EoS) $P = P (\\rho, ...)$ -- pressure as a function of\ndensity and other thermodynamical quantities -- is what generates\nparticularities of mass--radius distribution $M (R)$ for super--dense compact\nstellar bodies, the remnants of cosmic cataclysms. In view of recent nuclear\nexperiments, we propose one particular EoS, which admits the critical state\ncharacterized by density $\\rho_c$ and temperature $T_c$, and which under\ncertain conditions permits a radial distribution of the super--dense matter in\n\"liquid\" phase. We establish such conditions and demonstrate that a stable\nconfiguration is indeed possible (only) for temperatures smaller than the\ncritical one. Using Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations for hydrostatic\nequilibrium, we derive the mass--radius relation for the super--dense compact\nobjects with masses smaller than the Sun, $M \\ll M_{\\odot}$. The obtained\nresults are within the constraints established by both heavy--ion collision\nexperiments and theoretical studies of neutron--rich matter.\n", "  In this work we look for a geometric description of non-gravitational forces.\nThe basic ideas are proposed studying the interaction between a punctual\nparticle and an electromagnetic external field. For this purpose, we introduce\nthe concept of proper space-time, that allow us to describe this interaction in\na way analogous to the one that the general relativity theory does for\ngravitation. The field equations that define this geometry are similar to the\nEinstein's equations, where in general, the energy-momentum tensor have\ninformation of both, the particle and the external field. In this formalism we\nconsider the particle path as being a geodesic in a curved space-time, and so,\nthe electromagnetic force is understood in a purely geometric way.\n", "  We demonstrate the crossover from indirect- to direct band gap in\ntensile-strained germanium by temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The\nsamples are strained microbridges that enhance a biaxial strain of 0.16% up to\n3.6% uniaxial tensile strain. Cooling the bridges to 20 K increases the\nuniaxial strain up to a maximum of 5.4%. Temperature-dependent\nphotoluminescence reveals the crossover to a fundamental direct band gap to\noccur between 4.0% and 4.5%. Our data are in good agreement with new\ntheoretical computations that predict a strong bowing of the band parameters\nwith strain.\n", "  We present a new particle image correlation technique for resolving\nnanoparticle flow velocity using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The\ntwo primary issues that complicate nanoparticle scanning laser image\ncorrelation (SLIC) based velocimetry are (1) the use of diffusion dominated\nnanoparticles as flow tracers, which introduce a random decorrelating error\ninto the velocity estimate, and (2) the effects of the scanning laser image\nacquisition, which introduces a bias error. To date, no study has quantified\nthese errors or demonstrated a means to deal with them in SLIC velocimetry. In\nthis work, we build upon the robust phase correlation (RPC) and existing\nmethods of SLIC to quantify and mitigate these errors. First, we implement an\nensemble RPC instead of using an ensemble standard cross correlation, and\ndevelop an SLIC optimal filter that maximizes the correlation strength in order\nto reliably and accurately detect the correlation peak representing the most\nprobable average displacement of the nanoparticles. Secondly, we developed an\nanalytical model of the SLIC measurement bias error due to image scanning of\ndiffusion dominated tracer particles. We show that the bias error depends only\non the ratio of the mean velocity of the tracer particles to that of the laser\nscanner and we use this model to correct the induced errors. We validated our\ntechnique using synthetic images and experimentally obtained SLIC images of\nnanoparticle flow through a micro-channel. Our technique reduced the error by\nup to a factor of ten compared to other SLIC algorithms for the images tested\nin this study. Moreover, our optimized RPC filter is reducing the number of\nimage pairs required for the convergence of the ensemble correlation by two\norders of magnitude compared to the standard cross correlation.\n", "  The singular values of the logarithmic potential transform on the generalized\nBergmann space is calculated explicitly, too behavior in infinity\n", "  We continue our investigation of quark confinement using a particular variant\nof the Cho-Duan-Ge gauge independent Abelian decomposition. The decomposition\nsplits the gauge field into a restricted Abelian part and a coloured part in a\nway that preserves gauge covariance. The restricted part of the gauge field can\nbe divided into a Maxwell term and a topological term. Previously, we showed\nthat by a particular choice of this decomposition we could fully describe the\nconfining potential using only the restricted gauge field. We proposed that\nvarious topological objects (a form of magnetic monopole) could arise in the\nrestricted field which would drive confinement. Our mechanism does not\nexplicitly refer to a dual Meissner effect, nor does it use centre vortices. We\ndid not need to gauge fix or introduce any new dynamical fields.\n  We show that if we do gauge fix as well as performing the Abelian\ndecomposition then it is possible to ensure that the topological part of the\nrestricted field fully accounts for the confining potential. Our relationship\nis exact: there is no approximation or model involved. This isolates the\nobjects responsible for confinement from non-confining contributions to the\ngauge field, allowing a direct search for our proposed topological objects.\nUsing numerical studies in SU(2), we confirm that our proposed monopoles are\npresent in the field, and the winding number associated with these monopoles is\na key factor driving quark confinement.\n  In SU(2), our monopoles are described by two parameters. We show that it is\npossible to re-parametrise the Yang Mills action and the functional integration\nmeasure in terms of these variables (plus the necessary additional parameters).\nWe can thus treat the monopoles as dynamical variables in the functional\nintegral. This might be the first step in a future analytical computation to\ncomplement our numerical results.\n", "  We introduce a discrete 4-dimensional module over the integers that appears\nto have maximal symmetry. By adjoining the usual Minkowski distance, we obtain\na discrete 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Forming universe histories in this\nspace and employing the standard causal order, the histories become causal\nsets. These causal sets increase in size rapidly and describe an inflationary\nperiod for the early universe. We next consider the symmetry group $G$ for the\nmodule. We show that $G$ has order 24 and we construct its group table. In a\nsense $G$ is a discrete approximation to the Lorentz group. However, we note\nthat it contains no boosts and is essentially a rotation group. Unitary\nrepresentations of $G$ are constructed. The energy-momentum space dual to the\ndiscrete module is obtained and a quantum formalism is derived. A discrete Fock\nspace is introduced on this structure and free quantum fields are considered.\nFinally, we take the first step in a study of interacting quantum fields.\n", "  Students' attitudes and approaches to problem solving in physics can\nprofoundly influence their motivation to learn and development of expertise. We\ndeveloped and validated an Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving survey\nby expanding the Attitudes towards Problem Solving survey of Marx and Cummings\nand administered it to physics graduate students. Comparison of their responses\nto the survey questions about problem solving in their own graduate level\ncourses vs. problem solving in the introductory physics courses provides\ninsight into their expertise in introductory and graduate level physics. The\nphysics graduate students' responses to the survey questions were also compared\nwith those of introductory physics and astronomy students and physics faculty.\nWe find that, even for problem solving in introductory physics, graduate\nstudents' responses to some survey questions are less expert-like than those of\nthe physics faculty. Comparison of survey responses of graduate students and\nintroductory students for problem solving in introductory physics suggests that\ngraduate students' responses are in general more expert-like than those of\nintroductory students. However, survey responses suggest that graduate-level\nproblem solving by graduate students on several measures has remarkably similar\ntrends to introductory-level problem solving by introductory students.\n", "  We examine the evolution of dust attenuation curve using a sample of 9504\ndisk star-forming galaxies (SFGs) selected from the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys\nand a new technique relying on the fact that disk SFGs of similar stellar\nmasses at the same cosmic epoch are statistically identical in stellar\npopulations. We attribute the discrepancy in median magnitude between face-on\n(b/a>0.7) and edge-on (b/a<=0.4) subsamples solely to dust attenuation, and\nobtain the average attenuation in the rest-frame UV and optical as functions of\nstellar mass and redshift out to z=2.5. Our results show that the attenuation\ncurve becomes remarkably flatter at increasing redshift for both massive and\nlow-mass disk SFGs, and remains likely unchanged with galaxy stellar mass at a\nfixed epoch within uncertainties. Compared with the Calzetti law, our dust\nattenuation curves appear to be slightly steeper at 0.5<z<1.4 and remarkably\nflatter at 1.4<z<2.5. Our findings are consistent with a picture in which the\nevolution of dust grain size distribution is mainly responsible for the\nevolution of the dust attenuation curve in SFGs; dust shattering becomes a\ndominant process at z<~1.4, resulting in an enrichment of small dust grains and\nconsequently a steeper attenuation curve. We stress that extinction correction\nfor high-z galaxies should be done using mass- and redshift-dependent\nattenuation curves.\n", "  We have prepared polycrystalline samples of the trimer Ir oxide BaIrO3 with\nface-shared Ir3O12 trimers, and have investigated the origin of the phase\ntransition at 182 K by measuring resistivity, thermopower, magnetization and\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction. We propose a possible electronic model and\ntransition mechanism, starting from a localized electron picture on the basis\nof the Rietveld refinement. Within this model, BaIrO3 can be basically regarded\nas a Mott insulator, when the Ir3O12 trimer is identified to one pseudo-atom or\none lattice site. The transition can be viewed as a transition from the Mott\ninsulator phase to a kind of charge ordered insulator phase.\n", "  We present single-crystal growth and magnetic property studies of\ntellurium-bridged copper spin-1/2 system Ba$_2$CuTeO$_6$. The spin-exchange\ninteraction among copper spins via Cu-O-Te-O-Cu super-superexchange route leads\nto a novel two-leg spin ladder system. Spin susceptibility $\\chi$(T) data\nindicates that the triclinic Ba$_2$CuTeO$_6$ undergoes a stepwise crossover for\nexchange couplings revealed by a broad maximum near T$_{max}$$\\sim$75~K and an\nanisotropic cusp in $\\frac{d\\chi}{dT}$(T) to signify a three dimensional (3D)\nantiferromagnetic long-range ordering (LRO). The 3D LRO has been suggested from\nthe anisotropic behavior of $\\chi$(T) with strong c-axis spin anisotropy and\nthe signature of spin flop transition from the isothermal magnetization below\n$T_N$. Analysis of magnetic heat capacity (Cm) at $T_N$~15 K indicates that\nmost of the spin entropy (~92% ) has already been released above $T_N$, which\nsupports the picture of consecutive spin entropy reduction upon cooling with\nTe-bridged two-leg spin ladder system with strong intraladder and interladder\ncouplings. Theoretical DFT+U calculations have been performed to search for the\nground state magnetic configuration and also to evaluate exchange coupling\nconstants that support the magnetic model deduced from the combined spin\nsusceptibility and crystal structure symmetry analysis.\n", "  An obstacle encountered in applying orthogonal-polynomials fitting is how to\nselect out the proper fitting expression. By adding a Laplace term to the error\nexpression and introducing the concept of overfitting degree, a regularization\nand corresponding cross validation scheme is proposed for two-variable\npolynomials fitting. While the Fortran implementation of above scheme is\napplied to magnetization data, a satisfactory fitting precision is reached, and\noverfitting problem can be quantitatively assessed, which therefore offers the\nquite reliable base for future comprehensive investigations of magnetocaloric\nand phase-transition properties of magnetic functional materials.\n", "  Following an idea of Choi, we obtain a decomposition theorem for k-positive\nlinear maps from Mm to Mn, where 2<=k<min{m,n}. As a consequence, we give an\naffirmative answer to Kye's conjecture (also solved independently by Choi) that\nevery 2-positive linear map from M3 to M3 is decomposable.\n", "  Claude Shannons information theory (1949) has had a revolutionary impact on\ncommunication science. A crucial property of his framework is that it decouples\nthe meaning of a message from the mechanistic details from the actual\ncommunication process itself, which opened the way to solve long-standing\ncommunication problems. Here we argue that a similar impact could be expected\nby applying information theory in the context of complexity science to answer\nlong-standing, cross-domain questions about the nature of complex systems. This\nhappens by decoupling the domain-specific model details (e.g., neuronal\nnetworks, ecosystems, flocks of birds) from the cross-domain phenomena that\ncharacterize complex systems (e.g., criticality, robustness, tipping points).\nThis goes beyond using information theory as a non-linear correlation measure,\nnamely it allows describing a complex system entirely in terms of the storage,\ntransfer, and modification of informational bits. After all, a phenomenon that\ndoes not depend on model details should best be studied in a framework that\nstrips away all such details. We highlight the first successes of\ninformation-theoretic descriptions in the recent complexity literature, and\nemphasize that this type of research is still in its infancy. Finally we sketch\nhow such an information-theoretic description may even lead to a new type of\nuniversality among complex systems, with a potentially tremendous impact. The\ngoal of this perspective article is to motivate a paradigm shift in the young\nfield of complexity science using a lesson learnt in communication science.\n", "  In this paper, we review the preliminary results on the propagation effects\nand interplanetary consequences of fast and wide coronal mass ejection (CME)\nevents, occurred during 18--25 June 2015, in the Sun-Earth distance range. The\ninterplanetary scintillation (IPS) images reveal that the large-scale\nstructures of CME-driven disturbances filled nearly the entire inner\nheliosphere with a range of speeds, $\\sim$300--1000 {\\kmps}. The comparison of\nspeed data sets, from IPS technique results in the inner heliosphere and {\\it\nin-situ} measurements at 1 AU, indicates that the drag force imposed by the\nlow-speed wind dominated heliosphere on the propagation of CMEs may not be\neffective. The arrival of shocks at 1 AU suggests that a shock can be driven in\nthe interplanetary medium by the central part of the moving CME and also by a\ndifferent part away from its centre. The increased flux of proton at energies\n$>$10 MeV is consistent with the acceleration of particles by the shock ahead\nof the CME.\n", "  Till now the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the reversed field pinch\n(RFP) has been performed by assuming axis-symmetric radial time independent\ndissipation profiles. In helical states this assumption is not correct since\nthese dissipations should be flux functions, and should exhibit a helical\nsymmetry as well. Therefore more correct simulations should incorporate\nself-consistent dissipation profiles. As a first step in this direction, the\ncase of uniform dissipation profiles was considered by using the 3D nonlinear\nvisco-resistive MHD code SpeCyl. It is found that a flattening of the\nresistivity profile results in the reduction of the dynamo action, which brings\nto marginally-reversed or even non-reversed equilibrium solutions. The physical\norigin of this result is discussed in relation to the electrostatic drift\nexplanation of the RFP dynamo. This sets constraints on the functional choice\nof dissipations in future self-consistent simulations.\n", "  The effect of magnetic perturbations (MPs) on the helical self-organization\nof shaped tokamak plasmas is discussed in the framework of the nonlinear 3D MHD\nmodel. Numerical simulations performed in toroidal geometry with the\n\\textsc{pixie3d} code [L. Chac\\'on, Phys. Plasmas {\\bf 15}, 056103 (2008)] show\nthat $n=1$ MPs significantly affect the spontaneous quasi-periodic sawtoothing\nactivity of such plasmas. In particular, the mitigation of sawtooth\noscillations is induced by $m/n=1/1$ and $2/1$ MPs. These numerical findings\nprovide a confirmation of previous circular tokamak simulations, and are in\nagreement with tokamak experiments in the RFX-mod and DIII-D devices. Sawtooth\nmitigation via MPs has also been observed in reversed-field pinch simulations\nand experiments. The effect of MPs on the stochastization of the edge magnetic\nfield is also discussed.\n", "  An increasing number of countries and institutions are investing in\nlarge-scale research infrastructures (RIs) and in basic research. Scientific\ndiscoveries, which are expected thanks to RIs, may have a non-use value, in\nanalogy with environmental and cultural public goods. This paper provides, for\nthe first time, an empirical estimation of the willingness to pay (WTP) for\ndiscoveries in basic research by the general public. We focus on the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC), the largest particle accelerator worldwide, where in\n2012 the Higgs boson was discovered. Nobody knows the practical value of such\ndiscovery, beyond knowledge per se. The findings of our study are based on a\ndichotomous choice contingent valuation (CV) survey carried out in line with\nthe NOAA guidelines. The survey involved 1,022 undergraduate students enrolled\nin more than 30 different degrees (including the humanities) at five\nuniversities located in four countries (Italy, France, Spain, UK). We ask two\nmain research questions: Which are the determinants of the WTP for the LHC\ndiscoveries? What is the average contribution that the respondents would be\nwilling to pay? Our results confirm that income, interest and attitudes towards\nbasic research are positively associated with the WTP, while other potential\nexplanatory variables play a limited role. The estimated mean of WTP for basic\nresearch in particle physics is EUR 7.7 per person una-tantum. Although this is\na small amount compared to other CV studies for environmental and cultural\ngoods, it points to positive social attitudes for basic science as a public\ngood.\n", "  Two majorana Fermions (MFs) localized at the two ends of the topological\nsuperconducting wire can interfere with each other and form the well known\n$4\\pi$ Josephson current. We reveal that the density of states (Dos) for the\nelectron part and the hole part also follow a parity correlated $4\\pi$ period\noscillation, while the Dos displays a $2\\pi$ period oscillation when two\ntrivial states interfere with each other. Thus, the period of Dos oscillation\ncan be used to distinguish the MFs from the trivial localized states.\nInterestingly, such phenomena can be directly observed in a short\nsuperconducting wire controlled by the gate voltage. This largely simplifies\nthe experimental setup. We suggest that the interference effects can be\ndetected through two STM leads or two norm leads.\n", "  Recent experiments reveal that the strained bulk HgTe can be regard as a\nthree-dimensional topological insulator (TI). Motivated by this, we explore the\nstrain effects on the magnetotransport properties of the HgTe surface states at\nmagnetic field. We analytically derive the zero frequency Hall and collisional\nconductivities, and find that the substrate induced strain associated with the\nsurface index of carriers, can result in the well seperated surface quantum\nHall plateaus and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. These effects can be used to\ngenerate and detect surface polarization.\n", "  This thesis presents insights into the surface compositional heterogeneity\nand geology of asteroid Vesta. Lithologic mapping using Framing Camera onboard\nthe NASA Dawn spacecraft revealed that the majority of the surface is\nhowarditic in composition (Thangjam et al. 2013). An important outcome of this\nthesis is identification of olivine-rich exposures for the first time using FC\ncolor data (Thangjam et al., 2014). Another significant contribution from this\nthesis is an innovative three-dimensional approach of spectral analysis that\ncould be used to study surface compositional heterogeneity of Vesta (Thangjam\net al., 2016). The three band parameter space with defined polyhedrons is more\nadvanced and robust compared to the generally used two-dimensional spectral\nanalysis i.e., two band parameter space. A revised petrologic evolution model\nis presented to explain the ongoing problem of missing olivine-rich mantle of\nVesta and also the petrogenesis of HED meteorites (howardite, eucrite,\ndiogenite clan of stony achondrites).\n", "  The paper summarizes elements of theories and computational methods that we\nhave constructed and applied over the years for the nonperturbative solution of\nmany electron problems, in the absence or presence of strong external fields,\nconcerning resonance and nonstationary states with a variety of electronic\nstructures.\n", "  Let L be a positive line bundle over a projective complex manifold X.\nConsider the space of holomorphic sections of the tensor power of order p of L.\nThe determinant of a basis of this space, together with some given probability\nmeasure on a weighted compact set in X, induces naturally a beta-ensemble,\ni.e., a random point process on the compact set. Physically, this general\nsetting corresponds to a gas of free fermions in X and may admit some random\nmatrix models. The empirical measures, associated with such beta-ensembles,\nconverge almost surely to an equilibrium measure when p goes to infinity. We\nestablish a large deviations principle (LDP) with an effective speed of\nconvergence for these empirical measures. Our study covers the case of some\nbeta-ensembles on a compact subset of a real sphere or of a real Euclidean\nspace.\n", "  This paper presents the results and the lessons learned on how to apply\nex-ante CBQ for major RDI infrastructures by a team of economists and\nscientists at the University of Milan and CSIL during a three-year research\nproject supported by a EIBURS grant of the European Investment Bank Institute.\nAlbeit the comprehensive conceptual framework presented in the paper builds on\nprinciples firmly rooted in CBA tradition, their application to the RDI sector\nis still in its infancy. So far, the model has been applied on two cases in\nphysics involving particle accelerators (the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at\nCERN and the National Centre for Oncological Treatment, CNAO, in Italy).\n", "  The integration of heavy scalar fields is discussed in a class of BSM models,\ncontaining more that one representation for scalars and with mixing. The\ninterplay between integrating out heavy scalars and the Standard Model\ndecoupling limit is examined. In general, the latter cannot be obtained in\nterms of only one large scale and can only be achieved by imposing further\nassumptions on the couplings. Systematic low-energy expansions are derived in\nthe more general, non-decoupling scenario, including mixed tree-loop and mixed\nheavy-light generated operators. The number of local operators is larger than\nthe one usually reported in the literature.\n", "  We give a rigorous proof for the linear stability of the Skyrmion. In\naddition, we provide new proofs for the existence of the Skyrmion and the GGMT\nbound.\n", "  In this paper we present a mathematical analysis of thin film flow and heat\ntransfer to a laminar liquid film from a horizontal stretching sheet. The flow\nof thin liquid film and subsequent heat transfer from the stretching surface is\ninvestigated with the aid of similarity transformations. Similarity\ntransformations are used to convert unsteady boundary layer equations to a\nsystem of non-linear ordinary differential equations. The resulting non-linear\ndifferential equations are solved numerically using Runge-kutta-Fehlberg and\nNewton-Raphson schemes. A relationship between film thickness $\\beta$ and the\nunsteadiness parameter $S$ is found, the effect of unsteadiness parameter $S$,\nand the Prandtl number $Pr$, Magnetic field parameter $Mn$, Radiation parameter\n$Nr$ and viscous dissipation parameter $Ec$ and heat source parameter $\\gamma$\non the temperature distributions are presented and discussed in detail. Present\nanalysis shows that the combined effect of magnetic field, thermal radiation,\nheat source and viscous dissipation. The results which form special case of the\npresent study are in excellent agreement with the results reported in the\nliterature.\n", "  The simplest way to obtain thin carbon layers is to draw or rub with a\ngraphite rod. During rubbing, forces of friction acting in graphite/substrate\ntribological system cause drastic changes in the structure of the interface\nstratum developing thereby stable self-organized and ordered thin structure. We\npresent a pioneering experimental investigation of structural and morphological\ntransformations in carbon tribolayers (CTL). By optical microscopy observation\nit is found that CTL is a multilayer structure, the essential building block of\nwhich is a transparent phase shaped as a lamina in-between the surface and\nbottom disordered layers of CTL. The surface of the lamina exhibits non-linear\nelectrical conductivity near zero bias on I-V characteristics. The optical\nproperties of the whole CTL are mostly controlled by physical processes\noccurring in the transparent lamina. The Raman spectrum of CTL contains narrow\nbands at 1,589 cm-1 and 1,346 cm-1 corresponding to G and D bands of carbon\ncrystal lattice. The observed features are interpreted using the relationship\nbetween the bond length and corresponding band frequency, r2{\\omega}= const.\nOptical absorption of CTL has a feature at 4.6 eV originating from strong\nelectron-hole interaction. From comparative analysis of experimental data,\nstructural-spectral correspondence is found. It is concluded that because of\nphase transformation during rubbing, a carbon structure consisting of sp3\nlamina with a nano-scaled thick sp2 layer on the top is shaped.\n", "  We study the efficiency of modulated laser pulses to produce efficient and\nfast charge localization transitions in a two-electron double quantum dot. We\nuse a configuration interaction method to calculate the electronic structure of\na quantum dot model within the effective mass approximation. The interaction\nwith the electric field of the laser is considered within the dipole\napproximation and optimal control theory is applied to design high-fidelity\nultrafast pulses in pristine samples. We assessed the influence of the presence\nof Coulomb charged impurities on the efficiency and speed of the pulses. A\nprotocol based on a two-step optimization is proposed for preserving both\nadvantages of the original pulse. The processes affecting the charge\nlocalization is explained from the dipole transitions of the lowest lying\ntwo-electron states, as described by a discrete model with an effective\nelectron-electron interaction.\n", "  The interband optical response of a three-dimensional Dirac cone is linear in\nphoton energy ($\\Omega$). Here, we study the evolution of the interband\nresponse within a model Hamiltonian which contains Dirac, Weyl and gapped\nsemimetal phases. In the pure Dirac case, a single linear dependence is\nobserved, while in the Weyl phase, we find two quasilinear regions with\ndifferent slopes. These regions are also distinct from the large-$\\Omega$\ndependence. As the boundary between the Weyl (WSM) and gapped phases is\napproached, the slope of the low-$\\Omega$ response increases, while the\nphoton-energy range over which it applies decreases. At the phase boundary, a\nsquare root behaviour is obtained which is followed by a gapped response in the\ngapped semimetal phase. The density of states parallels these behaviours with\nthe linear law replaced by quadratic behaviour in the WSM phase and the square\nroot dependence at the phase boundary changed to $|\\omega|^{3/2}$. The optical\nspectral weight under the intraband (Drude) response at low temperature ($T$)\nand/or small chemical potential ($\\mu$) is found to change from $T^2$ ($\\mu^2$)\nin the WSM phase to $T^{3/2}$ ($|\\mu|^{3/2}$) at the phase boundary.\n", "  We critically discuss the measure of very short time intervals. By means of a\nGedankenexperiment, we describe an ideal clock based on the occurrence of\ncompletely random events. Many previous thought experiments have suggested\nfundamental Planck-scale limits on measurements of distance and time. Here we\npresent a new type of thought experiment, based on a different type of clock,\nthat provide further support for the existence of such limits. We show that the\nminimum time interval $\\Delta t$ that this clock can measure scales as the\ninverse of its size $\\Delta r$. This implies an uncertainty relation between\nspace and time: $\\Delta r$ $\\Delta t$ $> G \\hbar / c^4$; where G, $\\hbar$ and c\nare the gravitational constant, the reduced Planck constant, and the speed of\nlight, respectively. We outline and briefly discuss the implications of this\nuncertainty conjecture.\n", "  Quantum photonic chips, which integrate quantum light sources alongside\nactive and passive optical elements, as well as single photon detectors, show\ngreat potential for photonic quantum information processing and quantum\ntechnology. Mature semiconductor nanofabrication processes allow for scaling\nsuch photonic integrated circuits to on-chip networks of increasing complexity.\nSecond order nonlinear materials are the method of choice for generating\nphotonic quantum states in the overwhelming part of linear optic experiments\nusing bulk components but integration with waveguide circuitry on a\nnanophotonic chip proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate such an on-chip\nparametric down-conversion source of photon pairs based on second order\nnonlinearity in an Aluminum nitride microring resonator. We show the potential\nof our source for quantum information processing by measuring high-visibility\nantibunching of heralded single photons with nearly ideal state purity. Our\ndown conversion source operates with high brightness and low noise, yielding\npairs of correlated photons at MHz-rates with high coincidence-to-accidental\nratio. The generated photon pairs are spectrally far separated from the pump\nfield, providing good potential for realizing sufficient on-chip filtering and\nmonolithic integration of quantum light sources, waveguide circuits and single\nphoton detectors.\n", "  For many emerging optoelectronic materials, heteroepitaxial growth techniques\ndo not offer the same high material quality afforded by bulk, single-crystal\ngrowth. However, the need for optical, electrical, or mechanical isolation at\nthe nanoscale level often necessitates the use of a dissimilar substrate, upon\nwhich the active device layer stands. Faraday cage angled-etching (FCAE)\nobviates the need for these planar, thin-film technologies by enabling in-situ\ndevice release and isolation through an angled-etching process. By placing a\nFaraday cage around the sample during inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion\netching (ICP-RIE), the etching plasma develops an equipotential at the cage\nsurface, directing ions normal to its face. In this Article, the effects\nFaraday cage angle, mesh size, and sample placement have on etch angle,\nuniformity, and mask selectivity are investigated within a silicon etching\nplatform. Simulation results qualitatively confirm experiments and help to\nclarify the physical mechanisms at work. These results will help guide FCAE\nprocess design across a wide range of material platforms.\n", "  Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering are performed on atomic layers of\nhexagonal molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), a prototypical transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductor. The data reveal all six types of zone\ncenter optical phonons, along with their corresponding Davydov splittings,\nwhich have been challenging to see in other TMDCs. We discover that the\nanti-Stokes Raman intensity of the low energy layer-breathing mode becomes more\nintense than the Stokes peak under certain experimental conditions, and find\nthe effect to be tunable by excitation frequency and number of atomic layers.\nThese observations are interpreted as a result of resonance effects arising\nfrom the C excitons in the vicinity of the Brillouin zone center in the\nphoton-electron-phonon interaction process.\n", "  It is shown, for the first time, that negative refraction with positive phase\nvelocity refraction can be realized (and controlled) over a wide range of\nfrequency on the first (lowest) pass band of simple photonic and phononic\ncrystals. First a unified approach is presented to accurately, efficiently, and\nuniquely produce the homogenized effective material properties of doubly\nperiodic phononic crystals for anti-plane shear (SH) and photonic crystals for\ntransverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) electromagnetic\nBloch-form waves in such a manner that they exactly reproduce the band\nstructure of the composite over any desired frequency band. Then the\ncorrespondence between phononic and photonic field equations is established and\ntheir effective homogenized material parameters are calculated. Finally\nillustrative examples are worked out for each case, revealing a rich body of\nrefractive characteristics of these crystals, and showing by means of these\nexamples that the homogenized effective parameters do yield the exact results,\nand that the resulting homogenized medium does in fact embody exactly the\nactual band structure and dispersive properties of the considered\nphononic/photonic crystal. As a consequence when the homogenized medium is\nplaced in contact with a normal homogeneous half-space, it could display, even\non the first pass band, positive, negative, or even no energy refraction\ndepending on the frequency and wave vector of plane waves incident from the\nnormal homogeneous solid to the interface.\n"]}
