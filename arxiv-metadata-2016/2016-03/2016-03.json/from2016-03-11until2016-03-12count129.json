We\nexpress the dynamical quantities using a coordinate system defined by the three\nmutually orthogonal vectors; the total momentum\n$\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{p_f}+\\mathbf{p_i}$, the momentum transfer\n$\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{p_f-p_i}$, and $\\mathbf{l}=\\mathbf{k\\times q}$. We show\nthat this leads to an alternative symmetric description of the conservation of\nhelicity in a static magnetic field at first order. In particular, we show that\nhelicity conservation in the transition can be viewed as the invariance of the\ncomponent of the spin along $\\mathbf{k}$, and the flipping of its component\nalong $\\mathbf{q}$, just as what happens to the momentum vector of a ball\nbouncing off a wall. We also derive a \"plug and play\" formula for the\ntransition matrix element where the only reference to the specific field\nconfiguration, and the incident and outgoing momenta is through the kinematical\nfactors multiplying a general matrix element that is independent of the\nspecific vector potential present.\n", "  We report a theoretical low-field magnetotransport study unveiling the effect\nof pseudospin in realistic models of weakly disordered graphene-based\nmaterials. Using an efficient Kubo computational method, and simulating the\neffect of charges trapped in the oxide, different magnetoconductance\nfingerprints are numerically obtained in system sizes as large as 0.3\nmicronmeter squared, containing tens of millions of carbon atoms. In\ntwo-dimensional graphene, a strong valley mixing is found to irreparably yield\na positive magnetoconductance (weak localization), whereas crossovers from\npositive to a negative magnetoconductance (weak antilocalization) are obtained\nby reducing disorder strength down to the ballistic limit. In sharp contrast,\ngraphene nanoribbons with lateral size as large as 10nm show no sign of weak\nantilocalization, even for very small disorder strength. Our results\nrationalize the emergence of a complex phase diagram of magnetoconductance\nfingerprints, shedding some new light on the microscopical origin of pseudospin\neffects.\n", "  This paper concerns some novel features of maximal parabolic Eisenstein\nseries at certain special values of their analytic parameter s. These series\narise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy\nexpansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory\nreduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d<8. For each d these amplitudes\nare automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular\nsignificance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when\nexpanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain\nlimits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety\nof instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In\nparticular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly\nfewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the\nnext-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and\nhence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic\ntheta-functions.\n", "  Multiferroics, where two or more ferroic order parameters coexist, is one of\nthe hottest fields in condensed matter physics and materials science[1-9].\nHowever, the coexistence of magnetism and conventional ferroelectricity is\nphysically unfavoured[10]. Recently several remedies have been proposed, e.g.,\nimproper ferroelectricity induced by specific magnetic[6] or charge orders[2].\nGuiding by these theories, currently most research is focused on frustrated\nmagnets, which usually have complicated magnetic structure and low magnetic\nordering temperature, consequently far from the practical application. Simple\ncollinear magnets, which can have high magnetic transition temperature, have\nnever been considered seriously as the candidates for multiferroics. Here, we\nargue that actually simple interatomic magnetic exchange interaction already\ncontains a driving force for ferroelectricity, thus providing a new microscopic\nmechanism for the coexistence and strong coupling between ferroelectricity and\nmagnetism. We demonstrate this mechanism by showing that even the simplest\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator MnO, can display a magnetically induced\nferroelectricity under a biaxial strain.\n", "  We consider the motion of point masses given by a natural extension of\nNewtonian gravitation to spaces of constant positive curvature. Our goal is to\nexplore the spectral stability of tetrahedral orbits of the corresponding\n4-body problem in the 2-dimensional case, a situation that can be reduced to\nstudying the motion of the bodies on the unit sphere. We first perform some\nextensive and highly precise numerical experiments to find the likely regions\nof stability and instability, relative to the values of the masses and to the\nlatitude of the position of three equal masses. Then we support the numerical\nevidence with rigorous analytic proofs in the vicinity of some limit cases in\nwhich certain masses are either very large or negligible, or the latitude is\nclose to zero.\n", "  The dominant understanding of Internet censorship posits that blocking access\nto foreign-based websites creates isolated communities of Internet users. We\nquestion this discourse for its assumption that if given access people would\nuse all websites. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates access\nblockage with social structures to explain web users' choices, and argue that\nusers visit websites they find culturally proximate and access blockage matters\nonly when such sites are blocked. We examine the case of China, where online\nblockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese web usage patterns\nwith those elsewhere. Analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited\nwebsites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography.\nChinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such\ngeo-linguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and degree of\nisolation. Our sociological investigation reveals a greater role of cultural\nproximity than access blockage in explaining online behaviors.\n", "  Effects invoked by the passage of the cosmic string through the Earth are\ninvestigated. The cosmic string induces global oscillations of the Earth whose\namplitude and acceleration both linearly depend on the string line density. For\nthe line density maximally allowed by the cosmic observations, the oscillations\nare perceivable even to human beings and may cause serious damages to the\nenvironment. Use of the sophisticated accelerograph enables us to detect the\nstring of a line density down to ten orders of magnitude smaller than the\ncosmologically relevant value.\n", "  Metabolite analysis of peritoneal dialysis (PD) effluent may provide\ninformation regarding onset and progression of complications associated with\nprolonged PD therapy. In this context, the NMR detectable small metabolites of\nPD effluent samples were characterized using high resolution 1H and 1H-13C NMR\nspectroscopy. The various spectra were recorded (at 800 MHz proton frequency)\non PD effluent samples obtained after 4 hour (intraperitoneal) dwell time from\npatients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) and continuing normally on PD\ntherapy. Inspite of devastating spectral feature of PD effluent due to the\npresence of intense resonances from glucose and lactate, we were able to\nidentify about 53 small endogenous metabolites (including many complex coupled\nspin systems) and more than 90 % of the total CH cross peaks of 1H-13C HSQC\nspectrum were identified specific to various metabolites of PD effluent. We\nforesee that the characteristic fingerprints of various metabolites of control\nPD effluent samples will be used to identify and distinguish metabolic\ndifferences from PD related complications.\n", "  Assignment of protein backbone resonances is most routinely carried out using\ntriple resonance three dimensional NMR experiments involving amide 1H and 15N\nresonances. However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical\nproteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment\nbecomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In\nthis backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment\n-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the\nsequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR\nexperiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from\nthe joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity\ninvolved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and\nHi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks. The experiment -encoding 5D spectral\ninformation- leads to a conventional 3D spectrum with significantly reduced\nspectral crowding and complexity. The improvisation is based on the fact that\nthe linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical\nshifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral\nrange and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.\nTaken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D\nNMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and\n13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve\nthe nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time\nefficient manner. The performance of the experiment and application of the\nmethod have been demonstrated here using a 15.4 kDa size folded protein and a\n12 kDa size unfolded protein.\n", "  The ratchet phenomenon is a means to get directed transport without net\nforces. Originally conceived to rectify stochastic motion and describe\noperational principles of biological motors, the ratchet effect can be used to\nachieve controllable coherent quantum transport. This transport is an\ningredient of several perspective quantum devices including atomic chips. Here\nwe examine coherent transport of ultra-cold atoms in a rocking quantum ratchet.\nThis is realized by loading a rubidium atomic Bose-Einstein condensate into a\nperiodic optical potential subjected to a biharmonic temporal drive. The\nachieved long-time coherence allows us to resolve resonance enhancement of the\natom transport induced by avoided crossings in the Floquet spectrum of the\nsystem. By tuning the strength of the temporal modulations, we observe a\nbifurcation of a single resonance into a doublet. Our measurements reveal the\nrole of interactions among Floquet eigenstates for quantum ratchet transport.\n", "  Detection of the global HI 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of\nReionization is the key science driver for several ongoing ground-based and\nfuture ground/space-based experiments. The crucial spectral features in the\nglobal 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies <100 MHz.\nIn addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts\nlow-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we examine the\neffects of time-varying ionospheric refraction, absorption and thermal emission\nat these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based\nglobal 21 cm experiment. It should be noted that this is the first study of the\neffect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in\nthe ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise\ncharacteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric\ncorruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere. As a result, any\nground based observations of the faint global 21 cm signal are corrupted by\nflicker noise (or \"$1/f$\" noise, where \"$f$\" is the dynamical frequency) which\nscales as $\\nu^{-2}$ (where $\\nu$ is the frequency of observation) in the\npresence of a bright galactic foreground ($\\propto \\nu^{-s}$, where $s$ is\nradio spectral index). Hence, the calibration of the ionosphere for any such\nexperiment is critical. Any attempt to calibrate the ionospheric effects will\nbe subject to the inaccuracies in the current ionospheric measurements using\nGPS ionospheric measurements, riometer measurements, ionospheric soundings,\netc. Even considering an optimistic improvement in the accuracy of GPS-TEC\n(Total Electron Content) measurements, we conclude that the detection of the\nglobal 21 cm signal below 100 MHz is best done from above the Earth's\natmosphere in orbit of the Moon.\n", "  We consider the 3-body problem in 3-dimensional spaces of nonzero constant\nGaussian curvature and study the relationship between the masses of the\nLagrangian relative equilibria, which are orbits that form a rigidly rotating\nequilateral triangle at all times. There are three classes of Lagrangian\nrelative equilibria in 3-dimensional spaces of constant nonzero curvature:\npositive elliptic and positive elliptic-elliptic, on 3-spheres, and negative\nelliptic, on hyperbolic 3-spheres. We prove that all these Lagrangian relative\nequilibria exist only for equal values of the masses.\n", "  An attempt is made to interpret, in the framework of QCD, the likeness\nbetween the shapes of the neutron-neutron strong and electrostatic interactions\nat the distances $\\sim 1\\div 3$ fm.\n", "  Experimental violations of Bell inequalities are in general vulnerable to\nso-called \"loopholes.\" In this work, we analyse the characteristics of a\nloophole-free Bell test with photons, closing simultaneously the locality,\nfreedom-of-choice, fair-sampling (i.e. detection), coincidence-time, and memory\nloopholes. We pay special attention to the effect of excess predictability in\nthe setting choices due to non-ideal random number generators. We discuss\nnecessary adaptations of the CH/Eberhard inequality when using such imperfect\ndevices and -- using Hoeffding's inequality and Doob's optional stopping\ntheorem -- the statistical analysis in such Bell tests.\n", "  In this work we investigate the asymptotic behavior related to the quantum\nprivacy for multipartite systems. In this context, an inequality for quantum\nprivacy was obtained by exploiting of quantum entropy properties. Subsequently,\nwe derive a lower limit for the quantum privacy through the entanglement\nfidelity. In particular, we show that there is an interval where an increase in\nentanglement fidelity implies a decrease in quantum privacy.\n", "  The flare-productivity of an active region is observed to be related to its\nspatial complexity. Mount Wilson or McIntosh sunspot classifications measure\nsuch complexity but in a categorical way, and may therefore not use all the\ninformation present in the observations. Moreover, such categorical schemes\nhinder a systematic study of an active region's evolution for example. We\npropose fine-scale quantitative descriptors for an active region's complexity\nand relate them to the Mount Wilson classification. We analyze the local\ncorrelation structure within continuum and magnetogram data, as well as the\ncross-correlation between continuum and magnetogram data. We compute the\nintrinsic dimension, partial correlation, and canonical correlation analysis\n(CCA) of image patches of continuum and magnetogram active region images taken\nfrom the SOHO-MDI instrument. We use masks of sunspots derived from continuum\nas well as larger masks of magnetic active regions derived from the magnetogram\nto analyze separately the core part of an active region from its surrounding\npart. We find the relationship between complexity of an active region as\nmeasured by Mount Wilson and the intrinsic dimension of its image patches.\nPartial correlation patterns exhibit approximately a third-order Markov\nstructure. CCA reveals different patterns of correlation between continuum and\nmagnetogram within the sunspots and in the region surrounding the sunspots.\nThese results also pave the way for patch-based dictionary learning with a view\ntowards automatic clustering of active regions.\n", "  The stability of higher-order time derivative theories using the polymer\nextension of quantum mechanics is studied. First, we focus on the well-known\nPais-Uhlenbeck model and by casting the theory into the sum of two decoupled\nThe possibility that fundamental discreteness implicit in a quantum gravity\ntheory may act as a natural regulator for ultraviolet singularities arising in\nquantum field theory has been intensively studied. Here, along the same\nexpectations, we investigate whether a nonstandard representation, called\npolymer representation can smooth away the large amount of negative energy that\nafflicts the Hamiltonians of higher-order time derivative theories; rendering\nthe theory unstable when interactions come into play. We focus on the\nfourth-order Pais-Uhlenbeck model which can be reexpressed as the sum of two\ndecoupled harmonic oscillators one producing positive energy and the other\nnegative energy. As expected, the Schrodinger quantization of such model leads\nto the stability problem or to negative norm states called ghosts. Within the\nframework of polymer quantization we show the existence of new regions where\nthe Hamiltonian can be defined well bounded from below.\n", "  We show that under a general disformal transformation the linear comoving\ncurvature perturbation is not identically invariant, but is invariant on\nsuperhorizon scales for any theory that is disformally related to Horndeski's\ntheory. The difference between disformally related curvature perturbations is\nfound to be given in terms of the comoving density perturbation associated with\na single canonical scalar field. In General Relativity it is well-known that\nthis quantity vanishes on superhorizon scales through the Poisson equation that\nis obtained on combining the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, and we\nconfirm that a similar result holds for any theory that is disformally related\nto Horndeski's scalar-tensor theory so long as the invertibility condition for\nthe disformal transformation is satisfied. We also consider the curvature\nperturbation at full nonlinear order in the unitary gauge, and find that it is\ninvariant under a general disformal transformation if we assume that an\nattractor regime has been reached. Finally, we also discuss the counting of\ndegrees of freedom in theories disformally related to Horndeski's.\n", "  Separating active regions that are quiet from potentially eruptive ones is a\nkey issue in Space Weather applications. Traditional classification schemes\nsuch as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been effective in relating an active\nregion large scale magnetic configuration to its ability to produce eruptive\nevents. However, their qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an\nactive region's evolution for example. We introduce a new clustering of active\nregions that is based on the local geometry observed in Line of Sight\nmagnetogram and continuum images. We use a reduced-dimension representation of\nan active region that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix\ncomprised of local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the\ndefinition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The distances\nobtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the active regions. We\nfind that these metrics result in natural clusterings of active regions. The\nclusterings are related to large scale descriptors of an active region such as\nits size, its local magnetic field distribution, and its complexity as measured\nby the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We also find that including data\nfocused on the neutral line of an active region can result in an increased\ncorrespondence between our clustering results and other active region\ndescriptors such as the Mount Wilson classifications and the $R$ value. We\nprovide some recommendations for which metrics, matrix factorization\ntechniques, and regions of interest to use to study active regions.\n", "  We consider a smooth forward facing step defined by the Gauss error function\nof height 4-30\\% and four times the width of the local boundary layer thickness\n$\\delta_{99}$. The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped\nplate is studied with particular emphasis on stabilisation and destabilisation\nof the Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves and subsequently on transition. The\ninteraction between TS waves at a range of frequencies and a base flow over a\nsingle/two forward facing smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis. The\nresults indicate that for a high frequency TS wave, the amplitude of the TS\nwave is attenuated in the unstable regime of the neutral stability curve\ncorresponding to a flat plate boundary layer. Furthermore, it is observed that\ntwo smooth forward facing steps lead to a more acute reduction of the amplitude\nof the TS wave. When the height of a step is increased to more than 20\\% of the\nlocal boundary layer thickness for a fixed width parameter, the TS wave is\namplified and thereby a destabilisation effect is introduced. Therefore,\nstabilisation or destabilisation effect of a smooth step is typically dependent\non its shape parameters. To validate the results of the linear stability\nanalysis, where a high-frequency TS wave is damped by the forward facing smooth\nsteps direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed. The results of the DNS\ncorrelate favorably with the linear analysis and show that for the investigated\nhigh frequency TS wave, the K-type transition process is altered whereas the\nonset of the H-type transition is postponed. The results of the DNS suggest\nthat for a high-frequency perturbation $\\mathcal{F}=150$ and in the absence of\nother external perturbations, two forward facing steps of height 5\\% and 12\\%\nof the boundary layer thickness delayed H-type transition scenario and\ncompletely suppresses it for the K-type transition.\n", "  Meta learning uses information from base learners (e.g. classifiers or\nestimators) as well as information about the learning problem to improve upon\nthe performance of a single base learner. For example, the Bayes error rate of\na given feature space, if known, can be used to aid in choosing a classifier,\nas well as in feature selection and model selection for the base classifiers\nand the meta classifier. Recent work in the field of f-divergence functional\nestimation has led to the development of simple and rapidly converging\nestimators that can be used to estimate various bounds on the Bayes error. We\nestimate multiple bounds on the Bayes error using an estimator that applies\nmeta learning to slowly converging plug-in estimators to obtain the parametric\nconvergence rate. We compare the estimated bounds empirically on simulated data\nand then estimate the tighter bounds on features extracted from an image patch\nanalysis of sunspot continuum and magnetogram images.\n", "  Efficient processing of particulate products across various manufacturing\nsteps requires that particles possess desired attributes such as size and\nshape. Controlling the particle production process to obtain required\nattributes will be greatly facilitated using robust algorithms providing the\nsize and shape information of the particles from in situ measurements. However,\nobtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has\nbeen a big challenge. This is because the problem of estimating particle size\nand shape (aspect ratio) from signals provided by in-line measuring tools is\noften ill posed, and therefore it calls for appropriate constraints to be\nimposed on the problem. One way to constrain uncertainty in estimation of\nparticle size and shape from in-line measurements is to combine data from\ndifferent measurements such as chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging.\nThis paper presents two different methods for combining imaging and CLD data\nobtained with in-line tools in order to get reliable estimates of particle size\ndistribution and aspect ratio, where the imaging data is used to constrain the\nsearch space for an aspect ratio from the CLD data.\n", "  We investigate the motion of the primary beam outside the light cylinder in\nthe pulsar wind. Inside the light cylinder both primary and secondary plasma\nmove along dipole magnetic field lines where their energies can be arbitrary.\nBut at larger distances the theory predicts quasi-radial motion with the\nvelocity exactly corresponding to the drift velocity which cannot be the same\nfor primary and secondary plasma. Hence, the deceleration of the primary beam\nis to take place simultaneously resulting in the acceleration of the secondary\nplasma. We investigate this process in the three-fluid MHD approximation and\ndemonstrate that for most pulsars the energy of the beam remains practically\nunchanged. Only for young radio pulsars (Crab, Vela) essential deceleration up\nto the energy of the secondary plasma takes place outside the fast magnetosonic\nsurface $r_{\\rm F} \\sim (10$-$100) R_{\\rm L}$, the energy of secondary plasma\nitself increasing insufficiently.\n", "  We give sufficient conditions ensuring the strong ergodic property of unique\nmixing for $C^*$-dynamical systems arising from Yang-Baxter-Hecke quantisation.\nWe discuss whether they can be applied to some important cases including\nmonotone, Boson, Fermion and Boolean $C^*$-algebras in a unified version. The\nmonotone and the Boolean cases are treated in full generality, the Bose/Fermi\ncases being already widely investigated. In fact, on one hand we show that the\nset of stationary stochastic processes are isomorphic to a segment in both the\nsituations, on the other hand the Boolean processes enjoy the very strong\nproperty of unique mixing with respect to the fixed point subalgebra and the\nmonotone ones do not\n", "  We present the results of extended theoretical LDA+DMFT calculations for a\nnew iron-pnictide high temperature superconductor NaFeAs compared with the\nrecent high quality angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments on this\nsystem [1]. The universal manifestation of correlation effects in\niron-pnictides is narrowing of conducting bands near the Fermi level. Our\ncalculations demonstrate that for NaFeAs the effective mass is renormalized on\naverage by a factor of the order of 3, in good agreement with ARPES data. This\nis essentially due to correlation effects on Fe-3d orbitals only and no\nadditional interactions with with any kind of Boson modes, as suggested in [1],\nare necessary to describe the experiment. Also we show that ARPES data taken at\nabout 160 eV beam energy most probably corresponds to $k_z=\\pi$ Brillouin zone\nboundary, while ARPES data measured at about 80 eV beam energy rather\nrepresents $k_z=0$. Contributions of different Fe-3d orbitals into spectral\nfunction map are also discussed.\n", "  Experimental design is crucial for inference where limitations in the data\ncollection procedure are present due to cost or other restrictions. Optimal\nexperimental designs determine parameters that in some appropriate sense make\nthe data the most informative possible. In a Bayesian setting this is\ntranslated to updating to the best possible posterior. Information theoretic\narguments have led to the formation of the expected information gain as a\ndesign criterion. This can be evaluated mainly by Monte Carlo sampling and\nmaximized by using stochastic approximation methods, both known for being\ncomputationally expensive tasks. We propose a framework where a lower bound of\nthe expected information gain is used as an alternative design criterion. In\naddition to alleviating the computational burden, this also addresses issues\nconcerning estimation bias. The problem of permeability inference in a large\ncontaminated area is used to demonstrate the validity of our approach where we\nemploy the massively parallel version of the multiphase multicomponent\nsimulator TOUGH2 to simulate contaminant transport and a Polynomial Chaos\napproximation of the forward model that further accelerates the objective\nfunction evaluations. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to a setting\nwhere field measurements are available.\n", "  In this paper, we develop the dressing method to study the exact solutions\nfor the vector sine-Gordon equation. The explicit formulas for one kink and one\nbreather are derived. The method can be used to construct multi-soliton\nsolutions. Two soliton interactions are also studied. The formulas for position\nshift of the kink and position and phase shifts of the breather are given.\nThese quantities only depend on the pole positions of the dressing matrices.\n", "  The covariant density functional theory with a few number of parameters has\nbeen widely used to describe the ground-state and excited-state properties for\nthe nuclei all over the nuclear chart. In order to describe exotic properties\nof unstable nuclei, the contribution of the continuum and its coupling with\nbound states should be treated properly. In this Topical Review, the\ndevelopment of the covariant density functional theory in continuum will be\nintroduced, including the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory, the\nrelativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory in continuum, and the deformed\nrelativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum. Then the descriptions and\npredictions of the neutron halo phenomena in both spherical and deformed nuclei\nwill be reviewed. The diffuseness of the nuclear potentials, nuclear shapes and\ndensity distributions, and the impact of the pairing correlations on nuclear\nsize will be discussed.\n", "  The proposed NEWS apparatus, a spherical detector with a small central\nelectrode sensor operating as a proportional counter, promises to explore new\nswaths of the direct detection parameter space in the GeV and sub-GeV Dark\nMatter particle mass range by employing very light nuclear targets, such as H\nand He, and by taking advantage of a very low (sub-keV) energy threshold. Here\nwe discuss and study two example classes of Dark Matter models that will be\ntested with NEWS: GeV-scale millicharged Dark Matter, and a GeV-Dirac Fermion\nDark Matter model with a light (MeV-GeV) scalar or vector mediator, and\nindicate the physical regions of parameter space the experiment can probe.\n", "  The Hofstadter butterfly is a quantum fractal with a highly complex nested\nset of gaps, where each gap represents a quantum Hall state whose quantized\nconductivity is characterized by topological invariants known as the Chern\nnumbers. Here we obtain simple rules to determine the Chern numbers at all\nscales in the butterfly fractal and lay out a very detailed topological map of\nthe butterfly. Our study reveals the existence of a set of critical points,\neach corresponding to a macroscopic annihilation of orderly patterns of both\nthe positive and the negative Cherns that appears as a fine structure in the\nbutterfly. Such topological collapses are identified with the Van Hove\nsingularities that exists at every band center in the butterfly landscape. We\nthus associate a topological character to the Van Hove anomalies. Finally, we\nshow that this fine structure is amplified under perturbation, inducing quantum\nphase transitions to higher Chern states in the system.\n", "  SDO/EVE provides rich information of the thermodynamic processes of solar\nactivities, particularly of solar flares. Here, we develop a method to\nconstruct thermodynamic spectrum (TDS) charts based on the EVE spectral lines.\nThis tool could be potentially useful to the EUV astronomy to learn the\neruptive activities on the distant astronomical objects. Through several cases,\nwe illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the\nTDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than M5.0-class, and reach the\nfollowing statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft\nX-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have a faster cooling rate. There\nis a power law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates,\nsuggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions.\nSecond, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and\nType II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low\ntemperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares, the drift pattern\nlooks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are\nmore impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak\nintensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with\nthe flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We\nbelieve that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, that\nunsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong\nlate phase found in a confined flare. Besides, with some cases we illustrate\nthe signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and\ntransition region in TDS charts. These results provide new clues to advance our\nunderstanding of the thermodynamic processes of solar flares and associated\nsolar eruptions, e.g., coronal mass ejections.\n", "  In order to describe the velocity and the anaerobic energy of two runners\ncompeting against each other for middle-distance races, we present a\nmathematical model relying on an optimal control problem for a system of\nordinary differential equations. The model is based on energy conservation and\non Newton's second law: resistive forces, propulsive forces and variations in\nthe maximal oxygen uptake are taken into account. The interaction between the\nrunners provides a minimum for staying one meter behind one's competitor. We\nperform numerical simulations and show how a runner can win a race against\nsomeone stronger by taking advantage of staying behind, or how he can improve\nhis personal record by running behind someone else. Our simulations show when\nit is the best time to overtake, depending on the difference between the\nathletes. Finally, we compare our numerical results with real data from the\nmen's 1500 -- m finals of different competitions.\n", "  The identification of phenomena able to pinpoint quantum interference is\nattracting large interest. Indeed, a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel\neffect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an\nimportant leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical\napplications, such as certification of photonic quantum devices, whose\ncomputational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle\ninterference. Quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many\nparticles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the Fourier\ntransformation in the Fock space. In this work we develop a scalable approach\nfor the implementation of quantum fast Fourier transform using 3-D photonic\nintegrated interferometers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique.\nWe observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4-\nand 8-mode optical circuits: the experimental results demonstrate genuine\nquantum interference between the injected photons, thus offering a powerful\ntool for diagnostic of photonic platforms.\n", "  State selective protocols, like entanglement purification, lead to an\nessentially non-linear quantum evolution, unusual in naturally occurring\nquantum processes. Sensitivity to initial states in quantum systems, stemming\nfrom such non-linear dynamics, is a promising perspective for applications.\nHere we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state\nselective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all initial states\nin an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational\npolynomial map, including the example of the Mandelbrot set, can be directly\nrealised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of initial\nstates, the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that\nexponential sensitivity to initial states in any quantum system have to be\nrelated to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially. Our results show\nthat magnifying initial differences of quantum states (a Schr\\\"odinger\nmicroscope) is possible, however, there is a strict bound on the number of\ncopies needed.\n", "  We report anomalous quantum transport features in bilayer graphene in\npresence of a random distribution of structural vacancies. By using an\nefficient real-space Kubo-Greenwood transport methodology, the impact of a\nvarying density of dimer versus non-dimer vacancies is investigated in very\nlarge scale disordered models. While non-dimer vacancies are shown to induce\nlocalization regimes, dimer vacancies result in an unexpected ballistic regime\nwhose energy window surprisingly enlarges with increasing impurity density.\nSuch counterintuitive phenomenon is explained by the formation of an effective\nlinear dispersion in the bilayer bandstructure, which roots in the symmetry\nbreaking effects driven by dimer vacancies, and provides a novel realization of\nDirac semimetals in high dimension.\n", "  Fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, formed by micro-machined mirrors on the\nend-facets of optical fibers, are used in an increasing number of technical and\nscientific applications, where they typically require precise stabilization of\ntheir optical resonances. Here, we study two different approaches to construct\nfiber Fabry-Perot resonators and stabilize their length for experiments in\ncavity quantum electrodynamics with neutral atoms. A piezo-mechanically\nactuated cavity with feedback based on the Pound-Drever-Hall locking technique\nis compared to a novel rigid cavity design that makes use of the high passive\nstability of a monolithic cavity spacer and employs thermal self-locking and\nexternal temperature tuning. Furthermore, we present a general analysis of the\nmode matching problem in fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, which explains the\nasymmetry in their reflective line shapes and has important implications for\nthe optimal alignment of the fiber resonators. Finally, we discuss the issue of\nfiber-generated background photons. We expect that our results contribute\ntowards the integration of high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities into compact\nand robust quantum-enabled devices in the future.\n", "  We study the real-time dynamics of a two-dimensional Anderson--Hubbard model\nusing nonequilibrium self-consistent perturbation theory within the second-Born\napproximation. When compared with exact diagonalization performed on small\nclusters, we demonstrate that for strong disorder this technique approaches the\nexact result on all available timescales, while for intermediate disorder, in\nthe vicinity of the many-body localization transition, it produces\nquantitatively accurate results up to nontrivial times. Our method allows for\nthe treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and\nfor the complete elimination of finite size effects for the times considered.\nWe show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes nonergodic,\nwhile for intermediate disorder strengths and for all accessible time scales\ntransport in the system is strictly subdiffusive. We argue that these results\nare incompatible with a simple percolation picture, but are consistent with the\nheuristic random resistor network model where subdiffusion may be observed for\nlong times until a crossover to diffusion occurs. The prediction of slow\nfinite-time dynamics in a two-dimensional interacting and disordered system can\nbe directly verified in future cold atoms experiments\n", "  We use large N-body simulations and empirical scaling relations between dark\nmatter halos, galaxies, and supermassive black holes to estimate the formation\nrates of supermassive black hole binaries and the resulting low-frequency\nstochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We find this GWB to be\nrelatively insensitive ($\\lesssim10\\%$) to cosmological parameters, with only\nslight variation between WMAP5 and Planck cosmologies. We find that uncertainty\nin the astrophysical scaling relations changes the amplitude of the GWB by a\nfactor of $\\sim 2$. Current observational limits are already constraining this\npredicted range of models. We investigate the Poisson variance in the amplitude\nof the GWB for randomly-generated populations of supermassive black holes,\nfinding a scatter of order unity per frequency bin below 10 nHz, and increasing\nto a factor of $\\sim 10$ near 100 nHz. This variance is a result of the rarity\nof the most massive binaries, which dominate the signal, and acts as a\nfundamental uncertainty on the amplitude of the underlying power law spectrum.\nThis Poisson uncertainty dominates at $\\gtrsim 20$ nHz, while at lower\nfrequencies the dominant uncertainty is related to our poor understanding of\nthe astrophysical scaling relations, although very low frequencies may be\ndominated by uncertainties related to the final parsec problem and the\nprocesses which drive binaries to the gravitational wave dominated regime.\nCosmological effects are negligible at all frequencies.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the full system of incompressible liquid crystals,\nas modeled in the Q-tensor framework. The main purpose is to establish the\nuniqueness of weak solutions in a two dimensional setting, without imposing an\nextra regularity on the solutions themselves. This result only requires the\ninitial data to fulfill the features which allow the existence of a weak\nsolution. Thus, we also present a revisit of the global existence result in\ndimension two and three.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered the interplay between phase transitions and\nconfiguration mixing of intruder excitations in the 118-128Te isotopes. A\ntransitional interacting boson model Hamiltonian in both IBM-1 and IBM-2\nversions which are based on affine Lie Algebra are employed to describe the\nevolution from spherical to deformed gamma unstable shapes along the chain of\nTe isotopes. The excitation energies, B(E0) and B(E2) transition rates are\nrather well reproduced in comparison with experimental counterparts when the\nweight of SO(6) limit is increased in Hamiltonian. Also our results show\nobvious relations between the configuration mixing ratio and quadrupole,\nhexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole deformation values in this isotopic chain.\n", "  I investigate a discrete model of quantum gravity on a causal null-lattice\nwith \\SLC structure group. The description is geometric and foliates in a\ncausal and physically transparent manner. The general observables of this model\nare constructed from local Lorentz symmetry considerations only. For smooth\nconfigurations, the local lattice actions reduce to the Hilbert-Palatini\naction, a cosmological term and the three topological terms of dimension four\nof Pontyagin, Euler and Nieh-Yan. Consistency conditions for a topologically\nhypercubic complex with null 4-simplexes are derived and a topological lattice\ntheory that enforces these non-local constraints is constructed. The lattice\nintegration measure is derived from an \\SLC-invariant integration measure by\nlocalization of the non-local structure group. This measure is unique up to a\ndensity that depends on the local 4-volume. It can be expressed in terms of\nmanifestly coordinate invariant geometrical quantities. The density provides an\ninvariant regularization of the lattice integration measure that suppresses\nconfigurations with small local 4-volumes. Amplitudes conditioned on geodesic\ndistances between local observables have a physical interpretation and may have\na smooth ultraviolet limit. Numerical studies on small lattices in the\nunphysical strong coupling regime of large imaginary cosmological constant\nsuggest that this model of triangulated causal manifolds is finite. Two\ntopologically different triangulations of space-time are discussed: a single,\ncausally connected universe and a duoverse with two causally disjoint connected\ncomponents. In the duoverse, two hypercubic sublattices are causally disjoint\nbut the local curvature depends on fields of both sublattices. This may\nsimulate effects of dark matter in the continuum limit.\n", "  We discuss (2+1)D topological phases on non-orientable spatial surfaces, such\nas M\\\"obius strip, real projective plane and Klein bottle, etc., which are\nobtained by twisting the parent topological phases by their underlying pairty\nsymmetries through introducing parity defects. We construct the ground states\non arbitrary non-orientable closed manifolds and calculate the ground state\ndegeneracy. Such degeneracy is shown to be robust against continuous\ndeformation of the underlying manifold. We also study the action of the mapping\nclass group on the multiplet of ground states on the Klein bottle. The physical\nproperties of the topological states on non-orientable surfaces are deeply\nrelated to the parity symmetric anyons which do not have a notion of\norientation in their statistics. The number of ground states on the projective\nplane equals the root of the number of distinguishable parity symmetric anyons,\nwhile the ground state degeneracy on the Klein bottle equals the total number\nof parity symmetric anyons; In deforming the Klein bottle, the Dehn twist\nencodes the topological spins whereas the Y-homeomorphism tells the\nparticle-hole relation of the parity symmetric anyons.\n", "  We present a parameter estimation technique based on performing joint\nmeasurements of a weak interaction away from the weak-value-amplification\napproximation. Two detectors are used to collect full statistics of the\ncorrelations between two weakly entangled degrees of freedom. Without the need\nof postselection, the protocol resembles the anomalous amplification of an\nimaginary-weak-value-like response. The amplification is induced in the\ndifference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of\ntechnical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals\nfor precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of\ninterest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the proposed technique by measuring polarization\nrotations in a linearly polarized laser pulse. The effective sensitivity and\nprecision of a split detector is increased when compared to a conventional\ncontinuous-wave balanced detection technique.\n", "  We report new simulations of cooling of compact stars containing quark cores\nand updated fits to the Cas A fast cooling data. Our model is built on the\nassumption that the transient behaviour of the star in Cas A is due to a phase\ntransition within the dense QCD matter in the core of the star. Specifically,\nthe fast cooling is attributed to an enhancement in the neutrino emission\ntriggered by a transition from a fully gapped, two-flavor, red-green\ncolor-superconducting quark condensate to a superconducting crystalline or an\nalternative gapless, color-superconducting phase. The blue colored condensate\nis modeled as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type color superconductor with\nspin-one pairing order parameter. We study the sensitivity of the fits to the\nphase transition temperature, the pairing gap of blue quarks and the time-scale\ncharacterizing the phase transition (the latter modelled in terms of a width\nparameter). Relative variations in these parameter around their best fit values\nlarger than $10^{-3}$ spoil the fit to the data. We confirm the previous\nfinding that the cooling curves show significant variations as a function of\ncompact star mass, which allows one to account for dispersion in the data on\nthe surface temperatures of thermally emitting neutron stars.\n", "  The understanding of spin dynamics and relaxation mechanisms in clean\ngraphene and the upper time and length scales on which spin devices can operate\nare prerequisites to realizing graphene spintronic technologies. Here we\ntheoretically reveal the nature of fundamental spin relaxation mechanisms in\nclean graphene on different substrates with spin-orbit Rashba fields as low as\na few tens of micron eV. Spin lifetimes ranging from 50 picoseconds up to\nseveral nanoseconds are found to be dictated by substrate-induced electron-hole\ncharacteristics. A crossover in the spin relaxation mechanism from a\nDyakonov-Perel type for SiO2 substrates to a broadening-induced dephasing for\nhBN substrates is described. The energy dependence of spin lifetimes, their\nratio for spins pointing out-of-plane and in-plane, and the scaling with\ndisorder provide a global picture about spin dynamics and relaxation in\nultraclean graphene in presence of electron-hole puddles.\n", "  We present an exact treatment of the thermodynamics of physical systems in\nthe framework of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Our purpose is to\nstudy and compare the consequences of two GUPs that one implies a minimal\nlength while the other predicts a minimal length and a maximal momentum. Using\na semiclassical method, we exactly calculate the modified internal energies and\nheat capacities in the presence of generalized commutation relations. We show\nthat the total shift in these quantities only depends on the deformed algebra\nnot on the system under study. Finally, the modified internal energy for an\nspecific physical system such as ideal gas is obtained in the framework of two\ndifferent GUPs.\n", "  In this paper we provide an updated analysis of the neutrino magnetic moments\n(NMMs), discussing both the constraints on the magnitudes of the three\ntransition moments Lambda_i as well as the role of the CP violating phases\npresent both in the mixing matrix and in the NMM matrix. The scattering of\nsolar neutrinos off electrons in Borexino provides the most stringent\nrestrictions, due to its robust statistics and the low energies observed, below\n1 MeV. Our new limit on the effective neutrino magnetic moment which follows\nfrom the most recent Borexino data is 3.1 x 10^-11 mu_B at 90% C.L. This\ncorresponds to the individual transition magnetic moment constraints:\n|Lambda_1| < 5.6 x10^-11 mu_B, |Lambda_2| < 4.0 x 10^-11 mu_B, and |Lambda_3| <\n3.1 x 10^-11 mu_B (90% C.L.), irrespective of any complex phase. Indeed, the\nincoherent admixture of neutrino mass eigenstates present in the solar flux\nmakes Borexino insensitive to the Majorana phases present in the NMM matrix.\nFor this reason we also provide a global analysis including the case of reactor\nand accelerator neutrino sources, and presenting the resulting constraints for\ndifferent values of the relevant CP phases. Improved reactor and accelerator\nneutrino experiments will be needed in order to underpin the full profile of\nthe neutrino electromagnetic properties.\n", "  In this paper, the cosmological implications of the Power Law Entropy\nCorrected Holographic Dark Energy (PLECHDE) and the Logarithmic Entropy\nCorrected Holographic Dark Energy (LECHDE) models in the context of Brans-Dicke\n(BD) cosmology for both non-interacting and interacting DE and Dark Matter (DM)\nare studied. As the system infrared cut-off, we choose the recently proposed\nGranda-Oliveros cut-off, which contains a term proportional to the first time\nderivative of the Hubble parameter and one term proportional to $H^2$, i.e. the\nHubble parameter squared. We obtain the expressions of three quantities, i.e.\nthe Equation of State (EoS) parameter $\\omega_D$, the deceleration parameter\n$q$ and the evolutionary form of the energy density parameter $\\Omega'_D$ of\nthe PLECHDE and LECHDE models in a non-flat Universe for non-interacting and\ninteracting DE and DM as well. Moreover, we investigate the limiting cases\ncorresponding to: a) absence of entropy corrections; b) Einstein's gravity; and\nc) concomitantly absence of entropy corrections and Einstein's gravity.\nFurthermore, we consider the limiting case corresponding to the Ricci scale,\nwhich is recovered for some particular values of the parameters characterizing\nthe Granda-Oliveros scale. We also study the statefinder diagnostic and the\ncosmographic parameters for both models considered in this work.\n", "  The social connections people form online affect the quality of information\nthey receive and their online experience. Although a host of socioeconomic and\ncognitive factors were implicated in the formation of offline social ties, few\nof them have been empirically validated, particularly in an online setting. In\nthis study, we analyze a large corpus of geo-referenced messages, or tweets,\nposted by social media users from a major US metropolitan area. We linked these\ntweets to US Census data through their locations. This allowed us to measure\nemotions expressed in the tweets posted from an area, the structure of social\nconnections, and also use that area's socioeconomic characteristics in\nanalysis. %We extracted the structure of online social interactions from the\npeople mentioned in tweets from that area. We find that at an aggregate level,\nplaces where social media users engage more deeply with less diverse social\ncontacts are those where they express more negative emotions, like sadness and\nanger. Demographics also has an impact: these places have residents with lower\nhousehold income and education levels. Conversely, places where people engage\nless frequently but with diverse contacts have happier, more positive messages\nposted from them and also have better educated, younger, more affluent\nresidents. Results suggest that cognitive factors and offline characteristics\naffect the quality of online interactions. Our work highlights the value of\nlinking social media data to traditional data sources, such as US Census, to\ndrive novel analysis of online behavior.\n", "  We report on a novel Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) geometry involving the\nretroreflection of one of the six MOT beams in order to create an atom cloud\nclose to the surface of a prism which does not have optical access along one\naxis. A MOT of Rb$^{85}$ with $\\sim 4 \\times 10^7$ atoms can be created 700 um\nfrom the surface. The MOT lies close to the minimum of an evanescent\nGravito-Optical Surface Trap (GOST) allowing for transfer into the GOST with\npotentially minimal losses.\n", "  The eigenvector centrality equation $\\lambda x = A \\, x$ is a successful\ncompromise between simplicity and expressivity. It claims that central actors\nare those connected with central others. For at least 70 years, this equation\nhas been explored in disparate contexts, including econometrics, sociometry,\nbibliometrics, Web information retrieval, and network science. We propose an\nequally elegant counterpart: the power equation $x = A x^{\\div}$, where\n$x^{\\div}$ is the vector whose entries are the reciprocal of those of $x$. It\nasserts that power is in the hands of those connected with powerless others. It\nis meaningful, for instance, in bargaining situations, where it is advantageous\nto be connected to those who have few options. We tell the parallel, mostly\nunexplored story of this intriguing equation.\n", "  The design of interplanetary trajectories often involves a preliminary search\nfor options later refined/assembled into one final trajectory. It is this broad\nsearch that, often being intractable, inspires the international event called\nGlobal Trajectory Optimization Competition. In the first part of this chapter,\nwe introduce some fundamental problems of space flight mechanics, building\nblocks of any attempt to participate successfully in these competitions, and we\ndescribe the use of the open source software PyKEP to solve them. In the second\npart, we formulate an instance of a multiple asteroid rendezvous problem,\nrelated to the 7th edition of the competition, and we show step by step how to\nbuild a possible solution strategy. In doing so, we introduce two new\ntechniques useful in the design of this particular mission type: the use of an\nasteroid phasing value and its surrogates and the efficient computation of\nasteroid clusters. We show how the basic building blocks, sided to these\ninnovative ideas, allow designing an effective global search for possible\ntrajectories.\n", "  By using the density matrix renormalization group and mean field methods, the\nanyon Hubbard model is studied systematically on a one dimensional lattice. The\nmodel can be expressed as a Bose-Hubbard model with a density-dependent-phase\nterm. When the phase angle is $\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$, the model will be\nequivalent to boson and pseudo fermion models, respectively. In the mean field\nframe, we find a broken-symmetry superfluid (BSF), in which the\n$b^{\\dagger}(b)$ operators on the nearest neighborhood sites have exactly\nopposite directions and behave like a directed oscillation pattern. By the\ndensity matrix reorganization group method, in the broken-symmetry superfluid,\nboth the real and imaginary parts of the correlation $b^{\\dagger}_ib_{i+r}$\nbehave according to a {\\it beat phenomenon} with $0<\\theta<\\pi$ in the form\n$C_0e^{i k r}(-1)^{r}$ or behave like waves with different wavelengths in the\nform $C_0e^{i k r}$. The distributions of the broken-symmetry superfluid phase\nand other phases are shown in the phase diagrams with different values of\n$\\theta$ and the direct phase transition between the two types of superfluid is\nobserved. The beats phenomenon is explained by double peaks of momentum\ndistribution with two wave numbers ${k}_1$ and ${k}_2$ satisfying the condition\n$\\frac{{k}_1-{k}_2}{{k}_1+{k}_2}<\\frac{1}{3}$, which are expected to be\nobserved in the optical experiments.\n", "  We present optical imaging and spectroscopy of supernova (SN) LSQ13fn, a type\nII supernova with several hitherto-unseen properties. Although it initially\nshowed strong symmetric spectral emission features attributable to\n\\ion{He}{ii}, \\ion{N}{iii}, and \\ion{C}{iii}, reminiscent of some interacting\nSNe, it transitioned into an object that would fall more naturally under a type\nII-Plateau (IIP) classification. However, its spectral evolution revealed\nseveral unusual properties: metal lines appeared later than expected, were\nweak, and some species were conspicuous by their absence. Furthermore, the line\nvelocities were found to be lower than expected given the plateau brightness,\nbreaking the SNe~IIP standardised candle method for distance estimates. We\nfound that, in combination with a short phase of early-time\nejecta-circumstellar material interaction, metal-poor ejecta, and a large\nprogenitor radius could reasonably account for the observed behaviour.\nComparisons with synthetic model spectra of SNe~IIP of a given progenitor mass\nwould imply a progenitor star metallicity as low as 0.1\\,Z$_{\\odot}$. LSQ13fn\nhighlights the diversity of SNe~II and the many competing physical effects that\ncome into play towards the final stages of massive star evolution immediately\npreceding core-collapse.\n", "  We study quantum quenches between integrable and nonintegrable hard-core\nboson models in the thermodynamic limit with numerical linked cluster\nexpansions. We show that while quenches in which the initial state is a thermal\nequilibrium state of an integrable model and the final Hamiltonian is\nnonintegrable (quantum chaotic) lead to thermalization, the reverse is not\ntrue. While this might appear counterintuitive given the fact that the\neigenstates of both Hamiltonians are related by a unitary transformation, we\nargue that it is generic. Hence, the lack of thermalization of integrable\nsystems is robust against quenches starting from stationary states of\nnonintegrable ones. Nonintegrable systems thermalize independently of the\nnature of the initial Hamiltonian.\n", "  We experimentally investigated the characteristics of two-photon transmission\nresonances in Rb vapor cells with different amount of buffer gas under the\nconditions of steady-state coherent population trapping (CPT) and pulsed\nRaman-Ramsey (RR-) CPT interrogation scheme. We particularly focused on the\ninfluence of the Rb atoms diffusing in and out of the laser beam. We showed\nthat this effect modifies the shape of both CPT and Raman-Ramsey resonances, as\nwell as their projected performance for CPT clock applications. In particular\nwe found that at moderate buffer gas pressures RR-CPT did not improved the\nprojected atomic clock stability compare to the regular steady-state CPT\nresonance.\n", "  The pseudogap is a central puzzle of cuprate superconductors. Its connection\nto the Mott insulator at low doping $p$ remains ambiguous and its relation to\nthe charge order that reconstructs the Fermi surface at intermediate $p$ is\nstill unclear. Here we use measurements of the Hall coefficient in magnetic\nfields up to 88 T to show that Fermi-surface reconstruction by charge order in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ ends sharply at a critical doping $p = 0.16$, distinctly\nlower than the pseudogap critical point at $p^* = 0.19$. This shows that\npseudogap and charge order are separate phenomena. We then find that the change\nof carrier density from $n = 1 + p$ in the conventional metal at high p to $n =\np$ at low $p$ - a signature of the lightly doped cuprates - starts at $p^*$.\nThis shows that pseudogap and antiferromagnetic Mott insulator are linked.\n", "  The dynamic coupling effects on fusion cross sections for reactions $^{32}$S\n+ $^{94,96}$Zr and $^{40}$Ca + $^{94,96}$Zr are studied with the universal\nfusion function formalism and an empirical coupled channel (ECC) model. An\nexamination of the reduced fusion functions shows that the total effect of\ncouplings to inelastic excitations and neutron transfer channels on fusion in\n$^{32}$S + $^{94}$Zr ($^{40}$Ca + $^{94}$Zr) is almost the same as that in\n$^{32}$S + $^{96}$Zr ($^{40}$Ca + $^{96}$Zr). The enhancements of the fusion\ncross section at sub-barrier energies due to inelastic channel coupling and\nneutron transfer channel coupling are evaluated separately by using the ECC\nmodel. The results show that effect of couplings to inelastic excitations\nchannels in the reactions with $^{94}$Zr as target should be similar as that in\nthe reactions with $^{96}$Zr as target. This implies that the quadrupole\ndeformation parameters $\\beta_2$ of $^{94}$Zr and $^{96}$Zr should be similar\nto each other. However, $\\beta_2$'s predicted from the finite-range droplet\nmodel, which are used in the ECC model, are quite different. Experiments on\n$^{48}$Ca + $^{94}$Zr or $^{36}$S + $^{94}$Zr are suggested to solve the\npuzzling issue concerning $\\beta_2$ for $^{94}$Zr.\n", "  We study analytically the effect of a weak random chemical potential of zero\naverage in an Einstein-Maxwell background. For uncorrelated disorder this\nperturbation is relevant however we show that it can become marginal or even\nirrelevant by tuning disorder correlations. At zero temperature we find that,\nto leading order in the disorder strength, the correction to the conductivity\nfor irrelevant perturbations vanishes. In the marginal case, in order to\nrenormalize a logarithmic divergence, we carry out a resummation of the\nperturbative expansion of the metric that leads to a Lifshitz-like geometry in\nthe infrared. Disorder in this case also induces a positive correction to the\nconductivity. At finite temperature the black hole acquires an effective charge\nand the thermal conductivity has the expected Drude peak that signals the\nbreaking of translational invariance. However the electric conductivity is not\naffected by the random chemical potential to leading order in the disorder\nstrength.\n", "  The relationship between jet production in the central region and the\nunderlying-event activity in a pseudorapidity-separated region is studied in\n4.0 pb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV $pp$ collision data recorded with the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. The underlying event is characterised through\nmeasurements of the average value of the sum of the transverse energy at large\npseudorapidity downstream of one of the protons, which are reported here as a\nfunction of hard-scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering is\ncharacterised by the average transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the two\nhighest transverse momentum jets in the event. The dijet kinematics are used to\nestimate, on an event-by-event basis, the scaled longitudinal momenta of the\nhard-scattered partons in the target and projectile beam-protons moving toward\nand away from the region measuring transverse energy, respectively. Transverse\nenergy production at large pseudorapidity is observed to decrease with a linear\ndependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton and to\ndepend only weakly on that in the projectile proton. The results are compared\nto the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, which qualitatively\nreproduce the trends observed in data but generally underpredict the overall\nlevel of transverse energy at forward pseudorapidity.\n", "  Considering a \"random walk in a random environment\" in a topologically closed\ncircuit, we explore the implications of the percolation and sliding transitions\nfor its relaxation modes. A complementary question regarding the\n\"delocalization\" of eigenstates of non-hermitian Hamiltonians has been\naddressed by Hatano, Nelson, and followers. But we show that for a conservative\nstochastic process the implied spectral properties are dramatically different.\nIn particular we determine the threshold for under-damped relaxation, and\nobserve \"complexity saturation\" as the bias is increased.\n", "  Planar quantum electrodynamics, in presence of tree-level Chern-Simons term,\nis shown to support bound state excitations, with a threshold, not present for\nthe pure Chern-Simons theory. In the present case, the bound state gets\ndestabilized by vacuum fluctuations. The bound state itself finds justification\nin the duality of the theory with massive topological vector field. Thermal\nfluctuations further destabilize this state, leading to smooth dissociation at\nhigh temperatures. Physical systems are suggested for observing such a bound\nstate.\n", "  We present the quantitative phase diagram of the bilayer bosonic fractional\nquantum Hall system on the torus geometry at total filling factor $\\nu=1$ in\nthe lowest Landau level. We consider short-range interactions within and\nbetween the two layers, as well as the inter-layer tunneling. In the fully\npolarized regime, we provide an updated detailed numerical analysis to\nestablish the presence of the Moore-Read phase of both even and odd numbers of\nparticles. In the actual bilayer situation, we find that both inter-layer\ninteractions and tunneling can provide the physical mechanism necessary for the\nlow-energy physics to be driven by the fully polarized regime, thus leading to\nthe emergence of the Moore-Read phase. Inter-layer interactions favor a\nferromagnetic phase when the system is $SU(2)$ symmetric, while the inter-layer\ntunneling acts as a Zeeman field polarizing the system. Besides the Moore-Read\nphase, the $(220)$ Halperin state and the coupled Moore-Read state are also\nrealized in this model. We study their stability against each other.\n", "  In a slight different way from the previous one, we propose a modified\nnon-Euclidian transformation on the SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) Grassmannian which give the\nprojected SO(2N+1) Tamm-Dancoff equation. We derive a classical time dependent\n(TD) SO(2N+1) Lagrangian which, through the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion\nfor SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset variables, brings another form of the previous\nextended-TD Hartree-Bogoliubov (HB) equation. The SO(2N+1) random phase\napproximation (RPA) is derived using Dyson representation for paired and\nunpaired operators. In the SO(2N) HB case, one boson and two boson excited\nstates are realized. We, however, stress non existence of a higher RPA vacuum.\nAn integrable system is given by a geometrical concept of zero-curvature, i.e.,\nintegrability condition of connection on the corresponding Lie group. From the\ngroup theoretical viewpoint, we show the existence of a symplectic two-form\nomega.\n", "  We investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional system of\nellipsoidal particles carrying a linear quadrupole moment in their center.\nThese particles represent a simple model for a variety of uncharged, non-polar\nconjugated organic molecules. Using optimization tools based on ideas of\nEvolutionary Algorithms, we first examine the ground state structures as we\nvary the aspect ratio of the particles and the pressure. Interestingly, we\nfind, besides the intuitively expected T-like configurations, a variety of\ncomplex structures, characterized with up to three different particle\norientations. In an effort to explore the impact of thermal fluctuations, we\nperform constant-pressure Molecular Dynamics simulations within a range of\nrather low temperatures. We observe that ground state structures formed by\nparticles with a large aspect ratio are in particular suited to withstand\nfluctuations up to rather high temperatures. Our comprehensive investigations\nallow for a deeper understanding of molecular or colloidal monolayer\narrangements under the influence of a typical electrostatic interaction on a\ncoarse-grained level.\n", "  We provide a general formulation for calculating conserved charges for\nsolutions to generally covariant gravitational theories with possibly other\ninternal gauge symmetries, in any dimensions and with generic asymptotic\nbehaviors. These solutions are generically specified by a number of exact\n(continuous, global) symmetries and some parameters. We define \"parametric\nvariations\" as field perturbations generated by variations of the solution\nparameters. Employing the covariant phase space method, we establish that the\nset of these solutions (up to pure gauge transformations) form a phase space,\nthe \\emph{solution phase space}, and that the tangent space of this phase space\nincludes the parametric variations. We then compute conserved charge variations\nassociated with the exact symmetries of the family of solutions, caused by\nparametric variations. Integrating the charge variations over a path in the\nsolution phase space, we define the conserved charges. In particular, we\nrevisit \"black hole entropy as a conserved charge\" and the derivation of the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics. We show that the solution phase space\nsetting enables us to define black hole entropy by an integration over any\ncompact, codminesion-2, smooth spacelike surface encircling the hole, as well\nas to a natural generalization of Wald and Iyer-Wald analysis to cases\ninvolving gauge fields.\n", "  Reversible exchange of photons between a material and an optical cavity can\nlead to the formation of hybrid light--matter states where material properties\nsuch as the work function\\cite{Hutchison_AM2013a}, chemical\nreactivity\\cite{Hutchison_ACIE2012a}, ultra--fast energy relaxation\n\\cite{Salomon_ACIE2009a,Gomez_TJOPCB2012a} and electrical\nconductivity\\cite{Orgiu_NM2015a} of matter differ significantly to those of the\nsame material in the absence of strong interactions with the electromagnetic\nfields. Here we show that strong light--matter coupling between confined\nphotons on a semiconductor waveguide and localised plasmon resonances on metal\nnanowires modifies the efficiency of the photo--induced charge--transfer rate\nof plasmonic derived (hot) electrons into accepting states in the semiconductor\nmaterial. Ultra--fast spectroscopy measurements reveal a strong correlation\nbetween the amplitude of the transient signals, attributed to electrons\nresiding in the semiconductor, and the hybridization of waveguide and plasmon\nexcitations.\n", "  We propose a method of controlling the metal-insulator transition of one\nperovskite material at its interface with a another ferroelectric material\nbased on first principle calculations. The operating principle is that the\nrotation of oxygen octahedra tuned by the ferroelectric polarization can\nmodulate the superexchange interaction in this perovskite. We designed a\ntri-color superlattice of (BiFeO$_3$)$_N$/LaNiO$_3$/LaTiO$_3$, in which the\nBiFeO$_3$ layers are ferroelectric, the LaNiO$_3$ layer is the layer of which\nthe electronic structure is to be tuned, and LaTiO$_3$ layer is inserted to\nenhance the inversion asymmetry. By reversing the ferroelectric polarization in\nthis structure, there is a metal-insulator transition of the LaNiO$_3$ layer\nbecause of the changes of crystal field splitting of the Ni $e_g$ orbitals and\nthe bandwidth of the Ni in-plane $e_g$ orbital. It is highly expected that a\nmetal-transition can be realized by designing the structures at the interfaces\nfor more materials.\n", "  We propose a novel algorithm to compute the width of any generic $n$-body\ndecay involving multiple off-shell particles having zero and non-zero spins.\nStarting from a toy example, we show the computations for three different\nprocesses that contain spin-0, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and 1 off-shell particles. We\nhave checked that our results match with the existing results at the analytical\nlevel. This proposal can be automatized and should be useful to compute the\nphase space for long cascade decays, without any Monte Carlo sampling.\n", "  We present the status of the automation of NLO processes within the event\ngenerator WHIZARD. The program provides an automated FKS subtraction and phase\nspace integration over the FKS regions, while the (QCD) NLO matrix element is\naccessed via the Binoth Les Houches Interface from an externally linked\none-loop program. Massless and massive test cases and validation are shown for\nseveral e+e- processes. Furthermore, we discuss work in progress and future\nplans. The second part covers the matching of the NRQCD prediction with NLL\nthreshold resummation to the NLO continuum top pair production at lepton\ncolliders. Both the S-wave and P-wave production of the top pair are taken into\naccount in the resummation. The inclusion in WHIZARD allows to study more\nexclusive observables than just the total cross section and automatically\naccounts for important electroweak and relativistic corrections in the\nthreshold region.\n", "  A simulation work aiming to study heat transfer coefficient between argon\nfluid flow and copper plate is carried out based on atomistic-continuum hybrid\nmethod. Navier-Stokes equations for continuum domain are solved through the\nPressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm, and the atom\nevolution in molecular domain is solved through the Verlet algorithm. The\nsolver is validated by solving Couette flow and heat conduction problems. With\nboth momentum and energy coupling method applied, simulations on convection of\nargon flows between two parallel plates are performed. The top plate is kept as\na constant velocity and has higher temperature, while the lower one, which is\nmodeled with FCC copper lattices, is also fixed but has lower temperature. It\nis found that, heat transfer between argon fluid flow and copper plate in this\nsituation is much higher than that at macroscopic when the flow is fully\ndeveloped.\n", "  The search for dark matter is one of today's most exciting fields. As bigger\ndetectors are being built to increase their sensitivity, background reduction\nis an ever more challenging issue. To this end, a new type of dark matter\ndetector is proposed, a xenon bubble chamber, which would combine the strengths\nof liquid xenon TPCs, namely event by event energy resolution, with those of a\nbubble chamber, namely insensitivity to electronic recoils. In addition, it\nwould be the first time ever that a dark matter detector is active on all three\ndetection channels, ionization and scintillation characteristic of xenon\ndetectors, and heat through bubble formation in superheated fluids. Preliminary\nsimulations show that, depending on threshold, a discrimination of 99.99\\% to\n99.9999+\\% can be achieved, which is on par or better than many current\nexperiments. A prototype is being built at the University at Albany, SUNY. The\nprototype is currently undergoing seals, thermal, and compression testing.\n", "  P-values are widely used in both the social and natural sciences to quantify\nthe statistical significance of observed results. The recent surge of big data\nresearch has made the p-value an even more popular tool to test the\nsignificance of a study. However, substantial literature has been produced\ncritiquing how p-values are used and understood. In this paper we review this\nrecent critical literature, much of which is routed in the life sciences, and\nconsider its implications for social scientific research. We provide a coherent\npicture of what the main criticisms are, and draw together and disambiguate\ncommon themes. In particular, we explain how the False Discovery Rate is\ncalculated, and how this differs from a p-value. We also make explicit the\nBayesian nature of many recent criticisms, a dimension that is often\nunderplayed or ignored. We conclude by identifying practical steps to help\nremediate some of the concerns identified. We recommend that (i) far lower\nsignificance levels are used, such as $0.01$ or $0.001$, and (ii) p-values are\ninterpreted contextually, and situated within both the findings of the\nindividual study and the broader field of inquiry (through, for example,\nmeta-analyses).\n", "  Following previous work of ours in spherical symmetry, we here propose a new\nparametric framework to describe the spacetime of axisymmetric black holes in\ngeneric metric theories of gravity. In this case, the metric components are\nfunctions of both the radial and the polar angular coordinates, forcing a\ndouble expansion to obtain a generic axisymmetric metric expression. In\nparticular, we use a continued-fraction expansion in terms of a compactified\nradial coordinate to express the radial dependence, while we exploit a Taylor\nexpansion in terms of the cosine of the polar angle for the polar dependence.\nThese choices lead to a superior convergence in the radial direction and to an\nexact limit on the equatorial plane. As a validation of our approach, we build\nparametrized representations of Kerr, rotating dilaton, and\nEinstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The match is already very good at\nlowest order in the expansion and improves as new orders are added. We expect a\nsimilar behavior for any stationary and axisymmetric black-hole metric.\n", "  The role of fluctuations is enhanced in lower dimensionality systems: in a\ntwo dimensions off-diagonal long-range order is destroyed by the fluctuations\nat any finite temperature, drastically modifying the critical properties with\nrespect to the three-dimensional counterpart. Recently two-dimensional systems\nof interacting fermions have been the subject of Montecarlo studies and\nexperimental investigations, in particular an ultracold gas of attractive\nfermions with a widely tunable interaction due to a Feshbach resonance has been\nrealized and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition has been observed.\n  The present work deals with the theoretical description of an ultracold Fermi\ngas: we discuss the role of Gaussian fluctuations of the order parameter in the\nequation of state, in particular we take into account the first sound velocity,\nshowing that the inclusion of order parameter fluctuations is needed in order\nto get the correct composite-boson limit in the strong-coupling regime. The\ntheory is also compared with experimental data. Finally we focus on the\nsuperfluid density in the weak-coupling, intermediate and strong-coupling\nregimes at finite temperature, through which the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature is obtained.\n", "  The physics program accessible in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the Future Circular\nCollider (FCC-ee) is summarized. The FCC-ee aims at collecting multi-ab$^{-1}$\nintegrated luminosities in $e^+e^-$ at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 90, 160, 240, and 350 GeV,\nyielding 10$^{12}$ Z bosons, 10$^{8}$ W$^+$W$^-$ pairs, 10$^{6}$ Higgs bosons\nand $4\\cdot 10^{5}$ top-quark pairs per year. Such huge data samples combined\nwith a $\\cal{O}(100 \\rm keV)$ c.m. energy uncertainty will allow for Standard\nModel measurements with unparalleled precision and searches for new physics in\nregions not probed so far. The FCC-ee will be able to (i) indirectly discover\nnew particles coupling to the Higgs and electroweak bosons up to scales\n$\\Lambda \\approx$ 7 and 100 TeV; (ii) perform competitive SUSY tests at the\nloop level in regions beyond the LHC reach; and (iii) achieve the best\npotential in direct collider searches for dark matter and sterile neutrinos\nwith masses below 60 GeV.\n", "  The pressure exerted on a wall by a gas at equilibrium does not depend on the\nshape of the confining potential defining the wall. In contrast, it has been\nshown recently [A.P. Solon et al., Nat. Phys. 11, 673 (2015)] that a gas of\noverdamped active particles exerts on a wall a force that depends on the\nconfining potential, resulting in a net force on an asymmetric wall between two\nchambers at equal densities. Here, considering a model of underdamped\nself-propelled dumbbells in two dimensions, we study how the behavior of the\npressure depends on the damping coefficient of the dumbbells, thus exploring\ninertial effects. We find in particular that the force exerted on a moving wall\nbetween two chambers at equal density continuously vanishes at low damping\ncoefficient, and exhibits a complex dependence on the damping coefficient at\nlow density, when collisions are scarce. We further show that this behavior of\nthe pressure can to a significant extent be understood in terms of the\ntrajectories of individual particles close to and in contact with the wall.\n", "  The planned launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018 will herald a\nnew era of exoplanet spectroscopy. JWST will be the first telescope sensitive\nenough to potentially characterize terrestrial planets from their transmission\nspectra. In this work, we explore the possibility that terrestrial planets with\nVenus-type and Earth-type atmospheres could be distinguished from each other\nusing spectra obtained by JWST. If we find a terrestrial planet close to the\nliquid water habitable zone of an M5 star within a distance of 10 parsecs, it\nwould be possible to detect atmospheric ozone if present in large enough\nquantities, which would enable an oxygen-rich atmosphere to be identified.\nHowever, the cloudiness of a Venus-type atmosphere would inhibit our ability to\ndraw firm conclusions about the atmospheric composition, making any result\nambiguous. Observing small, temperate planets with JWST requires significant\ninvestment of resources, with single targets requiring of order 100 transits to\nachieve sufficient signal to noise. The possibility of detecting a crucial\nfeature such as the ozone signature would need to be carefully weighed against\nthe likelihood of clouds obscuring gas absorption in the spectrum.\n", "  We study the chemical ordering in Bi$_2$Te$_{3-x}$Se$_x$ grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on Si substrates. We produce films in the full composition range\nfrom x = 0 to 3, and determine their material properties using energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. By\nfitting the parameters of a kinetic growth model to these results, we obtain a\nconsistent description of growth at a microscopic level. Our main finding is\nthat despite the incorporation of Se in the central layer being much more\nprobable than that of Te, the formation of a fully ordered Te-Bi-Se-Bi-Te layer\nis prevented by kinetic of the growth process. Indeed, the Se concentration in\nthe central layer of Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se$_1$ reaches a maximum of only $\\approx$ 75%\neven under ideal growth conditions. A second finding of our work is that the\nintensity ratio of the 0 0 12 and 0 0 6 X-ray reflections serves as an\nexperimentally accessible quantitative measure of the degree of ordering in\nthese films.\n", "  In typical topological insulator (TI) systems the TI is bordered by a non-TI\ninsulator, and the surrounding conventional insulators, including vacuum, are\nnot generally treated as part of the TI system. Here, we implement the first\nmaterial system where the roles are reversed, and the TSS form around the\nnon-TI (instead of the TI) layers. This is realized by growing a layer of the\ntunable non-TI $(Bi_{1-x}In_{x})_{2}Se_{3}$ in between two layers of the TI\n$Bi_2Se_3$ using the atomically-precise molecular beam epitaxy technique. On\nthis tunable inverse topological platform, we systematically vary the thickness\nand the composition of the $(Bi_{1-x}In_{x})_{2}Se_{3}$ layer and show that\nthis tunes the coupling between the TI layers from strongly-coupled metallic to\nweakly-coupled, and finally to a fully-decoupled insulating regime. This system\ncan be used to probe the fundamental nature of coupling in TI materials and\nprovides a tunable insulating layer for TI devices.\n", "  Spin manipulation is one of the most critical challenges to realize\nspin-based logic devices and spintronic circuits. Graphene has been heralded as\nan ideal material to achieve spin manipulation but so far new paradigms and\ndemonstrators are limited. Here we show that certain impurities such as\nfluorine ad-atoms, which locally break sublattice symmetry without the\nformation of strong magnetic moment, could result in a remarkable variability\nof spin transport characteristics. The impurity resonance level is found to be\nassociated with a long range sublattice pseudospin polarization, which by\nlocally decoupling spin and pseudospin dynamics, provokes a huge spin lifetime\nelectron-hole asymmetry. In the dilute impurity limit, spin lifetimes could be\ntuned electrostatically from hundred picoseconds to several nanoseconds,\nproviding a protocol to chemically engineer an unprecedented spin device\nfunctionality.\n", "  Today, 2D semiconductor materials have been extended into the nitrogen group:\nphosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and even nitrogene. Motivated by them, based\nupon first-principles density functional calculations, we propose a new\ntwo-dimensional phosphorus nitride (PN) structure that is stable well above the\nroom temperature, due to its extremely high cohesive energy. Unlike\nphosphorene, PN structure is resistant to high temperature oxidation. The\nstructure is predicted to be a semiconductor with a wide, indirect band gap of\n2.64 eV. More interestingly, the phosphorus nitride monolayer experiences an\nindirect-to-direct band-gap transition at a relatively small tensile strain.\nSuch dramatic transformation in the electronic structure combined with\nstructural stability and oxidation resistance at high temperature could pave\nthe way for exciting innovations in high-speed ultrathin transistors, power\nelectronic modules, ultra-high efficiency LEDs and semiconductor lasers.\n", "  Uncertainty principles such as Heisenberg's provide limits on the\ntime-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important\ntheoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.\nGeneralizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform dictionary\ndesign for graph signals, lead to algorithms for reconstructing missing\ninformation from graph signals via sparse representations, and yield new graph\nanalysis tools. While previous work has focused on generalizing notions of\nspreads of a graph signal in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our\napproach is to generalize the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty\nprinciples that provide limits on the concentration of the analysis\ncoefficients of any graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are\njointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we\nhighlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data domain,\nthe local structure in a single small region of the graph can drastically\naffect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in different regions of\nthe graph, limiting the information provided by global uncertainty principles.\nAccordingly, we suggest a new way to incorporate a notion of locality, and\ndevelop local uncertainty principles that bound the concentration of the\nanalysis coefficients of each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame\nin terms of quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around\nthe center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed\nlocal uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of graph signals.\n", "  Recent results obtained for the eruptive variables (EXors) are reviewed.\nThese data span from X-rays to the sub-mm band and are presented along with\nperspectives for future observations achievable with the new advanced\ninstrumentation.\n", "  We have shown that data-driven models are effective for inferring physical\nattributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra, even when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this is possible when the\ndimensionality of the label space is large (Teff, logg, and 15 abundances: C,\nN, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear\nin its response to abundance and parameter changes. We adopt ideas from\ncompressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model\nfreedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high\nsignal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and\nabundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train\nand use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a\ngood job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex),\neven when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding ~50% of the observing\ntime. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect\nto abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements\nbelonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover\n(anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent\nwith the literature. However we find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster\nabundances is 3--4 times smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels\nwith associated errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code\nto extend this work to other spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  Bohmian mechanics is a realistic interpretation of quantum theory. It shares\nthe same ontology of classical mechanics: particles following continuous\ntrajectories in space through time. For this ontological continuity, it seems\nto be a good candidate for recovering the classical limit of quantum theory.\nIndeed, in a Bohmian framework, the issue of the classical limit reduces to\nshowing how classical trajectories can emerge from Bohmian ones, under specific\nclassicality assumptions. In this paper, we shall focus on a technical problem\nthat arises from the dynamics of a Bohmian system in bounded regions; and we\nsuggest that a possible solution is supplied by the action of environmental\ndecoherence. However, we shall show that, in order to implement decoherence in\na Bohmian framework, a stronger condition is required (disjointness of\nsupports) rather than the usual one (orthogonality of states).\n", "  In a recent paper [1] a master formula has been presented for the power\ncounting of a general effective field theory. We first show that this master\nformula follows immediately from the concept of chiral dimensions (loop\ncounting), together with standard dimensional analysis. Subsequently, [1] has\ndisputed the relevance of chiral counting for chiral Lagrangians, and in\nparticular for the electroweak chiral Lagrangian including a light Higgs boson.\nAs an alternative, a power counting based on `primary dimensions' has been\nproposed. The difficulties encountered with this scheme led the authors to\nsuggest that even the leading order of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian could\nnot be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that the concept of primary\ndimensions is irrelevant for the organization of chiral Lagrangians. We\nre-emphasize that the correct counting is based on chiral dimensions, or the\ncounting of loop orders, and show how the problems encountered in [1] are\nresolved.\n", "  In this document we address an error discovered in the ensemble generation\nfor our calculation of the $I=0$ $K\\to\\pi\\pi$ amplitude (Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,\n212001 (2015), arXiv:1505.07863) whereby the same random numbers were used for\nthe two independent quark flavors, resulting in small but measurable\ncorrelations between gauge observables separated by 12 units in the\ny-direction. We conclude that the effects of this error are negligible compared\nto the overall errors on our calculation.\n", "  Perovskite SrRuO3, a prototypical conductive ferromagnetic oxide, exhibits a\nkink in its band dispersion signalling the unusual electron dynamics therein.\nHowever, the origin of this kink remains elusive. By taking advantage of the\ncombo of reactive molecular beam epitaxy and in situ angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy, we systematically studied the evolution of the\nlow-energy electronic structure of SrRuO3 films with thickness thinning down to\nnearly two-dimensional limit in a well-controlled way. The kink structure\npersists even in the 4-unit-cell-thick film. Moreover, through quantitative\nself-energy analysis, we observed the negligible thickness dependence of the\nbinding energy of the kink, which is in sharp contrast to the downward trend of\nthe Curie temperature with reducing the film thickness. Together with\npreviously reported transport and Raman studies, this finding suggests that the\nkink of perovskite SrRuO3 should originate from the electron-phonon coupling\nrather than magnetic collective modes, and the in-plane phonons may play a\ndominant role. Considering such a kink structure of SrRuO3 is similar to these\nof many other correlated oxides, we suggest the possible ubiquity of the\ncoupling of electrons to oxygen-related phonons in correlated oxides.\n", "  Helping students learn from their own mistakes can help them develop habits\nof mind while learning physics content. Based upon cognitive apprenticeship\nmodel, we asked students to self-diagnose their mistakes and learn from\nreflecting on their problem solution. Varying levels of scaffolding support\nwere provided to students in different groups to diagnose their errors on two\ncontext-rich problems that students originally solved in recitation quizzes.\nHere, we discuss students' cognitive engagement in the two self-diagnosis\nactivities and transfer tasks with different scaffolds.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of an atom with a magnetic quadrupole moment that\ninteracts with an external field subject to a harmonic and a linear confining\npotentials is investigated. It is shown that the interaction between the\nmagnetic quadrupole moment and an electric field gives rise to an analogue of\nthe Coulomb potential and, by confining this atom to a harmonic and a linear\nconfining potentials, a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of the\nangular frequency on the quantum numbers of the system is obtained. In\nparticular, it is shown that the possible values of the angular frequency\nassociated with the ground state of the system are determined by a third-degree\nalgebraic equation.\n", "  The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory (NRAO) have collaborated to develop, install, and commission a new\ncommensal system on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The VLA Low Band\nIonospheric and Transient Experiment (VLITE) makes use of dedicated samplers\nand fibers to tap the signal from 10 VLA low band receivers and correlate those\nthrough a real-time DiFX correlator. VLITE allows for the simultaneous use of\nthe VLA to observe primary science using the higher frequencies receivers (1-50\nGHz) through the NRAO WIDAR correlator and lower frequencies through the DiFX\ncorrelator. VLITE operates during nearly all observing programs and provides 64\nMHz of bandwidth centered at 352 MHz. The operation of VLITE requires no\nadditional resources from the VLA system running the primary science and\nproduces an ad-hoc sky survey. The commensal system greatly expands the\ncapabilities of the VLA through value-added PI science, stand-alone\nastrophysics, the opening of a new window on transient searches, and\nserendipity. In the first year of operation we have recorded more than 6300\nhours spread across the sky. We present an overview of the VLITE program,\ndiscuss the sky coverage and depth obtained during the first year of operation,\nand briefly outline the astrophysics and transients programs.\n", "  An assumed attribute of expert physicists is that they learn readily from\ntheir own mistakes. Experts are unlikely to make the same mistakes when asked\nto solve a problem a second time, especially if they have had access to a\ncorrect solution. Here, we discuss a case study in which fourteen advanced\nundergraduate physics students taking an honors-level quantum mechanics course\nwere given the same four problems in both a midterm and final exam. The\nsolutions to the midterm problems were provided to students. The performance on\nthe final exam shows that while some advanced students performed equally well\nor improved compared to their performance on the midterm exam on the questions\nadministered a second time, a comparable number performed less well on the\nfinal exam than on the midterm exam. The wide distribution of students'\nperformance on problems administered a second time suggests that most advanced\nstudents do not automatically exploit their mistakes as an opportunity for\nlearning, and for repairing, extending, and organizing their knowledge\nstructure. Interviews with a subset of students revealed attitudes towards\nproblem-solving and gave insight into their approach to learning.\n", "  Expert problem solvers are characterized by continuous evaluation of their\nprogress towards a solution. One characteristic of expertise is self-diagnosis\ndirected towards elaboration of the solvers' conceptual understanding,\nknowledge organization or strategic approach. \"Self-diagnosis tasks\" aim at\nfostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present\ndiagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. We have\nbeen investigating how introductory physics students perform in such tasks.\nDeveloping a robust rubric is essential for objective evaluation of students'\nself-diagnosis skills. We discuss the development of a grading rubric that\ntakes into account introductory physics students' content knowledge as well as\nanalysis, planning and presentation skills. Using this rubric, we have found\nthe inter-rater reliability to be better than 80%. The rubric can easily be\nadapted to other problems, as will be discussed in a companion paper.\n", "  \"Self-diagnosis tasks\" aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly\nrequiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing\ntheir problem solutions. We have been investigating the extent to which\nintroductory physics students can diagnose their own mistakes when explicitly\nasked to do so with different levels of scaffolding support provided to them.\nIn our study in an introductory physics class with more than 200 students, the\nrecitation classes were split into three different experimental groups in which\ndifferent levels of guidance were provided for performing the self-diagnosis\nactivities. We present our findings that students' performance was far from\nperfect. However, differences in the scaffolding in the three experimental\ngroups (i.e. providing a correct solution and a self-diagnosis rubric)\nnoticeably affected the resulting diagnosis.\n", "  We discuss the development and evaluation of quantum interactive learning\ntutorials (QuILTs) which are suitable for undergraduate courses in quantum\nmechanics. QuILTs are based on the investigation of student difficulties in\nlearning quantum physics. They exploit computer-based visualization tools and\nhelp students build links between the formal and conceptual aspects of quantum\nphysics without compromising the technical content. They can be used both as\nsupplements to lectures or as a self-study tool.\n", "  Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations\nsuch as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and\ncontrol error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint\nsatisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In\nparticular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a\nhardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two\nnew decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly\ninto hardware.\n  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising\nmodels are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in\ndifferent constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In\ncontrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising\nmodel for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to\ngenerate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of\nCSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local\nmapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.\n  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based\nfault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is\ntypically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N\nusing 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a\nleading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms\nto find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than\ncan be solved directly on current hardware.\n", "  The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 5797.1 \\AA\\ is simulated based on\nthree premises: (1) The carrier of the DIB is polar as concluded by T. Oka et\nal. from the anomalous spectrum toward Herschel 36. (2) The sharp central\nfeature observed by P. J. Sarre's group is the $Q$-branch of a parallel band of\na prolate top. (3) The radiative temperature of the environment is $T_r$=2.73\nK.\n  A $^2 \\Pi \\leftarrow$ $^2\\Pi$ transition of a linear radical is simulated.\nResults depend on 10 parameters, with the rotational constant $B$ being the\nmost critical. Comparisons of calculated spectra with observed data constrain\n$B$, which in turn constrains the number of heavy atoms to 5 $\\leq n \\leq 7$.\nUpper limits based on the Her 36 spectrum and lower limits based on stability\nagainst photodissociation are also discussed. The latter is based on the\nassumption that the DIB molecules are produced top-down from the breakdown of\ndust rather than bottom-up by chemical reactions.\n  A difficulty with this limit is that J. P. Maier's laboratory has observed\nmany molecules within this size range, some of which have been tested\nastronomically. Candidates are discussed in light of many prolate tops observed\nby the P. Thaddeus and M. C. McCarthy microwave group.\n", "  The role of the side channels in the continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution is studied. It is shown how the information leakage through a side\nchannel from the trusted sender station increases the vulnerability of the\nprotocols to the eavesdropping in the main quantum communication channel.\nMoreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted\nreceiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum\nchannel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage\non the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the\nside-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light\non the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation\non the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case\nof the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side\nchannel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving\nside, the method of optimal monitoring of the residual noise from the\nside-channel noise infusion is suggested and shown to be able to completely\neliminate the presence of the noisy side channel. We therefore prove that the\nside-channel effects can be completely removed using feasible operations if the\ntrusted parties access the respective parts of the side channels.\n", "  We report on the direct observation of vortex states confined in equilateral\nand isosceles triangular dots of weak pinning amorphous superconducting thin\nfilms with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscope.\nThe observed images illustrate not only pieces of a triangular vortex lattice\nas commensurate vortex states, but also incommensurate vortex states including\nmetastable ones. We comparatively analyze vortex configurations found in\ndifferent sample geometries and discuss the symmetry and stability of\ncommensurate and incommensurate vortex configurations against deformations of\nthe sample shape.\n", "  Several equations used to model and characterize the linear region IV\ncharacteristics of nanoscale field-effect transistors are derived. The meaning\nof carrier mobility at the nanoscale is discussed by defining two related\nquantities, the apparent mobility and the ballistic mobility. The validity of\nMatthiessen's Rule for relating the apparent ability to the ballistic and\ndiffusive mobilities is examined. Other questions that arise in the analysis\nand characterization of nanoscale field-effect transistors are also discussed.\nThese notes are intended to pull together in one place some key equations\nneeded to analyze the linear region performance of nanoscale MOSFETs and to\npoint out some errors in previous publications.\n", "  The curvature invariants have been subject of recent interest due to the\ndebate concerning the notions of intrinsic/extrinsic frame-dragging, the use of\nthe electromagnetic analogy in such classification, and the question of whether\nthere is a fundamental difference between the gravitomagnetic field arising\nfrom the translational motion of the sources, detected with Lunar Laser Raging\nand in the observations of binary pulsars, and the gravitomagnetic field\nproduced by the rotation of the Earth, detected in the LAGEOS Satellites data\nand by the Gravity Probe-B mission. In this work we clarify both the algebraic\nand physical meaning of the curvature invariants and their electromagnetic\ncounterparts. The structure of the invariants of the astrophysical setups of\ninterest is studied in detail, and its relationship with the gravitomagnetic\neffects is dissected. Finally, a new classification for intrinsic/extrinsic\ngravitomagnetism is put forth.\n", "  Soliton formation in on-chip micro-comb generation balances cavity dispersion\nand nonlinearity and allows coherent, low-noise comb operation. We study the\nintracavity waveform of an on-chip microcavity soliton in a silicon nitride\nmicroresonator configured with a drop port. Whereas combs measured at the\nthrough port are accompanied by a very strong pump line which accounts for >99%\nof the output power, our experiments reveal that inside the microcavity, most\nof the power is in the soliton. Time-domain measurements performed at the drop\nport provide information that directly reflects the intracavity field. Data\nconfirm a train of bright, close to bandwidth-limited pulses, accompanied by a\nweak continuous wave (CW) background with a small phase shift relative to the\ncomb.\n", "  We present fractional quantum Hall domain walls confined in a gate-defined\nwire structure. Our experiments utilize spatial oscillation of domain walls\ndriven by radio frequency electric fields to cause nuclear magnetic resonance.\nThe resulting spectra are discussed in terms of both large quadrupole fields\ncreated around the wire and hyperfine fields associated with the oscillating\ndomain walls. This provides the experimental fact that the domain walls survive\nnear the confined geometry despite of potential deformation, by which a\nlocalized magnetic resonance is allowed in electrical means.\n", "  Variations in free core nutation (FCN) are connected with various processes\nin the Earth's fluid core and core-mantle coupling, which are also largely\nresponsible for the geomagnetic field variations, particularly the geomagnetic\njerks (GMJs). A previous study (Malkin, 2013) revealed that the epochs of the\nobserved extremes in the FCN amplitude and phase variations are close to the\nGMJ epochs. In this paper, a new evidence of this connection was found. The\nlarge FCN amplitude and phase disturbance occurred at the epoch close to the\nnewly revealed GMJ 2011. This event occurred to be the second large change in\nthe FCN amplitude and phase after the 1999 disturbance that is also associated\nwith the GMJ 1999. Moreover, the long-time FCN phase drift had changed suddenly\nin 1998--1999, immediately before the GMJ 1999, and seemed to change again at\nthe epoch immediately preceding the GMJ 2011. The FCN amplitude showed a\ngeneral long-time decrease before GMJ 1999, and it subsequently grew until GMJ\n2011, and then seemed to decrease again. A smaller FCN change can be observed\nat the epoch around 2013, which is also suspected as the GMJ epoch. The latter\nconfirms the suggestion that a rapid change in the FCN amplitude and/or phase\ncan be used as an evidence of the GMJ that is not clearly detected from the\ngeomagnetic observations.\n", "  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising materials for\ncarbon capture applications due to their high CO2 capacities and tunable\nproperties. Amongst the many possible MOFs, metal-substituted compounds based\non M-DOBDC and M-HKUST-1 have demonstrated amongst the highest CO2 capacities\nat the low pressures typical of flue gasses. Here we explore the possibility\nfor additional performance tuning of these compounds by computationally\nscreening 36 metal-substituted variants (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W, Sn, and Pb) with respect to their CO2 adsorption\nenthalpy, $\\Delta$H (T=300K). Supercell calculations based on van der Waals\ndensity functional theory (vdW-DF) yield enthalpies in good agreement with\nexperimental measurements, out-performing semi-empirical (DFT-D2) and\nconventional (LDA and GGA) functionals. Our screening identifies 13 compounds\nhaving $\\Delta$H values within the targeted thermodynamic window 40 $\\leq$\n$\\Delta$H $\\leq$ 75 kJ/mol: 8 are based on M-DODBC (M=Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Ti, V,\nMo, and W), and 5 on M-HKUST-1 (M= Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Sc). Variations in the\nelectronic structure and the geometry of the structural building unit are\nexamined and used to rationalize trends in CO2 affinity. In particular, the\npartial charge on the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites is found to\ncorrelate with $\\Delta$H, suggesting that this property may be used as a simple\nperformance descriptor. The ability to rapidly distinguish promising MOFs from\nthose that are \"thermodynamic dead-ends\" will be helpful in guiding synthesis\nefforts towards promising compounds.\n", "  The control of quantum correlations in solid state systems by means of\nmaterial engineering is a broad avenue to be explored, since it makes possible\nsteps toward the limits of quantum mechanics and the design of novel materials\nwith applications on emerging quantum technologies. In this context, this\nLetter explores the potential of molecular magnets to be prototypes of\nmaterials for quantum information technology. More precisely, we engineered a\nmaterial and from its geometric quantum discord we found significant quantum\ncorrelations up to 9540 K (even without entanglement); and, in addition, a pure\nsinglet state occupied up to around 80 K (above liquid nitrogen temperature).\nThese results could only be achieved due to the carboxylate group promoting a\nmetal-to-metal huge magnetic interaction.\n", "  The general approach for describing systems with Bose-Einstein condensate,\nwhere atoms interact through nonlocal pair potentials, is presented. A special\nattention is paid to nonintegrable potentials, such as the dipolar interaction\npotential. The potentials that are not absolutely integrable can have not well\ndefined Fourier transforms. Using formally such not defined Fourier transforms\nleads to unphysical conclusions. For making the Fourier transform well defined,\nthe interaction potential has to be regularized. This is illustrated by the\nexample of dipolar interactions.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize a topological insulator with optical-passive\nelements, and analyze the effects of Kerr-nonlinearities in its topological\nbehavior. In the linear regime, our design gives rise to an optical spectrum\nwith topological features and where the bandwidths and bandgaps are\ndramatically broadened. The resulting edge modes cover a very wide frequency\nrange. We relate this behavior to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian\ndescribing the system's amplitudes is long-range. We also develop a method to\nanalyze the scheme in the presence of a Kerr medium. We assess robustness and\nstability of the topological features, and predict the presence of chiral\nsqueezed fluctuations at the edges in some parameter regimes.\n", "  We present new transit light curves for planets in six extrasolar planetary\nsystems. They were acquired with 0.4-2.2 m telescopes located in west Asia,\nEurope, and South America. When combined with literature data, they allowed us\nto redetermine system parameters in a homogeneous way. Our results for\nindividual systems are in agreement with values reported in previous studies.\nWe refined transit ephemerides and reduced uncertainties of orbital periods by\na factor between 2 and 7. No sign of any variations in transit times was\ndetected for the planets studied.\n", "  The remarkable old nova and an intermediate polar (IP) - GK Per was observed\nwith Swift, the Chandra HETG and NuSTAR during its recent dwarf nova (DN)\noutburst in March - April 2015. Monitoring the outburst, we noticed several\nprocesses occurring on different time scales, such as: the slow evolution of\nthe very soft X-ray emission (below 0.6 keV) during the first two weeks of the\noutburst and the very fast saturation of the X-ray flux above 1 keV. The Swift\nUVOT lights curves also showed different behaviour, depending on the filter.\nThe broad band X-ray spectra revealed the presence of at least three different\nemitting sources. The white dwarf (WD) spin was observed even in the very hard\nX-ray range of NuSTAR, indicating that the modulation is not due to absorption,\nin contrast to a typical IP. It is also supported by the similarity of the\non-pulse and off-pulse X-ray spectra. We propose that the scenario when the\ninner accretion disk pushed towards the WD by the increased accretion obscures\nthe lower WD pole can work also for GK Per.\n", "  We present an analysis of spectrum and variability of the bright reddened\nnarrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Was~61 using 90 ks archival {\\it XMM-Newton} data.\nThe X-ray spectrum in 0.2-10 keV can be characterized by an absorbed power-law\nplus soft excess and an Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line. The power-law spectral\nindex remains constant during the flux variation. The absorbing material is\nmildly ionized, with a column density of 3.2$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, and\ndoes not appear to vary during the period of the X-ray observation. If the same\nmaterial causes the optical reddening (E(B-V)$\\simeq$0.6 mag), it must be\nlocated outside the narrow line region with a dust-to-gas ratio similar to the\naverage Galactic value. We detect significant variations of the Fe K$\\alpha$\nline during the observational period. A broad Fe K$\\alpha$ line at $\\simeq$6.7\nkeV with a width of $\\sim$0.6 keV is detected in the low flux segment of the\nfirst 40 ks exposure, and is absent in the spectra of other segments; a narrow\nFe K$\\alpha$ emission line $\\sim$6.4 keV with a width of $\\sim$0.1 keV is\nobserved in the subsequent 20 ks segment, which has a count rate of 35% higher\nand is in the next day. We believe this is due to the change in geometry and\nkinematics of the X-ray emitting corona. The temperature and flux of soft X-ray\nexcess appear to correlate with the flux of the hard power-law component.\nComptonization of disc photons by a warm and optically thick inner disk is\npreferred to interpret the soft excess, rather than the ionized reflection.\n", "  We study and compare characteristics of sunspot group latitude distribution\nin two catalogs: the extended Greenwich (1874--2014) and Schwabe ones\n(1825--1867). We demonstrate that both datasets reveal similar links between\nlatitude and amplitude characteristics of the 11-year cycle: the latitude\ndispersion correlates with the current activity and the mean latitude of\nsunspots in the cycle's maximum is proportional to its amplitude, It agrees\nwith conclusions that we made in previous papers for the Greenwich catalog.\n  We show that the latitude properties of sunspot distribution are much more\nstable against loss of observational data than traditional amplitude indices of\nactivity. Therefore, the found links can be used for estimates of quality of\nobservations and independent normalizing of activity levels in a gappy\npre-Greenwich data. We demonstrate it using the Schwabe catalog as an example.\n  In addition, we show that the first part of the Schwabe data probably\ncontains errors in determination of sunspot latitudes that lead to\noverestimation of the sunspot latitude dispersions.\n", "  An active line of research has studied the detection and representation of\ntrends in social media content. There is still relatively little understanding,\nhowever, of methods to characterize the early adopters of these trends: who\npicks up on these trends at different points in time, and what is their role in\nthe system? We develop a framework for analyzing the population of users who\nparticipate in trending topics over the course of these topics' lifecycles.\nCentral to our analysis is the notion of a \"status gradient\", describing how\nusers of different activity levels adopt a trend at different points in time.\nAcross multiple datasets, we find that this methodology reveals key differences\nin the nature of the early adopters in different domains.\n", "  The cryogenic underground observatory for rare events (CUORE) is a 1-ton\nscale bolometric experiment whose detector consists of an array of 988 TeO2\ncrystals arranged in a cylindrical compact structure of 19 towers. This will be\nthe largest bolometric mass ever operated. The experiment will work at a\ntemperature around or below 10 mK. CUORE cryostat consists of a cryogen-free\nsystem based on pulse tubes and a custom high power dilution refrigerator,\ndesigned to match these specifications. The cryostat has been commissioned in\n2014 at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories and reached a record temperature\nof 6 mK on a cubic meter scale. In this paper, we present results of CUORE\ncommissioning runs. Details on the thermal characteristics and cryogenic\nperformances of the system will be also given.\n", "  We describe the optical characterisation of two silicon cold-electron\nbolometers each consisting of a small ($32 \\times 14~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) island of\ndegenerately doped silicon with superconducting aluminium contacts. Radiation\nis coupled into the silicon absorber with a twin-slot antenna designed to\ncouple to 160-GHz radiation through a silicon lens.The first device has a\nhighly doped silicon absorber, the second has a highly doped strained-silicon\nabsorber.Using a novel method of cross-correlating the outputs from two\nparallel amplifiers, we measure noise-equivalent powers of $3.0 \\times\n10^{-16}$ and $6.6 \\times 10^{-17}~\\mathrm{W\\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ for the control and\nstrained device, respectively, when observing radiation from a 77-K source. In\nthe case of the strained device, the noise-equivalent power is limited by the\nphoton noise.\n", "  Machine learning can provide powerful tools to detect patterns in\nmulti-dimensional parameter space. We use K-means -a simple yet powerful\nunsupervised clustering algorithm which picks out structure in unlabeled data-\nto study a sample of quasar UV spectra from the Quasar Catalog of the 10th Data\nRelease of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of Paris et al. (2014). Detecting\npatterns in large datasets helps us gain insights into the physical conditions\nand processes giving rise to the observed properties of quasars. We use K-means\nto find clusters in the parameter space of the equivalent width (EW), the blue-\nand red-half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the Mg II 2800 A line, the C IV\n1549 A line, and the C III] 1908 A blend in samples of Broad Absorption-Line\n(BAL) and non-BAL quasars at redshift 1.6-2.1. Using this method, we\nsuccessfully recover correlations well-known in the UV regime such as the\nanti-correlation between the EW and blueshift of the C IV emission line and the\nshape of the ionizing Spectra Energy distribution (SED) probed by the strength\nof He II and the Si III]/C III] ratio. We find this to be particularly evident\nwhen the properties of C III] are used to find the clusters, while those of Mg\nII proved to be less strongly correlated with the properties of the other lines\nin the spectra such as the width of C IV or the Si III]/C III] ratio. We\nconclude that unsupervised clustering methods (such as K-means) are powerful\nmethods for finding \"natural\" binning boundaries in multidimensional datasets\nand discuss caveats and future work.\n", "  We explore a definition of complexity based on logic functions, which are\nwidely used as compact descriptions of rules in diverse fields of contemporary\nscience. Detailed numerical analysis shows that (i) logic complexity is\neffective in discriminating between classes of functions commonly employed in\nmodelling contexts; (ii) it extends the notion of canalisation, used in the\nstudy of genetic regulation, to a more general and detailed measure; (iii) it\nis tightly linked to the resilience of a function's output to noise affecting\nits inputs. We demonstrate its utility by measuring it in empirical data on\ngene regulation, digital circuitry, and propositional calculus. Logic\ncomplexity is exceptionally low in these systems. The asymmetry between \"on\"\nand \"off\" states in the data correlates with the complexity in a non-null way;\na model of random Boolean networks clarifies this trend and indicates a common\nhierarchical architecture in the three systems.\n", "  We consider the $N$-body problem of celestial mechanics in spaces of nonzero\nconstant curvature. Using the concept of locked inertia tensor, we compute the\nmoment of inertia for systems moving on spheres and hyperbolic spheres and show\nthat we can recover the classical definition in the Euclidean case. After\nproving some criteria for the existence of relative equilibria, we find a\nnatural way to define the concept of central configuration in curved spaces\nusing the moment of inertia, and show that our definition is formally similar\nto the one that governs the classical problem. The existence criteria we\ndevelop for central configurations help us provide several examples and prove\nthat, for any given point masses on spheres and hyperbolic spheres, central\nconfigurations always exist. We end our paper with results concerning the\nnumber of central configurations that lie on the same geodesic, thus extending\nthe celebrated theorem of Moulton to hyperbolic spheres and pointing out that\nit has no straightforward generalization to spheres, where the count gets\ncomplicated even in the case $N=2$.\n", "  Stent implantation in coronary bifurcations presents unique challenges and\ncurrently there is no universally accepted stent deployment approach. Despite\nclinical and computational studies, to date, the effect of each stent\nimplantation method on the coronary artery hemodynamics is not well understood.\nIn this study the hemodynamics of stented coronary bifurcations under pulsatile\nflow conditions were investigated experimentally. Three implantation methods,\nprovisional side branch (PSB), culotte (CUL), and crush (CRU), were\ninvestigated using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure\nthe velocity fields. Subsequently, hemodynamic parameters including wall shear\nstress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT)\nwere calculated and the pressure field through the vessel was non-invasively\nquantified. The effects of each stented case were evaluated and compared\nagainst an un-stented case. CRU provided the lowest compliance mismatch, but\ndemonstrated detrimental stent interactions. PSB, the clinically preferred\nmethod, and CUL maintained many normal flow conditions. However, PSB provided\nabout a 300% increase in both OSI and RRT. CUL yielded a 10% and 85% increase\nin OSI and RRT, respectively. The results of this study support the concept\nthat different bifurcation stenting techniques result in hemodynamic\nenvironments that deviate from that of un-stented bifurcations, to varying\ndegrees.\n", "  The advent of MOOCs has stimulated interest in using online videos to deliver\ncontent in university courses. We examined student engagement with 78 online\nvideos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended\nintroductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We found\nthat students were more engaged with videos that supported laboratory\nactivities than with videos that presented lecture content. In particular, the\npercentage of students accessing laboratory videos was consistently greater\nthan 80 percent throughout the semester while the percentage of students\naccessing lecture videos dropped to less than 40 percent by the end of the\nterm. Moreover, students were more likely to access the entirety of a\nlaboratory video than a lecture video. Our results suggest that students may\naccess videos based on perceived value: students appear to consider the\nlaboratory videos as essential for successfully completing the laboratories\nwhile students appear to consider the lecture videos as something more akin to\nsupplementary material. We found there was little correlation between student\nengagement with the videos and the performance in the course. In addition, an\nexamination of the in-video content suggests that students focus more on\nconcrete information that is explicitly required for assignment completion\n(e.g., actions required to complete laboratory work, or formulas/mathematical\nexpressions needed to solve particular problems) and less on content that is\nconsidered more conceptual in nature. The results of the study suggest ways in\nwhich instructors may revise courses to better support student learning.\n", "  The coupled system of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Maxwell\ndifferential equations is solved under two different source conditions:\nnon-zero electric charge and pressure anisotropy. Expressions for the metric\nfunctions, and pressures which extend the Tolman VII exact solution are deduced\nfrom the new solutions. By applying boundary conditions to these solutions, all\nintegration constants are computed in terms of parameters that are physically\nmeaningful.\n", "  Granular packing structures of cohesive micro-sized particles with different\nsizes and size distributions, including mono-sized, uniform and Gaussian\ndistribution, are investigated by using two different history dependent contact\nmodels with Discrete Element Method (DEM). The simulation is carried out in the\nframework of LIGGGHTS which is a DEM simulation package extended based on\nbranch of granular package of widely used open-source code LAMMPS. Contact\nforce caused by translation and rotation, frictional and damping forces due to\ncollision with other particles or container boundaries, cohesive force, van der\nWaals force, and gravity are considered. The radial distribution functions\n(RDFs), force distributions, porosities, and coordination numbers under\ncohesive and non-cohesive conditions are reported. The results indicate that\nparticle size and size distributions have great influences on the packing\ndensity for particle packing under cohesive effect: particles with Gaussian\ndistribution have the lowest packing density, followed by the particles with\nuniform distribution; the particles with mono-sized distribution have the\nhighest packing density. It is also found that cohesive effect to the system\ndoes not significantly affect the coordination number that mainly depends on\nthe particle size and size distribution. Although the magnitude of net force\ndistribution is different, the results for porosity, coordination number and\nmean value of magnitude of net force do not vary significantly between the two\ncontact models.\n", "  The paper deals with the generic problem of two waveguides coupled by\nperforations, which can be perforated tube mufflers without or with partitions,\npossibly with absorbing materials. Other examples are ducts with branched\nresonators of honeycomb cavities , which can be coupled or not, and splitter\nsilencers. Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is considered in each guide.\nThe propagation in the two waveguides can be very different, thanks e.g. to the\npresence of constrictions. The model is a discrete, periodic one, based upon\n4th-order impedance matrices and their diagonalization. All the calculation is\nanalytical, thanks to the partition of the matrices in 2nd-order matrices, and\nallows the treatment of a very wide types of problems. Several aspects are\ninvestigated: the local or non-local character of the reaction of one guide to\nthe other; the definition of a coupling coefficient; the effect of finite size\nwhen a lattice with n cells in inserted into an infinite guide; the\nrelationship between the Insertion Loss and the dispersion. The assumptions are\nas follows: linear acoustics, no mean flow, rigid wall. However the effect of\nthe series impedance of the perforations, which is generally ignored, is taken\ninto account, and is dis- cussed. When there are no losses, it is shown that,\nfor symmetry reasons, the cutoff frequencies depend on either the series\nimpedance or the shunt admittance , and are the eigenfrequencies of the cells\nof the lattice, with zero-pressure or zero-velocity at the ends of the cells.\n", "  In order to find out capable chemical evolution step from astronomically\ncreated organic in interstellar space to biological organic on the earth,\ninfrared spectrum of nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon coupled\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was analyzed by the density functional theory.\nIonization was modeled from neutral to tri-cation. Among one nitrogen and two\nnitrogen substituted NPAH, we could find good examples showing similar IR\nbehavior with astronomically well observed one as like C8H6N1, C7H5N2, and\nC7H5N2. We can imagine that such ionized NPAH may be created in interstellar\nspace by attacks of high energy nitrogen and photon. Whereas, in case of three\nand four nitrogen substituted cases as like C6H4N3 and C5H3N4, there were no\ncandidate showing similar behavior with observed one. Also, IR of typical\nbiological organic with four and five nitrogen substituted one as like purine\nand adenine resulted no good similarity with observed one. By such theoretical\ncomparison, one capable story of chemical evolution of PAH in interstellar\nspace was that one and two nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon\nmolecules may have a potential to be created in interstellar space, whereas\nmore than three nitrogen substituted molecules including biological organic\npurine and adenine may not be synthesized in space, possibly on the earth.\n", "  Controlled micro- to meso-scale porosity is a common materials design goal\nwith possible applications ranging from molecular gas adsorption to particle\nsize selective permeability or solubility. Here, we use inverse methods of\nstatistical mechanics to design an isotropic pair interaction that, in the\nabsence of an external field, assembles particles into an inhomogeneous {\\em\nfluid} matrix surrounding pores of prescribed size ordered in a lattice\nmorphology. The pore size can be tuned via modification of temperature or\nparticle concentration. Moreover, modulating density reveals a rich series of\nmicrophase-separated morphologies including pore- or particle-based lattices,\npore- or particle-based columns, and bicontinuous or lamellar structures.\nSensitivity of pore assembly to the form of the designed interaction potential\nis explored.\n", "  In semiconductor nanostructures nonradiative Auger recombination is enhanced\nby the presence of boundaries which relax the momentum conservation and thereby\nremoves the threshold reduction for these processes. We propose a method to\nstrongly reduce the Auger recombination rate by injecting spin-polarized\ncarriers. Our method is illustrated on the example of a quantum well in which\nthe spin-orbit coupling of conduction band is negligible as compared to valence\nband and thus holes can be considered as spin-unpolarized. The suppression\nfactor of the Auger recombination is determined by the two-dimensional\ncharacter of the system, given by the ratio of the Fermi energy of electrons\nand the separation of the electron levels quantized in the growth direction.\nOur predictions can be tested experimentally and we discuss their implications\nfor semiconductor lasers relying on injection of spin-polarized electrons.\n", "  We report on a compact, tunable, and scalable to large arrays imaging device,\nbased on a radio-frequency optically pumped atomic magnetometer operating in\nmagnetic induction tomography modality. Imaging of conductive objects is\nperformed at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and without\nbackground subtraction. Conductivity maps of target objects exhibit not only\nexcellent performance in terms of shape reconstruction but also demonstrate\ndetection of sub-millimetric cracks and penetration of conductive barriers. The\nresults presented here demonstrate the potential of a future generation of\nimaging instruments, which combine magnetic induction tomography and the\nunmatched performance of atomic magnetometers.\n", "  We perform a numerical parameter study to determine what effect varying\ndifferential rotation and flux emergence has on a star's non-potential coronal\nmagnetic field. In particular we consider the effects on the star's surface\nmagnetic flux, open magnetic flux, mean azimuthal field strength, coronal free\nmagnetic energy, coronal heating and flux rope eruptions. To do this, we apply\na magnetic flux transport model to describe the photospheric evolution, and\ncouple this to the non-potential coronal evolution using a magnetofrictional\ntechnique. A flux emergence model is applied to add new magnetic flux onto the\nphotosphere and into the corona. The parameters of this flux emergence model\nare derived from the solar flux emergence profile, however the rate of\nemergence can be increased to represent higher flux emergence rates than the\nSun's. Overall we find that flux emergence has a greater effect on the\nnon-potential coronal properties compared to differential rotation, with all\nthe aforementioned properties increasing with increasing flux emergence rate.\nAlthough differential rotation has a lesser effect on the overall coronal\nproperties compared to flux emergence, varying differential rotation does alter\nthe coronal structure. As the differential rotation rate increases, the corona\nbecomes more open, and more non-potential.\n"]}
