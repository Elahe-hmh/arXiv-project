tight-binding model with the\non-site interactions treated at the mean-field level. Due to the strong\nspin-orbit coupling, the band structure undergoes a significant change in Fermi\nsurface topology as the external magnetic field is applied, invalidating the\nrigid band picture in which the Zeeman energy only causes chemical potential\nshifts. In addition, since Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a $t_{2g}$ active system with\nunquenched orbital moments, the orbital Zeeman energy is not negligible and\nplays an important role in the phase diagram on the magnetic field orientation.\nWe find that both the total density of states at the Fermi energy and the\nentropy exhibit a sudden increase near the critical magnetic field for the\nnematic phase, echoing the experimental findings. Our results suggest that\nextra cares are necessary to isolate the contributions due to the quantum\ncriticality from the band structure singularity in this particular material.\nThe effects of quantum critical fluctuations are briefly discussed.\n", "  We relate notions of complementarity in three layers of quantum mechanics:\n(i) von Neumann algebras, (ii) Hilbert spaces, and (iii) orthomodular lattices.\nTaking a more general categorical perspective of which the above are instances,\nwe consider dagger monoidal kernel categories for (ii), so that (i) become\n(sub)endohomsets and (iii) become subobject lattices. By developing a\n`point-free' definition of copyability we link (i) commutative von Neumann\nsubalgebras, (ii) classical structures, and (iii) Boolean subalgebras.\n", "  A new simulation box setup is introduced for the precise description of the\nwavepacket evolution of two electronic systems in intense laser pulses. In this\nbox, the regions of the hydrogen molecule H$_{2} $, and singly and doubly\nionized species, H$_{2}^+ $ and H$_{2}^{+2} $, are well recognized and their\ntime-dependent populations are calculated at different laser field intensities.\nIn addition, some new regions are introduced and characterized as quasi-double\nionization and their time-dependencies on the laser field intensity are\ncalculated and analyzed. The adopted simulation box setup is special in that it\nassures proper evaluation of the second ionization. In this study, the dynamics\nof the electrons and nuclei of the hydrogen molecule are separated based on the\nadiabatic approximation. The time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger and Newton\nequations are solved simultaneously for the electrons and the nuclei,\nrespectively. Laser pulses of 390 nm wavelength at four different intensities\n(i.e. $ 1\\times10^{14} $, $ 5\\times10^{14} $, $ 1\\times10^{15} $, and $\n5\\times10^{15} $ W cm$^{-2}$) are used in these simulations. Details of the\ncentral H$_{2} $ region is also presented and discussed. This region is divided\ninto four sub-regions related to the ionic state H$^+$H$^-$ and covalent\n(natural) state HH. The effect of the motion of nuclei on the enhanced\nionization is discussed. Finally, some different time-dependent properties are\ncalculated and their dependencies on the intensity of the laser pulse are\nstudied, and their correlations with the populations of different regions are\nanalyzed.\n", "  We give a natural generalization of the classification of commutative rings\nof ordinary differential operators, given in works of Krichever, Mumford,\nMulase, and determine commutative rings of operators in a completed ring of\npartial differential operators in two variables (satisfying certain mild\nconditions) in terms of Parshin's generalized geometric data. It uses a\ngeneralization of M.Sato's theory and is constructible in both ways.\n", "  We consider the effect of volume fluctuations on cumulants of the net baryon\nnumber. Based on a general formalism, we derive universal expressions for the\nnet baryon number cumulants in the presence of volume fluctuations with an\narbitrary probability distribution. The relevance of these fluctuations for the\nbaryon-number cumulants and in particular for the ratios of cumulants is\nassessed in the Polyakov loop extended quark-meson model within the functional\nrenormalization group. We show that the baryon number cumulants are generally\nenhanced by volume fluctuations and that the critical behavior of higher order\ncumulants may be modified significantly.\n", "  In this work we present our first results of binary black hole circular\norbits using {\\sc cocal}, the Compact Object CALculator. Using the 3+1\ndecomposition five equations are being solved under the assumptions of\nconformal flatness and maximal slicing. Excision is used and the appropriate\napparent horizon boundary conditions are applied. The orbital velocity is\ndetermined by imposing a Schwarzschild behaviour at infinity. A sequence of\nequal mass black holes is obtained and its main physical characteristics are\ncalculated.\n", "  A physical mechanism has been proposed to describe the formation of a stable\nstate of a nonwetting liquid after filling of a porous medium at an increased\npressure with the subsequent reduction of the overpressure to zero. It has been\nshown that the observed transition of the system of nonwetting-liquid\nnanoclusters to the stable state in a narrow range of filling factors and a\nnarrow temperature interval is due to a decrease in the surface free energy\nwithout change in the chemical potential owing to the collective interactions\nbetween liquid nanoclusters in the neighboring pores. This effectively\ncorresponds to their mutual attraction. The model makes it possible to describe\nthe observed dependences of the volume of the liquid in pores in the stable\nstate on the filling factor and temperature.\n", "  A model of randomly distributed overlapping spheres of different radii is\nrepresented to describe a heterogeneous porous medium. Two-particle correlation\nfunction of the relative position of pores of different radii in the medium\nspace was calculated and detailed analysis was carried out. The model allows to\ncharacterize the disordered porous medium with the number of nearest neighbors,\nthe area of all mouths that connect pore with the neighboring pores. These\nparamaters depend on the pore size and porosity and --- in addition to the\nspecific surface area, porosity, and percolation threshold and the distribution\nfunction of pore size.\n", "  Two dimensional statistical integrable models, such as the Ising model, the\nchiral Potts model and the Belavin model, becomes integrable. Because of the\nSU(2) symmetry of these models, these models become integrable. The integral\nmodels are often parameterized by the elliptic function or the elliptic theta\nfunction. In this paper, we study the Ising model, and we show that the\nYang-Baxter equation of the Ising model can be written as the integrability\ncondition of SU(2), and we gives the natural explanation why the Ising model\ncan be parameterized by the elliptic function by connecting the spherical\ntrigonometry relation and the elliptic function. Addition formula of the\nelliptic function is the secret of the exact solvability of the Ising model.\n", "  We develop an abstract model of atomic clocks that fully describes the\ndynamics of repeated synchronization between a classical oscillator and a\nquantum reference. We prove existence of a stationary state of the model and\nstudy its dependence on the control scheme, the interrogation time and the\nstability of the oscillator. For unbiased atomic clocks, we derive a\nfundamental bound on atomic clocks long time stability for a given local\noscillator noise. In particular, we show that for a local oscillator noise with\nintegrated frequency variance scaling as $T^\\alpha$ for short times $T$, the\noptimal clock time variance scales as $F^{-(\\alpha +1)/(\\alpha +2)}$ with\nrespect to the quantum Fisher information, $F$, associated to the quantum\nreference.\n", "  The Jet-Gap-Jet (JGJ) process as a way to test the\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov Pomeron is introduced. The comparison with the\nTevatron data as well as the predictions for the LHC are presented. In the\nsecond part, the possibility to measure the Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE)\nJet-Gap-Jet process in the ATLAS experiment with additional AFP detectors is\ndescribed. The ratio of the DPE jet-gap-jet cross section to the DPE jet cross\nsection is presented.\n", "  Generally strong charge and magnetic inhomogeneities are observed in NQR/NMR\nexperiments on underdoped cuprates. It is not the case for the underdoped\nHgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$, the most symmetric and highest T$_c$ single layer\ncuprate, whose magnetic inhomogeneity is strongly suppressed. Also neutron\nscattering experiments reveal a unique pair of weakly dispersive magnetic modes\nin this material. We propose that these special properties stem from the\nsymmetric positioning of the O-dopants between adjacent CuO$_2$ layers that\nlead to a strong superexchange interaction between a pair of hole spins. In\nthis Letter we present a theoretical model, which gives a consistent\nexplanation to the anomalous magnetic properties of this material.\n", "  An Ising antiferromagnet on a stacked triangular lattice in zero field is\nstudied by Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on the character of the\nlow-temperature phase and the effect of the relative strength of the exchange\ninteraction in the stacking direction {\\alpha}. Our results support the\npresence of the 3D Wannier phase, with the sublattice magnetization structure\n(m, -m, 0) and power-law decaying m with the lattice size. The extent of this\nlow-temperature phase shrinks with decreasing {\\alpha}, however, it appears\neven at very low values if it is accessed from higher temperatures by\nsufficiently slow cooling.\n", "  We discuss the correspondence between metric $f(R)$ gravity and $\\omega=0$\nBrans-Dicke theory with a potential, by working out an example that reconfirms\nthis equivalence.\n", "  Topological insulators, with metallic boundary states protected against\ntime-reversal-invariant perturbations, are a promising avenue for realizing\nexotic quantum states of matter including various excitations of collective\nmodes predicted in particle physics, such as Majorana fermions and axions.\nAccording to theoretical predictions, a topological insulating state can emerge\nfrom not only a weakly interacting system with strong spin-orbit coupling, but\nalso in insulators driven by strong electron correlations. The Kondo insulator\ncompound SmB6 is an ideal candidate for realizing this exotic state of matter,\nwith hybridization between itinerant conduction electrons and localized\n$f$-electrons driving an insulating gap and metallic surface states at low\ntemperatures. Here we exploit the existence of surface ferromagnetism in SmB6\nto investigate the topological nature of metallic surface states by studying\nmagnetotransport properties at very low temperatures. We find evidence of\none-dimensional surface transport with a quantized conductance value of $e^2/h$\noriginating from the chiral edge channels of ferromagnetic domain walls,\nproviding strong evidence that topologically non-trivial surface states exist\nin SmB6.\n", "  Using the Schl\\\"{o}gl model as a paradigmatic example of a bistable\nreaction-diffusion system, we discuss some physically feasible options of open\nand closed loop spatio-temporal control of chemical wave propagation.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of the ability of the Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE) to answer outstanding questions in the neutrino\nsector. We consider the sensitivities to the mass hierarchy, the octant of\n\\theta_{23} and to CP violation using data from beam and atmospheric neutrinos.\nWe evaluate the dependencies on the precision with which \\theta_{13} will be\nmeasured by reactor experiments, on the detector size, beam power and exposure\ntime, on detector magnetization, and on the systematic uncertainties achievable\nwith and without a near detector. We find that a 35 kt far detector in DUNE\nwith a near detector will resolve the eight-fold degeneracy that is intrinsic\nto long baseline experiments and will meet the primary goals of oscillation\nphysics that it is designed for.\n", "  We construct level one dominant representations of the affine Kac-Moody\nalgebra $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_k$ on the equivariant cohomology groups of\nmoduli spaces of rank one framed sheaves on the orbifold compactification of\nthe minimal resolution $X_k$ of the $A_{k-1}$ toric singularity\n$\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_k$. We show that the direct sum of the fundamental\nclasses of these moduli spaces is a Whittaker vector for\n$\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_k$, which proves the AGT correspondence for pure\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ $U(1)$ gauge theory on $X_k$. We consider Carlsson-Okounkov\ntype Ext-bundles over products of the moduli spaces and use their Euler classes\nto define vertex operators. Under the decomposition\n$\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_k\\simeq \\mathfrak{h}\\oplus \\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_k$,\nthese vertex operators decompose as products of bosonic exponentials associated\nto the Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ and primary fields of\n$\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_k$. We use these operators to prove the AGT\ncorrespondence for $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal abelian quiver gauge theories\non $X_k$.\n", "  We address an information-theoretic approach to noise and disturbance in\nquantum measurements. Properties of corresponding probability distributions are\ncharacterized by means of both the R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Related\ninformation-theoretic measures of noise and disturbance are introduced. These\ndefinitions are based on the concept of conditional entropy. To motivate\nintroduced measures, some important properties of the conditional R\\'{e}nyi and\nTsallis entropies are discussed. There exist several formulations of entropic\nuncertainty relations for a pair of observables. Trade-off relations for noise\nand disturbance are derived on the base of known formulations of such a kind.\n", "  Equations of gravity when projected on spacetime horizons resemble\nNavier-Stokes equation of a fluid with a specific equation of state [1-3]. We\nshow that this equation of state describes massless ideal relativistic gas. We\nuse these results, and build an explicit and simple molecular model of the\nfluid living on the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole horizons.\nFor the spin zero Bose gas, our model makes two predictions: (i) The horizon\narea/entropy is quantized as given by Bekenstein's quantization rule, (ii) The\nmodel explains the correct type of proportionality between horizon area and\nentropy. However, for the physically relevant range of parameters, the\nproportionality constant is never equal to 1/4.\n", "  We demonstrate that particles are regularly accelerated while experiencing\ncurvature drift in flows driven by magnetic tension. Some examples of such\nflows include spontaneous turbulent reconnection and decaying\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, where magnetic field relaxes to a\nlower-energy configuration and transfers part of its energy to kinetic motions.\nThe opposite process, such as dynamo, will actually result in the net cooling\nof particles by the curvature drift. Being very generic, this acceleration\nmechanism is likely to be responsible in production of non-thermal particle\ndistribution in magnetically-dominant environments such as solar chromosphere,\npulsar magnetosphere, jets from supermassive black holes, $\\gamma$-ray bursts,\netc.\n", "  For an anyon model in two spatial dimensions described by a modular tensor\ncategory, the topological S-matrix encodes the mutual braiding statistics, the\nquantum dimensions, and the fusion rules of anyons. It is nontrivial whether\none can compute the S-matrix from a single ground state wave function. Here, we\ndefine a class of Hamiltonians consisting of local commuting projectors and an\nassociated matrix that is invariant under local unitary transformations. We\nargue that the invariant is equivalent to the topological S-matrix. The\ndefinition does not require degeneracy of the ground state. We prove that the\ninvariant depends on the state only, in the sense that it can be computed by\nany Hamiltonian in the class of which the state is a ground state. As a\ncorollary, we prove that any local quantum circuit that connects two ground\nstates of quantum double models (discrete gauge theories) with non-isomorphic\nabelian groups, must have depth that is at least linear in the system's\ndiameter.\n  As a tool for the proof, a manifestly Hamiltonian-independent notion of\nlocally invisible operators is introduced. This gives a sufficient condition\nfor a many-body state not to be generated from a product state by any small\ndepth quantum circuit; this is a many-body entanglement witness.\n", "  We show that the von Neumann--Lueders collapse rules in quantum mechanics\nalways select the unique state that maximises the quantum relative entropy with\nrespect to the premeasurement state, subject to the constraint that the\npostmeasurement state has to be compatible with the knowledge gained in the\nmeasurement. This way we provide an information theoretic characterisation of\nquantum collapse rules by means of the maximum relative entropy principle.\n", "  In this work we analyze the architecture of real urban mobility networks from\nthe multiplex perspective. In particular, based on empirical data about the\nmobility patterns in the cities of Bogot\\'a and Medell\\'{\\i}n, each city is\nrepresented by six multiplex networks, each one representing the\norigin-destination trips performed by a subset of the population corresponding\nto a particular socioeconomic status. The nodes of each multiplex are the\ndifferent urban locations whereas links represent the existence of a trip from\none node (origin) to another (destination). On the other hand, the different\nlayers of each multiplex correspond to the different existing transportation\nmodes. By exploiting the characterization of multiplex transportation networks\ncombining different transportation modes, we aim at characterizing the mobility\npatterns of each subset of the population. Our results show that the\nsocioeconomic characteristics of the population have an extraordinary impact in\nthe layer organization of these multiplex systems.\n", "  Building on the symmetry classification of disordered fermions, we give a\nproof of the proposal by Kitaev, and others, for a \"Bott clock\" topological\nclassification of free-fermion ground states of gapped systems with symmetries.\nOur approach differs from previous ones in that (i) we work in the standard\nframework of Hermitian quantum mechanics over the complex numbers, (ii) we\ndirectly formulate a mathematical model for ground states rather than\nspectrally flattened Hamiltonians, and (iii) we use homotopy-theoretic tools\nrather than K-theory. Key to our proof is a natural transformation that squares\nto the standard Bott map and relates the ground state of a d-dimensional system\nin symmetry class s to the ground state of a (d+1)-dimensional system in\nsymmetry class s+1. This relation gives a new vantage point on topological\ninsulators and superconductors.\n", "  We obtain exact solutions of the 2D Schr\\\"odinger equation for Hydrogen atom\nwith the lenear and Harmonic Potentials in noncommutative complex space, using\nthe Power-series expansion method. Hence we can say that the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in noncommutative complex space describes to the particles with spin\n(1/2)in an external uniform magnitic field. Where the noncommutativity play the\nrole of magnetic field with created the total magnetic moment of particle with\nspin 1/2, who in turn shifted the spectrum of energy. Such effects are similar\nto the Zeeman splitting in a commutative space.\n", "  Combining the electronic properties of graphene and molybdenum disulphide\n(MoS$_2$) monolayers in two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin hybrid nanocomposites\nhave been synthesized experimentally to create excellent electronic,\nelectrochemical, photovoltaic, photoresponsive and memory devices. Here,\nfirst-principles calculations are performed to investigate the electronic,\nelectrical and optical properties in hybrid G/MoS$_2$ and G/MoS$_2$/G\nnanocomposites. It turns out that weak van der Waals interactions dominate\nbetween graphene and MoS$_2$ with their intrinsic electronic properties\npreserved. Interestingly, tunable p-type doping of graphene is very easy to\nachieve by applying electric fields perpendicular to hybrid G/MoS$_2$ and\nG/MoS$_2$/G nanocomposites, because electrons can easily transfer from the\nDirac point of graphene to the conduction band of MoS$_2$ due to the work\nfunction of graphene close to the electronic affinity of MoS$_2$. Vertical\nelectric fields can generate strong p-type but weak n-type doping of graphene,\ninducing electron-hole pairs in hybrid G/MoS$_2$/G sandwiched nanocomposites.\nMoreover, improved optical properties in hybrid G/MoS$_2$ and G/MoS$_2$/G\nnanocomposites are also expected with potential photovoltaic and\nphotoresponsive applications.\n", "  A novel interpretation is given of Dirac's \"wave equation for the\nrelativistic electron\" as a quantum-mechanical one-particle equation. In this\ninterpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different\n\"topological spin\" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct\nparticles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the\nexistence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particular\nthe ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximal\nanalytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr-Newman\nspacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, \"zero-gravity\" means the limit $G\\to\n0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel\ninterpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be\ncapable of describing both the electron and the positron in \"external\" fields\nin many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a\nsingle position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were a\ntwo-particle equation! A Dirac equation is formulated for a ring-like\nbi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere in\nthe topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ring\nbi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-Broglie-Bohm type law extracted\nfrom the Dirac equation. As an application, the pertinent general-relativistic\nzero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr-Newman\nmagnetic moment be identified with the so-called \"anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe physical electron,\" not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is\nonly a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.\n", "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a proposed next generation\nsuperbeam experiment at Fermilab. Its aims include measuring the unknown\nneutrino oscillation parameters -- the neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of\nthe mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and the CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$. The\ncurrent and upcoming experiments T2K, NOvA and ICAL@INO will also be collecting\ndata for the same measurements. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity reach\nof DUNE in combination with these other experiments. We evaluate the least\nexposure required by DUNE to determine the above three unknown parameters with\nreasonable confidence. We find that for each case, the inclusion of data from\nT2K, NOvA and ICAL@INO help to achieve the same sensitivity with a reduced\nexposure from DUNE thereby helping to economize the configuration. Further, we\nquantify the effect of the proposed near detector on systematic errors and\nstudy the consequent improvement in sensitivity. We also examine the role\nplayed by the second oscillation cycle in furthering the physics reach of DUNE.\nFinally, we present an optimization study of the neutrino-antineutrino running\nof DUNE.\n", "  The existence of quantum correlations that allow one party to steer the\nquantum state of another party is a counterintuitive quantum effect that has\nbeen described already at the beginning of the past century. Steering occurs if\nentanglement can be proven although the description of the measurements on one\nparty is not known, while the other side is characterized. We introduce the\nconcept of steering maps that allow to unlock the sophisticated techniques\ndeveloped in regular entanglement detection to be used for certifying\nsteerability. As an application we show that this allows to go even beyond the\ncanonical steering scenario, enabling a generalized dimension-bounded steering\nwhere one only assumes the Hilbert space dimension on the characterized side,\nbut no description of the measurements. Surprisingly this does not weaken the\ndetection strength of very symmetric scenarios that have recently been carried\nout in experiments.\n", "  Second order integrals of motion for 3d quantum mechanical systems with\nposition dependent masses (PDM) are classified. Namely, all PDM systems are\nspecified which, in addition to their rotation invariance, admit at least one\nsecond order integral of motion. All such systems appear to be also shape\ninvariant and exactly solvable. Moreover, some of them possess the property of\ndouble shape invariance and can be solved using two different superpotentials.\nAmong them there are systems with double shape invariance which present nice\nbridges between the Coulomb and isotropic oscillator systems.\n  A simple algorithm for calculation the discrete spectrum and the\ncorresponding state vectors for the considered PDM systems is presented and\napplied to solve five of the found systems.\n", "  We propose a new material viscoelastic model and mathematical solution to\nsimulate relaxation modulus and viscoelastic response. The model formula of\nrelaxation modulus is extended from sigmoidal function considering nonlinear\nstrain hardening and softening. Its physical mechanism can be interpreted by a\nspring network viscous medium model with only five parameters in a simpler\nformat than the molecular-chain based polymer models to represent general\nmaterials. We also developed a three-dimensional finite-element method and\nrobust numerical algorithms to implement this model for solving partial\ndifferential equations. We validate the model through both experimental data\nand numerical simulations on a broad range of materials including bitumen,\nshape-memory polymer, spider-inspired silk, hydrogel, biomaterials and bone. By\nsatisfying the 2nd law of thermodynamics in the form of Calusius-Duhem\ninequality, the model is able to simulate creep and sinusoidal deformation, and\nenergy dissipation. As compared to Prony series, the most general model being\nused often with a large number of model parameters, the proposed model has\nimproved accuracy in fitting experimental data and predicting modulus outside\nof the experimental range, and the latter one is especially useful for material\ndesign. The new model also has higher numerical accuracy while competitive\nnumerical stability and computation speed for convergence.\n", "  With the help of our recently developed massively parallel DGDFT\n(Discontinuous Galerkin Density Functional Theory) methodology, we perform\nlarge-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations on phosphorene\nnanoribbons with armchair edges (ACPNRs) containing a few thousands to ten\nthousand atoms. The use of DGDFT allows us to systematically achieve\nconventional plane wave basis set type of accuracy, but with a much smaller\nnumber (about 15) of adaptive local basis (ALB) functions per atom for this\nsystem. The relatively small number degrees of freedom required to represent\nthe Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, together with the use of the pole expansion the\nselected inversion (PEXSI) technique that circumvents the need to diagonalize\nthe Hamiltonian, result in a highly efficient and scalable computational scheme\nfor analyzing the electronic structures of ACPNRs as well as its dynamics. The\ntotal wall clock time for calculating the electronic structures of large-scale\nACPNRs containing 1080-10800 atoms is only 10-25 s per self-consistent field\n(SCF) iteration, with accuracy fully comparable to that obtained from\nconventional planewave DFT calculations. For the ACPNR system, we observe that\nthe DGDFT methodology can scale to 5,000-50,000 processors. We use DGDFT based\nab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations to study the thermodynamic\nstability of ACPNRs. Our calculations reveal that a 2 * 1 edge reconstruction\nappears in ACPNRs at room temperature.\n", "  Superconductivity evolves as functions of pressure or doping from\ncharge-ordered phases in a variety of strongly correlated systems, suggesting\nthat there may be universal characteristics associated with the competition\nbetween superconductivity and charge order in these materials. We present an\ninelastic light (Raman) scattering study of the structural changes that precede\nthe pressure-tuned charge-density-wave (CDW) to superconductor transition in\none such system, ZrTe3. In certain phonon bands, we observe dramatic linewidth\nreductions that accompany CDW formation, indicating that these phonons couple\nstrongly to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the CDW. The same\nphonon bands, which represent internal vibrations of ZrTe3 prismatic chains,\nare suppressed at pressures above ~10 kbar, indicating a loss of long-range\norder within the chains, specifically amongst intrachain Zr-Te bonds. These\nresults suggest a distinct structural mechanism for the observed\npressure-induced suppression of CDW formation and provide insights into the\norigin of pressure-induced superconductivity in ZrTe3.\n", "  In this paper we consider twice-dimensionally reduced, generalized\nSeiberg-Witten equations, defined on a compact Riemann surface. A novel feature\nof the reduction technique is that the resulting equations produce an extra\n\"Higgs field\". Under suitable regularity assumptions, we show that the moduli\nspace of gauge-equivalent classes of solutions to the reduced equations, is a\nsmooth Kahler manifold and construct a pre-quantum line bundle over the moduli\nspace of solutions.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of negative energy densities in quantum field\ntheories with self-interaction. Specifically, we consider a class of integrable\nmodels (including the sinh-Gordon model) in which we investigate the\nexpectation value of the energy density in one-particle states. In this\nsituation, we classify the possible form of the stress-energy tensor from first\nprinciples. We show that one-particle states with negative energy density\ngenerically exist in non-free situations, and we establish lower bounds for the\nenergy density (quantum energy inequalities). Demanding that these inequalities\nhold reduces the ambiguity in the stress-energy tensor, in some situations\nfixing it uniquely. Numerical results for the lowest spectral value of the\nenergy density allow us to demonstrate how negative energy densities depend on\nthe coupling constant and on other model parameters.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically-protected spin textures that exhibit\nfascinating physical behaviors and large potential in highly energy efficient\nspintronic device applications. The main obstacles so far are that skyrmions\nhave been observed in only a few exotic materials and at low temperatures, and\nmanipulation of individual skyrmions has not yet been achieved. Here, we report\nthe observation of stable magnetic skyrmions at room temperature in ultrathin\ntransition metal ferromagnets with magnetic transmission soft x-ray microscopy.\nWe demonstrate the ability to generate stable skyrmion lattices and drive\ntrains of individual skyrmions by short current pulses along a magnetic\nracetrack. Our findings provide experimental evidence of recent predictions and\nopen the door to room-temperature skyrmion spintronics in robust thin-film\nheterostructures.\n", "  In this paper we study rank two commuting ordinary differential operators\nwith polynomial coefficients and the orbit space of the automorphisms group of\nthe first Weyl algebra on such operators. We prove that for arbitrary fixed\nspectral curve of genus one the space of orbits is infinite. Moreover, we prove\nin this case that for for any $n\\ge 1$ there is a pair of self-adjoint\ncommuting ordinary differential operators of rank two\n$L_4=(\\partial_x^2+V(x))^2+W(x)$, $L_{6}$, where $W(x),V(x)$ are polynomials of\ndegree $n$ and $n+2$. We also prove that there are hyperelliptic spectral\ncurves with the infinite spaces of orbits.\n", "  We consider the quantum dynamics of a charged particle evolving under the\naction of a constant homogeneous magnetic field, with emphasis on the discrete\nsubgroups of the Heisenberg group (in the Euclidean case) and of the SL(2, R)\ngroup (in the Hyperbolic case). We investigate completeness properties of\ndiscrete coherent states associated with higher order Euclidean and hyperbolic\nLandau levels, partially extending classic results of Perelomov and of\nBargmann, Butera, Girardello and Klauder. In the Euclidean case, our results\nfollow from identifying the completeness problem with known results from the\ntheory of Gabor frames. The results for the hyperbolic setting follow by using\na combination of methods from coherent states, time-scale analysis and the\ntheory of Fuchsian groups and their associated automorphic forms.\n", "  In this paper, we revise our main results involving the single particle\nmomentum distribution of bosonic trimer states in two and three dimensions. A\nsummary table makes easier the comparison between the matrix elements and the\ndifferent terms of the momentum distributions. We also show a practical method\nto continuously interpolate between different dimensions.\n", "  This paper describes state-of-the-art digital filtering techniques that are\npart of GEANA, an automatic data analysis software used for the GERDA\nexperiment. The discussed filters include a novel, nonlinear correction method\nfor ballistic deficits, which is combined with one of three shaping filters: a\npseudo-Gaussian, a modified trapezoidal, or a modified cusp filter. The\nperformance of the filters is demonstrated with a 762 g Broad Energy Germanium\n(BEGe) detector, produced by Canberra, that measures {\\gamma}-ray lines from\nradioactive sources in an energy range between 59.5 and 2614.5 keV. At 1332.5\nkeV, together with the ballistic deficit correction method, all filters produce\na comparable energy resolution of ~1.61 keV FWHM. This value is superior to\nthose measured by the manufacturer and those found in publications with\ndetectors of a similar design and mass. At 59.5 keV, the modified cusp filter\nwithout a ballistic deficit correction produced the best result, with an energy\nresolution of 0.46 keV. It is observed that the loss in resolution by using a\nconstant shaping time over the entire energy range is small when using the\nballistic deficit correction method.\n", "  The physical processes that control the partition of released magnetic energy\nbetween electrons and ions during reconnection is explored through\nparticle-in-cell simulations and analytical techniques. We demonstrate that the\ndevelopment of a large-scale parallel electric field and its associated\npotential controls the relative heating of electrons and ions. The potential\ndevelops to restrain heated exhaust electrons and enhances their heating by\nconfining electrons in the region where magnetic energy is released.\nSimultaneously the potential slows ions entering the exhaust below the\nAlfv\\'enic speed expected from the traditional counterstreaming picture of ion\nheating. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of the potential and therefore the\nrelative partition of energy between electrons and ions is not a constant but\nrather depends on the upstream parameters and specifically the upstream\nelectron normalized temperature (electron beta). These findings suggest that\nthe fraction of magnetic energy converted into the total thermal energy may be\nindependent of upstream parameters.\n", "  We present the results of a Lya profile analysis of 12 Lya emitters (LAEs) at\nz = 2.2 with high-resolution Lya spectra. We find that all 12 objects have a\nLya profile with the main peak redward of the systemic redshift defined by\nnebular lines, and five have a weak, secondary peak blueward of the systemic\nredshift (blue bump). The average velocity offset of the red main peak (the\nblue bump, if any) with respect to the systemic redshift is Delta_v_Lya,r =\n174+/- 19 km s-1 (Delta_v_Lya,b = -316+/-45 km s-1), which is smaller than\n(comparable to) that of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). The outflow velocities\ninferred from metal absorption lines in three individual and one stacked\nspectra are comparable to those of LBGs. The expanding shell model constructed\nby Verhamme et al. (2006) reproduces not only the Lya profiles but also other\nobserved quantities including the outflow velocity and the FWHM of nebular\nlines for the non-blue bump objects. On the other hand, the model predicts too\nhigh FWHMs of nebular lines for the blue bump objects, although this\ndiscrepancy may disappear if we introduce additional Lya photons produced by\ngravitational cooling. We show that the small Delta_v_Lya,r values of our\nsample can be explained by low neutral-hydrogen column densities of log(NHI) =\n18.9 cm-2 on average. This value is more than one order of magnitude lower than\nthose of LBGs but is consistent with recent findings that LAEs have high\nionization parameters and low Hi gas masses. This result suggests that low NHI\nvalues, giving reduced numbers of resonant scattering of Lya photons, are the\nkey to the strong Lya emission of LAEs.\n", "  A revolution in radio receiving technology is underway with the development\nof densely packed phased arrays for radio astronomy. This technology can\nprovide an exceptionally large field of view, while at the same time sampling\nthe sky with high angular resolution. Such an instrument, with a field of view\nof over 100 square degrees, is ideal for performing fast, all-sky, surveys,\nsuch as the \"intensity mapping\" experiment to measure the signature of Baryonic\nAcoustic Oscillations in the HI mass distribution at cosmological redshifts.\nThe SKA, built with this technology, will be able to do a billion galaxy\nsurvey. I will present a very brief introduction to radio interferometry, as\nwell as an overview of the Square Kilometre Array project. This will be\nfollowed by a description of the EMBRACE prototype and a discussion of results\nand future plans.\n", "  We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of the\nsupertrace, through the existence of a certain ground state projector. We build\nthis projector and check its properties to the first two orders in the number\noperator and to all orders in the deformation parameter. We then find the\nrelation between the gravitational and internal gauge couplings in the\nresulting unified three-dimensional Chern--Simons theory for Blencowe--Vasiliev\nhigher spin gravity coupled to fractional spin fields and internal gauge\npotentials. We also examine the model for integer or half-integer fractional\nspins, where infinite dimensional ideals arise and decouple, leaving finite\ndimensional gauge algebras $gl(2l+1)$ or $gl(l|l+1)$ and various real forms\nthereof.\n", "  Research on graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as\nsilicene, germanene, phosphorene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), graphitic\ncarbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphitic zinc oxide (g-ZnO) and molybdenum disulphide\n(MoS2), has recently received considerable interest owing to their outstanding\nproperties and wide applications. Looking beyond this field, combining the\nelectronic structures of 2D materials in ultrathin van der Waals\nheterojunctions has also emerged to widely study theoretically and\nexperimentally to explore some new properties and potential applications beyond\ntheir single components. Here, this article reviews our recent theoretical\nstudies on the structural, electronic, electrical and optical properties of 2D\nvan der Waals heterojunctions using density functional theory calculations,\nincluding the Graphene/Silicene, Graphene/Phosphorene, Graphene/g-ZnO,\nGraphene/MoS2 and g-C3N4/MoS2 heterojunctions. Our theoretical simulations,\ndesigns and calculations show that novel 2D van der Waals heterojunctions\nprovide a promising future for electronic, electrochemical, photovoltaic,\nphotoresponsive and memory devices in the experiments.\n", "  The influence of size differences, shape, mass and persistent motion on phase\nseparation in binary mixtures has been intensively studied. Here we focus on\nthe exclusive role of diffusivity differences in binary mixtures of equal-sized\nparticles. We find an effective attraction between the less diffusive\nparticles, which are essentially caged in the surrounding species with the\nhigher diffusion constant. This effect leads to phase separation for systems\nabove a critical size: A single close-packed cluster made up of the less\ndiffusive species emerges. Experiments for testing of our predictions are\noutlined.\n", "  A topological defect in the form of the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex is\nconsidered as a gauge-flux-carrying tube that is impenetrable for quantum\nmatter. Charged scalar matter field is quantized in the vortex background with\nthe perfectly reflecting (Dirichlet) boundary condition imposed at the side\nsurface of the vortex. We show that a current circulating around the vortex and\na magnetic field directed along the vortex are induced in the vacuum, if the\nCompton wavelength of the matter field exceeds considerably the transverse size\nof the vortex. The vacuum current and magnetic field are periodic in the value\nof the gauge flux of the vortex, providing a quantum-field-theoretical\nmanifestation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The total flux of the induced vacuum\nmagnetic field attains noticeable finite values even for the Compton wavelength\nof the matter field exceeding the transverse size of the vortex by just three\norders of magnitude.\n", "  We discuss spreading estimates for dynamical systems given by the iteration\nof an extended CMV matrix. Using a connection due to\nCantero--Gr\\\"unbaum--Moral--Vel\\'azquez, this enables us to study spreading\nrates for quantum walks in one spatial dimension. We prove several general\nresults which establish quantitative upper and lower bounds on the spreading of\na quantum walk in terms of estimates on a pair of associated matrix cocycles.\nTo demonstrate the power and utility of these methods, we apply them to several\nconcrete cases of interest. In the case where the coins are distributed\naccording to an element of the Fibonacci subshift, we are able to rather\ncompletely describe the dynamics in a particular asymptotic regime. As a\npleasant consequence, this supplies the first concrete example of a quantum\nwalk with anomalous transport, to the best of our knowldege. We also prove\nballistic transport for a quantum walk whose coins are periodically\ndistributed.\n", "  2D materials are expected to be favorable channel materials for field-effect\ntransistor (FET) with extremely short channel length because of their superior\nimmunity to short-channel effects (SCE). Graphene, which is the most famous 2D\nmaterial, has no bandgap without additional techniques and this property is\nmajor hindrance in reducing the drain leakage. Therefore, 2D materials with\nfinite band gap, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, e.g. MoS2\nWSe2) or phosphorene, are required for the low power consumption FETs. Hafnium\ndisulfide (HfS2) is a novel TMD, which has not been investigated as channel\nmaterial. We focused on its potential for well-balanced mobility and bandgap\nproperties. The higher electron affinity of Hf dichalcogenides compared with Mo\nor W chalcogenides facilitates the formation of low resistance contact and\nstaggered heterojunction with other 2D materials. Here we demonstrate the first\nfew layer HfS2 FET with robust current saturation and high current on/off ratio\nof more than 10^4.\n", "  We use frequency-resolved spectroscopy to examine the energy spectra of the\nprominent low frequency QPO and its harmonic in GX 339-4. We track the\nevolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright\nlow/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO\nand time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or\nsimilar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is\ndramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and\nthe QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.\nClearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean\nthat the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved\nspectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are\nconsistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low\ntemperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be\ndescribed by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar\nto that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic\nshow signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged\nspectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the\nintermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton\nscattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences\nseen in the soft state. Instead, we propose that the soft Compton region is\nlocated predominantly above the disc while the hard Compton is from the hotter\ninner flow. Our results therefore point to multiple possible mechanisms for\nproducing harmonic features in the power spectrum. The dominant mechanism in a\ngiven observation is likely a function of both inclination angle and inner disc\nradius.\n", "  Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the\nelectronic structure near the Fermi level and the topological property of the\nBi(111) films grown on the Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) substrate were studied. Very\ndifferent from the bulk Bi, we found another surface band near the $\\bar{M}$\npoint besides the two well-known surface bands on the Bi(111) surface. With\nthis new surface band, the bulk valence band and the bulk conduction band of Bi\ncan be connected by the surface states. Our band mapping revealed odd number of\nFermi crossings of the surface bands, which provided a direct experimental\nsignature that Bi(111) thin films of a certain thickness on the\nBi$_2$Te$_3$(111) substrate can be topologically nontrivial in three dimension.\n", "  We address the problem of properly quantifying information in quantum theory.\nBrukner and Zeilinger proposed the concept of an operationally invariant\nmeasure based on measurement statistics. Their measure of information is\ncalculated with probabilities generated in a complete set of mutually\ncomplementary observations. This approach was later criticized for several\nreasons. We show that some critical points can be overcome by means of natural\nextension or reformulation of the Brukner-Zeilinger approach. In particular,\nthis approach is connected with symmetric informationally complete\nmeasurements. The \"total information\" of Brukner and Zeilinger can further be\ntreated in the context of mutually unbiased measurements as well as general\nsymmetric informationally complete measurements. The Brukner-Zeilinger measure\nof information is also examined in the case of detection inefficiencies. It is\nshown to be decreasing under the action of bistochastic maps. The\nBrukner-Zeilinger total information can be used for estimating the map norm of\nquantum operations.\n", "  The integrated proton-deuteron cross section $\\widetilde\\sigma$ for the case\nof the incident proton vector polarization $p_y^p$ and tensor polarization\n$P_{xz}$ of the deuteron target provides a null test signal for time-reversal\ninvariance violating but P-parity conserving (TVPC) effects. We study the\nnull-test observable $\\widetilde\\sigma$ within the Glauber theory of the\ndouble-polarized $pd$ scattering. Full spin dependence of the ordinary strong\n$pN$ scattering amplitudes and different types of the hypothetical TVPC\npN-amplitudes are taken into account. We show that the contribution from the\nexchange of the lowest-mass meson allowed in the TVPC interaction, i.e. the\n$\\rho$-meson, to the null-test observable $\\widetilde\\sigma$ is zero. The axial\n$h_1$ meson exchange makes a non-zero contribution. We find that inclusion of\nthe Coulomb interaction does not lead to divergence of the cross section\n$\\widetilde\\sigma$ and calculate its energy dependence at the proton beam\nenergy 100-1000 MeV.\n", "  The Continuum Dislocation Dynamics (CDD) theory and the Discrete Dislocation\nDynamics (DDD) method are compared based on concise mathematical formulations\nof the coarse graining of discrete data. A numerical tool for converting from a\ndiscrete to a continuum representation of a given dislocation configuration is\ndeveloped, which allows to directly compare both simulation approaches based on\ncontinuum quantities (e.g. scalar density, geometrically necessary densities,\nmean curvature). Investigating the evolution of selected dislocation\nconfigurations within analytically given velocity fields for both DDD and CDD\nreveals that CDD contains a surprising number of important microstructural\ndetails.\n", "  We show that, measured in a backscattering geometry, the polar Kerr effect is\nabsent if the nonlocal electromagnetic response function respects Onsager\nsymmetry, characteristic of thermodynamic states that preserve time-reversal\nsymmetry. A key element is an expression for the reflectivity tensor in terms\nof the retarded Green's function.\n", "  We study the relaxation of the Peano chain's deformations in the presence of\ngaussian noise. The D=2 spring network which models the chain's elasticity has\nno bulk, but only boundaries:its continuum version would be a flat and thin\nelastic strip covering the plane, smoothly curved so as to follow the Peano\npattern. We find normal modes, named Peano modes: in the same way as crystal\nwaves are sustained by the matching of translations with rotations,the Peano\nmodes correspond to the matching of the eightfold symmetry with discrete\ndilatations. The eightfold symmetry is shared by the Peano chain with the\noctagonal quasicrystal, but the latter has a much higher connectivity. The\nrelaxation process which starts from the Peano chain is found to mark the\nsaddle point separating the solid from the liquid, the phase separation being\ndriven by anisotropy. For the equivalent quantum mechanical problem this\ncorresponds to the D=2 quantum delocalization transition.Various experimental\nobservations, regarding a priori uncorrelated systems, come together within the\nviewpoint proposed here, at least as far as their qualitative behavior is\nconcerned. 1)Two features observed in experiments on D=2 colloids can be\nunderstood within the model: the bosonic peak occurring at low frequencies in\nthe phononic spectrum and the time evolution and spatial structure of\nexcitations: if initially concentrated in small regions, they progressively\nexpand towards larger size. 2) The so-called inverse energy cascade of D=2\nturbulence 3)The recently observed liquid to quasicrystal transition in bilayer\nwater 4) Self-similar DNA conformations are connected here with structures\nlying at the boundary between a liquid and a solid, such as colloids and\nquasicrystals.\n", "  Starting with the early alchemists, a holy grail of science has been to make\ndesired materials by modifying the attributes of basic building blocks.\nBuilding blocks that show promise for assembling new complex materials can be\nsynthesized at the nanoscale with attributes that would astonish the ancient\nalchemists in their versatility. However, this versatility means that making\ndirect connection between building block attributes and bulk behavior is both\nnecessary for rationally engineering materials, and difficult because building\nblock attributes can be altered in many ways. Here we show how to exploit the\nmalleability of the valence of colloidal nanoparticle \"elements\" to directly\nand quantitatively link building block attributes to bulk behavior through a\nstatistical thermodynamic framework we term \"digital alchemy\". We use this\nframework to optimize building blocks for a given target structure, and to\ndetermine which building block attributes are most important to control for\nself assembly, through a set of novel thermodynamic response functions, moduli\nand susceptibilities. We thereby establish direct links between the attributes\nof colloidal building blocks and the bulk structures they form. Moreover, our\nresults give concrete solutions to the more general conceptual challenge of\noptimizing emergent behaviors in nature, and can be applied to other types of\nmatter. As examples, we apply digital alchemy to systems of truncated\ntetrahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and isotropically interacting spheres that\nself assemble diamond, FCC, and icosahedral quasicrystal structures,\nrespectively.\n", "  The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect predicts additional anisotropies in\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background due to time variation of the gravitational\npotential when the expansion of the universe is not matter dominated. The ISW\neffect is therefore expected in the early universe, due to the presence of\nrelativistic particles at recombination, and in the late universe, when dark\nenergy starts to dominate the expansion. Deviations from the standard picture\ncan be parameterized by $A_{e\\text{ISW}}$ and $A_{l\\text{ISW}}$, which rescale\nthe overall amplitude of the early and late ISW effects. Analyzing the most\nrecent CMB temperature spectra from the Planck 2015 release, we detect the\npresence of the early ISW at high significance with $A_{e\\mathrm{ISW}} =\n1.06\\pm0.04$ at 68% CL and an upper limit for the late ISW of\n$A_{l\\mathrm{ISW}} < 1.1$ at 95% CL. The inclusion of the recent polarization\ndata from the Planck experiment results in $A_{e\\mathrm{ISW}} = 0.999\\pm0.028$\nat 68% CL, in better agreement with the value $A_{e\\mathrm{ISW}} = 1$ of a\nstandard cosmology. When considering the recent detections of the late ISW\ncoming from correlations between CMB temperature anisotropies and weak lensing,\na value of $A_{l\\mathrm{ISW}}=0.85\\pm0.21$ is predicted at 68% CL, showing a\n$4\\sigma$ evidence. We discuss the stability of our result in the case of an\nextra relativistic energy component parametrized by the effective neutrino\nnumber $N_\\mathrm{eff}$ and of a CMB lensing amplitude $A_\\mathrm{L}$.\n", "  The 2-point angular correlation function $w(\\theta)$ (2PACF), where $\\theta$\nis the angular separation between pairs of galaxies, provides the transversal\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal almost model-independently. In this\npaper we use 409,337 luminous red galaxies in the redshift range $z =\n[0.440,0.555]$ obtained from the tenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS DR10) to estimate $\\theta_{\\rm{BAO}}(z)$ from the 2PACF at six\nredshift {shells}. Since noise and systematics can hide the BAO signature in\nthe $w - \\theta$ plane, we also discuss some criteria to localize the acoustic\nbump. We identify two sources of model-dependence in the analysis, namely, the\nvalue of the acoustic scale from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements\nand the correction in the $\\theta_{\\rm{BAO}}(z)$ position due to projection\neffects. Constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w$(z)$ from\nthe $\\theta_{\\rm{BAO}}(z)$ diagram are derived, as well as from a joint\nanalysis with current CMB measurements. We find that the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel as well as some of its extensions are in good agreement with these\n$\\theta_{\\rm{BAO}}(z)$ measurements.\n", "  We combine single- and two-photon interference procedures for characterizing\nany multi-port linear optical interferometer accurately and precisely. Accuracy\nis achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to\nspatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision\nare attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to curve simulated using\nmeasured source spectra. We employ bootstrapping statistics to quantify the\nresultant degree of precision. A scattershot approach is devised to effect a\nreduction in the experimental time required to characterize the interferometer.\nThe efficacy of our characterization procedure is verified by numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  The order of the superconducting phase transition is a classical problem.\nSingle-component type-2 superconductors exhibit a continuous \"inverted-XY\"\nphase transition, as was first demonstrated for U(1) lattice London\nsuperconductors by a celebrated duality mapping with subsequent backing by\nnumerical simulations. Here we study this problem in multiband U(1) London\nsuperconductors and find evidence that by contrast the model has a tricritical\npoint. The superconducting phase transition becomes first-order when the\nJosephson length is sufficiently large compared to the magnetic field\npenetration length. We present evidence that the fluctuation-induced dipolar\ninteraction between vortex loops makes the phase transition discontinuous. We\ndiscuss that this mechanism is also relevant for the phase transitions in\nmulticomponent gauge theories with higher broken symmetry.\n", "  We present an $A4$-based model where neutrino masses arise from a combination\nof see-saw mechanisms. The model is motivated by several small mixing and mass\nparameters indicated by the data. These are $\\theta_{13}$, the solar mass\nsplitting, and the small deviation of $\\theta_{23}$ from maximal mixing (=\n$\\pi/4$). We take the above as indications that at some level the small\nquantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a\nzero order, should be either 0 or $\\pi/4$. Accordingly, in this model the\nType-II see-saw dominates and generates the larger atmospheric mass splitting\nand sets $\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$. The other mixing angles are vanishing as is the\nsolar splitting. We show how the $A4$ assignment for the lepton doublets leads\nto this form. We also specify the $A4$ properties of the right-handed neutrinos\nwhich result in a smaller Type-I see-saw contribution that acts as a\nperturbation and shifts the angles $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\theta_{13}$ into the\ncorrect range and the desired value of $\\Delta m^2_{solar}$ is produced. The\n$A4$ symmetry results in relationships between these quantities as well as with\na small deviation of $\\theta_{23}$ from $\\pi/4$. If the right-handed neutrino\nmass matrix, $M_R$, is chosen real then there is no leptonic CP-violation and\nonly Normal Ordering is admissible. If $M_R$ is complex then Inverted Ordering\nis also allowed with the proviso that the CP-phase, $\\delta$, is large, i.e.,\n$\\sim \\pi/2$ or $-\\pi/2$. The preliminary results from NO$\\nu$A favouring\nNormal Ordering and $\\delta$ near $-\\pi/2$ imply quasi-degenerate neutrino\nmasses in this model.\n", "  An optical phonon limited velocity model has been employed to investigate\nhigh-field transport in a selection of layered 2D materials for both, low-power\nlogic switches with scaled supply voltages, and high-power, high-frequency\ntransistors. Drain currents, effective electron velocities and intrinsic\ncut-off frequencies as a function of carrier density have been predicted thus\nproviding a benchmark for the optical phonon limited high-field performance\nlimits of these materials. The optical phonon limited carrier velocities of a\nselection of transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus are found to\nbe modest as compared to their n-channel silicon counterparts, questioning the\nutility of these devices in the source-injection dominated regime. h-BN, at the\nother end of the spectrum, is shown to be a very promising material for\nhigh-frequency high-power devices, subject to experimental realization of high\ncarrier densities, primarily due to its large optical phonon energy.\nExperimentally extracted saturation velocities from few-layer MoS2 devices show\nreasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement with predicted values.\nTemperature dependence of measured vsat is discussed and found to fit a\nvelocity saturation model with a single material dependent fit parameter.\n", "  Surface plasmon polaritons scattering from 2D subwavelength silicon wires is\ninvestigated using finite difference time domain method. It is shown that\ncoupling an incident surface plasmon polariton to inter-cavity modes of the\nparticle can dramatically changes transmitted fields and plasmon induced\nforces. In particular, both transmission and optical forces are highly\nsensitive to the particle size that is related to the excitation of whispering\ngallery modes or standing-wave modes depending on the particle shape and size.\nThis features might have potential sensing applications.\n", "  Quantum Telescope is a recent idea aimed at beating the diffraction limit of\nspaceborne telescopes and possibly also other distant target imaging systems.\nThere is no agreement yet on the best setup of such devices, but some\nconfigurations have been already proposed. In this Letter we characterize the\npredicted performance of Quantum Telescopes and their possible limitations. Our\nextensive simulations confirm that the presented model of such instruments is\nfeasible and the device can provide considerable gains in the angular\nresolution of imaging in the UV, optical and infrared bands. We argue that it\nis generally possible to construct and manufacture such instruments using the\nlatest or soon to be available technology. We refer to the latest literature to\ndiscuss the feasibility of the proposed QT system design.\n", "  We have studied the vector meson spectral function (VMSF) in a hot and dense\nmedium within an effective QCD model namely the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and\nits Polyakov Loop extended version (PNJL) with and without the effect of\nisoscalar vector interaction (IVI). The effect of the IVI has been taken into\naccount using the ring approximation. We obtained the dilepton production rate\n(DPR) using the VMSF and observed that at moderate temperature it is enhanced\nin the PNJL model as compared to the NJL and Born rate due to the suppression\nof color degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this proceedings we present a state-of-the-art method of calculating\nthermodynamic potential at finite temperature and finite chemical potential,\nusing Hard Thermal Loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) up to\nnext-to-next-leading-order (NNLO). The resulting thermodynamic potential\nenables us to evaluate different thermodynamic quantities including pressure\nand various quark number susceptibilities (QNS). Comparison between our\nanalytic results for those thermodynamic quantities with the available lattice\ndata shows a good agreement.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) can be a powerful mechanism\namplifying the magnetic field in core-collapse supernovae. Whether initially\nweak magnetic fields can be amplified by this instability to dynamically\nrelevant strengths is still a matter of debate. One of the main uncertainties\nconcerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability. Parasitic\ninstabilities of both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode type have been\nsuggested to play a crucial role in this process, disrupting MRI channel flows\nand quenching magnetic field amplification. We perform two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional sheering-disc simulations of a differentially rotating\nprotoneutron star layer in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with unprecedented\nhigh numerical accuracy, finding that Kelvin-Helmholtz parasitic modes dominate\ntearing modes in the regime of large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers, as encountered close to the surface of protoneutron stars. They also\ndetermine the maximum magnetic field stress achievable during the exponential\ngrowth of the MRI. Our results are consistent with the theory of parasitic\ninstabilities based on a local stability analysis. To simulate the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities properly, a very high numerical resolution is\nnecessary. Using ninth-order spatial reconstruction schemes, we find that at\nleast eight grid zones per MRI channel are necessary to simulate the growth\nphase of the MRI and reach an accuracy of ~10 per cent in the growth rate,\nwhile more than ~60 zones per channel are required to achieve convergent\nresults for the value of the magnetic stress at MRI termination.\n", "  We study disordered topological insulators with time reversal symmetry.\nRelying on the noncommutative index theorem which relates the Chern number to\nthe projection onto the Fermi sea and the magnetic flux operator, we give a\nprecise definition of the $Z_2$ index which is a noncommutative analogue of the\nAtiyah-Singer $Z_2$ index. We prove that the noncommutative $Z_2$ index is\nrobust against any time-reversal symmetric perturbation including disorder\npotentials as long as the spectral gap at the Fermi level does not close.\n", "  A meter-long, 23-liter EJ-309 liquid scintillator detector has been\nconstructed to study the light collection and pulse-shape discrimination\nperformance of elongated scintillator cells for the PROSPECT reactor\nantineutrino experiment. The magnitude and uniformity of light collection and\nneutron/gamma discrimination power in the energy range of antineutrino inverse\nbeta decay products have been studied using gamma and spontaneous fission\ncalibration sources deployed along the cell long axis. We also study\nneutron-gamma discrimination and light collection abilities for differing PMT\nand reflector configurations. Key design features for optimizing MeV-scale\nresponse and background rejection capabilities are identified.\n", "  Recently we have published a paper [Irgaziev, Phys. Rev. C 91, 024002 (2015)]\nwhere the $S$-matrix pole method (SMP) which is only valid for resonances has\nbeen developed to derive a new explicit expression for the asymptotic\nnormalization coefficient (ANC), and is applied to the low-energy resonant\nstates of nucleon$+\\alpha$ and $\\alpha+^{12}\\rm{C}$ systems. The SMP results\nare compared with the effective-range expansion method (EFE) results. In the\npresent paper the SMP and EFE plus the Pad\\'e-approximation are applied to\nstudy the excited 2$^+$ resonant states of $^{8}\\rm{Be}$. A contradiction is\nfound between descriptions of the experimental phase shift data for\n$\\alpha\\alpha$ scattering and of the $^{8}\\rm{Be}$ resonant energy for 2$^+$\nstate. Using the EFE method, we also calculate the ANC for the $^{8}\\rm{Be}$\nground 0$^+$ state with a very small width. This ANC agrees well with the value\ncalculated using the known analytical expression for narrow resonances. In\naddition, for the $\\alpha+^{12}\\rm{C}$ states1$^-$ and 3$^-$ the SMP results\nare compared with the Pad\\'e-approximation results. We find that the\nPad\\'e-approximation improves a resonance width description compared with the\nEFE results. The EFE method is also used to calculate the ANCs for the bound\n$^{16}\\rm{O}$ ground 0$^+$ state and for the excited 1$^-$ and 2$^+$ levels\nwhich are situated near the threshold of $\\alpha+^{12}\\rm{C}$ channel.\n", "  We argue that the so-called l lysinium succinate (journal of crystal growth\n426 (2015) 135), zinc chloride doped l lysinium succinate (journal of crystal\ngrowth 428 (2015) 24), and l threonine phthalate (journal of crystal growth 427\n(2015) 29) and sodium acetate doped l tyrosine (spectrochimica acta 136a (2015)\n168) are all dubious crystals. Taking these compounds as examples we show that\nthat edax is an inappropriate method for characterization of new materials\nbased on elemental composition data.\n", "  We discuss prospects for probing Z-prime and non-standard neutrino\ninteractions using neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering with ultra-low energy\n(~ 10 eV) threshold Si and Ge detectors. The analysis is performed in the\ncontext of a specific and contemporary reactor-based experimental proposal,\ndeveloped in cooperation with the Nuclear Science Center at Texas A&M\nUniversity, and referencing available technology based upon economical and\nscalable detector arrays. For expected exposures, we show that sensitivity to\nthe Z-prime mass is on the order of several TeV, and is complementary to the\nLHC search with low mass detectors in the near term. This technology is also\nshown to provide sensitivity to the neutrino magnetic moment, at a level that\nsurpasses terrestrial limits, and is competitive with more stringent\nastrophysical bounds. We demonstrate the benefits of combining silicon and\ngermanium detectors for distinguishing between classes of models of new\nphysics, and for suppressing correlated systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Photosynthetic complexes improve the transfer of excitation energy from\nperipheral antennas to reaction centers in several ways. In particular, a\ndownward energy funnel can direct excitons in the right direction, while\ncoherent excitonic delocalization can enhance transfer rates through the\ncooperative phenomenon of supertransfer. However, isolating the role of purely\ncoherent effects is difficult because any change to the delocalization also\nchanges the energy landscape. Here, we show that the relative importance of the\ntwo processes can be determined by comparing the natural light-harvesting\napparatus with counterfactual models in which the delocalization and the energy\nlandscape are altered. Applied to the example of purple bacteria, our approach\nshows that although supertransfer does enhance the rates somewhat, the\nenergetic funnelling plays the decisive role. Because delocalization has a\nminor role (and is sometimes detrimental), it is most likely not adaptive,\nbeing a side-effect of the dense chlorophyll packing that evolved to increase\nlight absorption per reaction center.\n", "  Previously, [1207.0458] proposed an astrophysical explanation of narrow\ngamma-ray line-like feature(s) at ~100 GeV from Galactic Center region observed\nby Fermi/LAT [1205.4700]. The model of [1207.0458] is based on the inverse\nCompton scattering of external ultra-violet/X-ray radiation by a cold\nultra-relativistic electron-positron pulsar wind. We show that the extra broad\n~30 MeV component should arise from Comptonization of cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation. We estimate the main parameters of this component and\nshow that it can be detectable with MeV telescopes such as CGRO/COMPTEL. The\nlocation of CGRO/COMPTEL unidentified source GRO J1823-12 close to excess of\n105-120 GeV emission (Reg.1 of [1205.4700]) can be interpreted as an argument\nin favour of astrophysical model of the narrow feature(s) at ~100 GeV.\n", "  The energy deposition spectra of $^{37}$Ar and $^{71}$Ge in a miniature\nproportional counter are measured and compared in detail to the model response\nsimulated with Geant4. A certain modification of the Geant4 code, making it\npossible to trace the deexcitation of atomic shells properly, is suggested.\nModified Geant4 is able to reproduce a response of particle detectors in detail\nin the keV energy range. This feature is very important for the laboratory\nexperiments that search for massive sterile neutrinos as well as for dark\nmatter searches that employ direct detection of recoil nuclei. This work\ndemonstrates the reliability of Geant4 simulation at low energies.\n", "  High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is investigated for H$_2^+$ and its\nisotopomers under seven- and ten-cycle trapezoidal laser pulses at 800 nm\nwavelength and $I$=4$\\times 10^{14}$ W$/$cm$^2$ intensity. We solved\nnumerically full-dimensional electronic time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We show that the HHG at\nthe falling edge of a trapezoidal laser pulse can result in redshift and\ncomplexity on the total HHG spectrum which can be removed by considering\ndifferent laser pulse duration and nuclear motion not possible for sin$^2$ and\nGaussian laser pulses. We resolve the redshifts and complexities of the HHG\nspectra into different electronic and vibrational states and their\ninterferences.\n", "  The propagation of charged particles, including cosmic rays, in a partially\nordered magnetic field is characterized by a diffusion tensor whose components\ndepend on the particle's Larmor radius $R_L$ and the degree of order in the\nmagnetic field. Most studies of the particle diffusion presuppose a scale\nseparation between the mean and random magnetic fields (e.g., there being a\npronounced minimum in the magnetic power spectrum at intermediate scales).\nScale separation is often a good approximation in laboratory plasmas, but not\nin most astrophysical environments such as the interstellar medium (ISM).\nModern simulations of the ISM have numerical resolution of order 1 pc, so the\nLarmor radius of the cosmic rays that dominate in energy density is at least\n$10^{6}$ times smaller than the resolved scales. Large-scale simulations of\ncosmic ray propagation in the ISM thus rely on oversimplified forms of the\ndiffusion tensor. We take the first steps towards a more realistic description\nof cosmic ray diffusion for such simulations, obtaining direct estimates of the\ndiffusion tensor from test particle simulations in random magnetic fields (with\nthe Larmor radius scale being fully resolved), for a range of particle energies\ncorresponding to $10^{-2}\\lesssim R_L/l_c \\lesssim 10^{3}$, where $l_c$ is the\nmagnetic correlation length. We obtain explicit expressions for the cosmic ray\ndiffusion tensor for $R_L/l_c \\ll 1$, that might be used in a sub-grid model of\ncosmic ray diffusion. The diffusion coefficients obtained are closely connected\nwith existing transport theories that include the random walk of magnetic\nlines.\n", "  Folding uncertainty in theoretical models into Bayesian parameter estimation\nis necessary in order to make reliable inferences. A general means of achieving\nthis is by marginalizing over model uncertainty using a prior distribution\nconstructed using Gaussian process regression (GPR). As an example, we apply\nthis technique to the measurement of chirp mass using (simulated)\ngravitational-wave signals from binary black holes that could be observed using\nadvanced-era gravitational-wave detectors. Unless properly accounted for,\nuncertainty in the gravitational-wave templates could be the dominant source of\nerror in studies of these systems. We explain our approach in detail and\nprovide proofs of various features of the method, including the limiting\nbehavior for high signal-to-noise, where systematic model uncertainties\ndominate over noise errors. We find that the marginalized likelihood\nconstructed via GPR offers a significant improvement in parameter estimation\nover the standard, uncorrected likelihood both in our simple one-dimensional\nstudy, and theoretically in general. We also examine the dependence of the\nmethod on the size of training set used in the GPR; on the form of covariance\nfunction adopted for the GPR, and on changes to the detector noise power\nspectral density.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of thermoelectric currents in\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet tunnel junctions in high magnetic fields. The\nthermoelectric signals are due to a spin-dependent lifting of particle-hole\nsymmetry, and are found to be in excellent agreement with recent theoretical\npredictions. The maximum Seebeck coefficient inferred from the data is about\n$-100~\\mathrm{\\mu V/K}$, much larger than commonly found in metallic\nstructures. Our results directly prove the coupling of spin and heat transport\nin high-field superconductors.\n", "  We demonstrated the operation of a high finesse optical cavity without\nutilizing an active feedback system to stabilize the resonance. The effective\nfinesse, which is a finesse including the overall system performance, of the\ncavity was measured to be $394,000 \\pm 10,000$, and the laser power stored in\nthe cavity was $2.52 \\pm 0.13$ kW, which is approximately 187,000 times greater\nthan the incident power to the cavity. The stored power was stabilized with a\nfluctuation of $1.7 \\%$, and we confirmed continuous cavity operation for more\nthan two hours. This result has the potential to trigger an innovative\nevolution for applications that use optical resonant cavities such as compact\nphoton sources with laser-Compton scattering or cavity enhanced absorption\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Electron scattering off an Anderson impurity immersed in the bulk of a 3D\ntopological insulator is studied in the strong coupling regime, where the\ntemperature $T$ is lower than the Kondo temperature $T_K$. The system displays\neither a self-screened Kondo effect, or a Kondo effect with SO(3) or SO(4)\ndynamical symmetries. Low temperature Kondo scattering for systems with SO(3)\nsymmetry displays the behavior of a singular Fermi liquid, an elusive property\nthat so far has been observed only in tunneling experiments. This is\ndemonstrated through the singular behavior as $T \\to 0$ of the specific heat,\nmagnetic susceptibility and impurity resistivity, that are calculated using\nwell known (slightly adapted) conformal field theory techniques. Quite\ngenerally, the low temperature dependence of some of these observables displays\na remarkable distinction between the SO(n=3,4) Kondo effect, compared with the\nstandard SU(2) one.\n", "  A search is performed for the production of a massive W' boson decaying to a\ntop and a bottom quark. The data analysed correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the\nLHC in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The hadronic decay products\nof the top quark with high Lorentz boost from the W' boson decay are detected\nas a single top flavoured jet. The use of jet substructure algorithms allows\nthe top quark jet to be distinguished from standard model QCD background.\nLimits on the production cross section of a right-handed W' boson are obtained,\ntogether with constraints on the left-handed and right-handed couplings of the\nW' boson to quarks. The production of a right-handed W' boson with a mass below\n2.02 TeV decaying to a hadronic final state is excluded at 95% confidence\nlevel. This mass limit increases to 2.15 TeV when both hadronic and leptonic\ndecays are considered, and is the most stringent lower mass limit to date in\nthe tb decay mode.\n", "  A Fully Many-Body Localized (FMBL) quantum disordered system is characterized\nby the emergence of an extensive number of local conserved operators that\nprevents the relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. These local conserved\noperators can be seen as the building blocks of the whole set of eigenstates.\nIn this paper, we propose to construct them explicitly via some block\nreal-space renormalization. The principle is that each RG step diagonalizes the\nsmallest remaining blocks and produces a conserved operator for each block. The\nfinal output for a chain of $N$ spins is a hierarchical organization of the $N$\nconserved operators with $\\left(\\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln 2}\\right)$ layers. The\nsystem-size nature of the conserved operators of the top layers is necessary to\ndescribe the possible long-ranged order of the excited eigenstates and the\npossible critical points between different FMBL phases. We discuss the\nsimilarities and the differences with the Strong Disorder RSRG-X method that\ngenerates the whole set of the $2^N$ eigenstates via a binary tree of $N$\nlayers. The approach is applied to the Long-Ranged Quantum Spin-Glass Ising\nmodel, where the constructed excited eigenstates are found to be exactly like\nground states in another disorder realization, so that they can be either in\nthe paramagnetic phase, in the spin-glass phase or critical.\n", "  We report that population dynamics in fluctuating environment accompanies\nmathematically equivalent structure to steady state thermodynamics. By\nemploying the structure, population growth in fluctuating environment is\ndecomposed into housekeeping and excess parts. The housekeeping part represents\nthe integral of stationary growth rate for each condition during a history of\nthe environmental change. The excess part accounts for the excess growth\ngenerated when environment is switched. Focusing on the excess growth, we\nobtain Clausius inequality, which gives the upper bound of the excess growth.\nThe equality is shown to be achieved in quasistatic environmental changes. We\nalso clarify that this bound can be evaluated by \"lineage fitness\" that is an\nexperimentally observable quantity.\n", "  The Lefschetz-thimble approach to path integrals is applied to a one-site\nmodel of electrons, i.e., the one-site Hubbard model. Since the one-site\nHubbard model shows a non-analytic behavior at the zero temperature and its\npath integral expression has the sign problem, this toy model is a good testing\nground for an idea or a technique to attack the sign problem. Semiclassical\nanalysis using complex saddle points unveils the significance of interference\namong multiple Lefschetz thimbles to reproduce the non-analytic behavior by\nusing the path integral. If the number of Lefschetz thimbles is insufficient,\nwe found not only large discrepancies from the exact result, but also\nthermodynamic instabilities. Analyzing such singular behaviors semiclassically,\nwe propose a criterion to identify the necessary number of Lefschetz thimbles.\nWe argue that this interference of multiple saddle points is a key issue to\nunderstand the sign problem of the finite-density quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  We calculate elastic scattering of positronium (Ps) by the Xe atom using the\nrecently developed pseudopotential method [I. I. Fabrikant and G. F. Gribakin,\nPhys. Rev. A 90, 052717 (2014)] and review general features of Ps scattering\nfrom heavier rare-gas atoms: Ar, Kr, and Xe. The total scattering cross section\nis dominated by two contributions: elastic scattering and Ps ionization\n(breakup). To calculate the Ps ionization cross sections we use the\nbinary-encounter method for Ps collisions with an atomic target. Our results\nfor the ionization cross section agree well with previous calculations carried\nout in the impulse approximation. Our total Ps-Xe cross section, when plotted\nas a function of the projectile velocity, exhibits similarity with the\nelectron-Xe cross section for the collision velocities higher than 0.8 a.u.,\nand agrees very well with the measurements at Ps velocities above 0.5 a.u.\n", "  Periodic microphases universally emerge in systems for which short-range\ninter-particle attraction is frustrated by long-range repulsion. The\nmorphological richness of these phases makes them desirable material targets,\nbut our relatively coarse understanding of even simple models limits our grasp\nof their assembly. We report here the solution of the equilibrium phase\nbehavior of a microscopic microphase former through specialized Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The results for the ordered regime qualitatively agree with a\nLandau-type free energy description and highlight the nontrivial dynamical\ninterplay between micelle, gel and microphase formation.\n", "  We present an analysis of 23 absorption systems along the lines of sight\ntowards 18 quasars in the redshift range of $0.4 \\leq z_{abs} \\leq 2.3$\nobserved on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using the Ultraviolet and Visual\nEchelle Spectrograph (UVES). Considering both statistical and systematic error\ncontributions we find a robust estimate of the weighted mean deviation of the\nfine-structure constant from its current, laboratory value of\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha=\\left(0.22\\pm0.23\\right)\\times10^{-5}$, consistent with\nthe dipole variation reported in Webb et al. and King et al. This paper also\nexamines modelling methodologies and systematic effects. In particular we focus\non the consequences of fitting quasar absorption systems with too few absorbing\ncomponents and of selectively fitting only the stronger components in an\nabsorption complex. We show that using insufficient continuum regions around an\nabsorption complex causes a significant increase in the scatter of a sample of\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ measurements, thus unnecessarily reducing the overall\nprecision. We further show that fitting absorption systems with too few\nvelocity components also results in a significant increase in the scatter of\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ measurements, and in addition causes\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ error estimates to be systematically underestimated.\nThese results thus identify some of the potential pitfalls in analysis\ntechniques and provide a guide for future analyses.\n", "  A search for vector-like quarks and excited quarks in events containing a top\nquark and a $W$ boson in the final state is reported here. The search is based\non $20.3 {fb}^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data taken at the LHC at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector. Events with one\nor two leptons, and one, two or three jets are selected with the additional\nrequirement that at least one jet contains a $b$-quark. Single-lepton events\nare also required to contain at least one large-radius jet from the hadronic\ndecay of a high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ $W$ boson or a top quark. No significant excess\nover the expected background is observed and upper limits on the cross-section\ntimes branching ratio for different vector-like quark and excited-quark model\nmasses are derived. For the excited-quark production and decay to $Wt$ with\nunit couplings, quarks with masses below 1500 GeV are excluded and\ncoupling-dependent limits are set.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering measurement is performed on a breathing\npyrochlore antiferromagnet Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. The observed dispersionless\nexcitations are explained by a crystalline electric field (CEF) Hamiltonian of\nKramers ion Yb3+ of which the local symmetry exhibits C3v point group symmetry.\nThe magnetic susceptibility previously reported is consistently reproduced by\nthe energy scheme of the CEF excitations. The obtained wave functions of the\nground state Kramers doublet exhibit the planer-type anisotropy. The result\ndemonstrates that Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 is an experimental realization of breathing\npyrochlore antiferromagnet with a pseudospin S = 1/2 having easy-plane\nanisotropy.\n", "  This paper overviews various phenomena related to the concept of isospin\nsymmetry. The focus is on N~Z nuclei, which are excellent laboratories of\nisospin physics. The theoretical framework applied is nuclear Density\nFunctional Theory and its isospin- and angular-momentum projected extensions,\nas well as symmetry-projected multi-reference models. The topics covered\ninclude: isospin impurities, superallowed beta decays, beta-transitions in\nmirror nuclei, isospin breaking hadronic interactions, mirror and triplet\nbinding energy differences, and isoscalar pairing.\n", "  Colliding wind binaries (CWBs) have been considered as a possible high energy\n$\\gamma$-ray sources for some time, however no system other than $\\eta$ Car has\nbeen detected. In the paper a sample of seven CWBs (WR 11, WR 70, WR 137, WR\n140, WR 146, WR 147) which, by means of theoretic modelling, were deemed most\npromising candidates, was analyzed using almost 7 years of the Fermi-LAT data.\nWR 11 ($\\gamma^2$ Vel) was detected at 6.1$\\sigma$ confidence level with a\nphoton flux in 0.1-100 GeV range\n$(1.8\\pm0.6)\\times10^{-9}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and an energy flux\n$(2.7\\pm0.5)\\times10^{-12}~~\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. At the adopted\ndistance $d=340$ pc this corresponds to a luminosity\n$L=(3.7\\pm0.7)\\times10^{31}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. This luminosity amounts to\n$\\sim6\\times10^{-6}$ fraction of the total wind kinetic power and\n$\\sim1.6\\times10^{-4}$ fraction of the power injected into the wind-wind\ninteraction region of this system. Upper limits were set on the high energy\nflux from the WR 70 and WR 140 systems.\n", "  New polarization potentials have been determined based on: 1) the latest\nphoto-neutron cross section evaluation and a missing factor of two in previous\nwork, and 2) the mass dependency of the symmetry energy, $a_{sym}(A)$. The\nmagnitude of the first one is 35\\% stronger than the currently accepted\npolarization potential. The second one opens up the possibility for a\nparameter-free polarization potential. Both polarization potentials are\nessentially the same for heavy nuclei. The polarization effect on quadrupole\ncollectivity is more substantial than previously assumed for light nuclei.\nParticular cases are discussed where long-standing discrepancies between\nhigh-precision Coulomb-excitation and lifetime measurements still remain. A\nsolution to the long-standing discrepancy between $B(E2; 0^+_1\\rightarrow\n2^+_1)$ values determined in $^{18}$O by several Coulomb-excitation studies and\na high-precision lifetime measurement is provided in favor of the latter.\nPolarization effects in light nuclei also influence the determination of\nspectroscopic quadrupole moments in Coulomb-excitation measurements. The\nhindrance of polarizability observed in the photo-neutron cross section for\nsingle-closed shell nuclei is calculated to have a negligible effect on\nquadrupole collectivity, within the existing experimental uncertainties.\n", "  Recently a concept of self-excited and hidden attractors was suggested: an\nattractor is called a self-excited attractor if its basin of attraction\noverlaps with neighborhood of an equilibrium, otherwise it is called a hidden\nattractor. For example, hidden attractors are attractors in systems with no\nequilibria or with only one stable equilibrium (a special case of\nmultistability and coexistence of attractors). While coexisting self-excited\nattractors can be found using the standard computational procedure, there is no\nstandard way of predicting the existence or coexistence of hidden attractors in\na system. In this plenary survey lecture the concept of self-excited and hidden\nattractors is discussed, and various corresponding examples of self-excited and\nhidden attractors are considered.\n", "  We use the functional renormalization group and the $\\epsilon$-expansion\nconcertedly to explore multicritical universality classes for coupled\n$\\bigoplus_i O(N_i)$ vector-field models in three Euclidean dimensions.\nExploiting the complementary strengths of these two methods we show how to make\nprogress in theories with large numbers of interactions, and a large number of\npossible symmetry-breaking patterns. For the three- and four-field models we\nfind a new fixed point that arises from the mutual interaction between\ndifferent field sectors, and we establish the absence of infrared-stable fixed\npoint solutions for the regime of small $N_i$. Moreover, we explore these\nsystems as toy models for theories that are both asymptotically safe and\ninfrared complete. In particular, we show that these models exhibit complete\nrenormalization group trajectories that begin and end at nontrivial fixed\npoints.\n", "  We demonstrated theoretically that a circularly polarized electromagnetic\nfield substantially modifies electronic properties of a periodical chain of\nquantum rings. Particularly, the field opens band gaps in the electron energy\nspectrum of the chain, generates edge electron currents and induces the\nFano-like features in the electron transport through the finite chain. These\neffects create physical prerequisites for the development of optically\ncontrolled nanodevices based on a set of coupled quantum rings.\n", "  Critical dynamics of cortical neurons have been intensively studied over the\npast decade. Neuronal avalanches provide the main experimental as well as\ntheoretical tools to consider criticality in such systems. Experimental studies\nshow that critical neuronal avalanches show mean-field behavior. There are\nstructural as well as recently proposed [Phys. Rev. E 89, 052139 (2014)]\ndynamical mechanisms which can lead to mean-field behavior. In this work we\nconsider a simple model of neuronal dynamics based on threshold self-organized\ncritical models with synaptic noise. We investigate the role of high average\nconnectivity, random long range connections, as well as synaptic noise in\nachieving mean-field behavior. We employ finite-size scaling in order to\nextract critical exponents with good accuracy. We conclude that relevant\nstructural mechanisms responsible for mean-field behavior cannot be justified\nin realistic models of the cortex. However, strong dynamical noise, which can\nhave realistic justifications, always leads to mean-field behavior regardless\nof the underlying structure. Our work provides a different (dynamical) origin\nthan the conventionaly accepted (structural) mechanisms for mean-field behavior\nin neuronal avalanches.\n", "  Long-lived, colour-triplet scalars are a generic prediction of unnatural, or\nsplit, composite Higgs models where the spontaneous global-symmetry breaking\nscale $f \\gtrsim 10$ TeV and an unbroken $SU(5)$ symmetry is preserved. Since\nthe triplet scalars are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons they are split from the\nmuch heavier composite-sector resonances and are the lightest exotic, coloured\nstates. This makes them ideal to search for at colliders. Due to discrete\nsymmetries the triplet scalar decays via a dimension-six term and given the\nlarge suppression scale $f$ is often metastable. We show that existing searches\nfor collider-stable R-hadrons from Run-I at the LHC forbid a triplet scalar\nmass below 845 GeV, whereas with $300\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at 13 TeV triplet\nscalar masses up to 1.4 TeV can be discovered. For shorter lifetimes\ndisplaced-vertex searches provide a discovery reach of up to 1.8 TeV. In\naddition we present exclusion and discovery reaches of future hadron colliders\nas well as indirect limits that arise from modifications of the Higgs\ncouplings.\n", "  The expected hitting time of discrete quantum walks on a hypercube (HC) is\nnumerically known to be exponentially shorter than that of their classical\nanalogs in terms of the scaling with the HC dimension. Recent numerical\nanalyses illustrated that this scaling exists not only on the bare HC, but also\nwhen the HC graph is symmetrically and locally embedded into larger graphs. The\npresent work investigates the necessity of symmetry and locality for the\nspeed-up by considering embeddings that are nonsymmetric or nonlocal. We\nprovide numerical evidence that the exponential speed-up survives also in these\ncases. Furthermore, our numerical simulations demonstrate that removing a\nsingle edge from the HC also does not destroy the exponential speed-up. In the\nnonlocal embedding of the HC we encounter dark states, which we analyze. We\nprovide a general and detailed presentation of the mapping that reduces the\nexponentially large Hilbert space of the quantum walk to an effective subspace\nof polynomial scaling. This mapping is our essential tool to numerically study\nquantum walks in such high-dimensional structures.\n", "  Networks of open quantum systems with feedback have become an active area of\nresearch for applications such as quantum control, quantum communication and\ncoherent information processing. A canonical formalism for the interconnection\nof open quantum systems using quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs)\nhas been developed by Gough, James and co-workers and has been used to develop\npractical modeling approaches for complex quantum optical, microwave and\noptomechanical circuits/networks. In this paper we fill a significant gap in\nexisting methodology by showing how trapped modes resulting from feedback via\ncoupled channels with finite propagation delays can be identified\nsystematically in a given passive linear network. Our method is based on the\nBlaschke-Potapov multiplicative factorization theorem for inner matrix-valued\nfunctions, which has been applied in the past to analog electronic networks.\nOur results provide a basis for extending the Quantum Hardware Description\nLanguage (QHDL) framework for automated quantum network model construction\n(Tezak \\textit{et al.} in Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A, Math. Phys. Eng. Sci.\n370(1979):5270-5290, to efficiently treat scenarios in which each\ninterconnection of components has an associated signal propagation time delay.\n", "  Memory effects can lead to history-dependent behavior of a system, and they\nare ubiquitous in our daily life and have broad applications. Here we explore\npossibilities of generating memory effects in simple isolated quantum systems.\nBy utilizing geometrical effects from a class of lattices supporting flat-bands\nconsisting of localized states, memory effects could be observed in ultracold\natoms in optical lattices. As the optical lattice continuously transforms from\na triangular lattice into a kagome lattice with a flat band, history-dependent\ndensity distributions manifest quantum memory effects even in noninteracting\nsystems, including fermionic as well as bosonic systems in the proper ranges of\ntemperatures. Rapid growth in ultracold technology predicts a bright future for\nquantum memory-effect systems, and here two prototypical applications of\ngeometry-induced quantum memory effects are proposed: An accelerometer\nrecording the mechanical change rate in a coupled system and a rate-controlled\nmemvalve where the rate of ramping the lattice potential acts as a control of\nthe remnant density in the lattice.\n", "  In the context of the theory of symplectic-Haantjes manifolds, we construct\nthe Haantjes structures of generalized St\\\"ackel systems and, as a particular\ncase, of the quasi-bi-Hamiltonian systems. As an application, we recover the\nHaantjes manifolds for the rational Calogero model with three particles and for\nthe Benenti systems.\n", "  The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will perform a\nsystematic investigation of ionization cooling with muon beams of momentum\nbetween 140 and 240\\,MeV/c at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ISIS facility.\nThe measurement of ionization cooling in MICE relies on the selection of a pure\nsample of muons that traverse the experiment. To make this selection, the MICE\nMuon Beam is designed to deliver a beam of muons with less than $\\sim$1\\%\ncontamination. To make the final muon selection, MICE employs a\nparticle-identification (PID) system upstream and downstream of the cooling\ncell. The PID system includes time-of-flight hodoscopes, threshold-Cherenkov\ncounters and calorimetry. The upper limit for the pion contamination measured\nin this paper is $f_\\pi < 1.4\\%$ at 90\\% C.L., including systematic\nuncertainties. Therefore, the MICE Muon Beam is able to meet the stringent\npion-contamination requirements of the study of ionization cooling.\n", "  This paper considers a system of two parallel quantum Hall layers with total\nfilling factor $0$ or $1$. When the distance between the layers is small\nenough, electrons and holes in opposite layers form inter-layer excitons, which\nhave a finite effective mass and interact via a dipole-dipole potential.\nResults are presented for the chemical potential $\\mu$ of the resulting bosonic\nsystem as a function of the exciton concentration $n$ and the interlayer\nseparation $d$. Both $\\mu$ and the interlayer capacitance have an unusual\nnonmonotonic dependence on $d$, owing to the interplay between an increasing\ndipole moment and an increasing effective mass with increasing $d$. A phase\ntransition between superfluid and Wigner crystal phases is shown to occur at $d\n\\propto n^{-1/10}$. Results are derived first via simple intuitive arguments,\nand then verified with more careful analytic derivations and numeric\ncalculations.\n", "  Considering the role of black hole singularity in quantum evolution, a\nresolution to the firewall paradox is presented. It is emphasized that if an\nobserver has the singularity as a part of his spacetime, then the\nsemi-classical evolution would be non-unitary as viewed by him. Specifically, a\nfree-falling observer inside the black hole would have a Hilbert space with\nnon-unitary evolution; a quantum jump for particles encountering the\nsingularity to outside of the horizon as late Hawking radiations. The\nnon-unitariness in the jump resembles the one in collapse of wave function, but\npreserves entanglements. Accordingly, we elaborate the first postulate of black\nhole complementarity: freely falling observers who pass through the event\nhorizon would have non-unitary evolution, while it does not have physically\nmeasurable effects for them. Besides, no information would be lost in the\nsingularity. Taking the modified picture into account, the firewall paradox can\nbe resolved, respecting No Drama. A by-product of our modification is that\nroughly half of the entropy of the black hole is released close to the end of\nevaporation in the shape of very hot Hawking radiation.\n", "  We study cross-Kerr (CK) effect on an optomechanical system driven by\ntwo-tone fields. We show that in the presence of the CK effect, a bistable\nbehavior of the mean photon number in the cavity becomes more robust against\nthe fluctuations of the frequency detuning between the cavity mode and the\ncontrol field. The bistability can also be turned into a tri-stability within\nthe experimentally accessible range of the system parameters. Also, we find\nthat the symmetric profile of the optomechanically induced transparency is\nbroken and the zero-absorption point is shifted in the presence of the CK\neffect. This shift can be used to measure the strength of the CK effect, and\nthe asymmetric absorption profiles can be employed to engineer a high quality\nfactor of the cavity.\n", "  A metasurface lens (meta-lens) bends light using nanostructures on a flat\nsurface. Macroscopic meta-lenses (mm- to cm-scale diameter) have been quite\ndifficult to simulate and optimize, due to the large area, the lack of\nperiodicity, and the billions of adjustable parameters. We describe a method\nfor designing a large-area meta-lens that allows not only prediction of the\nefficiency and far-field, but also optimization of the shape and position of\neach individual nanostructure, with a computational cost that is almost\nindependent of the lens size. As examples, we design three large NA=0.94\nmeta-lenses: One with 79% predicted efficiency for yellow light, one with\ndichroic properties, and one broadband lens. All have a minimum feature size of\n100nm.\n", "  It is shown that the scattering of laser radiation on cavitation ruptures in\nfluids is similar to the scattering by gas particles. When the characteristic\ndimensions of microscopic voids and bubbles are considerably smaller than the\nlaser wavelength, the scattered light is in the Rayleigh regime and allows\ndetecting cavitation in the very early stages of its inception. The simple\nestimates of the scattered radiation intensity and the dynamics of its changes\nin connection with the generation of cavitation in the test volume are\nobtained, allowing us to find the critical conditions for the cavitation\ninception.\n", "  The DGLAP and CCFM approaches to perturbative QCD evolution have been\ninvestigated by examining correlations of charmed hadron pairs in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. The theoretical models are compared to the data\ntaken by the LHCb experiment. Differences in the parton kinematics between the\ntwo approaches are discussed. In general a model incorporating NLO diagrams\nmatched to parton showers describes the data best.\n", "  For supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges in four, five and\nsix dimensions, a conserved current belongs to the linear multiplet. In the\ncase of six-dimensional $\\cal N=(1,0)$ Poincar\\'e supersymmetry, we present a\nconsistent deformation of the linear multiplet which describes chiral\nanomalies. This is achieved by developing a superform formulation for the\ndeformed linear multiplet. In the abelian case, we compute a nonlocal effective\naction generating the gauge anomaly.\n", "  The importance of charge reservoir layers for supplying holes to the CuO$_2$\nplanes of cuprate superconductors has long been recognized. Less attention has\nbeen paid to the screening of the charge transfer by the intervening ionic\nlayers. We address this issue in the case of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, where CuO\nchains supply the holes for the planes. We present a simple\ndielectric-screening model that gives a linear correlation between the relative\ndisplacements of ions along the $c$ axis, determined by neutron powder\ndiffraction, and the hole density of the planes. Applying this model to the\ntemperature dependent shifts of ions along the $c$ axis, we infer a charge\ntransfer of 5-10% of the hole density from the planes to the chains on warming\nfrom the superconducting transition to room temperature. Given the significant\ncoupling of $c$-axis displacements to the average charge density, we point out\nthe relevance of local displacements for screening charge modulations and note\nrecent evidence for dynamic screening of in-plane quasiparticles. This line of\nargument leads us to a simple model for atomic displacements and charge\nmodulation that is consistent with images from scanning-tunneling microscopy\nfor underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$.\n", "  We present a calculation of the electric and magnetic form factors of\nground-state octet and decuplet baryons including strange quarks. We work with\na combination of Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark propagator and\ncovariant Bethe-Salpeter equations describing baryons as bound states of three\n(non-perturbative) quarks. Our form factors for the octet baryons are in good\nagreement with corresponding lattice data at finite $Q^2$; deviations in some\nisospin channels for the magnetic moments can be explained by missing meson\ncloud effects. At larger $Q^2$ our quark core calculation has predictive power\nfor both, the octet and decuplet baryons.\n", "  We consider the nonabelian sandpile model defined on directed trees by Ayyer,\nSchilling, Steinberg and Thi\\'ery (Commun. Math. Phys, 2013) and restrict it to\nthe special case of a one-dimensional lattice of $n$ sites which has open\nboundaries and disordered hopping rates. We focus on the joint distribution of\nthe integrated currents across each bond simultaneously, and calculate its\ncumulant generating function exactly. Surprisingly, the process conditioned on\nseeing specified currents across each bond turns out to be a renormalised\nversion of the same process. We also remark on a duality property of the large\ndeviation function. Lastly, all eigenvalues and both Perron eigenvectors of the\ntilted generator are determined.\n", "  We formulate a damped oscillating particle method to solve the stationary\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE). The ground state solutions are found\nby a converging damped oscillating evolution equation that can be discretized\nwith symplectic numerical techniques. The method is demonstrated for three\ndifferent cases: for the single-component NLSE with an attractive\nself-interaction, for the single-component NLSE with a repulsive self\ninteraction and a constraint on the angular momentum, and for the two-component\nNLSE with a constraint on the total angular momentum. We reproduce the so\ncalled yrast curve for the single-component case, described in [A. D. Jackson\net al., Europhys. Lett. 95, 30002 (2011)], and produce for the first time an\nanalogous curve for the two-component NLSE. The numerical results are compared\nwith analytic solutions and competing numerical methods. Our method is well\nsuited to handle a large class of equations and can easily be adapted to\nfurther constraints and components.\n", "  This Letter describes a model-agnostic search for pairs of jets (dijets)\nproduced by resonant and non-resonant phenomena beyond the Standard Model in\n3.6 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.\nThe distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for\nlocal excesses above a data-derived estimate of the smoothly falling prediction\nof the Standard Model. The data are also compared to a Monte Carlo simulation\nof Standard Model angular distributions derived from the rapidity of the two\njets. No evidence of anomalous phenomena is observed in the data, which are\nused to exclude, at 95% CL, quantum black holes with threshold masses below 8.3\nTeV, 8.1 TeV, or 5.3 TeV in three different benchmark scenarios; resonance\nmasses below 5.2 TeV for excited quarks, 2.6 TeV in a $W^\\prime$ model, a range\nof masses starting from $m_{Z^\\prime}=1.5$ TeV and couplings from $g_q = 0.2$\nin a $Z^\\prime$ model; and contact interactions with a compositeness scale\nbelow 12.0 TeV and 17.5 TeV respectively for destructive and constructive\ninterference between the new interaction and QCD processes. These results\nsignificantly extend the ATLAS limits obtained from 8 TeV data. Gaussian-shaped\ncontributions to the mass distribution are also excluded if the effective\ncross-section exceeds values ranging from approximately 50-300 fb for masses\nbelow 2 TeV to 2-20 fb for masses above 4 TeV.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the question that in what sense empty $AdS_{5}$\nblack brane geometry can be thought of as RG-flow. We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity.\n", "  The H.E.S.S. experiment in Namibia, Africa, is a high energy gamma ray tele-\nscope sensitive in the energy range from 100 Gev to a few tens of TeV, via the\nuse of the atmospheric Cherenkov technique. To minimize the systematic errors\non the derived fluxes of the measured sources, one has to calculate the impact\nof the atmospheric properties, in particular the extinction parameter of the\nCherenkov light ( 300-650 nm) exploited to observe and reconstruct atmospheric\nparticle showers initiated by gamma-ray photons. A lidar can provide this kind\nof information for some given wavelengths within this range. In this paper we\nreport on the hardware components, operation and data acquisition of such a\nsystem installed at the H.E.S.S. site.\n", "  With the goal to elucidate the nature of spin-dependent electronic transport\nin ferromagnetic atomic contacts, we present here a combined experimental and\ntheoretical study of the conductance and shot noise of metallic atomic contacts\nmade of the 3d ferromagnetic materials Fe, Co, and Ni. For comparison, we also\npresent the corresponding results for the noble metal Cu. Conductance and shot\nnoise measurements, performed using a low-temperature break junction setup,\nshow that in these ferromagnetic nanowires: (i) there is no conductance\nquantization of any kind, (ii) transport is dominated by several partially-open\nconduction channels, even in the case of single-atom contacts, and (iii) the\nFano factor of large contacts saturates to values that clearly differs from\nthose of monovalent (nonmagnetic) metals. We rationalize these observations\nwith the help of a theoretical approach that combines molecular dynamics\nsimulations to describe the junction formation with nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction techniques to compute the transport properties within the\nLandauer-Buettiker framework. Our theoretical approach successfully reproduces\nall the basic experimental results and it shows that all the observations can\nbe traced back to the fact that the d bands of the minority-spin electrons play\na fundamental role in the transport through ferromagnetic atomic-size contacts.\nThese d bands give rise to partially open conduction channels for any contact\nsize, which in turn lead naturally to the different observations described\nabove. Thus, the transport picture for these nanoscale ferromagnetic wires that\nemerges from the ensemble of our results is clearly at variance with the well\nestablished conduction mechanism that governs the transport in macroscopic\nferromagnetic wires, where the d bands are responsible for the magnetism but do\nnot take part in the charge flow.\n", "  Recent theories predict that when a supercooled liquid approaches the glass\ntransition, particle clusters with a special \"amorphous order\" nucleate within\nthe liquid, which lead to static correlations dictating the dramatic slowdown\nof liquid relaxation. The prediction, however, has yet to be verified in 3D\nexperiments. Here, we design a colloidal system, where particles are confined\ninside spherical cavities with an amorphous layer of particles pinned at the\nboundary. Using this novel system, we capture the amorphous-order particle\nclusters and demonstrate the development of a static correlation. Moreover, by\ninvestigating the dynamics of spherically confined samples, we reveal a\nprofound influence of the static correlation on the relaxation of colloidal\nliquids. In analogy to glass-forming liquids with randomly pinned particles, we\npropose a simple relation for the change of the configurational entropy of\nconfined colloidal liquids, which quantitatively explains our experimental\nfindings and illustrates a divergent static length scale during the colloidal\nglass transition.\n", "  It is a significant challenge to predict the network topology from a small\namount of dynamical observations. Different from the usual framework of the\nnode-based reconstruction, two optimization approaches (i.e., the global and\npartitioned reconstructions) are proposed to infer the structure of undirected\nnetworks from dynamics. These approaches are applied to evolutionary games\noccurring on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks via compressed\nsensing, which can more efficiently achieve higher reconstruction accuracy with\nrelatively small amounts of data. Our approaches provide different perspectives\non effectively reconstructing complex networks.\n", "  We consider the easy-plane limit of bipartite SU($N$) Heisenberg Hamiltonians\nwhich have a fundamental representation on one sublattice and the conjugate to\nfundamental on the other sublattice. For $N=2$ the easy plane limit of the\nSU(2) Heisenberg model is the well known quantum XY model of a lattice\nsuperfluid. We introduce a logical method to generalize the quantum XY model to\narbitrary $N$, which keeps the Hamiltonian sign-free. We show that these\nquantum Hamiltonians have a world-line representation as the statistical\nmechanics of certain tightly packed loop models of $N$-colors in which\nneighboring loops are disallowed from having the same color. In this loop\nrepresentation we design an efficient Monte Carlo cluster algorithm for our\nmodel. We present extensive numerical results for these models on the two\ndimensional square lattice, where we find the nearest neighbor model has\nsuperfluid order for $N\\leq 5$ and valence-bond order for $N> 5$. By\nintroducing SU($N$) easy-plane symmetric four-spin couplings we are able to\ntune across the superfluid-VBS phase boundary for all $N\\leq 5$. We present\nclear evidence that this quantum phase transition is first order for $N=2$ and\n$N=5$, suggesting that easy-plane deconfined criticality runs away generically\nto a first order transition for small-$N$.\n", "  The construction of exact linearized solutions to the Einstein equations\nwithin the Bondi-Sachs formalism is extended to the case of linearization about\nde Sitter spacetime. The gravitational wave field measured by distant observers\nis constructed, leading to a determination of the energy measured by such\nobservers. It is found that gravitational wave energy conservation does not\nnormally apply to inertial observers, but that it can be formulated for a class\nof accelerated observers, i.e. with worldlines that are timelike but not\ngeodesic.\n", "  In Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories, it is known that the\nconical singularity arises at the center of a spherically symmetric body\n($r=0$) in the case where the parameter $\\alpha_{{\\rm H}4}$ characterizing the\ndeviation from the Horndeski Lagrangian $L_4$ approaches a non-zero constant as\n$r \\to 0$. We derive spherically symmetric solutions around the center in full\nGLPV theories and show that the GLPV Lagrangian $L_5$ does not modify the\ndivergent property of the Ricci scalar $R$ induced by the non-zero\n$\\alpha_{{\\rm H}4}$. Provided that $\\alpha_{{\\rm H}4}=0$, curvature scalar\nquantities can remain finite at $r=0$ even in the presence of $L_5$ beyond the\nHorndeski domain. For the theories in which the scalar field $\\phi$ is directly\ncoupled to $R$, we also obtain spherically symmetric solutions inside/outside\nthe body to study whether the fifth force mediated by $\\phi$ can be screened by\nnon-linear field self-interactions. We find that there is one specific model of\nGLPV theories in which the effect of $L_5$ vanishes in the equations of motion.\nWe also show that, depending on the sign of a $L_5$-dependent term in the field\nequation, the model can be compatible with solar-system constraints under the\nVainshtein mechanism or it is plagued by the problem of a divergence of the\nfield derivative in high-density regions.\n", "  The published theoretical data of few models (PHSD/HSD both with and without\nchiral symmetry restoration) applied to experimental data from collisions of\nnuclei from SIS to LHC energies, have been analised by using of the\nmeta-analysis what allowed to localize a possible phase singularities of\nnuclear matter created in the central nucleus-nucleus collisions: The ignition\nof the Quark-Gluon Plasma's (QGP) drop begins already at top SIS/BEVALAC\nenergies. This drop of QGP occupies small part, 15$\\%$ (an averaged radius\nabout 5.3 fm if radius of fireball is 10 fm), of the whole volume of a fireball\ncreated at top SIS energies. The drop of exotic matter goes through a split\ntransition (separated boundaries of sharp (1-st order) crossover and chiral\nsymmetry restoration) between QGP and Quarkyonic matter at energy around\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,$3.5 GeV. The boundary of transition between Quarkyonic and\nHadronic matter was localized between $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,$4.4 and 5.3 GeV and\nit is not being intersected by the phase trajectory of that drop. Critical\nendpoint has been localized at around $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,$9.3 GeV and a triple\npoint - at around 12 GeV, the boundary of smooth (2-nd order) crossover\ntransition with chiral symmetry restoration between Quarkyonic matter and QGP\nwas localized between $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,$9.3 and 12 GeV. The phase trajectory\nof a hadronic corona, enveloping the drop, stays always in the hadronic phase.\n", "  We study the implications of a possible unstable particle with mass $M_X<$\nTeV for the Higgs stability, naturalness and inflation. We pay particular\nattention to the case $M_X\\approx$ 750 GeV, suggested by recent results of\nATLAS and CMS on diphoton final states, and work within the minimal model: we\nadd to the Standard Model field content a pseudoscalar and a vector-like\nfermion carrying both color and electric charge. This can stabilize the\nelectroweak vacuum without invoking new physics at very high energies, which\nwould give an unnaturally large contribution to the Higgs mass. We also show\nthat inflation can be obtained via a UV modification of General Relativity.\n", "  We present a possible interpretation of the recent diphoton excess reported\nby the $\\sqrt s=13$ TeV LHC data in quark seesaw left-right models with\nvectorlike fermions proposed to solve the strong $CP$ problem without the\naxion. The gauge singlet real scalar field responsible for the mass of the\nvectorlike fermions has the right production cross section and diphoton\nbranching ratio to be identifiable with the reported excess at around 750 GeV\ndiphoton invariant mass. Various ways to test this hypothesis as more data\naccumulates at the LHC are proposed.\n", "  Conventional ground-based astronomical observations suffer from image\ndistortion due to atmospheric turbulence. This can be minimized by choosing\nsuitable geographic locations or adaptive optical techniques, and avoided\naltogether by using orbital platforms outside the atmosphere. One of the\npromises of optical intensity interferometry is its independence from\natmospherically induced phase fluctuations. By performing narrowband spectral\nfiltering on sunlight and conducting temporal intensity interferometry using\nactively quenched avalanche photon detectors (APDs), the Solar $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$\nsignature was directly measured. We observe an averaged photon bunching signal\nof $g^{(2)}(\\tau) = 1.693 \\pm 0.003$ from the Sun, consistently throughout the\nday despite fluctuating weather conditions, cloud cover and elevation angle.\nThis demonstrates the robustness of the intensity interferometry technique\nagainst atmospheric turbulence and opto-mechanical instabilities, and the\nfeasibility to implement measurement schemes with both large baselines and long\nintegration times.\n", "  The quark-gluon plasma is studied via medium-induced changes to correlations\nbetween jets and charged particles in PbPb collisions compared to pp reference\ndata. This analysis uses data sets from PbPb and pp collisions with integrated\nluminosities of 166 inverse microbarns and 5.3 inverse picobarns, respectively,\ncollected at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV. The angular distributions of charged\nparticles are studied as a function of relative pseudorapidity (Delta eta) and\nrelative azimuthal angle (Delta phi) with respect to reconstructed jet\ndirections. Charged particles are correlated with all jets with transverse\nmomentum (pt) above 120 GeV, and with the leading and subleading jets (the\nhighest and second-highest in pt, respectively) in a selection of back-to-back\ndijet events. Modifications in PbPb data relative to pp reference data are\ncharacterized as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charged particle\npt. A centrality-dependent excess of low-pt particles is present for all jets\nstudied, and is most pronounced in the most central events. This excess of\nlow-pt particles follows a Gaussian-like distribution around the jet axis, and\nextends to large relative angles of Delta eta approximately 1 and Delta phi\napproximately 1.\n", "  The exact grand-canonical solution of a generalized interacting self-avoid\nwalk (ISAW) model, placed on a Husimi lattice built with squares, is presented.\nIn this model, beyond the traditional interaction $\\omega_1=e^{\\epsilon_1/k_B\nT}$ between (nonconsecutive) monomers on nearest-neighbor (NN) sites, an\nadditional energy $\\epsilon_2$ is associated to next-NN (NNN) monomers. Three\ndefinitions of NNN sites/interactions are considered, where each monomer can\nhave, effectively, at most 2, 4 or 6 NNN monomers on the Husimi lattice. The\nphase diagrams found in all cases have (qualitatively) the same thermodynamic\nproperties: a non-polymerized (NP) and a polymerized (P) phase separated by a\ncritical and a coexistence surface that meet at a tricritical ($\\theta$-) line.\nThis $\\theta$-line is found even when one of the interactions is repulsive,\nexisting for $\\omega_1$ in the range $[0,\\infty)$, i. e., for $\\epsilon_1/k_B\nT$ in the range $[-\\infty,\\infty)$. Counterintuitively, a $\\theta$-point exists\neven for an infinite repulsion between NN monomers ($\\omega_1=0$), being\nassociated to a coil-\"soft globule\" transition. In the limit of an infinite\nrepulsive force between NNN monomers, however, the coil-globule transition\ndisappears and only a NP-P continuous transition is observed. This particular\ncase, with $\\omega_2=0$, is also solved exactly on the square lattice, using a\ntransfer matrix calculation, where a discontinuous NP-P transition is found.\nFor attractive and repulsive forces between NN and NNN monomers, respectively,\nthe model becomes quite similar to the semiflexible-ISAW one, whose crystalline\nphase is not observed here, as a consequence of the frustration due to\ncompeting NN and NNN forces. The mapping of the phase diagrams in canonical\nones is discussed and compared with recent results from Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n", "  A detection technique for ultra-high energy cosmic rays, complementary to the\nfluorescence technique, would be the use of the molecular Bremsstrahlung\nradiation emitted by low-energy ionization electrons left after the passage of\nthe showers in the atmosphere. In this article, a detailed estimate of the\nspectral intensity of photons at ground level originating from this radiation\nis presented. The spectral intensity expected from the passage of the\nhigh-energy electrons of the cascade is also estimated. The absorption of the\nphotons in the plasma of electrons/neutral molecules is shown to be negligible.\nThe obtained spectral intensity is shown to be $2\\times10^{-21} $W cm$^{-2}$\nGHz$^{-1}$ at 10 km from the shower core for a vertical shower induced by a\nproton of $10^{17.5}$ eV. In addition, a recent measurement of Bremsstrahlung\nradiation in air at gigahertz frequencies from a beam of electrons produced at\n95 keV by an electron gun is also discussed and reasonably reproduced by the\nmodel.\n", "  With the usual definitions for the entropy and the temperature associated\nwith the apparent horizon, we discuss the first law of the thermodynamics on\nthe apparent in the general scalar-tensor theory of gravity with the kinetic\nterm of the scalar field non-minimally coupling to Einstein tensor. We show the\nequivalence between the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon and\nFriedmann equation for the general models, by using a mass-like function which\nis equal to the Misner-Sharp mass on the apparent horizon. The results further\nsupport the universal relationship between the first law of thermodynamics and\nFriedmann equation.\n", "  Magnetization dynamics in an artificial square spin-ice lattice made of\nNi80Fe20 with magnetic field applied in the lattice plane is investigated by\nbroadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The experimentally observed\ndispersion shows a rich spectrum of modes corresponding to different\nmagnetization states. These magnetization states are determined by exchange and\ndipolar interaction between individual islands, as is confirmed by a\nsemianalytical model. In the low field regime below 400 Oe a hysteretic\nbehavior in the mode spectrum is found. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that\nthe origin of the observed spectra is due to the initialization of different\nmagnetization states of individual nanomagnets. Our results indicate that it\nmight be possible to determine the spin-ice state by resonance experiments and\nare a first step towards the understanding of artificial geometrically\nfrustrated magnetic systems in the high-frequency regime.\n", "  A search is performed for $D^{(*)+}_{sJ}$ mesons in the reactions $pp \\to\nD^{*+} K^0_{\\rm S} X$ and $pp \\to D^{*0} K^+ X$ using data collected at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with the LHCb detector. For the $D^{*+}\nK^0_{\\rm S}$ final state, the decays $D^{*+} \\to D^0 \\pi^+$ with $D^0 \\to K^-\n\\pi^+$ and $D^0 \\to K^- \\pi^+ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ are used. For $D^{*0} K^+$, the\ndecay $D^{*0} \\to D^0 \\pi^0$ with $D^0 \\to K^- \\pi^+$ is used. A prominent\n$D_{s1}(2536)^+$ signal is observed in both $D^{*+} K^0_{\\rm S}$ and $D^{*0}\nK^+$ final states. The resonances $D^*_{s1}(2700)^+$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)^+$ are\nalso observed, yielding information on their properties, including spin-parity\nassignments. The decay $D^*_{s2}(2573)^+ \\to D^{*+} K^0_{\\rm S}$ is observed\nfor the first time, at a significance of 6.9 $\\sigma$, and its branching\nfraction relative to the $D^*_{s2}(2573)^+ \\to D^+ K^0_{\\rm S}$ decay mode is\nmeasured.\n", "  Statistically stationary and homogeneous shear turbulence (SS-HST) is\ninvestigated by means of a new direct numerical simulation code, spectral in\nthe two horizontal directions and compact-finite-differences in the direction\nof the shear. No remeshing is used to impose the shear-periodic boundary\ncondition. The influence of the geometry of the computational box is explored.\nSince HST has no characteristic outer length scale and tends to fill the\ncomputational domain, long-term simulations of HST are `minimal' in the sense\nof containing on average only a few large-scale structures. It is found that\nthe main limit is the spanwise box width, $L_z$, which sets the length and\nvelocity scales of the turbulence, and that the two other box dimensions should\nbe sufficiently large $(L_x\\gtrsim 2L_z$, $L_y \\gtrsim L_z$) to prevent other\ndirections to be constrained as well. It is also found that very long boxes,\n$L_x \\gtrsim 2 L_y$, couple with the passing period of the shear-periodic\nboundary condition, and develop strong unphysical linearized bursts. Within\nthose limits, the flow shows interesting similarities and differences with\nother shear flows, and in particular with the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded\nturbulence. They are explored in some detail. They include a self-sustaining\nprocess for large-scale streaks and quasi-periodic bursting. The bursting time\nscale is approximately universal, $\\sim 20 S^{-1}$, and the availability of two\ndifferent bursting systems allows the growth of the bursts to be related with\nsome confidence to the shearing of initially isotropic turbulence. It is\nconcluded that SS-HST, conducted within the proper computational parameters, is\na very promising system to study shear turbulence in general.\n", "  The trapping mechanisms for hydrogen isotopes in Al-X Cu (0.0 at.% < X < 3.5\nat.%) alloys were investigated using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS),\nelectrical conductivity, and differential scanning calorimetry. Constant\nheating rate TDS was used to determine microstructural trap energies and\noccupancies. In addition to the trapping states in pure Al reported in the\nliterature (interstitial lattice sites, dislocations, and vacancies), a trap\nsite due to Al-Cu intermetallic precipitates is observed. The binding energy of\nthis precipitate trap is ($18\\pm3$) kJ$\\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ ($0.19 \\pm 0.03$ eV).\nTypical occupancy of this trap is high; for Al-2.6 at.% Cu (a Cu composition\ncomparable to that in AA2219) charged at 200{\\deg}C with 130 MPa D$_2$ for 68\ndays, there is ca. there is $3.15\\times10^{-7}$ mol D bound to the precipitate\ntrap per mol of Al, accounting for a third of the D in the charged sample.\n", "  We report the first evidence of temporal variability in the interstellar Na I\nabsorption toward HD 47240, which lies behind the Monoceros Loop supernova\nremnant (SNR). Analysis of multi-epoch Kitt Peak coud\\'{e} feed spectra from\nthis sightline taken over an eight-year period reveals significant variation in\nboth the observed column density and the central velocities of the\nhigh-velocity gas components in these spectra. Given the $\\sim$1.3 mas\nyr$^{-1}$ proper motion of HD 47240 and a SNR distance of 1.6 kpc, this\nvariation would imply $\\sim$10 AU fluctuations within the SNR shell. Similar\nvariations have been previously reported in the Vela supernova remnant,\nsuggesting a connection between the expanding supernova remnant gas and the\nobserved variations. We speculate on the potential nature of the observed\nvariations toward HD 47240 in the context of the expanding remnant gas\ninteracting with the ambient ISM.\n", "  The angle $\\psi$ between a planet's orbital axis and the spin axis of its\nparent star is an important diagnostic of planet formation, migration, and\ntidal evolution. We seek empirical constraints on $\\psi$ by measuring the\nstellar inclination $i_{\\rm s}$ via asteroseismology for an ensemble of 25\nsolar-type hosts observed with NASA's Kepler satellite. Our results for $i_{\\rm\ns}$ are consistent with alignment at the 2-$\\sigma$ level for all stars in the\nsample, meaning that the system surrounding the red-giant star Kepler-56\nremains as the only unambiguous misaligned multiple-planet system detected to\ndate. The availability of a measurement of the projected spin-orbit angle\n$\\lambda$ for two of the systems allows us to estimate $\\psi$. We find that the\norbit of the hot-Jupiter HAT-P-7b is likely to be retrograde\n($\\psi=116.4^{+30.2}_{-14.7}\\:{\\rm deg}$), whereas that of Kepler-25c seems to\nbe well aligned with the stellar spin axis ($\\psi=12.6^{+6.7}_{-11.0}\\:{\\rm\ndeg}$). While the latter result is in apparent contradiction with a statement\nmade previously in the literature that the multi-transiting system Kepler-25 is\nmisaligned, we show that the results are consistent, given the large associated\nuncertainties. Finally, we perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis based on\nthe asteroseismic sample in order to recover the underlying distribution of\n$\\psi$. The ensemble analysis suggests that the directions of the stellar spin\nand planetary orbital axes are correlated, as conveyed by a tendency of the\nhost stars to display large inclination values.\n", "  Information is a precise concept that can be defined mathematically, but its\nrelationship to what we call \"knowledge\" is not always made clear. Furthermore,\nthe concepts \"entropy\" and \"information\", while deeply related, are distinct\nand must be used with care, something that is not always achieved in the\nliterature. In this elementary introduction, the concepts of entropy and\ninformation are laid out one by one, explained intuitively, but defined\nrigorously. I argue that a proper understanding of information in terms of\nprediction is key to a number of disciplines beyond engineering, such as\nphysics and biology.\n", "  The discovery of the topological insulators has fueled a surge of interests\nin the topological phases in periodic systems. Topological insulators have bulk\nenergy gap and topologically protected gapless edge states. The edge states in\nelectronic systems have been detected by observing the transport properties the\nHgte quantum wells. The electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge\nstates have been predicted and observed in photonic crystals, coupled\nresonators and linear circuits. However, the edge state spectrums of the two\ndimensional insulators and their electromagnetic analogues haven't been\ndirectly measured and thus the gaplessness of the edge states hasn't been\nexperimentally confirmed. Here I show the classical strings are more convenient\nchoice to study the topological phases than the electromagnetic waves. I found\nthat classical strings with periodic densities can simulate a variety of\ntopological phases in condensed matter physics including two dimensional\ntopological insulators, three dimensional topological semimetals and weak\ntopological insulators. Because the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the\nstrings can be easily measured, not only the gapless edge state spectrum but\nalso the bulk topological invariant can now be directly observed. Further more\nI show the topological phase transitions can be simulated by the strings. My\nresults show the richness of topological phases of mechanical waves. I\nanticipate my work to be a starting point to study the topological properties\nof mechanical waves. Even richer topological phases other than those have been\nfound in electronics systems can be explored when we use more general\nmechanical waves e.g. waves in membranes with periodic densities. These phases\nmay provide guides to hunt novel topological properties in other branches of\nscience.\n", "  We argue that tetragonal CuO (T-CuO) has the potential to finally settle\nlong-standing modelling issues for cuprate physics. We compare the one-hole\nquasiparticle (qp) dispersion of T-CuO to that of cuprates, in the framework of\nthe strongly-correlated ($U_{dd}\\rightarrow \\infty$) limit of the three-band\nEmery model. Unlike in CuO$_2$, magnetic frustration in T-CuO breaks the $C_4$\nrotational symmetry and leads to strong deviations from the Zhang-Rice singlet\npicture in parts of the reciprocal space. Our results are consistent with\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data but in sharp contradiction to\nthose of a one-band model previously suggested for them. These differences\nidentify T-CuO as an ideal material to test a variety of scenarios proposed for\nexplaining cuprate phenomenology.\n", "  Thermodynamic geometry analysis of interesting Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,\n111302 (2015)] for charged AdS black holes, which is based on studying the\nRuppeiner invariant behavior is not correct and the authors made a mistake in\ncalculating this quantity. In the present Letter, we address the correct\nRuppeiner scalar curvature and reveal the correct possible microscopic\nproperties of 4-dimensional charged AdS black holes arise from it. Some of\nthese properties have not been discussed in pointed out Letter.\n", "  We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of non-conventional\nlasing from higher multi-exciton states of a few quantum dot-photonic crystal\nnanocavity. We show that the photon output is fed from saturable quantum\nemitters rather than a non-saturable background despite being rather\ninsensitive to the spectral position of the mode. Although the exciton\ntransitions of each quantum dot are detuned by up to $160$ cavity linewidths,\nwe observe that strong excitation populates a multitude of closely spaced\nmulti-exciton states, which partly overlap spectrally with the mode. The\nlimited number of emitters is confirmed by a complete saturation of the mode\nintensity at strong pumping, providing sufficient gain to reach stimulated\nemission, whilst being accompanied by a distinct lasing threshold. Detailed\nsecond-order photon-correlation measurements unambiguously identify the\ntransition to lasing for strong pumping and, most remarkably, reveal\nsuper-thermal photon bunching with $g^{(2)}(0)>2$ below lasing threshold. Based\non our microscopic theory, a pump-rate dependent $\\beta$-factor $\\beta(P)$ is\nneeded to describe the nanolaser and account for the interplay of multi-exciton\ntransitions in the few-emitter gain medium. Moreover, we theoretically predict\nthat the super-thermal bunching is related to dipole-anticorrelated\nmulti-exciton recombination channels via sub- and super-radiant coupling below\nand above lasing threshold, respectively. Our results provide new insights into\nthe microscopic light-matter-coupling of spatially separated emitters coupled\nto a common cavity mode and, thus, provides a complete understanding of\nstimulated emission in nanolasers with discrete emitters.\n", "  We study a two-dimensional binary mixture of patchy colloids in\nsedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium using Monte Carlo simulation and Wertheim's\ntheory. By tuning the buoyant masses of the colloids we can control the\ngravity-induced sequence of fluid stacks of differing density and percolation\nproperties. We find complex stacking sequences with up to four layers and\nreentrant network formation, consistently in simulations and theoretically\nusing only the bulk phase diagram as input. Our theory applies to general\npatchy colloidal mixtures and is relevant to understanding experiments under\ngravity.\n", "  Ideal systems like MHD and Euler flow may develop singularities in vorticity\n(w = curl v). Viscosity and resistivity provide dissipative regularizations of\nthe singularities. In this paper we propose a minimal, local, conservative,\nnonlinear, dispersive regularization of compressible flow and ideal MHD, in\nanalogy with the KdV regularization of the 1D kinematic wave equation. This\nwork extends and significantly generalizes earlier work on incompressible Euler\nand ideal MHD. It involves a micro-scale cutoff length lambda which is a\nfunction of density, unlike in the incompressible case. In MHD, it can be taken\nto be of order the electron collisionless skin depth c/omega_pe. Our\nregularization preserves the symmetries of the original systems, and with\nappropriate boundary conditions, leads to associated conservation laws. Energy\nand enstrophy are subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data in\ncontrast to the unregularized systems. A Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket\nformulation is developed and applied to generalize the constitutive relation to\nbound higher moments of vorticity. A `swirl' velocity field is identified, and\nshown to transport w/rho and B/rho, generalizing the Kelvin-Helmholtz and\nAlfven theorems. The steady regularized equations are used to model a rotating\nvortex, MHD pinch and a plane vortex sheet. The proposed regularization could\nfacilitate numerical simulations of fluid/MHD equations and provide a\nconsistent statistical mechanics of vortices/current filaments in 3D, without\nblowup of enstrophy. Implications for detailed analyses of fluid and plasma\ndynamic systems arising from our work are briefly discussed.\n", "  In recent decades, inorganic crystals have been widely used in dark matter\ndirect search experiments. To contribute to the understanding of the\ncapabilities of $CsI(Na)$ and $CaF_{2}(Eu)$ crystals, a mono-energetic neutron\nbeam is utilized to study the properties of nuclear recoils, which are expected\nto be similar to signals of dark matter direct detection. The quenching factor\nof nuclear recoils in $CsI(Na)$ and $CaF_{2}(Eu)$, as well as an improved\ndiscrimination factor between nuclear recoils and ${\\gamma}$ backgrounds in\n$CsI(Na)$, are reported.\n", "  Data from the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei\nAstrophysics (PAMELA) satellite experiment were used to measure the geomagnetic\ncutoff for high-energy (>80 MeV) protons during the 14 December 2006\ngeomagnetic storm. The variations of the cutoff latitude as a function of\nrigidity were studied on relatively short timescales, corresponding to\nspacecraft orbital periods (94 min). Estimated cutoff values were compared with\nthose obtained by means of a trajectory tracing approach based on a dynamical\nempirical modeling of the Earth's magnetosphere. We found significant\nvariations in the cutoff latitude, with a maximum suppression of about 7 deg at\nlowest rigidities during the main phase of the storm. The observed reduction in\nthe geomagnetic shielding and its temporal evolution were related to the\nchanges in the magnetospheric configuration, investigating the role of\ninterplanetary magnetic field, solar wind and geomagnetic parameters. PAMELA's\nresults represent the first direct measurement of geomagnetic cutoffs for\nprotons with kinetic energies in the sub-GeV and GeV region.\n", "  Kontsevich and Soibelman defined Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3d\nCalabi-Yau category equipped with a stability condition. Any cluster variety\ngives rise to a family of such categories. Their DT invariants are encapsulated\nin a single formal automorphism of the cluster variety, called the\nDT-transformation.\n  Let S be an oriented surface with punctures, and a finite number of special\npoints on the boundary considered modulo isotopy. It give rise to a moduli\nspace X(m, S), closely related to the moduli space of PGL(m)-local systems on\nS, which carries a canonical cluster Poisson variety structure. For each\npuncture of S, there is a birational Weyl group action on the space X(m, S). We\nprove that it is given by cluster Poisson transformations. We prove a similar\nresult for the involution * of the space X(m,S) provided by dualising a local\nsystem on S.\n  We calculate the DT-transformation of the moduli space X(m,S), with few\nexceptions. Namely, let C(m,S) be the transformation of the space X(m,S) given\nby the product of three commuting maps: the involution *, the product, over all\npunctures of S, of the longest element of the Weyl group action corresponding\nto the puncture, and the \"shift of the special points on the boundary by one\"\nmap. Using a characterisation of a class of DT-transformations due to Keller,\nwe prove that C(m,S) = DT.\n  We prove that, burring few exceptions, the Weyl group and the involution *\nact by cluster transformations of the dual moduli space A(m, S). So the formula\nC(m,S) = DT is valid for the space A(m,S).\n  Our main result, combined with the work of Gross, Hacking, Keel and\nKontsevich, deliver a canonical basis in the space of regular functions on the\ncluster variety X(m,S), and in the upper cluster algebra with principal\ncoefficients related to the pair (SL(m), S), with few exceptions.\n", "  In view of increased interest in object-oriented systems for describing\ncoordinate information, we present a description of the data model used by the\nStarlink AST library. AST provides a comprehensive range of facilities for\nattaching world co-ordinate systems to astronomical data, and for retrieving\nand interpreting that information in a variety of formats, including FITS-WCS.\nAST is a mature system that has been in use for more than 17 years, and may\nconsequently be useful as a means of informing development of similar systems\nin the future.\n", "  The diffusing-diffusivity mechanism proposed by Chubynsky and Slater [PRL\n113, 098302, 2014] predicts that, in environments where the diffusivity changes\ngradually, the displacement distribution becomes non-Gaussian, even though the\nmean-squared displacement (MSD) grows linearly with time. Here, we report\nsingle-particle tracking measurements of the diffusion of colloidal spheres\nnear a planar wall. Because the local effective diffusivity is known, we have\nbeen able to carry out the first direct test of this mechanism for diffusion in\ninhomogeneous media.\n", "  In this talk we summarize the top physics setup in the event generator\nWHIZARD with a main focus on lepton colliders. This includes full six-, eight-\nand ten-fermion processes, factorized processes and spin correlations. For\nlepton colliders, QCD NLO processes for top quark physics are available and\nwill be discussed. A special focus is on the top-quark pair threshold, where a\nspecial implementation combines a non-relativistic effective field theory\ncalculation augmented by a next-to-leading threshold logarithm resummation with\na continuum relativistic fixed-order QCD NLO simulation.\n", "  We report studies of low-field conductivity, sigma, of the orthorhombic TaS_3\nsamples as a function of strain, epsilon. In the Peierls state the\nsigma(epsilon) dependencies show hysteresis. A similar hysteresis loop is\nobserved for K_{0.3}MoO_3. For nano-sized TaS_3 samples the sigma(epsilon)\ncurves show step-like changes associated with the \"quantization\" of the wave\nvector, q, of the charge-density wave (CDW). The dependences clearly reveal the\nchange of the q-vector with strain. In contrast with the traditional concept, q\nis found to increase with sample expansion. This means that the stretch-induced\nanomalies cannot be explained by the transition of the CDW to fourfold\ncommensurability with the pristine lattice (lock-in transition). Alternatively,\nwe suppose, that at the critical stretch a CDW with larger amplitude and\nmodified q-vector forms. Further, the models describing metastable length\nstates and drop of the Young modulus on CDW depinning in terms of longitudinal\nCDW strain, require reconsideration. Presumably, transverse effects should be\ntaken into account.\n", "  We analyse a spin precession of slow neutrons in the Einstein-Cartan gravity\nwith torsion, chameleon and magnetic field. For the derivation of the\nHeisenberg equation of motion of the neutron spin we use the effective\nlow-energy potential, derived by Ivanov and Wellenzohn (Phys. Rev. D92, 125004\n(2015)) for slow neutrons, coupled to gravitational, chameleon and torsion\nfields to order 1/m, where m is the neutron mass. In addition to this\nlow-energy interactions we switch on the interaction of slow neutrons with a\nmagnetic field. We show that to linear order approximation with respect to\ngravitational, chameleon and torsion fields the Dirac Hamilton operator for\nfermions (neutrons), moving in spacetimes created by rotating coordinate\nsystems, contains the anti-Hermitian operators of torsion-fermion (neutron)\ninteractions, caused by torsion scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. Such\nanti-Hermitian operators violate CP and T invariance. One may assume that in\nthe rotating Universe and galaxies the obtained anti-Hermitian torsion-fermion\ninteractions might be an origin of i) violation of CP and T invariance in the\nUniverse and ii) of baryon asymmetry.\n", "  We show that without introducing additional fields or extra degrees of\nfreedom, a specific higher derivative extension of Einstein's gravity that has\nonly a massless spin-2 excitation in its perturbative spectrum, has an\ninflationary period, a quasi-de Sitter phase with enough number of e-foldings\nrequired to solve the horizon and related problems. The crucial ingredient in\nthe construction is the curvature dependence of the effective Newton's\nconstant.\n", "  In this paper we consider the 1D Schr\\\"odinger operator $H$ with periodic\npoint interactions. We show an $L^1-L^\\infty$ bound for the time evolution\noperator $e^{-itH}$ restricted to each energy band with decay order\n$O(t^{-1/3})$ as $t\\to \\infty$, which comes from some kind of resonant state.\nThe order $O(t^{-1/3})$ is optimal for our model. We also give an asymptotic\nbound for the coefficient in the high energy limit. For the proof, we give an\nasymptotic analysis for the band functions and the Bloch waves in the high\nenergy limit. Especially we give the asymptotics for the inflection points in\nthe graphs of band functions, which is crucial for the asymptotics of the\ncoefficient in our estimate.\n", "  The behaviour of fermions in the background of a double-step potential is\nanalyzed with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous\nchiral-conjugation transformation. Provided the vector coupling does not exceed\nthe scalar coupling, a Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step\npotential shows that the transmission coefficient exhibits oscillations and\nthat a finite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-state solutions might\nappear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. An\nisolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled first-order equations\nmight also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound\nsolutions disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the\nrealization of the so-called spin and pseudospin symmetries in a\nfour-dimensional space-time. Furthermore, we show that due to the additional\nmass acquired by the fermion from the scalar background the high localization\nof the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime does not violate the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle.\n", "  It is shown that analytically soluble bound states of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for a large class of systems relevant to atomic and molecular physics\ncan be obtained by means of the Laplace transform of the confluent\nhypergeometric equation. It is also shown that all closed-form eigenfunctions\nare expressed in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. The generalized\nMorse potential is used as an illustration.\n", "  The natural wind environment that volant insects encounter is unsteady and\nhighly complex, posing significant flight control and stability challenges.\nUnsteady airflows can range from structured chains of discrete vortices shed in\nthe wake of an object to fully developed chaotic turbulence. It is critical to\nunderstand the flight control strategies insects employ to safely navigate in\nnatural environments. We combined experiments on free flying bumblebees with\nhigh fidelity numerical simulations and lower order modeling to identify the\nsalient mechanics that mediate insect flight in unsteady winds. We trained\nbumblebees to fly upwind towards an artificial flower in a wind tunnel under\nsteady wind and in a von Karman street (23Hz) formed in the wake of a cylinder.\nThe bees displayed significantly higher movement in the unsteady vortex street\ncompared to steady winds. Correlation analysis revealed that at lower\nfrequencies, less than 10 Hz, in both steady and unsteady winds the bees\nmediated lateral movement with body roll, typical casting motion. At higher\nfrequencies in unsteady winds there was a negative correlation between body\nroll and lateral accelerations. Numerical simulations of a bumblebee in similar\nconditions permitted the separation of the passive and active components of the\nflight trajectories. Comparison between the free-flying and numerical bees\nrevealed a novel mechanism that enables bees to passively ride out high\nfrequency perturbations while performing active maneuvers and corrections at\nlower frequencies. The capacity of maintaining stability by combining passive\nand active modes at different timescales provides a viable means for volant\nanimals and machines to tackle the control challenges posed by complex\nairflows.\n", "  The assembly of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at $z \\gtrsim 6$\nis still a subject of intense debate. If black holes (BHs) grow at their\nEddington rate, they must start from $\\gtrsim 10^4 \\, M_\\odot$ seeds formed by\nthe direct collapse of gas. Here we explore the alternative scenario where\n$\\sim 100 \\, M_\\odot$ BH remnants of the first stars grow at super-Eddington\nrate via radiatively inefficient slim accretion disks. We use an improved\nversion of the cosmological, data-constrained semi-analytic model\nGAMETE/QSOdust, where we follow the evolution of nuclear BHs and gas cooling,\ndisk and bulge formation of their host galaxies. Adopting SDSS J1148+5251\n(J1148) at $z = 6.4$ as a prototype of luminous $z \\gtrsim 6$ quasars, we find\nthat $\\sim$ 80% of its SMBH mass is grown by super-Eddington accretion, which\ncan be sustained down to $z \\sim 10$ in dense, gas-rich environments. The\naverage BH mass at $z \\sim 20$ is $M_{\\rm BH} \\gtrsim 10^4 \\,M_\\odot$,\ncomparable to that of direct collapse BHs. At $z = 6.4$ the AGN-driven mass\noutflow rate is consistent with the observations and the BH-to-bulge mass ratio\nis compatible with the local scaling relation. However, the stellar mass in the\ncentral 2.5 kpc is closer to the value inferred from CO observations. Finally,\n$\\sim 20 %$ of J1148 progenitors at $z=7.1$ have BH luminosities and masses\ncomparable to ULAS J1120+0641, suggesting that this quasar may be one of the\nprogenitors of J1148.\n", "  Local modes caused by defects play a significant role in the thermal\ntransport properties of thermoelectrics. Of particular interest are\ncharge-neutral defects that suppress thermal conductivity, without\nsignificantly reducing electrical transport. Here we report a temperature\ndependent Raman study, that identifies such a mode in a standard thermoelectric\nmaterial, Bi2Te2Se. One of the modes observed, whose origin has been debated\nfor decades, was shown mostly likely to be an antisite defect induced local\nmode. The anomalous temperature independent broadening of the local mode is\nascribed to the random arrangement of Se atoms. The temperature renormalization\nof all modes are well explained by an anharmonic model-Klemens's model.\n", "  We introduce the thematic (open access) issue published in Comptes Rendus\nPhysique. This issue is focused on the so-called Fe-based superconductors that,\nsince the discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO by Hosono group in\n2008, have become one of the latest hot topics in the field of condensed\nmatter. The idea is to give an up-to-date overview of the fundamental\nproperties of this novel family of high-Tc superconductors. First we briefly\nrecall the scientific context of superconductivity and its relationship to\nmagnetism in metallic compounds, and then we detail the specific aspects of\nFe-based superconductors addressed in the issue.\n", "  Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are fascinating micro-organisms which possess\nembodied biomineralized nanomagnets providing them the ability to orient with\nthe Earth's magnetic field. This property is presumably related to an\nevolutionary advantage in finding the oxic-anoxic interface along the up and\ndown direction in aquatic environments. So far the magnetic field response by\nMTB, called magnetotaxis, has been well described by a paramagnetic model where\nbacteria orient passively along the field lines according to a purely physical\nmechanism where magnetic torque and orientational Brownian noise compete. Here\nwe demonstrate using Magnetococcus marinus strain MC-1 as MTB model that\nmagnetotaxis shows more complex behaviors, which are affected by environmental\nconditions of different types. Indeed while MC-1 swimmers are found to\nessentially obey the paramagnetic paradigm when swimming in their growth\nmedium, they exhibit a run-and-tumble dynamics in a medium devoid of energy\nsource. Tumbling events are found to provide isotropic reorientation\ncapabilities causing the cells to escape from their prescribed field direction.\nThis behavior has a major influence on the capabilities of the cells to explore\ntheir environment across field lines and represents an alternative search\nstrategy to the back-and-forth motion along field-imposed tracks. Moreover, we\nshow that aside chemical conditions, steric/geometrical constraints are also\nable to trigger tumbling events through obstacle encountering. Overall,\nphysico-chemical environmental conditions appear to be important parameters\ninvolved in the swimming properties of MTB. Depending on environmental\nconditions, the run-and-tumble mobility may provide advantages in the search\nfor nutrient or ecological niche, in complement to classical magnetotaxis.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nrecently identified as a new class of $\\gamma$-ray sources. The high energy\nemission is explained by the presence of a relativistic jet observed at small\nangles, just like in the case of blazars. When the latter are observed at\nlarger angles they appear as radio-galaxies, but an analogue parent population\nfor beamed NLS1s has not yet been determined. In this work we analyze this\nproblem by studying the physical properties of three different samples of\nparent sources candidates: steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s, radio-quiet NLS1s,\nand disk-hosted radio-galaxies, along with compact steep-spectrum sources. In\nour approach, we first derived black hole mass and Eddington ratio from the\noptical spectra, then we investigated the interaction between the jet and the\nnarrow-line region from the [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 lines. Finally,\nthe radio luminosity function allowed us to compare their jet luminosity and\nhence determine the relations between the samples.\n", "  We show that a continuously nonuniform coupled line C-section phaser, as the\nlimiting case of the step discontinuous coupled-line multisection commensurate\nand non-commensurate phasers, provides enhanced bandwidth and diversity in\nreal-time analog signal processing (R-ASP). The phenomenology of the component\nis explained in comparison with the step-discontinuous using\nmultiple-reflection theory and a simple synthesis procedure is provided. The\nbandwidth enhancement results from the suppression of spurious group delay\nharmonics or quasi-harmonics, while the diversity enhancement results from the\ngreater level of freedom provided by the continuous nature of the nonuniform\nprofile of the phaser. These statements are supported by theoretical and\nexperimental results.\n", "  Recently, ZrTe5 and HfTe5 are theoretically studied to be the most promising\nlayered topological insulators since they are both interlayer weakly bonded\nmaterials and also with a large bulk gap in the single layer. It paves a new\nway for the study of novel topological quantum phenomenon tuned via external\nparameters. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity and properties\nevolution in HfTe5 single crystal induced via pressures. Our experiments\nindicated that anomaly resistance peak moves to low temperature first before\nreverses to high temperature followed by disappearance which is opposite to the\nlow pressure effect on ZrTe5. HfTe5 became superconductive above ~5.5 GPa up to\nat least 35 GPa in the measured range. The highest superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tc) around 5 K was achieved at 20 GPa. High pressure Raman\nrevealed that new modes appeared around pressure where superconductivity\noccurs. Crystal structure studies shown that the superconductivity is related\nto the phase transition from Cmcm structure to monoclinic C2/m structure. The\nsecond phase transition from C2/m to P-1 structure occurs at 12 GPa. The\ncombination of transport, structure measurement and theoretical calculations\nenable a completely phase diagram of HfTe5 at high pressures.\n", "  The description of hydrodynamic interactions between a particle and the\nsurrounding liquid, down to the nanometer scale, is of primary importance since\nconfined liquids are ubiquitous in many natural and technological situations.\nIn this paper, we combine three non-conventional atomic force microscopes to\nstudy hydrodynamics around micro- and nano-cylinders. These complementary\nmethods allow the independent measurement of the added mass and friction terms\nover a large range of probe sizes, fluid viscosities and solicitation\nconditions. A theoretical model based on an analytical description of the\nvelocity field around the probe shows that the friction force depends on a\nunique parameter, the ratio of the probe radius to the thickness of the viscous\nboundary layer. We demonstrate that the whole range of experimental data can be\ngathered in a master curve which is well reproduced by the model. This\nvalidates the use of these AFM modes for a quantitative study of\nnano-hydrodynamics, and opens the way to the investigation of other sources of\ndissipation in simple and complex fluids down to the nanometer scale.\n", "  Terrain effects on thunderstorms, which are conducive to tornado formation,\nare investigated.\n", "  A method is proposed for the inclusion of electron correlation in the\ncalculation of the temperature dependence of band structures arising from\nelectron-phonon coupling. It relies on an efficient exploration of the\nvibrational phase space along the recently introduced thermal lines. Using the\n$G_0W_0$ approximation, the temperature dependence of the direct gaps of\ndiamond, silicon, lithium fluoride, magnesium oxide, and titanium dioxide is\ncalculated. Within the proposed formalism, a single calculation at each\ntemperature of interest is sufficient to obtain results of the same accuracy as\nin alternative, more expensive methods. It is shown that many-body\ncontributions beyond semi-local density functional theory modify the\nelectron-phonon coupling strength by almost $50$% in diamond, silicon, and\ntitanium dioxide, but by less than $5$% in lithium flouride and magnesium\noxide. The results reveal a complex picture regarding the validity of\nsemi-local functionals for the description of electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  Photon modes have an important role in characterizing the quantum sources of\nlight. Proper coupling of various photon modes obtained in spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC) process in optical fibers is essential to\ngenerate an effective source of entangled photons. The two main pre-detection\nfactors affecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing\nparameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental\nresults on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon\nmodes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton coupling\nefficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We\nattribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of\ndown-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the\nellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam.\nWe also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry\nwith the pump focusing parameter. These results may be useful in selecting\noptimum conditions in the down-conversion process for generating efficient\nsources of entangled photons for quantum information applications.\n", "  The effect of elongated bell-shaped mountain orientation on supercell\nthunderstorms is numerically investigated using the Bryan Cloud Model 1 (CM1).\nThe orography is varied by three mountain heights and is varied in four\ndifferent positions, effectively producing 12 different terrain configurations.\nIt is found that the different orientations produce variations in the supercell\nlife cycle with shorter cycles for higher inflow rates. Furthermore, these\ncycles are associated with the storm reaching its minimum intensity just after\na peak rain period. Moreover, the effect of stronger inflow was seen before\ndirect storm-terrain interactions started. The higher inflow also played a\nsignificant role in increasing rainfall rate and areal extent, to the point\nthat further convection, associated with the cold pool, was triggered adding to\nrainfall amount. Using a stricter form of the National Weather Service Tornado\nDetection Algorithm to investigate the tornadic nature of simulated supercells;\nit is found that terrain blocking effects are dominative and that elongating\nthe terrain axis approximately parallel to the propagation vector produced the\nstrongest potential to generate a tornadic supercell thunderstorm. Although the\nsimulated case with the highest mountain produced the most tornadic\nthunderstorms it is seen that increasing the terrain height alone is not\nsufficient to make tornadogenesis more probable as more tornadic supercells\nwere simulated with lower heights compared to moderate terrain heights.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration astronomical radio pulses of\nunknown physical origin that appear to come from extragalactic distances.\nPrevious follow-up observations have failed to find additional bursts at the\nsame dispersion measures (i.e. integrated column density of free electrons\nbetween source and telescope) and sky position as the original detections. The\napparent non-repeating nature of the fast radio bursts has led several authors\nto hypothesise that they originate in cataclysmic astrophysical events. Here we\nreport the detection of ten additional bursts from the direction of FRB121102,\nusing the 305-m Arecibo telescope. These new bursts have dispersion measures\nand sky positions consistent with the original burst. This unambiguously\nidentifies FRB121102 as repeating and demonstrates that its source survives the\nenergetic events that cause the bursts. Additionally, the bursts from FRB121102\nshow a wide range of spectral shapes that appear to be predominantly intrinsic\nto the source and which vary on timescales of minutes or shorter. While there\nmay be multiple physical origins for the population of fast radio bursts, the\nrepeat bursts with high dispersion measure and variable spectra specifically\nseen from FRB121102 support models that propose an origin in a young, highly\nmagnetised, extragalactic neutron star.\n", "  Three-dimensional imaging of biological cells is crucial for the\ninvestigation of cell biology, provide valuable information to reveal the\nmechanisms behind pathophysiology of cells and tissues. Recent advances in\noptical diffraction tomography (ODT) have demonstrated the potential for the\nstudy of various cells with its unique advantages of quantitative and\nlabel-free imaging capability. To provide insight on this rapidly growing field\nof research and to discuss its applications in biology and medicine, we present\nthe summary of the ODT principle and highlight recent studies utilizing ODT\nwith the emphasis on the applications to the pathophysiology of cells.\n", "  Optical design and fabrication techniques are crucial for making optical\nelements. From conventional lenses to diffractive optical elements, and to\nrecent metasurfaces, various types of optical elements have been proposed to\nmanipulate light where optical materials are fabricated into desired\nstructures. Here, we propose a scattering optical element (SOE) which exploits\nmultiple light scattering and wavefront shaping. Instead of fabricating optical\nmaterials, the SOE consists of a disordered medium and a photopolymer-based\nwavefront recorder, with shapes the wavefront of impinging light on demand.\nWith the proposed stand-alone SOEs, we experimentally demonstrate control of\nvarious properties of light, including intensity, polarisation, spectral\nfrequency and near field. Due to the tremendous freedom brought about by\ndisordered media, the proposed approach will provide unexplored routes to\nmanipulate arbitrary optical fields in stand-alone optical elements.\n", "  Trajectory tracking of nonlinear dynamical systems with affine open-loop\ncontrols is investigated. The control task is to enforce the system state to\nfollow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible. We introduce\nexactly realizable desired trajectories as these trajectories which can be\ntracked exactly by an appropriate control. Exactly realizable trajectories are\ncharacterized mathematically by means of Moore-Penrose projectors constructed\nfrom the input matrix. The approach leads to differential-algebraic systems of\nequations and is considerably simpler than the related concept of system\ninversion. Furthermore, we identify a particularly simple class of nonlinear\naffine control systems. Systems in this class satisfy the so-called linearizing\nassumption and share many properties with linear control systems. For example,\nconditions for controllability can be formulated in terms of a rank condition\nfor a controllability matrix analogously to the Kalman rank condition for\nlinear time-invariant systems.\n", "  We prove the incompatibility of certain desirable properties of community\npartition quality functions. Our results generalize the impossibility result of\n[Kleinberg 2003] by considering sets of weaker properties. In particular, we\nuse an alternative notion to solve the central issue of the consistency\nproperty. (The latter means that modifying the graph in a way consistent with a\npartition should not have counterintuitive effects). Our results clearly show\nthat community partition methods should not be expected to perfectly satisfy\nall ideally desired properties.\n  We then proceed to show that this incompatibility no longer holds when\nslightly relaxed versions of the properties are considered, and we provide in\nfact examples of simple quality functions satisfying these relaxed properties.\nAn experimental study of these quality functions shows a behavior comparable to\nestablished methods in some situations, but more debatable results in others.\nThis suggests that defining a notion of good partition in communities probably\nrequires imposing additional properties.\n", "  Recently Guduru and coworkers have demonstrated with neat theory and\nexperiments that both increase of strength and of toughness are possible in the\ncontact of a rigid sphere with concentric single scale of waviness, against a\nvery soft material. The present note tries to answer the question of a\nmultiscale enhancement of adhesion, considering a Weierstrass series to\nrepresent the multiscale roughness, and analytical results only are used. It is\nconcluded that the enhancement is bounded for low fractal dimensions but it can\nhappen, and possibly to very high values, whereas it is even unbounded for high\nfractal dimensions, but it is also much less likely to occur, because of\nseparated contacts.\n", "  This is a Reply to a Comment on my paper: New formulas for the (-2) moment of\nthe photo-absorption cross section, sigma-2.\n", "  FTIR spectra of monohydric alcohols 1-nonanol (C9H19OH) and 1-decanol\n(C10H21OH) were registered in the spectral region from 500 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 at\ntemperatures from -50 to + 25 {\\deg}C for 1-nonanol and +100 {\\deg}C for\n1-decanol. Temperature-induced spectra changes were compared for these two\nalcohols. The authors link the observed changes with the transformations of\ncluster structure occurring during phase transitions.\n", "  First-principles calculations are made for the primary pyroelectric\ncoefficients of wurtzite GaN and ZnO. The pyroelectricity is attributed to the\nquasiharmonic thermal shifts of internal strains (internal displacements of\ncations and anions carrying their Born effective charges). The primary\n(zero-external-strain) pyroelectricity dominates at low temperatures, while the\nsecondary pyroelectricity (the correction from external thermal strains)\nbecomes comparable with the primary pyroelectricity at high temperatures.\nContributions from the acoustic and the optical phonon modes to the primary\npyroelectric coefficient are only moderately well described by the\ncorresponding Debye function and Einstein function respectively.\n", "  Lack of knowledge about the detailed many-particle motion on the microscopic\nscale is a key issue in any theoretical description of a macroscopic\nexperiment. For systems at or close to thermal equilibrium, statistical\nmechanics provides a very successful general framework to cope with this\nproblem. Far from equilibrium, only very few quantitative and comparably\nuniversal results are known. Here, a new quantum mechanical prediction of this\ntype is derived and verified against various experimental and numerical data\nfrom the literature. It quantitatively describes the entire temporal relaxation\ntowards thermal equilibrium for a large class (in a mathematically precisely\ndefined sense) of closed many-body systems, whose initial state may be\narbitrarily far from equilibrium.\n", "  The effect of rotation upon the classical two-layer Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability is considered theoretically and compared with previous experimental\nresults. In particular we consider a two-layer system with an axis of rotation\nthat is perpendicular to the interface between the layers. In general we find\nthat a wave mode's growth rate may be reduced by rotation. We further show that\nin some cases, unstable axisymmetric wave modes may be stabilized by rotating\nthe system above a critical rotation rate associated with the mode's\nwavelength, the Atwood number and the flow's aspect ratio. We compare our\ntheory with experiments conducted in a magnetic field using 'heavy' diamagnetic\nand 'light' paramagnetic fluids and present comparisons between the theoretical\npredictions and experimental observations.\n", "  Staphylococcus aureus is a coccal bacterium, which divides by binary fission.\nAfter division the cells remain attached giving rise to small clusters, with a\ncharacteristic 'bunch of grapes' morphology. S. aureus is an important human\npathogen and this, combined with the increasing prevalence of\nantibiotic-resistant strains, such as Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA),\nmake it an excellent subject for studies of new methods of antimicrobial\naction. Many antibiotics, such as penicillin, prevent S. aureus cell division\nand so an understanding of this fundamental process may pave the way to the\nidentification of novel drugs. We present here a novel image analysis framework\nfor automated detection and segmentation of cells in S. aureus clusters, and\nidentification of their cell division planes. We demonstrate the technique on\nGFP labelled EzrA, a protein that localises to a mid-cell plane during division\nand is involved in regulation of cell size and division. The algorithms may\nhave wider applicability in detecting morphologically complex structures of\nfluorescently-labelled proteins within cells in other cell clusters.\n", "  We present a quantitative label-free imaging of mouse whole brain tissue\nslices with sub-micrometre resolution, employing holographic microscopy and an\nautomated scanning platform. From the measured light field images, scattering\ncoefficients and anisotropies are quantitatively retrieved, which enables\naccess to structural information about brain tissues. As a proof of principle,\nwe demonstrate that these scattering parameters enable us to quantitatively\naddress structural alteration in the brain tissues of mice with Alzheimer's\ndisease.\n", "  In this paper, we constrain four time-dependent dark energy (TDDE) models by\nusing the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO),\nobservational Hubble parameter (OHD) data-sets as well as the single data point\nfrom the newest event GW150914. Subsequently, adopting the best fitting values\nof the model parameters, we apply the original statefinder, statefinder\nhierarchy, the growth rate of matter perturbations and $Om(z)$ diagnostics to\ndistinguish the TDDE scenarios and the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario from each other.\nWe discover that all the TDDE models and $\\Lambda$CDM model can be\ndistinguished better at the present epoch by using the statefinder hierarchy\nthan using the original statefinder, the growth rate of matter perturbations\nand $Om(z)$ diagnostics, especially, in the planes of\n$\\{S_3^{(1)},S_4^{(1)}\\}$, $\\{S_3^{(2)},S_4^{(2)}\\}$, $\\{S_5^{(1)},S_5^{(2)}\\}$\nand $\\{S_4^{(2)},S_5^{(2)}\\}$.\n", "  We studied narrow $^1$H NMR spectra of Mg(OH)$_2$ and Ca(OH)$_2$ powders at\n100$-$355 K and 42$-$59 MHz using pulsed NMR techniques. The Fourier\ntransformed NMR spectra of the proton free-induction signals show the\nsuperposition of broad and narrow components, which can be assigned to immobile\nprotons and extrinsic mobile protons, respectively. We found that a narrow\nspectrum develops on heating above about $T_c$ = 260 K and widens above a\nLarmor frequency of about $f_c$ = 50 MHz for Mg(OH)$_2$. The\ntemperature-induced NMR spectrum and the characteristic frequency $f_c$ of 50\nMHz are the noteworthy features of the nuclear spin fluctuation spectra of the\nextrinsic protons.\n", "  We investigate the invariant mass distributions of $B_s\\pi$ via different\nrescattering processes. Because the triangle singularity (TS) could be present\nfor a very broad incident energy region, it can be expected that the TS peaks\nmay simulate the resonance-like bump $X(5568)$ observed by the D0\ncollaboration. The highly process-dependent characteristic of TS mechanism\noffers a criterion to distinguish it from other dynamic mechanisms.\n", "  This is a report on our newly proposed model of dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking with some details of the analysis involved. The model in the simplest\nversion has only a chiral superfield (multiplet), with a strong four-superfield\ninteraction in the K\\\"ahler potential that induces a real two-superfield\ncomposite with vacuum condensate. The latter has supersymmetry breaking parts,\nwhich we show to bear nontrivial solution following basically a standard\nnonperturbative analysis for a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type model on a superfield\nsetting. The real composite superfield has a spin one component but is\notherwise quite unconventional. We discuss also the parallel analysis for the\neffective theory with the composite. Plausible vacuum solutions are illustrated\nand analyzed. The supersymmetry breaking solutions have generated soft mass(es)\nfor the scalar avoiding the vanishing supertrace condition for the\nsquared-masses of the superfield components. We also present some analysis of\nthe resulted low energy effective theory with components of the composite\nbecome dynamical. The determinant of the fermionic modes is shown to be zero\nillustrating the presence of the expected Goldstino. The model gives the\npossibility of constructing a supersymmetric standard model with all\n(super)symmetry breaking masses generated dynamically and directly without the\nnecessity of complicated hidden or mediating sectors.\n", "  With a recent rising interest of single photon superradiance due to its\npotential usefulness for efficient collection of single photon from an atomic\nensemble, bright and narrow photon pair source is a key component in\nrealization of quantum communication and quantum computer based on coherent\ninteraction between light and atomic ensemble. We report the superradiant\nemission of ultra-bright photon pairs with a coincidence counting rate per\ninput power of 64,600 cps/mW via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a thermal\nvapour cell. The photon-pair generation rate is enhanced by the contribution of\ntwo-photon coherence of almost atomic velocity groups in the Doppler-broadened\nladder-type atomic system. The quadratic proportionality of the probability of\ndetecting a heralded single photon as a function of the optical depth clarifies\nthat the ultra-brightness results from the superradiance. In addition, a single\nphoton superradiant beating at a high optical depth of the atomic ensemble is\nobserved for the first time.\n", "  The frequency domain equalizers (FDEs) employing two types of overlap-add\nzero-padding (OLA-ZP) methods are applied to compensate the chromatic\ndispersion in a 112-Gbit/s non-return-to-zero polarization division multiplexed\nquadrature phase shift keying (NRZ-PDM-QPSK) coherent optical transmission\nsystem. Simulation results demonstrate that the OLA-ZP methods can achieve the\nsame acceptable performance as the overlap-save method. The required minimum\noverlap (or zero-padding) in the FDE is derived, and the optimum fast Fourier\ntransform length to minimize the computational complexity is also analyzed.\n", "  In order to study a one-dimensional analogue of the spontaneous curvature\nmodel for two-component lipid bilayer membranes we consider planar curves that\nare made of a material with two phases. Each phase induces a preferred\ncurvature to the curve, and these curvatures as well as phase boundaries may\nlead to the development of kinks. We introduce a family of energies for smooth\ncurves and phase fields, and we show that these energies $\\Gamma$-converge to\nan energy for curves with a finite number of kinks. The theoretical result is\nillustrated by some numerical examples.\n", "  Thermoreversible hydrogels are commonly prepared by cooling down to ambient\ntemperature, aqueous polymer solutions first brought to a boil. The incubation\ntime of the polymer solution at such a high temperature is traditionally kept\nto a minimum to minimize its impact on the subsequent gelation. Here we study\nthe effect of a prolonged heating of a 1.5\\% w/w agar solution at\n$T=80^{\\circ}$C, well above the gelling temperature. The incubation time\n$\\mathcal{T}$ of the polysaccharide solution is varied from a few hours up to\nfive days. We show that the agar solution ages as the result of both the\nhydrolysis and the intramolecular oxidation of the polysaccharides. As a\nconsequence, both the viscosity and the pH of the solution decrease\ncontinuously during the incubation period. Furthermore, samples withdrew at\ndifferent incubation times are cooled down to form gels which structure and\nmechanical properties are systematically determined. Cryo-microscopy and X-ray\ndiffraction experiments reveal that agar gels formed from solutions of\nincreasing incubation times, display a coarser microstructure composed of\nmicron-sized foils which result from the condensation of the polysaccharides\nand contrast with the fibrous-like microstructure of gels prepared from a fresh\nagar solution. Along with structural changes, a prolonged incubation time of\nthe polymer solution at $T=80^{\\circ}$C leads to weaker agar gels of\nsignificantly lower shear elastic modulus. Moreover, extensive\nmacro-indentation experiments coupled to direct visualization show that\nincreasing the incubation time of the agar solution up to a few days decreases\nthe yield strain of the gel, while the rupture scenario turns continuously from\nbrittle to ductile-like. Our study suggests that the incubation time of agar\nsolutions at high temperature could be used to tune the mechanical properties\nof agar-based gels.\n", "  Epitaxy of semiconductors is a process of tremendous importance in applied\nscience and optoelectronic industry. Controlling of defects introduced during\nepitaxial growth is a key point in manufacturing devices of high efficiency and\ndurability. In this work, we demonstrate how useful hybrid reflections are on\nthe study of epitaxial structures with anisotropic strain gradients due to\npatterned substrates. High accuracy to detect and distinguish elastic and\nplastic relaxations are one of the greatest advantages of measuring this type\nof reflection, as well as the fact that it can be exploited in symmetrical\nreflection geometry on a commercial high-resolution diffractometer.\n", "  A new perspective on how to manipulate molecules by means of very strong\nlaser pulses is emerging with insights from the so-called light-induced\npotentials, which are the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of molecules\nseverely distorted by the effect of the strong field. Different effects appear\ndepending on how the laser frequency is tuned, to a certain electronic\ntransition, creating light-induced avoided crossings, or very off-resonant,\ngenerating Stark shifts. In the former case it is possible to induce dramatic\nchanges in the geometry and redistribution of charges in the molecule while the\nlasers are acting and to fully control photodissociation reactions as well as\nother photochemical processes. Several theoretical proposals taken from the\nwork of the authors are reviewed and analyzed showing the unique features that\nthe strong-laser chemistry opens to control the transient properties and the\ndynamics of molecules.\n", "  As we age, our hearts undergo changes which result in reduction in complexity\nof physiological interactions between different control mechanisms. This\nresults in a potential risk of cardiovascular diseases which are the number one\ncause of death globally. Since cardiac signals are nonstationary and nonlinear\nin nature, complexity measures are better suited to handle such data. In this\nstudy, non-invasive methods for detection of cardiac aging using complexity\nmeasures are explored. Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, Approximate Entropy (ApEn)\nand Effort-to-Compress (ETC) measures are used to differentiate between healthy\nyoung and old subjects using heartbeat interval data. We show that both LZ and\nETC complexity measures are able to differentiate between young and old\nsubjects with only 10 data samples while ApEn requires at least 15 data\nsamples.\n", "  We present the results of an optical photometry and high-resolution\nspectroscopy campaign for a modest sample of X-ray selected stars in the\nChamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus star forming regions. With R~50000 optical\nspectra, we establish kinematic membership of the parent association and\nconfirm stellar youth for each star in our sample. With the acquisition of new\nstandardized BVIc photometry, in concert with near-infrared data from the\nliterature, we derive age and mass from stellar positions in model-dependent\nHertzsprung-Russell diagrams. We compare isochronal ages derived using\ncolour-dependent extinction values finding that, within error bars, ages are\nthe same irrespective of whether E(B-V), E(V-Ic), E(J-H) or E(H-K) is used to\nestablish extinction, although model ages tend to be marginally younger for\nredder Ecolour values. For Cham I and Eta Cham members we derive ages of ~< 5-6\nMyr, whereas our three Eta Cha candidates are more consistent with a ~> 25 Myr\npost-T Tauri star population. In Rho Ophiuchus, most stars in our sample have\nisochronal ages <10 Myr. Five objects show evidence of strong infrared excess\n(Av>5) in the 2MASS colour colour diagram, however in terms of Halpha emission,\nall stars except RXJ1625.6-2613 are consistent with being weak-lined T-Tauri\nstars. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range ~ 4000A < wavelength\n< 1000 microns, show that only one Chamaeleon star (RXJ1112.7-7637) and three\nRho Ophiuchus stars (ROXR1 13, RXJ1625.6-2613 & RXJ1627.1-2419) reveal\nsubstantial departures from a bare photosphere.\n", "  The aim of this short note is to clarify some of the claims made in the\ncomparison made in [S. Lloyd, On the uncomputability of the spectral gap,\narXiv:1602.05924] between our recent result [T.S. Cubitt, D. Perez-Garcia, M.M.\nWolf, Undecidability of the spectral gap, Nature 528, 207-211 (2015),\narXiv:1502.04573] and his 1994 paper [S.

In the paper a transformation of the generalized coordinate of GF,\nthat is based on continuity equation and minimal action principle, is proposed.\nA potential vector is introduced that is similar to fixing of Hamilton gauge of\nthe electromagnetic field. This transformation gives possibility of the\ncalculation a Hamilton function, removes mathematical troubles of the Jeans\ntheory (Jeans swindle) and allows to construct kinetic theory of GF using\nstatistical mechanics methods.\n", "  A recent processing effort has been undertaken in order to extend the\nrange-of-coverage of the GONG merged dopplergrams. The GONG-Classic-era\nobservations have now been merged to provide, albeit at lower resolution, mrvzi\ndata as far back as May of 1995. The contents of this document provide an\noverview of what these data look like, the processing steps used to generate\nthem from the original site observations, and the outcomes of a few initial\nquality-assurance tests designed to validate the final merged images. Based on\nthese tests, the GONG project is releasing this data product to the user\ncommunity (http://nisp.nso.edu/data).\n", "  We describe the collective behavior of a system of many inelastic spherical\nparticles inside a box which is being periodically vibrated. The box is\nshallow, with large horizontal dimensions, while the height is less than two\nparticle diameters. The vibrations are not symmetric: the time the box is\nmoving up is, in general, different to the time it is moving down. The limit\ncycles of isolated grains are largely affected by the asymmetry of the\nvibration mode, increasing the size in phase space of the chaotic regions. When\nmany grains are placed in the box, the phase separation between dense,\nsolid-like regions, coexisting with fluid-like regions takes place at smaller\nglobal densities for asymmetric vibration profiles. Besides, the order\nparameter of the transition takes larger values when asymmetric forcing is\nused.\n", "  This is the first publication in which an ill-posed Cauchy problem for a\nquasi- linear PDE is solved numerically by a rigorous method. More precisely,\nwe solve the side Cauchy problem for a 1-d quasilinear parabolc equation. The\nkey idea is to minimize a strictly convex cost functional with the Carleman\nWeight Function in it. Previous publications about numerical solutions of\nill-posed Cauchy problems were considering only linear equations.\n", "  Using non-excessively-technical language and written in informal style, this\narticle introduces the reader to the concepts of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves and recounts the prediction of existence of these waves by\nMaxwell and Einstein, respectively. The issue of gravitational radiation is\ntimely in view of the recent announcement of the detection of gravitational\nwaves by the LIGO scientific team.\n", "  One the major factors determining the development and evolution of\natmospheric convection is the sea surface temperature and its variability.\nResults of this thesis show that state of atmospheric convection impacts the\ndiurnal distribution of thermal energy in the upper ocean. Under calm and clear\nsky conditions a shallow warm layer of several meters depth develops on the\nsurface of the ocean. This warm layer drives an anomalous flux from the ocean\nto the atmosphere. A novel Kelvin wave trajectory database based on satellite\ndata is introduced in this study. The investigation of its data shows that\nsubstantial fraction of Kelvin waves is initiated as a result of interaction\nwith another Kelvin wave. Two distinct categories are defined and analyzed: the\ntwo- and multiple Kelvin wave initiations, and a spin off initiation. Results\nshow that primary forcing of such waves are high diurnal cycle and/or increased\nwind speed and latent heat flux at the ocean surface. Variability of the ocean\nsurface and subsurface along Kelvin wave trajectories over Indian Ocean is\ninvestigated: wind speed and latent heat flux increase and a sea surface\ntemperature anomaly decreases during a wave passage. It is also shown that\nKelvin waves are longitude-diurnal cycle phase locked over the Maritime\nContinent. This cycle phase locking is such that it agrees with mean, local\ndiurnal cycle of convection in the atmosphere. The strength of the\nlongitude-diurnal cycle phase locking differs between non-blocked Kelvin waves,\nwhich make successful transition over the Maritime Continent, and blocked waves\nthat terminate within it. The distance between the islands of Sumatra and\nBorneo agrees with the distance travelled by an average Kelvin wave in one day.\nThis suggests that the Maritime Continent may act as a filter, favoring\nsuccessful propagation waves, which are in phase with the local diurnal cycle\nof convection.\n", "  Multi-photon entangled states such as `N00N states' have attracted a lot of\nattention because of their possible application in high-precision phase\nmeasurements. So far, N00N states have been generated by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion sources and by mixing quantum and classical light on a beam\nsplitter. However, single-photon on demand sources promise to be more efficient\nand scalable than down-conversion sources which are probabilistic in nature.\nHere, we demonstrate super-resolving phase measurements based on two-photon\nN00N states generated by a quantum dot single-photon source utilizing the\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect on a beam splitter. The quantum dot was excited through a\ntwo-photon resonant excitation scheme. Using a $\\pi$-pulse, this results in the\ndeterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons from both, the\nbiexciton and exciton radiative recombination processes. Launching either type\nof the photons into both inputs of an interferometer, phase super-resolution,\ni.e. an interference fringe spacing with doubled rate relative to the single\nphoton rate has been observed for both transitions. Interference visibilities\nof $V_{N=2,\\mathit{XX}}=0.54\\pm0.01$ for the biexciton and\n$V_{N=2,\\mathit{X}}=0.46\\pm0.02$ for the exciton transition have been obtained,\nrespectively.\n", "  Transistors, regardless of their size, rely on electrical gates to control\nthe conductance between source and drain contacts. In atomic-scale transistors,\nthis conductance is exquisitely sensitive to single electrons hopping via\nindividual orbitals. Single-electron transport in molecular transistors has\nbeen previously studied using top-down approaches to gating, such as\nlithography and break junctions. But atomically precise control of the gate -\nwhich is crucial to transistor action at the smallest size scales - is not\npossible with these approaches. Here, we used individual charged atoms,\nmanipulated by a scanning tunnelling microscope, to create the electrical gates\nfor a single-molecule transistor. This degree of control allowed us to tune the\nmolecule into the regime of sequential single-electron tunnelling, albeit with\na conductance gap more than one order of magnitude larger than observed\npreviously. This unexpected behaviour arises from the existence of two\ndifferent orientational conformations of the molecule, depending on its charge\nstate. Our results show that strong coupling between these charge and\nconformational degrees of freedom leads to new behaviour beyond the established\npicture of single-electron transport in atomic-scale transistors.\n", "  The hadronic energy resolution required for an hadronic operating at lepton\ncollider is at the limits or even exceeds that obtained with traditional\ntechniques. Furthermore, it is a well established fact that the presence of an\nelectromagnetic section in front of an hadron calorimeter, as occurs in the\nlayouts of the majority of detectors operating at a collider, would deteriorate\nthe hadronic energy resolution of the device. The novel $ADRIANO$ technology\n(\\textit{A Dual-readout Integrally Active Non-segmented Option}), currently\nunder development at Fermilab, overcomes the above limitations by complementing\nan integrally active calorimeter with the dual-readout technique. Detailed\nMonte Carlo studies indicate that the energy resolution is in the\n$25\\%/\\sqrt{E}$ - $38\\%/\\sqrt{E}$ interval with a linear response of the\ndetector up to an energy of 200 GeV. A baseline configuration is chosen with an\nestimated energy resolution of $\\sigma(E)/E\\approx30\\%/\\sqrt{E}$. Several\nprototypes have been built by \\textit{T1015} Collaboration at Fermilab, to\nexplore the effect of modifications of the layout from the baseline\nconfiguration. Preliminary results from several test beams at the\n\\textit{Fermilab Test Beam Facility} (FTBF) of $\\sim1\\lambda_{I}$ prototypes\nare presented. Future prospects with ultra-heavy glass are, also, summarized.\n", "  Vaccination and outbreak monitoring are essential tools for preventing and\nminimizing outbreaks of infectious diseases. Targeted strategies, where the\nindividuals most important for monitoring or preventing outbreaks are selected\nfor intervention, offer a possibility to significantly improve these measures.\nAlthough targeted strategies carry a strong potential, identifying optimal\ntarget groups remains a challenge. Here we consider the problem of identifying\ntarget groups based on digital communication networks (telecommunication,\nonline social media) in order to predict and contain an infectious disease\nspreading on a real-world person-to-person network of more than 500\nindividuals. We show that target groups for efficient outbreak monitoring can\nbe determined based on both telecommunication and online social network\ninformation. In case of vaccination the information regarding the digital\ncommunication networks improves the efficacy for short-range disease\ntransmissions but, surprisingly, performance is severely reduced in the case of\nlong-range transmission. These results are robust with respect to the strategy\nused to identify targeted individuals and time-gap between identification of\ntargets and the intervention. Thus, we demonstrate that data available from\ntelecommunication and online social networks can greatly improve epidemic\ncontrol measures, but it is important to consider the details of the pathogen\nspreading mechanism when such policies are applied.\n", "  EXAFS and confocal Raman microscopy have been used to study\n50SnF2.(20-x)SnO.30P2O5.xEr2O3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.25) glasses. EXAFS data reveal an\naverage coordination of Sn to O of 1.5 in both undoped glass and Er-doped glass\nsamples. The first coordination sphere of Er in glasses doped with Er2O3 was\nfound to have 9 F atom neighbours at an average bond length of 2.292+/-0.005\n{\\AA}, indicating that Er preferentially bonds with F. Raman spectra clearly\nshow the emergence of orthophosphate Q0 units on addition of Er2O3. The\nsaturation of Er solubility is found to be between 0.25 and 0.5 mol$\\%$ Er2O3.\nAn increase of the glass transition temperature from $\\sim$80{\\deg}C in undoped\nglass to $\\sim$87{\\deg}C in samples doped with 0.25 mol$\\%$ Er2O3 was also\nobserved. This process is accompanied by an increase in the difference between\nthe crystallisation and glass transition temperatures, which is usually\nassociated with improved thermal stability of the glass.\n", "  This thesis is concerned with dynamics of conservative nonlinear waves on\nbounded domains. In general, there are two scenarios of evolution. Either the\nsolution behaves in an oscillatory, quasiperiodic manner or the nonlinear\neffects cause the energy to concentrate on smaller scales leading to a\nturbulent behaviour. Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model\nand the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very\nspecial time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between\ndispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is\nconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of\ntime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded\ndomains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent\nresearch in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical\nstudies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gave\nevidence that anti-de Sitter space is unstable against black hole formation. On\nthe other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nsolutions which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for long\ntimes. We discuss here these two contrasting scenarios putting special\nattention to the construction and properties of strictly time-periodic\nsolutions. We analyze different models where solutions of this type exist.\nMoreover, we describe similarities and differences among these models\nconcerning properties of time-periodic solutions and methods used for their\nconstruction.\n", "  The dominant paradigm in assigning \"habitability\"' to terrestrial planets is\nto define a circumstellar habitable zone: the locus of orbital radii in which\nthe planet is neither too hot nor too cold for life as we know it. One\ndimensional climate models have identified theoretically impressive boundaries\nfor this zone: a runaway greenhouse or water loss at the inner edge (Venus),\nand low-latitude glaciation followed by formation of CO2 clouds at the outer\nedge. A cottage industry now exists to \"refine\" the definition of these\nboundaries each year to the third decimal place of an AU. Using the same class\nof climate model, I show that the different climate states can overlap very\nsubstantially and that \"snowball Earth\", moist temperate climate, hot moist\nclimate and a post-runaway dry climate can all be stable under the same solar\nflux. The radial extent of the temperate climate band is very narrow for pure\nwater atmospheres, but can be widened with di-nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The\nwidth of the habitable zone is thus determined by the atmospheric inventories\nof these gases. Yet Earth teaches us that these abundances are very heavily\ninfluenced (perhaps even controlled) by biology. This is paradoxical: the\nhabitable zone seeks to define the region a planet should be capable of\nharbouring life; yet whether the planet is inhabited will determine whether the\nclimate may be habitable at any given distance from the star. This matters,\nbecause future life detection missions may use habitable zone boundaries in\nmission design.\n", "  This paper extends the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the spherical pendulum\nto a full quantum theory. This the first application of geometric quantization\nto a classical system with monodromy.\n", "  For any locally defined $G_{2}-$structure and Hermitian-Yang-Mills connection\non $S^{6}$, the $G_{2}-$monopole equation always admits a local solution that\nis asymptotic to the HYM-connection.\n", "  We discuss the fate of the axial U(1) symmetry in 2-flavor QCD at finite\ntemperature, where the non-singlet chiral symmetry is restored. We first\nsummarize the previous theoretical investigation on the relation between the\neigenvalue density of the Dirac operator and the axial U(1) symmetry. We show\nthat the eigenvalue density near the origin behaves as $\\lambda^\\gamma$ with\n$\\gamma > 2$ in the chirally symmetric phase, where $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue.\nThis implies that the axial U(1) symmetry is partially restored, so that the\nlow energy symmetry of the theory becomes SU(2)$\\otimes$ SU(2)$\\otimes$ Z$_4$.\nSecondly, we report recent numerical investigations on this issue by lattice\nQCD simulations with lattice chiral fermions such as Overlap or improved\ndomain-wall fermions. Our preliminary results indicate that the eigenvalue\ndensity seems to have a gap at the origin just above $T_c$, the temperature of\nthe chiral symmetry restoration, which implies the axial U(1) symmetry is\neffectively restored at high temperature. We also point out an importance of\nthe exact lattice chiral symmetry to obtain correct results on this issue.\n", "  This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing\nalgorithms. The idea is to have sets of different but statistically similar\nimages. In this work the images show randomly distributed peppercorns.

Wavelengths and wave numbers are tabulated for 226Ra and for\nother Ra isotopes. Isotope shifts and hyperfine structure constants of even and\nodd-A isotopes of neutral radium atom and singly ionized radium are included.\nExperimental lifetimes of the states for both neutral and ionic Ra are also\nadded, where available. The information is beneficial for present and future\nexperiments aimed at different physics motivations using neutral Ra and singly\nionized Ra.\n", "  The energy range of our earlier measured activation cross-sections data of\nlonger-lived products of deuteron induced nuclear reactions on indium were\nextended from 40 MeV up to 50 MeV. The traditional stacked foil irradiation\ntechnique and non-destructive gamma spectrometry were used. No experimental\ndata were found in literature for this higher energy range. Experimental\ncross-sections for the formation of the radionuclides $^{113,110}$Sn,\n$^{116m,115m,114m,113m,111,110g,109}$In and $^{115}$Cd are reported in the\n37-50 MeV energy range, for production of $^{110}$Sn and $^{110g,109}$In these\nare the first measurements ever. The experimental data were compared with the\nresults of cross section calculations of the ALICE and EMPIRE nuclear model\ncodes and of the TALYS1.6 nuclear model code as listed in the on-line library\nTENDL-2014.\n", "  A first-principles study of the electronic and superconducting properties of\nthe Ni$_2$VAl Heusler compound is presented. The electron-phonon coupling\nconstant of $\\lambda_{ep}$ = 0.68 is obtained, which leads to a superconducting\ntransition temperature of T$_c$ = $\\sim$4 $K$ (assuming a Coulomb\npseudopotential $\\mu^*$ = 0.13), which is a relatively high transition\ntemperature for Ni based Heusler alloys. The electronic density of states\nreveals a significant hybridization between Ni-$eg$ and V-$t_{2g}$ states\naround the Fermi level. The Fermi surface, consisting of two electron pockets\naround the X-points of the Brillouin zone, exhibits nesting and leads to a Kohn\nanomaly of the phonon dispersion relation for the transverse acoustic mode TA2\nalong the (1,1,0) direction, which is furthermore found to soften with\npressure. As a consequence, T$_c$ and $\\lambda_{ep}$ vary non-monotonically\nunder pressure. The calculations are compared to similar calculations performed\nfor the Ni$_2$NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) Heusler alloys, which experimentally have\nbeen identified as superconductors. The experimental trend in T$_c$ is well\nreproduced, and reasonable quantitative agreement is obtained. The calculated\nT$_c$ of Ni$_2$VAl is larger than either calculated and observed T$_c$s of any\nof the Nb compounds. The Fermi surfaces of Ni$_2$NbAl and Ni$_2$NbGa consist of\nonly a single electron pocket around the X point, however under compression\nsecond electron pocket similar to that of Ni2VAl emerges only in Ni2NbAl and\nthe Tc increases non monotonically in all the compounds. Fermi surface nesting\nand associated Kohn anomalies are a common feature of all four compounds,\nalbeit weakest in Ni$_2$VAl.\n", "  Despite a plethora of applications ranging from quantum memories to\nhigh-resolution lithography, the current technologies to generate vector vortex\nbeams (VVBs) suffer from less efficient energy use, poor resolution, low damage\nthreshold, bulky size and complicated experimental setup, preventing further\npractical applications. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach\nto generate VVBs with a single metasurface by locally tailoring phase and\ntransverse polarization distribution. This method features the spin-orbit\ncoupling and the superposition of the converted part with an additional phase\npickup and the residual part without a phase change. By maintaining the equal\ncomponents for the converted part and the residual part, the cylindrically\npolarized vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum are experimentally\ndemonstrated based on a single metasurface at subwavelength scale. The proposed\napproach provides unprecedented freedom in engineering the properties of\noptical waves with the high-efficiency light utilization and a minimal\nfootprint.\n", "  Accurate measurements of magnetic and velocity fields in and around solar\nactive regions are key to unlocking the mysteries of the formation and the\ndecay of sunspots. High spatial resolution image and spectral sequences with a\nhigh cadence obtained with the GREGOR solar telescope give us an opportunity to\nscrutinize 3-D flow fields with local correlation tracking and imaging\nspectroscopy. We present GREGOR early science data acquired in 2014 July -\nAugust with the GREGOR Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer and the Blue Imaging\nChannel. Time-series of blue continuum (? 450.6 nm) images of the small active\nregion NOAA 12118 were restored with the speckle masking technique to derive\nhorizontal proper motions and to track the evolution of morphological changes.\nIn addition, high-resolution observations are discussed in the context of\nsynoptic data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.\n", "  The fragmentation of quasi-projectiles from the nuclear reaction\n$^{40}$Ca+$^{12}$C at 25 MeV per nucleon bombarding energy was used to produce\n$\\alpha$-emission sources. From a careful selection of these sources provided\nby a complete detection and from comparisons with models of sequential and\nsimultaneous decays, evidence in favor of $\\alpha$-particle clustering from\nexcited $^{16}O$, $^{20}Ne$ and $^{24}Mg$ is reported.\n", "  In the first part of this thesis, we study form factors of general\ngauge-invariant local composite operators in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills\ntheory at various loop orders and for various numbers of external legs. We show\nhow to use on-shell methods for their calculation and in particular extract the\ndilatation operator from the result. We also investigate the properties of the\ncorresponding remainder functions. Moreover, we extend on-shell diagrams, a\nGra{\\ss}mannian integral formulation and an integrability-based construction\nvia R-operators to form factors, focussing on the chiral part of the\nstress-tensor supermultiplet as an example. In the second part, we study the\n$\\beta$- and the $\\gamma_i$-deformation, which were respectively shown to be\nthe most general supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric field-theory\ndeformations of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are integrable at\nthe level of the asymptotic Bethe ansatz. For these theories, a new kind of\nfinite-size effect occurs, which we call prewrapping and which emerges from\ndouble-trace structures that are required in the deformed Lagrangians. While\nthe $\\beta$-deformation is conformal when the double-trace couplings are at\ntheir non-trivial IR fixed points, the $\\gamma_i$-deformation has running\ndouble-trace couplings without fixed points, which break conformal invariance\neven in the planar theory. Nevertheless, the $\\gamma_i$-deformation allows for\nhighly non-trivial field-theoretic tests of integrability at arbitrarily high\nloop orders.\n", "  We consider Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group and present a\ncomplete non-perturbative evaluation of the path integral (the partition\nfunction and certain expectation values of Wilson loops) on Seifert fibred\n3-Manifolds. We use the method of Abelianisation. In certain cases the path\nintegral can be seen to factorize neatly into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic\nparts. We obtain closed formulae of this factorization for the expectation\nvalues of torus knots.\n", "  We study the competition between unconventional superconducting pairing and\ncharge density wave (CDW) formation for the two-dimensional Edwards Hamiltonian\nat half filling, a very general two-dimensional transport model in which\nfermionic charge carriers couple to a correlated background medium. Using the\nprojective renormalization method we find that a strong renormalization of the\noriginal fermionic band causes a new hole-like Fermi surface to emerge near the\ncenter of the Brillouin zone, before it eventually gives rise to the formation\nof a charge density wave. On the new, disconnected parts of the Fermi surface\nsuperconductivity is induced with a sign-changing order parameter. We discuss\nthese findings in the light of recent experiments on iron-based oxypnictide\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Balloon-borne astronomy offers an attractive option for experiments that\nrequire precise pointing and attitude stabilization, due to a large reduction\nin the atmospheric interference observed by ground-based systems as well as the\nlow-cost and short development time-scale compared to space-borne systems. The\nBalloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT) is an instrument designed to meet the\ntechnological requirements of high precision astronomical missions and is a\nprecursor to the development of a facility class instrument with capabilities\nsimilar to the Hubble Space Telescope. The attitude determination and control\nsystems (ADCS) for BIT, the design, implementation, and analysis of which are\nthe focus of this paper, compensate for compound pendulation effects and other\nsub-orbital disturbances in the stratosphere to within 1-2$^{\\prime\\prime}$\n(rms), while back-end optics provide further image stabilization down to\n0.05$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (not discussed here). During the inaugural test flight\nfrom Timmins, Canada in September 2015, BIT ADCS pointing and stabilization\nperformed exceptionally, with coarse pointing and target acquisition to within\n< 0.1$^\\circ$ and fine stabilization to 0.68$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (rms) over long\n(10-30 minute) integrations. This level of performance was maintained during\nflight for several tracking runs that demonstrated pointing stability on the\nsky for more than an hour at a time. To refurbish and improve the system for\nthe three-month flight from New Zealand in 2018, certain modifications to the\nADCS need to be made to smooth pointing mode transitions and to correct for\ninternal biases observed during the test flight. Furthermore, the level of\nautonomy must be increased for future missions to improve system reliability\nand robustness.\n", "  The cold binary fission of even-even 244-258Cf isotopes has been studied by\ntaking the interacting barrier as the sum of Coulomb and proximity potential.\nThe favorable fragment combinations are obtained from the cold valley plot\n(plot of driving potential vs. mass number of fragments) and by calculating the\nyield for charge minimized fragments. It is found that highest yield for\n244,246,248Cf isotopes are for the fragments with isotope of Pb (Z=82) as one\nfragment, whereas for 250Cf and 252Cf isotopes the highest yield is for the\nfragments with isotope of Hg (Z=80) as one fragment. In the case of\n254,256,258Cf isotopes the highest yield is for the fragments with Sn (Z=50) as\none fragment. Thus, the fragment combinations with maximum yield reveal the\nrole of doubly magic and near doubly magic nuclei in binary fission. It is\nfound that asymmetric splitting is favoured for Cf isotopes with mass number A\n< 250 and symmetric splitting is favoured for Cf isotopes with A > 252. In the\ncase of Cf isotope with A=252, there is an equal probability for asymmetric and\nsymmetric splitting. The individual yields obtained for the cold fission of\n252Cf isotope are compared with the experimental data taken from the {\\gamma}-\n{\\gamma}- {\\gamma} coincidences technique using Gammasphere.\n", "  Avalanche control by explosion is a widely applied method to minimize the\navalanche risk to infrastructure in snow-covered mountain areas. However, the\nmechanisms involved leading from an explosion to the release of an avalanche\nare not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that weak layers fail due\nto the stress caused by propagating acoustic waves. The underlying mechanism is\nthat the stress induced by the acoustic waves exceeds the strength of the snow\nlayers. We compare field measurements to a numerical simulation of acoustic\nwave propagation in a porous material. The simulation consists of an acoustic\ndomain for the air above the snowpack and a poroelastic domain for the dry\nsnowpack. The two domains are connected by a wave field decomposition and open\npore boundary conditions. Empirical relations are used to derive a porous model\nof the snowpack from density profiles of the field experiment. Biot's equations\nare solved in the poroelastic domain to obtain simulated accelerations in the\nsnowpack and a time dependent stress field. Locations of snow failure were\nidentified by comparing the principal normal and shear stress fields to snow\nstrength which is assumed to be a function of snow porosity. One air pressure\nmeasurement above the snowpack was used to calibrate the pressure amplitude of\nthe source in the simulation. Additional field measurements of air pressure and\nacceleration measurements inside the snowpack were compared to individual field\nvariables of the simulation. The acceleration of the air flowing inside the\npore space of the snowpack was identified to have the highest correlation to\nthe acceleration measurements in the snowpack.\n", "  In this paper, we consider existence of positive solutions for the\nSchr\\\"odinger quasilinear elliptic problem $$\n  \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} \\Delta_pu+\\Delta_p(|u|^{2\\gamma})|u|^{2\\gamma-2}u =\na(x)g(u)~ \\mbox{on}~ \\mathbb{R}^N,\\\\ u>0\\ \\mbox{in}~\\mathbb{R}^N,\\\nu(x)\\stackrel{\\left|x\\right|\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} \\infty,\n\\end{array} \\right. $$ where $a(x), ~x\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and $g(s)~s>0$ are a\nnonnegative and continuous functions with $g$ being nonincreasing as well,\n$\\gamma>{1}/{2}$, and $N \\geq 1$. By a dual approach we establish sufficient\nconditions for existence and multiplicity of solutions for this problem.\n", "  Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson (2015) showed how to encode a random\nbipolar-oriented planar map by means of a random walk with a certain step size\ndistribution. Using this encoding together with the mating-of-trees\nconstruction of Liouville quantum gravity due to Duplantier, Miller, and\nSheffield (2014), they proved that random bipolar-oriented planar maps converge\nin the scaling limit to a $\\sqrt{4/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface\ndecorated by an independent SLE$_{12}$ in the peanosphere sense, meaning that\nthe height functions of a particular pair of trees on the maps converge in the\nscaling limit to the correlated planar Brownian motion which encodes the\nSLE-decorated LQG surface. We improve this convergence result by proving that\nthe pair of height functions for an infinite-volume random bipolar-oriented\ntriangulation and the pair of height functions for its dual map converge\njointly in law in the scaling limit to the two planar Brownian motions which\nencode the same $\\sqrt{4/3}$-LQG surface decorated by both an SLE$_{12}$ curve\nand the \"dual\" SLE$_{12}$ curve which travels in a direction perpendicular (in\nthe sense of imaginary geometry) to the original curve. This confirms a\nconjecture of Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson (2015).\n", "  This thesis is devoted to the application of random matrix theory to the\nstudy of random surfaces, both discrete and continuous; special emphasis is\nplaced on surface boundaries and the associated boundary conditions in this\nformalism. In particular, using a multi-matrix integral with permutation\nsymmetry, we are able to calculate the partition function of the Potts model on\na random planar lattice with various boundary conditions imposed. We proceed to\ninvestigate the correspondence between the critical points in the phase diagram\nof this model and two-dimensional Liouville theory coupled to conformal field\ntheories with global $\\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. In this context, each boundary\ncondition can be interpreted as the description of a brane in a family of\nbosonic string backgrounds. This investigation suggests that a spectrum of\ninitially distinct boundary conditions of a given system may become degenerate\nwhen the latter is placed on a random surface of bounded genus, effectively\nleaving a smaller set of independent boundary conditions. This curious and\nmuch-debated feature is then further scrutinised by considering the double\nscaling limit of a two-matrix integral. For this model, we can show explicitly\nhow this apparent degeneracy is in fact resolved by accounting for\ncontributions invisible in string perturbation theory. Altogether, these\ndevelopments provide novel descriptions of hitherto unexplored boundary\nconditions as well as new insights into the non-perturbative physics of\nboundaries and branes.\n", "  Ambulance chasing is a common socio-scientific phenomenon in particle\nphysics. I argue that despite the seeming complexity, it is possible to gain\ninsight into both the qualitative and quantitative features of ambulance\nchasing dynamics. Compound-Poisson statistics suffices to accommodate the time\nevolution of the cumulative number of papers on a topic, where basic\nassumptions that the interest in the topic as well as the number of available\nideas decrease with time appear to drive the time evolution. It follows that if\nthe interest scales as an inverse power law in time, the cumulative number of\npapers on a topic is well described by a di-gamma function, with a distinct\nlogarithmic behavior at large times. In cases where the interest decreases\nexponentially with time, the model predicts that the total number of papers on\nthe topic will converge to a fixed value as time goes to infinity. I\ndemonstrate that the two models are able to fit at least 9 specific instances\nof ambulance chasing in particle physics using only two free parameters. In\ncase of the most recent ambulance chasing instance, the ATLAS {\\gamma}{\\gamma}\nexcess, fits to the current data predict that the total number of papers on the\ntopic will not exceed 310 papers by the June 1. 2016, and prior to the natural\ncut-off for the validity of the theory.\n", "  We relate the observed pattern of leptonic mixing to the quaidegeneracy of\nthree Majorana neutrinos. We show how lifting the degeneracy may lead to the\nmeasured value of $|U_{13}|$ and to sizeable CP violation of Dirac-type. We\nshow some of the correlations obtained among physical observables, starting\nfrom some of the most interesting schemes proposed in the literature.\n", "  We perform a kinematic analysis of the Hipparcos and TRC proper motions of\nstars by using a linear Ogorodnikov-Milne model. All of the distant (r more\nthan 0.2 kpc) stars of the Hipparcos catalog have been found to rotate around\nthe Galactic y axis with an angular velocity of -0.36 +/- 0.09 mas/year. One of\nthe causes of this rotation may be an uncertainty in the lunisolar precession\nconstant adopted when constructing the ICRS. In this case? the correction to\nthe IAU (1976) lunisolar precession constant in longitude is shown to be -3.26\n+/- 0.10 mas/yr. Based on the TRC catalog, we have determined the main Oort\nconstants: A = 14.9 +/- 1.0 and B = -10.8 +/- 0.3 km/s/kpc. The component of\nthe model that describes the rotation of all TRC stars around the Galactic y\naxis is nonzero for all magnitudes, My= -0.86 +/- 0.11 mas/yr.\n", "  Based on the most complete list of the results of an individual comparison of\nthe proper motions for stars of various programs common to the Hipparcos\ncatalog, each of which is an independent realization of the inertial reference\nframe with regard to stellar proper motions, we redetermined the vector\n$\\omega$ of residual rotation of the ICRS system relative to the extragalactic\nreference frame. The equatorial components of this vector were found to be the\nfollowing: $\\omega_x = +0.04\\pm 0.15$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\\omega_y = +0.18\\pm 0.12$\nmas yr$^{-1}$, and $\\omega_z = -0.35\\pm 0.09$ mas yr$^{-1}$.\n", "  A quasionedimentional spin chain (s=1/2) is considered as a lattice\nconsisting of two sublattices. The attention is paid to the states which are\npure spin states of the whole lattice and both sublattices, the value of the\nsublattices' spins being maximum. It is shown that the Neel state can be\nconsidered as a superposition of such states. The exact equation for this\nsuperposition coefficients is developed.\n  The possibility of the Neel state to be the eigenstate of a Hamiltonian is\ndiscussed. Several model Hamiltonians are examined, the well known ones and few\nnovel Hamiltonians being considered. The time evolution of the Neel state in\ndifferent models is studied with the help of Fock-Krylov method.\n"]}
