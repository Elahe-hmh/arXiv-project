We discuss the case of the Left-Right\nsymmetric models, where this contribution implies bounds on the phases of the\nright-handed quark mixing matrix, or in generic models with large phases a\nstrong bound on the Left-Right symmetry scale. To the leading order, a numeric\nformula for epsilon' as a function of the short-distance coefficients for a\nwide class of models of new physics is given.\n", "  We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe that has\nan interacting dark matter, a modified holographic Ricci dark energy (MHRDE),\nplus a third, decoupled component that behaves as a radiation term. We consider\na nonlinear interaction in the dark component densities and their derivatives\nup to second order. We apply the $\\chi^{2}$ method to the observational Hubble\ndata for constraining the cosmological parameters and analyze the amount of\ndark energy in the radiation era for both MHRDE and holographic Ricci dark\nenergy models. The former is consistent with the bound $\\Omega_{x}(z\\simeq\n1100)<0.1$ reported for the behavior of dark energy at early times while the\nlatter does not fulfill it.\n", "  X-ray diffraction multipole refinements of single-crystalline\nMg$_x$Al$_{1-x}$B$_2$ and polarization-dependent near-edge x-ray absorption\nfine structure at the B 1$s$ edge reveal a strongly anisotropic electronic\nstructure. Comparing the data for superconducting compounds ($x= 0.8$, 1.0)\nwith those for the non-superconductor ($x=0$) gives direct evidence for a\nrearrangement of the hybridizations of the boron $p_z$ bonds and underline the\nimportance of holes in the $\\sigma$-bonded covalent $sp^2$ states for the\nsuperconducting properties of the diborides. The data indicate that Mg is\napproximately divalent in MgB$_2$ and suggest predominantly ionic bonds between\nthe Mg ions and the two-dimensional B rings. For AlB$_2$ ($x=0$), on the other\nhand, about 1.5 electrons per Al atom are transferred to the B sheets while the\nresidual 1.5 electrons remain at the Al site which suggests significant\ncovalent bonding between the Al ions and the B sheets. This finding together\nwith the static electron deformation density points to almost equivalent\nelectron counts on B sheets of MgB$_2$ and AlB$_2$\\@, yet with a completely\ndifferent electron/hole distribution between the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds.\n", "  We examine a cosmological scenario where dark matter is coupled to a variable\nvacuum energy while baryons and photons are two decoupled components for a\nspatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We apply the $\\chi^{2}$\nmethod to the updated observational Hubble data for constraining the\ncosmological parameters and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation\nera. We show that our model fulfills the severe bound of $\\Omega_{x}(z\\simeq\n1100)<0.009$ at the $2\\sigma$ level, so it is consistent with the recent\nanalysis that includes cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from\nthe Planck survey, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole\nTelescope along with the future constraints achievable by the Euclid and CMBPol\nexperiments, and fulfills the stringent bound $\\Omega_{x}(z\\simeq\n10^{10})<0.04$ at the $2\\sigma$ level in the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch.\n", "  Circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) is proving to be a powerful\nplatform to implement quantum feedback control schemes due to the ability to\ncontrol superconducting qubits and microwaves in a circuit. Here, we present a\nsimple and promising quantum feedback control scheme for deterministic\ngeneration and stabilization of a three-qubit $W$ state in the superconducting\ncircuit QED system. The control scheme is based on continuous joint Zeno\nmeasurements of multiple qubits in a dispersive regime, which enables us not\nonly to infer the state of the qubits for further information processing but\nalso to create and stabilize the target $W$ state through adaptive quantum\nfeedback control. We simulate the dynamics of the proposed quantum feedback\ncontrol scheme using the quantum trajectory approach with an effective\nstochastic maser equation obtained by a polaron-type transformation method and\ndemonstrate that in the presence of moderate environmental decoherence, the\naverage state fidelity higher than $0.9$ can be achieved and maintained for a\nconsiderable long time (much longer than the single-qubit decoherence time).\nThis control scheme is also shown to be robust against measurement inefficiency\nand individual qubit decay rate differences. Finally, the comparison of the\npolaron-type transformation method to the commonly used adiabatic elimination\nmethod to eliminate the cavity mode is presented.\n", "  We consider viscous, heat conducting mixtures of molecularly miscible\nchemical species forming a fluid in which the constituents can undergo chemical\nreactions. Assuming a common temperature for all components, we derive a closed\nsystem of partial mass and partial momentum balances plus a mixture balance of\ninternal energy. This is achieved by careful exploitation of the entropy\nprinciple and requires appropriate definitions of absolute temperature and\nchemical potentials, based on an adequate definition of thermal energy\nexcluding diffusive contributions. The resulting interaction forces split into\na thermo-mechanical and a chemical part, where the former turns out to be\nsymmetric in case of binary interactions. For chemically reacting systems and\nas a new result, the chemical interaction force is a contribution being\nnon-symmetric outside of chemical equilibrium. The theory also provides a\nrigorous derivation of the so-called generalized thermodynamic driving forces,\navoiding the use of approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equations. Moreover,\nusing an appropriately extended version of the entropy principle and\nintroducing cross-effects already before closure as entropy invariant couplings\nbetween principal dissipative mechanisms, the Onsager symmetry relations become\na strict consequence. With a classification of the factors in the binary\nproducts of the entropy production according to their parity--instead of the\nclassical partition into so-called fluxes and driving forces--the apparent\nanti-symmetry of certain couplings is thereby also revealed. If the diffusion\nvelocities are small compared to the speed of sound, the Maxwell-Stefan\nequations follow in the case without chemistry, thereby neglecting wave\nphenomena in the diffusive motion. This results in a reduced model with only\nmass being balanced individually. In the reactive case ...\n", "  We apply measures of complexity, emergence and self-organization to an\nabstract city traffic model for comparing a traditional traffic coordination\nmethod with a self-organizing method in two scenarios: cyclic boundaries and\nnon-orientable boundaries. We show that the measures are useful to identify and\ncharacterize different dynamical phases. It becomes clear that different\noperation regimes are required for different traffic demands. Thus, not only\ntraffic is a non-stationary problem, which requires controllers to adapt\nconstantly. Controllers must also change drastically the complexity of their\nbehavior depending on the demand. Based on our measures, we can say that the\nself-organizing method achieves an adaptability level comparable to a living\nsystem.\n", "  We study two-component Bose gases with Raman induced spin-orbit coupling via\na perturbation approach at finite temperature. For weak coupling, free energy\nis expanded in terms of Raman coupling strength up to the second order, where\nthe coefficient (referred to as Raman susceptibility) is determined according\nto linear response theory. The equation of state for the stripe phase and the\nplane-wave phase are obtained in Popov approximation, and the first order\ntransition between these two phases is investigated. As temperature increases,\nwe find the phase boundary bends toward the stripe phase side in most\ntemperature regions, which implies the ferromagnetic order is more robust than\nthe crystalline order in presence of thermal fluctuations. Our results\nqualitatively agree with the recent experimental observation in rubidium atomic\ngases. A method to measure the Raman susceptibility through the two-photon\nBragg scattering experiment is also discussed.\n", "  To account for the origin of information accumulation in nature despite the\nentropy-increase law, we advocate a universal mechanism due to\ncompetition/selection of general composite entities, from simple to complex. To\nconfirm its universality, we show that even simplest composites such as an\natom, a molecule etc. are subject to this mechanism and accumulate information.\n", "  On the one hand, Socolar showed in 1990 that the n-fold planar tilings admit\nweak local rules when n is not divisible by 4 (the n=10 case corresponds to the\nPenrose tilings and is known since 1974). On the other hand, Burkov showed in\n1988 that the 8-fold tilings do not admit weak local rules, and Le showed the\nsame for the 12-fold tilings (unpublished). We here show that this is actually\nthe case for all the 4p-fold tilings.\n", "  Ashby's law of requisite variety states that a controller must have at least\nas much variety (complexity) as the controlled. Maturana and Varela proposed\nautopoiesis (self-production) to define living systems. Living systems also\nrequire to fulfill the law of requisite variety. A measure of autopoiesis has\nbeen proposed as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the\ncomplexity of its environment. Self-organization can be used as a concept to\nguide the design of systems towards higher values of autopoiesis, with the\npotential of making technology more \"living\", i.e. adaptive and robust.\n", "  This paper presents an example where the morphology of a single stellar\nstream can be used to rule out a specific galactic potential form without the\nneed for velocity information. We investigate the globular cluster Palomar5\n(Pal 5), which is tidally disrupting into a cold, thin stream mapped over 22\ndegrees on the sky with a typical width of 0.7 degrees. We generate models of\nthis stream by fixing Pal 5's present-day position, distance and radial\nvelocity via observations, while allowing its proper motion to vary. In a\nspherical dark matter halo we easily find models that fit the observed\nmorphology. However, no plausible Pal 5 model could be found in the triaxial\npotential of Law & Majewski (2010), which has been proposed to explain the\nproperties of the Sagittarius stream. In this case, the long, thin and curved\nmorphology of the Pal5 stream alone can be used to rule out such a potential\nconfiguration. Pal 5 like streams in this potential are either too straight,\nmissing the curvature of the observations, or show an unusual morphology which\nwe dub stream-fanning: a signature sensitive to the triaxiality of a potential.\nWe conclude that the mere existence of other thin tidal streams must provide\nbroad constraints on the orientation and shape of the dark matter halo they\ninhabit.\n", "  We study some graded geometric constructions appearing naturally in the\ncontext of gauge theories. Inspired by a known relation of gauging with\nequivariant cohomology we generalize the latter notion to the case of arbitrary\nQ-manifolds introducing thus the concept of equivariant Q-cohomology. Using\nthis concept we describe a procedure for analysis of gauge symmetries of given\nfunctionals as well as for constructing functionals (sigma models) invariant\nunder an action of some gauge group.\n  As the main example of application of these constructions we consider the\ntwisted Poisson sigma model. We obtain it by a gauging-type procedure of the\naction of an essentially infinite dimensional group and describe its symmetries\nin terms of classical differential geometry.\n  We comment on other possible applications of the described concept including\nthe analysis of supersymmetric gauge theories and higher structures.\n", "  One aspect of solid-state photonic devices that distinguishes them from their\natomic counterparts is the unavoidable interaction between system excitations\nand lattice vibrations of the host material. This coupling may lead to\nsurprising departures in emission properties between solid-state and atomic\nsystems. Here we predict a striking and important example of such an effect. We\nshow that in solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics, interactions with the\nhost vibrational environment can generate quantum cavity-emitter correlations\nin regimes that are semiclassical for atomic systems. This behaviour, which can\nbe probed experimentally through the cavity emission properties, heralds a\nfailure of the semiclassical approach in the solid-state, and challenges the\nnotion that coupling to a thermal bath supports a more classical description of\nthe system. Furthermore, it does not rely on the spectral details of the host\nenvironment under consideration and is robust to changes in temperature. It\nshould thus be of relevance to a wide variety of photonic devices.\n", "  Topological properties of the spin-1/2 dimerized Heisenberg ladder are\ninvestigated focusing on the plateau phase in the magnetic field whose\nmagnetization is half of the saturation value. Although the applied magnetic\nfield removes most of the symmetries of the system, there is a symmetry\nprotected topological phase supported by the spatial inversion symmetry. The\nZ_2 Berry phase associated with a symmetry respecting boundary and quantized\ninto 0 and \\pi is used as a symmetry protected topological order parameter.\nEdge states are also analyzed to confirm the bulk-edge correspondence. In\naddition, a symmetry breaking boundary is considered. Then, we observe a unique\ntype of quantization of the Berry phase, a quantization into +-\\pi/2 of the\nBerry phase. In this case, the bulk-edge correspondence is also unique, namely,\nthere emerge \"polarized\" edge states for the case with +-\\pi/2 quantization. We\nalso evaluate the entanglement entropy by the infinite time-evolving block\ndecimation (iTEBD) to complement the Berry phase based arguments. Further, a\ndifferent type of the topological order parameter is extracted from the matrix\nproduct state representation of the ground state given by the iTEBD.\n", "  We define a new concept of local states in the framework of algebraic quantum\nfield theory (AQFT). Local states are a natural generalization of states and\ngive a clear vision of localization in the context of QFT. In terms of them, we\ncan find a condition from which follows automatically the famous DHR selection\ncriterion in DHR-DR theory. As a result, we can understand the condition as\nconsequences of physically natural state preparations in vacuum backgrounds.\nFurthermore, a theory of orthogonal decomposition of completely positive (CP)\nmaps is developed. It unifies a theory of orthogonal decomposition of states\nand order structure theory of CP maps. By using it, localized version of\nsectors is formulated, which gives sector theory for local states with respect\nto general reference representations.\n", "  Employing the linear sigma model, the effective masses of quasi-particle\nexcitations are found to exhibit significant variations within the phase\ndiagram, which has a critical point at non-zero chemical potential, where a\nfirst-order phase transition sets in. Soft-photon emission rates in lowest\norder display, for selected channels, a sensible dependence on the effective\nmasses of the involved excitations and let us argue that they could map out the\nphase diagram.\n", "  We present a formalism for strongly correlated electrons systems which\nconsists in a local approximation of the dynamical three-leg interaction\nvertex. This vertex is self-consistently computed with a quantum impurity model\nwith dynamical interactions in the charge and spin channels, similar to\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approaches. The electronic self-energy and\nthe polarization are both frequency and momentum dependent. The method\ninterpolates between the spin-fluctuation or GW approximations at weak coupling\nand the atomic limit at strong coupling. We apply the formalism to the Hubbard\nmodel on a two-dimensional square lattice and show that as interactions are\nincreased towards the Mott insulating state, the local vertex acquires a strong\nfrequency dependence, driving the system to a Mott transition, while at low\nenough temperatures the momentum-dependence of the self-energy is enhanced due\nto large spin fluctuations. Upon doping, we find a Fermi arc in the\none-particle spectral function, which is one signature of the pseudo-gap state.\n", "  We concisely review the recent evolution in the study of parafermions --\nexotic emergent excitations that generalize Majorana fermions and similarly\nunderpin a host of novel phenomena. First we illustrate the intimate connection\nbetween Z_3-symmetric \"spin\" chains and one-dimensional parafermion lattice\nmodels, highlighting how the latter host a topological phase featuring\nprotected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory\nrealization of parafermion zero modes -- focusing on quantum\nHall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional\ntopological insulators -- and describe striking experimental fingerprints that\nthey provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum\nHall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware\nfor a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer.\n", "  It has been known since the pioneering work of Bernal, Fowler and Pauling\nthat common, hexagonal (Ih) water ice is the archetype of a frustrated material\n: a proton-bonded network in which protons satisfy strong local constraints -\nthe \"ice rules\" - but do not order. While this proton disorder is well\nestablished, there is now a growing body of evidence that quantum effects may\nalso have a role to play in the physics of ice at low temperatures. In this\nArticle we use a combination of numerical and analytic techniques to explore\nthe nature of proton correlations in both classical and quantum models of ice\nIh. In the case of classical ice Ih, we find that the ice rules have two,\ndistinct, consequences for scattering experiments - singular \"pinch points\",\nreflecting a zero-divergence condition on the uniform polarization of the\ncrystal, and broad, asymmetric features, coming from its staggered\npolarisation. In the case of the quantum model, we find that the collective\nquantum tunnelling of groups of protons can convert states obeying the ice\nrules into a quantum liquid, whose excitations are birefringent, emergent\nphotons. We make explicit predictions for scattering experiments on both\nclassical and quantum ice Ih, and show how the quantum theory can explain the\n\"wings\" of incoherent inelastic scattering observed in recent neutron\nscattering experiments [Bove et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 165901 (2009)].\nThese results raise the intriguing possibility that the protons in ice Ih could\nform a quantum liquid at low temperatures, in which protons are not merely\ndisordered, but continually fluctuate between different configurations obeying\nthe ice rules.\n", "  Single crystals of K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ are prepared by quenching at various\ntemperatures. The crystals obtained at higher quenching temperatures have a\nsurface morphology with mesh-like texture. They show a sharp superconducting\ntransition at $T_\\rm{c}$ ~32 K with a large shielding volume fraction. On the\nother hand, the crystals prepared without quenching show an onset\nsuperconducting transition at ~44 K and a zero resistivity around ~33 K, and\nthey possess island-like regions on the surface with a larger amount of Fe\nincorporation. In-situ high-temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements tell us the Fe-vacancy ordered phase is generated at a temperature\nregion around 270 {\\deg}C via iron diffusion. The creation of this Fe-vacancy\nordered phase may become a driving force of the growth of the higher $T_\\rm{c}$\nphase. The superconductivity at ~44 K is attributed to a metallic phase with no\nFe-vacancy.\n", "  Optical selection rule fundamentally determines the optical transition\nbetween energy states in a variety of physical systems from hydrogen atoms to\nbulk crystals such as GaAs. It is important for optoelectronic applications\nsuch as lasers, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and quantum computation.\nRecently, single layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) exhibits valleys\nin momentum space with nontrivial Berry curvature and excitons with large\nbinding energy. However, it is unclear how the unique valley degree of freedom\ncombined with the strong excitonic effect influences the optical excitation.\nHere we discover a new set of optical selection rules in monolayer WS2,imposed\nby valley and exciton angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrated such a\nprinciple for second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon luminescence\n(TPL). Moreover, the two-photon induced valley populations yield net circular\npolarized photoluminescence after a sub-ps interexciton relaxation (2p->1s) and\nlast for 8 ps. The discovery of this new optical selection rule in valleytronic\n2D system not only largely extend information degrees but sets a foundation in\ncontrol of optical transitions that is crucial to valley optoeletronic device\napplications such as 2D valley-polarized light emitting diodes (LED), optical\nswitches and coherent control for quantum computing.\n", "  We consider relatively rare events of SUSY production at the LHC without\nmissing $p_T$. Namely, we discuss the chargino production with further decay\ninto the W-boson and the neutralino when the masses of chargino and neutralino\ndiffer by 80-90 GeV. In this case, in the final state one has two Ws and\nmissing $E_T$ but no missing $P_T$. The produced neutralinos are just busted\nalong Ws. Within the MSSM such events are quite probable in the region of\nparameter space close to the EWSB border line. The excess in the W production\ncross-section may achieve a few \\%.\n", "  A novel investigation of the nature of intermittency in incompressible,\nhomogeneous and isotropic turbulence is performed by a numerical study of the\nNavier-Stokes equations constrained on a fractal Fourier set. The robustness of\nthe energy transfer and of the vortex stretching mechanisms is tested by\nchanging the fractal dimension, D, from the original three dimensional case to\na strongly decimated system with D=2.5, where only about $3\\%$ of the Fourier\nmodes interact. This is a unique methodology to probe the statistical\nproperties of the turbulent energy cascade, without breaking any of the\noriginal symmetries of the equations. While the direct energy cascade persists,\ndeviations from the Kolmogorov scaling are observed in the kinetic energy\nspectra. A model in terms of a correction with a linear dependency on the\nco-dimension of the fractal set, $E(k) \\sim k^{-5/3 + 3-D}$, explains the\nresults. At small scales, the intermittency of the vorticity field is observed\nto be quasi-singular as a function of the fractal mode reduction, leading to an\nalmost Gaussian statistics already at $D \\sim 2.98$. These effects must be\nconnected to a genuine modification in the triad-to-triad nonlinear energy\ntransfer mechanism.\n", "  Along a microtubule, certain active motors propel themselves in one direction\nwhereas others propel themselves in the opposite direction. For example, the\ncargo transporting motor proteins dynein and kinesin propel themselves towards\nthe so-called plus- and minus-ends of the microtubule, respectively, and in so\ndoing are able to pass one another, but not without interacting. We address the\nemergent collective behavior of systems composed of many motors, some\npropelling towards the plus-end and others propelling towards the minus-end. To\ndo this, we used an analogy between this strongly interacting,\nfar-from-equilibrium, classical stochastic many-motor system and a certain\nquantum-mechanical many-body system evolving in imaginary time. We apply\nwell-known methods from quantum many-body theory, including self-consistent\nmean-field theory and bosonization, to shed light on phenomena exhibited by the\nmany-motor system such as structure formation and the dynamics of collective\nmodes at low-frequencies and long-wavelengths. In particular, via the bosonized\ndescription we find analogs of chiral Luttinger liquids, as well as a\nqualitative transition in the nature of the low-frequency modes---from\npropagating to purely dissipative---controlled by density and interaction\nstrength.\n", "  We propose a simple mean-field ansatz to study phase transitions from a\ntopological phase to a trivial phase. We probe the efficiency of this approach\nby considering the string-net model in the presence of a string tension for any\nanyon theory. Such a perturbation is known to be responsible for a\ndeconfinement-confinement phase transition which is well described by the\npresent variational setup. We argue that mean-field results become exact in the\nlimit of large total quantum dimension.\n", "  Mathematics is usually regarded as a kind of language. The essential behavior\nof physical phenomena can be expressed by mathematical laws, providing\ndescriptions and predictions. In the present essay I argue that, although\nmathematics can be seen, in a first approach, as a language, it goes beyond\nthis concept. I conjecture that mathematics presents two extreme features,\ndenoted here by {\\sl irreducibility} and {\\sl insaturation}, representing\ndelimiters for self-referentiality. These features are then related to physical\nlaws by realizing that nature is a self-referential system obeying bounds\nsimilar to those respected by mathematics. Self-referential systems can only be\nautonomous entities by a kind of metabolism that provides and sustains such an\nautonomy. A rational mind, able of consciousness, is a manifestation of the\nself-referentiality of the Universe. Hence mathematics is here proposed to go\nbeyond language by actually representing the most fundamental existence\ncondition for self-referentiality. This idea is synthesized in the form of a\nprinciple, namely, that {\\sl mathematics is the ultimate tactics of\nself-referential systems to mimic themselves}. That is, well beyond an\neffective language to express the physical world, mathematics uncovers a deep\nmanifestation of the autonomous nature of the Universe, wherein the human brain\nis but an instance.\n", "  The slower is faster (SIF) effect occurs when a system performs worse as its\ncomponents try to do better. Thus, a moderate individual efficiency actually\nleads to a better systemic performance. The SIF effect takes place in a variety\nof phenomena. We review studies and examples of the SIF effect in pedestrian\ndynamics, vehicle traffic, traffic light control, logistics, public transport,\nsocial dynamics, ecological systems, and adaptation. Drawing on these examples,\nwe generalize common features of the SIF effect and suggest possible future\nlines of research.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a standard static Finsler spacetime where the base\nis a Finsler manifold. We prove some results which connect causality with the\nFinslerian geometry of the base extending analogous ones for static and\nstationary Lorentzian spacetimes.\n", "  Addition of boundary localised kinetic and Yukawa terms to the action of a\n5-dimensional Standard Model would non-trivially modify the Kaluza-Klein\nspectra and some of the interactions among the Kaluza-Klein excitations\ncompared to the minimal version of this model, in which, these boundary terms\nare not present. In the minimal version of this framework known as Universal\nExtra Dimensional model, special assumptions are made about these unknown,\nbeyond the cut-off contributions to restrict the number of unknown parameters\nof the theory to a minimal. We estimate the contribution of Kaluza-Klein modes\nto the branching ratios of $B_{s(d)}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ in the framework\nof non-minimal Universal Extra Dimensional, at one loop level. The results have\nbeen compared to the experimental data to constrain the parameters of this\nmodel. From the measured decay branching ratio of $B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\n(depending on the values of boundary localised parameters) lower limit on\n$R^{-1}$ can be as high as 800 GeV. We have briefly reviewed the bounds on\nnmUED parameter space coming from electroweak precision observables. The\npresent analysis ($B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$) has ruled out new regions of\nparameter space in comparison to the analysis of electroweak data. We have\nrevisited the bound on $R^{-1}$ in Universal Extra Dimensional model, which\ncame out to be 454 GeV. This limit on $R^{-1}$ in Universal Extra Dimensional\nframework is not as competitive as the limits derived from the consideration of\nrelic density or Standard Model Higgs boson production and decay to $W^+ W^-$.\nUnfortunately, $B_{d}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay branching ratio would not\nset any significant limit on $R^{-1}$ in a minimal or non-minimal Universal\nExtra Dimensional model.\n", "  We study a class of shear-free, homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological\nmodels with imperfect matter sources in the context of f(R) gravity. We show\nthat the anisotropic stresses are related to the electric part of the Weyl\ntensor in such a way that they balance each other. We also show that within the\nclass of orthogonal f(R) models, small perturbations of shear are damped, and\nthat the electric part of the Weyl tensor and the anisotropic stress tensor\ndecay with the expansion as well as the heat flux of the curvature fluid.\nSpecializing in locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes in orthonormal\nframes, we examine the late-time behaviour of the de Sitter universe in $f(R)$\ngravity. For the Starobinsky model of f(R), we study the evolutionary behavior\nof the Universe by numerically integrating the Friedmann equation, where the\ninitial conditions for the expansion, acceleration and jerk parameters are\ntaken from observational data.\n", "  In the derivation of synchrotron radiation formulas it has been assumed that\nthe pitch angle of a charge remains constant during the radiation process.\nHowever from the radiation reaction formula, while the component of the\nvelocity vector perpendicular to the magnetic field reduces in magnitude due to\nradiative losses, the parallel component does not undergo any change during\nradiation. Therefore there is a change in the ratio of the two components,\nimplying a change in the pitch angle. We derive the exact formula for the\nchange in energy of radiating electrons by taking into account the change of\nthe pitch angle due to radiative losses. From this we derive the characteristic\ndecay time of synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly\nrelativistic into mildly relativistic ones.\n", "  We study the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix\nof two intervals for the free massless Dirac fermion. By means of a direct\ncalculation based on coherent state path integral, we find an analytic form for\nthese moments in terms of the Riemann theta function. We show that the moments\nof arbitrary order are equal to the same quantities for the compactified boson\nat the self-dual point. These equalities imply the non trivial result that also\nthe negativity of the free fermion and the self-dual boson are equal.\n", "  Topological way of thinking now goes beyond conventional solid materials, and\ntopological characterization of classical mechanical systems governed by\nNewton's equation of motion begins to attract much attention. To have a deeper\ninsight on physical meaning of topological numbers in mechanical systems, we\ndemonstrate the use of the Hannay angle, a classical counterpart of the Berry\nphase, as a symmetry protected topological order parameter. We first derive the\nHannay angle using a canonical transformation that maps the Newton's equation\nto the Schr\\\"{o}dinger type equation. The Hannay angle is then used to\ncharacterize a simple spring-mass model topologically with a particular focus\non the bulk-edge correspondence and new aspects of the symmetry in a classical\nsystem.\n", "  We have determined the lattice dynamics of MgSiO$_3$ perovskite (bridgmanite)\nby a combination of single-crystal inelastic x-ray scattering and ab initio\ncalculations. We observe a remarkable agreement between experiment and theory,\nand provide accurate results for phonon dispersion relations, phonon density of\nstates and the full elasticity tensor. The present work constitutes an\nimportant milestone to extend this kind of combined studies to extreme\nconditions of pressure and temperature, directly relevant for the physics and\nthe chemistry of Earth's lower mantle.\n", "  We study the conformal bootstrap constraints for 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsuperconformal field theories containing a chiral operator $\\phi$ and the\nchiral ring relation $\\phi^2=0$. Hints for a minimal interacting SCFT in this\nclass have appeared in previous numerical bootstrap studies. We perform a\ndetailed study of the properties of this conjectured theory, establishing that\nthe corresponding solution to the bootstrap constraints contains a\n$\\text{U}(1)_R$ current multiplet and estimating the central charge and\nlow-lying operator spectrum of this theory.\n", "  Most III-nitride semiconductors are grown on non-lattice-matched substrates\nlike sapphire or silicon due to the extreme difficulty of obtaining a native\nGaN substrate. We show that several layered transition-metal dichalcogenides\nare closely lattice matched to GaN and report the growth of GaN on a range of\nsuch layered materials. We report detailed studies of the growth of GaN on\nmechanically-exfoliated flakes WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ by metalorganic vapour phase\nepitaxy. Structural and optical characterization show that strain-free,\nsingle-crystal islands of GaN are obtained on the underlying chalcogenide\nflakes. We obtain strong near-band-edge emission from these layers, and analyse\ntheir temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties. We also report a\nproof-of-concept demonstration of large-area epitaxial growth of GaN on CVD\nMoS$_2$. Our results show that the transition-metal dichalcogenides can serve\nas novel near-lattice-matched substrates for nitride growth.\n", "  A $\\delta N$ formalism is used to study the non-Gaussianity of the primordial\ncurvature perturbation on an uniform density hypersurfaces generated by the\nwarm inflation for the first time. After introducing the framework of the warm\ninflation and the $\\delta N$ formalism, we obtain an analytic expression for\nthe nonlinear parameter $f_{NL}$ that describes the non-Gaussianity in slow\nroll approximation, and find that the $\\delta N$ formalism gives a very good\nresult. We analyse the magnitude of $f_{NL}$ and compare our result with those\nof the standard inflation. Then we discuss two concrete examples: the quartic\nchaotic model and the hilltop model. The quartic potential model can again be\nin very good agreement with the Planck results in the warm inflationary\nscenario, and we give out the concrete results of how the nonlinear parameter\ndepends on the dissipation strength of the warm inflation and the amounts of\nexpansion. We find that the range of the nonlinear parameters in these two\ncases are both well inside of the allowed region of Planck.\n", "  Cold atomic gases have provided us with a great number of opportunities for\nstudying various physical systems under controlled conditions that are seldom\noffered in other fields. We are thus at the point where one can truly do\nquantum simulation of models that are relevant for instance in condensed-matter\nor high-energy physics, i.e. we are on the verge of a 'cool' quantum simulator\nas envisioned by Feynman. One of the avenues under exploration is the physics\nof one-dimensional systems. Until recently this was mostly in the many-body\nlimit but now experiments can be performed with controllable particle numbers\nall the way down to the few-body regime. After a brief introduction to some of\nthe relevant experiments, I will review recent theoretical work on\none-dimensional quantum systems containing bosons, fermions, or mixtures of the\ntwo, with a particular emphasis on the case where the particles are held by an\nexternal trap.\n", "  It is demonstrated how quantum mechanics emerges from the stochastic dynamics\nof force-carriers. It is shown that the quantum Moyal equation corresponds to\nsome dynamic correlations between the momentum of a real particle and the\nposition of a virtual particle, which are not present in classical mechanics.\nThe new concept throws light on the physical meaning of quantum theory, showing\nthat the Planck constant square is a second-second cross-cumulant.\n", "  We analytically study the lightcone limit of the conformal bootstrap for\n4-point functions containing scalars charged under global symmetries. We show\nthe existence of large spin double-twist operators in various representations\nof the global symmetry group. We then compute their anomalous dimensions in\nterms of the central charge $C_T$, current central charge $C_J$, and the OPE\ncoefficients of low dimension scalars. In AdS, these results correspond to the\nbinding energy of two-particle states arising from the exchange of gravitons,\ngauge bosons, and light scalar fields. Using unitarity and crossing symmetry,\nwe show that gravity is universal and attractive among different types of\ntwo-particle states, while the gauge binding energy can have either sign as\ndetermined by the representation of the two-particle state, with universal\nratios fixed by the symmetry group. We apply our results to 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nSQCD and the 3D O(N) vector models. We also show that in a unitary CFT, if the\ncurrent central charge $C_J$ stays finite when the global symmetry group\nbecomes infinitely large, such as the $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit of the O(N)\nvector model, then the theory must contain an infinite number of higher spin\ncurrents.\n", "  We develop the theoretical formalism to calculate second-order correlations\nin dissipative exciton-polariton system and we propose intensity-intensity\ncorrelation experiments to reveal the physics of exciton-light coupling in\nsemiconductor microcavities in the Rabi oscillation regime. We predict a\ncounter intuitive behaviour of the correlator between upper and lower polariton\nbranches: due to the decoherence caused by stochastic exciton-photon\nconversions this correlator is expected to decrease below 1, while the\nindividual second-order coherence of upper and lower polaritons exhibits\nnon-monotonous bunching.\n", "  We extend previously proposed measures of complexity, emergence, and\nself-organization to continuous distributions using differential entropy. This\nallows us to calculate the complexity of phenomena for which distributions are\nknown. We find that a broad range of common parameters found in Gaussian and\nscale-free distributions present high complexity values. We also explore the\nrelationship between our measure of complexity and information adaptation.\n", "  Thermal phenomena in quantum field theory can be detected with the aid of\nparticle detectors coupled to quantum fields along stationary worldlines, by\ntesting whether the response of such a detector satisfies the detailed balance\nversion of the KMS condition at a constant temperature. This relation holds\nwhen the interaction between the field and the detector has infinite time\nduration. Operationally, however, detectors interact with fields for a finite\namount of time, controlled by a switching function of compact support, and the\nKMS detailed balance condition cannot hold exactly for finite time interactions\nat arbitrarily large detector energy gap. In this large energy gap regime, we\nshow that, for an adiabatically switched Rindler detector, the Unruh\ntemperature emerges asymptotically after the detector and the field have\ninteracted for a time that is polynomially long in the large energy. We comment\non the significance of the adiabaticity assumption in this result.\n", "  Composite multiferroics, heterostructures of ferromagnetic (FM) and\nferroelectric (FE) materials, are characterized by a remarkable magnetoelectric\neffect at the interface. Previous work has supported the ferromagnetic\nstructure with magnetic spins and the ferroelectric with pseudospins which act\nas electric dipoles in a microscopic model, coupled with a magnetoelectric\ninteraction [J. Appl. Phys. 118, 124109 (2015)]. In this work, by solving the\nstochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, the electric-field-induced\nmagnetization switching in a twisted boundary condition has been studied, and a\nbehavior of domain wall in the ferromagnetic structure is discussed.\n", "  The creation of electron-positron pairs by the strong-field Breit-Wheeler\nprocess in intense short laser pulses is investigated in the framework of\nlaser-dressed quantum electrodynamics. Regarding laser field parameters in the\nmultiphoton regime, special attention is brought to the energy spectrum of the\ncreated particles, which can be reproduced and explained by means of an\nintuitive model. The model is based on the probabilities of multiphoton events\ndriven by the spectral components of the laser pulse. It allows, in particular,\nto identify interferences between different pair production channels which\nexhibit a characteristic dependence on the laser carrier-envelope phase.\n", "  We analytically study the lightcone limit of the conformal bootstrap\nequations for 4-point functions containing global symmetry currents and the\nstress tensor in 3d CFTs. We show that the contribution of the stress tensor to\nthe anomalous dimensions of large spin double-twist states is negative if and\nonly if the conformal collider physics bounds are satisfied. In the context of\nAdS/CFT these results indicate a relation between the attractiveness of AdS\ngravity and positivity of the CFT energy flux. We also study the contribution\nof non-Abelian conserved currents to the anomalous dimensions of double-twist\noperators, corresponding to the gauge binding energy of 2-particle states in\nAdS. We show that the representation of the double-twist state determines the\nsign of the gauge binding energy if and only if the coefficient appearing in\nthe current 3-point function satisfies a similar bound, which is equivalent to\nan upper bound on the charge flux asymmetry of the CFT.\n", "  We study the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement between\nfinite subsystems of infinite two-dimensional free lattice models, as measured\nby the logarithmic negativity. For adjacent regions with a common boundary, we\nobserve that the negativity follows a strict area law for a lattice of harmonic\noscillators, whereas for fermionic hopping models the numerical results\nindicate a multiplicative logarithmic correction. In this latter case, we\nconjecture a formula for the prefactor of the area-law violating term, which is\nentirely determined by the geometries of the Fermi surface and the boundary\nbetween the subsystems. The conjecture is tested against numerical results and\na good agreement is found.\n", "  We examine the effects of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on\nlow-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm star}=2\\times10^6-5\\times10^{10}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$)\nusing the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. While previous\nstudies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we\ninvestigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration,\nsize evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows\ndrive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales\nvia two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming,\nproducing young stars that migrate $\\sim1{\\rm\\,kpc}$ within their first $100\n{\\rm\\,Myr}$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the\nglobal potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce\nseveral dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by\nfactors of $>2$ over $\\sim200 {\\rm\\,Myr}$, and these rapid size fluctuations\ncan account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed $M_{\\rm star}.$\nSecond, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat\nstellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This\nage-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and\nmetallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating\nradial star-formation histories from stellar populations at $z=0$ can be\nseverely biased. These effects are strongest at $M_{\\rm\nstar}\\approx10^{7-9.6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, the same regime where feedback most\nefficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics\nin low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic\nsolutions to small-scale problems in $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  We report inclusive and exclusive measurements for $\\chi_{c1}$ and\n$\\chi_{c2}$ production in $B$ decays. We measure $\\mathcal{B}(B \\to \\chi_{c1}\nX)$= $(3.03 \\pm 0.05(\\mbox{stat}) \\pm 0.24(\\mbox{syst})) \\times 10^{-3}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(B \\to \\chi_{c2} X)$= $(0.70 \\pm 0.06(\\mbox{stat}) \\pm\n0.10(\\mbox{syst})) \\times 10^{-3}$. For the first time, $\\chi_{c2}$ production\nin exclusive $B$ decays in the modes $B^0 \\to \\chi_{c2}\\pi^- K^+$ and $B^+ \\to\n\\chi_{c2} \\pi^+ \\pi^- K^+$ has been observed, along with first evidence for the\n$B^+ \\to \\chi_{c2} \\pi^+ K_S^0$ decay mode. For $\\chi_{c1}$ production, we\nreport the first observation in the $B^+ \\to \\chi_{c1} \\pi^+ \\pi^- K^+$, $B^0\n\\to \\chi_{c1} \\pi^+ \\pi^- K_S^0$ and $B^0 \\to \\chi_{c1} \\pi^0 \\pi^- K^+$ decay\nmodes. Using these decay modes, we observe a difference in the production\nmechanism of $\\chi_{c2}$ in comparison to $\\chi_{c1}$ in $B$ decays. In\naddition, we report searches for $X(3872)$ and $\\chi_{c1}(2P)$ in the $B^+ \\to\n(\\chi_{c1} \\pi^+ \\pi^-) K^+$ decay mode. The reported results use $772 \\times\n10^{6}$ $B\\overline{B}$ events collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with\nthe Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider.\n", "  We analyze the finite-temperature effects on the phase diagram describing the\ninsulating properties of interacting 1D bosons in a quasi-periodic lattice. We\nexamine thermal effects by comparing experimental results to exact\ndiagonalization for small-sized systems and to density-matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG) computations. At weak interactions, we find short thermal\ncorrelation lengths, indicating a substantial impact of temperature on the\nsystem coherence. Conversely, at strong interactions, the obtained thermal\ncorrelation lengths are significantly larger than the localization length, and\nthe quantum nature of the T=0 Bose glass phase is preserved up to a crossover\ntemperature that depends on the disorder strength. Furthermore, in the absence\nof disorder, we show how quasi-exact finite-T DMRG computations, compared to\nexperimental results, can be employed to estimate the temperature, which is not\ndirectly accessible in the experiment.\n", "  We investigate the van der Waals interaction between neutrons using the\ntheory of Casimir and Polder, wherein the potential for asymptotically large\nseparations falls off as the inverse seventh power, and compare it to the\nsimilar interaction between a neutron and a proton, for which the asymptotic\ninteraction falls off as the inverse fourth power. Modifications of the\nformalism to extend the validity to smaller separations using dynamic electric\nand magnetic dipole polarizability data are discussed\n", "  According to inflationary cosmology, the CMB anisotropy gives an opportunity\nto test predictions of new physics hypotheses. The initial state of quantum\nfluctuations is one of the important options at high energy scale, as it can\naffect observables such as the CMB power spectrum. In this study a quasi-de\nSitter inflationary background with approximate de Sitter mode function built\nover the Bunch-Davies mode is applied to investigate the scale-dependency of\nthe CMB anisotropy. The recent Planck constraint on spectral index motivated us\nto examine the effect of a new excited mode function (instead of pure de Sitter\nmode) on the CMB anisotropy at large angular scales. In so doing, it is found\nthat the angular scale-invariance in the CMB temperature fluctuations is broken\nand in the limit $ \\ell<200 $ a tiny deviation appears. Also, it is shown that\nthe power spectrum of CMB anisotropy is dependent on a free parameter with mass\ndimension $H<<M_{*}<M_{p}$ and on the slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon $.\n", "  This article reviews several important results from RHIC experiments and\ndiscusses their implications. They were obtained in a unique environment for\nstudying QCD matter at temperatures and densities that exceed the limits\nwherein hadrons can exist as individual entities and raises to prominence the\nquark-gluon degrees of freedom. These findings are supported by major\nexperimental observations via measuring of the bulk properties of particle\nproduction, particle ratios and chemical freeze-out conditions, and elliptic\nflow; followed by hard probe measurements. The results reveal that a dense,\nstrongly-interacting medium is created in central Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV\nat RHIC. This revelation of a new state of nuclear matter has also been\nobserved in measurements at the LHC. Further, the IP-Glasma model coupled with\nviscous hydrodynamic models, which assumes the formation of a QGP, reproduces\nwell the experimental flow results from Au+Au at 200 GeV. This implies that the\nfluctuations in the initial geometry state are important and the created medium\nbehaves as a nearly perfect liquid of nuclear matter because it has an\nextraordinarily low ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. However, these\ndiscoveries are far from being fully understood. Furthermore, recent\nexperimental results from RHIC and LHC in small p+A, d+Au and He+A collision\nsystems provide brand new insight into the role of initial and final state\neffects. These have proven to be interesting and more surprising than\noriginally anticipated; and could conceivably shed new light in our\nunderstanding of collective behavior in heavy-ion physics. Accordingly, the\nfocus of the experiments at both facilities RHIC and the LHC is on detailed\nexploration of the properties of this new state of nuclear matter, the QGP.\n", "  We compare the properties of stellar populations of model galaxies from the\nCosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project with the exiting UV and IR\ndata. Since CROC simulations do not follow cosmic dust directly, we adopt two\nvariants of the dust-follows-metals ansatz to populate model galaxies with\ndust. Using the dust radiative transfer code Hyperion, we compute synthetic\nstellar spectra, UV continuum slopes, and IR fluxes for simulated galaxies. We\nfind that the simulation results generally match observational measurements,\nbut, perhaps, not in full detail. The differences seem to indicate that our\nadopted dust-follows-metals ansatzes are not fully sufficient. While the\ndiscrepancies with the exiting data are marginal, the future JWST data will be\nof much higher precision, rendering highly significant any tentative difference\nbetween theory and observations. It is, therefore, likely, that in order to\nfully utilize the precision of JWST observations, fully dynamical modeling of\ndust formation, evolution, and destruction may be required.\n", "  The transient processes of electron transport in nano-scale devices exhibit\nspecial phenomena that exist only in the transient regime. Besides how fast the\nsteady states are approached, one interesting aspect of transient transport\narises from its strong dependence on the initial state of the system. Here we\naddress the issue of how the symmetries embedded in the initial state interplay\nwith those of the system structure in the course of transient transports. We\nexplicitly explore the transient currents arising from various initial\noccupations in a double-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. We find\nsymmetry relations between the transient in-tunneling and out-tunneling\ndynamics for initially empty or full quantum dots when the energy levels in the\nelectrodes are symmetrically distributed with respect to the energy levels in\nthe QDs. This is true for whatever applied fluxes. We also find the flux-even\ncomponents of the currents and the flux-odd components of the currents exhibit\ndistinct cross-lead symmetric relations.\n", "  We investigate the spin dynamics of the square-lattice spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet by means of an improved mean field Schwinger boson calculation.\nBy identifying both, the long range N\\'eel and the RVB-like components of the\nground state, we propose an educated guess for the mean field triplet\nexcitation consisting on a linear combination of local and bond spin flips to\ncompute the dynamical structure factor. Our main result is that when this\ntriplet excitation is optimized in such a way that the corresponding sum rule\nis fulfilled, we recover the low and high energy spectral weight features of\nthe experimental spectrum. In particular, the anomalous spectral weight\ndepletion at $(\\pi,0)$ found in recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments\ncan be attributed to the interference of the triplet bond excitations of the\nRVB component of the ground state. We conclude that the Schwinger boson theory\nseems to be a good candidate to adequately interpret the dynamic properties of\nthe square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.\n", "  A profound problem in modern condensed matter physics is discovering and\nunderstanding the nature of the fluctuations and their coupling to fermions in\ncuprates which lead to high temperature superconductivity and the invariably\nassociated strange metal state. Here we report the quantitative determination\nof the normal and pairing self-energies, made possible by laser-based\nangle-resolved photoemission measurements with unprecedented accuracy and\nstability. Through a precise inversion procedure, both the effective\ninteractions in the attractive d-wave symmetry and the repulsive part in the\nfull symmetry are determined. The latter are nearly angle independent. Near Tc\nboth interactions are nearly independent of frequency, and have almost the same\nmagnitude, over the complete energy range of up to about 0.4 eV except for a\nlow energy feature around 50 meV present only in the repulsive part which has\nless than 10% of the total spectral weight. Well below Tc, they both change\nsimilarly by superconductivity induced features at low energies. Besides\nfinding the pairing self-energy and the attractive interactions for the first\ntime, these results expose a central paradox of the high Tc problem: how the\nsame frequency independent fluctuations can dominantly scatter at angles +-pi/2\nin the attractive channel as well as lead to angle-independent repulsive\nscattering. The experimental results are compared with the available\ntheoretical calculations based on antiferromagnetic fluctuations, Hubbard model\nand the quantum-critical fluctuations of loop-current order.\n", "  High-index surfaces of silicon with adsorbed gold can reconstruct to form\nhighly ordered linear step arrays. These steps take the form of a narrow strip\nof graphitic silicon. In some cases - specifically, for Si(553)-Au and\nSi(557)-Au - a large fraction of the silicon atoms at the exposed edge of this\nstrip are known to be spin-polarized and charge-ordered along the edge. The\nperiodicity of this charge ordering is always commensurate with the structural\nperiodicity along the step edge and hence leads to highly ordered arrays of\nlocal magnetic moments that can be regarded as \"spin chains\". Here, we\ndemonstrate theoretically as well as experimentally that the closely related\nSi(775)-Au surface has - despite its very similar overall structure - zero spin\npolarization at its step edge. Using a combination of density-functional theory\nand scanning tunneling microscopy, we propose an electron-counting model that\naccounts for these differences. The model also predicts that unintentional\ndefects and intentional dopants can create local spin moments at Si(hhk)-Au\nstep edges. We analyze in detail one of these predictions and verify it\nexperimentally. This finding opens the door to using techniques of surface\nchemistry and atom manipulation to create and control silicon spin chains.\n", "  Participatory crowd sensing social systems rely on the participation of large\nnumber of individuals. Since humans are strategic by nature, effective\nincentive mechanisms are needed to encourage participation. A popular mechanism\nto recruit individuals is through referrals and passive incentives such as\ngeometric incentive mechanisms used by the winning team in the 2009 DARPA\nNetwork Challenge and in multi level marketing schemes. The effect of such\nrecruitment schemes on the effort put in by recruited strategic individuals is\nnot clear. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Given a referral tree and the\ndirect and passive reward mechanism, we formulate a network game where agents\ncompete for finishing crowd sensing tasks. We characterize the Nash equilibrium\nefforts put in by the agents and derive closed form expressions for the same.\nWe discover free riding behavior among nodes who obtain large passive rewards.\nThis work has implications on designing effective recruitment mechanisms for\ncrowd sourced tasks. For example, usage of geometric incentive mechanisms to\nrecruit large number of individuals may not result in proportionate effort\nbecause of free riding.\n", "  Colloidal membranes are monolayer assemblies of rodlike particles that\ncapture the long-wavelength properties of lipid bilayer membranes on the\ncolloidal scale. Recent experiments on colloidal membranes formed by chiral\nrodlike viruses showed that introducing a second species of virus with\ndifferent length and opposite chirality leads to the formation of rafts ---\nmicron-sized domains of one virus species floating in a background of the other\nviruses [Sharma et al., Nature 513, 77 (2014)]. In this article we study the\ninteraction of such rafts using liquid crystal elasticity theory. By\nnumerically minimizing the director elastic free energy, we predict the tilt\nangle profile for both a single raft and two rafts in a background membrane,\nand the interaction between two rafts as a function of their separation. We\nfind that the chiral penetration depth in the background membrane sets the\nscale for the range of the interaction. We compare our results with the\nexperimental data and find good agreement for the strength and range of the\ninteraction. Unlike the experiments, however, we do not observe a complete\ncollapse of the data when rescaled by the tilt angle at the raft edge.\n", "  Functional brain imaging allows measuring dynamic functionality in all brain\nregions. It is broadly used in clinical cognitive neuroscience as, well as in\nresearch. It will allow the observation of neural activities in the brain\nsimultaneously. From the beginning when functional brain imaging was initiated\nby the mapping of brain functions proposed by phrenologists, many scientists\nwere asking why we need to image brain functionality since we have already\nstructural information. Simply, their important question was including a great\nanswer. Functional information of the human brain would definitely complement\nstructural information, helping to have a better understanding of what is\nhappening in the brain. This paper, which could be useful to those who have an\ninterest in functional brain imaging, such as engineers, will present a quick\nreview of modalities used in functional brain imaging. We will concentrate on\nthe most used techniques in functional imaging which are functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) and functional optical imaging, which is one of\nnovelties in this area of study.\n", "  We prove the occurrence of Anderson localisation for a system of infinitely\nmany particles interacting with a short range potential, within the ground\nstate Hartree-Fock approximation. We assume that the particles hop on a\ndiscrete lattice and that they are submitted to an external periodic potential\nwhich creates a gap in the non-interacting one particle Hamiltonian. We also\nassume that the interaction is weak enough to preserve a gap. We prove that the\nmean-field operator has exponentially localised eigenvectors, either on its\nwhole spectrum or at the edges of its bands, depending on the strength of the\ndisorder.\n", "  The entanglement Chern number, the Chern number for the entanglement\nHamiltonian, is used to charac- terize the Kane-Mele model, which is a typical\nmodel of the quantum spin Hall phase with the time reversal symmetry. We first\nobtain the global phase diagram of the Kane-Mele model in terms of the\nentanglement spin Chern number, which is defined by using a spin subspace as a\nsubspace to be traced out in preparing the entanglement Hamiltonian. We further\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the entanglement Chern number without the time\nreversal symmetry and spin conservation by extending the Kane-Mele model to\ninclude the Zeeman term. The numerical results confirm that the sum of the\nentanglement spin Chern number equals to the Chern number.\n", "  We investigate the preparation of a target initial state for a two-level\n(qubit) system from a system-environment equilibrium or correlated state by an\nexternal field. The system-environment equilibrium or correlated state results\nfrom the inevitable interaction of the system with its environment. An\nefficient method in an extended auxiliary Liouville space is introduced to\ndescribe the dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system in the presence\nof a strong field and an initial system-environment correlation. By using the\ntime evolutions of the population difference, the state trajectory in the Bloch\nsphere representation and the trace distance between two reduced system states\nof the open quantum system, the effect of initial system-environment\ncorrelations on the preparation of a system state is studied. We introduce an\nupper bound and a lower bound for the trace distance within our perturbation\nformalism to describe the diverse behaviors of the dynamics of the trace\ndistance between various correlated states after the system state preparation.\nThese bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the\nliterature give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the\nincrease of the trace distance and are related to the witnesses of\nnon-Markovianity and initial system-bath correlation.\n", "  We present our model of an Emergent Quantum Mechanics which can be\ncharacterized by \"realism without pre-determination\". This is illustrated by\nour analytic description and corresponding computer simulations of Bohmian-like\n\"surreal\" trajectories, which are obtained classically, i.e. without the use of\nany quantum mechanical tool such as wave functions. However, these trajectories\ndo not necessarily represent ontological paths of particles but rather mappings\nof the probability density flux in a hydrodynamical sense. Modelling emergent\nquantum mechanics in a high-low intesity double slit scenario gives rise to the\n\"quantum sweeper effect\" with a characteristic intensity pattern. This\nphenomenon should be experimentally testable via weak measurement techniques.\n", "  The recently proposed {\\em cybersecurity dynamics} approach aims to\nunderstand cybersecurity from a holistic perspective by modeling the evolution\nof the global cybersecurity state. These models describe the interactions\nbetween the various kinds of cyber defenses and the various kinds of cyber\nattacks. We study a particular kind of cybersecurity dynamics caused by the\ninteractions between preventive and reactive defenses (e.g., filtering and\nmalware detection) against push- and pull-based cyber attacks (e.g., malware\nspreading and \"drive-by download\" attacks). The dynamics was previously shown\nto be globally stable in a {\\em special} regime of the parameter universe, but\nlittle is known beyond this special regime. In this paper, we resolve an open\nproblem in this domain by proving that the dynamics is globally stable in the\n{\\em entire} parameter universe (i.e., the dynamics always converges to a\nunique equilibrium). We discuss the cybersecurity meanings and implications of\nthis theoretic result. We also prove that the dynamics converges {\\em\nexponentially} to the equilibrium except for a special parameter regime, in\nwhich case the dynamics converges {\\em polynomially}. Since it is often\ndifficult to compute the equilibrium, we propose new bounds of the equilibrium\nand numerically show that these bounds are tighter than those proposed in the\nliterature.\n", "  The nuclei that constitute a crystalline lattice, oscillate relative to each\nother with a very low energy that is not sufficient to penetrate through the\nCoulomb barriers separating them. An additional energy, which is needed to\ntunnel through the barrier and fuse, can be supplied by external\nelectromagnetic waves (X-rays or the synchrotron radiation). Exposing to the\nX-rays the solid compound LiD (lithium-deuteride) for the duration of 111\nhours, we have detected 88 events of the nuclear fusion d+Li6 ---> Be8*. Our\ntheoretical estimate agrees with what we observed. One of possible applications\nof the phenomenon we found, could be the measurements of the rates of various\nnuclear reactions (not necessarily fusion) at extremely low energies\ninaccessible in accelerator experiments.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate a fiber-integrated single photon source of\nunprecedented efficiency. This fiber single photon source is achieved by\ncoupling optically a single quantum emitter to a monomode optical fiber with a\nnew concept of ultra-broadband optical antenna. Such an optical antenna concept\nis the result of the transposition to optical frequencies of the well-known\nlow-frequency horn antenna The optical horn antenna is here shown to be capable\nof directing the radiation from the emitter toward the optical fiber and\nefficiently phase-matching the photon emission with the fiber mode. Numerical\nresults show that an optical horn antenna can funnel up to 85% of the radiation\nfrom a dipolar source within an emission cone semi-angle as small as 7 degrees\n(antenna directivity of 300). It is also shown that 50% of the emitted power\nfrom the dipolar source can be collected and coupled to an SMF-28 fiber mode\nover spectral ranges larger than 1000 nm, with a maximum energy transfer\nreaching 70 %. This approach is highly promising in the engineering of\nall-fiber \"on-demand\" single photon sources for telecommunication, quantum\noptics and sensing.\n", "  What defines an emergent quantum mechanics (EmQM)? Can new insight be\nadvanced into the nature of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between\nquantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity,\nor emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified,\nrelational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of\nemergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in\nstandard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics:\nquantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in\nthe foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory\nversus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one\nhand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and,\non the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could\nthese two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present\nwork argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical\ncontradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the\nmeasurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for\novercoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The\nconcept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a\ncommon foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successful\ninter-theory unification.\n", "  Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) exhibit many emergent phenomena ranging from\nhigh-temperature super- conductivity and giant magnetoresistance to magnetism\nand ferroelectricity. When TMOs are interfaced with each other, new\nmulti-functionalities can arise, which are absent in individual components. In\nthis work, we have systematically studied, within a unified double-exchange\nmodel, the interfacial magnetic response in layered BiFeO3 (BFO) and\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) heterostructures. The ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic\ncanting is shown to be enhanced on the interface of BFO by the influence of\nlocal charge variation. More interestingly, it is found that the spin canting\nin BFO can be further enhanced with deeper penetration depth to the bulk when a\nlocal oxygen vacancy is placed around the interface.\n", "  The concept of 'super-indeterminism' captures the notion that the free choice\nassumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following\nrequirement: an agent's free-choice performance in the selection of measurement\nsettings must not represent an exception to the rule of irreducible quantum\nindeterminism in the physical universe (i.e, \"universal indeterminism\"). Any\nadditional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,\ni.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter \"freedom\",\n\"free will\", or \"free choice\", is redundant in relation to the predictive\nsuccess of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views\nas redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a\nnegative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a\nnecessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts,\nfor example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will\ntheorem by Conway and Kochen. The concept of super-indeterminism is of great\nassistance in clarifying the often misunderstood meaning of the concept of\n\"free variables\" as used by John Bell. The present work argues that Bell sought\nan operational, effective free will theorem, one based upon the notion of\n\"determinism without predetermination\", i.e., one wherein \"free variables\"\nrepresent universally uncomputable variables. In conclusion, the standard\ninterpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer\nin order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of\nwhether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to\nfree-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents\nin quantum mechanics.\n", "  We study fully hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated graphene spin valve\ndevices at room temperature. The device consists of a graphene channel\nencapsulated between two crystalline hBN flakes; thick-hBN flake as a bottom\ngate dielectric substrate which masks the charge impurities from SiO2/Si\nsubstrate and single-layer thin-hBN flake as a tunnel barrier. Full\nencapsulation prevents the graphene from coming in contact with any\npolymer/chemical during the lithography and thus gives homogeneous charge and\nspin transport properties across different regions of the encapsulated\ngraphene. Further, even with the multiple electrodes in between the injection\nand the detection electrodes which are in conductivity mismatch regime, we\nobserve spin transport over 12.5 um long distance under the thin-hBN\nencapsulated graphene channel, demonstrating the clean interface and the\npin-hole free nature of the thin-hBN as an efficient tunnel barrier.\n", "  Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism behind the evolution of cooperation.\nOishi et al. analytically showed the formation of two exclusive groups under\nthe KANDORI assessment rule in the case of perfect information and no\nimplementation error, regardless of the population size $N$. Here, we\nnumerically show the formation of many exclusive groups under the JUDGING\nassessment rule in the same case. Introducing degrees of exclusive groups, we\nnumerically examine the stability of the group formation under imperfect\ninformation and implementation error.\n", "  We obtain the Maxwell-J\\\"uttner distribution function at first order in the\npost-Newtonian approximation within the framework of general relativity. Taking\ninto account the aforesaid distribution function, we compute the particle\nfour-flow and energy-momentum tensor. We focus on the search of static\nsolutions for the gravitational potentials with spherical symmetry. In doing\nso, we obtain the density, pressure and gravitational potential energy profiles\nin terms of dimensionless radial coordinate by solving the aforesaid equations\nnumerically. In particular, we find the parametric profile for the equation of\nstate $p/\\rho$ in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate. Due to its\nphysical relevance, we also find the galaxy rotation curves using the\npost-Newtonian approximation. We join two different kinds of static solutions\nin order to account for the linear regime near the center and the typical\nflatten behavior at large radii as well.\n", "  High-quality single crystal of Ca0.8La0.2Fe0.98Co0.02As2 has been\nsuccessfully synthesized using a self-flux method. The magnetization\nmeasurement reveals a second peak effect and high critical current density\nexceeding 2*10^6 A/cm2 at 5 K(self-field). The upper critical field anisotropy\nwas systematically studied by measuring the electrical resistivity under\nvarious magnetic fields and angles. The angle dependent magnetoresistance, by\nchoosing an appropriate anisotropy parameter within the framework of the\nanisotropic Ginzburg Landau (AGL) theory, can be scaled onto one single curve.\nIn the normal state, the negative Hall coefficient shows strong but\nnonmonotonic T-dependence through a minimum at 175 K. Moreover, it is shown\nthat the magnetoresistance apparently violates the semiclassical Kohler's rule\nbelow 175 K but can be well scaled by the Hall angle instead. This suggests\neither the change of carriers with T or the exotic anisotropic scattering in\nthe system.\n", "  The standard model is extended with three right-handed, singlet neutrinos\nwith general couplings permitted by the $SU(2)_{L}\\times U(1)$ symmetry. The\ntraditional oscillations are accounted for, as usually, by three left-handed\nneutrinos. The article investigates new structures that develop when the masses\nof the right-handed states are in the eV range. The new states interfere and\noscillate with the standard light neutrinos. New structures appear when the\ndetectors average over short wavelengths. I use these results to present and\nclassify properties of the observed anomalies in the MiniBooNe, reactor and\nGallium-detector experiments.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an initiative to build the next\ngeneration, ground-based gamma-ray observatories. We present a prototype\nworkspace developed at INAF that aims at providing innovative solutions for the\nCTA community. The workspace leverages open source technologies providing web\naccess to a set of tools widely used by the CTA community. Two different user\ninteraction models, connected to an authentication and authorization\ninfrastructure, have been implemented in this workspace. The first one is a\nworkflow management system accessed via a science gateway (based on the Liferay\nplatform) and the second one is an interactive virtual desktop environment. The\nintegrated workflow system allows to run applications used in astronomy and\nphysics researches into distributed computing infrastructures (ranging from\nclusters to grids and clouds). The interactive desktop environment allows to\nuse many software packages without any installation on local desktops\nexploiting their native graphical user interfaces. The science gateway and the\ninteractive desktop environment are connected to the authentication and\nauthorization infrastructure composed by a Shibboleth identity provider and a\nGrouper authorization solution. The Grouper released attributes are consumed by\nthe science gateway to authorize the access to specific web resources and the\nrole management mechanism in Liferay provides the attribute-role mapping.\n", "  Recent observation of some luminous transient sources with low color\ntemperatures suggests that the emission is dominated by optically thick winds\ndriven by super-Eddington accretion. We present a general analytical theory of\nthe dynamics of radiation pressure-driven, optically thick winds. Unlike the\nclassical adiabatic stellar wind solution whose dynamics are solely determined\nby the sonic radius, here the loss of the radiation pressure due to photon\ndiffusion also plays an important role. We identify two high mass loss rate\nregimes ($\\dot{M} > L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$). In the large total luminosity regime\nthe solution resembles an adiabatic wind solution. Both the radiative\nluminosity, $L$, and the kinetic luminosity, $L_k$, are super-Eddington with $L\n< L_k$ and $L \\propto L_k^{1/3}$. In the lower total luminosity regime most of\nthe energy is carried out by the radiation with $L_k < L \\approx L_{\\rm\nEdd\\,}$. In a third, low mass loss regime ($\\dot{M} < L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$), the\nwind becomes optically thin early on and, unless gas pressure is important at\nthis stage, the solution is very different from the adiabatic one. The results\nare independent from the energy generation mechanism at the foot of the wind,\ntherefore they are applicable to a wide range of mass ejection systems, from\nblack hole accretion, to planetary nebulae, and to classical novae.\n", "  We developed a highly integrated and versatile electronic module to equip\nsmall nuclear physics experiments and lab teaching classes: the User friendly\nConfigurable Trigger, scaler and delay Module for nuclear and particle physics\n(UCTM). It is configurable through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and\nprovides a large number of possible trigger conditions without any Hardware\nDescription Language (HDL) required knowledge. This new version significantly\nenhances the previous capabilities by providing two additional features: signal\ndigitization and time measurements. The design, performances and a typical\napplication are presented.\n", "  How do test bodies move in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation? We provide\nan answer to this question on the basis of a unified multipolar scheme. In\nparticular, we give the explicit equations of motion for pointlike, as well as\nspinning test bodies, thus extending the well-known general relativistic\nresults of Mathisson, Papapetrou, and Dixon to scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity. We demonstrate the validity of the equivalence principle for test\nbodies.\n", "  Previous studies indicate that more than a quarter of all white dwarf (WD)\natmospheres are polluted by remnant planetary material, with some WDs being\nobserved to accrete the mass of Pluto in 10^6 years. The short sinking\ntimescale for the pollutants indicate that the material must be frequently\nreplenished. Moons may contribute decisively to this pollution process if they\nare liberated from their parent planets during the post-main-sequence evolution\nof the planetary systems. Here, we demonstrate that gravitational scattering\nevents among planets in WD systems easily triggers moon ejection. Repeated\nclose encounters within tenths of a planetary Hill radii are highly destructive\nto even the most massive, close-in moons. Consequently, scattering increases\nboth the frequency of perturbing agents in WD systems, as well as the available\nmass of polluting material in those systems, thereby enhancing opportunities\nfor collision and fragmentation and providing more dynamical pathways for\nsmaller bodies to reach the WD. Moreover, during intense scattering, planets\nthemselves have pericenters with respect to the WD of only a fraction of an AU,\ncausing extreme Hill-sphere contraction, and the liberation of moons into\nWD-grazing orbits. Many of our results are directly applicable to exomoons\norbiting planets around main sequence stars.\n", "  We investigate the effect that the turbulent mixing strength parameter\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}$ plays on near-infrared polarimetric and sub-millimetre\ninterferometric imaging observations of transitional discs (TDs) with a gap\ncarved by a planet. We generate synthetic observations of these objects with\nALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL by combining hydrodynamical, dust evolution,\nradiative transfer and instrument models for values of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=[10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$. We find that, through a\ncombination of effects on the viscosity of the gas, the turbulent mixing and\ndust evolution processes, $\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}$ strongly affects the morphology\nof the dust distribution that can be traced with these observations. We\nconstrain the value of $\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}$ to be within an order of magnitude\nof $10^{-3}$ in TD sources that show cavities in sub-mm continuum images while\nfeaturing continuous distribution of dust or smaller cavities in\nNIR-polarimetric images.\n", "  This paper presents a coordinate free pre-metric formulation of charge free\nMaxwell-Minkowski electrodynamics, and of the developed by the authors\nnon-linear Extended Electrodynamics. First we introduce some formal relations\nfrom multilinear algebra and differential geometry to be used further. Then we\nrecall and appropriately modify the existing pre-metric formulation of linear\ncharge free electrodynamics in pre-relativistic and relativistic forms as\npreparation to turn to corresponding pre-metric nonlinearization. After some\npreliminary examples and notes on nonlinearization, we motivate our view for\nexistence and explicit formulation of time stable subsystems of the physical\nfield objects considered. Section 5 presents the formal results of our approach\non the pre-metric nonlinear formulations in static case, in time-dependent\ncase, and in space-time formulation. In the Conclusion we give our general view\non \"why and how to nonlinearize\". The Appendix gives a possible formal\nextension of our aproach to many subsystem field objects.\n", "  We consider a specific class of events of the SUSY particle production at the\nLHC without missing p_T. Namely, we discuss the chargino pair production with a\nfurther decay into the W-boson and the neutralino when the masses of the\nchargino and neutralino differ by 80-90 GeV. In this case, in the final state\none has two Ws and missing E_T but no missing P_T. The produced neutralinos are\njust boosted along Ws. For a demonstration we consider the MSSM with\nnon-universal gaugino masses. In this case, such events are quite probable in\nthe region of parameter space where the lightest chargino and neutralino are\nmostly gauginos. The excess in the W production cross-section reach about 10 %\nover the Standard Model background. We demonstrate that the LHC experiments,\nwhich presently measure the WW production cross section at the 8 % level can\nprobe chargino mass around 110 GeV within the suggested scenario, which is not\naccessible via other searches. If the precision of WW cross section measurement\nat the LHC will achieve the 3 % level, then it would probe chargino masses up\nto about 150 GeV within the no missing P_T scenario.\n", "  Asynchronous polars (APs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) that have\ndifferent WD and orbital angular velocities, unlike the rest of the known\npolars, which rotate synchronously (i.e., their WD and orbital angular\nvelocities are the same). Past nova eruptions are the predicted cause of the\nasynchronicity, in part due to the fact that one of the APs, V1500 Cyg, was\nobserved to undergo a nova eruption in 1975. We used the Southern African Large\nTelescope 10m class telescope and the MDM 2.4m Hiltner telescope to search for\nnova shells around three of the remaining four APs (V1432 Aql, BY Cam, and CD\nInd) as well as one Intermediate Polar with a high asynchronicity (EX Hya). We\nfound no evidence of nova shells in any of our images. We therefore cannot say\nthat any of the systems besides V1500 Cyg had nova eruptions, but because not\nall post-nova systems have detectable shells, we also cannot exclude the\npossibility of a nova eruption occurring in any of these systems and knocking\nthe rotation out of sync.\n", "  We present the fabrication and experimental demonstration of three\nfree-standing binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs, which are applicable for\ntelescopes with partially obscured pupils. Three masks, designed to be\ncomplementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5 micron\nthick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask.\nThe design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working\nangle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring\nmask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function.\nMask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region\n(i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source\ncomprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center\nwavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum\nchamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The\ncoronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the\ndesigns. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3 - 8 lambda/D and 8 - 12\nlambda/D was ~10^{-4} - 10^{-7} and ~10^{-7}, respectively, where lambda is the\nwavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast close to the center of\nMask-B was ~10^{-4} and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5 - 25\nlambda/D) was ~10^{-5} - 10^{-6}. The effect of tilting the masks was\ninvestigated, and found to be irrelevant at the ~10^{-7} contrast level.\nTherefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast\nfree-standing masks have the potential to enable coronagraphic imaging over a\nwide wavelength range using both ground-based and space-borne general-purpose\ntelescopes with pupil structures not specifically designed for coronagraphy.\n", "  Natural convection in a cylinder with an internally slotted annulus was\nsolved by SIMPLE algorithm, and the effects of different slotted structures on\nnonlinear characteristics of natural convection were investigated. The results\nshow that the equivalent thermal conductivity Keq increases with Rayleigh\nnumber, and reaches the maximum in the vertical orientation. Nonlinear results\nwere obtained by simulating the fluid flow at different conditions. With\nincreasing Rayleigh number, heat transfer is intensified and the state of heat\ntransfer changes from the steady to unsteady. We investigated different slotted\nstructures effects on natural convection, and analyze the corresponding\nnonlinear characteristics.\n", "  The decreasing of groundwater quality has been the major issue in Tangerang\narea. One of the key process is the interaction between groundwater and\nCisadane river water, which flows over volcanic deposits of Bojongmanik Fm,\nGenteng Fm, Tuf Banten, and Alluvial Fan. The objective of this study is to\nunravel such interactions based on the potentiometric mapping in the riverbank.\nWe had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level\nobservations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river\nwater gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations.\n  We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow\ngradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25\ngradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient\n0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with\ngradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low\nmorphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also\nsupported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased\nmore than 40$\\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both\nmeasurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the\ndrops of pH values at those areas.\n  This study shows the very close interaction between Cisadane river water and\ngroundwater in the riverbank. Therefore the authorities need to be managed the\nareas with a very strict regulations related to the small and large scale\nindustries located near by the river.\n", "  It is well known that the spin Hall effect of light (SHEL) can be easily\nobserved via weak measurement by the dark strip resulted from the splitting of\ndifferent polarization components. We find that the SHEL of partially coherent\nbeam (PCB) also has similar phenomenon. However, the existence of the dark\nstrip in the SHEL of PCB can not be properly justified by considering the beam\nas a statistical assemble of coherent speckles. Also, the dark strip of PCB is\nnot purely dark. By analyzing the autocorrelation of the central dark strip\npart of the SHEL of PCB, we show that SHEL of PCB is essentially the direct\nresult of overlapping coherent speckles' SHEL. Then we further prove our\nconclusion by adjusting the converging level and the incident angle of the\nbeam. Finally, we develop a qualitative theory by taking the intensity\ndistribution of PCB into account, to fully clarify the SHEL of PCB. The\nfeasibility of our theory to Goos-H\\\"anchen (GH) scenario is also demonstrated.\n", "  Some models of the expanding Universe predict that the astrometric proper\nmotion of distant radio sources embedded in space-time are non-zero as the\nradial distance from observer to the source grows. Systematic proper motion\neffects would produce a predictable quadrupole pattern on the sky that could be\ndetected using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique. This\nquadrupole pattern can be interpreted either as an anisotropic Hubble\nexpansion, or as a signature of the primordial gravitational waves in the early\nUniverse. We present our analysis of a large set of geodetic VLBI data spanning\n1979--2015 to estimate the dipole and quadrupole harmonics in the expansion of\nthe vector field of the proper motions of quasars in the sky. The analysis is\nrepeated for different redshift zones.\n", "  There is currently no evidence for life on any known exoplanet. Here, we\npropose a form of \"galactic anthropology\" to detect not only the existence of\nlife on transiting exoplanets, but also the existence of environmentalism\nmovements. By observing the planet's atmosphere over long time baselines, the\ndestruction and recovery of a hole in an exoplanet's ozone layer may be\nobservable. While not readily detectable for any one system with JWST, by\nbinning together observations of hundreds of systems we can finally determine\nthe occurrence rate of environmental movements on Earthlike planets in the\ngalaxy, a number we term eta-Green-Earth.\n", "  The Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) is a 100-night spectroscopic survey\nunderway on the Anglo-Australian Telescope using the fibre-fed 2-degree-field\n(2dF) spectrograph. We have developed a new redshifting application Marz with\ngreater usability, flexibility, and the capacity to analyse a wider range of\nobject types than the Runz software package previously used for redshifting\nspectra from 2dF. Marz is an open-source, client-based, Javascript\nweb-application which provides an intuitive interface and powerful automatic\nmatching capabilities on spectra generated from the AAOmega spectrograph to\nproduce high quality spectroscopic redshift measurements. The software can be\nrun interactively or via the command line, and is easily adaptable to other\ninstruments and pipelines if conforming to the current FITS file standard is\nnot possible. Behind the scenes, a modified version of the Autoz\ncross-correlation algorithm is used to match input spectra against a variety of\nstellar and galaxy templates, and automatic matching performance for OzDES\nspectra has increased from 54% (Runz) to 91% (Marz). Spectra not matched\ncorrectly by the automatic algorithm can be easily redshifted manually by\ncycling automatic results, manual template comparison, or marking spectral\nfeatures.\n", "  Online social networking services allow their users to post content in the\nform of text, images or videos. The main mechanism driving content diffusion is\nthe possibility for users to re-share the content posted by their social\nconnections, which may then cascade across the system. A fundamental problem\nwhen studying information cascades is the possibility to develop sound\nmathematical models, whose parameters can be calibrated on empirical data, in\norder to predict the future course of a cascade after a window of observation.\nIn this paper, we focus on Twitter and, in particular, on the temporal patterns\nof retweet activity for an original tweet. We model the system by\nTime-Dependent Hawkes process (TiDeH), which properly takes into account the\ncircadian nature of the users and the aging of information. The input of the\nprediction model are observed retweet times and structural information about\nthe underlying social network. We develop a procedure for parameter\noptimization and for predicting the future profiles of retweet activity at\ndifferent time resolutions. We validate our methodology on a large corpus of\nTwitter data and demonstrate its systematic improvement over existing\napproaches in all the time regimes.\n", "  In this expository paper we give an overview of some statistical methods for\nthe monitoring of social networks. We discuss the advantages and limitations of\nvarious methods as well as some relevant issues. One of our primary\ncontributions is to give the relationships between network monitoring methods\nand monitoring methods in engineering statistics and public health\nsurveillance. We encourage researchers in the industrial process monitoring\narea to work on developing and comparing the performance of social network\nmonitoring methods. We also discuss some of the issues in social network\nmonitoring and give a number of research ideas.\n", "  A class of solutions, decaying as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$, of a two-dimensional\nmodel problem on the oscillations of an ideal rotating fluid in some domains\nwith angular points is constructed explicitly. The existence of solutions whose\n$L_2$-norms decrease more rapidly than any negative power of $t$, is\nestablished.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the kinetic and the exchange energy densities\nnear the nuclear cusp of atomic systems. Considering hydrogenic orbitals, we\nderive analytical expressions near the nucleus, for single shells, as well as\nin the semiclassical limit of large non-relativistic neutral atoms. We show\nthat a model based on the helium iso-electronic series is very accurate, as\nalso confirmed by numerical calculations on real atoms up to two thousands\nelectrons. Based on this model, we propose non-local density-dependent\ningredients that are suitable for the description of the kinetic and exchange\nenergy densities in the region close to the nucleus. These non-local\ningredients are invariant under the uniform scaling of the density, and they\ncan be used in the construction of non-local exchange-correlation and kinetic\nfunctionals.\n", "  The R\\'enyi entropies $R_{p}[\\rho], 0<p<\\infty$ of the probability density\n$\\rho_{n,l,m}(\\vec{r})$ of a physical system completely characterize the\nchemical and physical properties of the quantum state described by the three\ninteger quantum numbers $(n,l,m)$. The analytical determination of these\nquantities is practically impossible up until now, even for the very few\nsystems where their Schr\\\"odinger equation is exactly solved. In this work, the\nR\\'enyi entropies of Rydberg (highly-excited) hydrogenic states are explicitly\ncalculated in terms of the quantum numbers and the parameter $p$. To do that we\nuse a methodology which first connects these quantities to the\n$\\mathcal{L}_{p}$-norms $N_{n,l}(p)$ of the Laguerre polynomials which\ncharacterize the state's wavefunction. Then, the R\\'enyi, Shannon and Tsallis\nentropies of the Rydberg states are determined by calculating the asymptotics\n($n\\rightarrow\\infty$) of these Laguerre norms. Finally, these quantities are\nnumerically examined in terms of the quantum numbers and the nuclear charge.\n", "  The last two decades have seen the number of known exoplanets increase from a\nsmall handful to nearly 2000 known exoplanets, thousands more planet\ncandidates, and several upcoming missions that are expected to further increase\nthe population of known exoplanets. Beyond the strictly scientific questions\nthat this has led to regarding planet formation and frequency, this has also\nled to broader questions such as the philosophical implications of life\nelsewhere in the universe and the future of human civilization and space\nexploration. One additional realm that hasn't been adequately considered,\nhowever, is that this large increase in exoplanets would also impact claims\nregarding astrology. In this paper we look at the distribution of planets\nacross the sky and along the Ecliptic, as well as the current and future\nimplications of this planet distribution.\n", "  We have studied the emergence of classical states in the perturbative\ninteraction model. The states which interact with many other degrees of\nfreedom, such as the center of mass of a macro-object, play important role.\nAlthough the random phase mechanism is effective as same as Zurek's strong\ncorrelation model, there are enormous states, each of which independently\ndevelopes due to the orthogonality of the environmental states. In these\nprivileged states, the subsystem picture with the separability is stable.\n", "  We explore the role of dynamics in shaping planetary system multiplicities,\nfocussing on two particular problems. (1) We propose that the lack of close-in\nsuper-Earths in hot Jupiter systems is a signature of the migration history of\nthe hot Jupiters and helps to discriminate between different mechanisms of\nmigration. We present N-body simulations of dynamical migration scenarios where\nproto-hot Jupiters are excited to high eccentricities prior to tidal\ncircularisation and orbital decay. We show that in this scenario, the eccentric\ngiant planet typically destroys planets in the inner system, in agreement with\nthe observed lack of close super-Earth companions to hot Jupiters. (2) We\nexplore the role of the dynamics of outer systems in affecting the\nmultiplicities of close-in systems such as those discovered by Kepler. We\nconsider specifically the effects of planet--planet scattering and Kozai\nperturbations on an exterior giant planet on the architecture of the inner\nsystem, and evaluate the ability of such scenarios to reduce the inner system's\nmultiplicity and contribute to the observed excess of single Kepler planets.\n", "  GaAs-type quantum wells (QWs) with p-type valence band embedded into the\nresonators. The Landau quantization of the electrons and heavy-holes (hh) was\ninvestigated taking into account the Rashba spin-orbit coupling with\nthird-order chirality terms for hh and with nonparabolicity terms in their\ndispersion low including the Zeeman splitting (ZS) effects. The exact solutions\nfor the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies were obtained using the Rashba method\n[1]. We derive in the second quantization representation the Hamiltonians\ndescribing the Coulomb electron-electron and the electron-radiation\ninteractions and determine the magnetoexciton energy branches and the\nmagnetoexciton-photon interaction. The fifth order dispersion equation\ndescribing the energy spectrum of the cavity magnetoexciton-polariton is\ninvestigated. It takes into account the interaction of the cavity photons with\ntwo dipole-active and with two quadrupole-active 2D magnetoexciton energy\nbranches. The cavity photons have the circular polarizations oriented along\ntheir wave vectors, which has the quantized longitudinal component. The\nselection rules of the exciton-photon interaction is expressed through the\nscalar products of the two-types circular polarizations and it is related with\nthe numbers of the LQ levels of electrons and heavy-holes. It is shown that the\nRabi frequency of the polariton branches and the magnetoexciton oscillator\nstrength increase in dependence on the magnetic field strength. The optical\ngyrotropy effects may be revealed if changing the sign of the photon circular\npolarization at a given sign of the wave vector longitudinal projection or\nequivalently changing the sign of the longitudinal projection at the same\nselected light circular polarization.\n", "  The flow of a matter, accreting onto a magnetized neutron star, is\naccompanied by an electric current. The closing of the electric current occurs\nin the crust of a neutron stars in the polar region across the magnetic field.\nBut the conductivity of the crust along the magnetic field greatly exceeds the\nconductivity across the field, so the current penetrates deep into the crust\ndown up to the super conducting core. The magnetic field, generated by the\naccretion current, increases greatly with the depth of penetration due to the\nHall conductivity of the crust is also much larger than the transverse\nconductivity. As a result, the current begins to flow mainly in the toroidal\ndirection, creating a strong longitudinal magnetic field, far exceeding an\ninitial dipole field. This field exists only in the narrow polar tube of $r$\nwidth, narrowing with the depth, i.e. with increasing of the crust density\n$\\rho$, $r\\propto \\rho^{-1/4}$. Accordingly, the magnetic field $B$ in the tube\nincreases with the depth, $B\\propto \\rho^{1/2}$, and reaches the value of about\n$10^{17}$ Gauss in the core. It destroys super conducting vortices in the core\nof a star in the narrow region of the size of the order of ten centimeters.\nBecause of generated density gradient of vortices they constantly flow into\nthis dead zone and the number of vortices decreases, the magnetic field of a\nstar decreases as well. The attenuation of the magnetic field is exponential,\n$B=B_0(1+t/\\tau)^{-1}$. The characteristic time of decreasing of the magnetic\nfield $\\tau$ is equal to $\\tau\\simeq 10^3$ years. Thus, the magnetic field of\naccreted neutron stars decreases to values of $10^8 - 10^9$ Gauss during\n$10^7-10^6$ years.\n", "  Despite its great technological importance, the magnetoelectric (ME)\ncouplings in \\BF are barely understood. By using a first-principles approach,\nwe uncover the {\\it dynamic} ME couplings of the long-range spin-cycloid in\nBiFeO$_3$. Based on a microscopic Hamiltonian, our first-principles approach\ndisentangles the hidden ME couplings due to spin-current and\nexchange-striction. Beyond the spin-current polarization governed by the\ninverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction \\cite{iDM}, various spin-current\npolarizations derived from both ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive\ndistortions cooperatively produce the strong non-reciprocal directional\ndichroism or the asymmetry in the absorption of counter-propagating light in\nBiFeO$_3$. Our systematic approach can be generally applied to any multiferroic\nmaterial, laying the foundation for revealing hidden ME couplings on an atomic\nscale and for exploiting optical ME effects in the next generation of\ntechnological devices such as optical diodes.\n", "  In this paper, based on the previous work [B. Shi, Z. Guo, Lattice Boltzmann\nmodel for nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, Phys. Rev. E 79 (2009)\n016701], we develop a general multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann\nmodel for nonlinear anisotropic convection-diffusion equation (NACDE), and show\nthat the NACDE can be recovered correctly from the present model through the\nChapman-Enskog analysis. We then test the MRT model through some classic CDEs,\nand find that the numerical results are in good agreement with analytical\nsolutions or some available results. Besides, the numerical results also show\nthat similar to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) lattice Boltzmann model or\nso-called BGK model, the present MRT model also has a second-order convergence\nrate in space. Finally, we also perform a comparative study on the accuracy and\nstability of the MRT model and BGK model by using two examples. In terms of the\naccuracy, both the theoretical analysis and numerical results show that a\n\\emph{numerical} slip on the boundary would be caused in the BGK model, and\ncannot be eliminated unless the relaxation parameter is fixed to be a special\nvalue, while the \\emph{numerical} slip in the MRT model can be overcome once\nthe relaxation parameters satisfy some constrains. The results in terms of\nstability also demonstrate that the MRT model could be more stable than the BGK\nmodel through tuning the free relaxation parameters.\n", "  Stone-Wales (SW) defects are favorably existed in graphenelike materials with\nhoneycomb lattice structure and potentially employed to change the electronic\nproperties in band engineering. In this paper, we investigate structural and\nelectronic properties of SW defects in bulk silicene and its nanoribbons as a\nfunction of their concentration using the methods of periodic boundary\nconditions with first-principles calculations. We first calculate the formation\nenergy, structural properties, and electronic band structures of SW defects in\nbulk silicene, with dependence on the concentration of SW defects. Our results\nshow a good agreement with available values from the previous first-principles\ncalculations. The energetics, structural aspects, and electronic properties of\nSW defects with dependence on defect concentration and location in\nedge-hydrogenated zigzag silicene nanoribbons are obtained. For all calculated\nconcentrations, the SW defects prefer to locate at the edge due to the lower\nformation energy. The SW defects at the center of silicene nanoribbons slightly\ninfluence on the electronic properties, whereas the SW defects at the edge of\nsilicene nanoribbons split the degenerate edge states and induce a sizable gap,\nwhich depends on the concentration of defects. It is worth to find that the SW\ndefects produce a perturbation repulsive potential, which leads the decomposed\ncharge of edge states at the side with defect to transfer to the other side\nwithout defect.\n", "  In a 2008 Letter, Wedekind et al. discussed the influence of an inert carrier\ngas on the vapor-liquid nucleation rate. They found an additional\n\"pressure-volume work\" that is performed against the carrier gas, and also\nquantified the nonisothermal effects arising from the carrier gas. We argue\nthat the pressure-volume work term represents the influence of the carrier gas\non phase equilibrium itself. This term will not appear explicitly when a\ndefinition of the supersaturation is used that is appropriate for high-pressure\nnucleation.\n", "  Seasonality is one of the oldest and most elucidation-resistant issues in\nsuicide epidemiological research. Despite winter depression (also known as\nSeasonal Affective Disorder, SAD) is known and treated since many years,\nworldwide cross-sectional data from 28 countries show a lower frequency of\nsuicide attempts around the equinoxes and a higher frequency in spring (both in\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere). This peak is not compatible with the SAD\nexplanation. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new\nresults, which provide new perspectives on the matter. In fact, the discovery\nof a new pathology called Post-Series Depression (PSD) could provide an\nexplanation of the suicide attempts pattern. The aim of this study is to\nanalyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.\nSince medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in\norder to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's\nAnatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most\nviewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that\nit can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. A full season of\nthe series is split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the\ncalendar year, and it runs from September through May. Data analysis was made\nin order to prove the correlation between PSD and the increase of suicide\nattempts. Surprisingly, the data analysis shows that the increase of rate of\nsuicide attempts does not coincide with the breaks in Grey's Anatomy\nscheduling, but with the series broadcasting. This therefore suggests that it\nis the series itself to increase the viewer's depression.\n", "  The behavior of the average velocity, its deviation and average squared\nvelocity are characterized using three techniques for a 1-D dissipative impact\nsystem. The system -- a particle, or an ensemble of non interacting particles,\nmoving in a constant gravitation field and colliding with a varying platform --\nis described by a nonlinear mapping. The average squared velocity allows to\ndescribe the temperature for an ensemble of particles as a function of the\nparameters using: (i) straightforward numerical simulations; (ii) analytically\nfrom the dynamical equations; (iii) using the probability distribution\nfunction. Comparing analytical and numerical results for the three techniques,\none can check the robustness of the developed formalism, where we are able to\nestimate numerical values for the statistical variables, without doing\nextensive numerical simulations. Also, extension to other dynamical systems is\nimmediate, including time dependent billiards.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging two dimensional material for\nquantum photonics owing to its large bandgap and hyperbolic properties. Here we\nreport a broad range of multicolor room temperature single photon emissions\nacross the visible and the near infrared spectral ranges from point defects in\nhBN multilayers. We show that the emitters can be categorized into two general\ngroups, but most likely possess similar crystallographic structure. We further\nshow two approaches for engineering of the emitters using either electron beam\nirradiation or annealing, and characterize their photophysical properties. The\nemitters exhibit narrow line widths of sub 10 nm at room temperature, and a\nshort excited state lifetime with high brightness. Remarkably, the emitters are\nextremely robust and withstand aggressive annealing treatments in oxidizing and\nreducing environments. Our results constitute the first step towards\ndeterministic engineering of single emitters in 2D materials and hold great\npromise for the use of defects in boron nitride as sources for quantum\ninformation processing and nanophotonics.\n", "  The mathematical - numerical analysis of a discrete dynamical model with two\nindependent delays was performed. Such model may describe a continuous system\nwith delays that have real rational number values. Applicable characteristic\nequations were derived for both a single and double cycle. The results of the\nanalysis were illustrated by numerical examples in the form of boundary\nbifurcation curves and Feigenbaums diagrams.\n", "  Hard-soft bilayers are analogous to prototype exchange-biased ferromagnetic\n-antiferromagnetic systems as the minor loop of the soft layer is biased by the\nhard and furthermore they offer bias layer tunability. In sputtered CoPt/Co\nhard-soft bilayers we demonstrate that the exchange bias field shows a linear\ndependence on the hard layer magnetization, while the coercivity shows a\nquadratic dependence. Analysis of the minor hysteresis loop features supported\nby Monte-Carlo simulations provide clear evidence that the coercivity of the\nsoft layer is mainly determined by the tunable randomness of the domain state\nof the hard layer.\n", "  Fedosov has described a geometro-algebraic method to construct in a canonical\nway a deformation of the Poisson algebra associated with a finite-dimensional\nsymplectic manifold (\"phase space\"). His algorithm gives a non-commutative, but\nassociative, product (a so-called \"star-product\") between smooth phase space\nfunctions parameterized by Planck's constant $\\hbar$, which is treated as a\ndeformation parameter. In the limit as $\\hbar$ goes to zero, the star product\ncommutator goes to $\\hbar$ times the Poisson bracket, so in this sense his\nmethod provides a quantization of the algebra of classical observables. In this\nwork, we develop a generalization of Fedosov's method which applies to the\ninfinite-dimensional symplectic \"manifolds\" that occur in Lagrangian field\ntheories. We show that the procedure remains mathematically well-defined, and\nwe explain the relationship of this method to more standard perturbative\nquantization schemes in quantum field theory.\n", "  $\\Lambda^+_c$ hypernuclei are expected to have binding energies and other\nproperties similar to those of strange hypernuclei in view of the similarity\nbetween the quark structures of the strange and charmed hyperons, namely\n$\\Lambda(uds)$ and $\\Lambda^+_c (udc)$. One striking difference however occurs\nin their mesonic decays, as there is almost no Pauli blocking in the nucleonic\ndecay of a charm hypernucleus because the final-state nucleons leave the\nnucleus at high energies. The nuclear medium nevertheless affects the mesonic\ndecays of charm hypernucleus because the nuclear mean fields modify the masses\nof the charm hyperon. In the present communication we present results of a\nfirst investigation of the effects of finite baryon density on different weak\nmesonic decay channels of the $\\Lambda^+_c$ baryon. We found a non-negligible\nreduction of the decay widths as compared to their vacuum values.\n", "  We study a self-adjoint realization of a massless Dirac operator on a bounded\nconnected domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ which is frequently used to model\ngraphene quantum dots. In particular, we show that this operator is the limit,\nas $M\\to \\infty$, of a Dirac operator defined on the whole plane, with a mass\nterm of size $M$ supported outside $\\Omega$.\n", "  We consider an operatorial model of alliances between three political parties\nwhich interact with their electors, with the undecided voters, and with the\nelectors of the other parties. This extends what was done in a previous paper,\nwhere this last type of interactions was not considered. Of course, taking them\ninto account makes the system closer to real life. To produce an exactly\nsolvable model, we restrict here to quadratic Hamiltonians, so that the\nequations of motion turn out to be linear. The dynamics of the so-called {\\em\ndecision functions} are deduced, and some explicit situations are considered in\ndetails.\n", "  The dynamics of two coupled generators of quasiperiodic oscillations is\nstudied. The opportunity of complete and phase synchronization of generators in\nthe regime of quasiperiodic oscillations is obtained. The features of structure\nof parameter plane is researched using charts of dynamical regimes and charts\nof Lyapunov exponents, in which typical structures as resonance Arnold web were\nrevealed. The possible quasiperiodic bifurctions in the system are discussed.\n", "  We study Friedmann inflation in general Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity with\ndetailed and non-detailed but also without the projectability conditions.\nAccordingly, we derive the modifications in the Friedmann equations due to\nsingle scalar field potentials describing power-law and\nminimal-supersymmetrically extended inflation. By implementing four types of\nthe equations-of-state charactering the cosmic background geometry, the\ndependence of the tensorial and spectral density fluctuations and their ratio\non the inflation field is determined. The latter characterizes the time\nevolution of the inflation field relative to the Hubble parameter. Furthermore,\nthe ratio of tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuations is calculated in\ndependence on the spectral index. The resulting slow-roll parameters apparently\ndiffer from the ones deduced from the standard General Relativity (Friedmann\ngravity). We also observe that the tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuations\ncontinuously decrease when moving from non-detailed HL gravity, to Friedmann\ngravity, to HL gravity without the projectibility, and to detailed HL gravity.\nThis regular patter is valid for three types of cosmic equations-of-state and\ndifferent inflation potential models. The results fit well with the recent\nPLANCK observations.\n", "  We investigate the spin-1/2 relativistic quantum dynamics in the curved\nspace-time generated by a central massive charged object (black hole). This\nnecessitates a study of the coupling of a Dirac particle to the\nReissner-Nordstrom space-time geometry and the simultaneous covariant coupling\nto the central electrostatic field. The relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian for the\nReissner-Nordstrom geometry is derived. A Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation\nreveals the presence of gravitational, and electro-gravitational spin-orbit\ncoupling terms which generalize the Fokker precession terms found for the\nDirac-Schwarzschild Hamiltonian, and other electro-gravitational correction\nterms to the potential proportional to alpha^n G, where alpha is the\nfine-structure constant, and G is the gravitational coupling constant. The\nparticle-antiparticle symmetry found for the Dirac-Schwarzschild geometry (and\nfor other geometries which do not include electromagnetic interactions) is\nshown to be explicitly broken due to the electrostatic coupling. The resulting\nspectrum of radially symmetric, electrostatically bound systems (with\ngravitational corrections) is evaluated for example cases.\n", "  Assignment of consistent quantum probabilities to events in a quantum\nuniverse is a fundamental challenge which every quantum cosmology/gravity\nframework must overcome. In loop quantum cosmology, this issue leads to a\nfundamental question: What is the probability that the universe undergoes a\nnon-singular bounce? Using the consistent histories formulation, this question\nwas successfully answered recently by the authors for a spatially flat FRW\nmodel in the canonical approach. In this manuscript, we obtain a covariant\ngeneralization of this result. Our analysis is based on expressing loop quantum\ncosmology in the spin foam paradigm and using histories defined via volume\ntransitions to compute the amplitudes of transitions obtained using a vertex\nexpansion. We show that the probability for bounce turns out to be unity.\n", "  We present a test of General Relativity, the measurement of the Earth's\ndragging of inertial frames. Our result is obtained using about 3.5 years of\nlaser-ranged observations of the LARES, LAGEOS and LAGEOS 2 laser-ranged\nsatellites together with the Earth's gravity field model GGM05S produced by the\nspace geodesy mission GRACE. We measure $\\mu = (0.994 \\pm 0.002) \\pm 0.05$,\nwhere $\\mu$ is the Earth's dragging of inertial frames normalized to its\nGeneral Relativity value, 0.002 is the 1-sigma formal error and 0.05 is the\nestimated systematic error mainly due to the uncertainties in the Earth's\ngravity model GGM05S. Our result is in agreement with the prediction of General\nRelativity.\n", "  We present a functional model of neuronal network connectivity in which the\nsingle architectural element is the object commonly known in handicraft circles\nas a pipe cleaner. We argue that the dual nature of a neuronal circuit - that\nit be at times highly robust to external manipulation and yet sufficiently\nflexible to allow for learning and adaptation - is embodied in the pipe\ncleaner, and thus that a pipe cleaner framework serves as an instructive\nscaffold in which to examine network dynamics. Regarding the dynamics\nthemselves: as pipe cleaners possess no intrinsic dynamics, in our model we\nattribute the emergent circuit dynamics to magic. Magic is a strategy that has\nbeen largely neglected in the neuroscience community, and may serve as an\nilluminating comparison to the common physics-based approaches. This model\nmakes predictions that it would be really awesome to test experimentally.\nMoreover, the relative simplicity of the pipe cleaner - setting aside the fact\nthat it comes in an overwhelming variety of colors - renders it an excellent\ntheoretical building block with which to create simple network models. Also,\nthey are incredibly cheap when bought wholesale on Amazon.\n", "  Black holes are extreme expressions of gravity. Their existence is predicted\nby Einstein's theory of general relativity and is supported by observations.\nBlack holes obey quantum mechanics and evaporate spontaneously. Here it is\nshown that a mass rate $R_f\\sim 3\\times 10^{-8} (M_0/M)^{1/2}$ $M_0$ yr$^{-1}$\nonto the horizon of a black hole with mass $M$ (in units of solar mass $M_0$)\nstimulates a black hole into rapid evaporation. Specifically, $\\sim 3 M_0$\nblack holes can emit a large fraction of their mass, and explode, in $M/R_f\n\\sim 3\\times 10^7 (M/M_0)^{3/2}$ yr. These stimulated black holes radiate a\nspectral line power $P \\sim 2\\times 10^{39} (M_0/M)^{1/2}$ erg s$^{-1}$, at a\nwavelength $\\lambda \\sim 3\\times 10^5 (M/M_0)$ cm. This prediction can be\nobservationally verified.\n", "  We use the semi-analytic model developed by Henriques et al. (2015) to\nexplore the origin of star formation history diversity for galaxies that lie at\nthe centre of their dark matter haloes and have present-day stellar masses in\nthe range 5-8 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, similar to that of the Milky Way.\nIn this model, quenching is the dominant physical mechanism for introducing\nscatter in the growth histories of these galaxies. We find that present-day\nquiescent galaxies have a larger variety of growth histories than star-formers\nsince they underwent 'staggered quenching' - a term describing the correlation\nbetween the time of quenching and present-day halo mass. While halo mass\ncorrelates broadly with quiescence, we find that quiescence is primarily a\nfunction of black hole mass, where galaxies quench when heating from their\nactive galactic nuclei becomes sufficient to offset the redshift-dependent\ncooling rate. In this model, the emergence of a prominent quiescent population\nis the main process that flattens the stellar mass-halo mass relation at mass\nscales at or above that of the Milky Way.\n"]}
