potentials with variable atom-atom s-wave scattering length, are\nperformed using the correlated Gaussian approach. In addition, microscopic 1D\ncalculations are performed for effective \"atomic\" and \"molecular\" 1D model\nHamiltonian. Comparisons of the 3D and 1D energies and excitation frequencies\nestablish the validity regimes of the effective 1D Hamiltonian. Our numerical\nresults for three- and four-particle systems suggest that the effective 1D\natom-dimer and dimer-dimer interactions are to a good approximation determined\nby simple analytical expressions. Implications for the description of quasi-1D\nFermi gases within strict 1D frameworks are discussed.\n", "  Kepler's orbits with corrections due to Special Relativity are explored using\nthe Lagrangian formalism. A very simple model includes only relativistic\nkinetic energy by defining a Lagrangian that is consistent with both the\nrelativistic momentum of Special Relativity and Newtonian gravity. The\ncorresponding equations of motion are solved in a Keplerian limit, resulting in\nan approximate relativistic orbit equation that has the same form as that\nderived from General Relativity in the same limit and clearly describes three\ncharacteristics of relativistic Keplerian orbits: precession of perihelion;\nreduced radius of circular orbit; and increased eccentricity. The prediction\nfor the rate of precession of perihelion is in agreement with established\ncalculations using only Special Relativity. All three characteristics are\nqualitatively correct, though suppressed when compared to more accurate\ngeneral-relativistic calculations. This model is improved upon by including\nrelativistic gravitational potential energy. The resulting approximate\nrelativistic orbit equation has the same form and symmetry as that derived\nusing the very simple model, and more accurately describes characteristics of\nrelativistic orbits. For example, the prediction for the rate of precession of\nperihelion of Mercury is one-third that derived from General Relativity. These\nLagrangian formulations of the special-relativistic Kepler problem are\nequivalent to the familiar vector calculus formulations. In this Keplerian\nlimit, these models are supposed to be physical based on the likeness of the\nequations of motion to those derived using General Relativity. The derivation\nof this orbit equation is approachable by undergraduate physics majors and\nnonspecialists whom have not had a course dedicated to relativity.\n", "  We present visual calculations in special relativity using spacetime diagrams\ndrawn on graph paper that has been rotated by 45 degrees. The rotated lines\nrepresent lightlike directions in Minkowski spacetime, and the boxes in the\ngrid (called \"light-clock diamonds\") represent units of measurement modeled on\nthe ticks of an inertial observer's lightclock. We show that many quantitative\nresults can be read off a spacetime diagram by counting boxes, using a minimal\namount of algebra. We use the Doppler Effect, in the spirit of the Bondi\nk-calculus, to motivate the method.\n", "  According to Huygens' superposition principle, light beams traveling in a\nlinear medium will pass though one another without mutual disturbance. Indeed,\nit is widely held that controlling light signals with light requires intense\nlaser fields to facilitate beam interactions in nonlinear media, where the\nsuperposition principle can be broken. We demonstrate here that two coherent\nbeams of light of arbitrarily low intensity can interact on a metamaterial\nlayer of nanoscale thickness in such a way that one beam modulates the\nintensity of the other. We show that the interference of beams can eliminate\nthe plasmonic Joule losses of light energy in the metamaterial or, in contrast,\ncan lead to almost total absorbtion of light. Applications of this phenomenon\nmay lie in ultrafast all-optical pulse-recovery devices, coherence filters and\nTHz-bandwidth light-by-light modulators.\n", "  We survey results that have been obtained for self-adjoint operators, and\nespecially Schr\\\"odinger operators, associated with mathematical models of\nquasicrystals. After presenting general results that hold in arbitrary\ndimensions, we focus our attention on the one-dimensional case, and in\nparticular on several key examples. The most prominent of these is the\nFibonacci Hamiltonian, for which much is known by now and to which an entire\nsection is devoted here. Other examples that are discussed in detail are given\nby the more general class of Schr\\\"odinger operators with Sturmian potentials.\nWe put some emphasis on the methods that have been introduced quite recently in\nthe study of these operators, many of them coming from hyperbolic dynamics. We\nconclude with a multitude of numerical calculations that illustrate the\nvalidity of the known rigorous results and suggest conjectures for further\nexploration.\n", "  We consider the KdV equation $$ \\partial_t u +\\partial^3_x u +u\\partial_x u=0\n$$ with quasi-periodic initial data whose Fourier coefficients decay\nexponentially and prove existence and uniqueness, in the class of functions\nwhich have an expansion with exponentially decaying Fourier coefficients, of a\nsolution on a small interval of time, the length of which depends on the given\ndata and the frequency vector involved. For a Diophantine frequency vector and\nfor small quasi-periodic data (i.e., when the Fourier coefficients obey $|c(m)|\n\\le \\varepsilon \\exp(-\\kappa_0 |m|)$ with $\\varepsilon > 0$ sufficiently small,\ndepending on $\\kappa_0 > 0$ and the frequency vector), we prove global\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution. The latter result relies on our\nrecent work \\cite{DG} on the inverse spectral problem for the quasi-periodic\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  We, in this paper, analyze the efficacy of an output as a resource from a\nuniversal quantum cloning machine in information processing tasks such as\nteleportation and dense coding. For this, we have considered the $3\\otimes 3$\ndimensional system (or qutrit system). The output states are found to be NPT\nstates for certain ranges of machine parameters. Using the output state as an\nentangled resource, we have also studied the optimal fidelities of\nteleportation and capacities of dense coding protocols with respect to the\nmachine parameters and have made a few interesting observations. Our work is\nmainly motivated from the fact that the cloning output can be used as a\nresource in quantum information processing and adds a valuable dimension to the\napplications of cloning machines.\n", "  This article introduces mixed double Hurwitz numbers, which interpolate\ncombinatorially between the classical double Hurwitz numbers studied by\nOkounkov and the monotone double Hurwitz numbers introduced recently by\nGoulden, Guay-Paquet and Novak. Generalizing a result of Okounkov, we prove\nthat a certain generating series for the mixed double Hurwitz numbers solves\nthe 2-Toda hierarchy of partial differential equations. We also prove that the\nmixed double Hurwitz numbers are piecewise polynomial, thereby generalizing a\nresult of Goulden, Jackson and Vakil.\n", "  The existence of three generations of neutrinos(charged leptons/quarks) and\ntheir mass mixing are deep mysteries of our universe. Recently, Majorana's\nspirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of\ntopological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological\nsuperconductors(TSCs). In this paper, we attempt to investigate the topological\nnature of the neutrino by assuming that a relativistic Majorana fermion can be\ndivided into four topological Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale, e.g.\nplanck scale. We begin with an exactly solvable $1$D lattice model which\nrealizes a $T^2=-1$ time reversal symmetry protected TSC, and show that a pair\nof topological Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal\nsymmetry.Moreover, we find that a pair of topological Majorana zero modes can\nalso realize a $P^4=-1$ parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\\overline\nC^4=-1$ charge conjugation symmetry. Next, we argue that the origin of three\ngenerations of neutrinos(charged leptons and quarks) can be naturally explained\nas three distinguishable ways of forming a pair of complex fermions(with\nopposite spin polarizations) out of four topological Majorana zero modes,\ncharacterized by the $T^4=-1$, $(TP)^4=-1$ and $(T \\overline C)^4=-1$\nfractionalized symmetries that each complex fermion carries at cutoff energy\nscale. Finally, we use a semiclassical approach to compute the neutrino mass\nmixing matrix at leading order(LO), e.g., in the absence of $CP$ violation\ncorrection. We obtain $\\theta_{12}=31.7^\\circ, \\theta_{23}=45^\\circ$ and\n$\\theta_{13}=0^\\circ$(the golden ratio pattern), which is consistent with an\n$A_5$ flavor symmetry pattern. We further predict an exact mass ratio of the\nthree mass eigenstates of neutrinos with $m_1/m_3=m_2/m_3=3/\\sqrt{5}$ and an\neffective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay\n$m_{0\\nu\\beta\\beta}=m_1/\\sqrt{5}$.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of N bosons in one dimension. We assume that the\npair interaction is attractive and given by N^{\\beta -1}V(N^{\\beta}\\cdot) where\n\\int V\\leqslant 0. We develop new techniques in treating the N-body Hamiltonian\nso that we overcome the difficulties generated by the attractive interaction\nand establish new energy estimates. We also prove the optimal 1D collapsing\nestimate which reduces the regularity requirement in the uniqueness argument by\nhalf a derivative. We derive rigorously the one dimensional focusing cubic NLS\nwith a quadratic trap as the N->\\infty limit of the N-body dynamic and hence\njustify the mean-field limit and prove the propagation of chaos for the\nfocusing quantum many-body system.\n", "  We prove a formula for the global gravitational anomaly of the self-dual\nfield theory in the presence of background gauge fields, assuming the results\nof arXiv:1110.4639. Along the way, we also clarify various points about the\nself-dual field theory. In particular, we give a general definition of the\ntheta characteristic entering its partition function and settle the issue of\nits possible metric dependence. We treat the cohomological version of type IIB\nsupergravity as an example of the formalism: a mixed gauge-gravitational global\nanomaly, occurring when the B-field and Ramond-Ramond 2-form gauge fields have\nnon-trivial Wilson lines, cancels provided a certain cobordism group vanishes.\n", "  We show that the global mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the worldvolume\ntheory of the M5-brane vanishes, when the anomaly inflow from the bulk is taken\ninto account. This result extends to the type IIA and heterotic $E_8 \\times\nE_8$ five-branes. As a by-product, we provide a definition of the chiral\nfermionic fields for generic non-spin M5-brane worldvolume and determine the\ncoupling between the self-dual field and the M-theory C-field.\n", "  The topological property in one dimension (1D) is protected by symmetry.\nBased on a concrete model, we show that since a 1D topological model usually\ncontain two of the three Pauli matrix, the left one automatically become the\nprotecting symmetry. We study the effect of disorder preserving or breaking the\nsymmetry and show the nature of symmetry protecting in the 1D topological\nphase. Based on the 1D topological model, a stable quantum pumping can be\nconstructed, which is topologically nontrivial and can be characterized by the\nChern number. By calculating the instantaneous local current we show that an\ninteger charge is pumped across a periodic chain in a cyclic process. Also on\nan open chain, an edge state can be transferred to the other edge by the\nquantum pumping. Furthermore we find that not only the quantum pumping is\nstable to on-site disorder, but also can be induced by it. These results may be\nrealized experimentally using quasicrystals.\n", "  We calculate all gauge invariant Barr-Zee type contributions to fermionic\nelectric dipole moments (EDMs) in the two-Higgs doublet models (2HDM) with\nsoftly broken Z2 symmetry. We start by studying the tensor structure of h to\nVV' part in the Barr-Zee diagrams, and we calculate the effective couplings in\na gauge invariant way by using the pinch technique. Then we calculate all\nBarr-Zee diagrams relevant for electron and neutron EDMs. We make bounds on the\nparameter space in type-I, type-II, type-X, and type-Y 2HDMs. The electron and\nneutron EDMs are complementary to each other in discrimination of the 2HDMs.\nType-II and type-X 2HDMs are strongly constrained by recent ACME experiment's\nresult, and future experiments of electron and neutron EDMs may search O(10)\nTeV physics.\n", "  Wavepackets in quantum mechanics spread and the Universe in cosmology\nexpands. We discuss a formalism where the two effects can be unified. The basic\nassumption is that the Universe is determined by a unitarily evolving\nwavepacket defined on space-time. Space-time is static but the Universe is\ndynamic. Spreading analogous to expansion known from observational cosmology is\nobtained if one regards time evolution as a discrete process with probabilities\nof jumps determined by a variational principle employing\nKolmogorov-Nagumo-R\\'enyi averages. The choice of the R\\'enyi calculus implies\nthat the form of the Universe involves an implicit fractal structure. The\nformalism automatically leads to two types of \"time\" parameters: $\\tau$, with\ndimension of $x^0$, and dimensionless $\\varepsilon=\\ln \\epsilon_\\tau$, related\nto the form of diffeomorphism that defines the dynamics. There is no preferred\ntime foliation, but effectively the dynamics leads to asymptotic concentration\nof the Universe on spacelike surfaces that propagate in space-time. The\nanalysis is performed explicitly in $1+1$ dimensions, but the unitary evolution\noperator is brought to a form that makes generalizations to other dimensions\nand other fields quite natural.\n", "  Random matrices whose entries come from a stationary Gaussian process are\nstudied. The limiting behavior of the eigenvalues as the size of the matrix\ngoes to infinity is the main subject of interest in this work. It is shown that\nthe limiting spectral distribution is determined by the absolutely continuous\ncomponent of the spectral measure of the stationary process, a phenomenon\nresembling that in the situation where the entries of the matrix are i.i.d. On\nthe other hand, the discrete component contributes to the limiting behavior of\nthe eigenvalues in a completely different way. Therefore, this helps to define\na boundary between short and long range dependence of a stationary Gaussian\nprocess in the context of random matrices.\n", "  Symmetries of the initial state of a quantum system and the quantum channels,\nwhich simultaneously affect parts of the system, can significantly simplify the\ndescription of the entanglement evolution. Using concurrence as the\nentanglement measure, we study the entanglement evolution of few qubit systems,\nwhen each of the qubits is affected by a local channel independently of the\nothers. We show that, for low-rank density matrices of the final quantum state,\nsuch complex entanglement dynamics can be completely described by a combination\nof independent factors representing the evolution of entanglement of the\ninitial state, when just one of the qubits is affected by a local channel.\n", "  A new class of metastable de Sitter vacua is presented and analyzed in N =1\nsupergravity and string theory with tunable (infinitesimally small) value of\nthe cosmological constant. They are based on a gauged R-symmetry and the\nminimal spectrum contains a vector and a linear multiplet of the string dilaton\nor of a compactification modulus. In the minimum of the scalar potential\nsupersymmetry is broken by an expectation value of both a D- and F-term.\n", "  We consider products of the matrices associated with the Szeg\\H{o} recursion\nfrom the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and show that\nunder suitable assumptions, their norms grow exponentially in the number of\nfactors. In the language of dynamical systems, this result expresses a uniform\nhyperbolicity statement. We present two applications of this result. On the one\nhand, we identify explicitly the almost sure spectrum of extended CMV matrices\nwith non-negative random Verblunsky coefficients. On the other hand, we show\nthat no Ising model in one dimension exhibits a phase transition. Also, in the\ncase of dynamically generated interaction couplings, we describe a gap labeling\ntheorem for the Lee-Yang zeros in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  In this paper, the Turing instability in reaction-diffusion models defined on\ncomplex networks is studied. Here, we focus on three types of models which\ngenerate complex networks, i.e. the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz, and\nthe threshold network models. From analysis of the Laplacian matrices of graphs\ngenerated by these models, we numerically reveal that stable and unstable\nregions of a homogeneous steady state on the parameter space of two diffusion\ncoefficients completely differ, depending on the network architecture. In\naddition, we theoretically discuss the stable and unstable regions in the cases\nof regular enhanced ring lattices which include regular circles, and networks\ngenerated by the threshold network model when the number of vertices is large\nenough.\n", "  The Kotani-Last conjecture states that every ergodic operator in one space\ndimension with non-empty absolutely continuous spectrum must have almost\nperiodic coefficients. This statement makes sense in a variety of settings; for\nexample, discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators, Jacobi matrices, CMV matrices, and\ncontinuum Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n  In the main body of this paper we show how to construct counterexamples to\nthe Kotani-Last conjecture for continuum Schr\\\"odinger operators by adapting\nthe approach developed by Volberg and Yuditskii to construct counterexamples to\nthe Kotani-Last conjecture for Jacobi matrices. This approach relates the\nreflectionless operators associated with the prescribed spectrum to a family of\ncharacter-automorphic Hardy spaces and then relates the shift action on the\nspace of operators to the resulting action on the associated characters. The\nkey to our approach is an explicit correspondence between the space of\ncontinuum reflectionless Schr\\\"odinger operators associated with a given set\nand the space of reflectionless Jacobi matrices associated with a derived set.\nOnce this correspondence is established we can rely to a large extent on the\nprevious work of Volberg and Yuditskii to produce the resulting action on the\nspace of characters. We analyze this action and identify situations where we\ncan observe absolute continuity without almost periodicity.\n  In the appendix we show how to implement this strategy and obtain analogous\nresults for extended CMV matrices.\n", "  We propose and analyze a modified ghost-interference experiment, and show\nthat revealing the particle-nature of a particle passing through a double-slit\nhides the wave-nature of a spatially separated particle which it is entangled\nwith. We derive a nonlocal duality relation, ${\\mathcal D}_1^2 + {\\mathcal\nV}_2^2 \\le 1$, which connects the path distinguishability of one particle to\nthe interference visibility of the other. It extends Bohr's principle of\ncomplementarity to a nonlocal scenario. We also propose a ghost quantum eraser\nin which, erasing the which-path information of one particle brings back the\ninterference fringes of the other.\n", "  Complex problems often require coordinated group effort and can consume\nsignificant resources, yet our understanding of how teams form and succeed has\nbeen limited by a lack of large-scale, quantitative data. We analyze activity\ntraces and success levels for ~150,000 self-organized, online team projects.\nWhile larger teams tend to be more successful, workload is highly focused\nacross the team, with only a few members performing most work. We find that\nhighly successful teams are significantly more focused than average teams of\nthe same size, that their members have worked on more diverse sets of projects,\nand the members of highly successful teams are more likely to be core members\nor 'leads' of other teams. The relations between team success and size, focus\nand especially team experience cannot be explained by confounding factors such\nas team age, external contributions from non-team members, nor by group\nmechanisms such as social loafing. Taken together, these features point to\norganizational principles that may maximize the success of collaborative\nendeavors.\n", "  CuFeSb is isostructural to the ferro-pnictide and chalcogenide\nsuperconductors and it is one of the few materials in the family that are known\nto stabilize in a ferromagnetic ground state. Majority of the members of this\nfamily are either superconductors or antiferromagnets. Therefore, CuFeSb may be\nused as an ideal source of spin polarized current in spin-transport devices\ninvolving pnictide and the chalcogenide superconductors. However, for that the\nFermi surface of CuFeSb needs to be sufficiently spin polarized. In this paper\nwe report direct measurement of transport spin polarization in CuFeSb by\nspin-resolved Andreev reflection spectroscopy. From a number of measurements\nusing multiple superconducting tips we found that the intrinsic transport spin\npolarization in CuFeSb is high ($\\sim$ 47\\%). In order to understand the unique\nground state of CuFeSb and the origin of large spin polarization at the Fermi\nlevel, we have evaluated the spin-polarized band structure of CuFeSb through\nfirst principles calculations. Apart from supporting the observed 47\\%\ntransport spin polarization, such calculations also indicate that the Sb-Fe-Sb\nangles and the height of Sb from the Fe plane is strikingly different for\nCuFeSb than the equivalent parameters in other members of the same family\nthereby explaining the origin of the unique ground state of CuFeSb.\n", "  Heat has always been a killing matter for traditional semiconductor machines.\nThe underlining physical reason is that the intrinsic carrier density of a\ndevice made from a traditional semiconductor material increases very fast with\na rising temperature. Once reaching a temperature, the density surpasses the\nchemical doping or gating effect, any p-n junction or transistor made from the\nsemiconductor will fail to function. Here, we measure the intrinsic Fermi level\n(|E_F|=2.93k_B*T) or intrinsic carrier density (n_in=3.87*10^6 cm^-2 K^-2*T^2),\ncarrier drift velocity, and G mode phonon energy of graphene devices and their\ntemperature dependencies up to 2400 K. Our results show intrinsic carrier\ndensity of graphene is an order of magnitude less sensitive to temperature than\nthose of Si or Ge, and reveal the great potentials of graphene as a material\nfor high temperature devices. We also observe a linear decline of saturation\ndrift velocity with increasing temperature, and identify the temperature\ncoefficients of the intrinsic G mode phonon energy. Above knowledge is vital in\nunderstanding the physical phenomena of graphene under high power or high\ntemperature.\n", "  We investigate a magnetic hysteresis loop with a remanent moment that couples\nto electric polarization to create coupled hysteretic multiferroic behavior in\nLu2MnCoO6. Measurements of elastic neutron diffraction, muon spin relaxation,\nand micro-Hall magnetometry demonstrate an unusual mechanism for the magnetic\nhysteresis, namely the hysteretic evolution of a microscopic magnetic order,\nand not classic ferromagnetic domain effects. We show how the frustrated spin\nsystem evolves from antiferromagnetism with an incommensurate long-wavelength\nmodulation and strong fluctuations towards a net magnetism. We also clarify the\ndifferent temperature scales for the onset of ordering, dynamics, and\nhysteresis.\n", "  It is shown that the decomposition theorems of York, Stewart and Walker for\nsymmetric spatial second-rank tensors, such as the perturbed metric tensor and\nperturbed Ricci tensor, and the spatial fluid velocity vector imply that, for\nopen, flat or closed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universes, there are\nexactly two, unique, independent gauge-invariant quantities which describe the\nperturbations to the energy density and particle number density. Using these\ntwo new quantities, evolution equations for cosmological density perturbations,\nadapted to non-barotropic equations of state for the pressure, are derived. The\nnew definitions for the perturbations to the energy density and particle number\ndensity allow for an exact non-relativistic limit with a time-independent\nNewtonian potential. It is shown that density perturbations evolve\nadiabatically if and only if the particle number density does not contribute to\nthe pressure.\n", "  The problem of interacting bosons in frustrated lattices is an intricate one\ndue to the absence of a unique minimum in the single-particle dispersion where\nmacroscopic number of bosons can condense. Here we consider a family of\ntight-binding models with macroscopically degenerate lowest energy band,\nseparated from other bands by a gap. We predict the formation of exotic states\nthat spontaneously break rotational symmetry at relatively low filling. These\nstates belong to three nematic phases: Wigner crystal, supersolid, and\nsuperfluid. The Wigner crystal phase is established exactly at low filling.\nSupersolid and superfluid phases, at larger filling, are obtained by making use\nof a projection onto the flat band, construction of an appropriate Wannier\nbasis, and subsequent mean-field treatment. The nematic superfluid that we\npredict is uniform in real space but has an anisotropic momentum distribution,\nproviding a novel scenario for Bose condensation with an additional nematic\norder. Our findings open up a promising direction of studying microscopic\nquantum liquid crystalline phases of bosons.\n", "  We use cluster dynamical mean field theory to study the phase diagram of the\nsquare lattice bilayer Hubbard model with an interlayer interaction. The layers\nare populated by two-component fermions, and the densities in both layers and\nthe strength of the interactions are varied. We find that an attractive\ninterlayer interaction can induce a checkerboard density ordered phase and\nsuperfluid phases, with either interlayer or intralayer pairing. Remarkably,\nthe latter phase does not require an intralayer interaction to be present: it\ncan be attributed to an induced attractive interaction caused by density\nfluctuations in the other layer.\n", "  Although vast amounts of information are conveyed by photons in optical\nfibers, the majority of data processing is performed electronically, creating\nthe infamous 'information bottleneck' and consuming energy at an increasingly\nunsustainable rate. The potential for photonic devices to directly manipulate\nlight remains unfulfilled due largely to a lack of materials with strong, fast\noptical nonlinearities. In this paper, we show that small-signal amplifier,\nsummator and invertor functions for optical signals may be realized using a\nfour-port device that exploits the coherent interaction of beams on a planar\nplasmonic metamaterial, assuming no intrinsic nonlinearity. The redistribution\nof energy among ports can be coherently controlled at the single photon level,\nwith THz bandwidth and without introducing signal distortion, thereby\npresenting powerful opportunities for novel optical data processing\narchitectures, complexity oracles and the locally coherent networks that are\nbecoming part of the mainstream telecommunications agenda.\n", "  Dissipative forces are ubiquitous and thus constitute an essential part of\nrealistic physical theories. However, quantization of dissipation has remained\nan open challenge for nearly a century. We construct a quantum counterpart of\nclassical friction, a velocity-dependent force acting against the direction of\nmotion. In particular, a translationary invariant Lindblad equation is derived\nsatisfying the appropriate dynamical relations for the coordinate and momentum\n(i.e., the Ehrenfest equations). Numerical simulations establish that the model\napproximately equilibrates. These findings significantly advance a long search\nfor a universally valid Lindblad model of quantum friction and open\nopportunities for exploring novel dissipation phenomena.\n", "  Interfacing photonic and solid-state qubits within a hybrid quantum\narchitecture offers a promising route towards large scale distributed quantum\ncomputing. In that respect, hybrid quantum systems combining circuit QED with\nions doped into solids are an attractive platform. There, the ions serve as\ncoherent memory elements and reversible conversion elements of microwave to\noptical qubits. Among many possible spin-doped solids, erbium ions offer the\nunique opportunity of a coherent conversion of microwave photons into the\ntelecom C-band at $1.54\\,\\mu$m employed for long distance communication. In our\nwork, we perform a time-resolved electron spin resonance study of an\nEr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ spin ensemble at milli-Kelvin temperatures and\ndemonstrate multimode storage and retrieval of up to 16 coherent microwave\npulses. The memory efficiency is measured to be 10$^{-4}$ at the coherence time\nof $T_2=5.6\\,\\mu$s.\n", "  Quantum correlations between spatially separated parts of a $d$-dimensional\nbipartite system ($d\\geq 2$) have no classical analog. Such correlations, also\ncalled entanglements, are not only conceptually important, but also have a\nprofound impact on information science. In theory the violation of Bell\ninequalities based on local realistic theories for $d$-dimensional systems\nprovides evidence of quantum nonlocality. Experimental verification is required\nto confirm whether a quantum system of extremely large dimension can possess\nthis feature, however it has never been performed for large dimension (e.g.,\n$d\\geq 1000$). Here, we report that Bell inequalities are experimentally\nviolated for bipartite quantum systems of extremely high dimensionality with\nthe usual ensembles of polarization-entangled photon pairs. Our entanglement\nsource violates Bell inequalities for extremely high dimensionality of\n$d>4000$. The designed scenario offers a possible new method to investigate the\nentanglement of multipartite systems of large dimensionality and their\napplication in quantum information processing.\n", "  We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of\none-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the\nsymmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are\nallowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the\nclassification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band\nstructure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever,\nand the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary\nsymmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously\ncontracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every\nwalk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left,\nrespectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and\n-1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of\nthem already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different\nindices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so\nthe theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of\nbulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a\nsingle gap at zero.\n", "  It is well known that the kinetic exchange interaction between\nsingle-occupied magnetic orbitals (s-s) is always antiferromagnetic, while\nbetween single- and double-occupied orbitals (s-d) is always ferromagnetic and\nmuch weaker. Here we show that the exchange interaction between strongly\nanisotropic doublets of lanthanides, actinides and transition metal ions with\nunquenched orbital momentum contains a new s-d kinetic contribution equal in\nstrength with the s-s one. In non-collinear magnetic systems, this s-d kinetic\nmechanism can cause an overall ferromagnetic exchange interaction which can\nbecome very strong for transition metal ions. These findings are fully\nconfirmed by DFT based analysis of exchange interaction in several Ln$^{3+}$\ncomplexes.\n", "  We reconstruct the time dependent quantum map corresponding to the relaxation\nprocess of a two-spin system in liquid-state NMR at room temperature. By means\nof quantum tomography techniques that handle informational incomplete data, we\nshow how to properly post-process and normalize the measurements data for the\nsimulation of quantum information processing, overcoming the unknown number of\nmolecules prepared in a non-equilibrium magnetisation state ($N_j$) by an\ninitial sequence of radiofrequency (RF) pulses. From the reconstructed quantum\nmap, we infer both longitudinal ($T_1$) and transversal ($T_2$) relaxation\ntimes, and introduce the $J$-coupling relaxation times ($T^J_1,T^J_2$), which\nare relevant for quantum information processing simulations. We show that the\nmap associated to the relaxation process cannot be assumed approximated unital\nand trace-preserving for times greater than $T_2^J$.\n", "  The short range revival of an arbitrary monochromatic optical field, which\npropagates in a quadratic GRIN rod, is a well-known effect that is established\nassuming the first-order approximation of the propagation operator. We discuss\nthe revival and multiple splitting of an off-axis Gaussian beam propagating to\nrelatively long distances in a quadratic GRIN medium. These effects are\nobtained assuming the second-order approximation of the propagation operator in\nthis medium.\n", "  We theoretically analyse the possibility to electrostatically confine\nelectrons in circular quantum dot arrays, impressed on contacted graphene\nnanoribbons by top gates. Utilising exact numerical techniques, we compute the\nscattering efficiency of a single dot and demonstrate that for small-sized\nscatterers the cross-sections are dominated by quantum effects, where resonant\nscattering leads to a series of quasi-bound dot states. Calculating the\nconductance and the local density of states for quantum dot superlattices we\nshow that the resonant carrier transport through such graphene-based\nnanostructures can be easily tuned by varying the gate voltage.\n", "  A study of binary systems composed of two point particles with different\nmasses in the linear regime of the characteristic formulation of general\nrelativity in a Minkowski background is provided. The present paper generalizes\na previous study find in the literature. The boundary conditions at the world\ntubes generated by the particle's orbits are explored, when the metric\nvariables are decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics. The power lost\nby the emission of gravitational waves is computed using the News Bondi's\nfunctions. The power found is nothing but the well-known result for the power\nobtained by Peters and Mathews in a different approach. This agreement shows\nthe consistency of the approach considered here. The contribution to the\ngravitational radiation of several multipole terms is also shown.\n", "  We construct a model of quantum metrology inspired by the computational model\nknown as deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using\nonly one pure qubit together with $l$ fully-mixed qubits we obtain measurement\nprecision at the standard quantum limit, which is typically obtained using the\nsame number of uncorrelated qubits in fully-pure states. The standard quantum\nlimit can be exceeded using an additional qubit, which adds only a small amount\nof purity. We show that the discord in the final state vanishes only in the\nlimit of attaining infinite precision for the parameter being estimated.\n", "  We use the background-field method and the heat kernel to obtain all\ncounterterms to two-loop order of conformally-coupled multiflavor $\\phi^3$\ntheory in six spacetime dimensions, defined in curved spacetime and with\nspacetime-dependent couplings. We also include spacetime-dependent mass terms\nfor completeness. We use these results to write a general expression for the\ntrace anomaly. With the use of Weyl consistency conditions we are able to show\nthat the strong $a$-theorem for a certain natural candidate quantity\n$\\tilde{a}$ is violated in this theory, and obtain a three-loop expression for\nthe coefficient $a$ of the Euler term in the anomaly.\n", "  Abnormal electronic properties of complex systems require new ideas\nconcerning explanation of their behavior and possibility of realization. In\nthis acticle we show that a colossal magnetoresistance is realized in the state\nof the topological Kondo insulator, that is similar to the Kondo insulator\nstate in the Kondo lattice. The mechanism of the phenomenon is the following:\nin the spin gapless phase an external magnetic field induces the gap in the\nspectrum of spin excitations, the gap in the spectrum of fermions is opened due\nto a hybridization between spin and fermion subsystems at half filling, as the\nresult the magnetic field leads to metal-insulator (or bad metal - insulator)\nphase transition. A model of the topological Kondo lattice defined on a\nhoneycomb lattice is studied for the case when spinless fermion bands are half\nfilled. It is shown that the hybridization between local moments and itinerant\nfermions should be understood as the hybridization between corresponding\nMajorana fermions of the spin and charge sectors. The system is a topological\ninsulator, single fermion and spin excitations at low energies are massive. We\nwill show that a spin gap induces a gap in the charge channel, it leads to an\nappearance of a topological insulator state with chiral gapless edge modes and\nthe Chern number one or two depending on the exchange integrals' values. The\nrelevance of this to the traditional Kondo insulator state is discussed.\n", "  `Shape dynamics' is meant here in the sense of a type of conformogeometrical\nreformulation of GR, some of which have of late been considered as\ngeneralizations of or alternatives to GR. This note concerns in particular\ncases based on the notion of volume-preserving conformal transformations\n(VPCTs), in the sense of preserving a solitary global volume of the universe\ndegree of freedom. The extent to which various ways of modelling VPCTs make use\nof group theory at all, in a congruous manner, and with minimal departure from\nstandard Lie group theory, is considered. This points to changing conception of\nVPCTs from the current finite integral implementation to an infinitesimal\ndifferential implementation (or to avoiding using them at all). Some useful\nobservations from flat-space conformal groups (well-known from CFT) concerning\nthe existence or otherwise of VPCT groups are also provided.\n", "  Quantum metrology exploits quantum correlations to make precise measurements\nwith limited particle numbers. By utilizing inter- and intra- mode correlations\nin an optical interferometer, we find a state that combines entanglement and\nsqueezing to give a 7-fold enhancement in the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\n-- a metric related to the precision -- over the shot noise limit, for low\nphoton numbers. Motivated by practicality we then look at the squeezed\ncat-state, which has recently been made experimentally, and shows further\nprecision gains over the shot noise limit and a 3-fold improvement in the QFI\nover the optimal Gaussian state. We present a conceptually simple measurement\nscheme that saturates the QFI, and we demonstrate a robustness to loss for\nsmall photon numbers. The squeezed cat-state can therefore give a significant\nprecision enhancement in optical quantum metrology in practical and realistic\nconditions.\n", "  We introduce a theory that exposes the fundamental and previously overlooked\nconnection between the correlation among electrons and the degree of quantum\ncoherence of electronic states in matter. For arbitrary states, the effects\nonly decouple when the electronic dynamics induced by the nuclear bath is\npure-dephasing in nature such that $[H^{S},H^{SB}]=0$, where $H^{S}$ is the\nelectronic Hamiltonian and $H^{SB}$ is the electron-nuclear coupling. We\nquantitatively illustrate this connection via exact simulations of a\nHubbard-Holstein molecule using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion that show\nthat increasing the degree of electronic interactions can enhance or suppress\nthe rate of electronic coherence loss.\n", "  The finite size effects of the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ have been\nstudied in the phonon space. It is found that only a few phonon modes are\nselected to take part in the thermal transport when the size $L$ of the system\nis decreased. The amount of the selected phonon modes is proportional to the\n$L$. In this way, $\\kappa$ decreases with the decreasing of $L$. Such mechanism\nfor the size effect of $\\kappa$ found in this work is beyond the\nPhonon-Boundary scattering. The exponent $\\alpha$ of the power law $\\kappa \\sim\nL^{\\alpha}$ has been fitted, showing that the exponent is not universal.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional ring with varying electron\nfilling factor is investigated in presence of external electric field. The\nsystem is modeled within Hubbard Hamiltonian with attractive Coulomb\ncorrelation, which results in superconducting ground state when away from\nhalf-filling. The electric field is induced by applying time-dependent\nAharonov-Bohm flux in the perpendicular direction. To explore the\nnon-equilibrium phenomena arising from the field, we adopt exact\ndiagonalization and Crank-Nicolson numerical method. With increase in electric\nfield strength, the electron pairs, a signature of superconducting phase, start\nbreaking and the system enters into a metallic phase. However, the strength of\nthe electric field for this quantum phase transition depends on the electronic\ncorrelation. This phenomenon has been confirmed by flux-quantization of\ntime-dependent current and pair correlation functions\n", "  The Hubbard model underlies our understanding of strongly correlated\nmaterials. While its standard form only comprises interaction between particles\nat the same lattice site, its extension to encompass long-range interaction,\nwhich activates terms acting between different sites, is predicted to\nprofoundly alter the quantum behavior of the system. We realize the extended\nBose-Hubbard model for an ultracold gas of strongly magnetic erbium atoms in a\nthree-dimensional optical lattice. Controlling the orientation of the atomic\ndipoles, we reveal the anisotropic character of the onsite interaction and\nhopping dynamics, and their influence on the superfluid-to-Mott insulator\nquantum phase transition. Moreover, we observe nearest-neighbor interaction,\nwhich is a genuine consequence of the long-range nature of dipolar\ninteractions. Our results lay the groundwork for future studies of novel exotic\nmany-body quantum phases.\n", "  Chiral $p$-wave superconducting state supports a rich spectrum of topological\nexcitations different from those in conventional superconducting states.\nBesides domain walls separating different chiral states, chiral $p$-wave state\nsupports both singular and coreless vortices also interpreted as skyrmions.\nHere, we present a numerical study of the energetic properties of isolated\nsingular and coreless vortex states as functions of anisotropy and magnetic\nfield penetration length. In a given chiral state, single quantum vortices with\nopposite winding have different energies and thus only one kind is\nenergetically favoured. We find that with the appropriate sign of the phase\nwinding, two-quanta (coreless) vortices are always energetically preferred over\ntwo isolated single quanta (singular) vortices. We also report solutions\ncarrying more flux quanta. However those are typically more energetically\nexpensive/metastable as compared to those carrying two flux quanta.\n", "  It is known that any bipartite unitary operator of Schmidt rank three is\nequivalent to a controlled unitary under local unitaries. We propose a standard\nform of such operators. Using the form we improve the upper bound for the\nentanglement cost to implement such operators under local operations and\nclassical communications (LOCC), and provide a corresponding protocol. A part\nof our protocol is based on a recursive-control protocol which is helpful for\nimplementing other unitary operators. We show that any bipartite permutation\nunitary of Schmidt rank three can be implemented using LOCC and two ebits. We\ngive two protocols for implementing bipartite permutation unitaries of any\nSchmidt rank $r$, and showed that one of the protocol uses $O(r)$ ebits of\nentanglement and $O(r)$ bits of classical communication, while these two types\nof costs for the other protocol scale as $O(r\\log r)$ but the actual values are\nsmaller for all $r<1100$. Based on this we obtain upper bounds of the number of\nnonlocal CNOT gates needed to implement bipartite classical reversible maps\nusing classical circuits under two different conditions. We also quantify the\nentangling power of bipartite permutation unitaries of Schmidt rank two and\nthree. We show that they are respectively $1$ ebit and some value between\n$\\log_2 9 - 16/9$ and $\\log_2 3$ ebits.\n", "  We present a systematic derivation of the Biot-Savart equation from the\nNonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, in the limit when the curvature radius of\nvortex lines and the inter-vortex distance are much greater than the vortex\nhealing length, or core radius. We derive the Biot-Savart equations in\nHamiltonian form with Hamiltonian expressed in terms of vortex lines, $$ H=\n\\frac{\\kappa^2}{8 \\pi}\\int_{|{\\bf s}-{\\bf s}'|>\\xi_*} \\frac{d{\\bf s} \\cdot d\n{\\bf s}'}{|{\\bf s}-{\\bf s}'|} \\,,$$ with cut-off length $\\xi_* \\approx\n0.3416293 /\\sqrt{\\rho_0},$ where $\\rho_0$ is the background condensate density\nfar from the vortex lines and $\\kappa$ is the quantum of circulation.\n", "  We have implemented the log-conformation method for two-dimensional\nviscoelastic flow in COMSOL, a commercial high-level finite element package.\nThe code is verified for an Oldroyd-B fluid flowing past a confined cylinder.\nWe are also able to describe the well-known bistability of the viscoelastic\nflow in a cross-slot geometry for a FENE-CR fluid, and we describe the changes\nrequired for performing simulations with the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT), Giesekus\nand FENE-P models. Finally, we calculate the flow of a FENE-CR fluid in a\ngeometry with three in- and outlets. The implementation is included in the\nsupplementary material, and we hope that it can inspire new as well as\nexperienced researchers in the field of differential constitutive equations for\nviscoelastic flow.\n", "  The holographic approach to building the p-wave superconductors results in\nthree different models: the Maxwell-vector, the SU(2) Yang-Mills and the\nhelical. In the probe limit approximation, we analytically examine the\nproperties of the first two models in the theory with {\\it dark matter} sector.\nIt turns out that the effect of {\\it dark matter} on the Maxwell-vector p-wave\nmodel is the same as on the s-wave superconductor studied earlier. For the\nnon-Abelian model we study the phase transitions between p-wave holographic\ninsulator/superconductor and metal/superconductor.\n  Studies of marginally stable modes in the theory under consideration allow us\nto determine features of p-wave holographic droplet in a constant magnetic\nfield. The dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on the\ncoupling constant $\\alpha$ to the {\\it dark matter} sector is affected by the\n{\\it dark matter} density $\\rho_D$. For $\\rho_D>\\rho$ the transition\ntemperature is a decreasing function of $\\alpha$. The critical chemical\npotential $\\mu_c$ for the quantum phase transition between insulator and metal\ndepends on the chemical potential of dark matter $\\mu_D$ and for $\\mu_D=0$ is a\ndecreasing function of $\\alpha$.\n", "  Non-adiabatic charge pumping through a single-level quantum dot with\nperiodically modulated parameters is studied theoretically. By means of a\nquantum-master-equation approach the full counting statistics of the system is\nobtained. We find a trinomial-probability distribution of the charge transfer,\nwhich adequately describes the reversal of the pumping current by sweeping the\ndriving frequency. Further, we derive equations of motion for current and\nnoise, and solve those numerically for two different driving schemes. Both show\ninteresting features which can be fully analyzed due to the simple and generic\nmodel studied.\n", "  Quantum gates in topological quantum computation are performed by braiding\nnon-Abelian anyons. These braiding processes can presumably be performed with\nvery low error rates. However, to make a topological quantum computation\narchitecture truly scalable, even rare errors need to be corrected. Error\ncorrection for non-Abelian anyons is complicated by the fact that it needs to\nbe performed on a continuous basis and further errors may occur while we are\ncorrecting existing ones. Here, we provide the first study of this problem and\nprove its feasibility, establishing non-Abelian anyons as a viable platform for\nscalable quantum computation. We thereby focus on Ising anyons as the most\nprominent example of non-Abelian anyons and show that for these a finite error\nrate can indeed be corrected continuously. There is a threshold error rate\n$p_c>0$ such that for all error rates $p<p_c$ the probability of a logical\nerror per time-step can be made exponentially small in the distance of a\nlogical qubit.\n", "  Weyl semimetals may open a new era in condensed matter physics because they\nprovide the first example of Weyl fermions, realize a new topological\nclassification even though the system is gapless, exhibit Fermi arc surface\nstates and demonstrate the chiral anomaly and other exotic quantum phenomena.\nSo far, the only known Weyl semimetals are the TaAs class of materials. Here,\nwe propose the existence of a tunable Weyl metallic state in\nMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ via our first-principles calculations. We demonstrate\nthat a 2% Mo doping is sufficient to stabilize the Weyl metal state not only at\nlow temperatures but also at room temperatures. We show that, within a moderate\ndoping regime, the momentum space distance between the Weyl nodes and hence the\nlength of the Fermi arcs can be continuously tuned from zero to ~ 3% of the\nBrillouin zone size via changing Mo concentration, thus increasing the\ntopological strength of the system. Our results provide an experimentally\nfeasible route to realizing Weyl physics in the layered compound\nMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$, where non-saturating magneto-resistance and pressure\ndriven superconductivity have been observed.\n", "  The moduli space of instantons on an ALE space is studied using the moduli\nspace of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ field theories in three dimensions. For instantons in\na simple gauge group $G$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_n$, the Hilbert series of\nsuch an instanton moduli space is computed from the Coulomb branch of the\nquiver given by the affine Dynkin diagram of $G$ with flavour nodes of unitary\ngroups attached to various nodes of the Dynkin diagram. We provide a simple\nprescription to determine the ranks and the positions of these flavour nodes\nfrom the order of the orbifold $n$ and from the residual subgroup of $G$ that\nis left unbroken by the monodromy of the gauge field at infinity. For $G$ a\nsimply laced group of type $A$, $D$ or $E$, the Higgs branch of such a quiver\ndescribes the moduli space of instantons in projective unitary group $PU(n)\n\\cong U(n)/U(1)$ on orbifold $\\mathbb{C}^2/\\hat{G}$, where $\\hat{G}$ is the\ndiscrete group that is in McKay correspondence to $G$. Moreover, we present the\nquiver whose Coulomb branch describes the moduli space of $SO(2N)$ instantons\non a smooth ALE space of type $A_{2n-1}$ and whose Higgs branch describes the\nmoduli space of $PU(2n)$ instantons on a smooth ALE space of type $D_{N}$.\n", "  Dark matter halos are the building blocks of the universe as they host\ngalaxies and clusters. The knowledge of the clustering properties of halos is\ntherefore essential for the understanding of the galaxy statistical properties.\nWe derive an effective halo Boltzmann equation which can be used to describe\nthe halo clustering statistics. In particular, we show how the halo Boltzmann\nequation encodes a statistically biased gravitational force which generates a\nbias in the peculiar velocities of virialized halos with respect to the\nunderlying dark matter, as recently observed in N-body simulations.\n", "  We describe the general structure of the spherically symmetric solutions in\nthe Weyl conformal gravity. The corresponding Bach equations are derived for\nthe special type of metrics, which can be considered as the representative of\nthe general class. The complete set of the pure vacuum solutions, consisting of\ntwo classes, is found. The first one contains the solutions with constant\ntwo-dimensional curvature scalar, and the representatives are the famous\nRobertson--Walker metrics. We called one of them the \"gravitational bubbles\",\nwhich is compact and with zero Weyl tensor. These \"gravitational bubbles\" are\nthe pure vacuum curved space-times (without any material sources, including the\ncosmological constant), which are absolutely impossible in General Relativity.\nThis phenomenon makes it easier to create the universe from \"nothing\". The\nsecond class consists of the solutions with varying curvature scalar. We found\nits representative as the one-parameter family, which can be conformally\ncovered by the thee-parameter Mannheim--Kazanas solution. We describe the\ngeneral structure of the energy-momentum tensor in the spherical conformal\ngravity and construct the vectorial equation that reveals clearly some features\nof non-vacuum solutions.\n", "  Tests of local realism and macrorealism have historically been discussed in\nvery similar terms: Leggett-Garg inequalities follow Bell inequalities as\nnecessary conditions for classical behavior. Here, we compare the probability\npolytopes spanned by all measurable probability distributions for both\nscenarios and show that their structure differs strongly between spatially and\ntemporally separated measurements. We arrive at the conclusion that, in\ncontrast to tests of local realism where Bell inequalities form a necessary and\nsufficient set of conditions, no set of inequalities can ever be necessary and\nsufficient for a macrorealistic description. Fine's famous proof that Bell\ninequalities are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a local\nrealistic model, therefore cannot be transferred to macrorealism. A recently\nproposed condition, no-signaling in time, fulfills this criterion, and we show\nwhy it is better suited for future experimental tests and theoretical studies\nof macrorealism. Our work thereby identifies a major difference between the\nmathematical structures of local realism and macrorealism.\n", "  Anyons exist as point like particles in two dimensions and carry braid\nstatistics which enable interactions that are independent of the distance\nbetween the particles. Except for a relatively few number of models which are\nanalytically tractable, much of the physics of anyons remain still unexplored.\nIn this paper, we show how U(1)-symmetry can be combined with the previously\nproposed anyonic Matrix Product States to simulate ground states and dynamics\nof anyonic systems on a lattice at any rational particle number density. We\nprovide proof of principle by studying itinerant anyons on a one dimensional\nchain where no natural notion of braiding arises and also on a two-leg ladder\nwhere the anyons hop between sites and possibly braid. We compare the result of\nthe ground state energies of Fibonacci anyons against hardcore bosons and\nspinless fermions. In addition, we report the entanglement entropies of the\nground states of interacting Fibonacci anyons on a fully filled two-leg ladder\nat different interaction strength, identifying gapped or gapless points in the\nparameter space. As an outlook, our approach can also prove useful in studying\nthe time dynamics of a finite number of nonabelian anyons on a finite\ntwo-dimensional lattice.\n", "  Controlling the bandgap through local-strain engineering is an exciting\navenue for tailoring optoelectronic materials. Two-dimensional crystals are\nparticularly suited for this purpose because they can withstand unprecedented\nnon-homogeneous deformations before rupture: one can literally bend them and\nfold them up almost like a piece of paper. Here, we study multi-layer black\nphosphorus sheets subjected to periodic stress to modulate their optoelectronic\nproperties. We find a remarkable shift of the optical absorption band-edge of\nup to ~0.7 eV between the regions under tensile and compressive stress, greatly\nexceeding the strain tunability reported for transition metal dichalcogenides.\nThis observation is supported by theoretical models which also predict that\nthis periodic stress modulation can yield to quantum confinement of carriers at\nlow temperatures. The possibility of generating large strain-induced variations\nin the local density of charge carriers opens the door for a variety of\napplications including photovoltaics, quantum optics and two-dimensional\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  A novel zero-order resonator has been designed by an optical surface\ntransformation (OST) method. The resonator proposed here has many novel\nfeatures. Firstly, the mode volume can be very small (e.g. in the subwavelength\nscale). Secondly, the resonator is open (no reflecting walls are utilized) and\nresonant effects can be found in a continuous spectrum (i.e. a continuum of\neigenmodes). Thirdly, we only need one homogenous medium to realize the\nproposed resonator. The shape of the resonator can be a ring structure of\narbitrary shape. In addition to the natural applications (e.g. optical storage)\nof an optical resonator, we also suggest some other applications of our novel\noptical open resonator (e.g. power combination, squeezing electromagnetic\nenergy in the free space).\n", "  We demonstrate site-resolved imaging of individual bosonic\n$^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms in a Hubbard-regime two-dimensional optical lattice\nwith a short lattice constant of 266 nm. To suppress the heating by probe light\nwith the $^1S_0$-$^1P_1$ transition of the wavelength $\\lambda$ = 399 nm for\nhigh-resolution imaging and preserve atoms at the same lattice sites during the\nfluorescence imaging, we simultaneously cool atoms by additionally applying\nnarrow-line optical molasses with the $^1S_0$-$^3P_1$ transition of the\nwavelength $\\lambda$ = 556 nm. We achieve a low temperature of $T = 7.4(1.3)\\\n\\mu\\mathrm{K}$, corresponding to a mean oscillation quantum number along the\nhorizontal axes of 0.22(4) during imaging process. We detect on average 200\nfluorescence photons from a single atom within 400 ms exposure time, and\nestimate the detection fidelity of 87(2)%. The realization of a quantum gas\nmicroscope with enough fidelity for Yb atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical\nlattice opens up the possibilities for studying various kinds of quantum\nmany-body systems such as Bose and Fermi gases, and their mixtures, and also\nlong-range-interacting systems such as Rydberg states.\n", "  One proposal for dS/CFT is that the Hartle-Hawking (HH) wave function in the\nlarge volume limit is equal to the partition function of a Euclidean CFT\ndeformed by various operators. All saddle points defining the semiclassical HH\nwave function in cosmology have a representation in which their interior\ngeometry is part of a Euclidean AdS domain wall with complex matter fields. We\ncompute the wave functions of scalar and tensor perturbations around\nhomogeneous isotropic complex saddle points, turning on single scalar field\nmatter only. We compare their predictions for the spectra of CMB perturbations\nwith those of a different dS/CFT proposal based on the analytic continuation of\ninflationary universes to real asymptotically AdS domain walls. We find the\npredictions of both bulk calculations agree to first order in the slow roll\nparameters, but there is a difference at higher order which, we argue, is a\nsignature of the HH state of the fluctuations.\n", "  We present the leading order non-linear density and velocity power spectra in\nthe complete form; previous studies have omitted the vector- and tensor-type\nperturbations simultaneously excited by the scalar-type perturbation in\nnonlinear order. These additional contributions are comparable to the\nscalar-type purely relativistic perturbations, and thus negligible in the\ncurrent paradigm of concordance cosmology: i.e., concerning density and\nvelocity perturbations of the pressureless matter in perturbation regime well\ninside of matter-dominated epoch, we show that pure Einstein's gravity\ncontributions appearing from the third order are entirely negligible (five\norders of magnitude smaller than the Newtonian contributions) in all scales. We\nthus prove that Newtonian perturbation theory is quite reliable in calculating\nthe amplitude of matter fluctuations even in the precision era of cosmology.\nTherefore, besides the ones imprinted as the initial condition generated in the\nearlier phase, the other relativistic effect relevant for interpreting\nobservational data must be the projection effect that occurs when mapping\ngalaxies on to the observed coordinate.\n", "  Semi-metals might offer a stronger interaction and a better confinement for\nterahertz wave than semiconductors, while preserve tunability. Particularly,\ngraphene-based materials are envisioned as terahertz modulators, filters and\nultra-broadband sources. However, the understanding of terahertz generation\nfrom those materials is still not clear, thus limits us recognizing the\npotential and improving device performances. Graphite, the mother material of\ngraphene and a typical bulk semi-metal, is a good system to study semi-metals\nand graphene-based materials. Here we experimentally modulate and maximize the\nterahertz signal from graphite surface, thus reveal the mechanism - surface\nfield driving photon induced carriers into transient current to radiate\nterahertz wave. We also discuss the differences between graphite and\nsemiconductors; particularly graphite shows no temperature dependency from room\ntemperature to 80C. Above knowledge will help us understand terahertz\ngenerations, achieve maximum output and electric modulation, in semi-metal or\ngraphene based devices.\n", "  We report the first experimental observation of an Excitonic Optical Tamm\nState supported at the interface between a periodic multilayer dielectric\nstructure and an organic dye-doped polymer layer. The existence of such states\nis enabled by the metal-like optical properties of the excitonic layer based on\naggregated dye molecules. Experimentally determined dispersion curves, together\nwith simulated data, including field profiles, allow us to identify the nature\nof these new modes. Our results demonstrate the potential of organic excitonic\nmaterials as a powerful means to control light at the nanoscale, offering the\nprospect of a new alternative type of nanophotonics based on molecular\nmaterials.\n", "  We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that still\nrelate to linguistic meaning. We show that these relations can be described by\nthe Dirichlet distribution, a direct analogue of the ideal-gas model in\nstatistical mechanics. This description allows us to demonstrate that the\nrank-frequency relations for phonemes of a text do depend on its author. The\nauthor-dependency effect is not caused by the author's vocabulary (common words\nused in different texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This\nsuggests that it can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast\nto rank-frequency relations for words, which are both author and text\nindependent and are governed by the Zipf's law.\n", "  A thorough understanding of properties of neutron stars requires both a\nreliable knowledge of the equation of state (EOS) of super-dense nuclear matter\nand the strong-field gravity theories simultaneously. To provide information\nthat may help break this EOS-gravity degeneracy, we investigate effects of\nnuclear symmetry energy on the gravitational binding energy of neutron stars\nwithin GR and the scalar-tensor subset of alternative gravity models. We focus\non effects of the slope $L$ of nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density\nand the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy. We find that the\nvariation of either the density slope $L$ or the high-density behavior of\nnuclear symmetry energy leads to large changes in the binding energy of neutron\nstars. The difference in predictions using the GR and the scalar-tensor theory\nappears only for massive neutron stars, and even then is significantly smaller\nthan the difference resulting from variations in the symmetry energy.\n", "  The Yang-Baxter equation has long been recognised as the masterkey to\nintegrability, providing the basis for exactly solved models which capture the\nfundamental physics of a number of realistic classical and quantum systems. In\nthis article we provide an introductory overview of the impact of Yang-Baxter\nintegrable models on experiments in condensed matter physics and ultracold\natoms. A number of prominent examples are mentioned, including the hard-hexagon\nmodel, the Heisenberg spin chain, the transverse quantum Ising chain, a spin\nladder model, the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the Gaudin-Yang Fermi gas and the\ntwo-site Bose-Hubbard model. The review concludes by pointing to some other\nrecent developments with promise for further progress.\n", "  An accurate and extensive Inter-laboratory comparison between the laboratory\nfor the calibration of multifunction electrical instruments of the National\nInstitute of Metrology Research (INRIM) and a secondary high level electrical\ncalibration laboratory was performed with satisfactory results. The instrument\ninvolved in the comparison was a top class multifunction calibrator, chosen for\nits wide measurement fields and its excellent definability requiring\nsensitively small uncertainties to calibrate it. The relevancy of this work is\nthat for the first time at INRIM, a ILC involving a grid of about one hundred\nand thirty measurement points was carried out. This ILC allowed to exhaustively\ncheck the measurement capabilities and exploit the measurement techniques of\nthe secondary laboratory. Attention was also paid to individuate the correlated\nuncertainty components between the two laboratories measurements. The\ncalibrator resulted adequate to verify the capabilities of high level secondary\nelectrical calibration laboratories, better\n", "  We present a simplified version of a repeater protocol in a cold neutral-atom\nensemble with Rydberg excitations optimized for two-node entanglement\ngeneration and describe a protocol for quantum teleportation. Our proposal\ndraws from previous proposals [Zhao, {\\sl et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 81},\n052329 (2010)] and [Han, {\\sl et al.} Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 81}, 052311 (2010)] who\ndescribed efficient and robust protocols for long-distance entanglement with\nmany nodes. Using realistic experimental values we predict an entanglement\ngeneration rate of $\\sim$25 Hz and teleportation rate of $\\sim$ 5 Hz. Our\npredicted rates match the current state of the art experiments for entanglement\ngeneration and teleportation between quantum memories. With improved\nefficiencies we predict entanglement generation and teleportation rates of\n$\\sim$7.8 kHz and $\\sim$3.6 kHz respectively, representing a two order of\nmagnitude improvement over the currently realized values. Cold-atom ensembles\nwith Rydberg excitations are promising candidates for repeater nodes because\ncollective effects in the ensemble can be used to deterministically generate a\nlong-lived ground state memory which may be efficiently mapped onto a\ndirectionally emitted single photon.\n", "  We present a pedagogical discussion of the Coriolis field, emphasizing its\nnot-so-well-understood aspects. We show that this field satisfies the field\nequations of the so-called Newton-Cartan theory, a generalization of Newtonian\ngravity that is covariant under changes of arbitrarily rotating and accelerated\nframes. Examples of solutions of this theory are given, including the Newtonian\nanalogue of the G\\\"odel universe. We discuss how to detect the Coriolis field\nby its effect on gyroscopes, of which the gyrocompass is an example. Finally,\nusing a similar framework, we discuss the Coriolis field generated by mass\ncurrents in general relativity, and its measurement by the Gravity Probe B and\nLAGEOS/LARES experiments.\n", "  In this article we discuss our implementation of a polyphase filter for\nreal-time data processing in radio astronomy. We describe in detail our\nimplementation of the polyphase filter algorithm and its behaviour on three\ngenerations of NVIDIA GPU cards, on dual Intel Xeon CPUs and the Intel Xeon Phi\n(Knights Corner) platforms. All of our implementations aim to exploit the\npotential for data reuse that the algorithm offers. Our GPU implementations\nexplore two different methods for achieving this, the first makes use of\nL1/Texture cache, the second uses shared memory. We discuss the usability of\neach of our implementations along with their behaviours. We measure performance\nin execution time, which is a critical factor for real-time systems, we also\npresent results in terms of bandwidth (GB/s), compute (GFlop/s) and type\nconversions (GTc/s). We include a presentation of our results in terms of the\nsample rate which can be processed in real-time by a chosen platform, which\nmore intuitively describes the expected performance in a signal processing\nsetting. Our findings show that, for the GPUs considered, the performance of\nour polyphase filter when using lower precision input data is limited by type\nconversions rather than device bandwidth. We compare these results to an\nimplementation on the Xeon Phi. We show that our Xeon Phi implementation has a\nperformance that is 1.47x to 1.95x greater than our CPU implementation, however\nis not insufficient to compete with the performance of GPUs. We conclude with a\ncomparison of our best performing code to two other implementations of the\npolyphase filter, showing that our implementation is faster in nearly all\ncases. This work forms part of the Astro-Accelerate project, a many-core\naccelerated real-time data processing library for digital signal processing of\ntime-domain radio astronomy data.\n", "  We study universal features in the shape dependence of entanglement entropy\nin the vacuum state of a conformal field theory (CFT) on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,d-1}$.\nWe consider the entanglement entropy across a deformed planar or spherical\nentangling surface in terms of a perturbative expansion in the infinitesimal\nshape deformation. In particular, we focus on the second order term in this\nexpansion, known as the entanglement density. This quantity is known to be\nnon-positive by the strong-subadditivity property. We show from a purely field\ntheory calculation that the non-local part of the entanglement density in any\nCFT is universal, and proportional to the coefficient $C_T$ appearing in the\ntwo-point function of stress tensors in that CFT. As applications of our\nresult, we prove the conjectured universality of the corner term coefficient\n$\\frac{\\sigma}{C_T}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{24}$ in $d=3$ CFTs, and the holographic Mezei\nformula for entanglement entropy across deformed spheres.\n", "  For supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with light sgoldstinos -\nscalar and pseudoscalar superparthners of goldstino - we estimate the signal\nrate anticipated at the lately proposed fixed target experiment SHiP utilizing\nCERN SPS beam of 400 GeV protons. We also place new limits on the model\nparameters from the similar analysis of the published results of CHARM\nexperiment.\n", "  Thermodynamics is the phenomenological theory of heat and work. Here we\nanalyze to what extent quantum thermodynamic relations are immune to the\nunderlying mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. As a main result, we\nshow that the Jarzynski equality holds true for all non-hermitian quantum\nsystems with real spectrum. This equality expresses the second law of\nthermodynamics for isothermal processes arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In\nthe quasistatic limit however, the second law leads to the Carnot bound which\nis fulfilled even if some eigenenergies are complex provided they appear in\nconjugate pairs. Furthermore, we propose two setups to test our predictions.\nNamely with strongly interacting excitons and photons in a semiconductor\nmicrocavity and in the non-hermitian tight-binding model.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of heat transfer in a composite ceramic\nmaterial where the structural elements are bonded to the matrix via a thin heat\nresistant adhesive layer. The layer has the form of a circular ring or close to\nit. Using an asymptotic approach, the interphase is modeled by an infinitesimal\nimperfect interface, preserving the main features of the temperature fields\naround the interphase, and allowing a significant simplification where FEM\nanalysis is concerned. The nonlinear transmission conditions that accompany\nsuch an imperfect interface are evaluated, and their accuracy is verified by\nmeans of dedicated analytical examples as well as carefully designed FEM\nsimulations. The interphases of various geometries are analysed, with an\nemphasis on the influence of the curvature of their boundaries on the accuracy\nof the evaluated conditions. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the\napproach and its limitations.\n", "  What kind of one-dimensional modulated nematic structures (ODMNS) can form\nnonchiral and chiral bent-core and dimeric materials? Here, using\nLandau-deGennes theory of nematics, extended to account for molecular steric\npolarization, we study a possibility of formation of ODMNS, both in nonchiral\nand intrinsically chiral liquid crystalline materials. Besides nematic and\ncholesteric phases, we find four bulk ODMNS for nonchiral materials, two of\nwhich have not been reported so far. These new structures are longitudinal\n($N_{LP}$) and transverse ($N_{TP}$) periodic waves where the polarization\nfield being periodic in one dimension stays parallel and perpendicular,\nrespectively, to the wave vector. The other two phases have all characteristic\nfeatures of the twist-bend nematic phase ($N_{TB}$) and the splay-bend nematic\nphase ($N_{SB}$), but their fine structure appears more complex than that\nconsidered so far. The presence of molecular chirality converts nonchiral\n$N_{TP}$ and $N_{SB}$ into new $N_{TB}$ phases. Interestingly, the nonchiral\n$N_{LP}$ phase can stay stable even in the presence of intrinsic molecular\nchirality. Exemplary phase diagrams provide further insights into the relative\nstability of these new modulated nematic structures.\n", "  Catalytic coherence transformations allow the otherwise impossible state\ntransformations using only incoherent operations with the aid of an auxiliary\nsystem with finite coherence which is not being consumed in anyway. Here we\nfind the necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic and\nstochastic catalytic coherence transformations between pair of pure quantum\nstates. In particular, we show that the simultaneous decrease of a family of\nR\\'enyi entropies of the diagonal parts of the states under consideration are\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic catalytic coherence\ntransformations. Similarly, for stochastic catalytic coherence transformations\nwe find the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving higher optimal\nprobability of conversion. We, thus, completely characterize the coherence\ntransformations amongst pure quantum states under incoherent operations. We\ngive numerous examples to elaborate our results. We also explore the\npossibility of the same system acting as a catalyst for itself and find that\nindeed {\\it self catalysis} is possible. Further, for the cases where no\ncatalytic coherence transformation is possible we provide entanglement assisted\ncoherence transformations and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsuch transformations.\n", "  An irreversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with skew detailed\nbalance conditions originally proposed by Turitsyn et al. is extended to\ngeneral discrete systems on the basis of the Metropolis-Hastings scheme. To\nevaluate the efficiency of our proposed method, the relaxation dynamics of the\nslowest mode and the asymptotic variance are studied analytically in a random\nwalk on one dimension. It is found that the performance in irreversible MCMC\nmethods violating the detailed balance condition is improved by appropriately\nchoosing parameters in the algorithm.\n", "  We present photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements of single-layer\nMoSe2 as a function of uniform uniaxial strain. A simple clamping and bending\nmethod is described that allows for application of uniaxial strain to layered,\n2D materials with strains up to 1.1% without slippage. Using this technique, we\nfind that the electronic band gap of single layer MoSe2 can be reversibly tuned\nby -27 +- 2 meV per percent of strain. This is in agreement with our\ndensity-functional theory calculations, which estimate a modulation of -32 meV\nper percent of strain, taking into account the role of deformation of the\nunderlying substrate upon bending. Finally, due to its narrow PL spectra as\ncompared with that of MoS2, we show that MoSe2 provides a more precise\ndetermination of small changes in strain making it the ideal 2D material for\nstrain applications.\n", "  Femtosecond electron microscopy produces real-space images of matter in a\nseries of ultrafast snapshots. Pulses of electrons self-disperse under\nspace-charge broadening, so without compression, the ideal operation mode is a\nsingle electron per pulse. Here, we demonstrate for the first time femtosecond\nsingle-electron point projection microscopy (fs-ePPM) in a laser-pump\nfs-e-probe configuration. The electrons have an energy of only 150 eV and take\ntens of picoseconds to propagate to the object under study. Nonetheless, we\nachieve a temporal resolution with a standard deviation of 120 fs, combined\nwith a spatial resolution of 100 nm, applied to a localized region of charge at\nthe apex of a nanoscale metal tip induced by 30 fs 800 nm laser pulses at 50\nkHz. These observations demonstrate real-space imaging of reversible processes\nsuch as tracking charge distributions is feasible whilst maintaining\nfemtosecond resolution. Our findings could find application as a\ncharacterization method, which, depending on geometry could resolve tens of\nfemtoseconds and tens of nanometres. Dynamically imaging electric and magnetic\nfields and charge distributions on sub-micron length scales opens new avenues\nof ultrafast dynamics. Furthermore, through the use of active compression, such\npulses are an ideal seed for few-femtosecond to attosecond imaging applications\nwhich will access sub-optical cycle processes in nanoplasmonics.\n", "  We study the emergence and coherence of stochastic oscillations in star\nnetworks of excitable elements in which peripheral nodes receive independent\nrandom inputs. A biophysical model of a distal branch of sensory neuron in\nwhich peripheral nodes of Ranvier are coupled to a central node by myelinated\ncable segments is used along with a generic model of networked stochastic\nactive rotators. We show that coherent oscillations can emerge due to\nstochastic synchronization of peripheral nodes and that the degree of coherence\ncan be maximized by tuning the coupling strength and the size of the network.\nAnalytical results are obtained for the strong coupling regime of the active\nrotator network. In particular, we show that in the strong coupling regime the\nnetwork dynamics can be described by an effective single active rotator with\nrescaled parameters and noise.\n", "  We measure the decay $B_s^0\\rightarrow K^0\\overline{K}^0$ using data\ncollected at the $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB\n$e^+e^-$ collider. The data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity\nof 121.4 ${\\rm fb^{-1}}$. We measure a branching fraction\n$\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0\\rightarrow K^0\\overline{K}^0) = [19.6\\,^{+5.8}_{-5.1}({\\rm\nstat.})\\,\\pm1.0({\\rm sys.})\\,\\pm 2.0(N^{}_{B_s^0\\overline{B}_s^0})]\\times\n10^{-6}$ with a significance of 5.1 standard deviations. This measurement\nconstitutes the first observation of this decay.\n", "  We study the soft behavior of two seemingly different particles that are both\nreferred to as dilatons in the literature, namely the one that appears in\ntheories of gravity and in string theory and the Nambu-Goldstone boson of\nspontaneously broken conformal invariance. Our primary result is the discovery\nof a soft theorem at subsubleading order for each dilaton, which in both cases\ncontains the operator of special conformal transformations. Interesting\nsimilarities as well as differences between the dilaton soft theorems are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We compute the momentum diffusion coefficients of heavy quarks,\n$\\kappa_\\parallel$ and $\\kappa_\\perp$, in a strong magnetic field $B$ along the\ndirections parallel and perpendicular to $B$, respectively, at the leading\norder in QCD coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. We consider a regime relevant for\nthe relativistic heavy ion collisions, $\\alpha_s eB\\ll T^2\\ll eB$, so that\nthermal excitations of light quarks are restricted to the lowest Landau level\n(LLL) states. In the vanishing light-quark mass limit, we find\n$\\kappa_\\perp^{\\rm LO}\\propto \\alpha_s^2 T eB$ in the leading order that arises\nfrom screened Coulomb scatterings with (1+1)-dimensional LLL quarks, while\n$\\kappa_\\parallel$ gets no contribution from the scatterings with LLL quarks\ndue to kinematic restrictions. We show that the first non-zero leading order\ncontributions to $\\kappa_\\parallel^{\\rm LO}$ come from the two separate\neffects: 1) the screened Coulomb scatterings with thermal gluons, and 2) a\nfinite light-quark mass $m_q$. The former leads to $\\kappa_\\parallel^{\\rm\nLO,\\,gluon} \\propto \\alpha_s^2 T^3$ and the latter to $\\kappa_\\parallel^{\\rm\nLO,\\,massive}\\propto \\alpha_s (\\alpha_s eB)^{1/2} m_q^2$. Based on our results,\nwe propose a new scenario for the large value of heavy-quark elliptic flow\nobserved in RHIC and LHC. Namely, when $\\kappa_\\perp\\gg\\kappa_\\parallel$, an\nanisotropy in drag forces gives rise to a sizable amount of the heavy-quark\nelliptic flow even if heavy quarks do not fully belong to an ellipsoidally\nexpanding background fluid.\n", "  We generalise gauge theory on a graph so that the gauge group becomes a\nfinite-dimensional ribbon Hopf algebra, the graph becomes a ribbon graph, and\ngauge-theoretic concepts such as connections, gauge transformations and\nobservables are replaced by linearised analogues. Starting from physical\nconsiderations, we derive an axiomatic definition of Hopf-algebra gauge theory,\nincluding locality conditions under which the theory for a general ribbon graph\ncan be assembled from local data in the neighbourhood of each vertex. For a\nvertex neighbourhood with n incoming edge ends, the algebra of non-commutative\n\"functions\" of connections is dual to a two-sided twist deformation of the\nn-fold tensor power of the gauge Hopf algebra. We show these algebras assemble\nto give an algebra of functions and gauge-invariant subalgebra of \"observables\"\nthat coincide with those obtained in the combinatorial quantisation of\nChern-Simons theory, thus providing an axiomatic derivation of the latter. We\nthen discuss holonomy in a Hopf algebra gauge theory and show that for\nsemisimple Hopf algebras this gives, for each path in the embedded graph, a map\nfrom connections into the gauge Hopf algebra, depending functorially on the\npath. Curvatures---holonomies around the faces canonically associated to the\nribbon graph---then correspond to central elements of the algebra of\nobservables, and define a set of commuting projectors onto the subalgebra of\nobservables on flat connections. The algebras of observables for all\nconnections or for flat connections are topological invariants, depending only\non the topology, respectively, of the punctured or closed surface canonically\nobtained by gluing annuli or discs along edges of the ribbon graph.\n", "  We theoretically explore the driven-dissipative physics of geometrically\nfrustrated lattices of cavity resonators with relatively weak nonlinearities,\ni.e. a photon-photon interaction smaller than the loss rate. In such systems,\nphoton modes with zero probability at 'dark' sites are present at the\nsingle-particle level due to interference effects. In particular, we study the\nbehavior of a cell with three coupled resonators as well as extended Lieb\nlattices in 1D and 2D. By considering a partial pumping scheme, with the\ndriving field not applied to the dark sites, we predict that even in presence\nof relatively weak photon-photon interactions the nominally dark sites achieve\na finite photonic population with strong correlations. We show that this is a\nconsequence of biphoton and multiphoton states that in the absence of\nfrustration would not be visible in the observables.\n", "  In this paper, we study random walks on a small-world scale-free network,\nalso called as pseudofractal scale-free web (PSFW), and analyze the\nvolatilities of first passage time (FPT) and first return time (FRT) by using\nthe variance and the reduced moment as the measures. Note that the FRT and FPT\nare deeply affected by the starting or target site. We don't intend to\nenumerate all the possible cases and analyze them. We only study the\nvolatilities of FRT for a given hub (i.e., node with highest degree) and the\nvolatilities of the global FPT (GFPT) to a given hub, which is the average of\nthe FPTs for arriving at a given hub from any possible starting site selected\nrandomly according to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain.\nFirstly, we calculate exactly the probability generating function of the GFPT\nand FRT based on the self-similar structure of the PSFW. Then, we calculate the\nprobability distribution, the mean, the variance and reduced moment of the GFPT\nand FRT by using the generating functions as a tool. Results show that: the\nreduced moment of FRT grows with the increasing of the network order $N$ and\ntends to infinity while $N\\rightarrow\\infty$; but for the reduced moments of\nGFPT, it is almost a constant($\\approx1.1605$) for large $N$. Therefore, on the\nPSFW of large size, the FRT has huge fluctuations and the estimate provided by\nMFRT is unreliable, whereas the fluctuations of the GFPT is much smaller and\nthe estimate provided by its mean is more reliable. The method we propose can\nalso be used to analyze the volatilities of FPT and FRT on other networks with\nself-similar structure, such as $(u, v)$ flowers and recursive scale-free\ntrees.\n", "  The effective field theory for hydrodynamics allows to write the action\nfunctional for fluid. In this paper, some simplest possible higher derivative\nterms in the fluid action and the cosmological consequences of their presence\nare considered. Particular attention is given to dark matter, modelled as a\ndust with higher derivative corrections. We study the conditions of absence of\nsingularities in the solutions of the background and perturbed equations and\ninvestigate the evolution of perturbations in two simple models of matter\ndominated Universe. There is a range of parameters describing the higher\nderivative terms, in which the short-wavelength perturbations of dark matter\nare suppressed and the dark matter can be seen as fairly homogeneous on a\nsufficiently small scale.\n", "  In quantum mechanics the position and momentum operators are related to each\nother via the Fourier transform. In the same way, here we show that the\nso-called Pegg-Barnett phase operator can be obtained by the application of the\ndiscrete Fourier transform to the number operator defined in a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Furthermore, we show that the structure of\nthe London-Susskind-Glogower phase operator, whose natural logarithm give rise\nthe Pegg-Barnett phase operator, is contained into the Hamiltonian of circular\nwaveguide arrays. Our results may find applications in the development of new\nfinite-dimensional photonic systems with interesting phase-dependent\nproperties.\n", "  With the motivation of discovering high-temperature superconductors,\nevolutionary algorithm is employed to search for all stable compounds in the\nSn-H system. In addition to the traditional SnH$_4$, new hydrides SnH$_8$,\nSnH$_{12}$ and SnH$_{14}$ are found to be thermodynamically stable at high\npressure. Dynamical stability and superconductivity of tin-hydrides are\nsystematically investigated. I$\\bar{4}$m2-SnH$_8$, C2/m-SnH$_{12}$ and\nC2/m-SnH$_{14}$ exhibit higher superconducting transition temperatures of 81,\n93 and 97 K compared to the traditional compound SnH$_4$ with T$_c$ of 52 K at\n200 GPa. An interesting bent H$_3^-$ in I$\\bar{4}$m2-SnH$_8$ and novel liner\nH$_4^-$ in C2/m-SnH$_{12}$ are observed. All the new tin-hydrides remain\nmetallic over their predicted range of stability. The intermediate-frequency\nwagging and bending vibrations have more contribution to electron-phonon\ncoupling parameter than high-frequency stretching vibrations of H$_2$ and\nH$_3$.\n", "  Quantum superposition in mechanical systems is not only key evidence for\nmacroscopic quantum coherence, but can also be utilized in modern quantum\ntechnology. Here we propose an efficient approach for creating macroscopically\ndistinct mechanical superposition states in a two-mode optomechanical system.\nPhoton hopping between the two cavity modes is modulated sinusoidally. The\nmodulated photon tunneling enables an ultrastrong radiation-pressure force\nacting on the mechanical resonator, and hence significantly increases the\nmechanical displacement induced by a single photon. We study systematically the\ngeneration of the Yurke-Stoler-like states in the presence of system\ndissipations. We also discuss the experimental implementation of this scheme.\n", "  We present a simple and accurate computational method, which facilitates\nab-initio path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, where the quantum\nmechanical nature of the nuclei is explicitly taken into account, at\nessentially no additional computational cost in comparison to the corresponding\ncalculation using classical nuclei. The predictive power of the proposed\nquantum ring-polymer contraction method is demonstrated by computing various\nstatic and dynamic properties of liquid water at ambient conditions. This\ndevelopment permits to routinely include nuclear quantum effects in ab-initio\nmolecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  Optically-transparent immersion liquids with refractive index (n ~ 1.77) to\nmatch sapphire-based aplanatic numerical aperture increasing lens (aNAIL) are\nnecessary for achieving deep 3D imaging with high spatial resolution. We report\nthat antimony tribromide (SbBr$_{3}$) salt dissolved in liquid diiodomethane\n(CH$_{2}$I$_{2}$) provides a new high refractive index immersion liquid for\noptics applications. The refractive index is tunable from n = 1.74 (pure) to n\n= 1.873 (saturated), by adjusting either salt concentration or temperature;\nthis allows it to match (or even exceed) the refractive index of sapphire.\nImportantly, the solution gives excellent light transmittance in the\nultraviolet to near-infrared range, an improvement over commercially-available\nimmersion liquids. This refractive index matched immersion liquid formulation\nhas enabled us to develop a sapphire-based aNAIL objective that has both high\nnumerical aperture (NA = 1.17) and long working distance (WD = 12 mm). This\nopens up new possibilities for deep 3D imaging with high spatial resolution.\n", "  HfTe5 is predicted to be a promising platform for studying topological\nphases. Here through an electrical transport study, we present the first\nobservation of chiral anomaly and ultrahigh mobility in HfTe5 crystals.\nNegative magneto-resistivity in HfTe5 is observed when the external magnetic\nand electrical fields are parallel (B//E) and quickly disappears once B\ndeviates from the direction of E. Quantitative fitting further confirms the\nchiral anomaly as the underlying physics. Moreover, by analyzing the\nconductivity tensors of longitudinal and Hall traces, ultrahigh mobility and\nultralow carrier density are revealed in HfTe5, which paves the way for\npotential electronic applications.\n", "  Numerous efforts have been devoted to reveal exotic semimetallic phases with\ntopologically non-trivial bulk and/or surface states in materials with strong\nspin-orbit coupling. In particular, semimetals with nodal line Fermi surface\n(FS) exhibit novel properties, and searching for candidate materials becomes an\ninteresting research direction. Here we provide a generic condition for a\nfour-fold degenerate nodal line FS in non-symmorphic crystals with inversion\nand time-reversal symmetry (TRS). When there are two glide planes or screw axes\nperpendicular to each other, a pair of Bloch bands related by non-symmorphic\nsymmetry become degenerate on a Brillouin Zone (BZ) boundary. There are two\npairs of such bands, and they disperse in a way that the partners of two pairs\nare exchanged on other BZ boundaries. This enforces a nodal line FS on a BZ\nboundary plane protected by non-symmorphic symmetries. When TRS is broken,\nfour-fold degenerate Dirac points or Weyl ring FS could occur depending on a\ndirection of the magnetic field. On a certain surface double helical surface\nstates exist, which become double Ferm arcs as TRS is broken.\n", "  Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is a newly discovered 2D material which is of\ngreat interest for applications in electronics and catalysis. PtSe2 films were\nsynthesized by thermally-assisted selenization of predeposited platinum films\nand scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the crystal structure of\nthese films to be 1T. Raman scattering of these films was studied as a function\nof film thickness, laser wavelength and laser polarization. Eg and A1g Raman\nactive modes were identified using polarization measurements in the Raman\nsetup. These modes were found to display a clear position and intensity\ndependence with film thickness, for multiple excitation wavelengths, and their\npeak positions agree with simulated phonon dispersion curves for PtSe2. These\nresults highlight the practicality of using Raman spectroscopy as a prime\ncharacterization technique for newly-synthesized 2D materials.\n", "  Since the well-known PT symmetry has its fundamental significance and\nimplication in physics, where PT denotes the combined operation of\nspace-inversion P and time-reversal T, it is extremely important and intriguing\nto completely classify exotic PT-invariant topological metals and to physically\nrealize them. Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification\nof topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As\na physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D\nBrillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through\nits PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these\nexact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect\ntunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical\nlattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a\nspin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create\nout-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic\ncold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped\nband-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and\nnon-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined\nPT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are\ncharacterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we\ndemonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be\ndetected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener\noscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the\ntime-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through\nBragg spectroscopy. The present proposal for realizing topological NL states in\ncold atom systems may provide a unique experimental platform for exploring\nexotic PT-invariant topological physics.\n", "  The shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity in Cu nanowires is one possible\npair of mechanisms that prevents high aspect ratio nanosized field electron\nemitters to be stable at room temperature and permits their growth under high\nelectric field. By utilizing hybrid electrodynamics molecular dynamics\nsimulations we show that a global electric field of 1 GV/m or more\nsignificantly increases the stability and critical temperature of spontaneous\nreorientation of nanosized <100> Cu field emitters. We also show that in the\nstudied tips the stabilizing effect of an external applied electric field is an\norder of magnitude greater than the destabilization caused by the field\nemission current. We detect the critical temperature of spontaneous\nreorientation using the tool that spots the changes in crystal structure. The\nmethod is compatible with techniques that consider the change in potential\nenergy, has a wider range of applicability and allows pinpointing different\nstages in the reorientation processes.\n", "  We study the equilibrium properties of a single flexible homopolymers where\nconsecutive monomers are represented by impenetrable hard spherical beads\ntangential to each other, and non-consecutive monomers interact via a\nsquare-well potential. To this aim, we use both replica exchange canonical\nsimulations and micro-canonical Wang-Landau techniques. We perform a close\ncomparative analysis of the corresponding results, and find perfect agreement\nbetween the two methods as well as the past results. The model is then refined\nin two different directions. By allowing partial overlapping between\nconsecutive beads, we break the spherical symmetry and thus provide a severe\nconstraint on the possible conformations of the chain. This leads to a single\nhelix or a double helix ground state, depending on the range of the\ninteractions. Alternatively, we introduce additional spherical beads at\nspecific positions to represent the steric hindrance of the side chains in real\nproteins. The ground state in this case is found to be again a globule, thus\nshowing that contrary to some recent suggestions, side chains alone are not\nsufficient to insure a protein-like structure. Finally, we show that a\ncombination of the above two effects increases the stability of the obtaining\nsecondary structures, in agreement with previous results. The fundamental role\nplayed by the range of the square-well attraction is highlighted, and it is\nshown that they play a role similar to that found in simple liquids and\npolymers. Perspectives in terms of protein folding are finally discussed.\n", "  We discuss the 750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC@13TeV in the framework of\nleptophobic U(1)$^\\prime$ model inspired by $E_6$ grand unified theory (GUT).\nIn this model, the Standard Model (SM) chiral fermions carry charges under\nextra U(1)$^\\prime$ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a\nU(1)$^\\prime$-charged singlet scalar ($\\Phi$). In addition, extra quarks and\nleptons are introduced to achieve the anomaly-free conditions, which is a\nnatural consequence of the assumed $E_6$ GUT. These new fermions are vectorlike\nunder the SM gauge group but chiral under new U(1)$^\\prime$, and their masses\ncome entirely from the nonzero vacuum expectation value of $\\Phi$ through the\nYukawa interactions. Then, the CP-even scalar $h_\\Phi$ from $\\Phi$ can be\nproduced at the LHC by the gluon fusion and decay to the diphoton via the\none-loop diagram involving the extra quarks and leptons, and can be identified\nas the origin of diphoton excess at 750 GeV. In this model, $h_\\Phi$ can decay\ninto a pair of dark matter particles as well as a pair of scalar bosons,\nthereby a few tens of the decay width may be possible.\n", "  Very recently we proposed a predictive 2 Higgs Doublet Model with $S_{3}$\nflavour symmetry that successfully accounts for fermion masses and mixings. In\nthis letter, motivated by the $750$ GeV Higgs diphoton resonance recently\nreported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we modify this model by adding\nexotic top partners with electric charge $\\frac{5}{3}$ and a electrically\ncharged scalar singlet. These exotic top partners decay into a charged scalar\nsinglet and the SM up type quarks, whereas the charged scalar singlet will\nmainly decay into SM up and down type quarks. This simple modification enables\nour model to successfully account for the Higgs diphoton excess at\n$750\\,\\text{GeV}$ provided that the exotic quark masses are in the range\n$[1,2]$ TeV, for $O(1)$ exotic quark Yukawa couplings.\n", "  To understand the influence of transboundary secondary organic aerosol (SOA)\nin the urban air of Fukuoka, we conducted simultaneous field studies in\nDecember 2010 and March 2012 on Fukue Island and in the city of Fukuoka,\nrepresenting a rural and an urban sites of western Japan. During the studies,\norganic aerosol in PM1.0 was analyzed by aerosol mass spectrometers.\nIndependently, airborne total suspended particulate matter (TSP) was collected\non filters, and low-volatile water soluble organic carbon (LV-WSOC) extracted\nfrom the TSP samples was analyzed by an elemental analyzer coupled with a high\nprecision isotope ratio mass spectrometer for its concentration and stable\ncarbon isotope ratio (d13C). Plots of LV-WSOC concentrations versus m/z 44\nconcentrations for the study in December 2010 showed high correlations (r2 >\n0.85), but different slopes between the two sites (0.58 microg microgC-1 at\nFukuoka and 0.22 microg microgC-1 at Fukue), indicating additional contribution\nof m/z 44 from local sources. Because of this complex composition, evaluation\nof transboundary SOA was unsuccessful in this case study. In contrast,\ncomparison of LV-WSOC concentrations with the m/z 44 concentrations during the\nstudy in March 2012 showed high correlations (r2 > 0.91) with similar slopes\n(0.3 microg microgC-1) at both sites, indicating predominance of transboundary\nLV-WSOC. Furthermore, the plot of d13C of LV-WSOC as a function of m/z 44\nfraction showed a systematic increasing trend, indicating SOA. These findings\nsuggest that the observed LV-WSOC and m/z 44 in the Fukuoka air were\npredominated by transboundary SOA in this case study.\n", "  The evolution of the perturbations in the energy density and the particle\nnumber density in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe in the\nradiation-dominated era and in the epoch after decoupling of matter and\nradiation is studied. For large-scale perturbations the outcome is in\naccordance with treatments in the literature. For small-scale perturbations the\ndifferences are conspicuous. Firstly, in the radiation-dominated era\nsmall-scale perturbations grew proportional to the square root of time.\nSecondly, perturbations in the Cold Dark Matter particle number density were,\ndue to gravitation, coupled to perturbations in the total energy density. This\nimplies that structure formation could have begun successfully only after\ndecoupling of matter and radiation. Finally, after decoupling density\nperturbations evolved diabatically, i.e., they exchanged heat with their\nenvironment. This heat exchange may have enhanced the growth rate of their mass\nsufficiently to explain structure formation in the early universe, a phenomenon\nwhich cannot be understood from adiabatic density perturbations.\n", "  We study Majorana bound states in a disordered chain of semiconductor quantum\ndots proximity-coupled to an s-wave superconductor. By calculating its\ntopological quantum number, based on the scattering-matrix method and a\ntight-binding model, we can identify the topological property of such an\ninhomogeneous one-dimensional system. We study the robustness of Majorana bound\nstates against disorder in both the spin-independent terms (including the\nchemical potential and the regular spin-conserving hopping) and the\nspin-dependent term, i.e., the spin-flip hopping due to the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. We find that the Majorana bound states are not completely immune to\nthe spin-independent disorder, especially when the latter is strong. Meanwhile,\nthe Majorana bound states are relatively robust against spin-dependent\ndisorder, as long as the spin-flip hopping is of uniform sign (i.e., the\nvarying spin-flip hopping term does not change its sign along the chain).\nNevertheless, when the disorder induces sign-flip in spin-flip hopping, the\ntopological-nontopological phase transition takes place in the\nlow-chemical-potential region.\n", "  We present the holographic computation of the boundary two-point correlator\nusing the GKPW prescription for a scalar field in the AdS$_3$ space with a\nconical defect. Generally speaking, a conical defect breaks conformal\ninvariance in the dual theory, however we calculate the classical Green\nfunctions for a scalar field in the bulk with conical defect and use them to\ncompute the two-point correlator in the boundary theory. We compare the\nobtained general expression with previous studies based on the geodesic\napproximation. They are in good agreement for short correlators, and main\ndiscrepancy comes in the region of long correlations. Meanwhile, in case of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_r$-orbifold, the GKPW result coincides with the one obtained via\ngeodesic images prescription and with the general result for the boundary\ntheory, which is conformal in this special case.\n", "  Previous studies have suggested a crossover from superdiffusive to normal\nheat transport in one-dimensional (1D) anharmonic oscillator systems with a\ndouble-well type interatomic interaction like $V(\\xi)=-\\xi^2/2+\\xi^4/4$, when\nthe system temperature is varied. In order to better understand this unusual\nmanner of thermal transport, here we perform a direct dynamics simulation to\nexamine how the spreading processes of the three physical quantities, i.e., the\nheat, the total energy and the momentum, would depend on temperature. We find\nthree main points that are worth noting: (i) The crossover from superdiffusive\nto normal heat transport is well verified from a new perspective of heat\nspread; (ii) The spreading of the total energy is found to be very distinct\nfrom heat diffusion, especially that under some temperature regimes, energy is\nstrongly localized, while heat can be superdiffusive. So one should take care\nto derive a general connection between the heat conduction and energy\ndiffusion; (iii) In a narrow range of temperatures, the spreading of momentum\nimplies clear unusual non-ballistic behaviors; however, such unusual transport\nof momentum cannot be directly related to the normal transport of heat. An\nanalysis of phonons spectra suggests that one should also take the effects of\nphonons softening into account. All of these results may provide insights into\nestablishing the connection between the macroscopic heat transport and the\nunderlying dynamics in 1D systems.\n", "  The description of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the\nrealistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear\nphysics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-,\nthree- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the\nquantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound\nand continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab\ninitio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from\nQCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory.\nAfter a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches\n- built upon the No-Core Shell Model - that are capable of simultaneously\ndescribing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for\nresonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion\nresearch. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the\n$^6$He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation\nof the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of $^9$Be.\nFurther, we discuss applications to the $^7$Be$(p,\\gamma)^8$B radiative\ncapture. Finally, we highlight our efforts to describe transfer reactions\nincluding the $^3$H$(d,n)^4$He fusion.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics and transient dynamics of the (unbiased)\nOhmic two-state system by exploiting the equivalence of this model to the\ninteracting resonant level model. For the thermodynamics, we show, by using the\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) method, how the universal specific heat\nand susceptibility curves evolve with increasing dissipation strength,\n$\\alpha$, from those of an isolated two-level system at vanishingly small\ndissipation strength, with the characteristic activated-like behavior in this\nlimit, to those of the isotropic Kondo model in the limit $\\alpha\\to 1^{-}$.\nFor the transient dynamics of the two-level system, $P(t)=\\langle\n\\sigma_{z}(t)\\rangle$, with initial-state preparation $P(t\\leq0)=+1$, we apply\nthe time-dependent extension of the NRG (TDNRG) to the interacting resonant\nlevel model, and compare the results obtained with those from the\nnoninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), the functional renormalization group\n(FRG), and the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG).\nWe demonstrate excellent agreement on short to intermediate time scales between\nTDNRG and TD-DMRG for $0\\lesssim\\alpha \\lesssim 0.9$ for $P(t)$, and between\nTDNRG and FRG in the vicinity of $\\alpha=1/2$. Furthermore, we quantify the\nerror in the NIBA for a range of $\\alpha$, finding significant errors in the\nlatter even for $0.1\\leq \\alpha\\leq 0.4$. We also briefly discuss why the\nlong-time errors in the present formulation of the TDNRG prevents an\ninvestigation of the crossover between coherent and incoherent dynamics. Our\nresults for $P(t)$ at short to intermediate times could act as useful\nbenchmarks for the development of new techniques to simulate the transient\ndynamics of spin-boson problems.\n", "  We report on a general method for the rapid production of quantum degenerate\ngases. Using 174Yb, we achieve an experimental cycle time as low as (1.6-1.8) s\nfor the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of (0.5-1) x 10^5 atoms.\nWhile laser cooling to 30\\muK proceeds in a standard way, evaporative cooling\nis highly optimized by performing it in an optical trap that is dynamically\nshaped by utilizing the time-averaged potential of a single laser beam moving\nrapidly in one dimension. We also produce large (>10^6) atom number BECs and\nsuccessfully model the evaporation dynamics over more than three orders of\nmagnitude in phase space density. Our method provides a simple and general\napproach to solving the problem of long production times of quantum degenerate\ngases.\n", "  We investigate how the combination of nonequilibrium effects and material\nproperties impacts on the Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a\nsurface. By addressing systems with temperature inhomogeneities and laser\ninteractions, we show that nonmonotonous energetic landscapes can be produced\nwhere barriers and minima appear. Our treatment provides a self-consistent\nquantum theoretical framework for investigating the properties of a class of\nnonequilibrium atom-surface interactions.\n", "  The recently discovered $C_4$ tetragonal magnetic phase in hole-doped members\nof the iron-based superconductors provides new insights into the origin of\nunconventional superconductivity. Previously observed in\nBa$_{1-x}A_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (with $A =$ K, Na), the $C_4$ magnetic phase exists\nwithin the well studied $C_2$ spin-density wave (SDW) dome, arising just before\nthe complete suppression of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order but after the onset\nof superconductivity. Here, we present detailed x-ray and neutron diffraction\nstudies of Sr$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($0.10 \\leq\\ x \\leq\\ 0.60$) to\ndetermine their structural evolution and the extent of the $C_4$ phase.\nSpanning $\\Delta x\\sim 0.14$ in composition, the $C_4$ phase is found to extend\nover a larger range of compositions, and to exhibit a significantly higher\ntransition temperature, $T_r \\sim 65$K, than in either of the other systems in\nwhich it has been observed. The onset of this phase is seen near a composition\n($x \\sim 0.30$) where the bonding angles of the Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers approach\nthe perfect $109.46^\\circ$ tetrahedral angle. We discuss the possible role of\nthis return to a higher symmetry environment for the magnetic iron site in\ntriggering the magnetic reorientation and the coupled re-entrance to the\ntetragonal structure. Finally, we present a new phase diagram, complete with\nthe $C_4$ phase, and use its observation in a third hole-doped 122 system to\nsuggest the universality of this phase.\n", "  We present results on the rates of interlayer energy transfer between\nexcitons in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We\nconsider both radiative (mediated by real photons) and non-radiative (mediated\nby virtual photons) mechanisms of energy transfer using a unified Green's\nfunction approach that takes into account modification of the exciton energy\ndispersions as a result of interactions. The large optical oscillator strengths\nassociated with excitons in TMDs result in very fast energy transfer rates. The\nenergy transfer times depend on the exciton momentum, exciton linewidth, and\nthe interlayer separation and can range from values less than 100 femtoseconds\nto more than tens of picoseconds. Whereas inside the light cone the energy\ntransfer rates of longitudinal and transverse excitons are comparable, outside\nthe light cone the energy transfer rates of longitudinal excitons far exceed\nthose of transverse excitons. Average energy transfer times for a thermal\nensemble of longitudinal and transverse excitons is temperature dependent and\ncan be smaller than a picosecond at room temperature for interlayer separations\nsmaller than 10 nm. Energy transfer times of localized excitons range from\nvalues less than a picosecond to several tens of picoseconds. When the exciton\nscattering and dephasing rates are small, energy transfer dynamics exhibit\ncoherent oscillations. Our results show that electromagnetic interlayer energy\ntransfer can be an efficient mechanism for energy exchange between TMD\nmonolayers.\n", "  We present an asymptotically exact renormalization-group theory of the\nsuperfluid--insulator transition in one-dimensional disordered systems, with\nemphasis on an accurate description of the interplay between the\nGiamarchi--Schulz (instanton--anti-instanton) and weak-link (scratched-XY)\ncriticalities. Combining the theory with extensive quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations allows us to shed new light on the ground-state phase diagram of\nthe one-dimensional disordered Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling.\n", "  We consider here the interaction of scalar bosons with a topological domain\nwall. Not only is there a continuum of scattering states, but there is also an\ninteresting \"quasi-discretuum\" of positive energy bosonic bound states,\ndescribing bosons entrapped within the wall's core. The full spectrum of the\nscattering and bound state energies and eigenstates is obtainable from a\nSchr\\\"odinger-type of equation with a P\\\"oschl-Teller potential. We also\nconsider the presence of a boson gas within the wall and high energy boson\nemission.\n", "  This is a contribution paper from the Double Chooz experiment to the special\nissue of NPB on neutrino oscillations. The physics and a history of the reactor\ntheta13 experiments, as well as Double Chooz experiment and its neutrino\noscillation analyses are reviewed.\n", "  We study a charge two-channel Kondo model, demonstrating that recent\nexperiments [Iftikhar et al, Nature 526, 233 (2015)] realize an essentially\nperfect quantum simulation -- not just of its universal physics, but also\nnonuniversal effects away from the scaling limit. Numerical renormalization\ngroup (NRG) calculations yield conductance lineshapes encoding RG flow to a\ncritical point involving a free Majorana fermion. By mimicking the experimental\nprotocol, the experimental curve is reproduced quantitatively over 9 orders of\nmagnitude, although we show that far greater bandwidth/temperature separation\nis required to obtain the universal result. Fermi liquid instabilities are also\nstudied: In particular, our exact analytic results for non-linear conductance\nprovide predictions away from thermal equilibrium, in the regime of existing\nexperiments.\n", "  We present the optical spectroscopic study based on 41 spectra of 4 Her and\n32 spectra of 88 Her, obtained over a period of 6 months. We estimate the\nrotational velocity of these stars from He{\\sc i} lines in the blue spectral\nregion (4000--4500 \\AA). We find that these stars are likely to be rotating at\na fractional critical rotation of $\\sim$ 0.80. We measure the average $I_p/I_c$\nratio to quantify the strength of the H$\\alpha$ line and obtain 1.63 for 4 Her\nand 2.06 for 88 Her. The radius of the H$\\alpha$ emission region is estimated\nto be $R_d/R_*$ $\\sim$ 5.0, assuming a Keplerian disk. These stars are thus\nfound to be fast rotators with relatively small H$\\alpha$ emission region. We\ndetect V/R variation of H$\\alpha$ spectral line during the observed period. We\nre-estimate the periods for both the stars and obtain two periods of $\\sim$ 46\ndays and its harmonic of 23.095 days for 4 Her and $\\sim$ 86 days for 88 Her.\nAs these two are shell stars with binaries and have low H$\\alpha$ EW with the\nemission region closer to the central star, the V/R variation and a change in\nperiod may be an effect of the binary on the circumstellar disk.\n", "  We study new consistent scalar-tensor theories of gravity recently introduced\nby Langlois and Noui with potentially interesting cosmological applications. We\nderive the conditions for the existence of a primary constraint that prevents\nthe propagation of an additional dangerous mode associated with higher order\nequations of motion. We then classify the most general, consistent\nscalar-tensor theories that are at most quadratic in the second derivatives of\nthe scalar field. In addition, we investigate the possible connection between\nthese theories and (beyond) Horndeski through conformal and disformal\ntransformations. Finally, we point out that these theories can be associated\nwith new operators in the effective field theory of dark energy, which might\nopen up new possibilities to test dark energy models in future surveys.\n", "  We investigate the thermal transport properties of a temperature-biased\nJosephson tunnel junction composed of two different superconductors. We show\nthat this simple system can provide a large negative differential thermal\nconductance (NDTC) with a peak-to-valley ratio of $\\sim 3$ in the transmitted\nelectronic heat current. The NDTC is then exploited to outline the caloritronic\nanalogue of the tunnel diode, which can exhibit a modulation of the output\ntemperature as large as 80 mK at a bath temperature of 50 mK. Moreover, this\ndevice may work in a regime of thermal hysteresis that can be used to store\ninformation as a thermal memory. On the other hand, the NDTC effect offers the\nopportunity to conceive two different designs of a thermal transistor, which\nmight operate as a thermal switch or as an amplifier/modulator. The latter\nshows a heat amplification factor $>1$ in a 500-mK-wide working region of the\ngate temperature. After the successful realization of heat interferometers and\nthermal diodes, this kind of structures would complete the conversion of the\nmost important electronic devices in their thermal counterparts, breaking\nground for coherent caloritronics nanocircuits where heat currents can be\nmanipulated at will.\n", "  Transient chaos is an ubiquitous phenomenon characterizing the dynamics of\nphase space trajectories evolving towards a steady state attractor in physical\nsystems as diverse as fluids, chemical reactions and condensed matter systems.\nHere we show that transient chaos also appears in the dynamics of certain\nefficient algorithms searching for solutions of constraint satisfaction\nproblems that include scheduling, circuit design, routing, database problems or\neven Sudoku. In particular, we present a study of the emergence of hardness in\nBoolean satisfiability ($k$-SAT), a canonical class of constraint satisfaction\nproblems, by using an analog deterministic algorithm based on a system of\nordinary differential equations. Problem hardness is defined through the escape\nrate $\\kappa$, an invariant measure of transient chaos of the dynamical system\ncorresponding to the analog algorithm, and it expresses the rate at which the\ntrajectory approaches a solution.We show that for a given density of\nconstraints and fixed number of Boolean variables $N$, the hardness of formulas\nin random $k$-SAT ensembles has a wide variation, approximable by a lognormal\ndistribution. We also show that when increasing the density of constraints\n$\\alpha$, hardness appears through a second-order phase transition at\n$\\alpha_{\\chi}$ in the random 3-SAT ensemble where dynamical trajectories\nbecome transiently chaotic. A similar behavior is found in 4-SAT as well,\nhowever, such transition does not occur for 2-SAT. This behavior also implies a\nnovel type of transient chaos in which the escape rate has an\nexponential-algebraic dependence on the critical parameter $\\kappa \\sim\nN^{B|\\alpha - \\alpha_{\\chi}|^{1-\\gamma}}$ with $0< \\gamma < 1$. We demonstrate\nthat the transition is generated by the appearance of metastable basins in the\nsolution space as the density of constraints $\\alpha$ is increased.\n", "  We study solitary waves of polarization (magnetic solitons) in a\ntwo-component Bose gas with slightly unequal repulsive intra- and interspin\ninteractions. In experimentally relevant conditions we obtain an analytical\nsolution which reveals that the width and the velocity of magnetic solitons are\nexplicitly related to the spin healing length and the spin sound velocity of\nthe Bose mixture, respectively. We calculate the profiles, the energy and the\neffective mass of the solitons in the absence of external fields and\ninvestigate their oscillation in a harmonic trap where the oscillation period\nis calculated as a function of the oscillation amplitude. The stability of\nmagnetic solitons in two dimensions and the conditions for their experimental\nobservation are also briefly discussed.\n", "  We manipulate the transient terahertz (THz) waves emitted from metal-graphite\ninterfaces, where potential barriers were formed because of work function\ndifferences. To adaptively control the phase of the THz waves, two distinct\ngroups of metals were evaporated on n-type doped highly oriented pyrolytic\ngraphite (HOPG): group A, which consisted of Pt, Au, and Ag with work functions\nlarger than that of HOPG and group B, which consisted of Al and Ti with work\nfunctions smaller than that of HOPG. The phase of the transient THz lineshapes\nfrom group A was opposite to that of group B under infrared laser excitation,\nwhich is indicative of opposite band bending and concomitant interfacial doping\nfor ambipolar transport at the metal-graphite junctions. The amplitude of the\nTHz waves could be further substantiated by the work function differences and\nmodified minority carrier mobilities at the depletion regions.\n", "  We propose a new analytical method to study stochastic, binary-state models\non complex networks. Moving beyond the usual mean-field theories, this\nalternative approach is based on the introduction of an annealed approximation\nfor uncorrelated networks, allowing to deal with the network structure as\nparametric heterogeneity. As an illustration, we study the noisy voter model, a\nmodification of the original voter model including random changes of state. The\nproposed method is able to unfold the dependence of the model not only on the\nmean degree (the mean-field prediction) but also on more complex averages over\nthe degree distribution. In particular, we find that the degree heterogeneity\n---variance of the underlying degree distribution--- has a strong influence on\nthe location of the critical point of a noise-induced, finite-size transition\noccurring in the model, on the local ordering of the system, and on the\nfunctional form of its temporal correlations. Finally, we show how this latter\npoint opens the possibility of inferring the degree heterogeneity of the\nunderlying network by observing only the aggregate behavior of the system as a\nwhole, an issue of interest for systems where only macroscopic, population\nlevel variables can be measured.\n", "  We employ a rotating frame of reference to elucidate high-harmonic generation\nof circularly polarized light by bicircular driving fields. In particular, we\nshow how the experimentally observed circular components of the high-harmonic\nspectrum can be directly related to the corresponding quantities in the\nrotating frame. Supported by numerical simulations of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, we deduce an optimal strategy for maximizing the\ncutoff in the high-harmonic plateau while keeping the two circular components\nof the emitted light spectrally distinct. Moreover, we show how the\nrotating-frame picture can be more generally employed for elliptical drivers.\nFinally, we point out how circular and elliptical driving fields show a\nnear-duality to static electric and static magnetic fields in a rotating-frame\ndescription. This demonstrates how high-harmonic generation of circularly\npolarized light under static electromagnetic fields can be emulated in practice\neven at static field strengths beyond current experimental capabilities.\n", "  We present the first search for the rare decay of $\\eta^\\prime$ into\n$K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ in $J/\\psi\\to\\phi\\eta^{\\prime}$, using a sample of\n$1.3\\times10^{9}$ $J/\\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector. No\nsignificant signal is observed, and the upper limit at the 90\\% confidence\nlevel for the ratio $\\frac{{\\cal B}(\\eta^{\\prime}\\to K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp})}{{\\cal\nB}(\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\gamma\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-})}$ is determined to be\n$1.3\\times10^{-4}$. In addition, we report the measurement of the branching\nfraction of $J/\\psi\\to\\phi\\eta^{\\prime}$ to be\n$(5.10\\pm0.03(\\text{stat.})\\pm0.32(\\text{syst.}))\\times10^{-4}$, which agrees\nwith previous results from BESII.\n", "  The transfer of data is a fundamental task in information systems.\nMicroprocessors contain dedicated data buses that transmit bits across\ndifferent locations and implement sophisticated routing protocols. Transferring\nquantum information with high fidelity is a challenging task, due to the\nintrinsic fragility of quantum states. We report on the implementation of the\nperfect state transfer protocol applied to a photonic qubit entangled with\nanother qubit at a different location. On a single device we perform three\nrouting procedures on entangled states with an average fidelity of 97.1%. Our\nprotocol extends the regular perfect state transfer by maintaining quantum\ninformation encoded in the polarisation state of the photonic qubit. Our\nresults demonstrate the key principle of perfect state transfer, opening a\nroute toward data transfer for quantum computing systems.\n", "  Compact groups provide an environment to study the growth of galaxies amid\nmultiple prolonged interactions. With their dense galaxy concentrations and\nrelatively low velocity dispersions, compact groups mimic the conditions of\nhierarchical galaxy assembly. Compact group galaxies are known to show a\nbimodality in $Spitzer$ IRAC infrared colorspace: galaxies are preferentially\neither quiescent with low specific star formation rates, or are prolifically\nforming stars---galaxies with moderate levels of specific star formation are\nrare. Previous $Spitzer$ IRAC studies identifying this \"canyon\" have been\nlimited by small number statistics. We utilize whole-sky WISE data to study 163\ncompact groups, thereby tripling our previous sample and including more\ngalaxies with intermediate mid-IR colors indicative of moderate specific star\nformation rates (SSFRs). We define a distinct WISE mid-IR color-space\n($\\log[{\\frac{\\rm f_{12}}{\\rm f_{4.6}}}]$ vs. $\\log[{\\frac{\\rm f_{22}}{\\rm\nf_{3.4}}}]$) that we use to identify canyon galaxies from the larger sample. We\nconfirm that compact group galaxies show a bimodal distribution in the\nmid-infrared and identify 37 canyon galaxies with reliable photometry and\nintermediate mid-IR colors. Morphologically, we find that the canyon harbors a\nlarge population of both Sa-Sbc and E/S0 type galaxies, and that they fall on\nthe optical red sequence rather than the green valley. Finally, we provide a\ncatalog of WISE photometry for 567 of 652 galaxies selected from the sample of\n163 compact groups.\n", "  Ultralight scalar dark matter with mass at or below the eV scale and pressure\nfrom repulsive self-interaction could form a Bose-Einstein condensate in the\nearly Universe and maybe in galaxies as well. It has been suggested to be a\npossible solution to the cusp/core problem or even to explain MOND\nphenomenology. In this paper, I initiate a study of possible self-interactions\nof ultralight scalar dark matter from the particle physics point of view. To\nprotect its mass, the scalar dark matter is identified as a pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). Quite a few pNGB models with different potentials\nsuch as the QCD axion and the dilaton lead to attractive self-interactions. Yet\nif an axion is a remnant of a 5D gauged U(1) symmetry, its self-interactions\ncould be repulsive provided the masses and charges of the 5D matter\ncontributing to its potential satisfy certain constraints. Collective symmetry\nbreaking could also lead to a repulsive self-interaction yet with too large a\nstrength that is ruled out by Bullet Cluster constraints. I also discuss\ncosmological and astrophysical constraints on ultralight repulsive dark matter\nin terms of a parametrization motivated by particle physics considerations.\n", "  It is well known that random bipartite pure states are typically maximally\nentangled within an arbitrarily small error. Showing that the marginals of\nrandom bipartite pure states are typically extremely close to the maximally\nmixed state, is a way to prove the above. However, a more direct way to prove\nthe above is to estimate the distance of random bipartite pure states from the\nset of maximally entangled states. Here, we find the average distance between a\nrandom bipartite pure state and the set of maximally entanglement states as\nquantified by three different quantifiers of the distance and investigate the\ntypical properties of the same. We then consider random pure states of a single\nquantum system and give an account of the typicality of the average $l_1$ norm\nof coherence for these states scaled by the maximum value of the $l_1$ norm of\ncoherence. We also calculate the variance of the $l_1$ norm of coherence of\nrandom pure states to elaborate more on the typical nature of the scaled\naverage $l_1$ norm of coherence. Moreover, We compute the distance of a random\npure state from the set of maximally coherent states and obtain the average\ndistance.\n", "  A complete structural solution of the bilayer iridate compound Sr3Ir2O7\npresently remains outstanding. Previously reported structures for this compound\nvary and all fail to explain weak structural violations observed in neutron\nscattering measurements as well as the presence of a net ferromagnetic moment\nin the basal plane. In this paper, we present single crystal neutron\ndiffraction and rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation measurements\nunveiling a lower, monoclinic symmetry inherent to Sr3Ir2O7 . Combined with\ndensity functional theory, our measurements identify the correct structural\nspace group as No. 15 (C2/c) and provide clarity regarding the local symmetry\nof Ir 4+ cations within this spin-orbit Mott material.\n", "  The strong light-field effect of (TMTTF)2AsF6 was investigated utilizing\n1.5-cycle, 7-fs infrared pulses. The ultarfast (20 fs) and large (40%) response\nof the plasma-like reflectivity edge (0.7 eV) was analyzed by the changes in\nomega_p=sqrt(ne2/(epsilon_0*epsilon(infty)*m)} (n: number of charges in the 1/4\nfilled-band, m: mass of charge, epsilon(infty): dielectric constants for\nhigh-frequency and vacuum, e: elementary charge). The 3% reduction in omega_p\nis attributed to the 6% increase in m. Furthermore, 20 fs oscillation of\nomega_p in the time domain indicates that the plasma-like edge is affected by\nthe charge gap (0.2 eV) nature. Theoretical calculations suggest that the\nCoulomb repulsion plays an important role in the increase in m.\n", "  The exceptional electronic properties of monoatomic thin graphene sheets\ntriggered numerous original transport concepts, pushing quantum physics into\nthe realm of device technology for electronics, optoelectronics and\nthermoelectrics. At the conceptual pivot point is the particular twodimensional\nmassless Dirac fermion character of graphene charge carriers and its volitional\nmodification by intrinsic or extrinsic means. Here, interfaces between\ndifferent electronic and structural graphene modifications promise exciting\nphysics and functionality, in particular when fabricated with atomic precision.\nIn this study we show that quasiperiodic modulations of doping levels can be\nimprinted down to the nanoscale in monolayer graphene sheets. Vicinal copper\nsurfaces allow to alternate graphene carrier densities by several 10^13\ncarriers per cm^2 along a specific copper high-symmetry direction. The process\nis triggered by a self-assembled copper faceting process during\nhigh-temperature graphene chemical vapor deposition, which defines interfaces\nbetween different graphene doping levels at the atomic level.\n", "  In the existing literature various numerical techniques have been developed\nto quantize the confined harmonic oscillator in higher dimensions. In obtaining\nthe energy eigenvalues, such methods often involve indirect approaches such as\nsearching for the roots of hypergeometric functions or numerically solving a\ndifferential equation. In this paper, however, we derive an explicit matrix\nrepresentation for the Hamiltonian of a confined quantum harmonic oscillator in\nhigher dimensions, thus facilitating direct diagonalization.\n", "  We modify the propagation for the quarks and gluons, with that we have finite\nresults, without ultra violet divergence in perturbed interaction of the quarks\nand gluons, this makes it easily for the interaction renormalization, like the\nself energy. Then we search for a way to remove our modification, with fixing\nthe Lagrange parameters. so we can ignore our modification. We relate the\nmodification to interaction situation, this is, we need it only for interaction\nrenormalization. we see for the free the modification is removed. then We try\nto give the modification terms modification physical aspects, for this we see\nthe corresponding terms in the Lagrange. To do that we find the role of those\nterms in the Feynman diagrams, in self energies, quarks gluons vertex. We see\nwe can relate the propagation modification to fields dual behavior, pairing\nparticle with antiparticle appears as scalar particles with high mass. For the\nquarks we can interrupt these particles as pions.\n", "  Recent experiments on Zn-substituted 122-type iron-based superconductors\n(FeSCs) at electron- and hole- doped region provide us with a testing ground\nfor understanding the effect of Zn impurities in these systems. Our\nfirst-principle calculations of the electronic structure reveal that the Zn 3d\norbitals are far below the Fermi level and chemically inactive, while the Zn\n4s-orbital is partially occupied and its wave function overlapping with those\n3d-orbitals of neighboring Fe-ions. This suggests that the impurity effect is\noriginating in the Zn 4s-orbital, not its 3d-orbitals. Employing a\nphenomenological two-orbital lattice model for 122-FeSCs and the\nself-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we study how the Zn-impurities\nsuppress the superconductivity in electron- and hole- doped compounds. Our\nobtained results qualitatively agree with the experimental measurements.\n", "  We derive the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation in the framework of the\nelectrodynamic theory associated with Stueckelberg manifestly covariant\ncanonical mechanics. In this framework, a particle worldline is traced out\nthrough the evolution of an event $x^\\mu(\\tau)$. By admitting unconstrained\ncommutation relations between the positions and velocities, the associated\nelectromagnetic gauge fields are in general dependent on the parameter $\\tau$,\nwhich plays the role of time in Newtonian mechanics. Standard Maxwell theory\nemerges from this system as a $\\tau$-independent equilibrium limit. In this\npaper, we calculate the $\\tau$-dependent field induced by an arbitrarily\nevolving event, and study the long-range radiation part, which is seen to be an\non-shell plane wave of the Maxwell type. Following Dirac's method, we obtain an\nexpression for the finite part of the self-interaction, which leads to the ALD\nequation that generalizes the Lorentz force. This third-order differential\nequation is then converted to an integro-differential equation, identical to\nthe standard Maxwell expression, except for the $\\tau$-dependence of the field.\nBy studying this $\\tau$-dependence in detail, we show that field can be removed\nfrom the integration, so that the Lorentz force depends only on the\ninstantaneous external field and an integral over dynamical variables of the\nevent evolution. In this form, pre-acceleration of the event by future values\nof the field is not present.\n", "  In this paper, we study fundamental aspects of electrostatics as a special\ncase in Stueckelberg-Horwitz electromagnetic theory. In this theory, spacetime\nevents $x^\\mu(\\tau)$ evolve in an unconstrained 8-dimensional phase space,\ninteracting through five $\\tau$-dependent gauge fields induced by the current\ndensities associated with their evolutions. The chronological time $\\tau$ was\nintroduced as an independent evolution parameter in order to free the\nlaboratory clock $x^0$ to evolve alternately 'forward' and 'backward' in time\naccording to the sign of the energy, thus providing a classical implementation\nof the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of pair creation/annihilation. The\nresulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from conventional\nelectromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an equilibrium limit.\n  After a brief review of Stueckelberg-Horwitz electrodynamics, we obtain the\nfield produced by an event in uniform motion and verify that it satisfies the\nfield equations. We study this field in the rest frame of the event, where it\ndepends explicitly on coordinate time $x^0$ and the parameter $\\tau$, as well\nas spatial distance $R$. Calculating with this generalized Coulomb field, we\ndemonstrate how Gauss's theorem and Stoke's theorem apply in 4D spacetime, and\nobtain the fields associated with a charged line and a charged sheet. Finally,\nwe use the field of the charged sheet to study a static event in the vicinity\nof a potential barrier. In all of these cases, we observe a small transfer of\nmass from the field to the particle. It is seen that for an event in the field\nof an oppositely charged sheet of sufficient density, the event can reverse\ntime direction, providing a specific model for pair phenomena.\n", "  In the context of Stueckelberg's covariant symplectic mechanics, Horwitz and\nAharonovich have proposed a simple mechanism by which a particle traveling\nbelow light speed almost everywhere may exhibit a transit time that suggests\nsuperluminal motion. This mechanism, which requires precise measurement of the\nparticle velocity, involves a subtle perturbation affecting the particle's\nrecorded time coordinate caused by virtual pair processes. The Stueckelberg\nframework is particularly well suited to such problems, because it permits pair\ncreation/annihilation at the classical level. In this paper, we study a\ntrajectory of the type proposed by Horwitz and Aharonovich, and derive the\nMaxwell 4-vector potential associated with the motion. We show that the\nresulting fields carry a signature associated with the apparent superluminal\nmotion, providing an independent test for the mechanism that does not require\ndirect observation of the trajectory, except at the detector.\n", "  It is well-known that the 5D gauge structure of Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron\n(SHP) electrodynamics permits the exchange of mass between particles and the\nfields induced by their motion, even at the classical level. This phenomenon\npresents two closely related problems: (1) What accounts for the stability of\nthe measured masses of the known particles? (2) Under what circumstances can\nreal particles evolve sufficiently off-shell to account for mass changing\nphenomena such as flavor-changing neutrino interactions and low energy nuclear\nreactions? To approach these questions, we introduce a constant $c_5$\nassociated with the invariant time $\\tau$, in analogy with the constant $c$\nthat associates a unit of length with intervals of time $t$ in standard\nrelativity. It follows that electromagnetic mass exchange can be a small\neffect, in proportion to $c_5 / c$. We show that this structure permits a\nclassical self-interaction that tends to restore on-shell propagation. Finally\nwe propose a model in which a particle evolving through a complex charged\nenvironment can acquire a significant mass shift for a short time.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium steady states that emerge when two interacting\nthree-dimensional Potts blocks slide on each other. As at equilibrium the Potts\nmodel exhibits different types of phase transitions for different numbers $q$\nof spin states, we consider the following three cases: $q=2$ (i.e. the Ising\ncase), $q=3$, and $q=9$, which at equilibrium yield respectively a second order\nphase transition, a weak first order transition and a strong first order\ntransition. In our study we focus on the anisotropic character of the steady\nstates that result from the relative motion and discuss the change in\nfinite-size signatures when changing the number $q$ of spin states.\n", "  During the laser drilling process the recoil pressure drives melt flow and\naffects the heat transfer and material removal rate. To get a more realistic\npicture of the melt flow, a series of differential equations are formulated\nhere that govern the process from pre-heating to melting and evaporation. In\nparticular, the Navier-Stokes equation governing the melt flow is solved with\nthe use of the boundary layer theory and integral methods. Heat conduction in\nsolid is investigated by using the classical method with the corrections that\nreflect the change in boundary condition from the constant heat flux to Stefan\ncondition. The dependence of saturation temperature on the vapor pressure is\ntaken into account by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Both constantly\nrising radial velocity profiles and rising-fall velocity profiles are\nconsidered. The proposed approach is compared with existing ones. In spite of\nthe assumed varying velocity profiles, the proposed model predicts that the\ndrilling hole profiles are very close to each other in a specific super alloy\nfor given laser beam intensity and pulse duration. The numerical results show\nthat the effect of melt flow on material removal can be ignored in some cases.\nThe findings obtained from the current work provide a better understanding of\nthe effects of melt flow and vaporization on the laser drilling profile\nevolution, and could improve the solid material removal efficiency.\n", "  In order to find a measure of the dynamical features of phase separation\nkinetics during spinodal decomposition of a liquid binary mixture (like water\nand cyclohexane , water and 2,6 lutidiene or methanol and cyclohexane), we\nstudy both the initial fast exponential-like growth (the Cahn-Hilliard regime)\nand the subsequent cross-over to a much slower, non-exponential long time\ngrowth (the so-called scaling regime), by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulation of a structure breaking binary liquid mixture. In particular, we\ncombine our MD simulations with a coarse grained multi scale modelling (CGMSM)\ncapable of capturing both length and time scales of phase separation kinetics\nwithin simulation box. The system is quenched from a higher temperature to two\nlower temperatures well below the coexistence temperature of the phase diagram.\nWe observe a multiscale phase separation dynamics. Initially the growth is\nexponential up to a regime of 80-100ps having strong dependence over quench\ndepth. Subsequently a cross-over regime appears where the dynamics slows down\nconsiderably due to coarsening through a power law phase. For deeper quench\npower law growth dominates over the initial exponential and the cross-over\nbecomes transient. We find that for the present parameter values for the binary\nmixture, the initial rapid growth of structure formation is practically over\nwithin 200 ps which is followed by slow structural coarsening. When scaled by\nthe respective viscosities, this time translates to 50-200 ns for\nwater-lutidine binary mixture. The last part of dynamics may extend into ms.\nThe dynamics of phase separation is slowest in regions that have equitable\ndistribution of the two species, and one can observe the signatures of \"up-hill\ndiffusion\" that is a trade mark of spinodal decomposition.\n", "  A new type of complex Hadamard matrices of order 9 are constructed. The\nstudied matrices are symmetric, block circulant with circulant blocks ($BCCB$)\nand form an until now unknown non-reducible and non-affine two-parameter orbit.\nSeveral suborbits are identified, including a one-parameter intersection with\nthe Fourier orbit $F_{9}^{(4)}$. The defect of this new type of Hadamard\nmatrices is observed to vary, from a generic value 2 to the anomalous values 4\nand 10 for some sub-orbits, and to 12 and 16 for some single matrices. The\nlatter matrices are shown to be related to complete sets of MUBs in dimension\n9.\n", "  Security of an ideal system for quantum key distribution can be formally\nproved. However, technological imperfections of real systems can be misused by\nan eavesdropper to get information about the key without causing a detectable\nchange in the error rate. An example of this is the blinding attack where the\neavesdropper manipulates detectors of the receiving party. To avoid such an\nattack, technical modifications of the device are usually required. In this\npaper we show that an extended measurement, similar to the Bell test\nmeasurement, can reveal the blinding attack without any modification of the\ndevice.\n", "  In the framework of solid-state cooling technology, four kinds of caloric\neffects, magnetocaloric (MC), electrocaloric (EC), barocaloric (BC) and\nelastocaloric (eC) effects, are compared in view of environment discussion and\napplication fields. This field is primarily developed in the intention of\nprotecting the environment. However, some widely researched caloric materials\ndo not meet environmental friendly criteria. Currently, new caloric materials\n(called \"good\" material) possessing the properties of friendly environment, low\ncost, high caloric performance and practicability (low stress) need to be\nfound. In view of application, all current caloric effects/materials are\ninvestigated for the common objective of cooling. However, the adapted\napplication cases for different caloric effects/materials are not considered.\nDue to the different stimuli and different intrinsic properties (different\ncaloric performance for different dimensions) of caloric materials, they can\nexhibit unique advantage to different application cases. \"Good\" caloric\nmaterial used for large-scale application is still less and deserve more\nsearch. Purposeful research will save the cost and accelerate the\ncommercialization.\n", "  We report a technique for transferring large areas of the CVD-grown,\nfew-layer MoS2 from the original substrate to another arbitrary substrate and\nonto holey substrates, in order to obtain free-standing structures. The method\nconsists of a polymer- and residue-free, surface-tension-assisted wet transfer,\nin which we take advantage of the hydrophobic properties of the MoS2. The\nmethods yields better quality transferred layers, with fewer cracks and\ndefects, and less contamination than the widely used PMMA-mediated transfer and\nallows fabrication of few-layer, fee-standing structures with diameters up to\n100 micro-m. We report thermal conductivity measurements by means of\ncontactless Raman thermometry on the so-fabricated samples. The measurements\nrevealed a strong reduction in the in-plane thermal conductivity down to 0.5\nW/mK. The results are explained using finite elements method simulations for a\npolycrystalline film.\n", "  Cardiovascular monitoring is important to prevent diseases from progressing.\nThe jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform offers important clinical information\nabout cardiac health, but is not routinely examined due to its invasive\ncatheterisation procedure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the JVP\ncan be consistently observed in a non-contact manner using a novel light-based\nphotoplethysmographic imaging system, coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI). While\ntraditional monitoring methods measure the JVP at a single location, CHI's\nwide-field imaging capabilities were able to observe the jugular venous pulse's\nspatial flow profile for the first time. The important inflection points in the\nJVP were observed, meaning that cardiac abnormalities can be assessed through\nJVP distortions. CHI provides a new way to assess cardiac health through\nnon-contact light-based JVP monitoring, and can be used in non-surgical\nenvironments for cardiac assessment.\n", "  Recently, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have pointed out the possible\nexistence of a new resonance with a mass around 750 GeV. We investigate the\npossibility to identify this new resonance with a spin zero field responsible\nfor the breaking of a new gauge symmetry. We focus on a simple theory where the\nbaryon number is a local symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale. In\nthis context new vector-like quarks are needed to cancel all baryonic anomalies\nand define the production mechanism and decays of the new Higgs at the LHC.\nAssuming the existence of the new Higgs with a mass of 750 GeV at the LHC we\nfind an upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale. Therefore, one expects that\na new force associated with baryon number could be discovered at the LHC.\n", "  The ability to exfoliate layered materials down to the single layer limit has\nopened the opportunity to understand how a gradual reduction in dimensionality\naffects the properties of bulk materials. Here we use this top-down approach to\naddress the problem of superconductivity in the two-dimensional limit. The\ntransport properties of electronic devices based on 2H tantalum disulfide\nflakes of different thicknesses are presented. We observe that\nsuperconductivity persists down to the thinnest layer investigated (3.5 nm),\nand interestingly, we find a pronounced enhancement in the critical temperature\nfrom 0.5 K to 2.2 K as the layers are thinned down. In addition, we propose a\ntight-binding model, which allows us to attribute this phenomenon to an\nenhancement of the effective electron-phonon coupling constant. This work\nprovides evidence that reducing dimensionality can strengthen superconductivity\nas opposed to the weakening effect that has been reported in other 2D materials\nso far.\n", "  We consider an $N$ by $N$ real symmetric random matrix $X=(x_{ij})$ where\n$\\mathbb{E}x_{ij}x_{kl}=\\xi_{ijkl}$. Under the assumption that $(\\xi_{ijkl})$\nis the discretization of a piecewise Lipschitz function and that the\ncorrelation is short-ranged we prove that the empirical spectral measure of $X$\nconverges to a probability measure. The Stieltjes transform of the limiting\nmeasure can be obtained by solving a functional equation. Under the slightly\nstronger assumption that $(x_{ij})$ has a strictly positive definite covariance\nmatrix, we prove a local law for the empirical measure down to the optimal\nscale $\\text{Im} z \\gtrsim N^{-1}$. The local law implies delocalization of\neigenvectors. As another consequence we prove that the eigenvalue statistics in\nthe bulk agrees with that of the GOE.\n", "  Extending Wigner's theorem we give a characterization of positive maps of\n$B(H)$ into itself which map the set of rank k projections onto itself.\n", "  Over the past decade, observations of giant exoplanets (Jupiter-size) have\nprovided key insights into their atmospheres, but the properties of lower-mass\nexoplanets (sub-Neptune) remain largely unconstrained because of the challenges\nof observing small planets. Numerous efforts to observe the spectra of\nsuper-Earths (exoplanets with masses of one to ten times that of Earth) have so\nfar revealed only featureless spectra. Here we report a longitudinal thermal\nbrightness map of the nearby transiting super-Earth 55 Cancri e revealing\nhighly asymmetric dayside thermal emission and a strong day-night temperature\ncontrast. Dedicated space-based monitoring of the planet in the infrared\nrevealed a modulation of the thermal flux as 55 Cancri e revolves around its\nstar in a tidally locked configuration. These observations reveal a hot spot\nthat is located 41 +- 12 degrees east of the substellar point (the point at\nwhich incident light from the star is perpendicular to the surface of the\nplanet). From the orbital phase curve, we also constrain the nightside\nbrightness temperature of the planet to 1380 +- 400 kelvin and the temperature\nof the warmest hemisphere (centred on the hot spot) to be about 1300 kelvin\nhotter (2700 +- 270 kelvin) at a wavelength of 4.5 microns, which indicates\ninefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. Our\nobservations are consistent with either an optically thick atmosphere with heat\nrecirculation confined to the planetary dayside, or a planet devoid of\natmosphere with low-viscosity magma flows at the surface.\n", "  Are the electromagnetic scalar and vector potentials dispensable? Lev Vaidman\nhas suggested that local interactions of gauge-invariant quantities, e.g.\nmagnetic torques, suffice for the description of all quantum electromagnetic\nphenomena. We analyze six thought experiments that challenge this suggestion.\nAll of them have explanations in terms of $local$ interactions of\ngauge-dependent quantities, in addition, some have explanations in terms of\nnonlocal interactions of gauge-invariant quantities. We claim, however, that\ntwo of our examples have no gauge-invariant formal description and that, in\ngeneral, no local description can dispense with electromagnetic potentials.\n", "  The integral measurement of the $^{12}$C(n,p)$^{12}$B reaction was performed\nat the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. The total number of\n$^{12}$B nuclei produced per neutron pulse of the n_TOF beam was determined\nusing the activation technique in combination with a time of flight technique.\nThe cross section is integrated over the n_TOF neutron energy spectrum from\nreaction threshold at 13.6 MeV to 10 GeV. Having been measured up to 1 GeV on\nbasis of the $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction, the neutron energy spectrum above 200 MeV\nhas been reevaluated due to the recent extension of the cross section reference\nfor this particular reaction, which is otherwise considered a standard up to\n200 MeV. The results from the dedicated GEANT4 simulations have been used to\nevaluate the neutron flux from 1 GeV up to 10 GeV. The experimental results\nrelated to the $^{12}$C(n,p)$^{12}$B reaction are compared with the evaluated\ncross sections from major libraries and with the predictions of different\nGEANT4 models, which mostly underestimate the $^{12}$B production. On the\ncontrary, a good reproduction of the integral cross section derived from\nmeasurements is obtained with TALYS-1.6 calculations, with optimized\nparameters.\n", "  A Sleeping Beauty in Science is a publication that goes unnoticed (sleeps)\nfor a long time and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention (is\nawakened by a prince). In our foregoing study we found that roughly half of the\nSleeping Beauties are application-oriented and thus are potential Sleeping\nInnovations. In this paper we investigate a new topic: Sleeping Beauties that\nare cited in patents. In this way we explore the existence of a dormitory of\ninventions. We find that patent citation may occur before or after the\nawakening and that the depth of the sleep, i.e., citation rate during the\nsleeping period, is no predictor for later scientific or technological impact\nof the Sleeping Beauty. Inventor-author self-citations occur only in a small\nminority of the Sleeping Beauties that are cited in patents, but other types of\ninventor-author links occur more frequently. We analyze whether they deal with\nnew topics by measuring the time-dependent evolution in the entire scientific\nliterature of the number of papers related to both the precisely defined topics\nas well as the broader research theme of the Sleeping Beauty during and after\nthe sleeping time. We focus on the awakening by analyzing the first group of\npapers that cites the Sleeping Beauty. Next, we create concept maps of the\ntopic-related and the citing papers for a time period immediately following the\nawakening and for the most recent period. Finally, we make an extensive\nassessment of the cited and citing relations of the Sleeping Beauty. We find\nthat tunable co-citation analysis is a powerful tool to discover the prince and\nother important application-oriented work directly related to the Sleeping\nBeauty, for instance papers written by authors who cite Sleeping Beauties in\nboth the patents of which they are the inventors, as well as in their\nscientific papers.\n", "  We generalize a recently proposed approach for the construction of\npseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra. Present technique is based on\na simple and straightforward similarity transformation of the coordinate and\nmomentum.\n", "  We explore the possibility of a beyond the standard model scalar ($\\phi$) as\na possible explanation of the diphoton resonance at 750~GeV invariant mass\nreported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the large hadron collider\n(LHC). We first present in a model-independent way the scalar-gluon-gluon and\nscalar-photon-photon effective couplings needed for obtaining the required\ndiphoton cross-section at the LHC for different total widths. We investigate\nhere two new-physics possibilities that can generate these effective couplings,\nnamely, (i) the 2-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) in the alignment limit, and (ii) a\nsinglet scalar, with vector-like fermions added and playing a crucial role in\ngenerating the effective couplings. We present the regions of model parameter\nspace which are allowed by direct LHC and perturbative unitarity constraints,\nand that give the required diphoton cross-section at the LHC for various total\nwidths. In the singlet case, we include the possibility that $\\phi$ decays into\na pair of neutral stable vector-like fermions that could be dark matter. We\nfind regions of parameter-space of the singlet model that gives the required\ndiphoton rate, have the correct dark matter relic-density, have dark matter\ndirect-detection rates compatible with current direct-detection experiments,\nand satisfy LHC bounds and perturbative unitarity constraints.\n", "  The last IceCube catalog of High Energy Starting Events (HESE) obtained with\na livetime of 1347 days comprises 54 neutrino events equally-distributed\nbetween the three families with energies between 25 TeV and few PeVs.\nConsidering the homogeneous flavors distribution (1:1:1) and the spectral\nfeatures of these neutrinos the IceCube collaboration claims the astrophysical\norigin of these events with more than $5\\sigma$. The spatial distribution of\ncited events does not show a clear correlation with known astrophysical\naccelerators leaving opened both the Galactic and the extra-Galactic origin\ninterpretations. Here, we compute the neutrino diffuse emission of our Galaxy\non the basis of a recently proposed phenomenological model characterized by\nradially-dependent cosmic-ray (CR) transport properties. We show that the\nastrophysical spectrum measured by IceCube experiment can be well explained\nadding to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux (obtained with this new model) a\nextra-Galactic component derived from the astrophysical muonic neutrinos\nreconstructed in the Northern hemisphere. A good agreement between the expected\nastrophysical neutrino flux and the IceCube data is found for the full sky as\nwell as for the Galactic plane region.\n", "  We study all-optical switches operating on a single four-level atom with the\n$N$-type transition configuration in a two-mode nanofiber cavity with a\nsignificant length (on the order of $20$ mm) and a moderate finesse (on the\norder of 300) under the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)\nconditions. In our model, the gate and probe fields are the quantum\nnanofiber-cavity fields excited by weak classical light pulses, and the\nparameters of the $D_2$ line of atomic cesium are used. We examine two\ndifferent switching schemes. The first scheme is based on the effect of the\npresence of a photon in the gate mode on the EIT of the probe mode. The second\nscheme is based on the use of EIT to store a photon of the gate mode in the\npopulation of an appropriate atomic level, which leads to the reduction of the\ntransmission of the field in the probe mode. We investigate the dependencies of\nthe switching contrast on various parameters, such as the cavity length, the\nmirror reflectivity, and the detunings and powers of the cavity driving field\npulses. For a nanofiber cavity with fiber radius of 250 nm, cavity length of 20\nmm, and cavity finesse of 313 and a cesium atom at a distance of 200 nm from\nthe fiber surface, we numerically obtain a switching contrast on the order of\nabout 67% for the first scheme and of about 95% for the second scheme. These\nswitching operations require small mean numbers of photons in the nanofiber\ncavity gate and probe modes.\n", "  We prove Landau damping for the collisionless Vlasov equation with a class of\n$L^1$ interaction potentials (including the physical case of screened Coulomb\ninteractions) on $\\mathbb R^3_x \\times \\mathbb R^3_v$ for localized\ndisturbances of an infinite, homogeneous background. Unlike the confined case\n$\\mathbb T^3_x \\times \\mathbb R_v^3$, results are obtained for initial data in\nSobolev spaces (as well as Gevrey and analytic classes). For spatial\nfrequencies bounded away from zero, the Landau damping of the density is\nsimilar to the confined case. The finite regularity is possible due to an\nadditional dispersive mechanism available on $\\mathbb R_x^3$ which reduces the\nstrength of the plasma echo resonance.\n", "  It has been recently suggested that large solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevents are often caused by twin CMEs. In the twin-CME scenario, the preceding\nCME is to provide both an enhanced turbulence level and enhanced seed\npopulation at the main CME-driven shock. In this work, we study the effect of\nthe preceding CMEs on the seed population. We examine event-integrated\nabundance of iron to oxygen ratio (Fe/O) at energies above 25 MeV/nuc for large\nSEP events in solar cycle 23. We find that the Fe/O ratio (normalized to the\nreference coronal value of $0.134$) $\\leq2.0$ for almost all single-CME events\nand these events tend to have smaller peak intensities. In comparison, the Fe/O\nratio of twin-CME events scatters in a larger range, reaching as high as $8$,\nsuggesting the presence of flare material from perhaps preceding flares. For\nextremely large SEP events with peak intensity above $1000$ pfu, the Fe/O drop\nbelow $2$, indicating that in these extreme events the seed particles are\ndominated by coronal material than flare material. The Fe/O ratios of Ground\nlevel enhancement (GLE) events, all being twin-CME events, scatter in a broad\nrange. For a given Fe/O ratio, GLE events tend to have larger peak intensities\nthan non-GLE events. Using velocity dispersion analysis (VDA), we find that GLE\nevents have lower solar particle release (SPR) heights than non-GLE events,\n\\red{agreeing with earlier results by Reames 2009b.\n", "  Rapid progress in passively mode-locked fiber lasers is currently driven by\nthe recent discovery of vector feature of mode-locking pulses, namely, the\ngroup velocity-locked vector solitons, the phase locked vector solitons, and\nthe high-order vector solitons. Those vector solitons are fundamentally\ndifferent from the previously known scalar solitons. Here, we report a fiber\nlaser where the mode-locked pulse evolves as a vector soliton in the strong\nbirefringent segment and is transformed into a regular scalar soliton after the\npolarizer within the laser cavity. The existence of solutions in a\npolarization-dependent cavity comprising a periodic combination of two distinct\nnonlinear waves is novel and likely to be applicable to various other nonlinear\nsystems. For very large local birefringence, our laser approaches the working\nregime of vector soliton lasers, while it approaches scalar soliton fiber\nlasers under the conditions of very small birefringence.\n", "  Recently it has been suggested that the \"twin-CME\" scenario Li.etal2012 may\nbe a very effective mechanism in causing extreme Solar Energetic Particle (SEP)\nevents and in particular Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events. Ding.etal2013\nperformed a statistical examination of the twin-CME scenario with a total of\n$126$ fast and wide western Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). They found that CMEs\nhaving a preceding CME with a speed $>$ 300 $km/s$ within $9$ hours from the\nsame active region have larger probability of leading to large SEP events than\nCMEs that do not have preceding CMEs. The choice of $9$ hours being the time\nlag $\\tau$ between the preceding CME and the main CME was based on some crude\nestimates of the decay time of the turbulence downstream of the shock driven by\nthe preceding CME. In this work, we examine this choice. For the $126$ fast\nwide CMEs examined in Ding.etal2013, we vary the time lag $\\tau$ from $1$ hour\nto $24$ hours with an increment of $1$ hour. By considering three quantities\nwhose values depend on the choice of this time lag $\\tau$, we show that the\nchoice of $13$ hours for $\\tau$ is more appropriate. Our study confirms our\nearlier result that twin CMEs are more likely to lead to large SEP events than\nsingle fast CMEs. The results shown here are of great relevance to space\nweather studies.\n", "  In model comparisons with observational data, not all data contain\ninformation that is useful for answering a specific science question. If\nnon-relevant or highly uncertain data are included in a comparison metric, they\ncan reduce the significance of other observations that matter for the\nscientific process of interest. Sources of noise and correlations among summed\nquantities within a comparison metric affect the significance of a signal that\nis useful for testing model skill. In the setting of the tropical Pacific, we\nintroduce an \"inquiry dependent\" (ID) metric of model-data comparison that\ndetermines the relative importance of the TOGA-TAO buoy observations of the\nocean temperature, salinity, and horizontal currents for influencing\nupper-ocean vertical turbulent mixing as represented by the K-Profile\nParameterization (KPP) embedded in the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm)\nfor the 2004-2007 time period. The ID metric addresses a challenge that the\nwind forcing is likely a more significant source of uncertainty for the ocean\nstate than the turbulence itself, and that the observations are correlated in\ntime, space, and across ocean state variables. In this approach the MITgcm is\nused to infer variability and relationships in and among the data, and to\ndetermine the response structures that are most relevant for constraining\nuncertain parameters. We demonstrate that the ID metric is able to distinguish\nthe effects due to parameter perturbations from those due to uncertain winds\nand that it is important to include multiple kinds of data in the comparison,\nsuggesting that the ID metric is appropriate for use in a calibration of the\nKPP model parameters using mooring observations of the ocean state.\n", "  Since the discovery of its photovoltaic properties organometallic salt\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ became the subject of vivid interest. The material exhibits\nhigh light conversion efficiency, it lases in red color, and it can serve as\nthe basis for light emitting diodes and photodetectors. Here we report another\nsurprising feature of this material family, the photo-tunability of the diode\nresponse of a heterojunction made of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ and its close\nrelative, CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$. In the dark state the device behaves as a diode,\nwith the Sn homologue acting as the \"p\" side. The junction is extremely\nsensitive to illumination. A complete reversal of the diode polarity, the first\nobservation of its kind, is seen when the junction is exposed to red laser\nlight of 25 mW/cm$^2$ or larger power density. This finding opens up the\npossibility for a novel class of opto-electronic devices.\n", "  The radical anion salt [Fe{HC(pz)3}2](TCNQ)3 demonstrating conductivity and\nspin-crossover transition (SCO) associated with Fe(II) complex cation subsystem\nhas been synthesized and structurally characterized. A pronounced change of the\ndc resistivity and a robust broadening of the EPR signal triggered by the SCO\ntransition are found. Enhanced EPR line broadening is interpreted in terms of\ncross relaxation between the TCNQ and Fe(II) spin subsystems\n", "  We prove that the corner angle distributions in the bound three-body system\nAAB, which consists of two particles of type A and one particle of type B,\napproach universal form if the pair AA has a virtual state at zero energy and\nthe binding energy of AAB goes to zero. We derive explicit expressions for the\nuniversal corner angle distributions in terms of elementary functions, which\ndepend solely on the mass ratio m(A)/m(B) and do not depend on pair\ninteractions. On the basis of experimental data and calculations we demonstrate\nthat such systems as the asymmetric Helium trimer $^3$He$^4$He$_2$ and the halo\nnucleus $^{22}$C exhibit universal features. Thus our result establishes an\ninteresting link between atomic and nuclear physics through the few-body\nuniversality.\n", "  We define the quaternionic quantum walk on a finite graph and investigate its\nproperties. This walk can be considered as a natural quaternionic extension of\nthe Grover walk on a graph. We explain the way to obtain all the right\neigenvalues of a quaternionic matrix and a notable property derived from the\nunitarity condition for the quaternionic quantum walk. Our main results\ndetermine all the right eigenvalues of the quaternionic quantum walk by using\ncomplex eigenvalues of the quaternionic weighted matrix which is easily\nderivable from the walk. Since our derivation is owing to a quaternionic\ngeneralization of the determinant expression of the second weighted zeta\nfunction, we explain the second weighted zeta function and the relationship\nbetween the walk and the second weighted zeta function.\n", "  While a fully relativistic collisionless plasma is modeled by the\nVlasov-Maxwell system a good approximation in the non-relativistic limit is\ngiven by the Vlasov-Poisson system. We modify the Vlasov-Poisson system so that\ndamping due to the relativistic effect of radiation reaction is included. We\nprove the existence and uniqueness as well as the higher regularity of local\nclassical solutions. These theorems also include the higher regularity of\nclassical solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system depending on the regularity of\nthe initial datum.\n", "  Resonant vibrational-excitation cross sections and rate constants for\nelectron scattering by molecular oxygen are presented. Transitions between all\n42 vibrational levels of O$_2(\\textrm{X}\\ ^3\\Sigma_g^- $) are considered.\nMolecular rotations are parameterized by the rotational quantum number $J$\nwhich is considered in the range 1 to 151. The lowest four resonant states of\nO$_2^-$, $^2\\Pi_g$, $^2\\Pi_u$, $^4\\Sigma_u^-$ and $^2\\Sigma_u^-$, are taken\ninto account. The calculations are performed using the fixed-nuclei R-matrix\napproach to determine the resonance positions and widths, and the boomerang\nmodel to characterize the nuclei motion. Two energy regions below and above\n4~eV are investigated: the first one is characterized by sharp structures in\nthe cross section, and the second by a broad resonance peaked at 10~eV. The\ncomputed cross sections are compared with theoretical and experimental results\navailable in literature for both the energy regions, and are made available for\nuse by modelers. The effect of including rotational motion is found to be\nnon-negligible.\n", "  The omega-square hypothesis assumes that the ground displacement u(t) in the\nfar-field zone decays as the inverse square of frequency in the range ~1-30 Hz.\nThis empirical fact remains theoretically unjustified. Our analysis of the\nproblem is based on an integral representation of u(t) in terms of the source\ntime function f and on the spectrum analysis of local features in f. The goal\nis to select the local features that will enable one to generate the\nomega-square behavior of u(t) on a large set of receivers. We found two\nappropriate fragments of f : first , f exhibits a local inverse-square-root\nbehavior near the rupture front where the frontal surface is piecewise smooth\n(but not smooth and not rough ); and second, f is bounded near the rupture\nfront where the frontal surface has a slight roughness (the Hurst parameter\nnear 1). These facts can be useful for understanding the omega-square spectral\nbehavior of the kinematic source models.\n", "  The ranking problem of earthquake forecasts is considered. We formulate\nsimple statistical requirements to forecasting quality measure R and analyze\nsome R-ranking methods on this basis, in particular, the pari-mutuel gambling\nmethod by Zechar&Zhuang (2014).\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of a recent $500$ ks net exposure\n\\textit{Suzaku} observation, carried out in 2013, of the nearby ($z=0.184$)\nluminous (L$_{\\rm bol}\\sim10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) quasar PDS 456 in which the\nX-ray flux was unusually low. The short term X-ray spectral variability has\nbeen interpreted in terms of variable absorption and/or intrinsic continuum\nchanges. In the former scenario, the spectral variability is due to variable\ncovering factors of two regions of partially covering absorbers. We find that\nthese absorbers are characterised by an outflow velocity comparable to that of\nthe highly ionised wind, i.e. $\\sim0.25$ c, at the $99.9\\%$ $(3.26\\sigma)$\nconfidence level. This suggests that the partially absorbing clouds may be the\ndenser clumpy part of the inhomogeneous wind. Following an obscuration event we\nobtained a direct estimate of the size of the X-ray emitting region, to be not\nlarger than $20~R_{\\rm g}$ in PDS 456.\n", "  Starting with the bag model a method for the study of the magnetic properties\n(magnetic moments, magnetic dipole transition widths) of ground-state mesons is\ndeveloped. We calculate the M1 transition moments and use them subsequently to\nestimate the corresponding decay widths. These are compared with experimental\ndata, where available, and with the results obtained in other approaches.\nFinally, we give the predictions for the static magnetic moments of all\nground-state vector mesons including those containing heavy quarks. We have a\ngood agreement with experimental data for the M1 decay rates of light as well\nas heavy mesons. Therefore, we expect our predictions for the static magnetic\nproperties (usual magnetic moments) to be of sufficiently high quality, too.\n", "  Lorentz and CPT invariance are among the symmetries that can be investigated\nwith ultrahigh precision in subatomic physics. Being spacetime symmetries,\nLorentz and CPT invariance can be violated by minuscule amounts in many\ntheoretical approaches to underlying physics that involve novel spacetime\nconcepts, such as quantized versions of gravity. Regardless of the underlying\nmechanism, the low-energy effects of such violations are expected to be\ngoverned by effective field theory. This talk provides a survey of this idea\nand includes an overview of experimental efforts in the field.\n", "  We realize a pair of simultaneous ten-step one-dimensional quantum walks with\ntwo walkers sharing coins, which we prove is analogous to the ten-step\ntwo-dimensional quantum walk with a single walker holding a four-dimensional\ncoin. Our experiment demonstrates a ten-step quantum walk over an 11x11\ntwo-dimensional lattice with a line defect, thereby realizing a localized\nwalker state.\n", "  The line edge roughness (LER) becomes a issue of e-beam lithography when\nfeature size is reduced into nanometers. Therefore, minimizing the LER is a\nimportant method to increase the density of circuit patterns. One of the\npossible ways is through simulation. The stochastic exposure distributions in\nthe resist is generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. In addition a resist\ndevelopment simulation needs to be carried out. Although there are several ways\nto simulate or estimate LER but none of them can reveal as much the inner\nrelationship between LER and different parameters as theocratical analysing\nmethods can do. In this paper, a new approach to analytically derive the LER\nbased on the statistical exposure, is described. Our approach is based on\nanalytic model of stochastic exposure distribution, deriving standard deviation\nof exposure and analyzing the variance of edge location after development. Even\nthough it may not be a complete modeling of LER, it can still show some strong\nrelationship between LER and some inner parameters.\n", "  We present a selection of stack designs for MOVPE grown InxGa1-xAs\nmetamorphic buffer layers following various convex-down compositional\ncontinuous gradients of the In content, showing that defect generation and\nstrain can be managed in a variety of ways, some rather unexpected (and\nunreported). Indeed, we observe that it is possible to grow surprisingly thick\ntensile strained layers on metamorphic substrates, without significant\nrelaxation and defect generation. We believe our findings give significant\ninsights to the investigation of strain, relaxation and defect distribution in\nmetamorphic buffer design, so to obtain properly engineered/tailored structures\n(the most successful ones already finding applications in device growth).\n", "  We present a reasoning that the string coupling constant should be 1 from the\nassumption that the area spectrum derived from loop quantum gravity must be\nequal to the area spectrum calculated from \"stringy differential geometry.\" To\nthis end, we will use the loop quantum gravity area spectrum constructions\nproposed by Brian Kong and us, and stringy differential geometry based on\ndouble field theory recently proposed by Imtak Jeon, Kanghoon Lee and\nJeong-Hyuck Park.\n", "  Uniform, mostly single-layer graphene with enhanced stability is demonstrated\nover Co film. The polycrystalline Co film deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate\ngives a continuous graphene layer that is easily transferred without the aid of\nany polymeric support, but preserving the material quality, as evidenced by\nRaman analysis. Great stability to the damaging action of the laser beam, as\ncompared to the Cu-grown material is also observed. The better structural and\nelectrical properties of the material are interpreted in terms of\nthermodynamics of the cooling-down process. It is suggested that the reduction\nin entropy, due annihilation of vacancies caused by C atoms precipitating\nduring cooling, directly depends on the activation energy of C solubility into\nCo, which is considerably high, due to Co magnetic ordering at the process\ntemperature. Our work expands the possibility of synthesizing single-layer\ngraphene keeping into account the thermodynamics of various C-metal systems.\n", "  We consider the problem when there are two kinds of Bosons with an attraction\nbetween them. We find the system to consist of two Bose condensates with an\nadditional pairing order between the Bosons. The properties of this state are\ndiscussed.\n", "  An ultrafast all-optical shutter is presented, based on a simple two-color\ntwo-photon absorption technique. For time-resolved luminescence measurements\nthis shutter is an interesting alternative to the optical Kerr gate. The\nrejection efficiency is 99%, the switching-off and switching-on speeds are\nlimited by the pulse length only, the rejection time is determined by the\ncrystal slab thickness, and the bandwidth spans the entire visible spectrum. We\nshow that our shutter can also be used for accurate measurement of group\nvelocity inside a transparent material.\n", "  An accretion flow around a black hole has a saddle type sonic point just\noutside the event horizon to guarantee that the flow enters the black hole\nsupersonically. This feature exclusively present in strong gravity limit makes\nits marks in every observation of black hole candidates. Another physical sonic\npoint is present (as in a Bondi flow) even in weak gravity. Every aspect of\nspectral or temporal properties of every black hole can be understood using\nthis transonic or advective flow having more than one saddle type points. This\nmost well known and generalized solution with viscosity and radiative transfer\nhas been verified by numerical simulations also. Spectra, computed for various\ncombinations of the standard Keplerian, and advective sub-Keplerian components\nmatch accurately with those from satellite observations. Standing, oscillating\nand propagatory oscillating shocks are produced due to centrifugal barrier of\nthe advective component. The post-shock region acts as the Compton cloud\nproducing the power-law spectra. Jets and outflows are also produced from this\npost-shock region, commonly known as the CENtrifugal barrier supported BOundary\nLayer or CENBOL. In soft states, the CENBOL is cooled down by soft photons from\nthe Keplerian disk, and thus the outflow is absent. Type-C and Type-B QPOs are\ngenerated respectively due to strong and weak resonance oscillations of the\nCENBOL. Away from resonance, oscillation may be triggered when Rankine-Hugoniot\nconditions are not satisfied and Type-A QPOs could be seen.\n", "  The idea of meaning as use in language is explored in a mathematical and\nphysical context. Two possible scenarios of further analysis are presented:\nOrdinal arithmetic and String theory.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the orientation of the Egyptian pyramids at Giza\nwith respect to sunrises and sunsets, using SunCalc.net software. We can see\nthat Khufu and Khafre pyramids had been positioned in a manner that, from each\npyramid, it was always possible to observe the points of the horizon where the\nsun was rising and setting on each day of the year. A discussion for the\nMenkaure pyramid is also proposed.\n", "  What is called \"orthodox\" quantum mechanics, as presented in standard\nfoundational discussions, relies on two substantive assumptions --- the\nprojection postulate and the eigenvalue-eigenvector link --- that do not in\nfact play any part in practical applications of quantum mechanics. I argue for\nthis conclusion on a number of grounds, but primarily on the grounds that the\nprojection postulate fails correctly to account for repeated, continuous and\nunsharp measurements (all of which are standard in contemporary physics) and\nthat the eigenvalue-eigenvector link implies that virtually all interesting\nproperties are maximally indefinite pretty much always. I present an\nalternative way of conceptualising quantum mechanics that does a better job of\nrepresenting quantum mechanics as it is actually used, and in particular that\neliminates use of either the projection postulate or the eigenvalue-eigenvector\nlink, and I reformulate the measurement problem within this new presentation of\northodoxy.\n", "  The stability of liquid films coating the walls of a parallel-plate channel\nand sheared by a pressure-driven gas flow along the channel centre is studied.\nThe films are susceptible to a long-wavelength instability, whose dynamic\nbehaviour is found - for sufficiently low Reynolds numbers and thick gas layers\n- to be described by two coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To\nthe best of our knowledge, such coupled fully non-linear equations for the film\nthicknesses have not been derived previously. A linear stability analysis\nconducted under the condition that the material properties and the initial\nundisturbed liquid film thicknesses are equal can be utilized to determine\nwhether the interfaces are predominantly destabilized by the variations of the\nshear stress or by the pressure gradient acting upon them. The analysis of the\nweakly non-linear equations performed for this case shows that instabilities\ncorresponding to a vanishing Reynolds number are absent from the system.\nMoreover, for this configuration, the patterns emerging along the two\ninterfaces are found to be identical in the long-time limit, implying that the\nfilms are fully synchronized. A different setup, where the liquid films have\nidentical material properties but their undisturbed thicknesses differ, is\nstudied numerically. The results show that even for this configuration the\ninterfacial waves remain phase-synchronized and closely correlated for a broad\nrange of parameters. These findings are particularly relevant for multiphase\nflow in narrow ducts, for example in the respiratory system or in microfluidic\nchannels.\n", "  We show that the Dirac equation for real spinors can be naturally decomposed\ninto a system of two first-order relativistic wave equations. The decomposition\nseparates in a transparent way the real and imaginary parts of the Dirac\nequation by means of two algebraic differential operators, allowing to describe\nreal spinors in any representation of the Dirac matrices maintaining the\nreality condition $\\tilde{\\Psi}=\\tilde{\\Psi}^{*}$ unaltered. In addition, it is\nshown that the Majorana wave equation is a particular case of the relativistic\nsystem of equations deduced in this paper. We also briefly discuss how the\nformalism can be extended to deal with complex (charged) spinors.\n", "  In this paper, we propose that both the quasi-transverse-magnetic (TM) and\nquasi-transverseelectric (TE) Airy plasmons can be supported in graphene-based\nwaveguides. The solution of Airy plasmons is calculated analytically and the\nexistence of Airy plasmons is studied under the paraxial approximation. Due to\nthe tunability of the chemical potential of graphene, the self-accelerating\nbehavior of quasi-TM Airy plasmons can be steered effectively, especially in\nmultilayer graphene based waveguides. Besides the metals, graphene provides an\nadditional platform to investigate the propagation of Airy plasmons and to\ndesign various plasmonic devices.\n", "  A SPAMM tagged MRI methodology is presented allowing continuous (3.3-3.6 Hz)\nsampling of 3D dynamic soft tissue deformation using non-segmented 3D\nacquisitions. The 3D deformation is reconstructed by the combination of 3\nmutually orthogonal tagging directions, thus requiring only 3 repeated motion\ncycles. In addition a fully automatic post-processing framework is presented\nemploying Gabor scale-space and filter-bank analysis for tag extrema\nsegmentation and triangulated surface fitting aided by Gabor filter bank\nderived surface normals. Deformation is derived following tracking of tag\nsurface triplet triangle intersections. The dynamic deformation measurements\nwere validated using indentation tests (~20 mm deep at 12 mm/s) on a silicone\ngel soft tissue phantom containing contrasting markers which provide a\nreference measure of deformation. In addition, the techniques were evaluated\nin-vivo for dynamic skeletal muscle tissue deformation measurement during\nindentation of the biceps region of the upper arm in a volunteer.\n", "  Based on some results on reparmetrisation of time in Hamiltonian path\nintegral formalism, a pseudo time formulation of operator formalism of quantum\nmechanics is presented. Relation of reparametrisation of time in quantum with\nsuper symmetric quantum mechanics is established. We show how some important\nconcepts such as shape invariance and tools like isospectral deformation appear\nin pseudo time quantum mechanics.\n", "  The general idea to modify Einstein's field equations by promoting Newton's\nconstant $G$ to a covariant differential operator $G_\\Lambda(\\Box_g)$ was\napparently outlined for the first time in [12-15]. The modification itself\noriginates from the quest of finding a mechanism which is able to degravitate\nthe vacuum energy on cosmological scales. We present in this article a precise\ncovariant coupling model which acts like a high-pass filter with a macroscopic\ndistance filter scale $\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$. In the context of this particular\ntheory of gravity we work out the effective relaxed Einstein equations as well\nas the effective 1.5 post-Newtonian total near-zone mass of a many body system.\nWe observe that at any step of computation we recover in the limit of vanishing\nmodification parameters the corresponding general relativistic result.\n", "  Using density functional theory calculations, the ground state structure of\nBaFeO$_3$ (BFO) is investigated with local spin density approximation (LSDA).\nCubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral types BFO are considered to\ncalculate the formation enthalpy. The formation enthalpies reveal that cubic is\nthe most stable structure of BFO. Small energy difference between the cubic and\ntetragonal suggests a possible tetragonal BFO. Ferromagnetic(FM) and\nanitiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the Fe atoms show that all the\nstriochmetric BFO are FM. The energy difference between FM and AFM shows room\ntemperature ferromagnetism in cubic BFO in agreement with the experimental\nwork. The LSDA calculated electronic structures are metallic in all studied\ncrystallographic phases of BFO. Calculations including the Hubbard potential\n$U,i.e.$ LSDA+$U$, show that all phases of BFO are half-metallic consistent\nwith the integer magnetic moments. The presence of half-metallicity is\ndiscussed in terms of electronic band structures of BFO.\n", "  Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite architecture could serve as a robust\nplatform for materials design to realize functionalities beyond photovoltaic\napplications. We explore caloric effects in organometal halide perovskites,\ntaking methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) as an example, using all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations with a first-principles based interatomic\npotential. The adiabatic thermal change is estimated directly by introducing\ndifferent driving fields in the simulations. We find that MAPbI$_3$ exhibits\nboth electrocaloric and mechanocaloric effects at room temperature. Local\nstructural analysis reveals that the rearrangement of molecular cations in\nresponse to electric and stress fields is responsible for the caloric effects.\nThe enhancement of caloric response could be realized through strain\nengineering and chemical doping.\n", "  We derive direct single-stage numerical evaluation of the electronic overlap\nintegral between arbitrary atomic orbitals (including STOs). Integration is\nover cartesian co-ordinates, and replaces previous sums over 'special'\nfunctions. The results, in Mathematica 10 and Maple 18, agree with the\nliterature to 8 digits. We briefly discuss possible use in quantum chemistry,\nincluding accuracy, algorithmic suitability and operating-system\nmachine-implementation as an intrinsic function.\n", "  The Casimir free energy and pressure of thin metal films deposited on\nmetallic plates are considered using the Lifshitz theory and the Drude and\nplasma model approaches to the role of conduction electrons. The bound\nelectrons are taken into account by using the complete optical data of film and\nplate metals. It is shown that for films of several tens of nanometers\nthickness the Casimir free energy and pressure calculated using these\napproaches differ by hundreds and thousands percent and can be easily\ndiscriminated experimentally. According to our results, the free energy of a\nmetal film does not vanish in the limiting case of ideal metal if the Drude\nmodel approach is used in contradiction with the fact that the fluctuating\nfield cannot penetrate in its interior. Numerical computations of the Casimir\nfree energy and pressure of Ag and Au films deposited on Cu and Al plates have\nbeen performed using both theoretical approaches. It is shown that the free\nenergy of a film can be both negative and positive depending on the metals\nused. For a Au film on a Ag plate and vice versa the Casimir energy of a film\nchanges its sign with increasing film thickness. Applications of the obtained\nresults for resolving the Casimir puzzle and the problem of stability of thin\nfilms are discussed.\n", "  We report discovery of KFe$_{1.05}$Ag$_{0.88}$Te$_{2}$ single crystals with\nsemiconducting spin glass ground state. Composition and structure analysis\nsuggest nearly stoichiometric I4/mmm space group but allow for the existence of\nvacancies, absent in long range semiconducting antiferromagnet\nKFe$_{0.85}$Ag$_{1.15}$Te$_{2}$. The subtle change in stoichometry in Fe/Ag\nsublattice changes magnetic ground state but not conductivity, giving further\ninsight into the semiconducting gap mechanism.\n", "  We approximate the two-body spinless Salpeter equation with the one which is\nvalid in heavy quarks limit. We consider the resulting semi-relativistic\nequation in a time-dependent formulation. We use the Lewis- Riesenfeld\ndynamical invariant method and series solution to obtain the solutions of the\ndifferential equation. We have also done some calculations in order to derive\nthe time evolution operator for the considered problem.\n", "  We present the stellar mass ($M_{*}$), and K-corrected $K$-band absolute\nmagnitude ($M_{K}$) Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) for sub-samples of the 584\ngalaxies spatially resolved in H$\\alpha$ emission by the KMOS Redshift One\nSpectroscopic Survey (KROSS). We model the velocity field of each of the KROSS\ngalaxies and extract a rotation velocity, $V_{80}$ at a radius equal to the\nmajor axis of an ellipse containing 80% of the total integrated H$\\alpha$ flux.\nThe large sample size of KROSS allowed us to select 210 galaxies with well\nmeasured rotation speeds. We extract from this sample a further 56 galaxies\nthat are rotationally supported, using the stringent criterion $V_{80}/\\sigma >\n3$, where $\\sigma$ is the flux weighted average velocity dispersion. We find\nthe $M_{K}$ and $M_{*}$ TFRs for this sub-sample to be $M_{K} / \\rm{mag}= (-7.3\n\\pm 0.9) \\times [(\\log(V_{80}/\\rm{km\\ s^{-1}})-2.25]- 23.4 \\pm 0.2$ , and\n$\\log(M_{*} / M_{\\odot})= (4.7 \\pm 0.4) \\times [(\\log(V_{80}/\\rm{km\\ s^{-1}}) -\n2.25] + 10.0 \\pm 0.3$, respectively. We find an evolution of the $M_{*}$ TFR\nzero-point of $-0.41 \\pm 0.08$ dex over the last $\\sim $8 billion years.\nHowever, we measure no evolution in the $M_{K}$ TFR zero-point over the same\nperiod. We conclude that rotationally supported galaxies of a given dynamical\nmass had less stellar mass at $z \\sim 1$ than the present day, yet emitted the\nsame amounts of $K$-band light. The ability of KROSS to differentiate, using\nintegral field spectroscopy with KMOS, between those galaxies that are\nrotationally supported and those that are not explains why our findings are at\nodds with previous studies without the same capabilities.\n", "  We present an X-band waveguide (WR90) and UHF waveguide (WR1500) measurement\nmethod that permits the extraction of the complex permittivity for low\ndielectric loss tangent material specimen. The extraction method relies on\ncomputational electromagnetic (CEM) simulations; coupled with a genetic\nalgorithm; to fit the experimental measurement and the simulated transmitted\nscattering parameter (S21) of the TE10 mode through the waveguide with the\nmaterial specimen partially filling the cross-section. This technique provides\nthe material measurement community with the ability to accurately extract\nmaterial properties of low-loss material specimen.\n", "  Massive early-type stars vary; low-mass late-type brown dwarfs vary, too. I\nwill make a short, but illustrative, summary of my previous studies on stellar\nand sub-stellar photometric variability (including the discovery of the most\nvariable brown dwarf in the whole sky), and explain how amateurs can help\nprofessional astronomers with our investigations.\n", "  It is shown that the consideration of the density of states variation in\nnanoscale electrochemical systems yields modulations in the rate constant and\nconcomitant electrical currents. The proposed models extend the utility of\nMarcus-Hush-Chidsey (MHC) kinetics to a larger class of materials and could be\nused as a test of dimensional character. The implications of the study are of\nmuch significance to an understanding and modulation of charge transfer\nnanostructured electrodes.\n", "  Rates for productions of neutral and doubly charged partners of\nD_{s0}^+(2317) in B meson decays are studied by using a hard D meson\napproximation in the infinite momentum frame, and the results are of the same\norder of magnitude as that of D_{s0}^+(2317). Because the bottom-strange\nX^{+-}(5568) which can be interpreted as iso-triplet bottom partners of\nD_{s0}^+(2317) have recently been discovered, observations of neutral and\ndoubly charged partners of D_{s0}^+(2317) are strongly desired.\n", "  The dynamics of dissipative solitons (DSs) are explored in a high repetition\nrate normal-dispersion erbium-doped fiber laser for the first time. Despite of\nthe high fundamental repetition rate of 129 MHz and thus the low pulse energy,\na DS train with a dechirped pulse width of 418 fs, period-doubling of single\nand dual DSs, as well as 258 MHz 2nd-order harmonic mode-locking of DSs can be\nobserved in the fiber laser with increasing pump power and appropriate\nsettings. A transmitted semiconductor saturable absorber and a wavelength\ndivision multiplexer/isolator/tap hybrid module are employed to simplify the\nlaser configuration, thus not only increasing the repetition rate, but also\nenhancing the stability and robustness of the fiber laser due to the commercial\navailability of all the components.\n", "  Polymer glasses have numerous advantageous mechanical properties in\ncomparison to other materials. One of the most useful is the high degree of\ntoughness that can be achieved due to significant yield occurring in the\nmaterial. Remarkably, the onset of plasticity in polymeric materials is very\npoorly quantified, despite its importance as the ultimate limit of purely\nelastic behavior. Here we report the results of a novel experiment which is\nextremely sensitive to the onset of yield and discuss its impact on measurement\nand elastic theory. In particular, we use an elastic instability to locally\nbend and impart a \\textit{local} tensile stress in a thin, glassy polystyrene\nfilm, and directly measure the resulting residual stress caused by the bending.\nWe show that plastic failure is initiated at extremely low strains, of order\n$10^{-3}$ for polystyrene. Not only is this critical strain found to be small\nin comparison to bulk measurement, we show that it is influenced by thin film\nconfinement - leading to an increase in the critical strain for plastic failure\nas film thickness approaches zero.\n", "  We investigate thermodynamics and Phase transition of the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using\nthermodynamical laws of black holes, we derive the expressions of some\nthermodynamics quantities for the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole surrounded by\nquintessence. The variations of the temperature and heat capacity with the\nentropy were plotted for different values of the state parameter related to the\nquintessence, $\\omega_{q}$, and the normalization constant related to the\ndensity of quintessence $c$. We show that when varying the entropy of the black\nhole a phase transition is observed in the black hole. Moreover, when\nincreasing the density of quintessence, the transition point is shifted to\nlower entropy and the temperature of the black hole decreases.\n", "  A relationship between the Coulomb inclusive break-up probability and the\nradiative capture reaction rate for weakly-bound three-body systems is\nestablished. This direct link provides a robust procedure to estimate the\nreaction rate for nuclei of astrophysical interest by measuring inclusive\nbreak-up processes at different energies and angles. This might be an\nadvantageous alternative to the determination of reaction rates from the\nmeasurement of $B(E1)$ distributions through exclusive Coulomb break-up\nexperiments. In addition, it provides a reference to assess the validity of\ndifferent theoretical approaches that have been used to calculate reaction\nrates. The procedure is applied to $^{11}$Li ($^{9}$Li+n+n) and $^6$He\n($^{4}$He+n+n) three-body systems for which some data exist.\n", "  Understanding how galaxies evolved from the early Universe through cosmic\ntime is a fundamental part of modern astrophysics. In order to study this\nevolution it is important to sample the galaxies at various times in a\nconsistent way through time. In regular luminosity selected samples, our\nanalyses are biased towards the brightest galaxies at all times (as these are\neasier to observe and identify). A complementary method relies on the\nabsorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to\nunderstand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected\ngalaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift\nz~2.\n  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is\npresented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller\nthan local galaxies of similar masses. A new spectroscopically selected sample\nis presented and the increased precision of the redshifts allows a more\ndetailed measurement of the scatter in the mass-size relation. The size\nevolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is modelled by a `dilution' scenario,\nin which progressively larger galaxies at later times are added to the\npopulation of denser galaxies, causing an increase of the mean size of the\npopulation. This model describes the evolution of both sizes and number\ndensities very well, however, the scatter in the model increases with time,\ncontrary to the data. It is thus concluded that a combination of `dilution' and\nindividual growth, e.g., through mergers, is needed.\n  For brevity, the individual chapters based on published peer-reviewed\narticles are omitted and a link to the given article is given instead.\n  Principal supervisor: Johan P. U. Fynbo\n", "  Propagation of radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere is reviewed. The\neffects of polarization transfer, induced scattering and reprocessing to high\nenergies are analysed with an especial emphasis on the implications for the\ngamma-ray pulsars. The possibilities of the pulsar plasma diagnostics based on\nthe observed radio pulse characteristics are outlined as well. As an example,\nthe plasma number density profiles obtained from the polarization data for the\nVela and the gamma-ray millisecond pulsars J1446-4701, J1939+2134 and\nJ1744-1134 are presented. The number densities derived tend to be the\nhighest/lowest when the radio pulse leads/lags the gamma-ray peak. In the PSR\nJ1939+2134, the plasma density profiles for the main pulse and interpulse\nappear to fit exactly the same curve, testifying to the origin of both radio\ncomponents above the same magnetic pole and their propagation through the same\nplasma flow in opposite directions. The millisecond radio pulse components\nexhibiting flat position angle curves are suggested to result from the induced\nscattering of the main pulse by the same particles that generate gamma-rays.\nThis is believed to underlie the wide-sense radio/gamma-ray correlation in the\nmillisecond pulsars. The radio quietness of young gamma-ray pulsars is\nattributed to resonant absorption, whereas the radio loudness to the radio beam\nescape through the periphery of the open field line tube.\n", "  We consider here kinematical quantization: a first and often overlooked step\nin quantization procedures. $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{R}_+$ and the interval are\nconsidered, as well as direct (Cartesian) products thereof. Some simple\nminisuperspace models, and mode by mode consideration of slightly inhomogeneous\ncosmology, have indefinite signature versions of such kinematical\nquantizations. The examples in the current paper build in particular toward the\ncase of vacuum $\\mathbb{S}^3$ slightly inhomogeneous cosmology's mode\nconfiguration space, which is mathematically a finite time interval slab of\nMinkowski spacetime.\n", "  The traditional standard theory of quantum mechanics is unable to solve the\nspin-statistics problem, i.e. to justify the utterly important \\qo{Pauli\nExclusion Principle} but by the adoption of the complex standard relativistic\nquantum field theory. In a recent paper (Ref. [1]) we presented a proof of the\nspin-statistics problem in the nonrelativistic approximation on the basis of\nthe \\qo{Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics}. In the present paper, by the same\ntheory the proof of the Spin-Statistics Theorem is extended to the relativistic\ndomain in the general scenario of curved spacetime. The relativistic approach\nallows to formulate a manifestly step-by-step Weyl gauge invariant theory and\nto emphasize some fundamental aspects of group theory in the demonstration. No\nrelativistic quantum field operators are used and the particle exchange\nproperties are drawn from the conservation of the intrinsic helicity of\nelementary particles. It is therefore this property, not considered in the\nStandard Quantum Mechanics, which determines the correct spin-statistics\nconnection observed in Nature [1]. The present proof of the Spin-Statistics\nTheorem is simpler than the one presented in Ref. [1], because it is based on\nsymmetry group considerations only, without having recourse to frames attached\nto the particles.\n", "  An infinite class of nonuniform antiplane shear fields is considered for a\nlinear elastic isotropic space and (non-intersecting) isotoxal star-shaped\npolygonal voids and rigid inclusions perturbing these fields are solved.\nThrough the use of the complex potential technique together with the\ngeneralized binomial and the multinomial theorems, full-field closed-form\nsolutions are obtained in the conformal plane. The particular (and important)\ncases of star-shaped cracks and rigid-line inclusions (stiffeners) are also\nderived. Except for special cases (addressed in Part II), the obtained\nsolutions show singularities at the inclusion corners and at the crack and\nstiffener ends, where the stress blows-up to infinity, and is therefore\ndetrimental to strength. It is for this reason that the closed-form\ndetermination of the stress field near a sharp inclusion or void is crucial for\nthe design of ultra-resistant composites.\n", "  We investigate quantum state tomography (QST) for pure states and quantum\nprocess tomography (QPT) for unitary channels via $adaptive$ measurements. For\na quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, we first propose an\nadaptive protocol where only $2d-1$ measurement outcomes are used to accomplish\nthe QST for $all$ pure states. This idea is then extended to study QPT for\nunitary channels, where an adaptive unitary process tomography (AUPT) protocol\nof $d^2+d-1$ measurement outcomes is constructed for any unitary channel. We\nexperimentally implement the AUPT protocol in a 2-qubit nuclear magnetic\nresonance system. We examine the performance of the AUPT protocol when applied\nto Hadamard gate, $T$ gate ($\\pi/8$ phase gate), and controlled-NOT gate,\nrespectively, as these gates form the universal gate set for quantum\ninformation processing purpose. As a comparison, standard QPT is also\nimplemented for each gate. Our experimental results show that the AUPT protocol\nthat reconstructing unitary channels via adaptive measurements significantly\nreduce the number of experiments required by standard QPT without considerable\nloss of fidelity.\n", "  Based on Newtonian dynamics, observations show that the luminous masses of\nastrophysical objects that are the size of a galaxy or larger are not enough to\ngenerate the measured motions which they supposedly determine. This is\ntypically attributed to the existence of dark matter, which possesses mass but\ndoes not radiate (or absorb radiation). Alternatively, the mismatch can be\nexplained if the underlying dynamics is not Newtonian. Within this conceptual\nscheme, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a successful theoretical\nparadigm. MOND is usually expressed in terms of a nonlinear Poisson equation,\nwhich is difficult to analyse for arbitrary matter distributions. We study the\nMONDian gravitational field generated by slightly non-spherically symmetric\nmass distributions based on the fact that both Newtonian and MONDian fields are\nconservative (which we refer to as the compatibility condition). As the\nnon-relativistic version of MOND has two different formulations (AQUAL and\nQuMOND) and the compatibility condition can be expressed in two ways, there are\nfour approaches to the problem in total. The method involves solving a suitably\ndefined linear deformation potential, which generally depends on the choice of\nMOND interpolation function. However, for some specific form of the deformation\npotential, the solution is independent of the interpolation function.\n", "  A system of equations consisting of an infinite string coupled to a nonlinear\noscillator is considered. The Cauchy problem for the system with the periodic\ninitial data is studied. The main goal is to prove the convergence of the\nsolutions as $t\\to\\infty$ to a time periodic solution.\n", "  Recent IRIS observations have revealed a prevalence of intermittent\nsmall-scale jets with apparent speeds of 80 - 250 km s$^{-1}$, emanating from\nsmall-scale bright regions inside network boundaries of coronal holes. We find\nthat these network jets appear not only in coronal holes but also in quiet-sun\nregions. Using IRIS 1330A (C II) slit-jaw images, we extract several parameters\nof these network jets, e.g. apparent speed, length, lifetime and increase in\nfoot-point brightness. Using several observations, we find that some properties\nof the jets are very similar but others are obviously different between the\nquiet sun and coronal holes. For example, our study shows that the coronal-hole\njets appear to be faster and longer than those in the quiet sun. This can be\ndirectly attributed to a difference in the magnetic configuration of the two\nregions with open magnetic field lines rooted in coronal holes and magnetic\nloops often present in quiet sun. We have also detected compact bright loops,\nlikely transition region loops, mostly in quiet sun. These small loop-like\nregions are generally devoid of network jets. In spite of different magnetic\nstructures in the coronal hole and quiet sun in the transition region, there\nappears to be no substantial difference for the increase in foot-point\nbrightness of the jets, which suggests that the generation mechanism of these\nnetwork jets is likely the same in both regions.\n", "  The non-relativistic versions of the generalized Poincar\\'{e} algebras and\ngeneralized $AdS$-Lorentz algebras are obtained. This non-relativistic algebras\nare called, generalized Galilean algebras type I and type II and denoted by\n$\\mathcal{G}\\mathfrak{B}_{n}$ and $\\mathcal{G}\\mathfrak{L}_{_{n}}$\nrespectively. Using a generalized In\\\"{o}n\\\"{u}--Wigner contraction procedure\nwe find that the generalized Galilean algebras type I can be obtained from the\ngeneralized Galilean algebras type II. The $S$-expansion procedure allows us to\nfind the $\\mathcal{G}\\mathfrak{B}_{_{5}}$ algebra from the Newton--Hooke\nalgebra with central extension. The procedure developed in Ref. \\cite{newton}\nallow us to show that the non-relativistic limit of the five dimensional\nEinstein--Chern--Simons gravity is given by a modified version of the Poisson\nequation. The modification could be compatible with the effects of Dark Matter,\nwhich leads us to think that Dark Matter can be interpreted as a\nnon-relativistic limit of Dark Energy.\n", "  Strong ferromagnetic interlayer exchange couplings $J$ in perpendicularly\nmagnetized systems are becoming increasingly desirable for applications. We\nstudy whether ferromagnetic interlayer exchange couplings can be measured by a\ncombination of broadband ferromagnetic resonance methods and magnetometry\nhysteresis loops. For this we model the switching and the eigenexcitations in\nbilayer systems comprising a soft layer coupled to a thicker harder layer that\npossesses higher perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. For large $J >0$ the\nswitching fields are essentially independent of $J$ but the frequency of the\noptical eigenmode of the bilayer and the linewidth of the acoustical and\noptical eigenmode are directly sensitive to the coupling. We derive a corpus of\ncompact analytical expressions to analyze these frequencies, their linewidth\nand discuss the meaning thereof. We illustrate this corpus on a system\nmimicking the fixed layers of a magnetic tunnel junction meant for spin torque\napplications.\n", "  We present a tetrad-based method for solving the Einstein field equations for\nspherically-symmetric systems and compare it with the widely-used\nLema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model. In particular, we focus on the issues of\ngauge ambiguity and the use of comoving versus 'physical' coordinate systems.\nWe also clarify the correspondences between the two approaches, and illustrate\ntheir differences by applying them to the classic examples of the Schwarzschild\nand Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. We demonstrate that the tetrad-based\nmethod does not suffer from the gauge freedoms inherent to the LTB model,\nnaturally accommodates non-zero pressure and has a more transparent physical\ninterpretation. We further apply our tetrad-based method to a generalised form\nof 'Swiss cheese' model, which consists of an interior spherical region\nsurrounded by a spherical shell of vacuum that is embedded in an exterior\nbackground universe. In general, we allow the fluid in the interior and\nexterior regions to support pressure, and do not demand that the interior\nregion be compensated. We pay particular attention to the form of the solution\nin the intervening vacuum region and verify the validity of Birkhoff's theorem\nat both the metric and tetrad level. We then reconsider critically the original\ntheoretical arguments underlying the so-called $R_h = ct$ cosmological model,\nwhich has recently received considerable attention. These considerations in\nturn illustrate the interesting behaviour of a number of 'horizons' in general\ncosmological models.\n", "  Within the Unified ternary fission model (UTFM), the alpha accompanied\nternary fission of even-even $^{244-260}$Cf isotopes has been studied by taking\nthe interacting barrier as the sum of Coulomb and proximity potential. For the\nalpha accompanied ternary fission of 244^Cf isotope, the highest yield is\nobtained for the fragment combination 108^Ru+4^He+132^Te, which contain near\ndoubly magic nuclei 132^Te (N=80, Z=52). In the case of 246^Cf and 248^Cf\nisotopes, the highest yield is obtained for the fragment combinations with near\ndoubly magic nuclei 134^Te (N=82, Z=52) as the heavier fragment. The highest\nyield obtained for 250^Cf, 252^Cf, 254^Cf, 256^Cf, 258^Cf and 260^Cf isotopes\nis for the fragment combination with doubly magic nuclei 132^Sn (N=82, Z=50) as\nthe heavier fragment. We have included the effect of deformation and\norientation of fragments and this has revealed that in addition to closed shell\neffect, ground state deformation also plays an important role in the\ncalculation of relative yield of favorable fragment combinations. The computed\nisotopic yields for alpha accompanied ternary fission of 252^Cf isotope are\nfound to be in agreement with the experimental data. The emission probability\nand kinetic energy of long range alpha particle is calculated for the various\nisotopes of Cf and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental\ndata.\n", "  For Riemannian submanifolds of a semi-Riemannian manifold, we introduce the\nconcepts of \\emph{total shear tensor} and \\emph{shear operators} as the\ntrace-free part of the corresponding second fundamental form and shape\noperators. The relationship between these quantities and the umbilical\nproperties of the submanifold is shown. Several novel notions of umbilical\nsubmanifolds are then considered along with the classical concepts of totally\numbilical and pseudo-umbilical submanifolds.\n  Then we focus on the case of co-dimension $2$, and we present necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the submanifold to be umbilical with respect to a\nnormal direction. Moreover, we prove that the umbilical direction, if it\nexists, is unique ---unless the submanifold is totally umbilical--- and we give\na formula to compute it explicitly. When the ambient manifold is Lorentzian we\nalso provide a way of determining its causal character. We end the paper by\nillustrating our results on the Lorentzian geometry of the Kerr black hole.\n", "  We analyse the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking in complex quantum\nsystems by investigating the long-standing conjecture that the maximally\nsymmetry-breaking quantum ground states are the most classical ones\ncorresponding to a globally ordered phase. We make this argument quantitatively\nprecise by comparing different local and global indicators of classicality and\nquantumness, respectively in symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving quantum\nground states. We first discuss how naively comparing local, pairwise\nentanglement and discord apparently leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed,\nwe show that in symmetry-preserving ground states the two-body entanglement\ncaptures only a modest portion of the total two-body quantum correlations,\nwhile, on the contrary, in maximally symmetry-breaking ground states it\ncontributes the largest amount to the total two-body quantum correlations. We\nthen put to test the conjecture by looking at the global, macroscopic\ncorrelation properties of quantum ground states. We prove that the ground\nstates which realize the maximum breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetries,\nassociated to a globally ordered phase, are the only ones that: I) are always\nlocally convertible, i.e. can be obtained from all other ground states by only\napplying LOCC transformations (local operations and classical communication),\nwhile the reverse is never possible; II) minimize the monogamy inequality on\nthe globally shared, macroscopic bipartite entanglement.\n", "  Detection of hydroacoustic transmissions is a key enabling technology in\napplications such as depth measurements, detection of objects, and undersea\nmapping. To cope with the long channel delay spread and the low signal-to-noise\nratio, hydroacoustic signals are constructed with a large time-bandwidth\nproduct, $N$. A promising detector for hydroacoustic signals is the normalized\nmatched filter (NMF). For the NMF, the detection threshold depends only on $N$,\nthereby obviating the need to estimate the characteristics of the sea ambient\nnoise which are time-varying and hard to estimate. While previous works\nanalyzed the characteristics of the normalized matched filter (NMF), for\nhydroacoustic signals with large $N$ values the expressions available are\ncomputationally complicated to evaluate. Specifically for hydroacoustic signals\nof large $N$ values, this paper presents approximations for the probability\ndistribution of the NMF. These approximations are found extremely accurate in\nnumerical simulations. We also outline a computationally efficient method to\ncalculate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) which is required to\ndetermine the detection threshold. Results from an experiment conducted in the\nMediterranean sea at depth of 900~m agree with the analysis.\n", "  Characterizing many-body systems through the quantum correlations between\ntheir constituent particles is a major goal of quantum physics. Although\nentanglement is routinely observed in many systems, we report here the\ndetection of stronger correlations - Bell correlations - between the spins of\nabout 480 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive a Bell correlation\nwitness from a many-particle Bell inequality involving only one- and two-body\ncorrelation functions. Our measurement on a spin-squeezed state exceeds the\nthreshold for Bell correlations by 3.8 standard deviations. Our work shows that\nthe strongest possible non-classical correlations are experimentally accessible\nin many-body systems, and that they can be revealed by collective measurements.\n", "  The saturation mechanism for the fastest-growing instability of massive\nscalar field in Kerr metric is identified, assuming saturation by cubic or\nquartic nonlinearities of the field potential. The resulting spindown rate of\nthe black hole is calculated. The (rather involved) saturation scenario is\nconfirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  Single mode lasing is experimentally demonstrated in a transversely\nmulti-moded InP-based semiconductor microring arrangement. In this system, mode\ndiscrimination is attained by judiciously utilizing the exceptional points in a\nparity-time (PT) symmetric double microring configuration. The proposed scheme\nis versatile, robust to small fabrication errors, and enables the device to\noperate in a stable manner considerably above threshold while maintaining\nspatial and spectral purity. The results presented here pave the way towards a\nnew class of chip-scale semiconductor lasers that utilize gain/loss contrast as\na primary mechanism for mode selection.\n", "  Graphene is no longer alone; a family of atomically thin 2D semiconductors\nhas emerged. Optoelectronics and photonics applications are in their\nexperimental infancy but the future holds much promise.\n", "  We demonstrate the first low-noise mid-IR frequency comb source using a\nsilicon microresonator. Our observation of strong Raman scattering lines in the\ngenerated comb suggests that Raman and four-wave mixing interactions play a\nrole in assisting the transition to the low-noise state. In addition, we\ncharacterize, the intracavity comb generation dynamics using an integrated PIN\ndiode, which takes advantage of the inherent three-photon absorption process in\nsilicon.\n", "  We have studied the temperature dependence of the upper critical fields,\n$\\mu_{0}H_{c2}$, of K$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_{z}$ single crystals up to 60\nT. The $\\mu _{0}H_{c2}$ for $H\\parallel ab$ and $H\\parallel c$ decrease with\nincreasing sulfur content. The detailed analysis using\nWerthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory including the Pauli spin-paramagnetic\neffect shows that $\\mu _{0}H_{c2}$ for $H\\parallel ab$ is dominated by the\nspin-paramagnetic effect, which diminishes with higher S content, whereas $\\mu\n_{0}H_{c2}$ for $H\\parallel c$ shows a linear temperature dependence with an\nupturn at high fields. The latter observation can be ascribed to multiband\neffects that become weaker for higher S content. This results in an enhanced\nanisotropy of $\\mu _{0}H_{c2}$ for high S content due to the different trends\nof the spin-paramagnetic and multiband effect for $H\\parallel ab$ and\n$H\\parallel c$, respectively.\n", "  Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are arguably the most natural DM\ncandidates from a particle physics point of view. After their number density\nhas frozen out in the early universe, determining their relic density today,\nWIMPs are still kept very close to thermal equilibrium by scattering events\nwith standard model particles. The complete decoupling from the thermal bath\nhappens as late as around 1-10 MeV, thereby setting an important cosmological\nscale that can directly be translated into a small-scale cutoff of the spectrum\nof matter density fluctuations. We present here a full analytic treatment of\nthe kinetic decoupling process from first principles. This allows an exact\ndetermination of the decoupling scale, for an arbitrary WIMP candidate and any\nscattering amplitude. As an application, we consider the situation of the\nlightest supersymmetric particle as well as the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle\nthat arises in theories with universal extra dimensions; furthermore, we show\nthat our formalism can also easily be applied to, e.g., the evolution of the\nnon-relativistic electrons into the recombination regime. Finally, we comment\non the impacts for the smallest gravitationally bound structures and the\nprospects for the indirect detection of dark matter.\n"]}
