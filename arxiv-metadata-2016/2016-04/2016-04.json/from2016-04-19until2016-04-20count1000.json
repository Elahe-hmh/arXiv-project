dissipative thermal cycle models based on\nFinite-Time Thermodynamics exhibit loop-shaped curves of power output versus\nefficiency, such as it occurs with actual dissipative thermal engines. Within\nthe context of First-Order Irreversible Thermodynamics (FOIT), in this work we\nshow that for an energy converter consisting of two coupled fluxes it is also\npossible to find loop-shaped curves of both power output and the so-called\necological function against efficiency. In a previous work Stucki [J.W. Stucki,\nEur. J. Biochem. vol. 109, 269 (1980)] used a FOIT-approach to describe the\nmodes of thermodynamic performance of oxidative phosphorylation involved in\nATP-synthesis within mithochondrias. In that work the author did not use the\nmentioned loop-shaped curves and he proposed that oxidative phosphorylation\noperates in a steady state simultaneously at minimum entropy production and\nmaximum efficiency, by means of a conductance matching condition between\nextreme states of zero and infinite conductances respectively. In the present\nwork we show that all Stucki's results about the oxidative phosphorylation\nenergetics can be obtained without the so-called conductance matching\ncondition. On the other hand, we also show that the minimum entropy production\nstate implies both null power output and efficiency and therefore this state is\nnot fulfilled by the oxidative phosphorylation performance. Our results suggest\nthat actual efficiency values of oxidative phosphorylation performance are\nbetter described by a mode of operation consisting in the simultaneous\nmaximization of the so-called ecological function and the efficiency.\n", "  Compact categories have lately seen renewed interest via applications to\nquantum physics. Being essentially finite-dimensional, they cannot accomodate\n(co)limit-based constructions. For example, they cannot capture protocols such\nas quantum key distribution, that rely on the law of large numbers. To overcome\nthis limitation, we introduce the notion of a compactly accessible category,\nrelying on the extra structure of a factorisation system. This notion allows\nfor infinite dimension while retaining key properties of compact categories:\nthe main technical result is that the choice-of-duals functor on the compact\npart extends canonically to the whole compactly accessible category. As an\nexample, we model a quantum key distribution protocol and prove its correctness\ncategorically.\n", "  A crucial issue in star formation is to understand the physical mechanism by\nwhich mass is accreted onto and ejected by a young star. The visible\nspectrometer VEGA on the CHARA array can be an efficient means of probing the\nstructure and the kinematics of the hot circumstellar gas at sub-AU. For the\nfirst time, we observed the Herbig Ae star AB Aur in the H$\\alpha$ emission\nline, using the VEGA low spectral resolution on two baselines of the array. We\ncomputed and calibrated the spectral visibilities between 610 nm and 700 nm. To\nsimultaneously reproduce the line profile and the visibility, we used a 1-D\nradiative transfer code that calculates level populations for hydrogen atoms in\na spherical geometry and synthetic spectro-interferometric observables. We\nclearly resolved AB Aur in the H$\\alpha$ line and in a part of the continuum,\neven at the smallest baseline of 34 m. The small P-Cygni absorption feature is\nindicative of an outflow but could not be explained by a spherical stellar wind\nmodel. Instead, it favors a magneto-centrifugal X-disk or disk-wind geometry.\nThe fit of the spectral visibilities could not be accounted for by a wind\nalone, so we considered a brightness asymmetry possibly caused by large-scale\nnebulosity or by the known spiral structures, inducing a visibility modulation\naround H$\\alpha$. Thanks to the unique capabilities of VEGA, we managed to\nsimultaneously record for the first time a spectrum at a resolution of 1700 and\nspectral visibilities in the visible range on a target as faint as $m_{V}$ =\n7.1. It was possible to rule out a spherical geometry for the wind of AB Aur\nand provide realistic solutions to account for the H$\\alpha$ emission\ncompatible with magneto-centrifugal acceleration. The study illustrates the\nadvantages of optical interferometry and motivates observations of other bright\nyoung stars to shed light on the accretion/ejection processes.\n", "  Does star formation proceed in the same way in large spirals such as the\nMilky Way and in smaller chemically younger galaxies? Earlier work suggests a\nmore rapid transformation of H$_2$ into stars in these objects but (1) a doubt\nremains about the validity of the H$_2$ mass estimates and (2) there is\ncurrently no explanation for why star formation should be more efficient. M~33,\na local group spiral with a mass $\\sim 10$\\% and a metallicity half that of the\nGalaxy, represents a first step towards the metal poor Dwarf Galaxies. We have\nsearched for molecular clouds in the outer disk of M~33 and present here a set\nof detections of both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, including the only detections\n(for both lines) beyond the R$_{25}$ radius in a subsolar metallicity galaxy.\nThe spatial resolution enables mass estimates for the clouds and thus a measure\nof the $N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO}$ ratio, which in turn enables a more reliable\ncalculation of the H$_2$ mass. Our estimate for the outer disk of M~33 is\n$N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO(1-0)} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{20} \\,{\\rm cm^{-2}/(K{\\rm \\\nkm \\ s^{-1}})}$ with an estimated uncertainty of a factor $\\le 2$. While the\n$^{12/13}$CO line ratios do not provide a reliable measure of $N({\\rm H}_2) /\nI_{\\rm CO}$, the values we find are slightly greater than Galactic and\ncorroborate a somewhat higher $N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO}$ value. Comparing the\nCO observations with other tracers of the interstellar medium, no reliable\nmeans of predicting where CO would be detected was identified. In particular,\nCO detections were often not directly on local HI or FIR or H$\\alpha$ peaks,\nalthough generally in regions with FIR emission and high HI column density. The\nresults presented here provide support for the quicker transformation of H$_2$\ninto stars in M~33 than in large local universe spirals.\n", "  In this paper we use the \\textit{concurrence vector}, as a measure of\nentanglement, and investigate lower and upper bounds on the concurrence of a\nsuperposition of bipartite states as a function of the concurrence of the\nsuperposed states. We show that the amount of entanglement quantified by the\nconcurrence vector is exactly the same as that quantified by\n\\textit{I-concurrence}, so that our results can be compared to those given in\n[Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 76}, 042328 (2007)]. We obtain a tighter lower bound in the\ncase that two superposed states are orthogonal. We also show that when the two\nsuperposed states are not necessarily orthogonal, both lower and bounds are, in\ngeneral, tighter than the bounds given in terms of the I-concurrence. An\nextension of the results to the case with more than two states in the\nsuperpositions is also given.\n", "  The ratio between the couplings of a relaxational process to compression and\nshear, respectively, is calculated in the Eshelby picture of structural\nrearrangements within a surrounding elastic matrix, assuming a constant density\nof stable structures in distortion space. The result is compared to\nexperimental data for the low-temperature tunneling states in glasses and to\nPrigogine-Defay data at the glass transition from the literature.\n", "  In undercooled liquids, the anharmonicity of the interatomic potentials\ncauses a volume increase of the inherent structures with increasing energy\ncontent. In most glass formers, this increase is stronger than the vibrational\nGr\\\"uneisen volume expansion and dominates the thermal expansion of the liquid\nphase. For a gaussian distribution of inherent states in energy, the generic\ncase, this implies a 1/T-squared temperature dependence of the additional\nthermal expansion and the additional heat capacity at zero pressure. The\ncorresponding compressibility contribution has the Prigogine-Defay ratio one.\nIn experiment, one finds a higher Prigogine-Defay ratio, explainable in terms\nof structural volume changes without any energy change. These should always\nexist, though their influence becomes weak in close-packing systems, at the\ncrossover to soft matter.\n", "  With Hg atoms confined in an optical lattice trap in the Lamb-Dicke regime,\nwe obtain a spectral line at 265.6 nm in which the full-width at half-maximum\nis <15Hz. Here we lock an ultrastable laser to this ultranarrow clock\ntransition and achieve a fractional frequency stability of\n5.4x10^(-15)/sqrt(tau) for tau<=400s. The highly stable laser light used for\nthe atom probing is derived from a 1062.6 nm fiber laser locked to an\nultrastable optical cavity that exhibits a mean drift rate of -6.0x10^(-17)\ns^(-1) (or -16.9 mHz.s^(-1) at 282 THz) over a five month period. A comparison\nbetween two such lasers locked to independent optical cavities shows a flicker\nnoise limited fractional frequency instability of 4x10^(-16) per cavity.\n", "  The amount of H$_2$ present in spiral galaxies remains uncertain,\nparticularly in the dim outer regions and in low-metallicity environments. We\npresent high-resolution CO(1--0) observations with the Plateau de Bure\ninterferometer of the most distant molecular cloud in the local group galaxy M\n33. The cloud is a single entity rather than a set of smaller clouds within the\nbroad beam of the original single-dish observations. The interferometer and\nsingle-dish fluxes are very similar and the line widths are indistinguishable,\ndespite the difference in beamsize. At a spatial resolution of 10 pc, beyond\nthe optical radius of the M 33, the CO brightness temperature reaches 2.4\nKelvins. A virial mass estimate for the cloud yields a mass of $4.3 \\times\n10^4$ \\msun and a ratio $\\ratio \\simeq 3.5 \\times 10^{20} \\Xunit$. While no\nvelocity gradient is seen where the emission is strong, the velocity is\nredshifted to the extreme SW and blue-shifted to the far NE. If the orientation\nof the cloud is along the plane of the disk (i.e. not perpendicular), then\nthese velocities correspond to slow infall or accretion. The rather modest\ninfall rate would be about $2 \\times 10^{-4}$\\moyr.\n", "  A general state of an $m\\otimes n$ system is a classical-quantum state if and\nonly if its associated $A$-correlation matrix (a matrix constructed from the\ncoherence vector of the party $A$, the correlation matrix of the state, and a\nfunction of the local coherence vector of the subsystem $B$), has rank no\nlarger than $m-1$. Using the general Schatten $p$-norms, we quantify quantum\ncorrelation by measuring any violation of this condition. The required\nminimization can be carried out for the general $p$-norms and any function of\nthe local coherence vector of the unmeasured subsystem, leading to a class of\ncomputable quantities which can be used to capture the quantumness of\ncorrelations due to the subsystem $A$. We introduce two special members of\nthese quantifiers; The first one coincides with the tight lower bound on the\ngeometric measure of discord, so that such lower bound fully captures the\nquantum correlation of a bipartite system. Accordingly, a vanishing tight lower\nbound on the geometric discord is a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nstate to be zero-discord. The second quantifier has the property that it is\ninvariant under a local and reversible operation performed on the unmeasured\nsubsystem, so that it can be regarded as a computable well-defined measure of\nthe quantum correlations. The approach presented in this paper provides a way\nto circumvent the problem with the geometric discord. We provide some examples\nto exemplify this measure.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of an individual case of gravitational lensing\nof a $z\\sim8$ Lyman-Break galaxy (LBG) in a blank field, identified in Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging obtained as part of the Brightest of Reionizing\nGalaxies survey. To investigate the close proximity of the bright\n($m_{AB}=25.8$) $Y_{098}$-dropout to a small group of foreground galaxies, we\nobtained deep spectroscopy of the dropout and two foreground galaxies using\nVLT/X-Shooter. We detect H-$\\alpha$, H-$\\beta$, [OIII] and [OII] emission in\nthe brightest two foreground galaxies (unresolved at the natural seeing of\n$0.8$ arcsec), placing the pair at $z=1.327$. We can rule out emission lines\ncontributing all of the observed broadband flux in $H_{160}$ band at\n$70\\sigma$, allowing us to exclude the $z\\sim8$ candidate as a low redshift\ninterloper with broadband photometry dominated by strong emission lines. The\nforeground galaxy pair lies at the peak of the luminosity, redshift and\nseparation distributions for deflectors of strongly lensed $z\\sim8$ objects,\nand we make a marginal detection of a demagnified secondary image in the\ndeepest ($J_{125}$) filter. We show that the configuration can be accurately\nmodelled by a singular isothermal ellipsoidal deflector and a S\\'{e}rsic source\nmagnified by a factor of $\\mu=4.3\\pm0.2$. The reconstructed source in the\nbest-fitting model is consistent with luminosities and morphologies of $z\\sim8$\nLBGs in the literature. The lens model yields a group mass of\n$9.62\\pm0.31\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ and a stellar mass-to-light ratio for the\nbrightest deflector galaxy of $M_{\\star}/L_{B}=2.3^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\nM_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$ within its effective radius. The foreground galaxies'\nredshifts would make this one of the few strong lensing deflectors discovered\nat $z>1$.\n", "  Calculation of the quantum discord requires to find the minimum of the\nquantum conditional entropy $S(\\rho^{AB}|\\{\\Pi^B_{k}\\})$ over all measurements\non the subsystem $B$. In this paper, we provide a simple relation for the\nconditional entropy as the difference of two Shannon entropies. The relation is\nsuitable for calculation of the quantum discord in the sense that it can by\nused to obtain the quantum discord for some classes of two-qubit states,\nwithout the need for minimization. We also present an analytical procedure of\noptimization and obtain conditions under which the quantum conditional entropy\nof a general two-qubit state is stationary. The presented relation is also used\nto find a tight upper bound on the quantum discord.\n", "  Using \\emph{ab initio} alloy theory formulated within the exact muffin-tin\norbitals theory in combination with the coherent potential approximation, we\ninvestigate the ideal tensile strength (ITS) in the $[001]$ direction of bcc\nferro-/ferrimagnetic (FFM) and paramagnetic (PM) Fe$_{1-x}M_{x}$ ($M=$ Al, V,\nCr, Mn, Co, or Ni) random alloys. The ITS of ferromagnetic (FM) Fe is\ncalculated to be $12.6$\\,GPa, in agreement with available data, while the PM\nphase turns out to posses a significantly lower value of $0.7\\,$GPa. Alloyed to\nthe FM matrix, we predict that V, Cr, and Co increase the ITS of Fe, while Al\nand Ni decrease it. Manganese yields a weak non-monotonic alloying behavior. In\ncomparison to FM Fe, the alloying effect of Al and Co to PM Fe is reversed and\nthe relative magnitude of the ITS can be altered more strongly for any of the\nsolutes. All considered binaries are intrinsically brittle and fail by cleavage\nof the $(001)$ planes under uniaxial tensile loading in both magnetic phases.\nWe show that the previously established ITS model based on structural energy\ndifferences proves successful in the PM Fe-alloys but is of limited use in the\ncase of the FFM Fe-based alloys. The different performance is attributed to the\nspecific interplay between magnetism and volume change in response to uniaxial\ntension. We establish a strong correlation between the compositional effect on\nthe ITS and the one on the shear elastic constant $C'$ for the PM alloys and\nbriefly discuss the relation between hardenability and the ITS.\n", "  We reinterpret special relativity, or more precisely its de Sitter\ndeformation, in terms of 3d conformal geometry, as opposed to (3+1)d spacetime\ngeometry. An inertial observer, usually described by a geodesic in spacetime,\nbecomes instead a choice of ways to reverse the conformal compactification of a\nEuclidean vector space up to scale. The observer's \"current time,\" usually\ngiven by a point along the geodesic, corresponds to the choice of scale in the\ndecompactification. We also show how arbitrary conformal 3-geometries give rise\nto \"observer space geometries,\" as defined in recent work, from which spacetime\ncan be reconstructed under certain integrability conditions. We conjecture a\nrelationship between this kind of \"holographic relativity\" and the \"shape\ndynamics\" proposal of Barbour and collaborators, in which conformal space takes\nthe place of spacetime in general relativity. We also briefly survey related\npictures of observer space, including the AdS analog and a representation\nrelated to twistor theory.\n", "  We present measurements of the stress response of packings formed from a wide\nrange of particle shapes. Besides spheres these include convex shapes such as\nthe Platonic solids, truncated tetrahedra, and triangular bipyramids, as well\nas more complex, non-convex geometries such as hexapods with various arm\nlengths, dolos, and tetrahedral frames. All particles were 3D-printed in hard\nresin. Well-defined initial packing states were established through\npreconditioning by cyclic loading under given confinement pressure. Starting\nfrom such initial states, stress-strain relationships for axial compression\nwere obtained at four different confining pressures for each particle type.\nWhile confining pressure has the largest overall effect on the mechanical\nresponse, we find that particle shape controls the details of the stress-strain\ncurves and can be used to tune packing stiffness and yielding. By correlating\nthe experimentally measured values for the effective Young's modulus under\ncompression, yield stress and energy loss during cyclic loading, we identify\ntrends among the various shapes that allow for designing a packing's aggregate\nbehavior.\n", "  Accurate characterization of stellar populations is of prime importance to\ncorrectly understand the formation and evolution process of our Galaxy. The\nfield of asteroseismology has been particularly successful in such an endeavor\nproviding fundamental parameters for large samples of stars in different\nevolutionary phases. We present our results on determinations of masses, radii,\nand distances of stars in the CoRoT and Kepler fields, showing that we can map\nand date different regions of the galactic disk and distinguish gradients in\nthe distribution of stellar properties at different heights. We further review\nhow asteroseismic determinations can produce a unique set of constraints,\nincluding ages, outside the solar neighborhood for galactic chemical evolution\nmodels.\n", "  A sensitive technique for the readout of the state of a qubit is based on the\nmeasurement of the conductance through a proximal sensor quantum dot (SQD).\nHere, we theoretically study the coherent backaction of such a measurement on a\ncoupled SQD-charge-qubit system. We derive Markovian kinetic equations for the\nensemble-averaged state of the SQD-qubit system, expressed in the coupled\ndynamics of two charge-state occupations of the SQD and two qubit isospin\nvectors, one for each SQD charge state. We find that aside from introducing\ndissipation, the detection also renormalizes the coherent evolution of the\nSQD-qubit system. Basically, if the electron on the detector has time to probe\nthe qubit, then it also has time to fluctuate and thereby renormalize the\nsystem parameters. In particular, this induces torques on the qubit isospins,\nsimilar to the spin torque generated by the spintronic exchange field in\nnoncollinear spin-valve structures. Secondly, we show that for a consistent\ndescription of the detection, one must also include the renormalization effects\nin the next-to-leading order in the electron tunneling rates, especially at the\npoint of maximal sensitivity of the detector. Although we focus on a\ncharge-qubit model, our findings are generic for qubit readout schemes that are\nbased on spin-to-charge conversion using a quantum-dot detector. Furthermore,\nour study of the stationary current through the SQD, a test measurement\nverifying that the qubit couples to the detector current, already reveals\nvarious significant effects of the isospin torques on the qubit. Our kinetic\nequations provide a starting point for further studies of the time evolution in\ncharge-based qubit readout. Finally, we provide a rigorous sum rule that\nconstrains such approximate descriptions of the qubit isospin dynamics and show\nthat it is obeyed by our kinetic equations.\n", "  Continuing the project described by Kato et al. (2009a, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for SU UMa-type dwarf novae mainly observed\nduring the 2012-2013 season. We found three objects (V444 Peg, CSS J203937 and\nMASTER J212624) having strongly positive period derivatives despite the long\norbital period (Porb). By using the period of growing stage (stage A)\nsuperhumps, we obtained mass ratios for six objects. We characterized nine new\nWZ Sge-type dwarf novae. We made a pilot survey of the decline rate of slowly\nfading part of SU UMa-type and WZ Sge-type outbursts. The decline time scale\nwas found to generally follow the expected Porb^(1/4) dependence and WZ\nSge-type outbursts also generally follow this trend. There are some objects\nwhich show slower decline rates, and we consider these objects good candidates\nfor period bouncers. We also studied unusual behavior in some objects,\nincluding BK Lyn which made a transition from an ER UMa-type state to the\nnovalike (standstill) state in 2013 and unusually frequent occurrence of\nsuperoutbursts in NY Ser and CR Boo. We applied least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (Lasso) power spectral analysis, which has been proven to be\nvery effective in analyzing the Kepler data, to ground-based photometry of BK\nLyn and detected the dramatic disappearance of the signal of negative\nsuperhumps in 2013. We suggested that the mass-transfer rates did not vary\nstrongly between the ER UMa-type state and novalike state in BK Lyn, and this\ntransition was less likely caused by a systematic variation of the\nmass-transfer rate.\n", "  The benefits of entanglement can outlast entanglement itself. In quantum\nillumination, entanglement is employed to better detect reflecting objects in\nenvironments so noisy that all entanglement is destroyed. Here, we show that\nquantum discord - a more resilient form of quantum correlations - explains the\nresilience of quantum illumination. We introduce a quantitative relation\nbetween the performance gain in quantum illumination and the amount of discord\nused to encode information about the presence or absence of a reflecting\nobject. This highlights discord's role preserving the benefits of entanglement\nin entanglement breaking noise.\n", "  We show the existence of isoperimetric regions of sufficiently large volumes\nin general asymptotically hyperbolic three manifolds. Furthermore, we show that\nlarge coordinate spheres in compact perturbations of\nSchwarzschild-anti-deSitter are uniquely isoperimetric. This is relevant in the\ncontext of the asymptotically hyperbolic Penrose inequality.\n  Our results require that the scalar curvature of the metric satisfies\n$R_{g}\\geq -6$, and we construct an example of a compact perturbation of\nSchwarzschild-anti-deSitter without $R_{g}\\geq -6$ so that large centered\ncoordinate spheres are not isoperimetric. The necessity of scalar curvature\nbounds is in contrast with the analogous uniqueness result proven by Bray for\ncompact perturbations of Schwarzschild, where no such scalar curvature\nassumption is required.\n  This demonstrates that from the point of view of the isoperimetric problem,\nmass behaves quite differently in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting\ncompared to the asymptotically flat setting. In particular, in the\nasymptotically hyperbolic setting, there is an additional quantity, the\n\"renormalized volume,\" which has a strong effect on the large-scale geometry of\nvolume.\n", "  We highlight the progress, current status, and open challenges of QCD-driven\nphysics, in theory and in experiment. We discuss how the strong interaction is\nintimately connected to a broad sweep of physical problems, in settings ranging\nfrom astrophysics and cosmology to strongly-coupled, complex systems in\nparticle and condensed-matter physics, as well as to searches for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. We also discuss how success in describing the strong\ninteraction impacts other fields, and, in turn, how such subjects can impact\nstudies of the strong interaction. In the course of the work we offer a\nperspective on the many research streams which flow into and out of QCD, as\nwell as a vision for future developments.\n", "  We report on the sub-Doppler laser cooling of neutral $^{171}$Yb and\n$^{173}$Yb in a magneto-optical trap using the $^{1}S_{0}$-$^{1}P_{1}$\ntransition at 398.9nm. We use two independent means to estimate the temperature\nof the atomic cloud for several of the Yb isotopes. The two methods of\nMOT-cloud-imaging and release-and-recapture show consistency with one another.\nTemperatures below 400$\\mu$K and 200$\\mu$K are recorded for $^{171}$Yb and\n$^{173}$Yb, respectively, while ~1mK is measured for both $^{172}$Yb and\n$^{174}$Yb. By comparison, the associated 1D Doppler cooling temperature limit\nis 694$\\mu$K. The sub-Doppler cooling of the I=1/2 $^{171}$Yb isotope in a\n$\\sigma^{+}-\\sigma^{-}$ light-field trap adds further evidence that the\nSisyphus cooling mechanism is occurring in such 3D magneto-optical traps.\n", "  In Paris, we are using an atom interferometer to precisely measure the recoil\nvelocity of an atom that absorbs a photon. In order to reach a high\nsensitivity, many recoils are transferred to atoms using the Bloch oscillations\ntechnique. In this lecture, I will present in details this technique and its\napplication to high precision measurement. I will especially describe in\ndetails how this method allows us to perform an atom recoil measurement at the\nlevel of $1.3 \\times 10^{-9}$. This measurement is used in the most precise\ndetermination of the fine structure constant that is independent of quantum\nelectrodynamics.\n", "  Supercapacitor electrodes fabricated from a nanocomposite consisting of\nmultiwall carbon nanotubes and titanium oxide nanoparticles were characterized\nelectrochemically. Conventional electrochemical characterizations cyclic\nvoltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in a lithium-based electrolyte\ngave a specific capacitance of 345 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. New\nelectrochemical characterization techniques that allow one to obtain the peak\ncapacitance associated with intercalation and to distinguish between\nelectrostatic and faradaic charge storage are described and applied to the\nelectrode measurements. Finally, the maximum energy density obtained was 31\nWh/kg.\n", "  Winner selection by majority, in an election between two candidates, is the\nonly rule compatible with democratic principles. Instead, when the candidates\nare three or more and the voters rank candidates in order of preference, there\nare no univocal criteria for the selection of the winning (consensus) ranking\nand the outcome is known to depend sensibly on the adopted rule. Building upon\nXVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter\nsatisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension)\nto guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as\nequally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of\nrankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most\negalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian\nrankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to\nfluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze)\noften turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced\nprovides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of\nall the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus\nranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian\ncompared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.\n", "  We investigate intrinsic and extrinsic decay of edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs)\nin graphene quantum Hall (QH) systems by high-frequency electronic\nmeasurements. From EMP resonances in disk shaped graphene, we show that the\ndispersion relation of EMPs is nonlinear due to interactions, giving rise to\nintrinsic decay of EMP wavepacket. We also identify extrinsic dissipation\nmechanisms due to interaction with localized states in bulk graphene from the\ndecay time of EMP wavepackets. We indicate that, owing to the unique linear and\ngapless band structure, EMP dissipation in graphene can be lower than that in\nGaAs systems.\n", "  In any theory satisfying the no-signaling principle correlations generated\namong spatially separated parties in a Bell-type experiment are subject to\ncertain constraints known as monogamy relations. Recently, in the context of\nthe black hole information loss problem it was suggested that these monogamy\nrelations might be violated. This in turn implies that correlations arising in\nsuch a scenario must violate the no-signaling principle and hence can be used\nto send classical information between parties. Here, we study the amount of\ninformation that can be sent using such correlations. To this aim, we first\nprovide a framework associating them with classical channels whose capacities\nare then used to quantify the usefulness of these correlations in sending\ninformation. Finally, we determine the minimal amount of information that can\nbe sent using signaling correlations violating the monogamy relation associated\nto the chained Bell inequalities.\n", "  Graded bundles are a class of graded manifolds which represent a natural\ngeneralisation of vector bundles and include the higher order tangent bundles\nas canonical examples. We present and study the concept of the linearisation of\ngraded bundle which allows us to define the notion of the linear dual of a\ngraded bundle. They are examples of double structures, graded-linear\n($\\mathcal{GL}$) bundles, including double vector bundles as a particular case.\nOn $\\mathcal{GL}$-bundles we define what we shall call weighted algebroids,\nwhich are to be understood as algebroids in the category of graded bundles.\nThey can be considered as a geometrical framework for higher order Lagrangian\nmechanics. Canonical examples are reductions of higher tangent bundles of Lie\ngroupoids. Weighted algebroids represent also a generalisation of\n$\\mathcal{VB}$-algebroids as defined by Gracia-Saz & Mehta and the\n$\\mathcal{LA}$-bundles of Mackenzie. The resulting structures are strikingly\nsimilar to Voronov's higher Lie algebroids, however our approach does not\nrequire the initial structures to be defined on supermanifolds.\n", "  The layered structure of tetragonal Ni(CN)2, consisting of square-planar\nNi(CN)4 units linked in the a-b plane, with no true periodicity along the\nc-axis, is expected to show anisotropic compression on the application of\npressure. High-pressure neutron diffraction (elastic) and inelastic neutron\nscattering experiments have been performed on polycrystalline Ni(CN)2 to\ninvestigate its compressibility and stability. The intralayer a lattice\nparameter does not show any appreciable variation with increase of pressure up\nto 2.7 kbar. Above this pressure value, a decrease in a is observed. The c\nlattice parameter decreases slowly up to 1 kbar, then decreases sharply up to\n20 kbar. It does not show any significant variation with further pressure\nincrease up to 50 kbar. The response of the lattice parameters to the applied\npressure is strongly anisotropic as the interlayer spacing (along the c-axis)\nshows a significantly larger contraction than the a-b plane. The experimental\npressure dependence of the volume data is fitted to a bulk modulus, B0, of 1050\n(20) kbar over the pressure range 0-1 kbar, and to 154 (2) kbar in the range\n1-50 kbar. The change in the slope of the lattice parameters at 1 kbar is also\nsupported by high-pressure Raman measurements, which indicate a phase\ntransition at 1 kbar. Probably arising from a change in the CN ordering within\nthe Ni(CN)2 layers. Raman measurements, performed up to 200 kbar, highlight the\npossible existence of a second phase transition taking place at about 70 kbar.\nOur neutron inelastic scattering measurements of the pressure dependence of the\nphonon spectra performed up to 2.7 kbar, also support the occurrence of a phase\ntransition at low pressure.\n", "  The latest results on the measurement of the properties of the new boson with\nmass around 125 GeV are reported. The analysis uses pp collision data recorded\nby the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1\n$fb^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and 19.6 $fb^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV. The\nboson is observed in the $H \\to ZZ \\to 4\\ell$ channel ($\\ell = e, \\mu$) and its\nmass is measured, giving the most precise result ever achieved. Moreover, the\nfirst experimental constraint on Higgs total width using $H \\to ZZ \\to 4\\ell$\nevents is presented, setting an upper limit of 33 MeV at 95\\% confidence level\n(42 MeV expected). The spin-parity of the boson is studied and the pure scalar\nhypothesis is found to be consistent with the observation, when compared to the\nother spin-parity hypotheses. No other significant Standard Model Higgs-like\nexcess is found in the search and upper limits at 95\\% condence level exclude\nthe range 129.5 -832.0 GeV.\n", "  We review the limitations to the use of the effective field theory approach\nto study dark matter at the LHC. Due to the high energy reach, the low energy\ndescription breaks down, and may lead to incorrect results. The use of\nsimplified models is suggested.\n", "  We present a coupled-channel Lagrangian approach (GiM) to describe the $\\pi N\n\\to \\pi N$, $2\\pi N$ scattering in the resonance energy region. The $2\\pi N$\nproduction has been significantly improved by using the isobar approximation\nwith $\\sigma N$ and $\\pi \\Delta(1232)$ in the intermediate state. The\nthree-body unitarity is maintained up to interference pattern between the\nisobar subchannels. The scattering amplitudes are obtained as a solution of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation in the $K$ matrix approximation. As a first application\nwe perform a partial wave analysis of the $\\pi N \\to \\pi N$, $\\pi^0\\pi^0 N$\nreactions in the Roper resonance region. We obtain $R_{\\sigma\nN}(1440)=27^{+4}_{-9}$\\,\\% and $R_{\\sigma N}(1440)=12^{+5}_{-3}$\\,\\% for the\n$\\sigma N$ and $\\pi \\Delta$ decay branching ratios of $N^*(1440)$ respectively.\nThe extracted $\\pi N$ inelasticities and reaction amplitudes are consistent\nwith the results from other groups.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the generalized Gauss-Bonnet action in\n$4$-dimensional Weyl-Cartan space-time. In this space-time, the presence of\ntorsion tensor and Weyl vector implies that the generalized Gauss-Bonnet action\nwill not be a total derivative in four dimension space-time. It will be shown\nthat the higher than two time derivatives can be removed from the action by\nchoosing suitable set of parameters. In the special case where only the trace\npart of the torsion remains, the model reduces to GR plus two vector fields.\nOne of which is massless and the other is massive. We will then obtain the\nhealthy region of the 5-dimensional parameter space of the theory in some\nspecial cases.\n", "  We generate 555.8nm light with sub-MHz linewidth through the use of laser\ninjection-locking of a semiconductor diode at 1111.6nm, followed by frequency\ndoubling in a resonant cavity. The integrity of the injection lock is\ninvestigated by studying an offset-beat signal between slave and master lasers,\nby performing spectroscopy on the $(6s)^{2}$ $^{1}S_{0}-\\,(6s6p)$ $^{3}P_{1}$\ntransition in magneto-optically trapped ytterbium, and by demonstrating\nadditional laser cooling of $^{171}$Yb with the 555.8nm light. For the\n$^{1}S_{0}-$ $^{3}P_{1}$ spectroscopy, we confirm the linear dependence between\nground state linewidth and the intensity of an off-resonant laser, namely, that\nused to cool Yb atoms in a $^{1}S_{0}-$ $^{1}P_{1}$ magneto-optical trap. Our\nresults demonstrate the suitability of injection locked 1100-1130nm laser\ndiodes as a source for sub-MHz linewidth radiation in the yellow-green\nspectrum.\n", "  We present the theory of a new amplification regime in Travelling Wave Tubes\n(TWTs) composed of a slow-wave periodic structure that supports multiple\nelectromagnetic modes that can all be synchronized with the electron beam. The\ninteraction between the multimodal slow-wave structure and the electron beam is\nquantified using a Multi Transmission Line approach (MTL) based on a\ngeneralized Pierce model and transfer matrix analysis leading to the\nidentification of modes with complex Bloch wavenumber. In particular, we\naddress a new possible operation condition for TWTs based on the super\nsynchronism between an electron beam and four modes exhibiting a degeneracy\ncondition near a band edge of the periodic slowwave MTL. We show a\nphenomenological change in the band structure of periodic MTL where we observe\nat least two growing modal cooperating solutions as opposed to a uniform MTL\ninteracting with an electron beam where there is rigorously only one growing\nmodal solution. We discuss the advantage of using such a degeneracy condition\nin TWTs that leads to larger gain conditions in amplifier regimes and also to\nvery lowstarting beam current in high power oscillators.\n", "  Berry's approach on \"transitionless quantum driving\" shows how to set a\nHamiltonian which drives the dynamics of a system along instantaneous\neigenstates of a reference Hamiltonian to reproduce the same final result of an\nadiabatic process in a shorter time. In this paper, motivated by transitionless\nquantum driving, we construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three-atom\nsystem to create the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with the help of\nquantum Zeno dynamics and of non-resonant lasers. The influence of various\ndecoherence processes is discussed by numerical simulation and the result\nproves that the scheme is fast and robust against decoherence and operational\nimperfection.\n", "  We address two sets of long-standing open questions in probability theory,\nfrom a computational complexity perspective: divisibility of stochastic maps,\nand divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions. We prove\nthat finite divisibility of stochastic maps is an NP-complete problem, and\nextend this result to nonnegative matrices, and completely-positive\ntrace-preserving maps, i.e. the quantum analogue of stochastic maps. We further\nprove a complexity hierarchy for the divisibility and decomposability of\nprobability distributions, showing that finite distribution divisibility is in\nP, but decomposability is NP-hard. For the former, we give an explicit\npolynomial-time algorithm. All results on distributions extend to\nweak-membership formulations, proving that the complexity of these problems is\nrobust to perturbations.\n", "  Wikipedia has claimed for over three years now that John von Neumann was the\n\"first quantum Bayesian.\" In context, this reads as stating that von Neumann\ninaugurated QBism, the approach to quantum theory promoted by Fuchs, Mermin and\nSchack. This essay explores how such a claim is, historically speaking,\nunsupported.\n", "  Landauer's principle sets fundamental thermodynamical constraints for\nclassical and quantum information processing, thus affecting not only various\nbranches of physics, but also of computer science and engineering. Despite its\nimportance, this principle was only recently experimentally considered for\nclassical systems. Here we employ a nuclear magnetic resonance setup to\nexperimentally address the information to energy conversion in a quantum\nsystem. Specifically, we consider a three nuclear spins $S=1/2$ (qubits)\nmolecule ---the system, the reservoir and the ancilla--- to measure the heat\ndissipated during the implementation of a global system-reservoir unitary\ninteraction that changes the information content of the system. By employing an\ninterferometric technique we were able to reconstruct the heat distribution\nassociated with the unitary interaction. Then, through quantum state\ntomography, we measured the relative change in the entropy of the system. In\nthis way we were able to verify that an operation that changes the information\ncontent of the system must necessary generate heat in the reservoir, exactly as\npredicted by Landauer's principle. The scheme presented here allows for the\ndetailed study of irreversible entropy production in quantum information\nprocessors.\n", "  Motivated by applications to the study of ultracold atomic gases near the\nunitarity limit, we investigate the structure of the operator product expansion\n(OPE) in non-relativistic conformal field theories (NRCFTs). The main tool used\nin our analysis is the representation theory of charged (i.e. non-zero particle\nnumber) operators in the NRCFT, in particular the mapping between operators and\nstates in a non-relativistic \"radial quantization\" Hilbert space. Our results\ninclude: a determination of the OPE coefficients of descendant operators in\nterms of those of the underlying primary state, a demonstration of convergence\nof the (imaginary time) OPE in certain kinematic limits, and an estimate of the\ndecay rate of the OPE tail inside matrix elements which, as in relativistic\nCFTs, depends exponentially on operator dimensions. To illustrate our results\nwe consider several examples, including a strongly interacting field theory of\nbosons tuned to the unitarity limit, as well as a class of holographic models.\nGiven the similarity with known statements about the OPE in SO(2,d) invariant\nfield theories, our results suggest the existence of a bootstrap approach to\nconstraining NRCFTs, with applications to bound state spectra and interactions.\nWe briefly comment on a possible implementation of this non-relativistic\nconformal bootstrap program.\n", "  We describe statistical and coherence properties of the radiation from x-ray\nfree electron lasers (XFEL) operating in the post-saturation regime. We\nconsider practical case of the SASE3 FEL at the European XFEL. We perform\ncomparison of the main characteristics of the X-ray FEL operating in the\npost-saturation regime with and without undulator tapering: efficiency,\ncoherence time and degree of transverse coherence.\n", "  A brief review is given of the implications of a 126 GeV Higgs boson for the\ndiscovery of supersymmetry. Thus a 126 GeV Higgs boson is problematic within\nthe Standard Model because of vacuum instability pointing to new physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. The problem of vacuum stability is overcome in the SUGRA\nGUT model but the 126 GeV Higgs mass implies that the average SUSY scale lies\nin the several TeV region. The largeness of the SUSY scale relieves the tension\non SUGRA models since it helps suppress flavor changing neutral currents and CP\nviolating effects and also helps in extending the proton life time arising from\nbaryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators. The geometry of\nradiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry and fine tuning in view of the\nlarge SUSY scale are analyzed.Consistency with the Brookhaven $g_{\\mu}-2$\nresult is discussed. It is also shown that a large SUSY scale implied by the\n126 GeV Higgs boson mass allows for light gauginos (gluino, charginos,\nneutralinos) and sleptons. These along with the lighter third generation\nsquarks are the prime candidates for discovery at RUN II of the LHC.\nImplication of the 126 GeV Higgs boson for the direct search for dark matter is\ndiscussed. Also discussed are the sparticles mass hierarchies and their\nrelationship with the simplified models under the Higgs boson mass constraint.\n", "  If we live on the weak brane with zero effective cosmological constant in a\nwarped 5D bulk spacetime, gravitational waves and brane fluctuations can be\ngenerated by a part of the 5D Weyl tensor and carries information of the\ngravitational field outside the brane. We consider on a cylindrical symmetric\nwarped FRW background the U(1) self-gravitating scalar-gauge field without bulk\nmatter. It turns out that \"branons\" can be formed dynamically, due to the\nmodified energy-momentum tensor components of the cosmic string. As a result,\nwe find that the late-time behavior could be significant deviate from the\nstandard evolution of the universe. The effect is triggered by the\ntime-dependent warp factor, of the form $\\sqrt{ae^{\\tau t}+be^{-\\tau t}}$ and\nthe modified brane equations, comparable with a dark energy effect. This is a\nbrane-world mechanism, not present is standard 4D FRW, where the large\ndisturbances are rapidly damped as the expansion proceed. Because gravity can\npropagate in the bulk, the cosmic string can build up a huge angle deficit (or\nmass per unit length) by the warp factor. Disturbances in the spatial\ncomponents of the stress-energy tensor cause cylindrical symmetric waves,\namplified due to the presence of the bulk space and warpfactor. This long range\neffect could also explain the recently found spooky alignment of quasars in\nvast structures in the cosmic web.\n", "  In two-phase flow simulations, a difficult issue is usually the treatment of\nsurface tension effects. These cause a pressure jump that is proportional to\nthe curvature of the interface separating the two fluids. Since the evaluation\nof the curvature incorporates second derivatives, it is prone to numerical\ninstabilities. Within this work, the interface is described by a level-set\nmethod based on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In order to stabilize\nthe evaluation of the curvature, a patch-recovery operation is employed. There\nare numerous ways in which this filtering operation can be applied in the whole\nprocess of curvature computation. Therefore, an extensive numerical study is\nperformed to identify optimal settings for the patch-recovery operations with\nrespect to computational cost and accuracy.\n", "  To examine thermoelectric (TE) properties of a semiconductor nanowire (NW)\nnetwork, we propose a theoretical approach mapping the TE network on a two-port\nnetwork. In contrast to a conventional single-port (i.e., resistor) network\nmodel, our model allows for large scale calculations showing convergence of TE\nfigure of merit, $ZT$, with an increasing number of junctions. Using this\nmodel, numerical simulations are performed for the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ branched\nnanowire (BNW) and Cayley tree NW (CTNW) network. We find that the phonon\nscattering at the network junctions plays a dominant role in enhancing the\nnetwork $ZT$. Specifically, disordered BNW and CTNW demonstrate an order of\nmagnitude higher ZT enhancement compared to their ordered counterparts.\nFormation of preferential TE pathways in CTNW makes the network effectively\nbehave as its BNW counterpart. We provide formalism for simulating large scale\nnanowire networks hinged upon experimentally measurable TE parameters of a\nsingle T-junction.\n", "  We discuss the dynamics of parton cascades that develop in dense QCD matter,\nand contrast their properties with those of similar cascades of gluon radiation\nin vacuum. We argue that such cascades belong to two distinct classes that are\ncharacterized respectively by an increasing or a constant (or decreasing)\nbranching rate along the cascade. In the former class, of which the BDMPS,\nmedium-induced, cascade constitutes a typical example, it takes a finite time\nto transport a finite amount of energy to very soft quanta, while this time is\nessentially infinite in the latter case, to which the DGLAP cascade belongs.\nThe medium induced cascade is accompanied by a constant flow of energy towards\narbitrary soft modes, leading eventually to the accumulation of the initial\nenergy of the leading particle at zero energy. It also exhibits scaling\nproperties akin to wave turbulence. These properties do not show up in the\ncascade that develops in vacuum. There, the energy accumulates in the spectrum\nat smaller and smaller energy as the cascade develops, but the energy never\nflows all the way down to zero energy. Our analysis suggests that the way the\nenergy is shared among the offsprings of a splitting gluon has little impact on\nthe qualitative properties of the cascades, provided the kernel that governs\nthe splittings is not too singular.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of particle-laden turbulent flow in\nstraight, mildly curved and strongly bent pipes are performed in which the\nsolid phase is modelled as small heavy spherical particles. A total of seven\npopulations of dilute particles with different Stokes numbers, one-way coupled\nwith their carrier phase, are simulated. The objective is to examine the effect\nof the curvature on micro-particle transport and accumulation. It is shown that\neven a slight non-zero curvature in the flow configuration strongly impact the\nparticle concentration map such that the concentration of inertial particles\nwith bulk Stokes number 0.45 (based on bulk velocity and pipe radius) at the\ninner-bend wall of mildly curved pipe becomes 12.8 times larger than that in\nthe viscous sublayer of the straight pipe. Near-wall helicoidal particle\nstreaks are observed in the curved configurations with their inclination\nvarying with the strength of the secondary motion of the carrier phase. A\nreflection layer, as previously observed in particle laden turbulent S-shaped\nchannels, is also apparent in the strongly curved pipe with heavy particles. In\naddition, depending on the curvature, the central regions of the mean Dean\nvortices appear to be completely depleted of particles, as observed also in the\npartially re-laminarised region at the inner bend. The turbophoretic drift of\nthe particles is shown to be affected by weak and strong secondary motions of\nthe carrier phase and geometry-induced centrifugal forces. The first and\nsecond-order moments of the velocity and acceleration of the particulate phase\nin the same configurations are addressed in a companion paper by the same\nauthors. The current data-set will be useful for modelling particles advected\nin wall-bounded turbulent flows where the effects of the curvature are not\nnegligible.\n", "  Compact laser-driven accelerators are versatile and powerful tools of\nunarguable relevance on societal grounds for the diverse purposes of science,\nhealth, security, and technology because they bring enormous practicality to\nstate-of-the-art achievements of conventional radio-frequency accelerators.\nCurrent benchmarking laser-based technologies rely on a medium to assist the\nlight-matter interaction, which impose material limitations or strongly\ninhomogeneous fields. The advent of few cycle ultra-intense radially polarized\nlasers has materialized an extensively studied novel accelerator that adopts\nthe simplest form of laser acceleration and is unique in requiring no medium to\nachieve strong longitudinal energy transfer directly from laser to particle.\nHere we present the first observation of direct longitudinal laser acceleration\nof non-relativistic electrons that undergo highly-directional multi-GeV/m\naccelerating gradients. This demonstration opens a new frontier for direct\nlaser-driven particle acceleration capable of creating well collimated and\nrelativistic attosecond electron bunches and x-ray pulses.\n", "  Solvation of the lithium ion (Li+) in dimethoxyethane (DME) and propylene\ncarbonate (PC) is of scientific significance and urgency in the context of\nlithium-ion batteries. I report PM7-MD simulations on the composition of Li+\nsolvation shells (SH) in a few DME/PC mixtures. The equimolar mixture features\npreferential solvation by PC, in agreement with classical MD studies. However,\none DME molecule is always present in the first SH, supplementing the cage\nformed by five PC molecules. As PC molecules get removed, DME gradually\nsubstitutes vacant places. In the PC-poor mixtures, an entire SH is populated\nby five DME molecules.\n", "  The objective of this work is to understand how the characteristics of\nrelativistic MHD turbulence may differ from those of nonrelativistic MHD\nturbulence. We accomplish this by studying the ideal invariants in the\nrelativistic case and comparing them to what we know of nonrelativistic\nturbulence. Although much work has been done to understand the dynamics of\nnonrelativistic systems (mostly for ideal incompressible fluids), there is\nminimal literature explicitly describing the dynamics of relativistic MHD\nturbulence using numerical simulations. Many researchers simply assume that\nrelativistic turbulence has the same invariants and obeys the same dynamics as\nnon-relativistic systems our results show that this assumption may be\nincorrect.\n", "  In a Dark left-right gauge model, the neutral component of right-handed\nlepton doublet is odd under generalized R-parity and thus the lightest one\nserves as the dark matter (DM) candidate. The coannihilation of the dark matter\nwith the singly charged Higgs triplet produces the correct relic abundance. We\nexplain AMS-02 positron excess by the annihilation of 800 GeV dark matter into\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma$, through a t-channel exchange of the additional charged\ntriplet Higgs boson. The DM is leptophilic which is useful for explaining the\nnon-observation of any antiproton excess which would generically be expected\nfrom DM annihilation. The large cross-section needed to explain AMS-02 also\nrequires an astrophysical boost. In addition, we show that the muon $(g-2)$\nreceives required contribution from singly and doubly charged triplet Higgs in\nthe loops.\n", "  We develop a variational optimization method for crystal analysis in atomic\nresolution images, which uses information from a 2D synchrosqueezed transform\n(SST) as input. The synchrosqueezed transform is applied to extract initial\ninformation from atomic crystal images: crystal defects, rotations and the\ngradient of elastic deformation. The deformation gradient estimate is then\nimproved outside the identified defect region via a variational approach, to\nobtain more robust results agreeing better with the physical constraints. The\nvariational model is optimized by a nonlinear projected conjugate gradient\nmethod. Both examples of images from computer simulations and imaging\nexperiments are analyzed, with results demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n", "  We derive and study two different formalisms used for non-equilibrium\nprocesses: The coherent-state path integral, and an effective, coarse-grained\nstochastic equation of motion. We first study the coherent-state path integral\nand the corresponding field theory, using the annihilation process $A+A\\to A$\nas an example. The field theory contains counter-intuitive quartic vertices. We\nshow how they can be interpreted in terms of a first-passage problem.\nReformulating the coherent-state path integral as a stochastic equation of\nmotion, the noise generically becomes imaginary. This renders it not only\ndifficult to interpret, but leads to convergence problems at finite times. We\nthen show how alternatively an effective coarse-grained stochastic equation of\nmotion with real noise can be constructed. The procedure is similar in spirit\nto the derivation of the mean-field approximation for the Ising model, and the\nensuing construction of its effective field theory. We finally apply our\nfindings to stochastic Manna sandpiles. We show that the coherent-state path\nintegral is inappropriate, or at least inconvenient. As an alternative, we\nderive and solve its mean-field approximation, which we then use to construct a\ncoarse-grained stochastic equation of motion with real noise.\n", "  We study the low energy effective theory describing gravity with broken\nspatial diffeomorphism invariance. In the unitary gauge, the Goldstone bosons\nassociated with broken diffeomorphisms are eaten and the graviton becomes a\nmassive spin-2 particle with 5 well-behaved degrees of freedom. In this gauge,\nthe most general theory is built with the lowest dimension operators invariant\nunder only temporal diffeomorphisms. Imposing the additional shift and SO(3)\ninternal symmetries, we analyze the perturbations on a FRW background. At\nlinear perturbation level, the observables of this theory are characterized by\nfive parameters, including the usual cosmological parameters and one additional\ncoupling constant for the symmetry-breaking scalars. In the de Sitter and\nMinkowski limit, the three Goldstone bosons are supermassive and can be\nintegrated out, leaving two massive tensor modes as the only propagating\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss several examples relevant to theories of massive\ngravity.\n", "  A new spintronic theory has been developed for the magnetic tunnel junction\n(MTJ) with single-crystal barrier. The barrier will be treated as a diffraction\ngrating with intralayer periodicity, the diffracted waves of tunneling\nelectrons thus contain strong coherence, both in charge and especially in spin.\nThe theory can answer the two basic problems present in MgO-based MTJs: (1) Why\ndoes the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) oscillate with the barrier\nthickness? (2) Why is the TMR still far away from infinity when the two\nelectrodes are both half-metallic? Other principal features of TMR can also be\nexplained and reproduced by the present work. It also provides possible ways to\nmodulate the oscillation of TMR, and to enhance TMR so that it can tend to\ninfinity. Within the theory, the barrier, as a periodic diffraction grating,\ncan get rid of the confinement in width, it can vary from nanoscale to\nmicroscale. Based on those results, a future-generation MTJ is proposed where\nthe three pieces can be fabricated separately and then assembled together, it\nis especially appropriate for the layered materials, e.g., MoS2 and graphite,\nand most feasible for industries.\n", "  A coefficient inverse problem for a parabolic equation is considered. Using a\nCarleman Weight Function, a globally strictly convex cost functional is\nconstructed for this problem.\n", "  Under the presence of ultra high intensity lasers or other intense\nelectromagnetic fields the motion of particles in the ultrarelativistic regime\ncan be severely affected by radiation reaction. The standard particle-in-cell\n(PIC) algorithms do not include radiation reaction effects. Even though this is\na well known mechanism, there is not yet a definite algorithm nor a standard\ntechnique to include radiation reaction in PIC codes. We have compared several\nmodels for the calculation of the radiation reaction force, with the goal of\nimplementing an algorithm for classical radiation reaction in the Osiris\nframework, a state-of-the-art PIC code. The results of the different models are\ncompared with standard analytical results, and the relevance/advantages of each\nmodel are discussed. Numerical issues relevant to PIC codes such as resolution\nrequirements, application of radiation reaction to macro particles and\ncomputational cost are also addressed. The Landau and Lifshitz reduced model is\nchosen for implementation.\n", "  We analyze both the s- and p-wave collision induced frequency shifts and\npropose a over-$\\pi$ pulse scheme to cancel the shifts in optical lattice\nclocks interrogated by a Rabi pulse. The collisional frequency shifts are\nanalytically solved as a function of the pulse area and the inhomogeneity of\nthe Rabi frequencies. Experimentally measured collisional frequency shifts in\nan Yb optical lattice clock are in good agreement with the analytical\ncalculations. Based on our analysis, the over-$\\pi$ pulse combined with a small\ninhomogeneity below 0.1 allows a fractional uncertainty on a level of\n$10^{-18}$ in both Sr and Yb optical lattice clocks by canceling the\ncollisional frequency shift.\n", "  We look at the time dependent fluctuations of the electrical charge in an\nopen 1D quantum system represented by a quantum dot experiencing random lateral\nmotion. In essentially non-adiabatic settings we study both diffusive and\nballistic (Levy) regimes of the barrier motion where the electric current as\nwell as the net pumped electric charge experience random fluctuations over the\nstatic background. We show that in the large-time limit, $t \\to \\infty$, the\nwavefunction is naturally separated into the Berry-phase component (resulting\nfrom the singular part of the wave amplitude in the co-moving frame) and the\nnon-adiabatic correction (arising from fast oscillating, slow decaying tails of\nthe same amplitude). Based on this separation we report two key results:\nFirstly, the disorder averaged wave function and current are asymptotically\nmainly determined by the same Berry phase contribution that applies in the case\nof adiabatic motion. Secondly, after a short transition period the pumped\nelectric charge exhibits fluctuations that grow much faster than predicted by\nthe adiabatic theory. We also derive the exact expressions for the average\npropagator (in the co-moving basis representation) for the diffusive and\nballistic types of motion considered.\n", "  When a mm-sized liquid drop approaches a deep liquid pool, both the interface\nof the drop and the pool deform before the drop touches the pool. The build up\nof air pressure prior to coalescence is responsible for this deformation. Due\nto this deformation, air can be entrained at the bottom of the drop during the\nimpact. We quantify the amount of entrained air numerically, using the Boundary\nIntegral Method (BIM) for potential flow for the drop and the pool, coupled to\nviscous lubrication theory for the air film that has to be squeezed out during\nimpact. We compare our results to various experimental data and find excellent\nagreement for the amount of air that is entrapped during impact onto a pool.\nNext, the impact of a rigid sphere onto a pool is numerically investigated and\nthe air that is entrapped in this case also matches with available experimental\ndata. In both cases of drop and sphere impact onto a pool the numerical air\nbubble volume V_b is found to be in agreement with the theoretical scaling\nV_b/V_{drop/sphere} ~ St^{-4/3}, where St is the Stokes number. This is the\nsame scaling that has been found for drop impact onto a solid surface in\nprevious research. This implies a universal mechanism for air entrainment for\nthese different impact scenarios, which has been suggested in recent\nexperimental work, but is now further elucidated with numerical results.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\neffect by cross-correlating 21-cm surveys at high redshifts with galaxies, in a\nway similar to the usual CMB-galaxy cross-correlation. The high-redshift 21-cm\nsignal is dominated by CMB photons that travel freely without interacting with\nthe intervening matter, and hence its late-time ISW signature should correlate\nextremely well with that of the CMB at its peak frequencies. Using the 21-cm\ntemperature brightness instead of the CMB would thus be a further check of the\ndetection of the ISW effect, measured by different instruments at different\nfrequencies and suffering from different systematics. We also study the ISW\neffect on the photons that are scattered by HI clouds. We show that a detection\nof the unscattered photons is achievable with planned radio arrays, while one\nusing scattered photons will require advanced radio interferometers, either an\nextended version of the planned Square Kilometre Array or futuristic\nexperiments such as a lunar radio array.\n", "  We investigate in detail the LiTE of the most probable binary candidate TU\nUMa. We used a new code applied on previously available and newly determined\nmaxima timings to confirm binarity and refine parameters of the orbit of the\nRRab component in the binary system. The binary hypothesis is also tested using\nRV measurements. We used new approach to determine brightness maxima timings\nbased on template fitting. This can also be used on sparse or scattered data.\nThis approach was successfully applied on measurements from different sources.\nTo determine the orbital parameters of the double star TU UMa, we developed a\nnew code to analyse LiTE that also includes secular variation in the pulsation\nperiod. Its usability was successfully tested on CL Aur, an eclipsing binary\nwith mass-transfer in a triple system that shows similar changes in the O-C\ndiagram. Since orbital motion would cause systematic shifts in mean RVs\n(dominated by pulsations), we computed and compared our model with\ncentre-of-mass velocities. They were determined using high-quality templates of\nRV curves of RRab stars. Maxima timings adopted from the GEOS database (168)\ntogether with those newly determined from sky surveys and new measurements (85)\nwere used to construct an O-C diagram spanning almost five proposed orbital\ncycles. This data set is three times larger than data sets used by previous\nauthors. Modelling of the O-C dependence resulted in 23.3-year orbital period,\nwhich translates into a minimum mass of the second component of about 0.33 M_s.\nSecular changes in the pulsation period of TU UMa over the whole O-C diagram\nwere satisfactorily approximated by a parabolic trend with a rate of -2.2\nms/yr. To confirm binarity, we used RV measurements from nine independent\nsources. Although our results are convincing, additional long-term monitoring\nis necessary to unambiguously confirm the binarity of TU UMa.\n", "  We study volume transition phenomenon in hydrogels within the framework of\nFlory-Rehner thermodynamic modelling; we show that starting from different\nmodels for the Flory parameter different conclusions can be achieved, in terms\nof admissible coexisting equilibria of the system. In particular, with explicit\nreference to a one-dimensional problem we establish the ranges of both\ntemperature and traction which allow for the coexistence of a swollen and a\nshrunk phase. Through consideration of an augmented Flory-Rehner free-energy,\nwhich also accounts for the gradient of volume changes, we determine the\nposition of the interface between the coexisting phases, and capture the\nconnection profile between them.\n", "  Within the quantum Darwinist framework introduced by W. H. Zurek ({\\em Nat.\nPhys.}, 5:181-188, 2009), observers obtain pointer-state information about\nquantum systems by interacting with a local sample of the surrounding\nenvironment, e.g. a local sample of the ambient photon field. Because the\nenvironment encodes such pointer state information uniformly and hence\nredundantly throughout its entire volume, the information is equally available\nto all observers regardless of their location. This framework is applied to the\nobservation of stellar center-of-mass positions, which are assumed to be\nencoded by the ambient photon field in a way that is uniformly accessible to\nall possible observers. Assuming Landauer's Principle, constructing such\nenvironmental encodings requires $(ln2) kT$ per encoded bit. For the observed\n10$^{24}$ stars and a uniform binary encoding of center-of-mass positions into\nvoxels with a linear dimension of 5 km, the free energy required at the current\nCMB temperature T = 2.7 K is $\\sim$ 2.5 $\\cdot$ 10$^{-27}$ kg $\\cdot$ m$^{-3}$,\nstrikingly close to the observed value of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\rho_{c}$.\nDecreasing the voxel size to $(l_{P})^{3}$ results in a free energy requirement\n10$^{117}$ times larger.\n", "  Two-dimensional 6,6,18-graphdiyne and the corresponding one-dimensional\nnanoribbons are investigated using crystal orbital method. Based on HSE06\nfunctional, the one-dimensional confinement increases the band gaps. With band\ngaps larger than 0.4 eV, thirty-three 6,6,18-graphdiyne nanoribbons have larger\nmajority carrier mobilities at room temperature than the highest value of\narmchair graphene nanoribbons. Unlike {\\gamma}-graphdiyne, 6,6,18-graphdiyne\nnanoribbons have both huge hole and electron mobilities, depending on whether\nthey are armchair or zigzag type. The huge mobilities are explained by crystal\norbital analysis. The superior capabilities of 6,6,18-graphdiyne nanoribbons\nmake them possible candidates for high speed electronic devices in\ncomplementary circuits.\n", "  FLASH is the first free electron laser user facility operating in the vacuum\nultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelength range. Many user experiments require\nknowledge of the spatial and temporal coherence properties of the radiation. In\nthis paper we present an analysis of the coherence properties of the radiation\nfor the fundamental and for the higher odd frequency harmonics. We show that\ntemporal and spatial coherence reach maximum close to the FEL saturation but\nmay degrade significantly in the post-saturation regime. We also find that the\npointing stability of short FEL pulses is limited due to the fact that\nnon-azimuthal FEL eigenmodes are not sufficiently suppressed. We discuss\npossible ways for improving the degree of transverse coherence and the pointing\nstability.\n", "  Models with Dirac gauginos provide appealing scenarios for physics beyond the\nstandard model. They have smaller radiative corrections to the Higgs mass, a\nsuppression of certain SUSY production processes, and ameliorated flavor\nconstraints. Unfortunately, they also generally have tachyons, the solutions to\nwhich typically spoil these positive features. The recently proposed \"Goldstone\nGaugino\" mechanism provides a simple solution that eliminates these tachyonic\nstates. We provide details on this mechanism and explore models for its origin.\nIn particular, we find SUSY QCD models that realize this idea simply, and\ndiscuss scenarios for unification.\n", "  Tin Sulphide is a layered compound which retains its structure when deposited\nas thin films by thermal evaporation. The films were found to have oriented\ngrowth with the direction of orientation changing with film thickness. The\nfilm's morphology was found to change with orientation. The poor conductivity\nof the thicker samples made it difficult to make photocunductivity\ncharacterisation. However, unlike reported the thinner samples showed\nphoto-sensitivity to be independent of film thickness and grain size with a\nhigh persistent photocurrent. With their absorption, photosensitivty, optimum\nband-gap and traps within the band-gap giving the charge carriers a longer\nlife-time, thin samples of tin sulphide gives adequate scope designing\nefficient photovoltaics. The refractive index was modeled using Sellmeir's\nmodel, while most of the previous studies talk of Wemple-DiDomenico single\noscillator model or Cauchy's dispersion relation. The Sellmeir's fitting\nparameters are reported which can be of use in ellipsometric studies.\n", "  Explicit analytical expressions for the drag and diffusion coefficients of a\nspherical particle attached to the interface between two immiscible fluids are\nconstructed for the case of a small viscosity ratio between the fluid phases.\nThe model is designed to explicitly account for the dependence on the contact\nangle between the two fluids and the solid surface. The Lorentz reciprocal\ntheorem is applied in the context of a geometric perturbation approach, which\nis based on the deviation of the contact angle from a 90{\\deg}-value. By\ntesting the model against experimental and numerical data from the literature,\ngood agreement is found within the entire range of contact angles below\n90{\\deg}. As an advantage of the method reported, the drag and diffusion\ncoefficients can be calculated up to second order in the perturbation\nparameter, while it is sufficient to know the velocity and pressure fields only\nup to first order. Extensions to other particle shapes with known velocity and\npressure fields are straightforward.\n", "  Although the Aharonov-Bohm and related effects are familiar in solid state\nand high energy physics, the nonlocality of these effects has been questioned.\nHere we show, for the first time, that the Aharonov-Bohm effect has two very\ndifferent aspects. One aspect is instantaneous and nonlocal; the other aspect,\nwhich depends on entanglement, unfolds continuously over time. While local,\ngauge-invariant variables may occasionally suffice for explaining the\ncontinuous aspect, we argue that they cannot explain the instantaneous aspect.\nThus the Aharonov-Bohm effect is, in general, nonlocal.\n", "  We propose a theoretical framework based on $SU(3)$ coherent states as a\nconvenient tool to describe the collective state of a Bose-Einstein condensate\nof spin 1 atoms at thermal equilibrium. We work within the single-mode\napproximation, which assumes that all atoms condense in the same spatial mode.\nIn this system, the magnetization $m_z$ is conserved to a very good\napproximation. This conservation law is included by introducing a prior\ndistribution for $m_z$ and constructing a generalized statistical ensemble that\npreserves its first moments. In the limit of large particle numbers, we\nconstruct the partition function at thermal equilibrium and use it to compute\nvarious quantities of experimental interest, such as the probability\ndistribution function and moments of the population in each Zeeman state. When\n$N$ is large but finite (as in typical experiments, where $N\\sim 10^3-10^5$),\nwe find that fluctuations of the collective spin can be important.\n", "  We study the effect of a single impurity on the transport properties of a one\ndimensional quantum liquid highly excited away from its ground state by a\nsudden quench of the bulk interaction. In particular we compute the time\ndependent dc current to leading order in the impurity potential, using\nbosonization and starting both from the limit of a uniform system and from the\none of two decoupled semi-infinite systems. Our results reveal that the\nnonequilibrium excitation of bulk modes induced by the global quench has\nimportant effects on the conductor-insulator quantum phase transition, which\nturns into a crossover for any small quench amplitude. In addition, the\ndynamics of the current displays a faster decay towards the steady-state as\ncompared to the equilibrium case, a signature of quench-induced decoherence.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of a special degeneracy condition, called\ndegenerate band edge (DBE), between two Bloch modes in periodically loaded\ncircular all-metallic waveguides at microwave frequencies. The DBE condition\nhas been associated with a dramatic reduction in group velocity and with some\nunique resonance properties, but it has not been shown in hollow waveguide\nstructures yet. Hence, we show here its existence in two periodic waveguide\nexamples. The unit cell of the first case is composed of a circular waveguide\nloaded with two inner cylinders with elliptical irises with misaligned angles.\nThe second structure is composed of loading the waveguide with elliptical\nrings. The demonstration of DBE in those waveguide is explained through a\nsimple multi transmission line approach where the conditions to obtain DBE are\nclarified, and suggests that the DBE can occur in several other analogous\nperiodic waveguide. These structures can be potentially used to investigate\nunconventional gain schemes in traveling wave tubes or other kinds of\ndistributed amplifiers and novel pulse compressors.\n", "  We revisit the problem of stability of string vacua involving hyperbolic\norbifolds using methods from homotopy theory and K-homology. We propose a\ndefinition of Type II string theory on such backgrounds that further carry\nstratified systems of fiber bundles, which generalise the more conventional\norbifold and symmetric string backgrounds, together with a classification of\nwrapped branes by a suitable generalized homology theory. For spaces stratified\nfibered over hyperbolic orbifolds we use the algebraic K-theory of their\nfundamental groups and Quinn homology to derive criteria for brane stability in\nterms of an Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequence with its lift to\nK-homology. Stable D-branes in this setting carry stratified charges which\ninduce new additive structures on the corresponding K-homology groups. We\nextend these considerations to backgrounds which support H-flux, where we use\nK-groups of twisted group algebras of the fundamental groups to analyse\nstability of locally symmetric spaces with K-amenable isometry groups, and\nderive stability conditions for branes wrapping the fibers of an\nEilenberg-MacLane spectrum functor.\n", "  Sheets of slab waveguides with sharp corners are investigated. By means of\nrigorous numerical experiments, we look at oblique incidence of semi-guided\nplane waves. Radiation losses vanish beyond a certain critical angle of\nincidence. One can thus realize lossless propagation through 90-degree corner\nconfigurations, where the remaining guided waves are still subject to\npronounced reflection and polarization conversion. A system of two corners can\nbe viewed as a structure akin to a Fabry-Perot-interferometer. By adjusting the\ndistance between the two partial reflectors, here the 90-degree corners, one\nidentifies step-like configurations that transmit the semi-guided plane waves\nwithout radiation losses, and virtually without reflections. Simulations of\nsemi-guided beams with in-plane wide Gaussian profiles show that the effect\nsurvives in a true 3-D framework.\n", "  A theorem for the invertibility of arbitrary response functions is presented\nunder the following conditions: the time-dependence of the potentials should be\nLaplace transformable and the initial state should be a ground state, though it\nmight be degenerate. This theorem provides a rigorous foundation for all\ndensity-functional-like theories in the time-dependent linear response regime.\nEspecially for time-dependent one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional\ntheory this is an important step forward, since a solid foundation has\ncurrently been lacking. The theorem is equally valid for static response\nfunctions in the non-degenerate case, so can be used to characterize the\nuniqueness of the potential in the ground state version of the corresponding\ndensity-functional-like theory. Such a classification of the uniqueness of the\nnon-local potential in ground state 1RDM functional theory has been lacking for\ndecades. With the aid of presented invertibility theorem presented here, a\ncomplete classification of the non-uniqueness of the non-local potential in\n1RDM functional theory can be given for the first time.\n", "  We report on temperature dependent scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy studies of undoped SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals from 6 K to\n292 K. Resistivity data show spin density wave (SDW) transition at T$_{SDW}$\n$\\approx$ 205 K and the superconducting transition at $\\sim$ 21 K while\nmagnetic susceptibility does not show any superconductivity. Conductance maps\nand local tunneling spectra show an electronically homogeneous surface at all\nstudied temperatures. Tunnel spectra correlate well with the SDW transition\nwith a depression in the density of states near the Fermi energy below\nT$_{SDW}$. On further lowering the temperature, the width of this partial\nenergy gap associated with the SDW decreases. Using the anti-correlation of\nsuperconducting phase with SDW, we interpret this gap weakening as a precursor\nto superconductivity. This may give rise to a facile nucleation of\nsuperconductivity near defects.\n", "  We present the construction of the convergent series for Quantum\nChromodynamics in the Euclidean space. Applying the bosonization, we rewrite\nQCD as the five-dimensional bosonic vector field theory. Then, generalizing\nearlier results for the scalar field theories, we construct the desired\nconvergent series, free from the infrared and ultraviolet divergences. As in\nthe case of scalar fields the dimensional regularization is assumed to be\nvalid.\n", "  I consider configuration spaces for $N$-body problems, gauge theories and for\nGR in both geometrodynamical and Ashtekar variables forms, including\nminisuperspace and inhomogeneous perturbations thereabout in the former case.\nThese examples include many interesting spaces of shapes (with and without\nwhichever of local or global notions of scale). In considering reduced\nconfiguration spaces, stratified manifolds arise. Three strategies to deal with\nthese are `excise', `unfold' and `accept'. I show that spaces of triangles\narising from various interpretations of 3-body problems already serve as model\narena for all three. I furthermore argue in favour of the `accept' strategy on\nrelational grounds. This approach requires sheaf methods (which go beyond fibre\nbundles and general bundles, which I contrast with sheaves and presheaves in\nsome appendices). Sheaf methods are also required for the stratifold construct\nthat pairs some well-behaved stratified manifolds with sheaves. I apply arguing\nagainst `excise' and `unfold' to GR's superspace and thin sandwich, and to the\nremoval of collinear configurations in mechanics. Non-redundant configurations\nare also useful in providing more accurate names for various spaces and\ntheories.\n", "  We propose a reformulation of the bootstrap version of the Multi-Scale\nAnalysis (BMSA), developed by Germinet and Klein, to make explicit the fact\nthat BMSA implies asymptotically exponential decay of eigenfunctions (EFs) and\nof EF correlators (EFCs), in the lattice Anderson models with diagonal\ndisorder, viz. with an IID random potential. We also show that the exponential\nscaling limit of EFs and EFCs holds true for a class of marginal distributions\nof the random potential with regularity lower than H\\\"older continuity of any\npositive order.\n", "  As part of a long-term project to revisit the kinematics and dynamics of the\nlarge disc galaxies of the Local Group, we present the first deep, wide-field\n(42' x 56') 3D-spectroscopic survey of the ionized gas disc of Messier 33.\nFabry-Perot interferometry has been used to map its Ha distribution and\nkinematics at unprecedented angular resolution (<3'') and resolving power\n(12600), with the 1.6m telescope at the Observatoire du Mont Megantic. The\nionized gas distribution follows a complex, large-scale spiral structure,\nunsurprisingly coincident with the already-known spiral structures of the\nneutral and molecular gas discs. The kinematical analysis of the velocity field\nshows that the rotation center of the Ha disc is distant from the photometric\ncenter by 170 pc (sky projected distance) and that the kinematical major-axis\nposition angle and disc inclination are in excellent agreement with photometric\nvalues. The Ha rotation curve agrees very well with the HI rotation curves for\n0 < R < 6.5 kpc, but the Ha velocities are 10-20 km/s higher for R > 6.5 kpc.\nThe reason for this discrepancy is not well understood. The velocity dispersion\nprofile is relatively flat around 16 km/s, which is at the low end of velocity\ndispersions of nearby star-forming galactic discs. A strong relation is also\nfound between the Ha velocity dispersion and the Ha intensity. Mass models were\nobtained using the Ha rotation curve but, as expected, the dark matter halo's\nparameters are not very well constrained since the optical rotation curve only\nextends out to 8 kpc.\n", "  A mostly right-handed sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)\nis an interesting dark matter candidate, leading to LHC signatures which can be\nquite distinct from those of the conventional neutralino LSP. Using\nSModelSv1.0.1 for testing the model against the limits published by ATLAS and\nCMS in the context of so-called Simplified Model Spectra (SMS), we investigate\nto what extent the supersymmetry searches at Run 1 of the LHC constrain the\nsneutrino-LSP scenario. Moreover, we discuss the most relevant topologies for\nwhich no SMS results are provided by the experimental collaborations but which\nwould allow to put more stringent constraints on sneutrino LSPs. These include,\nfor instance, the mono-lepton signature which should be particularly\ninteresting to consider at Run 2 of the LHC.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of quantum systems which possess stationary states\nas well as slowly decaying, metastable states arising from the perturbation of\nbound states. We give a decomposition of the propagator into a sum of a\nstationary part, one exponentially decaying in time and a polynomially decaying\nremainder. The exponential decay rates and the directions of decay in Hilbert\nspace are determined, respectively, by complex resonance energies and by\nprojections onto resonance states. Our approach is based on an elementary\napplication of the Feshbach map. It is applicable to open quantum systems and\nto situations where spectral deformation theory fails. We derive a detailed\ndescription of the dynamics of the spin-boson model at arbitrary coupling\nstrength.\n", "  We investigate the ground state of a one-dimensional lattice system that\nhosts two different kinds of excitations (species) which interact with a\npower-law potential. Interactions are only present between excitations of the\nsame kind and the interaction strength can be species-dependent. For the case\nin which only one excitation is permitted per site we derive a prescription for\ndetermining the ground state configuration as a function of the filling\nfractions of the two species. We show that depending on the filling fractions\ncompatible or incompatible phases emerge. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the\ncase in which one species is strongly and the other one weakly interacting. In\nthis case the configuration of the strongly interacting (strong) species can be\nconsidered frozen and forms an effective inhomogeneous lattice for the other\n(weak) species. In this limit we work out in detail the microscopic ground\nstate configuration and show that by varying the density of the weak species a\nseries of compatible--incompatible transitions occurs. Finally we determine the\nstability regions of the weak species in the compatible phase and compare it\nwith numerical simulations.\n", "  We explore the phase diagram of the dissipative Rabi-Hubbard model, as could\nbe realized by a Raman-pumping scheme applied to a coupled cavity array. There\nexist various exotic attractors, including ferroelectric, antiferroelectric,\nand inccomensurate fixed points, as well as regions of persistent oscillations.\nMany of these features can be understood analytically by truncating to the two\nlowest lying states of the Rabi model on each site. We also show that these\nfeatures survive beyond mean-field, using Matrix Product Operator simulations.\n", "  For accurate simulations of rarefied gas flows around moving obstacles, we\npropose a cut cell method on Cartesian grids: it allows exact conservation and\naccurate treatment of boundary conditions. Our approach is designed to treat\nCartesian cells and various kind of cut cells by the same algorithm, with no\nneed to identify the specific shape of each cut cell. This makes the\nimplementation quite simple, and allows a direct extension to 3D problems. Such\nsimulations are also made possible by using an adaptive mesh refinement\ntechnique and a hybrid parallel implementation. This is illustrated by several\ntest cases, including a 3D unsteady simulation of the Crookes radiometer.\n", "  The FEC limit paradigm is the prevalent practice for designing optical\ncommunication systems to attain a certain bit-error rate (BER) without forward\nerror correction (FEC). This practice assumes that there is an FEC code that\nwill reduce the BER after decoding to the desired level. In this paper, we\nchallenge this practice and show that the concept of a channel-independent FEC\nlimit is invalid for soft-decision bit-wise decoding. It is shown that for low\ncode rates and high order modulation formats, the use of the soft FEC limit\nparadigm can underestimate the spectral efficiencies by up to 20%. A better\npredictor for the BER after decoding is the generalized mutual information,\nwhich is shown to give consistent post-FEC BER predictions across different\nchannel conditions and modulation formats. Extensive optical full-field\nsimulations and experiments are carried out in both the linear and nonlinear\ntransmission regimes to confirm the theoretical analysis.\n", "  We report on the observation of half-quantum vortices (HQVs) in the\neasy-plane polar phase of an antiferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate.\nUsing in situ magnetization-sensitive imaging, we observe that pairs of HQVs\nwith opposite core magnetization are generated when singly charged quantum\nvortices are injected into the condensate. The dynamics of HQV pair formation\nis characterized by measuring the temporal evolutions of the pair separation\ndistance and the core magnetization, which reveals the short-range nature of\nthe repulsive interactions between the HQVs. We find that spin fluctuations\narising from thermal population of axial magnon excitations do not\nsignificantly affect the HQV pair formation dynamics. Our results demonstrate\nthe instability of a singly charged vortex in the antiferromagnetic spinor\ncondensate.\n", "  Motivated by recent applications of Carroll symmetries we investigate the\ngeometry of flat and curved (AdS) Carroll space and the symmetries of a\nparticle moving in such a space both in the bosonic as well as in the\nsupersymmetric case. In the bosonic case we find that the Carroll particle\npossesses an infinite-dimensional symmetry which only in the flat case includes\ndilatations. The duality between the Bargmann and Carroll algebra, relevant for\nthe flat case, does not extend to the curved case.\n  In the supersymmetric case we study the dynamics of the N=1 AdS Carroll\nsuperparticle. Only in the flat limit we find that the action is invariant\nunder an infinite-dimensional symmetry that includes a supersymmetric extension\nof the Lifshitz Carroll algebra with dynamical exponent z=0. We also discuss in\nthe flat case the extension to N=2 supersymmetry and show that the flat N=2\nsuperparticle is equivalent to the (non-moving) N=1 superparticle and that\ntherefore it is not BPS unlike its Galilei counterpart. This is due to the fact\nthat in this case kappa-symmetry eliminates the linearized supersymmetry.\n  In an appendix we discuss the N=2 curved case in three dimensions only and\nshow that there are two N=2 theories that are physically different.\n", "  Sedimentation of a dispersed solid phase is widely encountered in\napplications and environmental flows, yet little is known about the behavior of\nfinite-size particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. To fill this gap, we\nperform Direct Numerical Simulations of sedimentation in quiescent and\nturbulent environments using an Immersed Boundary Method to account for the\ndispersed rigid spherical particles. The solid volume fractions considered are\n0.5-1%, while the solid to fluid density ratio 1.02. The particle radius is\nchosen to be approximately 6 Komlogorov lengthscales. The results show that the\nmean settling velocity is lower in an already turbulent flow than in a\nquiescent fluid. The reduction with respect to a single particle in quiescent\nfluid is about 12\\% and 14\\% for the two volume fractions investigated. The\nprobability density function of the particle velocity is almost Gaussian in a\nturbulent flow, whereas it displays large positive tails in quiescent fluid.\nThese tails are associated to the intermittent fast sedimentation of particle\npairs in drafting-kissing-tumbling motions. The particle lateral dispersion is\nhigher in a turbulent flow, whereas the vertical one is, surprisingly, of\ncomparable magnitude as a consequence of the highly intermittent behavior\nobserved in the quiescent fluid. Using the concept of mean relative velocity we\nestimate the mean drag coefficient from empirical formulas and show that non\nstationary effects, related to vortex shedding, explain the increased reduction\nin mean settling velocity in a turbulent environment.\n", "  We study the transport equation describing a dense system of gluons, in the\nsmall scattering angle approximation, taking into account medium-generated\neffective masses of the gluons. We focus on the case of overpopulated systems\nthat are driven to Bose-Einstein condensation on their way to thermalization.\nThe presence of a mass modifies the dispersion relation of the gluon, as\ncompared to the massless case, but it is shown that this does not change\nqualitatively the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the onset.\n", "  We derive the set of kinetic equations that control the evolution of gluons\nin the presence of a condensate. We show that the dominant singularities remain\nlogarithmic when the scattering involves particles in the condensate. This\nallows us to define a consistent small angle approximation.\n", "  The robust conjugate direction search (RCDS) method has high tolerance to\nnoise in beam experiments. It has been demonstrated that this method can be\nused to optimize the machine performance of a light source online. In our\nstudy, taking BEPCII as an example, the feasibility of online tuning of the\nluminosity in a circular collider is explored, through numerical simulation and\npreliminary online experiments. It is shown that the luminosity that is\nartificially decreased by a deviation of beam orbital offset from optimal\ntrajectory can be recovered with this method.\n", "  Starting with 'High Scale Mixing Unification' hypothesis, we investigate the\nrenormalization group evolution of mixing parameters and masses for both Dirac\nand Majorana type neutrinos. Following this hypothesis, the PMNS mixing\nparameters are taken to be identical to the CKM ones at a unifying high scale.\nThen, they are evolved to a low scale using MSSM renormalization-group\nequations. For both type of neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution\n'naturally' results in a non-zero and small value of leptonic mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. One of the important predictions of this analysis is that, in\nboth cases, the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ turns out to be non-maximal for most\nof the parameter range. We also elaborate on the important differences between\nDirac and Majorana neutrinos within our framework and how to experimentally\ndistinguish between the two scenarios. Furthermore, for both cases, we also\nderive constraints on the allowed parameter range for the SUSY breaking and\nunification scales, for which this hypothesis works. The results can be tested\nby present and future experiments.\n", "  The possibility to enhance chiral light-matter interactions through plasmonic\nnanostructures provides entirely new opportunities for greatly improving the\ndetection limits of chiroptical spectroscopies down to the single molecule\nlevel. The most pronounced of these chiral interactions occur in the\nultraviolet (UV) range of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is difficult to\naccess with conventional localized plasmon resonance based sensors. Although\nSurface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on noble metal films can sustain resonances\nin the desired spectral range, their transverse magnetic nature has been an\nobstacle for enhancing chiroptical effects. Here we demonstrate, both\nanalytically and numerically, that SPPs excited by near-field sources can\nexhibit rich and non-trivial chiral characteristics. In particular, we show\nthat the excitation of SPPs by a chiral source not only results in a locally\nenhanced optical chirality but also achieves manifold enhancement of net\noptical chirality. Our finding that SPPs facilitate a plasmonic enhancement of\noptical chirality in the UV part of the spectrum is of great interest in chiral\nbio-sensing.\n", "  The insulator-metal transition in hydrogen is one of the most outstanding\nproblems in condensed matter physics. The high-pressure metallic phase is now\npredicted to be liquid atomic from T=0 K to very high temperatures. We have\nconducted measurements of optical properties of hot dense hydrogen in the\nregion of 1.1-1.7 Mbar and up to 2200 K. We observe a first-order phase\ntransition accompanied by changes in transmittance and reflectance\ncharacteristic of a metal. The phase line of this transition has a negative\nslope in agreement with theories of the so-called plasma phase transition.\n", "  We investigate the optical properties of hydrogen as it undergoes a\ntransition from the insulating molecular to the metallic atomic phase, when\nheated by a pulsed laser at megabar pressures in a diamond anvil cell. Most\ncurrent experiments attempt to observe this transition by detecting a change in\nthe optical reflectance and/or transmittance. Theoretical models for this\nchange are based on the dielectric function calculated for bulk, homogeneous\nslabs of material. Experimentally, one expects a hydrogen plasma density that\nvaries on a length scale not substantially smaller than the wave length of the\nprobing light. We show that taking this inhomogeneity into account can lead to\nsignificant corrections in the reflectance and transmittance. We present a\ntechnique to calculate the optical properties of systems with a smoothly\nvarying density of charge carriers, determine the optical response for metallic\nhydrogen in the diamond anvil cell experiment and contrast this with the\nstandard results. Analyzing recent experimental results we obtain\n$\\sigma^{Drude}_{DC}=(2.1 \\pm 1.3) \\times 10^3$ ($\\Omega$ cm)$^{-1}$ for the\nconductivity of metallic hydrogen at 170 GPa and 1250 K.\n", "  We present a new particle-merging algorithm for the particle-in-cell method.\nBased on the concept of the Voronoi diagram, the algorithm partitions the phase\nspace into smaller subsets, which consist of only particles that are in close\nproximity in the phase space to each other. We show the performance of our\nalgorithm in the case of the two-stream instability and the magnetic shower.\n", "  Analytic expressions for the electromagnetic fields of an ultrashort, tightly\nfocused, linearly polarized laser pulse in vacuum are derived from scalar and\nvector potentials, using a small parameter which assumes a small bandwidth of\nthe laser pulse. The derived fields are compared with those of the Lax series\nexpansion and the complex-source-point approaches and are shown to be\nwell-behaved and accurate even in the subcycle pulse regime. We further\ndemonstrate that terms stemming from the scalar potential and due to a fast\nvarying pulse envelope are non-negligible and may significantly influence\nlaser-matter interactions.\n", "  We study the neutrino sector in a minimal $SU(3)_L\\times U(1)_X$ model, in\nwhich its mass is generated at one-loop level with the charged lepton mass, and\nhence there exists a strong correlation between the charged-lepton mass and the\nneutrino mass. We identify the parameter region of this model to satisfy the\ncurrent neutrino oscillation data as well as the constraints on lepton flavor\nviolating processes. We also discuss a possibility to explain the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment.\n", "  We study in this paper the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model in a thin film of\nstacked triangular lattices.The model is described by three parameters:\nbilinear exchange interaction between spins $J$, quadratic exchange interaction\n$K$ and single-ion anisotropy $D$. The spin $S\\_i$ at the lattice site $i$\ntakes three values $(-1,0,+1)$.This model can describe the mixing phase of He-4\n($S\\_i =+1,-1$) and He-3 ($S\\_i =0$) at low temperatures.Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we show that there exists a critical value of $D$ below (above)\nwhich the transition is of second-(first-)order.In general, the temperature\ndependence of the concentrations of He-3 is different from layer by layer. At a\nfinite temperature in the superfluid phase, the film surface shows a deficit of\nHe-4 with respect to interior layers. However, effects of surface interaction\nparameters can reverse this situation. Effects of the film thickness on\nphysical properties will be also shown as functions of temperature.\n", "  The nuclear symmetry energy determines the birth of neutron stars and the\nelementary nucleosynthesis in the universe. To constrain the nuclear symmetry\nenergy, besides the studies in astrophysics, many terrestrial nuclear\nexperiments are being carried out using a wide variety of advanced new\nfacilities. In this paper, by cross-checking two unrelated experimental\nmeasurements using the newly updated transport model, we obtained a slightly\nsoft symmetry energy at supra-saturation nuclear densities. While extrapolating\nto low nuclear densities, this result is compatible with the recent finding by\ncomparing the available data on the electric dipole polarizability with the\ntheoretical predictions. Our finding is expected to push the studies of nuclear\nphysics and astrophysics forward.\n", "  Using high-throughput Tethered Particle Motion single molecule experiments,\nthe double-stranded DNA persistence length, $L_p$, is measured in solutions\nwith Na$^+$ and Mg$^{2+}$ ions of various ionic strengths, $I$. Several\ntheoretical equations for $L_p(I)$ are fitted to the experimental data, but no\ndecisive theory is found which fits all the $L_p$ values for the two ion\nvalencies. Properly extracted from the particle trajectory using simulations,\n$L_p$ varies from 30~nm to 55~nm, and is compared to previous experimental\nresults. For the Na$^+$ only case, $L_p$ is an increasing concave function of\n$I^{-1}$, well fitted by Manning's electrostatic stretching approach, but not\nby classical Odjik-Skolnick-Fixman theories with or without counter-ion\ncondensation. With added Mg$^{2+}$ ions, $L_p$ shows a marked decrease at low\n$I$, interpreted as an ion-ion correlation effect, with an almost linear law in\n$I^{-1}$, fitted by a proposed variational approach.\n", "  The Forward-Backward Asymmetry (AFB) in $Z^\\prime$ physics is commonly only\nperceived as the observable which possibly allows one to interpret a $Z^\\prime$\nsignal by distinguishing different models of such (heavy) spin-1 bosons. In\nthis article, we examine the potential of AFB in setting bounds on or even\ndiscovering a $Z^\\prime$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and show that it\nmight be a powerful tool for this purpose. We analyze two different scenarios:\n$Z^\\prime$s with a narrow and wide width, respectively. We find that in both\ncases AFB can complement the cross section in accessing $Z^\\prime$ signals.\n", "  We study the representation of solutions of the three-dimensional\nquasigeostrophic (QG) equations using Galerkin series with standard vertical\nmodes, with particular attention to the incorporation of active surface\nbuoyancy dynamics. We extend two existing Galerkin approaches (A and B) and\ndevelop a new Galerkin approximation (C). Approximation A, due to\n\\cite{flierl1978}, represents the streamfunction as a truncated Galerkin series\nand defines the potential vorticity (PV) that satisfies the inversion problem\nexactly. Approximation B, due to \\cite{tulloch_smith2009b}, represents the PV\nas a truncated Galerkin series and calculates the streamfunction that satisfies\nthe inversion problem exactly. Approximation C, the true Galerkin approximation\nfor the QG equations, represents both streamfunction and PV as truncated\nGalerkin series, but does not satisfy the inversion equation exactly. The three\napproximations are fundamentally different unless the boundaries are isopycnal\nsurfaces. We discuss the advantages and limitations of approximations A, B, and\nC in terms of mathematical rigor and conservation laws, and illustrate their\nrelative efficiency by solving linear stability problems with nonzero surface\nbuoyancy. With moderate number of modes, B and C have have superior accuracy\nthan A at high wavenumbers. Because B lacks conservation of energy, we\nrecommend approximation C for constructing solutions to the surface-active QG\nequations using Galerkin series with standard vertical modes.\n", "  Superconducting circuits and trapped ions are promising architectures for\nquantum information processing. However, the natural frequencies for\ncontrolling these systems -- radio frequency ion control and microwave domain\nsuperconducting qubit control -- make direct Hamiltonian interactions between\nthem weak. In this paper we describe a technique for coupling a trapped ion's\nmotion to the fundamental mode of a superconducting circuit, by applying to the\ncircuit a carefully modulated external magnetic flux. In conjunction with a\nnon-linear element (Josephson junction), this gives the circuit an effective\ntime-dependent inductance. We then show how to tune the external flux to\ngenerate a resonant coupling between the circuit and ion's motional mode, and\ndiscuss the limitations of this approach compared to using a time-dependent\ncapacitance.\n", "  We present a minimalistic equilateral triangular lattice model, from which we\nderive electron and exciton band structures for semiconducting transition-metal\ndichalcogenides. With explicit consideration of the exchange interaction, this\nmodel is appropriate across the spectrum from Wannier to Frenkel excitons. The\nsingle-particle contributions are obtained from a nearest-neighbor\ntight-binding model parameterized using the effective mass and spin-orbit\ncoupling. The solutions to the characteristic equation, computed in direct\nspace, are in qualitative agreement with first-principles calculations and\nhighlight the inadequacy of the two-dimensional hydrogen model to describe the\nlowest-energy exciton bands. The model confirms the lack of subshell degeneracy\nand shows that the A-B exciton split depends on the electrostatic environment\nas well as the spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  The discovery of a light Higgs boson at the LHC opens a broad program of\nstudies and measurements to understand the role of this particle in connection\nwith New Physics and Cosmology. Supersymmetry is the best motivated and most\nthoroughly formulated and investigated model of New Physics which predicts a\nlight Higgs boson and can explain dark matter. This paper discusses how the\nstudy of the Higgs boson connects with the search for supersymmetry and for\ndark matter at the LHC and at a future $e^+e^-$ collider and with dedicated\nunderground dark matter experiments.\n", "  The problem of embedding the Tsallis and R\\'{e}nyi entropies in the framework\nof category theory and their axiomatic foundation is studied. To this end, we\nconstruct a special category MES related to measured spaces. We prove that both\nof the R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies can be imbedded in the formalism of\ncategory theory by proving that the same basic functional that appears in their\ndefinitions, as well as in the associated Lebesgue space norms, has good\nalgebraic compatibility properties. We prove that this functional is both\nadditive and multiplicative with respect to the direct product and the disjoint\nsum (the coproduct) in the category MES, so it is a natural candidate for the\nmeasure of information or uncertainty. We prove that the category MES can be\nextended to monoidal category, both with respect to the direct product as well\nas to the coproduct. The basic axioms of the original R\\'{e}nyi entropy theory\nare generalized and reformulated in the framework of category MES and we prove\nthat these axioms foresee the existence of an universal exponent having the\nsame values for all the objects of the category MES. In addition, this\nuniversal exponent is the parameter, which appears in the definition of the\nTsallis and R\\'{e}nyi entropies.\n", "  We study the quantum Hall effect in a monolayer graphene by using an approach\nbased on thermodynamical properties. This can be done by considering a system\nof Dirac particles in an electromagnetic field and taking into account of the\nedges effect as a pseudo-potential varying continuously along the $x$\ndirection. At low temperature and in the weak electric field limit, we\nexplicitly determine the thermodynamical potential. With this, we derive the\nparticle numbers in terms of the quantized flux and therefore the Hall\nconductivity immediately follows.\n", "  Three-dimensional simulations with fully resolved hydrodynamics are performed\nto study the collective motion of model swimmers in confinement. We show that\ncertain swimming mechanisms can lead to traveling wave-like collective motion\neven without any direct alignment mechanism. It is also shown that by varying\nthe swimming mechanism, this collective motion can be suppressed, contrary to\nthe perception that hydrodynamic effects are completely screened at high volume\nfraction. From an analysis of bulk systems, it is shown that this traveling\nwave-like motion, which can be characterized as a pseudo-acoustic mode, is\nmainly due to the intrinsic swimming property of the particles.\n", "  In certain extensions of General Relativity, wormholes generated by\nspherically symmetric electric fields can resolve black hole singularities\nwithout necessarily removing curvature divergences. This is shown by studying\ngeodesic completeness, the behavior of time-like congruences going through the\ndivergent region, and by means of scattering of waves off the wormhole. This\nprovides an example of the logical independence between curvature divergences\nand space-time singularities, concepts very often identified with each other in\nthe literature.ns of curvature divergences in the context of space-time\nsingularities.\n", "  Intensity mapping experiments survey the spectrum of diffuse line radiation\nrather than detect individual objects at high signal-to-noise. Spectral maps of\nunresolved atomic and molecular line radiation contain three-dimensional\ninformation about the density and environments of emitting gas, and efficiently\nprobe cosmological volumes out to high redshift. Intensity mapping survey\nvolumes also contain all other sources of radiation at the frequencies of\ninterest. Continuum foregrounds are typically ~10^2-10^3 times brighter than\nthe cosmological signal. The instrumental response to bright foregrounds will\nproduce new spectral degrees of freedom that are not known in advance, nor\nnecessarily spectrally smooth. The intrinsic spectra of foregrounds may also\nnot be well-known in advance. We describe a general class of quadratic\nestimators to analyze data from single-dish intensity mapping experiments, and\ndetermine contaminated spectral modes from the data itself. The key attribute\nof foregrounds is not that they are spectrally smooth, but instead that they\nhave fewer bright spectral degrees of freedom than the cosmological signal.\nSpurious correlations between the signal and foregrounds produce additional\nbias. Compensation for signal attenuation must estimate and correct this bias.\nA successful intensity mapping experiment will control instrumental systematics\nthat spread variance into new modes, and it must observe a large enough volume\nthat contaminant modes can be determined independently from the signal on\nscales of interest.\n", "  We consider possible signatures for the so called {\\it hybrid gravity} within\nthe Galactic Central Parsec. This modified theory of gravity consists of a\nsuperposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an $f(R)$ term\nconstructed {\\it \\`{a} la Palatini} and can be easily reduced to an equivalent\nscalar-tensor theory. Such an approach is introduced in order to cure the\nshortcomings related to $f(R)$ gravity, in general formulated either in metric\nor in metric-affine frameworks. Hybrid gravity allows to disentangle the\nfurther gravitational degrees of freedom with respect to those of standard\nGeneral Relativity. The present analysis is based on the S2 star orbital\nprecession around the massive compact dark object at the Galactic Centre where\nthe simulated orbits in hybrid modified gravity are compared with astronomical\nobservations. These simulations result with constraints on the range of hybrid\ngravity interaction parameter $\\phi_0$, showing that in the case of S2 star it\nis between -0.0009 and -0.0002. At the same time, we are also able to obtain\nthe constraints on the effective mass parameter $m_{\\phi}$, and found that it\nis between -0.0034 and -0.0025 AU$^{-1}$ for S2 star. Furthermore, the hybrid\ngravity potential induces precession of S2 star orbit in the same direction as\nGeneral Relativity. In previous papers, we considered other types of extended\ngravities, like metric power law $f(R)\\propto R^n$ gravity, inducing Yukawa and\nSanders-like gravitational potentials, but it seems that hybrid gravity is the\nbest among these models to explain different gravitational phenomena at\ndifferent astronomical scales.\n", "  Being capable of characterizing DNA local bending is essential to understand\nthoroughly many biological processes because they involve a local bending of\nthe double helix axis, either intrinsic to the sequence or induced by the\nbinding of proteins. Developing a method to measure DNA bend angles that does\nnot perturb the conformation of the DNA itself or the DNA-protein complex is a\nchallenging task. Here, we propose a joint theory-experiment high throughput\napproach to rigorously measure such bend angles using the Tethered Particle\nMotion (TPM) technique. By carefully modeling the TPM geometry, we propose a\nsimple formula based on a kinked Worm-Like Chain model to extract the bend\nangle from TPM measurements. Using constructs made of 575 base-pair DNAs with\nin-phase assemblies of 1 to 7 6A-tracts, we find that the sequence CA6CGG\ninduces a bend angle of 19 [4] {\\deg}. Our method is successfully compared to\nmore theoretically complex or experimentally invasive ones such as cyclization,\nNMR, FRET or AFM. We further apply our procedure to TPM measurements from the\nliterature and demonstrate that the angles of bends induced by proteins, such\nas Integration Host Factor (IHF) can be reliably evaluated as well.\n", "  Urban systems present hierarchical structures at many different scales. These\nare observed as administrative regional delimitations which are the outcome of\ncomplex geographical, political and historical processes which leave almost\nindelible footprints on infrastructure such as the street network. In this work\nwe uncover a set of hierarchies in Britain at different scales using\npercolation theory on the street network and on its intersections which are the\nprimary points of interaction and urban agglomeration. At the larger scales,\nthe observed hierarchical structures can be interpreted as regional fractures\nof Britain, observed in various forms, from natural boundaries, such as\nNational Parks, to regional divisions based on social class and wealth such as\nthe well-known North-South divide. At smaller scales, cities are generated\nthrough recursive percolations on each of the emerging regional clusters. We\nexamine the evolution of the morphology of the system as a whole, by measuring\nthe fractal dimension of the clusters at each distance threshold in the\npercolation. We observe that this reaches a maximum plateau at a specific\ndistance. The clusters defined at this distance threshold are in excellent\ncorrespondence with the boundaries of cities recovered from satellite images,\nand from previous methods using population density.\n", "  Motivated by earlier studies of artificial perceptions of light called\nphosphenes, we analyze traveling wave solutions in a chain of periodically\nforced coupled nonlinear oscillators modeling this phenomenon. We examine the\ndiscrete model problem in its co-traveling frame and systematically obtain the\ncorresponding traveling waves in one spatial dimension. Direct numerical\nsimulations as well as linear stability analysis are employed to reveal the\nparameter regions where the traveling waves are stable, and these waves are, in\nturn, connected to the standing waves analyzed in earlier work. We also\nconsider a two-dimensional extension of the model and demonstrate the robust\nevolution and stability of planar fronts and annihilation of radial ones.\nFinally, we show that solutions that initially feature two symmetric fronts\nwith bulged centers evolve in qualitative agreement with experimental\nobservations of phosphenes.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum computing and optimization have garnered much attention\nrecently as possible models for achieving a quantum advantage over classical\napproaches to optimization and other special purpose computations. Both\ntechniques are probabilistic in nature and the minimum gap between the ground\nstate and first excited state of the system during evolution is a major factor\nin determining the success probability. In this work we investigate a strategy\nfor increasing the minimum gap and success probability by introducing\nintermediate Hamiltonians that modify the evolution path between initial and\nfinal Hamiltonians. We focus on an optimization problem relevant to recent\nhardware implementations and present numerical evidence for the existence of a\npurely local intermediate Hamiltonian that achieve the optimum performance in\nterms of pushing the minimum gap to one of the end points of the evolution. As\na part of this study we develop a convex optimization formulation of the search\nfor optimal adiabatic schedules that makes this computation more tractable, and\nwhich may be of independent interest. We further study the effectiveness of\nrandom intermediate Hamiltonians on the minimum gap and success probability,\nand empirically find that random Hamiltonians have a significant probability of\nincreasing the success probability, but only by a modest amount.\n", "  A coupled Camassa-Holm type equation is linked to the first negative flow of\na modified Drinfeld-Sokolov III hierarchy by a transformation of reciprocal\ntype. Meanwhile the Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian structure behaviors of this\ncoupled Camassa-Holm type equation under change of variables are analyzed.\n", "  We derive the extended fluctuation theorems in presence of multiple\nmeasurements and feedback, when the system is governed by Hamiltonian dynamics.\nWe use only the forward phase space trajectories in the derivation. However, to\nobtain an expression for the efficacy parameter, we must necessarily use the\nnotion of reverse trajectory. Our results show that the correction term\nappearing in the exponent of the extended fluctuation theorems are non-unique,\nwhereas the physical meaning of the efficacy parameter is unique.\n", "  The ground state of a many body Hamiltonian considered in the quasiparticle\nrepresentation is redefined by accounting for the quasiparticle quadrupole\npairing interaction. The residual interaction of the newly defined\nquasiparticles is treated by the QRPA. Solutions of the resulting equations\nexhibit specific features. In particular, there is no interaction strength\nwhere the first root is vanishing. A comparison with other renormalization\nmethods is presented.\n", "  LHCb found hints for physics beyond the standard model in $B\\to\nK^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $B\\to K^*\\mu^+\\mu^-/B\\to K^*e^+e^-$ and $B_s\\to\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-$.\nIn addition, the BABAR results for $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and the CMS excess in\n$h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$ also point towards lepton flavour (universality)\nviolating new physics. While $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and $h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$\ncan be naturally explained by an extended Higgs sector, the probably most\npromising explanation for the $b\\to s\\mu\\mu$ anomalies is a $Z'$ boson.\nFurthermore, combining a 2HDM with a gauged $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ symmetry allows for\nexplaining the $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomalies and $h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$\nsimultaneously, with interesting correlations to $\\tau\\to3\\mu$. In the light of\nthese deviations from the SM we also discuss the possibilities of observing\nlepton flavour violating $B$ decays (e.g. $B\\to K^{(*)}\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$ and\n$B_s\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$) in $Z^\\prime$ models.\n", "  The Differential Fourier Holography (DFH) gives an exact mathematical\nsolution of the inverse problem of diffraction in the Fraunhofer regime. After\nthe first publication [1] the Differential Fourier Holography was successfully\napplied in many experiments to obtain amplitude and phase information about\ntwo-dimensional (2D) images. In this article we demonstrate numerically the\npossibility to apply the DFH also for investigation of unknown 3D Objects. The\nfirst simulation is made for a double-spiral structure plus a line as a\nreference object.\n", "  In this paper, we present an efficient spectral-element method (SEM) for\nsolving general two-dimensional Helmholtz equations in anisotropic media, with\nparticular applications in accurate simulation of polygonal invisibility\ncloaks, concentrators and circular rotators arisen from the field of\ntransformation electromagnetics (TE). In practice, we adopt a transparent\nboundary condition (TBC) characterized by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map to\nreduce wave propagation in an unbounded domain to a bounded domain. We then\nintroduce a semi-analytic technique to integrate the global TBC with local\ncurvilinear elements seamlessly, which is accomplished by using a novel\nelemental mapping and analytic formulas for evaluating global Fourier\ncoefficients on spectral-element grids exactly.\n  From the perspective of TE, an invisibility cloak is devised by a singular\ncoordinate transformation of Maxwell's equations that leads to anisotropic\nmaterials coating the cloaked region to render any object inside invisible to\nobservers outside. An important issue resides in the imposition of appropriate\nconditions at the outer boundary of the cloaked region, i.e., cloaking boundary\nconditions (CBCs), in order to achieve perfect invisibility. Following the\nspirit of [48], we propose new CBCs for polygonal invisibility cloaks from the\nessential \"pole\" conditions related to singular transformations. This allows\nfor the decoupling of the governing equations of inside and outside the cloaked\nregions. With this efficient spectral-element solver at our disposal, we can\nstudy the interesting phenomena when some defects and lossy or dispersive media\nare placed in the cloaking layer of an ideal polygonal cloak.\n", "  Superconducting order parameter and its symmetry are important parameters\ntowards deciphering the pairing mechanism in newly discovered superconducting\nsystems. We report a study on penetration depth measurement on Nb2PdS5 that has\nrecently been reported with extremely high upper critical field with possible\ntriplet pairing mechanism. Our data show that at low temperatures the change in\npenetration depth is best fitted with BCS s-wave model for single gap. The\nzero-temperature value of the superconducting energy gap is estimated to be\n{\\Delta}0 = 1.05 meV. The superfluid density in the entire temperature range is\nwell described by single gap for {\\lambda} (0) = 220 nm.\n", "  Tagged jet measurements in high energy hadronic and nuclear reactions provide\nconstraints on the energy and parton flavor origin of the parton shower that\nrecoils against the tagging particle. Such additional insight can be especially\nbeneficial in illuminating the mechanisms of heavy flavor production in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC and their modification in the heavy ion\nenvironment, which are not fully understood. With this motivation, we present\ntheoretical results for isolated-photon-tagged and B-meson-tagged b-jet\nproduction at center-of-mass energy 5.1 TeV for comparison to the upcoming\nlead-lead data. We find that photon-tagged b-jets exhibit smaller momentum\nimbalance shift in nuclear matter, and correspondingly smaller energy loss,\nthan photon-tagged light flavor jets. Our results show that B-meson tagging is\nmost effective in ensuring that the dominant fraction of recoiling jets\noriginate from prompt b-quarks. Interestingly, in this channel the large\nsuppression of the cross section is not accompanied by a significant momentum\nimbalance shift.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear wave dynamics of origami-based metamaterials\ncomposed of Tachi-Miura polyhedron (TMP) unit cells. These cells exhibit strain\nsoftening behavior under compression, which can be tuned by modifying their\ngeometrical configurations or initial folded conditions. We assemble these TMP\ncells into a cluster of origami-based metamaterials, and we theoretically model\nand numerically analyze their wave transmission mechanism under external\nimpact. Numerical simulations show that origami-based metamaterials can provide\na prototypical platform for the formation of nonlinear coherent structures in\nthe form of rarefaction waves, which feature a tensile wavefront upon the\napplication of compression to the system. We also demonstrate the existence of\nnumerically exact traveling rarefaction waves. Origami-based metamaterials can\nbe highly useful for mitigating shock waves, potentially enabling a wide\nvariety of engineering applications.\n", "  By performing local projective measurements on a two-qubit entangled state\none can certify in a device-independent way up to one bit of randomness. We\nshow here that general measurements, defined by positive-operator-valued\nmeasures, can certify up to two bits of randomness, which is the optimal amount\nof randomness that can be certified from an entangled bit. General measurements\nthus provide an advantage over projective ones for device-independent\nrandomness certification.\n", "  Graphene quantum dots are considered as promising alternatives to quantum\ndots in III-V semiconductors, e.g., for the use as spin qubits due to their\nconsistency made of light atoms including spin-free nuclei which both imply\nrelatively long spin decoherene times. However, this potential has not been\nrealized in experiments so far, most likely, due to a missing control of the\nedge configurations of the quantum dots. Thus, a more fundamental investigation\nof Graphene quantum dots appears to be necessary including a full control of\nthe wave function properties most favorably during transport spectroscopy\nmeasurements. Here, we review the recent success in mapping wave functions of\ngraphene quantum dots supported by metals, in particular Ir(111), and show how\nthe goal of probing such wave functions on insulating supports during transport\nspectroscopy might be achieved.\n", "  Co$_3$O$_4$, ZnFe$_2$O$_4$, CoFe$_2$O$_4$, ZnCo$_2$O$_4$, and Fe$_3$O$_4$\nthin films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition at high and low\ntemperatures resulting in crystalline single-phase normal, inverse, as well as\ndisordered spinel oxide thin films with smooth surface morphology. The\ndielectric function, determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry in a wide\nspectral range from 0.5 eV to 8.5 eV, is compared with the magneto-optical\nresponse of the dielectric tensor, investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect\n(MOKE) spectroscopy in the spectral range from 1.7 eV to 5.5 eV with an applied\nmagnetic field of 1.7 T. Crystal field, inter-valence and inter-sublattice\ncharge transfer transitions, and transitions from O$_{2p}$ to metal cation 3d\nor 4s bands are identified in both the principal diagonal elements and the\nmagneto-optically active off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor.\nDepending on the degree of cation disorder, resulting in local symmetry\ndistortion, the magneto-optical response is found to be strongest for high\ncrystal quality inverse spinels and for disordered normal spinel structure,\ncontrary to the first principle studies of CoFe$_2$O$_4$ and ZnFe$_2$O$_4$. The\nresults presented provide a basis for deeper understanding of light-matter\ninteraction in this material system that is of vital importance for\ndevice-related phenomena and engineering.\n", "  The problem of measurement is often considered as an inconsistency inside the\nquantum formalism. Many attempts to solve (or to dissolve) it have been made\nsince the inception of quantum mechanics. The form of these attempts depends on\nthe philosophical position that their authors endorse. I will review some of\nthem and analyze their relevance. The phenomenon of decoherence is often\npresented as a solution lying inside the pure quantum formalism and not\ndemanding any particular philosophical assumption. Nevertheless, a widely\ndebated question is to decide between two different interpretations. The first\none is to consider that the decoherence process has the effect to actually\nproject a superposed state into one of its classically interpretable component,\nhence doing the same job as the reduction postulate. For the second one,\ndecoherence is only a way to show why no macroscopic superposed state can be\nobserved, so explaining the classical appearance of the macroscopic world,\nwhile the quantum entanglement between the system, the apparatus and the\nenvironment never disappears. In this case, explaining why only one single\ndefinite outcome is observed remains to do. In this paper, I examine the\narguments that have been given for and against both interpretations and defend\na new position, the \"Convivial Solipsism\" , according to which the outcome that\nis observed is relative to the observer, different but in close parallel to the\nEverett's interpretation and sharing also some similarities with Rovelli's\nrelational interpretation and quantum bayesianism. I also show how \"Convivial\nSolipsism\" can help getting a new standpoint about the EPR paradox providing a\nway out of the standard dilemma that is having to choose between abandoning\neither realism or locality.\n", "  We suggest that Hamiltonian matrix elements between physical states in QCD\nmight be approximated, in Coulomb gauge, by \"lattice-improved\" tree diagrams;\ni.e. tree diagram contributions with dressed ghost, transverse gluon, and\nCoulomb propagators obtained from lattice simulations. Such matrix elements can\nbe applied to a truncated-basis treatment of hadronic states which include\nconstituent gluons. As an illustration, we apply this hybrid approach to the\nheavy quark potential, for quark-antiquark separations up to 2.4 fm. The\nCoulomb string tension in SU(3) gauge theory is about a factor of four times\ngreater than the asymptotic string tension. In our approach we show that a\nsingle constituent gluon is in principle sufficient, up to 2.4 fm, to reduce\nthis overshoot by the factor required. The static potential remains linear,\nalthough the precise value of the string tension depends on details of the\nCouloumb gauge ghost and gluon propagators in the infrared regime. In this\nconnection we present new lattice results for the transverse gluon propagator\nin position space.\n", "  In this work we carried out systematic experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations of the ferromagnetic (FMR) response of quasi-two-dimensional\nmagnetic nano-objects - microscopically long nanostripes made of ferromagentic\nmetals. We were interested in the impact of the symmetries of this geometry on\nthe FMR response. Three possible scenarios, from which the inversion symmetry\nbreak originated, were investigated:(1) from the shape of the stripe\ncross-section, (2) from the double-layer structure of the stripes with exchange\ncoupling between the layers, and (3) from the single-side incidence of the\nmicrowave magnetic field on the plane of the nano-pattern. The latter scenario\nis characteristic of the stripline FMR configuration. It was found that the\ncombined effect of the three symmetry breaks is much stronger than the impacts\nof each of these symmetry breaks separately.\n", "  We suggest a mechanism for the emergence of a superradiance burst in a\nsubwavelength array of nonlinear classical emitters. We assume that the\nemitters interact via their common field of radiative response and that they\nmay have an arbitrary distribution of initially phases. We show that only if\nthis distribution is not uniform, a non-zero field of radiative response arises\nleading to a superradiance burst. Although this field cannot synchronize the\nemitters, it forces fast oscillations of a classical nonlinear emitter to have\nlong-period envelopes. Constructive interference in the envelopes creates a\nlarge dipole moment of the array which results in a superradiance pulse. The\nintensity of the superradiance is proportional to the squared number of the\nemitters, which envelopes participate in the fluctuation.\n", "  Utilizing a full microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach, we study\nthe equilibrium charge and spin currents in ballistic $SFSFS$ Josephson\nsystems, where $F$ is a uniformly magnetized ferromagnet and $S$ is a\nconventional $s$-wave superconductor. From the spatially varying spin currents,\nwe also calculate the associated equilibrium spin transfer torques. Through\nvariations in the relative phase differences between the three $S$ regions, and\nmagnetization orientations of the ferromagnets, our study demonstrates\ntunability and controllability of the spin and charge supercurrents. The spin\ntransfer torques are shown to reveal details of the proximity effects that play\na crucial role in these types of hybrid systems. The proposed $SFSFS$\nnanostructure is discussed within the context of a superconducting magnetic\ntorque transistor.\n", "  We perform a time-resolved spectral analysis of GRB 130606B within the\nframework of a fast-cooling synchrotron radiation model with magnetic field\nstrength in the emission region decaying with time, as proposed by Uhm & Zhang.\nThe data from all time intervals can be successfully fit by the model. The same\ndata can be equally well fit by the empirical Band function with typical\nparameter values. Our results, which involve only minimal physical assumptions,\noffer one natural solution to the origin of the observed GRB spectra and imply\nthat, at least some, if not all, Band-like GRB spectra with typical Band\nparameter values can indeed be explained by synchrotron radiation.\n", "  We numerically study turbulent Taylor-Couette flow (TCF) between two\nindependently rotating cylinders and the transition to rotating plane Couette\nflow (RPCF) in the limit of infinite radii. By using the shear Reynolds number\n$Re_S$ and rotation number $R_\\Omega$ as dimensionless parameters, the\ntransition from TCF to RPCF can be studied continuously without singularities.\nAlready for radius ratios $\\eta\\geq0.9$ we find that the simulation results for\nvarious radius ratios and for RPCF collapse as a function of $R_\\Omega$,\nindicating a turbulent behaviour common to both systems. We observe this\nagreement in the torque, mean momentum transport, mean profiles, and turbulent\nfluctuations. Moreover, the central profiles in TCF and RPCF for $R_\\Omega>0$\nare found to conform with inviscid neutral stability. Intermittent bursts that\nhave been observed in the outer boundary layer and have been linked to the\nformation of a torque maximum for counter-rotation are shown to disappear as\n$\\eta \\rightarrow 1$. The corresponding torque maximum disappears as well.\nInstead, two new maxima of different origin appear for $\\eta\\geq0.9$ and RPCF,\na broad and a narrow one, in contrast to the results for smaller $\\eta$. The\nbroad maximum at $R_\\Omega=0.2$ is connected with a strong vortical flow and\ncan be reproduced by streamwise invariant simulations. The narrow maximum at\n$R_\\Omega=0.02$ only emerges with increasing $Re_S$ and is accompanied by an\nefficient and correlated momentum transport by the mean flow. Since the narrow\nmaximum is of larger amplitude for $Re_S=2\\cdot10^4$, our simulations suggest\nthat it will dominate at even higher $Re_S$.\n", "  We study an optomechanical system in which the mechanical motion of a single\ntrapped ion is coupled to a cavity field for the realization of a strongly\nquantum correlated two-mode system. We show that for large pump intensities the\nsteady state photon number exhibits bistable behaviour. We further analyze the\noccurrence of normal mode splitting (NMS) due to mixing of the fluctuations of\nthe cavity field and the fluctuations of the ion motion which indicates a\ncoherent energy exchange. We also find that in the parameter regime where NMS\nexists, the steady state of the system shows continuous variable entanglement.\nSuch a two-mode optomechanical system can be used for the realization of\ncontinuous variable quantum information interfaces and networks.\n", "  We propose a full-wave pseudo-analytical numerical electromagnetic (EM)\nalgorithm to model subsurface induction sensors, traversing planar-layered\ngeological formations of arbitrary EM material anisotropy and loss, which are\nused, for example, in the exploration of hydrocarbon reserves. Unlike past\npseudo-analytical planar-layered modeling algorithms that impose parallelism\nbetween the formation's bed junctions however, our method involves judicious\nemployment of Transformation Optics techniques to address challenges related to\nmodeling relative slope (i.e., tilting) between said junctions (including\narbitrary azimuth orientation of each junction). The algorithm exhibits this\nflexibility, both with respect to loss and anisotropy in the formation layers\nas well as junction tilting, via employing special planar slabs that coat each\n\"flattened\" (i.e., originally tilted) planar interface, locally redirecting the\nincident wave within the coating slabs to cause wave fronts to interact with\nthe flattened interfaces as if they were still tilted with a specific,\nuser-defined orientation. Moreover, since the coating layers are homogeneous\nrather than exhibiting continuous material variation, a minimal number of these\nlayers must be inserted and hence reduces added simulation time and\ncomputational expense. As said coating layers are not reflectionless however,\nthey do induce artificial field scattering that corrupts legitimate field\nsignatures due to the (effective) interface tilting. Numerical results, for two\nhalf-spaces separated by a tilted interface, quantify error trends versus\nmaterial and sensor characteristics. We finally exhibit responses of sensors\ntraversing three-layered media, where we vary the anisotropy, loss, and\nrelative tilting of the formations and explore the sensitivity of the sensor's\ncomplex-valued measurements.\n", "  In this study we model early times dynamics of the system produced in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions by an initial color electric field which then\ndecays to a plasma by the Schwinger mechanism, coupling the dynamical evolution\nof the initial color field to the dynamics of the many particles system\nproduced by the decay. The latter is described by relativistic kinetic theory\nin which we fix the ratio $\\eta/s$ rather than insisting on specific\nmicroscopic processes. We study isotropization and thermalization of the system\nproduced by the field decay for a static box and for a $1+1$D expanding\ngeometry. We find that regardless of the viscosity of the produced plasma, the\ninitial color electric field decays within $1$ fm/c; however in the case\n$\\eta/s$ is large, oscillations of the field are effective along all the entire\ntime evolution of the system, which affect the late times evolution of the\nratio between longitudinal and transverse pressure. In case of small $\\eta/s$\n($\\eta/s\\lesssim0.3$) we find $\\tau_{isotropization}\\approx 0.8$ fm/c and\n$\\tau_{thermalization}\\approx 1$ fm/c in agreement with the common lore of\nhydrodynamics. Moreover we have investigated the effect of turning from the\nrelaxation time approximation to the Chapman-Enskog one: we find that this\nimprovement affects mainly the early times evolution of the physical\nquantities, the effect being milder in the late times evolution.\n", "  In the standard Random Surfer Model, the teleportation matrix is necessary to\nensure that the final PageRank vector is well-defined. The introduction of this\nmatrix, however, results in serious problems and imposes fundamental\nlimitations to the quality of the ranking vectors. In this work, building on\nthe recently proposed NCDawareRank framework, we exploit the decomposition of\nthe underlying space into blocks, and we derive easy to check necessary and\nsufficient conditions for random surfing without teleportation.\n", "  Recent precise observations of cosmic rays (CRs) by AMS-02 experiment clearly\nshow (1) harder spectra of helium and carbon compared to protons by $\\propto\nR^{0.08}$, and (2) concave breaks in proton and helium spectra at a rigidity $R\n\\sim 300$ GV. In particular the helium and carbon spectra are exactly similar,\npointing to the same acceleration site. We examine possible interpretations of\nthese features and identify a chemically enriched region, that is, superbubbles\nas the most probable origin of Galactic CRs in high rigidity $R>30$ GV. The\nsimilar spectra of CR carbon and helium further suggest that the CRs with\n$R>30$ GV originate from the supernova ejecta in the superbubble core, mixed\nwith comparable or less amount of interstellar medium. We predict similar\nspectra for heavy nuclei.\n", "  The spin-boson model (or the dissipative two-state system) is a model for the\nstudy of dissipation and decoherence in quantum mechanics. The spin-boson model\nwith Ohmic dissipation is an integrable theory, related to several other\nintegrable systems including the anisotropic Kondo and resonant level models.\nHere we consider the problem of computing the overlaps between two ground\nstates corresponding to different values of parameters of the Ohmic spin-boson\nHamiltonian. We argue that this can be understood as a part of the problem of\nquantizing the mKdV/sine-Gordon integrable hierarchy. The main objective of\nthis work is to analyze how the Anderson orthogonality affects the Yang-Baxter\nintegrable structure underlying the theory.\n", "  Share price returns on different time scales can be well modelled by a\nsuperstatistical dynamics. Here we provide an investigation which type of\nsuperstatistics is most suitable to properly describe share price dynamics on\nvarious time scales. It is shown that while chi-square superstatistics works\nwell on a time scale of days, on a much smaller time scale of minutes the price\nchanges are better described by lognormal superstatistics. The system dynamics\nthus exhibits a transition from lognormal to chi-square superstatistics as a\nfunction of time scale. We discuss a more general model interpolating between\nboth statistics which fits the observed data very well. We also present results\non correlation functions of the extracted superstatistical volatility\nparameter, which exhibits exponential decay for returns on large time scales,\nwhereas for returns on small time scales there are long-range correlations and\npower-law decay.\n", "  Recently in Phys. Rev. D 88, 027504 (2013) Yoon has suggested that there may\nbe problems for the non-relativistic limit of the conformal gravity theory.\nHere we show that Yoon's results only hold because of the assumption that\ngravitational sources can be treated the same way that they are treated in\nstandard Newton-Einstein gravity. Since such an assumption violates the\ntheory's underlying conformal invariance,Yoon's conclusions are invalidated.\n", "  Methylammonium lead halide perovskites have been developed as highly\npromising materials to fabricate efficient solar cells in the past few years.\nThe real impact to energy applications relies on the understanding and\ncontrolling of the stability of the material. We investigated the degradation\nof CH3NH3PbI3 by air exposure using x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The\nstoichiometric sample was grown with co-evaporation of PbI2 and CH3NH3I on a Au\ncoated Si wafer. It was found that the perovskite thin film gradually turned to\nPbI2 in air, accompanied with complete removal of N and substantial reduction\nof I. It was also observed that PbI2 crystallization roughened the film and\nresulted in a partial exposure of the Au substrate.\n", "  Plasmonic resonance of a metallic nanostructure results from coherent motion\nof its conduction electrons driven by incident light. At the resonance, the\ninduced dipole in the nanostructure is proportional to the number of the\nconduction electrons, hence $10^{7}$ times larger than that in an atom. The\ninteraction energy between the induced dipole and fluctuating virtual field of\nthe incident light can reach a few tenths of an eV. Therefore, the classical\nelectromagnetism dominating the field becomes inadequate. We argue that quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) should be used instead as the fundamental theory to\ndescribe the virtual field and its interaction with the electrons. Based on\nQED, we derive analytic expressions for the plasmonic resonant frequency, which\ndepends on three easily accessible material parameters. The analytic theory\nreproduces very well the experimental data, and can be used for rational design\nof materials.\n", "  Stochastic digital backpropagation (SDBP) is an extension of digital\nbackpropagation (DBP) and is based on the maximum a posteriori principle. SDBP\ntakes into account noise from the optical amplifiers in addition to handling\ndeterministic linear and nonlinear impairments. The decisions in SDBP are taken\non a symbol-by-symbol (SBS) basis, ignoring any residual memory, which may be\npresent due to non-optimal processing in SDBP. In this paper, we extend SDBP to\naccount for memory between symbols. In particular, two different methods are\nproposed: a Viterbi algorithm (VA) and a decision directed approach. Symbol\nerror rate (SER) for memory-based SDBP is significantly lower than the\npreviously proposed SBS-SDBP. For inline dispersion-managed links, the VA-SDBP\nhas up to 10 and 14 times lower SER than DBP for QPSK and 16-QAM, respectively.\n", "  The apparent dominance of matter over antimatter in our universe is an\nobvious and puzzling fact which cannot be adequately explained in present\nphysical frameworks that assume matter-antimatter symmetry at the big bang.\nHowever, our present knowledge of starting conditions and of known sources of\nCP violation are both insufficient to explain the observed asymmetry. Therefore\nongoing research on matter-antimatter differences is strongly motivated as well\nas attempts to identify viable new mechanisms that could create the present\nasymmetry. Here we concentrate on possible precision experiments at low\nenergies towards a resolution of this puzzle.\n", "  Single cells often generate precise responses by involving dissipative\nout-of-thermodynamic equilibrium processes in signaling networks. The available\nfree energy to fuel these processes could become limited depending on the\nmetabolic state of an individual cell. How does limiting dissipation affect the\nkinetics of high precision responses in single cells? I address this question\nin the context of a kinetic proofreading scheme used in a simple model of early\ntime T cell signaling. I show using exact analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations that limiting dissipation qualitatively changes the kinetics in\nsingle cells marked by emergence of slow kinetics, large cell-to-cell\nvariations of copy numbers, temporally correlated stochastic events (dynamic\nfacilitation), and, ergodicity breaking. Thus, constraints in energy\ndissipation, in addition to negatively affecting ligand discrimination in T\ncells, can create a fundamental difficulty in interpreting single cell kinetics\nfrom cell population level results.\n", "  Interactions between surfaces and proteins occur in many vital processes and\nare crucial in biotechnology: the ability to control specific interactions is\nessential in fields like biomaterials, biomedical implants and biosensors. In\nthe latter case, biosensor sensitivity hinges on ligand proteins adsorbing on\nbioactive surfaces with a favorable orientation, exposing reaction sites to\ntarget molecules. Protein adsorption, being a free-energy-driven process, is\ndifficult to study experimentally. This paper develops and evaluates a\ncomputational model to study electrostatic interactions of proteins and charged\nnanosurfaces, via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We extended the\nimplicit-solvent model used in the open-source code PyGBe to include surfaces\nof imposed charge or potential. This code solves the boundary integral\nformulation of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, discretized with surface\nelements. PyGBe has at its core a treecode-accelerated Krylov iterative solver,\nresulting in O(N log N) scaling, with further acceleration on hardware via\nmulti-threaded execution on \\gpu s. It computes solvation and surface free\nenergies, providing a framework for studying the effect of electrostatics on\nadsorption. We then derived an analytical solution for a spherical charged\nsurface interacting with a spherical molecule, then completed a\ngrid-convergence study to build evidence on the correctness of our approach.\nThe study showed the error decaying with the average area of the boundary\nelements, i.e., the method is O(1/N), which is consistent with our previous\nverification studies using PyGBe. We also studied grid-convergence using a real\nmolecular geometry (protein GB1D4'), in this case using Richardson\nextrapolation (in the absence of an analytical solution) and confirmed the\nO(1/N) scaling in this case.\n", "  We present a mechanism for a generic and powerful force of assembly and\nmobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force is a\npre-transition (or pre-melting) effect for the first-order transition between\nordered and disordered phases in the host membrane. Using large scale molecular\nsimulation, we show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of\nthe disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic\norder-disorder interface, and the stiffness of that interface is finite. When\ntwo such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces\nthe net interfacial free energy. In analogy with the hydrophobic effect, we\nrefer to this phenomenon as the \"orderphobic effect\". The effect is mediated by\nproximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic\nmismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from the\norderphobic effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from\nmembrane elasticity for the membranes we examine.\n", "  We propose a novel scheme for high fidelity photonic controlled phase gates\nusing Rydberg blockade in an ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity. The gate\noperation is obtained by first storing a photonic pulse in the ensemble and\nthen scattering a second pulse from the cavity, resulting in a phase change\ndepending on whether the first pulse contained a single photon. We show that\nthe combination of Rydberg blockade and optical cavities effectively enhances\nthe optical non-linearity created by the strong Rydberg interaction and thereby\nreduces the requirements for photonic quantum gates. The resulting gate can be\nimplemented with cavities of moderate finesse which allows for highly efficient\nprocessing of quantum information encoded in photons. As a particular example\nof this, we show how the gate can be employed to increase the communication\nrate of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles.\n", "  With the recent advances in radioactive ion beam technology, Coulomb\nexcitation at safe energies becomes an important experimental tool in\nnuclear-structure physics. The usefulness of the technique to extract key\ninformation on the electromagnetic properties of nuclei has been demonstrated\nsince the 1960's with stable beam and target combinations. New challenges\npresent themselves when studying exotic nuclei with this technique, including\ndealing with low statistics or number of data points, absolute and relative\nnormalisation of the measured cross sections and a lack of complimentary\nexperimental data, such as excited-state lifetimes and branching ratios. This\npaper addresses some of these common issues and presents analysis techniques to\nextract transition strengths and quadrupole moments utilising the least-squares\nfit code, {\\rmfamily \\textsc{gosia}}.\n", "  We propose a class of auxetic three-dimensional lattice structures. The\nelastic microstructure can be designed in order to have omni-directional\nPoisson's ratio arbitrarily close to the stability limit -1. The cubic behavior\nof the periodic system has been fully characterized; the minumum and maximum\nPoisson's ratio and the associated principal directions are given as a function\nof the microstructural parameters. The initial microstructure is then modified\ninto a body centered-cubic system that can achieve a Poisson's ratio lower than\n-1 and that can also behave as an isotropic three-dimensional auxetic\nstructure.\n", "  Turbulent-laminar intermittency, typically in the form of bands and spots, is\na ubiquitous feature of the route to turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows.\nHere we study the idealised shear between stress-free boundaries driven by a\nsinusoidal body force and demonstrate quantitative agreement between turbulence\nin this flow and that found in the interior of plane Couette flow -- the region\nexcluding the boundary layers. Exploiting the absence of boundary layers, we\nconstruct a model flow that uses only four Fourier modes in the shear direction\nand yet robustly captures the range of spatiotemporal phenomena observed in\ntransition, from spot growth to turbulent bands and uniform turbulence. The\nmodel substantially reduces the cost of simulating intermittent turbulent\nstructures while maintaining the essential physics and a direct connection to\nthe Navier-Stokes equations.\n  We demonstrate the generic nature of this process by introducing stress-free\nequivalent flows for plane Poiseuille and pipe flows which again capture the\nturbulent-laminar structures seen in transition.\n", "  We study spin chains with boundaries that are dual to open strings suspended\nbetween systems of giant gravitons and dual giant gravitons. The anomalous\ndimensions computed in the gauge theory are in complete quantitative agreement\nwith energies computed in the dual string theory. The comparison makes use of a\ndescription in terms of magnons, generalizing results for a single maximal\ngiant graviton. The symmetries of the problem determine the structure of the\nmagnon boundary reflection/scattering matrix up to a phase. We compute a\nreflection/scattering matrix element at weak coupling and verify that it is\nconsistent with the answer determined by symmetry. We find the\nreflection/scattering matrix does not satisfy the boundary Yang-Baxter equation\nso that the boundary condition on the open spin chain spoils integrability. We\nalso explain the interpretation of the double coset ansatz in the magnon\nlanguage.\n", "  An overview of neutrino electromagnetic properties, which open a door to the\nnew physics beyond the Standard Model, is given. The effects of neutrino\nelectromagnetic interactions both in terrestrial experiments and in\nastrophysical environments are discussed. The experimental bounds on neutrino\nelectromagnetic characteristics are summarized. Future astrophysical probes of\nelectromagnetic neutrinos are outlined.\n", "  We carry out a systematic study of the dispersion relation for linear\nelectrostatic waves in an arbitrarily degenerate quantum electron plasma. We\nsolve for the complex frequency spectrum for arbitrary values of wavenumber $k$\nand level of degeneracy $\\mu$. Our finding is that for large $k$ and high $\\mu$\nthe real part of the frequency $\\omega_{r}$ grows linearly with $k$ and scales\nwith $\\mu$ only because of the scaling of the Fermi energy. In this regime the\nrelative Landau damping rate $\\gamma/\\omega_{r}$ becomes independent of $k$ and\nvaries inversly with $\\mu$. Thus, damping is weak but finite at moderate levels\nof degeneracy for short wavelengths.\n", "  This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental work on a new class\nof topological material - topological Kondo insulators, which develop through\nthe interplay of strong correlations and spin-orbit interactions. The history\nof Kondo insulators is reviewed along with the theoretical models used to\ndescribe these heavy fermion compounds. The Fu-Kane method of topological\nclassification of insulators is used to show that hybridization between the\nconduction electrons and localized f-electrons in these systems gives rise to\ninteraction-induced topological insulating behavior. Finally, some recent\nexperimental results are discussed, which appear to confirm the theoretical\nprediction of the topological insulating behavior in Samarium hexaboride, where\nthe long-standing puzzle of the residual low-temperature conductivity has been\nshown to originate from robust surface states.\n", "  A theoretical approach using ab initio calculations has been applied to study\nthe interaction of an ultra-short laser pulse with the metal alloy\nFe$_{0.72}$Cr$_{0.18}$Ni$_{0.1}$ (AISI 304). The electronic structure is\nsimulated by taking into account the chemical and magnetic disorder of the\nalloy by the coherent potential approximation implemented in a fully\nrelativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-formalism in the framework of spin density\nfunctional theory. Utilizing these predictions we determined the electron heat\ncapacity and the electron-phonon coupling factor of\nFe$_{0.72}$Cr$_{0.18}$Ni$_{0.1}$ in dependence on the electron temperature for\ntwo-temperature model applications. Compared with pure Fe a maximum deviation\nof 5~\\% for the electron heat capacity and 25~\\% for the electron-phonon\ncoupling factor is found.\n", "  We use the Kossakowski-Lindblad-Davies formalism to consider an open system\ndefined as the Markovian extension of one-mode quantum oscillator S, perturbed\nby a piecewise stationary harmonic interaction with a chain of oscillators C.\nThe long-time asymptotic behaviour of various subsystems of S+C are obtained in\nthe framework of the dual W-dynamical system approach.\n", "  The Supersymmetric SO(10) theory (\"NMSO(10)GUT\") based on the\\hfil\\break\n${\\bf{210+126 +\\oot}}$ Higgs system proposed in 1982 has evolved into a\nrealistic theory capable of fitting the known low energy Particle Physics data\nbesides providing a Dark matter candidate and embedding Inflationary Cosmology.\nIt dynamically resolves longstanding issues such as fast dimension five\noperator mediated proton decay in Susy GUTs by allowing explicit and complete\ncalculation of crucial threshold effects at $M_{Susy}$ and $M_{GUT}$ in terms\nof fundamental parameters. This shows that SO(10) Yukawas responsible for\nobserved fermion masses as well as operator dimension 5 mediated proton decay\ncan be highly suppressed on a \"Higgs dissolution edge\" in the parameter space\nof GUTs with rich superheavy spectra. This novel and generically relevant\nresult highlights the need for every realistic UV completion model with a\nlarge/infinite number of heavy fields coupled to the light Higgs doublets to\nexplicitly account for the large wave function renormalization effects on\nemergent light Higgs fields in order to be considered a quantitatively well\ndefined candidate UV completion. The NMSGUT predicts large soft Susy breaking\ntrilinear couplings and distinctive sparticle spectra. Measurable or near\nmeasurable level of tensor perturbations- and thus large Inflaton mass scale-\nmay be accommodated by Supersymetric Seesaw inflation within the NMSGUT based\non an LHN flat direction Inflaton if the Higgs component contains contributions\nfrom heavy Higgs components. Successful NMSGUT fits suggest a\n\\emph{renormalizable} Yukawon Ultra minimal gauged theory of flavor based upon\nthe NMSGUT Higgs structure.\n", "  In the third fermion family and gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, we\nstudy the quark-quark, lepton-lepton and quark-lepton four-fermion operators in\nan effective theory at high energies. These operators have nontrivial\ncontributions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations for fermion self-energy\nfunctions and the $W^\\pm$-boson coupling vertex. As a result, the top-quark\nmass is generated via the spontaneous symmetry breaking of $\\langle\\bar t t\n\\rangle$-condensate and the $W^\\pm$-boson coupling becomes approximately\nvectorlike at TeV scale. The bottom-quark, tau-lepton and tau-neutrino masses\nare generated via the explicit symmetry breaking of $W^\\pm$-contributions and\nquark-lepton interactions. Their masses and Yukawa couplings are functions of\nthe top-quark mass and Yukawa coupling. We qualitatively show the hierarchy of\nfermion masses and Yukawa couplings of the third fermion family. We also\ndiscuss the possible collider signatures due to the vectorlike\n(parity-restoration) feature of $W^\\pm$-boson coupling at high energies.\n", "  Large spin systems can exhibit unconventional types of magnetic ordering\ndifferent from the ferromagnetic or N\\'eel-like antiferromagnetic order\ncommonly found in spin 1/2 systems. Spin-nematic phases, for instance, do not\nbreak time-reversal invariance and their magnetic order parameter is\ncharacterized by a second rank tensor with the symmetry of an ellipsoid. Here\nwe show direct experimental evidence for spin-nematic ordering in a spin-1\nBose-Einstein condensate of sodium atoms with antiferromagnetic interactions.\nIn a mean field description this order is enforced by locking the relative\nphase between spin components. We reveal this mechanism by studying the spin\nnoise after a spin rotation, which is shown to contain information hidden when\nlooking only at averages. The method should be applicable to high spin systems\nin order to reveal complex magnetic phases.\n", "  By means of a projector-operator formalism we derive an approximation based\non a self consistent hybridization expansion to study the ground state\nproperties of the Anderson Impurity model. We applied the approximation to the\ngeneral case of finite Coulomb repulsion $U$, extending previous work with the\nsame formalism in the infinite-$U$ case. The treatment provides a very accurate\ncalculation of the ground state energy and their related zero temperature\nproperties in the case in which $U$ is large enough, but still finite, as\ncompared with the rest of energy scales involved in the model. The results for\nthe valence of the impurity are compared with exact results that we obtain from\nequations derived using the Bethe ansatz and with a perturbative approach. The\nmagnetization and magnetic susceptibility is also compared with Bethe ansatz\nresults. In order to do this comparison, we also show how to regularize the\nBethe ansatz integral equations necessary to calculate the impurity valence,\nfor arbitrary values of the parameters.\n", "  We report a tight-binding model study of two-terminal graphene nanopore based\ndevice, for sequential determination of DNA bases. Using Greens function\napproach we calculate conductance spectra, I-V response and also the changes in\nlocal density of states (LDOS) profile as four different nucleobases inserted\none by one into the pore embedded in the zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR). We\nfind distinct features in LDOS profile for different nucleotides and the same\nis also present in conductance and I-V response. We propose the actual working\nprinciple of the device, by setting the bias across the pore to a fixed voltage\n(this voltage gives maximum discrimination between characteristic current of\nthe four nucleotides) and translocating the ss-DNA through the nanopore using a\ntransverse electric field while recording the characteristic current of the\nnucleotides. Not only the typical current output is much larger than previous\nresults, but the seaparation between them for different bases are also\ndefinite. Our investigation provides high accuracy and significant amount of\ndistinction between different nucleotides.\n", "  Most real-world networks exhibit community structure, a phenomenon\ncharacterized by existence of node clusters whose intra-edge connectivity is\nstronger than edge connectivities between nodes belonging to different\nclusters. In addition to facilitating a better understanding of network\nbehavior, community detection finds many practical applications in diverse\nsettings. Communities in online social networks are indicative of shared\nfunctional roles, or affiliation to a common socio-economic status, the\nknowledge of which is vital for targeted advertisement. In buyer-seller\nnetworks, community detection facilitates better product recommendations.\nUnfortunately, reliability of community assignments is hindered by anomalous\nuser behavior often observed as unfair self-promotion, or \"fake\"\nhighly-connected accounts created to promote fraud. The present paper advocates\na novel approach for jointly tracking communities while detecting such\nanomalous nodes in time-varying networks. By postulating edge creation as the\nresult of mutual community participation by node pairs, a dynamic factor model\nwith anomalous memberships captured through a sparse outlier matrix is put\nforth. Efficient tracking algorithms suitable for both online and decentralized\noperation are developed. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real\nnetwork time series successfully unveil underlying communities and anomalous\nnodes.\n", "  The Wehrl entropy conjecture for coherent (highest weight) states in\nrepresentations of the Heisenberg group, which was proved in 1978 and recently\nextended by us to the group $SU(2)$, is further extended here to symmetric\nrepresentations of the groups $SU(N)$ for all $N$. This result gives further\nevidence for our conjecture that highest weight states minimize group integrals\nof certain concave functions for a large class of Lie groups and their\nrepresentations.\n", "  ATUS-PRO is a solver-package written in C++ designed for the calculation of\nnumerical solutions of the stationary- and the time dependent Gross--Pitaevskii\nequation for local two-particle contact interaction utilising finite element\nmethods. These are implemented by means of the deal.II library. The code can be\nused in order to perform simulations of Bose-Einstein condensates in\ngravito-optical surface traps, isotropic and full anisotropic harmonic traps,\nas well as for arbitrary trap geometries. A special feature of this package is\nthe possibility to calculate non-ground state solutions (topological modes,\nexcited states) for an arbitrarily high non-linearity term. The solver- package\nis designed to run on parallel distributed machines and can be applied to\nproblems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions with axial symmetry or in\nCartesian coordinates. The time dependent Gross--Pitaevskii equation is solved\nby means of the fully implicit Crank- Nicolson method, whereas stationary\nstates are obtained with a modified version based on our own constrained Newton\nmethod. The latter method enables to find the excited state solutions.\n", "  Samples of early-type galaxies show a correlation between stellar velocity\ndispersion and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) as inferred from\ngravity-sensitive absorption lines in the galaxies' central regions. To search\nfor spatial variations in the IMF, we have observed two early-type galaxies\nwith Keck/LRIS and measured radial gradients in the strengths of absorption\nfeatures from 4000-5500 \\AA $\\,$ and 8000-10,000 \\AA. We present spatially\nresolved measurements of the dwarf-sensitive spectral indices NaI (8190 \\AA)\nand Wing-Ford FeH (9915 \\AA), as well as indices for species of H, C$_2$, CN,\nMg, Ca, TiO, and Fe. Our measurements show a metallicity gradient in both\nobjects, and Mg/Fe consistent with a shallow gradient in \\alpha-enhancement,\nmatching widely observed trends for massive early-type galaxies. The NaI index\nand the CN$_1$ index at 4160 \\AA $\\,$ exhibit significantly steeper gradients,\nwith a break at $r \\sim 0.1 r_{\\rm eff}$ ($r \\sim 300$ pc). Inside this radius\nNaI strength increases sharply toward the galaxy center, consistent with a\nrapid central rise in [Na/Fe]. In contrast, the ratio of FeH to Fe index\nstrength decreases toward the galaxy center. This behavior cannot be reproduced\nby a steepening IMF inside $0.1 r_{\\rm eff}$ if the IMF is a single power law.\nWhile gradients in the mass function above $\\sim 0.4 M_\\odot$ may occur,\nexceptional care is required to disentangle these IMF variations from the\nextreme variations in individual element abundances near the galaxies' centers.\n", "  Searches for supersymmetric top quarks at the LHC have been making great\nprogress in pushing sensitivity out to higher mass, but are famously plagued by\ngaps in coverage around lower-mass regions where the decay phase space is\nclosing off. Within the common stop-NLSP / neutralino-LSP simplified model, the\nline in the mass plane where there is just enough phase space to produce an\non-shell top quark remains almost completely unconstrained. Here, we show that\nis possible to define searches capable of probing a large patch of this\ndifficult region, with S/B ~ 1 and significances often well beyond 5 sigma. The\nbasic strategy is to leverage the large energy gain of LHC Run 2, leading to a\nsizable population of stop pair events recoiling against a hard jet. The recoil\nnot only re-establishes a MET signature, but also leads to a distinctive\nanti-correlation between the MET and the recoil jet transverse vectors when the\nstops decay all-hadronically. Accounting for jet combinatorics, backgrounds,\nand imperfections in MET measurements, we estimate that Run 2 will already\nstart to close the gap in exclusion sensitivity with the first few 10s of\ninverse-fb. By 300/fb, exclusion sensitivity may extend from stop masses of 550\nGeV on the high side down to below 200 GeV on the low side, approaching the\n\"stealth\" point at m(stop) = m(top) and potentially overlapping with limits\nfrom top pair cross section and spin correlation measurements.\n", "  The ionic atmospheres around nucleic acids play important roles in biological\nfunction. Large-scale explicit solvent simulations coupled to experimental\nassays such as anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) can provide\nimportant insights into the structure and energetics of such atmospheres but\nare time- and resource-intensive. In this paper, we use classical density\nfunctional theory (cDFT) to explore the balance between ion-DNA, ion-water, and\nion-ion interactions in ionic atmospheres of RbCl, SrCl$_2$, and CoHexCl$_3$\n(cobalt hexammine chloride) around a B-form DNA molecule. The accuracy of the\ncDFT calculations was assessed by comparison between simulated and experimental\nASAXS curves, demonstrating that an accurate model should take into account\nion-ion correlation and ion hydration forces, DNA topology, and the discrete\ndistribution of charges on DNA strands. As expected, these calculations\nrevealed significant differences between monovalent, divalent, and trivalent\ncation distributions around DNA. About half of the DNA-bound Rb$^+$ ions\npenetrate into the minor groove of the DNA and half adsorb on the DNA strands.\nThe fraction of cations in the minor groove decreases for the larger Sr$^{2+}$\nions and becomes zero for CoHex$^{3+}$ ions, which all adsorb on the DNA\nstrands. The distribution of CoHex$^{3+}$ ions is mainly determined by Coulomb\nand steric interactions, while ion-correlation forces play a central role in\nthe monovalent Rb$^+$ distribution and a combination of ion-correlation and\nhydration forces affect the Sr$^{2+}$ distribution around DNA.\n", "  I review theoretical issues associated with the Higgs boson and the mystery\nof spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry. This essay is\nintended as an introduction to the special issue of Annalen der Physik,\n\"Particle Physics after the Higgs\".\n", "  Community detection is a fundamental problem in the domain of complex-network\nanalysis. It has received great attention, and many community detection methods\nhave been proposed in the last decade. In this paper, we propose a divisive\nspectral method for identifying community structures from networks, which\nutilizes a sparsification operation to pre-process the networks first, and then\nuses a repeated bisection spectral algorithm to partition the networks into\ncommunities. The sparsification operation makes the community boundaries more\nclearer and more sharper, so that the repeated spectral bisection algorithm\nextract high-quality community structures accurately from the sparsified\nnetworks. Experiments show that the combination of network sparsification and\nspectral bisection algorithm is highly successful, the proposed method is more\neffective in detecting community structures from networks than the others.\n", "  We analyze the stability under time evolution of complexifier coherent states\n(CCS) in one-dimensional mechanical systems. A system of coherent states is\ncalled stable if it evolves into another coherent state. It turns out that a\nsystem can only poses stable CCS if the classical evolution of the variable for\na given complexifier C depends only on z itself and not on its complex\nconjugate. This condition is very restrictive in general so that only few\nsystems exist that obey this condition. However, it is possible to access a\nwider class of models that in principle may allow for stable coherent states\nassociated to certain regions in the phase space by introducing action-angle\ncoordinates.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the static spin response in\nHgTe quantum wells, revealing distinctive behavior for the topologically\nnontrivial inverted structure. Most strikingly, the q=0 (long-wave-length) spin\nsusceptibility of the undoped topological-insulator system is constant and\nequal to the value found for the gapless Dirac-like structure, whereas the same\nquantity shows the typical decrease with increasing band gap in the\nnormal-insulator regime. We discuss ramifications for the ordering of localized\nmagnetic moments present in the quantum well, both in the insulating and\nelectron-doped situations. The spin response of edge states is also considered,\nand we extract effective Lande g-factors for the bulk and edge electrons. The\nvariety of counter-intuitive spin-response properties revealed in our study\narises from the system's versatility in accessing situations where the\ncharge-carrier dynamics can be governed by ordinary Schrodinger-type physics,\nmimics the behavior of chiral Dirac fermions, or reflects the material's\nsymmetry-protected topological order.\n", "  We derive an integral expression for the leading-order type I-I-I three-point\nfunctions in the $\\mathfrak{su}(2) $-sector of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills\ntheory, for which no determinant formula is known. To this end, we first map\nthe problem to the partition function of the six vertex model with a hexagonal\nboundary. The advantage of the six-vertex model expression is that it reveals\nan extra symmetry of the problem, which is the invariance under 90$^{\\circ}$\nrotation. On the spin-chain side, this corresponds to the exchange of the\nquantum space and the auxiliary space and is reminiscent of the mirror\ntransformation employed in the worldsheet S-matrix approaches. After the\nrotation, we then apply Sklyanin's separation of variables (SoV) and obtain a\nmultiple-integral expression of the three-point function. The resulting\nintegrand is expressed in terms of the so-called Baxter polynomials, which is\nclosely related to the quantum spectral curve approach. Along the way, we also\nderive several new results about the SoV, such as the explicit construction of\nthe basis with twisted boundary conditions and the overlap between the orginal\nSoV state and the SoV states on the subchains.\n", "  The ionization of atoms by strong, low-frequency fields can generally be\ndescribed well by assuming that the photoelectron is, after the ionization\nstep, completely at the mercy of the laser field. However, certain phenomena,\nlike the recent discovery of low-energy structures in the long-wavelength\nregime, require the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction with the ion once the\nelectron is in the continuum. We explore the first-principles inclusion of this\ninteraction, known as analytical R-matrix theory, and its consequences on the\ncorresponding quantum orbits. We show that the trajectory must have an\nimaginary component, and that this causes branch cuts in the complex time plane\nwhen the real trajectory revisits the neighbourhood of the ionic core. We\nprovide a framework for consistently navigating these branch cuts based on\nclosest-approach times, which satisfy the equation $\\mathbf{r}(t) \\cdot\n\\mathbf{v}(t) = 0$ in the complex plane. We explore the geometry of these roots\nand describe the geometrical structures underlying the emergence of LES in both\nthe classical and quantum domains.\n", "  Generating functions for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of osp(1|2) are derived.\nThese coefficients are expressed as q goes to - 1 limits of the dual q-Hahn\npolynomials. The generating functions are obtained using two different\napproaches respectively based on the coherent-state representation and the\nposition representation of osp(1j2).\n", "  In this note we classify invariant star products with quantum momentum maps\non symplectic manifolds by means of an equivariant characteristic class taking\nvalues in the equivariant cohomology. We establish a bijection between the\nequivalence classes and the formal series in the second equivariant cohomology,\nthereby giving a refined classification which takes into account the quantum\nmomentum map as well.\n", "  We study the 2D linear stability analysis of a deformable solid of a finite\nheight $H$, steadily sliding on top of a rigid solid within a generic\nrate-and-state friction type constitutive framework, fully accounting for\nelastodynamic effects. We derive the linear stability spectrum, quantifying the\ninterplay between stabilization related to the frictional constitutive law and\ndestabilization related both to the elastodynamic bi-material coupling between\nnormal stress variations and interfacial slip, and to finite size effects. The\nstabilizing effects related to the frictional constitutive law include\nvelocity-strengthening friction (i.e.~an increase in frictional resistance with\nincreasing slip velocity, both instantaneous and under steady-state conditions)\nand a regularized response to normal stress variations. We first consider the\nsmall wave-number $k$ limit and demonstrate that homogeneous sliding in this\ncase is universally unstable, independently of the details of the friction law.\nThis universal instability is mediated by propagating waveguide-like modes,\nwhose fastest growing mode is characterized by a wave-number satisfying $k\nH\\!\\sim\\!{\\cal O}(1)$ and by a growth rate that scales with $H^{-1}$. We then\nconsider the limit $k H\\!\\to\\!\\infty$ and derive the stability phase diagram in\nthis case. We show that the dominant instability mode travels at nearly the\ndilatational wave-speed in the opposite direction to the sliding direction.\nInstability modes which travel at nearly the shear wave-speed in the sliding\ndirection also exist in some range of physical parameters. Finally, we show\nthat a finite-time regularized response to normal stress variations, within the\nframework of generalized rate-and-state friction models, tends to promote\nstability.\n", "  Having in mind its future extension for theoretical investigations related to\ncharmed nuclei, we develop a relativistic formalism for the nonmesonic weak\ndecay of single-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei in the framework of the\nindependent-particle shell model and with the dynamics represented by the\n$(\\pi,K)$ one-meson-exchange model. Numerical results for the\none-nucleon-induced transition rates of ${}^{12}_{\\Lambda}\\textrm{C}$ are\npresented and compared with those obtained in the analogous nonrelativistic\ncalculation. There is satisfactory agreement between the two approaches, and\nthe most noteworthy difference is that the ratio $\\Gamma_{n}/\\Gamma_{p}$ is\nappreciably higher and closer to the experimental value in the relativistic\ncalculation. Large discrepancies between ours and previous relativistic\ncalculations are found, for which we do not encounter any fully satisfactory\nexplanation. The most recent experimental data is well reproduced by our\nresults. In summary, we have achieved our purpose to develop a reliable model\nfor the relativistic calculation of the nonmesonic weak decay of\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei, which can now be extended to evaluate similar processes\nin charmed nuclei.\n", "  We numerically investigate margination of white blood cells and demonstrate\nthe dependency on a number of conditions including hematocrit, the\ndeformability of the cells and the Reynolds number. A detailed mesoscopic\nhydrodynamic Helfrich-type model is derived, validated and used for the\nsimulations to provides a quantitative description of the margination of white\nblood cells. Previous simulation results, obtained with less detailed models,\ncould be confirmed, e.g. the largest probability of margination of white blood\ncells at an intermediate range of hematocrit values and a decreasing tendency\nwith increasing deformability. The consideration of inertia effects, which\nbecome of relevance in small vessels, also shows a dependency and leads to less\npronounced margination of white blood cells with increasing Reynolds number.\n", "  Recent experimental data on the $\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\eta$ and\n$\\Upsilon(4S)\\to h_{b}(1P)\\eta$ processes seem to contradict the naive\nexpectation that hadronic transitions with spin-flipping terms should be\nsuppressed with respect those without spin-flip. We analyze these transitions\nusing the QCD Multipole Expansion (QCDME) approach and within a constituent\nquark model framework that has been applied successfully to the heavy-quark\nsectors during the last years. The QCDME formalism requires the computation of\nhybrid intermediate states which has been performed in a natural,\nparameter-free extension of our constituent quark model based on the Quark\nConfining String (QCS) scheme. We show that i) the M1-M1 contribution in the\ndecay rate of the $\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\eta$ is important and its\nsupression until now is not justified; ii) the role played by the $L=0$ hybrid\nstates, which enter in the calculation of the M1-M1 contribution, explains the\nenhancement in the $\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\eta$ decay rate; and iii) the\nanomalously large decay rate of the $\\Upsilon(4S)\\to h_{b}(1P)\\eta$ process has\nthe same physical origin.\n", "  We describe a simple annealing procedure to obtain the Hugoniot locus (states\naccessible by a shock wave) for a given material in a computationally efficient\nmanner. We apply this method to determine the Hugoniot locus in bulk silicon\nfrom ab initio molecular dynamics with forces from density-functional theory,\nup to 70 GPa. The fact that shock waves can split into multiple waves due to\nphase transitions or yielding is taken into account here by specifying the\nstrength of any preceding waves explicitly based on their yield strain. Points\ncorresponding to uniaxial elastic compression along three crystal axes and a\nnumber of post-shock phases are given, including a plastically-yielded state,\napproximated by an isotropic stress configuration following an elastic wave of\npredetermined strength. The results compare well to existing experimental data\nfor shocked silicon.\n", "  The topological charge of an electromagnetic vortex beam depends on its\nwavefront helicity. For mixed vortex beams composed of several different\ncoaxial vortices, the topological charge spectrum can be obtained by Fourier\ntransform. However, the vortex beam is generally divergent and imperfect. It\nmakes it significant to investigate the local topological charges, especially\nin radio frequency regime. Fourier transform based methods are restrained by\nthe uncertainty principle and cannot achieve high angular resolution and mode\nresolution simultaneously. In this letter, an analysis method for local\ntopological charges of vortex beams is presented based on the empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD). From EMD, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can be\nobtained to construct the bases of the electromagnetic wave, and each local\ntopological charge can be respectively defined. With this method the local\nvalue achieves both high resolution of azimuth angle and topological charge,\nmeanwhile the amplitudes of each OAM modes are presented as well. The\nsimulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the EMD based\nmethod.\n", "  The Yangian level-one hypercharge generator for the super Wilson loop in N =\n4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is constructed. Moreover, evidence for the\npresence of a corresponding symmetry generator at all higher levels is\nprovided. The derivation is restricted to the strong-coupling description of\nthe super Wilson loop and based on the construction of novel conserved charges\nfor type IIB superstrings on AdS_5 x S^5.\n", "  We have measured temperature dependencies of the electric resistance $R$ and\nupper critical magnetic field $H_{c2}$ of a magnetic superconductor\nDy$_{0.6}$Y$_{0.4}$Rh$_{3.85}$Ru$_{0.15}$B$_4$. The measurements were made for\ndifferent angles $\\varphi$ of magnetic field inclination to the direction of\nmeasuring current and revealed strong anisotropy of the behavior of $R(T)$ and\nthe values of $H_{c2}(T)$. By using the Werthamer-Gelfand-Hohenberg theory, we\ndetermined the Maki parameter $\\alpha$ and the parameter of the spin-orbital\ninteraction. For $\\varphi = 0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ both parameters are close\nto zero, thus the magnitude of $H_{c2}(0) \\approx 38$ kOe is basically limited\nby the orbital effect. At $\\varphi = 45^\\circ$, a large value of the parameter\n$\\alpha = 4.2$ indicates dominating role of the spin-paramagnetic effect in the\nsuppression of $H_{c2}(0)$ down to $8.8$ kOe. We suggest that such behavior of\n$R(T)$ and $H_{c2}(T)$ is caused by internal magnetism of the Dy atoms which\nmay strongly depend on the magnetic field orientation.\n", "  We study the activation process in large assemblies of type II excitable\nunits whose dynamics is influenced by two independent noise terms. The\nmean-field approach is applied to explicitly demonstrate that the assembly of\nexcitable units can itself exhibit macroscopic excitable behavior. In order to\nfacilitate the comparison between the excitable dynamics of a single unit and\nan assembly, we introduce three distinct formulations of the assembly\nactivation event. Each formulation treats different aspects of the relevant\nphenomena, including the threshold-like behavior and the role of coherence of\nindividual spikes. Statistical properties of the assembly activation process,\nsuch as the mean time-to-first pulse and the associated coefficient of\nvariation, are found to be qualitatively analogous for all three formulations,\nas well as to resemble the results for a single unit. These analogies are shown\nto derive from the fact that global variables undergo a stochastic bifurcation\nfrom the stochastically stable fixed point to continuous oscillations. Local\nactivation processes are analyzed in the light of the competition between the\nnoise-led and the relaxation-driven dynamics. We also briefly report on a\nsystem-size anti-resonant effect displayed by the mean time-to-first pulse.\n", "  We consider the coaction of two distinct noise sources on the activation\nprocess of a single and two interacting excitable units, which are\nmathematically described by the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations. We determine the\nmost probable activation paths around which the corresponding stochastic\ntrajectories are clustered. The key point lies in introducing appropriate\nboundary conditions that are relevant for a class II excitable unit, which can\nbe immediately generalized also to scenarios involving two coupled units. We\nanalyze the effects of the two noise sources on the statistical features of the\nactivation process, in particular demonstrating how these are modified due to\nthe linear/nonlinear form of interactions. Universal properties of the\nactivation process are qualitatively discussed in the light of a stochastic\nbifurcation that underlies the transition from a stochastically stable fixed\npoint to continuous oscillations.\n", "  We pursue our study of the antiperiodic dynamical 6-vertex model using\nSklyanin's separation of variables approach, allowing in the model new possible\nglobal shifts of the dynamical parameter. We show in particular that the\nspectrum and eigenstates of the antiperiodic transfer matrix are completely\ncharacterized by a system of discrete equations. We prove the existence of\ndifferent reformulations of this characterization in terms of functional\nequations of Baxter's type. We notably consider the homogeneous functional\n$T$-$Q$ equation which is the continuous analog of the aforementioned discrete\nsystem and show, in the case of a model with an even number of sites, that the\ncomplete spectrum and eigenstates of the antiperiodic transfer matrix can\nequivalently be described in terms of a particular class of its $Q$-solutions,\nhence leading to a complete system of Bethe equations. Finally, we compute the\nform factors of local operators for which we obtain determinant representations\nin finite volume.\n", "  The light curves of some luminous supernovae are suspected to be powered by\nthe spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar. Here we describe a possible\nsignature of the central engine: a burst of shock breakout emission occurring\nseveral days after the supernova explosion. The energy input from the magnetar\ninflates a high-pressure bubble that drives a shock through the pre-exploded\nsupernova ejecta. If the magnetar is powerful enough, that shock will near the\nejecta surface and become radiative. At the time of shock breakout, the ejecta\nwill have expanded to a large radius (~10^{14} cm) so that the radiation\nreleased is at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths (T ~ 20,000 K) and lasts for\nseveral days. The luminosity and timescale of this magnetar driven shock\nbreakout are similar to the first peak observed recently in the double-peaked\nlight curve of SNLSQ14BDQ. However, for a large region of model parameter\nspace, the breakout emission is predicted to be dimmer than the diffusive\nluminosity from direct magnetar heating. A distinct double peaked light curve\nmay therefore only be conspicuous if thermal heating from the magnetar is\nsuppressed at early times. We describe how such a delay in heating may\nnaturally result from inefficient dissipation and thermalization of the pulsar\nwind magnetic energy. Without such suppression, the breakout may only be\nnoticeable as a small bump or kink in the early luminosity or color evolution,\nor as a small but abrupt rise in the photospheric velocity. A similar breakout\nsignature may accompany other central engines in supernovae, such as a black\nhole accreting fallback material.\n", "  RGIsearch is a C++ program that searches for invariants of a user-defined set\nof renormalization group equations. Based on the general shape of the\n$\\beta$-functions of quantum field theories, RGIsearch searches for several\ntypes of invariants that require different methods. Additionally, it supports\nthe computation of invariants up to two-loop level. A manual for the program is\ngiven, including the settings and set-up of the program, as well as a test\ncase.\n", "  This paper considers probabilistic estimation of a low-rank matrix from\nnon-linear element-wise measurements of its elements. We derive the\ncorresponding approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and its state\nevolution. Relying on non-rigorous but standard assumptions motivated by\nstatistical physics, we characterize the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)\nachievable information theoretically and with the AMP algorithm. Unlike in\nrelated problems of linear estimation, in the present setting the MMSE depends\non the output channel only trough a single parameter - its Fisher information.\nWe illustrate this striking finding by analysis of submatrix localization, and\nof detection of communities hidden in a dense stochastic block model. For this\nexample we locate the computational and statistical boundaries that are not\nequal for rank larger than four.\n", "  A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined in a one-dimensional lattice under\nthe effect of an external homogeneous field is described by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. Here we prove that such an equation can be reduced,\nin the semiclassical limit and in the case of a lattice with a finite number of\nwells, to a finite-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Then,\nby means of numerical experiments we show that the BEC's center of mass\nexhibits an oscillating behavior with modulated amplitude; in particular, we\nshow that the oscillating period actually depends on the shape of the initial\nwavefunction of the condensate as well as on the strength of the nonlinear\nterm. This fact opens a question concerning the validity of a method proposed\nfor the determination of the gravitational constant by means of the measurement\nof the oscillating period.\n", "  We consider the problem of the assignment of nodes into communities from a\nset of hyperedges, where every hyperedge is a noisy observation of the\ncommunity assignment of the adjacent nodes. We focus in particular on the\nsparse regime where the number of edges is of the same order as the number of\nvertices. We propose a spectral method based on a generalization of the\nnon-backtracking Hashimoto matrix into hypergraphs. We analyze its performance\non a planted generative model and compare it with other spectral methods and\nwith Bayesian belief propagation (which was conjectured to be asymptotically\noptimal for this model). We conclude that the proposed spectral method detects\ncommunities whenever belief propagation does, while having the important\nadvantages to be simpler, entirely nonparametric, and to be able to learn the\nrule according to which the hyperedges were generated without prior\ninformation.\n", "  To assess the role of single-chain elasticity, non-affine strain fields and\npre-stressed reference states we present and discuss the results of numerical\nand analytical analyses of modified 8-chain Arruda-Boyce model for cross-linked\npolymer networks. This class of models has proved highly successful in modeling\nthe finite-strain response of flexible rubbers. We extend it to include the\neffects of spatial disorder and the associated non-affinity, and use it to\nassess the validity of replacing the constituent chain's nonlinear elastic\nresponse with equivalent linear, Hookean springs. Surprisingly, we find that\neven in the regime of linear response, the full polymer model gives very\ndifferent results from its linearized counterpart, even though none of the\nchains are stretched beyond their linear regime. We demonstrate that this\neffect is due to the fact that the polymer models are under considerable\npre-stress in their ground state. We show that pre-stress strongly suppresses\nnon-affinity in these unit cell models, resulting in a marked stiffening of the\nbulk response. The effects of pre-stress we discuss may explain why fully\naffine mechanical models, in many cases, predict the bulk mechanical response\nof disordered stiff polymer networks so well.\n", "  The central charge of the dimer model on the square lattice is still being\ndebated in the literature. In this paper, we provide evidence supporting the\nconsistency of a $c=-2$ description. Using Lieb's transfer matrix and its\ndescription in terms of the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ at $\\beta = 0$, we\nprovide a new solution of the dimer model in terms of the model of critical\ndense polymers on a tilted lattice and offer an understanding of the lattice\nintegrability of the dimer model. The dimer transfer matrix is analysed in the\nscaling limit and the result for $L_0-\\frac c{24}$ is expressed in terms of\nfermions. Higher Virasoro modes are likewise constructed as limits of elements\nof $TL_n$ and are found to yield a $c=-2$ realisation of the Virasoro algebra,\nfamiliar from fermionic $bc$ ghost systems. In this realisation, the dimer Fock\nspaces are shown to decompose, as Virasoro modules, into direct sums of\nFeigin-Fuchs modules, themselves exhibiting reducible yet indecomposable\nstructures. In the scaling limit, the eigenvalues of the lattice integrals of\nmotion are found to agree exactly with those of the $c=-2$ conformal integrals\nof motion. Consistent with the expression for $L_0-\\frac c{24}$ obtained from\nthe transfer matrix, we also construct higher Virasoro modes with $c=1$ and\nfind that the dimer Fock space is completely reducible under their action.\nHowever, the transfer matrix is found not to be a generating function for the\n$c=1$ integrals of motion. Although this indicates that Lieb's transfer matrix\ndescription is incompatible with the $c=1$ interpretation, it does not rule out\nthe existence of an alternative, $c=1$ compatible, transfer matrix description\nof the dimer model.\n", "  We completely characterize General Gauge Mediation (GGM) at the weak scale by\nsolving all IR constraints over the full parameter space. This is made possible\nthrough a combination of numerical and analytical methods, based on a set of\nalgebraic relations among the IR soft masses derived from the GGM boundary\nconditions in the UV. We show how tensions between just a few constraints\ndetermine the boundaries of the parameter space: electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB), the Higgs mass, slepton tachyons, and left-handed stop/sbottom\ntachyons. While these constraints allow the left-handed squarks to be\narbitrarily light, they place strong lower bounds on all of the right-handed\nsquarks. Meanwhile, light EW superpartners are generic throughout much of the\nparameter space. This is especially the case at lower messenger scales, where a\npositive threshold correction to $m_h$ coming from light Higgsinos and winos is\nessential in order to satisfy the Higgs mass constraint.\n", "  High frequency conductivity of hot electrons in an undoped single walled\nachiral carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under the influence of ac-dc driven fields is\nconsidered. We investigated semiclassically by solving the Boltzmann's\ntransport equation with and without the presence of the hot electrons source to\nderive the current densities. Plots of the normalized current density versus\nfrequency of ac-field reveal an increase in both the minimum and maximum peaks\nof normalized current density at lower frequencies as a result of a strong\nenough injection of hot electrons . The applied ac-field plays twofold role of\nsuppressing the space-charge instability in CNT and simultaneously pumping an\nenergy for lower frequency generation and amplification of THz radiations which\nhave enormous promising applications in very different areas of science and\ntechnology.\n", "  The trace of an arbitrary product of quantum operators with the density\noperator is rendered as a multiple phase space integral of the product of their\nWeyl symbols with the Wigner function. Interspersing the factors with various\nevolution operators, one obtains an evolving correlation. The kernel for the\nmatching multiple integral that evolves within the Weyl representation is\nidentified with the trace of a single compound unitary operator. Its evaluation\nwithin a semiclassical approximation then becomes a sum over the periodic\ntrajectories of the corresponding classical compound canonical transformation.\n  The search for periodic trajectories can be bypassed by an exactly equivalent\ninitial value scheme, which involves a change of integration variable and a\nreduced compound unitary operator. Restriction of all the operators to\nobservables with smooth non-oscillatory Weyl symbols reduces the evolving\ncorrelation to a single phase space integral. If each observable undergoes\nindependent Heisenberg evolution, the overall correlation evolves classically.\nOtherwise, the kernel acquires a nonclassical phase factor, though it still\ndepends on a purely classical compound trajectory: e.g. the fase for a double\nreturn of the quantum Loschmidt echo does not coincide with twice the phase for\na single echo.\n", "  Next-generation spectroscopic surveys will map the large-scale structure of\nthe observable universe, using emission line galaxies as tracers. While each\nsurvey will map the sky with a specific emission line, interloping emission\nlines can masquerade as the survey's intended emission line at different\nredshifts. Interloping lines from galaxies that are not removed can contaminate\nthe power spectrum measurement, mixing correlations from various redshifts and\ndiluting the true signal. We assess the potential for power spectrum\ncontamination, finding that an interloper fraction worse than 0.2% could bias\npower spectrum measurements for future surveys by more than 10% of statistical\nerrors, while also biasing power spectrum inferences. We also construct a\nformalism for predicting cosmological parameter bias, demonstrating that a\n0.15%-0.3% interloper fraction could bias the growth rate by more than 10% of\nthe error, which can affect constraints on gravity upcoming surveys. We use the\nCOSMOS Mock Catalog (CMC), with the emission lines re-scaled to better\nreproduce recent data, to predict potential interloper fractions for the Prime\nFocus Spectrograph (PFS) and the Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST).\nWe find that secondary line identification, or confirming galaxy redshifts by\nfinding correlated emission lines, can remove interlopers for PFS. For WFIRST,\nwe use the CMC to predict that the 0.2% target can be reached for the WFIRST\nH$\\alpha$ survey, but sensitive optical and near-infrared photometry will be\nrequired. For the WFIRST [OIII] survey, the predicted interloper fractions\nreach several percent and their effects will have to be estimated and removed\nstatistically (e.g. with deep training samples). (Abridged)\n", "  We present an accurate and fast framework for generating mock catalogues\nincluding low-mass halos, based on an implementation of the COmoving Lagrangian\nAcceleration (COLA) technique. Multiple realisations of mock catalogues are\ncrucial for analyses of large-scale structure, but conventional N-body\nsimulations are too computationally expensive for the production of thousands\nof realisations. We show that COLA simulations can produce accurate mock\ncatalogues with a moderate computation resource for low- to intermediate- mass\ngalaxies in $10^{12} M_\\odot$ haloes, both in real and redshift space. COLA\nsimulations have accurate peculiar velocities, without systematic errors in the\nvelocity power spectra for k < 0.15 h/Mpc, and with only 3-per-cent error for k\n< 0.2 h/Mpc. We use COLA with 10 time steps and a Halo Occupation Distribution\nto produce 600 mock galaxy catalogues of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. Our\nparallelized code for efficient generation of accurate halo catalogues is\npublicly available at github.com/junkoda/cola_halo.\n", "  Eukaryotes tune the transcriptional activity of their genome by altering the\nnucleosome core particle through multiple chemical processes. In particular,\nreplacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z\nhas been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; however,\nthe processes by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate\nthe molecular mechanisms of these variants with an extensive molecular dynamics\nstudy of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing\nstructures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops.\nSimulation results show that variant L1 loops play a pivotal role in\nstabilizing DNA binding to the octamer through direct interactions, core\nstructural rearrangements, and altered allosteric networks in the nucleosome.\nAll variants influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the\nlargest effect on energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis\nof allosteric networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take\nadvantage of stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics\nthroughout the complex. Furthermore, we show that post-translational\nmodifications are enriched at key locations in these networks. Taken together,\nthese results provide new insights into the relationship between the structure,\ndynamics, and function of the nucleosome core particle and chromatin fibers,\nand how they are influenced by chromatin remodelling factors.\n", "  Precision physics at future colliders requires highly granular calorimeters\nto support the Particle Flow Approach for event reconstruction. This article\npresents a review of about 10 - 15 years of R\\&D, mainly conducted within the\nCALICE collaboration, for this novel type of detector. The performance of large\nscale prototypes in beam tests validate the technical concept of particle flow\ncalorimeters. The comparison of test beam data with simulation, of e.g.\\\nhadronic showers, supports full detector studies and gives deeper insight into\nthe structure of hadronic cascades than was possible previously.\n", "  Recent measurements of the centrality and rapidity dependence of single\ninclusive jet production in p+Pb collisions at the LHC have revealed large and\nnon-trivial nuclear modification of the production cross section for this\nprocess. In this paper, we explore to what extent such nuclear modification can\nbe understood by the framework of standard cold nuclear matter effects, in\nparticular initial-state cold nuclear matter energy loss. We demonstrate\nquantitatively that theoretical calculations which include medium-induced\nradiative corrections can describe rather reasonably the attenuation of the jet\nproduction yields in the large transverse momentum region in d+Au collisions at\nRHIC and p+Pb collisions at the LHC for central to semi-central collisions. We\nfurther show that the observed scaling behavior of the nuclear modification\nfactor as a function of the total jet energy $p_T\\, {\\cosh} (y)$ for various\nrapidity intervals has a natural explanation in the picture of cold nuclear\nmatter energy loss. On the other hand, the observed enhancement in peripheral\ncollisions is not described in this picture and could have a different origin.\n", "  Numerous theoretical studies using various equation of state models have\nshown that quark matter may exist at the extreme densities in the cores of\nhigh-mass neutron stars. It has also been shown that a phase transition from\nhadronic matter to quark matter would result in an extended mixed phase region\nthat would segregate phases by net charge to minimize the total energy of the\nphase, leading to the formation of a crystalline lattice. The existence of\nquark matter in the core of a neutron star may have significant consequences\nfor its thermal evolution, which for thousands of years is facilitated\nprimarily by neutrino emission. In this work we investigate the effect a\ncrystalline quark-hadron mixed phase can have on the neutrino emissivity from\nthe core. To this end we calculate the equation of state using the relativistic\nmean-field approximation to model hadronic matter and a nonlocal extension of\nthe three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for quark matter. Next we determine\nthe extent of the quark-hadron mixed phase and its crystalline structure using\nthe Glendenning construction, allowing for the formation of spherical blob,\nrod, and slab rare phase geometries. Finally we calculate the neutrino\nemissivity due to electron-lattice interactions utilizing the formalism\ndeveloped for the analogous process in neutron star crusts. We find that the\ncontribution to the neutrino emissivity due to the presence of a crystalline\nquark-hadron mixed phase is substantial compared to other mechanisms at fairly\nlow temperatures ($\\lesssim 10^9$ K) and quark fractions ($\\lesssim 30\\%$), and\nthat contributions due to lattice vibrations are insignificant compared to\nstatic-lattice contributions.\n", "  Lattice data for the QCD equation of state and the baryon susceptibility near\nthe crossover phase transition (at zero baryon density) are used to determine\nthe input parameters of a 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton holographic\nmodel that provides a consistent holographic framework to study both\nequilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of a hot and {\\it baryon rich}\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We compare our holographic equation\nof state computed at nonzero baryon chemical potential, $\\mu_B$, with recent\nlattice calculations and find quantitative agreement for the pressure and the\nspeed of sound for $\\mu_B \\leq 400$ MeV. This holographic model is used to\nobtain holographic predictions for the temperature and $\\mu_B$ dependence of\nthe drag force and the Langevin diffusion coefficients associated with heavy\nquark jet propagation as well as the jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ and the\nshooting string energy loss of light quarks in the baryon dense plasma. We find\nthat the energy loss of heavy and light quarks generally displays a nontrivial,\nfast-varying behavior as a function of the temperature near the crossover.\nMoreover, energy loss is also found to generally increase due to nonzero baryon\ndensity effects even though this strongly coupled liquid cannot be described in\nterms of well defined quasiparticle excitations. Furthermore, to get a glimpse\nof how thermalization occurs in a hot and baryon dense QGP, we study how the\nlowest quasinormal mode of an external massless scalar disturbance in the bulk\nis affected by a nonzero baryon charge. We find that the equilibration time\nassociated with the lowest quasinormal mode decreases in a dense medium.\n", "  We present a new global fit of the 19-dimensional phenomenological Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM-19) that comply with all the latest\nexperimental results from dark matter indirect, direct and accelerator dark\nmatter searches. We show that the model provides a satisfactory explanation of\nthe excess of gamma-rays from the Galactic centre observed by the Fermi~Large\nArea Telescope, assuming that it is produced by the annihilation of neutralinos\nin the Milky Way halo. We identify two regions that pass all the constraints:\nthe first corresponds to neutralinos with a mass ~80-100 GeV annihilating into\nWW with a branching ratio of 95% ; the second to heavier neutralinos, with mass\n~180-200 GeV annihilating into t tbar with a branching ratio of 87%. We show\nthat neutralinos compatible with the Galactic centre GeV excess will soon be\nwithin the reach of LHC run-II -- notably through searches for charginos and\nneutralinos, squarks and light smuons -- and of Xenon1T, thanks to its\nunprecedented sensitivity to spin-dependent cross-section off neutrons.\n", "  In this work we consider how the appearance of gradients of pseudoscalar\ncondensates in dense systems may possibly influence the transport properties of\nphotons in such a medium as well as other thermodynamic characteristics. We\nadopt the hypothesis that in regions where the pseudoscalar density gradient is\nlarge the properties of photons and fermions are governed by the usual\nlagrangian extended with a Chern-Simons interaction for photons and a constant\naxial field for fermions. We find that these new pieces in the lagrangian\nproduce non-trivial reflection coefficients both for photons and fermions when\nentering or leaving a region where the pseudoscalar has a non-zero gradient. A\nvarying pseudoscalar density may also lead to instability of some fermion and\nboson modes and modify some properties of the Fermi sea. We speculate that some\nof these modifications could influence the cooling rate of stellar matter (for\ninstance in compact stars) and have other observable consequences. While\nquantitative results may depend on precise astrophysical details most of the\nconsequences are quite universal and consideration should be given to this\npossibility.\n", "  The CP-violating weak phase phi[s] of the Bs meson and the decay width\ndifference Delta Gamma[s] of the Bs light and heavy mass eigenstates are\nmeasured with the CMS detector at the LHC using a data sample of Bs to J/Psi\nphi(1020) to mu+mu-K+K- decays. The analysed data set corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected in pp collisions at\na centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. A total of 49,200 reconstructed Bs decays are\nused to extract the values of phi[s] and Delta Gamma[s] by performing a\ntime-dependent and flavour-tagged angular analysis of the mu+mu-K+K- final\nstate. The weak phase is measured to be phi[s] = -0.075 +/- 0.097 (stat) +/-\n0.031 (syst) rad, and the decay width difference is Delta Gamma[s] = 0.095 +/-\n0.013 (stat) +/- 0.007 (syst) inverse picoseconds.\n", "  We perform the leading logarithmic resummation of nonglobal logarithms for\nthe single-hemisphere jet mass distribution in $e^+e^-$ annihilation including\nthe finite-$N_c$ corrections. The result is compared with the previous\nall-order result in the large-$N_c$ limit as well as fixed-order perturbative\ncalculations.\n", "  We elucidate the relationship between Schr\\\"odinger-cat-like macroscopicity\nand geometric entanglement, and argue that these quantities are not\ninterchangeable. While both properties are lost due to decoherence, we show\nthat macroscopicity is rare in uniform and in so-called random physical\nensembles of pure quantum states, despite possibly large geometric\nentanglement. In contrast, permutation-symmetric pure states feature rather low\ngeometric entanglement and strong and robust macroscopicity.\n", "  The magnetic properties of materials based on two-dimensional\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) have been investigated by means of\nfirst-principles DFT calculations, namely Fe-intercalated bulk\nFe$_{1/4}$TaS$_2$ compounds as well as TMDC monolayers with deposited Fe films.\nChanging the structure and the composition of systems consisting of Fe\noverlayers on top of a TMDC monolayers resulted in considerable variations of\ntheir physical properties. For the considered systems the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\n(DM) interaction has been determined and used for the subsequent investigation\nof their magnetic structure using Monte Carlo simulations. Rather strong DM\ninteractions as well as large $D/J$ ratios have been obtained in some of these\nmaterials, which can lead to the formation of skyrmionic structures varying\nwith the strength of the applied external magnetic field.\n", "  We review the next generation global PDF sets: NNPDF3.0, MMHT14 and CT14. We\ndescribe the global datasets, particularly the new data from LHC Run 1, recent\ndevelopments in QCD theory and PDF methodology, improvements in combination and\ndelivery, and future prospects for parton determination at Run 2.\n", "  We consider two identical impurities immersed in a Fermi sea for a broad\nrange of masses and for both interacting and non-interacting impurities. The\ninteraction between the particles is described through attractive zero-range\npotentials and the problem is solved in momentum space. The two impurities can\nattach to a fermion from the sea and form three-body bound states. The energy\nof these states increase as function of the Fermi momentum $k_F$, leading to\nthree-body bound states below the Fermi energy. The fate of the states depends\nhighly on two- and three-body thresholds and we find evidence of medium-induced\nBorromean-like states in 2D. The corrections due to particle-hole fluctuations\nin the Fermi sea are considered in the three-body calculations and we show that\nin spite of the fact that they strongly affect both the two- and three-body\nsystems, the correction to the point at which the three-body states cease to\nexist is small.\n", "  We present a brief argument making the science case for an electron-ion\ncollider.\n", "  Compactifications with fluxes and branes motivate us to study various\nenumerative invariants of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper, we study\nnon-perturbative corrections depending on both open and closed string moduli\nfor a class of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds in general dimensions. Our analysis\nis based on the methods using relative cohomology and generalized\nhypergeometric system. For the simplest example of compact Calabi-Yau fivefold,\nwe explicitly derive the associated Picard-Fuchs differential equations and\ncompute the quantum corrections in terms of the open and closed flat\ncoordinates. Implications for a kind of open-closed duality are also discussed.\n", "  Launching of surface plasmons by swift electrons has long been utilized in\nelectron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) to investigate plasmonic properties of\nultrathin, or two-dimensional (2D), electron systems. However, its\nspatio-temporal process has never been revealed. This is because the impact of\nan electron will generate not only plasmons, but also photons, whose emission\ncannot be achieved at a single space-time point, as fundamentally determined\nfrom the uncertainty principle. Here, we propose that such a space-time\nlimitation also applies to surface plasmon generation in EELS experiment. On\nthe platform of graphene, we demonstrate within the framework of classical\nelectrodynamics that the launching of 2D plasmons by an electron's impact is\ndelayed after a hydrodynamic splashing-like process, which occurs during the\nplasmonic \"formation time\" when the electron traverses the \"formation zone.\"\nConsidering this newly revealed process, we show that previous estimates on the\nyields of graphene plasmons in EELS have been overestimated.\n", "  The dynamics of domain walls in ultrathin ferromagnetic strips with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy is studied from both numerical and analytical\nmicromagnetics. The influence of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction associated to a bi-layer strip arrangement has been considered,\ngiving rise to the formation of Dzyaloshinskii domain walls. Such walls possess\nunder equilibrium conditions an inner magnetization structure defined by a\ncertain orientation angle that make them to be considered as intermediate\nconfigurations between Bloch and N\\'eel walls. Two different dynamics are\nconsidered, a field-driven and a current-driven dynamics, in particular, the\none promoted by the spin torque due to the Spin-Hall effect. Results show an\ninherent asymmetry associated with the rotation of the domain wall\nmagnetization orientation before reaching the stationary regime, characterized\nby a constant terminal speed. For a certain initial DW magnetization\norientation at rest, the rotation determines whether the reorientation of the\nDW magnetization prior to reach stationary motion is smooth or abrupt. This\nasymmetry affects the DW motion that can even reverse for a short period of\ntime. Additionally, it is found that the terminal speed in the case of the\ncurrent-driven dynamics may depend on either the initial DW magnetization\norientation at rest or the sign of the longitudinally injected current.\n", "  Inspired by the problem of elastic wave scattering on wrinkled interfaces, we\nstudied the scattering of ballistic electrons on a wrinkled potential energy\nregion. The electron transmission coefficient depends on both wrinkle amplitude\nand periodicity, having different behaviors for positive and negative\nscattering potential energies. For scattering on potential barriers, minibands\nappear in electron transmission, as in superlattices, whereas for scattering on\nperiodic potential wells the transmission coefficient has a more complex form.\nBesides suggesting that tuning of electron transmission is possible by\nmodifying the scattering potential via voltages on wrinkled gate electrodes,\nour results emphasize the analogies between ballistic electrons and elastic\nwaves even in scattering problems on non-typical configurations.\n", "  Empirical Tight Binding (TB) methods are widely used in atomistic device\nsimulations. Existing TB methods to passivate dangling bonds fall into two\ncategories: 1) Method that explicitly includes passivation atoms is limited to\npassivation with atoms and small molecules only. 2) Method that implicitly\nincorporates passivation does not distinguish passivation atom types. This work\nintroduces an implicit passivation method that is applicable to any passivation\nscenario with appropriate parameters. This method is applied to a Si quantum\nwell and a Si ultra-thin body transistor oxidized with SiO2 in several\noxidation configurations. Comparison with ab-initio results and experiments\nverifies the presented method. Oxidation configurations that severely hamper\nthe transistor performance are identified. It is also shown that the commonly\nused implicit H atom passivation overestimates the transistor performance.\n", "  We present a computer simulation study of glassy and crystalline states using\nthe standard Lennard-Jones interaction potential that is truncated at a finite\ncut-off distance, as is typical of many computer simulations. We demonstrate\nthat the discontinuity at the cut-off distance in the first derivative of the\npotential (corresponding to the interparticle force) leads to the appearance of\ncut-off nonlinearities. These cut-off nonlinearities persist into the\nvery-low-temperature regime thereby affecting low-temperature thermal\nvibrations, which leads to a breakdown of the harmonic approximation for many\neigen modes, particularly for low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,\nwhile expansion nonlinearities which are due to higher order terms in the\nTaylor expansion of the interaction potential are usually ignored at low\ntemperatures and show up as the temperature increases, cut-off nonlinearities\ncan become most significant at the lowest temperatures. Anharmonic effects\nreadily show up in the elastic moduli which not only depend on the eigen\nfrequencies, but are crucially sensitive to the eigen vectors of the normal\nmodes. Whereas, those observables that rely mainly on static structural\ninformation or just the eigen frequencies, such as the vibrational density of\nstates, total potential energy, and specific heat, show negligible dependence\non the presence of the cut-off. Similar aspects of nonlinear behavior have\nrecently been reported in model granular materials, where the constituent\nparticles interact through finite-range, purely-repulsive potentials. These\nnonlinearities have been ascribed to the nature of the sudden cut-off at\ncontact in the force-law, thus we demonstrate that cut-off nonlinearities\nemerge as a general feature of ordered and disordered solid state systems\ninteracting through truncated potentials.\n", "  The microscopic nature of an insulating state in the vicinity of a\nsuperconducting state, in the presence of disorder, is a hotly debated\nquestion. While the simplest scenario proposes that Coulomb interactions\ndestroy the Cooper pairs at the transition, leading to localization of single\nelectrons, an alternate possibility supported by experimental observations\nsuggests that Cooper pairs instead directly localize. The question of the\nhomogeneity, granularity, or possibly glassiness of the material on the verge\nof this transition is intimately related to this fundamental issue. Here, by\ncombining macroscopic and nano-scale studies of superconducting ultrathin NbN\nfilms, we reveal nanoscopic electronic inhomogeneities that emerge when the\nfilm thickness is reduced. In addition, while thicker films display a purely\ntwo-dimensional behaviour in the superconducting fluctuations, we demonstrate a\nzero-dimensional regime for the thinner samples precisely on the scale of the\ninhomogeneities. Such behavior is somehow intermediate between the Fermi and\nBose insulator paradigms and calls for further investigation to understand the\nway Cooper pairs continuously evolve from a bound state of fermionic objects\ninto localized bosonic entities.\n", "  A variety of paper were drawn by lead pencil with the grade between 4H\nthrough 10B. Raman spectroscopy verified both G and D peaks on all the drawing\non PC print paper, PC photo paper, kent paper and paper for silver halide\nprint. After irradiation of scanning femtosecond laser, silver halide paper\ndrawn with 10B lead pencil remained surface flatness compared to the other\npapers. Raman spectroscopy on silver print paper showed a large G peak with\nless intensity of D peak. After irradiation of scanning femtosecond laser on\nsilver halide paper drawn by 10B lead pencil, Raman spectroscopy showed large G\npeak and less intensity of D peak together with 2D peak around 2,700 /cm\ncorresponding to the existence of multi graphene.\n", "  Amorphous tantala (a-Ta2O5) is an important technological material that has\nwide ranging applications in electronics, optics and the biomedical industry.\nIt is used as the high refractive index layers in the multi-layer dielectric\nmirror coatings in the latest generation of gravitational wave interferometers,\nas well as other precision interferometers. One of the current limitations in\nsensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is Brownian thermal noise that\narises from the tantala mirror coatings. Measurements have shown differences in\nmechanical loss of the mirror coatings, which is directly related to Brownian\nthermal noise, in response to thermal annealing. We utilise scanning electron\ndiffraction to perform Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) on Ion Beam\nSputtered (IBS) amorphous tantala coatings, definitively showing an increase in\nthe medium range order (MRO), as determined from the variance between the\ndiffraction patterns in the scan, due to thermal annealing at increasing\ntemperatures. Moreover, we employ Virtual Dark-Field Imaging (VDFi) to\nspatially resolve the FEM signal, enabling investigation of the persistence of\nthe fragments responsible for the medium range order, as well as the extent of\nthe ordering over nm length scales, and show ordered patches larger than 5 nm\nin the highest temperature annealed sample. These structural changes directly\ncorrelate with the observed changes in mechanical loss.\n", "  We have previously introduced a hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet\nquenching in heavy ion collisions that describes the production and\nfragmentation of jets at weak coupling, using PYTHIA, and describes the rate at\nwhich each parton in the jet shower loses energy as it propagates through the\nstrongly coupled plasma, dE/dx, using an expression computed holographically at\nstrong coupling. The model has a single free parameter that we fit to a single\nexperimental measurement. We then confront our model with experimental data on\nmany other jet observables, focusing here on boson-jet observables, finding\nthat it provides a good description of present jet data. Next, we provide the\npredictions of our hybrid model for many measurements to come, including those\nfor inclusive jet, dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables in heavy ion\ncollisions with energy $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ ATeV coming soon at the LHC. As the\nstatistical uncertainties on near-future measurements of photon-jet observables\nare expected to be much smaller than those in present data, with about an order\nof magnitude more photon-jet events expected, predictions for these observables\nare particularly important. We find that most of our pre- and post-dictions do\nnot depend sensitively on the form we choose for the rate of energy loss dE/dx\nof the partons in the shower. This gives our predictions considerable\nrobustness. To better discriminate between possible forms for the rate of\nenergy loss, though, we must turn to intrajet observables. Here, we focus on\nratios of fragmentation functions. We close with a suggestion for a particular\nratio, between the fragmentation functions of inclusive and associated jets\nwith the same kinematics in the same collisions, which is particularly\nsensitive to the x- and E-dependence of dE/dx, and hence may be used to learn\nwhich mechanism of parton energy loss best describes the quenching of jets.\n", "  We study finite temperature correlation functions and quasinormal modes in a\nstrongly coupled conformal field theory holographically dual to a small black\nhole in global Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Upon variation of the black hole\nradius, our results smoothly interpolate between known limits corresponding to\nlarge black holes and thermal AdS space. This implies that the quantities are\ncontinuous functions of energy density in the microcanonical ensemble, thus\nsmoothly connecting the deconfined and confined phases that are separated by a\nfirst order phase transition in the canonical description.\n", "  We have recently performed experiments to test the effectiveness of three\nion-clearing strategies in the Cornell high intensity photoinjector: DC\nclearing electrodes, bunch gaps, and beam shaking. The photoinjector reaches a\nnew regime of linac beam parameters where high CW beam currents lead to ion\ntrapping. Therefore ion mitigation strategies must be evaluated for this\nmachine and other similar future high current linacs. We have developed several\ntechniques to directly measure the residual trapped ions. Our two primary\nindicators of successful clearing are the amount of ion current removed by a DC\nclearing electrode, and the absence of bremsstrahlung radiation generated by\nbeam-ion interactions. Measurements were taken for an electron beam with an\nenergy of 5 MeV and CW beam currents in the range of 1-20 mA. Several\ntheoretical models have been developed to explain our data. Using them, we are\nable to estimate the clearing electrode voltage required for maximum ion\nclearing, the creation and clearing rates of the ions while employing bunch\ngaps, and the sinusoidal shaking frequency necessary for clearing via beam\nshaking. In all cases, we achieve a maximum ion clearing of at least 70 percent\nor higher, and in some cases our data is consistent with full ion clearing.\n", "  We develop a framework of calculating entanglement entropy for non-conformal\nfield theories with the use of the dilaton effective action. To illustrate it,\nwe locate a theory on a cylinder $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and compute\nentanglement entropy of a cap-like region perturbatively with respect to the\nmass for a free massive scalar field. A renormalized entanglement entropy (REE)\nis proposed to regularize the ultraviolet divergence on the cylinder. We find\nthat the REE decreases monotonically both in the small and large mass regions\nas the mass increases. We confirm all of these behaviors by the numerical\ncalculations, which further shows the monotonic decrease of the REE in the\nentire renormalization group flow.\n", "  We have developed the approach for analyzing of anisotropy of acoustooptic\nfigure of merit (AOFM) for lithium niobate crystals in the case of isotropic\nacoustooptic (AO) diffraction. The working relations for the effective\nelastooptic coefficients and the AOFM have been derived. We have found that,\nunder the conditions of isotropic AO diffraction, the maximum AOFM value for\nLiNbO3 is equal tp 11.62x10-15s3/kg. It is peculiar for the geometry of AO\ninteraction of the shear acoustic wave propagating in the YZ plane (the\nvelocity 3994 m/s) with the optical wave polarized in the same plane. We have\ndemonstrated that the maximum AOFM values are achieved mainly due to essential\nanisotropy and high values of the elastooptic coefficients of LiNbO3.\n", "  We describe two aspects of the physics of hybrid stars that have a sharp\ninterface between a core of quark matter and a mantle of nuclear matter.\n  Firstly, we analyze the mass-radius relation. We describe a generic \"Constant\nSpeed of Sound\" (CSS) parameterization of the quark matter equation of state\n(EoS), in which the speed of sound is independent of density. In terms of the\nthree parameters of the CSS EoS we obtain the phase diagram of possible forms\nof the hybrid star mass-radius relation, and we show how observational\nconstraints on the maximum mass and typical radius of neutron stars can be\nexpressed as constraints on the CSS parameters.\n  Secondly, we propose a mechanism for the damping of density oscillations,\nincluding r-modes, in hybrid stars with a sharp interface. The dissipation\narises from the periodic conversion between quark matter and nuclear matter\ninduced by the pressure oscillations in the star. We find the damping grows\nnonlinearly with the amplitude of the oscillation and is powerful enough to\nsaturate an r-mode at very low saturation amplitude, of order $10^{-10}$, which\nis compatible with currently-available observations of neutron star spin\nfrequencies and temperatures.\n", "  The first observation of about 2000 candidates, with a background\ncontamination below 3%, of the rare decay $K^{\\pm} \\to \\pi^{\\pm}\\pi^{0}e^+e^-$\nis reported by the NA48/2 experiment. The preliminary branching ratio in the\nfull kinematic region is obtained to be: ${\\cal B}(K^{\\pm} \\to\n\\pi^{\\pm}\\pi^{0}e^+e^-)=(4.06\\pm0.17)\\cdot10^{-6}$ by analyzing the data\ncollected in 2003. A sample of $4.687\\times 10^6$ $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\pm\\pi^0_D$,\ndecay candidates with a negligible background contamination collected in\n2003-04 is analyzed to search for the dark photon ($A'$) via the decay chain\n$K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\pm\\pi^0$, $\\pi^0\\to\\gamma A'$, $A'\\to e^+e^-$. No signal is\nobserved, and preliminary limits in the plane dark photon mixing parameter\n$\\varepsilon^2$ versus its mass $m_{A'}$ are reported.\n", "  We show that acoustic crystalline wave gives rise to an effect similar to\nthat of a gravitational wave to an electron gas. Applying this idea to a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime, this allows\nfor experimental study of its dynamical gravitational response. To study such\nresponse we generalize Haldane's geometrical description of fractional quantum\nHall states to situations where the external metric is time-dependent. We show\nthat such time-dependent metric (generated by acoustic or effective\ngravitational wave) couples to collective modes of the system, including a\nquadrapolar mode similar to graviton at long wave length, and magneto-roton at\nfinite wave length. Energies of these modes can be revealed in spectroscopic\nmeasurements. We argue that such gravitational probe provides a potentially\nhighly useful alternative probe of quantum Hall liquids, in addition to the\nusual electromagnetic response.\n", "  Collisions between particles suspended in a fluid play an important role in\nmany physical processes. As an example, collisions of microscopic water\ndroplets in clouds are a necessary step in the production of macroscopic\nraindrops. Collisions of dust grains are also conjectured to be important for\nplanet formation in the gas surrounding young stars, and also to play a role in\nthe dynamics of sand storms. In these processes, collisions are favoured by\nfast turbulent motions. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of\ncollisional aggregation due to turbulence. We discuss the role of fractal\nclustering of particles, and caustic singularities of their velocities. We also\ndiscuss limitations of the Smoluchowski equation for modelling these processes.\nThese advances lead to a semi-quantitative understanding on the influence of\nturbulence on collision rates, and point to deficiencies in the current\nunderstanding of rainfall and planet formation.\n", "  We study numerically nonuniform quantum turbulence of coflow in a square\nchannel by the vortex filament model. Coflow means that superfluid velocity\n$\\bm{v}_s$ and normal fluid velocity $\\bm{v}_n$ flow in the same direction.\nQuantum turbulence for thermal counterflow has been long studied theoretically\nand experimentally. In recent years, experiments of coflow are performed to\nobserve different features from thermal counterflow. By supposing that\n$\\bm{v}_s$ is uniform and $\\bm{v}_n$ takes the Hagen-Poiseiulle profile, our\nsimulation finds that quantized vortices are distributed inhomogeneously.\nVortices like to accumulate on the surface of a cylinder with $\\bm{v}_s \\simeq\n\\bm{v}_n$. Consequently, the vortex configuration becomes degenerate from\nthree-dimensional to two-dimensional.\n", "  Laser filamentation is responsible for the deposition of a significant part\nof the laser pulse energy in the propagation medium. We found that using\nterawatt laser pulses and relatively tight focusing conditions in air,\nresulting in a bundle of co-propagating multifilaments, more than 60 % of the\npulses energy is transferred to the medium, eventually degrading into heat.\nThis results in a strong hydrodynamic reaction of air with the generation of\nshock waves and associated underdense channels for each short-scale filament.\nIn the focal zone, where filaments are close to each other, these discrete\nchannels eventually merge to form a single cylindrical low-density tube over a\n$\\sim 1 \\mu\\mathrm{s}$ timescale. We measured the maximum lineic deposited\nenergy to be more than 1 J/m.\n", "  We provide a detailed analysis on the acoustic radiation force and torque\nexerted on a homogeneous viscoelastic particle in the long-wave limit (the\nparticle radius is much smaller than the incident wavelength) by an arbitrary\nwave. We assume that the particle behaves as a linear viscoelastic solid, which\nobeys the fractional Kelvin-Voigt model. Simple analytical expressions for the\nradiation force and torque are obtained considering the low- and high-frequency\napproximation in the viscoelastic model. The developed theory is used to\ndescribe the interaction of acoustic waves (traveling and standing plane waves,\nand zero- and first-order Bessel beams) with a low- and high-density\npolyethylene particle chosen as examples. Negative axial radiation force and\ntorque are predicted when the ratio of the longitudinal to shear relaxation\ntimes is smaller than a constant that depends on the speed of sound in the\nparticle. In addition, a full 3D tractor Bessel vortex beam acting on the\nhigh-density polyethylene is depicted. These predictions may enable new\npossibilities of particle handling in acoustophoretic techniques.\n", "  A new analytical model is developed for the prediction of noise from serrated\ntrailing-edges. The model generalizes Amiet's trailing-edge noise theory to\nsawtooth trailing-edges, resulting in an inhomogeneous partial differential\nequation. The equation is then solved by means of a Fourier expansion technique\ncombined with an iterative procedure. The solution is validated through\ncomparison with finite element method for a variety of serrations at different\nMach numbers. Results obtained using the new model predict noise reduction of\nup to 10 dB at 90 degree above the trailing-edge, which is more realistic than\npredictions based on Howe's model and also more consistent with experimental\nobservations. A thorough analytical and numerical analysis of the physical\nmechanism is carried out and suggests that the noise reduction due to serration\noriginates primarily from interference effects near the trailing-edge. A closer\ninspection of the proposed mathematical model has led to the development of two\ncriteria for the effectiveness of the trailing-edge serrations, consistent but\nmore general than those proposed by Howe. While experimental investigations\noften focus on noise reduction at ninety degrees above the trailing-edge, the\nnew analytical model shows that the destructive interference scattering effects\ndue to the serrations cause significant noise reduction at large polar angles,\nnear the leading edge. It has also been observed that serrations can\nsignificantly change the directivity characteristics of the aerofoil at high\nfrequencies and even lead to noise increase at high Mach numbers.\n", "  We extend Brill's positive mass theorem to a large class of asymptotically\nflat, maximal, $U(1)^2$-invariant initial data sets on simply connected four\ndimensional manifolds $\\Sigma$. Moreover, we extend the local mass angular\nmomenta inequality result Ref [1] for $U(1)^2$ invariant black holes to the\ncase with nonzero stress energy tensor with positive matter density and\nenergy-momentum current invariant under the above symmetries.\n", "  Quantum Chromodynamics is thought to be the relativistic quantum field theory\nthat describes the strong interaction of the Standard Model. This interaction\nproduces mesons but it is also able to generate quark-quark (diquark)\ncorrelations inside baryons. In this work, we employ a continuum approach to\nQCD based on Dyson-Schwinger equations to calculate the electromagnetic form\nfactors of the proton and analyze in a deeper way the consequences of having\nstrong diquark correlations. Comparison with the experimental data reveals that\nthe presence of strong diquark correlations within the proton is sufficient to\nunderstand empirical extractions of the flavour-separated form factors. The\nexplained reduction of the ratios $F_{1}^{d}/F_{1}^{u}$ and\n$F_{2}^{d}/F_{2}^{u}$ at high $Q^{2}$ in the quark-diquark picture are\nresponsible of the precocious scaling of the $F_{2}^{p}/F_{1}^{p}$ observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  Chirality is one of the key features governing the electronic properties of\nsingle- and bilayer graphene: the basics of this concept and its consequences\non transport are presented in this review. By breaking the inversion symmetry,\na band gap can be opened in the band structures of both systems at the K-point.\nThis leads to interesting consequences for the pseudospin and, therefore, for\nthe chirality. These consequences can be accessed by investigating the\nevolution of the Berry phase in such systems. Experimental observations of\nFabry-Perot interference in a dual-gated bilayer graphene device are finally\npresented and are used to illustrate the role played by the band gap on the\nevolution of the pseudospin. The presented results can be attributed to the\nbreaking of the chirality in the energy range close to the gap.\n", "  We study the $^{11}\\mathrm{Li}$ and $^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ nuclei at leading order\n(LO) in halo effective field theory (Halo EFT). Using the value of the\n$^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ rms matter radius deduced in Ref. [1] as an input in a LO\ncalculation, we simultaneously constrained the values of the two-neutron (2$n$)\nseparation energy of $^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ and the virtual-state energy of the\n$^{20}\\mathrm{C}-$neutron system (hereafter denoted $^{21}$C). The 1$-\\sigma$\nuncertainty of the input rms matter radius datum, along with the theory error\nestimated from the anticipated size of the higher-order terms in the Halo EFT\nexpansion, gave an upper bound of about 100 keV for the 2$n$ separation energy.\nWe also study the electric dipole excitation of 2$n$ halo nuclei to a continuum\nstate of two neutrons and the core at LO in Halo EFT. We first compare our\nresults with the $^{11}\\mathrm{Li}$ data from a Coulomb dissociation experiment\nand obtain good agreement within the theoretical uncertainty of a LO\ncalculation. We then obtain the low-energy spectrum of $B(E1)$ of this\ntransition at several different values of the 2$n$ separation energy of\n$^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ and the virtual-state energy of $^{21}\\mathrm{C}$. Our\npredictions can be compared to the outcome of an ongoing experiment on the\nCoulomb dissociation of $^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ to obtain tighter constraints on the\ntwo- and three-body energies in the $^{22}\\mathrm{C}$ system.\n", "  Game theory provides a general mathematical background to study the effect of\npair interactions and evolutionary rules on the macroscopic behavior of\nmulti-player games where players with a finite number of strategies may\nrepresent a wide scale of biological objects, human individuals, or even their\nassociations. In these systems the interactions are characterized by matrices\nthat can be decomposed into elementary matrices (games) and classified into\nfour types. The concept of decomposition helps the identification of potential\ngames and also the evaluation of the potential that plays a crucial role in the\ndetermination of the preferred Nash equilibrium, and defines the Boltzmann\ndistribution towards which these systems evolve for suitable types of dynamical\nrules. This survey draws parallel between the potential games and the kinetic\nIsing type models which are investigated for a wide scale of connectivity\nstructures. We discuss briefly the applicability of the tools and concepts of\nstatistical physics and thermodynamics. Additionally the general features of\nordering phenomena, phase transitions and slow relaxations are outlined and\napplied to evolutionary games. The discussion extends to games with three or\nmore strategies. Finally we discuss what happens when the system is weakly\ndriven out of the \"equilibrium state\" by switching on non-potential components\nrepresenting games of cyclic dominance.\n", "  We review our work on the statistical uncertainty analysis of the NN force.\nThis is based on the Granada-2013 database where a statistically meaningful\npartial wave analysis comprising a total of 6713 np and pp published scattering\ndata from 1950 till 2013 below pion production threshold has been made. We\nstress the necessary conditions required for a correct and self-consistent\nstatistical interpretation of the discrepancies between theory and experiment\nwhich enable a subsequent statistical error propagation and correlation\nanalysis\n", "  We revisit, both numerically and analytically, the finite-time blowup of the\ninfinite-energy solution of 3D Euler equations of stagnation-point-type\nintroduced by Gibbon et al. (1999). By employing the method of mapping to\nregular systems, presented in Bustamante (2011) and extended to the\nsymmetry-plane case by Mulungye et al. (2015), we establish a curious property\nof this solution that was not observed in early studies: before but near\nsingularity time, the blowup goes from a fast transient to a slower regime that\nis well resolved spectrally, even at mid-resolutions of $512^2.$ This late-time\nregime has an atypical spectrum: it is Gaussian rather than exponential in the\nwavenumbers. The analyticity-strip width decays to zero in a finite time,\nalbeit so slowly that it remains well above the collocation-point scale for all\nsimulation times $t < T^* - 10^{-9000}$, where $T^*$ is the singularity time.\nReaching such a proximity to singularity time is not possible in the original\ntemporal variable, because floating point double precision ($\\approx 10^{-16}$)\ncreates a `machine-epsilon' barrier. Due to this limitation on the\n\\emph{original} independent variable, the mapped variables now provide an\nimproved assessment of the relevant blowup quantities, crucially with\nacceptable accuracy at an unprecedented closeness to the singularity time:\n$T^*- t \\approx 10^{-140}.$\n", "  We present simple lattice realizations of symmetry-protected topological\n(SPT) phases with $q$-form global symmetries where charged excitations have $q$\nspatial dimensions. Specifically, we construct $d$ space-dimensional models\nsupported on a $(d+1)$-colorable graph by using a family of unitary phase\ngates, known as multi-qubit control-$Z$ gates in quantum information community.\nIn our construction, charged excitations of different dimensionality may\ncoexist and form a short-range entangled state which is protected by symmetry\noperators of different dimensionality. Non-triviality of proposed models, in a\nsense of quantum circuit complexity, is confirmed by studying protected\nboundary modes, gauged models and corresponding gapped domain walls. We also\ncomment on applications of our construction to quantum error-correcting codes,\nand discuss corresponding fault-tolerant logical gates.\n", "  Observations of tropical convection from precipitation radar and the\nconcurring large-scale atmospheric state at two locations (Darwin and\nKwajalein) are used to establish effective stochastic models to parameterise\nsubgrid-scale tropical convective activity. Two approaches are presented which\nrely on the assumption that tropical convection induces a stationary\nequilibrium distribution. In the first approach we parameterise convection\nvariables such as convective area fraction as an instantaneous random\nrealisation conditioned on the large-scale vertical velocities according to a\nprobability density function estimated from the observations. In the second\napproach convection variables are generated in a Markov process conditioned on\nthe large-scale vertical velocity, allowing for non-trivial temporal\ncorrelations. Despite the different prevalent atmospheric and oceanic regimes\nat the two locations, with Kwajalein being exposed to a purely oceanic weather\nregime and Darwin exhibiting land-sea interaction, we establish that the\nempirical measure for the convective variables conditioned on large-scale\nmid-level vertical velocities for the two locations are close. This allows us\nto train the stochastic models at one location and then generate time series of\nconvective activity at the other location. The proposed stochastic\nsubgrid-scale models adequately reproduce the statistics of the observed\nconvective variables and we discuss how they may be used in future\nscale-independent mass-flux convection parameterisations.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon within a hybrid\nconstituent-quark model that comprises, in addition to the $3q$ valence\ncomponent, also a $3q$+$\\pi$ non-valence component. To this aim we employ a\nPoincar\\'e-invariant multichannel formulation based on the point-form of\nrelativistic quantum mechanics. With a simple 3-quark wave function for the\nbare nucleon, i.e. the $3q$-component, we obtain reasonable results for the\nnucleon form factors and predict the meson-cloud contribution to be significant\nonly below $Q^2\\lesssim 0.5$\\,GeV$^2$ amounting to about 10\\% for\n$Q^2\\rightarrow 0$, in accordance with the findings of other authors.\n", "  We present a design and characterization of optically transparent electrodes\nsuitable for atomic and molecular physics experiments where high optical access\nis required. The electrodes can be operated in air at standard atmospheric\npressure and do not suffer electrical breakdown even for electric fields far\nexceeding the dielectric breakdown of air. This is achieved by putting an ITO\ncoated dielectric substrate inside a stack of dielectric substrates, which\nprevents ion avalanche resulting from Townsend discharge. With this design, we\nobserve no arcing for fields of up to 120 kV/cm. Using these plates, we\ndirectly verify the production of electric fields up to 18~kV/cm inside a\nquartz vacuum cell by a spectroscopic measurement of the dc Stark shift of the\n$5^2S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 5^2P_{3/2}$ transition for a cloud of laser cooled\nRubidium atoms. We also report on the shielding of the electric field and\nresidual electric fields that persist within the vacuum cell once the\nelectrodes are discharged. In addition, we discuss observed atom loss that\nresults from the motion of free charges within the vacuum. The observed\nasymmetry of these phenomena on the bias of the electrodes suggests that field\nemission of electrons within the vacuum is primarily responsible for these\neffects and may indicate a way of mitigating them.\n", "  The CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab has provided the dominant part of all\navailable worldwide data on exclusive meson electroproduction off protons in\nthe resonance region. New results on the $\\gamma_{v}pN^*$ transition amplitudes\n(electrocouplings) are available from analyses of the CLAS data and will be\npresented. Their impact on understanding of hadron structure will be discussed\nemphasizing the credible access to the dressed quark mass function that has\nbeen achieved for the first time by a combined analysis of the experimental\nresults on the electromagnetic nucleon elastic and $N \\rightarrow N^*$\ntransition form factors. We will also discuss further convincing evidences for\na new baryon state $N^{\\, '}(1720)3/2^+$ found in a combined analysis of\ncharged double pion photo- and electroproduction cross sections off the\nprotons.\n", "  We study a cogenesis mechanism in which the observed baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse and the dark matter abundance can be produced simultaneously at low\nreheating temperature without violating baryon number in the fundamental\nvertex. In particular, we consider a model which could be realized in the\ncontext of type IIB large volume string compactifications. The matter\nsuperfields in this model include additional pairs of color triplet and singlet\nsuperfields in addition to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)\nsuperfields. Assuming that the mass of the additional singlet fermions is\nO(GeV) and color triplet fermions is O(TeV), we show that the modulus\ndominantly decays into the additional color triplet superfields. After soft\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, the lightest eigenstate of scalar component of\ncolor triplet superfield further decays into fermionic component of singlet\nsuperfield and quarks without violating baryon number. Assuming R-parity\nconservation, it follows that the singlet superfield will not further decay\ninto the SM particles and therefore it can be considered as a stable asymmetric\ndark matter (ADM) component. We find that the decay of the lightest eigenstate\nof scalar component of color triplet superfield gives the observed baryon\nasymmetry in the visible sector, an asymmetric dark matter component with the\nright abundance and naturally explains cosmic coincidence.\n", "  The distribution of the magnitudes of seismic events is generally assumed to\nbe independent on past seismicity. However, by considering events in causal\nrelation, for example mother-daughter, it seems natural to assume that the\nmagnitude of a daughter event is conditionally dependent on the one of the\ncorresponding mother event. In order to find experimental evidence supporting\nthis hypothesis, we analyze different catalogs, both real and simulated, in two\ndifferent ways. From each catalog, we obtain the law of triggered events'\nmagnitude by kernel density. The results obtained show that the distribution\ndensity of triggered events' magnitude varies with the magnitude of their\ncorresponding mother events. As the intuition suggests, an increase of mother\nevents' magnitude induces an increase of the probability of having \"high\"\nvalues of triggered events' magnitude. In addition, we see a statistically\nsignificant increasing linear dependence of the magnitude means.\n", "  We discuss the 3-window modeling of cold, dense QCD matter equations of state\nat density relevant to neutron star properties. At low baryon density, n_B < ~\n2n_s (n_s: nuclear saturation density), we utilize purely hadronic equations of\nstate that are constrained by empirical observations at density n_B ~ n_s and\nneutron star radii. At high density, n_B > ~ 5n_s, we use the percolated quark\nmatter equations of state which must be very stiff to pass the two-solar mass\nconstraints. The intermediate domain at 2 < n_B/n_s < 5 is described as neither\npurely hadronic nor percolated quark matter, and the equations of state are\ninferred by interpolating hadronic and percolated quark matter equations of\nstate. Possible forms of the interpolation are severely restricted by the\ncondition on the (square of) speed of sound, 0 < c_s^2 < 1. The characteristics\nof the 3-window equation of state are compared with those of conventional\nhybrid and self-bound quark matters. Using a schematic quark model for the\npercolated domain, it is argued that the two-solar mass constraint requires the\nmodel parameters to be as large as their vacuum values, indicating that the\ngluon dynamics remains strongly non-perturbative to n_B ~ 10n_s. The hyperon\npuzzle is also briefly discussed in light of quark descriptions.\n", "  Astro-H will be the first X-ray observatory to employ a high-resolution\nmicrocalorimeter, capable of measuring the shift and width of individual\nspectral lines to the precision necessary for estimating the velocity of the\ndiffuse plasma in galaxy clusters. This new capability is expected to bring\nsignificant progress in understanding the dynamics, and therefore the physics,\nof the intracluster medium. However, because this plasma is optically thin,\nprojection effects will be an important complicating factor in interpreting\nfuture Astro-H measurements. To study these effects in detail, we performed an\nanalysis of the velocity field from simulations of a galaxy cluster\nexperiencing gas sloshing, and generated synthetic X-ray spectra, convolved\nwith model Astro-H Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) responses. We find that the\nsloshing motions produce velocity signatures that will be observable by Astro-H\nin nearby clusters: the shifting of the line centroid produced by the\nfast-moving cold gas underneath the front surface, and line broadening produced\nby the smooth variation of this motion along the line of sight. The line shapes\narising from inviscid or strongly viscous simulations are very similar,\nindicating that placing constraints on the gas viscosity from these\nmeasurements will be difficult. Our spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that,\nfor adequate exposures, Astro-H will be able to recover the first two moments\nof the velocity distribution of these motions accurately, and in some cases\nmultiple velocity components may be discerned. The simulations also confirm the\nimportance of accurate treatment of PSF scattering in the interpretation of\nAstro-H/SXS spectra of cluster plasmas.\n", "  One well-known argument about one dimensional(1D) system is that 1D phase\ntransition at finite temperature cannot exist, despite this concept depends on\nconditions such as range of interaction, external fields and periodicity.\nTherefore 1D systems usually have random fluctuations with intrinsic domain\nwalls arising which naturally bring disorder during transition. Herein we\nintroduce a real 1D system in which artificially created defects can induce a\nwell-defined 1D phase transition. The dynamics of structural reconstructions at\ngraphene zigzag edges are examined by in situ aberration corrected transmission\nelectron microscopy (ACTEM). Combined with an in-depth analysis by ab-initio\nsimulations and quantum chemical molecular dynamics (QM/MD), the complete\ndefect induced 1D phase transition dynamics at graphene zigzag edge is clearly\ndemonstrated and understood on the atomic scale. Further, following this phase\ntransition scheme, graphene nanoribbons (GNR) with different edge symmetries\ncan be fabricated, and according to our electronic structure and quantum\ntransport calculations, a metal-insulator-semiconductor transition for\nultrathin GNRs is proposed.\n", "  The identification of coherent structures from experimental or numerical data\nis an essential task when conducting research in fluid dynamics. This typically\ninvolves the construction of an empirical mode base that appropriately captures\nthe dominant flow structures. The most prominent candidates are the\nenergy-ranked proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the frequency ranked\nFourier decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, these\nmethods fail when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at\nmultiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deficit of these\n\"rigid\" approaches, we propose a new method termed Spectral Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to\nspatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional\ntemporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at\nmultiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from\nthe energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by\nchanging a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from\nphenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justified\nfrom dynamical system theory. The new method is further applied to three sets\nof PIV measurements of flows from very different engineering problems. We\nconsider the flow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with\na Gurney flap, and the flow field of the sweeping jet behind a fluidic\noscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the\nrelevant coherent structures to single modes. The SPOD, however, achieves a\nproper separation of spatially and temporally coherent structures, which are\neither hidden in stochastic turbulent fluctuations or spread over a wide\nfrequency range.\n", "  We compute the one-loop renormalization group equations for Standard Model\nHiggs inflation. The calculation is done in the Einstein frame, using a\ncovariant formalism for the multi-field system. All counterterms, and thus the\nbetafunctions, can be extracted from the radiative corrections to the two-point\nfunctions; the calculation of higher n-point functions then serves as a\nconsistency check of the approach. We find that the theory is renormalizable in\nthe effective field theory sense in the small, mid and large field regime. In\nthe large field regime our results differ slightly from those found in the\nliterature, due to a different treatment of the Goldstone bosons.\n", "  This letter is concerned with the analysis of the six-vertex model with\ndomain-wall boundaries in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs). The\nmodel's partition function is shown to obey a system of PDEs resembling the\ncelebrated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. The analysis of our PDEs naturally\nproduces a family of novel determinant representations for the model's\npartition function.\n", "  Studying of the relativistic three-body bound state in a three-dimensional\n(3D) approach is a necessary first step in a process to eventually perform\nscattering calculations at GeV energies, where partial-wave expansions are not\nuseful. To this aim we recently studied relativistic effects in the binding\nenergy and for the first time, obtained the relativistic 3B wave function\n\\cite{Hadizadeh_PRC90}. The relativistic Faddeev integral equations for the\nbound state are formulated in terms of momentum vectors, and relativistic\ninvariance is incorporated within the framework of Poincar\\'e invariant quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  We study high efficiency, multi-terawatt peak power, few angstrom wavelength,\nX-ray Free Electron Lasers (X-ray FELs). To obtain these characteristics we\nconsider an optimized undulator design: superconducting, helical, with short\nperiod and built-in strong focusing. This design reduces the length of the\nbreaks between modules, decreasing diffraction effects, and allows using a\nstronger transverse electron focusing. Both effects reduce the gain length and\nthe overall undulator length. The peak power and efficiency depend on the\ntransverse electron beam distribution and on time dependent effects, like\nsynchrotron sideband growth. The last effect is identified as the main cause\nfor reduction of electron beam microbunching and FEL peak power. We show that\nthe optimal functional form for the undulator magnetic field tapering profile,\nyielding the maximum output power, depends significantly on these effects. The\noutput power achieved when neglecting time dependent effects for an LCLS-like\nX-ray FEL with a 100 m long tapered undulator is 7.3 TW, a 14 $\\%$ electron\nbeam energy extraction efficiency. When these effects are included the highest\npeak power is achieved reducing the tapering rate, thus minimizing the\nreduction in electron micro-bunching due to synchrotron sideband growth. The\nmaximum efficiency obtained for this case is 9 $\\%$, corresponding to 4.7 TW\npeak radiation power. Possible methods to suppress the synchrotron sidebands,\nand further enhance the FEL peak power, up to about 6 TW by increasing the seed\npower, are discussed.\n", "  Bulk properties of cold and hot neutron stars (NSs) are studied on the basis\nof the hadron-quark crossover picture where a smooth transition from the\nhadronic phase to the quark phase takes place at finite baryon density. By\nusing a phenomenological equation of state (EOS) \"CRover\" which interpolates\nthe two phases at around 3 times the nuclear matter density, it is found that\nthe cold NSs with the gravitational mass larger than 2-solarmass can be\nsustained. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the first-order\nhadron-quark transition. The radii of the cold NSs with the CRover EOS are in\nthe narrow range which is insensitive to the NS masses. Due to the stiffening\nof the EOS induced by the hadron-quark crossover, the central density of the\nNSs is at most 4 times the nuclear matter density and the hyperon-mixing barely\noccurs inside the NS core. This constitutes a solution of the long-standing\nhyperon puzzle. The effect of color superconductivity (CSC) on the NS\nstructures is also examined with the hadron-quark crossover. For the typical\nstrength of the diquark attraction, a slight softening of the EOS due to\ntwo-flavor CSC (2SC) takes place and the maximum mass is reduced by about\n0.2-solarmass.\n  The CRover EOS is generalized to the supernova matter at finite temperature\nto describe the hot NSs at birth. The hadron-quark crossover is found to\ndecrease the central temperature of the hot NSs under isentropic condition. The\ngravitational energy release and the spin-up rate during the contraction from\nthe hot NS to the cold NS are also estimated.\n", "  We discuss the link between the chiral symmetry of QCD and the numerical\nresults of the light-front quark model, analyzing both the twist-2 and twist-3\ndistribution amplitudes of a pion. In particular, we exhibit that the pion\ntwist-3 distribution amplitude can flip the sign of curvature as the cutoff\nscale for the transverse momentum gets lower than a typical scale of around 1\nGeV.\n", "  Transition metal oxides, in particular, 3d or 4d perovskites have provided\ndiverse emergent physics that originates from the coupling of various degrees\nof freedom such as spin, lattice, charge, orbital, and also disorder. 5d\nperovskites form a distinct class because they have strong spin-orbit coupling\nthat introduces to the system an additional energy scale that is comparable to\nbandwidth and Coulomb correlation. Consequent new physics includes novel Jeff =\n1/2 Mott insulators, metal-insulator transitions, spin liquids, and topological\ninsulators. After highlighting some of the phenomena appearing in\nRuddlesden-Popper iridate series Srn+1IrnO3n+1, we focus on the transport\nproperties of perovskite SrIrO3. Using epitaxial thin films on various\nsubstrates, we demonstrate that metal-insulator transitions can be induced in\nperovskite SrIrO3 by reducing its thickness or by imposing compressive strain.\nThe metal-insulator transition driven by thickness reduction is due to\ndisorder, but the metal-insulator transition driven by compressive strain is\naccompanied by peculiar non-Fermi liquid behaviors, possibly due to the\ndelicate interplay between correlation, disorder, and spin-orbit coupling. We\nexamine various theoretical frameworks to understand the non-Fermi liquid\nphysics and metal-insulator transition that occurs in SrIrO3 and offer the\nMott-Anderson-Griffiths scenario as a possible solution.\n", "  In this review article, we argue that our current understanding of the\nthermodynamic properties of cold QCD matter, originating from first principles\ncalculations at high and low densities, can be used to efficiently constrain\nthe macroscopic properties of neutron stars. In particular, we demonstrate that\ncombining state-of-the-art results from Chiral Effective Theory and\nperturbative QCD with the current bounds on neutron star masses, the Equation\nof State of neutron star matter can be obtained to an accuracy better than 30%\nat all densities.\n", "  The past decade has provided a much clearer picture of the structure of\nhigh-momentum components in nucleons, associated with hard, short-distance\ninteractions between pairs of nucleons. Recent Jefferson Lab data on light\nnuclei suggest a connection between these so-called 'short-range correlations'\nand the modification of the quark structure of nucleons in the nuclear\nenvironment. In light of this discovery that the detailed nuclear structure is\nimportant in describing the nuclear quark distributions, we examine the\npotential impact of the isospin-dependent structure of nuclei to see at what\nlevel this might yield flavor-dependent effects in nuclear quark distributions.\n", "  We analyse various flavour changing processes like $t\\to hu,hc$, $h\\to \\tau\ne,\\tau\\mu$ as well as hadronic decays $h\\to bs,bd$, in the framework of a class\nof two Higgs doublet models where there are flavour changing neutral scalar\ncurrents at tree level. These models have the remarkable feature of having\nthese flavour-violating couplings entirely determined by the CKM and PMNS\nmatrices as well as $\\tan\\beta$. The flavour structure of these scalar currents\nresults from a symmetry of the Lagrangian and therefore it is natural and\nstable under the renormalization group. We show that in some of the models the\nrates of the above flavour changing processes can reach the discovery level at\nthe LHC at 13 TeV even taking into account the stringent bounds on low energy\nprocesses, in particular $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$.\n", "  Remnants of neutron-star mergers are essentially massive, hot, differentially\nrotating neutron stars, which are initially strongly oscillating. They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different\nmechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated\nanalytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for\ntemplate-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational\nconsequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic\nand quark stars. We find that this scenario leaves a distinctive imprint on the\npostmerger gravitational-wave signal. In particular, a strong discontinuity in\nthe dominant postmerger frequency as function of the total mass will be a\nstrong indication for two families of compact stars. (abridged)\n", "  The simultaneous presence of seemingly incompatible properties of solids\noften provides a unique opportunity to address questions of fundamental and\npractical importance. The coexistence of ferroelectric and topological orders\nis one such example. Ferroelectrics, which have a spontaneous macroscopic\npolarization switchable by an applied electric field, usually are\nsemiconductors with a well-developed wide band gap with a few exceptions. On\nthe other hand, time-reversal symmetric $Z_2$ topological insulators (TI),\ncharacterized by robust metallic surface states protected by the topology of\nthe bulk, usually are narrow-gap semiconductors ($< 0.7$ eV) which allow band\ninversion induced by the spin-orbit interaction. To date, a ferroelectric\ntopological insulator (FETI) has remained elusive, owing to the seemingly\ncontradictory characters of the ferroelectric and topological orders. Here, we\nreport that the FETI can be realized in halide perovskite CsPbI$_3$ under\nstrain. Our first-principles study reveals that a non-centrosymmetric\nferroelectric structure of CsPbI$_3$ is energetically favored under a wide\nrange of pressures, while maintaining its topological order. The proposed FETI\nis characterized by switchable polar surfaces with spin-momentum locked Dirac\ncones, which allows for electric-field control of topological surface states\n(TSSs) and the surface spin current. Our demonstration of a FETI in a feasible\nmaterial opens doors for future studies combining ferroelectric and topological\norders, and offers a new paradigm for diverse applications in electronics,\nspintronics, and quantum information.\n", "  Holes in cubic semiconductors have effective spin 3/2 and very strong spin\norbit interaction. Due to these factors properties of hole bound states are\nhighly unusual. We consider a single hole bound by a spherically symmetric\npotential, this can be an acceptor or a spherically symmetric quantum dot.\nLinear response to an external magnetic field is characterized by the bound\nstate Lande g-factor. We calculate analytically g-factors of all bound states.\n", "  A complete analytical description of the dynamics of current and field driven\ntransverse domain walls under the influence of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya\ninteraction using the $\\phi - q$ model will be given. Five different scenarios\nwill be observed where the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya vector is either parallel or\nperpendicular to the easy axis anisotropy of the system and a direct reversal\nrespectively precessional motion will be assumed.\n", "  It has been shown that interband mixing of gradients of two order parameters\n(drag effect) in an isotropic bulk two-band superconductor plays important role\n- such a quantity of the intergradients coupling exists that the two-band\nsuperconductor is characterized with a single coherence length and a single\nGinzburg-Landau (GL) parameter. Other quantities or neglecting of the drag\neffect lead to existence of two coherence lengths and dynamical instability due\nto violation of the phase relations between the order parameters. Thus\nso-called type-1.5 superconductors are impossible. An approximate method for\nsolving of set of GL equations for a multi-band superconductor has been\ndeveloped: using the result about the drag effect it has been shown that the\nfree-energy functional for a multi-band superconductor can be reduced to the GL\nfunctional for an effective single-band superconductor.\n", "  Theoretical prediction of phonon transport in modern semiconductor\nnanodevices requires atomic resolution of device features and quantum transport\nmodels covering coherent and incoherent effects. The nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction method (NEGF) is known to serve this purpose very well, but is\nnumerically very expensive. This work extends the very efficient B\\\"uttiker\nprobe concept to phonon NEGF and discusses all implications of this method.\nB\\\"uttiker probe parameters are presented that reproduce within NEGF\nexperimental phonon conductances of Si and Ge between 10K and 1000K. Results of\nthis method in SiGe heterojunctions illustrate the impact of interface\nrelaxation on the device heat conductance and the importance of inelastic\nscattering for the phonon distribution.\n", "  Quantum teleportation, which depends on entangled states, is a fascinating\nsubject and an important branch of quantum information processing. The present\nwork reports the use of a dipolar spin thermal system as a quantum channel to\nperform quantum teleportation. Non-locality, tested by violation of Bell's\ninequality and thermal entanglement, measured by negativity, unquestionably\nshow that even entangled states that do not violate Bell's inequality can be\nuseful for teleportation.\n", "  We present a new zoom-in hydrodynamical simulation, \"Erisbh\", which follows\nthe cosmological evolution and feedback effects of a supermassive black hole at\nthe center of a Milky Way-type galaxy. ErisBH shares the same initial\nconditions, resolution, recipes of gas cooling, star formation and feedback, as\nthe close Milky Way-analog \"Eris\", but it also includes prescriptions for the\nformation, growth and feedback of supermassive black holes. We find that the\ngalaxy's central black hole grows mainly through mergers with other black holes\ncoming from infalling satellite galaxies. The growth by gas accretion is\nminimal because very little gas reaches the sub-kiloparsec scales. The final\nblack hole is, at z=0, about 2.6 million solar masses and it sits closely to\nthe position of SgrA* on the MBH-MBulge and MBH-sigma planes, in a location\nconsistent with what observed for pseudobulges. Given the limited growth due to\ngas accretion, we argue that the mass of the central black hole should be above\n10^5 solar masses already at z~8. The effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy\nis limited to the very central few hundreds of parsecs. Despite being weak, AGN\nfeedback seems to be responsible for the limited growth of the central bulge\nwith respect to the original Eris, which results in a significantly flatter\nrotation curve in the inner few kiloparsecs. Moreover, the disk of ErisBH is\nmore prone to instabilities, as its bulge is smaller and its disk larger then\nEris. As a result, the disk of ErisBH undergoes a stronger dynamical evolution\nrelative to Eris and around z=0.3 a weak bar grows into a strong bar of a few\ndisk scale lengths in size. The bar triggers a burst of star formation in the\ninner few hundred parsecs, provides a modest amount of new fuel to the central\nblack hole, and causes the bulge of ErisBH to have, by z=0, a box/peanut\nmorphology.(Abridged)\n", "  The present understanding of nuclear electromagnetic properties including\nelectromagnetic moments, form factors and transitions in nuclei with A $\\le$ 10\nis reviewed. Emphasis is on calculations based on nuclear Hamiltonians that\ninclude two- and three-nucleon realistic potentials, along with one- and\ntwo-body electromagnetic currents derived from a chiral effective field theory\nwith pions and nucleons.\n", "  The hexagonal polygon model arises in a natural way via a transformation of\nthe 1-2 model on the hexagonal lattice, and it is related to the high\ntemperature expansion of the Ising model. There are three types of edge, and\nthree corresponding parameters $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma>0$. By studying the\nlong-range order of a certain two-edge correlation function, it is shown that\nthe parameter space $(0,\\infty)^3$ may be divided into subcritical and\nsupercritical regions, separated by critical surfaces satisfying an explicitly\nknown formula. This result complements earlier work on the Ising model and the\n1-2 model. The proof uses the Pfaffian representation of Fisher, Kasteleyn, and\nTemperley for the counts of dimers on planar graphs.\n", "  Probability distributions for correlation functions of particles interacting\nvia random-valued fields are discussed as a novel tool for determining the\nspectrum of a theory. In particular, this method is used to determine the\nenergies of universal N-body clusters tied to Efimov trimers, for even N, by\ninvestigating the distribution of a correlation function of two particles at\nunitarity. Using numerical evidence that this distribution is log-normal, an\nanalytical prediction for the N-dependence of the N-body binding energies is\nmade.\n", "  Bartkiewicz et al. [Phys. Rev. A 91, 012103 (2015)] provided an alternative\nanalysis of experiment performed by Danan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402\n(2013)] which presented surprising evidence regarding the past of photons\npassing through an interferometer. They argued that the quantity used by Danan\net al. is not a suitable which-path witness, and proposed an alternative. It is\nargued that the quantum and classical analyses of Bartkiewicz et al. are\ninconsistent and both are inappropriate for describing the past of photons in a\nproperly working interferometer.\n", "  Quantum walks with memory(QWM) are a type of modified quantum walks that\nrecord the walker's latest path. As we know, only two kinds of QWM are\npresented up to now. It is desired to design more QWM for research, so that we\ncan explore the potential of QWM. In this work, through presenting the\none-to-one correspondence between QWM on a regular graph and quantum walks\nwithout memory(QWoM) on line digraph of the regular graph, we construct a\ngeneric model of QWM on regular graphs. This construction gives a general\nscheme for building all possible standard QWM on regular graphs and makes it\npossible to study properties of different kinds of QWM. Here, by taking the\nsimplest example which is QWM with 1 memory on the line, we analyze some\nproperties of QWM, such as variance, occupancy rate and localization.\n", "  Every solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set\nof quantum numbers, by which we can evaluate it numerically. However, no\ngeneral rule is known how to give quantum numbers for the physical solutions of\nBAE. For the spin-1/2 XXX chain we rigorously derive all the quantum numbers\nfor the complete set of the Bethe-ansatz eigenvectors in the two down-spin\nsector with any chain length $N$. Here we obtain them both for real and complex\nsolutions. Consequently, we prove the completeness of the Bethe ansatz and give\nan exact expression for the number of real solutions which correspond to\ncollapsed bound-state solutions (i.e., 2-string solutions) in the sector: $2[\n(N-1)/2 - (N/\\pi) \\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{N-1})]$ in terms of Gauss' symbol. Moreover,\nwe prove in the sector the scheme conjectured by Takahashi for solving BAE\nsystematically. We also suggest that by applying the present method we can\nderive the quantum numbers for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain.\n", "  This paper presents a three layer index guided lead silicate (SF57) photonic\ncrystal fiber which simultaneously promises to yield large effective optical\nnonlinear coefficient and low anomalous dispersion that makes it suitable for\nsupercontinuum generation. At an operating wavelength 1550 nm, the typical\noptimized value of anomalous dispersion and effective nonlinear coefficient\nturns out to be ~4 ps/km/nm and ~1078 W^(-1) km^(-1), respectively. Through\nnumerical simulation it is realized that the designed fiber promises to exhibit\nthree octave spanning supercontinuum from 900 to 7200 nm by using 50 fs sech\noptical pulses of 5 kW peak power. Due to the cross-phase modulation and\nfour-wave mixing processes, a long range of red-shifted dispersive wave\ngenerated, which assist to achieve such large broadening. In addition, we have\ninvestigated the compatibility of supercontinuum generation with input pulse\npeak power increment and briefly discussed the impact of nonlinear processes on\nsupercontinuum generation.\n", "  Surface and volume plasmons excited in a metal cluster by moving electron and\ncorresponding inelastic scattering spectra are studied based on the\nhydrodynamic approach. Along with the bulk losses traditionally taken into\naccount, the surface and radiative ones are also considered as the physical\nmechanisms responsible for the plasmon damping. The second and third mechanisms\nare found to be essential for the surface plasmons and depend very differently\non the multipole mode order. The differential equations are obtained which\ndescribe the temporal evolution of every particular mode as that one of a\nlinear oscillator excited by the given external force, and the electron energy\nloss spectra are calculated. The changes in spectrum shape with the impact\nparameter and with the electron passage time are analyzed and found to be in\ngood enough agreement with the data of scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM) experiments. It is shown that, in the general case, a\npronounced contribution to the formation of the loss spectrum is given by the\nboth surface and volume plasmons with low and high multipole indices. In\nparticular, at long electron passage time, the integral loss spectrum which is\ncalculated for the free-electron cluster model contains two main peaks: a broad\npeak from merging of many high-order multipole resonances of the surface\nplasmons and a narrower peak of nearly the same height from merged volume\nplasmons excited by the electrons that travel through the central region of the\ncluster. Comparatively complex dependences of the calculated excitation\ncoefficients and damping constants of various plasmons on the order of the\nexcited multipole result in wide diversity of possible types of the loss\nspectrum even for the same cluster material and should be taken into account in\ninterpretation of corresponding electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)\nexperiments.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, the electronic and magnetic properties\nof orthorhombic BaFeO$_{3}$ (BFO) are investigated with local spin density\napproximation (LSDA). The calculations reveal that at the optimized lattice\nvolume BFO has a lower energy in ferromagnetic state as compared with\nantiferromagnetic state. At the equilibrium volume, BFO shows metallic\nbehavior, however, under a large tensile strain ($\\sim25\\%$), BFO shows\nhalf-metallic behavior consistent with the integer magnetic moment of\n$4.0\\mu_{\\rm{B}}$/fu mainly caused by the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ electrons of Fe.\nIncluding a Hubbard-like contribution $U$ (LSDA$+U$) on Fe $d$ states induced\nhalf-metallic bahvior without external strain, which indicates that $U$ can be\nused to tune the electronic structure of BFO. The magnetic moments remained\nrobust against $\\sim 10\\%$ compressive and tensile strain. At large compressive\n(tensile) strain, the half-metallicity of BFO is mainly destroyed by the Fe-$d$\n(O-$p$) electrons in agreement with the non-integer value of the magnetic\nmoments of BFO.\n", "  We establish bounds on the decay of time-dependent multipoint correlation\nfunctionals of one-dimensional quasi-free fermions in terms of the decay\nproperties of their two-point function. At a technical level, this is done with\nthe help of bounds on certain bordered determinants and pfaffians. These\nbounds, which we prove, go beyond the well-known Hadamard estimates. Our main\napplication of these results is a proof of strong (exponential) dynamical\nlocalization of spin-correlation functions in disordered $XY$-spin chains.\n", "  Precise measurement of neutrino oscillations, and hence the determination of\ntheir masses demands a quantitative understanding of neutrino-nucleus\ninteractions. To this aim, two-body meson-exchange currents have to be\naccounted for along within realistic models of nuclear dynamics. We summarize\nour progresses towards the construction of a consistent framework, based on\nquantum Monte Carlo methods and on the spectral function approach, that can be\nexploited to accurately describe neutrino interactions with atomic nuclei over\nthe broad kinematical region covered by neutrino experiments.\n", "  The studies of the Higgs boson couplings based on the recent and upcoming LHC\ndata open up a new window on physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper,\nwe propose a statistical guide to the consistent treatment of the theoretical\nuncertainties entering the Higgs rate fits. Both the Bayesian and frequentist\napproaches are systematically analysed in a unified formalism. We present\nanalytical expressions for the marginal likelihoods, useful to implement\nsimultaneously the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. We review the\nvarious origins of the theoretical errors (QCD, EFT, PDF, production mode\ncontamination...). All these individual uncertainties are thoroughly combined\nwith the help of moment-based considerations. The theoretical correlations\namong Higgs detection channels appear to affect the location and size of the\nbest-fit regions in the space of Higgs couplings. We discuss the recurrent\nquestion of the shape of the prior distributions for the individual theoretical\nerrors and find that a nearly Gaussian prior arises from the error\ncombinations. We also develop the bias approach, which is an alternative to\nmarginalisation providing more conservative results. The statistical framework\nto apply the bias principle is introduced and two realisations of the bias are\nproposed. Finally, depending on the statistical treatment, the Standard Model\nprediction for the Higgs signal strengths is found to lie within either the\n$68\\%$ or $95\\%$ confidence level region obtained from the latest analyses of\nthe $7$ and $8$ TeV LHC datasets.\n", "  We experimentally study the effects of coupling one-dimensional Many-Body\nLocalized (MBL) systems with identical disorder. Using a gas of ultracold\nfermions in an optical lattice, we artifically prepare an initial charge\ndensity wave in an array of 1D tubes with quasi-random onsite disorder and\nmonitor the subsequent dynamics over several thousand tunneling times. We find\na strikingly different behavior between MBL and Anderson Localization. While\nthe non-interacting Anderson case remains localized, in the interacting case\nany coupling between the tubes leads to a delocalization of the entire system.\n", "  High-throughput ab-initio calculations, cluster expansion techniques and\nthermodynamic modeling have been synergistically combined to characterize the\nbinodal and the spinodal decompositions features in the pseudo-binary lead\nchalcogenides PbSe-PbTe, PbS-PbTe, and PbS-PbSe. While our results agree with\nthe available experimental data, our consolute temperatures substantially\nimprove with respect to previous computational modeling. The computed phase\ndiagrams corroborate that the formation of spinodal nanostructures causes low\nthermal conductivities in these alloys. The presented approach, making a\nrational use of online quantum repositories, can be extended to study\nthermodynamical and kinetic properties of materials of technological interest.\n", "  We introduce the extension of the ab initio no-core shell model with\ncontinuum to describe three-body cluster systems. We present results for the\nground state of 6He and show improvements with respect to the description\nobtained within the no-core shell model and the no-core shell model/resonating\ngroup methods.\n", "  Honeycomb lattice can support electronic states exhibiting Dirac energy\ndispersion, with graphene as the icon. We propose to derive nontrivial topology\nby grouping six neighboring sites of honeycomb lattice into hexagons and\nenhancing the inter-hexagon hopping energies over the intra-hexagon ones. We\nreveal that this manipulation opens a gap in the energy dispersion and drives\nthe system into a topological state. The nontrivial topology is characterized\nby the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index associated with a pseudo time-reversal symmetry\nemerging from the $C_6$ symmetry of the Kekul\\'{e} hopping texture, where the\nangular momentum of orbitals accommodated on the hexagonal \"artificial atoms\"\nbehaves as the pseudospin. The size of topological gap is proportional to the\nhopping-integral difference, which can be larger than typical spin-orbit\ncouplings by orders of magnitude and potentially renders topological electronic\ntransports available at high temperatures.\n", "  I discuss the role of relativistic quantum mechanics in few-body physics,\nvarious formulations of relativistic few-body quantum mechanics and how they\nare related.\n", "  The ${^3{\\rm He}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Be}}$ and ${^3{\\rm\nH}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Li}}$ astrophysical $S$ factors are evaluated at low\ncollision energies (less than 2.5 MeV in the centre-of-mass frame) within the\nno-core shell model with continuum approach using a renormalized chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interaction.\n", "  Cu(C$_8$H$_6$N$_2$)Cl$_2$, a strong-rung spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder compound,\nis probed by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in the\nfield-induced gapless phase above $H_{c1}$. The temperature dependence of the\nESR linewidth is analyzed in the quantum field theory framework, suggesting\nthat the anisotropy of magnetic interactions plays a crucial role, determining\nthe peculiar low-temperature ESR linewidth behavior. In particular, it is\nargued that the uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (which is allowed on\nthe bonds along the ladder legs) can be the source of this behavior in\nCu(C$_8$H$_6$N$_2$)Cl$_2$.\n", "  In this letter we perform an experimental study of ionic transport and\ncurrent fluctuations inside individual Carbon Nanotubes (CNT). The conductance\nexhibits a power law behavior at low salinity, with an exponent close to 1/3\nversus the salt concentration. This scaling behavior is rationalized in terms\nof a model accounting for hydroxide adsorption at the (hydrophobic) carbon\nsurface, leading to a density dependent surface charge. This is in contrast to\nboron nitride nanotubes which exhibit a constant surface conductance. Further\nwe measure the low frequency noise of the ionic current in CNT and show that\nthe amplitude of the noise scales with the surface charge, with data collapsing\non a master curve for the various studied CNT at a given pH.\n", "  The highly anisotropic and qualitatively different nature of in- and\nout-of-plane charge dynamics in high-Tc cuprates cannot be accommodated within\nthe conventional Boltzmann transport theory. The variation of in- and\nout-of-plane resistivities with temperature and hole content are also anomalous\nand cannot be explained by Fermi-liquid theory. In this study we have proposed\na simple phenomenological model for the dc resistivity of cuprates by\nincorporating two firmly established generic features of all hole doped cuprate\nsuperconductors- (1) the pseudogap in the quasiparticle energy spectrum and (2)\nthe T-linear resistivity at high temperatures. This T-linear behavior over an\nextended temperature range can be attributed to a quantum criticality,\naffecting the electronic phase diagram of cuprates. Experimental in-plane and\nout-of-plane resistivities of double layer Y(Ca)123 have been analyzed using\nthe proposed model. This phenomenological model describes the temperature and\nhole content dependent resistivity over a wide range of temperature and hole\ncontent.\n", "  Preliminary calculations using the Covariant Spectator Theory (CST) employed\na scalar linear confining interaction and an additional constant vector\npotential to compute the mesonic mass spectra. In this work we generalize the\nconfining interaction to include more general structures, in particular a\nvector and also a pseudoscalar part, as suggested by a recent study. A\none-gluon-exchange kernel is also implemented to describe the short-range part\nof the interaction. We solve the simplest CST approximation to the complete\nBethe-Salpeter equation, the one-channel spectator equation, using a numerical\ntechnique that eliminates all singularities from the kernel. The parameters of\nthe model are determined through a fit to the experimental pseudoscalar meson\nspectra, with a good agreement for both quarkonia and heavy-light states.\n", "  In this work we combine information from relic abundance, direct detection,\ncosmic microwave background, positron fraction, gamma rays, and colliders to\nexplore the existing constraints on couplings between Dark Matter and Standard\nModel constituents when no underlying model or correlation is assumed. For\ndefiniteness, we include independent vector-like effective interactions for\neach Standard Model fermion. Our results show that low Dark Matter masses below\n20 GeV are disfavoured at the $3 \\sigma$ level with respect to higher masses,\ndue to the tension between the relic abundance requirement and upper\nconstraints on the Dark Matter couplings. Furthermore, large couplings are\ntypically only allowed in combinations which avoid effective couplings to the\nnuclei used in direct detection experiments.\n", "  We demonstrate a new approach for engineering group IV semiconductor-based\nquantum photonic structures containing negatively charged silicon-vacancy\n(SiV$^-$) color centers in diamond as quantum emitters. Hybrid SiC/diamond\nstructures are realized by combining the growth of nanoand micro-diamonds on\nsilicon carbide (3C or 4H polytype) substrates, with the subsequent use of\nthese diamond crystals as a hard mask for pattern transfer. SiV$^-$ color\ncenters are incorporated in diamond during its synthesis from molecular diamond\nseeds (diamondoids), with no need for ionimplantation or annealing. We show\nthat the same growth technique can be used to grow a diamond layer controllably\ndoped with SiV$^-$ on top of a high purity bulk diamond, in which we\nsubsequently fabricate nanopillar arrays containing high quality SiV$^-$\ncenters. Scanning confocal photoluminescence measurements reveal optically\nactive SiV$^-$ lines both at room temperature and low temperature (5 K) from\nall fabricated structures, and, in particular, very narrow linewidths and small\ninhomogeneous broadening of SiV$^-$ lines from all-diamond nano-pillar arrays,\nwhich is a critical requirement for quantum computation. At low temperatures (5\nK) we observe in these structures the signature typical of SiV$^-$ centers in\nbulk diamond, consistent with a double lambda. These results indicate that high\nquality color centers can be incorporated into nanophotonic structures\nsynthetically with properties equivalent to those in bulk diamond, thereby\nopening opportunities for applications in classical and quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  In this article, we discuss the stability of soft quasicrystalline phases in\na coupled-mode Swift-Hohenberg model for three-component systems, where the\ncharacteristic length scales are governed by the positive-definite gradient\nterms. Classic two-mode approximation method and direct numerical minimization\nare applied to the model. In the latter approach, we apply the projection\nmethod to deal with the potentially quasiperiodic ground states. A variable\ncell method of optimizing the shape and size of higher-dimensional periodic\ncell is developed to minimize the free energy with respect to the order\nparameters. Based on the developed numerical methods, we rediscover decagonal\nand dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases, and find diverse periodic phases and\ncomplex modulated phases. Furthermore, phase diagrams are obtained in various\nphase spaces by comparing the free energies of different candidate structures.\nIt does show not only the important roles of system parameters, but also the\neffect of optimizing computational domain. In particular, the optimization of\ncomputational cell allows us to capture the ground states and phase behavior\nwith higher fidelity. We also make some discussions on our results and show the\npotential of applying our numerical methods to a larger class of mean-field\nfree energy functionals.\n", "  We investigate the spin dynamics including Gilbert damping in the\nferromagnetic nanowire arrays. We have measured the ferromagnetic resonance of\nferromagnetic nanowire arrays using vector-network analyzer ferromagnetic\nresonance (VNA-FMR) and analyzed the results with the micromagnetic\nsimulations. We find excellent agreement between the experimental VNA-FMR\nspectra and micromagnetic simulations result for various applied magnetic\nfields. We find that the demagnetization factor for longitudinal conditions, Nz\n(Ny) increases (decreases) as decreasing the nanowire width in the\nmicromagnetic simulations. For the transverse magnetic field, Nz (Ny) increases\n(decreases) as increasing the nanowire width. We also find that the Gilbert\ndamping constant increases from 0.018 to 0.051 as the increasing nanowire width\nfor the transverse case, while it is almost constant as 0.021 for the\nlongitudinal case.\n", "  We discuss weakly bound states of a few-fermion system having spin-isospin\nsymmetry. This corresponds to the nuclear physics case in which the singlet,\n$a_0$, and triplet, $a_1$, $n-p$ scattering lengths are large with respect to\nthe range of the nuclear interaction. The ratio of the two is about\n$a_0/a_1\\approx-4.31$. This value defines a plane in which $a_0$ and $a_1$ can\nbe varied up to the unitary limit, $1/a_0=0$ and $1/a_1=0$, maintaining its\nratio fixed. Using a spin dependant potential model we estimate the\nthree-nucleon binding energy along that plane. This analysis can be considered\nan extension of the Efimov plot for three bosons to the case of three\n$1/2$-spin-isospin fermions.\n", "  Combining strong magnetic anisotropy with strong exchange interaction is a\nlong standing goal in the design of quantum magnets. The lanthanide complexes,\nwhile exhibiting a very strong ionic anisotropy, usually display a weak\nexchange coupling, amounting to only a few wavenumbers. Recently, an\nisostructural series of mixed Ln$^{3+}$-N$_2^{3-}$-Ln$^{3+}$ (Ln $=$ Gd, Tb,\nDy, Ho, Er) have been reported, in which the exchange splitting is estimated to\nreach hundreds wavenumbers. The microscopic mechanism governing the unusual\nexchange interaction in these compounds is revealed here by combining detailed\nmodeling with density-functional theory and {\\it ab initio} calculations. We\nfind it to be basically kinetic and highly complex, involving non-negligible\ncontributions up to seventh power of total angular momentum of each lanthanide\nsite. The performed analysis also elucidates the origin of magnetization\nblocking in these compounds. Contrary to general expectations the latter is not\nalways favored by strong exchange interaction.\n", "  This course-based primer provides newcomers to the field with a concise\nintroduction to some of the core topics in the emerging field of topological\nband insulators in one and two dimensions. The aim is to provide a basic\nunderstanding of edge states, bulk topological invariants, and of the\nbulk--boundary correspondence with as simple mathematical tools as possible. We\nuse noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually\non these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal\ninvariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In\neach case the model is introduced first and then its properties are discussed\nand subsequently generalized. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working\nknowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is\nprovided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by\nend-of-chapter problems.\n", "  We present a systematic assessment of the structural properties, the\nelectronic density of states, the charge densities, and the phase stabilities\nof AgInSe$_2$ and AuInSe$_2$ using screened exchange hybrid density functional\ntheory, and compare their properties to those of CuInSe$_2$. For AgInSe$_2$,\nhybrid density functional theory properly captures several experimentally\nmeasured properties, including the increase in the band gap and the change in\nthe direction of the lattice distortion parameter $u$ in comparison to\nCuInSe$_2$. While the electronic properties of AuInSe$_2$ have not yet been\nexperimentally characterized, we predict it to be a small gap ($\\approx 0.15$\neV) semiconductor. We also present the phase stability of AgInSe$_2$ and\nAuInSe$_2$ according to screened-exchange density functional theory, and\ncompare the results to predictions from conventional density functional theory,\nresults tabulated from several online materials data repositories, and\nexperiment (when available). In comparison to conventional density functional\ntheory, the hybrid functional predicts phase stabilities of AgInSe$_2$ in\nbetter agreement with experiment: discrepancies in the calculated formation\nenthalpies are reduced by approximately a factor of three, from $\\approx$ 0.20\neV/atom to $\\approx$ 0.07 eV/atom, similar to the improvement observed for\nCuInSe$_2$. We further predict that AuInSe$_2$ is not a stable phase, and can\nonly be present under non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  It has long been expected that the spectrum of hadrons in QCD would be far\nricher and extensive than experiment has so far revealed. While there have been\nexperimental hints of this richness for some time, it is really only in the\nlast few years that dramatic progress has been seen in the exploration both\nexperimentally and in calculations on the lattice. Precision studies enabled by\nnew technology both with detectors and high performance computations are\nconverging on an understanding of the spectrum in strong coupling QCD.\n  These methodologies are laying the foundation for a decade of potential\ndiscovery that electro and photoproduction experiments at Jefferson Lab, which\nwhen combined with key results on $B$ and charmonium decays from both $e^+e^-$\nand $pp$ colliders, should turn mere impressions of the light meson spectrum\ninto a high definition picture.\n", "  We report the experimental investigation and theoretical modeling of a\nrotating polariton superfluid relying on an innovative method for the injection\nof angular momentum. This novel, multi-pump injection method uses four coherent\nlasers arranged in a square, resonantly creating four polariton populations\npropagating inwards. The control available over the direction of propagation of\nthe superflows allows injecting a controllable non-quantized amount of optical\nangular momentum. When the density at the center is low enough to neglect\npolariton-polariton interactions, optical singularities, associated to an\ninterference pattern, are visible in the phase. In the superfluid regime\nresulting from the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton interaction, the\ninterference pattern disappears and only vortices with the same sign are\npersisting in the system. Remarkably the number of vortices inside the\nsuperfluid region can be controlled by controlling the angular momentum\ninjected by the pumps.\n", "  Fractional topological insulators are electronic systems that carry\nfractionally charged excitations, conserve charge and are symmetric to reversal\nof time. In this review we introduce the basic essential concepts of the field,\nand then survey theoretical understanding of fractional topological insulators\nin two and three dimensions. In between, we discuss the case of \"two and a half\ndimensions\", the fractional topological insulators that may form on the two\ndimensional surface of an unfractionalized three dimensional topological\ninsulator. We focus on electronic systems and emphasize properties of edges and\nsurfaces, most notably the stability of gapless edge modes to perturbations.\n", "  We study the effects of a phase difference on Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states\nin a spinful Coulomb-blockaded quantum dot contacted by a superconducting loop.\nIn the limit where charging energy is larger than the superconducting gap, we\ndetermine the subgap excitation spectrum, the corresponding supercurrent, and\nthe differential conductance as measured by a normal-metal tunnel probe. In\nabsence of a phase difference only one linear combination of the superconductor\nlead electrons couples to the spin, which gives a single YSR state. With finite\nphase difference, however, it is effectively a two-channel scattering problem\nand therefore an additional state emerges from the gap edge. The energy of the\nphase-dependent YSR states depend on the gate voltage and one state can cross\nzero energy twice inside the valley with odd occupancy. These crossings are\nshifted by the phase difference towards the charge degeneracy points,\ncorresponding to larger exchange couplings. Moreover, the zero-energy crossings\ngive rise to resonant peaks in the differential conductance with magnitude\n$4e^2/h$. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum fluctuations of the dot spin\ndo not alter qualitatively any of the results.\n", "  We perform resummation of soft gluon corrections to the total cross section\nfor the process $pp \\to t\\bar{t}H$. The resummation is carried out at\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) accuracy using the Mellin space technique,\nextending its application to the class of $2 \\to 3$ processes. We present an\nanalytical result for the soft anomalous dimension for a hadronic production of\ntwo coloured massive particles in association with a colour singlet. We discuss\nthe impact of resummation on the numerical prediction for the associated Higgs\nboson production with top quarks at the LHC.\n", "  Linear polymers adsorbing on a wall can be modelled by half-space\nself-avoiding walks adsorbing on a line in the square lattice, or on a surface\nin the cubic lattice. In this paper a numerical approach based on the GAS\nalgorithm is used to approximately enumerate states in the partition function\nof this model. The data are used to approximate the free energy in the model,\nfrom which estimates of the location of the critical point and crossover\nexponents are made. The critical point is found to be located at\n\\begin{equation} a_c^+ = \\cases{ 1.779 \\pm 0.003, & \\hbox{in the square\nlattice}; \\\\ 1.306 \\pm 0.007, & \\hbox{in the cubic lattice}. } \\end{equation}\nThese results are then used to estimate the crossover exponent $\\phi$\nassociated with the adsorption transition, giving \\begin{equation} \\phi =\n\\cases{ 0.496 \\pm 0.009, & \\hbox{in two dimensions}; \\\\ 0.505 \\pm 0.006, &\n\\hbox{in three dimensions}. } \\end{equation} In addition, the scaling of these\nthermodynamic quantities is examined using the numerical data, including the\nscaling of metric quantities, and the partition and generating functions. In\nall cases results and numerical values of exponents were obtained which are\nconsistent with estimates in the literature.\n", "  In this note we exactly compute the gaugino condensation of an arbitrary four\ndimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory in confining phase, using the\nlocalization technique. This result gives a nonperturbative proof of the\nDijkgraaf-Vafa conjecture.\n", "  Amongst the bound states produced by the strong interaction, radially excited\nmeson and nucleon states offer an important phenomenological window into the\nlong-range behavior of the coupling constant in Quantum Chromodynamics. We here\nreport on some technical details related to the computation of the bound\nstate's eigenvalue spectrum in the framework of Bethe-Salpeter and Faddeev\nequations.\n", "  We consider four scalar mesons scattering in large-Nc QCD. Using the\nworldline formalism we show that the scattering amplitude can be written as a\nformal sum over Wilson loops. The AdS/CFT correspondence maps this sum into a\nsum over string worldsheets in a confining background. We then argue that for\nwell separated mesons the sum is dominated by flat space configurations. Under\nadditional assumptions about the dual string path integral we obtain the\nVeneziano amplitude.\n", "  In this paper we construct multiparametric families of two dimensional\nmetrics with polynomial first integral. Such integrable geodesic flows are\ndescribed by solutions of some semi-Hamiltonian hydrodynamic type system. We\nfind infinitely many conservation laws and commuting flows for this system.\nThis procedure allows us to present infinitely many particular metrics by the\ngeneralized hodograph method.\n", "  We demonstrate that ultrafast carrier excitation can drastically affect\nelectronic structures and induce brief surface plasmonic response in\nnon-plasmonic metals, potentially creating a plasmonic switch. Using\nfirst-principles molecular dynamics and Kubo-Greenwood formalism for\nlaser-excited tungsten we show that carrier heating mobilizes d electrons into\ncollective inter and intraband transitions leading to a sign flip in the\nimaginary optical conductivity, activating plasmonic properties for the initial\nnon-plasmonic phase. The drive for the optical evolution can be visualized as\nan increasingly damped quasi-resonance at visible frequencies for pumping\ncarriers across a chemical potential located in a d-band pseudo-gap with\nenergy-dependent degree of occupation. The subsequent evolution of optical\nindices for the excited material is confirmed by time-resolved ultrafast\nellipsometry. The large optical tunability extends the existence spectral\ndomain of surface plasmons in ranges typically claimed in laser self-organized\nnanostructuring. Non-equilibrium heating is thus a strong factor for\nengineering optical control of evanescent excitation waves, particularly\nimportant in laser nanostructuring strategies.\n", "  We review the status of the proton charge radius puzzle. Emphasis is given to\nthe various experiments initiated to resolve the conflict between the muonic\nhydrogen results and the results from scattering and regular hydrogen\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Volume limitations and low yield thresholds of biological fluids have led to\nwidespread use of passive microparticle rheology. The mean-squared-displacement\n(MSD) statistics of bead position time series (bead paths) are either applied\ndirectly to determine the creep compliance [Xu et al (1998)] or transformed to\ndetermine dynamic storage and loss moduli [Mason & Weitz (1995)]. A prevalent\nhurdle arises when there is a non-diffusive experimental drift in the data.\nCommensurate with the magnitude of drift relative to diffusive mobility,\nquantified by a P\\'eclet number, the MSD statistics are distorted, and thus the\npath data must be \"corrected\" for drift. The standard approach is to estimate\nand subtract the drift from particle paths, and then calculate MSD statistics.\nWe present an alternative, parametric approach using maximum likelihood\nestimation that simultaneously fits drift and diffusive model parameters from\nthe path data; the MSD statistics (and consequently the compliance and dynamic\nmoduli) then follow directly from the best-fit model. We illustrate and compare\nboth methods on simulated path data over a range of P\\'eclet numbers, where\nexact answers are known. We choose fractional Brownian motion as the numerical\nmodel because it affords tunable, sub-diffusive MSD statistics consistent with\ntypical 30 second long, experimental observations of microbeads in several\nbiological fluids. Finally, we apply and compare both methods on data from\nhuman bronchial epithelial cell culture mucus.\n", "  We discuss flavor symmetries in left-right symmetric theories. We show that\nsuch frameworks are a different environment for flavor symmetry model building\ncompared to the usually considered cases. This does not only concern the need\nto obey the enlarged gauge structure, but also more subtle issues with respect\nto residual symmetries. Furthermore, if the discrete left-right symmetry is\ncharge conjugation, potential inconsistencies between the flavor and charge\nconjugation symmetries should be taken care of. In our predictive model based\non $A_4$ we analyze the correlations between the smallest neutrino mass, the\natmospheric mixing angle and the Dirac CP phase, the latter prefers to lie\naround maximal values. There is no lepton flavor violation from the Higgs\nbi-doublet.\n", "  One of the challenges of the modern photonics is to develop all-optical\ndevices enabling increased speed and energy efficiency for transmitting and\nprocessing information on an optical chip. It is believed that the recently\nsuggested Parity-Time (PT) symmetric photonic systems with alternating regions\nof gain and loss can bring novel functionalities. In such systems, losses are\nas important as gain and, depending on the structural parameters, gain\ncompensates losses. Generally, PT systems demonstrate nontrivial\nnon-conservative wave interactions and phase transitions, which can be employed\nfor signal filtering and switching, opening new prospects for active control of\nlight. In this review, we discuss a broad range of problems involving nonlinear\nPT-symmetric photonic systems with an intensity-dependent refractive index.\nNonlinearity in such PT symmetric systems provides a basis for many effects\nsuch as the formation of localized modes, nonlinearly-induced PT-symmetry\nbreaking, and all-optical switching. Nonlinear PT-symmetric systems can serve\nas powerful building blocks for the development of novel photonic devices\ntargeting an active light control.\n", "  A mixed basis approach based on density functional theory is extended to\none-dimensional(1D) systems. The basis functions here are taken to be the\nlocalized B-splines for the two finite non-periodic dimensions and the plane\nwaves for the third periodic direction. This approach will significantly reduce\nthe number of the basis and therefore is computationally efficient for the\ndiagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. For 1D systems, B-spline\npolynomials are particularly useful and efficient in two-dimensional spatial\nintegrations involved in the calculations because of their absolute\nlocalization. Moreover, B-splines are not associated with atomic positions when\nthe geometry structure is optimized, making the geometry optimization easy to\nimplement. With such a basis set we can directly calculate the total energy of\nthe isolated system instead of using the conventional supercell model with\nartificial vacuum regions among the replicas along the two non-periodic\ndirections. The spurious Coulomb interaction between the charged defect and its\nrepeated images by the supercell approach for charged systems can also be\navoided. A rigorous formalism for the long-range Coulomb potential of both\nneutral and charged 1D systems under the mixed basis scheme will be derived. To\ntest the present method, we apply it to study the infinite carbon-dimmer chain,\ngraphene nanoribbon, carbon nanotube and positively-charged carbon-dimmer\nchain. The resulting electronic structures are presented and discussed in\ndetails.\n", "  We demonstrate the simultaneous dressing of both vacuum-to-exciton and\nexciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot in a\nhigh-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Resonant\ntwo-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by spectrally tuning the\nquantum dot emission with respect to the cavity mode. The cavity couples to\nboth transitions and amplifies the Rabi-frequency of the likewise resonant cw\nlaser, driving the transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the\nemission lines, which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the\ncavity-laser detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom\ncorrectly predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission\nspectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further\nprovided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for cavity\ncoupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor medium.\n", "  The bound state of \\nuclide[6][\\Lambda\\Lambda]{He} is studied as a three-body\n($\\Lambda\\Lambda\\alpha$) system in a cluster effective field theory at leading\norder (LO). We find that the system exhibits the limit cycle which is\nassociated with the formation of bound states called the Efimov states. This\nimplies that the three-body contact interaction should be promoted to LO. The\nrelationship of the binding energy and the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ scattering length\nis discussed as well as the role of the scale in this system.\n", "  We present a new approach for electronic control of optical tweezers by using\nspace-time-wavelength mapping (STWM), a technique that uses time-domain\nmodulation to control local intensity values, and hence the resulting optical\nforce, in space. The proposed technique enables direct control of magnitude,\nlocation, and polarity of force hot-spots created by Lorentz force (gradient\nforce). In this paper, we develop an analytical formulation of the proposed\nSTWM technique for optical tweezing. In the case study presented here, we show\nthat 150 fs optical pulses are dispersed in time and space to achieve a focused\nelliptical beam that is ~20 {\\mu}m long and ~2 {\\mu}m wide. By choosing the\nappropriate RF waveform and electro-optic modulator, we can generate multiple\nhot-spots with >200 pN force per pulse.\n", "  Recently the new concepts of transverse spin angular momentum and Belinfante\nspin momentum of evanescent waves have drawn considerable attention. Here, we\ninvestigate these novel physical properties of electromagnetic fields in the\ncontext of locally excited surface plasmon polaritons. We demonstrate, both\nanalytically and numerically, that locally excited surface plasmon polaritons\npossess transverse spin angular momentum and Belinfante momentum with rich and\nnon-trivial characteristics. We also show that the transverse spin angular\nmomentum of locally excited surface plasmon polaritons leads to the emergence\nof transverse chiral forces in opposite directions for chiral objects of\ndifferent handedness. The magnitude of such a transverse force is comparable to\nthe optical gradient force and scattering forces. This finding may pave the way\nfor realization of optical separation of chiral biomolecules.\n", "  We initiate a systematic study of entanglement and Renyi entropies in the\npresence of gauge and gravitational anomalies in even-dimensional quantum field\ntheories. We argue that the mixed and gravitational anomalies are sensitive to\nboosts and obtain a closed form expression for their behavior under such\ntransformations. Explicit constructions exhibiting the dependence of\nentanglement entropy on boosts is provided for theories on spacetimes with\nnon-trivial magnetic fluxes and (or) non-vanishing Pontryagin classes.\n", "  The monoclinic double-perovskite Sr2YRuO6 has recently gained a renewed\ninterest in order to get a deeper insight into the exotic magnetic ground\nstates associated with geometric frustration. Striking discrepancies between\nthe spin order derived from the neutron diffraction refinements and the\nmacroscopic magnetic and thermal responses is a major challenge that must be\naddressed. In this work, detailed neutron diffraction measurements as a\nfunction of temperature yield a completely different interpretation of the\npatterns. We show that at low temperatures a spin structure of the K2NiF4-type\nis an accessible configuration for the magnetic ground state. In the\nneighborhood of the magnetic transition this configuration evolves into a\ncanted super-structure. The deduced temperature dependence of the canting angle\nexhibits two closely spaced peaks, which are in excellent agreement with the\ndouble peaks in the magnetic contribution to the specific heat and in the\nthermal expansion coefficient. We explain these features in terms of\nreorientation of the net ferromagnetic moment of the noncollinear spin state,\ndue to the local breaking of the inversion symmetry promoted by the monoclinic\ndistortions, with structural changes acting as the driving force.\n", "  We present a phenomenological study of the phase dynamics of the\none-dimensional stochastically forced Burgers equation, and of the same\nequation under a Fourier mode reduction on a fractal set. We study the\nconnection between coherent structures in real space and the evolution of\ntriads in Fourier space. Concerning the one-dimensional case, we find that\ntriad phases show alignments and synchronisations that favour energy fluxes\ntowards small scales --a direct cascade. In addition, strongly dissipative\nreal-space structures are associated with entangled correlations amongst the\nphase precession frequencies and the amplitude evolution of Fourier triads. As\na result, triad precession frequencies show a non-Gaussian distribution with\nmultiple peaks and fat tails, and there is a significant correlation between\ntriad precession frequencies and amplitude growth. Links with dynamical systems\napproach are briefly discussed, such as the role of unstable critical points in\nstate space. On the other hand, by reducing the fractal dimension $D$ of the\nunderlying Fourier set, we observe: i) a tendency toward a more Gaussian\nstatistics, ii) a loss of alignment of triad phases leading to a depletion of\nthe energy flux, and iii) the simultaneous reduction of the correlation between\nthe growth of Fourier mode amplitudes and the precession frequencies of triad\nphases.\n", "  We present the updated orbital solution for the transient Be X-ray binary V\n0332+53 comple- menting historical measurements with the data from the\ngamma-ray burst monitor onboard Fermi obtained during the outburst in\nJune-October 2015. We model the observed changes in the spin- frequency of the\npulsar and deduce the orbital parameters of the system. We significantly\nimprove existing constrains and show that contrary to the previous findings no\nchange in orbital parameters is required to explain the spin evolution of the\nsource during the outbursts in 1983, 2005 and 2015. The reconstructed intrinsic\nspin-up of the neutron star during the latest outburst is found to be\ncomparable with previosly observed values and predictions of the accretion\ntorque theory.\n", "  Schooling, an archetype of collective behavior, emerges from the interactions\nof fish responding to visual and other informative cues mediated by their\naqueous environment. In this context, a fundamental and largely unexplored\nquestion concerns the role of hydrodynamics. Here, we investigate schooling by\nmodeling swimmers as vortex dipoles whose interactions are governed by the\nBiot-Savart law. When we enhance these dipoles with behavioral rules from\nclassical agent based models we find that they do not lead robustly to\nschooling due to flow mediated interactions. In turn, we present dipole\nswimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that learn, through a\nreinforcement learning algorithm, to adjust their gaits in response to\nnon-linearly varying hydrodynamic loads. The dipoles maintain their relative\nposition within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety\nof prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling\npatterns that minimize the individual and the collective swimming effort,\nthrough an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the\nadaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is\ncritical in fish schooling.\n", "  We consider one of the most significant deviations from the Standard Model:\nthe forward-backward asymmetry of the b-quark measured at leptonic colliders.\nWe investigate the possibility to solve this discrepancy by introducing new\nphysics at the TeV scale. We focus on models where the Higgs is a pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone boson of a new strongly coupled sector with a global SO(5)\nsymmetry broken spontaneously to SO(4). Besides the usual top partners, we\nintroduce bottom partners in the representations 16 and 4 of SO(5) and show\nthat they can improve significantly the fit by correcting the Zbb couplings. We\nalso estimate the corrections to the couplings at one-loop and obtain that the\ntree-level ones dominate and can give a reliable estimation. We find that the\nlarge shift required for Zb_Rb_R leads to light custodians associated to the\nb-quark, similar to the top partners, as well as a rich phenomenology involving\nneutral interactions in the bottom-sector.\n", "  Heat conduction in graphite has been studied for decades because of its\nexceptionally large thermal anisotropy. While the bulk thermal conductivities\nalong the in-plane and cross-plane directions are well known, less understood\nare the microscopic properties of the thermal phonons responsible for heat\nconduction. In particular, recent experimental and computational works indicate\nthat the average phonon mean free path (MFP) along the c-axis is considerably\nlarger than that estimated by kinetic theory, but the distribution of MFPs\nremains unknown. Here, we report the first quantitative measurements of c-axis\nphonon MFP spectra in graphite at a variety of temperatures using time-domain\nthermoreflectance measurements of graphite flakes with variable thickness. Our\nresults indicate that c-axis phonon MFPs have values of a few hundred\nnanometers at room temperature and a much narrower distribution than in\nisotropic crystals. At low temperatures, phonon scattering is dominated by\ngrain boundaries separating crystalline regions of different rotational\norientation. Our study provides important new insights into heat transport and\nphonon scattering mechanisms in graphite and other anisotropic van der Waals\nsolids.\n", "  In a previous work [1], we have argued that the algebra of non-abelian\nsuperselection rules is spontaneously broken to its maximal abelian subalgebra,\nthat is, the algebra generated by its completing commuting set (the two\nCasimirs and a basis of its Cartan subalgebra). In this paper, alternative\narguments confirming these results are presented. In addition, Lorentz\ninvariance is shown to be broken in QCD, just as it is in QED. The experimental\nconsequences of these results include fuzzy mass and spin shells of coloured\nparticles like quarks, and decay life times which depend on the frame of\nobservation [2-4].\n  In a paper under preparation, these results are extended to the ADM\nPoincar\\'e group and the local Lorentz group of frames. The renormalisation of\nthe ADM energy by infrared gravitons is also studied and estimated.\n", "  The definition of path integrals in one- and two-dimensional Snyder space is\ndiscussed in detail both in the traditional setting and in the first-order\nformalism of Faddeev and Jackiw.\n", "  The \"long\" indecomposable N=2, d=1 multiplet (2, 4, 2) defined in\narXiv:1503.05537 [hep-th] as a deformation of the pair of chiral multiplets (2,\n2, 0) and (0, 2, 2) by a number of the mass-dimension parameters is described\nin the superfield approach. We present its most general superfield and\ncomponent actions, as well as a generalization to the case with the superfields\nof the opposite Grassmann parities and dimensionless deformation parameter. We\nshow that the long N=2, d=1 multiplets are naturally embedded into the chiral\nSU(2|1), d=1 superfields having nonzero external spins with respect to SU(2)\n\\subset SU(2|1). A superfield with spin s contains 2s long multiplets and two\nshort multiplets (2, 2, 0) and (0, 2, 2). Two possible N=4, d=1 generalizations\nof the N=2 long multiplet in the superfield approach are also proposed.\n", "  With the Thomson scattering (TS) system in KSTAR, temporal evolution of\nelectron temperature ($T_e$) is estimated using a weighted look-up table method\nwith fast sampling ($1.25$ or $2.5$ GS/s) digitizers during the 2014 KSTAR\ncampaign. Background noise level is used as a weighting parameter without\nconsidering the photon noise due to the absence of information on absolute\nphoton counts detected by the TS system. Estimated electron temperature during\na relatively quiescent discharge are scattered, i.e., $15$\\% variation on $T_e$\nwith respect to its mean value. We find that this $15$\\% variation on $T_e$\ncannot be explained solely by the background noise level which leads us to\ninclude photon noise effects in our analysis. Using synthetic data, we have\nestimated the required photon noise level consistent with the observation and\ndetermined the dominant noise source in KSTAR TS system.\n", "  We predict that a temperature gradient can induce a magnon-mediated intrinsic\ntorque and a transverse spin current in systems with non-trivial magnon Berry\ncurvature. With the help of a microscopic linear response theory of\nnonequilibrium magnon-mediated torques and spin currents we identify the\ninterband and intraband components that manifest in ferromagnets with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic textures. To illustrate and\nassess the importance of such effects, we apply our theory to the\nmagnon-mediated spin Nernst and torque responses in a kagome lattice\nferromagnet.\n", "  We study controlled quantum secure direct communication (CQSDC), a\ncryptographic scheme where a sender can send a secret bit-string to an intended\nrecipient, without any secure classical channel, who can obtain the complete\nbit-string only with the permission of a controller. We report an efficient\nprotocol to realize CQSDC using Cluster state and then go on to construct a\n(2-3)-CQSDC using Brown state, where a coalition of any two of the three\ncontrollers is required to retrieve the complete message. We argue both\nprotocols to be unconditionally secure and analyze the efficiency of the\nprotocols to show it to outperform the existing schemes while maintaining the\nsame security specifications.\n", "  This is a paper based on the invited talk the author gave at the 9th Balkan\nPhysical Union conference. It contains some of the main achievements of lattice\nQCD simulations followed by a list of Balkan physicists who have contributed to\nthe project.\n", "  We consider some of the methods that can be used to reveal the general\nfeatures of how wave functions evolve with time in the harmonic oscillator. We\nfirst review the periodicity properties over each multiple of a quarter of the\nclassical period of oscillation. Then we show that any wave function can be\nsimply transformed so that its centroid, defined by the expectation values of\nposition and momentum, remains at rest at the center of the oscillator. This\nimplies that we need only consider the evolution of this restricted class of\nwave functions; the evolution of all others can be reduced to these. The\nevolution of the spread in position $\\Delta_x$ and momentum $\\Delta_p$ throws\nlight on energy and uncertainty and on squeezed and coherent states. Finally we\nshow that any wave function can be transformed so that $\\Delta_x$ and\n$\\Delta_p$ do not change with time and that the evolution of all wave functions\ncan easily be found from the evolution of those at rest at the origin with\nunchanging $\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_p$.\n", "  We study both static and dynamic properties of a weakly interacting\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a quasi one-dimensional gravito-optical\nsurface trap, where the downward pull of gravity is compensated by the\nexponentially decaying potential of an evanescent wave. First, we work out\napproximate solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for both a small number\nof atoms using a Gaussian ansatz and a larger number of atoms using the\nThomas-Fermi limit. Then we confirm the accuracy of these analytical solutions\nby comparing them to numerical results. From there, we numerically analyze how\nthe BEC cloud expands non-ballistically, when the confining evanescent laser\nbeam is shut off, showing agreement between our theoretical and previous\nexperimental results. Furthermore, we analyze how the BEC cloud expands\nnon-ballistically due to gravity after switching off the evanescent laser field\nin the presence of a hard-wall mirror. There we find that the BEC shows\nsignificant self-interference patterns for a large number of atoms, whereas for\na small number of atoms, a revival of the BEC wave packet with few matter-wave\ninterference patterns is observed.\n", "  Since flavor neutrino masses $M_{\\mu\\mu,\\tau\\tau,\\mu\\tau}$ can be expressed\nin terms of $M_{ee,e\\mu,e\\tau}$, mutual dependence among\n$M_{\\mu\\mu,\\tau\\tau,\\mu\\tau}$ is derived by imposing some constraints on\n$M_{ee,e\\mu,e\\tau}$. For appropriately imposed constraints on\n$M_{ee,e\\mu,e\\tau}$, we show a texture of neutrino mass matrix giving rise to\nmaximal CP violation. When the atmospheric neutrino mixing is also maximal, we\ndiscuss various specific textures of neutrino mass matrices including the\ntexture with $M_{\\tau\\tau}=M^\\ast_{\\mu\\mu}$ derived as the simplest solution to\nthe constraint of $M_{\\tau\\tau}-M_{\\mu\\mu}$=imaginary, which is required by the\nconstraint of $M_{e\\mu}\\cos\\theta_{23}-M_{e\\tau}\\sin\\theta_{23}$=real for $\\cos\n2\\theta_{23}=0$. It is found that Majorana CP violation depends on the phase of\n$M_{ee}$.\n", "  We derive the approximate solution for the pairing Hamiltonian in the\nBerggren ensemble of single particle states including bound, resonance and\nnon-resonant scattering states. We show that this solution is reliable in the\nlimit of a weak pairing interaction.\n", "  The formation of dust gaps in protoplanetary disks is one of the most\nimportant signposts of disk evolution and possibly the formation of planets. We\naim to characterize the 'flaring' disk structure around the Herbig Ae/Be stars\nHD 100453 and HD 34282. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show an\nemission excess between 15-40{\\mu}m, but very weak (HD 100453) and no (HD\n34282) signs of the 10 and 20 {\\mu}m amorphous silicate features. We\ninvestigate whether this implies the presence of large dust gaps. In this work,\nspatially resolved mid-infrared Q-band images taken with Gemini North/MICHELLE\nare investigated. We perform radiative transfer modeling and examine the radial\ndistribution of dust. We simultaneously fit the Q-band images and SEDs of HD\n100453 and HD 34282. Our solutions require that the inner-halos and outer-disks\nare likely separated by large dust gaps that are depleted wih respect to the\nouter disk by a factor of 1000 or more. The inner edges of the outer disks of\nHD 100453 and HD 34282 have temperatures of about $160 \\pm 10$ K and $60 \\pm 5$\nK respectively. Because of the high surface brightnesses of these walls, they\ndominate the emission in the Q-band. Their radii are constrained at 20+2 AU and\n92+31 AU, respectively. We conclude that, HD 100453 and HD 34282 likely have\ndisk dust gaps and the upper limit on the dust mass in each gap is estimated to\nbe about $10^{-7}$M$_{\\odot}$. We find that the locations and sizes of disk\ndust gaps are connected to the SED, as traced by the mid-infrared flux ratio\nF30/F13.5. We propose a new classification scheme for the Meeus groups (Meeus\net al. 2001) based on the F30/F13.5 ratio. The absence of amorphous silicate\nfeatures in the observed SEDs is caused by the depletion of small (smaller than\n1 {\\mu}m) silicate dust at temperatures above 160 K, which could be related to\nthe presence of a dust gap in that region of the disk.\n", "  In this paper we review a recent proposal to understand the long time limit\nof glassy dynamics in terms of an appropriate Markov Chain. [1]. The advantages\nof the resulting construction are many. The first one is that it gives a quasi\nequilibrium description on how glassy systems explore the phase space in the\nslow relaxation part of their dynamics. The second one is that it gives an\nalternative way to obtain dynamical equations starting from a dynamical rule\nthat is static in spirit. This provides a way to overcome the difficulties\nencountered in the short time part of the dynamics where current conservation\nmust be enforced. We study this approach in detail in a prototypical mean field\ndisordered spin system, namely the p-spin spherical model, showing how we can\nobtain the well known equations that describes its dynamics. Then we apply the\nsame approach to structural glasses. We first derive a set of dynamical\nOrnstein-Zernike equations which are very general in nature. Finally we\nconsider two possible closure schemes for them, namely the Hypernetted Chain\napproximation of liquid theory and a closure of the BBGKY hierarchy that has\nbeen recently introduced by G. Szamel. From both approaches we finally find a\nset of dynamical Mode-Coupling like equations that are supposed to describe the\nsystem in the long time/slow dynamics regime.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems distinguish themselves from Hermitian systems by\nexhibiting a phase transition point called an exceptional point (EP), which is\nthe point at which two eigenstates coalesce under a system parameter variation.\nMany interesting EP phenomena such as level crossings/repulsions in\nnuclear/molecular and condensed matter physics, and unusual phenomena in optics\nsuch as loss-induced lasing and unidirectional transmission can be understood\nby considering a simple 2x2 non-Hermitian matrix. At a higher dimension, more\ncomplex EP physics not found in two-state systems arises. We consider the\nemergence and interaction of multiple EPs in a four-state system theoretically\nand realize the system experimentally using four coupled acoustic cavities with\nasymmetric losses. We find that multiple EPs can emerge and as the system\nparameters vary, these EPs can collide and merge, leading to higher order\nsingularities and topological characteristics much richer than those seen in\ntwo-state systems.\n", "  Consider the Wronskians of the classical Hermite polynomials $$H_{\\lambda,\nl}(x):=\\mathrm{Wr}(H_l(x),H_{k_1}(x),\\ldots, H_{k_n}(x)), \\quad l \\in \\mathbb\nZ_{\\geq 0},$$ where $k_i=\\lambda_i+n-i, \\,\\, i=1,\\dots, n$ and\n$\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n)$ is a partition. G\\'omez-Ullate et al\nshowed that for a special class of partitions the corresponding polynomials are\northogonal and dense among all polynomials with certain inner product, but in\ncontrast to the usual case have some degrees missing (so called exceptional\northogonal polynomials). We generalise their results to all partitions by\nconsidering complex contours of integration and non-positive Hermitian\nproducts. The corresponding polynomials are orthogonal and dense in a\nfinite-codimensional subspace of $\\mathbb C[x]$ satisfying certain\nquasi-invariance conditions. A Laurent version of exceptional orthogonal\npolynomials, related to monodromy-free trigonometric Schr\\\"odinger operators,\nis also presented.\n", "  We study the evolution of the hybrid entangled states in a bipartite (ultra)\nstrongly coupled qubit-oscillator system. Using the generalized rotating wave\napproximation the reduced density matrices of the qubit and the oscillator are\nobtained. The reduced density matrix of the oscillator yields the phase space\nquasi probability distributions such as the diagonal P-representation, the\nWigner W-distribution and the Husimi Q-function. In the strong coupling regime\nthe Q-function evolves to uniformly separated macroscopically distinct Gaussian\npeaks representing 'kitten' states at certain specified times that depend on\nmultiple time scales present in the interacting system. For the ultra-strong\ncoupling realm a large number of interaction-generated modes arise with a\ncomplete randomization of their phases. A stochastic averaging of the dynamical\nquantities sets in while leading to the decoherence of the system. The\ndelocalization in the phase space of the oscillator is studied by using the\nWehrl entropy. The negativity of the W-distribution, while registering its\ndeparture from the classical states, allows us to compare the\ninformation-theoretic measures such as the Wehrl entropy with the Wigner\nentropy. Other features of nonclassicality such as the existence of the\nsqueezed states and appearance of negative values of the Mandel parameter are\nrealized during the course of evolution of the bipartite system. In the\nparametric regime studied here these properties do not survive after a\ntime-averaging process.\n", "  We report an application of the tri-dimensional pseudo-spectral time domain\nalgorithm, that solves with accuracy the nonlinear Maxwell's equations, to\npredict second harmonic generation in lithium niobate ridge-type waveguides\nwith high index contrast. Characteristics of the nonlinear process such as\nconversion efficiency as well as impact of the multimode character of the\nwaveguide are investigated as a function of the waveguide geometry in uniformly\nand periodically poled medium.\n", "  It was claimed recently that a low order post-Newtonian (PN) Lagrangian\nformulation, which corresponds to the Euler-Lagrange equations up to an\ninfinite PN order, can be identical to a PN Hamiltonian formulation at the\ninfinite order from a theoretical point of view. This result is difficult to\ncheck because in most cases one does not know what both the Euler-Lagrange\nequations and the equivalent Hamiltonian are at the infinite order. However, no\ndifficulty exists for a special 1PN Lagrangian formulation of relativistic\ncircular restricted three-body problem, where both the Euler-Lagrange equations\nand the equivalent Hamiltonian not only are expanded to all PN orders but also\nhave converged functions. Consequently, the analytical evidence supports this\nclaim. As far as numerical evidences are concerned, the Hamiltonian equivalent\nto the Euler-Lagrange equations for the lower order Lagrangian requires that\nthey both be only at higher enough finite orders.\n", "  We present a combined analytical approach and numerical study on the\nstability of a ring bound to an annular elastic substrate, which contains a\ncircular cavity. The system is loaded by depressurizing the inner cavity. The\nring is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam and its equilibrium equations are\nderived from the mechanical energy which takes into account both stretching and\nbending contributions. The curvature of the substrate is considered explicitly\nto model the work done by its reaction force on the ring. We distinguish two\ndifferent instabilities: periodic wrinkling of the ring or global buckling of\nthe structure. Our model provides an expression for the critical pressure, as\nwell as a phase diagram that rationalizes the transition between instability\nmodes. Towards assessing the role of curvature, we compare our results for the\ncritical stress and the wrinkling wavelength to their planar counterparts. We\nshow that the critical stress is insensitive to the curvature of the substrate,\nwhile the wavelength is only affected due to the permissible discrete values of\nthe azimuthal wavenumber imposed by the geometry of the problem. Throughout, we\ncontrast our analytical predictions against finite element simulations.\n", "  Equilibrium charge state distributions of stable 60Ni, 59Co, and 63Cu beams\npassing through a 1um thick Mo foil were measured at beam energies of 1.84\nMeV/u, 2.09 MeV/u, and 2.11 MeV/u respectively. A 1-D position sensitive\nParallel Grid Avalanche Counter detector (PGAC) was used at the exit of a\nspectrograph magnet, enabling us to measure the intensity of several charge\nstates simultaneously. The number of charge states measured for each beam\nconstituted more than 99% of the total equilibrium charge state distribution\nfor that elements. Currently, little experimental data exists for equilibrium\ncharge state distributions for heavy ions with 19<Zp,Zt<54 (Zp and Zt, are the\nprojectile's and target's atomic numbers respectively). Hence the success of\nthe semi-empirical models in predicting typical characteristics of equilibrium\nCSDs (mean charge states and distribution widths), has not been thoroughly\ntested at the energy region of interest. A number of semi-empirical models from\nthe literature were evaluated in this study, regarding their ability to\nreproduce the characteristics of the measured charge state distributions. The\nevaluated models were selected from the literature based on whether they are\nsuitable for the given range of atomic numbers and on their frequent use by the\nnuclear physics community. Finally, an attempt was made to combine model\npredictions for the mean charge state, the distribution width and the\ndistribution shape, to come up with a more reliable model. We discuss this new\n\"combinatorial\" prescription and compare its results with our experimental data\nand with calculations using the other semi-empirical models studied in this\nwork.\n", "  Research suggests that students often have difficulty transferring their\nlearning from one context to another. We examine upper-level undergraduate and\ngraduate students' facility with questions about the interference pattern in\nthe double-slit experiment (DSE) with single photons and polarizers of various\norientations placed in front of one or both slits. Before answering these types\nof questions, students had worked through a tutorial on the Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer (MZI) in which they learned about interference of single photons\nwhen polarizers of various orientations are placed in the two paths of the MZI.\nAfter working on the MZI tutorial, students were asked similar questions in the\nisomorphic context of the DSE. We discuss the extent to which they were able to\ntransfer what they learned in the context of the MZI to analogous problems in\nthe isomorphic context of the DSE.\n", "  We consider the scattering of entangled two-photon states from collections of\nsmall particles. We also study the related Mie problem of scattering from a\nsphere. In both cases, we calculate the entropy of entanglement and investigate\nthe influence of the entanglement of the incident field on the entanglement of\nthe scattered field.\n", "  Three loop ladder and $V$-topology diagrams contributing to the massive\noperator matrix element $A_{Qg}$ are calculated. The corresponding objects can\nall be expressed in terms of nested sums and recurrences depending on the\nMellin variable $N$ and the dimensional parameter $\\varepsilon$. Given these\nrepresentations, the desired Laurent series expansions in $\\varepsilon$ can be\nobtained with the help of our computer algebra toolbox. Here we rely on\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions and Mellin-Barnes representations, on\ndifference ring algorithms for symbolic summation, on an optimized version of\nthe multivariate Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm for symbolic integration, and on\nnew methods to calculate Laurent series solutions of coupled systems of\ndifferential equations. The solutions can be computed for general coefficient\nmatrices directly for any basis also performing the expansion in the\ndimensional parameter in case it is expressible in terms of indefinite nested\nproduct-sum expressions. This structural result is based on new results of our\ndifference ring theory. In the cases discussed we deal with iterative sum- and\nintegral-solutions over general alphabets. The final results are expressed in\nterms of special sums, forming quasi-shuffle algebras, such as nested harmonic\nsums, generalized harmonic sums, and nested binomially weighted (cyclotomic)\nsums. Analytic continuations to complex values of $N$ are possible through the\nrecursion relations obeyed by these quantities and their analytic asymptotic\nexpansions. The latter lead to a host of new constants beyond the multiple zeta\nvalues, the infinite generalized harmonic and cyclotomic sums in the case of\n$V$-topologies.\n", "  Fermions and bosons are fundamental realizations of exchange statistics,\nwhich governs the probability for two particles being close to each other\nspatially. Anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect are an example for\nexchange statistics intermediate between bosons and fermions. We analyze a\nmesoscopic setup in which two dilute beams of anyons collide with each other,\nand relate the correlations of current fluctuations to the probability of\nparticles excluding each other spatially. While current correlations for\nfermions vanish, negative correlations for anyons are a clear signature of a\nreduced spatial exclusion as compared to fermions.\n", "  We calculate dispersion relations for $\\bar{D}(0^-)$, $\\bar{D}^*(1^-)$,\n$\\bar{D}_0^*(0^+)$ and $\\bar{D}_1(1^+)$ mesons in the Dual Chiral Density Wave\n(DCDW) where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by inhomogeneous\nchiral condensate. Employing the Bloch's theorem, we show that all the modes\nhave opposite group velocity to the momentum in the low-momentum region and the\nenergy is minimized at non-zero momentum. Furthermore, the magnitude of\nmomentum which realizes the minimum energy is equal to the wave number of the\ndensity wave.\n", "  Quantum discord as a measure of the quantum correlations cannot be easily\ncomputed for most of density operators. In this paper, we present a measure of\nthe total quantum correlations that is operationally simple and can be computed\neffectively for an arbitrary mixed state of a multipartite system. The measure\nis based on the coherence vector of the party whose quantumness is investigated\nas well as the correlation matrix of this part with the remainder of the\nsystem. Being able to detect the quantumness of multipartite systems, such as\ndetecting the quantum critical points in spin chains, alongside with the\ncomputability characteristic of the measure, make it a useful indicator to be\nexploited in the cases which are out of the scope of the other known measures.\n", "  The biological function of proteins is encoded in their structure and\nexpressed through the mediation of their dynamics. Local fluctuations are known\nto initiate biologically relevant pathways as they cooperatively enhance the\ndynamics in specific regions in the protein. Those biologically active regions\nprovide energetically-comparable conformational states that can be trapped by a\nreacting partner. We analyze this mechanism as we calculate the dynamics of\nmonomeric and dimerized HIV protease, and free Insulin Growth Factor II\nReceptor (IGF2R) domain 11 and its IGF2R:IGF2 complex. We adopt a newly\ndeveloped coarse-grained model, the Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics\n(LE4PD), which predicts dynamical relevant mechanisms with high accuracy. Both\nsimulation-derived and experimental NMR conformers are the input structural\nensembles for the LE4PD. The use of the experimental NMR conformers requires\nminimal computational resources.\n", "  An {\\em ab initio} (i.e., from first principles) theoretical framework\ncapable of providing a unified description of the structure and low-energy\nreaction properties of light nuclei is desirable to further our understanding\nof the fundamental interactions among nucleons, and provide accurate\npredictions of crucial reaction rates for nuclear astrophysics, fusion-energy\nresearch, and other applications. In this contribution we review {\\em ab\ninitio} calculations for nucleon and deuterium scattering on light nuclei\nstarting from chiral two- and three-body Hamiltonians, obtained within the\nframework of the {\\em ab initio} no-core shell model with continuum. This is a\nunified approach to nuclear bound and scattering states, in which\nsquare-integrable energy eigenstates of the $A$-nucleon system are coupled to\n$(A-a)+a$ target-plus-projectile wave functions in the spirit of the resonating\ngroup method to obtain an efficient description of the many-body nuclear\ndynamics both at short and medium distances and at long ranges.\n", "  We present the package GravitinoPack that calculates the two- and three-body\ndecays of unstable supersymmetric particles involving the gravitino in the\nfinal or initial state. In a previous paper, we already showed results for the\ngravitino decays into two and three particles. In this paper, we incorporate\nthe processes where an unstable neutralino, stau or stop decays into a\ngravitino and Standard Model particles. This is the case in gravitino dark\nmatter supersymmetric models, where the gravitino is the lightest SUSY\nparticle. We give instructions for the installation and the use of the package.\nIn the numerical analysis, we discuss various MSSM scenarios. We show that the\ncalculation of all the decay channels and the three-body decay branching ratios\nis essential for the accurate application of cosmological bounds on these\nmodels.\n", "  In this work we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a single\ncorrelated layer attached to two metallic leads, with particular focus on the\nlow-energy physics. A steady state current is driven across the layer by\napplying a bias voltage between the leads. Extending previous work we introduce\na nonzero temperature in the leads, which enables us to study the influence of\nquasiparticle excitations on the transport characteristics in detail. Even\nthough the system is clearly three dimensional we obtain current-voltage curves\nthat closely resemble those of single quantum dots. Furthermore, a splitting of\nthe quasiparticle excitation with bias voltage is observed in the spectral\nfunction.\n", "  In the standard model (SM), lepton flavor violating (LFV) Higgs decay is\nabsent at renormalizable level and thus it is a good probe to new physics. In\nthis article we study a type of new physics that could lead to large LFV Higgs\ndecay, i.e., a lepton-flavored dark matter (DM) model which is specified by a\nMajorana DM and scalar lepton mediators. Different from other similar models\nwith similar setup, we introduce both left-handed and right-handed scalar\nleptons. They allow large LFV Higgs decay and thus may explain the tentative\nBr$(h\\ra\\tau\\mu)\\sim1\\%$ experimental results from the LHC. In particular, we\nfind that the stringent bound from $\\tau\\ra\\mu\\gamma$ can be naturally evaded.\nOne reason, among others, is a large chirality violation in the mediator\nsector. Aspects of relic density and especially radiative direct detection of\nthe leptonic DM are also investigated, stressing the difference from previous\nlepton-flavored DM models.\n", "  Universal dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to\nunderstanding the universal behavior of spontaneous defect formation in various\nsystem from the early universe, condensed-matter systems to ultracold atomic\nsystems. We explore the universal real-time dynamics in an array of coupled\nbinary atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, which undergo a\nspontaneous symmetry breaking from the symmetric Rabi oscillation to the\nbroken-symmetry self-trapping. In addition to Goldstone modes, there exist\ngapped Higgs mode whose excitation gap vanishes at the critical point. In the\nslow passage through the critical point, we analytically find that the\nsymmetry-breaking dynamics obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. From the scalings\nof bifurcation delay and domain formation, we numerically extract two\nKibble-Zurek exponents $b_{1}=\\nu/(1+\\nu z)$ and $b_{2}=1/(1+\\nu z)$, which\ngive the static correlation-length critical exponent $\\nu$ and the dynamic\ncritical exponent $z$. Our approach provides an efficient way to simultaneous\ndetermination of the critical exponents $\\nu$ and $z$ for a continuous phase\ntransition.\n", "  We propose a realistic scheme to quantum simulate the so-far experimentally\nunobserved topological Mott insulator phase -- an interaction-driven\ntopological insulator -- using cold atoms in an optical Lieb lattice. To this\nend, we study a system of spinless fermions in a Lieb lattice, exhibiting\nrepulsive nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions, and derive the\nassociated zero temperature phase diagram within mean-field approximation. In\nparticular, we analyze how the interactions can dynamically generate a charge\ndensity wave ordered, a nematic as well as a topologically non-trivial quantum\nanomalous Hall phase. We characterize the topology of the different phases by\nthe Chern number and discuss the possibility of phase coexistence. Based on the\nidentified phases, we propose a realistic implementation of this model using\ncold Rydberg-dressed atoms in an optical lattice. The scheme, which allows one\nto access in particular the topological Mott insulator phase, robustly and\nindependently of its exact position in parameter space, merely requires global,\nalways-on off-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states and is feasible with\nstate-of-the-art experimental techniques.\n", "  The hadronic mechanism which leads to chiral symmetry restoration is explored\nin the context of the rho-pi-a_1 system using Massive Yang-Mills, a hadronic\neffective theory which governs their microscopic interactions. In this\napproach, vector and axial-vector mesons are implemented as gauge bosons of a\nlocal chiral gauge group. We have previously shown that this model can describe\nthe experimentally measured vector and axial-vector spectral functions in\nvacuum. Here, we carry the analysis to finite temperatures by evaluating medium\neffects in a pion gas and calculating thermal spectral functions. We find that\nthe spectral peaks in both channels broaden along with a noticeable downward\nmass shift in the a_1 spectral peak and negligible movement of the rho peak.\nThe approach toward spectral function degeneracy is accompanied by a reduction\nof chiral order parameters, i.e., the pion decay constant and scalar\ncondensate. Our findings suggest a mechanism where the chiral mass splitting\ninduced in vacuum is burned off. We explore this mechanism and identify future\ninvestigations which can further test it.\n", "  We propose a new amplification regime based on synchronous operation of four\ndegenerate electromagnetic (EM) modes in a slow-wave structure and the electron\nbeam, referred to as super synchronization. These four EM modes arise in a\nFabry-Perot cavity (FPC) when degenerate band edge (DBE) condition is\nsatisfied. The modes interact constructively with the electron beam resulting\nin superior amplification. In particular, much larger gains are achieved for\nsmaller beam currents compared to conventional structures based on\nsynchronization with only a single EM mode. We demonstrate giant gain scaling\nwith respect to the length of the slow-wave structure compared to conventional\nPierce type single mode traveling wave tube amplifiers. We construct a coupled\ntransmission line (CTL) model for a loaded waveguide slow-wave structure\nexhibiting a DBE, and investigate the phenomenon of giant gain via super\nsynchronization using the Pierce model generalized to multimode interaction.\n", "  Optical computing accelerators may help alleviate bandwidth and power\nconsumption bottlenecks in electronics. We show an approach to implementing\nlogarithmic-type analog co-processors in silicon photonics and use it to\nperform the exponentiation operation. The function is realized by exploiting\nnonlinear-absorption-enhanced Raman amplification saturation in a silicon\nwaveguide.\n", "  The interplay between an open quantum system and its environment can lead to\nboth coherent and incoherent behaviour. We explore the extent to which strong\ncoupling to a single bosonic mode can alter the coherence properties of a\ntwo-level system in a structured environment. This mode is treated exactly,\nwith the rest of the environment comprising a Markovian bath of bosonic modes.\nThe strength of the coupling between the two-level system and the single mode\nis varied for a variety of different forms for the bath spectral density in\norder to assess whether the coherent dynamics of the two-level system are\nmodified. We find a clear renormalisation of the site population oscillation\nfrequency that causes an altered interaction with the bath. This leads to\nenhanced or reduced coherent behaviour of the two-level system depending on the\nform of the spectral density function. We present an intuitive interpretation,\nbased on an analytical model, to explain the behaviour.\n", "  The refined similarity hypotheses of Kolmogorov, regarded as an important\ningredient of intermittent turbulence, has been tested in the past using\none-dimensional data and plausible surrogates of energy dissipation. We employ\ndata from direct numerical simulations, at the microscale Reynolds number\n$R_\\lambda \\sim 650$, on a periodic box of $4096^3$ grid points to test the\nhypotheses using 3D averages. In particular, we study the small-scale\nproperties of the stochastic variable $V = \\Delta u(r)/(r \\epsilon_r)^{1/3}$,\nwhere $\\Delta u(r)$ is the longitudinal velocity increment and $\\epsilon_r$ is\nthe dissipation rate averaged over a three-dimensional volume of linear size\n$r$. We show that $V$ is universal in the inertial subrange. In the dissipation\nrange, the statistics of $V$ are shown to depend solely on a local Reynolds\nnumber.\n", "  The time-dynamics of quantum correlations in the quantum transverse\nanisotropic XY spin chain of infinite length is studied at zero as well as\nfinite temperatures. The evolution occurs due to the instantaneous quenching of\nthe coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is\neither performed within the same phase or across the quantum phase transition\npoint connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the\ntime-evolved quantum correlations, entanglement and quantum discord, which\nexhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching\nscheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced bipartite quantum\ncorrelations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from ordered\nto the deep disordered phase. However, bipartite quantum correlations are\nalmost washed out when the system is quenched from disordered to the ordered\nphase with the initial state being at the zero-temperature. Moreover, we\nidentify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations\nwhen the system is quenched within the same phase. Finally, we investigate the\nbipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium\nstate with finite temperature which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation\non the phenomena observed at zero-temperature.\n", "  We demonstrate a centimeter-scale optomechanical magnetometer based on a\ncrystalline whispering gallery mode resonator. The large size of the resonator\nallows high magnetic field sensitivity to be achieved in the hertz to kilohertz\nfrequency range. A peak sensitivity of 131 pT per root Hz is reported, in a\nmagnetically unshielded non-cryogenic environment and using optical power\nlevels beneath 100 microWatt. Femtotesla range sensitivity may be possible in\nfuture devices with further optimization of laser noise and the physical\nstructure of the resonator, allowing applications in high-performance\nmagnetometry.\n", "  The linear Boltzmann equation with constant coefficients in the\nthree-dimensional infinite space is revisited. It is known that the Green's\nfunction can be calculated via the Fourier transform in the case of isotropic\nscattering. In this paper, we show that the three-dimensional Green's function\ncan be computed with the Fourier transform even in the case of arbitrary\nanisotropic scattering.\n", "  In this work, the photoproduction of $a_{2}(1320)$ off a proton target is\ninvestigated within an effective Lagrangian approach and the Regge model. The\ntheoretical result indicates that the shapes of {the} total and differential\ncross sections of the $\\gamma p\\rightarrow a_{2}^{+}n$ reaction within the\nFeynman (isobar) model are much different from that of the Reggeized treatment.\nThe obtained cross section is compared with the existing experimental results\nat low energies. The $a_{2}(1320)$ production cross section at high energies\ncan be tested by the COMPASS experiment, which can provide important\ninformation for clarifying the role of the Reggeized treatment at that energy\nrange.\n", "  We propose a theory of metals at the spin-density wave quantum critical point\nin spatial dimension $d=2$. We provide a first estimate of the full set of\ncritical exponents (dynamical exponent $z=2.13$, correlation length $\\nu\n=1.02$, spin susceptibility $\\gamma = 0.96$, electronic non-Fermi liquid\n$\\eta^f_\\tau = 0.53$, spin-wave Landau damping $\\eta^b_\\tau = 1.06$), which\ndetermine the universal power-laws in thermodynamics and response functions in\nthe quantum-critical regime relevant for experiments in heavy-fermion systems\nand iron pnictides. We present approximate numerical and analytical solutions\nof Polchinski-Wetterich type flow equations with soft frequency regulators for\nan effective action of electrons coupled to spin-wave bosons. Performing the\nrenormalization group in frequency -instead of momentum- space allows to track\nchanges of the Fermi surface shape and to capture Landau damping during the\nflow. The technique is easily generalizable from models retaining only patches\nof the Fermi surface to full, compact Fermi surfaces.\n", "  We obtain a class of elliptic wave solutions of coupled nonlinear Helmholtz\n(CNLH) equations describing nonparaxial ultra-broad beam propagation in\nnonlinear Kerr-like media, in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions and also\ndiscuss their limiting forms (hyperbolic solutions). Especially, we show the\nexistence of non-trivial solitary wave profiles in the CNLH system. The effect\nof nonparaxiality on the speed, pulse width and amplitude of the nonlinear\nwaves is analysed in detail. Particularly a mechanism for tuning the speed by\naltering the nonparaxial parameter is proposed. We also identify a novel\nphase-unlocking behaviour due to the presence of nonparaxial parameter.\n", "  Lyapunov exponents of dynamical systems are defined from the rates of\ndivergence of nearby trajectories. For stochastic systems, one typically\nassumes that these trajectories are generated under the \"same noise\nrealization\". The purpose of this work is to critically examine what this\nexpression means. For Brownian particles, we consider two natural\ninterpretations of the noise: intrinsic to the particles or stemming from the\nfluctuations of the environment. We show how they lead to different\ndistributions of the largest Lyapunov exponent as well as different fluctuating\nhydrodynamics for the collective density field. We discuss, both at microscopic\nand macroscopic levels, the limits in which these noise prescriptions become\nequivalent. We close this paper by providing an estimate of the largest\nLyapunov exponent and of its fluctuations for interacting particles evolving\nwith the Dean-Kawasaki dynamics.\n", "  Asymptotic freedom of gluons is described in terms of a family of\nscale-dependent renormalized Hamiltonian operators acting in the Fock space.\nThe Hamiltonians are obtained by applying the renormalization group procedure\nfor effective particles to quantum Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We discuss properties of three-particle Dalitz distributions in coupled\nchannel systems in presence of triangle singularities. The single channel case\nwas discussed long ago where it was found that as a consequence of unitarity,\neffects of a triangle singularity seen in the Dalitz plot are not seen in\nDalitz plot projections. In the coupled channel case we find the same is true\nfor the sum of intensities of all interacting channels. Unlike the single\nchannel case, however, triangle singularities do remain visible in Dalitz plot\nprojections of individual channels.\n", "  We review the progress of nonmagnetic impurity doping study on the Fe-based\nsuperconductors. On the theoretical side, two highly potential candidates for\nthe pairing symmetry order parameter, i.e. the multi-gap s++ and s+- wave\nmodels, have been proposed but continuously debated. The debate arises because\nof the complex gap structure, exceptive magnetic and metallic behaviors of\nFe-based superconductors which may make the influences of nonmagnetic defects\nvaried in chemical potential, impurity disorder, inter- and intra-band\nscattering strength, and electron localization, and hence difficulty in\ndirectly obtaining the most important information for understanding the\nsymmetry order parameter. Experimentally, the nonmagnetic impurity substitution\nstudy has been widely carried out, which has provided very useful insights. We\nreview herein the various nonmagnetic impurity doping experiments, including\nthe controlled defects within the superconducting Fe2X2 planes through samples\nquality improvement, a single impurity effects on the electronic state and\nlocal moment, the magnetic response of the Fe2X2 planes both on macroscopic\nscale as antiferromagnetic state and local scale of moment, as well as the\nsignificant effect in modifying the transport properties. The experiments\nenable us to qualitatively analyze the nonmagnetic impurities effects on the\nsuperconducting state for many Fe-based superconductors. We also propose herein\nsome strategies for the nonmagnetic impurity doping study. As an important\nmodel for explaining the nonmagnetic impurities doping effects, the\npair-breaking model is compared with various theoretical approaches via\nanalyzing the pair-breaking rates of various Fe-superconductors.\n", "  RX~J1713.7$-$3946 is a prototype in the $\\gamma$-ray-bright supernova\nremnants (SNRs) and is in continuing debates on its hadronic versus leptonic\norigin of the $\\gamma$-ray emission. We explore the role played by the\ndiffusive relativistic protons that escape from the SNR shock wave in the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission, apart from the high-energy particles' emission from the\ninside of the SNR. In the scenario that the SNR shock propagates in a clumpy\nmolecular cavity, we consider that the$\\gamma$-ray emission from the inside of\nthe SNR may arise either from the inverse Compton scattering or from the\ninteraction between the trapped energetic protons and the shocked clumps. The\ndominant origin between them depends on the electron-to-proton number ratio.\nThe diffusive protons that escaped from the shock wave during the expansion\nhistory can provide an outer hadronic $\\gamma$-ray component by bombarding the\nsurrounding dense matter. The broadband spectrum can be well explained by this\ntwo-zone model, in which the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the inside governs the\nTeV band, while the outer emission component substantially contributes to the\nGeV $\\gamma$-rays. The two-zone model can also explain the TeV $\\gamma$-ray\nradial brightness profile that significantly stretches beyond the nonthermal\nX-ray-emitting region. In the calculation, we present a simplified algorithm\nfor Li & Chen's (2010) \"accumulative diffusion\" model for escaping protons and\napply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the physical parameters.\n", "  We consider soft gluon emission corrections to the production of a\ntop-antitop pair in association with a Higgs boson at hadron colliders. In\nparticular, we present a soft-gluon resummation formula for this production\nprocess and gather all elements needed to evaluate it at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order. We employ these results to obtain\napproximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) formulas, and implement them\nin a bespoke parton-level Monte Carlo program which can be used to calculate\nthe total cross section along with arbitrary differential distributions. We use\nthis tool to study the phenomenological impact of the approximate NNLO\ncorrections, finding that they increase the total cross section and the\ndifferential distributions which we evaluated in this work.\n", "  The interplay of the relativistic and correlation effects in the permanent\nelectric dipole moments (PDMs) of the X2{\\Sigma}+ ({\\nu} = 0) electronic ground\nstates of the alkaline earth monoflourides (BeF, MgF, CaF, SrF and BaF) has\nbeen studied using a relativistic coupled cluster method (RCCM). The\ncalculations were carried out using double, triple and quadruple zeta basis\nsets, and with no core orbitals frozen. The results are compared with those of\nother calculations available in the literature and with experiments. The\ncorrelation trends in the PDMs of these molecules are discussed in detail.\n", "  We calculate the two-point function of the trace of the stress tensor in\nholographic renormalization group flows between pairs of conformal field\ntheories. We show that the term proportional to the momentum squared in this\ncorrelator gives the change of the central charge between fixed points in d=2\nand in d>2 it gives the holographic entanglement entropy for a planar region.\nThis can also be seen as a holographic realization of the Adler-Zee formula for\nthe renormalization of Newton's constant. Holographic regularization is found\nto provide a perfect match of the finite and divergent terms of the sum rule,\nand it is analogous to the regularization of the entropy in terms of mutual\ninformation. Finally, we provide a general proof of reflection positivity in\nterms of stability of the dual bulk action, and discuss the relation between\nunitarity constraints, the null energy condition and regularity in the interior\nof the gravity solution.\n", "  We compare and contrast the entangling properties of a three-well\nBose-Hubbard model and an optical beamsplitter. The coupling between the\ndifferent modes is linear in both cases, and we may identify two output modes.\nObvious differences are that our Bose-Hubbard model, with only the middle well\ninitially occupied, does not have a vacuum input port, there is no equivalent\nof a collisional, $\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity with the beamsplitter, and the\nresults of the Bose-Hubbard model show a time-dependence. In the\nnon-interacting case, we obtain analytic solutions and show that, like a\nbeamsplitter, the Bose-Hubbard system will not produce entanglement for\nclassical initial states. We also show that whether inseparability or\nentanglement are detected depends sensitively on the criteria measured, with\ndifferent criteria giving contradictory predictions.\n", "  In this contribution we review and clarify the arguments which might allow\nthe interpretation of the isoscalar monopole resonance of $^4$He as a\ncollective breathing mode.\n", "  We consider a simple one dimensional stochastic model of heat transport which\nlocally conserves both energy and momentum and which is coupled to heat\nreservoirs with different temperatures at its two ends. The steady state is\nanalyzed and the model is found to obey the Fourier law with finite heat\nconductivity. In the infinite length limit, the steady state is described\nlocally by an equilibrium Gibbs state. However finite size corrections to this\nlocal equilibrium state are present. We analyze these finite size corrections\nby calculating the on-site fluctuations of the momentum and the two point\ncorrelation of the momentum and energy. These correlations are long ranged and\nhave scaling forms which are computed explicitly. We also introduce a\nmulti-lane variant of the model in which correlations vanish in the steady\nstate. The deviation from local equilibrium in this model as expressed in terms\nof the on-site momentum fluctuations is calculated in the large length limit.\n", "  Treating $(d,p)$ reactions in a Faddeev-AGS framework requires the\ninteractions in the sub-systems as input. We derived separable representations\nfor the neutron- and proton-nucleus interactions from phenomenological global\noptical potentials. In order to take into account excitations of the nucleus,\nexcitations need to be included explicity, leading to a coupled-channel\nseparable representation of the optical potential.\n", "  The (2,0) (3,0) and (4,0) bands of the A$^1\\Pi-$X$^1\\Sigma^+$ system of\n$^{12}$C$^{16}$O have been re-investigated by high-resolution vacuum\nultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. A VUV Fourier-transform spectrometer,\nilluminated by synchrotron radiation, was applied to record a jet-cooled\nspectrum, a room temperature static gas spectrum and a high temperature (900 K)\nquasi-static gas spectrum, resulting in absolute accuracies of 0.01$-$0.02\ncm$^{-1}$ for the rotational line frequencies. Precise laser-based data were\nincluded in the analysis allowing for a highly accurate determination of band\norigins. Rotational levels up to $J=52$ were observed. The data were used to\nperform an improved analysis of the perturbations in the A$^1\\Pi$, $v=2$,\n$v=3$, and $v=4$ levels by vibrational levels of the D$^1\\Delta$,\nI$^1\\Sigma^-$, e$^3\\Sigma^-$, d$^3\\Delta$, and a$'^3\\Sigma^+$ states.\n", "  We study unitary conformal field theories with a unique stress tensor and at\nleast one higher-spin conserved current in d>3 dimensions. We prove that every\nsuch theory contains an infinite number of higher-spin conserved currents of\narbitrarily high spin, and that Ward identities generated by the conserved\ncharges of these currents imply that the correlators of the stress tensor and\nthe conserved currents of the theory must coincide with one of the following\nthree possibilities: a) a theory of n free bosons (for some integer n), b) a\ntheory of n free fermions, or c) a theory of n (d-2)/2-forms. For d even, all\nthree structures exist, but for d odd, it may be the case that the third\nstructure (c) does not; if it does exist, it is unclear what theory, if any,\nrealizes it. This is a generalization of the result proved in three dimensions\nby Maldacena and Zhiboedov [arXiv:1112.1016]. This paper supersedes the\nprevious paper by the authors [arXiv:1307.8092]\n", "  The $\\gamma^\\ast \\gamma \\to \\pi^0$ transition form factor, $G(Q^2)$, is\ncomputed on the entire domain of spacelike momenta using a continuum approach\nto the two valence-body bound-state problem in relativistic quantum field\ntheory: the result agrees with data obtained by the CELLO, CLEO and Belle\nCollaborations. The analysis unifies this prediction with that of the pion's\nvalence-quark parton distribution amplitude (PDA) and elastic electromagnetic\nform factor, and demonstrates, too, that a fully self-consistent treatment can\nreadily connect a pion PDA that is a broad, concave function at the hadronic\nscale with the perturbative QCD prediction for the transition form factor in\nthe hard photon limit. The normalisation of that limit is set by the scale of\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking, which is a crucial feature of the Standard\nModel. Understanding of the latter will thus remain incomplete until definitive\ntransition form factor data is available on $Q^2>10\\,$GeV$^2$.\n", "  Advanced ACTPol is a polarization-sensitive upgrade for the 6 m aperture\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), adding new frequencies and increasing\nsensitivity over the previous ACTPol receiver. In 2016, Advanced ACTPol will\nbegin to map approximately half the sky in five frequency bands (28-230 GHz).\nIts maps of primary and secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies -- imaged in intensity and polarization at few arcminute-scale\nresolution -- will enable precision cosmological constraints and also a wide\narray of cross-correlation science that probes the expansion history of the\nuniverse and the growth of structure via gravitational collapse. To accomplish\nthese scientific goals, the Advanced ACTPol receiver will be a significant\nupgrade to the ACTPol receiver, including four new multichroic arrays of\ncryogenic, feedhorn-coupled AlMn transition edge sensor (TES) polarimeters\n(fabricated on 150 mm diameter wafers); a system of continuously rotating\nmeta-material silicon half-wave plates; and a new multiplexing readout\narchitecture which uses superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)\nand time division to achieve a 64-row multiplexing factor. Here we present the\nstatus and scientific goals of the Advanced ACTPol instrument, emphasizing the\ndesign and implementation of the Advanced ACTPol cryogenic detector arrays.\n", "  Starting from a quantum dilogarithm over a Pontryagin self-dual LCA group\n$A$, we construct an operator solution of the Yang-Baxter equation generalizing\nthe solution of the Faddeev-Volkov model. Based on a specific choice of a\nsubgroup $B\\subset A$ and by using the Weil transformation, we also give a new\nnon-operator interpretation of the Yang-Baxter relation. That allows us to\nconstruct a lattice QFT-model of IRF-type with gauge invariance under\nindependent $B$-translations of local `spin' variables.\n", "  We study the refined topological string partition function of a class of\ntoric elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. These Calabi-Yau threefolds\ngive rise to five dimensional quiver gauge theories and are dual to\nconfigurations of M5-M2-branes. We determine the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for\nthese threefolds and show that the genus $g$ free energy is given by the weight\n$2g$ Eisenstein series. We also show that although the free energy at all\ngenera are modular invariant the full partition function satisfies the\nnon-perturbative modular transformation property discussed by Lockhart and Vafa\nin arXiv:1210.5909 and therefore the modularity of free energy is up to\nnon-perturbative corrections.\n", "  We interpret multi-partite genuine entanglement witnesses as simultaneous\npositivity of various maps arising from them. We apply this result to\nmulti-qubit {\\sf X}-shaped Hermitian matrices, and characterize the conditions\nfor them to be genuine entanglement witnesses, in terms of entries.\nFurthermore, we find all optimal ones among them. They turn out to have the\nspanning properties, and so they detect non-zero volume set of multi-qubit\ngenuine entanglement. We also characterize decomposability for {\\sf X}-shaped\nentanglement witnesses.\n", "  In many areas of research it is interesting how lattices can be filled with\nparticles that have no nearest neighbors, or they are in limited quantities.\nExamples may be found in statistical physics, chemistry, materials science,\ndiscrete mathematics, etc. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation we study the\nkinetics of filling of square lattice (2D). Two complementary rules are used to\nfill the lattice. We study their influence on the kinetics of the process as\nwell as on the properties of the obtained systems. According to the first rule\nthe occupied sites may not share edges (nearest neighbors occupations are not\npermitted). Under this condition, the maximum possible concentration is 0.5,\nforming a checkerboard type structure. However, we found that if the deposition\nis done by random selection of sites the concentration of 0.5 is inaccessible\nand the maximum concentration is Cmax(2D)=0.3638 (0.0003) for 2D lattice. If\nthe lattice is 3D we find that the maximal concentration is even lower\nCmax(3D)=0.326 (0.001). The second rule establishes permission to break the\nfirst one with certain probability 0<=p<=1, thus the occupied sites can start\nto share edges when p>0. In this case higher then 0.3638 concentrations are\naccessible, even up to C=1. Therefore the percolation threshold Pc can be\nreached. Its value depends on the value of the probability p. Our model\ndescribes the kinetics of formation of thin films of particles attracted by the\nsubstrate but repulsing each other.\n", "  We report the experimental realization of a single-atom heat engine. An ion\nis confined in a linear Paul trap with tapered geometry and driven thermally by\ncoupling it alternately to hot and cold reservoirs. The output power of the\nengine is used to drive a harmonic oscillation. From direct measurements of the\nion dynamics, we determine the thermodynamic cycles for various temperature\ndifferences of the reservoirs. We use these cycles to evaluate power $P$ and\nefficiency $\\eta$ of the engine, obtaining up to $P=342\\,$yJ and $\\eta=0.28\n\\,\\%$, consistent with analytical estimations. Our results demonstrate that\nthermal machines can be reduced to the ultimate limit of single atoms.\n", "  We revisit a special model of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, the\n\"R-invariant direct gauge mediation.\" We pay particular attention to whether\nthe model is consistent with the minimal model of the \\mu-term, i.e., a simple\nmass term of the Higgs doublets in the superpotential. Although the\nincompatibility is highlighted in view of the current experimental constraints\non the superparticle masses and the observed Higgs boson mass, the minimal\n\\mu-term can be consistent with the R-invariant gauge mediation model via a\ncareful choice of model parameters. We derive an upper limit on the gluino mass\nfrom the observed Higgs boson mass. We also discuss whether the model can\nexplain the 3\\sigma excess of the Z+jets+$E_T^{\\rm miss}$ events reported by\nthe ATLAS Collaboration.\n", "  We propose a new concept of an electron source for ultrafast electron\ndiffraction with sub-10~fs temporal resolution. Electrons are generated in a\nlaser-plasma accelerator, able to deliver femtosecond electron bunches at 5 MeV\nenergy with kHz repetition rate. The possibility of producing this electron\nsource is demonstrated using Particle-In-Cell simulations. We then use particle\ntracking simulations to show that this electron beam can be transported and\nmanipulated in a realistic beamline, in order to reach parameters suitable for\nelectron diffraction. The beamline consists of realistic static magnetic optics\nand introduces no temporal jitter. We demonstrate numerically that electron\nbunches with 5~fs duration and containing 1.5~fC per bunch can be produced,\nwith a transverse coherence length exceeding 2~nm, as required for electron\ndiffraction.\n", "  We develop a new computing paradigm, which we refer to as data-driven\ncomputing, according to which calculations are carried out directly from\nexperimental material data and pertinent constraints and conservation laws,\nsuch as compatibility and equilibrium, thus bypassing the empirical material\nmodeling step of conventional computing altogether. Data-driven solvers seek to\nassign to each material point the state from a prespecified data set that is\nclosest to satisfying the conservation laws. Equivalently, data-driven solvers\naim to find the state satisfying the conservation laws that is closest to the\ndata set. The resulting data-driven problem thus consists of the minimization\nof a distance function to the data set in phase space subject to constraints\nintroduced by the conservation laws. We motivate the data-driven paradigm and\ninvestigate the performance of data-driven solvers by means of two examples of\napplication, namely, the static equilibrium of nonlinear three-dimensional\ntrusses and linear elasticity. In these tests, the data-driven solvers exhibit\ngood convergence properties both with respect to the number of data points and\nwith regard to local data assignment. The variational structure of the\ndata-driven problem also renders it amenable to analysis. We show that, as the\ndata set approximates increasingly closely a classical material law in phase\nspace, the data-driven solutions converge to the classical solution. We also\nillustrate the robustness of data-driven solvers with respect to spatial\ndiscretization. In particular, we show that the data-driven solutions of\nfinite-element discretizations of linear elasticity converge jointly with\nrespect to mesh size and approximation by the data set.\n", "  We study general aspects of the CP-violating effects on the baryon asymmetry\nof the Universe (BAU) and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in models extended by\nan extra Higgs doublet and a singlet, together with electroweak-interacting\nfermions. In particular, the emphasis is on the structure of the CP-violating\ninteractions and dependences of the BAU and EDMs on masses of the relevant\nparticles. In a concrete mode, we investigate a relationship between the BAU\nand the electron EDM for a typical parameter set. As long as the BAU-related CP\nviolation predominantly exists, the electron EDM has a strong power in probing\nelectroweak baryogenesis. However, once a BAU-unrelated CP violation comes into\nplay, the direct correlation between the BAU and electron EDM can be lost. Even\nin such a case, we point out that verifiability of the scenario still remains\nwith the help of Higgs physics.\n", "  We explore the indirect sensitivities to decoupled new physics of prospective\nprecision electroweak measurements, triple-gauge-coupling measurements and\nHiggs physics at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, with emphasis on the ILC250 and\nFCC-ee. The Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT) is adopted as a\nmodel-independent approach for relating experimental precision projections to\nthe scale of new physics, and we present prospective constraints on the Wilson\ncoefficients of dimension-6 operators. We find that in a marginalised fit\nILC250 EWPT measurements may be sensitive to new physics scales $\\Lambda =\n\\mathcal{O}(10)$~TeV, and FCC-ee EWPT measurements may be sensitive to $\\Lambda\n= \\mathcal{O}(30)$~TeV. The prospective sensitivities of Higgs and TGC\nmeasurements at the ILC250 (FCC-ee) are to $\\Lambda = \\mathcal{O}(1)$~TeV\n($\\Lambda = \\mathcal{O}(2)$~TeV).\n", "  Nucleosynthesis, light curves, explosion energies, and remnant masses are\ncalculated for a grid of supernovae resulting from massive stars with solar\nmetallicity and masses from 9.0 to 120 solar masses. The full evolution is\nfollowed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel\naspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model\nfor the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the\nobserved energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the\nCrab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a\ncalibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is\nvariable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many\nprogenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black\nholes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.\nThe resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that\na reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a\ndeficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star IMF has a\nmean gravitational mass near 1.4 solar masses. The average black hole mass is\nabout 9 solar masses if only the helium core implodes, and 14 solar masses if\nthe entire presupernova star collapses. Only ~10% of supernovae come from stars\nover 20 solar masses and some of these are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful\nsystematics of Type IIp light curves are explored.\n", "  Cilia and flagella in biological systems often show large scale cooperative\nbehaviors such as the synchronization of their beats in \"metachronal waves\".\nThese are beautiful examples of emergent dynamics in biology, and are essential\nfor life, allowing diverse processes from the motility of eukaryotic\nmicroorganisms, to nutrient transport and clearance of pathogens from mammalian\nairways. How these collective states arise is not fully understood, but it is\nclear that individual cilia interact mechanically,and that a strong and long\nranged component of the coupling is mediated by the viscous fluid. We review\nhere the work by ourselves and others aimed at understanding the behavior of\nhydrodynamically coupled systems, and particularly a set of results that have\nbeen obtained both experimentally and theoretically by studying actively driven\ncolloidal systems. In these controlled scenarios, it is possible to selectively\ntest aspects of the living motile cilia, such as the geometrical arrangement,\nthe effects of the driving profile and the distance to no-slip boundaries. We\noutline and give examples of how it is possible to link model systems to\nobservations on living systems, which can be made on microorganisms, on cell\ncultures or on tissue sections. This area of research has clear clinical\napplication in the long term, as severe pathologies are associated with\ncompromised cilia function in humans.\n", "  Rigid endoscopes like graded-index (GRIN) lenses are known tools in\nbiological imaging, but it is conceptually difficult to miniaturize them. In\nthis letter, we demonstrate an ultra-thin rigid endoscope with a diameter of\nonly 125 microns. In addition, we identify a domain where two-photon endoscopic\nimaging with fs-pulse excitation is possible. We validate the ultra-thin rigid\nendoscope consisting of a few cm of graded-index multi-mode fiber by using it\nto acquire optically sectioned two-photon fluorescence endoscopic images of\nthree-dimensional samples.\n", "  We compute the anomalous dimensions of a class of operators of the form\n$(\\bar\\psi\\psi)^p$ and $(\\bar\\psi\\psi)^p\\psi$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$ in\nthe Gross-Neveu model in $2+\\epsilon$ dimensions. We use the techniques\ndeveloped in arXiv: 1505.00963.\n", "  We discuss various aspects of the O(N)-model in the vacuum and at finite\ntemperature within the Phi-derivable expansion scheme to order lambda^2. In\ncontinuation to an earlier work, we look for a physical parametrization in the\nN=4 case that allows to accommodate the lightest mesons. Using zero-momentum\ncurvature masses to approximate the physical masses, we find that, in the\nparameter range where a relatively large sigma mass is obtained, the scale of\nthe Landau pole is lower compared to that obtained in the two-loop truncation.\nThis jeopardizes the insensitivity of the observables to the ultraviolet\nregulator and could hinder the predictivity of the model. Both in the N=1 and\nN=4 cases, we also find that, when approaching the chiral limit, the\n(iterative) solution to the Phi-derivable equations is lost in an interval\naround the would-be transition temperature. In particular, it is not possible\nto conclude at this order of truncation on the order of the transition in the\nchiral limit. Because the same issue could be present in other approaches, we\ninvestigate it thoroughly by considering a localized version of the\nPhi-derivable equations, whose solution displays the same qualitative features,\nbut allows for a more analytical understanding of the problem. In particular,\nour analysis reveals the existence of unphysical branches of solutions which\ncan coalesce with the physical one at some temperatures, with the effect of\nopening up a gap in the admissible values for the condensate. Depending on its\nrate of growth with the temperature, this gap can eventually engulf the\nphysical solution.\n", "  We studied the coupled beam motion in a storage ring between the transverse\nand longitudinal directions introduced by crab cavities. Analytic form of the\nlinear decoupling transformation is derived. The equilibrium bunch distribution\nin an electron storage ring with a crab cavity is given, including contribution\nto the eigen-emittance induced by the crab cavity. Application to the short\npulse generation scheme using crab cavities is considered.\n", "  Over the last few years lattice techniques have been used to investigate\ncandidate theories of new physics beyond the Standard Model. This review gives\na survey of results from these studies. Most of these investigations have been\nof systems of gauge fields and fermions that have slowly-running coupling\nconstants. A major portion of the review is a critical discussion of work in\nthis particular subfield, first describing the methods used, and then giving a\ncompilation of results for specific models.\n", "  A model of dark sector where $O({\\rm few~GeV})$ mass dark matter particles\n$\\chi$ couple to a lighter dark force mediator $V$, $m_V \\ll m_\\chi$, is\nmotivated by the recently discovered mismatch between simulated and observed\nshapes of galactic haloes. Such models, in general, provide a challenge for\ndirect detection efforts and collider searches. We show that for a large range\nof coupling constants and masses, the production and decay of the bound states\nof $\\chi$, such as $0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$ states, $\\eta_D$ and $ \\Upsilon_D$, is\nan important search channel. We show that $e^+e^-\\to \\eta_D +V$ or $\\Upsilon_D\n+\\gamma$ production at $B$-factories for $\\alpha_D > 0.1$ is sufficiently\nstrong to result in multiple pairs of charged leptons and pions via $\\eta_D\\to\n2V \\to 2(l^+l^-)$ and $\\Upsilon_D\\to 3V \\to 3(l^+l^-)$ $(l=e,\\mu,\\pi)$. The\nabsence of such final states in the existing searches performed at \\babar\\ and\nBelle sets new constraints on the parameter space of the model. We also show\nthat a search for multiple bremsstrahlung of dark force mediators, $e^+e^-\\to\n\\chi\\bar\\chi+nV$, resulting in missing energy and multiple leptons, will\nfurther improve the sensitivity to self-interacting dark matter.\n", "  We present chip-scale transmission measurements for three key components of a\nGaP-on-diamond integrated photonics platform: waveguide-coupled disk\nresonators, directional couplers, and grating couplers. We also present\nproof-of-principle measurements demonstrating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center\nemission coupled into selected devices. The demonstrated device performance,\nuniformity and yield place the platform in a strong position to realize\nmeasurement-based quantum information protocols utilizing the NV center in\ndiamond.\n", "  We investigate the gravitational collapse of a non-rotating $n$-dimensional\nBTZ black hole in AdS space in the context of both classical and quantum\nmechanics. This is done by first deriving the conserved mass of a \"spherically\"\nsymmetric domain wall, which is taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the black\nhole. Upon deriving the conserved mass, we also point out that, for a\n\"spherically\" symmetric shell, there is an easy and straight-forward way of\ndetermining the conserved mass, which is related to the proper time derivative\nof the interior and exterior times. This method for determining the conserved\nmass is generic to any situation (i.e. any equation of state), since it only\ndepends on the energy per unit area, $\\sigma$, of the shell.\n  Classically, we show that the time taken for gravitational collapse follows\nthat of the typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse, that\nis, an asymptotic observer will see that the collapse takes an infinite amount\nof time to occur, while an infalling observer will see the collapse to both the\nhorizon and the classical singularity occur in a finite amount of time. Quantum\nmechanically, we take primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the\nhorizon and near the classical singularity from the point of view of both\nasymptotic and infalling observers. In the absence of radiation and\nfluctuations of the metric, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the\nclassical conclusions for an asymptotic observer. The most interesting quantum\nmechanical effect comes in when investigating near the classical singularity.\nHere, we find, that the quantum effects in this region are able to remove the\nclassical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is non-singular,\nand is also displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy density of\nthe domain wall.\n", "  Electrons in graphene can travel for several microns without scattering at\nlow temperatures, and their motion becomes ballistic, following classical\ntrajectories. When a magnetic field B is applied perpendicular to the plane,\nelectrons follow cyclotron orbits. Magnetic focusing occurs when electrons\ninjected from one narrow contact focus onto a second contact located an integer\nnumber of cyclotron diameters away. By tuning the magnetic field B and electron\ndensity n in the graphene layer, we observe magnetic focusing peaks. We use a\ncooled scanning gate microscope to image cyclotron trajectories in graphene at\n4.2 K. The tip creates a local change in density that casts a shadow by\ndeflecting electrons flowing nearby; an image of flow can be obtained by\nmeasuring the transmission between contacts as the tip is raster scanned across\nthe sample. On the first magnetic focusing peak, we image a cyclotron orbit\nthat extends from one point contact to the other. In addition, we study the\ngeometry of orbits deflected into the second point contact by the tip.\n", "  I discuss our recent work on Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) calculations\nof light nuclei using local nucleon-nucleon interactions derived from chiral\neffective field theory (EFT) up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). I\npresent the natural extension of this work to include the consistent\nthree-nucleon (3N) forces at the same order in the chiral expansion. I discuss\nour choice of observables to fit the two low-energy constants which enter in\nthe 3N sector at N$^2$LO and present some results for light nuclei.\n", "  The arrangement of the fiber positioning units in LAMOST focal plane may lead\nto the collisions during the fiber allocation. To avoid these collisions, the\nsoft protection system has to abandon some targets located in the overlapped\nfield of the adjacent fiber units. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the\nprobability of the collisions between fibers and inferred their possible\nreasons. It is useful to solve the problem of the fiber-positioning units\ncollisions so as to improve LAMOST efficiency. Based on it, a collision\nhandling system is designed by using the master-slave control structure between\nthe micro control unit (MCU) and the microcomputer. The simulated experiments\nvalidate that the system can provide real-time inspection and swap the\ninformation between the fiber unit controllers and the main controller.\n", "  A new approach to measure the second order correlation function $g^{(2)}$ and\nthe coherence time was investigated. The $g^{(2)}$ was calculated from the\nphoton pair time interval distribution by direct numerical self-convolution\nwith the high order correction. The accuracy of this method was examined using\nan optical fiber based Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometer with a pseudo-thermal\nlight source. We found that the significance of the high order correction is\nrelated to the factor $\\bar{I}\\tau_{c}$, which is the overlapping of the photon\nwave packets. A novel technique was also demonstrated to measure the coherence\ntime $\\tau_c$ of a light source using the random phase modulation. In\ncomparison with the conventional self-heterodyne detection, this method is more\nsuitable for a weak light source with a long coherence time.\n", "  We study renormalization group flow of four dimensional N=2 SCFTs defined by\nisolated hypersurface three-fold singularities. We define the spectrum of N=2\ntheory as the set of scaling dimensions of the parameters on the Coulomb\nbranch, which include Coulomb branch moduli, mass parameters and coupling\nconstants. We prove that the spectrum of those theories is semicontinous under\nthe RG flow on the Coulomb branch using the mathematical result about the\nsingularity spectra under deformation. The semicontinuity behavior of N=2\nspectrum implies a theorem under relevant and Coulomb branch moduli\ndeformation, the absence of dangerous irrelevant deformations and can be taken\nas the necessary condition for the ending point of a RG flow. This behavior is\nalso true for (c,c) ring deformation of two dimensional Landau-Ginzburg model\nwith (2,2) supersymmetry.\n", "  Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for building a\nquantum computer. However, individual qubit coherence times are not far past\nthe scalability threshold for quantum error correction, meaning that millions\nof physical devices would be required to construct a useful quantum computer.\nConsequently, further increases in coherence time are very desirable. In this\nletter, we blueprint a simple circuit consisting of two transmon qubits and two\nadditional lossy qubits or resonators, which is passively protected against all\nsingle qubit quantum error channels through a combination of continuous driving\nand engineered dissipation. Photon losses are rapidly corrected through\ntwo-photon drive fields implemented with driven SQUID couplings, and dephasing\nfrom random potential fluctuations is heavily suppressed by the drive fields\nused to implement the multi-qubit Hamiltonian. Comparing our theoretical model\nto published noise estimates from recent experiments on flux and transmon\nqubits, we find that logical state coherence could be improved by a factor of\nforty or more compared to the individual qubit $T_1$ and $T_2$ using this\ntechnique. We thus demonstrate that there is substantial headroom for improving\nthe coherence of modern superconducting qubits with a fairly modest increase in\ndevice complexity.\n", "  We propose a scheme for generating three-dimensional entanglement between two\natoms trapped in two spatially separated cavities reapectively via shortcuts to\nadi- abatic passage based on the approach of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants in\ncavity quan- tum electronic dynamics. By combining Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants\nwith quantum Zeno dynamics, we can generate three dimensional entanglement of\nthe two atoms with high fidelity. The Numerical simulation results show that\nthe scheme is ro- bust against the decoherences caused by the photon leakage\nand atomic spontaneous emission.\n", "  In nanomechanical QED system, consisting of a charge qubit and a nonlinear\nnanomechanical resonator, we study the temporal behavior of Rabi oscillation in\nthe nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model. Using microscopic master equation\napproach, we solve time evolution of the density operator describing this\nmodel. Also, the probability of excited state of charge qubit is calculated.\nThese analytic calculations show how nonlinearity parameter and decay rates of\ntwo different excited states of the qubit-resonator system affect\ntime-oscillating and decaying of Rabi oscillation.\n", "  We present a new single-ion endcap trap for high precision spectroscopy that\nhas been designed to minimize ion-environment interactions. We describe the\ndesign in detail and then characterize the working trap using a single trapped\n171 Yb ion. Excess micromotion has been eliminated to the resolution of the\ndetection method and the trap exhibits an anomalous phonon heating rate of d<n>\n/dt = 24 +30/-24 per second. The thermal properties of the trap structure have\nalso been measured with an effective temperature rise at the ion's position of\n0.14 +/- 0.14 K. The small perturbations to the ion caused by this trap make it\nsuitable to be used for an optical frequency standard with fractional\nuncertainties below the 10^-18 level.\n", "  We incorporate Milky Way dark matter halo profile uncertainties, as well as\nan accounting of diffuse gamma-ray emission uncertainties in dark matter\nannihilation models for the Galactic Center Extended gamma-ray excess (GCE)\ndetected by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. The range of particle\nannihilation rate and masses expand when including these unknowns. However, two\nof the most precise empirical determinations of the Milky Way halo's local\ndensity and density profile leave the signal region to be in considerable\ntension with dark matter annihilation searches from combined dwarf galaxy\nanalyses for single-channel dark matter annihilation models. The GCE and dwarf\ntension can be alleviated if: one, the halo is very highly concentrated or\nstrongly contracted; two, the dark matter annihilation signal differentiates\nbetween dwarfs and the GC; or, three, local stellar density measures are found\nto be significantly lower, like that from recent stellar counts, increasing the\nlocal dark matter density.\n", "  We use microwave temperature maps from two seasons of data from the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope (ACTPol) at 146 GHz, together with the Constant Mass CMASS\ngalaxy sample from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey to measure the\nkinematic Sunyaev-Ze\\v{l}dovich (kSZ) effect over the redshift range z = 0.4 -\n0.7. We use galaxy positions and the continuity equation to obtain a\nreconstruction of the line-of-sight velocity field. We stack the cosmic\nmicrowave background temperature at the location of each halo, weighted by the\ncorresponding reconstructed velocity. The resulting best fit kSZ model is\npreferred over the no-kSZ hypothesis at 3.3sigma and 2.9sigma for two\nindependent velocity reconstruction methods, using 25,537 galaxies over 660\nsquare degrees. The effect of foregrounds that are uncorrelated with the galaxy\nvelocities is expected to be well below our signal, and residual thermal\nSunyaev-Ze\\v{l}dovich contamination is controlled by masking the most massive\nclusters. Finally, we discuss the systematics involved in converting our\nmeasurement of the kSZ amplitude into the mean free electron fraction of the\nhalos in our sample.\n", "  After motivation and short presentation of the minimal supersymmetric model\nwith R-symmetry (MRSSM), we address the question of accomodating the measured\nHiggs boson mass in accordance with electroweak precision observables and LHC\nconstraints.\n", "  Based on the Frenkel-charge transfer (CT) mixing model of singlet fission\n(SF), we incorporate both the local and nonlocal phonon baths in the\nHamiltonian and adopt the algorithm of time-dependent density matrix\nrenormalization group to simulate the fission process in tetracene. The\nendergonic SF is found to be facilitated by the robust quantum coherence, which\nconcurrently gives rise to a notable quantum beating effect. Controlled by the\nnonlocal electron-phonon coupling, the density of triplet yield manifests a\nnonlinear relationship with the singlet density. As a result, the fission rate\nin tetracene is explicitly obtained, which is in agreement with the\nexperimental measurement.\n", "  Hot electrons injection in carbon nanotubes (CNTs ) where in addition to\napplied dc field ($\\mathbf{E}$), there exist simultaneously a quasi-static ac\nelectric field (i.e. when the frequency $\\omega$ of ac field is much less than\nthe scattering frequency $v$ ($\\omega\\ll v$ or $\\omega\\tau\\ll 1$, $v\n=\\tau^{-1}$, where $\\tau$ is relaxation time) is considered. The investigation\nis done theoritically by solving semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation\nwith and without the presence of the hot electrons source to derive the current\ndensities. Plots of the normalized current density versus dc field\n($\\mathbf{E}$) applied along the axis of the CNTs in the presence and absence\nof hot electrons reveal ohmic conductivity initially and finally negative\ndifferential conductivity (NDC) provided $\\omega\\tau\\ll 1$ (i.e. quasi- static\ncase). With strong enough axial injection of the hot electrons , there is a\nswitch from NDC to positive differential conductivity (PDC) about $\\mathbf{E}\n\\geq 75 kV/cm$ and $\\mathbf{E} \\geq 140 kV/cm$ for a zigzag CNT and an armchair\nCNT respectively. Thus, the most important tough problem for NDC region which\nis the space charge instabilities can be suppressed due to the switch from the\nNDC behaviour to the PDC behaviour predicting a potential generation of\nterahertz radiations whose applications are relevance in current-day\ntechnology, industry, and research.\n", "  We present characterizations of few-layer titanium trisulfide (TiS3) flakes\nwhich, due to their reduced in-plane structural symmetry, display strong\nanisotropy in their electrical and optical properties. Exfoliated few-layer\nflakes show marked anisotropy of their in-plane mobilities reaching ratios as\nhigh as 7.6 at low temperatures. Based on the preferential growth axis of TiS3\nnanoribbons, we develop a simple method to identify the in-plane crystalline\naxes of exfoliated few-layer flakes through angle resolved polarization Raman\nspectroscopy. Optical transmission measurements show that TiS3 flakes display\nstrong linear dichroism with a magnitude (transmission ratios up to 30) much\ngreater than that observed for other anisotropic two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials. Finally, we calculate the absorption and transmittance spectra of\nTiS3 in the random-phase-approximation (RPA) and find that the calculations are\nin good agreement with the observed experimental optical transmittance.\n", "  We present basic atmospheric parameters ($T_{eff}$, $log g$, $v_{t}$ and\n[Fe/H]), rotation velocities and absolute radial velocities as well as\nluminosities, masses, ages and radii for 402 stars (including 11 single-lined\nspectroscopic binaries), mostly subgiants and giants. For 272 of them we\npresent parameters for the first time. For another 53 stars we present\nestimates of $T_{eff}$ and $log g$ based on photometric calibrations. More than\nhalf objects were found to be subgiants, there is also a large group of giants\nand a few stars appeard to be dwarfs. The results show that the presented\nsample is composed of stars with masses ranging from 0.52 to $3.21 M_{\\odot}$\nof which 17 have masses $\\geq$ $2.0 M_{\\odot}$. The radii of stars studied in\nthis paper range from 0.66 to $36.04 R_{\\odot}$ with vast majority having radii\nbetween 2.0 and $4.0 R_{\\odot}$. They are generally less metal abundant than\nthe Sun with median [Fe/H]$=-0.07$. For 62 stars in common with other planet\nsearches we found a very good agreement in obtained stellar atmospheric\nparameters. We also present basic properties of the complete list of 744 stars\nthat form the PTPS evolved stars sample. We examined stellar masses for 1255\nstars in five other planet searches and found some of them likely to be\nsignificantly overestimated. Applying our uniformly determined stellar masses\nwe confirm the apparent increase of companions masses for evolved stars, and we\nexplain it, as well as lack of close-in planets with limited effective radial\nvelocity precision for those stars due to activity.\n", "  The radiative mechanism of the black hole X-ray transients (BHXTs) in their\nquiescent states (defined as the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity $\\le 10^{34}{\\rm\n\\,erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the\nquasi-simultaneous quiescent state spectrum (including radio, infrared,\noptical, ultraviolet and X-ray) of two BHXTs, A0620--00 and XTE J1118+480. We\nfind that, these two sources can be well described by a coupled accretion --\njet model. More specifically, most of the emission (radio up-to infrared, and\nthe X-ray waveband) comes from the collimated relativistic jet. Emission from\nhot accretion flow is totally insignificant, and it can only be observed in\nmid-infrared (the synchrotron peak). Emission from the outer cold disc is only\nevident in UV band. These results are consistent with our previous\ninvestigation on the quiescent state of V404 Cyg, and confirm that the\nquiescent state is jet-dominated.\n", "  In recent decades, computer simulations have found increasingly widespread\nuse as powerful tools of studying phase transitions in wide variety of systems.\nIn the particular and very important case of aqueous systems, the commonly used\nforce-fields tend to offer quite different predictions with respect to a wide\nrange of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, including the ease of ice\nnucleation, the propensity to freeze at a vapor-liquid interface, and the\nexistence of a liquid-liquid phase transition. It is thus of fundamental and\npractical interest to understand how different features of a given water model\naffect its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. In this work, we use the\nforward-flux sampling technique to study the crystallization kinetics of a\nfamily of modified Stillinger-Weber (SW) potentials with energy ($\\epsilon$)\nand length ($\\sigma$) scales taken from the monoatomic water (mW) model, but\nwith different tetrahedrality parameters ($\\lambda$). By increasing $\\lambda$\nfrom 21 to 24, we observe the nucleation rate increases by 48 orders of\nmagnitude at a supercooling of ${\\zeta}=T/T_m=0.845$. Using classical\nnucleation theory, we are able to demonstrate that this change can largely be\naccounted for by the increase in $|\\Delta\\mu|$, the thermodynamic driving\nforce. We also perform rate calculations in freestanding thin films of the\nsupercooled liquid, and observe a crossover from a surface-enhanced\ncrystallization at $\\lambda = 21$ to a bulk-dominated crystallization for\n$\\lambda\\ge22$.\n", "  In this paper we recall for physicists how it is possible, using the\nprinciple of maximization of the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy, to derive the\nBurr-Bingh-Maddala (burr12) double power law probability distribution function\nand its approximations (Pareto, loglogistic ..) and extension first used in\neconometrics. this is possible using a deformation of the power function, as\nthis has been done in complex systems for the exponential function. We give to\nthat distribution a deep stochastic interpretation using the theory of Weron et\nal. applied to thermodynamics the entropy nonextensivity can be accounted for\nby assuming that the asymptotic exponents are scale dependent. Therefore\nfunctions which describe phenomena presenting power-law asymptotic behaviour\ncan be obtained without introducing exotic forms of the entropy.\n", "  In this paper, we present a unique data set of more than one year's worth of\nregular observations of comet C/2013 A1(Siding Spring) with TRAPPIST in Chile,\nalong with low-resolution spectra obtained with the ESO/VLT FORS 2 instrument.\nThe comet made a close approach to Mars on October 19, 2014 and was then\nobserved by many space and ground-based telescopes. We followed the evolution\nof the OH, NH, CN, $\\mathrm{C_3}$, and $\\mathrm{C_2}$ production rates as well\nas the $Af\\rho$ parameter as a proxy for the dust production. We detected an\noutburst two weeks after perihelion, with gas and dust production rates being\nmultiplied by a factor five within a few days. By modelling the shape of the CN\nand $\\mathrm{C_2}$ radial profiles, we determined that the outburst happened\naround on November 10 around 15:30 UT ($\\pm$ 5h) and measured a gas ejection\nvelocity of $1.1\\pm0.2$ km/s. We used a thermal evolution model to reproduce\nthe activity pattern and outburst. Our results are consistent with the\nprogressive formation of a dust mantle explaining the shallow dependence of gas\nproduction rates, which may be partially blown off during the outburst. We\nstudied the evolution of gas composition, using various ratios such as CN/OH,\n$\\mathrm{C_2}$/OH, or $\\mathrm{C_3}$/OH, which showed little or no variation\nwith heliocentric distance including at the time of the outburst. This\nindicates a relative level of homogeneity of the nucleus composition.\n", "  We present an approach to create pulse sequences extending beyond\n150~picoseconds in duration, comprised of $100~\\mu$J femtosecond pulses. A\nquarter of the pulse train is produced by a high-resolution pulse shaper, which\nallows full controllability over the timing of each pulse. Two nested Michelson\ninterferometers follow to quadruple the pulse number and the sequence duration.\nTo boost the pulse energy, the long train is sent through a multi-pass\nTi:Sapphire amplifier, followed by an external compressor. A periodic sequence\nof 84~pulses of 120~fs width and an average pulse energy of 107~$\\mu$J,\nseparated by 2~ps, is demonstrated as a proof of principle.\n", "  We examine interacting Abelian theories at low energies and show that\nholomorphically normalized photon helicity amplitudes transform into dual\namplitudes under SL(2,Z) as modular forms with weights that depend on the\nnumber of positive and negative helicity photons and on the number of internal\nphoton lines. Moreover, canonically normalized helicity amplitudes transform by\na phase, so that even though the amplitudes are not duality invariant, their\nsquares are duality invariant. We explicitly verify the duality transformation\nat one loop by comparing the amplitudes in the case of an electron and the dyon\nthat is its SL(2,Z) image, and extend the invariance of squared amplitudes\norder by order in perturbation theory. We demonstrate that S-duality is\nproperty of all low-energy effective Abelian theories with electric and/or\nmagnetic charges and see how the duality generically breaks down at high\nenergies.\n", "  We provide an explicit example of how the string winding modes can be\nincorporated in double field theory. Our guiding case is the closed bosonic\nstring compactified on a circle of radius close to the self-dual point, where\nsome modes with non-zero winding or discrete momentum number become massless\nand enhance the $U(1) \\times U(1)$ symmetry to $SU(2) \\times SU(2)$. We compute\nthree-point string scattering amplitudes of massless and slightly massive\nstates, and extract the corresponding effective low energy gauge field theory.\nThe enhanced gauge symmetry at the self-dual point and the Higgs-like mechanism\narising when changing the compactification radius are examined in detail. The\nextra massless fields associated to the enhancement are incorporated into a\ngeneralized frame with $\\frac{O(d+3,d+3)}{O(d+3)\\times O(d+3)}$ structure,\nwhere $d$ is the number of non-compact dimensions. We devise a consistent\ndouble field theory action that reproduces the low energy string effective\naction with enhanced gauge symmetry. The construction requires a truly\nnon-geometric frame which explicitly depends on both the compact coordinate\nalong the circle and its dual.\n", "  We present the design and the preliminary on sky performance with respect to\nbeams and pass-bands of a multichroic polarimeter array covering the 90 and 146\nGHz Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bands and its enabling broadband optical\nsystem recently deployed on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The\nconstituent pixels are feedhorn-coupled multichroic polarimeters fabricated at\nNIST. This array is coupled to the ACT telescope via a set of three silicon\nlenses incorporating novel broad-band metamaterial anti-reflection coatings.\nThis receiver represents the first multichroic detector array deployed for a\nCMB experiment and paves the way for the extensive use of multichroic detectors\nand broadband optical systems in the next generation of CMB experiments.\n", "  We briefly review the topic of AdS (in)stability, mainly focusing on a\nrecently introduced analytic approach and its interplay with numerical results.\n", "  We calculate the deconfining temperature of SO(N) gauge theories in 2+1\ndimensions, and determine the order of the phase transition as a function of N,\nfor various values of N in the range [4,16]. We do so by extrapolating our\nlattice results to the infinite volume limit, and then to the continuum limit,\nfor each value of N. We then extrapolate to the N=infinity limit and observe\nthat the SO(N) and SU(N) deconfining temperatures agree in that limit. We find\nthat the the deconfining temperatures of all the SO(N) gauge theories appear to\nfollow a single smooth function of N, despite the lack of a non-trivial centre\nfor odd N. We also compare the deconfining temperatures of SO(6) with SU(4),\nand of SO(4) with SU(2)xSU(2), motivated by the fact that these pairs of gauge\ntheories share the same Lie algebras.\n", "  It is shown that adiabatic cycles excite a quantum particle, which is\nconfined in a one-dimensional region and is initially in an eigenstate. During\nthe cycle, an infinitely sharp wall is applied and varied its strength and\nposition. After the completion of the cycle, the state of the particle arrives\nanother eigenstate. It is also shown that we may vary the final adiabatic state\nby choosing the parameters of the cycle. With a combination of these adiabatic\ncycles, we can connect an arbitrary pair of eigenstates. Hence, these cycles\nmay be regarded as basis of the adiabatic excitations. A detailed argument is\nprovided for the case that the particle is confined by an infinite square well.\nThis is an example of exotic quantum holonomy in Hamiltonian systems.\n", "  We study the ultraviolet properties of theories whose fundamental fields\ndisplay a confining, Gribov-type, propagator. These are propagators that\nexhibit complex poles and violate positivity, thus precluding a physical\npropagating particle interpretation. We show that the properties of this type\nof confining propagators do not change the ultraviolet behavior of the theory,\nin the sense that no new ultraviolet primitive divergences are generated, thus\nsecuring the renormalizability of these confining theories. We illustrate these\nproperties by studying a variety of models, including bosonic and fermionic\nconfined degrees of freedom. The more intricate case of Super Yang-Mills with\n${\\cal N} =1$ supersymmetries in the Wess-Zumino gauge is taken as example in\norder to prove these statements to all orders by means of the algebraic\nrenormalization set up.\n", "  We study mathematical and computational models for computing the deformation\nof fiber-reinforced cross-plied laminates due to external forces. This requires\nan understanding of both micro-structural effects and different sources of\nuncertainty in the problem. We first show that the uncertainties in the problem\nare of both statistical (aleatoric) and systematic (epistemic) types and that\ncurrent multiscale stochastic models, such as stationary random fields, which\nare based on precise probability theory, are not capable of correctly\ncharacterizing uncertainty in fiber composites. Next, we motivate the\napplicability of models based on imprecise uncertainty theory and present a\nnovel fuzzy-stochastic model, which can more accurately describe uncertainties\nin fiber composites. The new model is constructed by combining stochastic\nfields and fuzzy variables through a simple calibration-validation approach.\nFinally, we construct a global-local multiscale algorithm for efficiently\ncomputing output quantities of interest. The method aims at approximating\nrequired quantities, such as displacements and stresses, in regions of\nrelatively small size, e.g. hot spots or zones. The algorithm uses the concept\nof representative volume elements and computes a global solution to construct a\nlocal approximation that captures the microscale features of the solution. The\nresults are based on and backed by real experimental data.\n", "  We investigate correlations between different physical properties of\nstar-forming galaxies in the \"Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their\nEnvironments\" (EAGLE) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite over the\nredshift range $0\\le z\\le 4.5$. A principal component analysis reveals that\nneutral gas fraction ($f_{\\rm gas, neutral}$), stellar mass ($M_{\\rm stellar}$)\nand star formation rate (SFR) account for most of the variance seen in the\npopulation, with galaxies tracing a two-dimensional, nearly flat, surface in\nthe three-dimensional space of $f_{\\rm gas, neutral}-M_{\\rm stellar}-\\rm SFR$\nwith little scatter. The location of this plane varies little with redshift,\nwhereas galaxies themselves move along the plane as their $f_{\\rm gas,\nneutral}$ and SFR drop with redshift. The positions of galaxies along the plane\nare highly correlated with gas metallicity. The metallicity can therefore be\nrobustly predicted from $f_{\\rm gas, neutral}$, or from the $M_{\\rm stellar}$\nand SFR. We argue that the appearance of this \"fundamental plane of star\nformation\" is a consequence of self-regulation, with the plane's curvature set\nby the dependence of the SFR on gas density and metallicity. We analyse a large\ncompilation of observations spanning the redshift range $0\\lesssim \\rm\nz\\lesssim 2.5$, and find that such a plane is also present in the data. The\nproperties of the observed fundamental plane of star formation are in good\nagreement with EAGLE's predictions.\n", "  Multiple light scattering in tissue limits the penetration of optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Here, we present in-vivo OCT imaging of a\nlive mouse using wavefront shaping to enhance the penetration depth. A digital\nmicro-mirror device (DMD) was used in a spectral-domain OCT system for complex\nwavefront shaping of an incident beam which resulted in the optimal delivery of\nlight energy into deep tissue. Ex-vivo imaging of chicken breasts and mouse ear\ntissues showed enhancements in the strength of the image signals and the\npenetration depth, and in-vivo imaging of the tail of a live mouse provided a\nmultilayered structure inside the tissue, otherwise invisible in conventional\nOCT imaging. Signal enhancements by a factor of 3-7 were acquired for various\nexperimental conditions and samples.\n", "  Following H. Tomita and C. Murakami we propose an analytical model to predict\ncritical probability of percolation. It is based on the excursion set theory\nwhich allows us to consider N-dimensional bounded regions. Details are given\nfor the 3D case and statistically Representative Volume Elements are\ncalculated. Finally generalisation to the N-dimensional case is made.\n", "  It has become common to call this the \"era of precision cosmology,\" and hence\none rarely hears about the finiteness of the amount of information that is\navailable for constraining cosmological parameters. Under the assumption that\nthe perturbations are purely Gaussian, the amount of extractable information\n(in terms of total signal-to-noise ratio for power spectrum measurements) is\nthe same (up to a small numerical factor) as an accounting of the number of\nobservable modes. For studies of the microwave sky, we are probably within a\nfactor of a few of the amount of accessible information. To dramatically reduce\nthe uncertainties on parameters will require three-dimensional probes, such as\nambitious future redshifted 21-cm surveys. However, even there the available\ninformation is still finite, with the total effective signal-to-noise ratio on\nparameters probably not exceeding $10^7$. The amount of observable information\nwill increase with time (but very slowly) into the extremely distant future.\n", "  Motivated by the restoration of $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ at high energy, we suggest\nthat certain ratios of diboson differential cross sections can be used as\nhigh-precision observables at the LHC. We rewrite leading-order diboson\npartonic cross sections in a form that makes their $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ and\ncustodial $SU(2)$ structure more explicit than in previous literature, and\nidentify important aspects of this structure that survive even in hadronic\ncross sections. We then focus on higher-order corrections to ratios of\n$\\gamma\\gamma$, $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$ processes, including full\nnext-to-leading-order corrections and $gg$ initial-state contributions, and\nargue that these ratios can likely be predicted to better than $5\\%$, which\nshould make them useful in searches for new phenomena. The ratio of $Z\\gamma$\nto $\\gamma\\gamma$ is especially promising in the near term, due to large rates\nand to exceptional cancellations of QCD-related uncertainties. We argue that\nelectroweak corrections are moderate in size, have small uncertainties, and can\npotentially be observed in these ratios in the long run.\n", "  We present Ks -band light curves for 299 Cepheids in the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) of which 288 are new discoveries that we have identified using\nmulti-epoch near-infrared photometry obtained by the VISTA survey of the\nMagellanic Clouds system (VMC). The new Cepheids have periods in the range from\n0.34 to 9.1 days and cover the magnitude interval 12.9 <= Ks <= 17.6 mag. Our\nmethod was developed using variable stars previously identified by the optical\nmicrolensing survey OGLE. We focus on searching new Cepheids in external\nregions of the SMC for which complete VMC Ks-band observations are available\nand no comprehensive identification of different types of variable stars from\nother surveys exists yet.\n", "  Non-collinear four-wave mixing (FWM) techniques at near-infrared (NIR),\nvisible, and ultraviolet frequencies have been widely used to map vibrational\nand electronic couplings, typically in complex molecules. However, correlations\nbetween spatially localized inner-valence transitions among different sites of\na molecule in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range have not been\nobserved yet. As an experimental step towards this goal we perform\ntime-resolved FWM spectroscopy with femtosecond NIR and attosecond XUV pulses.\nThe first two pulses (XUV-NIR) coincide in time and act as coherent excitation\nfields, while the third pulse (NIR) acts as a probe. As a first application we\nshow how coupling dynamics between odd- and even-parity inner-valence excited\nstates of neon can be revealed using a two-dimensional spectral representation.\nExperimentally obtained results are found to be in good agreement with ab\ninitio time-dependent R-matrix calculations providing the full description of\nmulti-electron interactions, as well as few-level model simulations. Future\napplications of this method also include site-specific probing of electronic\nprocesses in molecules.\n", "  We report the fabrication and characterization of a gate-defined double\nquantum dot formed in a Si/SiGe nanomembrane. In the past, all gate-defined\nquantum dots in Si/SiGe heterostructures were formed on top of strain-graded\nvirtual substrates. The strain grading process necessarily introduces misfit\ndislocations into a heterostructure, and these defects introduce lateral strain\ninhomogeneities, mosaic tilt, and threading dislocations. The use of a SiGe\nnanomembrane as the virtual substrate enables the strain relaxation to be\nentirely elastic, eliminating the need for misfit dislocations. However, in\nthis approach the formation of the heterostructure is more complicated,\ninvolving two separate epitaxial growth procedures separated by a wet-transfer\nprocess that results in a buried non-epitaxial interface 625 nm from the\nquantum dot. We demonstrate that in spite of this buried interface in close\nproximity to the device, a double quantum dot can be formed that is\ncontrollable enough to enable tuning of the inter-dot tunnel coupling, the\nidentification of spin states, and the measurement of a singlet-to-triplet\ntransition as a function of an applied magnetic field.\n", "  We utilize the recently demonstrated orders of magnitude enhancement of\nextremely nondegenerate two-photon absorption in direct-gap semiconductor\nphotodiodes to perform scanned imaging of 3D structures using IR femtosecond\nillumination pulses (1.6 um and 4.93 um) gated on the GaN detector by sub-gap,\nfemtosecond pulses. While transverse resolution is limited by the usual imaging\ncriteria, the longitudinal or depth resolution can be less than a wavelength,\ndependent on the pulsewidths in this nonlinear interaction within the detector\nelement. The imaging system can accommodate a wide range of wavelengths in the\nmid-IR and near-IR without the need to modify the detection and imaging\nsystems.\n", "  While many features of topological band insulators are commonly discussed at\nthe level of single-particle electron wave functions, such as the gapless Dirac\nspectrum at their boundary, it remains elusive to develop a {\\it hydrodynamic}\nor {\\it collective} description of fermionic topological band insulators in 3+1\ndimensions. As the Chern-Simons theory for the 2+1-dimensional quantum Hall\neffect, such a hydrodynamic effective field theory provides a universal\ndescription of topological band insulators, even in the presence of\ninteractions, and that of putative fractional topological insulators. In this\npaper, we undertake this task by using the functional bosonization. The\neffective field theory in the functional bosonization is written in terms of a\ntwo-form gauge field, which couples to a $U(1)$ gauge field that arises by\ngauging the continuous symmetry of the target system (the $U(1)$ particle\nnumber conservation). Integrating over the $U(1)$ gauge field by using the\nelectromagnetic duality, the resulting theory describes topological band\ninsulators as a condensation phase of the $U(1)$ gauge theory (or as a monopole\ncondensation phase of the dual gauge field). The hydrodynamic description, and\nthe implication of its duality, of the surface of topological insulators are\nalso discussed. We also touch upon the hydrodynamic theory of fractional\ntopological insulators by using the parton construction.\n", "  Irregular conformal block is motivated by the Argyres-Douglas type of N=2\nsuper conformal gauge theory. We investigate the classical/NS limit of the\nirregular conformal block using spectral curve on a Riemann surface with\nirregular punctures, which is equivalent to the loop equation of irregular\nmatrix model. The spectral curve is reduced to the second order (Virasoro\nsymmetry, $SU(2)$ for the gauge theory) and third order ($W_3$ symmetry,\n$SU(3)$) differential equations of a polynomial with finite degree. The\nVirasoro and W symmetry generate flow equations in the spectral curve and\ndetermine the irregular conformal block, hence the partition function of the\nArgyres-Douglas theory ala AGT conjecture.\n", "  A metallic disk with strong spin orbit interaction is investigated . The\nfinite disk geometry introduces a confining potential. Due to the strong\nspin-orbit interaction and confining potential the metal disk is described by\nan effective one dimensional with a harmonic potential. The harmonic potential\ngives rise to classical turning points. As a result open boundary conditions\nmust be used. We Bosonize the model and obtain chiral Bosons for each spin on\nthe edge of the disk. When the filling fraction is reduced to\n$\\nu=\\frac{k_{F}}{k_{so}}=\\frac{1}{3}$ the electron- electron interactions are\nstudied using the Jordan Wigner phase for composite fermions which gives rise\nto a Luttinger liquid. When the metallic disk is in the proximity with a\nsuperconductor a Fractional Topological Insulators is obtained.\n  An experimental realization is proposed. We show that by tunning the chemical\npotential we control the classical turning points for which a Fractional\nTopological Insulator is realized.\n", "  The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) contribution induced on the cosmic microwave\nbackground by the presence of a supervoid as the one detected by Szapudi et al.\n(2015) is reviewed in this letter in order to check whether it could explain\nthe Cold Spot (CS) anomaly. Two different models, previously used for the same\npurpose, are considered to describe the matter density profile of the void: a\ntop hat function and a compensated profile produced by a Gaussian potential.\nThe analysis shows that, even enabling ellipticity changes or different values\nfor the dark-energy equation of state parameter $\\omega$, the ISW contribution\ndue to the presence of the void does not reproduce the properties of the CS.\nFinally, the probability of alignment between the void and the CS is also\nquestioned as an argument in favor of a physical connection between these two\nphenomena.\n", "  Modified gravity has attracted much attention over the last few years and\nremains a potential candidate for dark energy. In particular, the so-called\nviable f(R) gravity theories, which are able to both recover General Relativity\n(GR) and produce late-time cosmic acceleration, have been widely studied in\nrecent literature. Nevertheless, extended theories of gravity suffer from\nseveral shortcomings which compromise their ability to provide realistic\nalternatives to the standard cosmological Lambda CDM Concordance model. We\naddress the existence of cosmological singularities and the conditions that\nguarantee late-time acceleration,assuming reasonable energy conditions for\nstandard matter in the so-called Hu-Sawicki f(R) model, currently among the\nmost widely studied modifications to General Relativity. Then using the\nSupernovae Ia Union 2.1 catalogue, we further constrain the free parameters of\nthis model. The combined analysis of both theoretical and observational\nconstraints sheds some light on the viable parameter space of these models and\nthe form of the underlying effective theory of gravity.\n", "  In external Compton scenario, we investigate the formation of the very hard\nelectron spectrum in the fast-cooling regime, using a time-dependent emission\nmodel. It is shown that a very hard electron distribution $N'_{\\rm\ne}(\\gp)\\propto\\gp^{-p}$ with the spectral index $p\\sim1.3$ is formed below the\nminimum energy of injection electron when inverse Compton scattering takes\nplace in the Klein-Nishina regime, i.e., inverse Compton scattering of\nrelativistic electrons on broad-line region radiation in flat spectrum radio\nquasars. This produces a very hard gamma-ray spectrum, and can reasonably\nexplain the very hard \\emph{Fermi}-LAT spectrum of the flat spectrum radio\nquasar 3C 279 during the extreme gamma-ray flare in 2013 December.\n", "  We study the heat current autocorrelation function (HCAF) in one-dimensional,\nmomentum-conserving lattices. In particular, we explore if there is any\nrelation between the decaying characteristics of the HCAF and asymmetric\ninterparticle interactions. The Lennard-Jones model is intensively investigated\nin view of its significance to applications. It is found that in wide ranges of\nparameters, the HCAF decays faster than power-law manners, and in some cases it\ndecays even exponentially. Following the Green-Kubo formula, the fast decay of\nHCAF implies the convergence of heat conductivity, which is also corroborated\nby numerical simulations. In addition, with a comparison to the\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\\beta$ model of symmetric interaction, the HCAF of the\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\\alpha$-$\\beta$ model of asymmetric interaction is also\ninvestigated. Our study suggests that, in certain ranges of parameters, the\ndecaying behavior of the HCAF is correlated to the asymmetry degree of\ninteraction.\n", "  We report two-photon resonance fluorescence of an individual semiconductor\nartificial atom. By non-linearly driving a single quantum dot via a two-photon\ntransition, we probe the linewidth of the two-photon processes and show that,\nsimilar to their single-photon counterparts, they are close to being Fourier\nlimited at low temperatures. The evolution of the population of excitonic\nstates with the Rabi frequency exhibits a clear s-shaped behavior, indicative\nof the non-linear response via the two-photon excitation process. We model the\nnon-linear response using a 4-level atomic system representing the manifold of\nexcitonic and biexcitonic states of the quantum dot and show that quantitative\nagreement is obtained only by including the interaction with LA-phonons in the\nsolid state environment. Finally, we demonstrate the formation of dressed\nstates emerging from a two-photon interaction between the artificial atom and\nthe excitation field. The non-linear optical dressing induces a mixing of all\nfour excitonic states that facilitates the tuning of the polarization selection\nrules of the artificial atom.\n", "  We propose a framework of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model\nthat can ameliorate both the SUSY Higgs mass problem and the missing\nsuperpartner problem. New vectorlike matter fields couple to the Higgs and\nprovide new loop contributions to its mass. New Yukawa couplings are sizable\nand large supersymmetry breaking is not needed to lift the Higgs mass. To avoid\na Landau pole for the new Yukawa couplings, these fields are charged under a\nnew gauge group, which confines and leads to a Hidden Valley-like\nphenomenology. The Hidden Valley sector is almost supersymmetric and ordinary\nsparticles decay to exotic new states which decay back to Standard Model\nparticles and gravitinos with reduced missing energy. We construct a simplified\nmodel to simulate this scenario and find a viable parameter space of specific\nbenchmark models which ameliorates both of the major phenomenological problems\nwith supersymmetry.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Collaboration has recently released a\ncatalog of 360 sources detected above 50 GeV (2FHL). This catalog was obtained\nusing 80 months of data re-processed with Pass 8, the newest event-level\nanalysis, which significantly improves the acceptance and angular resolution of\nthe instrument. Most of the 2FHL sources at high Galactic latitude are blazars.\nUsing detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we measure, for the first time, the\nsource count distribution, $dN/dS$, of extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray sources at\n$E>50$ GeV and find that it is compatible with a Euclidean distribution down to\nthe lowest measured source flux in the 2FHL ($\\sim8\\times 10^{-12}$ ph\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We employ a one-point photon fluctuation analysis to\nconstrain the behavior of $dN/dS$ below the source detection threshold. Overall\nthe source count distribution is constrained over three decades in flux and\nfound compatible with a broken power law with a break flux, $S_b$, in the range\n$[8 \\times 10^{-12},1.5 \\times 10^{-11}]$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and power-law\nindices below and above the break of $\\alpha_2 \\in [1.60,1.75]$ and $\\alpha_1 =\n2.49 \\pm 0.12$ respectively. Integration of $dN/dS$ shows that point sources\naccount for at least $86^{+16}_{-14}\\%$ of the total extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray\nbackground. The simple form of the derived source count distribution is\nconsistent with a single population (i.e. blazars) dominating the source counts\nto the minimum flux explored by this analysis. We estimate the density of\nsources detectable in blind surveys that will be performed in the coming years\nby the Cherenkov Telescope Array.\n", "  The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field with a self-interaction\nterm $\\lambda\\phi^4$ in anti-de Sitter space is investigated. We numerically\ninvestigate the effect of the self-interaction term on the critical amplitudes,\nforming time of apparent horizon, stable island and energy transformation. The\nresults show that a positive $\\lambda$ suppresses the formation of black hole,\nwhile a negative $\\lambda$ enhances the process. We define two susceptibilities\nto characterize the effect of the self-interaction on the black hole formation,\nand find that near the critical amplitude, there exists a universal scaling\nrelation with the critical exponent $\\alpha \\approx 0.74$ for the time of black\nhole formation.\n", "  We describe a system for generating frequency-chirped and amplitude-shaped\npulses on time scales from sub-nanosecond to ten nanoseconds. The system starts\nwith cw diode-laser light at 780 nm and utilizes fiber-based electro-optical\nphase and intensity modulators, driven by an arbitrary waveform generator, to\ngenerate the shaped pulses. These pulses are subsequently amplified to several\nhundred mW with a tapered amplifier in a delayed double-pass configuration.\nFrequency chirps up to 5 GHz in 2 ns and pulse widths as short as 0.15 ns have\nbeen realized.\n", "  We carried out observations toward the giant molecular cloud W 37 with the $J\n= 1 - 0$ transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O using the 13.7 m\nsingle-dish telescope at the Delingha station of Purple Mountain Observatory.\nBased on the three CO lines, we calculated the column densities, cloud masses\nfor the molecular clouds with radial velocities at around $+20 \\mathrm{km\ns}^{-1}$. The gas mass of W 37, calculated from $^{13}$CO emission, is\n$1.7\\times10^5 M_\\odot$, above the criteria of giant molecular cloud. The dense\nridge of W 37 is a dense filament, which is supercritical in linear mass ratio.\nDense clumps found by C$^{18}$O emission are aligned along the dense ridge with\na regular interval about 2.8 pc, similar to the clump separation caused by\nlarge-scale `sausage instability'. We confirm the identification of the giant\nmolecular filament (GMF) G 18.0-16.8 by \\cite{2014A&A...568A..73R} and find a\nnew giant filament, G16.5-15.8, located in the west 0.8 degree of G 18.0-16.8.\nBoth GMFs are not gravitationally bound, as indicated by their low linear mass\nratio ($\\sim80 M_\\odot \\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$). We compared the gas temperature map\nwith the dust temperature map from \\emph{Herschel} images, and find similar\nstructures. The spatial distributions of class I objects and the dense clumps\nis reminiscent of triggered star formation occurring in the northwestern part\nof W 37, which is close to NGC 6611.\n", "  We investigate a multipartite ferromagnetic model without self-interactions\nbetween spins of the same party, so that the Hamiltonian is not a definite\nquadratic form of the magnetisations. We find the free energy and study the\nphase transition for all zero external fields. Moreover in the bipartite case\nwe analyse the fluctuations of the rescaled magnetisations, below and at the\ncritical point, and we study the phase transitions with non zero magnetic\nfields.\n", "  Multiple analyses from ATLAS and CMS collaborations, including searches for\nttH production, supersymmetric particles and vector-like quarks, observed\nexcesses in the same-sign dilepton channel containing b-jets and missing\ntransverse energy in the LHC Run 1 data. In the context of little Higgs\ntheories with T parity, we explain these excesses using vector-like T-odd\nquarks decaying into a top quark, a W boson and the lightest T-odd particle\n(LTP). For heavy vector-like quarks, decay topologies containing the LTP have\nnot been searched for at the LHC. The bounds on the masses of the T-odd quarks\ncan be estimated in a simplified model approach by adapting the search limits\nfor top/bottom squarks in supersymmetry. Assuming a realistic decay branching\nfraction, a benchmark with a 750 GeV T-odd b-prime quark is proposed. We also\ncomment on the possibility to fit excesses in different analyses in a common\nframework.\n", "  We propose a fast and efficient estimation method that is able to accurately\nrecover the parameters of a d-dimensional Hawkes point-process from a set of\nobservations. We exploit a mean-field approximation that is valid when the\nfluctuations of the stochastic intensity are small. We show that this is\nnotably the case in situations when interactions are sufficiently weak, when\nthe dimension of the system is high or when the fluctuations are self-averaging\ndue to the large number of past events they involve. In such a regime the\nestimation of a Hawkes process can be mapped on a least-squares problem for\nwhich we provide an analytic solution. Though this estimator is biased, we show\nthat its precision can be comparable to the one of the Maximum Likelihood\nEstimator while its computation speed is shown to be improved considerably. We\ngive a theoretical control on the accuracy of our new approach and illustrate\nits efficiency using synthetic datasets, in order to assess the statistical\nestimation error of the parameters.\n", "  A hollow bottle-like microresonator (BLMR) with ultra-high quality factor is\nfabricated from a microcapillary with nearly parabolic profile. At 1.55 $\\mu m$\npumping, degenerate four-wave mixing can be observed for a BLMR of diameter 102\n$\\mu$m. The parabolic profile of the BLMR guarantees a nearly zero waveguide\ndispersion, which is theoretically discussed in detail. From the simulation, at\n1.55 $\\mu$m wavelength in such a BLMR, the fundamental bottle mode is in the\nanomalous dispersion regime, whilst the ordinary whispering gallery mode (WGM)\nconfined at the center of the BLMR is in the normal dispersion regime.\nExperimentally, no degenerate FWM is observed for the WGM selected by\npositioning the coupling tapered fiber in the same BLMR. Furthermore,\ndispersion tuning is briefly discussed. As the work predicted, the BLMR shows\npromise for the implementation of sparsely distributed, widely spanned\nfrequency combs at the telecommunication wavelength.\n", "  Here, we present a novel microscopic technique for measuring\nwavelength-dependent three-dimensional (3-D) distributions of the refractive\nindices (RIs) of microscopic samples in the visible wavelengths. Employing 3-D\nquantitative phase microscopy techniques with a wavelength-swept source, 3-D RI\ntomograms were obtained in the range of 450 - 700 nm with a spectral resolution\nof a few nanometers. The capability of the technique was demonstrated by\nmeasuring the hyperspectral 3-D RI tomograms of polystyrene beads, human red\nblood cells, and hepatocytes. The results demonstrate the potential for\nlabel-free molecular specific 3-D tomography of biological samples.\n", "  Electroweak radiative corrections to the production of high-multiplicity\nfinal states with several intermediate resonances in most cases can be\nsufficiently well described by the leading contribution of an expansion about\nthe resonance poles. In this approach, also known as pole approximation,\ncorrections are classified into separately gauge-invariant factorizable and\nnon-factorizable corrections, where the former can be attributed to the\nproduction and decay of the unstable particles on their mass shell. The\nremaining non-factorizable corrections are induced by the exchange of soft\nphotons between different production and decay subprocesses. We give explicit\nanalytical results for the non-factorizable photonic virtual corrections to the\nproduction of an arbitrary number of unstable particles at the one-loop level\nand, thus, deliver an essential building block in the calculation of\nnext-to-leading-order electroweak corrections in pole approximation. The\nremaining virtual factorizable corrections can be obtained with modern\nautomated one-loop matrix-element generators, while the evaluation of the\ncorresponding real photonic corrections can be evaluated with full matrix\nelements by multi-purpose Monte Carlo generators. Our results can be easily\nmodified to non-factorizable QCD corrections, which are induced by soft-gluon\nexchange.\n", "  Box graphs, or equivalently Coulomb phases of three-dimensional N=2\nsupersymmetric gauge theories with matter, give a succinct, comprehensive and\nelegant characterization of crepant resolutions of singular elliptically\nfibered varieties. Furthermore, the box graphs predict that the phases are\norganized in terms of a network of flop transitions. The geometric construction\nof the resolutions associated to the phases is, however, a difficult problem.\nHere, we identify a correspondence between box graphs for the gauge algebras\nsu(2k+1) with resolutions obtained using toric tops and generalizations\nthereof. Moreover, flop transitions between different such resolutions agree\nwith those predicted by the box graphs. Our results thereby provide explicit\nrealizations of the box graph resolutions.\n", "  We demonstrate hybridization of optical cavity photons with atomic Rydberg\nexcitations using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The resulting\ndark state Rydberg polaritons exhibit a compressed frequency spectrum and\nenhanced lifetime indicating strong light-matter mixing. We study the coherence\nproperties of cavity Rydberg polaritons and identify the generalized EIT\nlinewidth for optical cavities. Strong collective coupling suppresses polariton\nlosses due to inhomogeneous broadening, which we demonstrate by using different\nRydberg levels with a range of polarizabilities. Our results point the way\ntowards using cavity Rydberg polaritons as a platform for creating photonic\nquantum materials.\n", "  We investigate the topological phase transitions in graphene under the\nmodulation of circularly polarized light, by analyzing the changes of edge\nstates and its topological structures. A full phase diagram, with up to ten\ndifferent topological phases, is presented in the parameter space spanned by\nthe driving frequency and light strength. We find that the high-Chern number\nbehavior is very common in the driven system. While the one-photon resonance\ncan create the chiral edge states in the $\\pi-$gap, the two-photon resonance\nwill induce the counter-propagating edge modes in the zero-energy gap. When the\ndriving light strength is strong, the number and even the chirality of the edge\nstates may change in the $\\pi-$gap. The robustness of the edge states to\ndisorder potential are also examined. We close by discussing the feasibility of\nexperimental proposals.\n", "  To date no direct detection of Lyman continuum emission has been measured for\nintermediate--redshift z~1 star-forming galaxies . We combine HST grism\nspectroscopy with GALEX UV and ground--based optical imaging to extend the\nsearch for escaping Lyman continuum to a large (~600) sample of z~1 low-mass,\nmoderately star-forming galaxies selected initially on H$\\alpha$ emission. The\ncharacteristic escape fraction of LyC from SFGs that populate this parameter\nspace remains weakly constrained by previous surveys, but these faint SFGs are\nassumed to play a significant role in the reionization of neutral hydrogen in\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift (z>6). We do not make an\nunambiguous detection of escaping LyC radiation from this $z\\sim1$ sample,\nindividual non--detections to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape\nfraction, $f_{esc}$<2.1% (3$\\sigma$). We measure upper limits of $f_{esc}$<9.6%\nfrom a sample of SFGs selected on high H$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW>200\\AA),\nwhich are thought to be close analogs of high redshift sources of reionization.\nFor reference, we also present an emissivity--weighted escape fraction which is\nuseful as a measurement of the general contribution of the SFGs to the z~1\nionizing UV background. In the discussion, we consider the implications of\nthese intermediate redshift constraints for the reionization of hydrogen in the\nintergalactic medium at high (z > 6) redshift. If we assume our $z\\sim1$ SFGs,\nfor which we measure this emissivity-weighted $f_{esc}$, are analogs to the\nhigh redshift sources of reionization, we find is difficult reconcile\nreionization by faint (M$_{UV}<-13$) SFGs with a low escape fraction\n($f_{esc}<$3%), with constraints from independent high redshift observations.\nIf $f_{esc}$ evolves with redshift, reionization by SFGs may be consistent with\nobservations from Planck.\n", "  We report measured rate coefficients for electron-ion recombination for Si10+\nforming Si9+ and for Si9+ forming Si8+, respectively. The measurements were\nperformed using the electron-ion merged-beams technique at a heavy-ion storage\nring. Electron-ion collision energies ranged from 0 to 50 eV for Si9+ and from\n0 to 2000 eV for Si10+, thus, extending previous measurements for Si10+ [Orban\net al. 2010, Astrophys. J. 721, 1603] to much higher energies. Experimentally\nderived rate coefficients for the recombination of Si9+ and Si10+ ions in a\nplasma are presented along with simple parameterizations. These rate\ncoefficients are useful for the modeling of the charge balance of silicon in\nphotoionized plasmas (Si9+ and Si10+) and in collisionally ionized plasmas\n(Si10+ only). In the corresponding temperature ranges, the experimentally\nderived rate coefficients agree with the latest corresponding theoretical\nresults within the experimental uncertainties.\n", "  Current template-based gravitational wave searches for compact binary\ncoalescences (CBC) use waveform models that neglect the higher order modes\ncontent of the gravitational radiation emitted, considering only the\nquadrupolar $(\\ell,|m|)=(2,2)$ modes. We study the effect of such a neglection\nfor the case of aligned-spin CBC searches for equal-spin (and non-spinning)\nbinary black holes in the context of two versions of Advanced LIGO: the\nupcoming 2015 version, known as early Advanced LIGO (eaLIGO) and its\nZero-Detuned High Energy Power version, that we will refer to as Advanced LIGO\n(AdvLIGO). In addition, we study the case of a non-spinning search for initial\nLIGO (iLIGO). We do this via computing the effectualness of the aligned-spin\nSEOBNRv1 ROM waveform family, which only considers quadrupolar modes, towards\nhybrid post-Newtonian/Numerical Relativity waveforms which contain higher order\nmodes. We find that for all LIGO versions, losses of more than $10\\%$ of events\noccur for mass ratio $q\\geq6$ and $M \\geq 100M_\\odot$ due to the neglection of\nhigher modes. Moreover, for iLIGO and eaLIGO, losses notably increase up to\n$(39,23)\\%$ respectively for the highest mass $(220M_\\odot)$ and mass ratio\n($q=8$) studied. For the case of early AdvLIGO, losses of $10\\%$ occur for\n$M>50M_\\odot$ and $q\\geq6$. Neglection of higher modes leads to\nobservation-averaged systematic parameter biases towards lower spin, total mass\nand chirp mass. For completeness, we perform a preliminar, non-exhaustive\ncomparison of systematic biases to statistical errors. We find that, for a\ngiven SNR, systematic biases dominate over statistical errors at much lower\ntotal mass for eaLIGO than for AdvLIGO.\n", "  The excitation of precursor solitons ahead of a rapidly moving object in a\nfluid, a spectacular phenomenon in hydrodynamics that has often been observed\nahead of moving ships, has surprisingly not been investigated in plasmas where\nthe fluid model holds good for low frequency excitations such as ion acoustic\nwaves. In this paper we report the first experimental observation of precursor\nsolitons in a flowing dusty plasma. The nonlinear solitary dust acoustic waves\n(DAWs) are excited by a supersonic mass flow of the dust particles over an\nelectrostatic potential hill. In a frame where the fluid is stationary and the\nhill is moving the solitons propagate in the upstream direction as precursors\nwhile wake structures consisting of linear DAWs are seen to propagate in the\ndownstream region. A theoretical explanation of these excitations based on the\nforced Korteweg-deVries model equation is provided and their practical\nimplications in situations involving a charged object moving in a plasma are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs) are computed\nfrom numerical simulations of a freely evolving mixed layer (ML) front in a\nzonal channel undergoing baroclinic instability. The 3D FTLEs show a complex\nstructure, with features that are less defined than the two-dimensional (2D)\nFTLEs, suggesting that stirring is not confined to the edges of vortices and\nalong filaments and posing significant consequences on mixing. The magnitude of\nthe FTLEs is observed to be strongly determined by the vertical shear. A\nscaling law relating the local FTLEs and the nonlocal density contrast used to\ninitialize the ML front is derived assuming thermal wind balance. The scaling\nlaw only converges to the values found from the simulations within the\npycnocline, while it displays differences within the ML, where the\ninstabilities show a large ageostrophic component. The probability distribution\nfunctions of 2D and 3D FTLEs are found to be non Gaussian at all depths. In the\nML, the FTLEs wavenumber spectra display -1 slopes, while in the pycnocline,\nthe FTLEs wavenumber spectra display -2 slopes, corresponding to frontal\ndynamics. Close to the surface, the geodesic Lagrangian Coherent Structures\n(LCSs) reveal a complex stirring structure, with elliptic structures detaching\nfrom the frontal region. In the pycnocline, LCSs are able to detect filamentary\nstructures that are not captured by the Eulerian fields.\n", "  We use a detailed numerical model of stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering\nto compute mode instability thresholds in Tm$^{3+}$-doped fiber amplifiers. The\nfiber amplifies 2040 nm light using a 790 nm pump. The cross-relaxation process\nis strong, permitting power efficiencies of 60%. The predicted instability\nthresholds are compared with those in similar Yb$^{3+}$-doped fiber amplifiers\nwith 976 nm pump and 1060 nm signal, and are found to be higher, even though\nthe heat load is much higher in Tm-doped amplifiers. The higher threshold in\nthe Tm-doped fiber is attributed to its longer signal wavelength, and to\nstronger gain saturation, due in part to cross-relaxation heating.\n", "  From black hole thermodynamics, the Bekenstein bound has been proposed as a\nuniversal thermal entropy bound. It has been further generalized to an\nentanglement entropy bound which is valid even in a quantum system. In a\nquantumly entangled system, the non-negativity of the relative entropy leads to\nthe entanglement entropy bound. When the entanglement entropy bound is\nsaturated, a quantum system satisfies the thermodynamics-like law with an\nappropriately defined entanglement temperature. We show that the saturation of\nthe entanglement entropy bound accounts for a universal feature of the\nentanglement temperature proportional to the inverse of the system size. In\naddition, we show that the deformed modular Hamiltonian under a global quench\nalso satisfies the generalized entanglement entropy boundary after introducing\na new quantity called the entanglement chemical potential.\n", "  We exploit offshell regions in the process $e^+e^-\\rightarrow W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$\nto gain access to the top-quark width. Working at next-to-leading order in QCD\nwe show that carefully selected ratios of offshell regions to onshell regions\nin the reconstructed top and antitop invariant mass spectra are,\n\\emph{independently} of the coupling $g_{tbW}$, sensitive to the top-quark\nwidth. We explore this approach for different centre of mass energies and\ninitial-state beam polarisations at $e^+e^-$ colliders and briefly comment on\nthe applicability of this method for a measurement of the top-quark width at\nthe LHC.\n", "  In this paper, we analytically investigate the properties of holographic\nsuperconductors in higher dimensions in the framework of Born-Infeld\nelectrodynamics taking into account the backreaction of the spacetime using the\nSturm-Liouville eigenvalue method. In the background of pure Einstein and\nGauss-Bonnet gravity, based on a perturbative approach, we obtain the relation\nbetween the critical temperature and the charge density. Higher value of the\nbackreaction and Born-Infeld parameters result in a harder condensation to form\nin both cases. The analytical results are found to agree with the existing\nnumerical results. We also derive an expression for the condensation operator\nin $d$-dimensions which yields the critical exponent to be $1/2$.\n", "  The form factors of the semileptonic $B\\to \\pi\\pi\\ell\\bar\\nu$ decay are\ncalculated from QCD light-cone sum rules with the distribution amplitudes of\ndipion states. This method is valid in the kinematical region, where the\nhadronic dipion state has a small invariant mass and simultaneously a large\nrecoil. The derivation of the sum rules is complicated by the presence of an\nadditional variable related to the angle between the two pions. In particular,\nwe realize that not all invariant amplitudes in the underlying correlation\nfunction can be used, some of them generating kinematical singularities in the\ndispersion relation. The two sum rules that are free from these ambiguities are\nobtained in the leading twist-2 approximation, predicting the $\\bar{B}^0\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^0$ form factors $F_{\\perp}$ and $F_{\\parallel}$ of the vector and\naxial $b\\to u$ current, respectively. We calculate these form factors at the\nmomentum transfers $0<q^2\\lesssim 12 $ GeV$^2$ and at the dipion mass close to\nthe threshold $4m_\\pi^2$. The sum rule results indicate that the contributions\nof the higher partial waves to the form factors are suppressed with respect to\nthe lowest $P$-wave contribution and that the latter is not completely\nsaturated by the $\\rho$-meson term.\n", "  We suggest a novel optical parametric generator (OPG) in which one of the\ndown-converted beams is spontaneously generated along the Poynting vector of\nthe pump beam. In this configuration, the generation takes advantage of the\nwalk-off of the extraordinary pump rather than being degraded by it. As a\nresult the generated beams, signal and idler, are bright, due to a high\nconversion efficiency, spatially nearly single-mode, due to the preferred\ndirection of the Poynting vector, tuneable over a wide range of wavelengths,\nand broadband. The two beams are also correlated in frequency and in the photon\nnumber per pulse. Furthermore due to their thermal statistics these beams can\nbe used as a pump to efficiently generate other nonlinear processes.\n", "  We investigated the dynamics of the interaction between spin-polarized\nphoto-created carriers and Mn ions on InGaAs/GaAs:Mn structures. The carriers\nare confined in an InGaAs quantum well and the Mn ions come from a Mn\ndelta-layer grown at the GaAs barrier close to the well. Even though the\ncarriers and the Mn ions are spatially separated, the interaction between them\nis demonstrated by time-resolved spin-polarized photoluminescence measurements.\nUsing a pre-pulse laser excitation with an opposite circular-polarization\nclearly reduces the polarization degree of the quantum-well emission for\nsamples where a strong magnetic interaction is observed. The results\ndemonstrate that the Mn ions act as a spin-memory that can be optically\ncontrolled by the polarization of the photocreated carriers. On the other hand,\nthe spin-polarized Mn ions also affect the spin-polarization of the\nsubsequently created carriers as observed by their spin relaxation time. These\neffects fade away with increasing time delays between the pulses as well as\nwith increasing temperatures.\n", "  The eigenvalue PDF for some well known classes of non-Hermitian random\nmatrices --- the complex Ginibre ensemble for example --- can be interpreted as\nthe Boltzmann factor for one-component plasma systems in two-dimensional\ndomains. We address this theme in a systematic fashion, identifying the plasma\nsystem for the Ginibre ensemble of non-Hermitian Gaussian random matrices $G$,\nthe spherical ensemble of the product of an inverse Ginibre matrix and a\nGinibre matrix $G_1^{-1} G_2$, and the ensemble formed by truncating unitary\nmatrices, as well as for products of such matrices. We do this when each has\neither real, complex or real quaternion elements. One consequence of this\nanalogy is that the leading form of the eigenvalue density follows as a\ncorollary. Another is that the eigenvalue correlations must obey sum rules\nknown to characterise the plasma system, and this leads us to a exhibit an\nintegral identity satisfied by the two-particle correlation for real quaternion\nmatrices in the neighbourhood of the real axis. Further random matrix ensembles\ninvestigated from this viewpoint are self dual non-Hermitian matrices, in which\na previous study has related to the one-component plasma system in a disk at\ninverse temperature $\\beta = 4$, and the ensemble formed by the single row and\ncolumn of quaternion elements from a member of the circular symplectic\nensemble.\n", "  This article provides a brief review of how various spectroscopies have been\nused to investitage many-body quantum phenomena in the context of ultracold\nFermi gases. In particular, work done with RF spectroscopy, Bragg spectroscopy\nand lattice modulation spectroscopy is considered. The theoretical basis of\nthese spectroscopies, namely linear response theory in the many-body quantum\nphysics context is briefly presented. Experiments related to the BCS-BEC\ncrossover, imbalanced Fermi gases, polarons, possible pseudogap and Fermi\nliquid behaviour and measuring the contact are discussed. Remaining open\nproblems and goals in the field are sketched from the perspective how\nspectroscopies could contribute.\n", "  In this work we present a determinant expression for the domain-wall boundary\ncondition partition function of rational (XXX) Richardson-Gaudin models which,\nin addition to $N-1$ spins $\\frac{1}{2}$, contains one arbitrarily large spin\n$S$.\n  The proposed determinant representation is written in terms of a set of\nvariables which, from previous work, are known to define eigenstates of the\nquantum integrable models belonging to this class as solutions to quadratic\nBethe equations. Such a determinant can be useful numerically since systems of\nquadratic equations are much simpler to solve than the usual highly non-linear\nBethe equations. It can therefore offer significant gains in stability and\ncomputation speed.\n", "  It is well established that the anomalous Hall effect that a ferromagnet\ndisplays scales with its magnetization. Therefore, an antiferromagnet that has\nno net magnetization should exhibit no anomalous Hall effect. Here we show that\nthe non-collinear triangular antiferromagnet Mn3Ge exhibits a large anomalous\nHall effect comparable to that of ferromagnetic metals; the magnitude of the\nanomalous conductivity is 500 per ohm per cm at 2 K and 50 per ohm per cm at\nroom temperature. The angular dependence of the anomalous Hall effect\nmeasurements confirm that the small residual in-plane magnetic moment has no\nrole in the observed effect. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the\nlarge anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge originates from a non-vanishing Berry\ncurvature that arises from the chiral spin structure, and which also results in\na large spin Hall effect, comparable to that of platinum. The present results\npave the way to realize room temperature antiferromagnetic spintronics and spin\nHall effect based data storage devices.\n", "  The spread of one disease, in some cases, can stimulate the spreading of\nanother infectious disease. Here, we treat analytically a symmetric coinfection\nmodel for spreading of two diseases on a two-layer multiplex network. We allow\nlayer overlapping, but we assume that each layer is random and locally\nloopless. Infection with one of the diseases increases the probability of\ngetting infected with the other. Using the generating function method, we\ncalculate exactly the fraction of individuals infected with both diseases\n(so-called coinfected clusters) in the stationary state, as well as the\nepidemic spreading thresholds and the phase diagram of the model.With\nincreasing cooperation, we observe a tricritical point and the type of\ntransition changes from continuous to hybrid. Finally, we compare the\ncoinfected clusters in the case of cooperating diseases with the so-called\n\"viable\" clusters in networks with dependencies.\n", "  We investigate the electro-optic properties of black phosphorus (BP) thin\nfilms for optical modulation in the mid-infrared frequencies. Our calculation\nindicates that an applied out-of-plane electric field may lead to red-, blue-,\nor bidirectional shift in BP's absorption edge. This is due to the interplay\nbetween the field-induced quantum-confined Franz-Keldysh effect and the\nPauli-blocked Burstein-Moss shift. The relative contribution of the two\nelectro-absorption mechanisms depends on doping range, operating wavelength,\nand BP film thickness. For proof-of concept, simple modulator configuration\nwith BP overlaid over a silicon nanowire is studied. Simulation result shows\nthat operating BP in the quantum-confined Franz-Keldysh regime can enable\nimproved maximal attainable absorption as well as power efficiency compared to\nits graphene counterpart.\n", "  Granger causality has been used for the investigation of the inter-dependence\nstructure of the underlying systems of multi-variate time series. In\nparticular, the direct causal effects are commonly estimated by the conditional\nGranger causality index (CGCI). In the presence of many observed variables and\nrelatively short time series, CGCI may fail because it is based on vector\nautoregressive models (VAR) involving a large number of coefficients to be\nestimated. In this work, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the\nrecently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged\nvariables and the CGCI is combined with BTS. Further, the proposed approach is\ncompared favorably to other restricted VAR representations, such as the\ntop-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy, and the least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (LASSO), in terms of sensitivity and specificity of CGCI.\nThis is shown by using simulations of linear and nonlinear, low and\nhigh-dimensional systems and different time series lengths. For nonlinear\nsystems, CGCI from the restricted VAR representations are compared with\nanalogous nonlinear causality indices. Further, CGCI in conjunction with BTS\nand other restricted VAR representations is applied to multi-channel scalp\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients containing\nepileptiform discharges. CGCI on the restricted VAR, and BTS in particular,\ncould track the changes in brain connectivity before, during and after\nepileptiform discharges, which was not possible using the full VAR\nrepresentation.\n", "  We describe a hybrid pixel array detector (EMPAD - electron microscope pixel\narray detector) adapted for use in electron microscope applications, especially\nas a universal detector for scanning transmission electron microscopy. The 128\nx 128 pixel detector consists of a 500 um thick silicon diode array bump-bonded\npixel-by-pixel to an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The\nin-pixel circuitry provides a 1,000,000:1 dynamic range within a single frame,\nallowing the direct electron beam to be imaged while still maintaining single\nelectron sensitivity. A 1.1 kHz framing rate enables rapid data collection and\nminimizes sample drift distortions while scanning. By capturing the entire\nunsaturated diffraction pattern in scanning mode, one can simultaneously\ncapture bright field, dark field, and phase contrast information, as well as\nbeing able to analyze the full scattering distribution, allowing true center of\nmass imaging. The scattering is recorded on an absolute scale, so that\ninformation such as local sample thickness can be directly determined. This\npaper describes the detector architecture, data acquisition (DAQ) system, and\npreliminary results from experiments with 80 to 200 keV electron beams.\n", "  A new infinite-size limit of strings in RxS2 is presented. The limit is\nobtained from single spike strings by letting by letting the angular velocity\nparameter omega become infinite. We derive the energy-momenta relation of\nomega-infinity single spikes as their linear velocity v-->1 and their angular\nmomentum J-->1. Generally, the v-->1, J-->1 limit of single spikes is singular\nand has to be excluded from the spectrum and be studied separately. We discover\nthat the dispersion relation of omega-infinity single spikes contains\nlogarithms in the limit J-->1. This result is somewhat surprising, since the\nlogarithmic behavior in the string spectra is typically associated with their\nmotion in non-compact spaces such as AdS. Omega-infinity single spikes seem to\ncompletely cover the surface of the 2-sphere they occupy, so that they may\nessentially be viewed as some sort of \"brany strings\". A proof of the\nsphere-filling property of omega-infinity single spikes is given in the\nappendix.\n", "  The distances of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources are currently unknown. We\nshow that the 21-cm absorption line of hydrogen can be used to infer the\nredshifts of FRB sources, and determine whether they are Galactic or\nextragalactic. We calculate a probability of $\\sim 10\\%$ for the host galaxy of\nan FRB to exhibit a 21-cm absorption feature of equivalent width $\\gtrsim 10\n~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Arecibo, along with several future radio\nobservatories, should be capable of detecting such associated 21-cm absorption\nsignals for strong bursts of $\\gtrsim {\\rm several}~\\mathrm{Jy}$ peak flux\ndensities.\n", "  We determine closed and compact expressions for the epsilon-expansion of\ncertain Gaussian hypergeometric functions expanded around half-integer values\nby explicitly solving for their recurrence relations. This epsilon-expansion is\nidentified with the normalized solution of the underlying Fuchs system of four\nregular singular points. We compute its regularized zeta series (giving rise to\ntwo independent associators) whose ratio gives the epsilon-expansion at a\nspecific value. Furthermore, we use the well known one-loop massive bubble\nintegral as an example to demonstrate how to obtain all-order\nepsilon-expansions for Feynman integrals and how to construct representations\nfor Feynman integrals in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. We use\nthe method of differential equations in combination with the recently\nestablished general solution for recurrence relations with non-commutative\ncoefficients.\n", "  We have simulated the formation of a massive galaxy cluster (M$_{200}^{\\rm\ncrit}$ = 1.1$\\times$10$^{15}h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe using\n10 different codes (RAMSES, 2 incarnations of AREPO and 7 of GADGET), modeling\nhydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. These codes include\nSmoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), spanning traditional and advanced SPH\nschemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. Our goal is to study the\nconsistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiative\nphysical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and AGN feedback. We\ncompare images of the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, and\nradial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. We find\nthat, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrally\nconcentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of AGN\nfeedback. The scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than for\nnon-radiative runs. Intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washed\naway the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen for\nnon-radiative simulations in Sembolini et al. (2015): radiative physics +\nclassic SPH can produce entropy cores. Furthermore, the inclusion/absence of\nAGN feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellar\ncontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and a\nfalling central entropy profile. However, AGN feedback does strongly affect the\noverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducing\nsensibly the stellar fraction.\n", "  We demonstrate strong exciton-plasmon coupling in silver nanodisk arrays\nintegrated with monolayer MoS2 via angle-resolved reflectance microscopy\nspectra of the coupled system. Strong exciton-plasmon coupling is observed with\nthe exciton-plasmon coupling strength up to 58 meV at 77 K, which also survives\nat room temperature. The strong coupling involves three types of resonances:\nMoS2 excitons, localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of individual\nsilver nanodisks and plasmonic lattice resonances of the nanodisk array. We\nshow that the exciton-plasmon coupling strength, polariton composition and\ndispersion can be effectively engineered by tuning the geometry of the\nplasmonic lattice, which makes the system promising for realizing novel\ntwo-dimensional plasmonic polaritonic devices.\n", "  A nanometer-thin-cell (in the direction of laser beam propagation) has been\nelaborated with the thickness of the atomic vapor column varying smoothly in\nthe range of $L = \\unit[50-1500]{nm}$. The cell allows one to study the\nbehavior of the resonance absorption over the $D_1$ line of potassium atoms by\nvarying the laser intensity and the cell thickness from $L = \\lambda / 2$ to $L\n= 2 \\lambda$ with the step $\\lambda/2$ ($\\lambda =\\unit[770]{nm}$ is the\nresonant wavelength of the laser). It is shown that despite the huge Doppler\nbroadening ($>\\unit[0.9]{GHz}$ at the cell temperature\n$\\unit[170]{^{\\circ}C}$), at low laser intensities a narrowing of the resonance\nabsorption spectrum is observed for $L = \\lambda/2$ ($\\sim \\unit[120]{ MHz}$ at\nFWHM) and $L = 3/2 \\lambda$, whereas for $L = \\lambda$ and $L =2\\lambda$ the\nspectrum broadens. At moderate laser intensities narrowband velocity selective\noptical pumping (VSOP) resonances appear at $L = \\lambda$ and $L=2\\lambda $\nwith the linewidth close to the natural one. A comparison with saturated\nabsorption spectra obtained in a 1-cm-sized K cell is presented. The developed\ntheoretical model well describes the experiment.\n", "  In the wake of the intense effort made for the experimental CILEX project,\nnumerical simulation cam- paigns have been carried out in order to finalize the\ndesign of the facility and to identify optimal laser and plasma parameters.\nThese simulations bring, of course, important insight into the fundamental\nphysics at play. As a by-product, they also characterize the quality of our\ntheoretical and numerical models. In this paper, we compare the results given\nby different codes and point out algorithmic lim- itations both in terms of\nphysical accuracy and computational performances. These limitations are illu-\nstrated in the context of electron laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA). The\nmain limitation we identify in state-of-the-art Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes is\ncomputational load imbalance. We propose an innovative algorithm to deal with\nthis specific issue as well as milestones towards a modern, accurate high-per-\nformance PIC code for high energy particle acceleration.\n", "  Conventional quantum mechanics describes a pre- and post-selected system in\nterms of virtual (Feynman) paths via which the final state can be reached. In\nthe absence of probabilities, a weak measurement (WM) determines the\nprobability amplitudes for the paths involved. The weak values (VW) can be\nidentified with these amplitudes, or their linear combinations. This allows us\nto explain the \"unusual\" properties of the VW, and avoid the \"paradoxes\" often\nassociated with the WM.\n", "  In order to study the unstable step motion on vicinal crystal surfaces we\ndevise vicinal Cellular Automata. Each cell from the colony has value equal to\nits height in the vicinal, initially the steps are regularly distributed.\nAnother array keeps the adatoms, initially distributed randomly over the\nsurface. The growth rule defines that each adatom at right nearest neighbor\nposition to a (multi-) step attaches to it. The update of whole colony is\nperformed at once and then time increases. This execution of the growth rule is\nfollowed by compensation of the consumed particles and by diffusional update(s)\nof the adatom population. Two principal sources of instability are employed:\nbiased diffusion and infinite inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier (iiSE). Since\nthese factors are not opposed by step-step repulsion the formation of\nmulti-steps is observed but in general the step bunches preserve a finite\nwidth. We monitor the developing surface patterns and quantify the observations\nby scaling laws with focus on the eventual transition from diffusion-limited to\nkinetics-limited phenomenon. The time-scaling exponent of the bunch size N is\n1/2 for the case of biased diffusion and 1/3 for the case of iiSE. Additional\ndistinction is possible based on the time-scaling exponents of the sizes of\nmulti-steps, these are 0.36-0.4 (for biased diffusion) and 1/4 (iiSE).\n", "  Parallel pumping of nuclear spin waves in antiferromagnetic CsMnF3 at liquid\nhelium temperatures and magnetoelastic waves in antiferromagnetic FeBO3 at\nliquid nitrogen temperature in a helical resonator was studied. It was found\nthat the absorbed microwave power is approximately equal to the irradiated\npower from the sample and that the main restriction mechanism of absortption in\nboth cases is defined by the nonlinear radiation damping predicted about two\ndecades ago. We believe that the nonlinear radiation damping is a common\nfeature of parallel pumping technique of all normal magnetic excitations and it\ncan be detected by purposeful experiments.\n", "  Room-temperature fluorescence detection of the nitrogen-vacancy center\nelectronic spin typically has low signal to noise, requiring long experiments\nto reveal an averaged signal. Here, we present a simple approach to analysis of\ntime-resolved fluorescence data that permits an improvement in measurement\nprecision through signal processing alone. Applying our technique to\nexperimental data reveals an improvement in signal to noise equivalent to a 14%\nincrease in photon collection efficiency. We further explore the dependence of\nthe signal to noise ratio on excitation power, and analyze our results using a\nrate equation model. Our results provide a rubric for optimizing fluorescence\nspin detection, which has direct implications for improving precision of\nnitrogen-vacancy-based sensors.\n", "  Current large-aperture cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes have\nnearly maximized the number of detectors that can be illuminated while\nmaintaining diffraction-limited image quality. The polarization-sensitive\ndetector arrays being deployed in these telescopes in the next few years will\nhave roughly $10^4$ detectors. Increasing the mapping speed of future\ninstruments by at least an order of magnitude is important to enable precise\nprobes of the inflationary paradigm in the first fraction of a second after the\nbig bang and provide strong constraints on cosmological parameters. The CMB\ncommunity has begun planning a next generation \"Stage IV\" CMB project that will\nbe comprised of multiple telescopes with between $10^5$ - $10^6$ detectors to\npursue these goals. This paper introduces new crossed Dragone telescope and\nreceiver optics designs that increase the usable diffraction-limited\nfield-of-view, and therefore the mapping speed, by an order of magnitude\ncompared to the upcoming generation of large-aperture instruments. Polarization\nsystematics and engineering considerations are presented, including a\npreliminary receiver model to demonstrate that these designs will enable high\nefficiency illumination of $>10^5$ detectors in a next generation CMB\ntelescope.\n", "  The notion of a Killing tensor is generalised to a superspace setting.\nConserved quantities associated with these are defined for superparticles and\nPoisson brackets are used to define a supersymmetric version of the\nSchouten-Nijenhuis bracket. Superconformal Killing tensors in flat superspaces\nare studied for spacetime dimensions 3,4,5,6 and 10. These tensors are also\npresented in analytic superspaces and super-twistor spaces for 3,4 and 6\ndimensions. Algebraic structures associated with superconformal Killing tensors\nare also briefly discussed\n", "  The vast majority of mesons can be understood as quark-antiquark states. Yet,\nvarious other possibilities exists: glueballs (bound-state of gluons), hybrids\n(quark-antiquark plus gluon), and four-quark states (either as\ndiquark-antidiquark or molecular objects) are expected. In particular, the\nexistence of glueballs represents one of the first predictions of QCD, which\nrelies on the nonabelian feature of its structure; this is why the search for\nglueballs and their firm discovery would be so important, both for theoretical\nand experimental developments. At the same time, many new resonances ($X,Y,$\nand $Z$ states) were discovered experimentally, some of which can be well\nunderstood as four-quark objects. In this lecture, we review some basic aspects\nof QCD and show in a pedagogical way how to construct an effective hadronic\nmodel of QCD. We then present the results for the decays of the scalar and the\npseudoscalar glueballs within this approach and discuss the future applications\nto other glueball states. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the status of\nfour-quark states, both in the low-energy domain (light scalar mesons) as well\nas in the high-energy domain (in the charmonia region).\n", "  Using the zero-range model, it was demonstrated recently that Levinger's\nquasi-deuteron model can be utilized to extract the nuclear neutron-proton\ncontact. Going beyond the zero-range approximation and considering the full\nnuclear contact formalism, we rederive here the quasi-deuteron model for the\nnuclear photoabsorption cross-section and utilize it to establish relations and\nconstrains for the general contact matrix. We also define and demonstrate the\nimportance of the diagonalized nuclear contacts, which can be also relevant to\nfurther applications of the nuclear contacts.\n", "  The quantum Goos-H\\\"anchen shifts of the transmitted electron beam through an\nAA-stacked bilayer graphene superlattices is investigated. We found that the\nband structures of graphene superlattices can have more than one Dirac point,\ntheir locations do not depend on the number of barriers. It was revealed that\nany $n$-barrier structure is perfectly transparent at normal incidence around\nthe Dirac points created in the superlattices. We showed that the\nGoos-H\\\"anchen shifts display sharp peaks inside the transmission gap around\ntwo Dirac points ($E= V_B + \\tau$, $E= V_W + \\tau$), which are equal to those\nof transmission resonances. The obtained Goos-H\\\"anchen shifts are exhibiting\nnegative as well as positive behaviors and strongly depending on the location\nof Dirac points. It is observed that the maximum absolute values of the shifts\nincrease as long as the number of barriers is increased. Our analysis is done\nby considering four cases: single, double barriers, superlattices without and\nwith defect.\n", "  We present a new interrogation scheme for the next generation of quantum\nclocks to suppress frequency-shifts induced by laser probing fields themselves\nbased on Generalized Hyper-Ramsey resonances. Sequences of composite laser\npulses with specific selection of phases, frequency detunings and durations are\ncombined to generate a very efficient and robust frequency locking signal with\nalmost a perfect elimination of the light-shift from off resonant states and to\ndecouple the unperturbed frequency measurement from the laser's intensity. The\nfrequency lock point generated from synthesized error signals using either\n$\\pi/4$ or $3\\pi/4$ laser phase-steps during the intermediate pulse is tightly\nprotected against large laser pulse area variations and errors in potentially\napplied frequency shift compensations. Quantum clocks based on weakly allowed\nor completely forbidden optical transitions in atoms, ions, molecules and\nnuclei will benefit from these hyper-stable laser frequency stabilization\nschemes to reach relative accuracies below the 10$^{-18}$ level.\n", "  We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model\non a two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. If the\n(local) prey carrying capacity is finite, there exists an extinction threshold\nfor the predator population that separates a stable active two-species\ncoexistence phase from an inactive state wherein only prey survive. Holding all\nother rates fixed, we investigate the non-equilibrium relaxation of the\npredator density in the vicinity of the critical predation rate. As expected,\nwe observe critical slowing-down, i.e., a power law dependence of the\nrelaxation time on the predation rate, and algebraic decay of the predator\ndensity at the extinction critical point. The numerically determined critical\nexponents are in accord with the established values of the directed percolation\nuniversality class. Following a sudden predation rate change to its critical\nvalue, one finds critical aging for the predator density autocorrelation\nfunction that is also governed by universal scaling exponents. This aging\nscaling signature of the active-to-absorbing state phase transition emerges at\nsignificantly earlier times than the stationary critical power laws, and could\nthus serve as an advanced indicator of the (predator) population's proximity to\nits extinction threshold.\n", "  We suggest a method for probing global properties of clump populations in\nGiant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the case where these act as X-ray reflection\nnebulae (XRNe), based on the study of the clumping's overall effect on the\nreflected X-ray signal, in particular on the Fe K-alpha line's shoulder. We\nconsider the particular case of Sgr B2, one of the brightest and most massive\nXRN in our Galaxy. We parametrise the gas distribution inside the cloud using a\nsimple clumping model, with the slope of the clump mass function (alpha), the\nminimum clump mass (m_{min}), the fraction of the cloud's mass contained in\nclumps (f_{DGMF}), and the mass-size relation of individual clumps as free\nparameters, and investigate how these affect the reflected X-ray spectrum. In\nthe case of very dense clumps, similar to those presently observed in Sgr B2,\nthese occupy a small volume of the cloud and present a small projected area to\nthe incoming X-ray radiation. We find that these contribute negligibly to the\nscattered X-rays. Clump populations with volume filling factors of > 10^{-3},\ndo leave observational signatures, that are sensitive to the clump model\nparameters, in the reflected spectrum and polarisation. Future high-resolution\nX-ray observations could therefore complement the traditional optical and radio\nobservations of these GMCs, and prove to be a powerful probe in the study of\ntheir internal structure. Finally, clumps in GMCs should be visible both as\nbright spots and regions of heavy absorption in high resolution X-ray\nobservations. We therefore further study the time-evolution of the X-ray\nmorphology, under illumination by a transient source, as a probe of the 3d\ndistribution and column density of individual clumps by future X-ray\nobservatories.\n", "  We study the behaviour of supersymmetric ground states in a class of\none-dimensional N = 2 abelian gauged linear sigma models, including theories\nfor which the target space is a complete intersection in projective space, and\nmore generally, models with an interaction term introduced by Herbst, Hori and\nPage in which the vacua correspond to elements of hypercohomology groups of\ncomplexes of sheaves. Combining physical insights from recent work by Hori, Kim\nand Yi with the use of spectral sequences, we propose a way to reconcile the\nnon-linear sigma model description, valid deep within a geometric phase, with\nthe effective Coulomb branch description, valid near a phase boundary. This\nleads to a physical interpretation of the hypercohomology groups from the\nperspective of the Coulomb branch, as well as an interpretation for the\nspectral sequences used to compute them.\n", "  One-dimensional blood flow models take the general form of nonlinear\nhyperbolic systems but differ greatly in their formulation. One class of models\nconsiders the physically conserved quantities of mass and momentum, while\nanother class describes mass and velocity. Further, the averaging process\nemployed in the model derivation requires the specification of the axial\nvelocity profile; this choice differentiates models within each class.\nDiscrepancies among differing models have yet to be investigated. In this\npaper, we systematically compare several reduced models of blood flow for\nphysiologically relevant vessel parameters, network topology, and boundary\ndata. The models are discretized by a class of Runge-Kutta discontinuous\nGalerkin methods.\n", "  It is well known that very large magnetic fields are generated when the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma is formed during peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Lattice,\nholographic, and other studies strongly suggest that these fields may, for\nobservationally relevant field values, induce \"inverse magnetic catalysis\",\nsignalled by a lowering of the critical temperature for the\nchiral/deconfinement transition. The theoretical basis of this effect has\nrecently attracted much attention; yet so far these investigations have not\nincluded another, equally dramatic consequence of the peripheral collision\ngeometry: the QGP acquires a large angular momentum vector, parallel to the\nmagnetic field. Here we use holographic techniques to argue that the angular\nmomentum can also, independently, have an effect on transition temperatures,\nand we obtain a rough estimate of the relative effects of the presence of both\na magnetic field and an angular momentum density. We find that the shearing\nangular momentum reinforces the effect of the magnetic field at low values of\nthe baryonic chemical potential, but that it can actually decrease that effect\nat high chemical potentials.\n", "  The firm observational confirmation of the late-time acceleration of the\nuniverse expansion has proposed a major challenge to the theoretical\nfoundations of cosmology and the explanation of the acceleration mechanism\nrequires the introduction of either a simply cosmological constant, or of a\nmysterious dark energy component (time dependent or modified gravities),\nfilling the universe and dominating its current expansionary evolution.\nUniversally given that the universe is permeated by a dark energy fluid,\ntherefore, we should also investigate the astrophysical scale properties from\nthe dark energy effects. In the present paper, the exact solutions of\nspherically-symmetrical Einstein field equations describing wormholes supported\nby phantom energy that violates the null energy condition from Shan-Chen fluid\ndescription are obtained. We have considered the important case that the model\nparameter $\\psi\\approx1$ which corresponds to the `` saturation effect \", and\nthis regime corresponds to an effective form of `` asymptotic freedom \" for the\nfluids, but occurring at cosmological rather than subnuclear scales. Then we\ninvestigate the allowed range values of the model parameters $g$ and $\\omega$\nwhen the space-time metrics describe wormholes and discuss the possible\nsingularities of the solutions, finding that the obtained spacetimes are\ngeodesically complete. Moreover, we construct two traversable wormholes through\nmatching our obtained interior solutions to the exterior Schwarzschild\nsolutions and calculate out the total mass of the wormhole when the wormhole\nthroat size $r\\leq a$ or $r\\leq b$, respectively. Finally, we acquire that the\nsurface stress-energy $\\sigma$ is zero and the surface tangential pressure\n$\\wp$ is positive when discussing the surface stresses of the solutions and\nanalyze the traversable wormholes.\n", "  We present a series of results from a clustering analysis of the first data\nrelease of the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Deep\nExtragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey. VIDEO is the only survey currently\ncapable of probing the bulk of stellar mass in galaxies at redshifts\ncorresponding to the peak of star formation on degree scales. Galaxy clustering\nis measured with the two-point correlation function, which is calculated using\na non parametric kernel based density estimator. We use our measurements to\ninvestigate the connection between the galaxies and the host dark matter halo\nusing a halo occupation distribution methodology, deriving bias, satellite\nfractions, and typical host halo masses for stellar masses between\n$10^{9.35}M_{\\odot}$ and $10^{10.85}M_{\\odot}$, at redshifts $0.5<z<1.7$. Our\nresults show typical halo mass increasing with stellar mass (with moderate\nscatter) and bias increasing with stellar mass and redshift consistent with\nprevious studies. We find the satellite fraction increased towards low\nredshifts, increasing from $\\sim 5\\%$ at $z\\sim 1.5$, to $\\sim 20\\%$ at $z\\sim\n0.6$, also increasing for lower mass galaxies. We combine our results to derive\nthe stellar mass to halo mass ratio for both satellites and centrals over a\nrange of halo masses and find the peak corresponding to the halo mass with\nmaximum star formation efficiency to be $ \\sim 2 \\times10^{12} M_{\\odot}$ over\ncosmic time, finding no evidence for evolution.\n", "  We construct the gravity dual of three-dimensional, $SU(N_{\\textrm{c}})$\nsuper Yang-Mills theory with $N_{\\textrm{f}}$ flavors of dynamical quarks in\nthe presence of a non-zero quark density $N_{\\textrm{q}}$. The supergravity\nsolutions include the backreaction of $N_{\\textrm{c}}$ color D2-branes and\n$N_{\\textrm{f}}$ flavor D6-branes with $N_{\\textrm{q}}$ units of electric flux\non their worldvolume. For massless quarks, the solutions depend non-trivially\nonly on the dimensionless combination $\\rho=N_{\\textrm{c}}^2 N_{\\textrm{q}} /\n\\lambda^2 N_{\\textrm{f}}^4$, with $\\lambda=g_{\\textrm{YM}}^2 N_{\\textrm{c}}$\nthe 't Hooft coupling, and describe renormalization group flows between the\nsuper Yang-Mills theory in the ultraviolet and a non-relativistic theory in the\ninfrared. The latter is dual to a hyperscaling-violating, Lifshitz-like\ngeometry with dynamical and hyperscaling-violating exponents $z=5$ and\n$\\theta=1$, respectively. If $\\rho \\ll 1$ then at intermediate energies there\nis also an approximate AdS$_4$ region, dual to a conformal Chern-Simons-Matter\ntheory, in which the flow exhibits quasi-conformal dynamics. At zero\ntemperature we compute the chemical potential and the equation of state and\nextract the speed of sound. At low temperature we compute the entropy density\nand extract the number of low-energy degrees of freedom. For quarks of non-zero\nmass $M_{\\textrm{q}}$ the physics depends non-trivially on $\\rho$ and\n$M_{\\textrm{q}} N_{\\textrm{c}}/\\lambda N_{\\textrm{f}}$.\n", "  High-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction was utilized to study the\nmechanical response of the f.c.c $\\delta$-hydride phase, the intermetallic\nprecipitation with hexagonal C14 lave phase and the $\\alpha$-Zr phase in the\nZircaloy-4 materials with a hydride rim/blister structure near one surface of\nthe material during in-situ uniaxial tension experiment at 200\n\\si{\\degreeCelsius}. The f.c.c $\\delta$ was the only hydride phase observed in\nthe rim/blister structure. The conventional Rietveld refinement was applied to\nmeasure the macro-strain equivalent response of the three phases. Two regions\nwere delineated in the applied load versus lattice strain measurement: a linear\nelastic strain region and region that exhibited load partitioning. Load\npartitioning was quantified by von Mises analysis. The three phases were\nobserved to have similar elastic modulus at 200 \\si{\\degreeCelsius}.\n", "  We consider, computationally and experimentally, the scaling properties of\nforce networks in the systems of circular particles exposed to compression in\ntwo spatial dimensions. The simulations consider polydisperse and monodisperse\nparticles, both frictional and frictionless, and in experiments we use\nmonodisperse and bidisperse particles. While for some of the considered systems\nwe observe consistent scaling exponents describing the behavior of the force\nnetworks, we find that this behavior is it not universal. In particular,\nmonodisperse frictionless systems that partially crystallize under compression,\nshow scaling properties that are significantly different compared to the other\nconsidered systems. The findings of non-universality are confirmed by\nexplicitly computing fractal dimension for the considered systems. The results\nof physical experiments are consistent with the results obtained in simulations\nof frictional particles.\n", "  Sound propagation in a waveguide lined with one section of locally reactive\nmaterial is studied by resonance scattering approach. The objective is to\nunderstand the effects of mode coupling in the lined section on the\ntransmission. It is shown that a transmission zero is present in the vicinity\nof a resonance peak when a numerically real resonance frequency of the open\nlined section (opened to infinities through the rigid parts of the waveguide)\nis crossed. The transmission zero and immediate resonance peak form a Fano\nresonance, it has been explained as an interaction between a resonance and the\nnon-resonant background. The real resonance frequency and its corresponding\ntrapped mode are formed by the interferences (couplings) between two neighbor\nmodes with complex resonance frequencies. It is also linked to the avoided\ncrossing of eigenvalues and the exceptional point. The scattering matrix is\nexpressed in terms of a matrix $\\mathsf{H_{eff}}$ which describes approximately\nthe complex resonances in the open lined section. With the aid of the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of matrix $\\mathsf{H_{eff}}$, the traditional\nacoustic resonance scattering formula can be extended to describe the coupling\neffects between the open lined section and the rigid parts of the waveguide.\n", "  This paper describes the construction of a cryostat and an optical system\nwith a free-space coupling efficiency of 56.5% +/- 3.4% to a superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) for infrared quantum communication and\nspectrum analysis. A 1K pot decreases the base temperature to T = 1.7 K from\nthe 2.9 K reached by the cold head cooled by a pulse-tube cryocooler. The\nminimum spot size coupled to the detector chip was 6.6 +/- 0.11 {\\mu}m starting\nfrom a fiber source at wavelength, {\\lambda} = 1.55 {\\mu}m. We demonstrated\nefficient photon counting on a detector with an 8 x 7.3 {\\mu}m^2 area. We\nmeasured a dark count rate of 95 +/- 3.35 kcps and a system detection\nefficiency of 1.64% +/- 0.13%. We explain the key steps that are required to\nfurther improve the coupling efficiency.\n", "  The existence of a Killing symmetry in a gauge theory is equivalent to the\naddition of extra Hamiltonian constraints in its phase space formulation, which\nimply restrictions both on the Dirac observables (the gauge invariant physical\ndegrees of freedom) and on the gauge freedom.\n  When there is a time-like Killing vector field only pure gauge\nelectromagnetic fields survive in Maxwell theory in Minkowski space-time ,\nwhile in ADM canonical gravity in asymptotically Minkowskian space-times only\ninertial effects without gravitational waves survive.\n", "  In the paper we study the notion of trace norm geometric discord in the\nsystem of two qutrits. We compute this quantity for some class of states\nincluding qutrit Bell states, Werner states and bound entangled states.\n", "  Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) are used as coating materials for\nnumerous applications, ranging from biomedicine to tribology. Recently, it has\nbeen shown that the hydrophilicity of the carbon films can be enhanced by\nsilicon doping, which highly improves their biocompatibility and frictional\nperformances. Despite the relevance of these properties for applications, a\nmicroscopic understanding on the effects of silicon is still lacking. Here we\napply ab initio calculations to study the interaction of water molecules with\nSi-incorporated C(001) surfaces. We find that the presence of Si dopants\nconsiderably increases the energy gain for water chemisorption and decreases\nthe energy barrier for water dissociation by more than 50%. We provide a\nphysical rational for the phenomenon by analysing the electronic charge\ndisplacements occuring upon adsorption. We also show that once hydroxylated,\nthe surface is able to bind further water molecules much strongly than the\nclean surface via hydrogen-bond networks. This two-step process is consistent\nwith and can explain the enhanced hydrophilic character observed in\ncarbon-based films doped by silicon.\n", "  We analyze the stability of the electroweak vacuum in neutrino mass models\ncontaining right handed neutrinos or fermionic isotriplets. In addition to\nconsidering absolute stability, we place limits on the Yukawa couplings of new\nfermions based on metastability and thermal stability in the early Universe.\nOur results reveal that the upper limits on the neutrino Yukawa couplings can\nchange significantly when the top quark mass is allowed to vary within the\nexperimental range of uncertainty in its determination.\n", "  The step bunching instability is studied in three models of step motion\ndefined in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The source of\ninstability in these models is step-step attraction, it is opposed by step-step\nrepulsion and the developing surface patterns reflect the balance between the\ntwo. The first model, TE2, is a generalization of the seminal model of Tersoff\net al. (1995). The second one, LW2, is obtained from the model of Liu and Weeks\n(1998) using the repulsions term to construct the attractions one with retained\npossibility to change the parameters in the two independently. The third model,\nMM2, is a minimal one constructed ad hoc and in this article it plays a central\nrole. New scheme for scaling the ODE in vicinal studies is applied towards\ndeciphering the pre-factors in the time-scaling relations. In all these models\nthe patterned surface is self-similar - only one length scale is necessary to\ndescribe its evolution (hence B1-type). The bunches form finite angles with the\nterraces. Integrating numerically the equations for step motion and changing\nsystematically the parameters we obtain the overall dependence of time-scaling\nexponent \\b{eta} on the power of step-step attractions p as \\b{eta} = 1/(3+p)\nfor MM2 and hypothesize based on restricted set of data that it is \\b{eta} =\n1/(5+p) for LW2 and TE2.\n", "  The scattering equations provide a powerful framework for the study of\nscattering amplitudes in a variety of theories. Their derivation from\nambitwistor string theory led to proposals for formulae at one loop on a torus\nfor 10 dimensional supergravity, and we recently showed how these can be\nreduced to the Riemann sphere and checked in simple cases. We also proposed\nanalogous formulae for other theories including maximal super-Yang-Mills theory\nand supergravity in other dimensions at one loop. We give further details of\nthese results and extend them in two directions. Firstly, we propose new\nformulae for the one-loop integrands of Yang-Mills theory and gravity in the\nabsence of supersymmetry. These follow from the identification of the states\nrunning in the loop as expressed in the ambitwistor-string correlator.\nSecondly, we give a systematic proof of the non-supersymmetric formulae using\nthe worldsheet factorisation properties of the nodal Riemann sphere underlying\nthe scattering equations at one loop. Our formulae have the same decomposition\nunder the recently introduced Q-cuts as one-loop integrands and hence give the\ncorrect amplitudes.\n", "  The low-frequency response of systems near a many-body localization\ntransition can be dominated by rare regions that are locally critical or \"in\nthe other phase\". It is known that, in one dimension, these rare regions can\ncause the d.c. conductivity and diffusion constant to vanish even inside the\ndelocalized thermal phase. Here, we present a general analysis of such\nGriffiths effects in the thermal phase near the many-body localization\ntransition: we consider both one-dimensional and higher-dimensional systems,\nsubject to quenched randomness, and discuss both linear response (including the\nfrequency- and wavevector-dependent conductivity) and more general dynamics. In\nall the regimes we consider, we identify observables that are dominated by\nrare-region effects. In some cases (one-dimensional systems and Floquet systems\nwith no extensive conserved quantities), essentially all long-time local\nobservables are dominated by rare-region effects; in others, generic\nobservables are instead dominated by hydrodynamic long-time tails throughout\nthe thermal phase, and one must look at specific probes, such as spin echo, to\nsee Griffiths behavior.\n", "  Energy spectra both of the conduction and valence bands of the HgTe quantum\nwells with a width close to the Dirac point were studied experimentally.\nSimultaneous analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and Hall effect\nover a wide range of electron and hole densities gives surprising result: the\ntop of the valence band is strongly split by spin-orbit interaction while the\nsplitting of the conduction band is absent, within experimental accuracy.\nAstonishingly, but such a ratio of the splitting values is observed as for\nstructures with normal spectrum so for structures with inverted one. These\nresults do not consistent with the results of kP calculations, in which the\nsmooth electric filed across the quantum well is only reckoned in. It is shown\nthat taking into account the asymmetry of the quantum well interfaces within a\ntight-binding method gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  We study computationally dynamics of quantised vortices in two-dimensional\nsuperfluid Bose-Einstein condensates confined in highly oblate power-law traps.\nWe have found that the formation of large scale Onsager vortex clusters\nprevalent in steep-walled traps is suppressed in condensates confined by\nharmonic potentials. However, the shape of the trapping potential does not\nappear to adversely affect the evaporative heating efficiency of the vortex\ngas. Instead, the suppression of Onsager vortex formation in harmonic traps can\nbe understood in terms of the energy of the vortex configurations. Furthermore,\nwe find that the vortex-antivortex pair annihilation that underpins the vortex\nevaporative heating mechanism requires the interaction of at least three\nvortices. We conclude that experimental observation of Onsager vortices should\nbe the most apparent in flat or inverted-bottom traps.\n", "  The positions of the $l=0$ $S$-matrix poles are calculated in generalized\nWoods-Saxon (GWS) potential and in cut-off generalized Woods-Saxon (CGWS)\npotential. The solutions of the radial equations are calculated numerically for\nthe CGWS potential and analytically for GWS using the formalism of Gy. Bencze\n\\cite{[Be66]}. We calculate CGWS and GWS cases at small non-zero values of the\ndiffuseness in order to approach the square well potential and to be able to\nseparate effects of the radius parameter and the cut-off radius parameter. In\nthe case of the GWS potential the wave functions are reflected at the nuclear\nradius therefore the distances of the resonant poles depend on the radius\nparameter of the potential. In CGWS potential the wave function can be\nreflected at larger distance where the potential is cut to zero and the\nderivative of the potential does not exist. The positions of most of the\nresonant poles do depend strongly on the cut-off radius of the potential, which\nis an unphysical parameter. Only the positions of the few narrow resonances in\npotentials with barrier are not sensitive to the cut-off distance. For the\nbroad resonances the effect of the cut-off can not be corrected by using a\nsuggested analytical form of the first order perturbation correction.\n", "  We construct the T-dual of the Klebanov-Strassler solution on a small region\nat the tip of the deformed conifold. The isometry coordinate we choose is the\ncorrect one to obtain an NS5 brane wrapping a holomorphic curve in Type IIA, as\nshown by a thorough analysis of the deformed conifold geometry. The shape of\nthe locus wrapped by the NS5 brane matches the predictions from the Type IIA\nbrane engineering construction dual to the $SU(N+M) \\times SU(N)$ cascading\ngauge theory. The same isometry is then used to T-dualize the solution obtained\nby adding backreacted D3 branes to the Klebanov-Strassler solution. Our\nconstruction is the first step in a program to test the stability of antibranes\nin Type IIA backgrounds.\n", "  We study soft theorems at one loop in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory\nthrough finite order in the infrared regulator and to subleading order in the\nsoft parameter {\\delta}. In particular, we derive a universal constraint from\ndual superconformal symmetry, which we use to bootstrap subleading log {\\delta}\nbehaviour. Moreover, we determine the complete infrared-finite subleading soft\ncontribution of n-point MHV amplitudes using momentum twistors. Finally, we\ncompute the subleading log {\\delta} behaviour of one-loop NMHV ratio functions\nat six and seven points, finding that universality holds within but not between\nhelicity sectors.\n", "  A laser beam propagating to a remote target through atmospheric turbulence\nacquires intensity fluctuations. If the target is cooperative and provides a\ncoherent return beam, the phase measured near the beam transmitter and adaptive\noptics can, in principle, correct these fluctuations. Generally, however, the\ntarget is uncooperative. In this case, we show that an incoherent return from\nthe target can be used instead. Using the principle of reciprocity, we derive a\nnovel relation between the field at the target and the reflected field at a\ndetector. We simulate an adaptive optics system that utilizes this relation to\nfocus a beam through atmospheric turbulence onto the incoherent surface.\n", "  We show that the electron mobility in ideal, free-standing two-dimensional\n`buckled' crystals with broken horizontal mirror ($\\sigma_{\\rm h}$) symmetry\nand Dirac-like dispersion (such as silicene and germanene) is dramatically\naffected by scattering with the acoustic flexural modes (ZA phonons). This is\ncaused both by the broken $\\sigma_{\\rm h}$ symmetry and by the diverging number\nof long-wavelength ZA phonons, consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem.\nNon-$\\sigma_{\\rm h}$-symmetric, `gapped' 2D crystals (such as semiconducting\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides with a tetragonal crystal structure) are\naffected less severely by the broken $\\sigma_{\\rm h}$ symmetry, but equally\nseriously by the large population of the acoustic flexural modes. We speculate\nthat reasonable long-wavelength cutoffs needed to stabilize the structure\n(finite sample size, grain size, wrinkles, defects) or the anharmonic coupling\nbetween flexural and in-plane acoustic modes (shown to be effective in\nmirror-symmetric crystals, like free-standing graphene) may not be sufficient\nto raise the electron mobility to satisfactory values. Additional effects (such\nas clamping and phonon-stiffening by the substrate and/or gate insulator) may\nbe required.\n", "  Hydrodynamical noise is introduced on top of Gubser's analytical solution to\nviscous hydrodynamics. With respect to the ultra-central collision events of\nPb-Pb, p-Pb and p-p at the LHC energies, we solve the evolution of noisy fluid\nsystems and calculate the radial flow velocity correlations. We show that the\nabsolute amplitude of the hydrodynamical noise is determined by the\nmultiplicity of the collision event. The evolution of azimuthal anisotropies,\nwhich is related to the generation of harmonic flow, receives finite\nenhancements from hydrodynamical noise. Although it is strongest in the p-p\nsystems, the effect of hydrodynamical noise on flow harmonics is found to be\nnegligible, especially in the ultra-central Pb-Pb collisions. For the\nshort-range correlations, hydrodynamical noise contributes to the formation of\na near-side peak on top of the correlation structure originated from initial\nstate fluctuations. The shape of the peak is affected by the strength of\nhydrodynamical noise, whose height and width grow from the Pb-Pb system to the\np-Pb and p-p systems.\n", "  Applications of the extended critical state model are considered. The trapped\nmagnetic field, the penetration field and the field dependence of the critical\ncurrent density are analysed. The critical current density and the trapped\nfield in superconducting grains depend on the grain size. Asymmetry of the\nhysteresis curves relative to the M = 0 axis is related to the scale of the\ncurrent circulation.\n", "  Graphene outstanding properties created a huge interest in the condensed\nmatter community and unprecedented fundings at the international scale in the\nhope of application developments. Recently, there have been several reports of\nincomplete removal of the polymer resists used to transfer as-grown graphene\nfrom one substrate to another, resulting in altered graphene transport\nproperties. Finding a large-scale solution to clean graphene from adsorbed\nresidues is highly desirable and one promising possibility would be to use\nhydrogen plasmas. In this spirit, we couple here quantum and classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations to explore the kinetic energy ranges required by\natomic hydrogen to selectively etch a simple residue, a CH3 group, without\nirreversibly damaging the graphene. For incident energies in the 2-15 eV range,\nthe CH3 radical can be etched by forming a volatile CH4 compound which leaves\nthe surface, either in the CH4 form or breaking into CH3+H fragments, without\nfurther defect formation. At this energy, adsorption of H atoms on graphene is\npossible and further annealing will be required to recover pristine graphene.\n", "  We study the partition function of two versions of the continuum directed\npolymer in 1+1 dimension. In the full-space version, the polymer starts at the\norigin and is free to move transversally in the reals, and in the half-space\nversion, the polymer starts at the origin but is reflected at the origin and\nstays in the negative reals. The partition functions solves the stochastic heat\nequation in full-space or half-space with mixed boundary condition at the\norigin; or equivalently the free energy satisfies the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nequation.\n  We derive exact formulas for the Laplace transforms of the partition\nfunctions. In the full-space this is expressed as a Fredholm determinant while\nin the half-space this is expressed as a Fredholm Pfaffian. Taking long-time\nasymptotics we show that the limiting free energy fluctuations scale with\nexponent 1/3 and are given by the GUE and GSE Tracy-Widom distributions. These\nformulas come from summing divergent moment generating functions, hence are not\nmathematically justified.\n  The primary purpose of this work is to present a mathematical perspective on\nthe polymer replica method which is used to derive these results. In contrast\nto other replica method work, we do not appeal directly to the Bethe ansatz for\nthe Lieb-Liniger model but rather utilize nested contour integral formulas for\nmoments as well as their residue expansions.\n", "  We develop the phenomenology of scenarios in which a dark matter candidate\ninteracts with a top quark through flavour-changing couplings, employing a\nsimplified dark matter model with an s-channel vector-like mediator. We study\nin detail the top-charm flavour-changing interaction, by investigating the\nsingle top plus large missing energy signature at the LHC as well as\nconstraints from the relic density and direct and indirect dark matter\ndetection experiments. We present strategies to distinguish between the\ntop-charm and top-up flavour-changing models by taking advantage of the lepton\ncharge asymmetry as well as by using charm-tagging techniques on an extra jet.\nWe also show the complementarity between the LHC and canonical dark matter\nexperiments in exploring the viable parameter space of the models.\n", "  We study non oscillating bifurcations of non homogeneous steady states of the\nVlasov equation, a situation occurring in galactic models, or for\nBernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes in plasma physics. We show that resonances are\nstrongly suppressed, leading to very different phenomena with respect to the\nhomogeneous case. Through an unstable manifold expansion, we show that the\ndynamics is very sensitive to the initial perturbation: the instability may\nsaturate at small amplitude -generalizing the \"trapping scaling\" of plasma\nphysics- or may grow to produce a large scale modification of the system. These\nanalytical findings are illustrated and extended by direct numerical\nsimulations with a cosine interaction potential.\n", "  The presence of non-axisymmetric perturbations in an axisymmetric magnetic\nfield equilibrium renders the Guiding Center (GC) particle motion\nnon-integrable and may result in particle, energy and momentum redistribution,\ndue to resonance mechanisms. We analyse these perturbations in terms of their\nspectrum, as observed by the particles in the frame of unperturbed GC motion.\nWe calculate semi-analytically the exact locations and strength of resonant\nspectral components of multiple perturbations. The presented Orbital Spectrum\nAnalysis (OSA) method is based on an exact Action-Angle transform that fully\ntakes into account Finite Orbit Width (FOW) effects. The method provides\ninsight into the particle dynamics and enables the prediction of the effect of\nany perturbation to all different types of particles and orbits in a given,\nanalytically or numerically calculated, axisymmetric equilibrium.\n", "  The electronic structure and magnetic properties of a single Fe adatom on a\nCuN surface have been studied using density functional theory in the local spin\ndensity approximation (LSDA), the LSDA+U approach and the local density\napproximation plus dynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT). The impurity problem\nin LDA+DMFT is solved through exact diagonalization and in the Hubbard-I\napproximation. The comparison of the one-particle spectral functions obtained\nfrom LSDA, LSDA+U and LDA+DMFT show the importance of dynamical correlations\nfor the electronic structure of this system. Most importantly, we focused on\nthe magnetic anisotropy and found that neither LSDA, nor LSDA+U can explain the\nmeasured, high values of the axial and transverse anisotropy parameters.\nInstead, the spin excitation energies obtained from our LDA+DMFT approach with\nexact diagonalization agree significantly better with experimental data. This\naffirms the importance of treating fluctuating magnetic moments through a\nrealistic many-body treatment when describing this class of nano-magnetic\nsystems. Moreover, it facilitates insight to the role of the hybridization with\nsurrounding orbitals.\n", "  Recent experimental work on Mn2RuxGa demonstrates its potential as a\ncompensated ferrimagnetic half-metal (CFHM).Here we present a set of\nhigh-throughput ab initio density functional theory calculations and detailed\nexperimental characterisation, that enable us to correctly describe the nominal\nMn2RuxGa thin films, in particular with regard to site-disorder and defects. We\nthen construct models that accurately capture all the key features of the\nMn-Ru-Ga system, including magnetic compensation and the spin gap at the Fermi\nlevel. We find that electronic doping is neccessary, which is achieved with a\nMn/Ga ratio smaller than two. Our study shows how composition and\nsubstrate-induced biaxial strain can be combined to design the first\nroom-temperature CFHM.\n", "  The discovery of graphene has ignited intensive investigation on two\ndimensional (2D) materials. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC),\na typical representative, attracts much attention due to the excellent\nperformance in field effect transistor (FET) related measurements and\napplications. Particularly, when TMDC eventually reaches few-layer dimension, a\nwide range of electronic and optical properties, in striking contrast to bulk\nsamples, are detected. In this Letter, we synthesized single crystalline WS2\nnanoflakes by physical vapor deposition (PVD) method and carried out a series\nof transport measurements of contact resistance and magnetoresistance. Focused\nion beam (FIB) technology was applied to deposit Pt electrodes on WS2 flakes.\nDifferent from the electron beam lithography (EBL) fabricated electrodes,\nFIB-deposited leads exhibited ohmic contact, resolving the dilemma of Schottky\nbarrier. Furthermore, a temperature-modulated negative-to-positive transition\nof magnetoresistance (MR) associated with a crossover of carrier type at\nsimilar temperature was demonstrated. Our work offers a pathway to optimize the\ncontact for TMDC and reveals the magnetoresistance characteristics of WS2\nflakes, which may stimulate further studies on TMDC and corresponding potential\nelectronic and optoelectronic applications.\n", "  Herein is presented an optical diffraction tomography (ODT) technique for\nmeasuring 3-D refractive index (RI) maps of optical plastic lenses. A\nMach-Zehnder interferometer was used to measure multiple complex optical fields\nof a plastic lens immersed in RI matching oil, at various rotational\norientations. From this, ODT was used to reconstruct a 3-D RI distribution of\nthe plastic lens with unprecedented RI sensitivity (dn = 4.21 x 10^-5) and high\nresolution (12.8 um). As a demonstration, 3-D RI distributions of a\n2-mm-diameter borosilicate sphere and a 5-mm-diameter plastic lens\n", "  We show that the form of the renormalization group invariant quark-gluon\ninteraction predicted by a refined nonperturbative analysis of the QCD gauge\nsector is in quantitative agreement with the one required for describing a wide\nrange of hadron observables using sophisticated truncation schemes of the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations relevant in the matter sector.\n", "  We study the possibility that particle production during inflation can source\nthe required power spectrum for dark matter (DM) primordial black holes (PBH)\nformation. We consider the scalar and the gauge quanta production in inflation\nmodels, where in the latter case, we focus in two sectors: inflaton coupled i)\ndirectly and ii) gravitationally to a $U(1)$ gauge field. We do not assume any\nspecific potential for the inflaton field. Hence, in the gauge production case,\nin a model independent way we show that the non-production of DM PBHs puts\nstronger upper bound on the particle production parameter. Our analysis show\nthat this bound is more stringent than the bounds from the bispectrum and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio derived by gauge production in these models. In the\nscenario where the inflaton field coupled to a scalar field, we put an upper\nbound on the amplitude of the generated scalar power spectrum by non-production\nof PBHs. As a by-product we also show that the required scalar power spectrum\nfor PBHs formation is lower when the density perturbations are non-Gaussian in\ncomparison to the Gaussian density perturbations.\n", "  Motivated by recent spin- and angular-resolved photoemission (SARPES)\nmeasurements performed on the two-dimensional electronic states confined near\nthe (001) surface of SrTiO$_3$ in the presence of oxygen vacancies, we explore\ntheir spin structure by means of ab initio density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations of slabs. Relativistic nonmagnetic DFT calculations display\nRashba-like spin winding with a splitting of a few meV and when surface\nmagnetism on the Ti ions is in- cluded, bands become spin-split with an energy\ndifference ~100 meV at the $\\Gamma$ point, consistent with SARPES findings.\nWhile magnetism tends to suppress the effects of the relativistic Rashba\ninteraction, signatures of it are still clearly visible in terms of complex\nspin textures. Furthermore, we observe an atomic specialization phenomenon,\nnamely, two types of electronic contributions: one is from Ti atoms neighboring\nthe oxygen vacancies that acquire rather large magnetic moments and mostly\ncreate in-gap states; another comes from the partly polarized t$_{2g}$\nitinerant electrons of Ti atoms lying further away from the oxygen vacancy,\nwhich form the two-dimensional electron system and are responsible for the\nRashba spin winding and the spin splitting at the Fermi surface.\n", "  In gravitational theories involving higher curvature corrections the metric\ndescribes additional degrees of freedom beyond the graviton. Holographic\nduality maps these to operators in the dual CFT. We identify infinite families\nof theories for which these new modes cannot be truncated and the usual\nFefferman-Graham expansion needs to be modified. New massive gravity in three\ndimensions and critical gravity in four dimensions are particular\nrepresentatives of these families. We propose modified expansion, study the\nnear-boundary behaviour of the metric and derive fall-off properties of the\nadditional modes in theories involving higher derivative corrections.\n", "  We construct concrete counterterms of the Balasubramanian-Kraus type for\nEinstein-scalar theories with designer gravity boundary conditions in\nAdS$_{4}$, so that the total action is finite on-shell and satisfy a well\ndefined variational principle for an arbitrary scalar field potential. We focus\non scalar fields with the conformal mass, $m^{2}=-2l^{-2}$, and show that the\nholographic mass matches the Hamiltonian mass for any boundary conditions. We\ncompute the trace anomaly of the dual field theory in the generic case, as well\nas when there exist logarithmic branches of non-linear origin. As expected, the\nanomaly vanishes for the boundary conditions that are AdS invariant. When the\nanomaly does not vanish, the dual stress tensor describes a thermal gas with an\nequation of state related to the boundary conditions of the scalar field. When\nthe anomaly vanishes, we recover the dual theory of a massless thermal gas. As\nan application of the formalism, we consider a general family of exact hairy\nblack hole solutions that, for some particular values of the parameters in the\nmoduli potential, contains solutions of four-dimensional gauged $\\mathcal{N}=8$\nsupergravity and its $\\omega$-deformation. Using the AdS/CFT duality\ndictionary, they correspond to triple trace deformations of the dual field\ntheory.\n", "  We develop new scenarios of large field inflation in type IIA string\ncompactifications in which the key ingredient is a D6-brane that creates a\npotential for a B-field axion. The potential has the multi-branched structure\ntypical of F-term axion monodromy models and, near its supersymmetric minima,\nit is described by a 4d supergravity model of chaotic inflation with a\nstabiliser field. The same statement applies to the D6-brane Wilson line, which\ncan also be considered as an inflaton candidate. We analyse both cases in the\ncontext of type IIA moduli stabilisation, finding an effective potential for\nthe inflaton system and a simple mechanism to lower the inflaton mass with\nrespect to closed string moduli stabilised by fluxes. Finally, we compute the\nB-field potential for trans-Planckian field values by means of the DBI action.\nThe effect of Planck suppressed corrections is a flattened potential which, in\nterms of the compactification parameters, interpolates between linear and\nquadratic inflation. This renders the cosmological parameters of these models\ncompatible with current experimental bounds, with the tensor-to-scalar ratio\nranging as 0.08 < r < 0.12\n", "  The cold emission of particles from surfaces under intense electric fields is\na process which underpins a variety of applications including atom probe\ntomography (APT), an analytical microscopy technique with near-atomic spatial\nresolution. Increasingly relying on fast laser pulsing to trigger the emission,\nAPT experiments often incorporate the detection of molecular ions emitted from\nthe specimen, in particular from covalently or ionically bonded materials.\nNotably, it has been proposed that neutral molecules can also be emitted during\nthis process. However, this remains a contentious issue. To investigate the\nvalidity of this hypothesis, a careful review of the literature is combined\nwith the development of new methods to treat experimental APT data, the\nmodelling of ion trajectories, and the application of density-functional theory\n(DFT) simulations to derive molecular ion energetics. It is shown that the\ndirect thermal emission of neutral molecules is extremely unlikely. However,\nneutrals can still be formed in the course of an APT experiment by dissociation\nof metastable molecular ions.\n", "  Nowadays, there is considerable interest in metamaterials which realize the\nelectromagnetically induced transparency in a classical system. We consider the\nfrequency shifts of particle moving in metamaterials exhibiting\nelectromagnetically induced transparency effect. The dramatic change of the\nmaterial dispersion due to the EIT influences the conditions for signal\npropagation in the medium and has a significant impact on the Doppler effect,\npossibly leading to the optical control over this phenomenon. The dependence of\nthe Doppler shift to the source frequency and velocity and radiation spectra on\nexternal parameters is examined. It was found that for source frequencies\nfitting transparency window for particular range of source velocities cutoffs\nappear, i.e. the radiation is not emitted. Our theoretical findings are proved\nanalytically and confirmed by numerical simulations based on finite-difference\ntime-domain method.\n", "  We study the fluid mechanics of removing a passive tracer contained in small,\nviscous drops attached to a flat inclined substrate using thin gravity-driven\nfilm flows. A convective mass transfer establishes across the drop-film\ninterface and the tracer in the drop diffuses into the film flow. The Peclet\nnumber for the tracer in the film is large. The Peclet number Pe_d in the drop\nvaries from 0.01 to 1. The characteristic transport time in the drop is much\nlarger than in the film. We model the mass transfer of the tracer from the drop\nbulk into the film using an empirical model based on Newton's law of cooling.\nThis model is supported by a theoretical model solving the quasi-steady 2D\nadvection-diffusion equation in the film coupled with a time-dependent 1D\ndiffusion equation in the drop. We find excellent agreement between our\nexperimental data and the 2 models, which predict an exponential decrease in\ntime of the tracer concentration in the drop. The results are valid for all\ndrop and film Peclet numbers studied. The transport characteristic time is\nrelated to the drop diffusion time scale, as diffusion within the drop is the\nlimiting process. Our theoretical model predicts the well-known relationship\nbetween the Sherwood and Reynolds numbers in the case of a well-mixed drop\nSh~Re_L^{1/3}=\\gamma L^2/\\nu_f, based on the drop length L, film shear rate\n\\gamma and film kinematic viscosity \\nu_f. We show that this relationship is\nmathematically equivalent to a more physically intuitive relationship\nSh~Re_\\delta, based on the diffusive boundary layer thickness \\delta. The model\nalso predicts a correction in the case of a non-uniform drop concentration,\nwhich depends on Re_\\delta, the Schmidt number, the drop aspect ratio and the\ndiffusivity ratio. This prediction is in agreement with experiments at low\nPe_d. It also agrees as Pe_d approaches 1, although the influence of Re_\\delta\nincreases.\n", "  The distribution of word probabilities in the monkey model of Zipf's law is\nassociated with two universality properties: (1) the power law exponent\nconverges strongly to $-1$ as the alphabet size increases and the letter\nprobabilities are specified as the spacings from a random division of the unit\ninterval for any distribution with a bounded density function on $[0,1]$; and\n(2), on a logarithmic scale the version of the model with a finite word length\ncutoff and unequal letter probabilities is approximately normally distributed\nin the part of the distribution away from the tails. The first property is\nproved using a remarkably general limit theorem for the logarithm of sample\nspacings from Shao and Hahn, and the second property follows from Anscombe's\ncentral limit theorem for a random number of i.i.d. random variables. The\nfinite word length model leads to a hybrid Zipf-lognormal mixture distribution\nclosely related to work in other areas.\n", "  We study the topological properties of 3D Floquet bandstructures, which are\ndefined using unitary evolution matrices rather than Hamiltonians. Previously,\n2D bandstructures of this sort have been shown to exhibit anomalous topological\nbehaviors, such as topologically-nontrivial zero-Chern-number phases. We show\nthat the bandstructure of a 3D network model can exhibit Weyl phases, which\nfeature \"Fermi arc\" surface states like those found in Weyl semimetals. Tuning\nthe network's coupling parameters can induce transitions between Weyl phases\nand various topologically distinct gapped phases. We identify a connection\nbetween the topology of the gapped phases and the topology of Weyl point\ntrajectories in k-space. The model is feasible to realize in custom\nelectromagnetic networks, where the Weyl point trajectories can be probed by\nscattering parameter measurements.\n", "  We argue that the Maldacena-Nunez no-go theorem excluding Minkowski and de\nSitter vacua in flux compactifications can be extended to exclude anti-de\nSitter (AdS) vacua for which the Kaluza-Klein scale is parametrically smaller\nthan the AdS length scale. As a practical application of this observation we\ndemonstrate that the mechanism to resolve O6 singularities in massive type IIA\nat the classical level is likely not to occur in AdS compactifications with\nscale separation. We furthermore remark that a compactification to four\nobservable dimensions implies a large cosmological hierarchy.\n", "  We present the Dark-ages Reionization and Galaxy-formation Observables from\nNumerical Simulations (DRAGONS) program and Tiamat, the collisionless N-body\nsimulation program upon which DRAGONS is built. The primary trait\ndistinguishing Tiamat from other large simulation programs is its density of\noutputs at high redshift (100 from z=35 to z=5; roughly one every 10 Myr)\nenabling the construction of very accurate merger trees at an epoch when galaxy\nformation is rapid and mergers extremely frequent. We find that the\nfriends-of-friends halo mass function agrees well with the prediction of Watson\net al. at high masses, but deviates at low masses, perhaps due to our use of a\ndifferent halo finder or perhaps indicating a break from \"universal\" behaviour.\nWe then analyse the dynamical evolution of galaxies during the Epoch of\nReionization finding that only a small fraction (~20%) of galactic halos are\nrelaxed. We illustrate this using standard relaxation metrics to establish two\ndynamical recovery time-scales: i) halos need ~1.5 dynamical times following\nformation, and ii) ~2 dynamical times following a major (3:1) or minor (10:1)\nmerger to be relaxed. This is remarkably consistent across a wide mass range.\nLastly, we use a phase-space halo finder to illustrate that major mergers drive\nlong-lived massive phase-space structures which take many dynamical times to\ndissipate. This can yield significant differences in the inferred mass build-up\nof galactic halos and we suggest that care must be taken to ensure a physically\nmeaningful match between the galaxy-formation physics of semi-analytic models\nand the halo finders supplying their input.\n", "  We use high resolution N-Body simulations to study the concentration and spin\nparameters of dark matter haloes in the mass range $10^8\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,\nh^{-1} < {\\rm M} < 10^{11}\\, {\\rm\n  M}_{\\odot}\\, h^{-1}$ and redshifts $5{<}z{<}10$, corresponding to the haloes\nof galaxies thought to be responsible for reionization. We build a sub-sample\nof equilibrium haloes and contrast their properties to the full population that\nalso includes unrelaxed systems. Concentrations are calculated by fitting both\nNFW and Einasto profiles to the spherically-averaged density profiles of\nindividual haloes. After removing haloes that are out-of-equilibrium, we find a\n$z{>}5$ concentration$-$mass ($c(M)$) relation that is almost flat and well\ndescribed by a simple power-law for both NFW and Einasto fits. The intrinsic\nscatter around the mean relation is $\\Delta c_{\\rm{vir}}{\\sim1}$ (or 20 per\ncent) at $z=5$. We also find that the analytic model proposed by Ludlow et al.\nreproduces the mass and redshift-dependence of halo concentrations. Our\nbest-fit Einasto shape parameter, $\\alpha$, depends on peak height, $\\nu$, in a\nmanner that is accurately described by $\\alpha {=}0.0070\\nu^2{+}0.1839$. The\ndistribution of the spin parameter, $\\lambda$, has a weak dependence on\nequilibrium state; $\\lambda$ peaks at roughly ${\\sim}0.033$ for our relaxed\nsample, and at ${\\sim}0.04$ for the full population. The spin--virial mass\nrelation has a mild negative correlation at high redshift.\n", "  The classical game of rock-paper-scissors have inspired experiments and\nspatial model systems that address robustness of biological diversity. In\nparticular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple\nstrategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a\none-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies\nexhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the\ntwo-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time\ncoexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the\ncyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare\ninvasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the\ncomplexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from\ncomplete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays\nfinite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether\nthe update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly\nin sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by\nlocalized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In\nthe case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase\ntransition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the\nthree-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We\nidentify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density\nof active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the\ndirected percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical\nsimulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may\nexhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.\n", "  We present a complete classification of the vacuum geometries of all\nrenormalizable superpotentials built from the fields of the electroweak sector\nof the MSSM. In addition to the Severi and affine Calabi-Yau varieties\npreviously found, new vacuum manifolds are identified; we thereby investigate\nthe geometrical implication of theories which display a manifest matter parity\n(or R-parity) via the distinction between leptonic and Higgs doublets, and of\nthe lepton number assignment of the right-handed neutrino fields. We find that\nthe traditional R-parity assignments of the MSSM more readily accommodate the\nneutrino see-saw mechanism with non-trivial geometry than those superpotentials\nthat violate R-parity. However there appears to be no geometrical preference\nfor a fundamental Higgs bilinear in the superpotential, with operators that\nviolate lepton number, such as \\nu H\\bar{H}, generating vacuum moduli spaces\nequivalent to those with a fundamental bilinear.\n", "  We present an efficient way to calculate the effect of soft QCD radiation at\none loop, which is needed for predictions at next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy. We use rapidity coordinates and isolate the divergences\nin the integrand. By performing manipulations with cumulative variables, we\navoid complications from plus distributions. We address rapidity divergences,\ndivergences with an azimuthal dependence, complicated jet boundaries and\nmulti-differential measurements. The process and measurements can be easily\nadjusted, as we demonstrate by reproducing many existing soft functions. The\nresults for a general LHC process with multiple Wilson lines are obtained by\ntreating Wilson lines that are not back-to-back using a boost. We also obtain,\nfor the first time, the N-jettiness soft function for generic jet angularities,\nand the collinear-soft function for the measurement of two angularities.\n", "  Chiral superconductivity is a striking quantum phenomenon in which an\nunconventional superconductor spontaneously develops an angular momentum and\nlowers its free energy by eliminating nodes in the gap. It is a topologically\nnon-trivial state and, as such, exhibits distinctive topological modes at\nsurfaces and defects. In this paper we discuss the current theory and\nexperimental results on chiral superconductors, focusing on two of the\nbest-studied systems, Sr2RuO4, which is thought to be a chiral triplet p-wave\nsuperconductor, and UPt3, which has two low-temperature superconducting phases\n(in zero magnetic field), the lower of which is believed to be chiral triplet\nf-wave. Other systems that may exhibit chiral superconductivity are also\ndiscussed. Key signatures of chiral superconductivity are surface currents and\nchiral Majorana modes, Majorana states in vortex cores, and the possibility of\nhalf-flux quantum vortices in the case of triplet pairing. Experimental\nevidence for chiral superconductivity from muSR, NMR, strain, polar Kerr effect\nand Josephson tunneling experiments are discussed.\n", "  We use methods from topological data analysis to study the topological\nfeatures of certain distributions of string vacua. Topological data analysis is\na multi-scale approach used to analyze the topological features of a dataset by\nidentifying which homological characteristics persist over a long range of\nscales. We apply these techniques in several contexts. We analyze N=2 vacua by\nfocusing on certain distributions of Calabi-Yau varieties and Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels. We then turn to flux compactifications and discuss how we can use\ntopological data analysis to extract physical informations. Finally we apply\nthese techniques to certain phenomenologically realistic heterotic models. We\ndiscuss the possibility of characterizing string vacua using the topological\nproperties of their distributions.\n", "  We present a systematic tool of derivation of the Bogomolny equation for the\nBPS Skyrme model. Furthermore, we find a generalization of the Bogomolny\nequation to the case corresponding with a non-zero value of the external\npressure. The method is based on the concept of strong necessary conditions and\ncan be applied to any Skyrme like theory.\n", "  We present a feasibility study for a high frame rate, short baseline auroral\ntomographic imaging system useful for estimating parametric variations in the\nprecipitating electron number flux spectrum of dynamic auroral events. Of\nparticular interest are auroral substorms, characterized by spatial variations\nof order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought\nto be produced by dispersive Alfv\\'en waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere.\nThe auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the\nauroral volume emission rate to estimate the characteristic energy and location\nin the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron\nprecipitation flux using a distributed network of precisely synchronized\nground-based cameras. As the observing baseline decreases, the tomographic\ninverse problem becomes highly ill-conditioned; as the sampling rate increases,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio degrades and synchronization requirements become\nincreasingly critical. Our approach to these challenges uses a physics-based\nauroral model to regularize the poorly-observed vertical dimension.\nSpecifically, the vertical dimension is expanded in a low-dimensional basis\nconsisting of eigenprofiles computed over the range of expected energies in the\nprecipitating electron flux, while the horizontal dimension retains a standard\northogonal pixel basis. Simulation results show typical characteristic energy\nestimation error less than 30% for a 3 km baseline achievable within the\nconfines of the Poker Flat Research Range, using GPS-synchronized Electron\nMultiplying CCD cameras with broad-band BG3 optical filters that pass prompt\nauroral emissions.\n", "  We measure the local anisotropy of numerically simulated strong Alfv\\'enic\nturbulence with respect to two local, physically relevant directions: along the\nlocal mean magnetic field and along the local direction of one of the\nfluctuating Elsasser fields. We find significant scaling anisotropy with\nrespect to both these directions: the fluctuations are \"ribbon-like\" ---\nstatistically, they are elongated along both the mean magnetic field and the\nfluctuating field. The latter form of anisotropy is due to scale-dependent\nalignment of the fluctuating fields. The intermittent scalings of the\n$n$th-order conditional structure functions in the direction perpendicular to\nboth the local mean field and the fluctuations agree well with the theory of\nChandran et al. 2015, while the parallel scalings are consistent with those\nimplied by the critical-balance conjecture. We quantify the relationship\nbetween the perpendicular scalings and those in the fluctuation and parallel\ndirections, and find that the scaling exponent of the perpendicular anisotropy\n(i.e., of the aspect ratio of the Alfv\\'enic structures in the plane\nperpendicular to the mean magnetic field) depends on the amplitude of the\nfluctuations. This is shown to be equivalent to the anticorrelation of\nfluctuation amplitude and alignment at each scale. The dependence of the\nanisotropy on amplitude is shown to be more significant for the anisotropy\nbetween the perpendicular and fluctuation-direction scales than it is between\nthe perpendicular and parallel scales.\n", "  Numerical calculation of modes in dispersive and absorptive systems is\nperformed using the finite element method. The dispersion is tackled in the\nframe of an extension of Maxwell's equations where auxiliary fields are added\nto the electromagnetic field. This method is applied to multi-domain cavities\nand photonic crystals including Drude and Drude-Lorentz metals. Numerical\nresults are compared to analytical solutions for simple cavities and to\nprevious results of the literature for photonic crystals, showing excellent\nagreement. The advantages of the developed method lie on the versatility of the\nfinite element method regarding geometries, and in sparing the use of tedious\ncomplex poles research algorithm. Hence the complex spectrum of resonances of\nnon-hermitian operators and dissipative systems, like two-dimensional photonic\ncrystal made of absorbing Drude metal, can be investigated in detail. The\nmethod is used to reveal unexpected features of their complex band structures.\n", "  We consider the primordial gravity wave background produced by inflation. We\ncompute the small anisotropy produced by the primordial scalar fluctuations.\n", "  We introduce open-loop quantum control protocols for characterizing the\nspectral properties of non-Gaussian noise, applicable to both classical and\nquantum dephasing environments. The basic idea is to engineer a\nmulti-dimensional frequency comb via repetition of suitably designed pulse\nsequences, through which the desired high-order noise spectra may be related to\nobservable properties of the qubit probe. We prove that access to a high time\nresolution is key to achieve spectral reconstruction over an extended\nbandwidth, overcoming limitations of existing schemes. Non-Gaussian\nspectroscopy is demonstrated for a classical noise model describing quadratic\ndephasing at an optimal point, as well as a quantum spin-boson model out of\nequilibrium. In both cases, we obtain spectral reconstructions that accurately\npredict the qubit dynamics in the non-Gaussian regime.\n", "  Complexes of cationic and neutral lipids and DNA (lipoplexes) are emerging as\npromising vectors for gene therapy applications. Their appeal stems from their\nnon pathogenic nature and the fact that they self-assemble under conditions of\nthermal equilibrium. Lipoplex adhesion to the cell plasma membrane initiates a\nthree-stage process termed transfection, consisting of (i) endocytosis, (ii)\nlipoplex breakdown, and (iii) DNA release followed by gene expression. As\nsuccessful transfection requires lipoplex degradation, it tends to be hindered\nby the lipoplex thermodynamic stability; nevertheless, it is known that the\ntransfection process may proceed spontaneously. Here, we use a simple model to\nstudy the thermodynamic driving forces governing transfection. We demonstrate\nthat after endocytosis [stage (i)], the lipoplex becomes inherently unstable.\nThis instability, which is triggered by interactions between the cationic\nlipids of the lipoplex and the anionic lipids of the enveloping plasma\nmembrane, is entropically controlled involving both remixing of the lipids and\ncounterions release. Our detailed calculation shows that the free energy gain\nduring stage (ii) is approximately linear in $\\Phi_+$, the mole fraction of\ncationic lipids in the lipoplex. This free energy gain, $\\Delta F$, reduces the\nbarrier for fusion between the enveloping and the lipoplex bilayers, which\nproduces a hole allowing for DNA release [stage (iii)]. The linear relationship\nbetween $\\Delta F$ and the fraction of cationic lipids explains the\nexperimentally observed exponential increase of transfection efficiency with\n$\\Phi_+$ in lamellar lipoplexes.\n", "  Identifying and quantifying memory are often critical steps in developing a\nmechanistic understanding of stochastic processes. These are particularly\nchallenging and necessary when exploring processes that exhibit long-range\ncorrelations. The most common signatures employed rely on second-order temporal\nstatistics and lead, for example, to identifying long memory in processes with\npower-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$.\nHowever, most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal\ncorrelations. Information measures---specifically, divergences in the mutual\ninformation between a process' past and future (excess entropy) and minimal\npredictive memory stored in a process' causal states (statistical\ncomplexity)---provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with\nhigher-order temporal correlations. However, there are no ergodic stationary\nprocesses with infinite excess entropy for which information measures have been\ncompared to autocorrelation functions and Hurst exponents. Here, we show that\nfractal renewal processes---those with interevent distribution tails $\\propto\nt^{-\\alpha}$---exhibit long memory via a phase transition at $\\alpha = 1$.\nExcess entropy diverges only there and statistical complexity diverges there\nand for all $\\alpha < 1$. When these processes do have power-law\nautocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$, they do not\nhave divergent excess entropy. This analysis breaks the intuitive association\nbetween these different quantifications of memory. We hope that the methods\nused here, based on causal states, provide some guide as to how to construct\nand analyze other long memory processes.\n", "  A novel and efficient method for fiber transfer delay measurement is\ndemonstrated. Fiber transfer delay measurement in time domain is converted into\nthe frequency measurement of the modulation signal in frequency domain,\naccompany with a coarse and easy ambiguity resolving process. This method\nachieves a sub-picosecond resolution, with an accuracy of 1 picosecond, and a\nlarge dynamic range up to 50 km as well as no measurement dead zone.\n", "  In the framework of N=2 conformal supergravity in four dimensions, we\nintroduce a nilpotent chiral superfield suitable for the description of partial\nsupersymmetry breaking in maximally supersymmetric spacetimes. As an\napplication, we construct Maxwell-Goldstone multiplet actions for partial N=2\n--> N=1 supersymmetry breaking on R x S^3, AdS_3 x S^1 (or its covering AdS_3 x\nR), and a pp-wave spacetime. In each of these cases, the action coincides with\na unique curved-superspace extension of the N=1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld\naction, which is singled out by the requirement of U(1) duality invariance.\n", "  In an article [J. Math. Phys. 53, 072701 (2012)] X. Sun and J. Duan presented\nFokker-Planck equations for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with\nnon-Gaussian L\\'evy processes. In this comment we show a serious drawback in\nthe derivation of their main result. In the proof of Theorem 1 in the\naforementioned paper, a false assumption that each infinitely differentiable\nfunction with compact support is equal to its Taylor series, is used. We prove\nthat although the derivation is incorrect, the result remains valid only if we\nadd certain additional assumptions.\n", "  It was previously proved that the G\\\"{o}del-type metrics with flat\nthree-dimensional background metric solve exactly the field equations of the\nEinstein-Aether theory in four dimensions. We generalize this result by showing\nthat the stationary G\\\"{o}del-type metrics with nonflat background in $D$\ndimensions solve exactly the field equations of the Einstein-Aether theory. The\nreduced field equations are the $(D-1)$-dimensional Euclidean Ricci-flat and\nthe $(D-1)$-dimensional source-free Maxwell equations, and the parameters of\nthe theory are left free except $c_{1}-c_{3}=1$. We give a method to produce\nexact solutions of the Einstein-Aether theory from the G\\\"{o}del-type metrics\nin $D$ dimensions. By using this method, we present explicit exact solutions to\nthe theory by considering the particular cases: ($D-1$)-dimensional Euclidean\nflat, conformally flat, and Tangherlini backgrounds.\n", "  In this paper we describe a group theoretical approach to the study of\nstructural transitions of icosahedral quasicrystals and point arrays. We apply\nthe concept of Schur rotations, originally proposed by Kramer, to the case of\naperiodic structures with icosahedral symmetry; these rotations induce a\nrotation of the physical and orthogonal spaces invariant under the icosahedral\ngroup, and hence, via the cut-and-project method, a continuous transformation\nof the corresponding model sets. We prove that this approach allows for a\ncharacterisation of such transitions in a purely group theoretical framework,\nand provide explicit computations and specific examples. Moreover, we prove\nthat this approach can be used in the case of finite point sets with\nicosahedral symmetry, which have a wide range of applications in carbon\nchemistry (fullerenes) and biology (viral capsids).\n", "  We study the dynamics and stability in a strongly interacting resonantly\ndriven two-band model. Using exact numerical simulations, we find a stable\nregime at large driving frequencies where the time evolution is governed by a\nlocal Floquet Hamiltonian that is approximately conserved out to very long\ntimes. For slow driving, on the other hand, the system becomes unstable and\nheats up to infinite temperature. While thermalization is relatively fast in\nthese two regimes (but to different \"temperatures\"), in the crossover between\nthem we find slow nonthermalizing time evolution: temporal fluctuations become\nstrong and temporal correlations long lived. Microscopically, we trace back the\norigin of this nonthermalizing time evolution to the properties of rare Floquet\nmany-body resonances, whose proliferation at lower driving frequency removes\nthe approximate energy conservation, and thus produces thermalization to\ninfinite temperature.\n", "  The effective action for low-energy excitations of Laughlin's states is\nobtained by systematic expansion in inverse powers of the magnetic field. It is\nbased on the W-infinity symmetry of quantum incompressible fluids and the\nassociated higher-spin fields. Besides reproducing the Wen and Wen-Zee actions\nand the Hall viscosity, this approach further indicates that the low-energy\nexcitations are extended objects with dipolar and multipolar moments.\n", "  In the two space dimensions of screens in optical sy stems, rotations,\ngyrations, and fractional Fourier transformations form the Fourier subgroup of\nthe symplectic group of linear canonical transformations: U(2) F $\\subset$\nSp(4,R). Here we study the action of this Fourier group on pixellated images\nwithin generic rectangular $N_x$ $\\times$ $N_y$ screens; its elements here\ncompose properly and act unitarily, i.e., without loss of information.\n", "  Entanglement, a critical resource for quantum information processing, needs\nto be witnessed in many practical scenarios. Theoretically, witnessing\nentanglement is by measuring a special Hermitian observable, called\nentanglement witness (EW), which has non-negative expected outcomes for all\nseparable states but can have negative expectations for certain entangled\nstates. In practice, an EW implementation may suffer from two problems. The\nfirst one is \\emph{reliability}. Due to unreliable realization devices, a\nseparable state could be falsely identified as an entangled one. The second\nproblem relates to \\emph{robustness}. A witness may not to optimal for a target\nstate and fail to identify its entanglement. To overcome the reliability\nproblem, we employ a recently proposed measurement-device-independent\nentanglement witness, in which the correctness of the conclusion is independent\nof the implemented measurement devices. In order to overcome the robustness\nproblem, we optimize the EW to draw a better conclusion given certain\nexperimental data. With the proposed EW scheme, where only data postprocessing\nneeds to be modified comparing to the original measurement-device-independent\nscheme, one can efficiently take advantage of the measurement results to\nmaximally draw reliable conclusions.\n", "  Polarimetric sensing by orthogonality breaking has been recently proposed as\nan alternative technique for performing direct and fast polarimetric\nmeasurements using a specific dual-frequency dual-polarization (DFDP) source.\nBased on the instantaneous Stokes-Mueller formalism to describe the\nhigh-frequency evolution of the DFDP beam intensity, we thoroughly analyze the\ninteraction of such a beam with birefringent, dichroic and depolarizing\nsamples. This allows us to confirm that orthogonality breaking is produced by\nthe sample diattenuation, whereas this technique is immune to both\nbirefringence and diagonal depolarization. We further analyze the robustness of\nthis technique when polarimetric sensing is performed through a birefringent\nwaveguide, and the optimal DFDP source configuration for fiber-based endoscopic\nmeasurements is subsequently identified. Finally, we consider a stochastic\ndepolarization model based on an ensemble of random linear diattenuators, which\nmakes it possible to understand the progressive vanishing of the detected\northogonality breaking signal as the spatial heterogeneity of the sample\nincreases, thus confirming the insensitivity of this method to diagonal\ndepolarization. The fact that the orthogonality breaking signal is exclusively\ndue to the sample dichroism is an advantageous feature for the precise\ndecoupled characterization of such an anisotropic parameter in samples showing\nseveral simultaneous effects.\n", "  The measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for baryon production\nin the target fragmentation region of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering\n(SIDIS), can produce important insight into those nonperturbative aspects of\nQCD directly associated with confinement and with the dynamical breaking of\nchiral symmetry. We discuss here, interns of spin-directed momentum transfers,\nthe powerful quantum field-theoretical constraints on the spin-orbit dynamics\nunderlying these transverse spin observables. The spin-directed momentum\nshifts, originating either in the target nucleon or in the QCD jets produced in\nthe deep inelastic scattering process, represent significant quantum\nentanglement effects connecting information from current fragmentation with\nobservables in target fragmentation.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate the design of a\nhigh-repetition rate source delivering well-separated picosecond pulses thanks\nto the nonlinear compression of a dual-frequency beat signal within a\ncavity-less normally dispersive fiber-based setup. This system is well\ndescribed by a set of two coupled NLS equations for which the usual normally\ndispersive defocusing regime is turned in a focusing temporal lens through a\ndegenerated cross-phase modulation effect. More precisely, the temporal\ncompression of the initial beating is performed by the combined effects of\nnormal GVD and XPM-induced nonlinear phase shift yield by an intense\nbeat-signal on its weak out-of-phase replica copropagating with orthogonal\npolarizations. This adiabatic reshaping process allows us to generate a 40GHz\nwell-separated 3.3ps pulse train at 1550nm in a 5km long normally dispersive\nfiber.\n", "  Gapless bilayer graphene (GBG), like monolayer graphene, is a material system\nwith unique properties, such as anti-Klein tunneling and intrinsic Fano\nresonances. These properties rely on the gapless parabolic dispersion relation\nand the chiral nature of bilayer graphene electrons. In addition, propagating\nand evanescent electron states coexist inherently in this material, giving rise\nto these exotic properties. In this sense, bilayer graphene is unique, since in\nmost material systems in which Fano resonance phenomena are manifested an\nexternal source that provides extended states is required. However, from a\nnumerical standpoint, the presence of evanescent-divergent states in the\neigenfunctions linear superposition representing the Dirac spinors, leads to a\nnumerical degradation (the so called $\\Omega$d problem) in the practical\napplications of the standard Coefficient Transfer Matrix ($K$) method used to\nstudy charge transport properties in Bilayer Graphen based multi-barrier\nsystems. We present here a straightforward procedure based in the hybrid\ncompliance-stiffness matrix method ($H$) that can overcome this numerical\ndegradation. Our results show that in contrast to standard matrix method, the\nproposed $H$ method is suitable to study the transmission and transport\nproperties of electrons in GBG superlattice since it remains numerically stable\nregardless the size of the superlattice and the range of values taken by the\ninput parameters: the energy and angle of the incident electrons, the barrier\nheight and the thickness and number of barriers. We show that the matrix\ndeterminant can be used as a test of the numerical accuracy in real\ncalculations.\n", "  The invariance of the speed of light implies a series of consequences related\nto our perception of simultaneity and of time itself. Whilst these consequences\nare experimentally well studied for subluminal speeds, the kinematics of\nsuperluminal motion lack direct evidence. Using high temporal resolution\nimaging techniques, we demonstrate that if a source approaches an observer at\nsuperluminal speeds, the temporal ordering of events is inverted and its image\nappears to propagate backwards. If the source changes its speed, crossing the\ninterface between sub- and super-luminal propagation, we observe image pair\nannihilation and creation. These results show that it is not possible to\nunambiguously determine the kinematics of an event from imaging and\ntime-resolved measurements alone.\n", "  Black hole feedback is now a standard component of galaxy formation models.\nThese models predict that the impact of black hole activity on its host galaxy\nlikely peaked at z=2-3, the epoch of strongest star formation activity and\nblack hole accretion activity in the Universe. We used XShooter on the Very\nLarge Telescope to measure rest-frame optical spectra of four z~2.5 extremely\nred quasars with infrared luminosities ~10^47 erg/sec. We present the discovery\nof very broad (full width at half max= 2600-5000 km/sec), strongly blue-shifted\n(by up to 1500 km/sec) [OIII]5007A emission lines in these objects. In a large\nsample of obscured and red quasars, [OIII] kinematics are positively correlated\nwith infrared luminosity, and the four objects in our sample are on the extreme\nend both in [OIII] kinematics and infrared luminosity. We estimate that ~3% of\nthe bolometric luminosity in these objects is being converted into the kinetic\npower of the observed wind. Photo-ionization estimates suggest that the [OIII]\nemission might be extended on a few kpc scales, which would suggest that the\nextreme outflow is affecting the entire host galaxy of the quasar. These\nsources may be the signposts of the most extreme form of quasar feedback at the\npeak epoch of galaxy formation, and may represent an active \"blow-out\" phase of\nquasar evolution.\n", "  The Twin Higgs model provides a natural theory for the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking without the need of new particles carrying the standard model gauge\ncharges below a few TeV. In the low energy theory, the only probe comes from\nthe mixing of the Higgs fields in the standard model and twin sectors. However,\nan ultraviolet completion is required below ~ 10 TeV to remove residual\nlogarithmic divergences. In non-supersymmetric completions, new exotic fermions\ncharged under both the standard model and twin gauge symmetries have to be\npresent to accompany the top quark, thus providing a high energy probe of the\nmodel. Some of them carry standard model color, and may therefore be copiously\nproduced at current or future hadron colliders. Once produced, these exotic\nquarks can decay into a top together with twin sector particles. If the twin\nsector particles escape the detection, we have the irreducible stop-like\nsignals. On the other hand, some twin sector particles may decay back into the\nstandard model particles with long lifetimes, giving spectacular displaced\nvertex signals in combination with the prompt top quarks. This happens in the\nFraternal Twin Higgs scenario with typical parameters, and sometimes is even\nnecessary for cosmological reasons. We study the potential displaced vertex\nsignals from the decays of the twin bottomonia, twin glueballs, and twin\nleptons in the Fraternal Twin Higgs scenario. Depending on the details of the\ntwin sector, the exotic quarks may be probed up to ~ 2.5 TeV at the LHC and\nbeyond 10 TeV at a future 100 TeV collider, providing a strong test of this\nclass of ultraviolet completions.\n", "  Coupling a many-body-localized system to a dissipative bath necessarily leads\nto delocalization. Here, we investigate the nature of the ensuing relaxation\ndynamics and the information it holds on the many-body-localized state. We\nformulate the relevant Lindblad equation in terms of the local integrals of\nmotion of the underlying localized Hamiltonian. This allows to map the quantum\nevolution deep in the localized state to tractable classical rate equations. We\nconsider two different types of dissipation relevant to systems of ultra-cold\natoms: dephasing due to inelastic scattering on the lattice lasers and particle\nloss. Only the latter mechanism shows a pronounced effects of interactions on\nthe relaxation of observables.\n", "  We report on a theoretical investigation of the interplay between vacuum\nfluctuations, Majorana quasiparticles (MQPs) and bound states in the continuum\n(BICs) by proposing a new venue for qubit storage.BICs emerge due to quantum\ninterference processes as the Fano effect and, since such a mechanism is\nunbalanced, these states decay as regular into the continuum. Such fingerprints\nidentify BICs in graphene as we have discussed in detail in Phys. Rev. B 92,\n245107 and 045409 (2015). Here by considering two semi-infinite Kitaev chains\nwithin the topological phase, coupled to a quantum dot (QD) hybridized with\nleads, we show the emergence of a novel type of BICs, in which MQPs are\ntrapped. As the MQPs of these chains far apart build a delocalized fermion and\nqubit, we identify that the decay of these BICs is not connected to Fano and it\noccurs when finite fluctuations are observed in the vacuum composed by electron\npairs for this qubit. From the experimental point of view, we also show that\nvacuum fluctuations can be induced just by changing the chain-dot couplings\nfrom symmetric to asymmetric. Hence, we show how to perform the qubit storage\nwithin two delocalized BICs of MQPs and to access it when the vacuum fluctuates\nby means of a complete controllable way in quantum transport experiments.\n", "  Optical nanofibres are increasingly being used in cold atom experiments due\nto their versatility and the clear advantages they have when developing\nall-fibred systems for quantum technologies. They provide researchers with a\nmethod of overcoming the Rayleigh range for achieving high intensities in a\nfocussed beam over a relatively long distance, and can act as a noninvasive\ntool for probing cold atoms. In this review article, we will briefly introduce\nthe theory of mode propagation in an ultrathin optical fibre and highlight some\nof the more significant theoretical and experimental progresses to date,\nincluding the early work on atom probing, manipulation and trapping, the study\nof atom-dielectric surface interactions, and the more recent observation of\nnanofibre-mediated nonlinear optics phenomena in atomic media. The\nfunctionality of optical nanofibres in relation to the realisation of\natom-photon hybrid quantum systems is also becoming more evident as some of the\nearlier technical challenges are surpassed and, recently, several schemes to\nimplement optical memories have been proposed. We also discuss some possible\ndirections where this research field may head, in particular in relation to the\nuse of optical nanofibres that can support higher-order modes with an\nassociated orbital angular momentum.\n", "  When atoms and molecules are ionized by laser pulses of finite duration and\nincreasingly high intensities, the validity of the much used dipole\napproximation, in which the spatial dependence and magnetic component of the\nexternal field are neglected, eventually breaks down. We report that when going\nbeyond the dipole approximation for the description of atoms exposed to\nultraviolet light, the spatial dependence of the pulse shape, the envelope,\nprovides the dominant correction, while the spatial dependence of the carrier\nis negligible. We present a first order beyond-dipole correction to the\nHamiltonian which accounts exclusively for nondipole effects stemming from the\ncarrier-envelope of the pulse. We demonstrate by {\\it ab initio} calculations\nfor hydrogen that this approximation, which we will refer to as the {\\it\nenvelope approximation}, reproduces the full interaction beyond the dipole\napproximation for absolute and differential observables and proves to be valid\nfor a broad range of high-frequency fields. This is done both for the\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger and the Dirac equation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the\nenvelope approximation provides an interaction-term which gives rise to faster\nnumerical convergence in terms of partial waves compared to its exact\ncounterpart.\n", "  We continue the investigation into non-maximally symmetric compactifications\nof the heterotic string. In particular, we consider compactifications where the\ninternal space is allowed to depend on two or more external directions. For\npreservation of supersymmetry, this implies that the internal space must in\ngeneral be that of a $Spin(7)$ manifold, which leads to a $1/4$-BPS\nfour-dimensional supersymmetric perturbative vacuum breaking all but one\nsupercharge. We find that these solutions allow for internal geometries\npreviously excluded by the domain-wall-type solutions, and hence the resulting\nfour-dimensional superpotential is more generic. In particular, we find an\ninteresting resemblance to the superpotentials that appear in non-geometric\nflux compactifications of type II string theory. If the vacua are to be used\nfor phenomenological applications, they must be lifted to maximal symmetry by\nsome non-perturbative or higher-order effect.\n", "  We present the universal one-loop effective action for all operators of\ndimension up to six obtained by integrating out massive, non-degenerate\nmultiplets. Our general expression may be applied to loops of heavy fermions or\nbosons, and has been checked against partial results available in the\nliterature. The broad applicability of this approach simplifies one-loop\nmatching from an ultraviolet model to a lower-energy effective field theory\n(EFT), a procedure which is now reduced to the evaluation of a combination of\nmatrices in our universal expression, without any loop integrals to evaluate.\nWe illustrate the relationship of our results to the Standard Model (SM) EFT,\nusing as an example the supersymmetric stop and sbottom squark Lagrangian and\nextracting from our universal expression the Wilson coefficients of\ndimension-six operators composed of SM fields.\n", "  It appears that there are two resonances with $J^P= 1/2^-$ quantum numbers in\nthe energy region near the $\\Lambda(1405)$ hyperon. The nature of these states\nis a topic of current debate. To provide further insight we use Regge\nphenomenology to access how these two resonances fit the established hyperon\nspectrum. We find that only one of these resonances is compatible with a\nthree-quark state.\n", "  There is a growing interest for the search of new light gauge bosons. The\nsmall mass of a new boson can turn various kinds of low-energy experiments to a\nnew discovery machine, depending on their couplings to the standard model\nparticles. It is important to understand the properties of each type of gauge\nboson and their current constraints for a given mass. While the dark photon\n(which couples to the electric charges) and the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson have\nbeen well studied in an extensive mass range, the $U(1)_L$ gauge boson has not\nbeen fully investigated yet. We consider the gauge boson of the $U(1)_L$ in a\nwide mass range $m_{Z'} \\approx 0 - 10^{12} ~\\ev$ and investigate the\nconstraints on its coupling from various experiments, discussing the\nsimilarities and differences from the dark photon and the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge\nboson.\n", "  A two-party quantum communication process with classical inputs and outcomes\ncan be simulated by replacing the quantum channel with a classical one. The\nminimal amount of classical communication required to reproduce the statistics\nof the quantum process is called its communication complexity. In the case of\nmany instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per\ninstance is called the asymptotic communication complexity. Previously, we\nreduced the computation of the asymptotic communication complexity to a convex\nminimization problem. In most cases, the objective function does not have an\nexplicit analytic form, as the function is defined as the maximum over an\ninfinite set of convex functions. Therefore, the overall problem takes the form\nof a minimax problem and cannot directly be solved by standard optimization\nmethods. In this paper, we introduce a simple algorithm to compute the\nasymptotic communication complexity. For some special cases with an analytic\nobjective function one can employ available convex-optimization libraries. In\nthe tested cases our method turned out to be notably faster. Finally, using our\nmethod we obtain 1.238 bits as a lower bound on the asymptotic communication\ncomplexity of a noiseless quantum channel with the capacity of 1 qubit. This\nimproves the previous bound of 1.208 bits.\n", "  We study the solar capture rate of inelastic dark matter with endothermic\nand/or exothermic interactions. By assuming that an inelastic dark matter\nsignal will be observed in next generation direct detection experiments we can\nset a lower bound on the capture rate that is independent of the local dark\nmatter density, the velocity distribution, the galactic escape velocity as well\nas the scattering cross section. In combination with upper limits from neutrino\nobservatories we can place upper bounds on the annihilation channels leading to\nneutrinos. We find that, while endothermic scattering limits are weak in the\nisospin-conserving case, strong bounds may be set for exothermic interactions,\nin particular in the spin-dependent case. Furthermore, we study the\nimplications of observing two direct detection signals, in which case one can\nhalo-independently obtain the dark matter mass and the mass splitting, and\ndisentangle the endothermic/exothermic nature of the scattering. Finally we\ndiscuss isospin violation.\n", "  We study Higgs production through weak boson fusion with subsequent decay to\nbottom quarks. By combining jet substructure techniques and matrix element\nmethods in different limits we motivate this channel as a probe of the\nbottom-Yukawa interactions in the boosted regime. In particular we ameliorate\nthe \"no-go\" results of cut-and-count analyses in this channel. After applying a\ndata-driven reconstruction approach we find that the Higgs-bottom coupling can\nbe limited to $0.82 < y_b/y_b^{\\text{SM}} <1.14$ with $600~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered various dark energy models in the framework\nof a non-canonical scalar field with a Lagrangian density of the form ${\\cal\nL}(\\phi, X)=f(\\phi)X{\\left(\\frac{X}{M^{4}_{Pl}}\\right)}^{\\alpha -1} - V(\\phi)$,\nwhich provides the standard canonical scalar field model for $\\alpha=1$ and\n$f(\\phi)=1$. In this particular non-canonical scalar field model, we have\ncarried out the analysis for $\\alpha=2$. We have then obtained cosmological\nsolutions for constant as well as variable equation of state parameter\n($\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$) for dark energy. We have also performed the data analysis\nfor three different functional forms of $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$ by using the\ncombination of SN Ia, BAO and CMB datasets. We have found that for all the\nchoices of $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$, the SN Ia $+$ CMB/BAO dataset favors the past\ndecelerated and recent accelerated expansion phase of the universe.\nFurthermore, using the combined dataset, we have observed that the\nreconstructed results of $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$ and $q(z)$ are almost choice\nindependent and the resulting cosmological scenarios are in good agreement with\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model (within the $1\\sigma$ confidence contour). We have also\nderived the form of the potentials for each model and the resulting potentials\nare found to be a quartic potential for constant $\\omega_{\\phi}$ and a\npolynomial in $\\phi$ for variable $\\omega_{\\phi}$.\n", "  The paper concerns a continuous model governed by a ODE system originated by\na discrete duopoly model with bounded rationality, based on constant\nconjectural variation. The ultimately boundedness of the solutions (existence\nof an absorbing set in the phase space) is shown and conditions guaranteeing\nthe nonlinear, global, asymptotic stability of solutions have been found using\nthe Liapunov direct method.\n", "  We assess the question whether the SLED (Supersymmetric Large Extra\nDimensions) model admits phenomenologically viable solutions with 4D maximal\nsymmetry. We take into account a finite brane width and a scale invariance (SI)\nbreaking dilaton-brane coupling, both of which should be included in a\nrealistic setup. Provided that the microscopic size of the brane is not tuned\nmuch smaller than the fundamental bulk Planck length, we find that either the\n4D curvature or the size of the extra dimensions is unacceptably large. Since\nthis result is independent of the dilaton-brane couplings, it provides the\nbiggest challenge to the SLED program.\n  In addition, to clarify its potential with respect to the cosmological\nconstant problem, we infer the amount of tuning on model parameters required to\nobtain a sufficiently small 4D curvature. A first answer was recently given in\n[arXiv:1508.01124], showing that 4D flat solutions are only ensured in the SI\ncase by imposing a tuning relation, even if a brane-localized flux is included.\nIn this companion paper, we find that the tuning can in fact be avoided for\ncertain SI breaking brane-dilaton couplings, but only at the price of worsening\nthe phenomenological problem.\n  Our results are obtained by solving the full coupled Einstein-dilaton system\nin a completely consistent way. The brane width is implemented using a\nwell-known ring regularization. In passing, we note that for the couplings\nconsidered here the results of [arXiv:1508.01124] (which only treated\ninfinitely thin branes) are all consistently recovered in the thin brane limit,\nand how this can be reconciled with the concerns about their correctness,\nrecently brought up in [arXiv:1509.04201].\n", "  We recall the relation between Zeta function representation of groups and\ntwo-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theory through Mednikh formula. We prove\nvarious generalisations of Mednikh formulas and define generalization of Zeta\nfunctions representations of groups. We compute some of these functions in the\ncase of the finite group $GL(2, {\\mathbb F}_q)$ and $PGL(2,{\\mathbb F}_q).$ We\nrecall the table characters of these groups for any $q$, compute the\nFrobenius-Schur indicator of their irreducible representations and give the\nexplicit structure of their fusion rings\n", "  We provide detailed comparison between the AMR code Enzo-2.4 and the SPH/N-\nbody code GADGET-3 in the context of isolated or cosmological direct baryonic\ncollapse within dark matter (DM) halos to form supermassive black holes. Gas\nflow is examined by following evolution of basic parameters of accretion flows.\nBoth codes show an overall agreement in the general features of the collapse,\nhowever, many subtle differences exist. For isolated models, the codes increase\ntheir spatial and mass resolutions at different pace, which leads to\nsubstantially earlier collapse in SPH than in AMR cases due to higher\ngravitational resolution in GADGET-3. In cosmological runs, the AMR develops a\nslightly higher baryonic resolution than SPH during halo growth via cold\naccretion permeated by mergers. Still, both codes agree in the buildup of DM\nand baryonic structures. However, with the onset of collapse, this difference\nin mass and spatial resolution is amplified, so evolution of SPH models begins\nto lag behind. Such a delay can have effect on formation/destruction rate of H2\ndue to UV background, and on basic properties of host halos. Finally, isolated\nnon-cosmological models in spinning halos, with spin parameter {\\lambda} ~ 0.01\n- 0.07, show delayed collapse for greater {\\lambda}, but pace of this increase\nis faster for AMR. Within our simulation setup, GADGET-3 requires significantly\nlarger computational resources than Enzo- 2.4 during collapse, and needs\nsimilar resources, during the pre-collapse, cosmological structure formation\nphase. Yet it benefits from substantially higher gravitational force and\nhydrodynamic resolutions, except at the end of collapse.\n", "  We investigate laser cooling of an ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity. We\ndemonstrate that when atomic dipoles are sychronized in the regime of\nsteady-state superradiance, the motion of the atoms may be subject to a giant\nfrictional force leading to potentially very low temperatures. The ultimate\ntemperature limits are determined by a modified atomic linewidth, which can be\norders of magnitude smaller than the cavity linewidth. The cooling rate is\nenhanced by the superradiant emission into the cavity mode allowing reasonable\ncooling rates even for dipolar transitions with ultranarrow linewidth.\n", "  The dynamics of charge migration was modeled to calculate temperature\ndependencies of its thermodynamic equilibrium values such as energy and\nelectronic heat capacity in homogeneous adenine fragments. The energy varies\nfrom nearly polaron one at T~0 to midpoint of the conductivity band at high\ntemperatures. The peak on the graph of electronic heat capacity is observed at\nthe polaron decay temperature.\n", "  We present a novel method for THz generation in lithium niobate using a\nreflective stair-step echelon structure. The echelon produces a discretely\ntilted pulse front with less angular dispersion compared to a high\ngroove-density grating. The THz output was characterized using both a 1-lens\nand 3-lens imaging system to set the tilt angle at room and cryogenic\ntemperatures. Using broadband 800 nm pulses with a pulse energy of 0.95 mJ and\na pulse duration of 70 fs (24 nm FWHM bandwidth, 39 fs transform limited\nwidth), we produced THz pulses with field strengths as high as 500 kV/cm and\npulse energies as high as 3.1 $\\mu$J. The highest conversion efficiency we\nobtained was 0.33%. In addition, we find that the echelon is easily implemented\ninto an experimental setup for quick alignment and optimization.\n", "  A technique for describing scattering states within the nuclear shell model\nis proposed. This technique is applied to scattering of nucleons by $\\alpha$\nparticles based on ab initio No-Core Shell Model calculations of $^5$He and\n$^5$Li nuclei with JISP16 NN interaction.\n", "  We study the ground state phase diagram and the quantum phase transitions in\nspin-1 Bose gases with Raman induced spin-orbit coupling. In addition to the\nBose-Einstein condensates with uniform density, three types of stripe\ncondensation phases that simultaneously break the U(1) symmetry and the\ntranslation symmetry are identified. The transitions between these phases are\ninvestigated, and the occurrences of the various tricritical points are\npredicted. The excitation spectra in the plane-wave phase and the zero-momentum\nphase show rich roton-maxon structures, and their instabilities indicate the\ntendency to develop the crystalline order. We propose the atomic gas of\n$^{23}$Na could be a candidate for observing the stripe condensate with high\ncontrast fringes.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the orbital angular momentum (OAM) conversion\nby the coupled nonlinear optical processes in a quasi-periodically poled LiTaO3\ncrystal. In such crystal, third-harmonic generation (THG) is realized by the\ncoupled second-harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-frequency generation (SFG)\nprocesses, i.e., SHG is dependent on SFG and vice versa. The OAMs of the\ninteracting waves are proved to be conserved in such coupled nonlinear optical\nprocesses. As increasing the input OAM in the experiment, the conversion\nefficiency decreases because of the reduced fundamental power intensity. Our\nresults provide better understanding for the OAM conversions, which can be used\nto efficiently produce an optical OAM state at a short wavelength.\n", "  Nowadays, quantum router is playing a key role in quantum communication and\nquantum network- s. Here we propose a tunable single-photon routing scheme,\nbased on quantum interference, which uses two distant artificial atoms coupling\nto two transmission lines. Depending on the distance between the two atoms, the\ncollective effect will lead to destructive or constructive interference between\nthe scattered photons. Under standing wave condition, single photon from the\nincident channel can be perfectly transmitted or redirected into another\nchannel by asymmetric or symmet- ric reflected phase shift of atoms,\nrespectively. Therefore, we show that our router can be controlled by adjusting\nthe detuning of the atoms and interatomic distance, without any classical\nfield.\n", "  We compute the distribution of minima that are reached dynamically on\nmulti-field axionic landscapes, both numerically and analytically. Such\nlandscapes are well suited for inflationary model building due to the presence\nof shift symmetries and possible alignment effects (the KNP mechanism). The\nresulting distribution of dynamically reached minima differs considerably from\nthe naive expectation based on counting all vacua. These differences are more\npronounced in the presence of many fields due to dynamical selection effects:\nwhile low lying minima are preferred as fields roll down the potential,\ntrajectories are also more likely to get trapped by one of the many nearby\nminima. We show that common analytic arguments based on random matrix theory in\nthe large $D$-limit to estimate the distribution of minima are insufficient for\nquantitative arguments pertaining to the dynamically reached ones. This\ndiscrepancy is not restricted to axionic potentials. We provide an empirical\nexpression for the expectation value of such dynamically reached minimas'\nheight and argue that the cosmological constant problem is not alleviated in\nthe absence of anthropic arguments. We further comment on the likelihood of\ninflation on axionic landscapes in the large D-limit.\n", "  We study the propagation properties and light-matter interactions of the\nfocused doughnut pulses, broadband, single-cycle electromagnetic perturbations\nof toroidal topology first described by Hellwarth and Nouchi in 1996. We show\nhow focused doughnuts are reflected and refracted at planar metallic and\nvacuum-dielectric interfaces leading to complex distortions of the field\nstructure. We also identify the conditions under which these toroidal pulses\nexcite dominant dynamic toroidal dipoles in spherical dielectric particles.\n", "  The anisotropic magnetic properties of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ are investigated, using\nlongitudinal and torque magnetometry. The critical scaling across $T_c$ of the\nlongitudinal magnetization is the one expected for the 2D XY universality\nclass. Modeling the torque for a magnetic field in the basal-plane, and taking\ninto account all in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic couplings, we derive the\neffective 4-fold anisotropy $K_4 \\approx$ 1 10$^5$ erg mole$^{-1}$. Although\nlarger than for the cuprates, it is found too small to account for a\nsignificant departure from the isotropic 2D XY model. The in-plane torque also\nallows us to put an upper bound for the anisotropy of a field-induced shift of\nthe antiferromagnetic ordering temperature.\n", "  The XYZ mesons are mesons that contain a heavy quark and antiquark but have\nproperties that seem to require additional constituents. Some of them are\nelectrically charged, so they must be tetraquark mesons whose additional\nconstituents are a light quark and antiquark. The list of XYZ mesons has grown\nto about two dozen over the last decade. A promising approach to understanding\nthese mesons within QCD is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which reduces\nthe problem to the solution of the Schrodinger equation in potentials that can\nbe calculated using lattice QCD. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation has not yet\nrevealed the pattern of the XYZ mesons, but it provides a compelling framework\nfor understanding them from the fundamental theory.\n", "  We discuss duality orbits and symplectic deformations of D=4 gauged\nsupergravity theories, with focus on N$\\ge$2. We provide a general constructive\nframework for computing symplectic deformations starting from a reference\ngauging, and apply it to many interesting examples. We prove that no continuous\ndeformations are allowed for Fayet-Iliopoulos gaugings of the N=2 STU model and\nin particular that any $\\omega$ deformation is classically trivial. We further\nshow that although in the N=6 truncation of SO(8) maximal supergravity the\n$\\omega$ parameter can be dualized away, in the 'twin' N=2 truncation $\\omega$\nis preserved and a second, new deformation appears. We further provide a full\nclassification and appropriate duality orbits of certain N=4 gauged\nsupergravities, including all inequivalent SO(4)$^2$ gaugings and several\nnon-compact forms.\n", "  Hidden sector D7-branes with non-zero gauge flux are a generic feature of\ntype IIB compactifications. A non-vanishing Fayet-Iliopoulos term induced by\nnon-zero gauge flux leads to a T-brane configuration. Expanding the D7-brane\naction around this T-brane background in the presence of three-form\nsupersymmetry breaking fluxes, we obtain a positive definite contribution to\nthe moduli scalar potential which can be used as an uplifting source for de\nSitter vacua. In this way we provide a higher-dimensional understanding of\nknown 4D mechanisms of de Sitter uplifting based on hidden sector F-terms which\nare non-zero because of D-term stabilisation.\n", "  We report an improved photosensitivity in few-layer tin disulfide (SnS2)\nfield-effect transistors (FETs) following doping with CdSe/ZnS core/shell\nquantum dots (QDs). The hybrid QD-SnS2 FET devices achieve more than 500\npercent increase in the photocurrent response compared with the starting\nSnS2-only FET device and a spectral responsivity reaching over 650 A/W at 400\nnm wavelength. The negligible electrical conductance in a control QD-only FET\ndevice suggests that energy transfer between QDs and SnS2 is the main mechanism\nresponsible for the sensitization effect, which is consistent with the strong\nspectral overlap between QD photoluminescence and SnS2 optical absorption as\nwell as the large nominal donor-acceptor interspacing between QD core and SnS2.\nWe also find an enhanced charge carrier mobility in hybrid QD-SnS2 FETs which\nwe attribute to a reduced contact Schottky barrier width due to an elevated\nbackground charge carrier density.\n", "  In Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging taken on 10 November 2014, four\nimages of supernova (SN) \"Refsdal\" (redshift z=1.49) appeared in an\nEinstein-cross--like configuration (images S1-S4) around an early-type galaxy\nin the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z=0.54). Almost all lens models of the\ncluster have predicted that the SN should reappear within a year in a second\nhost-galaxy image created by the cluster's potential. In HST observations taken\non 11 December 2015, we find a new source at the predicted position of the new\nimage of SN Refsdal approximately 8\" from the previous images S1-S4. This marks\nthe first time the appearance of a SN at a particular time and location in the\nsky was successfully predicted in advance! We use these data and the light\ncurve from the first four observed images of SN Refsdal to place constraints on\nthe relative time delay and magnification of the new image (SX), compared to\nimages S1-S4. This enables us, for the first time, to test \"blind\" lens model\npredictions of both magnifications and time delays for a lensed SN. We find\nthat the timing and brightness of the new image are consistent with the blind\npredictions of a fraction of the models. The reappearance illustrates the\ndiscriminatory power of this blind test and its utility to uncover sources of\nsystematic uncertainty. From planned HST photometry, we expect to reach a\nprecision of 1-2% on the time delay between S1-S4 and SX.\n", "  We analyse the structure of Yukawa couplings in local SU(5) F-theory models\nwith $E_7$ enhancement. These models are the minimal setting in which the whole\nflavour structure for the MSSM charged fermions is encoded in a small region of\nthe entire compactification space. In this setup the $E_7$ symmetry is broken\ndown to SU(5) by means of a 7-brane T-brane background, and further to the MSSM\ngauge group by means of a hypercharge flux that also implements doublet-triplet\nsplitting. At tree-level only one family of quarks and charged leptons is\nmassive, while the other two obtain hierarchically smaller masses when stringy\nnon-perturbative effects are taken into account. We find that there is a unique\n$E_7$ model with such hierarchical flavour structure. The relative simplicity\nof the model allows to perform the computation of Yukawa couplings for a region\nof its parameter space wider than previous attempts, obtaining realistic\nfermion masses and mixings for large parameter regions. Our results are also\nvalid for local models with $E_8$ enhancement, pointing towards a universal\nstructure to describe realistic fermion masses within this framework.\n", "  We propose a simplified model of dark matter with a scalar mediator to\naccommodate the di-photon excess recently observed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations. Decays of the resonance into dark matter can easily account for\na relatively large width of the scalar resonance, while the magnitude of the\ntotal width combined with the constraint on dark matter relic density lead to\nsharp predictions on the parameters of the Dark Sector. Under the assumption of\na rather large width, the model predicts a signal consistent with ~300 GeV dark\nmatter particle in channels with large missing energy. This prediction is not\nyet severely bounded by LHC Run I searches and will be accessible at the LHC\nRun II in the jet plus missing energy channel with more luminosity. Our\nanalysis also considers astrophysical constraints, pointing out that future\ndirect detection experiments will be sensitive to this scenario.\n", "  We consider models for the di-photon resonance observed at ATLAS (with 3.6\nfb^{-1}) and CMS (with 2.6 fb^{-1}). We find there is no conflict between the\nsignal reported at 13 TeV, and the constraints from both experiments at 8 TeV\nwith 20.3 fb^{-1}. We make a simple argument for why adding only one new\nresonance to the standard model (SM) is not sufficient to explain the\nobservation. We explore four viable options: (i): resonance production and\ndecay through loops of messenger fermions or scalars; (ii): a resonant\nmessenger which decays to the di-photon resonance + X; (iii): an edge\nconfiguration where A -> B gamma -> C gamma gamma, and (iv): Hidden Valley-like\nmodels where the resonance decays to a pair of very light (sub-GeV) states,\neach of which in turn decays to a pair of collimated photons that cannot be\ndistinguished from a single photon. Since in each case multiple new states have\nbeen introduced, a wealth of signatures is expected to ensue at Run-2 of LHC.\n", "  Run 2 LHC data show hints of a new resonance in the diphoton distribution at\nan invariant mass of 750 GeV. We analyse the data in terms of a new boson,\nextracting information on its properties and exploring theoretical\ninterpretations. Scenarios covered include a narrow resonance and, as\npreliminary indications suggest, a wider resonance. If the width indications\npersist, the new particle is likely to belong to a strongly-interacting sector.\nWe also show how compatibility between Run 1 and Run 2 data is improved by\npostulating the existence of an additional heavy particle, whose decays are\npossibly related to dark matter.\n", "  The effective actions describing the low-energy dynamics of QFTs involving\ngravity generically exhibit causality violations. These may take the form of\nsuperluminal propagation or Shapiro time advances and allow the construction of\n\"time machines\", i.e. spacetimes admitting closed non-spacelike curves. Here,\nwe discuss critically whether such causality violations may be used as a\ncriterion to identify unphysical effective actions or whether, and how,\ncausality problems may be resolved by embedding the action in a fundamental, UV\ncomplete QFT. We study in detail the case of photon scattering in an\nAichelburg-Sexl gravitational shockwave background and calculate the phase\nshifts in QED for all energies, demonstrating their smooth interpolation from\nthe causality-violating effective action values at low-energy to their\nmanifestly causal high-energy limits. At low energies, these phase shifts may\nbe interpreted as backwards-in-time coordinate jumps as the photon encounters\nthe shock wavefront, and we illustrate how the resulting causality problems\nemerge and are resolved in a two-shockwave time machine scenario. The\nimplications of our results for ultra-high (Planck) energy scattering, in which\ngraviton exchange is modelled by the shockwave background, are highlighted.\n", "  We describe and test a nonperturbatively improved single-plaquette lattice\naction for 4-d SU(2) and SU(3) pure gauge theory, which suppresses large\nfluctuations of the plaquette, without requiring the naive continuum limit for\nsmooth fields. We tune the action parameters based on torelon masses in\nmoderate cubic physical volumes, and investigate the size of cut-off effects in\nother physical quantities, including torelon masses in asymmetric spatial\nvolumes, the static quark potential, and gradient flow observables. In 2-d O(N)\nmodels similarly constructed nearest-neighbor actions have led to a drastic\nreduction of cut-off effects, down to the permille level, in a wide variety of\nphysical quantities. In the gauge theories, we find significant reduction of\nlattice artifacts, and for some observables, the coarsest lattice result is\nvery close to the continuum value. We estimate an improvement factor of 40\ncompared to using the Wilson gauge action to achieve the same statistical\naccuracy and suppression of cut-off effects. The simplicity of the gauge action\nmakes it amenable for dynamical fermion simulations.\n", "  Generalized quantum statistics, such as paraboson and parafermion statistics,\nare characterized by triple relations which are related to Lie (super)algebras\nof type B. The correspondence of the Fock spaces of parabosons, parafermions as\nwell as the Fock space of a system of parafermions and parabosons to\nirreducible representations of (super)algebras of type B will be pointed out.\nExample of generalized quantum statistics connected to the basic classical Lie\nsuperalgebra B(1|1)=osp(3|2) with interesting physical properties, such as\nnoncommutative coordinates, will be given. Therefore the article focuses on the\nquestion, addressed already in 1950 by Wigner: do the equation of motion\ndetermine the quantum mechanical commutation relation?\n", "  High-accuracy dimensional measurements by laser interferometers require\ncorrections because of diffraction, which makes the effective fringe-period\ndifferent from the wavelength of a plane (or spherical) wave $\\lambda_0$. By\nusing a combined X-ray and optical interferometer as a tool to investigate\ndiffraction across a laser beam, we observed wavelength variations as large as\n$10^{-8}\\lambda_0$. We show that they originate from the wavefront evolution\nunder paraxial propagation in the presence of wavefront- and intensity-profile\nperturbations.\n", "  Soft-hadron measurements in high-energy collisions of small systems like p-Pb\nand d-Au show peculiar qualitative features (long-range rapidity correlations,\nflattening of the $p_T$-spectra with increasing hadron mass and centrality,\nnon-vanishing Fourier harmonics in the azimuthal particle distributions)\nsuggestive of the formation of a strongly-interacting medium displaying a\ncollective behaviour, with a hydrodynamic flow as a response to the pressure\ngradients in the initial conditions. Hard observables (high-$p_T$ jet and\nhadron spectra) on the other hand, within the current large systematic\nuncertainties, appear only midly modified with the respect to the benchmark\ncase of minimum-bias p-p collisions. What should one expect for heavy-flavour\nparticles, initially produced in hard processes but tending, in the\nnucleus-nucleus case, to approach kinetic equilibrium with the rest of the\nmedium? This is the issue we address in the present study, showing how the\ncurrent experimental findings are compatible with a picture in which the\nformation of a hot medium even in proton-nucleus collisions modifies the\npropagation and hadronization of heavy-flavour particles.\n", "  A previously derived three-dimensional effective lattice theory describing\nthe thermodynamics of QCD with heavy quarks in the cold and dense region is\nextended through order $\\sim u^5\\kappa^8$ in the combined character and hopping\nexpansion of the original four-dimensional Wilson action. The systematics of\nthe effective theory is investigated to determine its range of validity in\nparameter space. We demonstrate the severe cut-off effects due to lattice\nsaturation, which afflict any lattice results at finite baryon density\nindependent of the sign problem or the quality of effective theories, and which\nhave to be removed by continuum extrapolation. We then show how the effective\ntheory can be solved analytically by means of a linked cluster expansion, which\nis completely unaffected by the sign problem, in quantitative agreement with\nnumerical simulations. As an application, we compute the cold nuclear equation\nof state of heavy QCD. Our continuum extrapolated result is consistent with a\npolytropic equation of state for non-relativistic fermions.\n", "  In this work, we present a theoretical and experimental study about the\nspatial correlations of paired photons generated by type-II spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion. In particular, we show how these correlations can\nbe positive or negative depending on the direction in which the far field plane\nis scanned and the polarization post-selected. Our results provide a\nstraightforward way to observe different kind of correlations, that complement\nother well known methods to tune the spatial correlations of paired photons.\n", "  This work constitutes one part of an investigation of the low-temperature\nchanges of the properties of the eta' meson. In turn these properties are\nstrongly tied to the U(1)_A anomaly of Quantum Chromodynamics. The final aim is\nto explore the interplay of the chiral anomaly and in-medium effects. We\ndetermine the lifetime of an eta' meson being at rest in a strongly interacting\nmedium as a function of the temperature. To have a formally well-defined\nlow-energy limit we use in a first step Chiral Perturbation Theory for a large\nnumber of colors. We determine the pertinent scattering amplitudes in leading\nand next-to-leading order. In a second step we include resonances that appear\nin the same mass range as the eta' meson. The resonances are introduced such\nthat the low-energy limit remains unchanged and that they saturate the\ncorresponding low-energy constants. This requirement fixes all coupling\nconstants. We find that the width of the eta' meson is significantly increased\nfrom about 200 keV in vacuum to about 10 MeV at a temperature of 120 MeV.\n", "  We consider interpretations of the recent $\\sim 3 \\sigma$ reports by the CMS\nand ATLAS collaborations of a possible $X(\\sim 750~{\\rm GeV})$ state decaying\ninto $\\gamma \\gamma$ final states. We focus on the possibilities that this is a\nscalar or pseudoscalar electroweak isoscalar state produced by gluon-gluon\nfusion mediated by loops of heavy fermions. We consider several models for\nthese fermions, including a single vector-like charge $2/3$ T quark, a doublet\nof vector-like quarks $(T, B)$, and a vector-like generation of quarks, with or\nwithout leptons that also contribute to the $X \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ decay\namplitude. We also consider the possibility that $X(750)$ is a dark matter\nmediator, with a neutral vector-like dark matter particle. These scenarios are\ncompatible with the present and prospective direct limits on vector-like\nfermions from LHC Runs 1 and 2, as well as indirect constraints from\nelectroweak precision measurements, and we show that the required Yukawa-like\ncouplings between the $X$ particle and the heavy vector-like fermions are small\nenough to be perturbative so long as the $X$ particle has dominant decay modes\ninto $gg$ and $\\gamma \\gamma$. The decays $X \\to Z Z, Z \\gamma$ and $W^+ W^-$\nare interesting prospective signatures that may help distinguish between\ndifferent vector-like fermion scenarios.\n", "  In this paper we explore the possibility of a pseudoscalar resonance to\naccount for the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed both at ATLAS and at CMS. We\nanalyze the ingredients needed from the low energy perspective to obtain a\nsufficiently large diphoton rate to explain the signal while avoiding\nconstraints from other channels. Additionally, we point out composite Higgs\nmodels in which one can naturally obtain a pseudoscalar at the 750 GeV mass\nscale and we estimate the pseudoscalar couplings to standard model particles\nthat one would have in such models. A generic feature of models that can\nexplain the excess is the presence of new particles in addition to the 750 GeV\nstate. Finally, we note that due to the origin of the coupling of the resonance\nto photons, one expects to see comparable signals in the $Z\\gamma$, $ZZ$, and\n$WW$ channels.\n", "  We interpret the di-photon excess recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations as a new resonance arising from the sgoldstino scalar, which is\nthe superpartner of the Goldstone mode of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking,\nthe goldstino. The sgoldstino is produced at the LHC via gluon fusion and\ndecays to photons, with interaction strengths proportional to the corresponding\ngaugino masses over the supersymmetry breaking scale. Fitting the excess, while\nevading bounds from searches in the di-jet, $Z\\gamma$, $ZZ$ and $WW$ final\nstates, selects the supersymmetry breaking scale to be a few TeV, and\nparticular ranges for the gaugino masses. The two real scalars, corresponding\nto the CP-even and CP-odd parts of the complex sgoldstino, both have narrow\nwidths, but their masses can be split of the order 10-30 GeV by electroweak\nmixing corrections, which could account for the preference of a wider resonance\nwidth in the current low-statistics data. In the parameter space under\nconsideration, tree-level $F$-term contributions to the Higgs mass arise, in\naddition to the standard $D$-term contribution proportional to the $Z$-boson\nmass, which can significantly enhance the tree level Higgs mass.\n", "  A Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole (BH) is superradiantly unstable against\nspherical perturbations of a charged scalar field, enclosed in a cavity, with\nfrequency lower than a critical value. We use numerical relativity techniques\nto follow the development of this unstable system -- dubbed a charged BH bomb\n-- into the non-linear regime, solving the full Einstein--Maxwell--Klein-Gordon\nequations, in spherical symmetry. We show that: $i)$ the process stops before\nall the charge is extracted from the BH; $ii)$ the system settles down into a\nhairy BH: a charged horizon in equilibrium with a scalar field condensate,\nwhose phase is oscillating at the (final) critical frequency. For low scalar\nfield charge, $q$, the final state is approached smoothly and monotonically.\nFor large $q$, however, the energy extraction overshoots and an explosive\nphenomenon, akin to a $bosenova$, pushes some energy back into the BH. The\ncharge extraction, by contrast, does not reverse.\n", "  The simplest way to create sterile neutrinos in the early Universe is by\ntheir admixture to active neutrinos. However, this mechanism, connected to the\nDark Matter (DM) problem by Dodelson and Widrow (DW), cannot simultaneously\nmeet the relic abundance constraint as well as bounds from structure formation\nand X-rays. Nonetheless, unless a symmetry forces active-sterile mixing to\nvanish exactly, the DW mechanism will unavoidably affect the sterile neutrino\nDM population created by any other production mechanism. We present a\nsemi-analytic approach to the DW mechanism acting on an arbitrary initial\nabundance of sterile neutrinos, allowing to combine DW with any other preceding\nproduction mechanism in a physical and precise way. While previous analyses\nusually assumed that the spectra produced by DW and another mechanism can\nsimply be added, we use our semi-analytic results to discuss the validity of\nthis assumption and to quantify its accurateness, thereby also scrutinising the\nDW spectrum and the derived mass bounds. We then map our results to the case of\nsterile neutrino DM from the decay of a real SM singlet coupled to the Higgs.\nFinally, we will investigate aspects of structure formation beyond the usual\nsimple free-streaming estimates in order to judge on the effects of the DW\nmodification on the sterile neutrino DM spectra generated by scalar decay.\n", "  We study symmetries of quantum field theories involving topologically\ndistinct sectors of the field space. To exhibit these symmetries we define\nspecial gauge invariant observables, which we call the $qq$-characters. In the\ncontext of the BPS/CFT correspondence, using these observables, we derive an\ninfinite set of Dyson-Schwinger-type relations. These relations imply that the\nsupersymmetric partition functions in the presence of $\\Omega$-deformation and\ndefects obey the Ward identities of two dimensional conformal field theory and\nits $q$-deformations. The details will be discussed in the companion papers.\n", "  We consider the quantum-control task of obtaining a target unitary operation\nvia control fields that couple to the quantum system and are chosen to best\nmitigate errors resulting from time-dependent noise. We allow for two sources\nof noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the\nenvironment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation\nrooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical\nstatistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms\nof a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,\nnoise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error\nmitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the\nsought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error\nmitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,\nthose that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the\ncontrol fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in\nterms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the\n`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with\nrespect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation\nof constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that\nthey feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by\nconsidering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$\narbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal\nerror-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is\nvalid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,\n$s \\to \\infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework\nfor addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of\narbitrary complexity.\n", "  We explore the spectra and localization properties of the N-site banded\none-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices that arise naturally in sparse\nneural networks. Approximately equal numbers of random excitatory and\ninhibitory connections lead to spatially localized eigenfunctions, and an\nintricate eigenvalue spectrum in the complex plane that controls the\nspontaneous activity and induced response. A finite fraction of the eigenvalues\ncondense onto the real or imaginary axes. For large N, the spectrum has\nremarkable symmetries not only with respect to reflections across the real and\nimaginary axes, but also with respect to 90 degree rotations, with an unusual\nanisotropic divergence in the localization length near the origin. When chains\nwith periodic boundary conditions become directed, with a systematic\ndirectional bias superimposed on the randomness, a hole centered on the origin\nopens up in the density-of-states in the complex plane. All states are extended\non the rim of this hole, while the localized eigenvalues outside the hole are\nunchanged. The bias dependent shape of this hole tracks the bias independent\ncontours of constant localization length. We treat the large-N limit by a\ncombination of direct numerical diagonalization and using transfer matrices, an\napproach that allows us to exploit an electrostatic analogy connecting the\n\"charges\" embodied in the eigenvalue distribution with the contours of constant\nlocalization length. We show that similar results are obtained for more\nrealistic neural networks that obey \"Dale's Law\" (each site is purely\nexcitatory or inhibitory), and conclude with perturbation theory results that\ndescribe the limit of large bias g, when all states are extended. Related\nproblems arise in random ecological networks and in chains of artificial cells\nwith randomly coupled gene expression patterns.\n", "  The CHIANTI atomic database was first released in 1996 and has had a huge\nimpact on the analysis and modeling of emissions from astrophysical plasmas.\nThe database has continued to be updated, with version 8 released in 2015.\nAtomic data for modeling the emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are\ncontained in CHIANTI, together with data for deriving the ionization fractions\nof all elements up to zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized\nhere and their formats discussed. Statistics on the impact of CHIANTI to the\nastrophysical community are given and examples of the diverse range of\napplications are presented.\n", "  We present a method to compute the Laurent expansion of the two-loop sunrise\nintegral with equal non-zero masses to arbitrary order in the dimensional\nregularisation $\\varepsilon$. This is done by introducing a class of functions\n(generalisations of multiple polylogarithms to include the elliptic case) and\nby showing that all integrations can be carried out within this class of\nfunctions.\n", "  Atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are ubiquitous in research laboratories and\nhave recently been priced for use in teaching laboratories. Here we review\nseveral AFM platforms (Dimension 3000 by Digital Instruments, EasyScan2 by\nNanosurf, ezAFM by Nanomagnetics, and TKAFM by Thorlabs) and describe various\nbiophysical experiments that could be done in the teaching laboratory using\nthese instruments. In particular, we focus on experiments that image biological\nmaterials and quantify biophysical parameters: 1) imaging cells to determine\nmembrane tension, 2) imaging microtubules to determine their persistence\nlength, 3) imaging the random walk of DNA molecules to determine their contour\nlength, and 4) imaging stretched DNA molecules to measure the tensional force.\n", "  We define the QCD Husimi distribution as the phase space distribution of\npartons inside the nucleon. Compared to the more well-known Wigner\ndistribution, the Husimi distribution is better behaved and positive. It thus\nallows for a probabilistic interpretation and can be used to define the\n`entropy' of the nucleon as a measure of complexity of the partonic structure.\nA possible connection to the Color Glass Condensate approach at small-$x$ is\nalso discussed.\n", "  We present a Heisenberg operator based formulation of coherent quantum\nfeedback and Pyragas control. This model is easy to implement and allows for an\nefficient and fast calculation of the dynamics of feedback-driven observables\nas the number of contributing correlations grows in systems with a fixed number\nof excitations only linearly in time. Furthermore, our model unravels the\nquantum kinetics of entanglement growth in the system by explicitly calculating\nnon-Markovian multi-time correlations, e.g., how the emission of a photon is\ncorrelated with an absorption process in the past. Therefore, the time-delayed\ndifferential equations are expressed in terms of insightful physical\nquantities. Another considerate advantage of this method is its compatibility\nto typical approximation schemes, such as factorization techniques and the\nsemi-classical treatment of coherent fields. This allows the application on a\nvariety of setups, ranging from closed quantum systems in the few excitation\nregimes to open systems and Pyragas control in general.\n", "  We introduce a minimal and yet comprehensive framework with $CP$- and\nclassical scale-symmetries, in order to simultaneously address the hierarchy\nproblem, neutrino masses, dark matter, and inflation. One complex gauge singlet\nscalar and three flavors of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are added to\nthe standard model content, facilitating the see-saw mechanism, among others.\nAn adimensional theory of gravity (Agravity) is employed, allowing for the\ntrans-Planckian field excursions. The weak and Planck scales are induced by the\nHiggs portal and the scalar non-minimal couplings, respectively, once a\nColeman-Weinberg dynamically-generated vacuum expectation value for the singlet\nscalar is obtained. All scales are free from any mutual quadratic\ndestabilization. The $CP$-symmetry prevents a decay of the pseudoscalar\nsinglet, rendering it a suitable WIMPzilla dark matter candidate with the\ncorrect observational relic abundance. Identifying the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nboson of the (approximate) scale symmetry with the inflaton field, the model\naccommodates successful slow-roll inflation, compatible with the observational\ndata. We reach the conclusion that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone inflaton, within a\nclassically scale-symmetric framework, yields lighter WIMPzillas.\n", "  We consider first order transition amplitudes in external fields in QED in\nthe expanding de Sitter space and point out that they are gauge dependent\nquantities. We examine the gauge variations of the amplitudes assuming a\ndecoupling of the interaction at large times, which allows to conclude that the\nsource of the problem lies in the fact that the frequencies of the modes in the\ninfinite future become independent of the comoving momenta. We show that a\npossibility to assure the gauge invariance of the external field amplitudes is\nto restrict to potentials which vanish sufficiently fast at infinite times, and\nbriefly discuss a number of options in the face of the possible gauge\ninvariance violation in the full interacting theory.\n", "  We consider the excitation of Rydberg states through photons carrying an\nintrinsic orbital angular momentum degree of freedom. Laguerre-Gauss modes,\nwith a helical wave-front structure, correspond to such a set of laser beams,\nwhich carry some units of orbital angular momentum in their propagation\ndirection. We demonstrate that, in a proper geometrical setting, this orbital\nangular momentum can be transferred to the internal degrees of freedom of the\natoms, thus violating the standard dipolar selection rules. Higher orbital\nangular momentum states become accessible through a single photon excitation\nprocess. We investigate how the spacial structure of the Laguerre-Gauss beam\naffects the radial coupling strength, assuming the simplest case of\nhydrogen-like wavefunctions. Finally we discuss a generalization of the angular\nmomentum coupling, in order to include the effects of the fine and hyperfine\nsplitting, in the context of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n", "  Scalar-tensor theories of gravity can lead to modifications of the\ngravitational force inside astrophysical objects. We exhibit that compact stars\nsuch as white dwarfs provide a unique set-up to test beyond Horndeski theories\nof ${\\rm G}^3$ type. We obtain stringent and independent constraints on the\nparameter $\\Upsilon$ characterizing the deviations from Newtonian gravity using\nthe mass-radius relation, the Chandrasekhar mass limit and the maximal\nrotational frequency of white dwarfs. We find that white dwarfs impose stronger\nconstraints on $\\Upsilon$ than red and brown dwarfs.\n", "  We consider Hamiltonian closures of the Vlasov equation using the phase-space\nmoments of the distribution function. We provide some conditions on the\nclosures imposed by the Jacobi identity. We completely solve some families of\nexamples. As a result, we show that imposing that the resulting reduced system\npreserves the Hamiltonian character of the parent model shapes its phase space\nby creating a set of Casimir invariants as a direct consequence of the Jacobi\nidentity.\n", "  We introduce a semi-classical wavefunction (SCWF) model for strong-field\nphysics and attosecond science. When applied to high harmonic generation (HHG),\nthis formalism allows one to show that the natural time-domain separation of\nthe contribution of ionization, propagation and recollisions to the HHG process\nleads to a frequency-domain factorization of the harmonic yield into these same\ncontributions, for any choice of atomic or molecular potential. We first derive\nthe factorization from the natural expression of the dipole signal in the\ntemporal domain by using a reference system, as in the quantitative\nrescattering (QRS) formalism [J. Phys. B. 43, 122001 (2010)]. Alternatively, we\nshow how the trajectory component of the SCWF can be used to express the\nfactorization, which also allows one to attribute individual contributions to\nthe spectrum to the underlying trajectories.\n", "  The resonance $S$ at $\\sim 750$ GeV in the diphoton channel observed by ATLAS\nand CMS, if it holds up, is almost certainly the ($S$)cion of a larger dynasty\nin a UV completion that may very well be connected to the hierarchy problem. At\nthis stage, however, an effective field theory framework provides a useful way\nto parametrize searches for this resonance in other channels. Assuming that the\nexcess is due to a new scalar or pseudoscalar boson, we study associated\nproduction of $S$ (\"$S$-strahlung\") at the LHC and propose searches in several\nclean channels like $\\gamma\\gamma\\ell\\ell$, $\\gamma\\gamma\\ell\\eslash$ and\n$\\ell\\ell\\ell\\gamma\\eslash$ to probe dimension-5 operators coupling $S$ to\nStandard Model gauge bosons. We consider a range of widths for $S$, from 5 GeV\nto 45 GeV, and find that the three channels probe complementary regions of\nparameter space and the suppression scale $\\Lambda$. The finding of most\nimmediate relevance is that with 3 fb$^{-1}$, the LHC might already reveal new\nexcesses in the $\\gamma\\gamma\\ell\\ell$ channel and a 5(3) $\\sigma$ discovery\nmay already be possible after collecting 65(25) fb$^{-1}$ of data with\n$\\ell\\ell\\ell\\gamma\\eslash$ events if the scale of the new physics is within\n$\\sim $ 9 TeV for couplings respecting 8 TeV LHC bounds and compatible with the\nobserved excess in diphotons for a wide resonance as suggested by the ATLAS\nCollaboration. Beyond the EFT parametrization, we found realizations of models\nwith heavy vector-like quarks and leptons which can simultaneously fit the\ndiphoton excess and be discovered in the channels proposed here.\n", "  We propose a simple model of split supersymmetry from gauge mediation. This\nmodel features gauginos that are parametrically a loop factor lighter than\nscalars, accommodates a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, and incorporates a simple\nsolution to the $\\mu-b_\\mu$ problem. The gaugino mass suppression can be\nunderstood as resulting from collective symmetry breaking. Imposing collider\nbounds on $\\mu$ and requiring viable electroweak symmetry breaking implies\nsmall $a$-terms and small $\\tan \\beta$ -- the stop mass ranges from $10^5$ to\n$10^8 \\mbox{ GeV}$. In contrast with models with anomaly + gravity mediation\n(which also predict a one-loop loop suppression for gaugino masses), our gauge\nmediated scenario predicts aligned squark masses and a gravitino LSP. Gluinos,\nelectroweakinos and Higgsinos can be accessible at the LHC and/or future\ncolliders for a wide region of the allowed parameter space.\n", "  We discuss how the leading electroweak Higgs production processes at the LHC,\nnamely vector-boson fusion and Higgs+W/Z associated production, can be\ncharacterized in generic extensions of the Standard Model by a proper set of\npseudo-observables (PO). We analyze the symmetry properties of these PO and\ntheir relation with the PO set appearing in Higgs decays. We discuss in detail\nthe kinematical studies necessary to extract the production PO from data, and\npresent a first estimate of the LHC sensitivity on these observables in the\nhigh-luminosity phase. The impact of QCD corrections and the kinematical\nstudies necessary to test the validity of the momentum expansion at the basis\nof the PO decomposition are also discussed.\n", "  Cross-spectrum analysis is a commonly-used technique for the detection of\nphase and amplitude noise of a signal in the presence of interfering noise. It\nextracts the desired correlated noise from two time series in the presence of\nuncorrelated interfering noise. Recently, we demonstrated that the\nphase-inversion (anti-correlation) effect due to AM noise leakage can cause\ncomplete or partial collapse of the cross-spectral function. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the newly discovered effect of anti-correlated thermal noise that\noriginates from the common-mode power divider (splitter), an essential\ncomponent in a cross-spectrum noise measurement system. We studied this effect\nfor different power splitters and discuss its influence on the measurement of\nthermal-noise limited oscillators. An oscillator whose thermal noise is\nprimarily set by the 50 ohm source resistance is referred to as a\nthermally-limited oscillator. We provide theory, simulation and experimental\nresults. In addition, we expand this study to reveal how the presence of\nferrite-isolators and amplifiers at the output ports of the power splitters can\naffect the oscillator noise measurements. Finally, we discuss a possible\nsolution to overcome this problem.\n", "  Stable 30 fs pulses centered at 1068 nm (less than 10 optical cycles) are\ndemonstrated in a diode pumped Yb:CaYAlO4 laser by using high-quality chemical\nvapor deposited monolayer graphene as the saturable absorber. The mode locked\n8.43 optical-cycle pulses have a spectral bandwidth of ~ 50 nm and a pulse\nrepetition frequency of ~ 113.5 MHz. To our knowledge, this is the shortest\npulse ever reported for graphene mode-locked lasers and mode-locked Yb-doped\nbulk lasers. Our experimental results demonstrate that graphene mode locking is\na very promising practical technique to generate few-cycle optical pulses\ndirectly from a laser oscillator.\n", "  We investigate the potential for the eLISA space-based interferometer to\ndetect the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by strong\nfirst-order cosmological phase transitions. We discuss the resulting\ncontributions from bubble collisions, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, and sound\nwaves to the stochastic background, and estimate the total corresponding signal\npredicted in gravitational waves. The projected sensitivity of eLISA to\ncosmological phase transitions is computed in a model-independent way for\nvarious detector designs and configurations. By applying these results to\nseveral specific models, we demonstrate that eLISA is able to probe many\nwell-motivated scenarios beyond the Standard Model of particle physics\npredicting strong first-order cosmological phase transitions in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  We use holographic techniques to study the zero-temperature limit of\ndissipation for a Brownian particle moving in a strongly coupled CFT at finite\ntemperature in various space-time dimensions. The dissipative term in the\nboundary theory for $\\omega\\to 0$, $T \\to 0$ with $\\omega / T$ held small and\nfixed, does not match the same at $T=0$, $\\omega \\to 0$. Thus the $T\\to 0$\nlimit is not smooth for $\\omega < T$. This phenomenon appears to be related to\na confinement-deconfinement phase transition at $T=0$ in the field theory.\n", "  The Inert Doublet Model and its extension with an additional complex singlet\nis considered. The CP violation aspects are analysed in the simplified case,\nwith one SM-like Higgs doublet and a complex singlet.\n", "  Recent experiments probing a new ferroelectric liquid crystal (CLF08)\nconfined in cells with planar alignment have shown dielectric and optic\nanomalies suggesting the onset of ferrielectric ordering within the surface\nlattice of dechiralisation lines. We present a phenomenological theory\ndescribing the corresponding phase transitions sequence SmA->SmC*->Ferri. Phase\ndiagrams, thermodynamic, dielectric and optic properties are worked out and\ncompared with experiments. The anomalies are related to the predicted\ntristability of the experimental cells under applied electric field. The order\nparameters of Landau theory are reinterpreted in terms of line positions,\nallowing the description of the entrance/exit lines behavior, and yielding the\nprediction and identification of new limit phases within a non-conventional\nLandau approach.\n", "  A general formula for the orbital magnetic moment of interacting electrons in\nsolids is derived using the many-electron Green function method. The formula\nfactorizes into two parts, a part that contains the information about the\none-particle band structure of the system and a part that contains the effects\nof exchange and correlations carried by the Green function. The derived formula\nprovides a convenient means of including the effects of exchange and\ncorrelations beyond the commonly used local density approximation of density\nfunctional theory.\n", "  We have developed an efficient computational method to treat long,\none-dimensional systems of strongly-interacting atoms forming self-assembled\nspin chains. Such systems can be used to realize many spin chain model\nHamiltonians tunable by the external confining potential. As a concrete\ndemonstration, we consider quantum state transfer in a Heisenberg spin chain\nand we show how to determine the confining potential in order to obtain\nnearly-perfect state transfer.\n", "  We provide the ultimate explanation of one of the core features of\nmicrowave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations in high mobility two\ndimensional electron systems: the 1/4-cycle phase shift of minima. We start\nwith the radiation-driven electron orbits model with the novel concept of\nscattering flight-time between Landau states. We calculate the extrema and\nnodes positions obtaining an exact coincidence with the experimental ones. The\nmain finding is that the physical origin of the phase shift is a delay of\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ of the radiation-driven Landau guiding center with respect to\nradiation, demonstrating the oscillating nature of the irradiated Landau\nstates.\n  We analyze the dependence of this minima on radiation frequency and power and\nits possible shift with the quality of the sample\n", "  We establish a set of new on-shell recursion relations for amplitudes\nsatisfying soft theorems. The recursion relations can apply to those amplitudes\nwhose additional physical inputs from soft theorems are enough to overcome the\nbad large-z behaviour. This work is a generalization of the recursion relations\nrecently obtained by Cheung et al for amplitudes in scalar effective field\ntheories with enhanced vanishing soft behaviours, which can be regarded as a\nspecial case of those with non-vanishing soft limits. We apply the recursion\nrelations to tree-level amplitudes in various theories, including amplitudes in\nthe Akulov-Volkov theory, amplitudes containing dilatons of\nspontaneously-broken conformal symmetry.\n", "  The addition of the QCD axion to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) not only solves the strong CP problem but also modifies the dark sector\nwith new dark matter candidates. While SUSY axion phenomenology is usually\nrestricted to searches for the axion itself or searches for the ordinary SUSY\nparticles, this work focuses on scenarios where the axion's superpartner, the\naxino, may be detectable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the decays of\nneutralinos displaced from the primary vertex. In particular, we focus on the\nKSVZ axino within the hadronic axion window. The decay length of neutralinos in\nthis scenario easily fits the ATLAS detector for SUSY spectra expected to be\ntestable at the 14 TeV LHC. We compare this signature of displaced decays to\naxinos to other well motivated scenarios containing a long lived neutralino\nwhich decays inside the detector. These alternative scenarios can in some cases\nvery closely mimic the expected axino signature, and the degree to which they\nare distinguishable is discussed. We also briefly comment on the cosmological\nviability of such a scenario.\n", "  We discuss non-standard interpretations of the 750 GeV diphoton excess\nrecently reported by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations which do not involve a\nnew, relatively broad, resonance with a mass near 750 GeV. Instead, we consider\nthe sequential cascade decay of a much heavier, possibly quite narrow,\nresonance into two photons along with one or more invisible particles. The\nresulting diphoton invariant mass signal is generically rather broad, as\nsuggested by the data. We examine three specific event topologies - the antler,\nthe sandwich, and the 2-step cascade decay, and show that they all can provide\na good fit to the observed published data. In each case, we delineate the\npreferred mass parameter space selected by the best fit. In spite of the\npresence of invisible particles in the final state, the measured missing\ntransverse energy is moderate, due to its anti- correlation with the diphoton\ninvariant mass. We comment on the future prospects of discriminating with\nhigher statistics between our scenarios, as well as from more conventional\ninterpretations.\n", "  We numerically construct asymptotically AdS black brane solutions of $D=4$\nEinstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a pseudoscalar. The solutions are\nholographically dual to $d=3$ CFTs at finite chemical potential and in a\nconstant magnetic field, which spontaneously break translation invariance\nleading to the spontaneous formation of abelian and momentum magnetisation\ncurrents flowing around the plaquettes of a periodic Bravais lattice. We\nanalyse the three-dimensional moduli space of lattice solutions, which are\ngenerically oblique, and show, for a specific value of the magnetic field, that\nthe free energy is minimised by the triangular lattice, associated with minimal\npacking of circles in the plane. We show that the average stress tensor for the\nthermodynamically preferred phase is that of a perfect fluid and that this\nresult applies more generally to spontaneously generated periodic phases. The\ntriangular structure persists at low temperatures indicating the existence of\nnovel crystalline ground states.\n", "  Quantizing the mirror curve of certain toric Calabi-Yau (CY) three-folds\nleads to a family of trace class operators. The resolvent function of these\noperators is known to encode topological data of the CY. In this paper, we show\nthat in certain cases, this resolvent function satisfies a system of non-linear\nintegral equations whose structure is very similar to the Thermodynamic Bethe\nAnsatz (TBA) systems. This can be used to compute spectral traces, both exactly\nand as a semiclassical expansion. As a main example, we consider the system\nrelated to the quantized mirror curve of local $\\mathbb P^2$. According to a\nrecent proposal, the traces of this operator are determined by the refined BPS\nindices of the underlying CY. We use our non-linear integral equations to test\nthat proposal.\n", "  We observe power-law scaling of the temporal onset of excitations with quench\nspeed in the neighborhood of the quantum phase transition between the polar and\nbroken-axisymmetry phases in a small spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. As the system is driven through the quantum critical point by\ntuning the Hamiltonian, the vanishing energy gap between the ground state and\nfirst excited state causes the reaction time scale of the system to diverge,\npreventing it from adiabatically following the ground state. We measure the\ntemporal evolution of the spin populations for different quench speeds and\ndetermine the exponents characterizing the scaling of the onset of excitations,\nwhich are in good agreement with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.\n", "  Transient reflectivity (TR) measured at laser photon energy 1.51 eV from the\nindirectly intersurface coupled topological insulator Bi2-xMnxSe3 films (12 nm\nthick) revealed a strong dependence of the rise-time and initial decay-time\nconstants on photoexcited carrier density and Mn content. In undoped samples (x\n= 0), these time constants are exclusively governed by electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon scattering, respectively, whereas in films with x = 0.013 -\n0.27 ultrafast carrier dynamics are completely controlled by photoexcited\nelectron trapping by ionized Mn2+ acceptors and their dimers. The shortest\ndecay-time (~0.75 ps) measured for the film with x = 0.27 suggests a great\npotential of Mn-doped Bi2Se3 films for applications in high-speed\noptoelectronic devices. Using Raman spectroscopy exploiting similar laser\nphoton energy (1.58 eV), we demonstrate that due to indirect intersurface\ncoupling in the films, the photoexcited electron trapping in the bulk enhances\nthe electron-phonon interaction strength in Dirac surface states.\n", "  We have recently implemented a new version of the quasiparticle\nself-consistent GW (QSGW) method in the ecalj package released at\nhttp://github.com/tkotani/ecalj. Since the new version of the ecalj is\nnumerically stable and accurate compared to the previous versions, we can\nperform calculations easily without being bothered with setting input\nparameters. Here we examine its ability to describe energy band properties,\ne.g., band-gap energy, eigenvalues at special points and effective mass, for\nvariety of semiconductors and insulators. We treat C, Si, Ge, Sn, SiC (in 2H,\n3C, and 4H structures), (Al, Ga, N)x(N, P, As, Pb), (Zn, Cd, Mg)x(O, S, Se,\nTe), SiO2, HfO2, ZrO2, SrTiO3, PbS, PbTe, MnO, NiO, and HgO. We propose that a\nhybrid QSGW method, where we mix 80 percent of QSGW and 20 percent of LDA,\ngives universally good agreement with experiments for these materials.\n", "  Supersymmetry provides a well-established theoretical framework for\nextensions of the standard model of particle physics and the general\nunderstanding of quantum field theories. We summarise here our investigations\nof N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge symmetry using the\nnon-perturbative first-principles method of numerical lattice simulations. The\nstrong interactions of gluons and their superpartners, the gluinos, lead to\nconfinement, and a spectrum of bound states including glueballs, mesons, and\ngluino-glueballs emerges at low energies. For unbroken supersymmetry these\nparticles have to be arranged in supermultiplets of equal masses. In lattice\nsimulations supersymmetry can only be recovered in the continuum limit since it\nis explicitly broken by the discretisation. We present the first continuum\nextrapolation of the mass spectrum of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The\nresults are consistent with the formation of supermultiplets and the absence of\nnon-perturbative sources of supersymmetry breaking. Our investigations also\nindicate that numerical lattice simulations can be applied to non-trivial\nsupersymmetric theories.\n", "  We report on the mass measurements of several neutron-rich $\\mathrm{Rb}$ and\n$\\mathrm{Sr}$ isotopes in the $A \\approx 100$ region with the TITAN\nPenning-trap mass spectrometer. Using highly charged ions in the charge state\n$q=10+$, the masses of $^{98,99}\\mathrm{Rb}$ and $^{98-100}\\mathrm{Sr}$ have\nbeen determined with a precision of $6 - 12\\ \\mathrm{keV}$, making their\nuncertainty negligible for r-process nucleosynthesis network calculations. The\nmass of $^{101}\\mathrm{Sr}$ has been determined directly for the first time\nwith a precision eight times higher than the previous indirect measurement and\na deviation of $3\\sigma$ when compared to the Atomic Mass Evaluation. We also\nconfirm the mass of $^{100}\\mathrm{Rb}$ from a previous measurement.\nFurthermore, our data indicates the existance of a low-lying isomer with $80\\\n\\mathrm{keV}$ excitation energy in $^{98}\\mathrm{Rb}$. We show that our updated\nmass values lead to minor changes in the r-process by calculating fractional\nabundances in the $A\\approx 100$ region of the nuclear chart.\n", "  In high energy hadron-hadron collisions, dijet production with large rapidity\nseparation proposed by Mueller and Navelet, is one of the most interesting\nprocesses which can help us to directly access the well-known\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution dynamics. The objective of this work is\nto study the Sudakov resummation of Mueller-Navelet jets. Through the one-loop\ncalculation, Sudakov type logarithms are obtained for this process when the\nproduced dijets are almost back-to-back. These results could play an important\nrole in the phenomenological study of dijet correlations with large rapidity\nseparation at the LHC.\n", "  We construct and study the first supersymmetric black-hole and black-string\nsolutions of non-Abelian-gauged N=1,d=5 supergravity (N=1,d=5\nSuper-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory) with non-trivial SU(2) gauge fields: BPST\ninstantons for black holes and BPS monopoles of different kinds\n('t~Hooft-Polyakov, Wu-Yang and Protogenov) for black strings and also for\ncertain black holes that are well defined solutions only for very specific\nvalues of all the moduli. Instantons, as well as colored monopoles do not\ncontribute to the masses and tensions but do contribute to the entropies.\n  The construction is based on the characterization of the supersymmetric\nsolutions of gauged N=1,d=5 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets achieved\nin Ref. Bellorin:2007yp which we elaborate upon by finding the rules to\nconstruct supersymmetric solutions with one additional isometry, both for the\ntimelike and null classes. These rules automatically connect the timelike and\nnull non-Abelian supersymmetric solutions of N=1,d=5 SEYM theory with the\ntimelike ones of N=2,d=4 SEYM theory by dimensional reduction and oxidation. In\nthe timelike-to-timelike case the singular Kronheimer reduction recently\nstudied in Ref. Bueno:2015wva plays a crucial role.\n", "  A method, called beatification, is presented for rapidly extracting weakly\nnonlinear Hamiltonian systems that describe the dynamics near equilibria for\nsystems possessing Hamiltonian form in terms of noncanonical Poisson brackets.\nThe procedure applies to systems like fluids and plasmas in terms of Eulerian\nvariables that have such noncanonical Poisson brackets, i.e., brackets with\nnonstandard and possibly degenerate form. A collection of examples of both\nfinite and infinite dimensions is presented.\n", "  A method to extract resonance pole information from single-channel\npartial-wave amplitudes based on a Laurent (Mittag-Leffler) expansion and\nconformal mapping techniques has recently been developed. This method has been\napplied to a number of reactions and provides a model-independent extraction\nprocedure which is particularly useful in cases where a set of amplitudes is\navailable only at descrete energies. This method has been generalized and\napplied to the case of a multi-channel fit, where several sets of amplitudes\nare analysed simultaneously. The importance of unitarity constraints is\ndiscussed. The final result provides a powerful, model-independent tool for\nanalyzing partial-wave amplitudes of coupled or connected channels based\nentirely on the concepts of analyticity and unitarity.\n", "  We compare predictions from two familiar models of the metastable supercooled\nliquid respectively constructed with thermodynamic and dynamic approach. In the\nso called density functional theory (DFT) the free energy $F[\\rho]$ of the\nliquid is a functional of the inhomogeneous density $\\rho({\\bf r})$. The\nmetastable state is identified as a local minimum of $F[\\rho]$. The sharp\ndensity profile characterizing $\\rho({\\bf r})$ is identified as a single\nparticle oscillator, whose frequency is obtained from the parameters of the\noptimum density function. On the other hand, a dynamic approach to supercooled\nliquids is taken in the mode coupling theory (MCT) which predict a sharp\nergodicity-nonergodicity transition at a critical density. The single particle\ndynamics in the non-ergodic state, treated approximately, represents a\npropagating mode whose characteristic frequency is computed from the\ncorresponding memory function of the MCT. The mass localization parameters in\nthe above two models (treated in their simplest forms) are obtained\nrespectively in terms of the corresponding natural frequencies depicted and are\nshown to have comparable magnitudes.\n", "  We perform systematic investigation on the geometric, energetic and\nelectronic properties of group IV-VI binary monolayers (XY), which are the\ncounterparts of phosphorene, by employing density functional theory based\nelectronic structure calculations. For this purpose, we choose the binary\nsystems XY consisting of equal numbers of group IV (X = C, Si, Ge, Sn) and\ngroup VI elements (Y = O, S, Se, Te) in three geometrical configurations, the\npuckered, buckled and planar structures. The results of binding energy\ncalculations show that all the binary systems studied are energetically stable.\nIt is observed that, the puckered structure, similar to that of phosphorene, is\nthe energetically most stable geometric configuration. Our results of\nelectronic band structure predict that puckered SiO and CSe are direct band\nsemiconductors with gaps of 1.449 and 0.905 eV, respectively. Band structure of\nCSe closely resembles that of phosphorene. Remaining group IV-VI binary\nmonolayers in the puckered configuration and all the buckled monolayers are\nalso semiconductors, but with indirect band gaps. Importantly, we find that the\ndifference between indirect and direct band gaps is very small for many\npuckered monolayers. Thus, there is a possibility of making these systems\nundergo transition from indirect to direct band gap semiconducting state by a\nsuitable external influence. Indeed, we show in the present work that seven\nbinary monolayers namely SnS, SiSe, GeSe, SnSe, SiTe, GeTe and SnTe become\ndirect band gap semiconductors when they are subjected to a small mechanical\nstrain (<= 3 %). This makes nine out of sixteen binary monolayers studied in\nthe present work direct band gap semiconductors. Thus, there is a possibility\nof utilizing these binary counterparts of phosphorene in future light-emitting\ndiodes and solar cells.\n", "  We demonstrate a polarization-entangled photon-pair source obtained via a\ntype-II non-collinear quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process with a 10-mm periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystal,\nwhich is as stable and wavelength-tunable as the well-known Sagnac\nconfiguration scheme. A brightness of 4.2 kHz/mW is detected and a concurrence\nof 0.975 is estimated using quantum state tomography. Without loss of\nentanglement and brightness, the photon-pair wavelengths are tunable through\ncontrol of the crystal temperature. This improvement is achieved using the\nnon-collinear configuration and a stable interferometric distinguishability\ncompensator.\n", "  We present a gauged twistor model of a free massive spinning particle in\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space. This model is governed by an action, referred\nto here as the gauged generalized Shirafuji (GGS) action, that consists of\ntwistor variables, auxiliary variables, and $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ gauge fields on\nthe one-dimensional parameter space of a particle's worldline. The GGS action\nremains invariant under reparametrization and the local $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$\ntransformations of the relevant variables, although the $SU(2)$ symmetry is\nnonlinearly realized. We consider the canonical Hamiltonian formalism based on\nthe GGS action in the unitary gauge by following Dirac's recipe for constrained\nHamiltonian systems. It is shown that just sufficient constraints for the\ntwistor variables are consistently derived by virtue of the gauge symmetries of\nthe GGS action. In the subsequent quantization procedure, these constraints\nturn into simultaneous differential equations for a twistor function. We\nperform the Penrose transform of this twistor function to define a massive\nspinor field of arbitrary rank, demonstrating that the spinor field satisfies\ngeneralized Dirac-Fierz-Pauli equations with $SU(2)$ indices. We also\ninvestigate the rank-one spinor fields in detail to clarify the physical\nmeanings of the $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ symmetries.\n", "  We investigate the response of large inertial particle to turbulent\nfluctuations in a inhomogeneous and anisotropic flow. We conduct a Lagrangian\nstudy using particles both heavier and lighter than the surrounding fluid, and\nwhose diameters are comparable to the flow integral scale. Both velocity and\nacceleration correlation functions are analyzed to compute the Lagrangian\nintegral time and the acceleration time scale of such particles. The knowledge\nof how size and density affect these time scales is crucial in understanding\npartical dynamics and may permit stochastic process modelization using two-time\nmodels (for instance Saw-ford's). As particles are tracked over long times in\nthe quasi totality of a closed flow, the mean flow influences their behaviour\nand also biases the velocity time statistics, in particular the velocity\ncorrelation functions. By using a method that allows for the computation of\nturbulent velocity trajectories, we can obtain unbiased Lagrangian integral\ntime. This is particularly useful in accessing the scale separation for such\nparticles and to comparing it to the case of fluid particles in a similar\nconfiguration.\n", "  We investigate the stability of the electroweak vacuum for two-Higgs doublet\nmodels with a supersymmetric UV completion. The supersymmetry breaking scale is\ntaken to be of the order of the grand unification scale. We first study the\ncase where all superpartners decouple at this scale. We show that contrary to\nthe Standard Model with one Higgs doublet, matching to the supersymmetric UV\ncompletion is possible if the low-scale model contains two Higgs doublets. In\nthis case vacuum stability and experimental constraints point towards low\nvalues of tan(beta) < 2 and pseudoscalar masses of at least about a TeV. If the\nhiggsino superpartners of the Higgs fields are also kept light, the conclusions\nare similar and essentially independent of the higgsino mass. Finally, if all\ngauginos are also given electroweak-scale masses (split supersymmetry with two\nHiggs doublets), the model cannot be matched to supersymmetry at very high\nscales when requiring a 125 GeV Higgs. Light neutral and charged higgsinos\ntherefore emerge as a promising signature of a supersymmetric UV completion of\nthe Standard Model at the grand unification scale.\n", "  Metasurfaces, with their superior capability in manipulating the optical\nwavefront at the subwavelength scale and low manufacturing complexity, have\nshown great potential for planar photonics and novel optical devices. However,\nvector field simulation of metasurfaces is so far limited to\nperiodic-structured metasurfaces containing a small number of meta-atoms in the\nunit cell by using full-wave numerical methods. Here, we propose a general\nphenomenological method to analytically model metasurfaces made up of\narbitrarily distributed meta-atoms based on the assumption that the meta-atoms\npossess localized resonances with Lorentz-Drude forms, whose exact form can be\nretrieved from the full wave simulation of a single element. Applied to phase\nmodulated geometric metasurfaces, our analytical results show good agreement\nwith full-wave numerical simulations. The proposed theory provides an efficient\nmethod to model and design optical devices based on metasurfaces.\n", "  Recent developments in the theory of pure neutron matter and experiments\nconcerning the symmetry energy of nuclear matter, coupled with recent\nmeasurements of high-mass neutron stars, now allow for relatively tight\nconstraints on the equation of state of dense matter. We review how these\nconstraints are formulated and describe the implications they have for neutron\nstars and core-collapse supernovae. We also examine thermal properties of dense\nmatter, which are important for supernovae and neutron star mergers, but which\ncannot be nearly as well constrained at this time by experiment. In addition,\nwe consider the role of the equation of state in medium-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n", "  We apply the Landau equations, whose solutions parameterize the locus of\npossible branch points, to the one- and two-loop Feynman integrals relevant to\nMHV amplitudes in planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. We then\nidentify which of the Landau singularities appear in the symbols of the\namplitudes, and which do not. We observe that all of the symbol entries in the\ntwo-loop MHV amplitudes are already present as Landau singularities of one-loop\npentagon integrals.\n", "  Design, epitaxial growth, and resonant spectroscopy of CdSe Quantum Dots\n(QDs) embedded in an innovative (Zn,Cd)Se barrier are presented. The (Zn,Cd)Se\nbarrier enables shifting of QDs energy emission down to 1.87 eV, that is below\nthe energy of Mn$^{2+}$ ions internal transition (2.1 eV). This opens a\nperspective for implementation of epitaxial CdSe QDs doped with several Mn ions\nas, e. g., the light sources in high quantum yield magnetooptical devices.\nPolarization resolved Photoluminescence Excitation measurements of individual\nQDs reveal sharp ($\\Gamma <$ 150 $\\mu$eV) maxima and transfer of optical\npolarization to QD confining charged exciton state with efficiency attaining 26\n%. The QD doping with single Mn$^{2+}$ ions is achieved.\n", "  Quasi-periodic, fast-mode, propagating wave trains (QFPs) are a new\nobservational phenomenon recently discovered in the solar corona by the Solar\nDynamics Observatory with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging observations. They\noriginate from flares and propagate at speeds up to ~2000 km/s within\nfunnel-shaped waveguides in the wakes of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). QFPs\ncan carry sufficient energy fluxes required for coronal heating during their\noccurrences. They can provide new diagnostics for the solar corona and their\nassociated flares. We present recent observations of QFPs focusing on their\nspatio-temporal properties, temperature dependence, and statistical correlation\nwith flares and CMEs. Of particular interest is the 2010-Aug-01 C3.2 flare with\ncorrelated QFPs and drifting zebra and fiber radio bursts, which might be\ndifferent manifestations of the same fast-mode wave trains. We also discuss the\npotential roles of QFPs in accelerating and/or modulating the solar wind.\n", "  A contribution to the collection of reviews \"Introduction to Higher Spin\nTheory\" edited by S. Fredenhagen, this introductory article is a pedagogical\naccount of higher-spin fields and their connections with String Theory. We\nstart with the motivations for and a brief historical overview of the subject.\nWe discuss the Wigner classifications of unitary irreducible\nPoincar\\'e-modules, write down covariant field equations for totally symmetric\nmassive and massless representations in flat space, and consider their\nLagrangian formulation. After an elementary exposition of the AdS unitary\nrepresentations, we review the key no-go and yes-go results concerning\nhigher-spin interactions, e.g., the Velo-Zwanziger acausality and its\nstring-theoretic resolution among others. The unfolded formalism, which\nunderlies Vasiliev's equations, is then introduced to reformulate the\nflat-space Bargmann-Wigner equations and the AdS massive-scalar Klein-Gordon\nequation, and to state the \"central on-mass-shell theorem\". These techniques\nare used for deriving the unfolded form of the boundary-to-bulk propagator in\n$AdS_4$, which in turn discloses the asymptotic symmetries of (supersymmetric)\nhigher-spin theories. The implications for string-higher-spin dualities\nrevealed by this analysis are then elaborated.\n", "  Pulse compression processing based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)\nin an optical fiber is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Broadband\nmicrowave signal is electro-optically modulated onto the pump lightwave that is\nlaunched into one end of the fiber. Acoustic wave in the fiber inherits the\namplitude and phase information of the pump lightwave and thus the coupling\nbetween the acoustic wave and pump lightwave leads to the auto-correlated\nprocess of the pump lightwave as well as the modulated microwave signal.\nDerivation of the SBS coupling equations shows that the short-pulse probe\nlightwave amplified by the pump lightwave possesses the nature of\nauto-correlation formula. All-optical pulse compression of the broadband\nmicrowave signal is implemented after a subtraction between the detected probe\npulse with and without SBS. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. The\npulse compression of a linear frequency-modulated microwave signal with 1 GHz\nsweep range at the carrier frequency of 4.3 GHz is successfully realized, which\nwell matches the theoretical analysis.\n", "  We explore the properties of five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories\nliving on $5$-brane webs in orientifold $5$-plane backgrounds. This allows\nconstructing quiver gauge theories with alternating $USp(2N)$ and $SO(N)$ gauge\ngroups with fundamental matter, and thus leads to the existence of new $5d$\nfixed point theories. The web description can be further used to study\nnon-perturbative phenomena such as enhancement of symmetry and duality. We\nfurther suggest that one can use these systems to engineer $5d$ $SO$ group with\nspinor matter. We present evidence for this claim.\n", "  The nonlinear state of a high-beta collisionless plasma is investigated when\nan imposed linear shear amplifies or diminishes a uniform magnetic field,\ndriving pressure anisotropies and hence firehose/mirror instabilities. The\nevolution of the resulting microscale turbulence is considered when the shear\nis switched off or reversed after one shear time (mimicking local behaviour of\na macroscopic flow), so a new macroscale configuration is superimposed on the\nmicroscale state left behind by the previous one. There is a threshold value of\nplasma beta: when $\\beta\\ll\\Omega/S$ (ion cyclotron frequency/shear rate), the\nemergence of firehose/mirror fluctuations driven unstable by shear and their\ndisappearance when the shear is removed/reversed are quasi-instantaneous\ncompared to the shear time, viz., the decay time of these fluctuations is\n$\\sim\\beta/\\Omega \\ll 1/S$ (this result follows from the free decay of the\nfluctuations being constrained by the same marginal-stability thresholds as\ntheir growth). In contrast, when $\\beta\\gtrsim\\Omega/S$ (\"ultra-high\" beta),\nthe old microscale state can only be removed on the shear timescale. In this\nregime, driven firehose fluctuations grow secularly to order-unity amplitudes,\ncompensating for the decay of the mean field and so pinning pressure anisotropy\nat marginal stability with no appreciable scattering of particles---which is\nunlike what happens at moderate $\\beta$. When the shear reverses, the shearing\naway of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field\nand thus prevents growth of the pressure anisotropy, stopping the system from\ngoing mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to\nthe firehose threshold, the mirror instability is largely suppressed, while the\nmean magnetic energy barely changes at all. Implications for plasma dynamo and\nthus the origin of cosmic magnetism are discussed.\n", "  We have observed the magnetoelectric response at room temperature and above\nin high-resistive ceramics made of multiferroic Pb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PFN) and\nPFN-based solid solution 0.91PFN-0.09PbTiO3 (PFN-PT). The value of the\nparamagnetoelectric (PME) coefficient shows a pronounced maximum near the\nferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition temperature, T_C, and then\ndecreases sharply to zero for T>T_C. The maximal PME coefficient in PFN is\nabout 4x10(-18) s/A. The theoretical description of the PME effect, within the\nframework of a Landau theory of phase transitions allowing for realistic\ntemperature dependences of spontaneous polarization, dielectric and magnetic\nsusceptibilities, qualitatively reproduces well the temperature dependence of\nthe PME coefficient. In particular, the Landau theory predicts the significant\nincrease of the PME effect at low temperatures and near the temperature of the\nparaelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition, since the PME coefficient is\nequal to the product of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric permittivity,\nsquare of magnetic susceptibility and the coefficient quantifying the strength\nof the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling\n", "  We construct a weakly-coupled renormalizable model to explain the\n$750\\mbox{GeV}$ diphoton excess. The $750\\mbox{GeV}$ resonance (denoted as\n$X(750)$) is interpreted as a pseudoscalar coming from a complex singlet. The\nmodel also naturally provides a dark matter candidate. One most attractive\nfeature of the model is that decays of $X(750)$ are all loop-induced so the\ndiphoton rate is not diluted by unwanted tree level branching fractions.\nRelevant Yukawa interactions need not to be tuned to near non-perturbative\nregion to explain the rate. The model is highly predictive, including the\npseudoscalar nature of $X(750)$, and two nearly mass-degenerate exotic quarks\ncarrying electric charge $5/3$ and $2/3$, respectively. Rich phenomenology is\nexpected with respect to collider searches, flavor physics and dark matter\ndetection, if $X(750)$ can be pinned down by future LHC experiments.\n", "  For a many-particle system with long-range interactions and evolving under\nstochastic dynamics, we study for the first time the out-of-equilibrium\nfluctuations of the work done on the system by a time-dependent external force.\nFor equilibrium initial conditions, the work distributions for a given protocol\nof variation of the force in time and the corresponding time-reversed protocol\nexhibit a remarkable scaling and a symmetry when expressed in terms of the\naverage and the standard deviation of the work. The distributions of the work\nper particle predict, by virtue of the Crooks fluctuation theorem, the\nequilibrium free-energy density of the system. For a large number $N$ of\nparticles, the latter is in excellent agreement with the value computed by\nconsidering the Langevin dynamics of a single particle in a self-consistent\nmean field generated by its interaction with other particles. The agreement\nhighlights the effective mean-field nature of the original many-particle\ndynamics for large $N$. For initial conditions in non-equilibrium steady states\n(NESSs), we study the distribution of a quantity similar to dissipated work\nthat satisfies the non-equilibrium generalization of the Clausius inequality,\nnamely, the Hatano-Sasa equality, for transitions between NESSs. Besides\nillustrating the validity of the equality, we show that the distribution has\nexponential tails that decay differently on the left and on the right.\n", "  We consider bosonic supersymmetric backgrounds of ten-dimensional conformal\nsupergravity. Up to local conformal isometry, we classify the maximally\nsupersymmetric backgrounds, determine their conformal symmetry superalgebras\nand show how they arise as near-horizon geometries of certain half-BPS\nbackgrounds or as a plane-wave limit thereof. We then show how to define\nYang-Mills theory with rigid supersymmetry on any supersymmetric conformal\nsupergravity background and, in particular, on the maximally supersymmetric\nbackgrounds. We conclude by commenting on a striking resemblance between the\nsupersymmetric backgrounds of ten-dimensional conformal supergravity and those\nof eleven-dimensional Poincar\\'e supergravity.\n", "  The watt balance is an experiment being pursued in national metrology\ninstitutes for precision determination of the Planck constant $h$. In watt\nbalances, the $1/r$ magnetic field, expected to generate a geometrical factor\n$Bl$ independent to any coil horizontal displacement, can be created by a\nstrict two dimensional, symmetric (horizontal $r$ and vertical $z$)\nconstruction of the magnet system. In this paper, we present an analytical\nunderstanding of magnetic field distribution when the $r$ symmetry of the\nmagnet is broken and the establishment of the $Bl$ conservation is shown. By\nusing either Gauss's law on magnetism with monopoles or conformal\ntransformations, we extend the $Bl$ conservation to arbitrary two dimensional\nmagnetic planes where the vertical magnetic field component equals zero. The\ngeneralized $Bl$ conservation allows a relaxed physical alignment criteria for\nwatt balance magnet systems.\n", "  I discuss the factorization-compatible definitions of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) pion wave functions which are fundamental\ntheory inputs entering QCD factorization formulae for many hard exclusive\nprocesses. I will first demonstrate that the soft subtraction factor introduced\nto remove both rapidity and pinch singularities can be greatly reduced by\nmaking the maximal use of the freedom to construct the Wilson-line paths when\ndefining the TMD wave functions. I will then turn to show that the newly\nproposed TMD definition with non-dipolar Wilson lines is equivalent to the one\nwith dipolar gauge links and with a complicated soft function, to all orders of\nthe perturbative expansion in the strong coupling, as far as the infrared\nbehavior is concerned.\n", "  The two Higgs doublet model emerges as a minimal scenario in which to\naddress, at the same time, the $\\gamma\\gamma$ excess at 750 GeV and the lepton\nflavour violating decay into $\\tau^\\pm \\mu^\\mp $ of the 125 GeV Higgs boson.\nThe price to pay is additional matter to enhance the $\\gamma\\gamma$ rate, and a\npeculiar pattern for the lepton Yukawa couplings. We add TeV scale vector-like\nfermions and find parameter space consistent with both excesses, as well as\nwith Higgs and electroweak precision observables.\n", "  The Jarzynski equality (JE), which relates works of non-equilibrium\ntrajectories to the free energy difference of the initial and final states of\nthe non-equilibrium process, provides an efficient way to calculate free\nenergies of systems in simulations and experiments. However, wider applications\nof the JE are limited by the requirement that the initial distribution of\nnon-equilibrium trajectories must be equilibrium. Here we extend the JE to a\nmatrix form, the Jarzynski matrix equality (JME), which transforms the free\nenergies of metastable conformational regions in the initial system to that of\nfinal one. Therefore, we can calculate the free energies from non-equilibrium\ntrajectories which started from an arbitrary initial distribution. We\ndemonstrate the application of the JME in toy models, Lennard-Jones fluids, and\npolymer chain models, show its good efficiency in calculation of free energy\nwith a satisfactory accuracy. The JME extends applications of the\nnon-equilibrium method in estimate of free energy in complex system where the\ninitial global equilibrium is difficult to reach.\n", "  We propose experimental verification and theoretical explanation of magnetic\nanomalies in the complex Fe-contained double perovskite multiferroics like\nPbFe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$O$_3$. The theoretical part is based on our model of\ncoexistence of long-range magnetic order and spin glass in the above\nsubstances. In our model, the exchange interaction is anisotropic, coupling\nantiferromagnetically $z$ spin components of Fe$^{3+}$ ions. At the same time,\nthe $xy$ components are coupled by much weaker exchange interaction of\nferromagnetic sign. In the system with spatial disorder (half of corresponding\nlattice cites are occupied by spinless Nb$^{5+}$ ions) such frustrating\ninteraction results in the fact that antiferromagnetic order is formed by $z$\nprojection of the spins, while their $xy$ components contribute to spin glass\nbehaviour. Our theoretical findings are supported by the experimental evidence\nof coexistence of antiferromagnetic and spin glass phases in chemically\ndisordered Fe-contained double perovskite multiferroics.\n", "  The first LHC run has confirmed the Standard Model as the correct theory at\nthe electroweak scale, and the existence of a Higgs-like particle associated\nwith the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry. These lectures\noverview the present knowledge on the Higgs boson and discuss alternative\nscenarios of electroweak symmetry breaking which are already being constrained\nby the experimental data.\n", "  This work presents numerical results on the transport of heat and chemical\nspecies by shear-induced turbulence in strongly stratified but thermally\ndiffusive environments. The shear instabilities driven in this regime are\nsometimes called \"secular\" shear instabilities, and can take place even when\nthe gradient Richardson number of the flow (the square of the ratio of the\nbuoyancy frequency to the shearing rate) is large, provided the P\\'eclet number\n(the ratio of the thermal diffusion timescale to the turnover timescale of the\nturbulent eddies) is small. We have identified a set of simple criteria to\ndetermine whether these instabilities can take place or not. Generally\nspeaking, we find that they may be relevant whenever the thermal diffusivity of\nthe fluid is very large (typically larger than $10^{14}$cm$^2$/s), which is the\ncase in the outer layers of high-mass stars ($M\\ge 10 M_\\odot$) for instance.\nUsing a simple model setup in which the shear is forced by a spatially\nsinusoidal, constant-amplitude body-force, we have identified several regimes\nranging from effectively unstratified to very strongly stratified, each with\nits own set of dynamical properties. Unless the system is in one of the two\nextreme regimes (effectively unstratified or completely stable), however, we\nfind that (1) only about 10% of the input power is used towards heat transport,\nwhile the remaining 90% is viscously dissipated; (2) that the effective\ncompositional mixing coefficient is well-approximated by the model of Zahn\n(1992), with $D \\simeq 0.02 \\kappa_T /J$ where $\\kappa_T$ is the thermal\ndiffusivity and $J$ is the gradient Richardson number. These results need to be\nconfirmed, however, with simulations in different model setups and at higher\neffective Reynolds number.\n", "  The Bose-Einstein condensation of bound pairs made of equally and oppositely\ncharged fermions in a magnetic field is investigated using a relativistic\nmodel. The Gaussian fluctuations have been taken into account in order to study\nthe spectrum of bound pairs in the strong coupling region. We found, in weak\ncoupling reagion, the condensation temperature increases with an increasing\nmagnetic field displaying the magnetic catalysis effect. In strong coupling\nregion, the inverse magnetic catalysis appears when the magnetic field is low\nand is replaced by the usual magnetic catalysis effect when magnetic field is\nsufficiently high, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case where the inverse\nmagnetic catalysis prevails in strong coupling region regardless of the\nstrength of the magnetic field. The resulting response to the magnetic field is\nthe consequence of the competition between the dimensional reduction by Landau\norbitals in pairing dynamics and the anisotropy of the kinetic spectrum of the\nbound pairs. We thus conclude that dimensional reduction dominates in weak\ndomain and strong coupling one except the small magnetic field region, where\nthe enhanced fluctuations dominates.\n", "  We briefly report on a recent computation, with the help of a fruitful\nalgebraic model, sketching the pion valence dressed-quark generalized parton\ndistribution and, very preliminary, discuss on a possible avenue to get\nreliable results in both Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and\nEfremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage (ERBL) kinematial regions.\n", "  The logistic map is a paradigmatic dynamical system originally conceived to\nmodel the discrete-time demographic growth of a population, which shockingly,\nshows that discrete chaos can emerge from trivial low-dimensional non-linear\ndynamics. In this work, we design and characterize a simple, low-cost,\neasy-to-handle, electronic implementation of the logistic map. In particular,\nour implementation allows for straightforward circuit-modifications to behave\nas different one-dimensional discrete-time systems. Also, we design a coupling\nblock in order to address the behavior of two coupled maps, although, our\ndesign is unrestricted to the discrete-time system implementation and it can be\ngeneralized to handle coupling between many dynamical systems, as in a complex\nsystem. Our findings show that the isolated and coupled maps' behavior has a\nremarkable agreement between the experiments and the simulations, even when\nfine-tuning the parameters with a resolution of $\\sim 10^{-3}$. We support\nthese conclusions by comparing the Lyapunov exponents, periodicity of the\norbits, and phase portraits of the numerical and experimental data for a wide\nrange of coupling strengths and map's parameters.\n", "  Having in mind the well-known limitations of certain models of generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs), we show that the allegedly universal GPDs,\ndescribing both deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) and deeply virtual\nmeson production (DVMP) data, fail to describe measurements of deep inelastic\nscattering. We present a new global DVCS fit that describes reasonably the\nworld data set, which includes now also new measurements from Hall A and CLAS\ncollaborations. We also explicitly illustrate that Compton form factors (CFFs)\ncannot be unambiguously extracted from photon electroproduction measurements\noff unpolarized proton alone and we argue that it is more reliable to interpret\nsuch measurements in terms of certain CFF combinations, where still some care\nis needed in order to estimate the propagated error.\n", "  Recent experiments have demonstrated superconducting transmon qubits with\nsemiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions. These hybrid gatemon qubits utilize\nfield effect tunability characteristic for semiconductors to allow complete\nqubit control using gate voltages, potentially a technological advantage over\nconventional flux-controlled transmons. Here, we present experiments with a\ntwo-qubit gatemon circuit. We characterize qubit coherence and stability and\nuse randomized benchmarking to demonstrate single-qubit gate errors below 0.7%\nfor all gates, including voltage-controlled $Z$ rotations. We show coherent\ncapacitive coupling between two gatemons and coherent swap operations. Finally,\nwe perform a two-qubit controlled-phase gate with an estimated fidelity of 91%,\ndemonstrating the potential of gatemon qubits for building scalable quantum\nprocessors.\n", "  This paper introduces a quasiequilibrium one-dimensional Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of photons trapped in a microtube. Light modes with a cut-off\nfrequency (a photon's \"mass\") interact through different processes of\nabsorption, emission, and scattering on molecules and atoms. In this paper, we\nstudy the conditions for the one-dimensional condensation of light and the role\nof photon-photon interactions in the system. The technique in use is the\nMatsubara's Green's functions formalism modified for the quasiequilibrium\nsystem under study.\n", "  The explicit solvability of quantum superintegrable systems is due to\nsymmetry, but the symmetry is often \"hidden\". The symmetry generators of 2nd\norder superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions close under commutation to define\nquadratic algebras, a generalization of Lie algebras. Distinct systems on\nconstant curvature spaces are related by geometric limits, induced by\ngeneralized In\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner Lie algebra contractions of the symmetry algebras\nof the underlying spaces. These have physical/geometric implications, such as\nthe Askey scheme for hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. However, the limits\nhave no satisfactory Lie algebra contraction interpretations for underlying\nspaces with 1- or 0-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that these systems can be\nbest understood by transforming them to Laplace conformally superintegrable\nsystems, with flat space conformal symmetry group ${\\rm SO}(4,{\\mathbb C})$,\nand using ideas introduced in the 1894 thesis of B\\^ocher to study separable\nsolutions of the wave equation in terms of roots of quadratic forms. We show\nthat B\\^ocher's prescription for coalescing roots of these forms induces\ncontractions of the conformal algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(4,{\\mathbb C})$ to itself\nand yields a mechanism for classifying all Helmholtz superintegrable systems\nand their limits. In the paper [Acta Polytechnica, to appear,\narXiv:1510.09067], we announced our main findings. This paper provides the\nproofs and more details.\n", "  A device that achieves controllable rotation of the state of polarization by\nrotating the orientation of the eigenmodes of a waveguide by 45$^{\\circ}$ is\nintroduced and analyzed. The device can be implemented using lossless materials\non a nanoscale and helps circumvent the inherent polarization dependence of\nphotonic devices realized within the silicon on insulator platform. We propose\nand evaluate two novel polarization rotator-based schemes to achieve\npolarization engineering functions: (1) A multi-purpose device, with dimensions\non the order of a few wavelengths which can function as a polarization splitter\nor an arbitrary linear polarization state generator. (2) An energy efficient\noptical modulator that utilizes eigenmode rotation and epsilon near zero (ENZ)\neffects to achieve high extinction ratio, polarization insensitive amplitude\nmodulation without the need to sweep the device geometry to match the TE and TM\nmode attributes. By using indium tin oxide (ITO) as an example for a tunable\nmaterial, the proposed modulator provides polarization insensitive operation\nand can be realized with a modulation bandwidth of 112 GHz, a length of 1800 nm\nan energy per bit of 7.5 $fJ$ and an optical bandwidth of 210 nm.\n", "  Visible-light long baseline interferometry holds the promise of advancing a\nnumber of important applications in fundamental astronomy, including the direct\nmeasurement of the angular diameters and oblateness of stars, and the direct\nmeasurement of the orbits of binary and multiple star systems. To advance, the\nfield of visible-light interferometry requires development of instruments\ncapable of combining light from 15 baselines (6 telescopes) simultaneously. The\nVisible Imaging System for Interferometric Observations at NPOI (VISION) is a\nnew visible light beam combiner for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer\n(NPOI) that uses single-mode fibers to coherently combine light from up to six\ntelescopes simultaneously with an image-plane combination scheme. It features a\nphotometric camera for calibrations and spatial filtering from single-mode\nfibers with two Andor Ixon electron multiplying CCDs. This paper presents the\nVISION system, results of laboratory tests, and results of commissioning on-sky\nobservations. A new set of corrections have been determined for the power\nspectrum and bispectrum by taking into account non-Gaussian statistics and read\nnoise present in electron-multipying CCDs to enable measurement of visibilities\nand closure phases in the VISION post-processing pipeline. The post-processing\npipeline has been verified via new on-sky observations of the O-type supergiant\nbinary $\\zeta$ Orionis A, obtaining a flux ratio of $2.18\\pm0.13$ mag with a\nposition angle of $223.9\\pm1.0^{\\circ}$ and separation $40.6\\pm1.8$ mas over\n570-750 nm, in good agreement with expectations from the previously published\norbit.\n", "  The electronic structure of epitaxial single-layer MoS$_2$ on Au(111) is\ninvestigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling\nspectroscopy, and first principles calculations. While the band dispersion of\nthe supported single-layer is close to a free-standing layer in the vicinity of\nthe valence band maximum at $\\bar{K}$ and the calculated electronic band gap on\nAu(111) is similar to that calculated for the free-standing layer, significant\nmodifications to the band structure are observed at other points of the\ntwo-dimensional Brillouin zone: At $\\bar{\\Gamma}$, the valence band maximum has\na significantly higher binding energy than in the free MoS$_2$ layer and the\nexpected spin-degeneracy of the uppermost valence band at the $\\bar{M}$ point\ncannot be observed. These band structure changes are reproduced by the\ncalculations and can be explained by the detailed interaction of the\nout-of-plane MoS$_2$ orbitals with the substrate.\n", "  The properties of compact stars and their formation processes depend on many\nphysical ingredients. The composition and the thermodynamics of the involved\nmatter is one of them. We will investigate here uniform strongly interacting\nmatter at densities and temperatures, where potentially other components than\nfree nucleons appear such as hyperons, mesons or even quarks. In this paper we\nwill put the emphasis on two aspects of stellar matter with non-nucleonic\ndegrees of freedom. First, we will study the phase diagram of baryonic matter\nwith strangeness, showing that the onset of hyperons, as that of quark matter,\ncould be related to a very rich phase structure with a large density domain\ncovered by phase coexistence. Second, we will investigate thermal effects on\nthe equation of state (EoS), showing that they favor the appearance of\nnon-nucleonic particles. We will finish by reviewing some recent results on the\nimpact of non-nucleonic degrees freedom in compact star mergers and\ncore-collapse events, where thermal effects cannot be neglected.\n", "  A simple invisible structure made of two anisotropic homogeneous layers is\nanalyzed theoretically in temporal regime. The frequency dispersion is\nintroduced and analytic expression of the transient part of the field is\nderived for large times when the structure is illuminated by a causal\nexcitation. This expression shows that the limiting amplitude principle applies\nwith transient fields decaying as the power -3/4 of the time. The quality of\nthe cloak is then reduced at short times and remains preserved at large times.\nThe one-dimensional theoretical analysis is supplemented with full-wave\nnumerical simulations in two-dimensional situations which confirm the effect of\ndispersion.\n", "  In order to increase the thermal stability of a magnetic random access memory\n(MRAM) cell, materials with high spin-orbit interaction are often introduced in\nthe storage layer. As a side effect, a strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) may arise in such systems. Here we investigate the impact of DMI on the\nmagnetic cell performance, using micromagnetic simulations. We find that DMI\nstrongly promotes non-uniform magnetization states and non-uniform switching\nmodes of the magnetic layer. It appears to be detrimental for both the thermal\nstability of the cell and its switching current, leading to considerable\ndeterioration of the cell performance even for a moderate DMI amplitude.\n", "  The desiderata for an ideal photon source are high brightness, high\nsingle-photon purity, and high indistinguishability. Defining brightness at the\nfirst collection lens, these properties have been simultaneously demonstrated\nwith solid-state sources, however absolute source efficiencies remain close to\nthe 1% level, and indistinguishability only demonstrated for photons emitted\nconsecutively on the few nanosecond scale. Here we employ deterministic quantum\ndot-micropillar devices to demonstrate solid-state single-photon sources with\nscalable performance. In one device, an absolute brightness at the output of a\nsingle-mode fibre of 14% and purities of 97.1-99.0% are demonstrated. When\nnon-resontantly excited, it emits a long stream of photons that exhibit\nindistinguishability up to 70%---above the classical limit of 50%---even after\n33 consecutively emitted photons, a 400 ns separation between them. Resonant\nexcitation in other devices results in near-optimal indistinguishability\nvalues: 96% at short timescales, remaining at 88% in timescales as large as 463\nns, after 39 emitted photons. The performance attained by our devices brings\nsolid-state sources into a regime suitable for scalable implementations.\n", "  We propose to model hadronization of parton showers in QCD jets through a\nhybrid approach involving quark recombination and string fragmentation. This is\nachieved by allowing gluons at the end of the perturbative shower evolution to\nundergo a non-perturbative splitting into quark and antiquark pairs, then\napplying a Monte-Carlo version of instantaneous quark recombination, and\nfinally subjecting remnant quarks (those which have not found a recombination\npartner) to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to parton showers from the\nPYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator, the final hadron spectra from our\ncalculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been hadronized with\nthe default Lund string fragmentation. Our new approach opens up the\npossibility to generalize hadronization to jets embedded in a quark gluon\nplasma.\n", "  In [J. Chem. Phys. 143, 054102 (2015)] I have derived conditions to\ncharacterize the kernel of the retarded response function, under the assumption\nthat the initial state is a ground state. In this article I demonstrate its\ngeneralization to mixed states (ensembles). To make the proof work, the weights\nin the ensemble need to be decreasing for increasing energies of the pure\nstates from which the mixed state is constructed. The resulting conditions are\nnot easy to verify, but under the additional assumptions that the ensemble\nweights are directly related to the energies and that the full spectrum of the\nHamiltonian participates in the ensemble, it is shown that potentials only\nbelong to the kernel of the retarded response function if they commute with the\ninitial Hamiltonian. These additional assumptions are valid for thermodynamic\nensembles, which makes this result also physically relevant. The conditions on\nthe potentials for the thermodynamic ensembles are much stronger than in the\npure state (zero temperature) case, leading to a much less involved kernel when\nthe conditions are applied to the retarded one-body reduced density matrix\nresponse function.\n", "  Quantum mechanical objects or nanoobjects have been proposed as bits for\ninformation storage. While time-averaged properties of magnetic,\nquantum-mechanical particles have been extensively studied experimentally and\ntheoretically, experimental investigations of the real time evolution of\nmagnetization in the quantum regime were not possible until recent developments\nin pump-probe techniques. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of effective\nspin systems by means of analytical and numerical treatments. Particular\nattention is paid to the quantum revival time and its relation to the\nmagnetization tunneling. The quantum revival time has been initially defined as\nthe recurrence time of a total wave-function. Here we show that the quantum\nrevivals of wave-functions and expectation values in spin systems may be quite\ndifferent which gives rise to a more sophisticated definition of the quantum\nrevival within the realm of experimental research. Particularly, the revival\ntimes for integer spins coincide which is not the case for half-integer spins.\nFurthermore, the quantum revival is found to be shortest for integer ratios\nbetween the on-site anisotropy and an external magnetic field paving the way to\nnovel methods of anisotropy measurements. We show that the quantum tunneling of\nmagnetization at avoided level crossing is coherent to the quantum revival time\nof expectation values, leading to a connection between these two fundamental\nproperties of quantum mechanical spins.\n", "  A symmetry preserving framework for the study of continuum Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) is obtained from a truncated solution of the QCD equations\nof motion or QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs). A nonperturbative solution\nof the DSEs enables the study of, e.g., hadrons as composites of dressed-quarks\nand dressed-gluons, the phenomena of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking (DCSB), and therefrom an articulation of any connection between them.\nIt is within this context that we present a unified study of Nucleon, Delta and\nRoper elastic and transition form factors, and compare predictions made using a\nframework built upon a Faddeev equation kernel and interaction vertices that\npossess QCD-like momentum dependence with results obtained using a\nsymmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\\,\\otimes\\,$vector\ncontact-interaction.\n", "  Graphene as a two-dimensional (2D) topological Dirac semimetal has attracted\nmuch attention for its outstanding properties and potential applications.\nHowever, three-dimensional (3D) topological semimetals for carbon materials are\nstill rare. Searching for such materials with salient physics has become a new\ndirection for carbon research. Here, using first-principles calculations and\ntight-binding modeling, we study three types of 3D graphene networks whose\nproperties inherit those of Dirac electrons in graphene. In the band structures\nof these materials, two flat Weyl surfaces appear in the Brillouin zone (BZ),\nwhich straddle the Fermi level and are robust against external strain. When the\nnetworks are cut, the resulting lower-dimensional slabs and nanowires remain to\nbe semimetallic with Weyl line-like and point-like Fermi surfaces,\nrespectively. Between the Weyl lines, flat surface bands emerge with strong\nmagnetism when each surface carbon atom is passivated by one hydrogen atom. The\nrobustness of these structures can be traced back to a bulk topological\ninvariant, ensured by the sublattice symmetry, and to the one-dimensional (1D)\nWeyl semimetal behavior of the zigzag carbon chain, which has been the common\nbackbone to all these structures. The flat Weyl-surface semimetals may enable\napplications in correlated electronics, as well as in energy storage, molecular\nsieve, and catalysis because of their good stability, porous geometry, and\nlarge superficial area.\n", "  Where chiral modes should appear is an essential question for the quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) effect in three-dimensional topological insulators\n(3DTIs). In this Letter, we show that in a slab of ferromagnetic 3DTI subjected\nto a uniform exchange field normal to its top and bottom surfaces, the QAH\neffect creates a single chiral surface mode delocalized on the side faces. In a\nnonmagnetic 3DTI, analogously, delocalized helical modes consisting of a pair\nof oppositely propagating chiral surface modes are produced by the quantum spin\nHall effect.\n", "  We studied the electronic structure and optic absorption of phosphorene\n(monolayer of black phosphorus) under strain. Strain was found to be a powerful\ntool for the band structure engineering. The in-plane strain in armchair or\nzigzag direction changes the effective masse components along both directions,\nwhile the vertical strain only has significant effect on the effective mass in\nthe armchair direction. The band gap is narrowed by compressive in-plane strain\nand tensile vertical strain. Under certain strain configurations, the gap is\nclosed and the energy band evolutes to the semi-Dirac type: the dispersion is\nlinear in the armchair direction and is gapless quadratic in the zigzag\ndirection. The band-edge optic absorption is completely polarized along the\narmchair direction, and the polarization rate is reduced when the photon energy\nincreases. Strain not only changes the absorption edge, but also the absorption\npolarization.\n", "  A.G. Lebed has given an argument that when a hydrogen atom is transported\nslowly to a different gravitational potential, it has a certain probability of\nemitting a photon. He proposes a space-based experiment to detect this effect.\nI show here that his arguments also imply the existence of nuclear excitations,\nas well as an effect due to the earth's motion in the sun's potential. This is\nnot consistent with previous results from underground radiation detectors. It\nis also in conflict with astronomical observations.\n", "  Applying numerical modeling coupled with experiments, we investigate the\nproperties of wideband resonant reflectors under fully conical light incidence.\nWe show that the wave vectors pertinent to resonant first-order diffraction\nunder fully conical mounting vary less with incident angle than those\nassociated with reflectors in classical mounting. Therefore, as the evanescent\ndiffracted waves drive the leaky modes responsible for the resonance effects,\nfully-conical mounting imbues reflectors with larger angular tolerance than\ntheir classical counterparts. We quantify the angular-spectral performance of\nrepresentative resonant wideband reflectors in conic and classic mounts by\nnumerical calculations with improved spectra found for fully conic incidence.\nMoreover, these predictions are verified experimentally for wideband reflectors\nfashioned in crystalline and amorphous silicon in distinct spectral regions\nspanning the 1200-1600-nm and 1600-2400-nm spectral bands. These results will\nbe useful in various applications demanding wideband reflectors that are\nefficient and materially sparse.\n", "  We report on experimentally observed addition, subtraction and cancellation\nof orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the process of parametric four-wave mixing\nthat results in frequency up- and down-converted emission in Rb vapour.\nSpecific features of OAM transfer from resonant laser fields with different\noptical topological charges to the spatially and temporally coherent blue light\nhave been considered. We have observed the conservation of OAM in nonlinear\nwave mixing in a wide range of experimental conditions including a\nnon-collinear geometry of the applied laser beams and furthermore that the\ncoherent blue light accumulates the total orbital angular momentum of the\napplied laser light. Spectral and power dependences of vortex and plane wave\nfront blue light beams have been compared.\n", "  Spin diffusion length of Pt is evaluated via proximity effect of spin orbit\ncoupling (SOC) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Pt/Co2FeAl bilayers. By\nvarying the thicknesses of Pt and Co2FeAl layer, the thickness dependences of\nAHE parameters can be obtained, which are theoretically predicted to be\nproportional to the square of the SOC strength. According to the physical image\nof the SOC proximity effect, the spin diffusion length of Pt can easily be\nidentified from these thickness dependences. This work provides a novel method\nto evaluate spin diffusion length in a material with a small value.\n", "  We consider the noise-induced transitions in the randomly perturbed discrete\nlogistic map from a linearly stable periodic orbit consisting of T periodic\npoints. The traditional large deviation theory and asymptotic analysis for\nsmall noise limit as well as the derived quasi-potential can not distinguish\nthe quantitative difference in noise-induced stochastic instabilities of these\nT periodic points. We generalize the transition path theory to the\ndiscrete-time continuous-space stochastic process to attack this problem. As a\nfirst criterion of quantifying the relative instability among T periodic\npoints, we compare the distribution of the last passage locations in the\ntransitions from the whole periodic orbit to a prescribed set far away. This\ndistribution is related to the contributions to the transition rate from each\nperiodic points. The second criterion is based on the competency of the\ntransition paths associated with each periodic point. Both criteria utilise the\nreactive probability current in the transition path theory. Our numerical\nresults for the logistic map reveal the transition mechanism of escaping from\nthe stable periodic orbit and identify which peri- odic point is more prone to\nlose stability so as to make successful transitions under random perturbations.\n", "  One-dimensional (1D) subwavelength corrugated metal structures has been\ndescribed to support spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Here we\ndemonstrate that a modulated 1D subwavelength corrugated metal structure can\nconvert spoof SPPs to propagating waves. The structure is fed at the center\nthrough a slit with a connected waveguide on the input side. The subwavelength\ncorrugated metal structure on the output surface is regarded as metasurface and\nmodulated periodically to realize the leaky-wave radiation at the broadside.\nThe surface impedance of the corrugated metal structure is modulated by using\ncosine function and triangle-wave function, respectively, to reach the\nradiation effect. Full wave simulations and measuremental results are presented\nto validate the proposed design.\n", "  We study the intensity spatial correlation function of optical speckle\npatterns above a disordered dielectric medium in the multiple scattering\nregime. The intensity distributions are recorded by scanning near-field optical\nmicroscopy (SNOM) with sub-wavelength spatial resolution at variable distances\nfrom the surface in a range which spans continuously from the near-field\n(distance $ \\ll \\lambda $) to the far-field regime (distance $\\gg \\lambda $).\nThe non-universal behavior at sub-wavelength distances reveals the connection\nbetween the near-field speckle pattern and the internal structure of the\nmedium.\n", "  We investigate spontaneous emission of a two-level atom with an arbitrarily\npolarized electric dipole in front of a flat dielectric surface. We treat the\ngeneral case where the atomic dipole matrix element is a complex vector, that\nis, the atomic dipole can rotate with time in space. We calculate the rates of\nspontaneous emission into evanescent and radiation modes and study the angular\ndensities of the rates in the space of wave vectors for the field modes. We\nshow that, when the ellipticity of the atomic dipole is not zero, the angular\ndensity of the spontaneous emission rate of the atom may have different values\nfor modes with opposite in-plane wave vectors. We find that this asymmetry of\nthe angular density of the spontaneous emission rate under central inversion in\nthe space of in-plane wave vectors is a result of spin-orbit coupling of light\nand occurs when the ellipticity vector of the atomic dipole polarization\noverlaps with the ellipticity vector of the field mode polarization. Due to the\nfast decay of the field in the evanescent modes, the difference between the\nrates of spontaneous emission into evanescent modes with opposite in-plane wave\nvectors decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the atom to the\ninterface. Due to the oscillatory behavior of the interference between the\nemitted and reflected fields, the difference between the rates of spontaneous\nemission into radiation modes with opposite in-plane wave vectors oscillates\nwith increasing distance from the atom to the interface. This difference can be\npositive or negative, depending on the atom-interface distance, and is zero for\nthe zero distance.\n", "  We present the structural and magnetic properties of a new compound family,\nMg$_2$RE$_3$Sb$_3$O$_{14}$ (RE = Gd, Dy, Er), with a hitherto unstudied\nfrustrating lattice, the \"tripod kagome\" structure. Susceptibility (ac, dc) and\nspecific heat exhibit features that are understood within a simple\nLuttinger-Tisza type theory. For RE = Gd, we found long ranged order (LRO) at\n1.65 K, which is consistent with a 120 $^{\\circ}$ structure, demonstrating the\nimportance of diople interactions for this 2D Heisenberg system. For RE = Dy,\nLRO at 0.37 K is related to the \"kagome spin ice (KSI)\" physics for a 2D\nsystem. This result shows that the tripod kagome structure accelerates the\ntransition to LRO predicted for the related pyrochlore systems. For RE = Er,\ntwo transitions, at 80 mK and 2.1 K are observed, suggesting the importance of\nquantum fluctuations for this putative XY system.\n", "  Using holographic duality, we present results for both head-on and off-center\ncollisions of Gaussian shock waves in strongly coupled $\\mathcal N = 4$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The shock waves superficially resemble\nLorentz contracted colliding protons. The collisions results in the formation\nof a plasma whose evolution is well described by viscous hydrodynamics. The\nsize of the produced droplet is $R \\sim 1/T_{\\rm eff}$ where $T_{\\rm eff}$ is\nthe effective temperature, which is the characteristic microscopic scale in\nstrongly coupled plasma. These results demonstrate the applicability of\nhydrodynamics to microscopically small systems and bolster the notion that\nhydrodynamics can be applied to heavy-light ion collisions as well as some\nproton-proton collisions.\n", "  A high-energy Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would offer a most promising tool\nto study in detail the transverse momentum distributions of gluons inside\nhadrons. This applies to unpolarized as well as linearly polarized gluons\ninside unpolarized protons, and to left-right asymmetric distributions of\ngluons inside transversely polarized protons, the so-called gluon Sivers\neffect. The inherent process dependence of these distributions can be studied\nby comparing to similar, but often complementary observables at LHC.\n", "  We study coherent phonon oscillations and tunneling between two coupled\nnonlinear nanomechanical resonators. We show that the coupling between two\nnanomechanical resonators creates an effective phonon Josephson junction which\nexhibits two different dynamical behaviors: Josephson oscillation (phonon-Rabi\noscillation) and macroscopic self-trapping (phonon blockade). Self-trapping\noriginates from mechanical nonlinearities, meaning that when the nonlinearity\nexceeds its critical value, the energy exchange between the two resonators is\nsuppressed, and phonon-Josephson oscillations between them are completely\nblocked. An effective classical Hamiltonian for the phonon Josephson junction\nis derived and its mean-field dynamics is studied in phase space. Finally, we\nstudy the phonon-phonon coherence quantified by the mean fringe visibility, and\nshow that the interaction between the two resonators may lead to the loss of\ncoherence in the phononic junction.\n", "  S. Brodsky, F.J. Llanes-Estrada, and A. Szczepaniak formulated the $J=0$\nfixed pole universality hypothesis for (deeply) virtual Compton scattering. We\nshow that in the Bjorken limit this hypothesis is equivalent to the validity of\nthe inverse moment sum rule for the $D$-term form factor. However, any\nsupplementary $D$-term added to a generalized parton distribution (GPD) results\nin an additional $J=0$ fixed pole contribution that violates universality.\nUnfortunately, one can not provide any reliable theoretical argument excluding\nthe existence of such supplementary $D$-term. Moreover, the violation of $J=0$\nfixed pole universality was revealed in field theoretical GPD models.\nTherefore, $J=0$ fixed pole universality hypothesis remains just an external\nassumption and probably will never be proven theoretically.\n", "  We present a new approach of back gate patterning that is compatible with the\nrequirements of highest mobility molecular beam epitaxy. Contrary to common\nback gating techniques, our method is simple, reliable and can be scaled up for\nentire wafers. The back gate structures are defined by local oxygen\nimplantation into a silicon doped GaAs epilayer, which suppresses the\nconductance without affecting the surface quality.\n", "  A new opacity model based on the Super-Transition-Array (STA) method for the\ncalculation of monochromatic opacities of local thermodynamic equilibrium\nplasmas, was developed. The atomic code, named STAR (STA-Revised), is described\nand used to calculate spectral opacities for a solar model implementing the\nrecent AGSS09 composition. Calculations are carried throughout the solar\nradiative zone. The relative contributions of different chemical elements and\natomic processes to the total Rosseland mean opacity are analyzed in detail.\nMonochromatic opacities and charge state distributions were compared with the\nwidely used Opacity-Project (OP) code, for several elements near the\nradiation-convection interface. STAR Rosseland opacities for the solar mixture\nshow a very good agreement with OP and the OPAL opacity code, throughout the\nradiation zone. Finally, an explicit STA calculation of the full AGSS09\nphotospheric mixture, including all heavy metals was performed. It was shown\nthat due to their extremely low abundance, and despite being very good photon\nabsorbers, the heavy elements do not affect the Rosseland opacity.\n", "  The canonical energy-momentum tensor is often considered as a purely academic\nobject because of its gauge dependence. However, it has recently been realized\nthat canonical quantities can in fact be defined in a gauge-invariant way\nprovided that strict locality is abandoned, the non-local aspect being\ndictacted in high-energy physics by the factorization theorems. Using the\ngeneral techniques for the parametrization of non-local parton correlators, we\nprovide for the first time a complete parametrization of the energy-momentum\ntensor (generalizing the purely local parametrizations of Ji and\nBakker-Leader-Trueman used for the kinetic energy-momentum tensor) and identify\nexplicitly the parts accessible from measurable two-parton distribution\nfunctions (TMDs and GPDs). As by-products, we confirm the absence of\nmodel-independent relations between TMDs and parton orbital angular momentum,\nrecover in a much simpler way the Burkardt sum rule and derive three similar\nnew sum rules expressing the conservation of transverse momentum.\n", "  We discuss the relation between the trivial light-front vacuum and the\nnon-trivial Heisenberg vacuum.\n", "  Whispering gallery mode microdisk cavities fabricated by direct laser writing\nare studied using dark-field imaging and spectroscopy in the visible spectral\nrange. {Dark-field imaging allows us to directly visualize the spatial\nintensity distribution of whispering gallery modes. We extract their azimuthal\nand radial mode indices from dark-field images, and find the axial mode number\nfrom the dispersion relation. The scattering spectrum obtained in the confocal\narrangement provides information on the density of optical states in the\nresonator. The proposed technique is a simple non-invasive way to characterize\nthe optical properties of microdisk cavities.\n", "  We demonstrate that in-plane charge current can effectively control the spin\nprecession resonance in an Al2O3/CoFeB/Ta heterostructure. Brillouin Light\nScattering (BLS) was used to detect the ferromagnetic resonance field under\nmicrowave excitation of spin waves at fixed frequencies. The current control of\nspin precession resonance originates from modification of the in-plane uniaxial\nmagnetic anisotropy field H_k, which changes symmetrically with respect to the\ncurrent direction. Numerical simulation suggests that the anisotropic stress\nintroduced by Joule heating plays an important role in controlling H_k. These\nresults provide new insights into current manipulation of magnetic properties\nand have broad implications for spintronic devices.\n", "  A small amount of Fe (5% and 7.5%) substitution in the Cr-site of the\nmultiferroic compound CoCr2O4 leads to a magnetization reversal. In these\ncompounds, we report a sign change in the exchange bias across the compensation\ntemperature, accompanied by a non-monotonic change in the local moments across\nthe compensation temperature. Such non-monotonic change in the magnetic moments\nis triggered by a similar change in the lattice structure. We relate here the\nsign change of exchange bias with that of the crystalline energy of the lattice\nand the Zeeman energy term arising from the anti-site disorder.\n", "  Transient dynamics are of large interest in many areas of science. Here, a\ngeneralization of basin stability (BS) is presented: constrained basin\nstability (CBS) that is sensitive to various different types of transients\narising from finite size perturbations. CBS is applied to the paradigmatic\nLorenz system for uncovering nonlinear precursory phenomena of a boundary\ncrisis bifurcation. Further, CBS is used in a model of the Earth's carbon cycle\nas a return time-dependent stability measure of the system's global attractor.\nBoth case studies illustrate how CBS's sensitivity to transients complements BS\nin its function as an early warning signal and as a stability measure. CBS is\nbroadly applicable in systems where transients matter, from physics and\nengineering to sustainability science. Thus, CBS complements stability analysis\nwith BS as well as classical linear stability analysis and will be a useful\ntool for many applications.\n", "  We report on efficient nonlinear generation of ultrafast, higher order\n\"perfect\" vortices at the green wavelength. Based on Fourier transformation of\nthe higher order Bessel-Gauss beam generated through the combination of spiral\nphase plate and axicon we have transformed the Gaussian beam of the ultrafast\nYb-fiber laser at 1060 nm into perfect vortices of power 4.4 W and order up to\n6. Using single-pass second harmonic generation (SHG) of such vortices in 5-mm\nlong chirped MgO-doped, periodically poled congruent LiNbO$_3$ crystal we have\ngenerated perfect vortices at green wavelength with output power of 1.2 W and\nvortex order up to 12 at single-pass conversion efficiency of 27% independent\nof its order. This is the highest single-pass SHG efficiency of any optical\nbeams other than Gaussian beams. Unlike the disintegration of higher order\nvortices in birefringent crystals, here, the use of quasi-phase matching\nprocess enables generation of high quality vortices even at higher orders. The\ngreen perfect vortices of all orders have temporal and spectral width of 507 fs\nand 1.9 nm, respectively corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 1.02.\n", "  We present synthetic ALMA observations of Keplerian, protostellar discs in\nthe Class 0 stage studying the emission of molecular tracers like $^{13}$CO,\nC$^{18}$O, HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and H$_2$CO. We model the\nemission of discs around low- and intermediate-mass protostars. We show that\nunder optimal observing conditions ALMA is able to detect the discs already in\nthe earliest stage of protostellar evolution, although the emission is often\nconcentrated to the innermost 50 AU. Therefore, a resolution of a few 0.1\"\nmight be too low to detect Keplerian discs around Class 0 objects. We also\ndemonstrate that under optimal conditions for edge-on discs Keplerian rotation\nsignatures are recognisable, from which protostellar masses can be inferred.\nFor this we here introduce a new approach, which allows us to determine\nprotostellar masses with higher fidelity than before. Furthermore, we show that\nit is possible to reveal Keplerian rotation even for strongly inclined discs\nand that ALMA should be able to detect possible signs of fragmentation in\nface-on discs. In order to give some guidance for future ALMA observations, we\ninvestigate the influence of varying observing conditions and source distances.\nWe show that it is possible to probe Keplerian rotation in inclined discs with\nan observing time of 2 h and a resolution of 0.1\", even in the case of moderate\nweather conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under optimal conditions,\nKeplerian discs around intermediate-mass protostars should be detectable up to\nkpc-distances.\n", "  External passive femtosecond enhancement cavities (fsECs) are widely used to\nincrease the efficiency of non-linear conversion processes like high harmonic\ngeneration (HHG) at high repetition rates. Their performance is often limited\nby beam ellipticity, caused by oblique incidence on spherical focusing mirrors.\nWe introduce a novel three-dimensionally folded variant of the typical planar\nbow-tie resonator geometry that guarantees circular beam profiles, maintains\nlinear polarization, and allows for a significantly tighter focus as well as a\nlarger beam cross-section on the cavity mirrors. The scheme is applied to\nimprove focusing in a Ti:Sapphire based VUV frequency comb system, targeting\nthe 5th harmonic around 160 nm (7.8 eV) towards high-precision spectroscopy of\nthe low-energy isomer state of Thorium-229. It will also be beneficial in\nfsEC-applications with even higher seeding and intracavity power where the\ndamage threshold of the mirrors becomes a major concern.\n", "  It is argued that the recent Belle data, consistent with no activity in the\nspectrum of the $B^* \\bar B + B \\bar B^*$ pairs at the mass of the $Z_b(10650)$\nresonance, imply that the part of the interaction between heavy mesons that\ndepends on the total spin of the light quark and antiquark is strongly\nsuppressed. In particular this part appears to be significantly weaker than can\nbe inferred from pion exchange. If confirmed by future more detailed data, the\nsymmetry with respect to the light quark spins, in combination with the heavy\nquark spin symmetry, would imply existence of four additional $I^G=1^-$\nresonances at the thresholds for heavy meson-antimeson pairs.\n", "  We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process with Langmuir kinetics on\na periodic lattice. We analytically obtain the exact time evolution of\ncorrelation functions with arbitrary length starting from the initial state\nwith no particle in the system. The exact stationary state of this model has\nbeen known for the totally asymmetric case. We propose a basis transformation\nwhich simplifies the proof of the stationarity of this state and enables the\ngeneralization to the partially asymmetric case. Moreover, we construct\nlow-energy excitations and obtain the exact relaxation time.\n", "  We present a scheme to controllably improve the accuracy of tight-binding\nHamiltonian matrices derived by projecting the solutions of plane-wave ab\ninitio calculations on atomic orbital basis sets. By systematically increasing\nthe completeness of the basis set of atomic orbitals, we are able to optimize\nthe quality of the band structure interpolation over wide energy ranges\nincluding unoccupied states. This methodology is applied to the case of\ninterlayer and image states, which appear several eV above the Fermi level in\nmaterials with large interstitial regions or surfaces such as graphite and\ngraphene. Due to their spatial localization in the empty regions inside or\noutside of the system, these states have been inaccessible to traditional\ntight-binding models and even to ab initio calculations with atom-centered\nbasis functions.\n", "  The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, $\\eta/s$, is computed in\nvarious holographic geometries that break translation invariance (but are\nisotropic). The shear viscosity does not have a hydrodynamic interpretation in\nsuch backgrounds, but does quantify the rate of entropy production due to a\nstrain. Fluctuations of the metric components $\\delta g_{xy}$ are massive about\nthese backgrounds, leading to $\\eta/s < 1/(4\\pi)$ at all finite temperatures\n(even in Einstein gravity). As the temperature is taken to zero, different\nbehaviors are possible. If translation symmetry breaking is irrelevant in the\nfar IR, then $\\eta/s$ tends to a constant at $T=0$. This constant can be\nparametrically small. If the translation symmetry is broken in the far IR\n(which nonetheless develops emergent scale invariance), then $\\eta/s \\sim T^{2\n\\nu}$ as $T \\to 0$, with $\\nu \\leq 1$ in all cases we have considered. While\nthese results violate simple bounds on $\\eta/s$, we note that they are\nconsistent with a possible bound on the rate of entropy production due to\nstrain.\n", "  We demonstrate that a three-terminal harmonic symmetric chain in the presence\nof a Coriolis force, produced by a rotating platform which is used to place the\nchain, can produce thermal rectification. The direction of heat flow is\nreconfigurable and controlled by the angular velocity $\\Omega$ of the rotating\nplatform. A simple three terminal triangular lattice is used to demonstrate the\nproposed principle.\n", "  NIKA2 (New IRAM KID Array 2) is a camera dedicated to millimeter wave\nastronomy based upon kilopixel arrays of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID).\nThe pathfinder instrument, NIKA, has already shown state-of-the-art detector\nperformance. NIKA2 builds upon this experience but goes one step further,\nincreasing the total pixel count by a factor $\\sim$10 while maintaining the\nsame per pixel performance. For the next decade, this camera will be the\nresident photometric instrument of the Institut de Radio Astronomie\nMillimetrique (IRAM) 30m telescope in Sierra Nevada (Spain). In this paper we\ngive an overview of the main components of NIKA2, and describe the achieved\ndetector performance. The camera has been permanently installed at the IRAM 30m\ntelescope in October 2015. It will be made accessible to the scientific\ncommunity at the end of 2016, after a one-year commissioning period. When this\nhappens, NIKA2 will become a fundamental tool for astronomers worldwide.\n", "  Heavy quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) play an important role in\nseveral Standard Model and New Physics processes. Most analyses rely on the\nassumption that the charm and bottom PDFs are generated perturbatively by gluon\nsplitting and do not involve any non-perturbative degrees of freedom. On the\nother hand, non- perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark parton distributions have\nbeen predicted in the literature. We demonstrate that to a very good\napproximation the scale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the\nnucleon is governed by non-singlet evolution equations. This allows to analyze\nthe intrinsic heavy quark distributions without having to resort to a\nfull-fledged global analysis of parton distribution functions. We exploit this\nfreedom to model intrinsic bottom distributions which are so far missing in the\nliterature. We estimate the impact of the non-perturbative contribution to the\ncharm and bottom-quark PDFs and on several important parton-parton luminosities\nat the LHC.\n", "  Accurate and integrable control of different flows within microfluidic\nchannels is crucial to further development of lab-on-a-chip and fully\nintegrated adaptable structures. Here we introduce a flexible microactuator\nthat buckles at a high deformation rate and alters the downstream fluid flow.\nThe microactuator consists of a confined, thin, dielectric film that buckles\ninto the microfluidic channel when exposed to voltage supplied through\nconductive fluid electrodes. We estimate the critical buckling voltage, and\ncharacterize the buckled shape of the actuator. Finally, we investigate the\neffects of frequency, flow rate, and the pressure differences on the behavior\nof the buckling structure and the resulting fluid flow. These results\ndemonstrate that the voltage--induced buckling of embedded microstructures\nusing fluid electrodes provides a means for high speed attenuation of\nmicrofluidic flow.\n", "  Non-interacting systems with bounded disorder have been shown to exhibit\nsharp density of states peaks at the band edge which coincide with an energy\nrange of abruptly suppressed localization. Recent work has shown that these\nfeatures also occur in the presence of on-site interactions in ensembles of\ntwo-site Anderson-Hubbard systems at half filling. Here we demonstrate that\nthis effect in interacting systems persists away from half filling, and\nmoreover that energy regions with suppressed localization continue to appear in\nensembles of larger systems despite a loss of sharp features in the density of\nstates.\n", "  With the goal of constructing the supersymmetric action for all fields,\nmassless and massive, obtained by Kaluza-Klein compactification from type II\ntheory or M-theory in a closed form, we embed the (Abelian) tensor hierarchy of\np-forms in four-dimensional, N=1 superspace and construct its Chern-Simons-like\ninvariants. When specialized to the case in which the tensors arise from a\nhigher-dimensional theory, the invariants may be interpreted as\nhigher-dimensional Chern-Simons forms reduced to four dimensions. As an\napplication of the formalism, we construct the eleven-dimensional Chern-Simons\nform in terms of four-dimensional, N=1 superfields.\n", "  We study the thermoelectric properties of a double-Weyl fermion system,\npossibly realized in $\\mathrm{HgCr_2Se_4}$ and $\\mathrm{SrSi_2}$, by a\nsemi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We investigate different relaxation\nprocesses including short-range disorder and electron-electron interaction on\nthe thermoelectric transport coefficients. It is found that the anisotropy of\nthe band dispersion for in-plane and out-of-plane momentum directions affects\nthe relaxation time for transport in different directions. The transport also\nexhibits an interesting directional dependence on the chemical potential and\nmodel parameters, differing from a simple isotropic quadratic or linearly\ndispersing electron gas. By applying a static magnetic field along the linearly\ndispersing direction, the longitudinal and transverse electrical and thermal\nmagnetoconductivity show a similar dependence on the in-plane cyclotron\nfrequency to the linear dispersing Weyl nodes. By including internode\nscattering, we find that the chiral anomaly contribution to the thermoelectric\ncoefficients doubles that of a linearly dispersing Weyl node in both the\nsemi-classical and quantum regimes. A magnetic field applied along the\nquadratically dispersing direction will split the double Weyl point into two\nsingle Weyl points with the same chirality.\n", "  We investigate the existence of multiple turbulent states in highly turbulent\nTaylor-Couette flow in the range of $\\mathrm{Ta}=10^{11}$ to $9\\cdot10^{12}$,\nby measuring the global torques and the local velocities while probing the\nphase space spanned by the rotation rates of the inner and outer cylinder. The\nmultiple states are found to be very robust and are expected to persist beyond\n$\\mathrm{Ta}=10^{13}$. The rotation ratio is the parameter that most strongly\ncontrols the transitions between the flow states; the transitional values only\nweakly depend on the Taylor number. However, complex paths in the phase space\nare necessary to unlock the full region of multiple states. Lastly, by mapping\nthe flow structures for various rotation ratios in a Taylor-Couette setup with\nan equal radius ratio but a larger aspect ratio than before, multiple states\nwere again observed. Here, they are characterized by even richer roll structure\nphenomena, including, for the first time observed in highly turbulent TC flow,\nan antisymmetrical roll state.\n", "  To study meson properties, one needs to solve the gap equation for the quark\npropagator and the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation for the meson wavefunction,\nself-consistently. The gluon propagator, the quark-gluon vertex, and the\nquark--anti-quark scattering kernel are key pieces to solve those equations.\nPredicted by lattice-QCD and Dyson-Schwinger analyses of QCD's gauge sector,\ngluons are non-perturbatively massive. In the matter sector, the modeled gluon\npropagator which can produce a veracious description of meson properties needs\nto possess a mass scale, accordingly. Solving the well-known longitudinal\nWard-Green-Takahashi identities (WGTIs) and the less-known transverse\ncounterparts together, one obtains a nontrivial solution which can shed light\non the structure of the quark-gluon vertex. It is highlighted that the\nphenomenologically proposed anomalous chromomagnetic moment (ACM) vertex\noriginates from the QCD Lagrangian symmetries and its strength is proportional\nto the magnitude of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). The\ncolor-singlet vector and axial-vector WGTIs can relate the BS kernel and the\ndressed quark-gluon vertex to each other. Using the relation, one can truncate\nthe gap equation and the BS equation, systematically, without violating crucial\nsymmetries, e.g., gauge symmetry and chiral symmetry.\n", "  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT) are\nemerging non-invasive biological and medical imaging techniques. It is a recent\ntrend in experimental science to design experiments that perform PAT and OCT\nimaging at once. In this paper we present a mathematical model describing the\ndual experiment.\n  Since OCT is mathematically modelled by Maxwell's equations or some\nsimplifications of it, whereas the light propagation in quantitative\nphotoacoustics is modelled by (simplifications of) the radiative transfer\nequation, the first step in the derivation of a mathematical model of the dual\nexperiment is to obtain a unified mathematical description, which in our case\nare Maxwell's equations. As a by-product we therefore derive a new mathematical\nmodel of photoacoustic tomography based on Maxwell's equations.\n  It is well known by now, that without additional assumptions on the medium,\nit is not possible to uniquely reconstruct all optical parameters from either\none of these modalities alone. We show that in the combined approach one has\nadditional information, compared to a single modality, and the inverse problem\nof reconstruction of the optical parameters becomes feasible.\n", "  We use local Cartesian simulations with a vertical gravitational potential to\nstudy how supernova (SN) feedback in stratified galactic discs drives\nturbulence and launches galactic winds. Our analysis includes three disc models\nwith gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich\nultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes\n(random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics\nof SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We find that,\nin these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low\nmass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ~3-7 km/s and low wind mass\nloading factors < 1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and\nwind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are\nsignificantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly\nstar-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc\ngalaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests\nand analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the\nproperties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global\ngeometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors\nare in fact not well-defined in local simulations because they decline\nsignificantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic\ncalculations (e.g., including a global galactic potential and disc rotation)\nwill likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic\noutflows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.\n", "  One of the most fundamental properties of isotropic negative-index\nmetamaterials, namely opposite directionality of the Poynting vector and the\nwavevector, enable many novel linear and nonlinear regimes of light-matter\ninteractions. Here, we predict distinct characteristics of azimuthal modulation\ninstability of optical vortices with different topological charges in\nnegative-index metamaterials with Kerr-type and saturable nonlinearity. We\nderive an analytical expression for the spatial modulation-instability gain for\nthe Kerr-nonlinearity case and show that a specific condition relating the\ndiffraction and the nonlinear lengths must be fulfilled for the azimuthal\nmodulation instability to occur. Finally, we investigate the rotation of the\nnecklace beams due to the transfer of orbital angular momentum of the\ngenerating vortex on the movement of solitary necklace beams. We show that the\ndirection of rotation is opposite in positive- and negative-index materials.\n", "  We report the generation of narrow-linewidth 637.2 nm laser by single-pass\nsum-frequency generation (SFG) of two infrared lasers at 1560.5 nm and 1076.9\nnm in PPMgO:LN crystal. Over 8.75 W of single-frequency continuously tunable\n637.2 nm laser is realized, and corresponding conversion efficiency is 38%. We\nstudy the behavior of crystals with different poling periods. The detailed\nexperiments show that the output red lasers have very good power stability and\nbeam quality. This high-performance 637.2 nm laser is significant for the\nrealization of high power ultra-violet (UV) 318.6 nm laser via cavity-enhanced\nfrequency doubling. Narrow-linewidth 318.6 nm laser is important for Rydberg\nexcitation of cesium atoms via single-photon transition.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations recently recorded possible di-photon excess\nat 750 GeV and a less significant di-boson excess around 1.9 TeV. Such excesses\nmay be produced in heterotic-string derived Z' models, where the di-photon\nexcess may be connected with the Standard Model singlet scalar responsible for\nthe Z' symmetry breaking, whereas the di-boson excess arises from production of\nthe extra vector boson. Additional vector-like states in the string Z' model\nare instrumental to explain the relatively large width of the di-photon events\nand mandated by anomaly cancellation to be in the vicinity of the Z' breaking\nscale. Wilson line breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetries in the string\nmodels naturally gives rise to dark matter candidates. Future collider\nexperiments will discriminate between the high-scale heterotic-string models,\nwhich preserve the perturbative unification paradigm indicated by the Standard\nModel data, versus the low scale string models. We also discuss the possibility\nfor the production of the di-photon events with high scale $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$\nbreaking.\n", "  An interesting test of Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) relies on the\nobserved lag in arrival times of photons emitted from extragalactic transient\nsources. Attributing the lag between photons of different energies to the\ngravitational potential of the Milky Way (MW), several authors derive new\nconstraints on deviations from EEP. It is shown here that potential\nfluctuations from the large scale structure are at least two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the gravitational potential of the MW. Combined with the\nlarger distances, for sources at redshift $z\\gtsim 0.5$ the {\\it rms} of the\ncontribution from these fluctuations exceeds the MW by more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude. We provide actual constraints for several objects based on a\nstatistical calculation of the large scale fluctuations in the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.\n", "  We investigate the order-by-order convergence behavior of many-body\nperturbation theory (MBPT) as a simple and efficient tool to approximate the\nground-state energy of closed-shell nuclei. To address the convergence\nproperties directly, we explore perturbative corrections up to 30th order and\nhighlight the role of the partitioning for convergence. The use of a simple\nHartree-Fock solution to construct the unperturbed basis leads to a convergent\nMBPT series for soft interactions, in contrast to, e.g., a harmonic oscillator\nbasis. For larger model spaces and heavier nuclei, where a direct high-order\nMBPT calculation in not feasible, we perform third-order calculation and\ncompare to advanced ab initio coupled-cluster calculations for the same\ninteractions and model spaces. We demonstrate that third-order MBPT provides\nground-state energies for nuclei up into tin isotopic chain that are in\nexcellent agreement with the best available coupled-cluster results at a\nfraction of the computational cost.\n", "  We investigate the ability of jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to break\nout of the ambient gas with sufficiently large advance velocities. Using\nobservationally estimated jet power, we analyze 28 bright elliptical galaxies\nin nearby galaxy clusters. Because the gas density profiles in the innermost\nregions of galaxies have not been resolved so far, we consider two extreme\ncases for temperature and density profiles. We also follow two types of\nevolution for the jet cocoons: being driven by the pressure inside the cocoon\n(Fanaroff-Riley [FR] I type), and being driven by the jet momentum (FR II\ntype). Our main result is that regardless of the assumed form of density\nprofiles, jets with observed powers of <~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are not powerful\nenough to evolve as FR II sources. Instead, they evolve as FR I sources and\nappear to be decelerated below the buoyant velocities of the cocoons when jets\nwere propagating through the central dense regions of the host galaxies. This\nexplains the reason why FR I sources are more frequent than FR II sources in\nclusters. Furthermore, we predict the sizes of X-ray cavities from the observed\njet powers and compare them with the observed ones --- they are consistent\nwithin a factor of two if the FR I type evolution is realized. Finally, we find\nthat the jets with a power >~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are less affected by the\nambient medium, and some of them, but not all, could serve as precursors of the\nFR II sources.\n", "  When a research infrastructure is funded and implemented, new information and\nnew publications are created. This new information is the measurable output of\ndiscovery process. In this paper, we describe the impact of infrastructure for\nphysics experiments in terms of publications and citations. In particular, we\nconsider the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb)\nand compare them to the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) experiments\n(ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, OPAL) and the Tevatron experiments (CDF, D0). We provide an\noverview of the scientific output of these projects over time and highlight the\nrole played by remarkable project results in the publication-citation\ndistribution trends. The methodological and technical contribution of this work\nprovides a starting point for the development of a theoretical model of modern\nscientific knowledge propagation over time.\n", "  Quantifying coherence is an essential endeavour for both quantum foundations\nand quantum technologies. Here the robustness of coherence is defined and\nproven a full monotone in the context of the recently introduced resource\ntheories of quantum coherence. The measure is shown to be observable, as it can\nbe recast as the expectation value of a coherence witness operator for any\nquantum state. The robustness of coherence is evaluated analytically on\nrelevant classes of states, and an efficient semidefinite program that computes\nit on general states is given. An operational interpretation is finally\nprovided: the robustness of coherence quantifies the advantage enabled by a\nquantum state in a phase-discrimination task.\n", "  Quantum states may exhibit asymmetry with respect to the action of a given\ngroup. Such an asymmetry of states can be considered as a resource in\napplications such as quantum metrology, and it is a concept that encompasses\nquantum coherence as a special case. We introduce explicitly and study the\nrobustness of asymmetry, a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to\nhave many attractive properties, including efficient numerical computability\nvia semidefinite programming, and an operational interpretation in a channel\ndiscrimination context. We also introduce the notion of asymmetry witnesses,\nwhose measurement in a laboratory detects the presence of asymmetry. We prove\nthat properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the\nrobustness of asymmetry, which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity\nitself. We then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness\nof coherence, for which we prove a number of additional results; these include\nan analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum\nmetrology, an analytical calculation of its value for a relevant class of\nquantum states, and tight bounds that relate it to another previously defined\ncoherence monotone.\n", "  We present a theoretical and experimental analysis of the elliptical-like\norbits of a marble rolling on a warped spandex fabric. We arrive at an\nexpression describing the angular separation between successive apocenters, or\nequivalently successive pericenters, in both the small and large slope regimes.\nWe find that a minimal angular separation of approximately 197 degrees is\npredicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a\ncentral mass. We then show that for small radii and large central masses, when\nthe orbiting marble is deep within the well, the angular separation between\nsuccessive apocenters transitions to values greater than 360 degrees. We lastly\ncompare these expressions to those describing elliptical-like orbits about a\nstatic, spherically symmetric massive object in the presence of a constant\nvacuum energy, as described by general relativity.\n", "  Nonequilibrium thermodynamics (NET) investigates processes in systems out of\nglobal equilibrium. On a mesoscopic level, it provides a statistical dynamic\ndescription of various complex phenomena such as chemical reactions, ion\ntransport, diffusion, thermochemical, thermomechanical and mechanochemical\nfluxes. In the present review, we introduce a mesoscopic stochastic formulation\nof NET by analyzing entropy production in several simple examples. The\nfundamental role of nonequilibrium steady-state cycle kinetics is emphasized.\nThe statistical mechanics of Onsager's reciprocal relations in this context is\nelucidated. Chemomechanical, thermomechanical, and enzyme-catalyzed\nthermochemical energy transduction processes are discussed. It is argued that\nmesoscopic stochastic NET provides a rigorous mathematical basis of fundamental\nconcepts needed for understanding complex processes in chemistry, physics and\nbiology, and which is also relevant for nanoscale technological advances.\n", "  The action of finite BMS and Weyl transformations on the gravitational data\nat null infinity is worked out in three and four dimensions in the case of an\narbitrary conformal factor for the boundary metric induced on Scri.\n", "  We theoretically consider the effect of a spatially periodic modulation of\nthe superconducting order parameter on the formation of Majorana fermions\ninduced by a one-dimensional system with magnetic impurities brought into close\nproximity to an $s$-wave superconductor. When the magnetic exchange energy is\nlarger than the inter-impurity electron hopping we model the effective system\nas a chain of coupled Shiba states. While in the opposite regime, the effective\nsystem is accurately described by a quantum wire model. Upon including a\nspatially modulated superconducting pairing, we find, for sufficiently large\nmagnetic exchange energy, the system is able to support a single pair of\nMajorana fermions with one Majorana fermion on the left end of the system and\none on the right end. When the modulation of superconductivity is large\ncompared to the magnetic exchange energy, the Shiba chain returns to a\ntrivially gapped regime while the quantum wire enters a new topological phase\ncapable of supporting two pairs of Majorana fermions.\n", "  We investigate the large-time scaling regimes arising from a variety of\nmetastable structures in a chain of Ising spins with both first- and\nsecond-neighbor couplings while subject to a Kawasaki dynamics. Depending on\nthe ratio and sign of these former, different dynamic exponents are suggested\nby finite-size scaling analyses of relaxation times. At low but\nnonzero-temperatures these are calculated via exact diagonalizations of the\nevolution operator in finite chains under several activation barriers. In the\nabsence of metastability the dynamics is always diffusive.\n", "  We report a Lagrangian study on the evolution of material surfaces in the\nK-type temporal transitional channel flow. Based on the Eulerian velocity field\nfrom the DNS, a backward-particle-tracking method is applied to solve the\ntransport equation of the Lagrangian scalar field, and then the iso-surfaces of\nthe Lagrangian field can be extracted as material surfaces in the evolution.\nThree critical issues for Lagrangian investigations on the evolution of\ncoherent structures using material surfaces are addressed. First, the initial\nscalar field is uniquely determined based on proposed criteria, so that the\ninitial material surfaces can be approximated as vortex surfaces, and keep\ninvariant in the initial laminar state. Second, the evolution of typical\nmaterial surfaces initially from different wall distances is presented, and\nthen the influential material surface with the maximum deformation is\nidentified. Large vorticity variations with the maximum curvature growth of\nvortex lines are also observed on this surface. Moreover, crucial events in the\ntransition can be characterized in a Lagrangian approach by conditional\nstatistics on the material surfaces. Finally, the influential material surface,\nwhich is initially a vortex surface, is demonstrated as a surrogate of the\nvortex surface before significant topological changes of vortical structures.\nTherefore, this material surface can be used to elucidate the continuous\nevolution of vortical structures in transitional wall-bounded flows in a\nLagrangian perspective. The evolution of the influential material surface is\ndivided into three stages: the formation of a triangular bulge from an\ninitially disturbed streamwise-spanwise sheet, rolling up of the vortex sheet\nnear the bulge ridges with the vorticity intensification, and the generation\nand evolution of signature hairpin-like structures with self-induced dynamics\nof vortex filaments.\n", "  A phase of strong interacting matter with deconfined quarks is expected in\nthe core of massive neutron stars. We investigate the quark deconfinement phase\ntransition in cold (T = 0) and hot beta-stable hadronic matter. Assuming a\nfirst order phase transition, we calculate and compare the nucleation rate and\nthe nucleation time due to quantum and thermal nucleation mechanisms. We show\nthat above a threshold value of the central pressure a pure hadronic star (HS)\n(i.e. a compact star with no fraction of deconfined quark matter) is metastable\nto the conversion to a quark star (QS) (i.e. a hybrid star or a strange star).\nThis process liberates an enormous amount of energy, of the order of\n10^{53}~erg, which causes a powerful neutrino burst, likely accompanied by\nintense gravitational waves emission, and possibly by a second delayed (with\nrespect to the supernova explosion forming the HS) explosion which could be the\nenergy source of a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB). This stellar conversion\nprocess populates the QS branch of compact stars, thus one has in the Universe\ntwo coexisting families of compact stars: pure hadronic stars and quark stars.\nWe introduce the concept of critical mass M_{cr} for cold HSs and\nproto-hadronic stars (PHSs), and the concept of limiting conversion temperature\nfor PHSs. We show that PHSs with a mass M < M_{cr} could survive the early\nstages of their evolution without decaying to QSs. Finally, we discuss the\npossible evolutionary paths of proto-hadronic stars.\n", "  Classical optomechanical systems feature self-sustained oscillations, where\nmultiple periodic orbits at different amplitudes coexist. We study how this\nmultistability is realized in the quantum regime, where new dynamical patterns\nappear because quantum trajectories can move between different classical\norbits. We explain the resulting quantum dynamics from the phase space point of\nview, and provide a quantitative description in terms of autocorrelation\nfunctions. In this way we can identify clear dynamical signatures of the\ncrossover from classical to quantum mechanics in experimentally accessible\nquantities. Finally, we discuss a possible interpretation of our results in the\nsense that quantum mechanics protects optomechanical systems against the\nchaotic dynamics realized in the classical limit.\n", "  We present measurements of the orientation $\\theta_0$ and temperature\namplitude $\\delta$ of the large-scale circulation in a cylindrical sample of\nturbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) with aspect ratio $\\Gamma \\equiv D/L\n= 1.00$ ($D$ and $L$ are the diameter and height respectively) and for the\nPrandtl number $Pr \\simeq 0.8$. Results for $\\theta_0$ revealed a preferred\norientation with upflow in the West, consistent with a broken azimuthal\ninvariance due to Earth's Coriolis force [see \\cite{BA06b}]. They yielded the\nazimuthal diffusivity $D_\\theta$ and a corresponding Reynolds number\n$Re_{\\theta}$ for Rayleigh numbers over the range $2\\times 10^{12} < Ra <\n1.5\\times 10^{14}$. In the classical state ($Ra < 2\\times 10^{13}$) the results\nwere consistent with the measurements by \\cite{BA06a} for $Ra < 10^{11}$ and\n$Pr = 4.38$ which gave $Re_{\\theta} \\propto Ra^{0.28}$, and with the\nPrandtl-number dependence $Re_{\\theta} \\propto Pr^{-1.2}$ as found previously\nalso for the velocity-fluctuation Reynolds number $Re_V$ \\cite[]{HGBA15b}. At\nlarger $Ra$ the data for $Re_{\\theta}(Ra)$ revealed a transition to a new\nstate, known as the \"ultimate\" state, which was first seen in the Nusselt\nnumber $Nu(Ra)$ and in $Re_V(Ra)$ at $Ra^*_1 \\simeq 2\\times 10^{13}$ and\n$Ra^*_2 \\simeq 8\\times 10^{13}$. In the ultimate state we found $Re_{\\theta}\n\\propto Ra^{0.40\\pm 0.03}$.\n  Recently \\cite{SU15} claimed that non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects on the\nNusselt and Reynolds numbers of turbulent RBC may have been interpreted\nerroneously as a transition to a new state. We demonstrate that their reasoning\nis incorrect and that the transition observed in the G\\\"ottingen experiments\nand discussed in the present paper is indeed to a new state of RBC referred to\nas \"ultimate\".\n", "  Superfluid vortices in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of dense quark\nmatter are known to be energetically disfavored relative to well-separated\ntriplets of \"semi-superfluid\" color flux tubes. However, the short-range\ninteraction (metastable versus unstable) has not been established. In this\npaper we perform numerical calculations using the effective theory of the\ncondensate field, mapping the regions in the parameter space of coupling\nconstants where the vortices are metastable versus unstable. For the case of\nzero gauge coupling we analytically identify a candidate for the unstable mode,\nand show that it agrees well with the results of the numerical calculations. We\nfind that in the region of the parameter space that seems likely to correspond\nto real-world CFL quark matter the vortices are unstable, indicating that if\nsuch matter exists in neutron star cores it is very likely to contain\nsemi-superfluid color flux tubes rather than superfluid vortices.\n", "  The mixing of a passive scalar like lithium, beryllium or temperature\nfluctuations due to the magnetic Tayler instability of a rotating axial pinch\nis considered. Our study is carried out within a Taylor-Couette setup for two\nrotation laws: quasi-Kepler and solid-body rotation. The minimum magnetic\nPrandtl number used is 0.05 while the molecular Schmidt number Sc of the fluid\nvaries between 0.1 and 2. An effective diffusivity coefficient for the mixing\nis numerically measured by the decay process of a global concentration peak\nlocated between the cylinder walls. We find that only models with Sc>0.1 do\nprovide finite eddy diffusivity values. We also find that for quasi-Kepler\nrotation at a magnetic Mach number Mm~2 the flow transits from the\nslow-rotation regime to the fast-rotation regime. For fixed Reynolds number the\nrelation between the normalized eddy diffusivity and the Schmidt number of the\nfluid is always linear so that also a linear relation between the\ninstability-induced diffusivity and the molecular viscosity results just in the\nsense proposed by Schatzman (1977). The numerical value of the coefficient in\nthis relation will reach a maximum at Mm~2 and will decrease for Mm>>1 implying\nthat only toroidal magnetic fields of order kG can exist in the solar\ntachocline.\n", "  We describe a method for disentangling giant component and finite cluster\ncontributions to sparse random matrix spectra, using sparse symmetric random\nmatrices defined on Erdos-Renyi graphs as an example and test-bed.\n", "  The relic density of TeV-scale wino-like neutralino dark matter in the MSSM\nis subject to potentially large corrections as a result of the Sommerfeld\neffect. A recently developed framework enables us to calculate the\nSommerfeld-enhanced relic density in general MSSM scenarios, properly treating\nmixed states and multiple co-annihilating channels as well as including\noff-diagonal contributions. Using this framework, including on-shell one-loop\nmass splittings and running couplings and taking into account the latest\nexperimental constraints, we perform a thorough study of the regions of\nparameter space surrounding the well known pure-wino scenario: namely the\neffect of sfermion masses being non-decoupled and of allowing non-negligible\nHiggsino or bino components in the lightest neutralino. We further perform an\ninvestigation into the effect of thermal corrections and show that these can\nsafely be neglected. The results reveal a number of phenomenologically\ninteresting but so far unexplored regions where the Sommerfeld effect is\nsizeable. We find, in particular, that the relic density can agree with\nexperiment for dominantly wino neutralino dark matter with masses ranging from\n1.7 to beyond 4 TeV. In light of these results the bounds from Indirect\nDetection on wino-like dark matter should be revisited.\n", "  A high efficiency method for the generation of correlated photon pairs\naccompanied by a reliable means to characterize the efficiency of that process\nis needed in the study of correlated photon pairs and entangled states\ninvolving more than three photons, which have important potential applications\nin quantum information and quantum communication. In this study, we report the\nfirst characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon\npairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance\nhyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method\nof generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the\ngeneration efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs\nusing this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the\nphoton counting rate and coincidence counting rate under resonant excitation.\nThe excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the\nphoton counting rates changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the\nexcitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions\nfrom correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting\nsignals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon\ncounting rate and coincidence counting rate simultaneously, and improve the\ncoincidence counting rate by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in\nprevious work [K. Edamatsu $\\it{et\\ al}$. Nature $\\bf{431}$, 167-170 (2004)].\nThe analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is\nproduced by a pump pulse with $2 \\times 10^6$ photons. Moreover, the generation\nefficiency of this method is improved by a factor of $10^7$ compared to that of\nseveral methods based on the $\\chi^{(3)}$ parametric process.\n", "  We propose an experimental scheme to simulate the many-body dynamical quantum\nHall effect with ultra-cold bosonic atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice.\nWe first show that the required model Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nchain with an effective magnetic field and tunable parameters can be realized\nin this system. For dynamical response to ramping the external fields, the\nquantized plateaus emerge in the Berry curvature of the interacting atomic spin\nchain as a function of the effective spin-exchange interaction. The\nquantization of this response in the parameter space with the\ninteraction-induced topological transition characterizes the many-body\ndynamical quantum Hall effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phenomenon\ncan be observed in practical cold-atom experiments with numerical simulations.\n", "  We discuss a possibility to explain the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed at\nthe LHC in a three-loop neutrino mass model which has a similar structure to\nthe model by Krauss, Nasri and Trodden. Tiny neutrino masses are naturally\ngenerated by the loop effect of new particles with their couplings and masses\nto be of order 0.1-1 and TeV, respectively. The lightest right-handed neutrino,\nwhich runs in the three-loop diagram, can be a dark matter candidate. In\naddition, the deviation in the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment from its prediction in the standard model can be compensated by one-loop\ndiagrams with exotic multi-charged leptons and scalar bosons. For the diphoton\nevent, an additional isospin singlet real scalar field plays the role to\nexplain the excess by taking its mass of 750 GeV, where it is produced from the\ngluon fusion production via the mixing with the standard model like Higgs\nboson. We find that the cross section of the diphoton process can be obtained\nto be a few fb level by taking the masses of new charged particles to be about\n375 GeV and related coupling constants to be order 1.\n", "  The CMS collaboration has reported a 2.8$\\sigma$ excess in the search of the\nSU(2)$_R$ gauge bosons decaying through right-handed neutrinos into the two\nelectron plus two jets ($eejj$) final states. This can be explained if the\nSU(2)$_R$ charged gauge bosons $W_R^\\pm$ have a mass of around 2 TeV and a\nright-handed neutrino with a mass of ${\\cal O}(1)$ TeV mainly decays to\nelectron. Indeed, recent results in several other experiments, especially that\nfrom the ATLAS diboson resonance search, also indicate signatures of such a 2\nTeV gauge boson. However, a lack of the same-sign electron events in the CMS\n$eejj$ search challenges the interpretation of the right-handed neutrino as a\nMajorana fermion. Taking this situation into account, in this paper, we\nconsider a possibility of explaining the CMS $eejj$ excess based on the\n$SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory with pseudo-Dirac\nneutrinos. We find that both the CMS excess events and the ATLAS diboson\nanomaly can actually be explained in this framework without conflicting with\nthe current experimental bounds. This setup in general allows sizable\nleft-right mixing in both the charged gauge boson and neutrino sectors, which\nenables us to probe this model through the trilepton plus missing-energy search\nat the LHC. It turns out that the number of events in this channel predicted in\nour model is in good agreement with that observed by the CMS collaboration. We\nalso discuss prospects for testing this model at the LHC Run-II experiments.\n", "  In general, non-minimal models of the dark sector such as Dynamical Dark\nMatter posit the existence of an ensemble of individual dark components with\ndiffering masses, cosmological abundances, and couplings to the Standard Model.\nPerhaps the most critical among these features is the spectrum of masses, as\nthis goes a long way towards determining the cosmological abundances and\nlifetimes of the corresponding states. Many different underlying theoretical\nstructures can be imagined for the dark sector, each giving rise to its own\nmass spectrum and corresponding density of states. In this paper, by contrast,\nwe investigate the spectrum of masses that emerges statistically from\nunderlying processes which are essentially random. We find a density of states\n$n(m)$ which decreases as a function of mass and actually has an upper limit\n$m_{\\rm max}$ beyond which $n(m)=0$. We also demonstrate that this \"emergent\"\ndensity of states is particularly auspicious from the perspective of the\nDynamical Dark Matter framework, leading to cosmological abundances and decay\nwidths that are suitably balanced against each other across the dark-matter\nensemble. Thus randomness in the dark sector coexists quite naturally with\nDynamical Dark Matter, and we examine the prospects for observing the signals\nof such scenarios in dark-matter indirect-detection experiments.\n", "  We report on efficient generation of second harmonic laser and single-mode\nvacuum squeezed light of 795 nm with periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP)\ncrystals. We achieved 111 mW of ultra-violet (UV) light at 397.5 nm from 191 mW\nof fundamental light with a PPKTP crystal in a doubling cavity, corresponding\nto a conversion efficiency of 58.1%. Using the UV light to pump an optical\nparametric oscillator with a PPKTP crystal, we realized -5.6 dB of a maximum\nsqueezing. We analyzed the pump power dependence of the squeezing level and\nconcluded that the UV light induced losses limit the improvement of the\nsqueezing level. The generated squeezed light has huge potential application in\nquantum memory and ultra-precise measurement.\n", "  We employ a self-consistent simulation approach based on quantum physics here\nto study the magnetism of antiferromagnetic skyrmions formed on manolayer\nnanodisk planes. We find that if the disk is small and the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya\n(DM) interaction is weak, a single magnetic vortex may be formed on the disk\nplane. In such a case, when uniaxial anisotropy normal to the disk plane is\nfurther considered, the magnetic configuration remains unchanged, but the\nmagnetization is enhanced in that direction, and reduced in other two\nperpendicular orientations. Very similarly, a weak external magnetic field\nnormal to the disk plane cannot obviously affect the spin structure of the\nnanodisk; however, when it is sufficiently strong, it can destroy the AFM\nskyrmion completely. On the other hand, by increasing DM interaction so that\nthe disk diameter is a few times larger than the DM length, more self-organized\nmagnetic domains, such as vortices and strips, will be formed in the disk\nplane. They evolve with decreasing temperature, however always symmetric about\na geometric axis of the square unit cell. We further find that in this case\nintroducing normal magnetic anisotropy gives rise to the re-construction of AFM\nsingle-vortex structure or skyrmion on the disk plane, which provides a way to\ncreate and/or stabilize such spin texture in experiment.\n", "  We show that it is possible to measure polarization with a polarimeter that\ngets rid of the seeing while still measuring at a frequency well below that of\nthe seeing. We study a standard polarimeter made of two retarders and a\nbeamsplitter. The retarders are modulated at $\\sim 500$ Hz, a frequency\ncomparable to that of the variations of the refraction index in the Earth\natmosphere, what is usually termed as seeing in astronomical observations.\nHowever, we assume that the camera is slow, so that our measurements are time\nintegrations of these modulated signals. In order to recover the time variation\nof the seeing and obtain the Stokes parameters, we use the theory of compressed\nsensing to solve the demodulation by impose a sparsity constraint on the\nFourier coefficients of the seeing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this\nsub-Nyquist polarimeter using numerical simulations, both in the case without\nnoise and with noise. We show that a sensible modulation scheme is obtained by\nrandomly changing the fast axis of the modulators or their retardances in\nspecific ways. We finally demonstrate that the value of the Stokes parameters\ncan be recovered with great precision at almost maximum efficiency, although it\nslightly degrades when the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations increase,\na consequence of the multiplexing under the presence of photon noise.\n", "  The present contribution summarizes the content and slightly updates the\ndiscussion of a recently proposed theoretical analysis of the halo phenomenon\nin many-fermion systems. We focus here on applications to potential neutron\nhalos in mid-mass nuclei.\n", "  A set of theoretical mass-radius relations for rigidly rotating neutron stars\nwith exotic cores, obtained in various theories of dense matter, is reviewed.\nTwo basic observational constraints are used: the largest measured rotation\nfrequency (716 Hz) and the maximum measured mass ($2\\;M_\\odot$). Present status\nof measuring the radii of neutron stars is described. The theory of rigidly\nrotating stars in general relativity is reviewed and limitations of the slow\nrotation approximation are pointed out. Mass-radius relations for rotating\nneutron stars with hyperon and quark cores are illustrated using several\nmodels. Problems related to the non-uniqueness of the crust-core matching are\nmentioned. Limits on rigid rotation resulting from the mass-shedding\ninstability and the instability with respect to the axisymmetric perturbations\nare summarized. The problem of instabilities and of the back-bending phenomenon\nare discussed in detail. Metastability and instability of a neutron star core\nin the case of a first-order phase transition, both between pure phases, and\ninto a mixed-phase state, are reviewed. The case of two disjoint families\n(branches) of rotating neutron stars is discussed and generic features of\nneutron-star families and of core-quakes triggered by the instabilities are\nconsidered.\n", "  The dependence of the turnover frequency on the linear size is presented for\na sample of GPS and CSS radio sources derived from complete samples. The\ndependence of the luminosity of the emission at the peak frequency with the\nlinear size and the peak frequency is also presented for the galaxies in the\nsample. The luminosity of the smaller sources evolve strongly with the linear\nsize. Optical depth effects have been included to the 3D model for the radio\nsource of Kaiser (2000) to study the spectral turnover. Using this model, the\nobserved trend can be explained by synchrotron self absorption. The observed\ntrend in the peak-frequency -- linear-size plane is not affected by the\nluminosity evolution of the sources.\n", "  We present a new color-selection technique, based on the Bruzual & Charlot\nmodels convolved with the bands of the ALHAMBRA survey, and the redshifted\nposition of the Balmer jump to select star-forming galaxies in the redshift\nrange 0.5 < z < 1.5. These galaxies are dubbed Balmer jump Galaxies BJGs. We\napply the iSEDfit Bayesian approach to fit each detailed SED and determine\nstar-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, age and absolute magnitudes. The mass\nof the haloes where these samples reside are found via a clustering analysis.\nFive volume-limited BJG sub-samples with different mean redshifts are found to\nreside in haloes of median masses $\\sim 10^{12.5 \\pm 0.2} M_\\odot$ slightly\nincreasing toward z=0.5. This increment is similar to numerical simulations\nresults which suggests that we are tracing the evolution of an evolving\npopulation of haloes as they grow to reach a mass of $\\sim 10^{12.7 \\pm 0.1}\nM_\\odot$ at z=0.5. The likely progenitors of our samples at z$\\sim$3 are Lyman\nBreak Galaxies, which at z$\\sim$2 would evolve into star-forming BzK galaxies,\nand their descendants in the local Universe are elliptical galaxies.Hence, this\nallows us to follow the putative evolution of the SFR, stellar mass and age of\nthese galaxies. From z$\\sim$1.0 to z$\\sim$0.5, the stellar mass of the volume\nlimited BJG samples nearly does not change with redshift, suggesting that major\nmergers play a minor role on the evolution of these galaxies. The SFR evolution\naccounts for the small variations of stellar mass, suggesting that star\nformation and possible minor mergers are the main channels of mass assembly.\n", "  When planet-hosting stars evolve off the main sequence and go through the\nred-giant branch, the stars become orders of magnitudes more luminous and, at\nthe same time, lose mass at much higher rates than their main-sequence\ncounterparts. Accordingly, if planetary companions exist around these stars at\norbital distances of a few AU, they will be heated up to the level of canonical\nhot Jupiters and also be subjected to a dense stellar wind. Given that\nmagnetized planets interacting with stellar winds emit radio waves, such\n\"Red-Giant Hot Jupiters\" (RGHJs) may also be candidate radio emitters. We\nestimate the spectral auroral radio intensity of RGHJs based on the empirical\nrelation with the stellar wind as well as a proposed scaling for planetary\nmagnetic fields. RGHJs might be intrinsically as bright as or brighter than\ncanonical hot Jupiters and about 100 times brighter than equivalent objects\naround main-sequence stars. We examine the capabilities of low-frequency radio\nobservatories to detect this emission and find that the signal from an RGHJ may\nbe detectable at distances up to a few hundred parsecs with the Square\nKilometer Array.\n", "  The longstanding problem of characterization of the $0^+_2$ states in Gd\nisotopes is revisited by adopting the Nilsson$+$BCS mean field and the\nrandom-phase approximation. The interband electric quadrupole transition\nstrengths varying almost two orders of magnitude are nicely reproduced at the\nsame time as other observables. These results indicate that the $0^+_2$ states,\nin particular, those in lighter isotopes are well described as $\\beta$\nvibrations excited on top of deformed ground states without recourse to the\nshape-coexistence picture.\n", "  In this paper I show that simulations of reionization performed under the\nCosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project do converge in space and mass,\nalbeit rather slowly. A fully converged solution (for a given star formation\nand feedback model) can be determined at a level of precision of about 20%, but\nsuch a solution is useless in practice, since achieving it in production-grade\nsimulations would require a large set of runs at various mass and spatial\nresolutions, and computational resources for such an undertaking are not yet\nreadily available.\n  In order to make progress in the interim, I introduce a weak convergence\ncorrection factor in the star formation recipe, which allows one to approximate\nthe fully converged solution with finite resolution simulations. The accuracy\nof weakly converged simulations approaches a comparable, ~20% level of\nprecision for star formation histories of individual galactic halos and other\ngalactic properties that are directly related to star formation rates, like\nstellar masses and metallicities. Yet other properties of model galaxies, for\nexample, their HI masses, are recovered in the weakly converged runs only\nwithin a factor of two.\n", "  QCD evolution equations in minimal subtraction schemes have a hidden\nsymmetry: One can construct three operators that commute with the evolution\nkernel and form an $SL(2)$ algebra, i.e. they satisfy (exactly) the $SL(2)$\ncommutation relations. In this paper we find explicit expressions for these\noperators to two-loop accuracy going over to QCD in non-integer $d=4-2\\epsilon$\nspace-time dimensions at the intermediate stage. In this way conformal symmetry\nof QCD is restored on quantum level at the specially chosen (critical) value of\nthe coupling, and at the same time the theory is regularized allowing one to\nuse the standard renormalization procedure for the relevant Feynman diagrams.\nQuantum corrections to conformal generators in $d=4-2\\epsilon$ effectively\ncorrespond to the conformal symmetry breaking in the physical theory in four\ndimensions and the $SL(2)$ commutation relations lead to nontrivial constraints\non the renormalization group equations for composite operators. This approach\nis valid to all orders in perturbation theory and the result includes\nautomatically all terms that can be identified as due to a nonvanishing QCD\n$\\beta$-function (in the physical theory in four dimensions). Our result can be\nused to derive three-loop evolution equations for flavor-nonsinglet\nquark-antiquark operators including mixing with the operators containing total\nderivatives. These equations govern, e.g., the scale dependence of generalized\nhadron parton distributions and light-cone meson distribution amplitudes.\n", "  $Ni_{50-x}Co_{x}Mn_{40}Sn_{10}$ shape memory alloys in the approximate range\n$5 \\le x \\le 10$ display desirable properties for applications as well as\nintriguing magnetism. These off-stoichiometric Heusler alloys undergo a\nmartensitic phase transformation at a temperature $T_{M}$ of 300 - 400 K, from\nferromagnetic (F) to nonferromagnetic, with unusually low thermal hysteresis\nand a large change in magnetization. The low temperature magnetic structures in\nthe martensitic phase of such alloys, which are distinctly inhomogeneous, are\nof great interest but are not well understood. Our present use of spin echo\nNMR, in the large hyperfine fields at $^{55}Mn$ sites, provides compelling\nevidence that nanoscale magnetic phase separation into F and antiferromagnetic\n(AF) regions occurs below $T_{M}$ in alloys with x in the range 0 to 7. At\nfinite Co substitution the F regions are found to be of two distinct types,\ncorresponding to high and low local concentrations of Co on Ni sites. Estimates\nof the size distributions of both the F and AF nanoregions have been made. At x\n= 7 the AF component is not long-range ordered, even below 4 K, and is quite\ndifferent to the AF component found at x = 0; by x = 14 the F phase is\ncompletely dominant. Of particular interest, we find, for x = 7, that field\ncooling leads to dramatic changes in the AF regions. These findings provide\ninsight into the origins of magnetic phase separation and superparamagnetism in\nthese complex alloys, particularly their intrinsic exchange bias, which is of\nconsiderable current interest.\n", "  In this manuscript we introduced the generalized fractional Riemann-Liouville\nand Caputo like derivative for functions defined on fractal sets. The Gamma,\nMittag-Leffler and Beta functions were defined on the fractal sets. The\nnon-local Laplace transformation is given and applied for solving linear and\nnon-linear fractal equations. The advantage of using these new nonlocal\nderivatives on fractals subset of real-line lies in the fact that they are used\nfor better modelling of processes with memory effect.\n", "  We look for predictive flavour patterns of the effective Majorana neutrino\nmass matrix that are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data. Our\nsearch is based on the assumption that the neutrino mass matrix contains equal\nelements and a minimal number of parameters, in the flavour basis where the\ncharged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and real. Three unique patterns that can\nsuccessfully explain neutrino observables at the $3\\sigma$ confidence level\nwith just three physical parameters are presented. Neutrino textures described\nby four and five parameters are also studied. The predictions for the lightest\nneutrino mass, the effective mass parameter in neutrinoless double beta decays\nand the CP-violating phases in the leptonic mixing are given.\n", "  We report development of a simple and affordable radio interferometer\nsuitable as an educational laboratory experiment. With the increasing\nimportance of interferometry in astronomy, the lack of educational\ninterferometers is an obstacle to training the future generation of\nastronomers. This interferometer provides the hands-on experience needed to\nfully understand the basic concepts of interferometry. The design of this\ninterferometer is based on the Michelson & Pease stellar optical\ninterferometer, but operates at a radio wavelength (~11 GHz; ~2.7cm); thus the\nrequirement for optical accuracy is much less stringent. We utilize a\ncommercial broadcast satellite dish and feedhorn. Two flat side mirrors slide\non a ladder, providing baseline coverage. This interferometer resolves and\nmeasures the diameter of the Sun, a nice daytime experiment which can be\ncarried out even in marginal weather (i.e., partial cloud cover). Commercial\nbroadcast satellites provide convenient point sources for comparison to the\nSun's extended disk. We describe the mathematical background of the adding\ninterferometer, the design and development of the telescope and receiver\nsystem, and measurements of the Sun. We present results from a students'\nlaboratory report.\n", "  Light-Front Quantization provides a physical, frame-independent formalism for\nhadron dynamics and structure. Observables such as structure functions,\ntransverse momentum distributions, and distribution amplitudes are defined from\nthe hadronic light-front wavefunctions. One obtains new insights into the\nhadronic spectrum, light-front wavefunctions, and the functional form of the\nQCD running coupling in the nonperturbative domain using light-front holography\n-- the duality between the front form and AdS$_5$, the space of isometries of\nthe conformal group. In addition, superconformal algebra leads to remarkable\nsupersymmetric relations between mesons and baryons of the same parity. The\nmass scale $\\kappa$ underlying confinement and hadron masses can be connected\nto the parameter $\\Lambda_{\\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD running coupling by\nmatching the nonperturbative dynamics, as described by the effective conformal\ntheory mapped to the light-front and its embedding in AdS space, to the\nperturbative QCD regime. The result is an effective coupling defined at all\nmomenta. This matching of the high and low momentum transfer regimes determines\na scale $Q_0$ which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative\nhadron dynamics. The use of $Q_0$ to resolve the factorization scale\nuncertainty for structure functions and distribution amplitudes, in combination\nwith the principle of maximal conformality (PMC) for setting the\nrenormalization scales, can greatly improve the precision of perturbative QCD\npredictions for collider phenomenology. The absence of vacuum excitations of\nthe front-form vacuum has important consequences for the cosmological constant.\nI also discuss evidence that the antishadowing of nuclear structure functions\nis flavor dependent, and why shadowing and antishadowing phenomena may be\nincompatible with sum rules for nuclear parton distribution functions.\n", "  The results of transportation infrastructure network analyses have been used\nto analyze complex networks in a topological context. However, most modeling\napproaches, including those based on complex network theory, do not fully\naccount for real-life traffic patterns and may provide an incomplete view of\nnetwork functions. This study utilizes trip data obtained from the Beijing\nSubway System to characterize individual passenger movement patterns. A\ndirected weighted passenger flow network was constructed from the subway\ninfrastructure network topology by incorporating trip data. The passenger flow\nnetworks exhibit several properties that can be characterized by power-law\ndistributions based on flow size, and log-logistic distributions based on the\nfraction of boarding and departing passengers. The study also characterizes the\ntemporal patterns of in-transit and waiting passengers and provides a\nhierarchical clustering structure for passenger flows. This hierarchical flow\norganization varies in the spatial domain. Ten cluster groups were identified,\nindicating a hierarchical urban polycentric structure composed of large\nconcentrated flows at urban activity centers. These empirical findings provide\ninsights regarding urban human mobility patterns within a large subway network.\n", "  Light-matter momentum transfer in plasmonic materials is theoretically\ndiscussed in the framework of plasmonic pressure mechanism taking into account\nnon-equilibrium electron dynamics and thermalization process. We show that our\napproach explains the experimentally observed relationship between the\nplasmon-related electromotive force and absorption and allows one to correctly\npredict the magnitude of the plasmon drag emf in flat metal films. We extend\nour theory to metal films with modulated profiles and show that the simple\nrelationship between plasmonic energy and momentum transfer holds at relatively\nsmall amplitudes of height modulation and an approximation of laminar electron\ndrift. Theoretical groundwork is laid for further investigations of\nshape-controlled plasmon drag in nanostructured metal.\n", "  A relation between the conformal anomaly and the logarithmic term in the\nentanglement entropy is known to exist for CFT's in even dimensions. In odd\ndimensions the local anomaly and the logarithmic term in the entropy are\nabsent. As was observed recently, there exists a non-trivial integrated anomaly\nif an odd-dimensional spacetime has boundaries. We show that, similarly, there\nexists a logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy when the entangling\nsurface crosses the boundary of spacetime. The relation of the entanglement\nentropy to the integrated conformal anomaly is elaborated for three-dimensional\ntheories. Distributional properties of intrinsic and extrinsic geometries of\nthe boundary in the presence of conical singularities in the bulk are\nestablished. This allows one to find contributions to the entropy that depend\non the relative angle between the boundary and the entangling surface.\n", "  We report progress on nuclear structure functions, especially on their\nnuclear modifications and a new tensor structure function for the deuteron. To\nunderstand nuclear structure functions is an important step toward describing\nnuclei and QCD matters from low to high densities and from low to high energies\nin terms of fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom beyond conventional\nhadron and nuclear physics. It is also practically important for understanding\nnew phenomena in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Furthermore,\nsince systematic errors of current neutrino-oscillation experiments are\ndominated by uncertainties of neutrino-nucleus interactions, such studies are\nvaluable for finding new physics beyond current framework. Next, a new\ntensor-polarized structure function $b_1$ is discussed for the deuteron. There\nwas a measurement by HERMES; however, its data are inconsistent with the\nconventional convolution estimate based on the standard deuteron model with\nD-state admixture. This fact suggests that a new hadronic phenomenon should\nexist in the tensor-polarized deuteron at high energies, and it will be\nexperimentally investigated at JLab from the end of 2010's.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of electron spin resonance in bulk topological\ninsulators, such as Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3. Using the effective four-band\nmodel, we find the electron energy spectrum in a static magnetic field and\ndetermine the response to electric and magnetic dipole perturbations,\nrepresented by oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the\nstatic field. We determine the associated selection rules and calculate the\nabsorption spectra. This enables us to separate the effective orbital and spin\ndegrees of freedom and to determine the effective g-factors for electrons and\nholes.\n", "  Understanding the properties of young open clusters, such as the Initial Mass\nFunction (IMF), star formation history and dynamic evolution, is crucial to\nobtain reliable theoretical predictions of the mechanisms involved in the star\nformation process. We want to obtain a list, as complete as possible, of\nconfirmed members of the young open cluster Gamma Velorum, with the aim of\nderiving general cluster properties such as the IMF. We used all available\nspectroscopic membership indicators within the Gaia-ESO public archive together\nwith literature photometry and X-ray data and, for each method, we derived the\nmost complete list of candidate cluster members. Then, we considered\nphotometry, gravity and radial velocities as necessary conditions to select a\nsubsample of candidates whose membership was confirmed by using the lithium and\nH$\\alpha$ lines and X-rays as youth indicators. We found 242 confirmed and 4\npossible cluster members for which we derived masses using very recent stellar\nevolutionary models. The cluster IMF in the mass range investigated in this\nstudy shows a slope of $\\alpha=2.6\\pm0.5$ for $0.5<M/M_\\odot <1.3$ and\n$\\alpha=1.1\\pm0.4$ for $0.16<M/M_\\odot <0.5$ and is consistent with a standard\nIMF. The similarity of the IMF of the young population around $\\gamma^2 $Vel to\nthat in other star forming regions and the field suggests it may have formed\nthrough very similar processes.\n", "  The current status of coherent energy loss is reviewed, both in theory and in\nits phenomenological applications to p-A collisions.\n", "  Forward $J/\\psi$ production and suppression in high energy proton-nucleus\ncollisions can be an important probe of gluon saturation. In an earlier work we\nstudied this process in the Color Glass Condensate framework and showed that\nusing the Glauber approach to extrapolate the dipole cross section of a proton\nto a nucleus leads to results closer to experimental data than previous\ncalculations in this framework. Here we investigate the centrality dependence\nof the nuclear suppression in this model and show a comparison of our results\nwith recent LHC data.\n", "  Graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs) are a promising\nplatform for the recording of cell action potentials due to the intrinsic high\nsignal amplification of graphene transistors. In addition, graphene technology\nfulfils important key requirements for for in-vivo applications, such as\nbiocompability, mechanical flexibility, as well as ease of high density\nintegration. In this paper we demonstrate the fabrication of flexible arrays of\ngraphene SGFETs on polyimide, a biocompatible polymeric substrate. We\ninvestigate the transistor's transconductance and intrinsic electronic noise\nwhich are key parameters for the device sensitivity, confirming that the\nobtained values are comparable to those of rigid graphene SGFETs. Furthermore,\nwe show that the devices do not degrade during repeated bending and the\ntransconductance, governed by the electronic properties of graphene, is\nunaffected by bending. After cell culture, we demonstrate the recording of cell\naction potentials from cardiomyocyte-like cells with a high signal-to-noise\nratio that is higher or comparable to competing state of the art technologies.\nOur results highlight the great capabilities of flexible graphene SGFETs in\nbioelectronics, providing a solid foundation for in-vivo experiments and,\neventually, for graphene-based neuroprosthetics.\n", "  An Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would enable next-generation measurements of\ndeep-inelastic scattering (DIS) on the deuteron with detection of a\nforward-moving nucleon (p, n) and measurement of its recoil momentum\n(\"spectator tagging\"). Such experiments offer full control of the nuclear\nconfiguration during the high-energy process and can be used for precision\nstudies of the neutron's partonic structure and its spin dependence, nuclear\nmodifications of partonic structure, and nuclear shadowing at small x. We\nreview the theoretical description of spectator tagging at EIC energies\n(light-front nuclear structure, on-shell extrapolation in the recoil nucleon\nmomentum, final-state interactions, diffractive effects at small x) and report\nabout on-going developments.\n", "  Given a conformal data on a flat Euclidean space, we use crosscap conformal\nbootstrap equations to numerically solve the Lee-Yang model as well as the\ncritical Ising model on a three-dimensional real projective space. We check the\nrapid convergence of our bootstrap program in two-dimensions from the exact\nsolutions available. Based on the comparison, we estimate that our systematic\nerror on the numerically solved one-point functions of the critical Ising model\non a three-dimensional real projective space is less than one percent. Our\nmethod opens up a novel way to solve conformal field theories on non-trivial\ngeometries.\n", "  The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their methyl\nderivatives occurs mainly in the dust shells of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars. The bands at 3.3 and 3.4 $\\mu$m, observed in infrared emission spectra\nof several objects, are attributed C-H vibrational modes in aromatic and\naliphatic structures, respectively. In general, the feature at 3.3 $\\mu$m is\nmore intense than the 3.4 $\\mu$m. Photoionization and photodissociation\nprocesses of toluene, the precursor of methylated PAHs, were studied using\nsynchrotron radiation at soft X-ray energies around the carbon K edge with\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry. Partial ion yields of a large number of ionic\nfragments were extracted from single and 2D-spectra, where electron-ion\ncoincidences have revealed the doubly charged parent-molecule and several\ndoubly charged fragments containing seven carbon atoms with considerable\nabundance. \\textit{Ab initio} calculations based on density functional theory\nwere performed to elucidate the chemical structure of these stable dicationic\nspecies. The survival of the dications subjected to hard inner shell ionization\nsuggests that they could be observed in the interstellar medium, especially in\nregions where PAHs are detected. The ionization and destruction of toluene\ninduced by X-rays were examined in the T Dra conditions, a carbon-rich AGB\nstar. In this context, a minimum photodissociation radius and the half-life of\ntoluene subjected to the incidence of the soft X-ray flux emitted from a\ncompanion white dwarf star were determined.\n", "  Plasma densification through magnetic compression has been suggested for\ntime-resolved control of the wave properties in plasma-based accelerators.\nUsing particle in cell simulations with real mass ratio, the practicality of\nlarge magnetic compression on timescales shorter than the ion gyro-period is\ninvestigated. For compression times shorter than the transit time of a\ncompressional Alfven wave across the plasma slab, results show the formation of\ntwo counter-propagating shock waves, leading to a highly non-uniform plasma\ndensity profile. Furthermore, the plasma slab displays large hydromagnetic like\noscillations after the driving field has reached steady state. Peak compression\nis obtained when the two shocks collide in the mid-plane. At this instant, very\nlarge plasma heating is observed, and plasma $\\beta$ is estimated to be about\n$1$. Although these results point out a densification mechanism quite different\nand more complex than initially envisioned, these features could possibly be\nadvantageous in particle accelerators.\n", "  We consider excitations of LLM geometries described by coloring the LLM plane\nwith concentric black rings. Certain closed string excitations are localized at\nthe edges of these rings. The string theory predictions for the energies of\nmagnon excitations of these strings depends on the radii of the edges of the\nrings. In this article we construct the operators dual to these closed string\nexcitations and show how to reproduce the string theory predictions for magnon\nenergies by computing one loop anomalous dimensions. These operators are linear\ncombinations of restricted Schur polynomials. The distinction between what is\nthe background and what is the excitation is accomplished in the choice of the\nsubgroup and the representations used to construct the operator.\n", "  In order to investigate the temporal evolution of binary populations in\ngeneral, double compact star binaries and mergers in particular within a\ngalactic evolution context, a most straightforward method is obviously the\nimplementation of a detailed binary evolutionary model in a galactic chemical\nevolution code. To our knowledge, the Brussels galactic chemical evolution code\nis the only one that fully consistently accounts for the important effects of\ninteracting binaries on the predictions of chemical evolution. With a galactic\ncode that does not explicitly include binaries, the temporal evolution of the\npopulation of double compact star binaries and mergers can be estimated with\nreasonable accuracy if the delayed time distribution (DTD) for these mergers is\navailable. The DTD for supernovae type Ia has been studied extensively the last\ndecade. In the present paper we present the DTD for merging double neutron star\nbinaries and mixed systems consisting of a neutron star and a black hole. The\nlatter mergers are very promising sites for the production of r-process\nelements and the DTDs can be used to study the galactic evolution of these\nelements with a code that does not explicitly account for binaries.\n", "  The non-extensive statistical mechanics has been applied to describe a\nvariety of complex systems with inherent correlations and feedback loops. Here\nwe present a dynamical model based on previously proposed static model\nexhibiting in the thermodynamic limit the extensivity of the Tsallis entropy\nwith q<1 as well as a q-Gaussian distribution. The dynamical model consists of\na one-dimensional ring of particles characterized by correlated binary random\nvariables, which are allowed to flip according to a simple random walk rule.\nThe proposed dynamical model provides an insight how a mesoscopic dynamics\ncharacterized by the non-extensive statistical mechanics could emerge from a\nmicroscopic description of the system.\n", "  The normal coefficient of restitution (COR) for a spherical particle bouncing\non a wet plane is investigated experimentally and compared with a model\ncharacterizing the energy loss at impact. For fixed ratios of liquid film\nthickness $\\delta$ to particle diameter $D$, the wet COR is always found to\ndecay linearly with St$^{-1}$, where St, the Stokes number, measures the\nparticle inertia with respect to the viscous force of the liquid. Such a\ndependency suggests a convenient way of predicting the wet COR with two fit\nparameters: A critical COR at infinitely large St and a critical St at zero\nCOR. We characterize the dependency of the two parameters on $\\delta/D$ and\ncompare it with a model considering the energy loss from the inertia and the\nviscosity of the wetting liquid. This investigation suggests an analytical\nprediction of the COR for wet particles.\n", "  We present ALMA follow-up observations of two massive, early-stage core\ncandidates, C1-N & C1-S, in Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G028.37+00.07, which\nwere previously identified by their N2D+(3-2) emission and show high levels of\ndeuteration of this species. The cores are also dark at far infrared\nwavelengths up to ~100 microns. We detect 12CO(2-1) from a narrow,\nhighly-collimated bipolar outflow that is being launched from near the center\nof the C1-S core, which is also the location of the peak 1.3mm dust continuum\nemission. This protostar, C1-Sa, has associated dense gas traced by C18O(2-1)\nand DCN(3-2), from which we estimate it has a radial velocity that is near the\ncenter of the range exhibited by the C1-S massive core. A second\noutflow-driving source is also detected within the projected boundary of C1-S,\nbut appears to be at a different radial velocity. After considering properties\nof the outflows, we conclude C1-Sa is a promising candidate for an early-stage\nmassive protostar and as such it shows that these early phases of massive star\nformation can involve highly ordered outflow, and thus accretion, processes,\nsimilar to models developed to explain low-mass protostars.\n", "  The transverse momentum spectra of final-state light flavor particles\nproduced in proton-proton (p-p), copper-copper (Cu-Cu), gold-gold (Au-Au),\nlead-lead (Pb-Pb), and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions for different centralities\nat relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) and large hadron collider (LHC)\nenergies are studied in the framework of a multisource thermal model. The\nexperimental data measured by the STAR, CMS, and ALICE Collaborations are\nconsistent with the results calculated by the multi-component Erlang\ndistribution and Tsallis Statistics. The effective temperature and real\ntemperature (kinetic freeze-out temperature) of interacting system at the stage\nof kinetic freeze-out, the mean transverse flow velocity and mean flow velocity\nof particles, and the relationships between them are extracted. The dependences\nof effective temperature and mean (transverse) momentum on rest mass, moving\nmass, centrality, and center-of-mass energy, and the dependences of kinetic\nfreeze-out temperature and mean (transverse) flow velocity on centrality,\ncenter-of-mass energy, and system size are obtained.\n", "  Ring dark and anti-dark solitons in nonlocal media are found. These\nstructures have, respectively, the form of annular dips or humps on top of a\nstable continuous-wave background, and exist in a weak or strong nonlocality\nregime, defined by the sign of a characteristic parameter. It is demonstrated\nanalytically that these solitons satisfy an effective cylindrical\nKadomtsev-Petviashvilli (aka Johnson's) equation and, as such, can be written\nexplicitly in closed form. Numerical simulations show that they propagate\nundistorted and undergo quasi-elastic collisions, attesting to their stability\nproperties.\n", "  Searches for new physics will increasingly depend on identifying deviations\nfrom precision Standard Model (SM) predictions. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)\nwill necessarily play a central role in this endeavor as it provides the\nframework for the parton model. However, as we move to higher orders and into\nextreme kinematic regions, we begin to see the full complexities of the QCD\ntheory. Recent theoretical developments improve our ability to analyze both\nproton and nuclear PDFs across the full kinematic range. These developments are\nincorporated into the new nCTEQ15 PDFs, and we review these developments with\nrespect to future measurements, and identify areas where additional effort is\nrequired.\n", "  The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on NASA's New Horizon Pluto\nmission has collected solar wind observations en route from Earth to Pluto, and\nthese observations continue beyond Pluto. Few missions have explored the solar\nwind in the outer heliosphere making this dataset a critical addition to the\nfield. We created a forward model of SWAP count rates, which includes a\ncomprehensive instrument response function based on laboratory and flight\ncalibrations. By fitting the count rates with this model, the proton density\n(n), speed (V), and temperature (T) parameters are determined. Comparisons\nbetween SWAP parameters and both propagated 1 AU observations and prior Voyager\n2 observations indicate consistency in both the range and mean wind values.\nThese comparisons as well as our additional findings confirm that small and\nmidsized solar wind structures are worn down with increasing distance due to\ndynamic interaction of parcels of wind with different speed. For instance, the\nT-V relationship steepens, as the range in V is limited more than the range in\nT with distance. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU,\nwhich may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T\nreflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere. The power of\nwind parameters at shorter periodicities decreases with distance as the longer\nperiodicities strengthen. The solar rotation periodicity is present in\ntemperature beyond 20 AU indicating the observed parcel temperature may reflect\nnot only current heating or cooling, but also heating occurring closer to the\nSun.\n", "  In previous work [1] general expressions, valid for arbitrary bunch lengths,\nwere derived for the wakefields of corrugated structures with flat geometry,\nsuch as is used in the RadiaBeam/LCLS dechirper. However, the bunch at the end\nof linac-based X-ray FELs--like the LCLS--is extremely short, and for short\nbunches the wakes can be considerably simplified. In this work, we first derive\nanalytical approximations to the short-range wakes. These are generalized\nwakes, in the sense that their validity is not limited to a small neighborhood\nof the symmetry axis, but rather extends to arbitrary transverse offsets of\ndriving and test particles. The validity of these short-bunch wakes holds not\nonly for the corrugated structure, but rather for any flat structure whose\nbeam-cavity interaction can be described by a surface impedance. We use these\nwakes to obtain, for a short bunch passing through a dechirper: estimates of\nthe energy loss as function of gap, the transverse kick as function of beam\noffset, the slice energy spread increase, and the emittance growth. In the\nAppendix, a more accurate derivation--than is found in [1]--of the arbitrary\nbunch length wakes is performed; we find full agreement with the earlier\nresults, provided the bunches are short compared to the dechirper gap, which is\nnormally the regime of interest.\n  [1] K.

Beams 18, 034401(2015).\n", "  The 750-760 GeV diphoton resonance may be identified as one or two scalars\nand/or one or two pseudoscalars contained in the two singlet superfields\nS_{1,2} arising from the three 27-dimensional representations of E_6 . The\nthree 27s also contain three copies of colour-triplet charge \\mp 1/3\nvector-like fermions D,\\bar{D} and two copies of charged inert Higgsinos\n\\tilde{H}^{+},\\tilde{H}^{-} to which the singlets S_{1,2} may couple. We\npropose a variant of the E_6SSM where the third singlet S_3 breaks a gauged\nU(1)_N above the TeV scale, predicting Z'_N, D,\\bar{D},\n\\tilde{H}^{+},\\tilde{H}^{-} at LHC Run 2, leaving the two lighter singlets\nS_{1,2} with masses around 750 GeV. We calculate the branching ratios and\ncross-sections for the two scalar and two pseudoscalar states associated with\nthe S_{1,2} singlets, including possible degeneracies and maximal mixing,\nsubject to the constraint that their couplings remain perturbative up to the\nunification scale.\n", "  We study the implications of flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC's) in a\nmodel with the $SU(2)_l\\times SU(2)_h\\times U(1)_Y$ electroweak gauge symmetry\nfor several anomalies appearing in $b\\to s \\ell\\bar \\ell$ induced $B$ decays in\nLHCb data. In this model, $SU(2)_l$ and $SU(2)_h$ govern the left-handed\nfermions in the first two generations and the third generation, respectively.\nThe physical $Z$ and $Z'$ generate the $b\\to s$ transition at tree level,\nleading to additional contributions to the $b \\to s$ semileptonic operators\n${\\cal O}_{9,10}$. We find that although $B_s$-$\\bar B_s$ mixing constrains the\nparameters severely, the model can produce values of ${\\cal C}^{\\rm NP}_{9,10}$\nin the range determined by Descotes-Genon {\\it et. al.} in\nRef.~\\cite{Descotes-Genon:2015uva} for this scenario to improve the global fit\nof observables in decays induced by the $b\\to s \\mu \\bar \\mu$ transition. The\n$Z'$ boson in this model also generates tree-level FCNC's for the leptonic\ninteractions that can accommodate the experimental central value of $R_K =\n{\\cal B}(B\\to K \\mu \\bar \\mu)/{\\cal B}(B\\to K e\\bar e)=0.75$. In this case, the\nmodel predicts sizeable branching ratios for $B\\to K e \\bar \\tau$, $B\\to K \\tau\n\\bar e$, and an enhancement of $B\\to K \\tau \\bar \\tau$ with respect to its SM\nvalue.\n", "  Exclusive processes of heavy meson production and spacelike and timelike\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering allow us to investigate the hadron structure\nin terms of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). We review recent\ndevelopments in the NLO description of such processes.\n", "  In 1965 it was discovered that cosmic ray air showers emit impulsive radio\nsignals at frequencies below 100 MHz. After a period of intense research in the\n1960s and 1970s, however, interest in the detection technique faded almost\ncompletely. With the availability of powerful digital signal processing\ntechniques, new attempts at measuring cosmic ray air showers via their radio\nemission were started at the beginning of the new millennium. Starting with\nmodest, small-scale digital prototype setups, the field has evolved, matured\nand grown very significantly in the past decade. Today's second-generation\ndigital radio detection experiments consist of up to hundreds of radio antennas\nor cover areas of up to 17 km$^{2}$. We understand the physics of the radio\nemission in extensive air showers in detail and have developed analysis\nstrategies to accurately derive from radio signals parameters which are related\nto the astrophysics of the primary cosmic ray particles, in particular their\nenergy, arrival direction and estimators for their mass. In parallel to these\nsuccesses, limitations inherent in the physics of the radio signals have also\nbecome increasingly clear. In this article, we review the progress of the past\ndecade and the current state of the field, discuss the current paradigm of the\nradio emission physics and present the experimental evidence supporting it.\nFinally, we discuss the potential for future applications of the radio\ndetection technique to advance the field of cosmic ray physics.\n", "  The discovery of neutrino masses through the observation of oscillations\nboosted the importance of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$). In\nthis paper, we review the main features of this process, underlining its key\nrole both from the experimental and theoretical point of view. In particular,\nwe contextualize the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ in the panorama of lepton-number\nviolating processes, also assessing some possible particle physics mechanisms\nmediating the process. Since the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ existence is correlated with\nneutrino masses, we also review the state-of-art of the theoretical\nunderstanding of neutrino masses. In the final part, the status of current\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments is presented and the prospects for the future hunt\nfor $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ are discussed. Also, experimental data coming from\ncosmological surveys are considered and their impact on $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nexpectations is examined.\n", "  We show how to fully map a specific model of modified gravity into the\nEinstein-Boltzmann solver EFTCAMB. This approach consists in few steps and\nallows to obtain the cosmological phenomenology of a model with minimal effort.\nWe discuss all these steps, from the solution of the dynamical equations for\nthe cosmological background of the model to the use of the mapping relations to\ncast the model into the effective field theory language and use the latter to\nsolve for perturbations. We choose the Hu-Sawicki f(R) model of gravity as our\nworking example. After solving the background and performing the mapping, we\ninterface the algorithm with EFTCAMB and take advantage of the effective field\ntheory framework to integrate the full dynamics of linear perturbations,\nreturning all quantities needed to accurately compare the model with\nobservations. We discuss some observational signatures of this model, focusing\non the linear growth of cosmic structures. In particular we present the\nbehavior of $f\\sigma_8$ and $E_G$ that, unlike the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario, are\ngenerally scale dependent in addition to redshift dependent. Finally, we study\nthe observational implications of the model by comparing its cosmological\npredictions to the Planck 2015 data, including CMB lensing, the WiggleZ galaxy\nsurvey and the CFHTLenS weak lensing survey measurements. We find that while\nWiggleZ data favor a non-vanishing value of the Hu-Sawicki model parameter,\n$\\log_{10}(-f^0_{R})$, and consequently a large value of $\\sigma_8$, CFHTLenS\ndrags the estimate of $\\log_{10}(-f^0_{R})$ back to the $\\Lambda$CDM limit.\n", "  Including O(m_c) terms in the coefficient functions and/or O(m_D) twist 3\ncontributions in the heavy meson distribution amplitudes leads to a non-zero\ntransverse amplitude for exclusive neutrino production of a D pseudoscalar\ncharmed meson on an unpolarized target. We work in the framework of the\ncollinear QCD approach where chiral-odd transversity generalized parton\ndistributions (GPDs) factorize from perturbatively calculable coefficient\nfunctions.\n", "  Money is central in US politics, and most campaign contributions stem from a\ntiny, wealthy elite. Like other political acts, campaign donations are known to\nbe socially contagious. We study how campaign donations diffuse through a\nnetwork of more than 50 000 elites and examine how connectivity among previous\ndonors reinforces contagion. We find that the diffusion of donations is driven\nby independent reinforcement contagion: people are more likely to donate when\nexposed to donors from different social groups than when they are exposed to\nequally many donors from the same group. Counter-intuitively, being exposed to\none side may increase donations to the other side. Although the effect is weak,\nsimultaneous cross-cutting exposure makes donation somewhat less likely.\nFinally, the independence of donors in the beginning of a campaign predicts the\namount of money that is raised throughout a campaign. We theorize that people\ninfer population-wide estimates from their local observations, with elites\nassessing the viability of candidates, possibly opposing candidates in response\nto local support. Our findings suggest that theories of complex contagions need\nrefinement and that political campaigns should target multiple communities.\n", "  We derive asymptotic freedom of gluons in terms of the renormalized $SU(3)$\nYang-Mills Hamiltonian in the Fock space. Namely, we use the renormalization\ngroup procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) to calculate the three-gluon\ninteraction term in the front-form Yang-Mills Hamiltonian using a perturbative\nexpansion in powers of $g$ up to third order. The resulting three-gluon vertex\nis a function of the scale parameter $s$ that has an interpretation of the size\nof effective gluons. The corresponding Hamiltonian running coupling constant\nexhibits asymptotic freedom, and the corresponding Hamiltonian $\\beta$-function\ncoincides with the one obtained in an earlier calculation using a different\ngenerator.\n", "  We study the mass spectrum of destroyed dwarfs that contribute to the\naccreted stellar mass of Milky Way (MW) mass M_vir ~ 10^12.1 M_sun) halos using\na suite of 45 zoom-in, dissipationless simulations. Empirical models are\nemployed to relate (peak) subhalo mass to dwarf stellar mass, and we use\nconstraints from z=0 observations and hydrodynamical simulations to estimate\nthe metallicity distribution of the accreted stellar material. The dominant\ncontributors to the accreted stellar mass are relatively massive dwarfs with\nM_star ~ 10^8-10^10 M_sun. Halos with more quiescent accretion histories tend\nto have lower mass progenitors (10^8-10^9 M_sun), and lower overall accreted\nstellar masses. Ultra-faint mass (M_star < 10^5 M_sun) dwarfs contribute a\nnegligible amount (<< 1%) to the accreted stellar mass and, despite having low\naverage metallicities, supply a small fraction (~2-5 %) of the very metal-poor\nstars with [Fe/H] < -2. Dwarfs with masses 10^5 < M_star/M_sun < 10^8 provide a\nsubstantial amount of the very metal-poor stellar material (~40-80 %), and even\nrelatively metal-rich dwarfs with M_star > 10^8 M_sun can contribute a\nconsiderable fraction (~20-60 %) of metal-poor stars if their metallicity\ndistributions have significant metal-poor tails. Finally, we find that the\ngeneric assumption of a quiescent assembly history for the MW halo seems to be\nin tension with the mass spectrum of its surviving dwarfs. We suggest that the\nMW could be a \"transient fossil\"; a quiescent halo with a recent accretion\nevent(s) that disguises the preceding formation history of the halo.\n", "  Properties of the $\\omega$ structure are investigated for 27 transition\nelements from the viewpoints of thermodynamical and mechanical stability based\non first-principles calculations. The thermodynamical stability of the $\\omega$\nstructure is compared with those for the body-centered cubic (BCC),\nface-centered cubic (FCC), and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures.\nSimilarly to the case of those popular crystal structures, the occupation\nnumber for $d$ orbitals is found to roughly determine relative energy and\nvolume of the nonmagnetic (NM) $\\omega$ structure. For the group 4 elements\n(Ti, Zr, and Hf), the $\\omega$ structure is almost the lowest in energy among\nthe investigated crystal structures and is also mechanically stable. The\n$\\omega$ structure of the group 7 elements (Mn, Tc, and Re) is also\nmechanically stable. The $\\omega$ Fe is found to exhibit a complicated magnetic\nstate that is different from the ferromagnetic (FM) and NM ones. This magnetic\nstate is the most favorable among the investigated magnetic states. The\n$\\omega$ Fe in this magnetic state is also mechanically stable. Energies of\nbinary alloys composed of the elements in the group 4 and those in the groups 5\nand 6 are estimated by linear interpolation, and most of the alloys show\nconcentration ranges where the $\\omega$ structure is the lowest in energy among\nthe investigated crystal structures.\n", "  We propose a new method to probe the magnetic and electric dipole moments of\nthe $\\tau$ lepton using precise measurements of the differential rates of\nradiative leptonic $\\tau$ decays at high-luminosity $B$ factories. Possible\ndeviations of these moments from the Standard Model values are analyzed in an\neffective Lagrangian approach, thus providing model-independent results.\nAnalytic expressions for the relevant non-standard contributions to the\ndifferential decay rates are presented. Earlier proposals to probe the $\\tau$\ndipole moments are examined. A detailed feasibility study of our method is\nperformed in the conditions of the Belle and Belle II experiments at the KEKB\nand Super-KEKB colliders, respectively. This study shows that our approach,\napplied to the planned full set of Belle II data for radiative leptonic $\\tau$\ndecays, has the potential to improve the present experimental bound on the\n$\\tau$ anomalous magnetic moment. On the contrary, its foreseen sensitivity is\nnot expected to lower the current experimental limit on the $\\tau$ electric\ndipole moment.\n", "  The linear stability of a magnetized plasma accompanying temperature gradient\nwas reexamined by using plasma kinetic theory. The anisotropic velocity\ndistribution function was decomposed into two components. One is proportional\nto the temperature gradient parallel to and the other is proportional to the\ntemperature gradient perpendicular to the back ground magnetic field. Since the\namplitude of the anisotropic velocity distribution function is proportional to\nthe heat conductivity and the heat conductivities perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield is strongly reduced, the first component of the anisotropic velocity\ndistribution function is predominant. The anisotropic velocity distribution\nfunction induced by the temperature gradient along the back ground magnetic\nfield drives plasma kinetic instability and the circular polarized magnetic\nplasma waves are excited. The instability is almost identical to Weibel\ninstability in weakly magnetized plasma. However, depending on whether wave\nvectors of modes are parallel to or antiparallel to the back ground magnetic\nfield, the growth rate is suppressed or enhanced due to back ground magnetic\nfield. In the strongly magnetized plasma, one mode is stabilized and only one\nof the modes remains unstable.\n  The Jitter radiation spectrum formulae emitted by relativistic electrons when\nthey travel through the magnetized plasma with the plasma waves driven by the\ninstability, are deduced at the first time. The synchrotron emission and the\nJitter radiation are simultaneously emitted from the same relativistic\nelectron. The Jitter radiation is expected to be circularly polarized but with\na very small polarization degree since almost the same amount of left and right\nhanded circular polarized magnetic waves are excited by the instability.\n", "  Chromospheric observations taken at high cadence and high spatial resolution\nshow a range of spicule like features, including Type I, Type II (as well as\nRBEs and RREs) and those which seem to appear within a few seconds, which if\ninterpreted as flows would imply mass flow velocities in excess of 1000 km/s.\nThis article seeks to quantify and study rapidly appearing spicular type\nevents. We also compare the MOMFBD and speckle reconstruction techniques in\norder to understand if such spicules are more favourably observed using a\nparticular technique. We use spectral imaging observations taken with the CRISP\non the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. Data was sampled at multiple positions\nwithin the Halpha line profile for both an ondisk and limb location. The data\nis host to numerous rapidly appearing features which are observed at different\nlocations within the Halpha line profile. The feature's durations vary between\n10 and 20 s and lengths around 3500 km. Sometimes, a time delay in their\nappearance between the blue and red wings of 3 and 5 s is evident, whereas\nsometimes they are near simultaneous. In some instances features are observed\nto fade and then re emerge at the same location several tens of seconds later.\nWe provide the first statistical analysis of these spicules and suggest that\nthese observations can be interpreted as the LOS movement of highly dynamic\nspicules moving in and out of the narrow 60 mA transmission filter used to\nobserve in different parts of the Halpha line profile. The LOS velocity\ncomponent of the observed fast chromospheric features, manifested as Doppler\nshifts, are responsible for their appearance in the red and blue wings of\nHalpha line. Additional work involving data at other wavelengths is required to\ninvestigate the nature of their possible wavelike activity.\n", "  A new apodized Keplerian (AK) model is proposed for the analysis of precision\nradial velocity (RV) data to model both planetary and stellar activity (SA)\ninduced RV signals. A symmetrical Gaussian apodization function with unknown\nwidth and center can distinguish planetary signals from SA signals on the basis\nof the span of the apodization window. The general model for $m$ apodized\nKeplerian signals includes a linear regression term between RV and the stellar\nactivity diagnostic $\\log(R'hk)$, as well as an extra Gaussian noise term with\nunknown standard deviation. The model parameters are explored using a Bayesian\nfusion MCMC code. A differential version of the Generalized Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram that employs a control diagnostic provides an additional way of\ndistinguishing SA signals and helps guide the choice of new periods. Results\nare reported for a recent international RV blind challenge which included\nmultiple state of the art simulated data sets supported by a variety of stellar\nactivity diagnostics. In the current implementation, the AK method achieved a\nreduction in SA noise by a factor of approximately 6. Final parameter estimates\nfor the planetary candidates are derived from fits that include AK signals to\nmodel the SA components and simple Keplerians to model the planetary\ncandidates. Preliminary results are also reported for AK models augmented by a\nmoving average component that allows for correlations in the residuals.\n", "  In the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lema{\\^\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)\ngeometry, we present a nonsingular model (no big bang singularity at finite\ntime) of our universe describing its evolution starting from its early\ninflationary era up to the present accelerating phase. We found that a\nhydrodynamical fluid with nonlinear equation of state could result in such a\nnon singular scenario, which after the end of this inflationary stage, suffers\na sudden phase transition and enters into the stiff matter dominated era, and\nthe universe becomes reheated due to a huge amount of particle production.\nFinally, it asymptotically enters into the de Sitter phase concluding the\npresent accelerated expansion. We show that the background providing an\ninflationary potential leads to a power spectrum of the cosmological\nperturbations which fit well with the latest Planck estimations. At the end, we\ncompared our viable potential with some known inflationary quintessential\npotentials, which shows that, our model is an improved version of them because\nit contains an analytic solution that allows us to perform analytic\ncalculations.\n", "  A new generation of telescopes with mirror diameters of 20 m or more, called\nextremely large telescopes (ELTs) has the potential to provide unprecedented\nimaging and spectroscopy of exo-planetary systems, if the difficulties in\nachieving the extremely high dynamic range required to differentiate the\nplanetary signal from the star can be overcome to a sufficient degree. Fully\nutilizing the potential of ELTs for exoplanet imaging will likely require\nsimultaneous and self-consistent determination of both the planetary image and\nthe unknown aberrations in multiple planes of the optical system, using\nstatistical inference based on the wavefront sensor and science camera data\nstreams. This approach promises to overcome the most important systematic\nerrors inherent in the various schemes based on differential imaging, such as\nADI and SDI. This paper is the first in a series on this subject, in which a\nformalism is established for the exoplanet imaging problem, setting the stage\nfor the statistical inference methods to follow in the future. Every effort has\nbeen made to be rigorous and complete, so that validity of approximations to be\nmade later can be assessed. Here, the polarimetric image is expressed in terms\nof aberrations in the various planes of a polarizing telescope with an adaptive\noptics system. Further, it is shown that current methods that utilize focal\nplane sensing to correct the speckle field, e.g., electric field conjugation,\nrely on the tacit assumption that aberrations on multiple optical surfaces can\nbe represented as aberration on a single optical surface, ultimately limiting\ntheir potential effectiveness for ground-based astronomy.\n", "  Time-resolved spectroscopic temperature measurements of a sealed carbon\ndioxide sample cell were realized with an optical frequency comb combined with\na two-dimensional dispersive spectrometer. A supercontinuum laser source based\non an erbium fiber mode-locked laser was employed to generate coherent light\naround 2000 nm (5000 cm-1). The laser was passed through a 12-cm long cell\ncontaining CO2, and the transmitted light was analyzed in a virtually imaged\nphased array- (VIPA-) based spectrometer. Broadband spectra spanning more than\n100 cm-1 with a spectral resolution of roughly 0.075 cm-1 (2.2 GHz) were\nacquired with an integration period of 2 ms. The temperature of the CO2 sample\nwas deduced from fitting a modeled spectrum to the line intensities of the\nexperimentally acquired spectrum. Temperature dynamics on the time scale of\nmilliseconds were observed with a temperature resolution of 2.6 K. The\nspectroscopically-deduced temperatures agreed with temperatures of the sample\ncell measured with a thermistor. Potential applications of this technique\ninclude quantitative measurement of carbon dioxide concentration and\ntemperature dynamics in gas-phase chemical reactions (e.g., combustion), and\nplasma diagnostics.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength analysis of 20 EUV jets which occurred at the\nperiphery of active regions close to sunspots. We discuss the physical\nparameters of the jets and their relation with other phenomena such as H alpha\nsurges, nonthermal type III radio bursts and hard X-ray emission. Using AIA\nwavelength channels sensitive to coronal temperatures, we studied the\ntemperature distribution in the jets using the line-of-sight Differential\nEmission Measure technique. We also investigated the role of the photospheric\nmagnetic field using the LOS magnetogram data from the HMI. The lifetime of\njets range from 5 to 39 minutes with an average of 18 minutes and their\nvelocities range from 87 to 532 km/s with an average of 271 km/s. Most of the\njets are co-temporal with nonthermal type III radio bursts observed by the\nWind/WAVES spacecraft. We confirm the source region of these bursts using the\nPotential Field Source Surface technique. 10 out of 20 events showed that the\njets originated in a region of flux cancellation and 6 jets in a region of flux\nemergence. 4 events showed flux emergence and then cancellation during the jet\nevolution. DEM analyses showed that for most of the spires of the jets, the DEM\npeaked at around log T [K] = 6.2/6.3. In addition, we derived an emission\nmeasure and a lower limit of electron density at the location of the spire and\nthe footpoint. These results are in agreement with those obtained earlier by\nstudying individual active region jets. The observation of flux cancellation,\nthe association with HXR emission and emission of nonthermal type III radio\nbursts, suggest that the initiation and therefore, heating is taking place at\nthe base of the jet. This is also supported by the high temperature plasma\nrevealed by the DEM analysis in the jet footpoint. Our results provide\nsubstantial constraints for theoretical modeling of the jets and their\nthermodynamic nature.\n", "  $\\alpha$-cluster excited states in $^{32}$S are investigated with an extended\n$^{28}$Si+$\\alpha$ cluster model, in which the $^{28}$Si core deformation and\nrotation, and the $\\alpha$-cluster breaking are incorporated. In the GCM\ncalculation with the extended $^{28}$Si+$\\alpha$ cluster model, the\n$\\alpha$-cluster excited states are obtained near the $^{28}$Si+$\\alpha$\nthreshold energy. The $^{28}$Si core deformation and rotation effects, and also\nthe $\\alpha$-clusters breaking in the $^{28}$Si+$\\alpha$ system are discussed.\nIt is found that the rotation of the oblately deformed $^{28}$Si core gives a\nsignificant effect to the $\\alpha$-cluster excited states whereas the\n$\\alpha$-cluster breaking gives only a minor effect.\n", "  We show how the double parton distributions may be obtained consistently from\nthe many-body light-cone wave functions. We illustrate the method on the\nexample of the pion with two Fock components. The procedure, by construction,\nsatisfies the Gaunt-Stirling sum rules. The resulting single parton\ndistributions of valence quarks and gluons are consistent with a\nphenomenological parametrization at a low scale.\n", "  The quest for extremely high mobilities of 2d electron gases in MBE-grown\nheterostructures is hampered by the available purity of the starting materials,\nparticularly of the gallium. Here we compare the role of different Ga lots\nhaving nominally the highest possible quality on the mobility and the\nphotoluminescence (PL) of modulation doped single interface structures and find\nsignificant differences. A weak exciton PL reveals that the purity of the Ga is\ninsufficient. No high mobility can be reached with such a lot with a reasonable\neffort. On the other hand, a strong exciton PL indicates a high initial Ga\npurity, allowing to reach mobilities of 15 million (single interface) or 28\nmillion $cm^2/Vsec$ (doped quantum wells) in our MBE systems. We discuss\npossible origins of the inconsistent Ga quality. Furthermore, we compare\nsamples grown in different MBE systems over a period of several years and find\nthat mobility and PL is correlated if similar structures and growth procedures\nare used.\n", "  The form of the kernel that controls the dynamics of the Bethe-Salpeter\nequations is essential for obtaining quantitatively accurate predictions for\nthe observable properties of hadrons. In the present work we briefly review the\nbasic physical concepts and field-theoretic techniques employed in a\nfirst-principle derivation of a universal (process-independent) component of\nthis kernel. This \"top-down\" approach combines nonperturbative ingredients\nobtained from lattice simulations and Dyson-Schwinger equations, and furnishes\na renormalization-group invariant quark-gluon interaction strength, which is in\nexcellent agreement with the corresponding quantity obtained from a systematic\n\"bottom-up\" treatment, where bound-state data are fitted within a well-defined\ntruncation scheme.\n", "  We use kinetic theory in order to study the role of quantum fluctuations in\nthe isotropization of the pressure tensor in a system subject to fast\nlongitudinal expansion, such as the matter produced in the early stages of a\nheavy ion collision.\n", "  The transverse spin angular momentum of light has recently received\ntremendous attention as it adds a new degree of freedom for controlling\nlight-matter interactions. In this work we demonstrate the generation of\ntransverse spin angular momentum by the weakly-guided mode of semiconductor\nnanowires. The evanescent field of these modes in combination with the\ntransversality condition rigorously accounts for the occurrence of transverse\nspin angular momentum. The intriguing and nontrivial spin properties of optical\nmodes in semiconductor nanowires are of high interest for a broad range of new\napplications including chiral optical trapping, quantum information processing,\nand nanophotonic circuitry.\n", "  We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of two-orbital SU(N)\nfermionic models at incommensurate filling which are directly relevant to\nstrontium and ytterbium ultracold atoms loading into a one-dimensional optical\nlattice. Using a low-energy approach that takes into account explicitly the\nSU(N) symmetry, we find that a spectral gap for the nuclear-spin degrees of\nfreedom is formed for generic interactions. Several phases with one or two\ngapless modes are then stabilized which describe the competition between\ndifferent density instabilities. In stark contrast to the N=2 case, no dominant\npairing instabilities emerge and the leading superfluid one is rather formed\nfrom bound states of 2N fermions.\n", "  The third-order non-linearity of silicon gives rise to a spontaneous\nfour-wave mixing process in which correlated photon pairs are generated.\nSources based on this effect can be used for quantum computation and\ncryptography, and can in principle be integrated with standard CMOS fabrication\ntechnology and components. However, one of the major challenges is the on-chip\ndemultiplexing of the photons, and in particular the filtering of the pump\npower, which is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal and\nidler photons. Here, we propose a photonic crystal coupled-cavity system\ndesigned so that the coupling of the pump mode to the output channel is\nstrictly zero due to symmetry. We further analyze this effect in presence of\nfabrication disorder and find that, even then, a pump suppression of close to\n40 dB can be achieved in state-of-the art systems. Due to the small mode\nvolumes and high quality factors, our system is also expected to have a\ngeneration efficiency much higher than in standard micro-ring systems. Those\ntwo considerations make a strong case for the integration of our proposed\ndesign in future on-chip quantum technologies.\n", "  Employing a self-consistent (optimized) variational diagonalization scheme,\nwe investigate the formation of polaronic quasiparticles in a spinless\nfermion-boson transport model that couples the movement of charge carriers to\nfluctuations and correlations of a background medium. The background is\nparameterized by bosonic degrees of freedom. The variational fermion-boson\nHilbert space is constructed to achieve high accuracy in one to three spatial\ndimensions with modest computational requirements. To characterize the\nground-state properties of the Edwards model in the single-particle sector, we\npresent exact numerical results for the polaron band dispersion, quasiparticle\nweight, Drude weight, mass enhancement, and the particle-boson correlations in\na wide parameter regime. In the Edwards model, transport will be quasifree,\ndiffusive or boson-assisted in the weakly fermion-boson coupled,\nfluctuation-dominated or strongly correlated regimes, respectively. Thereby\ncorrelated transport is not only assisted but also limited by the bosonic\nexcitations. As a result, the Drude weight remains finite even in the limit of\nvery small boson frequencies. For a strongly correlated background, closed\nloops are important, in any dimension, to generate a finite effective particle\nmass even when the free fermion has an infinite mass.\n", "  Timing-pick up detectors with excellent timing resolutions are essential in\nmany modern nuclear physics experiments. Aiming to develop a Time-Of-Flight\nsystem with precision down to about 10 ps, we have made a systematic study of\nthe timing characteristic of TOF detectors, which consist of several\ncombinations of plastic scintillators and photomultiplier tubes. With the\nconventional electronics, the best timing resolution of about 5.1 ps ({\\sigma})\nhas been achieved for detectors with an area size of 3x1 cm2. It is found that\nfor data digitalization a combination of TAC and ADC can achieve a better time\nresolution than currently available TDC. Simultaneously measurements of both\ntime and pulse height are very valuable for correction of time-walk effect.\n", "  We use numerical climate simulations, paleoclimate data, and modern\nobservations to study the effect of growing ice melt from Antarctica and\nGreenland. Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying\nfeedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold\nmeltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the\nSouthern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and\nheat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface\ncooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the\nSouthern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation,\nand increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact\nwith the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that\nice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level\nseveral meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear\nresponse. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise\nin about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the\nlower end of the 10-40 year range, but the record is too short to confirm the\nnature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help\nexplain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in\ncontrolling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global\ntemperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000 year) time scale of deep\nocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change and thus the\ntime scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this\npaleo millennial time scale should not be misinterpreted as the time scale for\nice sheet response to a rapid large human-made climate forcing.\n", "  We study the dephasing of an individual high-frequency tunneling two-level\nsystem (TLS) due to its interaction with an ensemble of low-frequency thermal\nTLSs which are described by the standard tunneling model (STM). We show that\nthe dephasing by the bath of TLSs explains both the dependence of the Ramsey\ndephasing rate on an externally applied strain as well as its order of\nmagnitude, as observed in a recent experiment [J. Lisenfeld et al.]. However,\nthe theory based on the STM predicts the Hahn-echo protocol to be much more\nefficient, yielding too low echo dephasing rates, as compared to the\nexperiment. Also the strain dependence of the echo dephasing rate predicted by\nthe STM does not agree with the measured quadratic dependence, which would fit\nto a high-frequency white noise environment. We suggest that few fast TLSs\nwhich are coupled much more strongly to the strain fields than the usual TLSs\nof the STM give rise to such a white noise. This explains the magnitude and\nstrong fluctuations of the echo dephasing rate observed in the experiment.\n", "  The variational problem of gravity theories is directly related to black hole\nthermodynamics. For asymptotically locally AdS backgrounds it is known that\nholographic renormalization results in a variational principle in terms of\nequivalence classes of boundary data under the local asymptotic symmetries of\nthe theory, which automatically leads to finite conserved charges satisfying\nthe first law of thermodynamics. We show that this connection holds well beyond\nasymptotically AdS black holes. In particular, we formulate the variational\nproblem for $\\mathcal{N}=2$ STU supergravity in four dimensions with boundary\nconditions corresponding to those obeyed by the so called `subtracted\ngeometries'. We show that such boundary conditions can be imposed covariantly\nin terms of a set of asymptotic second class constraints, and we derive the\nappropriate boundary terms that render the variational problem well posed in\ntwo different duality frames of the STU model. This allows us to define finite\nconserved charges associated with any asymptotic Killing vector and to\ndemonstrate that these charges satisfy the Smarr formula and the first law of\nthermodynamics. Moreover, by uplifting the theory to five dimensions and then\nreducing on a 2-sphere, we provide a precise map between the thermodynamic\nobservables of the subtracted geometries and those of the BTZ black hole.\nSurface terms play a crucial role in this identification.\n", "  Full waveform inversion is a successful procedure for determining properties\nof the earth from surface measurements in seismology. This inverse problem is\nsolved by a PDE constrained optimization where unknown coefficients in a\ncomputed wavefield are adjusted to minimize the mismatch with the measured\ndata. We propose using the Wasserstein metric, which is related to optimal\ntransport, for measuring this mismatch. Several advantageous properties are\nproved with regards to convexity of the objective function and robustness with\nrespect to noise. The Wasserstein metric is computed by solving a Monge-Ampere\nequation. We describe an algorithm for computing its Frechet gradient for use\nin the optimization. Numerical examples are given.\n", "  We study nonparaxial autofocusing beams with pre-engineered trajectories. We\nconsider the case of linearly polarized electric optical beams and examine\ntheir focusing properties such as contrast, beam width, and numerical aperture.\nSuch beams are associated with larger intensity contrasts, can focus at smaller\ndistances, and have smaller spot sizes as compared to the paraxial regime.\n", "  In a recent paper, Cho, Kim and Yoon (CKY) have proposed a version of the\nSU(2) $\\times$ U(1) Standard Model with finite-energy monopole and dyon\nsolutions. The CKY model postulates that the effective U(1) gauge coupling $\\to\n\\infty$ very rapidly as the Englert-Brout-Higgs vacuum expectation value $\\to\n0$, but in a way that is incompatible with LHC measurements of the Higgs boson\n$H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ decay rate. We construct generalizations of the CKY model\nthat are compatible with the $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ constraint, and calculate\nthe corresponding values of the monopole and dyon masses. We find that the\nmonopole mass could be $< 5.5$ TeV, so that it could be pair-produced at the\nLHC and accessible to the MoEDAL experiment.\n", "  We describe a new time-of-flight Fourier spectrometer for investigation of\nUCN diffraction by a moving grating. The device operates in the regime of a\ndiscrete set of modulation frequencies. The results of the first experiments\nshow that the spectrometer may be used for obtaining UCN energy spectra in the\nenergy range of 60$\\div$200 neV with a resolution of about 5 neV. The accuracy\nof determination of the line position was estimated to be several units of\n$10^{-10}$ eV\n", "  Observations in 2013 and 2014 of the Centaur 10199 Chariklo and its ring\nsystem consistently indicated that the radial width of the inner, more massive\nring varies with longitude. That strongly suggests that this ring has a finite\neccentricity despite the fast differential precession that Chariklo's large\nquadrupole moment should induce. If the inferred apse alignment is maintained\nby the ring's self-gravity, as it is for the Uranian rings, we estimate a ring\nmass of a few times 10^16 g and a typical particle size of a few meters. These\nimply a short collisional spreading time of ~10^5 years, somewhat shorter than\nthe typical Centaur dynamical lifetime of a few Myrs and much shorter than the\nage of the solar system. In light of this time constraint, we evaluate\npreviously suggested ring formation pathways including collisional ejection and\nsatellite disruption. We also investigate in detail a contrasting formation\nmechanism, the lofting of dust particles off Chariklo's surface into orbit via\noutflows of sublimating CO and/or N_2 triggered after Chariklo was scattered\ninward by giant planets. This latter scenario predicts that rings should be\ncommon among 100-km class Centaurs but rare among Kuiper belt objects and\nsmaller Centaurs. It also predicts that Centaurs should show seasonal\nvariations in cometary activity with activity maxima occurring shortly after\nequinox.\n", "  We study the production of two forward jets with a large interval of rapidity\nat hadron colliders, which was proposed by Mueller and Navelet as a possible\ntest of the high energy dynamics of QCD, within a complete next-to-leading\nlogarithm framework. We show that using the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie procedure\nto fix the renormalization scale leads to a very good description of the recent\nCMS data at the LHC for the azimuthal correlations of the jets. We show that\nthe inclusion of next-to-leading order corrections to the jet vertex\nsignificantly reduces the importance of energy-momentum non-conservation which\nis inherent to the BFKL approach, for an asymmetric jet configuration. Finally,\nwe argue that the double parton scattering contribution is negligible in the\nkinematics of actual CMS measurements.\n", "  Photoproduction of a pair of particles with large invariant mass is a natural\nextension of collinear QCD factorization theorems which have been much studied\nfor deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production. We\ndiscuss the production of a photon and a meson, where the wide angle Compton\nscattering on a meson subprocess factorizes from generalized parton\ndistribution. We calculate at dominant twist and leading order in $\\alpha_s$,\nthe production cross-section of a transversely polarized $\\rho$ meson which is\nsensitive to chiral-odd GPDs, and show that it may be measurable in near future\nJLab experiments.\n", "  We have made {\\it XMM-Newton\\/} observations of 14 Galactic Cepheids that\nhave candidate resolved ($\\geq$5$\\arcsec$) companion stars based on our earlier\n{\\it HST\\/} WFC3 imaging survey. Main-sequence stars that are young enough to\nbe physical companions of Cepheids are expected to be strong X-ray producers in\ncontrast to field stars. {\\it XMM-Newton\\/} exposures were set to detect\nessentially all companions hotter than spectral type M0 (corresponding to 0.5 $\nM_\\odot$.) The large majority of our candidate companions were not detected in\nX-rays, and hence are not confirmed as young companions. One resolved candidate\n(S~Nor \\#4) was unambiguously detected, but the Cepheid is a member of a\npopulous cluster. For this reason, it is likely that S~Nor \\#4 is a cluster\nmember rather than a gravitationally bound companion. Two further Cepheids\n(S~Mus and R~Cru) have X-ray emission that might be produced by either the\nCepheid or the candidate resolved companion. A subsequent {\\it Chandra}\nobservation of S Mus shows that the X-rays are at the location of the\nCepheid/spectroscopic binary. R Cru and also\n  V659 Cen (also X-ray bright) have possible companions closer than 5$\\arcsec$\n(the limit for this study) which are the likely source of X-rays. One final\nX-ray detection (V473 Lyr) has no known optical companion, so the prime suspect\nis the Cepheid itself. It is a unique Cepheid with a variable amplitude.\n", "  Force-Free Flectrodynamics (FFE) is a non-linear system of equations modeling\nthe evolution of the electromagnetic field, in the presence of a magnetically\ndominated relativistic plasma. This configuration arises on several\nastrophysical scenarios, which represent exciting laboratories to understand\nphysics in extreme regimes. We show that this system, when restricted to the\ncorrect constraint submanifold, is symmetric hyperbolic. In numerical\napplications is not feasible to keep the system in that submanifold, and so, it\nis necessary to analyze its structure first in the tangent space of that\nsubmanifold and then in a whole neighborhood of it. As already shown by\nPfeiffer, a direct (or naive) formulation of this system (in the whole tangent\nspace) results in a weakly hyperbolic system of evolution equations for which\nwell-possednes for the initial value formulation does not follows.\n  Using the generalized symmetric hyperbolic formalism due to Geroch, we\nintroduce here a covariant hyperbolization for the FFE system. In fact, in\nanalogy to the usual Maxwell case, a complete family of hyperbolizers is found,\nboth for the restricted system on the constraint submanifold as well as for a\nsuitably extended system defined in a whole neighborhood of it. A particular\nsymmetrizer among the family is then used to write down the pertaining\nevolution equations, in a generic ($3+1$)-decomposition on a background\nspacetime. Interestingly, it turns out that for a particular choice of the\nlapse and shift functions of the foliation, our symmetrized system reduces to\nthe one found by Pfeiffer. Finally we analyze the characteristic structure of\nthe resulting evolution system.\n", "  The recent observations of Singh et al. (2012) have shown multiple plasma\nejections and the intermittent nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar\nchromosphere, highlighting the need for fast reconnection to occur in highly\ncollisional plasma. However, the physical process through which fast magnetic\nreconnection occurs in partially ionized plasma, like the solar chromosphere,\nis still poorly understood. It has been shown that for sufficiently high\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers, Sweet-Parker current sheets can become unstable\nleading to tearing mode instability and plasmoid formation, but when dealing\nwith a partially ionized plasma the strength of coupling between the ions and\nneutrals plays a fundamental role in determining the dynamics of the system. We\npropose that as the reconnecting current sheet thins and the tearing\ninstability develops, plasmoid formation passes through strongly,\nintermediately, and weakly coupled (or decoupled) regimes, with the time scale\nfor the tearing mode instability depending on the frictional coupling between\nions and neutrals. We present calculations for the relevant time scales for\nfractal tearing in all three regimes. We show that as a result of the tearing\nmode instability and the subsequent non-linear instability due to the\nplasmoid-dominated reconnection, the Sweet-Parker current sheet tends to have a\nfractal-like structure, and when the chromospheric magnetic field is\nsufficiently strong the tearing instability can reach down to kinetic scales,\nwhich are hypothesized to be necessary for fast reconnection.\n", "  We present a systematic construction of bulk solutions that are dual to CFT\nexcited states. The bulk solution is constructed perturbatively in bulk fields.\nThe linearised solution is universal and depends only on the conformal\ndimension of the primary operator that is associated with the state via the\noperator-state correspondence, while higher order terms depend on detailed\nproperties of the operator, such as its OPE with itself and generally involve\nmany bulk fields. We illustrate the discussion with the holographic\nconstruction of the universal part of the solution for states of two\ndimensional CFTs, either on $R \\times S^1$ or on $R^{1,1}$. We compute the\n1-point function both in the CFT and in the bulk, finding exact agreement. We\ncomment on the relation with other reconstruction approaches.\n", "  I'll begin with a brief review of the triumph of Yang-Mills theory at\nparticle accelerators, a development that began some years after their historic\npaper. This story reached a culmination, or at least local extremum, with the\ndiscovery at the Large Hadron Collider of a Higgs-like scalar boson in 2012.\nThe talk then proceeds to a slightly more technical level, discussing how we\nderive predictions from the gauge field theories of the Standard Model and its\nextensions for use at high energy accelerators.\n", "  We present a generalized model to describe the lattice thermal conductivity\nof low-dimensional (low-D) and disordered systems. The model is a\nstraightforward generalization of the Debye-Peierls and Allen-Feldman schemes\nto arbitrary dimensions, accounting for low-D effects such as differences in\ndispersion, density of states, and scattering. Similar in spirit to the\nAllen-Feldman approach, heat carriers are categorized according to their\ntransporting capacity as propagons, diffusons, and locons. The results of the\ngeneralized model are compared to experimental results when available, and\nequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations otherwise. The results are in very\ngood agreement with our analysis of phonon localization in disordered low-D\nsystems, such as amorphous graphene and glassy diamond nanothreads. Several\nunique aspects of thermal transport in low-D and disordered systems, such as\nmilder suppression of thermal conductivity and negligble diffuson\ncontributions, are captured by the approach.\n", "  The recent discovery of GW150914, the binary black hole merger detected by\nAdvanced LIGO, has the potential to revolutionize observational astrophysics.\nBut to fully utilize this new window into the universe, we must compare these\nnew observations to detailed models of binary black hole formation throughout\ncosmic time. Expanding upon our previous work (Rodriguez et al., 2015), we\nstudy merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte\nCarlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster\nmodels with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize\nthe binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant\ndynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and\nthree-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N-body\nsimulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms\nwith updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions,\nallowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population\nsynthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We\nexplore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the\npopulation of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a\nnumerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black\nhole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius. We explore the masses and mass\nratios of these binaries as a function of redshift, and find a merger rate of\n~5 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the local universe, with 80% of sources having total\nmasses from $32M_{\\odot}$ to $64M_{\\odot}$. Under standard assumptions,\napproximately 1 out of every 7 binary black hole mergers in the local universe\nwill have originated in a globular cluster, but we also explore the sensitivity\nof this result to different assumptions for binary stellar evolution.\n[Abridged]\n", "  The superfluid to Mott insulator transition and the superradiant transition\nare textbook examples for quantum phase transition and coherent quantum optics,\nrespectively. Recent experiments in ETH and Hamburg succeeded in loading\ndegenerate bosonic atomic gases in optical lattices inside a cavity, which\nenables the first experimental study of the interplay between these two\ntransitions. In this letter we present the theoretical phase diagram for the\nETH experimental setup, and determine the phase boundaries and the orders of\nthe phase transitions between the normal superfluid phase, the superfluid with\nsuperradiant light, the normal Mott insulator and the Mott insulator with\nsuperradiant light. We find that in contrast to the second-order superradiant\ntransition in a weakly interacting Bose condensate, strong correlations in the\nsuperfluid nearby a Mott transition can render the superradiant transition to a\nfirst order one. Our results will stimulate further experimental studies of\ninteractions between cavity light and strongly interacting quantum matters.\n", "  The Dragonfish Nebula has been recently claimed to be powered by a\nsuperluminous but elusive OB association. Instead, systematic searches in\nnear-infrared photometric surveys have found many other cluster candidates on\nthis sky region. Among these, the first confirmed young massive cluster was\nMercer 30, where Wolf-Rayet stars were found. We perform a new characterization\nof Mercer 30 with unprecedented accuracy, combining NICMOS/HST and VVV\nphotometric data with multi-epoch ISAAC/VLT H- and K-band spectra. Stellar\nparameters for most of spectroscopically observed cluster members are found\nthrough precise non-LTE atmosphere modeling with the CMFGEN code. Our\nspectrophotometric study for this cluster yields a new, revised distance of d =\n(12.4 +- 1.7) kpc and a total of Q = 6.70 x 10^50 Lyman ionizing photons. A\ncluster age of (4.0 +- 0.8) Myr is found through isochrone fitting, and a total\nmass of (1.6 +- 0.6) x 10^4 Msol is estimated thanks to our extensive knowledge\nof the post-main-sequence population. As a consequence, membership of Mercer 30\nto the Dragonfish star-forming complex is confirmed, allowing us to use this\ncluster as a probe for the whole complex, which turns out to be extremely large\n(400 pc across) and located at the outer edge of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral\narm (11 kpc from the Galactic Center). The Dragonfish complex hosts 19 young\nclusters or cluster candidates (including Mercer 30 and a new candidate\npresented in this work) and an estimated minimum of 9 field Wolf-Rayet stars.\nThe sum of all these contributions accounts for, at least, 73% of the\nDragonfish Nebula ionization and leaves little or no room for the alleged\nsuperluminous OB association; alternative explanations are discussed.\n", "  We study, in the framework of the Landauer theory, the thermal emission in\nfar-field regime, of arbitrary indefinite planar media and finite size systems.\nWe prove that the flux radiated by the former is bounded by the blackbody\nemission while, for the second, there is in principle, no upper limit\ndemonstrating so the possibility for a super-Planckian thermal emission with\nfinite size systems.\n", "  An attractive candidate for the inflaton is an axion slowly rolling down a\nflat potential protected by a perturbative shift symmetry. Realisations of this\nidea within large field, natural and monomial inflation have been disfavoured\nby observations and are difficult to embed in string theory. We show that\nsubleading, but significant non-perturbative corrections can superimpose sharp\ncliffs and gentle plateaus into the potential, whose overall effect is to\nenhance the number of e-folds of inflation. Sufficient e-folds are therefore\nachieved for smaller field ranges compared to the potential without such\ncorrections. Thus, both single-field natural and monomial inflation in UV\ncomplete theories like string theory, can be restored into the favour of\ncurrent observations, with distinctive signatures. Tensor modes result\nun-observably small, but there is a large negative running of the spectral\nindex. Remarkably, natural inflation can be achieved with a single field whose\naxion decay constant is sub-Planckian.\n", "  Eighty years ago Einstein demonstrated that a particular interpretation of\nthe reduction of wave function led to a paradox and that this paradox\ndisappeared if statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics was adopted.\nAccording to the statistical interpretation a wave function describes only an\nensemble of identically prepared physical systems. Searching for an intuitive\nexplanation of long range correlations between outcomes of distant\nmeasurements, performed on pairs of physical systems prepared in a spin singlet\nstate, John Bell analysed local realistic hidden variable models and proved\nthat correlations consistent with these models satisfy Bell inequalities which\nare violated by some predictions of quantum mechanics. Several different local\nmodels were constructed, various inequalities proven and shown to be violated\nby experimental data. Some physicists concluded that Nature is definitely not\nlocal. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we critically analyze some\ninfluential finite sample proofs of various inequalities and so called quantum\nRandi challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell game.The\nviolation of inequalities does not prove that local and causal explanation of\ncorrelations is impossible. The violation of inequalities gives only a strong\nargument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view\naccording to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random\nway. We also explain the meaning of sample homogeneity loophole and show how it\ncan invalidate statistical significance tests. We point out that this loophole\nwas not closed in several recent experiments testing local realism.\n", "  A microscopic approach is developed to compute the excitonic properties and\nthe corresponding terahertz response for semiconductors characterized by\nanisotropic effective masses. The approach is illustrated for the example of\ngermanium where it is shown that the anisotropic electron mass in the L-valley\nleads to two distinct terahertz absorption resonances separated by 0.8 meV.\n", "  We apply a generalized Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formulation to\nestablish a connection between the gauge-fixed $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills (YM) theories\nformulated in the Lorenz gauge and in the Maximal Abelian (MA) gauge. It is\nshown that the generating functional corresponding to the Faddeev-Popov (FP)\neffective action in the MA gauge can be obtained from that in the Lorenz gauge\nby carrying out an appropriate finite and field-dependent BRST (FFBRST)\ntransformation. In this procedure, the FP effective action in the MA gauge is\nfound from that in the Lorenz gauge by incorporating the contribution of\nnon-trivial Jacobian due to the FFBRST transformation of the path integral\nmeasure. The present FFBRST formulation might be useful to see how Abelian\ndominance in the MA gauge is realized in the Lorenz gauge.\n", "  Nanoscale control of charge doping in two-dimensional (2D) materials permits\nthe realization of electronic analogs of optical phenomena, relativistic\nphysics at low energies, and technologically promising nanoelectronics.\nElectrostatic gating and chemical doping are the two most common methods to\nachieve local control of such doping. However, these approaches suffer from\ncomplicated fabrication processes that introduce contamination, change material\nproperties irreversibly, and lack flexible pattern control. Here we demonstrate\na clean, simple, and reversible technique that permits writing, reading, and\nerasing of doping patterns for 2D materials at the nanometer scale. We\naccomplish this by employing a graphene/boron nitride (BN) heterostructure that\nis equipped with a bottom gate electrode. By using electron transport and\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate that spatial control of\ncharge doping can be realized with the application of either light or STM tip\nvoltage excitations in conjunction with a gate electric field. Our\nstraightforward and novel technique provides a new path towards on-demand\ngraphene pn junctions and ultra-thin memory devices.\n", "  By driving a 3D transmon with microwave fields, we generate an effective\navoided energy-level crossing. Then we chirp microwave frequency, which is\nequivalent to driving the system through the avoided energy-level crossing by\nsweeping the avoided crossing. A double-passage chirp produces\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana interference that agree well with the\nnumerical results. Our method is fully applicable to other quantum systems that\ncontain no intrinsic avoided level crossing, providing an alternative approach\nfor quantum control and quantum simulation.\n", "  We study optomechanical interactions in non-Hermitian photonic molecules that\nsupport two photonic states and one acoustic mode. The nonlinear steady-state\nsolutions and their linear stability landscapes are investigated as a function\nof the system's parameters and excitation power levels. We also examine the\ntemporal evolution of the system and uncover different regimes of nonlinear\ndynamics. Our analysis reveals several important results: (1) Parity-time\n($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is not necessarily the optimum choice for maximum\noptomechanical interaction. (2) Stable steady-state solutions are not always\nreached under continuous wave (CW) optical excitations. (3) Accounting for gain\nsaturation effects can regulate the behavior of the otherwise unbounded\noscillation amplitudes. Our study provides a deeper insight into the interplay\nbetween optical non-Hermiticity and optomechanical coupling and can thus pave\nthe way for new device applications.\n", "  We have analyzed XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the transient\nmagnetar XTE J1810-197, spanning more than 11 years, from the initial phases of\nthe 2003 outburst to the current quiescent level. We investigated the evolution\nof the pulsar spin period and we found evidence for two distinct regimes:\nduring the outburst decay, the spin derivative (nu_dot) was highly variable in\nthe range -(2-4.5)x10^-13 Hz/s, while during quiescence the spin-down rate was\nmore stable at an average value of -1x10^{-13} Hz/s. Only during ~3000 days\n(from MJD 54165 to MJD 56908) in the quiescent stage, it was possible to find a\nphase-connected timing solution, with nu_dot = -4.9x10^{-14} Hz/s, and a\npositive second frequency derivative, nu_dotdot = 1.8x10^{-22} Hz/s. These\nresults are in agreement with the behavior expected if the outburst of XTE\nJ1810-197 was due to a strong magnetospheric twist.\n", "  Strong topological insulators may have nonzero weak indices. The nonzero weak\nindices allow for the existence of topologically protected helical states along\nline defects of the lattice. If the lattice admits line defects that connect\nopposite surfaces of a slab of such a \"weak-and-strong\" topological insulator,\nthese states effectively connect the surface states at opposite surfaces.\nDepending on the phases accumulated along the dislocation lines, this\nconnection results in a suppression of in-plane transport and the opening of a\nspectral gap or in an enhanced density of states and an increased conductivity.\n", "  HAT-P-13b is a Jupiter-mass transiting exoplanet that has settled onto a\nstable, short-period, and mildly eccentric orbit as a consequence of the action\nof tidal dissipation and perturbations from a second, highly eccentric, outer\ncompanion. Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the\nmagnitude of HAT-P-13b's eccentricity ($e_b$) is in part dictated by its Love\nnumber ($k_{2_b}$), which is in turn a proxy for the degree of central mass\nconcentration in its interior. Thus, the measurement of $e_b$ constrains\n$k_{2_b}$ and allows us to place otherwise elusive constraints on the mass of\nHAT-P-13b's core ($M_{\\rm{core,b}}$). In this study we derive new constraints\non the value of $e_b$ by observing two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b with the\nInfrared Array Camera on board the $\\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}$. We fit\nthe measured secondary eclipse times simultaneously with radial velocity\nmeasurements and find that $e_b = 0.00700 \\pm 0.00100$. We then use\noctupole-order secular perturbation theory to find the corresponding $k_{2_b} =\n0.31^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$. Applying structural evolution models, we then find, with\n68\\% confidence, that $M_{\\rm{core,b}}$ is less than 25 Earth masses\n($M_{\\oplus}$). The most likely value of $M_{\\rm{core,b}} = 11 M_{\\oplus}$,\nwhich is similar to the core mass theoretically required for runaway gas\naccretion. This is the tightest constraint to date on the core mass of a hot\nJupiter. Additionally, we find that the measured secondary eclipse depths,\nwhich are in the 3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m bands, best match atmospheric model\npredictions with a dayside temperature inversion and relatively efficient\nday-night circulation.\n", "  Recent high-resolution infrared space missions have revealed supernova\nremnants (SNRs) of diverse morphology in infrared (IR) dust emission that is\noften very different from their X-ray appearance. The observed range of\ninfrared-to-X-ray (IRX) flux ratios of SNRs are also wide. For a sample of 20\nGalactic SNRs, we obtain their IR and X-ray properties and investigate the\nphysical causes for such large differences. We find that the observed IRX flux\nratios ($R_{IRX.obs}$) are related to the IRX morphology, with SNRs with the\nlargest $R_{IRX,obs}$ showing anticorrelated IRX morphology. By analyzing the\nrelation of $R_{IRX,obs}$ to X-ray and IR parameters, we show that the\n$R_{IRX,obs}$ of some SNRs agree with theoretical ratios of SNR shocks in which\ndust grains are heated and destroyed by collisions with plasma particles. For\nthe majority of SNRs, however, $R_{IRX,obs}$ values are either significantly\nsmaller or significantly larger than the theoretical ratios. The latter SNRs\nhave relatively low dust temperatures. We discuss how the natural and/or\nenvironmental properties of SNRs could have affected the IRX flux ratios and\nthe IRX morphology of these SNRs. We conclude that the SNRs with largest\n$R_{IRX,obs}$ are probably located in dense environment and that their IR\nemission is from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions. Our\nresult suggests that the IRX flux ratio, together with dust temperature, can be\nused to infer the nature of unresolved SNRs in external galaxies.\n", "  We report new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), 0$\"$.5 angular\nresolution observations of linearly polarized continuum emission at 6.9 mm,\ntowards the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) NGC1333 IRAS4A. This target\nsource is a collapsing dense molecular core, which was resolved at short\nwavelengths to have hourglass shaped B-field configuration. We compare these\n6.9 mm observations with previous polarization Submillimeter Array (SMA)\nobservations at 0.88 mm, which have comparable angular resolution\n($\\sim$0$\"$7). We found that at the same resolution, the observed polarization\nposition angles at 6.9 mm are slightly deviated from those observed at 0.88 mm.\nDue to the lower optical depth of the emission at 6.9 mm, and the potential\neffect of dust grain growth, the new JVLA observations are likely probing\nB-field alignments in regions interior to those sampled by the previous\npolarization observations at higher frequencies. Our understanding can be\nimproved by more sensitive observations, and observations for the more extended\nspatial scales.\n", "  We consider the performance of periodically driven stochastic heat engines in\nthe linear response regime. Reaching the theoretical bounds for efficiency and\nefficiency at maximum power typically requires full control over the design and\nthe driving of the system. We develop a framework which allows to quantify the\nrole that limited control over the system has on the performance. Specifically,\nwe show that optimizing the driving entering the work extraction for a given\ntemperature protocol leads to a universal, one-parameter dependence for both\nmaximum efficiency and maximum power as a function of efficiency. In\nparticular, we show that reaching Carnot efficiency (and, hence, Curzon-Ahlborn\nefficiency at maximum power) requires to have control over the amplitude of the\nfull Hamiltonian of the system. Since the kinetic energy cannot be controlled\nby an external parameter, heat engines based on underdamped dynamics can\ntypically not reach Carnot efficiency. We illustrate our general theory with a\nparadigmatic case study of a heat engine consisting of an underdamped charged\nparticle in a modulated two-dimensional harmonic trap in the presence of a\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We discuss the role of gluon poles and the gauge invariance for the hadron\ntensors of Drell-Yan and direct photon production processes with the\ntransversely polarized hadron.\n", "  We critically assess recent claims suggesting that upper limits on the time\nvariation of the fine-structure constant tightly constrain the coupling of a\ndark energy scalar field to the electromagnetic sector, and, indirectly, the\nviolation of the weak equivalence principle. We show that such constraints\ndepend crucially on the assumed priors, even if the dark energy was described\nby a dynamical scalar field with a constant equation of state parameter $w$\nlinearly coupled to the electromagnetic sector through a dimensionless coupling\n$\\zeta$. We find that, although local atomic clock tests, as well as other\nterrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological data, put stringent bounds on\n$|\\zeta| {\\sqrt {|w+1|}}$, the time variation of the fine-structure constant\ncannot be used to set or to improve upper limits on $|\\zeta|$ or $|w+1|$\nwithout specifying priors, consistent but not favoured by current data, which\nstrongly disfavour low values of $|w+1|$ or $|\\zeta|$, respectively. We briefly\ndiscuss how this might change with a new generation of high-resolution\nultra-stable spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO and ELT-HIRES, in combination with\nforthcoming missions to map the geometry of the Universe, such as Euclid, or to\ntest the equivalence principle, such as MICROSCOPE or STEP.\n", "  We study the superconductor to insulator transition at zero temperature in a\nJosephson-junction array model on a honeycomb lattice with $f$ flux quantum per\nplaquette. The path integral representation of the model corresponds to a\n(2+1)-dimensional classical model, which is used to investigate the critical\nbehavior by extensive Monte Carlo simulations on large system sizes. In\ncontrast to the model on a square lattice, the transition is found to be first\norder for $f=1/3$ and continuous for $f=1/2$ but in a different universality\nclass. The correlation-length critical exponent is estimated from finite-size\nscaling of vortex correlations. The estimated universal conductivity at the\ntransition is approximately four times its value for $f=0$. The results are\ncompared with experimental observations on ultrathin superconducting films with\na triangular lattice of nanoholes in a transverse magnetic field.\n", "  We discuss the prospects of eLISA for detecting gravitational waves (GWs)\nfrom Galactic binary black holes (BBHs) similar to GW150914. For a comoving\nmerger rate that is consistent with current observation, eLISA is likely to\nidentify at least one BBH with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. In addition,\neLISA has a potential to measure the eccentricity of the BBH as small as $e\\sim\n0.02$, corresponding to the residual value $e\\sim 10^{-6}$ at 10Hz. Therefore,\neLISA could provide us with a crucial information to understand the formation\nprocesses of relatively massive BBHs like GW150914. We also derive a simple\nscaling relation for the expected number of detectable Galactic BBHs.\n", "  The filamentary structure of the molecular interstellar medium and the\npotential link of this morphology to star formation have been brought into\nfocus recently by high resolution observational surveys. An especially puzzling\nmatter is that local interstellar filaments appear to have the same thickness,\nindependent of their column density. This requires a theoretical understanding\nof their formation process and the physics that governs their evolution. In\nthis work we explore a scenario in which filaments are dissipative structures\nof the large-scale interstellar turbulence cascade and ion-neutral friction\n(also called ambipolar diffusion) is affecting their sizes by preventing\nsmall-scale compressions. We employ high-resolution, 3D MHD simulations,\nperformed with the grid code RAMSES, to investigate non-ideal MHD turbulence as\na filament formation mechanism. We focus the analysis on the mass and thickness\ndistributions of the resulting filamentary structures. Simulations of both\ndriven and decaying MHD turbulence show that the morphologies of the density\nand the magnetic field are different when ambipolar diffusion is included in\nthe models. In particular, the densest structures are broader and more massive\nas an effect of ion-neutral friction and the power spectra of both the velocity\nand the density steepen at a smaller wavenumber. The comparison between ideal\nand non-ideal MHD simulations shows that ambipolar diffusion causes a shift of\nthe filament thickness distribution towards higher values. However, none of the\ndistributions exhibit the pronounced peak found in the observed local\nfilaments. Limitations in dynamical range and the absence of self-gravity in\nthese numerical experiments do not allow us to conclude at this time whether\nthis is due to the different filament selection or due to the physics inherent\nof the filament formation.\n", "  Interferometry of the cosmic 21-cm signal is set to revolutionize our\nunderstanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), eventually providing 3D maps\nof the early Universe. Initial detections however will be low signal-to-noise,\nlimited by systematics. To confirm a putative 21-cm detection, and check the\naccuracy of 21-cm data analysis pipelines, it would be very useful to\ncross-correlate against a genuine cosmological signal. The most promising\ncosmological signals are wide-field maps of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies\n(LAEs), expected from the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Ultra-Deep field. Here\nwe present estimates of the correlation between LAE maps at z~7 and the 21-cm\nsignal observed by both the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the planned Square\nKilometer Array Phase 1 (SKA1). We adopt a systematic approach, varying both:\n(i) the prescription of assigning LAEs to host halos; and (ii) the large-scale\nstructure of neutral and ionized regions (i.e. EoR morphology). We find that\nthe LAE-21cm cross-correlation is insensitive to (i), thus making it a robust\nprobe of the EoR. A 1000h observation with LOFAR would be sufficient to\ndiscriminate at >1 standard deviation a fully ionized Universe from one with a\nmean neutral fraction of xHI~0.50, using the LAE-21cm cross-correlation\nfunction on scales of R~3-10 Mpc. Unlike LOFAR, whose detection of the LAE-21cm\ncross-correlation is limited by noise, SKA1 is mostly limited by ignorance of\nthe EoR morphology. However, the planned 100h wide-field SKA1-Low survey will\nbe sufficient to discriminate an ionized Universe from one with xHI~0.25, even\nwith maximally pessimistic assumptions.\n", "  We propose a new class of natural inflation models based on a hidden scale\ninvariance. In a very generic Wilsonian effective field theory with an\narbitrary number of scalar fields, which exhibits scale invariance via the\ndilaton, the potential necessarily contains a flat direction in the classical\nlimit. This flat direction is lifted by small quantum corrections and inflation\nis realised without need for an unnatural fine-tuning. In the conformal limit,\nthe effective potential becomes linear in the inflaton field, yielding to\nspecific predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nbeing respectively: $n_s-1\\approx -0.025\\left(\\frac{N_{\\star}}{60}\\right)^{-1}$\nand $r\\approx 0.0667\\left(\\frac{N_{\\star}}{60}\\right)^{-1}$, where\n$N_{\\star}\\approx 30-65$ is a number of efolds during observable inflation.\nThis predictions are in reasonable agreement with cosmological measurements.\nFurther improvement of the accuracy of these measurements may turn out to be\ncritical in falsifying our scenario.\n", "  We investigate the magnetohydrodynamics in the presence of an external\nmagnetic field following the power-law decay in proper time and having spatial\ninhomogeneity characterized by a Gaussian distribution in one of transverse\ncoordinates under the Bjorken expansion. The leading-order solution is obtained\nin the weak-field approximation, where both energy density and fluid velocity\nare modified. It is found that the spatial gradient of the magnetic field\nresults in transverse flow, where the flow direction depends on the decay\nexponents of the magnetic field. We suggest that such a magnetic-field-induced\neffect might influence anisotropic flow in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  It is argued that standard quantum theory without collapse provides a\nsatisfactory explanation of everything we experience in this and in numerous\nparallel worlds. The only fundamental ontology is the universal wave function\nevolving in a deterministic way without action at a distance.\n", "  We derive general conditions for the existence of stable scaling solutions\nfor the evolution of noncanonical quintessence, with a Lagrangian of the form\n$\\mathcal{L}(X,\\phi)=X^{\\alpha}-V(\\phi)$, for power-law and exponential\npotentials when the expansion is dominated by a background barotropic fluid.\nOur results suggest that in most cases, noncanonical quintessence with such\npotentials does not yield interesting models for the observed dark energy. When\nthe scaling solution is not an attractor, there is a wide range of model\nparameters for which the evolution asymptotically resembles a zero-potential\nsolution with equation of state parameter $w = 1/(2\\alpha -1)$, and oscillatory\nsolutions are also possible for positive power-law potentials; we derive the\nconditions on the model parameters which produce both types of behavior. We\ninvestigate thawing noncanonical models with a nearly-flat potential and derive\napproximate expressions for the evolution of $w(a)$. These forms for $w(a)$\ndiffer in a characteristic way from the corresponding expressions for canonical\nquintessence.\n", "  For a long time it was believed there was no reason to include the\ngeometrical phase in studying the propagation of gaussian optical beams through\ndielectric blocks. This can be justified by the fact that the first order term\nin the Taylor expansion of this phase is responsible for the lateral shift of\nthe optical beam which is also predicted by ray optics. From this point of\nview, the geometrical phase can be seen as a purely auxiliary concept. In this\npaper, we show how the second order term in the Taylor expansion accounts for\nthe symmetry breaking of the transversal spatial distribution and acts as an\naxial spreading modifier. These new effects clearly shows the importance of the\ngeometrical phase in describing the correct behavior of light. To test our\ntheoretical predictions, we briefly discuss a possible experimental\nimplementation.\n", "  Many studies have shown that additional information can be gained on time\nseries by investigating their associated complex networks. In this work, we\ninvestigate the multifractal property and Laplace spectrum of the horizontal\nvisibility graphs (HVGs) constructed from fractional Brownian motions. We aim\nto identify via simulation and curve fitting the form of these properties in\nterms of the Hurst index $H$. First, we use the sandbox algorithm to study the\nmultifractality of these HVGs. It is found that multifractality exists in these\nHVGs. We find that the average fractal dimension $\\langle D(0)\\rangle$ of HVGs\napproximately satisfies the prominent linear formula $\\langle D(0)\\rangle = 2 -\nH$; while the average information dimension $\\langle D(1)\\rangle$ and average\ncorrelation dimension $\\langle D(2)\\rangle$ are all approximately bi-linear\nfunctions of $H$ when $H\\ge 0.15$. Then, we calculate the spectrum and energy\nfor the general Laplacian operator and normalized Laplacian operator of these\nHVGs. We find that, for the general Laplacian operator, the average logarithm\nof second-smallest eigenvalue $\\langle \\ln (u_2) \\rangle$, the average\nlogarithm of third-smallest eigenvalue $\\langle \\ln (u_3) \\rangle$, and the\naverage logarithm of maximum eigenvalue $\\langle \\ln (u_n) \\rangle$ of these\nHVGs are approximately linear functions of $H$; while the average Laplacian\nenergy $\\langle E_{nL} \\rangle$ is approximately a quadratic polynomial\nfunction of $H$. For the normalized Laplacian operator, $\\langle \\ln (u_2)\n\\rangle$ and $\\langle \\ln (u_3) \\rangle$ of these HVGs approximately satisfy\nlinear functions of $H$; while $\\langle \\ln (u_n) \\rangle$ and $\\langle E_{nL}\n\\rangle$ are approximately a 4th and cubic polynomial function of $H$\nrespectively.\n", "  Simulation studies of the atomic shear stress in the local potential energy\nminima (inherent structures) are reported for binary liquid mixtures in 2D and\n3D. These inherent structure stresses are fundamental to slow stress relaxation\nand high viscosity in supercooled liquids. We find that the atomic shear stress\nin the inherent structures (IS) of both liquids at rest exhibits slowly\ndecaying anisotropic correlations. We show that the stress correlations\ncontributes significantly to the variance of the total shear stress of the IS\nconfigurations and consider the origins of the anisotropy and spatial extent of\nthe stress correlations.\n", "  The present theoretical study proposes the enhanced interaction of\nnanostructures with monosaccharides. It has been demonstrated that the\ninteractions with and without metal adsorption do in fact show that the\nadsorption energies change accordingly. It is important to note that the\nchemistry of reactions can also be influenced as a result of this change in\ndynamics.\n", "  During the formation of stars, the accretion of the surrounding material\ntoward the central object is thought to undergo strong luminosity outbursts,\nfollowed by long periods of relative quiescence, even at the early stages of\nstar formation when the protostar is still embedded in a large envelope. We\ninvestigated the gas phase formation and the recondensation of the complex\norganic molecules (COMs) di-methyl ether and methyl formate, induced by sudden\nice evaporation processes occurring during luminosity outbursts of different\namplitudes in protostellar envelopes. For this purpose, we updated a gas phase\nchemical network forming complex organic molecules in which ammonia plays a key\nrole. The model calculations presented here demonstrate that ion-molecule\nreactions alone could account for the observed presence of di-methyl ether and\nmethyl formate in a large fraction of protostellar cores, without recourse to\ngrain-surface chemistry, although they depend on uncertain ice abundances and\ngas phase reaction branching ratios. In spite of the short outburst timescales\nof about one hundred years, abundance ratios of the considered species with\nrespect to methanol higher than 10 % are predicted during outbursts due to\ntheir low binding energies relative to water and methanol that delay their\nrecondensation during the cooling. Although the current luminosity of most\nembedded protostars would be too low to produce these complex species in hot\ncore regions that can be observable with current sub-millimetric\ninterferometers, previous luminosity outburst events would induce a formation\nof COMs in extended regions of protostellar envelopes with sizes increasing by\nup to one order of magnitude.\n", "  We study the optical properties of hydrogen passivated silicon, germanium and\nmixed Ge/Si core/shell quantum dots (QDs) using high accuracy Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDFT). We employ the hybrid DFT\nfunctional of Becke, Lee, Yang and Parr (B3LYP) in combination with good\nquality basis sets. As we have shown in our previous work, this combination is\nan accurate and computationally efficient way for such calculations. The mixed\nquantum dots, as would be expected, are more versatile and offer more\npossibilities for band gap engineering, with gap values (electronic and\noptical) between those of the corresponding Si and Ge dots. Our results support\nthe quantum confinement theory for all three types of QDs.\n", "  White dwarfs accreting from helium stars can stably burn at the accreted rate\nand avoid the challenge of mass loss associated with unstable Helium burning\nthat is a concern for many Type Ia supernovae scenarios. We study binaries with\nhelium stars of mass $1.25 M_\\odot\\le M_{\\rm{He}} \\le 1.8 M_\\odot$, which have\nlost their hydrogen rich envelopes in an earlier common envelope event and now\norbit with periods ($P_{\\rm orb}$) of several hours with non-rotating $0.84$\nand $1.0 M_\\odot$ C/O WDs. The helium stars fill their Roche lobes (RLs) after\nexhaustion of central helium and donate helium on their thermal timescales\n(${\\sim}10^5$yr). As shown by others, these mass transfer rates coincide with\nthe steady helium burning range for WDs, and grow the WD core up to near the\nChandrasekhar mass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$) and a core carbon ignition. We show here,\nhowever, that many of these scenarios lead to an ignition of hot carbon ashes\nnear the outer edge of the WD and an inward going carbon flame that does not\ncause an explosive outcome. For $P_{\\rm orb} = 3$ hours, $1.0 M_\\odot$ C/O WDs\nwith donor masses $M_{\\rm He}\\gtrsim1.8 M_\\odot$ experience a shell carbon\nignition, while $M_{\\rm He}\\lesssim1.3 M_\\odot$ will fall below the steady\nhelium burning range and undergo helium flashes before reaching core C\nignition. Those with $1.3 M_\\odot \\lesssim M_{\\rm He} \\lesssim 1.7 M_\\odot$\nwill experience a core C ignition. We also calculate the retention fraction of\naccreted helium when the accretion rate leads to recurrent weak helium flashes.\n", "  We present a multi-epoch X-ray spectral analysis of the Seyfert 1 galaxy\nFairall 9. Our analysis shows that Fairall 9 displays unique spectral\nvariability in that its ratio residuals to a simple absorbed power law in the\n0.5-10 keV band remain constant with time in spite of large variations in flux.\nThis behavior implies an unchanging source geometry and the same emission\nprocesses continuously at work at the timescale probed. With the constraints\nfrom NuSTAR on the broad-band spectral shape, it is clear that the soft excess\nin this source is a superposition of two different processes, one being blurred\nionized reflection in the innermost parts of the accretion disk, and the other\na continuum component such as spatially distinct Comptonizing region.\nAlternatively, a more complex primary Comptonization component together with\nblurred ionized reflection could be responsible.\n", "  Motivated by apparent persistent large scale anomalies in the CMB we study\nthe influence of fermionic degrees of freedom on the dynamics of inflaton\nfluctuations as a possible source of violations of (nearly) scale invariance on\ncosmological scales. We obtain the non-equilibrium effective action of an\ninflaton-like scalar field with Yukawa interactions ($Y_{D,M}$) to light\n\\emph{fermionic} degrees of freedom both for Dirac and Majorana fields in de\nSitter space-time. The effective action leads to Langevin equations of motion\nfor the fluctuations of the inflaton-like field, with self-energy corrections\nand a stochastic gaussian noise. We solve the Langevin equation in the\nsuper-Hubble limit implementing a dynamical renormalization group resummation.\nFor a nearly massless inflaton its power spectrum of super Hubble fluctuations\nis \\emph{enhanced}, $\\mathcal{P}(k;\\eta) =\n(\\frac{H}{2\\pi})^2\\,e^{\\gamma_t[-k\\eta] }$ with $\\gamma_t[-k\\eta] =\n\\frac{1}{6\\pi^2}\n\\Big[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_D}{Y^2_{i,D}}+2\\sum_{j=1}^{N_M}{Y^2_{j,M}}\\Big]\\,\\Big\\{\\ln^2[-k\\eta]-2\n\\ln[-k\\eta]\\ln[ -k\\eta_0] \\Big\\} $ for $N_D$ Dirac and $N_M$ Majorana fermions,\nand $\\eta_0$ is the renormalization scale at which the inflaton mass vanishes.\nThe full power spectrum is shown to be renormalization group invariant. These\ncorrections to the super-Hubble power spectrum entail a violation of scale\ninvariance as a consequence of the coupling to the fermionic fields. The\neffective action is argued to be \\emph{exact} in a limit of large number of\nfermionic fields. A cancellation between the enhancement from fermionic degrees\nof freedom and suppression from light scalar degrees of freedom\n\\emph{conformally coupled to gravity} suggests the possibility of a finely\ntuned \\emph{supersymmetry} among these fields.\n", "  We examine the spectroscopic binary population for two massive nearby regions\nof clustered star formation, the Orion Nebula Cluster and NGC 2264,\nsupplementing the data presented by Tobin et al. (2009, 2015) with more recent\nobservations and more extensive analysis. The inferred multiplicity fraction up\nto 10 AU based on these observations is $5.3\\pm 1.2$% for NGC 2264 and $5.8\\pm\n1.1$% for the ONC; they are consistent with the distribution of binaries in the\nfield in the relevant parameter range. Eight of the multiple systems in the\nsample have enough epochs to make an initial fit for the orbital parameters.\nTwo of these sources are double-lined spectroscopic binaries; for them we\ndetermine the mass ratio. Our reanalysis of the distribution of stellar radial\nvelocities towards these clusters presents a significantly better agreement\nbetween stellar and gas kinematics than was previously thought.\n", "  A new computationally efficient method has been introduced to treat\nself-gravity in mesh based hydrodynamical simulations. It is applied simply by\nslightly modifying the Poisson equation into an inhomogeneous wave equation.\nThis roughly corresponds to the weak field limit of the Einstein equations in\ngeneral relativity, and as long as the gravitation propagation speed is taken\nto be larger than the hydrodynamical characteristic speed, the results agree\nwith solutions for the Poisson equation. The solutions almost perfectly agree\nif the domain is taken large enough, or appropriate boundary conditions are\ngiven. Our new method can not only significantly reduce the computational time\ncompared with existent methods, but is also fully compatible with massive\nparallel computation, nested grids and adaptive mesh refinement techniques, all\nof which can accelerate the progress in computational astrophysics and\ncosmology.\n", "  Axion electrodynamics, first proposed in the context of particle physics,\nmanifests itself in condensed matter physics in the topological field theory\ndescription of 3d topological insulators and gives rise to magnetoelectric\neffect, where applying magnetic (electric) field $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{E})$\ninduces polarization (magnetization) $\\mathbf{p}(\\mathbf{m})$. We use linear\nresponse theory to study the associated topological current using the\nFu-Kane-Mele model of 3d topological insulators in the presence of\ntime-dependent uniform weak magnetic field. By computing the dynamical current\nsusceptibility $\\chi^{\\mathbf{j}_p\\mathbf{j}_p}_{ij}(\\omega)$, we discover from\nits static limit an `order parameter' of the topological phase transition\nbetween weak topological (or ordinary) insulator and strong topological\ninsulator, found to be continuous. The\n$\\chi^{\\mathbf{j}_p\\mathbf{j}_p}_{ij}(\\omega)$ shows a sign-changing\nsingularity at a critical frequency with suppressed strength in the topological\ninsulating state. Our results can be verified in current noise experiment on 3d\nTI candidate materials for the detection of such topological phase transition.\n", "  It has been found that in the media where the dielectric permittivity\n$\\epsilon$ or the magnetic permeability $\\mu$ is near zero and in transition\nmetamaterials where $\\epsilon$ or $\\mu$ changes from positive to negative\nvalues, there occur a strong absorption or amplification of the electromagnetic\nwave energy in the presence of an infinitesimally small damping or gain and a\nstrong enhancement of the electromagnetic fields. We attribute these phenomena\nto the mode conversion of transverse electromagnetic waves into longitudinal\nplasma oscillations and its inverse process. In this paper, we study analogous\nphenomena occurring in chiral media theoretically using the invariant imbedding\nmethod. In uniform isotropic chiral media, right-circularly-polarized and\nleft-circularly-polarized waves are the eigenmodes of propagation with\ndifferent effective refractive indices $n_+$ and $n_-$, whereas in the chiral\nmedia with a nonuniform impedance variation, they are no longer the eigenmodes\nand are coupled to each other. We find that both in uniform chiral slabs where\neither $n_+$ or $n_-$ is near zero and in chiral transition metamaterials where\n$n_+$ or $n_-$ changes from positive to negative values, a strong absorption or\namplification of circularly-polarized waves occurs in the presence of an\ninfinitesimally small damping or gain. We present detailed calculations of the\nmode conversion coefficient, which measures the fraction of the electromagnetic\nwave energy absorbed into the medium, for various configurations of $\\epsilon$\nand $\\mu$ with an emphasis on the influence of a nonuniform impedance. We\npropose possible applications of these phenomena to linear and nonlinear\noptical devices that react selectively to the helicity of the circular\npolarization.\n", "  Here we derive a Parker-wind like solution for a stratified, plane-parallel\natmosphere undergoing photoionisation. The difference compared to the standard\nParker solar wind is that the sonic point is crossed only at infinity. The\nsimplicity of the analytic solution makes it a convenient test problem for\nnumerical simulations of photoevaporation in protoplanetary discs.\n", "  We consider a quasi-one-dimensional two-component Bose-Einstein condensate\nsubject to a coherent coupling between its components, such as realized in\nspin-orbit coupled condensates. We study how nonlinearity modifies the dynamics\nof the elementary excitations. The spectrum has two branches which are affected\nin different ways. The upper branch experiences a modulational instability\nwhich is stabilized by a long wave-short wave resonance with the lower branch.\nThe lower branch is stable. In the limit of weak nonlinearity and small\ndispersion it is described by a Korteweg-de Vries equation or by the Gardner\nequation, depending on the value of the parameters of the system.\n", "  We explore the photon population dynamics in two coupled circuit QED systems.\nFor a sufficiently weak inter-cavity photon hopping, as the photon-cavity\ncoupling increases, the dynamics undergoes double transitions first from a\ndelocalized to a localized phase and then from the localized to another\ndelocalized phase. The latter delocalized phase is distinguished from the\nformer one; instead of oscillating between the two cavities, the photons\nrapidly quasi-equilibrate over the two cavities. These intrigues are attributed\nto an interplay between two qualitatively distinctive nonlinear behaviors of\nthe circuit QED systems in the utrastrong coupling regime, whose distinction\nhas been widely overlooked.\n", "  Millisecond magnetars can be formed via several channels: core-collapse of\nmassive stars, accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs (WDs), double WD\nmergers, double neutron star (NS) mergers, and WD-NS mergers. Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession. We treat the photosphere\nand nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different. In some\ncases the ejecta could be light enough that the magnetar can accelerate it to a\nrelativistic speed. It is well known that the peak luminosity of a supernova\n(SN) occurs when the luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input\nrate, as shown by Arnett (1979). We show that photospheric recession and\nrelativistic motion can modify this law. The photospheric recession always\nleads to a delay of the peak time $t_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ relative to the time\n$t_{\\times }$ at which the SN luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input\nrate. Relativistic motion, however, may change this result significantly.\n", "  We present a robust statistical analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence\nin 47 Tucanae. We combine HST UV and optical data in the core of the cluster,\nModules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution (MESA) white dwarf cooling models,\nwhite dwarf atmosphere models, artificial star tests, and a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) sampling method to fit white dwarf cooling models to our data\ndirectly. We use a technique known as the unbinned maximum likelihood to fit\nthese models to our data without binning. We use these data to constrain\nneutrino production and the thickness of the hydrogen layer in these white\ndwarfs. The data prefer thicker hydrogen layers $(q_\\mathrm{H}=3.2\\e{-5})$ and\nwe can strongly rule out thin layers $(q_\\mathrm{H}=10^{-6})$. The neutrino\nrates currently in the models are consistent with the data. This analysis does\nnot provide a constraint on the number of neutrino species.\n", "  Abell~1142 is a low-mass galaxy cluster at low redshift containing two\ncomparable Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG) resembling a scaled-down version of\nthe Coma Cluster. Our Chandra analysis reveals an X-ray emission peak, roughly\n100 kpc away from either BCG, which we identify as the cluster center. The\nemission center manifests itself as a second beta-model surface brightness\ncomponent distinct from that of the cluster on larger scales. The center is\nalso substantially cooler and more metal rich than the surrounding intracluster\nmedium (ICM), which makes Abell 1142 appear to be a cool core cluster. The\nredshift distribution of its member galaxies indicates that Abell 1142 may\ncontain two subclusters with each containing one BCG. The BCGs are merging at a\nrelative velocity of ~1200 km/s. This ongoing merger may have shock-heated the\nICM from ~ 2 keV to above 3 keV, which would explain the anomalous L_X--T_X\nscaling relation for this system. This merger may have displaced the\nmetal-enriched \"cool core\" of either of the subclusters from the BCG. The\nsouthern BCG consists of three individual galaxies residing within a radius of\n5 kpc in projection. These galaxies should rapidly sink into the subcluster\ncenter due to the dynamical friction of a cuspy cold dark matter halo.\n", "  We present results from an atmospheric circulation study of nine hot Jupiters\nthat comprise a large transmission spectral survey using the Hubble and Spitzer\nSpace Telescopes. These observations exhibit a range of spectral behavior over\noptical and infrared wavelengths which suggest diverse cloud and haze\nproperties in their atmospheres. By utilizing the specific system parameters\nfor each planet, we naturally probe a wide phase space in planet radius,\ngravity, orbital period, and equilibrium temperature. First, we show that our\nmodel \"grid\" recovers trends shown in traditional parametric studies of hot\nJupiters, particularly equatorial superrotation and increased day-night\ntemperature contrast with increasing equilibrium temperature. We show how\nspatial temperature variations, particularly between the dayside and nightside\nand west and east terminators, can vary by hundreds of K, which could imply\nlarge variations in Na, K, CO and CH4 abundances in those regions. These\nchemical variations can be large enough to be observed in transmission with\nhigh-resolution spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO on VLT, METIS on the E-ELT, or\nwith MIRI and NIRSpec aboard JWST. We also compare theoretical emission spectra\ngenerated from our models to available Spitzer eclipse depths for each planet,\nand find that the outputs from our solar-metallicity, cloud-free models\ngenerally provide a good match to many of the datasets, even without additional\nmodel tuning. Although these models are cloud-free, we can use their results to\nunderstand the chemistry and dynamics that drive cloud formation in their\natmospheres.\n", "  We discuss Drell-Yan production of dileptons at high energies in forward\nrapidity region in a hybrid high-energy approach. This approach uses\nunintegrated gluon distributions in one proton and collinear quark/antiquark\ndistributions in the second proton. Corresponding momentum-space formula for\nthe differential cross sections in high-energy approximation has been derived\nand will be presented. The relation to the commonly used dipole approach is\ndiscussed. We conclude and illustrate that some results of the dipole\napproaches are too approximate, as far as kinematics is considered, and in fact\ncannot be used when comparing with real experimental data. We find that the\ndipole formula is valid only in very forward/backward rapidity regions ($|y| >$\n5) that cannot be studied experimentally in the moment. We performed\ncalculations of some differential cross sections for low-mass dilepton\nproduction by the LHCb and ATLAS collaborations. In distinction to most of\ndipole approaches, we include all of the four Drell-Yan structure functions,\nalthough the impact of interference structure functions is rather small for the\nrelevant experimental cuts. We find that both side contributions ($g + q/\\bar\nq$ and $q/\\bar q + g$) have to be included even for the LHCb rapidity coverage\nwhich is in contradiction with what is usually done in the dipole approach. We\npresent results for different unintegrated gluon distributions from the\nliterature (some of them include saturation effects). We see no clear hints of\nsaturation even at small $M_{ll}$ when comparing with the LHCb data.\n", "  Time reversal invariance violating parity conserving (TVPC) effects are\ncalculated for elastic proton deuteron scattering with proton energies up to\n$2~$MeV. Distorted Wave Born Approximation is employed to estimate TVPC matrix\nelements, based on hadronic wave functions, obtained by solving three-body\nFaddeev-Merkuriev equations in configuration space with realistic potentials.\n", "  We applied computer analysis to classify the broad morphological type of\n~3,000,000 SDSS galaxies. The catalog provides for each galaxy the DR8 object\nID, right ascension, declination, and the certainty of the automatic\nclassification to spiral or elliptical. The certainty of the classification\nallows controlling the accuracy of a subset of galaxies by sacrificing some of\nthe least certain classifications. The accuracy of the catalog was tested using\ngalaxies that were classified by the manually annotated Galaxy Zoo catalog. The\nresults show that the catalog contains ~900,000 spiral galaxies and ~600,000\nelliptical galaxies with classification certainty that has a statistical\nagreement rate of ~98% with Galaxy Zoo debiased 'superclean' dataset. That also\ndemonstrates the ability of computers to turn large datasets of galaxy images\ninto structured catalogs of galaxy morphology. The catalog can be downloaded at\nhttp://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/data/morph_catalog , and can be accessed\nthrough public tables on CAS: public.broadMorph.LargeGM,\npublic.broadMorph.LargeWnnGM, and public.broadMorph.SpectraGM. The image\nanalysis software that was used to create the catalog is also publicly\navailable.\n", "  Orbital-free molecular dynamics simulations are used to benchmark two popular\nmodels for hot dense plasmas: the one component plasma (OCP) and the Yukawa\nmodel. A unified concept emerges where an effective OCP (eOCP) is constructed\nfrom the short-range structure of the plasma. An unambiguous ionization and the\nscreening length can be defined and used for a Yukawa system, which reproduces\nthe long range structure with finite compressibility. Similarly, the dispersion\nrelation of longitudinal waves is consistent with the screened model at\nvanishing wavenumber but merges with the OCP at high wavenumber. Additionally,\nthe eOCP reproduces the overall relaxation timescales of the correlation\nfunctions associated with ionic motion. In the hot dense regime, this unified\nconcept of eOCP can be fruitfully applied to deduce properties such as the\nequation of state, ionic transport coefficients, and the ion feature in x-ray\nThomson scattering experiments.\n", "  Methanol and formaldehyde are two simple organic molecules that are\nubiquitously detected in the interstellar medium. An origin in the solid phase\nand a subsequent nonthermal desorption into the gas phase is often invoked to\nexplain their abundances in some of the environments where they are found.\nExperimental simulations under astrophysically relevant conditions have been\ncarried out to find a suitable mechanism for that process. We explore the in\nsitu formation and subsequent photon-induced desorption of these species,\nstudying the UV photoprocessing of pure ethanol ice, and a more realistic\nbinary H2O:CH4 ice analog. Ice samples deposited onto an infrared transparent\nwindow at 8 K were UV-irradiated using a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow\nlamp. Evidence of photochemical production of these two species and subsequent\nUV-photon-induced desorption into the gas phase were searched for by means of a\nFourier transform infrared spectrometer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer,\nrespectively. Formation of CH3OH was only observed during photoprocessing of\nthe H2O:CH4 ice analog, but no photon-induced desorption was detected.\nPhotochemical production of H2CO was observed in both series of experiments.\nPhotochemidesorption of formaldehyde, i.e., photon-induced formation on the ice\nsurface and inmediate desorption, was observed, with a yield of 4.4 x 10-4\n(molecules/incident photon) when the H2O:CH4 ice analogs were photoprocessed.\nWhile certain C-bearing species, in particular H2CO, were found to desorb upon\nirradiation, nonthermal desorption of CH3OH was not observed. So far, there is\nno experimental evidence of any efficient CH3 OH desorption induced by UV\nphotons.\n", "  We obtained the near-infrared (NIR) high-resolution\n($R\\equiv\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda\\sim20,000$) spectra of the seven brightest\nearly-type stars in the Cygnus OB2 association for investigating the\nenvironmental dependence of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). The WINERED\nspectrograph mounted on the Araki 1.3m telescope in Japan was used to collect\ndata. All 20 of the known DIBs within the wavelength coverage of WINERED\n($0.91<\\lambda<1.36\\mu$m) were clearly detected along all lines of sight\nbecause of their high flux density in the NIR wavelength range and the large\nextinction. The equivalent widths (EWs) of DIBs were not correlated with the\ncolumn densities of C$_2$ molecules, which trace the patchy dense component,\nsuggesting that the NIR DIB carriers are distributed mainly in the diffuse\ncomponent. On the basis of the correlations among the NIR DIBs both for stars\nin Cyg OB2 and stars observed previously, $\\lambda\\lambda$10780, 10792, 11797,\n12623, and 13175 are found to constitute a \"family\", in which the DIBs are\ncorrelated well over the wide EW range. In contrast, the EW of $\\lambda$10504\nis found to remain almost constant over the stars in Cyg OB2. The extinction\nestimated from the average EW of $\\lambda$10504 ($A_V\\sim3.6$mag) roughly\ncorresponds to the lower limit of the extinction distribution of OB stars in\nCyg OB2. This suggests that $\\lambda$10504 is absorbed only by the foreground\nclouds, implying that the carrier of $\\lambda$10504 is completely destroyed in\nCyg OB2, probably by the strong UV radiation field. The different behaviors of\nthe DIBs may be caused by different properties of the DIB carriers.\n", "  Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study of \\textit{Ln}MnSbO (\\textit{Ln }$=$\nLa or Ce) reveals differences between the magnetic ground state of the two\ncompounds due to the strong Ce-Mn coupling compared to La-Mn. The two compounds\nadopt the \\textit{P4/nmm} space group down to 2 K and whereas magnetization\nmeasurements do not show obvious anomaly at high temperatures, NPD reveals a\nC-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below $T_{\\mathrm{N}} = 255 $ K for\nLaMnSbO and 240 K for CeMnSbO. While the magnetic structure of LaMnSbO is\npreserved to base temperature, a sharp transition at $T_{\\mathrm{SR}} = 4.5 $K\nis observed in CeMnSbO due to a spin-reorientation (SR) transition of the\nMn$^{\\mathrm{2+}}$ magnetic moments from pointing along the $c$-axis to the\n\\textit{ab}-plane. The SR transition in CeMnSbO is accompanied by a\nsimultaneous long-range AFM ordering of the Ce moments which indicates that the\nMn SR transition is driven by the Ce-Mn coupling. The ordered moments are found\nto be somewhat smaller than those expected for Mn$^{\\mathrm{2+}}$ ($S = 5/2$)\nin insulators, but large enough to suggest that these compounds belong to the\nclass of local-moment antiferromagnets. The lower $T_{\\mathrm{N\\thinspace }}$\nfound in these two compounds compared to the As-based counterparts\n($T_{\\mathrm{N}} = 317$ for LaMnAsO, $T_{\\mathrm{N}} = 347$ K for CeMnAsO)\nindicates that the Mn-$Pn$ ($Pn=$ As or Sb) hybridization that mediates the\nsuperexchange Mn-$Pn$-Mn coupling is weaker for the Sb-based compounds.\n", "  We report that the spectroscopic binary ? Ursae Majoris (?mu UMa) has\nsecondary RV variations of 471.2 days in addition to those of 230.0 days\nalready known. Keplerian orbit analysis yields stellar mass companions of 1.6\nM_Sun for the 230-d period and 0.14 M_Sun for the 471-d period. However, the\nHIPPARCOS photometries show a period similar to the stellar rotational period,\nwhich is one-quarter of the RV period. Variations in the bisector velocity\ncurvature show a period of 463.6 days. We also find ~?473-day variations in the\nequivalent width (EW) measurements of the H_alpha and H_beta lines, whose\norigin is probably stellar activity. We note that the nature of 471-day\nvariations is similar to one observed in \"Sequence D\" of symptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) pulsating stars. We therefore conclude that the RV and the EW variations\nin the spectroscopic binary M giant mu UMa A originate from the complex\npulsations and the chromospheric activity.\n", "  NASA's Kepler Space Telescope has successfully discovered thousands of\nexoplanet candidates using the transit method, including hundreds of stars with\nmultiple transiting planets. In order to estimate the frequency of these\nvaluable systems, it is essential to account for the unique geometric\nprobabilities of detecting multiple transiting extrasolar planets around the\nsame parent star. In order to improve on previous studies that used numerical\nmethods, we have constructed an efficient, semi-analytical algorithm called\nCORBITS which, given a collection of conjectured exoplanets orbiting a star,\ncomputes the probability that any particular group of exoplanets can be\nobserved to transit. The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential\ngeometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a\nsphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). The implemented algorithm is more\naccurate and orders of magnitude faster than previous algorithms, based on\ncomparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. We use CORBITS to show that the\npresent solar system would only show a maximum of 3 transiting planets, but\nthat this varies over time due to dynamical evolution. We also used CORBITS to\ngeometrically debias the period ratio and mutual Hill sphere distributions of\nKepler's multi-transiting planet candidates, which results in shifting these\ndistributions towards slightly larger values. In an Appendix, we present\nadditional semi-analytical methods for determining the frequency of exoplanet\nmutual events, i.e., the geometric probability that two planets will transit\neach other (Planet-Planet Occultation, relevant to transiting circumbinary\nplanets) and the probability that this transit occurs simultaneously as they\ntransit their star. The CORBITS algorithms and several worked examples are\npublicly available at https://github.com/jbrakensiek/CORBITS\n", "  For some crystalline materials, a regime can be found where continuous\nductile cutting is feasible. Using precision diamond turning, such materials\ncan be cut into complex optical components with high surface quality and form\naccuracy. In this work we use diamond-turning to machine a monolithic,\nsquare-shaped, doubly-resonant $LiNbO_3$ cavity with two flat and two convex\nfacets. When additional mild polishing is implemented, the Q-factor of the\nresonator is found to be limited only by the material absorption loss. We show\nhow our monolithic square resonator may be operated as an optical parametric\noscillator that is evanescently coupled to free-space beams via birefringent\nprisms. The prism arrangement allows for independent and large tuning of the\nfundamental and second harmonic coupling rates. We measure $2.6\\pm0.5$ dB of\nvacuum squeezing at 1064 nm using our system. Potential improvements to obtain\nhigher degrees of squeezing are discussed.\n", "  In the present paper, we combine numerical and experimental approaches to\nstudy the dynamics of stable and unstable internal wave attractors. The problem\nis considered in a classic trapezoidal setup filled with a uniformly stratified\nfluid. Energy is injected into the system at global scale by the\nsmall-amplitude motion of a vertical wall. Wave motion in the test tank is\nmeasured with the help of conventional synthetic schlieren and PIV techniques.\nThe numerical setup closely reproduces the experimental one in terms of\ngeometry and the operational range of the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The\nspectral element method is used as a numerical tool to simulate the nonlinear\ndynamics of a viscous salt-stratified fluid. We show that the results of\nthree-dimensional calculations are in excellent qualitative and quantitative\nagreement with the experimental data, including the spatial and temporal\nparameters of the secondary waves produced by triadic resonance instability.\nFurther, we explore experimentally and numerically the effect of lateral walls\non secondary currents and spanwise distribution of velocity amplitudes in the\nwave beams. Finally, we test the assumption of a bidimensional flow and\nestimate the error made in synthetic schlieren measurements due to this\nassumption.\n", "  We incorporate the perturbative evolution effects in the generalized parton\ndistributions (GPDs) calculated in effective light-front quark model for the\nnucleon. The perturbative effects enters into formalism through the evolution\nof GPDs according to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-like\n(DGLAP) equation. We obtain the evolved GPDs in the momentum space and\ntransverse impact parameter space. We observe that combining the light front\nquark model with the perturbative evolution effects, give the effective model\nfor studying the phenomenological GPDs\n", "  I question models for powering super energetic supernovae (SESNe) with a\nmagnetar central engine that do not include jets that are expected to be\nlaunched by the magnetar progenitor. I show that under reasonable assumptions\nthe outflow that is expected during the formation of a magnetar can carry an\namount of energy that does not fall much below, and even surpasses, the energy\nthat is stored in the newly born spinning neutron star (NS). The rapidly\nspinning NS and the strong magnetic fields attributed to magnetars require that\nthe accreted mass onto the newly born NS possesses high specific angular\nmomentum and strong magnetic fields. These ingredients are expected, as in many\nother astrophysical objects, to form collimated outflows/jets. I argue that the\nbipolar outflow in the pre-magnetar phase transfers a substantial amount of\nenergy to the supernova (SN) ejecta, and it cannot be ignored in models that\nattribute SESNe to magnetars. I conclude that jets launched by accretion disks\nand accretion belts are more likely to power SESNe than magnetars are. This\nconclusion is compatible with the notion that jets might power all core\ncollapse SNe (CCSNe).\n", "  We present monitoring observations of the active T Tauri star RW Aur, from\n2010 October to 2015 January, using optical high-resolution (R>10000)\nspectroscopy with CFHT-ESPaDOnS. Optical photometry in the literature shows\nbright, stable fluxes over most of this period, with lower fluxes (by 2-3 mag.)\nin 2010 and 2014. In the bright period our spectra show clear photospheric\nabsorption, complicated variation in the Ca II 8542 A emission}profile shapes,\nand a large variation in redshifted absorption in the O I 7772 and 8446 A and\nHe I 5876 A lines, suggesting unstable mass accretion during this period. In\ncontrast, these line profiles are relatively uniform during the faint periods,\nsuggesting stable mass accretion. During the faint periods the photospheric\nabsorption lines are absent or marginal, and the averaged Li I profile shows\nredshifted absorption due to an inflow. We discuss (1) occultation by\ncircumstellar material or a companion and (2) changes in the activity of mass\naccretion to explain the above results, together with near-infrared and X-ray\nobservations from 2011-2015. Neither scenario can simply explain all the\nobserved trends, and more theoretical work is needed to further investigate\ntheir feasibilities.\n", "  In light of a recent reformulation of Bell's theorem from causal principles\nby Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum\ntheory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision\nof our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a\nquantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but\nhighlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have\nsatisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly)\nagent-centric notions such as \"controllables\" and \"uncontrollables\", or\n\"observed\" and \"unobserved\". Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's\ntheorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep\nconceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than\nrejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem\nto be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between\nquantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus\ncausal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a\nresolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a\nsolution to the measurement problem.\n", "  An earlier investigation found that the performance of advanced students in a\nquantum mechanics course did not automatically improve from midterm to final\nexam on identical problems even when they were provided the correct solutions\nand their own graded exams. Here, we describe a study, which extended over four\nyears, in which upper-level undergraduate students in a quantum physics course\nwere given four identical problems in both the midterm exam and final exam.\nApproximately half of the students were given explicit incentives to correct\ntheir mistakes in the midterm exam. In particular, they could get back up to\n50\\% of the points lost on each midterm exam problem. The solutions to the\nmidterm exam problems were provided to all students in both groups but those\nwho corrected their mistakes were provided the solution after they submitted\ntheir corrections to the instructor. The performance on the same problems on\nthe final exam suggests that students who were given incentives to correct\ntheir mistakes significantly outperformed those who were not given an\nincentive. The incentive to correct the mistakes had greater impact on the\nfinal exam performance of students who had not performed well on the midterm\nexam.\n", "  We model the effects of the spiral arms of the Milky Way on the disk stellar\nkinematics in the Gaia observable space. We also estimate the Gaia capabilities\nof detecting the predicted signatures. We use both controlled orbital\nintegrations in analytic potentials and self-consistent simulations. We\nintroduce a new strategy, which consists of comparing the stellar kinematics of\nsymmetric Galactic longitudes (+l and -l), in particular the median transverse\nvelocity (from parallaxes and proper motions). This approach does not require\nthe assumption of an axisymmetric model. The typical differences between the\ntransverse velocity in symmetric longitudes in the models are of ~2 km/s, but\ncan be larger than 10 km/s for certain longitudes and distances. The kinematic\ndifferences for +l and -l show trends that depend on the properties of spiral\narms. Thus, this method can be used to quantify the importance of the effects\nof spiral arms on the orbits of stars in the different disk regions, and to\nconstrain the location of the arms, main resonances and, thus, pattern speed.\nMoreover, the method allows us to test the dynamical nature of the spiral\nstructure (e.g. grand design versus transient multiple arms). We estimate the\nnumber of stars of each spectral type that Gaia will observe in representative\nGalactic longitudes, their errors in distance and transverse velocity, and the\nerror in computing the median velocity as a function of distance. We will be\nable to measure the median transverse velocity with Gaia data, with precision\nsmaller than ~1 km/s up to distances of ~4-6 kpc for certain giant stars, and\nup to ~2-4 kpc and better kinematic precision (<= 0.5 km\\s) for certain\nsub-giants and dwarfs. These are enough to measure the typical signatures seen\nin the models. We also show that a similar strategy can be used with\nline-of-sight velocities from other upcoming spectroscopic surveys.(Abridged)\n", "  We search for bulk motions in the intracluster medium (ICM) of massive\nclusters showing evidence of an ongoing or recent major merger with spatially\nresolved spectroscopy in {\\sl Chandra} CCD data. We identify a sample of 6\nmerging clusters with $>$150 ks {\\sl Chandra} exposure in the redshift range\n$0.1 < z < 0.3$. By performing X-ray spectral analysis of projected ICM regions\nselected according to their surface brightness, we obtain the projected\nredshift maps for all of these clusters. After performing a robust analysis of\nthe statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measured X-ray redshift\n$z_{\\rm X}$, we check whether or not the global $z_{\\rm X}$ distribution\ndiffers from that expected when the ICM is at rest. We find evidence of\nsignificant bulk motions at more than 3$\\sigma$ in A2142 and A115, and less\nthan 2$\\sigma$ in A2034 and A520. Focusing on single regions, we identify\nsignificant localized velocity differences in all of the merging clusters. We\nalso perform the same analysis on two relaxed clusters with no signatures of\nrecent mergers, finding no signs of bulk motions, as expected. Our results\nindicate that deep {\\sl Chandra} CCD data enable us to identify the presence of\nbulk motions at the level of $v_{\\rm BM} >$ 1000\\ ${\\rm km\\ s^{-1}}$ in the ICM\nof massive merging clusters at $0.1<z<0.3$. Although the CCD spectral\nresolution is not sufficient for a detailed analysis of the ICM dynamics, {\\sl\nChandra} CCD data constitute a key diagnostic tool complementing X-ray\nbolometers on board future X-ray missions.\n", "  We report interferometric observations of carbon monoxide (CO) and its\nisotopologues in Titan's atmosphere using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The following transitions were detected:\nCO (J = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 6-5), $^{13}$CO (J = 2-1, 3-2, 6-5), C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1,\n3-2), and C$^{17}$O (J = 3-2). Molecular abundances and the vertical\natmospheric temperature profile were derived by modeling the observed emission\nline profiles using NEMESIS, a line-by-line radiative transfer code. We present\nthe first spectroscopic detection of $^{17}$O in the outer solar system with\nC$^{17}$O detected at > 8$\\sigma$ confidence. The abundance of CO was\ndetermined to be 49.6 ${\\pm}$ 1.8 ppm, assumed to be constant with altitude,\nwith isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 89.9 ${\\pm}$ 3.4, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O =\n486 ${\\pm}$ 22, and $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O = 2917${\\pm}$359. The measurements of\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O ratios are the most precise values\nobtained in Titan's atmospheric CO to date. Our results are in good agreement\nwith previous studies and suggest no significant deviations from standard\nterrestrial isotopic ratios.\n", "  In this note we discuss the question of gauge invariance in the presence of a\nminimal length. This contribution is prepared for the celebration of the 60th\nanniversary of the Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  According to theoretical predictions the quasicrystalline (QC) electronic\ndensity of states (DOS) must have a rich and fine spiky structure which\nactually has resulted elusive. The problem with its absence may be related to\npoor structural characteristics of the studied specimens, and/or to the\nnon-existence of this spike characteristic. Recent calculations have shown that\nthe fine structure indeed exists, but only for two dimensional approximants\nphases. The aim of the present study is to show our recent experimental studies\nwith point contacts tunnel junction spectroscopy performed in samples of very\nhigh quality. The studies were performed in icosahedral QC alloys with\ncomposition Tb$_9$Mg$_{35}$Zn$_{56}$. We found the presence of a pseudogap\nfeature at the Fermi level, small as compared to the pseudogap of other\nicosahedral materials. This study made in different spots on the QC shows quite\ndifferent spectroscopic features, where the observed DOS was a fine non-spiky\nstructure, distinct to theoretical predictions. In some regions of the\nspecimens the spectroscopic features could be related to Kondo characteristics\ndue to Tb magnetic atoms acting as impurities. Additionally, we observed that\nthe spectroscopic features vanished under magnetic field.\n", "  A few studies have reported a significant dearth of exoplanets with Neptune\nmass and radius with orbital periods below $2$--$4$ d. This cannot be explained\nby observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital\nperiods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the\nappearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different\nformation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital\nperiods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of\nformation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here\nfollow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in\nboth the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available\nlarge samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively\nsharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the\nplanetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is\nlocated along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period.\nThe desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear.\nIt seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to\nthe period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius\nthat is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds. The combination\nof the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius\nplanes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of $R_{\\rm p}/R_{\\rm Jup}\\simeq\n(1.2\\pm0.3)(M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm Jup})^{0.27\\pm0.11}\\,$ for $ 0.1\\lesssim M_{\\rm\np}/M_{\\rm Jup}\\lesssim 1$. The derived shape of the desert, which might extend\nup to periods of $5$--$10$ d, could shed some light on the formation and\nevolution of close-in planets.\n", "  Gas flows play a fundamental role in galaxy formation and evolution,\nproviding the fuel for the star formation process. These mechanisms leave an\nimprint in the amount of heavy elements. Thus, the analysis of this metallicity\nsignature provides additional constraint on the galaxy formation scenario. We\naim to discriminate between four different galaxy formation models based on two\naccretion scenarios and two different star formation recipes. We address the\nimpact of a bimodal accretion scenario and a strongly regulated star formation\nrecipe. We present a new extension of the eGalICS model, which allows us to\ntrack the metal enrichment process. Our new chemodynamical model is applicable\nfor situations ranging from metal-free primordial accretion to very enriched\ninterstellar gas contents. We use this new tool to predict the metallicity\nevolution of both the stellar populations and gas phase. We also address the\nevolution of the gas metallicity with the star formation rate (SFR). We then\nfocus on a sub-sample of Milky Way-like galaxies. We compare both the cosmic\nstellar mass assembly and the metal enrichment process of such galaxies with\nobservations and detailed chemical evolution models. Our models, based on a\nstrong star formation regulation, allow us to reproduce well the stellar mass\nto gas-phase metallicity relation observed in the local universe. However, we\nobserve a systematic shift towards high masses. Our $Mstar-Zg-SFR relation is\nin good agreement with recent measurements: our best model predicts a clear\ndependence with the SFR. Both SFR and metal enrichment histories of our Milky\nWay-like galaxies are consistent with observational measurements and detailed\nchemical evolution models. We finally show that Milky Way progenitors start\ntheir evolution below the observed main sequence and progressively reach this\nobserved relation at z = 0.\n", "  We provide a fully-covariant expression for the diffeomorphic charge in 4D\nanti-de Sitter gravity, when the Gauss-Bonnet and Pontryagin terms are added to\nthe action. The couplings of these topological invariants are such that the\nWeyl tensor and its dual appear in the on-shell variation of the action, and\nsuch that the action is stationary for asymptotic (anti) self-dual solutions in\nthe Weyl tensor. In analogy with Euclidean electromagnetism, whenever the\nself-duality condition is global, both the action and the total charge are\nidentically vanishing. Therefore, for such configurations the magnetic mass\nequals the Ashtekhar-Magnon-Das definition.\n", "  EMBRACE@Nancay is a prototype instrument consisting of an array of 4608\ndensely packed antenna elements creating a fully sampled, unblocked aperture.\nThis technology is proposed for the Square Kilometre Array and has the\npotential of providing an extremely large field of view making it the ideal\nsurvey instrument. We describe the system,calibration procedures, and results\nfrom the prototype.\n", "  Finite element schemes based on discontinuous Galerkin methods possess\nfeatures amenable to massively parallel computing accelerated with general\npurpose graphics processing units (GPUs). However, the computational\nperformance of such schemes strongly depends on their implementation. In the\npast, several implementation strategies have been proposed. They are based\nexclusively on specialized compute kernels tuned for each operation, or they\ncan leverage BLAS libraries that provide optimized routines for basic linear\nalgebra operations. In this paper, we present and analyze up-to-date\nperformance results for different implementations, tested in a unified\nframework on a single NVIDIA GTX980 GPU. We show that specialized kernels\nwritten with a one-node-per-thread strategy are competitive for polynomial\nbases up to the fifth and seventh degrees for acoustic and elastic models,\nrespectively. For higher degrees, a strategy that makes use of the NVIDIA\ncuBLAS library provides better results, able to reach a net arithmetic\nthroughput 35.7% of the theoretical peak value.\n", "  We report 1.1 mm number counts revealed with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey\nField (SXDF). The advent of ALMA enables us to reveal millimeter-wavelength\nnumber counts down to the faint end without source confusion. However, previous\nstudies are based on the ensemble of serendipitously-detected sources in fields\noriginally targeting different sources and could be biased due to the\nclustering of sources around the targets. We derive number counts in the flux\nrange of 0.2-2 mJy by using 23 (>=4sigma) sources detected in a continuous 2.0\narcmin$^2$ area of the SXDF. The number counts are consistent with previous\nresults within errors, suggesting that the counts derived from\nserendipitously-detected sources are not significantly biased, although there\ncould be field-to-field variation due to the small survey area. By using the\nbest-fit function of the number counts, we find that ~40% of the extragalactic\nbackground light at 1.1 mm is resolved at S(1.1mm) > 0.2 mJy.\n", "  With a test-particle simulation, we investigate the effect of large-scale\ncoronal magnetic fields on electron acceleration at an outward-propagating\ncoronal shock with a circular front. The coronal field is approximated by an\nanalytical solution with a streamer-like magnetic field featured by partially\nopen magnetic field and a current sheet at the equator atop the closed region.\nWe show that the large-scale shock-field configuration, especially the relative\ncurvature of the shock and the magnetic field line across which the shock is\nsweeping, plays an important role in the efficiency of electron acceleration.\nAt low shock altitudes, when the shock curvature is larger than that of\nmagnetic field lines, the electrons are mainly accelerated at the shock flanks;\nat higher altitudes, when the shock curvature is smaller, the electrons are\nmainly accelerated at the shock nose around the top of closed field lines. The\nabove process reveals the shift of efficient electron acceleration region along\nthe shock front during its propagation. It is also found that in general the\nelectron acceleration at the shock flank is not so efficient as that at the top\nof closed field since at the top a collapsing magnetic trap can be formed. In\naddition, we find that the energy spectra of electrons is power-law like, first\nhardening then softening with the spectral index varying in a range of -3 to\n-6. Physical interpretations of the results and implications on the study of\nsolar radio bursts are discussed.\n", "  One important aspect of the magneto-structural transition in MnCoGe and\nrelated materials is the reduction in saturation magnetization from the\northorhombic to the hexagonal phase. Here, by combining an element specific\nmagnetization probe such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and band\nstructure calculations, we show that the magnetic moment instability between\northorhombic and hexagonal structures originates from a reduction in the Mn\nsub-lattice magnetization. The consequences of the moment instability for the\nmagnetocaloric effect are discussed.\n", "  The recently discovered alignment of quasar polarizations on very large\nscales could possibly explained by considering cosmic strings on a warped five\ndimensional spacetime. Compact objects, such as cosmic strings, could have\ntremendous mass in the bulk, while their warped manifestations in the brane can\nbe consistent with general relativity in 4D. The self-gravitating cosmic string\ninduces gravitational wavelike disturbances which could have effects felt on\nthe brane, i.e., the massive effective 4D modes (Kaluza-Klein modes) of the\nperturbative 5D graviton. This effect is amplified by the time dependent part\nof the warp factor. Due to this warp factor, disturbances don't fade away\nduring the expansion of the universe. From a non-linear perturbation analysis\nit is found that the effective Einstein 4D equations on an axially symmetric\nspacetime, contain a \"back-reaction\" term on the righthand side caused by the\nprojected 5D Weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. The propagation\nequations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fields\ncontain $\\varphi$-dependent terms, so the approximate wave solutions are no\nlonger axially symmetric. The disturbances, amplified by the warp factor, can\npossess extremal values for fixed polar angles. This could explain the two\npreferred polarization vectors mod $(\\varphi, 90^o)$.\n", "  PKS 1424+240 is a BL-Lac blazar with unknown redshift that was detected at\nhigh-energy gamma rays by Fermi-LAT with a hard spectrum. At VHE, it was first\ndetected by VERITAS and later confirmed by MAGIC. Its spectral energy\ndistribution is highly attenuated at VHE gamma rays, which is coherent with\ndistant sources. Several estimations enabled the redshift to be constrained to\nthe range 0.6 < z < 1.3. These results place PKS 1424+240 in the very\ninteresting condition of being probably the most distant blazar that has been\ndetected at VHE. The ambiguity in the redshift is still large enough to prevent\nprecise studies of the EBL and the intrinsic blazar spectrum. Given the\ndifficulty of measuring spectroscopic redshifts for BL-Lac objects directly, we\naim to establish a reliable redshift value for this blazar by finding its host\ngroup of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are associated with groups, and BL-Lac\nobjects are typically hosted by them, so we decided to search for the host\ngroup of the blazar. For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations\nof thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.\nAfter analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding\ngroups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep\ncatalogue of groups. We also used photometric data from the SDSS catalogue to\nanalyse the red sequence of the proposed blazar host group. We found a new\ngroup of galaxies with eight members at z = 0.6010 +- 0.003, a virial radius of\nR_vir = 1.53 Mpc, and a velocity dispersion of sigma_v = 813 +- 187 km/s. The\nphotometric study indicates that more members are probably populating this\npreviously uncatalogued group of galaxies. The probability of PKS 1424+240\nbeing a member of this group was found to be 98%. The new group of galaxies\nfound at z = 0.6010 +- 0.003 is very likely hosting PKS 1424+240.\n", "  Deterministic population growth models with power-law rates can exhibit a\nlarge variety of growth behaviors, ranging from algebraic, exponential to\nhyperexponential (finite time explosion). In this setup, selfsimilarity\nconsiderations play a key role, together with two time substitutions. Two\nstochastic versions of such models are investigated, showing a much richer\nvariety of behaviors. One is the Lamperti construction of selfsimilar positive\nstochastic processes based on the exponentiation of spectrally positive\nprocesses , followed by an appropriate time change. The other one is based on\nstable continuous-state branching processes, given by another Lamperti time\nsubstitution applied to stable spectrally positive processes.\n", "  Data processing constitutes a critical component of high-contrast exoplanet\nimaging. Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a\nwavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing\nstrategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging\n(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)\nbased algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique\nfor constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted\nfrom the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions\npresent in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the\nscience data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity\nof the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. Inspired by\nrecent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to\npropose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current\nPCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of\ncompanions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future\ndirect imaging surveys. We used randomized low-rank approximation methods\nrecently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise\nthresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse,\nand Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition\nseparates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary\nsignal, which mostly remains in the sparse term. We tested the performance of\nour new algorithm on a long ADI sequence obtained on beta Pictoris with\nVLT/NACO. Compared to a standard PCA approach, LLSG decomposition reaches a\nhigher signal-to-noise ratio and has an overall better performance in the\nreceiver operating characteristic space. (abridged).\n", "  Fish rheotaxis, or alignment into flow currents, results from intertwined\nsensory, neural and actuation mechanisms, all coupled with hydrodynamics to\nproduce a behavior that is critical for upstream migration and position holding\nin oncoming flows. Among several sensory modalities, the lateral line sensory\nsystem is thought to play a major role in the fish ability to sense minute\nwater motions in their vicinity and, thus, in their rheotactic behavior. Here,\nwe propose a theoretical model consisting of a fishlike body equipped with\nlateral pressure sensors in oncoming uniform flows. We compute the optimal\nsensor locations that maximize the sensory output. Our results confirm recent\nexperimental findings that correlate the layout of the lateral line sensors\nwith the distribution of hydrodynamic information at the fish surface. We then\nexamine the behavioral response of the fishlike model as a function of its\norientation and swimming speed relative to the background flow. Our working\nhypothesis is that fish respond to sensory information by adjusting their\norientation according to the perceived difference in pressure. We find that, as\nin fish rheotaxis, the fishlike body responds by aligning into the oncoming\nflow. These findings may have significant implications on understanding the\ninterplay between the sensory output and fish behavior.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of ultrasharp metamagnetic transitions in\nLa(5/8-y)Nd(y)Ca(3/8)MnO(3) manganites. These compounds change from a low\ntemperature ferromagnetic metallic state at low Nd doping to a charge-ordered\nantiferromagnetic insulator for high Nd content. At an intermediate doping a\nphase-separated state is established. At low temperatures (2 K), we observe an\navalanche-like field-induced metamagnetic transition, when the entire compound\nchanges abruptly from one phase to the other. We investigate the signatures of\nthis ultrasharp transition using magnetization and specific heat measurements.\nWe observe a first order transition in the specific heat associated with\ndiscontinuous jumps in the magnetization. A strong increase of the sample\ntemperature is simultaneously observed. The results are interpret in terms of\nlatent heat release from the field induced enhancement of the ferromagnetic\nfraction, triggering the avalanche process.\n", "  We present recent results on the first moments of parton distributions using\ngauge configurations generated with two degenerate flavors of light twisted\nmass quarks with pion mass fixed approximately to its physical value. We also\npresent a first study of the vector parton distribution function using a\ntwisted mass ensemble at pion mass of 373 MeV.\n", "  We report on the analysis of the broad Fe Kalpha line feature of Cygnus X-1\nin the spectra of four simultaneous hard intermediate state observations made\nwith the X-ray Multiple Mirror mission (XMM-Newton), the Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer (RXTE), and the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\n(INTEGRAL). The high quality of the XMM-Newton data taken in the Modified\nTiming Mode of the EPIC-pn camera provides a great opportunity to investigate\nthe broadened Fe Kalpha reflection line at 6.4keV with a very high signal to\nnoise ratio. The 4-500keV energy range is used to constrain the underlying\ncontinuum and the reflection at higher energies. We first investigate the data\nby applying a phenomenological model that consists of the sum of an\nexponentially cutoff power law and relativistically smeared reflection.\nAdditionally, we apply a more physical approach and model the irradiation of\nthe accretion disk directly from the lamp post geometry. All four observations\nshow consistent values for the black hole parameters with a spin of $a\\sim\n0.9$, in agreement with recent measurements from reflection and disk continuum\nfitting. The inclination is found to be $i\\sim30^\\circ$, consistent with the\norbital inclination and different from inclination measurements made during the\nsoft state, which show a higher inclination. We speculate that the difference\nbetween the inclination measurements is due to changes in the inner region of\nthe accretion disk.\n", "  The central-arbitrary bin and forward-backward bin multiplicity correlation\npatterns for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} $= $7.7-62.4$ GeV are\ninvestigated within a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. An interesting\nobservation is that for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} <19.6$ GeV Au+Au collisions, these two\ncorrelation patterns both have an increase with the pseudorapidity gap, while\nfor $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} >19.6$ GeV Au+Au collisions, they decrease. We mainly\ndiscuss the influence of different evolution stages of collision system on the\ncentral-arbitrary bin correlations, such as the initial conditions, partonic\nscatterings, hadronization scheme and hadronic scatterings. Our results show\nthat the central-arbitrary bin multiplicity correlations have different\nresponses to partonic phase and hadronic phase, which can be suggested as a\ngood probe to explore the dynamical evolution mechanism of the hot dense matter\nin high-energy heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Some anisotropy in both mechanical and thermodynamical properties of bismuth\nis expected. A combination of density functional theory total energy\ncalculations and density functional perturbation theory in the local density\napproximation is used to compute the elastic constants at 0 K using a finite\nstrain approach and the thermal expansion tensor in the quasiharmonic\napproximation. The overall agreement with experiment is good. Furthermore, the\nanisotropy in the thermal expansion is found to arise from the anisotropy in\nboth the directional compressibilities and the directional Gr\\\"uneisen\nfunctions.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium insulator-metal transition driven in a\nSmNiO3 thin film by coherent optical excitation of the LaAlO3 substrate\nlattice. By probing the transient optical properties over a broad frequency\nrange (100 - 800 cm^-1), we analyze both the time dependent metallic plasma and\nthe infrared optical phonon line shapes. We show that the light-induced\nmetallic phase in SmNiO3 has the same carrier density as the equilibrium\nmetallic phase. We also report that the LaAlO3 substrate acts as a transducer\nonly at the earlier time delays, as the vibrations are driven coherently. No\nlong-lived structural rearrangement takes place in the substrate. Finally, we\nshow that the transient insulator-metal transition occurs both below and above\nthe N\\'eel temperature. We conclude that the supersonic melting of magnetic\norder measured with ultrafast x-rays is not the driving force of the formation\nof the metallic phase. We posit that the insulator metal transition may origin\nfrom the rearrangement of ordered charges at the interface propagating into the\nfilm.\n", "  Inverse magnetostriction is the effect by which magnetization can be changed\nupon application of stress/strain. A strain modulation may be created\nelectrically by exciting interdigitated transducers to generate surface\nacoustic waves (SAWs). Hence SAWs appear as a possible route towards\ninduction-free undulatory magnetic data manipulation. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally on an out-of-plane magnetostrictive layer a reduction of the\ncoercive field of up to 60$\\%$ by a SAW, over millimetric distances. A simple\nmodel shows that this spectacular effect can be partly explained by the\nperiodic lowering of the strain-dependent domain nucleation energy by the SAW.\nThis proof of concept was done on (Ga,Mn)(As,P), a magnetic semiconductor in\nwhich the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy can be made very weak by epitaxial\ngrowth; it should guide material engineering for all-acoustic magnetization\nswitching.\n", "  We study the lamppost model, in which the X-ray source in accreting\nblack-hole systems is located on the rotation axis close to the horizon. We\npoint out a number of inconsistencies in the widely used lamppost model\nrelxilllp, e.g., the neglect of the redshift of the photons emitted by the\nlamppost and directly observed. They appear to invalidate those model fitting\nresults for which the source distances from the horizon are within several\ngravitational radii. Furthermore, if those results were correct, most of the\nphotons produced in the lamppost would be trapped by the black hole, and the\nluminosity generated in the source as measured at infinity would be much larger\nthan that observed. This appears to be in conflict with the observed smooth\nstate transitions between the hard and soft states of X-ray binaries. The\nrequired increase of the accretion rate and the associated efficiency reduction\npresent also a problem for AGNs. Then, those models imply the luminosity\nmeasured in the local frame to be much higher than that produced in the source\nand measured at infinity, due to the additional effects of time dilation and\nredshift, and the electron temperature to be higher significantly than that\nobserved. We show that these conditions imply that the fitted sources would be\nout of the pair equilibrium. On the other hand, the above issues pose\nrelatively minor problems for sources at large distances from the black hole,\nwhere relxilllp can still be used.\n", "  X-shaped or peanut-shaped (X/P) bulges are observed in more than 40% of\n(nearly) edge-on disc galaxies, though to date a robust method to quantify them\nis lacking. Using Fourier harmonics to describe the deviation of galaxy\nisophotes from ellipses, we demonstrate with a sample of 11 such galaxies\n(including NGC 128) that the sixth Fourier component ($B_6$) carries physical\nmeaning by tracing this X/P structure. We introduce five quantitative\ndiagnostics based on the radial $B_6$ profile, namely: its `peak' amplitude\n($\\Pi_{\\rm max}$); the (projected major-axis) `length' where this peak occurs\n($R_{\\Pi,max}$); its vertical `height' above the disc plane ($z_{\\Pi,max}$);\nthe $B_6$ profile's integrated `strength' ($S_{\\Pi}$); and the $B_6$ peak\n`width' ($W_{\\Pi}$). We also introduce different `classes' of $B_6$ profile\nshape. Furthermore, we convincingly detect and measure the properties of\nmultiple (nested) X/P structures in individual galaxies which additionally\ndisplay the signatures of multiple bars in their surface brightness profiles,\nthus consolidating further the scenario in which peanuts are associated with\nbars. We reveal that the peanut parameter space (`length', `strength' and\n`height') for real galaxies is not randomly populated, but the 3 metrics are\ninter-correlated (both in kpc and disc scale-length $h$). Additionally, the X/P\n`length' and `strength' appear to correlate with $v_{rot}/\\sigma_*$, lending\nfurther support to the notion that peanuts `know' about the galactic disc in\nwhich they reside. Such constraints are important for simulations, as they\nprovide a direct link between peanuts and their host disc. Our diagnostics\nreveal a spectrum of X/P properties and could provide a means of distinguishing\nbetween different peanut formation scenarios. Moreover, nested peanuts, as\nremnants of bar buckling events, can provide insights into the disc and bar\ninstability history.\n", "  A sample of 102 local (0.02 < z < 0.1) Seyfert galaxies with black hole\nmasses MBH > 10^7 M_sun was selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nand observed using the Keck 10-m telescope to study the scaling relations\nbetween MBH and host galaxy properties. We study profile changes of the broad\nHbeta emission line within the ~3-9 year time-frame between the two sets of\nspectra. The variability of the broad Hbeta emission line is of particular\ninterest, not only since it is used to estimate MBH, but also since its\nstrength and width is used to classify Seyfert galaxies into different types.\nAt least some form of broad-line variability (in either width or flux) is\nobserved in the majority (~66%) of the objects, resulting in a Seyfert-type\nchange for ~38% of the objects, likely driven by variable accretion and/or\nobscuration. The broad Hbeta line virtually disappears in 3/102 (~3%) extreme\ncases. We discuss potential causes for these changing-look AGNs. While similar\ndramatic transitions have previously been reported in the literature, either on\na case-by-case basis or in larger samples focusing on quasars at higher\nredshifts, our study provides statistical information on the frequency of\nH$\\beta$ line variability in a sample of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the composition and nucleosynthetic origins\nof the heavy elements in the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1.62+/-0.09) star HD94028.\nPrevious studies revealed that this star is mildly enhanced in elements\nproduced by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process; e.g.,\n[Pb/Fe]=+0.79+/-0.32) and rapid neutron-capture process (r-process; e.g.,\n[Eu/Fe]=+0.22+/-0.12), including unusually large molybdenum\n([Mo/Fe]=+0.97+/-0.16) and ruthenium ([Ru/Fe]=+0.69+/-0.17) enhancements.\nHowever, this star is not enhanced in carbon ([C/Fe]=-0.06+/-0.19). We analyze\nan archival near-ultraviolet spectrum of HD94028, collected using the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and other\narchival optical spectra collected from ground-based telescopes. We report\nabundances or upper limits derived from 64 species of 56 elements. We compare\nthese observations with s-process yields from low-metallicity AGB evolution and\nnucleosynthesis models. No combination of s- and r-process patterns can\nadequately reproduce the observed abundances, including the super-solar [As/Ge]\nratio (+0.99+/-0.23) and the enhanced [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] ratios. We can fit\nthese features when including an additional contribution from the intermediate\nneutron-capture process (i process), which perhaps operated by the ingestion of\nH in He-burning convective regions in massive stars, super-AGB stars, or\nlow-mass AGB stars. Currently, only the i process appears capable of\nconsistently producing the super-solar [As/Ge] ratios and ratios among\nneighboring heavy elements found in HD94028. Other metal-poor stars also show\nenhanced [As/Ge] ratios, hinting that operation of the i process may have been\ncommon in the early Galaxy.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the optical spectroscopic properties of 12\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) with candidate low-mass black holes (BHs)\nselected by Kamizasa et al. through rapid X-ray variability. The high-quality,\nechellette Magellan spectra reveal broad H$\\alpha$ emission in all the sources,\nallowing us to estimate robust viral BH masses and Eddington ratios for this\nunique sample. We confirm that the sample contains low-mass BHs accreting at\nhigh rates: the median $M_{\\rm BH} = 1.2\\times 10^6M_\\odot$ and median $L_{\\rm\nbol}/L_{\\rm Edd}=0.44$. The sample follows the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation,\nwithin the considerable scatter typical of pseudobulges, the probable hosts of\nthese low-mass AGNs. Various lines of evidence suggest that ongoing star\nformation is prevalent in these systems. We propose a new strategy to estimate\nstar formation rates in AGNs hosted by low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies,\nbased on modification of an existing method using the strength of [O II]\n$\\lambda 3727$, [O III] $\\lambda 5007$, and X-rays.\n", "  It is known that the Maximum relative Entropy (MrE) method can be used to\nboth update and approximate probability distributions functions in statistical\ninference problems. In this manuscript, we apply the MrE method to infer\nmagnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials. In addition to comparing our\napproach to more traditional methodologies based upon the Ising model and Mean\nField Theory, we also test the effectiveness of the MrE method on\nconventionally unexplored ferromagnetic materials with defects.\n", "  A distorted spin-dependent spectral function for 3He is considered for the\nextraction of the transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions in the\nneutron from semi-inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering off polarized\n3He at finite momentum transfers, where final state interactions are taken into\naccount. The generalization of the analysis to a Poincar\\'e covariant framework\nwithin the light-front dynamics is outlined.\n", "  We report the discovery of an off-nuclear ultrasoft hyper-luminous X-ray\nsource candidate 3XMM J141711.1+522541 in the inactive S0 galaxy SDSS\nJ141711.07+522540.8 (z=0.41827, d_L=2.3 Gpc) in the Extended Groth Strip. It is\nlocated at a projected offset of ~1.0 (5.2 kpc) from the nucleus of the galaxy\nand was serendipitously detected in five XMM-Newton observations in 2000 July.\nTwo observations have enough counts and can be fitted with a standard thermal\ndisk with an apparent inner disk temperature kT_MCD ~ 0.13 keV and a 0.28-14.2\nkeV unabsorbed luminosity L_X ~ 4X10^{43} erg/s in the source rest frame. The\nsource was still detected in three Chandra observations in 2002 August, with\nsimilarily ultrasoft but fainter spectra (kT_MCD ~ 0.17 keV, L_X ~ 0.5X10^{43}\nerg/s). It was not detected in later observations, including two by Chandra in\n2005 October, one by XMM-Newton in 2014 January, and two by Chandra in 2014\nSeptember-October, implying a long-term flux variation factor of >14. Therefore\nthe source could be a transient with an outburst in 2000-2002. It has a faint\noptical counterpart candidate, with apparent magnitudes of m_F606W=26.3 AB mag\nand m_F814W=25.5 AB mag in 2004 December (implying an absolute V-band magnitude\nof ~-15.9 AB mag). We discuss various explanations for the source and find that\nit is best explained as a massive black hole (BH) embedded in the nucleus of a\npossibly stripped satellite galaxy, with the X-ray outburst due to tidal\ndisruption of a surrounding star by the BH. The BH mass is ~10^5 Msun, assuming\nthe peak X-ray luminosity at around the Eddington limit.\n", "  We present an elemental-abundance analysis of an extremely metal-poor (EMP;\n[Fe/H] < -3.0) star, SDSS J134338.67+484426.6, identified during the course of\nthe MARVELS spectroscopic pre-survey of some 20000 stars to identify suitable\ncandidates for exoplanet searches. This star, with an apparent magnitude V =\n12.14, is the lowest metallicity star found in the pre-survey, and is one of\nonly ~20 known EMP stars that are this bright or brighter. Our high-resolution\nspectroscopic analysis shows that this star is a subgiant with [Fe/H] = -3.42,\nhaving \"normal\" carbon and no enhancement of neutron-capture abundances.\nStrontium is under-abundant, [Sr/Fe] =-0.47, but the derived lower limit on\n[Sr/Ba] indicates that Sr is likely enhanced relative to Ba. This star belongs\nto the sparsely populated class of alpha-poor EMP stars that exhibit low ratios\nof [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ca/Fe] compared to typical halo stars at similar\nmetallicity. The observed variations in radial velocity from several epochs of\n(low- and high-resolution) spectroscopic follow-up indicate that SDSS\nJ134338.67+484426.6 is a possible long-period binary. We also discuss the\nabundance trends in EMP stars for r-process elements, and compare with other\nmagnesium-poor stars.\n", "  The spins of the low-spin Ir4+ (S = 1/2, d5) ions at the octahedral sites of\nthe oxides Sr3NiIrO6, Sr2IrO4 and Na2IrO3 exhibit preferred orientations with\nrespect to their IrO6 octahedra. We evaluated the magnetic anisotropies of\nthese S = 1/2 ions on the basis of DFT calculations including spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), and probed their origin by performing perturbation theory\nanalyses with SOC as perturbation within the LS coupling scheme. The observed\nspin orientations of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4 are correctly predicted by DFT\ncalculations, and are accounted for by the perturbation theory analysis. As for\nthe spin orientation of Na2IrO3, both experimental studies and DFT calculations\nhave not been unequivocal. Our analysis reveals that the Ir4+ spin orientation\nof Na2IrO3 should have nonzero components along the c- and a-axes directions.\nThe spin orientations determined by DFT calculations are sensitive to the\naccuracy of the crystal structures employed, which is explained by perturbation\ntheory analyses when interactions between adjacent Ir4+ ions are taken into\nconsideration. There are indications implying that the 5d electrons of Na2IrO3\nare less strongly localized compared with those of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4. This\nimplication was confirmed by showing that the Madelung potentials of the Ir4+\nions are less negative in Na2IrO3 than in Sr3NiIrO6, Sr2IrO4. Most\ntransition-metal S = 1/2 ions do have magnetic anisotropies because the SOC\ninduces interactions among their crystal-field split d-states, and the\nassociated mixing of the states modifies only the orbital parts of the states.\nThis finding cannot be mimicked by a spin Hamiltonian because this model\nHamiltonian lacks the orbital degree of freedom, thereby leading to the\nspin-half syndrome. The spin-orbital entanglement for the 5d spin-half ions\nIr4+ is not as strong as has been assumed lately.\n", "  We summarize our recent studies on the origin of solar wind kinetic scale\nturbulence and electron halo in the electron velocity distribution function.\nIncreasing observations of nanoflares and microscopic type III radio bursts\nstrongly suggest that nanoflares and accelerated electron beams are common in\nthe corona. Based on particle-in-cell simulations, we show that both the\ncore-halo feature and kinetic scale turbulence observed in the solar wind can\nbe produced by the nonlinear evolution of electron two-stream instability\ndriven by nanoflare accelerated electron beams. The energy exchange between\nwaves and particles reaches equilibrium in the inner corona and the key\nfeatures of the turbulence and velocity distribution are preserved as the solar\nwind escapes into interplanetary space along open magnetic field lines.\nObservational tests of the model and future theoretical work are discussed.\n", "  Based on the swing amplification model of Julian and Toomre (1966), we\ninvestigate the formation and structure of stellar spirals in disk galaxies. We\ncalculate the pitch angle, wavelengths, and amplification factor of the most\namplified mode. We also obtain the fitting formulae of these quantities as a\nfunction of the epicycle frequency and Toomre's $Q$. As the epicycle frequency\nincreases, the pitch angle and radial wavelength increases, while the azimuthal\nwavelength decreases. The pitch angle and radial wavelength increases with $Q$,\nwhile the azimuthal wavelength weakly depends on $Q$. The amplification factor\ndecreases with $Q$ rapidly. In order to confirm the swing amplification model,\nwe perform local $N$-body simulations. The wavelengths and pitch angle by the\nswing amplification model are in good agreement with those by $N$-body\nsimulations. The dependence of the amplification factor on the epicycle\nfrequency in $N$-body simulations is generally consistent with that in the\nswing amplification model. Using these results, we estimate the number of\nspiral arms as a function of the shear rate. The number of spiral arms\nincreases with the shear rate if the disk to halo mass ratio is fixed.\n", "  Using a new generalized second law of thermodynamics, the information and\nentropy of a black hole and its accretion disk are analyzed respectively. We\nfind the bound of the information channel width of a black hole, which is\ndetermined by the variation rate of the horizon temperature and the mass of the\nblack hole's shell(the accretion disk close to the horizon).\n", "  We give an overview of a model to describe deep-inelastic scattering (DIS)\noff the deuteron with a spectator proton, based on the virtual nucleon\napproximation (VNA). The model accounts for the final-state interactions (FSI)\nof the DIS debris with the spectator proton. Values of the rescattering cross\nsection are obtained by fits to high-momentum spectator data. By using the\nso-called \"pole extrapolation method\", free neutron structure functions can be\nobtained by extrapolating low-momentum spectator proton data to the on-shell\nneutron pole. We apply this method to the BONuS data set and find a surprising\nBjorken $x$ dependence, indicating a possible rise of the neutron to proton\nstructure function ratio at high $x$.\n", "  On this work, we consider a particle moving in front of a dielectric plate,\nand study two of the most relevant effects of the vacuum field fluctuations:\nthe dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle's internal degrees of\nfreedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed\ntrajectory. To study the dissipative effects, we calculate the in-out effective\naction by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic\ndegrees of freedom of both the plate and the particle. This in-out effective\naction develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability for the\ndecay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the\ndissipation is affected by the relative velocity between the particle and the\nplate and the properties of the microscopic degrees of freedom. In order to\nstudy the effects of decoherence over the internal degrees of freedom of the\nparticle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh influence action, by\nfunctionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of\nfreedom of the plate. We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by\ntwo different quantum configurations (of the internal degree of freedom of the\nparticle) to be possible to differentiate from one another. We analyze the way\nin which the presence of the mirror affects the decoherence, and the possible\nways to maximize or reduce its effects.\n", "  Over the past few years, astronomers have detected thousands of planets and\ncandidate planets by observing their periodic transits in front of their host\nstars. Related methods might soon allow studies of the chemical imprints of\nlife in extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Here, we address the reciprocal\nquestion, namely, from where is Earth detectable by extrasolar observers using\nsimilar methods. We explore Earth's transit zone (ETZ), the projection of a\nband around Earth's ecliptic onto the celestial plane, where observers can\ndetect Earth transits across the Sun. The ETZ is between $0.520^\\circ$ and\n$0.537^\\circ$ wide due to the non-circular Earth orbit. The restricted ETZ\n(rETZ), where Earth transits the Sun less than 0.5 solar radii from its center,\nis ~$0.262^\\circ$ wide. We first compile a target list of 45 K and 37 G dwarf\nstars inside the rETZ and within 1 kiloparsec (3260 lightyears) using the\nHipparcos catalog. We then greatly enlarge the number of potential targets by\nconstructing an analytic galactic disk model and find that ~$10^5$ K and G\ndwarf stars should reside within the rETZ. The ongoing GAIA space mission can\npotentially discover all G dwarfs among them (several $10^4$) within the next\nfive years. Many more potentially habitable planets orbit dim, unknown M stars\nin the ETZ and other stars that traversed the ETZ long time ago. If any of\nthese planets host intelligent observers, they could have identified Earth as a\nhabitable, or even as a living, world, and we could be receiving their\nbroadcasts today. The K2 mission, the Allen Telescope Array, the upcoming\nSquare Kilometer Array, or the Green Bank Telescope might detect such\ndeliberate extraterrestrial messages. Ultimately, the ETZ would be an ideal\nregion to monitor by the Breakthrough Listen Initiatives, an upcoming survey\nthat will constitute the most comprehensive search for extraterrestrial\nintelligence so far.\n", "  We study the gravitational collapse of a kink within spherical symmetry and\nthe characteristic formulation of General Relativity. We explore some expected\nbut elusive gravitational collapse issues which have not been studied before in\ndetail, finding new features. The numerical one-parametric solution and the\nstructure of the spacetime are calculated using finite differences, Galerkin\ncollocation techniques, and some scripting for automated grid coverage. We\nstudy the threshold of black hole formation and confirm a mass gap in the phase\ntransition. In the supercritical case we find a mass scaling power law\n$M_{BH}={M^*_{BH}}+K[\\lambda-\\lambda^*]^{2\\gamma}+f(K[\\lambda-\\lambda^*]^{2\\gamma})$,\nwith $\\gamma\\approx 0.37$ independent of the initial data for the cases\nconsidered, and $M^*_{BH}$, $K$ and $\\lambda^*$ each depending on the initial\ndatum. The spacetime has a self-similar structure with a period of\n$\\Delta\\approx 3.4$. In the subcritical case the Bondi mass at null infinity\ndecays in cascade with $\\Delta/2$ interval as expected.\n", "  A tidal disruption event (TDE) -- when a star is destroyed by the immense\ngravitational field of a supermassive black hole -- transforms a star into a\nstream of tidally-shredded debris. The properties of this debris ultimately\ndetermine the observable signatures of TDEs. Here we derive a simple,\nself-similar solution for the velocity profile of the debris streams produced\nfrom TDEs, and show that this solution agrees extremely well with numerical\nresults. Using this self-similar solution, we calculate an analytic,\napproximate expression for the radial density profile of the stream. We show\nthat there is a critical adiabatic index that varies as a function of position\nalong the stream above (below) which the stream is unstable (stable) to\ngravitational fragmentation. We also calculate the impact of heating and\ncooling on this stability criterion.\n", "  We review our strategy to study hadron interactions from lattice QCD using\nnewly proposed potential method. We first explain our strategy in the case of\nnuclear potentials and its application to nuclear physics. We then discuss the\norigin of the repulsive core, by adding strange quarks to the system. We also\nexplore a possibility for H-dibaryon to exist in flavor SU(3) limit of lattice\nQCD. We conclude the paper with an application of our strategy to investigate\nthe maximum mass of neutron stars.\n", "  We propose two approaches to cloak the spin waves (magnons) by investigating\nmagnetization dynamics. One approach is based on a spatially inhomogeneous\nanisotropic magnetic moment tensor. The other mechanism is using a spatially\ninhomogeneous anisotropic gyromagnetic factor tensor and an inhomogeneous\nexternal magnetic field. For both approaches, the damping tensor is also\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic. The magnetic characteristic functions of the\nmagnetic materials have been theoretically derived for both mechanisms. A\nnon-magnetic core, which prevents magnons from entering and consequently\ndistorts the spin wave propagation, can be cloaked by a structured magnetic\nshell to redirect the spin wave around the core using the above design\nmechanisms. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed mechanisms in an\nensemble of quantum dot molecules and magnetic semiconductors. The proposed\napproaches shed light on transformation magnonics, and can be utilized for\nfuture spin-wave lenses, concentrators, low back-scattering waveguides, and\nultimately quantum computing.\n", "  The non-thermal spectra of jetted active galactic nuclei show a variety of\nshapes in their low- and high energy components. In some of the brightest\nFermi-LAT blazars, prominent spectral breaks at a few GeV have been regularly\ndetected, which is inconsistent with conventional cooling effects. We study the\neffects of continuous time-dependent injection of electrons into the jet with\ndiffering rates, durations, locations, and power-law spectral indices, and\nevaluate its impact on the ambient emitting particle spectrum at a given\nsnapshot time in the framework of a leptonic blazar emission model. The\nemitting electron spectrum is calculated by Compton cooling the continuously\ninjected electrons, where target photons are assumed to be provided by the\naccretion disk and broad line region. We calculate the non-thermal photon\nspectra produced by inverse Compton scattering of these external target\nradiation fields using the full Compton cross-section in the head-on\napproximation. By means of a comprehensive parameter study we present the\nresulting ambient electron and photon spectra, and discuss the influence of\neach injection parameter. Varying the injection parameters has a notable\ninfluence on the spectral shapes, which can be used to set constraints on the\ninjection scenarios. We apply our model to the flare state spectral energy\ndistribution of 3C454.3, and to the FSRQ PKS1510-089. For both sources we show\ntwo different model fits, corresponding to different injection scenarios. In\nall four injection scenarios impulsive particle injection is disfavored. Our\nmodel aims towards bridging jet emission with acceleration models using a\nphenomenological approach. Blazar spectral data can be analyzed with this model\nto constrain injection parameters, in addition to the conventional parameter\nvalues of steady-state emission models, if sufficient broad multifrequency\ncoverage is provided.\n", "  The quantum-to-classical transition is considered from the point of view of\ncontractions of associative algebras. Various methods and ideas to deal with\ncontractions of associative algebras are discussed that account for a large\nfamily of examples. As an instance of them, the commutative algebra of\nfunctions in phase space, corresponding to classical physical observables, is\nobtained as a contraction of the Moyal star-product which characterizes the\nquantum case. Contractions of associative algebras associated to Lie algebras\nare discussed, in particular the Weyl-Heisenberg and $SU(2)$ groups are\nconsidered.\n", "  Context. Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to\nprobe the internal rotation profile of low-mass (~1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and\nred giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation,\nthe core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main\nsequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than\nobserved. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking\nplace in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature\nof the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar\ninteriors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational\ncoupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using\nthe Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the\nmagnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular\nmomentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree\nof internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a\ndependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial\nrotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data\nis obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the\nratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the\nconvective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ~3. This scaling is\nconsistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the\nAzimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions. We show that an angular\nmomentum transport process whose efficiency varies during the stellar evolution\nthrough a dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required\nto explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of low-mass\nstars.\n", "  Stimulated by the recent observation of the $X(5568)$, we study the $X(5568)$\nand its partners under the tetraquark scenario. In the framework of the\ncolor-magnetic interaction, we estimate the masses of the partner states of the\n$X(5568)$ and discuss their decay pattern, which provide valuable information\non the future experimental search of these states.\n", "  We present an automated procedure that derives simultaneously the effective\ntemperature $T_{eff}$, the surface gravity logg, the metallicity [Fe/H], and\nthe equatorial projected rotational velocity vsini for \"normal\" A and Am stars.\nThe procedure is based on the principal component analysis inversion method of\nPaletou et al. (2015a). A sample of 322 high resolution spectra of F0-B9 stars,\nretrieved from the Polarbase, SOPHIE, and ELODIE databases, were used to test\nthis technique with real data. We have selected the spectral region from\n4400-5000\\AA\\ as it contains many metallic lines and the Balmer H$\\beta$ line.\nUsing 3 datasets at resolving powers of R=42000, 65000 and 76000, about\n6.6x$10^6$ synthetic spectra were calculated to build a large learning\ndatabase. The Online Power Iteration algorithm was applied to these learning\ndatasets to estimate the principal components (PC). The projection of spectra\nonto the few PCs offered an efficient comparison metric in a low dimensional\nspace. The spectra of the well known A0- and A1-type stars, Vega and Sirius A,\nwere used as control spectra in the three databases. Spectra of other well\nknown A-type stars were also employed in order to characterize the accuracy of\nthe inversion technique. All observational spectra were inverted and\natmospheric parameters derived. After removal of a few outliers, the\nPCA-inversion method appears to be very efficient in determining $T_{eff}$,\n[Fe/H], and vsini for A/Am stars. The derived parameters agree very well with\nprevious determinations. Using a statistical approach, deviations of around 150\nK, 0.35 dex, 0.15 dex, and 2 km/s were found for $T_{eff}$, logg, [Fe/H], and\nvsini with respect to literature values for A-type stars. The PCA-inversion\nproves to be a very fast, practical, and reliable tool for estimating stellar\nparameters of FGK and A stars, and deriving effective temperatures of M stars.\n", "  We present Clusterrank, a new algorithm for identifying dispersed\nastrophysical pulses. Such pulses are commonly detected from Galactic pulsars\nand rotating radio transients (RRATs), which are neutron stars with sporadic\nradio emission. More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an\nextragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.\nClusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo\n327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range $23.5\n- 86.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $0.172 - 3.901$ s. The new\npulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the\nrange $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object.\nWe estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for\nbursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all\nnew discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics\nof the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are\ndrawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period\ndistribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of\ncanonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a\nperiodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful complement to\nperiodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population that has so\nfar been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic pulsar\npopulation models.\n", "  Observations of 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 line emission (7-mm wavelength) from AGB\nstars show in some cases peculiar profiles, composed of a central intense\ncomponent plus a wider plateau. Very similar profiles have been observed in CO\nlines from some AGB stars and most post-AGB nebulae and, in these cases, they\nare clearly associated with the presence of conspicuous axial symmetry and\nbipolar dynamics.\n  We present systematic observations of 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in 28 evolved\nstars, performed with the 40~m radio telescope of the IGN in Yebes, Spain. We\nfind that the composite core plus plateau profiles are almost always present in\nO-rich Miras, OH/IR stars, and red supergiants. They are also found in one\nS-type Mira ($\\chi$ Cyg), as well as in two semiregular variables (X Her and RS\nCnc) that are known to show axial symmetry. In the other objects, the profiles\nare simpler and similar to those of other molecular lines. The composite\nstructure appears in the objects in which SiO emission is thought to come from\nthe very inner circumstellar layers, prior to dust formation. The central\nspectral feature is found to be systematically composed of a number of narrow\nspikes, except for X Her and RS Cnc, in which it shows a smooth shape that is\nvery similar to that observed in CO emission. These spikes show a significant\n(and mostly chaotic) time variation, while in all cases the smooth components\nremain constant within the uncertainties. The profile shape could come from the\nsuperposition of standard wide profiles and a group of weak maser spikes.\nAlternatively, we speculate that the very similar profiles detected in objects\nthat are axisymmetric may be indicative of the systematic presence of a\nsignificant axial symmetry in the very inner circumstellar shells around AGB\nstars; the presence of such symmetry would be independent of the probable weak\nmaser effects in the central spikes.\n", "  We present visible polarimetric imaging observations of the well-studied AGB\nstar W Hya taken with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL as well as high spectral resolution\nlong-baseline interferometric observations with the AMBER instrument of the\nVery Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We observed W Hya with\nVLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL at three wavelengths in the continuum (645, 748, and 820 nm),\nin the Halpha line at 656.3 nm, and in the TiO band at 717 nm. The VLTI/AMBER\nobservations were carried out in the wavelength region of the CO first overtone\nlines near 2.3 micron with a spectral resolution of 12000. Taking advantage of\nthe polarimetric imaging capability of SPHERE-ZIMPOL combined with the superb\nadaptive optics performance, we have succeeded in spatially resolving three\nclumpy dust clouds located at ~50 mas (~2 Rstar) from the central star,\nrevealing dust formation very close to the star. The AMBER data in the\nindividual CO lines suggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to ~3 Rstar.\nFurthermore, the SPHERE-ZIMPOL image taken over the Halpha line shows emission\nwith a radius of up to ~160 mas (~7 Rstar). We found that dust, molecular gas,\nand Halpha-emitting hot gas are coexisting within 2--3 Rstar. Our modeling\nsuggests that the observed polarized intensity maps can reasonably be explained\nby large (0.4--0.5 micron) grains of Al2O3 or Mg2SiO4 or MgSiO3 in an optically\nthin shell with an inner boundary radius of 1.9--2.0 Rstar. The observed clumpy\nstructure can be reproduced by a density enhancement by a factor of 4 +/- 1.\nThe grain size derived from our polarimetric images is consistent with the\nprediction of the hydrodynamical models for the mass loss driven by the\nscattering due to micron-sized grains. The detection of the clumpy dust clouds\nclose to the star lends support to the dust formation induced by pulsation and\nlarge convective cells as predicted by the 3-D simulations for AGB stars.\n", "  We study the motion of a particle in a particular magnetic field\nconfiguration both classically and quantum mechanically. For flux-free radially\nsymmetric magnetic fields defined on circular regions, we establish that\nparticle escape speeds depend, classically, on a gauge-fixed magnetic vector\npotential, and demonstrate some trajectories associated with this special type\nof magnetic field. Then we show that some of the geometric features of the\nclassical trajectory (perpendicular exit from the field region, trapped and\nescape behavior) are reproduced quantum mechanically using a numerical method\nthat extends the norm-preserving Crank-Nicolson method to problems involving\nmagnetic fields. While there are similarities between the classical trajectory\nand the position expectation value of the quantum mechanical solution, there\nare also differences, and we demonstrate some of these.\n", "  Methods. We determine the atmospheric parameters and differential abundances\nusing high-resolution ($R \\approx 50 000$), high signal-to-noise (S/N $\\approx$\n110 - 240 per pixel) Keck HIRES spectra for our solar twin candidate, the\npreviously known solar twin HD 45184, and the Sun.\n  Results. For the bright solar twin HD 45184, we found $T_{\\rm{eff}} = 5864\n\\pm 9$ K, log $g = 4.45 \\pm 0.03$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.11 \\pm 0.02$ $\\rm{km\\\n{s}}^{-1}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.04 \\pm 0.01$ dex, which are in good agreement with\nprevious works. The star Inti 1 has atmospheric parameters $T_{\\rm{eff}} = 5837\n\\pm 11$ K, log $g = 4.42 \\pm 0.03$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.04 \\pm 0.02$ $\\rm{km\\\n{s}}^{-1}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.07 \\pm 0.01$ dex that are higher than solar. The\nage and mass of the solar twin HD 45184 (3 Gyr and 1.05 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) and\nthe faint solar twin Inti 1 (4 Gyr and 1.04 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) were estimated\nusing isochrones. The differential analysis shows that HD 45184 presents an\nabundance pattern that is similar to typical nearby solar twins; this means\nthis star has an enhanced refractory relative to volatile elements, while Inti\n1 has an abundance pattern closer to solar, albeit somewhat enhanced in\nrefractories. The abundance pattern of HD 45184 and Inti 1 could be reproduced\nby adding $\\approx 3.5\\ \\rm{M_{\\oplus}}$ and $\\approx 1.5\\ \\rm{M_{\\oplus}}$ of\nEarth-like material to the convective zone of the Sun.\n  Conclusions. The star Inti 1 is a faint solar twin, therefore, it could be\nused to calibrate the zero points of different photometric systems. The distant\nsolar twin Inti 1 has an abundance pattern similar to the Sun with only a minor\nenhancement in the refractory elements. It would be important to analyze other\ndistant solar twins to verify whether they share the Sun's abundance pattern or\nif they are enhanced in refractories, as is the case in the majority of nearby\nsolar twins.\n", "  Combining new gravitational waveforms derived by long-term (14--16 orbits)\nnumerical-relativity simulations with waveforms by an effective-one-body (EOB)\nformalism for coalescing binary neutron stars, we construct hybrid waveforms\nand estimate the measurability for the dimensionless tidal deformability of the\nneutron stars, $\\Lambda$, by advanced gravitational-wave detectors. We focus on\nthe equal-mass case with the total mass $2.7M_\\odot$. We find that for an event\nat a hypothetical effective distance of $D_{\\rm eff}=200$ Mpc, the\ndistinguishable difference in the dimensionless tidal deformability will be\n$\\approx 100$, 400, and 800 at 1-$\\sigma$, 2-$\\sigma$, and 3-$\\sigma$ levels,\nrespectively, for advanced LIGO. If the true equation of state is stiff and the\ntypical neutron-star radius is $R \\gtrsim 13 $ km, our analysis suggests that\nthe radius will be constrained within $\\approx 1$ km at 2-$\\sigma$ level for an\nevent at $D_{\\rm eff}=200$ Mpc. On the other hand, if the true equation of\nstate is soft and the typical neutron-star radius is $R\\lesssim 12$ km , it\nwill be difficult to narrow down the equation of state among many soft ones,\nalthough it is still possible to discriminate the true one from stiff equations\nof state with $R\\gtrsim 13$ km. We also find that gravitational waves from\nbinary neutron stars will be distinguished from those from spinless binary\nblack holes at more than 2-$\\sigma$ level for an event at $D_{\\rm eff}=200$\nMpc. The validity of the EOB formalism, Taylor-T4, and Taylor-F2 approximants\nas the inspiral waveform model is also examined.\n", "  We present new observations of the cataclysmic variable V523 Lyr, a member of\nthe open cluster NGC 6791. The Kepler Space telescope obtained photometric\nobservations of this source and we examine the nearly 3 year long light curve.\nThe observations show numerous small amplitude outbursts recurring on average\nevery 33 days, intermittent quasi-periodic oscillations, and a significant\nfully coherent period of ~3.8 hr which we identify as the orbital period of the\nbinary. Contemporaneous optical spectroscopy of V523 Lyr reveals a faint blue\nsource with broad Balmer absorption lines containing narrow emission cores.\nH$\\alpha$ is in emission above the continuum. The low amplitude of the\nphotometric signal and no detected velocity motion suggest a low orbital\ninclination. We discuss the properties of V523 Lyr and show that it is a member\nof the growing group of anomalous Z Cam type CVs, systems which show stunted\noutbursts, light curve standstills, and occasional deep drops in brightness.\n", "  We report on a 120 ks Chandra/HETG spectrum of the black hole GRS 1915+105.\nThe observation was made during an extended and bright soft state in June,\n2015. An extremely rich disk wind absorption spectrum is detected, similar to\nthat observed at lower sensitivity in 2007. The very high resolution of the\nthird-order spectrum reveals four components to the disk wind in the Fe K band\nalone; the fastest has a blue-shift of v = 0.03c. Broadened re-emission from\nthe wind is also detected in the first-order spectrum, giving rise to clear\naccretion disk P Cygni profiles. Dynamical modeling of the re-emission spectrum\ngives wind launching radii of r ~ 10^(2-4) GM/c^2. Wind density values of n ~\n10^(13-16) cm^-3 are then required by the ionization parameter formalism. The\nsmall launching radii, high density values, and inferred high mass outflow\nrates signal a role for magnetic driving. With simple, reasonable assumptions,\nthe wind properties constrain the magnitude of the emergent magnetic field to B\n~ 10^(3-4) Gauss if the wind is driven via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure\nfrom within the disk, and B ~ 10^(4-5) Gauss if the wind is driven by\nmagnetocentrifugal acceleration. The MHD estimates are below upper limits\npredicted by the canonical alpha-disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). We\ndiscuss these results in terms of fundamental disk physics and black hole\naccretion modes.\n", "  The practically useful criteria of separable states\n$\\rho=\\sum_{k}w_{k}\\rho_{k}$ in $d=2\\times2$ are discussed. The equality\n$G({\\bf a},{\\bf b})= 4[\\langle \\psi|P({\\bf a})\\otimes P({\\bf\nb})|\\psi\\rangle-\\langle \\psi|P({\\bf a})\\otimes{\\bf 1}|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\n\\psi|{\\bf 1}\\otimes P({\\bf b})|\\psi\\rangle]=0$ for any two projection operators\n$P({\\bf a})$ and $P({\\bf b})$ provides a necessary and sufficient separability\ncriterion in the case of a separable pure state\n$\\rho=|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$. We propose the separability criteria of mixed\nstates, which are given by ${\\rm Tr}\\rho\\{{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes {\\bf\nb}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}\\}=(1/3)C\\cos\\varphi$ for two spin $1/2$ systems and $4{\\rm\nTr}\\rho \\{P({\\bf a})\\otimes P({\\bf b})\\}=1+(1/2)C\\cos2\\varphi$ for two photon\nsystems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of ${\\bf a}$\nand ${\\bf b}$ with fixed $\\cos\\varphi={\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf b}$. Here $-1\\leq C\\leq\n1$, and the difference in the numerical coefficients $1/2$ and $1/3$ arises\nfrom the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse\nphoton. If one instead takes an average over the states in the $d=2$ Hilbert\nspace, the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by $4{\\rm Tr}\\rho\n\\{P({\\bf a})\\otimes P({\\bf b})\\}=1+(1/3)C\\cos2\\varphi$.\n  Those separability criteria are shown to be very efficient using the existing\nexperimental data of Aspect et al. in 1981 and Sakai et al. in 2006. When the\nWerner state is applied to two photon systems, it is shown that the Hilbert\nspace average can judge its inseparability but not the geometrical angular\naverage.\n", "  We have measured the concentration, isotopic composition and thermal release\nprofiles of Mercury (Hg) in a suite of meteorites, including both chondrites\nand achondrites. We find large variations in Hg concentration between different\nmeteorites (ca. 10 ppb to 14'000 ppb), with the highest concentration orders of\nmagnitude above the expected bulk solar system silicates value. From the\npresence of several different Hg carrier phases in thermal release profiles\n(150 to 650 {\\deg}C), we argue that these variations are unlikely to be mainly\ndue to terrestrial contamination. The Hg abundance of meteorites shows no\ncorrelation with petrographic type, or mass-dependent fractionation of Hg\nisotopes. Most carbonaceous chondrites show mass-independent enrichments in the\nodd-numbered isotopes 199Hg and 201Hg. We show that the enrichments are not\nnucleosynthetic, as we do not find corresponding nucleosynthetic deficits of\n196Hg. Instead, they can partially be explained by Hg evaporation and\nredeposition during heating of asteroids from primordial radionuclides and\nlate-stage impact heating. Non-carbonaceous chondrites, most achondrites and\nthe Earth do not show these enrichments in vapor-phase Hg. All meteorites\nstudied here have however isotopically light Hg ({\\delta}202Hg = ~-7 to -1)\nrelative to the Earth's average crustal values, which could suggest that the\nEarth has lost a significant fraction of its primordial Hg. However, the late\naccretion of carbonaceous chondritic material on the order of ~2%, which has\nbeen suggested to account for the water, carbon, nitrogen and noble gas\ninventories of the Earth, can also contribute most or all of the Earth's\ncurrent Hg budget. In this case, the isotopically heavy Hg of the Earth's crust\nwould have to be the result of isotopic fractionation between surface and\ndeep-Earth reservoirs.\n", "  The quasinormal modes of relativistic compact objects encode important\ninformation about the gravitational response associated with astrophysical\nphenomena. Detecting such oscillations would provide us with a unique\nunderstanding of the properties of compact stars, and may give definitive\nevidence for the existence of black holes. However, computing quasinormal modes\nin realistic astrophysical environments is challenging due to the complexity of\nthe spacetime background and of the dynamics of the perturbations. We discuss\ntwo complementary methods for computing the quasinormal modes of spherically\nsymmetric astrophysical systems, namely, the direct integration method and the\ncontinued-fraction method. We extend these techniques to dealing with generic\ncoupled systems of linear equations, with the only assumption being the\ninteraction between different fields is effectively localized within a finite\nregion. In particular, we adapt the continued-fraction method to include cases\nwhere a series solution can be obtained only outside an effective region. As an\napplication, we compute the polar quasinormal modes of boson stars by using the\ncontinued-fraction method for the first time. The methods discussed here can be\napplied to other situations in which the perturbations effectively couple only\nwithin a finite region of space.\n", "  The spin-1/2 chain with isotropic exchange J1, J2 > 0 between first and\nsecond neighbors is frustrated for either sign of J1 and has a singlet ground\nstate (GS) for J1/J2 $\\ge - 4$. Its rich quantum phase diagram supports\ngapless, gapped, commensurate (C), incommensurate (IC) and other phases.\nCritical points J1/J2 are evaluated using exact diagonalization (ED) and\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. The wave vector $q_G$\nof spin correlations is related to GS degeneracy and obtained as the peak of\nthe spin structure factor $S(q)$. Variable $q_G$ indicates IC phases in two\n$J1/J2$ intervals, [ -4, -1.24] and [0.44, 2], and a C-IC point at J1/J2 = 2.\nThe decoupled C phase in [-1.24, 0.44] has constant $q_G = {\\pi}/2$,\nnondegenerate GS, and a lowest triplet state with broken spin density on\nsublattices of odd and even numbered sites. The lowest triplet and singlet\nexcitations, $E_m$ and $E_{\\sigma}$, are degenerate in finite systems at\nspecific frustration $J1/J2$. Level crossing extrapolates in the thermodynamic\nlimit to the same critical points as $q_G$. The $S(q)$ peak diverges at $q_G =\n{\\pi}$ in the gapless phase with $J1/J2 > 4.148$ and quasi-long-range order\n(QLRO({$\\pi$})). $S(q)$ diverges at $\\pm {\\pi}/2$ in the decoupled phase with\nQLRO({$\\pi$}/2), but is finite in gapped phases with finite range correlations.\nNumerical results and field theory agree at small $J2/J1$ but disagree for the\ndecoupled phase with weak exchange $J1$ between sublattices. Two related models\nare summarized: one has an exact gapless decoupled phase with QLRO({$\\pi$}/2)\nand no IC phases; the other has a single IC phase without a decoupled phase in\nbetween.\n"]}
