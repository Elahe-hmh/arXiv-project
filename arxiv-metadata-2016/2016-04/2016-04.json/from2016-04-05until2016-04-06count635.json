measurements of the magnetic, transport and thermal properties of\nthe Heusler type compound Fe2VAl0.95. We show that while stoichiometric Fe2VAl\nis a non-magnetic semi-metal a 5% substitution on the Al-site with the 3d\nelements Fe and V atoms leads to a ferromagnetic ground state with a Curie\ntemperature TC = 33+-3 K and a small ordered moment ms = 0.12 mB/Fe in\nFe2VAl0.95. The reduced value of the ratio ms/mp = 0.08, where mp = 1.4 mB/Fe\nis the effective Curie-Weiss moment, together with the analysis of the\nmagnetization data M(H,T), show magnetism is of itinerant nature. The specific\nheat shows an unusual temperature variation at low temperatures with an\nenhanced Sommerfeld coefficient, g = 12 mJK-2mol-1. The resistivity, r(T), is\nmetallic and follows a power law behavior r(T) = r0+AT^n with n = 1.5 below TC.\nWith applying pressure, TC decreases with the rate of (1/TC)(dTC /dP) = -0.061\nGPa-1. We conclude substitution on the Al-site with Fe and V atoms results in\nitinerant ferromagnetism with a low carrier density.\n", "  Analytical studies of the effect of edge decoration on the energy spectrum of\nsemi-infinite one-dimensional (1D) lattice chain with Peierls phase transition\nand zigzag edged graphene (ZEG) are presented by means of transfer matrix\nmethod, in the frame of which the sufficient and necessary conditions for the\nexistence of the edge states are determined. For 1D lattice chain, the\nzero-energy edge state exists when Peierls phase transition happens regardless\nwhether the decoration exists or not, while the non-zero-energy edge states can\nbe induced and manipulated through adjusting the edge decoration. On the other\nhand, the semi-infinite ZEG model with nearest-neighbor interaction can be\nmapped into the 1D lattice chain case. The non-zero-energy edge states can be\ninduced by the decoration as well, and we can obtain the condition of the\ndecoration on the edge for the existence of the novel edge states.\n", "  In all nontrivial cases renormalization, as it is usually formulated, is not\na change of integration variables in the functional integral, plus parameter\nredefinitions, but a set of replacements, of actions and/or field variables and\nparameters. Because of this, we cannot write simple identities relating bare\nand renormalized generating functionals, or generating functionals before and\nafter nonlinear changes of field variables. In this paper we investigate this\nissue and work out a general field-covariant approach to quantum field theory,\nwhich allows us to treat all perturbative changes of field variables, including\nthe relation between bare and renormalized fields, as true changes of variables\nin the functional integral, under which the functionals Z and W = ln Z behave\nas scalars. We investigate the relation between composite fields and changes of\nfield variables, and show that, if J are the sources coupled to the elementary\nfields, all changes of field variables can be expressed as J-dependent\nredefinitions of the sources L coupled to the composite fields. We also work\nout the relation between the renormalization of variable-changes and the\nrenormalization of composite fields. Using our transformation rules it is\npossible to derive the renormalization of a theory in a new variable frame from\nthe renormalization in the old variable frame, without having to calculate it\nanew. We define several approaches, useful for different purposes, in\nparticular a linear approach where all variable changes are described as linear\nsource redefinitions. We include a number of explicit examples.\n", "  We study a new generating functional of one-particle irreducible diagrams in\nquantum field theory, called master functional, which is invariant under the\nmost general perturbative changes of field variables. The usual functional\nGamma does not behave as a scalar under the transformation law inherited from\nits very definition as the Legendre transform of W = ln Z, although it does\nbehave as a scalar under an unusual transformation law. The master functional,\non the other hand, is the Legendre transform of an improved functional W with\nrespect to the sources coupled to both elementary and composite fields. The\ninclusion of certain improvement terms in W and Z is necessary to make the new\nLegendre transform well defined. The master functional behaves as a scalar\nunder the transformation law inherited from its very definition. Moreover, it\nadmits a proper formulation, obtained extending the set of integrated fields to\nso-called proper fields, which allows us to work without passing through Z, W\nor Gamma. In the proper formulation the classical action coincides with the\nclassical limit of the master functional, and correlation functions and\nrenormalization are calculated applying the usual diagrammatic rules to the\nproper fields. Finally, the most general change of field variables, including\nthe map relating bare and renormalized fields, is a linear redefinition of the\nproper fields.\n", "  We develop a general field-covariant approach to quantum gauge theories.\nExtending the usual set of integrated fields and external sources to \"proper\"\nfields and sources, which include partners of the composite fields, we define\nthe master functional Omega, which collects one-particle irreducible diagrams\nand upgrades the usual Gamma-functional in several respects. The functional\nOmega is determined from its classical limit applying the usual diagrammatic\nrules to the proper fields. Moreover, it behaves as a scalar under the most\ngeneral perturbative field redefinitions, which can be expressed as linear\ntransformations of the proper fields. We extend the Batalin-Vilkovisky\nformalism and the master equation. The master functional satisfies the extended\nmaster equation and behaves as a scalar under canonical transformations. The\nmost general perturbative field redefinitions and changes of gauge-fixing can\nbe encoded in proper canonical transformations, which are linear and do not mix\nintegrated fields and external sources. Therefore, they can be applied as true\nchanges of variables in the functional integral, instead of mere replacements\nof integrands. This property overcomes a major difficulty of the functional\nGamma. Finally, the new approach allows us to prove the renormalizability of\ngauge theories in a general field-covariant setting. We generalize known\ncohomological theorems to the master functional and show that when there are no\ngauge anomalies all divergences can be subtracted by means of parameter\nredefinitions and proper canonical transformations.\n", "  This is the first of a series of papers in which we introduce and study a\nrigorous \"simplicial\" realization of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons path integral\nfor manifolds M of the form M = Sigma x S1 and arbitrary simply-connected\ncompact structure groups G. More precisely, we introduce, for general links L\nin M, a rigorous simplicial version WLO_{rig}(L) of the corresponding Wilson\nloop observable WLO(L) in the so-called \"torus gauge\" by Blau and Thompson\n(Nucl. Phys. B408(2):345-390, 1993). For a simple class of links L we then\nevaluate WLO_{rig}(L) explicitly in a non-perturbative way, finding agreement\nwith Turaev's shadow invariant |L|.\n", "  In this short note we show how Dubrovin's integrable hierarchies, defined\nusing the Gromov-Witten theory of a closed symplectic manifold, generalizes to\nHamiltonian Floer theory. In particular, we show how the required\ngeneralization of the PSS isomorphism, relating Gromov-Witten theory and\nHamiltonian Floer theory, can be constructed in the framework of\nEliashberg-Givental-Hofer's symplectic field theory.\n", "  Motivated by the increasing interest in the properties of multimode\noptomechanical devices, here we study a system in which a driven mode of a\nlarge-area optical cavity is despersively coupled to a deformable mechanical\nelement. Two different models naturally appear in such scenario, for which we\npredict the formation of periodic patterns, localized structures (cavity\nsolitons), and domain walls, among other complex nonlinear phenomena. Further,\nwe propose a realistic design based on intracavity membranes where our models\ncan be studied experimentally. Apart from its relevance to the field of\nnonlinear optics, the results put forward here are a necessary step towards\nunderstanding the quantum properties of optomechanical systems in the multimode\nregime of both the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom.\n", "  This introductory part of the author's PhD compilation thesis discusses\nnon-perturbative aspects of string theory, with focus on D-instantons which\nplay key roles in the context of string phenomenology and dualities. By\ntranslating ideas from ordinary instanton calculus in field theory, D-instanton\ncalculus is formulated and applied to supersymmetric gauge theories realized as\nworld volume theories of spacefilling D-branes in non-trivial backgrounds. We\nshow that, for configurations in which certain fermionic D-instanton zero modes\nare either lifted or projected out, new couplings, which may be forbidden at\nthe perturbative level, are generated in the effective action, even though\ntheir origin does not admit an obvious interpretation in terms of ordinary\nfield theory. Such couplings are of great relevance for semi-realistic MSSM/GUT\nmodels since they can correspond to Yukawa couplings, Majorana mass terms for\nright-handed neutrinos or Polonyi terms, relevant for supersymmetry breaking.\nIn the last part, we make use of various string dualities in order to compute\nmulti-instanton corrections which are otherwise technically difficult to obtain\nfrom explicit D-instanton calculations. We compute one-loop diagrams with BPS\nparticles in type IIA string theory configurations, involving spacefilling\nD-branes and orientifolds, and obtain exact quantum corrections in the dual\ntype IIB picture, including infinite series of D-instanton contributions. By\nlifting the one-loop calculations to the M-theory picture, we obtain a\ngeometric understanding of the non-perturbative sector of a wide range of gauge\ntheories and elucidate the underlying symmetries of the effective action.\n", "  We investigate the renormalization of gauge theories without assuming\ncohomological properties. We define a renormalization algorithm that preserves\nthe Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation at each step and automatically extends\nthe classical action till it contains sufficiently many independent parameters\nto reabsorb all divergences into parameter-redefinitions and canonical\ntransformations. The construction is then generalized to the master functional\nand the field-covariant proper formalism for gauge theories. Our results hold\nin all manifestly anomaly-free gauge theories, power-counting renormalizable or\nnot. The extension algorithm allows us to solve a quadratic problem, such as\nfinding a sufficiently general solution of the master equation, even when it is\nnot possible to reduce it to a linear (cohomological) problem.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a progressively\nbended three dimensional cigar shaped potential. The interplay between geometry\nand nonlinearity is considered. At high curvature, topological localization\noccurs and becomes frustrated by the generation of curved dispersive\nshock-waves when the strength of nonlinearity is increased. The analysis is\nsupported by four-dimensional parallel simulations.\n", "  The excitations of the 7/3 fractional Hall state, one of the most prominent\nstates in the second Landau level, are not understood. We study the effect of\nscreening by composite fermion excitons and find that it causes a strong\nrenormalization at 7/3, thanks to a relatively small exciton gap and a\nrelatively large residual interaction between composite fermions. The\nexcitations of the 7/3 state are to be viewed as composite fermions dressed by\na large exciton cloud. Their wide extent has implications for experiments as\nwell as for analysis of finite system exact diagonalization studies.\n", "  We study limits of vacuum, isotropic universes in the full, effective,\nfour-dimensional theory with higher derivatives. We show that all flat vacua as\nwell as general curved ones are globally attracted by the standard, square root\nscaling solution at early times. Open vacua asymptote to horizon-free, Milne\nstates in both directions while closed universes exhibit more complex\nlogarithmic singularities, starting from initial data sets of a possibly\nsmaller dimension. We also discuss the relation of our results to the\nasymptotic stability of the passage through the singularity in ekpyrotic and\ncyclic cosmologies.\n", "  An extension of a previously developed rock physics model is made that\nquantifies the relationship between the ductile fraction of a brittle/ductile\nbinary mixture and the isotropic seismic reflection response. By making a weak\nscattering (Born) approximation and plane wave (eikonal) approximation, with a\nsubsequent ordering according to the angle of incidence, singular value\ndecomposition analysis are done to understand the stack weightings, number of\nstacks, and the type of stacks that will optimally estimate the two fundamental\nrock physics parameters. Through this angle ordering, it is found that\neffective wavelets can be used for the stacks up to second order. Finally, it\nis concluded that the full PP stack and the \"full\" PS stack are the two optimal\nstacks needed to estimate the two rock physics parameters. They dominate over\nboth the second order AVO \"gradient\" stack and the higher order (4th order) PP\nstack (even at large angles of incidence). Using this result and model based\nBayesian inversion, the detectability of the ductile fraction (shown by others\nto be the important quantity for the geomechanical response of unconventional\nreservoir fracking) is demonstrated on a model characteristic of the Marcellus\nshale play.\n", "  Turbulence facilitates collisions between particles suspended in a turbulent\nflow. Two effects have been proposed which can enhance the collision rate at\nhigh turbulence intensities: 'preferential concentration' (a clustering\nphenomenon) and the 'sling effect' (arising from the formation of caustic folds\nin the phase-space of the suspended particles). We have determined numerically\nthe collision rate of small heavy particles as a function of their size and\ndensities. The dependence on particle densities reveals that the enhancement by\nturbulence of the collision rate of particles with significant inertia is due\nalmost entirely to the sling effect.\n", "  We derive the \"conservation law\" for nematic polymers in tensorial form valid\nfor quadrupolar orientational order in contradistinction to the conservation\nlaw in the case of polar orientational order. Due to microscopic differences in\nthe coupling between the orientational field deformations and the density\nvariations for polar and quadrupolar order, we find that respective order\nparameters satisfy fundamentally distinct constraints. Being necessarily scalar\nin its form, the tensorial conservation law is obtained straightforwardly from\nthe gradients of the polymer nematic tensor field and connects the spatial\nvariation of this tensor field with density variations. We analyze the\ndifferences between the polar and the tensorial forms of the conservation law,\npresent some explicit orientational fields that satisfy this new constraint and\ndiscuss the role of singular \"hairpins\", which do not affect local quadrupolar\norder of polymer nematics, but nevertheless influence its gradients.\n", "  In turbulent suspensions, collision rates determine how rapidly particles\ncoalesce or react with each other. To determine the collision rate, many\nnumerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which\nsimply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold\ndistance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully\nresolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds\nnumber (R_\\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of\nmultiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic\noverestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the\nparticle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases. We\ninvestigate the probability P(N) for a given pair of ghost particles colliding\nN times. We find P(N)=\\beta \\alpha^N for N_>1, where \\alpha and \\beta are\ncoefficients which depend upon the particle inertia. This result is used to\nexplain the discrepancy between the GCA and the true collision rates. We also\ninvestigate the statistics of the times that ghost particles remain in contact.\nWe show that the probability density function of the contact time is different\nfor the first collision. The difference is explained by the effect of caustics\nin the phase space of the suspended particles.\n", "  When a disordered solid is sheared, yielding is followed by the onset of\nintermittent response that is characterized by slip in local regions usually\nlabeled shear-transformation zones (STZ). Such intermittent response resembles\nthe behavior of earthquakes or contact depinning, where a well-defined\nlandscape of pinning disorder prohibits the deformation of an elastic medium.\nNevertheless, a disordered solid is evidently different in that pinning\nbarriers of particles are due to neighbors that are also subject to motion.\nMicroscopic yielding leads to destruction of the local microstructure and local\nheating. It is natural to assume that locally a liquid emerges for a finite\ntimescale before cooling down to a transformed configuration. For including\nthis characteristic transient in glass depinning models, we propose a general\nmechanism that involves a \"pin-delay\" time Tpd, during which each region that\nslipped evolves as a fluid. The new timescale can be as small as a single\navalanche time-step. We demonstrate that the inclusion of this mechanism causes\na drift of the critical exponents towards higher values for the slip sizes\n$\\tau$, until a transition to permanent shear-banding behavior happens causing\nalmost oscillatory, stick-slip response. Moreover, it leads to a proliferation\nof large events that are highly inhomogeneous and resemble sharp slip band\nformation. Our model appears to be qualitatively consistent with recent\nexperiments and simulations of disordered solids under shear.\n", "  Constraint satisfaction problems are a central pillar of modern computational\ncomplexity theory. This survey provides an introduction to the rapidly growing\nfield of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity, which includes the study of quantum\nconstraint satisfaction problems. Over the past decade and a half, this field\nhas witnessed fundamental breakthroughs, ranging from the establishment of a\n\"Quantum Cook-Levin Theorem\" to deep insights into the structure of 1D\nlow-temperature quantum systems via so-called area laws. Our aim here is to\nprovide a computer science-oriented introduction to the subject in order to\nhelp bridge the language barrier between computer scientists and physicists in\nthe field. As such, we include the following in this survey: (1) The\nmotivations and history of the field, (2) a glossary of condensed matter\nphysics terms explained in computer-science friendly language, (3) overviews of\ncentral ideas from condensed matter physics, such as indistinguishable\nparticles, mean field theory, tensor networks, and area laws, and (4) brief\nexpositions of selected computer science-based results in the area. For\nexample, as part of the latter, we provide a novel information theoretic\npresentation of Bravyi's polynomial time algorithm for Quantum 2-SAT.\n", "  We present K-band spectra of rest-frame optical emission lines for 24\nstar-forming galaxies at z~3.2-3.7 using MOSFIRE on the Keck 1 telescope.\nStrong rest-frame optical [O III] and Hbeta emission lines were detected in 18\nLBGs. The median flux ratio of [O III]5007 to Hbeta is 5.1+/-0.5, a factor of\n5-10x higher than in local galaxies with similar stellar masses. The observed\nHbeta luminosities are in good agreement with expectations from the estimated\nstar-formation rates, and none of our sources are detected in deep X-ray\nstacks, ruling out significant contamination by active galactic nuclei.\nCombining our sample with a variety of LBGs from the literature, including 49\ngalaxies selected in a very similar manner, we find a high median ratio of\n[OIII]/Hbeta = 4.8+0.8-1.7. This high ratio seems to be an ubiquitous feature\nof z~3-4 LBGs, very different from typical local star-forming galaxies at\nsimilar stellar masses. The only comparable systems at z~0 are those with\nsimilarly high specific star-formation rates, though ~5x lower stellar masses.\nHigh specific star-formation rates either result in a much higher ionization\nparameter or other unusual conditions for the interstellar medium, which result\nin a much higher [OIII]/Hbeta line ratio. This implies a strong relation\nbetween a global property of a galaxy, the specific star-formation rate, and\nthe local conditions of ISM in star-forming regions.\n", "  The use of simplified models of turbulent flows provides an appealing\npossibility to study the collision rate of turbulent suspensions, especially in\nconditions relevant to astrophysics, which require large time scale\nseparations. To check the validity of such approaches, we used a direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) velocity field, which satisfies the Navier-Stokes\nequations (although it neglects the effect of the suspended particles on the\nflow field), and a kinematic simulation (KS) velocity field, which is a random\nfield designed so that its statistics are in accord with the Kolmogorov theory\nfor fully-developed turbulence. In the limit where the effects of particle\ninertia (characterised by the Stokes number) are negligible, the collision\nrates from the two approaches agree. As the Stokes number St increases,\nhowever, we show that the DNS collision rate exceeds the KS collision rate by\norders of magnitude. We propose an explanation for this phenomenon and explore\nits consequences. We discuss the collision rate $R$ for particles in high\nReynolds number flows at large Stokes number, and present evidence that\n$R\\propto \\sqrt{{\\rm St}}$.\n", "  We reconsider the Adler-Bardeen theorem for the cancellation of gauge\nanomalies to all orders, when they vanish at one loop. Using the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism and combining the dimensional-regularization\ntechnique with the higher-derivative gauge invariant regularization, we prove\nthe theorem in the most general perturbatively unitary renormalizable gauge\ntheories coupled to matter in four dimensions, and identify the subtraction\nscheme where anomaly cancellation to all orders is manifest, namely no\nsubtractions of finite local counterterms are required from two loops onwards.\nOur approach is based on an order-by-order analysis of renormalization, and,\ndifferently from most derivations existing in the literature, does not make use\nof arguments based on the properties of the renormalization group. As a\nconsequence, the proof we give also applies to conformal field theories and\nfinite theories.\n", "  We predict that a single-level quantum dot without discernible splitting of\nits spin states develops a spin-precession resonance in charge transport when\nembedded into a spin valve. The resonance occurs in the generic situation of\nCoulomb blockaded transport with ferromagnetic leads whose polarizations\ndeviate from perfect antiparallel alignment. The resonance appears when\nelectrically tuning the interaction-induced exchange field perpendicular to one\nof the polarizations -- a simple condition relying on vectors in contrast to\nusual resonance conditions associated with energy splittings. The spin\nresonance can be detected by stationary dI/dV spectroscopy and by oscillations\nin the time-averaged current using a gate-pulsing scheme. The generic\nnoncollinearity of the ferromagnets and junction asymmetry allow for an\nall-electric determination of the spin-injection asymmetry, the anisotropy of\nspin relaxation, and the magnitude of the exchange field. We also investigate\nthe impact of a nearby superconductor on the resonance position. Our simplistic\nmodel turns out to be generic for a broad class of coherent few-level quantum\nsystems.\n", "  The SMARDDA software library is used to model plasma interaction with complex\nengineered surfaces. A simple flux-tube model of power deposition necessitates\nthe following of magnetic fieldlines until they meet geometry taken from a CAD\n(Computer Aided Design) database. Application is made to 1) models of ITER\ntokamak limiter geometry and 2) MASTU tokamak divertor designs, illustrating\nthe accuracy and effectiveness of SMARDDA, even in the presence of significant\nnonaxisymmetric ripple field. SMARDDA's ability to exchange data with CAD\ndatabases and its speed of execution also give it the potential for use\ndirectly in the design of tokamak plasma facing components.\n", "  In this article we discuss some aspects of solar physics from the standpoint\nof the so-called chameleon fields (i.e. quantum fields, typically scalar, where\nthe mass is an increasing function of the matter density of the environment).\nFirstly, we analyze the effects of a chameleon-induced deviation from standard\ngravity just below the surface of the Sun. In particular, we develop solar\nmodels which take into account the presence of the chameleon and we show that\nthey are inconsistent with the helioseismic data. This inconsistency presents\nitself not only with the typical chameleon set-up discussed in the literature\n(where the mass scale of the potential is fine-tuned to the meV), but also if\nwe remove the fine-tuning on the scale of the potential. Secondly, we point out\nthat, in a model recently considered in the literature (we call this model\n\"Modified Fujii's Model\"), a conceivable interpretation of the solar\noscillations is given by quantum vacuum fluctuations of a chameleon.\n", "  In this work we study the applicability of the GGE to integrable one\ndimensional systems with bound states. We find that the GGE fails to describe\nthe long time dynamics for most initial states including eigenstates. We\npresent our calculations studying the attractive Lieb-Liniger gas and the XXZ\nmagnet, though similar results may be obtained for other models.\n", "  Given its importance to many other areas of physics, from condensed matter\nphysics to thermodynamics, time-reversal symmetry has had relatively little\ninfluence on quantum information science. Here we develop a network-based\npicture of time-reversal theory, classifying Hamiltonians and quantum circuits\nas time-symmetric or not in terms of the elements and geometries of their\nunderlying networks. Many of the typical circuits of quantum information\nscience are found to exhibit time-asymmetry. Moreover, we show that\ntime-asymmetry in circuits can be controlled using local gates only, and can\nsimulate time-asymmetry in Hamiltonian evolution. We experimentally implement a\nfundamental example in which controlled time-reversal asymmetry in a\npalindromic quantum circuit leads to near-perfect transport. Our results pave\nthe way for using time-symmetry breaking to control coherent transport, and\nimply that time-asymmetry represents an omnipresent yet poorly understood\neffect in quantum information science.\n", "  The second-order differential equation for a damped harmonic oscillator can\nbe converted to two coupled first-order equations, with two two-by-two matrices\nleading to the group $Sp(2)$. It is shown that this oscillator system contains\nthe essential features of Wigner's little groups dictating the internal\nspace-time symmetries of particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. The little\ngroups are the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations leave the\nfour-momentum of a given particle invariant. It is shown that the damping modes\nof the oscillator correspond to the little groups for massive and\nimaginary-mass particles respectively. When the system makes the transition\nfrom the oscillation to damping mode, it corresponds to the little group for\nmassless particles. Rotations around the momentum leave the four-momentum\ninvariant. This degree of freedom extends the $Sp(2)$ symmetry to that of\n$SL(2,c)$ corresponding to the Lorentz group applicable to the four-dimensional\nMinkowski space. The Poincar\\'e sphere contains the $SL(2,c)$ symmetry. In\naddition, it has a non-Lorentzian parameter allowing us to reduce the mass\ncontinuously to zero. It is thus possible to construct the little group for\nmassless particles from that of the massive particle by reducing its mass to\nzero. Spin-1/2 particles and spin-1 particles are discussed in detail.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence relates quantum entanglement between boundary\nConformal Field Theories and geometric connections in the dual asymptotically\nAnti-de Sitter space-time. We consider entangled states in the n-fold tensor\nproduct of a 1+1 dimensional CFT Hilbert space defined by the Euclidean path\nintegral over a Riemann surface with n holes. In one region of moduli space,\nthe dual bulk state is a black hole with n asymptotically AdS_3 regions\nconnected by a common wormhole, while in other regions the bulk fragments into\ndisconnected components. We study the entanglement structure and compute the\nwave function explicitly in the puncture limit of the Riemann surface in terms\nof CFT n-point functions. We also use AdS minimal surfaces to measure\nentanglement more generally. In some regions of the moduli space the\nentanglement is entirely multipartite, though not of the GHZ type. However,\neven when the bulk is completely connected, in some regions of the moduli space\nthe entanglement is almost entirely bipartite: significant entanglement occurs\nonly between pairs of CFTs. We develop new tools to analyze intrinsically\nn-partite entanglement, and use these to show that for some wormholes with n\nsimilar sized horizons there is intrinsic entanglement between at least n-1\nparties, and that the distillable entanglement between the asymptotic regions\nis at least (n+1)/2 partite.\n", "  Individual impurity atoms in silicon can make superb individual qubits, but\nit remains an immense challenge to build a multi-qubit processor: There is a\nbasic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit\ninteractions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and\naddressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve\nthis conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing\nusing solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one\nanother. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically\nseparate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin\ndipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total\nphase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path.\nWe introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being\nimperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that\nthe surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are\nsubstantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We\nconclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the\ndifficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the\ncomplexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude\ngreater than other systems.\n", "  The formation of planetary cores must proceed rapidly in order for the giant\nplanets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the\nprotoplanetary gas disc (<3 Myr). In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation\nof planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be\naccreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be\nefficient, and resonant trapping poses a further hurdle. Here we instead\ninvestigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural\noutcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We\nconstruct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in\nthe outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of\nthe solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key\nquantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We\nfind that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the\ninside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall\nefficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50 %\nfor planetary architectures similar to the Solar System. Growth by pebble\naccretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic Type\nI migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large\nradial extent (~100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our\nfindings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected\naround low-mass stars (<1 M_sun), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not\neasily form gas-giant planets (M > 100 M_E), but preferentially form\nNeptune-mass planets or smaller (< 10 M_E). This is consistent with exoplanet\nsurveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low\nmass or low metallicity.\n", "  In this letter we address the issue of generating appropriate tiny neutrino\nmasses within the framework of a particular $SU(3)_{c}\\otimes SU(3)_{L}\\otimes\nU(1)_{X}$ gauge model by adding three singlet exotic Majorana neutrinos to the\nones included in the three lepton triplet representations. The theoretical\ndevice is the general method of treating gauge models with high symmetries\n$SU(3)_{c}\\otimes SU(N)_{L}\\otimes U(1)_{X}$ proposed by Cot\\u{a}escu more than\na decade ago. When it is worked-out in the 3-3-1 model it supplies a unique\nfree parameter ($a$) to be tuned in order to get a realistic mass spectrum for\nboth the boson and charged-fermion sectors. Its most appealing feature (of\nspecial interest here) is that it contains all the needed ingredients to\nrealize the inverse seesaw mechanism for neutrinos. The mandatory couplings\nleading to the lepton number soft violation in pure Majorana terms result\nwithout invoking any element outside the model (such as GUT scales, as one\nusually does in the literature). The overall breaking scale in this particular\nmodel can be set around 1 TeV so its phenomenology is quite testable at present\nfacilities.\n", "  The Hubbard model may be the simplest model of particles interacting on a\nlattice, but simulation of its dynamics remains beyond the reach of current\nnumerical methods. In this article, we show that general quantum computations\ncan be encoded into the physics of wave packets propagating through a planar\ngraph, with scattering interactions governed by the fermionic Hubbard model.\nTherefore, simulating the model on planar graphs is as hard as simulating\nquantum computation. We give two different arguments, demonstrating that the\nsimulation is difficult both for wave packets prepared as excitations of the\nfermionic vacuum, and for hole wave packets at filling fraction one-half in the\nlimit of strong coupling. In the latter case, which is described by the t-J\nmodel, there is only reflection and no transmission in the scattering events,\nas would be the case for classical hard spheres. In that sense, the\nconstruction provides a quantum mechanical analog of the Fredkin-Toffoli\nbilliard ball computer.\n", "  Fidelity is a fundamental and ubiquitous concept in quantum information\ntheory. Fuchs-van de Graaf's inequalities deal with bounding fidelity from\nabove and below. In this paper, we give a lower bound on the quantum fidelity\nbetween two states in terms of their trace-norm distance and their max-relative\nentropy.\n", "  In this paper we examine robust clustering behaviour with multiple nontrivial\nclusters for identically and globally coupled phase oscillators. These systems\nare such that the dynamics is completely determined by the number of\noscillators N and a single scalar function $g(\\varphi)$ (the coupling\nfunction). Previous work has shown that (a) any clustering can stably appear\nvia choice of a suitable coupling function and (b) open sets of coupling\nfunctions can generate heteroclinic network attractors between cluster states\nof saddle type, though there seem to be no examples where saddles with more\nthan two nontrivial clusters are involved. In this work we clarify the\nrelationship between the coupling function and the dynamics. We focus on cases\nwhere the clusters are inequivalent in the sense of not being related by a\ntemporal symmetry, and demonstrate that there are coupling functions that give\nrobust heteroclinic networks between periodic states involving three or more\nnontrivial clusters. We consider an example for N=6 oscillators where the\nclustering is into three inequivalent clusters. We also discuss some aspects of\nthe bifurcation structure for periodic multi-cluster states and show that the\ntransverse stability of inequivalent clusters can, to a large extent, be varied\nindependently of the tangential stability.\n", "  We investigate the resources needed for secure teleportation of coherent\nstates. We extend continuous variable teleportation to include quantum\ntele-amplification protocols, that allow non-unity classical gains and a\npre-amplification or post-attenuation of the coherent state. We show that, for\narbitrary Gaussian protocols and a significant class of Gaussian resources,\ntwo-way steering is required to achieve a teleportation fidelity beyond the\nno-cloning threshold. This provides an operational connection between Gaussian\nsteerability and secure teleportation. We present practical recipes suggesting\nthat heralded noiseless pre-amplification may enable high-fidelity heralded\nteleportation, using minimally entangled yet steerable resources.\n", "  In the context of holographic duality with AdS3 asymptotics, the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula states that the entanglement entropy of a subregion is\ngiven by the length of a certain bulk geodesic. The entanglement entropy can be\noperationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the\nsubregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a\nreference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\ntheoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more\ngeneral bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new\ntask called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary\nsubregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale\nin a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that\nthe cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of\nconstrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the\nsigned length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,\nconstrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This\ndemonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the\nlength of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that\nit uses the minimum amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we\nadditionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for\nintervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge\nare well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts. We also revisit the\nrelationship between the differential entropy and the maximum entropy among\nlocally consistent density operators, demonstrating large quantitative\ndiscrepancy between the two quantities in conformal field theories.\n", "  We investigate valence-bond-solid (VBS) phases in one-dimensional spin\nsystems by an effective field theory developed by Schulz [Phys. Rev. B 34, 6372\n(1986)]. While the distinction among the VBS phases are often understood in\nterms of different entanglement structures protected by certain symmetries, we\nadopt a different but more fundamental point of view, that is, different VBS\nphases are separated by a gap closing under certain symmetries. In this way,\nthe effective field theory reproduces the known three symmetries: time\nreversal, bond-centered inversion, and dihedral group of spin rotations. It\nalso predicts that there exists another symmetry: site-centered inversion\ncombined with a spin rotation by $\\pi$. We demonstrate that the last symmetry\ngives distinct trivial phases, which cannot be characterized by their\nentanglement structure, in terms of a simple perturbative analysis in a spin\nchain. We also discuss several applications of the effective field theory to\nthe phase transitions among VBS phases in microscopic models and an extension\nof the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to non-translational-invariant systems.\n", "  The recent realization of synthetic spin-orbit coupling represents an\noutstanding achievement in the physics of ultracold quantum gases. In this\nreview we explore the properties of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strengths. This system presents a\nrich phase diagram, which exhibits a tricritical point separating a\nzero-momentum phase, a spin-polarized plane-wave phase, and a stripe phase. In\nthe stripe phase translational invariance is spontaneously broken, in analogy\nwith supersolids. Spin-orbit coupling also strongly affects the dynamics of the\nsystem. In particular, the excitation spectrum exhibits intriguing features,\nincluding the suppression of the sound velocity, the emergence of a roton\nminimum in the plane-wave phase, and the appearance of a double gapless band\nstructure in the stripe phase. Finally, we discuss a combined procedure to make\nthe stripes visible and stable, thus allowing for a direct experimental\ndetection.\n", "  In complex systems, the network of interactions we observe between system's\ncomponents is the aggregate of the interactions that occur through different\nmechanisms or layers. Recent studies reveal that the existence of multiple\ninteraction layers can have a dramatic impact in the dynamical processes\noccurring on these systems. However, these studies assume that the interactions\nbetween systems components in each one of the layers are known, while typically\nfor real-world systems we do not have that information. Here, we address the\nissue of uncovering the different interaction layers from aggregate data by\nintroducing multilayer stochastic block models (SBMs), a generalization of\nsingle-layer SBMs that considers different mechanisms of layer aggregation.\nFirst, we find the complete probabilistic solution to the problem of finding\nthe optimal multilayer SBM for a given aggregate observed network. Because this\nsolution is computationally intractable, we propose an approximation that\nenables us to verify that multilayer SBMs are more predictive of network\nstructure in real-world complex systems.\n", "  Using photo-emission electron microscopy with X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism as a contrast mechanism, new insights into the all-optical\nmagnetization switching (AOS) phenomenon in GdFe based rare-earth transition\nmetal ferrimagnetic alloys are provided. From a sequence of static images taken\nafter single linearly polarized laser pulse excitation, the repeatability of\nAOS can be measured with a correlation coefficient. It is found that low\ncoercivity enables thermally activated domain wall motion, limiting in turn the\nrepeatability of the switching. Time-resolved measurement of the magnetization\ndynamics reveal that while AOS occurs below and above the magnetization\ncompensation temperature $T_\\text{M}$, it is not observed in GdFe samples where\n$T_\\text{M}$ is absent. Finally, AOS is experimentally demonstrated against an\napplied magnetic field of up to 180 mT.\n", "  We present the evolution of dark matter halos in six large cosmological\nN-body simulations, called the $\\nu^2$GC (New Numerical Galaxy Catalog)\nsimulations on the basis of the LCDM cosmology consistent with observational\nresults obtained by the Planck satellite. The largest simulation consists of\n$8192^3$ (550 billion) dark matter particles in a box of $1.12 \\, h^{-1} \\rm\nGpc$ (a mass resolution of $2.20 \\times 10^{8} \\, h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$). Among\nsimulations utilizing boxes larger than $1 \\, h^{-1} \\rm Gpc$, our simulation\nyields the highest resolution simulation that has ever been achieved. A\n$\\nu^2$GC simulation with the smallest box consists of eight billions particles\nin a box of $70 \\, h^{-1} \\rm Mpc$ (a mass resolution of $3.44 \\times 10^{6} \\,\nh^{-1} M_{\\odot}$). These simulations can follow the evolution of halos over\nmasses of eight orders of magnitude, from small dwarf galaxies to massive\nclusters. Using the unprecedentedly high resolution and powerful statistics of\nthe $\\nu^2$GC simulations, we provide statistical results of the halo mass\nfunction, mass accretion rate, formation redshift, and merger statistics, and\npresent accurate fitting functions for the Planck cosmology. By combining the\n$\\nu^2$GC simulations with our new semi-analytic galaxy formation model, we are\nable to prepare mock catalogs of galaxies and active galactic nuclei, which\nwill be made publicly available in the near future.\n", "  The superconformal index of a three-dimensional supersymmetric field theory\ncan be expressed in terms of basic hypergeometric integrals. By comparing the\nindices of dual theories, one can find new integral identities for basic\nhypergeometric integrals. Some of these integral identities have the form of\nthe pentagon identity which can be interpreted as the 2-3 Pachner move for\ntriangulated 3-manifolds.\n", "  We calculate the zeroes of angular observables $P_4^{'}$ and $P_5^{'}$ of 4 -\nbody angular distribution of $B\\rightarrow K^{*} (\\rightarrow K \\pi) l^+ l^-$\nwhere LHCb, in its analysis of form factor independent angular observables, has\nfound deviations from standard model predictions in one of the $q^2$ bins. In\nthe large recoil region, we obtain relations between the zeroes of $P_4^{'}$,\n$P_5^{'}$ and the zero of forward-backward asymmetry of lepton pair. These\nrelations, in the considered region, are independent of hadronic uncertainties\nand depend only on Wilson coefficients. We also construct a new observable,\n$\\mathcal{O}_T^{L,R}$, whose zero in the standard model coincides with the zero\nof forward-backward asymmetry but in presence of new physics contributions will\nshow different behavior. Moreover, the profile of the new observable, even\nwithin the standard model, is very different from the forward backward\nasymmetry. We point out that precise measurements of these zeroes in near\nfuture would provide crucial test of the standard model and would be useful in\ndistinguishing between different possible new physics contributions to Wilson\ncoefficients.\n", "  We compute the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor of one-dimensional\nliquid $^4$He by means of state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo and analytic\ncontinuation techniques. By increasing the density, the dynamical structure\nfactor reveals a transition from a highly compressible critical liquid to a\nquasi-solid regime. In the low-energy limit, the dynamical structure factor can\nbe described by the quantum hydrodynamic Luttinger liquid theory, with a\nLuttinger parameter spanning all possible values by increasing the density. At\nhigher energies, our approach provides quantitative results beyond the\nLuttinger liquid theory. In particular, as the density increases, the interplay\nbetween dimensionality and interaction makes the dynamical structure factor\nmanifest a pseudo {\\it{particle-hole}} continuum typical of fermionic systems.\nAt the low-energy boundary of such region and moderate densities, we find\nconsistency, within statistical uncertainties, with predictions of a power-law\nstructure by the recently-developed non-linear Luttinger liquid theory. In the\nquasi-solid regime we observe a novel behavior at intermediate momenta, which\ncan be described by new analytical relations that we derive for the hard-rods\nmodel.\n", "  We present an analytical approach to evaluate the geometric measure of\nmultiparticle entanglement for mixed quantum states. Our method allows the\ncomputation of this measure for a family of multiparticle states with a certain\nsymmetry and delivers lower bounds on the measure for general states. It works\nfor an arbitrary number of particles, for arbitrary classes of multiparticle\nentanglement, and can also be used to determine other entanglement measures.\n", "  It is shown that a Weakly Interacting Massive dark matter Particle (WIMP)\ninterpretation for the positron excess observed in a variety of experiments,\nHEAT, PAMELA, and AMS-02, is highly constrained by the Fermi/LAT observations\nof dwarf galaxies. In particular, this paper has focused on the annihilation\nchannels that best fit the current AMS-02 data (Boudaud et al., 2014). The\nFermi satellite has surveyed the $\\gamma$-ray sky, and its observations of\ndwarf satellites are used to place strong bounds on the annihilation of WIMPs\ninto a variety of channels. For the single channel case, we find that dark\nmatter annihilation into {$b\\bar{b}$, $e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$,\n4-$e$, or 4-$\\tau$} is ruled out as an explanation of the AMS positron excess\n(here $b$ quarks are a proxy for all quarks, gauge and Higgs bosons). In\naddition, we find that the Fermi/LAT 2$\\sigma$ upper limits, assuming the\nbest-fit AMS-02 branching ratios, exclude multichannel combinations into\n$b\\bar{b}$ and leptons. The tension between the results might relax if the\nbranching ratios are allowed to deviate from their best-fit values, though a\nsubstantial change would be required. Of all the channels we considered, the\nonly viable channel that survives the Fermi/LAT constraint and produces a good\nfit to the AMS-02 data is annihilation (via a mediator) to 4-$\\mu$, or mainly\nto 4-$\\mu$ in the case of multichannel combinations.\n", "  With a combined analysis of data on $\\Upsilon(5S)\\rightarrow\nh_b(1P,2P)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)\\rightarrow B^{(\\ast)}\\bar\nB^{(\\ast)}\\pi$ in an effective field theory approach, we determine resonance\nparameters of $Z_b$ states in two scenarios. In one scenario we assume that\n$Z_b$ states are pure molecular states, while in the other one we assume that\n$Z_b$ states contain compact components. We find that the present data favor\nthat there should be some compact components inside $Z_b^{(\\prime)}$ associated\nwith the molecular components. By fitting the invariant mass spectra of\n$\\Upsilon(5S)\\rightarrow h_b(1P,2P)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)\\rightarrow\nB^{(\\ast)}\\bar B^{\\ast}\\pi$, we determine that the probability of finding the\ncompact components in $Z_b$ states may be as large as about $40\\%$.\n", "  Based on a more careful canonical analysis, we motivate a reduced\nquantization - in the sense of superspace quantization - of slightly\ninhomogeneous cosmology in place of the Dirac quantization in the existing\nliterature, and provide it in the vacuum case. This is attained through\nconsideration of configuration space geometries at various levels of reduction.\nSome of these have the good fortunate of being flat. Geometrically natural\ncoordinates for these are interpreted in terms of the original redundant\nformulation's well-known mode expansion coefficients.\n", "  A Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added PT-symmetric boundary term is studied\nin the framework of pseudo-hermitian quantum mechanics. For two special cases,\na complete set of pseudometrics is constructed in closed form. When\ncomplemented with a condition of positivity, the pseudometrics determine all\nthe physical inner products of the considered model.\n", "  A new Morawetz or integrated local energy decay estimate for Maxwell test\nfields on the exterior of a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is proved. The\nproof makes use of a new superenergy tensor $H_{ab}$ defined in terms of the\nMaxwell field and its first derivatives. The superenergy tensor, although not\nconserved, yields a conserved higher order energy current $H_{ab}\n(\\partial_t)^b$. The tensor $H_{ab}$ vanishes for the static Coulomb field, and\nthe Morawetz estimate proved here therefore yields integrated decay for the\nMaxwell field to the Coulomb solution on the Schwarzschild exterior.\n", "  We study the magnetic response of superconducting $\\gamma$-Ga via low\ntemperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The magnetic vortex\ncores rely substantially on the Ga geometry, and exhibit an unexpectedly-large\naxial elongation with aspect ratio up to 40 in rectangular Ga nano-strips\n(width $l$ $<$ 100 nm). This is in stark contrast with the isotropic circular\nvortex core in a larger round-shaped Ga island. We suggest that the unusual\nelongated vortices in Ga nanostrips originate from geometric confinement effect\nprobably via the strong repulsive interaction between the vortices and Meissner\nscreening currents at the sample edge. Our finding provides novel conceptual\ninsights into the geometrical confinement effect on magnetic vortices and forms\nthe basis for the technological applications of superconductors.\n", "  Layered non-centrosymmetric bismuth tellurohalides are being examined as\ncandidates for topological insulators. Pressure is believed to be essential for\ninducing and tuning topological order in these systems. Through electrical\ntransport and Raman scattering measurements, we find superconductivity in two\nhigh-pressure phases of BiTeCl with the different normal state features,\ncarrier characteristics, and upper critical field behaviors. Superconductivity\nemerges when the resistivity maximum or charge density wave is suppressed by\nthe applied pressure and then persists till the highest pressure of 51 GPa\nmeasured. The huge enhancement of the resistivity with three magnitude of\norders indicates the possible achievement of the topological order in the dense\ninsulating phase. These findings not only enrich the superconducting family\nfrom topological insulators but also pave the road on the search of topological\nsuperconductivity in bismuth tellurohalides.\n", "  A long-standing question is whether it is possible to delegate computational\ntasks securely. Recently, both a classical and a quantum solution to this\nproblem were found. Here, we study the interplay of classical and quantum\napproaches and show how coherence can be used as a tool for secure delegated\nclassical computation. We show that a client with limited computational\ncapacity - restricted to an XOR gate - can perform universal classical\ncomputation by manipulating information carriers that may occupy superpositions\nof two states. Using single photonic qubits or coherent light, we\nexperimentally implement secure delegated classical computations between an\nindependent client and a server. The server has access to the light sources and\nmeasurement devices, whereas the client may use only a restricted set of\npassive optical devices to manipulate the light beams. Thus, our work\nhighlights how minimal quantum and classical resources can be combined and\nexploited for classical computing.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of models of dark matter (DM) in a Universe\nwith a non-thermal cosmological history, i.e with a phase of pressure-less\nmatter domination before the onset of big-bang nucleosynethesis (BBN). Such\ncosmological histories are generically predicted by UV completions that contain\ngravitationally coupled scalar fields (moduli). We classify the different\nproduction mechanisms for DM in this framework, generalizing previous works by\nconsidering a wide range of DM masses/couplings and allowing for DM to be in\nequilibrium with a \"dark\" sector. We identify four distinct parametric regimes\nfor the production of relic DM, and derive accurate semi-analytic\napproximations for the DM relic abundance. Our results are particularly\nrelevant for supersymmetric theories, in which the standard non-thermally\nproduced DM candidates are disfavored by indirect detection constraints. We\nalso comment on experimental signals in this framework, focusing on novel\neffects involving the power spectrum of DM density perturbations. In\nparticular, we identify a class of models where the spectrum of DM density\nperturbations is sensitive to the pressure-less matter dominated era before\nBBN, giving rise to interesting astrophysical signatures to be looked for in\nthe future. A worthwhile future direction would be to study well-motivated\ntheoretical models within this framework and carry out detailed studies of the\npattern of expected experimental signals.\n", "  While thermoelectric transport theory is well established and widely applied,\nthere remains some degree of confusion on the proper thermodynamic definition\nof the Seebeck coefficient (or thermoelectric power) which is a measure of the\nstrength of the mutual interaction between electric charge transport and heat\ntransport. Indeed, as one considers a thermoelectric system, it is not always\nclear whether the Seebeck coefficient is to be related to the gradient of the\nsystem's chemical potential or to the gradient of its electrochemical\npotential. This pedagogical article aims to shed light on this confusion and\nclarify the thermodynamic definition of the thermoelectric coupling. First, we\nrecall how the Seebeck coefficient is experimentally determined. We then turn\nto the analysis of the relationship between the thermoelectric power and the\nrelevant potentials in the thermoelectric system: As the definitions of the\nchemical and electrochemical potentials are clarified, we show that, with a\nproper consideration of each potential, one may derive the Seebeck coefficient\nof a non-degenerate semiconductor without the need to introduce a contact\npotential as seen sometimes in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthe phenomenological expression of the electrical current resulting from\nthermoelectric effects may be directly obtained from the drift-diffusion\nequation.\n", "  Elucidating the microscopic origin of nematic order in iron-based\nsuperconducting materials is important because the interactions that drive\nnematic order may also mediate the Cooper pairing. Nematic order breaks\nfourfold rotational symmetry in the iron plane, which is believed to be driven\nby either orbital or spin degrees of freedom. However, as the nematic phase\noften develops at a temperature just above or coincides with a stripe magnetic\nphase transition, experimentally determining the dominant driving force of\nnematic order is difficult. Here, we use neutron scattering to study\nstructurally the simplest iron-based superconductor FeSe, which displays a\nnematic (orthorhombic) phase transition at $T_s=90$ K, but does not order\nantiferromagnetically. Our data reveal substantial stripe spin fluctuations,\nwhich are coupled with orthorhombicity and are enhanced abruptly on cooling to\nbelow $T_s$. Moreover, a sharp spin resonance develops in the superconducting\nstate, whose energy (~4 meV) is consistent with an electron boson coupling mode\nrevealed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, thereby suggesting a spin\nfluctuation-mediated sign-changing pairing symmetry. By normalizing the dynamic\nsusceptibility into absolute units, we show that the magnetic spectral weight\nin FeSe is comparable to that of the iron arsenides. Our findings support\nrecent theoretical proposals that both nematicity and superconductivity are\ndriven by spin fluctuations.\n", "  The Stokes and anti-Stokes components in the inelastic scattering of light\nare related to phonon statistics and have been broadly used to measure\ntemperature and phonon lifetimes in different materials. However, correlation\nbetween the components are expected to change the Stokes/anti-Stokes intensity\nratio, imposing corrections to the broadly used Bose-Einstein statistics. Here\nthe excitation power dependence of these scattering processes is theoretically\ndescribed by an effective Hamiltonian that includes correlation between the\nStokes and the anti-Stokes events. The model is used to fit available\nexperimental results in three-dimensional diamond and two-dimensional graphene,\nshowing that the phenomenon can significantly increase in the low-dimensional\nsystem under specific resonance conditions. By setting the scientific basis for\nthe Stokes-anti-Stokes correlated phenomenon, the use of the Bose-Einstein\npopulation function for reasoning the inelastic scattering is generalized,\nproviding a model to predict the conversion of optical phonons into heat or\nlight, according to coupling constants and decay rates. The model applies to\ninelastic scattering in general.\n", "  We analyze the low-redshift (z~0.2) circumgalactic medium by comparing\nabsorption-line data from the COS-Halos Survey to absorption around a matched\ngalaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The models\ninclude different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybrid\nenergy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). We extract for\ncomparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors,\nion ratios, and kinematics. Both wind models are generally in good agreement\nwith these observations for HI and certain low ionization metal lines, but show\npoorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including SiIII and OVI\nthat are well-observed by COS-Halos. These discrepancies suggest that both wind\nmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or\nthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model\nassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. Our ezw simulation\nincludes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heating\nits ISM gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to be\nbroadly consistent with observations, but also substantial OVI absorption that\nis inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in the\nreal Universe does not cool. At impact parameters of <50 kpc, recycling winds\ndominate the absorption of low ions and even HI, while OVI almost always arises\nfrom metals ejected longer than 1 Gyr ago. The similarity between the wind\nmodels is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in their\npredicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. We show that this\nsimilarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather than\nat fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that CGM properties\nare more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.\n", "  It is possible to define an analogue of the Riemann tensor for $N$th order\nLovelock gravity, its characterizing property being that the trace of its\nBianchi derivative yields the corresponding analogue of the Einstein tensor.\nInterestingly there exist two parallel but distinct such analogues and the main\npurpose of this note is to reconcile both these formulations. In addition we\nwill show that any pure Lovelock vacuum in odd $d = 2N + 1$ dimensions is\nLovelock flat, i.e. any vacuum solution of the theory has vanishing\nLovelock-Riemann tensor. Further, in presence of cosmological constant it is\nthe Lovelock-Weyl tensor that vanishes.\n", "  The classical theory of Brownian dynamics follows from coarse-graining the\nunderlying linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics of the solvent. We extend this\nprocedure to globally non-isothermal conditions, requiring only a local thermal\nequilibration of the solvent. Starting from the conservation laws, we establish\nthe stochastic equations of motion for the fluid momentum fluctuations in the\npresence of a suspended Brownian particle. These are then contracted to the\nnon-isothermal generalized Langevin description of the suspended particle\nalone, for which the coupling to stochastic temperature fluctuations is found\nto be negligible under typical experimental conditions.\n", "  We present the first experimental realization of an $S=2$\nferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (F-AF) alternating chain in a new Mn-verdazyl\ncomplex [Mn(hfac)$_2$]$\\cdot$($o$-Py-V)\n[hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonate;\n$o$-Py-V=3-(2-pyridyl)-1,5-diphenylverdazyl]. Through the $ab$ $initio$\nmolecular orbital calculation, magnetization, and ESR measurements, this\ncompound is confirmed to form an $S=2$ F-AF alternating chain with Ising\nanisotropy below about 100 K. Furthermore, we find an anomalous change in\nmagnetization at 1/4 of the saturation value, which is probably a manifestation\nof the quantum nature of the system.\n", "  Following on from the increasing interest for electromagnetic waves carrying\nOrbital Angular Momentum (OAM), different configurations of antenna systems\nable to generate such beams have been proposed. However, in our opinion, a\ntraditional radiation pattern approach does not provide the right picture of an\nOAM-based communication link. For this reason we propose a new general concept,\nthe \"OAM-link pattern\", which takes into account the peculiar phase structure\ncharacterizing these waves. Focusing on OAM transmissions between antenna\narrays, we introduce a formula for the link budget evaluation which describes\nthe whole communication link and directly leads to a \"classically shaped\" main\nlobe pattern for a proper rephased reception in the case of uniform circular\narrays.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate a counter-intuitive phenomenon in optical\ninterferometry with a thermal source: the emergence of second-order\ninterference between two pairs of correlated optical paths even if the time\ndelay imprinted by each path in one pair with respect to each path in the other\npair is much larger than the source coherence time. This fundamental effect\ncould be useful for experimental simulations of small-scale quantum circuits\nand of $100\\%$-visibility correlations typical of entangled states of a large\nnumber of qubits, with possible applications in high-precision metrology and\nimaging. As an example, we demonstrate the polarization-encoded simulation of\nthe operation of the quantum logic gate known as controlled-NOT gate.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phases of monodispersed bosonic gases confined to\na triangular lattice and interacting via a class of soft-shoulder potentials.\nThe latter correspond to soft-core potentials with an additional hard-core\nonsite interaction. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that\nthe low temperature phases for weak and strong interactions following a\ntemperature quench are a homogeneous superfluid and a glass, respectively. The\nlatter is an insulating phase characterized by inhomogeneity in the density\ndistribution and structural disorder. Remarkably, we find that for intermediate\ninteraction strengths a {\\it superglass} occurs in an extended region of the\nphase diagram, where glassy behavior coexists with a sizable finite superfluid\nfraction. This glass phase is obtained in the absence of geometrical\nfrustration or external disorder and is a result of the competition of quantum\nfluctuations and cluster formation in the corresponding classical ground state.\nFor high enough temperature, the glass and superglass turn into a floating\nstripe solid and a supersolid, respectively. Given the simplicity and\ngenerality of the model, these phases should be directly relevant for\nstate-of-the-art experiments with Rydberg-dressed atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  We study the behavior of exciton polaritons in an optical microcavity with an\nembedded semiconductor quantum well. We use two-component exciton-photon\napproach formulated in terms of path integral formalism. In order to describe\nspatial distributions of the exciton and photon condensate densities, the two\ncoupled equations of the Gross-Pitaevskii type are derived. For a homogeneous\nsystem, we find the noncondensate photon and exciton spectra, calculate the\ncoefficients of transformation from the exciton-photon basis to the lower-upper\npolariton basis, and obtain the exciton and photon occupation numbers of the\nlower and upper polariton branches for nonzero temperatures. For an\ninhomogeneous system, the set of coupled equations of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes\ntype is derived. The equations govern the spectra and spatial distributions of\nnoncondensate photons and excitons.\n", "  Filamentation of linear polarized ultrashort laser pulses in non-axisymmetric\noptical schemes with preferential directions to the optical axis in dependence\non the beam orientation was experimentally studied. Our experiments\ndemonstrated strong influence of a laser beam orientation on self-focusing of\nthe beam and plasma generation during filamentation. Maximum of linear plasma\ndensity generated by an astigmatic laser pulse was different in both meridional\nand sagittal foci and depended on the beam orientation. A difference of linear\nplasma density was observed in the case of superposition of two parts of the\nlaser beam going through a two-hole diaphragm depending on the beam orientation\nand through a slit for collinear and normal slit orientation relative to the\nbeam orientation. Laser pulses in IR and UV wavelength domains led to similar\nresult.\n", "  We formulate the large deviations for a class of two scale chemical kinetic\nprocesses motivated from biological applications. The result is successfully\napplied to treat a genetic switching model with positive feedbacks. The\ncorresponding Hamiltonian is convex with respect to the momentum variable as a\nby-product of the large deviation theory. This property ensures its superiority\nin the rare event simulations compared with the result obtained by formal WKB\nasymptotics. The result is of general interest to understand the large\ndeviations for multiscale problems.\n", "  The Higgs field in the standard model (SM) may couple to new physics sectors\nrelated with dark matter and/or massive neutrinos. In this paper we propose a\nnovel signature, the boosted di-Higgs boson plus \\ET (which is either a dark\nmatter or neutrino), to probe those new physics sectors. In a large class of\nmodels, in particular the supersymmetric SMs and low scale seesaw mechanisms,\nthis signature can play a key role. The signature has clear background, and at\nthe $\\sqrt s=$14 TeV high luminosity (HL-)LHC, we can probe it with production\nrate as low as $\\sim$ 0.1 fb. We apply it to benchmark models, supersymmetry in\nthe bino-Higgsino limit, the canonical seesaw model and little Higgs model,\nfinding that masses of Higgsino, right-handed neutrino and heavy vector boson\ncan be probed up to $\\sim$ 500 GeV, 650 GeV and 900 GeV, respectively.\n", "  The emergence and popularization of online social networks suddenly made\navailable a large amount of data from social organization, interaction and\nhuman behavior. All this information opens new perspectives and challenges to\nthe study of social systems, being of interest to many fields. Although most\nonline social networks are recent (less than fifteen years old), a vast amount\nof scientific papers was already published on this topic, dealing with a broad\nrange of analytical methods and applications. This work describes how\ncomputational researches have approached this subject and the methods used to\nanalyze such systems. Founded on a wide though non-exaustive review of the\nliterature, a taxonomy is proposed to classify and describe different\ncategories of research. Each research category is described and the main works,\ndiscoveries and perspectives are highlighted.\n", "  We investigate QCD at large mu/T by using Z_3-symmetric SU(3) gauge theory,\nwhere mu is the quark-number chemical potential and T is temperature. We impose\nthe flavor-dependent twist boundary condition on quarks in QCD. This QCD-like\ntheory has the twist angle theta as a parameter, and agrees with QCD when\ntheta=0 and becomes symmetric when theta=2\\pi/3. For both QCD and the\nZ_3-symmetric SU(3) gauge theory, the phase diagram is drawn in mu--T plane\nwith the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. In the Z_3-symmetric\nSU(3) gauge theory, the Polyakov loop varphi is zero in the confined phase\nappearing at T \\lsim 200 MeV. The perfectly confined phase never coexists with\nthe color superconducting (CSC) phase, since finite diquark condensate in the\nCSC phase breaks Z_3 symmetry and then makes varphi finite. When mu \\gsim 300\nMeV, the CSC phase is more stable than the perfectly confined phase at T \\lsim\n100 MeV. Meanwhile, the chiral symmetry can be broken in the perfectly confined\nphase, since the chiral condensate is Z_3 invariant. Consequently, the\nperfectly confined phase is divided into the perfectly confined phase without\nchiral symmetry restoration in a region of mu \\lsim 300 MeV and T \\lsim 200 MeV\nand the perfectly confined phase with chiral symmetry restoration in a region\nof \\mu \\gsim 300 MeV and 100 \\lsim T \\lsim 200 MeV. The basic phase structure\nof Z_3-symmetric QCD-like theory remains in QCD. We show that in the perfectly\nconfined phase the sign problem becomes less serious because of \\varphi=0,\nusing the heavy quark theory. We discuss a lattice QCD framework to evaluate\nobservables at \\theta=0 from those at \\theta=2\\pi/3.\n", "  The aim of this work is to verify the new entropic and information\ninequalities for non-composite systems using experimental $5 \\times 5$ density\nmatrix of the qudit state, measured by the tomographic method in a multi-level\nsuperconducting circuit. These inequalities are well-known for bipartite and\ntripartite systems, but have never been tested for superconducting qudits.\nEntropic inequalities can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of experimental\ndata and the value of mutual information, deduced from them, may charachterize\ncorrelations between different degrees of freedom in a noncomposite system.\n", "  When we extract information from a system by performing a quantum\nmeasurement, the state of the system is disturbed due to the backaction of the\nmeasurement. Numerous studies have been performed to quantitatively formulate\ntradeoff relations between information and disturbance. We formulate a tradeoff\nrelation between information and disturbance from an estimation-theoretic point\nof view, and derive an inequality between them. The information is defined as\nthe classical Fisher information obtained by the measurement, and the\ndisturbance is defined as the average loss of the quantum Fisher information.\nWe show that pure and reversible measurements achieve the equality of the\ninequality. We also identify the necessary condition for various divergences\nbetween two quantum states to satisfy a similar relation. The obtained relation\nholds not only for the quantum relative entropy but also for the maximum\nquantum relative entropy.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the holographic cosmology using a M2-M5 brane\nconfiguration. In this configuration, a M2-brane will be placed in between a\nM5-brane and an anti-M5-brane. The M2-brane will act as a channel for energy to\nflow from an anti-M5-brane to a M5-brane, and this will increase the degrees of\nfreedom on the M5-brane causing inflation. The inflation will end when the\nM5-brane and anti-M5-brane get separated. However, at a later stage the\ndistance between the M5-brane and the anti-M5-bran can reduce and this will\ncause the formation of tachyonic states. These tachyonic states will be again\nopen a bridge between the M5-branes and the anti-M5-branes, which will cause\nfurther acceleration of the universe.\n", "  In an SU(N) gauge field theory, the n-point Green functions, namely,\npropagators and vertices, transform under the simultaneous local gauge\nvariations of the gluon vector potential and the quark matter field in such a\nmanner that the physical observables remain invariant. In this article, we\nderive this intrinsically non perturbative transformation law for the quark\npropagator within the system of covariant gauges. We carry out its explicit\nperturbative expansion till O(g_s^6) and, for some terms, till O(g_s^8). We\nstudy the implications of this transformation for the quark-anti-quark\ncondensate, multiplicative renormalizability of the massless quark propagator,\nas well as its relation with the quark-gluon vertex at the one-loop order.\nSetting the color factors C_F=1 and C_A=0, Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin\ntransformation for the abelian case of quantum electrodynamics is trivially\nrecovered.\n", "  We study the fluctuations of the interface, in the steady state, of the\nSurface Relaxation Model (SRM) in two scale free interacting networks where a\nfraction $q$ of nodes in both networks interact one to one through external\nconnections. We find that as $q$ increases the fluctuations on both networks\ndecrease and thus the synchronization reaches an improvement of nearly $40\\%$\nwhen $q=1$. The decrease of the fluctuations on both networks is due mainly to\nthe diffusion through external connections which allows to reducing the load in\nnodes by sending their excess mostly to low-degree nodes, which we report have\nthe lowest heights. This effect enhances the matching of the heights of low-and\nhigh-degree nodes as $q$ increases reducing the fluctuations. This effect is\nalmost independent of the degree distribution of the networks which means that\nthe interconnection governs the behavior of the process over its topology.\n", "  Thus far, there does not appear to be an agreed (or adequate) definition of\nhomogeneous dark energy (DE). This paper seeks to define a valid, adequate\nhomogeneity condition for DE. Firstly, it is shown that as long as $w_x \\neq\n-1$, DE must have perturbations. It is then argued, independent of $w_x$, that\na correct definition of homogeneous DE is one whose density perturbation\nvanishes in comoving gauge: and hence, in the DE rest frame. Using\nphenomenological DE, the consequence of this approach is then investigated in\nthe observed galaxy power spectrum - with the power spectrum being normalized\non small scales, at the present epoch z = 0. It is found that for high\nmagnification bias, relativistic corrections in the galaxy power spectrum are\nable to distinguish the concordance model from both a homogeneous DE and a\nclustering DE - on super-horizon scales.\n", "  We study possible quantum $U(1)$ spin liquids in three dimensions with\ntime-reversal symmetry. We find a total of 7 families of such $U(1)$ spin\nliquids, distinguished by the properties of their emergent electric/magnetic\ncharges. We show how these spin liquids are related to each other. Two of these\nclasses admit nontrivial protected surface states which we describe. We show\nhow to access all of the 7 spin liquids through slave particle (parton)\nconstructions. We also provide intuitive loop gas descriptions of their ground\nstate wave functions. One of these phases is the `topological Mott insulator'\nconventionally described as a topological insulator of an emergent fermionic\n`spinon'. We show that this phase admits a remarkable dual description as a\ntopological insulator of emergent fermionic magnetic monopoles. This results in\na new (possibly natural) surface phase for the topological Mott insulator and a\nnew slave particle construction. We describe some of the continuous quantum\nphase transitions between the different $U(1)$ spin liquids. Each of these\nseven families of states admits a finer distinction in terms of their surface\nproperties which we determine by combining these spin liquids with symmetry\nprotected topological phases. We discuss lessons for materials such as\npyrochlore quantum spin ices which may harbor a $U(1)$ spin liquid. We suggest\nthe topological Mott insulator as a possible ground state in some range of\nparameters for the quantum spin ice Hamiltonian.\n", "  The control of non-equilibrium phenomena in complex solids is an important\nresearch frontier, encompassing new effects like light induced\nsuperconductivity. Here, we show that coherent optical excitation of molecular\nvibrations in the organic conductor K3C60 can induce a non-equilibrium state\nwith the optical properties of a superconductor. A transient gap in the real\npart of the optical conductivity and a low-frequency divergence of the\nimaginary part are measured for base temperatures far above equilibrium Tc=20\nK. These findings underscore the role of coherent light fields in inducing\nemergent order.\n", "  We discuss the potential impacts on the CMSSM of future LHC runs and possible\nelectron-positron and higher-energy proton-proton colliders, considering\nsearches for supersymmetry via MET events, precision electroweak physics, Higgs\nmeasurements and dark matter searches. We validate and present estimates of the\nphysics reach for exclusion or discovery of supersymmetry via MET searches at\nthe LHC, which should cover the low-mass regions of the CMSSM parameter space\nfavoured in a recent global analysis. As we illustrate with a low-mass\nbenchmark point, a discovery would make possible accurate LHC measurements of\nsparticle masses using the MT2 variable, which could be combined with\ncross-section and other measurements to constrain the gluino, squark and stop\nmasses and hence the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters m_0, m_{1/2} and\nA_0 of the CMSSM. Slepton measurements at CLIC would enable m_0 and m_{1/2} to\nbe determined with high precision. If supersymmetry is indeed discovered in the\nlow-mass region, precision electroweak and Higgs measurements with a future\ncircular electron-positron collider (FCC-ee, also known as TLEP) combined with\nLHC measurements would provide tests of the CMSSM at the loop level. If\nsupersymmetry is not discovered at the LHC, is likely to lie somewhere along a\nfocus-point, stop coannihilation strip or direct-channel A/H resonance funnel.\nWe discuss the prospects for discovering supersymmetry along these strips at a\nfuture circular proton-proton collider such as FCC-hh. Illustrative benchmark\npoints on these strips indicate that also in this case FCC-ee could provide\ntests of the CMSSM at the loop level.\n", "  We introduce a mean-field and perturbative approach, based on clusters, to\ndescribe the ground state of fermionic strongly-correlated systems. In cluster\nmean-field, the ground state wavefunction is written as a simple tensor product\nover optimized cluster states. The optimization of the single-particle basis\nwhere the cluster mean-field is expressed is crucial in order to obtain\nhigh-quality results. The mean-field nature of the ansatz allows us to\nformulate a perturbative approach to account for inter-cluster correlations;\nother traditional many-body strategies can be easily devised in terms of the\ncluster states. We present benchmark calculations on the half-filled 1D and\n(square) 2D Hubbard model, as well as the lightly-doped regime in 2D, using\ncluster mean-field and second-order perturbation theory. Our results indicate\nthat, with sufficiently large clusters or to second-order in perturbation\ntheory, a cluster-based approach can provide an accurate description of the\nHubbard model in the considered regimes. Several avenues to improve upon the\nresults presented in this work are discussed.\n", "  Here we revisit line identifications of type I supernovae and highlight trace\namounts of unburned hydrogen as an important free parameter for the composition\nof the progenitor. Most 1-dimensional stripped-envelope models of supernovae\nindicate that observed features near 6000-6400 Ang in type I spectra are due to\nmore than Si II 6355. However, while an interpretation of conspicuous Si II\n6355 can approximate 6150 Ang absorption features for all type Ia supernovae\nduring the first month of free expansion, similar identifications applied to\n6250 Ang features of type Ib and Ic supernovae have not been as successful.\nWhen the corresponding synthetic spectra are compared to high quality\ntime-series observations, the computed spectra are frequently too blue in\nwavelength. Some improvement can be achieved with Fe II lines that contribute\nred-ward of 6150 Ang, however the computed spectra either remain too blue, or\nthe spectrum only reaches fair agreement when the rise-time to peak brightness\nof the model conflicts with observations by a factor of two. This degree of\ndisagreement brings into question the proposed explosion scenario. Similarly, a\ndetection of strong Si II 6355 in the spectra of broad-lined Ic and\nsuper-luminous events of type I/R is less convincing despite numerous model\nspectra used to show otherwise. Alternatively, we suggest 6000-6400 Ang\nfeatures are possibly influenced by either trace amounts of hydrogen, or\nblue-shifted absorption and emission in Halpha, the latter being an effect\nwhich is frequently observed in the spectra of hydrogen-rich, type II\nsupernovae.\n", "  We study pure Lovelock vacuum and perfect fluid equations for Kasner-type\nmetrics. These equations correspond to a single $N$th order Lovelock term in\nthe action in $d=2N+1,\\,2N+2$ dimensions, and they capture the relevant\ngravitational dynamics when aproaching the big-bang singularity within the\nLovelock family of theories. Pure Lovelock gravity also bears out the general\nfeature that vacuum in the critical odd dimension, $d=2N+1$, is kinematic; i.e.\nwe may define an analogue Lovelock-Riemann tensor that vanishes in vacuum for\n$d=2N+1$, yet the Riemann curvature is non-zero. We completely classify\nisotropic and vacuum Kasner metrics for this class of theories in several\nisotropy types. The different families can be characterized by means of certain\nhigher order 4th rank tensors. We also analyze in detail the space of vacuum\nsolutions for five and six dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet theory. It possesses\nan interesting and illuminating geometric structure and symmetries that carry\nover to the general case. We also comment on a closely related family of\nexponential solutions and on the possibility of solutions with complex Kasner\nexponents. We show that the latter imply the existence of closed timelike\ncurves in the geometry.\n", "  The Compton wavelength gives the minimum radius within which the mass of a\nparticle may be localized due to quantum effects, while the Schwarzschild\nradius gives the maximum radius within which the mass of a black hole may be\nlocalized due to classial gravity. In a mass-radius diagram, the two lines\nintersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects\nbecome significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is\nbased on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie\nrelations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$. It is unclear\nwhat physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $E\n\\gg m_Pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\\lambda \\ll l_P$ or time\nperiods $T \\ll t_P$ in the standard theory. We therefore propose a correction\nto the standard de Broglie relations, which gives rise to a modified Schr{\\\"\no}dinger equation and a modified expression for the Compton wavelength, which\nmay be extended into the region $E \\gg m_Pc^2$. For the proposed modification,\nwe recover the expression for the Schwarzschild radius for $E \\gg m_Pc^2$ and\nthe usual Compton formula for $E \\ll m_Pc^2$. The sign of the inequality\nobtained from the uncertainty principle reverses at $m \\approx m_P$, so that\nthe Compton wavelength and event horizon size may be interpreted as minimum and\nmaximum radii, respectively. We interpret the additional terms in the modified\nde Broglie relations as representing the self-gravitation of the wave packet.\n", "  Context. The elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 is known to be surrounded by a number\nof stellar shells, probable remnants of an accreted galaxy. Despite its\nuniqueness, the deepest images of its outskirts come from the 1980s. On the\nbasis of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), it has recently been predicted\nthat a new shell lies in this region.\n  Aims. We obtain the deepest image ever of the galaxy, map the tidal features\nin it, and search for the predicted shell.\n  Methods. The image of the galaxy was taken by the MegaCam camera at the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the g' band. It reached the\nsurface-brightness limit of 29 mag/arcsec2. In addition, we reanalyzed an\narchival HST image of the galaxy.\n  Results. We detected up to 42 shells in NGC 3923. This is by far the highest\nnumber among all shell galaxies. We present the description of the shells and\nother tidal features in the galaxy. A probable progenitor of some of these\nfeatures was discovered. The shell system likely originates from two or more\nprogenitors. The predicted shell was not detected, but the new image revealed\nthat the prediction was based on incorrect assumptions and poor data.\n", "  We report comprehensive studies of the crystallographic,magnetic, and thermal\nproperties of a spinel-type magnetically frustrated compound, CoAl2O4, and a\nmagnetically diluted system,Co1-xZnxAl2O4. These studies revealed the effects\nof dilution and disorder when the tetrahedral magnetic Co ion was replaced by\nthe nonmagnetic Zn ion. Low-temperature anomalies were observed in magnetic\nsusceptibility at x < 0.6. A multicritical point was apparent at T = 3.4 K and\nx = 0.12, where the antiferromagnetic, spin glass-like, and paramagnetic phases\nmet. At that point, the quenched ferromagnetic component induced by a magnetic\nfield during cooling was sharply enhanced and was observable below x = 0.6.\nAround x = 0.6, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat were described by\ntemperature power laws, chi ~ C/T ~ T-d, in accord with the site percolation\nthreshold of the diamond lattice. This behavior is reminiscent of a quantum\ncritical singularity. We propose an x-temperature phase diagram in the range 0\n< x < 1 for Co1-xZnxAl2O4. The transition temperature of CoAl2O4 determined\nfrom magnetic susceptibility measured under hydrostatic pressure increased with\nincreasing pressure.\n", "  Recent years have seen increased theoretical and experimental effort towards\nthe first-ever detection of cosmic-ray antideuterons, in particular as an\nindirect signature of dark matter annihilation or decay. In contrast to\nindirect dark matter searches using positrons, antiprotons, or gamma-rays,\nwhich suffer from relatively high and uncertain astrophysical backgrounds,\nsearches with antideuterons benefit from very suppressed conventional\nbackgrounds, offering a potential breakthrough in unexplored phase space for\ndark matter. This article is based on the first dedicated cosmic-ray\nantideuteron workshop, which was held at UCLA in June 2014. It reviews broad\nclasses of dark matter candidates that result in detectable cosmic-ray\nantideuteron fluxes, as well as the status and prospects of current\nexperimental searches. The coalescence model of antideuteron production and the\ninfluence of antideuteron measurements at particle colliders are discussed.\nThis is followed by a review of the modeling of antideuteron propagation\nthrough the magnetic fields, plasma currents, and molecular material of our\nGalaxy, the solar system, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the atmosphere.\nFinally, the three ongoing or planned experiments that are sensitive to\ncosmic-ray antideuterons, BESS, AMS-02, and GAPS, are detailed. As cosmic-ray\nantideuteron detection is a rare event search, multiple experiments with\northogonal techniques and backgrounds are essential. Many theoretical and\nexperimental groups have contributed to these studies over the last decade,\nthis review aims to provide the first coherent discussion of the relevant dark\nmatter theories that antideuterons probe, the challenges to predictions and\ninterpretations of antideuteron signals, and the experimental efforts toward\ncosmic antideuteron detection.\n", "  We investigate the influence that adding a new coupling has on the linear\nstability of the synchronous state in coupled oscillators networks. Using a\nsimple model we show that, depending on its location, the new coupling can lead\nto enhanced or reduced stability. We extend these results to electric power\ngrids where a new line can lead to four different scenarios corresponding to\nenhanced or reduced grid stability as well as increased or decreased power\nflows. Our analysis shows that the Braess paradox may occur in any complex\ncoupled system, where the synchronous state may be weakened and sometimes even\ndestroyed by additional couplings.\n", "  We improve a previous result about the local energy decay for the damped wave\nequation on R^d. The problem is governed by a Laplacian associated with a long\nrange perturbation of the flat metric and a short range absorption index. Our\npurpose is to recover the decay O(t^{--d+$\\epsilon$}) in the weighted energy\nspaces. The proof is based on uniform resolvent estimates, given by an improved\nversion of the dissipative Mourre theory. In particular we have to prove the\nlimiting absorption principle for the powers of the resolvent with inserted\nweights.\n", "  Non-centrosymmetric transition metal monopnictides, including TaAs, TaP,\nNbAs, and NbP, are emergent topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) hosting exotic\nrelativistic Weyl fermions. In this letter, we elucidate the physical origin of\nthe unprecedented charge carrier mobility of NbP, which can reach\n$1\\times10^{7}$ cm $^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 1.5 K. Angle- and\ntemperature-dependent quantum oscillations, supported by density function\ntheory calculations, reveal that NbP has the coexistence of p- and n-type WSM\npockets in the $k_{z}$=1.16$\\pi$/c plane (W1-WSM) and in the $k_{z}$=0 plane\nnear the high symmetry points $\\Sigma$ (W2-WSM), respectively. Uniquely, each\nW2-WSM pocket forms a large dumbbell-shaped Fermi surface (FS) enclosing two\nneighboring Weyl nodes with the opposite chirality. The magneto-transport in\nNbP is dominated by these highly anisotropic W2-WSM pockets, in which Weyl\nfermions are well protected from defect backscattering by real spin\nconservation associated to the chiral nodes. However, with a minimal doping of\n$\\sim$1\\% Cr, the mobility of NbP is degraded by more than two order of\nmagnitude, due to the invalid of helicity protection to magnetic impurities.\nHelicity protected Weyl fermion transport is also manifested in chiral anomaly\ninduced negative magnetoresistance, controlled by the W1-WSM states. In the\nquantum regime below 10 K, the intervalley scattering time by impurities\nbecomes a large constant, producing the sharp and nearly identical conductivity\nenhancement at low magnetic field.\n", "  Image smear, produced by the shutter-less operation of frame transfer CCD\ndetectors, can be detrimental for many imaging applications. Existing\nalgorithms used to numerically remove smear, do not contemplate cases where\nintensity levels change considerably between consecutive frame exposures. In\nthis report we reformulate the smearing model to include specific variations of\nthe sensor illumination. The corresponding desmearing expression and its noise\nproperties are also presented and demonstrated in the context of fast imaging\npolarimetry.\n", "  The vacuum of the Standard Model is known to be unstable for the measured\nvalues of the top and Higgs masses. Here we show how vacuum stability can be\nachieved naturally if lepton number is violated spontaneously at the TeV scale.\nMore precise Higgs measurements in the next LHC run should provide a crucial\ntest of our symmetry breaking scenario. In addition, these schemes typically\nlead to enhanced rates for processes involving lepton flavour violation .\n", "  In this paper we consider the $\\alpha-$attractor model and study inflation\nunder a non-slow-roll dynamics. More precisely, we follow the approach recently\nproposed by Gong and Sasaki \\cite{Gong:2015ypa} by means of assuming\n$N=N\\left(\\phi\\right)$. Within this framework we obtain a family of functions\ndescribing the local shape of the potential during inflation. We study a\nspecific model and find an inflationary scenario predicting an attractor at\n$n_{s}\\approx0.967$ and $r\\approx5.5\\times10^{-4}$. We further show that\nconsidering a non-slow-roll dynamics, the $\\alpha-$attractor model can be\nbroaden to a wider class of models that remain compatible with value of\n$r<0.1$. We further explore the model parameter space with respect to large and\nsmall field inflation and conclude that the inflaton dynamics is connected to\nthe $ \\alpha- $ parameter, which is also related to the K\\\"ahler manifold\ncurvature in the supergravity (SUGRA) embedding of this model. We also comment\non the stabilization of the inflaton's trajectory.\n", "  The tools of weakly coupled phase oscillator theory have had a profound\nimpact on the neuroscience community, providing insight into a variety of\nnetwork behaviours ranging from central pattern generation to synchronisation,\nas well as predicting novel network states such as chimeras. However, there are\nmany instances when this theory is expected to break down, say in the presence\nof strong coupling, or must be carefully interpreted, as in the presence of\nstochastic forcing. There are also surprises in the dynamical complexity of the\nattractors that can robustly appear - for example, heteroclinic network\nattractors. In this review we present a set of mathematical tools that are\nsuitable for addressing the dynamics of oscillatory neural networks, broadening\nfrom a standard phase oscillator perspective to provide a practical framework\nfor further successful applications of mathematics to understanding network\ndynamics in neuroscience.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of probing the CP-violating $h\\bar{t}t$\ncoupling in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow h \\gamma$ at the future high\nluminosity $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders. Our numerical results show that the cross\nsection for this process can be significantly increased for the allowed CP\nphase $\\xi$ and center of mass energy. For example the cross section is about 6\ntimes of that in the standard model (SM) for $\\sqrt{s}=350~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and\n$\\xi =3\\pi/5$ (see text for $\\xi$ definition). The simulation for the signal\nprocess $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow h \\gamma \\rightarrow b \\bar{b}\\gamma$ and its\nbackgrounds shows that the signal significance can reach more than $4.8\\sigma$\nand $2.3\\sigma$ for $\\sqrt{s}=350~\\mathrm{GeV},\\ 500~\\mathrm{GeV}$\nrespectively, with the integrated luminosity $\\mathcal{L}=3~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ and\n$\\xi\\in[\\pi/2,3\\pi/5]$. For $\\mathcal{L}=10~\\text{ab}^{-1}$, the signal\nsignificance can be greater than 5 for $\\sqrt{s}=350~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and 3.9 for\n$\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$ with the CP phase $\\xi\\in[\\pi/2,3\\pi/5]$. Besides\nthe cross section enhancement, the CP-violating $h\\bar{t}t$ coupling will\ninduce the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ which is absent in the SM and is\na clear signal of new CP violation. Compared with the $A_{FB}$ in the Higgs\ndecay $h\\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}\\gamma$, the $A_{FB}$ can be greatly enhanced in\nthe production process. For example $A_{FB}$ can reach 0.5 for $\\cos\\xi\\simeq\n0.7$ and $\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$. Due to the large backgrounds, the\nsignificance of the expected $A_{FB}$ can only be observed at $1.7\\sigma$ with\n$\\mathcal{L}=10~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ and $\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$. It is\nessential to trigger the single photon in the final state to separate the\nbottom jets arising from scalar or vector bosons, in order to isolate the\nsignal from the backgrounds more efficiently.\n", "  We consider a bipartite quantum object, composed of a quantum system and a\nquantum actuator which is periodically reset. We show that the reduced dynamics\nof the system approaches unitarity as the reset frequency of the actuator is\nincreased. This phenomenon arises because quantum systems interacting for a\nshort time can impact each other faster than they can become significantly\nentangled. In the high reset-frequency limit, the effective Hamiltonian\ndescribing the system's unitary evolution depends on the state to which the\nactuator is reset. This makes it possible to indirectly implement a continuous\nfamily of effective Hamiltonians on one part of a bipartite quantum object,\nthereby reducing the problem of indirect control (via a quantum actuator) to\nthe well-studied one of direct quantum control.\n", "  In this Letter we describe a novel class of dynamical excitations --\naccelerating oscillatory fronts in a new genre of nonlinear sonic vacua with\nstrongly non-local effects. Indeed, it is surprising that such models naturally\narise in dynamics of common and popular lattices. In this study, we address a\nchain of particles oscillating in the plane and coupled by linear springs, with\nfixed ends. When one end of this system is harmonically excited in the\ntransverse direction, one observes accelerated propagation of the excitation\nfront, accompanied by an almost monochromatic oscillatory tail. The front\npropagation obeys the scaling law $l \\sim t^{4/3}$. The frequency of the\noscillatory tail remains constant, and the wavelength scales as $\\lambda \\sim\nt^{1/3}$. These scaling laws result from the nonlocal effects; we derive them\nanalytically (including the scaling coefficients) from a continuum\napproximation. Moreover, a certain threshold excitation amplitude is required\nin order to initiate the front propagation. The initiation threshold is\nrationalized on the basis of a simplified discrete model. This model is further\nreduced to a new completely integrable nonlinear system. The Letter introduces\na new and yet unexplored class of nonlinear sonic vacua and explores the\neffects of strong non-locality on the initiation and propagation of oscillating\nfronts in these media. Given their simplicity, nonlinear sonic vacua of the\ntype considered herein should be common in periodic lattices.\n", "  In this work, we aim to understand the influence of the heterogeneity of\ninfection rates on the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic\nspreading. Employing the classic SIS model as the benchmark, we study the\ninfluence of the independently identically distributed infection rates on the\naverage fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state. The log-normal,\ngamma and a newly designed distributions are considered for infection rates. We\nfind that, when the recovery rate is small, i.e.\\ the epidemic spreads out in\nboth homogeneous and heterogeneous cases: 1) the heterogeneity of infection\nrates on average retards the virus spreading, and 2) a larger even-order moment\nof the infection rates leads to a smaller average fraction of infected nodes,\nbut the odd-order moments contribute in the opposite way; when the recovery\nrate is large, i.e.\\ the epidemic may die out or infect a small fraction of the\npopulation, the heterogeneity of infection rates may enhance the probability\nthat the epidemic spreads out. Finally, we verify our conclusions via\nreal-world networks with their heterogeneous infection rates. Our results\nsuggest that, in reality the epidemic spread may not be so severe as the\nclassic SIS model indicates, but to eliminate the epidemic is probably more\ndifficult.\n", "  A new class of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations representing\nanisotropic distribution of matter on pseudo-spheroidal spacetime is obtained.\nThe parameters appearing in the model are restricted through physical\nrequirements of the model. It is found that the models given in the present\nwork is compatible with observational data of a wide variety of compact objects\nlike 4U 1820-30, PSR J1903+327, 4U 1608-52, Vela X-1, PSR J1614-2230, SMC X-4,\nCen X-3. A particular model of pulsar PSR J1614-2230 is studied in detail and\nfound that it satisfies all physical requirements needed for physically\nacceptable model.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the clustering of galaxies using a modified\nNewtonian potential. This modification of the Newtonian potential occurs due to\nthe existence of extra dimensions in brane world models. We will analyze a\nsystem of galaxies interacting with each other through this modified Newtonian\npotential. The partition function for this system of galaxies will be\ncalculated, and this partition function will be used to calculate the free\nenergy of this system of galaxies. The entropy and the chemical potential for\nthis system will also be calculated. We will derive explicit expression for the\nclustering parameter for this system. This parameter will determine the\nbehavior of this system, and we will be able to express various thermodynamic\nquantities using this clustering parameter. Thus, we will be able to explicitly\nanalyze the effect that modifying the Newtonian potential can have on the\nclustering of galaxies. We also analyze the effect of extra dimensions on the\ntwo-point functions between galaxies.\n", "  The multihadron production in nucleus-nucleus collisions and its\ninterrelation with that in (anti)proton-proton interactions are studied by\nexploring the charged particle mean multiplicity collision-energy and\ncentrality dependencies in the measurements to date. The study is performed in\nthe framework of the recently proposed effective-energy approach which, under\nthe proper scaling of the collision energy, combines the constituent quark\npicture with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics counting for the\ncentrality-defined effective energy of participants and relating different\ntypes of collisions. Within this approach, the multiplicity energy dependence\nand the pseudorapidity spectra from the most central nuclear collisions are\nwell reproduced. The study of the multiplicity centrality dependence reveals a\nnew scaling between the measured pseudorapidity spectra and the calculations.\nBy means of this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation\nscaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra for all centralities. The\nscaling elucidates some differences in the multiplicity and midrapidity density\ncentrality dependence obtained at RHIC and LHC. These findings reveal an\ninherent similarity in the multiplicity energy dependence from the most central\ncollisions and centrality data. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions to occur\nat about a TeV energy is indicated, similar to that observed in the earlier\nstudies of the midrapidity densities. Predictions are made for the mean\nmultiplicities to be measured in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at the\nLHC.\n", "  Nowadays, millions of people interact on a daily basis on online social media\nlike Facebook and Twitter, where they share and discuss information about a\nwide variety of topics. In this paper, we focus on a specific online social\nnetwork, Twitter, and we analyze multiple datasets each one consisting of\nindividuals' online activity before, during and after an exceptional event in\nterms of volume of the communications registered. We consider important events\nthat occurred in different arenas that range from policy to culture or science.\nFor each dataset, the users' online activities are modeled by a multilayer\nnetwork in which each layer conveys a different kind of interaction,\nspecifically: retweeting, mentioning and replying. This representation allows\nus to unveil that these distinct types of interaction produce networks with\ndifferent statistical properties, in particular concerning the degree\ndistribution and the clustering structure. These results suggests that models\nof online activity cannot discard the information carried by this multilayer\nrepresentation of the system, and should account for the different processes\ngenerated by the different kinds of interactions. Secondly, our analysis\nunveils the presence of statistical regularities among the different events,\nsuggesting that the non-trivial topological patterns that we observe may\nrepresent universal features of the social dynamics on online social networks\nduring exceptional events.\n", "  In ABO3 perovskites, oxygen octahedron rotations are common structural\ndistortions that can promote large ferroelectricity in BiFeO3 with an R3c\nstructure [1], but suppress ferroelectricity in CaTiO3 with a Pbnm symmetry\n[2]. For many CaTiO3-like perovskites, the BiFeO3 structure is a metastable\nphase. Here, we report the stabilization of the highly-polar BiFeO3-like phase\nof CaTiO3 in a BaTiO3/CaTiO3 superlattice grown on a SrTiO3 substrate. The\nstabilization is realized by a reconstruction of oxygen octahedron rotations at\nthe interface from the pattern of nonpolar bulk CaTiO3 to a different pattern\nthat is characteristic of a BiFeO3 phase. The reconstruction is interpreted\nthrough a combination of amplitude-contrast sub 0.1nm high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy and first-principles theories of the\nstructure, energetics, and polarization of the superlattice and its\nconstituents. We further predict a number of new artificial ferroelectric\nmaterials demonstrating that nonpolar perovskites can be turned into\nferroelectrics via this interface mechanism. Therefore, a large number of\nperovskites with the CaTiO3 structure type, which include many magnetic\nrepresentatives, are now good candidates as novel highly-polar multiferroic\nmaterials [3].\n", "  Self-propelled colloidal objects, such as motile bacteria or synthetic\nmicroswimmers, have microscopically irreversible individual dynamics - a\nfeature they share with all living systems. The incoherent behaviour of\nindividual swimmers can then be harnessed (or \"rectified\") by microfluidic\ndevices that create systematic motions impossible in equilibrium. Examples\ninclude flow of rotor particles round a circuit, steady rotation of a gear\nwheel in a bacterial bath, and pumping of bacteria between chambers by \"funnel\ngates\". Here we present a computational proof-of-concept study, showing that\nsuch active rectification devices might be created directly from an\nunstructured \"primordial soup\" of motile particles, solely by using spatially\nmodulated illumination to control their local propulsion speed. Alongside both\nmicroscopic irreversibility and speed modulation, our mechanism requires\nspatial symmetry breaking, such as a chevron light pattern, and strong\ninteractions between particles, such as volume exclusion causing a collisional\nslow-down at high density. These four factors create a many-body rectification\nmechanism that generically differs from one-body microfluidic antecedents. Our\nwork suggests that standard spatial-light-modulator technology might allow the\nprogrammable, light-induced self-assembly of active rectification devices from\nan unstructured particle bath.\n", "  Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics is here shown to fail when the coalescing\nspecies are dilute and transported by a turbulent flow. The intermittent\nLagrangian motion involves correlated violent events that lead to an unexpected\nrapid occurrence of the largest particles. This new phenomena is here\nquantified in terms of the anomalous scaling of turbulent three-point motion,\nleading to significant corrections in macroscopic processes that are critically\nsensitive to the early-stage emergence of large embryonic aggregates, as in\nplanet formation or rain precipitation.\n", "  When considering the effect of quantum noise (QN) in a phase-insensitive\nlinear amplifier or attenuator, it is customary to use the single channel Caves\nmodel (SC-CM). Although this model is valid in simple situations, such as the\npresence of a beam splitter, it is not necessarily valid when a system with\nmany degrees of freedom is involved. In order to address this issue, we\nconsider in this paper various atomic transitions corresponding to\namplification or attenuation using the master-equation- (ME-) based approach to\nmodel the QN and to compare the results with the SC-CM. For a four-level system\nthat consists of a transition producing a broad gain peak and a transition\nproducing an absorption dip, which results in perfect transparency at the\ncenter, we observe a catastrophic breakdown of the SC-CM. We also show that for\na general two-level atomic system, the SC-CM does not apply, except in the\nlimiting case when only either amplification or attenuation exists. A special\ncase where the two models predict the same result is a {\\Lambda}-type\nthree-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system in which the\nQN at zero detuning vanishes while the system is in the dark state. We also\nstudy an optically pumped five-level gain EIT system which has a perfect\ntransparency dip superimposed on a gain profile, and yields the negative\ndispersion suitable for use in enhancing the sensitivity-bandwidth product of\nan interferometric gravitational wave detector. In this case, we find that, for\nsome set of parameters, the QN is vanishingly small at the center of the dip,\nand the SC-CM agrees closely with the ME model. However, we also find that for\nsome other set of parameters, the SC-SM model disagrees strongly with the ME\nmodel. All these cases illustrate a wide range of variations in the degree of\ndisagreement between the predictions of the SC-CM and the ME approaches.\n", "  We propose a scheme for generating two-dimensional turbulence in harmonically\ntrapped atomic condensates with the novelty of controlling the polarization\n(net rotation) of the turbulence. Our scheme is based on an initial giant\n(multicharged) vortex which induces a large-scale circular flow. Two thin\nobstacles, created by blue-detuned laser beams, speed up the decay of the giant\nvortex into many singly-quantized vortices of the same circulation; at the same\ntime, vortex-antivortex pairs are created by the decaying circular flow past\nthe obstacles. Rotation of the obstacles against the circular flow controls the\nrelative proportion of positive and negative vortices, from the limit of\nstrongly anisotropic turbulence (almost all vortices having the same sign) to\nthat of isotropic turbulence (equal number of vortices and antivortices). Using\nthe new scheme, we numerically study quantum turbulence and report on its decay\nas a function of the polarization.\n", "  In two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), there exists an interesting possibility,\nthe hidden light Higgs scenario, that the discovered SM-like Higgs boson is the\nheavier \\textit{CP}-even Higgs boson $H^0$ and the lighter \\textit{CP}-even\n$h^0$ has not been observed yet in any experiment. We study the current status\nof this scenario in Types I, II, X, and Y, through the scans of the 2HDM\nparameters with all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints. We\nemploy not only the most up-to-date Higgs signal strength measurements with the\nfeed-down effects, but also all the available LHC exclusion limits from heavy\nHiggs searches. Adjusting the heavier $H^0$ to the 125 GeV state while hiding\nthe lighter $h^0$ from the LEP Higgs search prohibits the extreme decoupling\nlimit: there exist upper bounds on the masses of the pseudoscalar $A^0$ and the\ncharged Higgs $H^\\pm$ below about 600 GeV. In addition, the $Z_2$ symmetry is\nshown to be a good approximate symmetry since the soft $Z_2$ symmetry breaking\nparameter $m_{12}^2$ should be less than about (45 GeV)$^2$. Most\ninterestingly, a few parameters in the Higgs potential and the related Higgs\ntriple and quartic couplings are shown to be meaningfully constrained by the\ncurrent data. The double Higgs-strahlung process at an $e^+ e^-$ collider is\nalso studied.\n", "  Based on mean field calculations with Skyrme interactions, we extract a\nconstraint on the isovector effective mass in nuclear matter at saturation\ndensity $\\rho_0$, i.e., $m_{v}^{\\ast}(\\rho_0)=(0.77\\pm0.03) m$ by combining the\nexperimental data of the centroid energy of the isovector giant dipole\nresonance (IVGDR) and the electric dipole polarizability $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{D}}$\nin $^{208}$Pb. Meanwhile, the isoscalar effective mass at $\\rho_0$ is\ndetermined to be $m_{s}^{\\ast}(\\rho_0)=(0.91\\pm0.05) m$ by analyzing the\nmeasured excitation energy of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR)\nin $^{208}$Pb. From the constrained $m_{s}^{\\ast}(\\rho_0)$ and\n$m_{v}^{\\ast}(\\rho_0)$, we obtain the isospin splitting of nucleon effective\nmass in asymmetric nuclear matter of isospin asymmetry $\\delta$ at $\\rho_0$ as\n$[m_n^{\\ast}(\\rho_0,\\delta)-m_p^{\\ast}(\\rho_0,\\delta)]/m = \\Delta m^*_1(\\rho_0)\n\\delta + O(\\delta^3)$ with the linear isospin splitting coefficient $\\Delta\nm^*_1(\\rho_0) = 0.33\\pm0.16$. We notice that using the recently corrected data\non the $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{D}}$ in $^{208}$Pb with the contribution of the\nquasideuteron effect subtracted slightly enhances the isovector effective mass\nto $m_{v}^{\\ast}(\\rho_0)=(0.80\\pm0.03) m$ and reduces the linear isospin\nsplitting coefficient to $\\Delta m^*_1(\\rho_0) = 0.27\\pm0.15$. Furthermore, the\nconstraints on $m_{v}^{\\ast}(\\rho)$, $m_{s}^{\\ast}(\\rho)$ and $\\Delta\nm^*_1(\\rho)$ at other densities are obtained from the similar analyses and we\nfind that the $\\Delta m^*_1(\\rho)$ increases with the density.\n", "  We study the production of a top-quark pair in association with one and two\nvector bosons, $t \\bar t V$ and $t \\bar t VV$ with $V=\\gamma, Z, W^\\pm$, at the\nLHC. We provide predictions at next-to-leading order in QCD for total cross\nsections and top-quark charge asymmetries as well as for differential\ndistributions. A thorough discussion of the residual theoretical uncertainties\nrelated to missing higher orders and to parton distribution functions is\npresented. As an application, we calculate the total cross sections for this\nclass of processes (together with $t \\bar t H$ and $t \\bar t t \\bar t$\nproduction) at hadron colliders for energies up to 100 TeV. In addition, by\nmatching the NLO calculation to a parton shower, we determine the contribution\nof $t \\bar t V$ and $t \\bar t VV$ to final state signatures (two-photon and\ntwo-same-sign-, three- and four-lepton) relevant for $t \\bar t H$ analyses at\nthe Run II of the LHC.\n", "  Large-scale force generation is essential for biological functions such as\ncell motility, embryonic development, and muscle contraction. In these\nprocesses, forces generated at the molecular level by motor proteins are\ntransmitted by disordered fiber networks, resulting in large-scale active\nstresses. While these fiber networks are well characterized macroscopically,\nthis stress generation by microscopic active units is not well understood. Here\nwe theoretically study force transmission in these networks, and find that\nlocal active forces are rectified towards isotropic contraction and strongly\namplified as fibers collectively buckle in the vicinity of the active units.\nThis stress amplification is reinforced by the networks' disordered nature, but\nsaturates for high densities of active units. Our predictions are\nquantitatively consistent with experiments on reconstituted tissues and\nactomyosin networks, and shed light on the role of the network microstructure\nin shaping active stresses in cells and tissue.\n", "  We give a new type of Schur-Weyl duality for the representations of a family\nof quantum subgroups and their centralizer algebra. We define and classify\nsingly-generated, Yang-Baxter relation planar algebras. We present the skein\ntheoretic construction of a new parameterized planar algebra. We construct\ninfinitely many new subfactors and unitary fusion categories, and compute their\ntrace formula as a closed-form expression, in terms of Young diagrams.\n", "  We derive new constraints on the neutron lifetime based on the recent Planck\n2015 observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB.\nUnder the assumption of standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we show that Planck\ndata constrains the neutron lifetime to $\\tau_n=(907 \\pm 69) \\, [\\text{s}]$ at\n$68 \\%$ c.l.. Moreover, by including the direct measurements of primordial\nHelium abundance of Aver et al. (2015) and Izotov et al. (2014), we show that\ncosmological data provide the stringent constraints $\\tau_n=(875 \\pm 19) \\,\n[\\text{s}]$ and $\\tau_n=(921 \\pm 11) \\, [\\text{s}]$ respectively. The latter\nappears to be in tension with neutron lifetime value quoted by the Particle\nData Group ($\\tau_n=(880.3 \\pm 1.1) \\, [\\text{s}]$). Future CMB surveys as\nCOrE+, in combination with a weak lensing survey as EUCLID, could constrain the\nneutron lifetime up to a $\\sim 6 \\, [\\text{s}]$ precision.\n", "  We report evidence for excess blue light from the Type Ia supernova SN 2012cg\nat fifteen and sixteen days before maximum B-band brightness. The emission is\nconsistent with predictions for the impact of the supernova on a non-degenerate\nbinary companion. This is the first evidence for emission from a companion to a\nSN Ia. Sixteen days before maximum light, the B-V color of SN 2012cg is 0.2 mag\nbluer than for other normal SN~Ia. At later times, this supernova has a typical\nSN Ia light curve, with extinction-corrected M_B = -19.62 +/- 0.02 mag and\nDelta m_{15}(B) = 0.86 +/- 0.02. Our data set is extensive, with photometry in\n7 filters from 5 independent sources. Early spectra also show the effects of\nblue light, and high-velocity features are observed at early times. Near\nmaximum, the spectra are normal with a silicon velocity v_{Si} = -10,500$ km\ns^{-1}. Comparing the early data with models by Kasen (2010) favors a\nmain-sequence companion of about 6 solar masses. It is possible that many other\nSN Ia have main-sequence companions that have eluded detection because the\nemission from the impact is fleeting and faint.\n", "  Coupled oscillator models where $N$ oscillators are identical and\nsymmetrically coupled to all others with full permutation symmetry $S_N$ are\nfound in a variety of applications. Much, but not all, work on phase\ndescriptions of such systems consider the special case of pairwise coupling\nbetween oscillators. In this paper, we show this is restrictive - and we\ncharacterise generic multi-way interactions between oscillators that are\ntypically present, except at the very lowest order near a Hopf bifurcation\nwhere the oscillations emerge. We examine a network of identical weakly coupled\ndynamical systems that are close to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation by\nconsidering two parameters, $\\epsilon$ (the strength of coupling) and $\\lambda$\n(an unfolding parameter for the Hopf bifurcation). For small enough $\\lambda>0$\nthere is an attractor that is the product of $N$ stable limit cycles; this\npersists as a normally hyperbolic invariant torus for sufficiently small\n$\\epsilon>0$. Using equivariant normal form theory, we derive a generic normal\nform for a system of coupled phase oscillators with $S_N$ symmetry. For fixed\n$N$ and taking the limit $0<\\epsilon\\ll\\lambda\\ll 1$, we show that the\nattracting dynamics of the system on the torus can be well approximated by a\ncoupled phase oscillator system that, to lowest order, is the well-known\nKuramoto-Sakaguchi system of coupled oscillators. The next order of\napproximation genericlly includes terms with up to four interacting phases,\nregardless of $N$. Using a normalization that maintains nontrivial interactions\nin the limit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, we show that the additional terms can lead\nto new phenomena in terms of coexistence of two-cluster states with the same\nphase difference but different cluster size.\n", "  The electrostatic self-force on a point charge in cylindrical thin-shell\nspace-times is interpreted as the sum of a $bulk$ field and a $shell$ field.\nThe $bulk$ part corresponds to a field sourced by the test charge placed in a\nspace-time without the shell. The $shell$ field accounts for the discontinuity\nof the extrinsic curvature ${\\kappa^p}_q$. An equivalent electric problem is\nstated, in which the effect of the shell of matter on the field is\nreconstructed with the electric potential produced by a non-gravitating charge\ndistribution of total image charge $Q$, to interpret the shell field in both\nthe interior and exterior regions of the space-time. The self-force on a point\ncharge $q$ in a locally flat geometry with a cylindrical thin-shell of matter\nis calculated. The charge is repelled from the shell if\n${\\kappa^{p}}_{p}=\\kappa<0$ (ordinary matter) and attracted toward the shell if\n$\\kappa>0$ (exotic matter). The total image charge is zero for exterior\nproblems, while for interior problems $Q/q=-\\kappa \\, r_e$, with $r_e$ the\nexternal radius of the shell. The procedure is general and can be applied to\ninterpret self-forces in other space-times with shells, e.g., for locally flat\nwormholes we found $Q_{\\mp}^{wh}/q=-1/ (\\kappa_{wh} r_{\\pm})$.\n", "  For the Run 2 of the LHC next-to-leading order electroweak corrections will\nplay an important role. Even though they are typically moderate at the level of\ntotal cross sections they can lead to substantial deviations in the shapes of\ndistributions. In particular for new physics searches but also for a precise\ndetermination of Standard Model observables their inclusion in the theoretical\npredictions is mandatory for a reliable estimation of the Standard Model\ncontribution. In this article we review the status and recent developments in\nelectroweak calculations and their automation for LHC processes. We discuss\ngeneral issues and properties of NLO electroweak corrections and present some\nexamples, including the full calculation of the NLO corrections to the\nproduction of a W boson in association with two jets computed using GoSaM\ninterfaced to MadDipole.\n", "  Three-dimensional orientational order in systems whose ground states possess\nnon-zero, chiral gradients typically exhibits line-like structures or defects:\n$\\lambda$ lines in cholesterics or Skyrmion tubes in ferromagnets for example.\nHere we show that such lines can be identified as a set of natural geometric\nsingularities in a unit vector field, the generalisation of the umbilic points\nof a surface. We characterise these lines in terms of the natural vector\nbundles that the order defines and show that they give a way to localise and\nidentify Skyrmion distortions in chiral materials -- in particular that they\nsupply a natural representative of the Poincar\\'{e} dual of the cocycle\ndescribing the topology. Their global structure leads to the definition of a\nself-linking number and helicity integral which relates the linking of umbilic\nlines to the Hopf invariant of the texture.\n", "  Dynamical processes on networks are currently being considered in different\ndomains of cross-disciplinary interest. Reaction-diffusion systems hosted on\ndirected graphs are in particular relevant for their widespread applications,\nfrom neuroscience, to computer networks and traffic systems. Due to the\npeculiar spectrum of the discrete Laplacian operator, homogeneous fixed points\ncan turn unstable, on a directed support, because of the topology of the\nnetwork, a phenomenon which cannot be induced on undirected graphs. A linear\nanalysis can be performed to single out the conditions that underly the\ninstability. The complete characterization of the patterns, which are\neventually attained beyond the linear regime of exponential growth, calls\ninstead for a full non linear treatment. By performing a multiple time scale\nperturbative calculation, we here derive an effective equation for the non\nlinear evolution of the amplitude of the most unstable mode, close to the\nthreshold of criticality. This is a Stuart-Landau equation whose complex\ncoefficients appear to depend on the topological features of the embedding\ndirected graph. The theory proves adequate versus simulations, as confirmed by\noperating with a paradigmatic reaction-diffusion model.\n", "  This pedagogical comment highlights three misconceptions concerning the\nusefulness of the concept of negative temperature; being derived from the\nusual, often termed Boltzmann, definition of entropy. First, both the Boltzmann\nand Gibbs entropies must obey the same thermodynamic consistency relation.\nSecond, the Boltzmann entropy does obey the second law of thermodynamics.\nThird, there exists an integrating factor of the heat differential with both\ndefinitions of entropy.\n", "  We find that motion in internal moduli spaces of generic domain walls has an\nupper bound for its velocity. Our finding is based on our generic formula for\nall-order effective actions of internal moduli parameter of domain wall\nsolitons. It is known that the Nambu-Goldstone mode $Z$ associated with\nspontaneous breaking of translation symmetry obeys a Nambu-Goto effective\nLagrangian $\\sqrt{1 - (\\partial_0 Z)^2}$ detecting the speed of light\n($|\\partial_0 Z|=1$) in the target spacetime. Solitons can have internal moduli\nparameters as well, associated with a breaking of internal symmetries such as a\nphase rotation acting on a field. We obtain, for generic domain walls, an\neffective Lagrangian of the internal moduli $\\epsilon$ to all order in\n$(\\partial \\epsilon)$. The Lagrangian is given by a function of the Nambu-Goto\nLagrangian: $L = g(\\sqrt{1 + (\\partial_\\mu \\epsilon)^2})$. This shows\ngenerically the existence of an upper bound on $\\partial_0 \\epsilon$, i.e. a\nspeed limit in the internal space. The speed limit exists even for solitons in\nsome non-relativistic field theories, where we find that $\\epsilon$ is a type I\nNambu-Goldstone mode which also obeys a nonlinear dispersion to reach the speed\nlimit. This offers a possibility of detecting the speed limit in condensed\nmatter experiments.\n", "  A search for supersymmetry involving events with at least one photon, one\nelectron or muon, and large missing transverse momentum has been performed by\nthe CMS experiment. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of\n19.7 inverse femtobarns of pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, produced at the\nCERN LHC. No excess of events is observed beyond expectations from standard\nmodel processes. The result of the search is interpreted in the context of a\ngeneral model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, where the charged and\nneutral winos are the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles. Within this\nmodel, winos with a mass up to 360 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence\nlevel. Two simplified models inspired by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking\nare also examined, and used to derive upper limits on the production cross\nsections of specific supersymmetric processes.\n", "  We show how the squeezing of light can lead to the formation of topological\nstates. Such states are characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers, and exhibit\nprotected edge modes which give rise to chiral elastic and inelastic photon\ntransport. These topological bosonic states are not equivalent to their\nfermionic (topological superconductor) counterparts and cannot be mapped by a\nlocal transformation onto topological states found in particle-conserving\nmodels. They thus represent a new type of topological system. We study this\nphysics in detail in the case of a Kagome lattice model, and discuss possible\nrealizations using nonlinear photonic crystals or superconducting circuits.\n", "  The helicity of a free massless relativistic particle, $\\chi^o={\\bf s}.{\\bf\np}/|{\\bf p}|$, is generalized, for a particle in an electromagnetic field, to\n$\\chi={\\bf s}.{\\bf p}/{\\cal E}$, where ${\\cal E}$ is the modified kinetic\nenergy. Both $\\chi^o$ and $\\chi$ coincide and are conserved for minimal\ncoupling (gyromagnetic ratio $g=0$) but are different and neither of them is\nconserved when the coupling is non-minimal, $g\\neq0$, generating non-zero\neffective mass. For a chiral particle with $g=2$ in a constant electric field\nboth helicities converge asymptotically to the same value. Helicity is also\nconserved for minimal gravitational coupling.\n", "  We investigate the steady state photon transport in a nonequilibrium\ncollective-qubit model. By adopting the noninteracting blip approximation,\nwhich is applicable in the strong photon-qubit coupling regime, we describe the\nessential contribution of indirect qubit-qubit interaction to the population\ndistribution, mediated by the photonic baths. The linear relations of both the\noptimal flux and noise power with the qubits system size are obtained.\nMoreover, the inversed power-law style for the finite-size scaling of the\noptimal photon-qubit coupling strength is exhibited, which is proposed to be\nuniversal.\n", "  Following the development of a scheme to bosonize and debosonize consistently\n[N. Shah and C.J. Bolech, Phys. Rev B 93, 085440 (2016); arXiv:1508.03078], we\npresent in detail the Toulouse-point analytic solution of the two-lead Kondo\njunction model. The existence and location of the solvable point is not\nmodified, but the calculational methodology and the final expressions for\nobservable quantities change markedly as compared to the existent results. This\nsolvable point is one of the remarkably few exact results for non-equilibrium\ntransport in correlated systems. It yields relatively simple analytical\nexpressions for the current in the full range of temperature, magnetic field\nand voltage. It also shows precisely, within the limitations of the Toulouse\nfine-tuning, how the transport evolves depending on the relative strengths of\ninter-lead and intra-lead Kondo exchange couplings ranging from weak to strong.\nThus its improved understanding is an important stepping stone for future\nresearch.\n", "  Thermal inflation is an attractive idea to dilute cosmic density of unwanted\nparticles such as moduli fields which cause cosmological difficulties. However,\nit also dilutes preexisting baryon asymmetry and some viable baryogenesis is\nnecessary for a cosmologically consistent scenario. We investigate whether the\nAffleck-Dine mechanism can produce baryon asymmetry enough to survive after the\ndilution in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models. Flat directions except for\n$LH_u$ flat direction cannot provide such huge baryon number because of Q-ball\nformation. We show that although the $LH_u$ flat direction is special in terms\nof having $\\mu$-term which prevents Q-ball formation, it cannot explain the\nobserved baryon asymmetry either.\n", "  We present a high resolution study of the impact of realistic satellite\ngalaxies, extracted from cosmological simulations of Milky Way haloes including\n6 Aquarius suites and Via Lactea \\rom{2}, on the dynamics of the galactic disc.\nThe initial conditions for the multi-component Milky Way galaxy were generated\nusing the GalIC code, to ensure a system in dynamical equilibrium state prior\nto addition of satellites. Candidate subhaloes that came closer than 25\\,kpc to\nthe centre of the host DM haloes with initial mass enclosed within the tidal\nradius, $M_\\textrm{tid}$ $\\ge$ 10$^{8} M_{\\odot}$\\,=\\,0.003 $M_\\textrm{disc}$,\nwere identified, inserted into our high resolution N-body simulations and\nevolved for 2 Gyr. We quantified the vertical heating due to such impacts by\nmeasuring the disc thickness and squared vertical velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_{z}^{2}$ across the disc. According to our analysis the strength of\nheating is strongly dependent on the high mass end of the subhalo distribution\nfrom cosmological simulations. The mean increase of the vertical dispersion is\n$\\sim$ 20\\,km$^{2}$\\,s$^{-2}$\\,Gyr$^{-1}$ for R $>$ 4\\,kpc with a flat radial\nprofile while, excluding Aq-F2 results, the mean heating is $<$\n12\\,km$^{2}$\\,s$^{-2}$\\,Gyr$^{-1}$, corresponding to 28\\% and 17\\% of the\nobserved vertical heating rate in the solar neighbourhood. Taking into account\nthe statistical dispersion around the mean we miss the observed heating rate by\nmore than 3$\\sigma$. We observed a general flaring of the disc height in the\ncase of all 7 simulations in the outer disc.\n", "  We introduce the spectrum bifurcation renormalization group (SBRG) as a\ngeneralization of the real-space renormalization group for the many-body\nlocalized (MBL) system without truncating the Hilbert space. Starting from a\ndisordered many-body Hamiltonian in the full MBL phase, the SBRG flows to the\nMBL fixed-point Hamiltonian, and generates the local conserved quantities and\nthe matrix product state representations for all eigenstates. The method is\napplicable to both spin and fermion models with arbitrary interaction strength\non any lattice in all dimensions, as long as the models are in the MBL phase.\nIn particular, we focus on the $1d$ interacting Majorana chain with strong\ndisorder, and map out its phase diagram using the entanglement entropy. The\nSBRG flow also generates an entanglement holographic mapping, which duals the\nMBL state to a fragmented holographic space decorated with small blackholes.\n", "  Studies of the formation of the first stars have established that they formed\nin small halos of $\\sim 10^5 - 10^6 M_{\\odot}$ via molecular hydrogen cooling.\nSince a low level of ultraviolet radiation from stars suffices to dissociate\nmolecular hydrogen, under the usually-assumed scenario this primordial mode of\nstar formation ended by redshift $z \\sim 15$ and much more massive halos came\nto dominate star formation. However, metal enrichment from the first stars may\nhave allowed the smaller halos to continue to form stars. In this Letter we\nexplore the possible effect of star formation in metal-rich low-mass halos on\nthe redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from $z = 6-40$. These halos\nare significantly affected by the supersonic streaming velocity, with its\ncharacteristic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature. Thus, enrichment of\nlow-mass galaxies can produce a strong signature in the 21-cm power spectrum\nover a wide range of redshifts, especially if star formation in the small halos\nwas more efficient than suggested by current simulations. We show that upcoming\nradio telescopes can easily distinguish among various possible scenarios.\n", "  We put forward a simpler and improved variation of a recently proposed method\nto overcome the signal-to-noise problem found in Monte Carlo calculations of\nthe entanglement entropy of interacting fermions. The present method takes\nadvantage of the approximate lognormal distributions that characterize the\nsignal-to-noise properties of other approaches. In addition, we show that a\nsimple rewriting of the formalism allows circumvention of the inversion of the\nrestricted one-body density matrix in the calculation of the $n$-th R\\'enyi\nentanglement entropy for $n>2$. We test our technique by implementing it in\ncombination with the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm and calculating the $n=2,3,4,\n\\dots, 10$ R\\'enyi entropies of the 1D attractive Hubbard model. We use that\ndata to extrapolate to the von Neumann ($n=1$) and $n\\to\\infty$ cases.\n", "  We present a method for determining correlations in a gas of indirect\nexcitons in a semiconductor quantum well structure. The method involves\nsubjecting the excitons to a periodic electrostatic potential that causes\nmodulations of the exciton density and photoluminescence (PL). Experimentally\nmeasured amplitudes of energy and intensity modulations of exciton PL serve as\nan input to a theoretical estimate of the exciton correlation parameter and\ntemperature. We also present a proof-of-principle demonstration of the method\nfor determining the correlation parameter and discuss how its accuracy can be\nimproved.\n", "  We investigate how the multiple bands of fermions on a crystal lattice evolve\nif a magnetic field is added which does not increase the number of bands. The\nkagome lattice is studied as generic example for a lattice with loops of three\nbonds. Finite Chern numbers occur as non-trivial topological property in\npresence of the magnetic field. The symmetries and periodicities as function of\nthe applied field are discussed. Strikingly, the dispersions of the edge states\ndepend crucially on the precise shape of the boundary. This suggests that\nsuitable design of the boundaries helps to tune physical properties which may\neven differ between upper and lower edge. Moreover, we suggest a promising\ngauge to realize this model in optical lattices.\n", "  We study Quantum Electrodynamics in d=3 (QED_3) coupled to N_f flavors of\nfermions. The theory flows to an IR fixed point for N_f larger than some\ncritical number N_f^c. For N_f<= N_f^c, chiral-symmetry breaking is believed to\ntake place. In analogy with the Wilson-Fisher description of the critical O(N)\nmodels in d=3, we make use of the existence of a perturbative fixed point in\nd=4-2epsilon to study the three-dimensional conformal theory. We compute in\nperturbation theory the IR dimensions of fermion bilinear and quadrilinear\noperators. For small N_f, a quadrilinear operator can become relevant in the IR\nand destabilize the fixed point. Therefore, the epsilon-expansion can be used\nto estimate N_f^c. An interesting novelty compared to the O(N) models is that\nthe theory in d=3 has an enhanced symmetry due to the structure of 3d spinors.\nWe identify the operators in d=4-2epsilon that correspond to the additional\nconserved currents at d=3 and compute their infrared dimensions.\n", "  A model for the asteroid resurfacing by regolith convection is built to\nestimate its timescale. In the model, regolith convection is driven by the\nimpact-induced global seismic shaking. The model consists of three steps: (i)\nintermittent impact of meteoroids, (ii) impact-induced global vibration\n(seismic shaking), and (iii) vibration-induced regolith convection. In order to\nassess the feasibility of the resurfacing process driven by regolith\nconvection, we estimate the resurfacing timescale as a function of the size of\na target asteroid. In the estimate, a set of parameter values is assumed on the\nbasis of previous works. However, some of them (e.g., seismic quality factor\n$Q$, seismic efficiency $\\eta$, and seismic frequency $f$) are very uncertain.\nAlthough these parameter values might depend on asteroid size, we employ the\nstandard values to estimate the representative behavior. To clarify the\nparameter dependences, we develop an approximated scaling form for the\nresurfacing timescale. According to the estimated result, we find that the\nregolith-convection-based resurfacing timescale is shorter than the mean\ncollisional lifetime in most of the parameter uncertainty ranges. These\nparameter ranges are within those reported by previous works for small\nasteroids. This means that the regolith convection can be a possible mechanism\nfor the asteroid resurfacing process.\n", "  One of the key clues to consider rainfall as a self-organized critical\nphenomenon is the existence of power-law distributions for rain-event sizes. We\nhave studied the problem of universality in the exponents of these\ndistributions by means of a suitable statistic whose distribution is inferred\nby several variations of a permutational test. In contrast to more common\napproaches, our procedure does not suffer from the difficulties of multiple\ntesting and does not require the precise knowledge of the uncertainties\nassociated to the power-law exponents. When applied to seven sites monitored by\nthe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program the test lead to the rejection of\nthe universality hypothesis, despite the fact that the exponents are rather\nclose to each other.\n", "  Graphene, a zero-gap semimetal, can be transformed into a metallic,\nsemiconducting or insulating state by either physical or chemical modification.\nSuperconductivity is conspicuously missing among these states despite\nconsiderable experimental efforts as well as many theoretical proposals. Here,\nwe report superconductivity in calcium-decorated graphene achieved by\nintercalation of graphene laminates that consist of well separated and\nelectronically decoupled graphene crystals. In contrast to intercalated\ngraphite, we find that Ca is the only dopant that induces superconductivity in\ngraphene laminates above 1.8 K among intercalants used in our experiments such\nas potassium, caesium and lithium. Ca-decorated graphene becomes\nsuperconducting at ~ 6 K and the transition temperature is found to be strongly\ndependent on the confinement of the Ca layer and the induced charge carrier\nconcentration. In addition to the first evidence for superconducting graphene,\nour work shows a possibility of inducing and studying superconductivity in\nother 2D materials using their laminates.\n", "  Generalizations of the classic Bell inequality to higher dimensional quantum\nsystems known as qudits are reputed to exhibit a higher degree of robustness to\nnoise, but such claims are based on one particular noise model. We analyze the\nviolation of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality subject to more\nrealistic noise sources and their scaling with dimension. This analysis is\ninspired by potential Bell inequality experiments with superconducting\nresonator-based qudits. We find that the robustness of the inequality to noise\ngenerally decreases with increasing qudit dimension.\n", "  We investigate the local quantum uncertainty (LQU) between a block of L\nqubits and one single qubit in a composite system of n qubits driven through a\nquantum phase transition (QPT). A first-order QPT is analytically considered\nthrough a Hamiltonian implementation of the quantum search. In the case of\nsecond-order QPTs, we consider the transverse-field Ising chain via a numerical\nanalysis through density matrix renormalization group. For both cases, we\ncompute the LQU for finite-sizes as a function of L and of the coupling\nparameter, analyzing its pronounced behavior at the QPT.\n", "  A topological nodal-line semimetal is a new condensed matter state with\none-dimensional bulk nodal lines and two-dimensional drumhead surface bands.\nBased on first-principles calculations and our effective k . p model, we\npropose the existence of topological nodal-line fermions in the ternary\ntransition- metal chalcogenide TlTaSe2. The noncentrosymmetric structure and\nstrong spin-orbit coupling give rise to spinful nodal-line bulk states which\nare protected by a mirror reflection symmetry of this compound. This is\nremarkably distinguished from other proposed nodal-line semimetals such as\nCu3NPb(Zn) in which nodal lines exist only in the limit of vanishing spin-orbit\ncoupling. We show that the drumhead surface states in TlTaSe2, which are\nassociated with the topological nodal lines, exhibit an unconventional chiral\nspin texture and an exotic Lifshitz transition as a consequence of the linkage\namong multiple drumhead surface-state pockets.\n", "  We study the lepton forward-backward asymmetry AFB and the longitudinal K*\npolarization FL, as well as an observable P2 derived from them, in the rare\ndecays B->K*l+l-, where l+l- is either e+e- or mu+mu-, using the full sample of\n471 million BBbar events collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Babar\ndetector at the PEP-II e+e- collider. We separately fit and report results for\nthe B+->K*+l+l- and B0->K*0l+l- final states, as well as their combination\nB->K*l+l-, in five disjoint dilepton mass-squared bins. An angular analysis of\nB+->K*+l+l- decays is presented here for the first time.\n", "  In the theory of Bethe-ansatz integrable quantum systems, rapidities play an\nimportant role as they are used to specify many-body states, apart from phases.\nThe physical interpretation of rapidities going back to Sutherland is that they\nare the asymptotic momenta after letting a quantum gas expand into a larger\nvolume making it dilute and noninteracting. We exploit this picture to make a\ndirect connection to quantities that are accessible in sudden-expansion\nexperiments with ultracold quantum gases. By a direct comparison of\nBethe-ansatz and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group results,\nwe demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard\nmodel can be predicted from knowing the distribution of occupied rapidities\ndefined by the initial state. Curiously, an approximate Bethe-ansatz solution\nworks well also for the Bose-Hubbard model.\n", "  We derive rigorous bounds on corrections to Einstein gravity using unitarity\nand analyticity of graviton scattering amplitudes. In $D\\geq 4$ spacetime\ndimensions, these consistency conditions mandate positive coefficients for\ncertain quartic curvature operators. We systematically enumerate all such\npositivity bounds in $D=4$ and $D=5$ before extending to $D\\geq 6$. Afterwards,\nwe derive positivity bounds for supersymmetric operators and verify that all of\nour constraints are satisfied by weakly-coupled string theories. Among\nquadratic curvature operators, we find that the Gauss-Bonnet term in $D\\geq 5$\nis inconsistent unless new degrees of freedom enter at the natural cutoff scale\ndefined by the effective theory. Our bounds apply to perturbative ultraviolet\ncompletions of gravity.\n", "  We consider the problem of solving TAP mean field equations by iteration for\nIsing model with coupling matrices that are drawn at random from general\ninvariant ensembles. We develop an analysis of iterative algorithms using a\ndynamical functional approach that in the thermodynamic limit yields an\neffective dynamics of a single variable trajectory. Our main novel contribution\nis the expression for the implicit memory term of the dynamics for general\ninvariant ensembles. By subtracting these terms, that depend on magnetizations\nat previous time steps, the implicit memory terms cancel making the iteration\ndependent on a Gaussian distributed field only. The TAP magnetizations are\nstable fixed points if an AT stability criterion is fulfilled. We illustrate\nour method explicitly for coupling matrices drawn from the random orthogonal\nensemble.\n", "  We discuss spatially resolved emission line spectroscopy secured for a total\nsample of 15 gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxies at a mean redshift of\n$z\\simeq2$ based on Keck laser-assisted adaptive optics observations undertaken\nwith the recently-improved OSIRIS integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph. By\nexploiting gravitationally lensed sources drawn primarily from the CASSOWARY\nsurvey, we sample these sub-L$^{\\ast}$ galaxies with source-plane resolutions\nof a few hundred parsecs ensuring well-sampled 2-D velocity data and resolved\nvariations in the gas-phase metallicity. Such high spatial resolution data\noffers a critical check on the structural properties of larger samples derived\nwith coarser sampling using multiple-IFU instruments. We demonstrate how\nkinematic complexities essential to understanding the maturity of an early\nstar-forming galaxy can often only be revealed with better sampled data.\nAlthough we include four sources from our earlier work, the present study\nprovides a more representative sample unbiased with respect to emission line\nstrength. Contrary to earlier suggestions, our data indicates a more diverse\nrange of kinematic and metal gradient behavior inconsistent with a simple\npicture of well-ordered rotation developing concurrently with established steep\nmetal gradients in all but merging systems. Comparing our observations with the\npredictions of hydrodynamical simulations suggests that gas and metals have\nbeen mixed by outflows or other strong feedback processes, flattening the metal\ngradients in early star-forming galaxies.\n", "  Alkali-earth atoms have a long-lived electronic excited state, which can be\nlocalized in the Fermi sea of ground state atoms by an external potential and\nserve as magnetic impurities, due to the spin-exchange interaction between the\nexcited and the ground state atoms. This can give rise to the Kondo effect.\nHowever, in order to achieve this effect in current atomic gas experiment, it\nrequires the Kondo temperature to be increased to a sizable portion of the\nFermi temperature. In this letter we propose that the spin-exchange interaction\ncan be strongly enhanced by utilizing the confinement-induced resonance (CIR).\nWe analyze this system by the renormalization group approach, and we show that\nnearby a CIR, the Kondo temperature can indeed be increased to the regime\nattainable by current experiments.\n", "  Neutrons are a particularly dangerous background for direct WIMP dark matter\nsearches; their nuclear recoils with the target nucleus are often\nindistinguishable from nuclear recoils produced by WIMP-nuclear collisions. In\nthis study, we explore the concept of a liquid scintillator neutron veto\ndetector that would allow direct dark matter detectors to potentially reject\nneutrons with greater than 99% efficiency. Here we outline the construction and\ntesting of a small prototype detector and the potential implications of this\ntechnology for future dark matter detectors.\n", "  We revisit the problem of Q-colourings of the triangular lattice using a\nmapping onto an integrable spin-one model, which can be solved exactly using\nBethe Ansatz techniques. In particular we focus on the low-energy excitations\nabove the eigenlevel g_2, which was shown by Baxter to dominate the transfer\nmatrix spectrum in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (chromatic polynomial) representation\nfor Q_0 <= Q <= 4, where Q_0 = 3.819671... We argue that g_2 and its scaling\nlevels define a conformally invariant theory, the so-called regime IV, which\nprovides the actual description of the (analytically continued) colouring\nproblem within a much wider range, namely 2 < Q <= 4. The corresponding\nconformal field theory is identified and the exact critical exponents are\nderived. We discuss their implications for the phase diagram of the\nantiferromagnetic triangular-lattice Potts model at non-zero temperature.\nFinally, we relate our results to recent observations in the field of spin-one\nanyonic chains.\n", "  We present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect measurements from wide-field images\ntowards the galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145 obtained from the Caltech\nSubmillimeter Observatory with the Multiwavelength Submillimeter Inductance\nCamera (MUSIC) at 147, 213, 281, and 337 GHz and with Bolocam at 140 GHz. As\npart of our analysis, we have used higher frequency data from Herschel-SPIRE\nand previously published lower frequency radio data to subtract the signal from\nthe brightest dusty star-forming galaxies behind RX J1347.5-1145 and from the\nAGN in RX J1347.5-1145's BCG. Using these five-band SZ effect images, combined\nwith X-ray spectroscopic measurements of the temperature of the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) from Chandra, we constrain the ICM optical depth to be $\\tau_e =\n7.33^{+0.96}_{-0.97} \\times 10^{-3}$ and the ICM line of sight peculiar\nvelocity to be $v_{pec} = -1040^{+870}_{-840}$ km s$^{-1}$. The errors for both\nquantities are limited by measurement noise rather than calibration\nuncertainties or astrophysical contamination, and significant improvements are\npossible with deeper observations. Our best-fit velocity is in good agreement\nwith one previously published SZ effect analysis and in mild tension with the\nother, although some or all of that tension may be because that measurement\nsamples a much smaller cluster volume. Furthermore, our best-fit optical depth\nimplies a gas mass slightly larger than the Chandra-derived value, implying the\ncluster is elongated along the line of sight.\n", "  X-ray techniques have been used for more than a century to study the atomic\nand electronic structure in virtually any type of material. The advent of\ncorrelated electron systems, in particular complex oxides, brought about new\nscientific challenges and opportunities for the advancement of conventional\nx-ray methods. In this context, the need for new approaches capable of\nselectively sensing new forms of orders involving all degrees of freedom --\ncharge, orbital, spin, and lattice -- paved the way for the emergence and\nsuccess of resonant x-ray scattering, which has become an increasingly popular\nand powerful tool for the study of electronic ordering phenomena in solids.\nHere we review the recent resonant x-ray scattering breakthroughs in the copper\noxide high-temperature superconductors, in particular regarding the phenomenon\nof charge order -- a broken-symmetry state occurring when valence electrons\nself-organize into periodic structures. After a brief historical perspective on\ncharge order, we outline the milestones in the development of resonant x-ray\nscattering, as well as the basic theoretical formalism underlying its unique\ncapabilities. The rest of the review will focus on the recent contributions of\nresonant scattering to the tremendous advancements in our description and\nunderstanding of charge order. To conclude, we propose a series of present and\nupcoming challenges, and discuss the future outlook for this technique.\n", "  We have used Raman scattering to investigate the magnetic excitations and\nlattice dynamics in the prototypical spin-orbit Mott insulators Sr2IrO4 and\nSr3Ir2O7. Both compounds exhibit pronounced two-magnon Raman scattering\nfeatures with different energies, lineshapes, and temperature dependencies,\nwhich in part reflect the different influence of long-range frustrating\nexchange interactions. Additionally, we find strong Fano asymmetries in the\nlineshapes of low-energy phonon modes in both compounds, which disappear upon\ncooling below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures. These unusual phonon\nanomalies indicate that the spin-orbit coupling in Mott-insulating iridates is\nnot sufficiently strong to quench the orbital dynamics in the paramagnetic\nstate.\n", "  The possibility of extending the Liouville Conformal Field Theory from values\nof the central charge $c \\geq 25$ to $c \\leq 1$ has been debated for many years\nin condensed matter physics as well as in string theory. It was only recently\nproven that such an extension -- involving a real spectrum of critical\nexponents as well as an analytic continuation of the DOZZ formula for\nthree-point couplings -- does give rise to a consistent theory. We show in this\nLetter that this theory can be interpreted in terms of microscopic loop models.\nWe introduce in particular a family of geometrical operators, and, using an\nefficient algorithm to compute three-point functions from the lattice, we show\nthat their operator algebra corresponds exactly to that of vertex operators\n$V_{\\hat{\\alpha}}$ in $c \\leq 1$ Liouville. We interpret geometrically the\nlimit $\\hat{\\alpha} \\to 0$ of $V_{\\hat{\\alpha}}$ and explain why it is not the\nidentity operator (despite having conformal weight $\\Delta=0$).\n", "  A novel scenario for the emergence of geometry in random multitrace matrix\nmodels of a single hermitian matrix $M$ with unitary $U(N) $ invariance, i.e.\nwithout a kinetic term, is presented. In particular, the dimension of the\nemergent geometry is determined from the critical exponents of the\ndisorder-to-uniform-ordered transition whereas the metric is determined from\nthe Wigner semicircle law behavior of the eigenvalues distribution of the\nmatrix $M$. If the uniform ordered phase is not sustained in the phase diagram\nthen there is no emergent geometry in the multitrace matrix model.\n", "  We report a direct and robust calculation, free from ergodic problems, of the\nnon-uniform-to-uniform (stripe) transition line of noncommutative $\\Phi^4_2$ by\nmeans of an exact Metropolis algorithm applied to the first non-trivial\nmultitrace correction of this theory on the fuzzy sphere. In fact, we\nreconstruct the entire phase diagram including the Ising, matrix and stripe\nboundaries together with the triple point. We also report that the measured\ncritical exponents of the Ising transition line agrees with the Onsager values\nin two dimensions. The triple point is identified as a termination point of the\none-cut-to-two-cut transition line and is located at\n$(\\tilde{b},\\tilde{c})=(-1.55,0.4)$ which compares favorably with previous\nMonte Carlo estimate.\n", "  We define a `hyperconductor' to be a material whose electrical and thermal DC\nconductivities are infinite at zero temperature and finite at any non-zero\ntemperature. The low-temperature behavior of a hyperconductor is controlled by\na quantum critical phase of interacting electrons that is stable to all\npotentially-gap-generating interactions and potentially-localizing disorder. In\nthis paper, we compute the low-temperature DC and AC electrical and thermal\nconductivities in a one-dimensional hyperconductor, studied previously by the\npresent authors, in the presence of both disorder and umklapp scattering. We\nidentify the conditions under which the transport coefficients are finite,\nwhich allows us to exhibit examples of violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law.\nThe temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, which is\ncharacterized by the parameter $\\Delta_X$, is a power law, $\\sigma \\propto\n1/T^{1 - 2(2-\\Delta_X)}$ when $\\Delta_X \\geq 2$, down to zero temperature when\nthe Fermi surface is commensurate with the lattice. There is a surface in\nparameter space along which $\\Delta_X = 2$ and $\\Delta_X \\approx 2$ for small\ndeviations from this surface. In the generic (incommensurate) case with weak\ndisorder, such scaling is seen at high-temperatures, followed by an exponential\nincrease of the conductivity $\\ln \\sigma \\sim 1/T$ at intermediate temperatures\nand, finally, $\\sigma \\propto 1/T^{2-2(2-{\\Delta_X})}$ at the lowest\ntemperatures. In both cases, the thermal conductivity diverges at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We derive a phenomenological no-lose theorem for naturalness up to the TeV\nscale, which applies when quantum corrections to the Higgs mass from top quarks\nare canceled by perturbative BSM particles (top partners) of similar\nmultiplicity due to to some symmetry. Null results from LHC searches already\nseem to disfavor such partners if they are colored. Any partners with SM\ncharges and ~TeV masses will be exhaustively probed by the LHC and a future 100\nTeV collider. Therefore, we focus on neutral top partners. While these arise in\nTwin Higgs theories, we analyze neutral top partners as model-independently as\npossible using EFT and Simplified Model methods. We classify all perturbative\nneutral top partner structures in order to compute their irreducible low-energy\nsignatures at proposed future lepton and hadron colliders, as well as the\nirreducible tunings suffered in each scenario. Central to our theorem is the\nassumption that SM-charged BSM states appear in the UV completion of neutral\nnaturalness, which is the case in all known examples. Direct production at the\n100 TeV collider then allows this scale to be probed at the ~10 TeV level. We\nfind that proposed future colliders probe any such scenario of naturalness with\ntuning of 10% or better. This provides very strong model-independent motivation\nfor both new lepton and hadron colliders, which in tandem act as discovery\nmachines for general naturalness. We put our results in context by discussing\nother possibilities for naturalness, including \"swarms\" of top partners,\ninherently non-perturbative or exotic physics, or theories without SM-charged\nstates in the UV completion. Realizing a concrete scenario which avoids our\narguments while still lacking experimental signatures remains an open\nmodel-building challenge.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy for parity-violating (time-reversal breaking)\nquantum field theories on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$ in the presence of a domain wall\nbetween two distinct parity-odd phases. The domain wall hosts a 1+1-dimensional\nconformal field theory (CFT) with non-trivial chiral central charge. Such a CFT\npossesses gravitational anomalies. It has been shown recently that, as a\nconsequence, its intrinsic entanglement entropy is sensitive to Lorentz boosts\naround the entangling surface. Here, we show using various methods that the\nentanglement entropy of the three-dimensional bulk theory is also sensitive to\nsuch boosts owing to parity-violating effects, and that the bulk response to a\nLorentz boost precisely cancels the contribution coming from the domain wall\nCFT. We argue that this can naturally be interpreted as entanglement inflow\n(i.e., inflow of entanglement entropy analogous to the familiar Callan-Harvey\neffect) between the bulk and the domain-wall, mediated by the low-lying states\nin the entanglement spectrum. These results can be generally applied to 2+1-d\ntopological phases of matter that have edge theories with gravitational\nanomalies, and provide a precise connection between the gravitational anomaly\nof the physical edge theory and the low-lying spectrum of the entanglement\nHamiltonian.\n", "  Controlling the properties of single photons is essential for a wide array of\nemerging optical quantum technologies spanning quantum sensing, quantum\ncomputing, and quantum communications. Essential components for these\ntechnologies include single photon sources, quantum memories, waveguides, and\ndetectors. The ideal spectral operating parameters (wavelength and bandwidth)\nof these components are rarely similar; thus, frequency conversion and spectral\ncontrol are key enabling steps for component hybridization. Here we perform\nsignal processing of single photons by coherently manipulating their spectra\nvia a modified quantum memory. We store 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm\nbandwidth, in a room-temperature diamond crystal; upon retrieval we demonstrate\ncentre frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth\nmodulation between 0.5 to 1.9 times the input bandwidth. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, to be an\nintegrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.\n", "  We study the performance of two measures of non-Markovianity in detecting\nmemory effects in two-qubit dephasing channels. By combining independent\nMarkovian and non-Markovian noise on the qubits, our results show that the\ntrace distance measure is able to detect the memory effects when at least one\nof the local channels displays non-Markovianity. A measure based on channel\ncapacity, in turn, becomes non-zero when the global two-qubit dynamics shows\nmemory effects. We apply these schemes to a well-known superdense coding\nprotocol and demonstrate an optimal noise configuration to maximize the\ninformation transmission with independent local noises.\n", "  In metric-affine theories of gravity such as the C-theories, the spacetime\nconnection is associated to a metric that is nontrivially related to the\nphysical metric. In this article, such theories are rewritten in terms of a\nsingle metric and it is shown that they can be recast as effectively nonlocal\ngravity. With some assumptions, known ghost-free theories with non-singular and\ncosmologically interesting properties may be recovered. Relations between\ndifferent formulations are analysed at both perturbative and nonperturbative\nlevels taking carefully into account subtleties with boundary conditions in the\npresence of integral operators in the action, and equivalences between theories\nrelated by nonlocal redefinitions of the fields are verified at the level of\nequations of motion. This suggests a possible geometrical interpretation of\nnonlocal gravity as an emergent property of non-Riemannian spacetime structure.\n", "  Amplitude models are applied to studies of resonance structure in $D^0\\to\nK^0_S K^- \\pi^+$ and $D^0\\to K^0_S K^+ \\pi^-$ decays using $pp$ collision data\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected\nby the LHCb experiment. Relative magnitude and phase information is determined,\nand coherence factors and related observables are computed for both the whole\nphase space and a restricted region of $100\\,\\mathrm{MeV/}c^2$ around the\n$K^{*}(892)^{\\pm}$ resonance. Two formulations for the $K\\pi$ $S$-wave are\nused, both of which give a good description of the data. The ratio of branching\nfractions $\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\to K^0_S K^+ \\pi^-)/\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\to K^0_S K^-\n\\pi^+)$ is measured to be\n$0.655\\pm0.004\\,(\\textrm{stat})\\pm0.006\\,(\\textrm{syst})$ over the full phase\nspace and $0.370\\pm0.003\\, (\\textrm{stat})\\pm0.012\\,(\\textrm{syst})$ in the\nrestricted region. A search for $CP$ violation is performed using the amplitude\nmodels and no significant effect is found. Predictions from $SU(3)$ flavor\nsymmetry for $K^{*}(892)K$ amplitudes of different charges are compared with\nthe amplitude model results.\n", "  We study topological insulators, regarded as physical systems giving rise to\ntopological invariants determined by symmetries both linear and anti-linear.\nOur perspective is that of noncommutative index theory of operator algebras. In\nparticular we formulate the index problems using Kasparov theory, both complex\nand real. We show that the periodic table of topological insulators and\nsuperconductors can be realised as a real or complex index pairing of a\nKasparov module capturing internal symmetries of the Hamiltonian with a\nspectral triple encoding the geometry of the sample's (possibly noncommutative)\nBrillouin zone.\n", "  Coronal jets are collimated, dynamic events that occur over a broad range of\nspatial scales in the solar corona. In the open magnetic field of coronal\nholes, jets form quasi-radial spires that can extend far out into the\nheliosphere, while in closed-field regions the jet outflows are confined to the\ncorona. We explore the application of the embedded-bipole model to jets\noccurring in closed coronal loops. In this model, magnetic free energy is\ninjected slowly by footpoint motions that introduce twist within the closed\ndome of the jet source region, and is released rapidly by the onset of an ideal\nkink-like instability. Two length scales characterize the system: the width (N)\nof the jet source region and the footpoint separation (L) of the coronal loop\nthat envelops the jet source. We find that the jet characteristics are highly\nsensitive to the ratio L/N, in both the conditions for initiation and the\nsubsequent dynamics. The longest-lasting and most energetic jets occur along\nlong coronal loops with large L/N ratios, and share many features of open-field\njets, while smaller L/N ratios produce shorter-duration, less energetic jets\nthat are affected by reflections from the far-loop footpoint. We quantify the\ntransition between these behaviours and show that our model replicates key\nqualitative and quantitative aspects of both quiet-Sun and active-region loop\njets. We also find that the reconnection between the closed dome and\nsurrounding coronal loop is very extensive: the cumulative reconnected flux at\nleast matches the total flux beneath the dome for small L/N, and is more than\ndouble that value for large L/N.\n", "  Motivated by cold atom experiments on Chern insulators, we study the\nhoneycomb lattice Haldane-Hubbard Mott insulator of spin-$1/2$ fermions using\nexact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. We show\nthat this model exhibits various chiral magnetic orders including a wide regime\nof triple-Q tetrahedral order. Incorporating third-neighbor hopping frustrates\nand ultimately melts this tetrahedral spin crystal. From analyzing low energy\nspectra, many-body Chern numbers, entanglement spectra, and modular matrices,\nwe identify the molten state as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) with gapped semion\nexcitations. We formulate and study the Chern-Simons-Higgs field theory of the\nexotic CSL-to-tetrahedral spin crystallization transition.\n", "  A natural solution to the hierarchy problem of the Fermi scale motivates\nsignals of New Physics at current and near future experiments. After a critical\nsynthesis of this general motivation, we concentrate our attention on the\ninterplay between LHC searches for new resonances, and precision measurements\nof both Higgs couplings and flavour violating observables. We do so for i) the\nHiggs sectors of the NMSSM and MSSM, as paradigmatic examples of theories\nproviding extra scalars, and for ii) CKM-like flavour symmetries, with a focus\non U(2)^3. This article is mainly based on several papers by the author, but it\nalso reviews other recent related results. Its goal is to provide a synthetic -\nyet comprehensive orientation on these subjects, at the dawn of several (ATLAS\nand CMS, LHCb, NA62 etc.) coming experimental results.\n", "  The COHERENT collaboration's primary objective is to measure coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) using the unique, high-quality source of\ntens-of-MeV neutrinos provided by the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak\nRidge National Laboratory (ORNL). In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It\nis relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables\nvalidation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased\napproach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact\ngermanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection\nchamber. Following an extensive background measurement campaign, a location in\nthe SNS basement has proven to be neutron-quiet and suitable for deployment of\nthe COHERENT detector suite. The simultaneous deployment of the three COHERENT\ndetector subsystems will test the $N^2$ dependence of the cross section and\nensure an unambiguous discovery of CEvNS. This document describes concisely the\nCOHERENT physics motivations, sensitivity and plans for measurements at the SNS\nto be accomplished on a four-year timescale.\n", "  We propose a setup based on two coupled quantum dots where thermodynamics of\na measurement can be quantitatively characterized. The information obtained in\nthe measurement can be utilized by performing feedback in a manner apparently\nbreaking the second law of thermodynamics. In this way the setup can be\noperated as a Maxwell's Demon where both the measurement and feedback are\nperformed separately by controlling an external parameter. This is analogous to\nthe case of the original Szilard engine. Since the setup contains both the\nmicroscopic demon and the engine itself, the operation of the whole\nmeasurement-feedback cycle can be explained in detail at the level of single\nrealizations. In addition, we derive integral fluctuation relations for both\nthe bare and coarse-grained entropy productions in the setup.\n", "  Updated standard model predictions for $D_{(s)} \\to P l^+ l^-$, $l=e,\\mu$,\n$P=\\pi,K$ and inclusive decays are presented. Model-independent constraints on\n$|\\Delta C|=|\\Delta U|=1$ Wilson coefficients are worked out. New physics (NP)\nopportunities arise in semileptonic branching ratios for very large couplings\nonly, however, are not excluded outside the resonance regions yet. The NP\npotential of resonance-assisted CP asymmetries and angular observables is\nworked out. Predictions are given for leptoquark models, and include lepton\nflavor violating and dineutrino decays. Whether NP can be seen depends on\nflavor patterns, and vice versa.\n", "  We introduce new algebro-topological invariants of directed networks, based\non the topological construction of the directed clique complex. The shape of\nthe underlying directed graph is encoded in a way that can be studied\nmathematically to obtain network invariants such as the Euler characteristic\nand the Betti numbers. Two different cases illustrate the application of the\nEuler characteristic. We investigate how the evolution of a Boolean recurrent\nartificial neural network is influenced by its topology in a dynamics involving\npruning and strengthening of the connections, and to show that the topological\nfeatures of the directed clique complex influence the dynamical evolution of\nthe network. The second application considers the directed clique complex in a\nbroader framework, to define an invariant of directed networks, the network\ndegree invariant, which is constructed by computing the topological invariant\non a sequence of sub-networks filtered by the minimum in- or out-degree of the\nnodes. The application of the Euler characteristic presented here can be\nextended to any directed network and provides a new method for the assessment\nof specific functional features associated with the network topology.\n", "  A prototype detection unit of the KM3NeT deep-sea neutrino telescope has been\ninstalled at 3500m depth 80km offshore the Italian coast. KM3NeT in its final\nconfiguration will contain several hundreds of detection units. Each detection\nunit is a mechanical structure anchored to the sea floor, held vertical by a\nsubmerged buoy and supporting optical modules for the detection of Cherenkov\nlight emitted by charged secondary particles emerging from neutrino\ninteractions. This prototype string implements three optical modules with 31\nphotomultiplier tubes each. These optical modules were developed by the KM3NeT\nCollaboration to enhance the detection capability of neutrino interactions. The\nprototype detection unit was operated since its deployment in May 2014 until\nits decommissioning in July 2015. Reconstruction of the particle trajectories\nfrom the data requires a nanosecond accuracy in the time calibration. A\nprocedure for relative time calibration of the photomultiplier tubes contained\nin each optical module is described. This procedure is based on the measured\ncoincidences produced in the sea by the 40K background light and can easily be\nexpanded to a detector with several thousands of optical modules. The time\noffsets between the different optical modules are obtained using LED\nnanobeacons mounted inside them. A set of data corresponding to 600 hours of\nlivetime was analysed. The results show good agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the expected optical background and the signal from atmospheric\nmuons. An almost background-free sample of muons was selected by filtering the\ntime correlated signals on all the three optical modules. The zenith angle of\nthe selected muons was reconstructed with a precision of about 3{\\deg}.\n", "  Semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures represent a promising platform\nfor the detection of Majorana zero modes and subsequently the processing of\nquantum information using their exotic non-Abelian statistics. Theoretical\nmodeling of such low-dimensional semiconductors is generally based on\nphenomenological effective models. However, a more microscopic understanding of\ntheir band structure and, especially, of the spin-orbit coupling of electrons\nin these devices is important for optimizing their parameters for applications\nin quantum computing. In this paper, we approach this problem by first\nobtaining a highly accurate effective tight-binding model from ab initio\ncalculations in the bulk. This model is symmetrized and correctly reproduces\nboth the band structure and the wavefunction character. It is then used to\ndetermine Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit splittings induced by finite size\neffects and external electric field in zincblende InSb one- and two-dimensional\nnanostructures as a function of growth parameters. The method presented here\nenables reliable simulations of realistic devices, including those used to\nrealize exotic topological states.\n", "  Quantum walks behave differently from what we expect and their probability\ndistributions have unique structures. They have localization, singularities, a\ngap, and so on. Those features have been discovered from the view point of\nmathematics and reported as limit theorems. In this paper we focus on a\ntime-dependent three-state quantum walk on the line and demonstrate a limit\ndistribution. Three coin states at each position are iteratively updated by a\ncoin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. As the result of the\nevolution, we end up to observe both localization and a gap in the limit\ndistribution.\n", "  The non-observation of new particles at the LHC suggests the existence of a\nmass gap above the electroweak scale. This situation is adequately described\nthrough a general electroweak effective theory with the established fields and\nStandard Model symmetries. Its couplings contain all information about the\nunknown short-distance dynamics which is accessible at low energies. We\nconsider a generic strongly-coupled scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking,\nwith heavy states above the gap, and analyze the imprints that its lightest\nbosonic excitations leave on the effective Lagrangian couplings. Different\nquantum numbers of the heavy states imply different patterns of low-energy\ncouplings, with characteristic correlations which could be identified in future\ndata samples. The predictions can be sharpened with mild assumptions about the\nultraviolet behaviour of the underlying fundamental theory.\n", "  We study the stationary Josephson current in a junction between a topological\nand an ordinary (topologically trivial) superconductor. Such an S-TS junction\nhosts a Majorana zero mode that significantly influences the current-phase\nrelation. The presence of the Majorana state is intimately related with the\nbreaking of the time-reversal symmetry in the system. We derive a general\nexpression for the supercurrent for a class of short topological junctions in\nterms of the normal state scattering matrix. The result is strongly asymmetric\nwith respect to the superconducting gaps in the ordinary ($\\Delta_0$) and\ntopological ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{top}}$) leads. We apply the general result to a\nsimple model of a nanowire setup with strong spin-orbit coupling in an external\nmagnetic field and proximity-induced superconductivity. The system shows\nparametrically strong suppression of the critical current $I_c \\propto\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{top}}/R_N^2$ in the tunneling limit ($R_N$ is the normal state\nresistance). This is in strong contrast with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation\napplicable to junctions with preserved time-reversal symmetry. We also consider\nthe case of a generic junction with a random scattering matrix and obtain a\nmore conventional scaling law $I_c \\propto \\Delta_{\\mathrm{top}}/R_N$.\n", "  In this paper we consider narrow band, active array imaging of weak localized\nscatterers when only the intensities are recorded at an array with N\ntransducers. We consider that the medium is homogeneous and, hence, wave\npropagation is fully coherent. This work is an extension of our previous paper,\nwhere we showed that using linear combinations of intensity-only measurements\nimaging of localized scatterers can be carried out efficiently using MUSIC or\nsparsity promoting optimization. Here we show the same strategy can be\naccomplished with only 3N-2 illuminations, therefore reducing enormously the\ndata acquisition process. Furthermore, we show that in the paraxial regime one\ncan form the images by using six illuminations only. In particular, this\nparaxial regime includes Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. The key point of\nthis work is that if one controls the illuminations, imaging with\nintensity-only can be easily reduced to a imaging with phases and, therefore,\none can apply standard imaging techniques. Detailed numerical simulations\nillustrate the performance of the proposed imaging strategy with and without\ndata noise.\n", "  We consider a two level system with both a transversal and a longitudinal\ncoupling to the electromagnetic field of a resonator. Using a polaron\ntransformation, this Hamiltonian can be mapped onto a Jaynes-Cummings\nHamiltonian with generalized field operators acting on the electromagnetic\nfield in the resonator. In contrast to the usual ladder operators $a$ and\n$a^\\dagger$, these operators exhibit a non-monotous coupling strength with\nrespect to the number $n$ of photons in the resonator. Especially, there are\nroots of the coupling between qubit and resonator at certain photon numbers\n$n_0$. We show, that this effect can be exploited to generate photon-number\nsqueezed light, characterized by a Fano factor $F \\ll 1$, with a large number\nof photons (e.g. of the order of $10^4$).\n", "  The even-even nucleus $^{26}$Mg has been studied through the reaction\n$^{27}$Al(d,$^{3}$He) at 25 MeV beam energy. The spectroscopic factors have\nbeen extracted upto 7.50 MeV excitation energy using local, zero range\ndistorted wave Born approximation. The comparison of the spectroscopic factors\nhave been done with previously reported values using the same reaction probe.\nThe extracted spectroscopic factors for different excited states were found to\nbe in good agreement with the previously reported values for the same. The\npresent results were also compared with the predictions from shell model as\nwell as rotational model. The analog states of $^{26}$Al and $^{26}$Mg were\nfound to be in good agreement.\n", "  By harnessing quantum effects, we nowadays can use encryption that is in\nprinciple proven to withstand any conceivable attack. These fascinating quantum\nfeatures have been implemented in metropolitan quantum networks around the\nworld. In order to interconnect such networks over long distances, optical\nsatellite communication is the method of choice. Standard telecommunication\ncomponents allow one to efficiently implement quantum communication by\nmeasuring field quadratures (continuous variables). This opens the possibility\nto adapt our Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) to quantum key distribution\n(QKD). First satellite measurement campaigns are currently validating our\napproach.\n", "  We compare evolutionary predictions of double compact object merger rate\ndensities with initial and forthcoming LIGO/Virgo upper limits. We find that:\n(i) Due to the cosmological reach of advanced detectors, current conversion\nmethods of population synthesis predictions into merger rate densities are\ninsufficient. (ii) Our optimistic models are a factor of 18 below the initial\nLIGO/Virgo upper limits for BH-BH systems, indicating that a modest increase in\nobservational sensitivity (by a factor of 2.5) may bring the first detections\nor first gravitational wave constraints on binary evolution. (iii)\nStellar-origin massive BH-BH mergers should dominate event rates in advanced\nLIGO/Virgo and can be detected out to redshift z=2 with templates including\ninspiral, merger, and ringdown. Normal stars (<150 Msun) can produce such\nmergers with total redshifted mass up to 400 Msun. (iv) High black hole natal\nkicks can severely limit the formation of massive BH-BH systems (both in\nisolated binary and in dynamical dense cluster evolution), and thus would\neliminate detection of these systems even at full advanced LIGO/Virgo\nsensitivity. We find that low and high black hole natal kicks are allowed by\ncurrent observational electromagnetic constraints. (v) The majority of our\nmodels yield detections of all types of mergers (NS-NS, BH-NS, BH-BH) with\nadvanced detectors. Numerous massive BH-BH merger detections will indicate\nsmall (if any) natal kicks for massive BHs.\n", "  Topological mechanical structures exhibit robust properties protected by\ntopological invariants. In this letter, we study a family of deformed square\nlattices that display topologically protected zero-energy bulk modes analogous\nto the massless fermion modes of Weyl semimetals. Our findings apply to\nsufficiently complex lattices satisfying the Maxwell criterion of equal numbers\nof constraints and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that such systems exhibit\npairs of oppositely charged Weyl points, corresponding to zero-frequency bulk\nmodes, that can appear at the origin of the Brillouin zone and move away to the\nzone edge (or return to the origin) where they annihilate. We prove that the\nexistence of these Weyl points leads to a wavenumber-dependent count of\ntopological mechanical states at free surfaces and domain walls.\n", "  We study an effective model of two interacting species of bosons in two\ndimensions, which is amenable to sign problem free Monte Carlo simulations. In\naddition to conventional ground states, we access a paired superfluid which is\nalso a topological phase, protected by the remaining $U(1) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry. This phase arises from the condensation of a composite object, the\nbound state of vortices and anti-vortices of one species, to a boson of the\nsecond species. We introduce a bulk response function, the Ising analog of the\nquantized Hall effect, to diagnose the topological phase. The interplay of\nbroken symmetry and topology leads to interesting effects such as fractionally\ncharged vortices in the paired superfluid. Possible extensions towards\nrealistic models of cold atomic bosons are discussed.\n", "  We present predictions for the surface density of ultracool dwarfs (with\nspectral types M8-T8) for a host of deep fields that are likely to be observed\nwith the James Webb Space Telescope. Based on simple thin and thick/thin disk\n(exponential) models, we show the typical distance modulus is mu~9.8 mag, which\nat high Galactic latitude is 5log(2 z_scl)-5. Since this is a property of the\ndensity distribution of an exponential disk, it is independent of spectral type\nor stellar sample. Using the published estimates of the ultracool dwarf\nluminosity function, we show that their number counts typically peak around\nJ~24 mag with a total surface density of Sigma ~ 0.3 arcmin^-2, but with a\nstrong dependence on galactic coordinate and spectral type. Owing to the\nexponential shape of the disk, the ultracool dwarfs are very rare at faint\nmagnitudes (J>~27 mag), with typical densities of Sigma~0.005 arcmin^-2 (or\n~20% of the total contribution within the field). Therefore in the very narrow\nand deep fields, we predict there are only a few ultracool dwarfs, and hence\nthese stars are likely not a severe contaminant in searches for high-redshift\ngalaxies. Furthermore the ultracool dwarfs are expected to be considerably\nbrighter than the high-redshift galaxies, so samples near the faint-end of the\nhigh-redshift galaxy population will be the purest. We present the star-count\nformalism in a simplified way so that observers may easily predict the number\nof stars for their conditions (field, depth, wavelength, etc.).\n", "  We present results from high-resolution semi-global simulations of\nneutrino-driven convection in core-collapse supernovae. We employ an idealized\nsetup with parametrized neutrino heating/cooling and nuclear dissociation at\nthe shock front. We study the internal dynamics of neutrino-driven convection\nand its role in re-distributing energy and momentum through the gain region. We\nfind that even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up to the\nshock, convection is not able to create a net positive energy flux and overcome\nthe downwards transport of energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection\ndoes, however, provide a significant effective pressure support to the\naccretion flow as it favors the accumulation of energy, mass and momentum in\nthe gain region. We derive an approximate equation that is able to explain and\npredict the shock evolution in terms of integrals of quantities such as the\nturbulent pressure in the gain region or the effects of non-radial motion of\nthe fluid. We use this relation as a way to quantify the role of turbulence in\nthe dynamics of the accretion shock. Finally, we investigate the effects of\ngrid resolution, which we change by a factor 20 between the lowest and highest\nresolution. Our results show that the shallow slopes of the turbulent kinetic\nenergy spectra reported in previous studies are a numerical artefact.\nKolmogorov scaling is progressively recovered as the resolution is increased.\n", "  Using a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic general circulation model, we\ninvestigate the response of the thermosphere-ionosphere system to the 5-6\nAugust 2011 major geomagnetic storm. The model is driven by measured storm-time\ninput data of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF), solar activity, and\nauroral activity. Simulations for quiet steady conditions over the same period\nare performed as well in order to assess the response of the neutral and plasma\nparameters to the storm. During the storm, the high-latitude mean ion flows are\nenhanced by up to 150-180%. Largest ion flows are found in the main phase of\nthe storm. Overall, the global mean neutral temperature increases by up to 15%,\nwhile the maximum thermal response is higher in the winter Southern Hemisphere\nat high-latitudes than the summer Northern Hemisphere: 40% vs. 20%increase in\nhigh-latitude mean temperature, respectively. The global mean Joule heating\nincreases by more than a factor of three. There are distinct hemispheric\ndifferences in the magnitude and morphology of the horizontal ion flows and\nthermospheric flows during the different phases of the storm. The largest\nhemispheric difference in the thermospheric circulation is found during the\nmain and recovery phases of the storm, demonstrating appreciable geographical\nvariations. The advective forcing is found to contribute to the modeled\nhemispheric differences.\n", "  Quasi--stellar objects (quasars) located behind nearby galaxies provide an\nexcellent absolute reference system for astrometric studies, but they are\ndifficult to identify because of fore- and background contamination. Deep\nwide--field, high angular resolution surveys spanning the entire area of nearby\ngalaxies are needed to obtain a complete census of such quasars. We embarked on\na program to expand the quasar reference system behind the Large and the Small\nMagellanic Clouds, the Magellanic Bridge, and the Magellanic Stream, connecting\nthe Clouds with the Milky Way. Hundreds of quasar candidates were selected\nbased on their near--infrared colors and variability properties from the\nongoing public ESO VISTA Magellanic Clouds survey. A subset of 49 objects was\nfollowed up with optical spectroscopy. We confirmed the quasar nature of 37\nobjects (34 new identifications), four are low redshift objects, three are\nprobably stars, and the remaining three lack prominent spectral features for a\nsecure classification; bona fide quasars, judging from their broad absorption\nlines are located, as follows: 10 behind the LMC, 13 behind the SMC, and 14\nbehind the Bridge. The quasars span a redshift range from z~0.5 to z~4.1. Upon\ncompletion the VMC survey is expected to yield a total of ~1500 quasars with\nY<19.32 mag, J<19.09 mag, and Ks<18.04 mag.\n", "  The first two successful predictions for amorphous solid experiments by\ntunneling-two-level-system (TTLS) was phonon echo and saturation phenomena. In\nthis paper by generalizing TTLS to infinite-level-system model with certain\nrandomness and nonlinearity, we prove that phonon echo is a stimulated emission\nprocess. The classical infinite-level-system (taking $\\hbar\\to 0$ limit) cannot\nfind saturation effect, while quantum infinite-level-system can find it with\ncertain nonlinearity assumed. We also prove that without randomness or\nnonlinearity neither phonon echo nor saturation exists in arbitrary\ninfinite-level-system.\n", "  YPtBi, a topological semimetal with very low carrier density, was recently\nfound to be superconducting below $T_\\mathrm{c} = 0.77$\\,K. In the conventional\ntheory, the nearly vanishing density of states around the Fermi level would\nimply a vanishing electron-phonon coupling and would therefore not allow for\nsuperconductivity. Based on relativistic density functional theory calculations\nof the electron-phonon coupling in YPtBi it is found that carrier\nconcentrations of more than $10^{21}$\\,cm$^{-3}$ are required to explain the\nobserved critical temperature with the conventional pairing mechanism, which is\nseveral orders of magnitude larger than experimentally observed. It is very\nlikely that an unconventional pairing mechanism is responsible for the\nsuperconductivity in YPtBi and related topological semimetals with the\nHalf-Heusler structure.\n", "  We have recently highlighted the presence of a periodically oscillating 10 \\%\nmodulation in the BABAR data on the proton timelike form factors, in the\nreaction $e^++e^-$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\bar{p}+p$. Here we deepen our previous data\nanalysis, and confirm that in the case of several standard parametrizations it\nis possible to write the form factor in the form $F_0$ $+$ $F_{osc}$, where\n$F_0$ is a parametrization expressing the long-range trend of the form factor\n(for $q^2$ ranging from the $\\bar{p}p$ threshold to 36 GeV$^2$), and $F_{osc}$\nis a function of the form $\\exp(-Bp)\\cos(Cp)$, where $p$ is the relative\nmomentum of the final $\\bar{p}p$ pair. Error bars allow for a clean\nidentification of the main features of this modulation for $q^2$ $<$ 10\nGeV$^2$. Assuming this oscillatory modulation to be an effect of final state\ninteractions between the forming proton and the antiproton, we propose a\nphenomenological model based on a double-layer imaginary optical potential.\nThis potential is flux-absorbing when the distance between the proton and\nantiproton centers of mass is $\\gtrsim$ 1.7-1.8 fm and flux-generating when it\nis $\\lesssim$ 1.7-1.8 fm. The main features of the oscillations may be\nreproduced with some freedom in the potential parameters, but the transition\nbetween the two layers must be sudden (0-0.2 fm) to get the correct oscillation\nperiod. The flux-absorbing part of the $\\bar{p}p$ interaction is due to the\nannihilation of $\\bar{p}p$ pairs into multi-meson states. We interpret the\nflux-creating part of the potential as due to the creation of a $1/q$-ranged\nstate when the virtual photon decays into a set of current quarks and\nantiquarks, including heavy ones, that may exist for a short time. The decay of\nthese large mass states leads to an intermediate stage regeneration of the\n$\\bar{p}p$ channel.\n", "  The search for continuous gravitational waves in a wide parameter space at\nfixed computing cost is most efficiently done with semicoherent methods, e.g.\nStackSlide, due to the prohibitive computing cost of the fully coherent search\nstrategies. Prix&Shaltev arXiv:1201.4321 have developed a semi-analytic method\nfor finding \\emph{optimal} StackSlide parameters at fixed computing cost under\nideal data conditions, i.e. gap-less data and constant noise floor. In this\nwork we consider more realistic conditions by allowing for gaps in the data and\nchanges in noise level. We show how the sensitivity optimization can be\ndecoupled from the data selection problem. To find optimal semicoherent search\nparameters we apply a numerical optimization using as example the semicoherent\nStackSlide search. We also describe three different data selection algorithms.\nThus the outcome of the numerical optimization consists of the optimal search\nparameters and the selected dataset. We first test the numerical optimization\nprocedure under ideal conditions and show that we can reproduce the results of\nthe analytical method. Then we gradually relax the conditions on the data and\nfind that a compact data selection algorithm yields higher sensitivity compared\nto a greedy data selection procedure.\n", "  We study a general class of PT-symmetric tridiagonal Hamiltonians with purely\nimaginary interaction terms in the quasi-hermitian representation of quantum\nmechanics. Our general Hamiltonian encompasses many previously studied lattice\nmodels as special cases. We provide numerical results regarding domains of\nobservability and exceptional points, and discuss the possibility of explicit\nconstruction of general metric operators (which in turn determine all the\nphysical Hilbert spaces). The condition of computational simplicity for the\nmetrics motivates the introduction of certain one-parametric special cases,\nwhich consequently admit closed-form extrapolation patterns of the\nlow-dimensional results.\n", "  Ethane is expected to be the dominant photochemical product on Titan's\nsurface and, in the absence of a process that sequesters it from exposed\nsurface reservoirs, a major constituent of its lakes and seas. Absorption of\nCassini's 2.2 cm radar by Ligeia Mare however suggests that this north polar\nsea is dominated by methane. In order to explain this apparent ethane\ndeficiency, we explore the possibility that Ligeia Mare is the visible part of\nan alkanofer that interacted with an underlying clathrate layer and investigate\nthe influence of this interaction on an assumed initial ethane-methane mixture\nin the liquid phase. We find that progressive liquid entrapment in clathrate\nallows the surface liquid reservoir to become methane-dominated for any initial\nethane mole fraction below 0.75. If interactions between alkanofers and\nclathrates are common on Titan, this should lead to the emergence of many\nmethane-dominated seas or lakes.\n", "  We present the overall conductance as well as the circulating currents in\nindividual loops of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) as we apply bias voltage via the\nside attached electrodes. SPG being a self-similar structure, its manifestation\non loop currents and magnetic fields are examined in various generations of\nthis fractal and it has been observed that for a given configuration of the\nelectrodes, the physical quantities exhibit certain regularity as we go from\none generation to another. Also a notable feature is the introduction of\nanisotropy in hopping causes an increase in magnitude of overall transport\ncurrent. These features are a subject of interest in this article.\n", "  Negative compressibility generated by many-body effects in 2D electronic\nsystems can enhance gate capacitance. We observe capacitance enhancement in a\nnewly emerged 2D layered material, atomically thin black phosphorus (BP). The\nencapsulation of BP by hexagonal boron nitride sheets with few-layer graphene\nas a terminal ensures ultraclean heterostructure interfaces, allowing us to\nobserve negative compressibility at low hole carrier concentrations. We\nexplained the negative compressibility based on the Coulomb correlation among\nin-plane charges and their image charges in a gate electrode in the framework\nof Debye screening.\n", "  We study a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with multiple seeds on a\nregular random graph. Many researchers have studied the epidemic threshold of\nepidemic models above which a global outbreak can occur, starting from an\ninfinitesimal fraction of seeds. However, there have been few studies of\nepidemic models with finite fractions of seeds. The aim of this paper is to\nclarify what happens in phase transitions in such cases. The SIR model in\nnetworks exhibits two percolation transitions. We derive the percolation\ntransition points for the SIR model with multiple seeds to show that as the\ninfection rate increases epidemic clusters generated from each seed percolate\nbefore a single seed can induce a global outbreak.\n", "  Link failures repeatedly induce large-scale outages in power grids and other\nsupply networks. Yet, it is still not well understood, which links are\nparticularly prone to inducing such outages. Here we analyze how the nature and\nlocation of each link impact the network's capability to maintain stable\nsupply. We propose two criteria to identify critical links on the basis of the\ntopology and the load distribution of the network prior to link failure. They\nare determined via a link's redundant capacity and a renormalized linear\nresponse theory we derive. These criteria outperform critical link prediction\nbased on local measures such as loads. The results not only further our\nunderstanding of the physics of supply networks in general. As both criteria\nare available before any outage from the state of normal operation, they may\nalso help real-time monitoring of grid operation, employing counter-measures\nand support network planning and design.\n", "  Quantum repeater holds the promise for scalable long-distance quantum\ncommunication. Towards a first quantum repeater based on memory-photon\nentanglement, significant progresses have made in improving performances of the\nbuilding blocks. Further development is hindered by the difficulty of\nintegrating key capabilities such as long storage time and high memory\nefficiency into a single system. Here we report an efficient light-matter\ninterface with sub-second lifetime by confining laser-cooled atoms with 3D\noptical lattice and enhancing the atom-photon coupling with a ring cavity. An\ninitial retrieval efficiency of 76(5)% together with an 1/e lifetime of 0.22(1)\ns have been achieved simultaneously, which already support sub-Hz entanglement\ndistribution up to 1000 km through quantum repeater. Together with an efficient\ntelecom interface and moderate multiplexing, our result may enable a first\nquantum repeater system that beats direct transmission in the near future.\n", "  The current uncertainty on the gluon density extracted from the global parton\nanalysis is large in the kinematical range of small values of the Bjorken - $x$\nvariable and low values of the hard scale $Q^2$. An alternative to reduces this\nuncertainty is the analysis of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction in\nphoton - hadron and hadron - hadron collisions. This process offers a unique\nopportunity to constrain the gluon density of the proton, since its cross\nsection is proportional to the gluon density squared. In this paper we consider\ncurrent parametrizations for the gluon distribution and estimate the exclusive\nvector meson photoproduction cross section at HERA and LHC using the leading\nlogarithmic formalism. We perform a fit of the normalization of the $\\gamma h$\ncross section and the value of the hard scale for the process and demonstrate\nthat the current LHCb experimental data are better described by models that\nassume a slow increasing of the gluon distribution at small - $x$ and low\n$Q^2$.\n", "  The non-Gaussian normal diffusion, i.e., the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) is non-Gaussian but the mean squared displacement (MSD) depends\non time linearly, has been observed in particle motions. Here we show by\nnumerical simulations that this phenomenon may manifest in energy diffusion\nalong lattices at a non-zero, finite temperature. The model we study is\none-dimensional disordered lattices with on-site potential. We find that the\nenergy-density fluctuations are spatially localized if the nonlinear\ninteraction is suppressed, but may relax with a non-Gaussian PDF and a linear\ntime-dependent MSD when the nonlinear interaction is turned on. Our analysis\nsuggests that the mechanism lies in the delocalization properties of the\nlocalized modes.\n", "  We study some properties of the canonical transformations in classical\nmechanics and quantum field theory and give a number of practical formulas\nconcerning their generating functions. First, we give a diagrammatic formula\nfor the perturbative expansion of the composition law around the identity map.\nThen, we propose a standard way to express the generating function of a\ncanonical transformation by means of a certain \"componential\" map, which obeys\nthe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We derive the diagrammatic interpretation\nof the componential map, work out its relation with the solution of the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation and derive its time-ordered version. Finally, we\ngeneralize the results to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, where the conjugate\nvariables may have both bosonic and fermionic statistics, and describe\napplications to quantum field theory.\n", "  Progress in the emergent field of topological superconductivity relies on\nsynthesis of new material combinations, combining superconductivity, low\ndensity, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For example, theory [1-4] indicates\nthat the interface between a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor (Sm) with\nstrong SOC and a superconductor (S) hosts Majorana modes with nontrivial\ntopological properties [5-8]. Recently, epitaxial growth of Al on InAs\nnanowires was shown to yield a high quality S-Sm system with uniformly\ntransparent interfaces [9] and a hard induced gap, indicted by strongly\nsuppressed sub gap tunneling conductance [10]. Here we report the realization\nof a two-dimensional (2D) InAs/InGaAs heterostructure with epitaxial Al,\nyielding a planar S-Sm system with structural and transport characteristics as\ngood as the epitaxial wires. The realization of 2D epitaxial S-Sm systems\nrepresent a significant advance over wires, allowing extended networks via\ntop-down processing. Among numerous potential applications, this new material\nsystem can serve as a platform for complex networks of topological\nsuperconductors with gate-controlled Majorana zero modes [1-4]. We demonstrate\ngateable Josephson junctions and a highly transparent 2D S-Sm interface based\non the product of excess current and normal state resistance.\n", "  Using the background field method and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we\nprove a key theorem on the cohomology of perturbatively local functionals of\narbitrary ghost numbers, in renormalizable and nonrenormalizable quantum field\ntheories whose gauge symmetries are general covariance, local Lorentz symmetry,\nnon-Abelian Yang-Mills symmetries and Abelian gauge symmetries. Interpolating\nbetween the background field approach and the usual, nonbackground approach by\nmeans of a canonical transformation, we take advantage of the properties of\nboth approaches and prove that a closed functional is the sum of an exact\nfunctional plus a functional that depends only on the physical fields and\npossibly the ghosts. The assumptions of the theorem are the mathematical\nversions of general properties that characterize the counterterms and the local\ncontributions to the potential anomalies. This makes the outcome a theorem on\nthe cohomology of renormalization, rather than the whole local cohomology. The\nresult supersedes numerous involved arguments that are available in the\nliterature.\n", "  We use compatibility of the second fundamental form corrections to DBI action\nat order $\\alpha'^2$ which includes trace of the second fundamental form, with\nT-duality and with the linear S-duality as guiding principles to find an\noff-shell D-brane action at order $\\alpha'^2$ in type II superstring theories\nin flat spcetime.\n", "  We report a new detection of neutral deuterium in the sub Damped Lyman Alpha\nsystem with low metallicity [O/H]\\,=\\,$-2.042 \\pm 0.005$ at $z_{\\rm abs}=2.437$\ntowards QSO~J\\,1444$+$2919. The hydrogen column density in this system is\nlog$N$(H\\,{\\sc i})~$=19.983\\pm0.010$ and the measured value of deuterium\nabundance is log(D/H)~$=-4.706\\pm0.007_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.067_{\\rm syst}$. This\nsystem meets the set of strict selection criteria stated recently by Cooke et\nal. and, therefore, widens the {\\it Precision Sample} of D/H. However, possible\nunderestimation of systematic errors can bring bias into the mean D/H value\n(especially if use a weighted mean). Hence, it might be reasonable to relax\nthese selection criteria and, thus, increase the number of acceptable\nabsorption systems with measured D/H values. In addition, an unweighted mean\nvalue might be more appropriate to describe the primordial deuterium abundance.\nThe unweighted mean value of the whole D/H data sample available to date (15\nmeasurements) gives a conservative value of the primordial deuterium abundance\n(D/H)$_{\\rm p}=(2.55\\pm 0.19)\\times10^{-5}$ which is in good agreement with the\nprediction of analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation for the\nstandard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. By means of the derived (D/H)$_{\\rm p}$\nvalue the baryon density of the Universe $\\Omega_{\\rm b}h^2=0.0222\\pm0.0013$\nand the baryon-to-photon ratio $\\eta_{10} = 6.09\\pm 0.36$ have been deduced.\nThese values have confident intervals which are less stringent than that\nobtained for the {\\it Precision Sample} and, thus, leave a broader window for\nnew physics. The latter is particularly important in the light of the lithium\nproblem.\n", "  The morphological, spectroscopic and kinematical properties of the warm\ninterstellar medium (wim) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) hold key observational\nconstraints to nuclear activity and the buildup history of these massive,\nquiescent systems. High-quality integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data with a\nwide spectral and spatial coverage, such as those from the CALIFA survey, offer\nan unprecedented opportunity for advancing our understanding of the wim in\nETGs. This article centers on a 2D investigation of the wim component in 32\nnearby (<~150Mpc) ETGs from CALIFA, complementing a previous 1D analysis of the\nsame sample (Papaderos et al. 2013; P13). We include here H\\alpha\\ intensity\nand equivalent width (EW) maps and radial profiles, diagnostic emission-line\nratios, besides ionized-gas and stellar kinematics. This study is supplemented\nby \\tau-ratio maps as an efficient means to quantify the role of\nphotoionization by pAGB stars, as compared to other mechanisms (e.g., AGN,\nlow-level star formation). Additionally, we extend the tentative classification\nproposed in P13 by the type i+, which is assigned to a subset of type i ETGs\nexhibiting ongoing low-level star-formation (SF) in their periphery. This\nfinding along with faint traces of localized SF in the extranuclear component\nof several of our sample ETGs points to a non-negligible contribution by OB\nstars to the total ionizing budget. We also demonstrate that, at the typical\nemission-line detection threshold of ~2\\AA in previous studies, most of the\nextranuclear wim emission in an ETG may evade detection, which could in turn\nprompt its classification as an entirely gas-devoid system. This study adds\nfurther observational evidence for a considerable heterogeneity among ETGs with\nregard to the physical properties and 2D kinematics of the wim component, and\nunderscores the importance of IFS studies over their entire optical extent.\n", "  The mathematical treatment and graphical representation of Special Relativity\n(SR) are well established, yet carry deep implications that remain hard to\nvisualize. This paper presents a new graphical interpretation of the geometry\nof SR that may, by complementing the standard works, aid the understanding of\nSR and its fundamental principles in a more intuitive way. From the axiom that\nthe velocity of light remains constant to any inertial observer, the geodesic\nis presented as a line of constant angle on the complex plane across a set of\ndiverging reference frames. The resultant curve is a logarithmic spiral, and\nthis view of the geodesic is extended to illustrate the relativistic Doppler\neffect, time dilation, length contraction, the twin paradox, and relativistic\nradar distance in an original way, whilst retaining the essential mathematical\nrelationships of SR. Using a computer-generated graphical representation of\nphoton trajectories allows a visual comparison between the relativistic\nrelationships and their classical counterparts, to visualize the consequences\nof SR as velocities become relativistic. The model may readily be extended to\nother situations, and may be found useful in presenting a fresh understanding\nof SR through geometric visualization.\n", "  We use spin wave theory to investigate the ground state properties of the\n$Z_2$-invariant quantum XXZ model on the triangular lattice in the\nferromagnetic phase. The Hamiltonian comprises nearest and\nnext-nearest-neighbour Ising couplings, external magnetic fields, and a\n$Z_2$-invariant ferromagnetic coupling. We show that quantum fluctuations are\nsuppressed in this system, hence linear spin wave theory gives reasonable\nestimates of the ground state thermodynamic properties. Our results show that,\nat half-filling (zero magnetic fields), the spontaneous breaking of $Z_2$\nsymmetry leads to a ferromagnetic phase whose energy spectrum is gapped at all\nexcitations with a maxon dispersion at $\\mathbf{k}=0$. This is in sharp\ncontrast to rotational invariant systems with a vanishing phonon dispersion. We\nshow that the $\\mathbf{k}=0$ mode enhances the estimated values of the\nthermodynamic quantities. We obtain the trends of the particle density and the\ncondensate fraction. The density of states and the dynamical structure factors\nexhibit fascinating peaks at unusual wave vectors, which should be of interest.\n", "  Gamma-ray detected radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (g-NLS1) galaxies\nconstitute a small but interesting sample of the gamma-ray loud AGN. The\nradio-loudest g-NLS1 known, PKS 2004-447, is located in the southern hemisphere\nand is monitored in the radio regime by the multiwavelength monitoring program\nTANAMI. We aim for the first detailed study of the radio morphology and\nlong-term radio spectral evolution of PKS 2004-447, which are essential to\nunderstand the diversity of the radio properties of g-NLS1s. The TANAMI VLBI\nmonitoring program uses the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and telescopes\nin Antarctica, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa to monitor the jets of\nradio-loud active galaxies in the southern hemisphere. Lower resolution radio\nflux density measurements at multiple radio frequencies over four years of\nobservations were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).\nThe TANAMI VLBI image at 8.4 GHz shows an extended one-sided jet with a\ndominant compact VLBI core. Its brightness temperature is consistent with\nequipartition, but it is an order of magnitude below other g-NLS1s with the\nsample value varying over two orders of magnitude. We find a compact morphology\nwith a projected large-scale size <11 kpc and a persistent steep radio spectrum\nwith moderate flux-density variability. PKS 2004-447 appears to be a unique\nmember of the g-NLS1 sample. It exhibits blazar-like features, such as a flat\nfeatureless X-ray spectrum and a core dominated, one-sided parsec-scale jet\nwith indications for relativistic beaming. However, the data also reveal\nproperties atypical for blazars, such as a radio spectrum and large-scale size\nconsistent with Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) objects, which are usually\nassociated with young radio sources. These characteristics are unique among all\ng-NLS1s and extremely rare among gamma-ray loud AGN.\n", "  We study BPS excitations in M5-M2-brane configurations with a compact\ntransverse direction, which are also relevant for type IIa and IIb little\nstring theories. These configurations are dual to a class of toric elliptically\nfibered Calabi-Yau manifolds $X_N$ with manifest $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\times\nSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ modular symmetry. They admit two dual gauge theory\ndescriptions. For both, the non-perturbative partition function can be written\nas an expansion of the topological string partition function of $X_N$ with\nrespect to either of the two modular parameters. We analyze the resulting BPS\ncounting functions in detail and find that they can be fully constructed as\nlinear combinations of the BPS counting functions of M5-M2-brane configurations\nwith non-compact transverse directions. For certain M2-brane configurations, we\nalso find that the free energies in the two dual theories agree with each\nother, which points to a new correspondence between instanton and monopole\nconfigurations. These results are also a manifestation of T-duality between\ntype IIa and IIb little string theories.\n", "  We study neutral dark matter candidates with a nonzero magnetic dipole\nmoment. We assume that they are composite states of new fermions related to the\nstrong phase of a new gauge interaction. In particular, invoking a dark flavor\nsymmetry, we analyze the composition structure of viable candidates depending\non the assignations of hypercharge and the multiplets associated to the\nfundamental constituents of the extended sector. We determine the magnetic\ndipole moments for the neutral composite states in terms of their constituents\nmasses.\n", "  We characterize the eccentricity distribution of a sample of ~50 short-period\nplanet candidates using transit and occultation measurements from NASA's Kepler\nMission. First, we evaluate the sensitivity of our hierarchical Bayesian\nmodeling and test its robustness to model misspecification using simulated\ndata. When analyzing actual data assuming a Rayleigh distribution for\neccentricity, we find that the posterior mode for the dispersion parameter is\n$\\sigma=0.081 \\pm^{0.014}_{0.003}$. We find that a two-component Gaussian\nmixture model for $e \\cos \\omega$ and $e \\sin \\omega$ provides a better model\nthan either a Rayleigh or Beta distribution. Based on our favored model, we\nfind that $\\sim90\\%$ of planet candidates in our sample come from a population\nwith an eccentricity distribution characterized by a small dispersion\n($\\sim0.01$), and $\\sim10\\%$ come from a population with a larger dispersion\n($\\sim0.22$). Finally, we investigate how the eccentricity distribution\ncorrelates with selected planet and host star parameters. We find evidence that\nsuggests systems around higher metallicity stars and planet candidates with\nsmaller radii come from a more complex eccentricity distribution.\n", "  We present a new technique using a frequency comb laser and optical cavities\nfor performing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy with improved\nsensitivity. Resonantly enhancing the probe pulses, we demonstrate a\nsensitivity of $\\Delta$OD $ = 1 \\times 10^{-9}/\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ for averaging\ntimes as long as 30 s per delay point ($\\Delta$OD$_{min} = 2 \\times 10^{-10}$).\nResonantly enhancing the pump pulses allows us to produce a high excitation\nfraction at high repetition-rate, so that signals can be recorded from samples\nwith optical densities as low as OD $\\approx 10^{-8}$, or column densities $<\n10^{10}$ molecules/cm$^2$. This high sensitivity enables new directions for\nultrafast spectroscopy.\n", "  Stacked spin-vortex pairs in magnetic multilayered nanopillars, with vertical\nseparation between the vortices small compared to the vortex core size, exhibit\nspin dynamics absent in individual vortices. This dynamics is nonlinear and is\ndue to the strong direct core-core coupling in the system, dominating\nenergetically for small- signal excitation. We observe and explain the\nappearance of spin resonance modes, forbidden within linear dynamics, and\ndiscuss how they depend on the magnetic and morphological asymmetries in the\nsamples.\n", "  We investigate the strong influence of the $\\Theta_{II}$-loop-current order\non both unidirectional and bidirectional d-wave\ncharge-density-wave/pair-density-wave (CDW/PDW) composite orders along axial\nmomenta $(\\pm Q_0,0)$ and $(0,\\pm Q_0)$ that emerge in an effective hot spot\nmodel departing from the three-band Emery model relevant to the phenomenology\nof the cuprate superconductors. This study is motivated by the compelling\nevidence that the $\\Theta_{II}$-loop-current order described by this model may\nexplain groundbreaking experiments such as spin-polarized neutron scattering\nperformed in these materials. Here, we demonstrate, within a saddle-point\napproximation, that the $\\Theta_{II}$-loop-current order clearly coexists with\nbidirectional (i.e. checkerboard) d-wave CDW and PDW orders along axial\nmomenta, but is visibly detrimental to the unidirectional (i.e. stripe) case.\nThis result has potentially far-reaching implications for the physics of the\ncuprates and agrees well with very recent x-ray experiments on YBCO that\nindicate that at higher dopings the CDW order has indeed a tendency to be\nbidirectional.\n", "  The photon blockade is a hallmark of quantum light transport through a single\ntwo-level system that can accomodate only one photon. Here, we theoretically\nshow that two-photon transmission can be suppressed even for a seemingly\nclassical system with large number of quantum dots in a cavity when the\nbiexciton nonlinearity is taken into account. We reveal the nonmonotonous\ndependence of the second-order correlation function of the transmitted photons\non the biexciton binding energy. The blockade is realized by proper tuning the\nbiexciton resonance that controls the collective superradiant modes.\n", "  Mild, unavoidable deviations from circular-symmetry of instrumental beams\nalong with scan strategy can give rise to measurable Statistical Isotropy (SI)\nviolation in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. If not accounted\nproperly, this spurious signal can complicate the extraction of other SI\nviolation signals (if any) in the data. However, estimation of this effect\nthrough exact numerical simulation is computationally intensive and time\nconsuming. A generalized analytical formalism not only provides a quick way of\nestimating this signal, but also gives a detailed understanding connecting the\nleading beam anisotropy components to a measurable BipoSH characterisation of\nSI violation. In this paper, we provide an approximate generic analytical\nmethod for estimating the SI violation generated due to a non-circular (NC)\nbeam and arbitrary scan strategy, in terms of the Bipolar Spherical Harmonic\n(BipoSH) spectra. Our analytical method can predict almost all the features\nintroduced by a NC beam in a complex scan and thus reduces the need for\nextensive numerical simulation worth tens of thousands of CPU hours into\nminutes long calculations. As an illustrative example, we use WMAP beams and\nscanning strategy to demonstrate the easability, usability and efficiency of\nour method. We test all our analytical results against that from exact\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  (abridged) Context: The mechanisms that cause the formation of sunspots are\nstill unclear. Aims: We study the self-organisation of initially uniform\nsub-equipartition magnetic fields by highly stratified turbulent convection.\nMethods: We perform simulations of magnetoconvection in Cartesian domains that\nare $8.5$-$24$ Mm deep and $34$-$96$ Mm wide. We impose either a vertical or a\nhorizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.\nResults: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are\nformed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of\nthe concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest\nstructures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The\nfield strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The\nconcentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic\npressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative\nin the bulk of the convection zone. Its derivative with respect to the mean\nmagnetic field, however, is positive in the majority of the domain, which is\nunfavourable for the negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI).\nFurthermore, we find that magnetic flux is concentrated in regions of\nconverging flow corresponding to large-scale supergranulation convection\npattern. Conclusions: The linear growth of large-scale flux concentrations\nimplies that their dominant formation process is tangling of the large-scale\nfield rather than an instability. One plausible mechanism explaining both the\nlinear growth and the concentrate on of the flux in the regions of converging\nflow pattern is flux expulsion. Possible reasons for the absence of NEMPI are\nthat the derivative of the effective magnetic pressure with respect to the mean\nmagnetic field has an unfavourable sign and that there may not be sufficient\nscale separation.\n", "  We investigate constraints on the interactions of light dark matter with\nStandard Model quarks in a framework with effective contact operators mediating\nthe decay of heavy flavor bound state quarkonium to dark matter and a photon.\nWhen considered in combination with decays to purely invisible final states,\nconstraints from heavy quarkonium decays at high intensity electron-positron\ncolliders can complement missing energy searches at high energy colliders and\nprovide sensitivity to dark matter masses difficult to probe at direct and\nindirect detection experiments. We calculate the approximate limits on the\nbranching fraction for $\\Upsilon (1 S)$ decays to dark matter and a photon.\nGiven the approximate limits on the branching fractions for all dimension 6 or\nlower contact operators, we present the corresponding limits on the interaction\nstrength for each operator and the inferred limits on dark matter-nucleon\nscattering. Complementary constraints on dark matter annihilation from\ngamma-ray searches from dwarf spheroidal galaxies are also considered.\n", "  We investigate the (0001) surface of single crystal quartz with a\nsubmonolayer of Rb adsorbates. Using Rydberg atom electromagnetically induced\ntransparency, we investigate the electric fields resulting from Rb adsorbed on\nthe quartz surface, and measure the activation energy of the Rb adsorbates. We\nshow that the adsorbed Rb induces a negative electron affinity (NEA) on the\nquartz surface. The NEA surface allows low energy electrons to bind to the\nsurface and cancel the electric field from the Rb adsorbates. Our results are\nimportant for integrating Rydberg atoms into hybrid quantum systems and the\nfundamental study of atom-surface interactions, as well as applications for\nelectrons bound to a 2D surface.\n", "  We present a novel parameter-free cosmological void finder (\\textsc{dive},\nDelaunay TrIangulation Void findEr) based on Delaunay Triangulation (DT), which\nefficiently computes the empty spheres constrained by a discrete set of\ntracers. We define the spheres as DT voids, and describe their properties,\nincluding an universal density profile together with an intrinsic scatter. We\napply this technique on 100 halo catalogues with volumes of 2.5\\,$h^{-1}$Gpc\nside each, with a bias and number density similar to the BOSS CMASS Luminous\nRed Galaxies, performed with the \\textsc{patchy} code. Our results show that\nthere are two main species of DT voids, which can be characterised by the\nradius: they have different responses to halo redshift space distortions, to\nnumber density of tracers, and reside in different dark matter environments.\nBased on dynamical arguments using the tidal field tensor, we demonstrate that\nlarge DT voids are hosted in expanding regions, whereas the haloes used to\nconstruct them reside in collapsing ones. Our approach is therefore able to\nefficiently determine the troughs of the density field from galaxy surveys, and\ncan be used to study their clustering. We further study the power spectra of DT\nvoids, and find that the bias of the two populations are different,\ndemonstrating that the small DT voids are essentially tracers of groups of\nhaloes.\n", "  Topological phases of matter possess intricate correlation patterns typically\nprobed by entanglement entropies or entanglement spectra. In this work, we\npropose an alternative approach to assessing topologically induced edge states\nin free and interacting fermionic systems. We do so by focussing on the\nfermionic covariance matrix. This matrix is often tractable either analytically\nor numerically and it precisely captures the relevant correlations of the\nsystem. By invoking the concept of monogamy of entanglement we show that highly\nentangled states supported across a system bi-partition are largely\ndisentangled from the rest of the system, thus appearing usually as gapless\nedge states. We then define an entanglement qualifier that identifies the\npresence of topological edge states based purely on correlations present in the\nground states. We demonstrate the versatility of this qualifier by applying it\nto various free and interacting fermionic topological systems.\n", "  In this article the mechanism of the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect in\nthe rhombohedral multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ is considered. The study is based on\nthe symmetry approach of the GinzburgLandau type, in which polarization,\nantiferrodistortion, and antiferromagnetic momentum vectors are viewed as\nordering parameters. We demonstrate that the linear ME effect in BFO is caused\nby reorientation of the antiferrodistortion vector in either electric or\nmagnetic field. The numerical estimations, which show quantitative agreement\nwith the results of the recent measurements in film samples, have been\nperformed. A possibility of significant enhancement of the magnetoelectric\neffect by applying an external static electric field has been investigated. The\nconsidered approach is promising for explaining the high values of the ME\neffect in composite films and heterostructures with BFO.\n", "  In a previous paper (JHEP {\\bf 05} (2014) 27), we calculated the three-loop\nthermodynamic potential of QCD at finite temperature $T$ and quark chemical\npotentials $\\mu_q$ using the hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory (HTLpt)\nreorganization of finite temperature and density QCD. The result allows us to\nstudy the thermodynamics of QCD at finite temperature and isospin chemical\npotential $\\mu_I$. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and entropy\ndensity, the trace anomaly, and the speed of sound at zero and nonzero $\\mu_I$.\nThe second, fourth, and sixth-order isospin susceptibilities are calculated at\nzero $\\mu_I$. Our results can be directly compared to lattice QCD without\nTaylor expansions around $\\mu_q=0$ since QCD has no sign problem at finite\nisospin chemical potential.\n", "  Quantum localization within an energy-shell of a closed quantum system stands\nin contrast to the ergodic assumption of Boltzmann, and to the corresponding\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The familiar case is the real-space\n\"Anderson localization\" and its many-body Fock-space version. We use the term\n\"Hilbert-space localization\" in order to emphasize the more general phase-space\ncontext. Specifically, we introduce a unifying picture that extends the\nsemiclassical perspective of Heller, which relates the localization measure to\nthe probability of return. We illustrate our approach by considering several\nsystems of experimental interest, referring in particular to the Bosonic\nJosephson tunneling junction. We explore the dependence of the localization\nmeasure on the initial state, and on the strength of the many-body interactions\nusing a novel recursive projection method.\n", "  Modern proposed atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments, such as PINGU\nin the Antarctic ice or ORCA in Mediterranean sea water, aim for precision\nmeasurements of the oscillation parameters including the ordering of the\nneutrino masses. They can, however, go far beyond that: Since neutrino\noscillations are affected by the coherent forward scattering with matter,\nneutrinos can provide a new view on the interior of the earth. We show that the\nproposed atmospheric oscillation experiments can measure the lower mantle\ndensity of the earth with a precision at the level of a few percent, including\nthe uncertainties of the oscillation parameters and correlations among\ndifferent density layers. While the earth's core is, in principle, accessible\nby the angular resolution, new technology would be required to extract\ndegeneracy-free information.\n", "  We explore excitonic energy transfer dynamics in a molecular dimer system\ncoupled to both structured and unstructured oscillator environments. By\nextending the reaction coordinate master equation technique developed in [J.\nIles-Smith, N. Lambert, and A. Nazir, Phys. Rev. A 90, 032114 (2014)], we go\nbeyond the commonly used Born-Markov approximations to incorporate\nsystem-environment correlations and the resultant non-Markovian dynamical\neffects. We obtain energy transfer dynamics for both underdamped and overdamped\noscillator environments that are in perfect agreement with the numerical\nhierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters. Furthermore,\nwe show that the Zusman equations, which may be obtained in a semiclassical\nlimit of the reaction coordinate model, are often incapable of describing the\ncorrect dynamical behaviour. This demonstrates the necessity of properly\naccounting for quantum correlations generated between the system and its\nenvironment when the Born-Markov approximations no longer hold. Finally, we\napply the reaction coordinate formalism to the case of a structured environment\ncomprising of both underdamped (i.e. sharply peaked) and overdamped (broad)\ncomponents simultaneously. We find that though an enhancement of the dimer\nenergy transfer rate can be obtained when compared to an unstructured\nenvironment, its magnitude is rather sensitive to both the dimer-peak resonance\nconditions and the relative strengths of the underdamped and overdamped\ncontributions.\n", "  In this paper we explore contributions to non-perturbative superpotentials\narising from instantons wrapping effective divisors in smooth Calabi-Yau\nfour-folds. We concentrate on the case of manifolds constructed as complete\nintersections in products of projective spaces (CICYs) or generalizations\nthereof (gCICYs). We systematically investigate the structure of the cone of\neffective (algebraic) divisors in the four-fold geometries and employ the same\ntools recently developed in arXiv:1507.03235 to construct more general\ninstanton geometries than have previously been considered in the literature. We\nprovide examples of instanton configurations on Calabi-Yau manifolds that are\nelliptically and $K3$-fibered and explore their consequences in the context of\nstring dualities. The examples discussed include manifolds containing infinite\nfamilies of divisors with arithmetic genus, $\\chi(D, \\mathcal O_D)=1$ and\nsuperpotentials exhibiting modular symmetry.\n", "  We introduce a theory of chemical bond with a corpuscular picture of\nelectrons. It employs a minimal set of localized electron wave packets with\n'floating and breathing' degrees of freedom and the spin-coupling of\nnon-orthogonal valence-bond theory. It accurately describes chemical bonds in\nground and excited states of spin singlet and triplet, in a distinct manner\nfrom conventional theories, indicating potential for establishing a dynamical\ntheory of electrons in chemical bonds.\n", "  The presence of neutral hydrogen in the shock proximity changes the structure\nof the shock and affects the spectra of particles accelerated through the\nfirst-order Fermi mechanism. This phenomenon has profound implications for the\ninterpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova\nremnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the\nshock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they\ncan suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby\ndepositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of\nthis neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on\nneutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated\nparticles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting\nthe gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho\nspecifically. The theory that describes non-linear diffusive shock acceleration\nin the presence of neutral hydrogen has been developed in recent years. Here we\nuse a semi-analytical theory developed in previous work and specialise our\npredictions to the case of the Tycho supernova shock, where there is evidence\nthat the spectrum of the accelerated cosmic rays is steeper than expected from\nthe traditional theory of diffusive shock acceleration. We show that, if the\nfraction of neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova shock is,\nas suggested by observations, ~70-90, then spectra of accelerated protons\nsteeper than $p^{-4}$ may be a natural consequence of charge exchange reactions\nand the associated neutral return flux. The spectral shape is affected by this\nphenomenon for particles with energies below ~100-1000 GeV, for which the\ndiffusion length is less than or at most comparable to the pathlength of charge\nexchange and ionisation upstream of the shock.\n", "  Bell non-local correlations cannot be naturally explained in a fixed causal\nstructure. This serves as a motivation for considering models where no global\nassumption is made beyond logical consistency. The assumption of a fixed causal\norder between a set of parties, together with free randomness, implies\ndevice-independent inequalities --- just as the assumption of locality does. It\nis known that local validity of quantum theory is consistent with violating\nsuch inequalities. Moreover, for three parties or more, even the (stronger)\nassumption of local classical probability theory plus logical consistency\nallows for violating causal inequalities. Here, we show that a classical\nenvironment (with which the parties interact), possibly containing loops, is\nlogically consistent if and only if whatever the involved parties do, there is\nexactly one fixed-point, the latter being representable as a mixture of\ndeterministic fixed-points. We further show that the non-causal view allows for\na model of computation strictly more powerful than computation in a world of\nfixed causal orders.\n", "  We present a holographic model of a topological Weyl semimetal. A key\ningredient is a time-reversal breaking parameter and a mass deformation. Upon\nvarying the ratio of mass to time-reversal breaking parameter the model\nundergoes a quantum phase transition from a topologically nontrivial semimetal\nto a trivial one. The topological nontrivial semimetal is characterised by the\npresence of an anomalous Hall effect. The results can be interpreted in terms\nof the holographic renormalization group (RG) flow leading to restoration of\ntime-reversal at the end point of the RG flow in the trivial phase.\n", "  The radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized $r$-process nuclei ejected\nin compact binary mergers power optical/infrared macronovae (kilonovae) that\nfollow these events. The light curves depend critically on the energy partition\namong the different products of the radioactive decay and this plays an\nimportant role in estimates of the amount of ejected $r$-process elements from\na given observed signal. We study the energy partition and $\\gamma$-ray\nemission of the radioactive decay. We show that $20$-$50\\%$ of the total\nradioactive energy is released in $\\gamma$-rays on timescales from hours to a\nmonth. The number of emitted $\\gamma$-rays per unit energy interval has roughly\na flat spectrum between a few dozen keV and $1$ MeV so that most of this energy\nis carried by $\\sim 1$ MeV $\\gamma$-rays. However at the peak of macronova\nemission the optical depth of the $\\gamma$-rays is $\\sim 0.02$ and most of the\n$\\gamma$-rays escape. The loss of these $\\gamma$-rays reduces the heat\ndeposition into the ejecta and hence reduces the expected macronova signals if\nthose are lanthanides dominated. This implies that the ejected mass is larger\nby a factor of $2$-$3$ than what was previously estimated. Spontaneous fission\nheats up the ejecta and the heating rate can increase if a sufficient amount of\ntransuranic nuclei are synthesized. Direct measurements of these escaping\n$\\gamma$-rays may provide the ultimate proof for the macronova mechanisms and\nan identification of the $r$-process nucleosynthesis sites. However, the\nchances to detect these signals are slim with current X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray\nmissions. New detectors, more sensitive by at least a factor of ten, are needed\nfor a realistic detection rate.\n", "  We further study the relations between parameters of bursts at 35 GHz\nrecorded with the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters during 25 years, on the one hand,\nand solar proton events, on the other hand (Grechnev et al. in Publ. Astron.\nSoc. Japan 65, S4, 2013a). Here we address the relations between the microwave\nfluences at 35 GHz and near-Earth proton fluences above 100 MeV in order to\nfind information on their sources and evaluate their diagnostic potential. A\ncorrelation was found to be pronouncedly higher between the microwave and\nproton fluences than between their peak fluxes. This fact probably reflects a\ndependence of the total number of protons on the duration of the acceleration\nprocess. In events with strong flares, the correlation coefficients of\nhigh-energy proton fluences with microwave and soft X-ray fluences are higher\nthan those with the speeds of coronal mass ejections. The results indicate a\nstatistically larger contribution of flare processes to high-energy proton\nfluxes. Acceleration by shock waves seems to be less important at high energies\nin events associated with strong flares, although its contribution is probable\nand possibly prevails in weaker events. The probability of a detectable proton\nenhancement was found to directly depend on the peak flux, duration, and\nfluence of the 35 GHz burst, while the role of the Big Flare Syndrome might be\noverestimated previously. Empirical diagnostic relations are proposed.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field in the early Universe,\namplified by inflation, produce a primordial gravitational-wave background\nacross a broad frequency band. We derive constraints on the spectrum of this\ngravitational radiation, and hence on theories of the early Universe, by\ncombining experiments that cover 29 orders of magnitude in frequency. These\ninclude Planck observations of cosmic microwave background temperature and\npolarization power spectra and lensing, together with baryon acoustic\noscillations and big bang nucleosynthesis measurements, as well as new pulsar\ntiming array and ground-based interferometer limits. While individual\nexperiments constrain the gravitational-wave energy density in specific\nfrequency bands, the combination of experiments allows us to constrain\ncosmological parameters, including the inflationary spectral index, $n_t$, and\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Results from individual experiments include\nthe most stringent nanohertz limit of the primordial background to date from\nthe Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, $\\Omega_{\\rm gw}(f)<2.3\\times10^{-10}$.\nObservations of the cosmic microwave background alone limit the\ngravitational-wave spectral index at 95\\% confidence to $n_t\\lesssim5$ for a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of $r = 0.11$. However, the combination of all the above\nexperiments limits $n_t<0.36$. Future Advanced LIGO observations are expected\nto further constrain $n_t<0.34$ by 2020. When cosmic microwave background\nexperiments detect a non-zero $r$, our results will imply even more stringent\nconstraints on $n_t$ and hence theories of the early Universe.\n", "  We present the measurement of the transverse single-spin asymmetry of weak\nboson production in transversely polarized proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 500~\\text{GeV}$ by the STAR experiment at RHIC. The measured\nobservable is sensitive to the Sivers function, one of the transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions, which is predicted to have the\nopposite sign in proton-proton collisions from that observed in deep inelastic\nlepton-proton scattering. These data provide the first experimental\ninvestigation of the non-universality of the Sivers function, fundamental to\nour understanding of QCD.\n", "  We analyze spherically symmetric black hole solutions with time-dependent\nscalar hair in a class of Lovelock-Galileon theories, which are the\nscalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations in arbitrary\ndimensions. We first show that known black hole solutions in five dimensions\nare always plagued by the ghost/gradient instability in the vicinity of the\nhorizon. We then generalize such black hole solutions to higher dimensions and\nshow that the same instability found in five dimensions appears universally in\nany number of dimensions.\n", "  We use the Herschel Hi-GAL survey data to study the spatial distribution in\nGalactic longitude and latitude of the interstellar medium and of dense,\nstar-forming clumps in the inner Galaxy. The peak position and width of the\nlatitude distribution of the dust column density as well as of number density\nof compact sources from the band-merged Hi-GAL photometric catalogues are\nanalysed as a function of longitude. The width of the diffuse dust column\ndensity traced by the Hi-GAL 500 micron emission varies across the inner\nGalaxy, with a mean value of 1{\\deg}.2-1{\\deg}.3, similar to that of the 250um\nHi-GAL sources. 70um Hi-GAL sources define a much thinner disk, with a mean\nFWHM of 0{\\deg}.75, and an average latitude of b=0{\\deg}.06, coincident with\nthe results from ATLASGAL. The GLAT distribution as a function of GLON shows\nmodulations, both for the diffuse emission and for the compact sources, with\n~0{\\deg}.2 displacements mostly toward negative latitudes at l~ +40{\\deg},\n+12{\\deg}, -25{\\deg} and -40{\\deg}. No such modulations can be found in the\nMIPSGAL 24 or WISE 22 um data when the entire source samples are considered.\nThe distortions revealed by Herschel are interpreted as large-scale bending\nmodes of the Plane. The lack of similar distortions in tracers of more evolved\nYSOs or stars rules out gravitational instabilities or satellite-induced\nperturbations, as they should act on both the diffuse and stellar disk\ncomponents. We propose that the observed bends are caused by incoming flows of\nextra-planar gas interacting with the gaseous disk. Stars decouple from the\ngaseous ISM and relax into the stellar disk potential. The time required for\nthe disappearance of the distortions from the diffuse ISM to the relatively\nevolved YSO stages are compatible with star-formation timescales.\n", "  We first provide a formula to calculate the probability of occurrence of\ndifferent configurations (formation probabilities) in a generic free fermion\nsystem. We then study the scaling of these probabilities with respect to the\nsize in the case of critical transverse-field XY-chain in the $\\sigma^z$ bases.\nIn the case of the transverse field Ising model, we show that all the \"crystal\"\nconfigurations follow the formulas expected from conformal field theory (CFT).\nIn the case of critical $XX$ chain, we show that the only configurations that\nfollow the formulas of the CFT are the ones which respect the filling factor of\nthe system. By repeating all the calculations in the presence of open and\nperiodic boundary conditions we find further support to our classification of\ndifferent configurations. Using the developed technique, we also study Shannon\ninformation of a subregion in our system. In this respect we distinguish\nparticular configurations that are more important in the study of the scaling\nlimit of the Shannon information of the subsystem. Finally, we study the\nevolution of formation probabilities, Shannon information and Shannon mutual\ninformation after a quantum quench in free fermion system. In particular, for\nthe intial state considered in this paper, we demonstrate that the Shannon\ninformation after quantum quench first increases with the time and then\nsaturates at time $t^*=\\frac{l}{2}$, where $l$ is the size of the subsystem.\n", "  The DEdicated MONitor of EXotransits (DEMONEX) was a 20 inch robotic and\nautomated telescope to monitor bright stars hosting transiting exoplanets to\ndiscover new planets and improve constraints on the properties of known\ntransiting planetary systems. We present results for the misaligned hot Jupiter\nXO-4b containing 7 new transits from the DEMONEX telescope, including 3 full\nand 4 partial transits. We combine these data with archival light curves and\narchival radial velocity measurements to derive the host star mass\n$M_{*}=1.293_{-0.029}^{+0.030} M_\\odot$ and radius\n$R_{*}=1.554_{-0.030}^{+0.042} R_\\odot$ as well as the planet mass\n$M_{P}=1.615_{-0.099}^{+0.10} M_{\\rm J}$ and radius\n$R_{P}=1.317_{-0.029}^{+0.040} R_{\\rm J}$ and a refined ephemeris of\n$P=4.1250687\\pm0.0000024$ days and $T_{0}=2454758.18978\\pm0.00024 \\rm\n{BJD_{TDB}}$. We include archival Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of XO-4 to\ninfer the stellar spin-planetary orbit alignment $\\lambda=-40.0_{-7.5}^{+8.8}$\ndegrees.\n  We test the effects of including various detrend parameters, theoretical and\nempirical mass-radius relations, and Rossiter-McLaughlin models. We infer that\ndetrending against CCD position and time or airmass can improve data quality,\nbut can have significant effects on the inferred values of many parameters ---\nmost significantly $R_{P}/R_{*}$ and the observed central transit times\n$T_{C}$. In the case of $R_{P}/R_{*}$ we find that the systematic uncertainty\ndue to detrending can be three times that of the quoted statistical\nuncertainties. The choice of mass-radius relation has little effect on our\ninferred values of the system parameters. The choice of Rossiter-McLaughlin\nmodels can have significant effects of the inferred values of $v\\sin{I_{*}}$\nand the stellar spin-planet orbit angle $\\lambda$.\n", "  In this work we present a new view on the thermodynamics of black holes\nintroducing effects of irreversibility by employing thermodynamic optimization\nand finite-time thermodynamics. These questions are of importance both in\nphysics and in engineering, combining standard thermodynamics with optimal\ncontrol theory in order to find optimal protocols and bounds for realistic\nprocesses without assuming anything about the microphysics involved. We find\ngeneral bounds on the maximum work and the efficiency of thermodynamic\nprocesses involving black holes that can be derived exclusively from the\nknowledge of thermodynamic relations at equilibrium. Since these new bounds\nconsider the finite duration of the processes, they are more realistic and\nstringent than their reversible counterparts. To illustrate our arguments, we\nconsider in detail the thermodynamic optimization of a Penrose process, i.e.\nthe problem of finding the least dissipative process extracting all the angular\nmomentum from a Kerr black hole in finite time. We discuss the relevance of our\nresults for real astrophysical phenomena, for the comparison with laboratory\nblack holes analogues and for other theoretical aspects of black hole\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We perform a systematic search for rotationally invariant cosmological\nsolutions to matrix models, or more specifically the bosonic sector of\nLorentzian IKKT-type matrix models, in dimensions $d$ less than ten,\nspecifically $d=3$ and $d=5$. After taking a continuum (or commutative) limit\nthey yield $d-1$ dimensional space-time surfaces, with an attached Poisson\nstructure, which can be associated with closed, open or static cosmologies. For\n$d=3$, we obtain recursion relations from which it is possible to generate\nrotationally invariant matrix solutions which yield open universes in the\ncontinuum limit. Specific examples of matrix solutions have also been found\nwhich are associated with closed and static two-dimensional space-times in the\ncontinuum limit. The solutions provide for a matrix resolution of cosmological\nsingularities. The commutative limit reveals other desirable features, such as\na solution describing a smooth transition from an initial inflation to a\nnoninflationary era. Many of the $d=3$ solutions have analogues in higher\ndimensions. The case of $d=5$, in particular, has the potential for yielding\nrealistic four-dimensional cosmologies in the continuum limit. We find\nfour-dimensional de Sitter $dS^4$ or anti-de Sitter $AdS^4$ solutions when a\ntotally antisymmetric term is included in the matrix action. A nontrivial\nPoisson structure is attached to these manifolds which represents the lowest\norder effect of noncommutativity. For the case of $AdS^4$, we find one\nparticlular limit where the lowest order noncommutativity vanishes at the\nboundary, but not in the interior.\n", "  We inquire how structure emerges during the process of protein folding. For\nthis we scrutinise col- lective many-atom motions during all-atom molecular\ndynamics simulations. We introduce, develop and employ various topological\ntechniques, in combination with analytic tools that we deduce from the concept\nof integrable models and structure of discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.\nThe example we consider is an alpha-helical subunit of the HIV envelope\nglycoprotein gp41. The helical structure is stable when the subunit is part of\nthe biological oligomer. But in isolation the helix becomes unstable, and the\nmonomer starts deforming. We follow the process computationally. We interpret\nthe evolving structure both in terms of a backbone based Heisenberg spin chain\nand in terms of a side chain based XY spin chain. We find that in both cases\nthe formation of protein super-secondary structure is akin the formation of a\ntopological Bloch domain wall along a spin chain. During the process we\nidentify three individual Bloch walls and we show that each of them can be\nmodelled with a very high precision in terms of a soliton solution to a\ndiscrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.\n", "  Neutrino mass generation through the Higgs mechanism not only suggests the\nneed to reconsider the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking from a new\nperspective, but also provides a new theoretically consistent and\nexperimentally viable paradigm. We illustrate this by describing the main\nfeatures of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the simplest type-II\nseesaw model with spontaneous breaking of lepton number. After reviewing the\nrelevant \"theoretical\" and astrophysical restrictions on the Higgs sector, we\nperform an analysis of the sensitivities of Higgs boson searches at the ongoing\nATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, including not only the new contributions\nto the decay channels present in the Standard Model (SM) but also genuinely\nnon-SM Higgs boson decays, such as \"invisible\" Higgs boson decays to majorons.\nWe find sensitivities that are likely to be reached at the upcoming Run of the\nexperiments.\n", "  X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy using an X-ray free electron\nlaser is demonstrated with spectra over the Fe L$_{3,2}$-edges. This new\nultrafast time-resolved capability is then applied to a fluence-dependent study\nof all-optical magnetic switching dynamics of Fe and Gd magnetic sublattices in\na GdFeCo thin film above its magnetization compensation temperature. At the\nmagnetic switching fuence, we corroborate the existence of a transient\nferromagnetic-like state. The timescales of the dynamics, however, are longer\nthan previously observed below the magnetization compensation temperature.\nAbove and below the switching fluence range, we observe secondary\ndemagnetization with about 5 ps timescales. This indicates that the spin\nthermalization takes longer than 5 ps.\n", "  One of first the stages of planet formation is the growth of small\nplanetesimals and their accumulation into large planetesimals and planetary\nembryos. This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the gas\nfrom the protoplanetary disk. At this stage gas-planetesimal interactions play\na key role in the dynamical evolution of \\emph{single} intermediate-mass\nplanetesimals ($m_{p}\\sim10^{21}-10^{25}g$) \\emph{through gas dynamical\nfriction} (GDF). A significant fraction of all Solar system planetesimals\n(asteroids and Kuiper-belt objects) are known to be binary planetesimals (BPs).\nHere, we explore the effects of GDF on the evolution of \\emph{binary}\nplanetesimals embedded in a gaseous disk using an N-body code with a fiducial\nexternal force accounting for GDF. We find that GDF can induce binary mergers\non timescales shorter than the disk lifetime for masses above\n$m_{p}\\gtrsim10^{22}g$ at 1AU, independent of the binary initial separation and\neccentricity. Such mergers can affect the structure of merger-formed\nplanetesimals, and the GDF-induced binary inspiral can play a role in the\nevolution of the planetesimal disk. In addition, binaries on eccentric orbits\naround the star may evolve in the supersonic regime, where the torque reverses\nand the binary expands, which would enhance the cross section for planetesimal\nencounters with the binary. Highly inclined binaries with small mass ratios,\nevolve due to the combined effects of Kozai-Lidov cycles with GDF which lead to\nchaotic evolution. Prograde binaries go through semi-regular Kozai-Lidov\nevolution, while retrograde binaries frequently flip their inclination and\n$\\sim50\\%$ of them are destroyed.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed comparison of the bottom production in\ngluon -- gluon, photon -- gluon, photon -- photon, pomeron -- gluon, pomeron --\npomeron and pomeron -- photon interactions at the LHC. The transverse momentum,\npseudo -- rapidity and $\\xi$ dependencies of the cross sections are calculated\nat LHC energy using the Forward Physics Monte Carlo (FPMC), which allows to\nobtain realistic predictions for the bottom production with one or two leading\nintact protons. Moreover, predictions for the the kinematical range probed by\nthe LHCb Collaboration are also presented. Our results indicate that the\nanalysis of the single diffractive events is feasible using the Run I LHCb\ndata.\n", "  We reexamine the improved effective vector boson approximation which is based\non two-vector-boson luminosities $\\mathrm{\\mathbf{L}}_{\\rm pol}$ for the\ncomputation of weak gauge-boson hard scattering subprocesses $V_1 V_2\\to {\\cal\nW}$ in high-energy hadron-hadron or $e^-e^+$ collisions. We calculate these\nluminosities for the nine combinations of the transverse and longitudinal\npolarizations of $V_1$ and $V_2$ in the unitary and axial gauge. For these two\ngauge choices the quality of this approach is investigated for the reactions\n$e^-e^+ \\to W^- W^+ \\nu_e {\\bar\\nu}_e$ and $e^-e^+ \\to t {\\bar t} \\nu_e\n{\\bar\\nu}_e$ using appropriate phase-space cuts.\n", "  We investigate the caustic topologies for binary gravitational lenses made up\nof two objects whose gravitational potential declines as $1/r^n$. With $n<1$\nthis corresponds to power-law dust distributions like the singular isothermal\nsphere. The $n>1$ regime can be obtained with some violations of the energy\nconditions, one famous example being the Ellis wormhole. Gravitational lensing\nprovides a natural arena to distinguish and identify such exotic objects in our\nUniverse. We find that there are still three topologies for caustics as in the\nstandard Schwarzschild binary lens, with the main novelty coming from the\nsecondary caustics of the close topology, which become huge at higher $n$.\nAfter drawing caustics by numerical methods, we derive a large amount of\nanalytical formulae in all limits that are useful to provide deeper insight in\nthe mathematics of the problem. Our study is useful to better understand the\nphenomenology of galaxy lensing in clusters as well as the distinct signatures\nof exotic matter in complex systems.\n", "  Ideal Weyl semimetals with all Weyl nodes exactly at the Fermi level and no\ncoexisting trivial Fermi surfaces in the bulk, similar to graphene, could\nfeature deep physics such as exotic transport phenomena induced by the chiral\nanomaly. Here, we show that HgTe and half-Heusler compounds, under a broad\nrange of in-plane compressive strain, could be materials in nature realizing\nideal Weyl semimetals with four pairs of Weyl nodes and topological surface\nFermi arcs. Generically, we find that the HgTe-class materials with nontrivial\nband inversion and noncentrosymmetry provide a promising arena to realize ideal\nWeyl semimetals. Such ideal Weyl semimetals could further provide a unique\nplatform to study emergent phenomena such as the interplay between ideal Weyl\nfermions and superconductivity in the half-Heusler compound LaPtBi.\n", "  We study correlations and magnetic textures of localized spins, doped in\nthree-dimensional Dirac semimetals. An effective field theory for magnetic\nmoments is constructed by integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom. The\nspin correlation shows a strong anisotropy, originating from spin-momentum\nlocking of Dirac electrons, in addition to the conventional Heisenberg-like\nferromagnetic correlation. The anisotropic spin correlation allows\ntopologically nontrivial magnetic excitation textures such as a transient\nhedgehog state, as well as the ferromagnetic ground state. The spin-wave\ndispersion in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal also becomes anisotropic, being less\ndispersed perpendicular to the magnetization.\n", "  The relation between entanglement and nonlocality is discussed in the case of\nmultipartite quantum systems. We show that, for any number of parties, there\nexist genuinely multipartite entangled states which admit a fully local hidden\nvariable model, i.e. where all parties are separated. Hence, although these\nstates are entangled in the strongest possible sense, they cannot lead to Bell\ninequality violation considering general non-sequential local measurements.\nThen, we show that the nonlocality of these states can nevertheless be\nactivated using sequences of local measurements, thus revealing genuine\nmultipartite hidden nonlocality.\n", "  Background: At high density deconfinement of hadronic matter may occur\nleading to quark matter. The immense densities reached in the inner core of\nmassive neutron stars may be sufficient to facilitate the transition. Purpose:\nTo investigate a crossover transition between two phenomenological models which\nepitomise QCD in two different regimes, while incorporating the influence of\nquark degrees of freedom in both. Method: We use the Hartree-Fock quark-meson\ncoupling model and the proper time regularised three flavour NJL model to\ndescribe hadronic and quark matter, respectively. Hybrid equations of state are\nobtained by interpolating the energy density as a function of total baryonic\ndensity and calculating the pressure. Results: Equations of state for hadronic,\nquark and hybrid matter and the resulting mass versus radius curves for hybrid\nstars are shown, as well as other relevant physical quantities such as species\nfractions and the speed of sound in matter. Conclusions: The observations of\nmassive neutron stars can certainly be explained within such a construction.\nHowever, the so-called thermodynamic correction arising from an interpolation\nmethod can have a considerable impact on the equation of state. The\ninterpolation dependency of and physical meaning behind such corrections\nrequire further study.\n", "  We study jet substructures of a boosted polarized top quark, which undergoes\nthe hadronic decay $t\\to b u\\bar d$, in the perturbative QCD framework,\nfocusing on the energy profile and the differential energy profile. These\nsubstructures are factorized into the convolution of a hard top-quark decay\nkernel with a bottom-quark jet function and a $W$-boson jet function, where the\nlatter is further factorized into the convolution of a hard $W$-boson decay\nkernel with two light-quark jet functions. Computing the hard kernels to\nleading order in QCD and including the resummation effect in the jet functions,\nwe show that the differential jet energy profile is a useful observable for\ndifferentiating the helicity of a boosted hadronic top quark: a right-handed\ntop jet exhibits quick descent of the differential energy profile with the\ninner test cone radius $r$, which is attributed to the $\\mbox{V-A}$ structure\nof weak interaction and the dead-cone effect associated with the $W$-boson jet.\nThe above helicity differentiation may help to reveal the chiral structure of\nphysics beyond the Standard Model at high energies.\n", "  The surface energy, the one-particle distribution function of electrons, etc.\nof a semi-bounded metal within the framework of the semi-infinite jellium are\ncalculated. The influence of the potential barrier height on these\ncharacteristics is studied. The barrier height is found from the condition of\nthe minimum of the surface energy. The surface energy is positive in the entire\ndomain of the Wigner-Seitz radius of metals, and it is in sufficiently good\nagreement with experimental data.\n", "  We have performed long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the cubic\nand tetragonal phases of the solid lithium-ion--electrolyte\nLi$_{7}$La$_{3}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{12}$ (LLZO), using a first-principles parameterised\ninteratomic potential. Collective lithium transport was analysed by identifying\ndynamical excitations; persistent ion displacements over distances comparable\nto the separation between lithium sites, and string-like clusters of ions that\nundergo cooperative motion. We find that dynamical excitations in c-LLZO are\nfrequent, with participating lithium numbers following an exponential\ndistribution, mirroring the dynamics of fragile glasses. In contrast,\nexcitations in t-LLZO are both temporally and spatially sparse, consisting\npreferentially of highly concerted lithium motion around closed loops. This\nqualitative difference is explained as a consequence of lithium ordering in\nt-LLZO, and provides a mechanistic basis for the much lower ionic conductivity\nof t-LLZO compared to c-LLZO.\n", "  We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations of the\nsuper-Earth 55 Cancri e, in the near infrared, obtained with the WFC3 camera\nonboard the HST. 55 Cancri e orbits so close to its parent star, that\ntemperatures much higher than 2000 K are expected on its surface. Given the\nbrightness of 55 Cancri, the observations were obtained in scanning mode,\nadopting a very long scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our\nspecialized pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these\nobservational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions of the\ninstrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average\nrelative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find modulations that depart from\na straight line model with a 6$\\sigma$ confidence level. These results suggest\nthat 55 Cancri e is surrounded by an atmosphere, which is probably\nhydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code, T-REx, has\nidentified HCN to be the most likely molecular candidate able to explain the\nfeatures at 1.42 and 1.54 $\\mu$m. While additional spectroscopic observations\nin a broader wavelength range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN\ndetection, we discuss here the implications of such result. Our chemical model,\ndeveloped with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high mixing\nratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result suggests this\nsuper-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic than previously\nthought.\n", "  The effect of kinetic helicity (velocity--vorticity correlation) on turbulent\nmomentum transport is investigated. The turbulent kinetic helicity\n(pseudoscalar) enters the Reynolds stress (mirrorsymmetric tensor) expression\nin the form of a helicity gradient as the coupling coefficient for the mean\nvorticity and/or the angular velocity (axial vector), which suggests the\npossibility of mean-flow generation in the presence of inhomogeneous helicity.\nThis inhomogeneous helicity effect, which was previously confirmed at the level\nof a turbulence- or closure-model simulation, is examined with the aid of\ndirect numerical simulations of rotating turbulence with non-uniform helicity\nsustained by an external forcing. The numerical simulations show that the\nspatial distribution of the Reynolds stress is in agreement with the\nhelicity-related term coupled with the angular velocity, and that a large-scale\nflow is generated in the direction of angular velocity. Such a large-scale flow\nis not induced in the case of homogeneous turbulent helicity. This result\nconfirms the validity of the inhomogeneous helicity effect in large-scale flow\ngeneration and suggests that a vortex dynamo is possible even in incompressible\nturbulence where there is no baroclinicity effect.\n", "  We study the charged impurity limited mobility in black phosphorus, a highly\nanisotropic layered material. We compute the mobility within the Boltzmann\ntransport equation under detailed balance condition, and taking into account\nthe anisotropy in transport and electronic structure. For carrier densities\naccessible in experiments, we obtained an anisotropy ratio of 3 ~ 4 at zero\ntemperature, two-folds larger than that observed in experiments on multilayers\nsamples. We discuss also how the anisotropy depends on carrier density and\nimpurity distribution.\n", "  The exchange of \"information\" between a system and its environment based on\nthe reduced dynamics is investigated. The association of trace distance with\ninformation cannot be stated, because of lack of symmetry between leakage from\nthe system and absorbability by the environment. A measure of loss for the\nreduced dynamics is established, which may be seen as a deviation from exact\nunitary dynamics.\n", "  The cosmological Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identity of the Einstein-Hilbert action\ncoupled to a single inflaton field is obtained from the\nBecchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry associated with diffeomorphism\ninvariance in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism. The consistency\nconditions between the correlators of the scalar and tensor modes in the\nsqueezed limit are then derived from the ST identity, together with the softly\nbroken conformal symmetry. Maldacena's original relations connecting the 2- and\n3-point correlators at horizon crossing are recovered, as well as the\nnext-to-leading corrections, controlled by the special conformal\ntransformations.\n", "  We explore the quark mass effects on inclusive hadron production in\nproton-nucleus collisions at high energies. We consider two processes. First,\nwe compute the single inclusive cross-section for production of hadrons with\nopen heavy flavour in the proton forward direction at leading order. Next, in\nthe same kinematics, we calculate the heavy-quark contribution to single\ninclusive production of light or unidentified hadrons at next-to-leading-order.\nFor both studies we exploit the hybrid formalism, that is the collinear\nfactorisation on the proton side while high-density and high-energy effects are\nresummed on the side of the nucleus.\n", "  We model the impact of non-uniform cloud cover on transit transmission\nspectra. Patchy clouds exist in nearly every solar system atmosphere, brown\ndwarfs, and transiting exoplanets. Our major findings suggest that fractional\ncloud coverage can exactly mimic high mean molecular weight atmospheres and\nvice-versa over certain wavelength regions, in particular, over the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) bandpass (1.1-1.7 $\\mu$m). We\nalso find that patchy cloud coverage exhibits a signature that is different\nfrom uniform global clouds. Furthermore, we explain analytically why the\n\"patchy cloud-high mean molecular weight\" degeneracy exists. We also explore\nthe degeneracy of non-uniform cloud coverage in atmospheric retrievals on both\nsynthetic and real planets. We find from retrievals on a synthetic solar\ncomposition hot Jupiter with patchy clouds and a cloud free high mean molecular\nweight warm Neptune, that both cloud free high mean molecular weight\natmospheres and partially cloudy atmospheres can explain the data equally well.\nAnother key find is that the HST WFC3 transit transmission spectra of two well\nobserved objects, the hot Jupiter HD189733b and the warm Neptune HAT-P-11b, can\nbe explained well by solar composition atmospheres with patchy clouds without\nthe need to invoke high mean molecular weight or global clouds. The degeneracy\nbetween high molecular weight and solar composition partially cloudy\natmospheres can be broken by observing the molecular Rayleigh scattering\ndifferences between the two. Furthermore, the signature of partially cloudy\nlimbs also appears as a $\\sim$100 ppm residual in the ingress and egress of the\ntransit light curves, provided the transit timing is known to seconds.\n", "  We study the correlation between the value of the triple Higgs coupling and\nthe nature of the electroweak phase transition. We use an effective potential\napproach, including higher order, non-renormalizable terms coming from\nintegrating out new physics. We show that if only the dimension six operators\nare considered, large positive deviations of the triple Higgs coupling from its\nStandard Model (SM) value are predicted in the regions of parameter space\nconsistent with a strong first order electroweak phase transition (SFOEPT). We\nalso show that at higher orders sizable and negative deviations of the triple\nHiggs coupling may be obtained, and the sign of the corrections tends to be\ncorrelated with the order of the phase transition. We also consider a singlet\nextension of the SM, which allows us to establish the connection with the\neffective field theory (EFT) approach and analyze the limits of its validity.\nFurthermore, we study how to probe the triple Higgs coupling from the double\nHiggs production at the LHC. We show that selective cuts in the invariant mass\nof the two Higgs bosons should be used, to maximize the sensitivity for values\nof the triple Higgs coupling significantly different from the Standard Model\none.\n", "  We construct models of static, spherically symmetric shells supported by the\nradiation flux of a luminous neutron star in the Schwarzschild metric. The\natmospheres are disconnected from the star and levitate above its surface. Gas\npressure and density inversion appear in the inner region of these atmospheres,\nwhich is a purely relativistic phenomenon. We account for the scattering\nopacity dependence on temperature and utilize the relativistic M1 closure\nscheme for the radiation tensor, hence allowing for a fully GR-consistent\ntreatment of the photon flux and radiation tensor anisotropy. In this way we\nare able to address atmospheres of both large and moderate/low optical depths\nwith the same set of equations. We discuss properties of the levitating\natmospheres and find that they may indeed be optically thick, with the distance\nbetween star surface and the photosphere expanding as luminosity increases.\nThese results may be relevant for the photosphereric radius expansion X-ray\nbursts.\n", "  We consider a general criterion to discern the nature of the threshold in\nepidemic models on scale-free (SF) networks. Comparing the epidemic lifespan of\nthe nodes with largest degrees with the infection time between them, we propose\na general dual scenario, in which the epidemic transition is either ruled by a\nhub activation process, leading to a null threshold in the thermodynamic limit,\nor given by a collective activation process, corresponding to a standard phase\ntransition with a finite threshold. We validate the proposed criterion applying\nit to different epidemic models, with waning immunity or heterogeneous\ninfection rates in both synthetic and real SF networks. In particular, a waning\nimmunity, irrespective of its strength, leads to collective activation with\nfinite threshold in scale-free networks with large exponent, at odds with\ncanonical theoretical approaches.\n", "  We interpret the newly discovered pentaquark $P_c(4450)$ as a bound state of\ncharmonium $\\psi(2S)$ and the nucleon. The binding potential is due to\ncharmonium-nucleon interaction that in the heavy quark approximation is\nproportional to the product of the charmonium chromoelectric polarizability and\nthe nucleon energy-momentum distribution. We use the large $N_c$ expansion to\nestimate the quarkonium polarizability and calculate the nucleon properties in\nthe framework of the mean-field picture of light baryons. Two almost degenerate\nstates $J^P=(1/2)^-$ and $J^P=(3/2)^-$ are predicted at the position of the\n$P_c(4450)$ pentaquark. We find that the nucleon-$\\psi(2S)$ bound state has a\nnaturally narrow width in the range of tens of MeV. The unitary multiplet\npartners of the $P_c(4450)$ pentaquark and the generalization to $b \\bar\nb$-nucleon pentaquark bound states are discussed.\n", "  The basis for the application of Thomson scattering to the analysis of\ncoronagraph images has been laid decades ago.Even though the basic formulation\nis undebated, a discussion has grown in recent years about the spatial\ndistribution of Thomson scatter sensitivity in the corona and the inner\nheliosphere. These notes are an attempt to clarify the understanding of this\ntopic. We reformulate the classical scattering calculations in a more\ntransparent way using modern SI-compatible quantities extended to field\ncorrelation matrices. The resulting concise formulation is easily extended to\nthe case of relativistic electrons. For relativistic electrons we calculate the\nStokes parameters of the scattered radiation and determine changes in degree\nand orientation of its polarisation, blue-shift and radiant intensities\ndepending on the electron velocity magnitude and direction. We discuss the\nprobability to see these relativistic effects in white-light coronagraph\nobservations of the solar corona. Many mathematical and some basic physical\ningredients are made explicit in several chapters of the appendix.\n", "  The identification of jets containing $b$ hadrons is important for the\nphysics programme of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Several\nalgorithms to identify jets containing $b$ hadrons are described, ranging from\nthose based on the reconstruction of an inclusive secondary vertex or the\npresence of tracks with large impact parameters to combined tagging algorithms\nmaking use of multi-variate discriminants. An independent $b$-tagging algorithm\nbased on the reconstruction of muons inside jets as well as the $b$-tagging\nalgorithm used in the online trigger are also presented.The $b$-jet tagging\nefficiency, the $c$-jet tagging efficiency and the mistag rate for light\nflavour jets in data have been measured with a number of complementary methods.\nThe calibration results are presented as scale factors defined as the ratio of\nthe efficiency (or mistag rate) in data to that in simulation. In the case of\n$b$ jets, where more than one calibration method exists, the results from the\nvarious analyses have been combined taking into account the statistical\ncorrelation as well as the correlation of the sources of systematic\nuncertainty.\n", "  We present CO velocity fields and rotation curves for a sample of nearby\ngalaxies, based on data from the HERACLES survey. We combine our data with\nliterature THINGS, SINGS and KINGFISH results to provide a comprehensive sample\nof mass models of disk galaxies inclusive of molecular gas. We compare the\nkinematics of the molecular (CO from HERACLES) and atomic (${\\rm H{\\scriptstyle\nI}}$ from THINGS) gas distributions to determine the extent to which CO may be\nused to probe the dynamics in the inner part of galaxies. In general, we find\ngood agreement between the CO and ${\\rm H{\\scriptstyle I}}$ kinematics with\nsmall differences in the inner part of some galaxies. We add the contribution\nof the molecular gas to the mass models in our galaxies by using two different\nconversion factors $\\mathrm{\\alpha_{CO}}$ to convert CO luminosity to molecular\ngas mass surface density - the constant Milky Way value and the radially\nvarying profiles determined in recent work based on THINGS, HERACLES and\nKINGFISH data. We study the relative effect that the addition of the molecular\ngas has upon the halo rotation curves for Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and the\nobservationally motivated pseudo-isothermal halos. The contribution of the\nmolecular gas varies for galaxies in our sample - for those galaxies where\nthere is a substantial molecular gas content, using different values of\n$\\mathrm{\\alpha_{CO}}$ can result in significant differences to the relative\ncontribution of the molecular gas and, hence, the shape of the dark matter halo\nrotation curves in the central regions of galaxies.\n", "  We present the first experimental characterization of the azimuthal Wigner\ndistribution of a photon. Our protocol fully characterizes the transverse\nstructure of a photon in conjugate bases of orbital angular momentum (OAM) and\nazimuthal angle (ANG). We provide a test of our protocol by characterizing pure\nsuperpositions and incoherent mixtures of OAM modes in a seven-dimensional\nspace. The time required for performing measurements in our scheme scales only\nlinearly with the dimension size of the state under investigation. This time\nscaling makes our technique suitable for quantum information applications\ninvolving a large number of OAM states.\n", "  According to the Coleman-Mandula theorem, any gauge theory of gravity\ncombined with an internal symmetry based on a Lie group must take the form of a\ndirect product in order to be consistent with basic assumptions of quantum\nfield theory. However, we show that an alternative gauging of a simple group\ncan lead dynamically to a spacetime with compact internal symmetry. The\nbiconformal gauging of the conformal symmetry of n-dim Euclidean space doubles\nthe dimension to give a symplectic manifold. Examining one of the Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds in the flat case, we find that in addition to the expected SO(n)\nconnection and curvature, the solder form necessarily becomes Lorentzian.\nGeneral coordinate invariance gives rise to an SO(n-1,1) connection on the\nspacetime. The principal fiber bundle character of the original SO(n)\nguarantees that the two symmetries enter as a direct product, in agreement with\nthe Coleman-Mandula theorem.\n", "  Employing the relativistic coupled-cluster method, comparative studies of the\nparity non-conserving electric dipole amplitudes for the $7s \\ ^2S_{1/2}\n\\rightarrow 6d \\ ^2D_{5/2}$ transitions in $^{210}$Fr and $^{211}$Fr isotopes\nhave been carried out. It is found that these transition amplitudes, sensitive\nonly to the nuclear spin dependent effects, are enhanced by more than 3 orders\ncompared to the low-lying $S-D_{5/2}$ transitions in Ba$^+$ and Ra$^+$ owing to\nthe very large contributions from the electron core-polarization effects in Fr.\nThis translates to a relatively large and, in principle, measurable induced\nlight shift, which would be a signature of nuclear spin dependent parity\nnonconservation that is dominated by the nuclear anapole moment in a heavy atom\nlike Fr. A plausible scheme to measure this quantity using the Cyclotron and\nRadioisotope Center (CYRIC) facility at Tohoku University has been outlined.\n", "  We identify the deviation from the straight line error (DSLE) -- i.e., the\nspurious non-linearity of the total energy as a function of fractional particle\nnumber -- as the main source for the discrepancy between experimental vertical\nionization energies and theoretical quasiparticle energies, as obtained from\nthe $GW$ and $GW$+SOSEX approximations to many-body perturbation theory (MBPT).\nFor self-consistent calculations, we show that $GW$ suffers from a small DSLE.\nConversely, for perturbative $G_0W_0$ and $G_0W_0$+SOSEX calculations the DSLE\ndepends on the starting point. We exploit this starting-point dependence to\nreduce (or completely eliminate) the DSLE. We find that the agreement with\nexperiment increases as the DSLE reduces. DSLE-minimized schemes, thus, emerge\nas promising avenues for future developments in MBPT.\n", "  The $XY$ model with four-body quenched disordered interactions and its\ndiscrete $p$-clock proxy is studied on bipartite random graphs by means of the\ncavity method. The phase diagrams are determined from the ordered case to the\nspin-glass case. Dynamic, spinodal and thermodynamic transition lines are\nidentified by analyzing free energy, complexity and tree reconstruction\nfunctions as temperature and disorder are changed. The study of the convergence\nof the $p$-clock model to the $XY$ model is performed down to temperature low\nenough to determine all relevant transition points for different connectivity.\n", "  Vertically extended, high velocity dispersion stellar distributions appear to\nbe a ubiquitous feature of disc galaxies, and both internal and external\nmechanisms have been proposed to be the major driver of their formation.\nHowever, it is unclear to what extent each mechanism can generate such a\ndistribution, which is likely to depend on the assembly history of the galaxy.\nTo this end, we perform 16 high resolution cosmological-zoom simulations of\nMilky Way-sized galaxies using the state-of-the-art cosmological\nmagneto-hydrodynamical code \\textlcsc{AREPO}, and analyse the evolution of the\nvertical kinematics of the stellar disc in connection with various heating\nmechanisms. We find that the bar is the dominant heating mechanism in most\ncases, whereas spiral arms, radial migration, and adiabatic heating from\nmid-plane density growth are all sub-dominant. The strongest source, though\nless prevalent than bars, originates from external perturbations from\nsatellites/sub-halos of masses log$_{10} (M/\\rm M_{\\odot}) \\gtrsim 10$.\nHowever, in many simulations the orbits of newborn star particles become cooler\nwith time, such that they dominate the shape of the age-velocity dispersion\nrelation and overall vertical disc structure unless a strong external\nperturbation takes place.\n", "  Scalar and gravitational perturbations on Kerr-anti-de Sitter (Kerr-AdS)\nblack holes have been addressed in the literature and have been shown to\nexhibit a rich phenomenology. In this paper we complete the analysis of bosonic\nfields on this background by studying Maxwell perturbations, focusing on\nsuperradiant instabilities and vector clouds. For this purpose, we solve the\nTeukolsky equations numerically, imposing the boundary conditions we have\nproposed in\\cite{Wang:2015goa} for the radial Teukolsky equation. As found\ntherein, two Robin boundary conditions can be imposed for Maxwell fields on\nKerr-AdS black holes, one of which produces a new set of quasinormal modes even\nfor Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. Here, we show these different boundary\nconditions produce two different sets of superradiant modes. Interestingly the\n\"new modes\" may be unstable in a larger parameter space. We then study\nstationary Maxwell clouds, that exist at the threshold of the superradiant\ninstability, with the two Robin boundary conditions. These clouds, obtained at\nthe linear level, indicate the existence of a new family of black hole\nsolutions at the nonlinear level, within the Einstein-Maxwell-AdS system,\nbranching off from the Kerr-Newman-AdS family. As a comparison with the Maxwell\nclouds, scalar clouds on Kerr-AdS black holes are also studied, and it is shown\nthere are Kerr-AdS black holes that are stable against scalar, but not vector\nmodes, with the same \"quantum numbers\".\n", "  Standard accretion disk models suggest that the snow line in the solar nebula\nmigrated interior to the Earth's orbit in a late stage of nebula evolution. In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the\nsolar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved\ninto icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow.\nIf the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the\ndensity deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was\npossible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line\nmigration.\n", "  Spin-independent cross-section for neutralino dark matter scattering off\nnuclei is investigated in the NMSSM. Several classes of blind spots for direct\ndetection of singlino-Higgsino dark matter are analytically identified,\nincluding such that have no analog in the MSSM. It is shown that mixing of the\nHiggs doublets with the scalar singlet has a big impact on the position of\nblind spots in the parameter space. In particular, this mixing allows for more\nfreedom in the sign assignment for the parameters entering the neutralino mass\nmatrix, required for a blind spot to occur, as compared to the MSSM or the\nNMSSM with decoupled singlet. Moreover, blind spots may occur for any\ncomposition of a singlino-Higgsino LSP. Particular attention is paid to cases\nwith the singlet-dominated scalar lighter than the 125 GeV Higgs for which a\nvanishing tree-level spin-independent scattering cross-section may result from\ndestructive interference between the Higgs and the singlet-dominated scalar\nexchange. Correlations of the spin-independent scattering cross-section with\nthe Higgs observables are also discussed.\n", "  The pion-photon transition form factor is studied by employing two types of\nSum Rules: Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSR) and Anomaly Sum Rules (ASR). By\ncomparing the predictions for the pion-photon transition form factor, obtained\nfrom these two approaches, the applicability limit of the LCSRs at low momenta\nis determined. Reciprocally, the ASR threshold dependence on the momentum was\nextracted using our LCSR-based method in combination with two different types\nof pion distribution amplitudes and found that at higher Q2 it approaches a\nconstant.\n", "  Understanding the observed Cold Spot (CS) (temperature of ~ -150 mu K at its\ncentre) on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is an outstanding problem.\nExplanations vary from assuming it is just a > 3 sigma primordial Gaussian\nfluctuation to the imprint of a supervoid via the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and\nRees-Sciama (ISW+RS) effects. Since single spherical supervoids cannot account\nfor the full profile, the ISW+RS of multiple line-of-sight voids is studied\nhere to mimic the structure of the cosmic web. Two structure configurations are\nconsidered. The first, through simulations of 20 voids, produces a central mean\ntemperature of ~-50 mu K. In this model the central CS temperature lies at ~ 2\nsigma but fails to explain the CS hot ring. An alternative multi-void model\n(using more pronounced compensated voids) produces much smaller temperature\nprofiles, but contains a prominent hot ring. Arrangements containing closely\nplaced voids at low redshift are found to be particularly well suited to\nproduce CS-like profiles. We then measure the significance of the CS if CS-like\nprofiles (which are fitted to the ISW+RS of multi-void scenarios) are removed.\nThe CS tension with the LCDM model can be reduced dramatically for an array of\ntemperature profiles smaller than the CS itself.\n", "  We study the large N expansion of the partition function of the quiver\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theories deformed by two continuous parameters\nwhich correspond to the general R-charge assignment to the matter fields.\nThough the deformation breaks the conformal symmetry, we find that the\npartition function shares various structures with the superconformal cases,\nsuch as the Airy function expression of the perturbative expansion in 1/N with\nthe overall constant A(k) related to the constant map in the ABJM case through\na simple rescaling of k. We also identify five kinds of the non-perturbative\neffects in 1/N which correspond to the membrane instantons. The instanton\nexponents and the singular structure of the coefficients depend on the\ncontinuous deformation parameters, in contrast to the superconformal case where\nall the parameters are integers associated with the orbifold action on the\nmoduli space. This implies that the singularity of the instanton effects would\nbe observable also in the gravity side.\n", "  In this study, we give a thorough analysis of a general affine gravity with\ntorsion. After a brief exposition of the affine gravities considered by\nEddington and Schr\\\"{o}dinger, we construct and analyze different affine\ngravities based on the determinants of the Ricci tensor, the torsion tensor,\nthe Riemann tensor and their combinations. In each case we reduce equations of\nmotion to their simplest forms and give a detailed analysis of their solutions.\nOur analyses lead to the construction of the affine connection in terms of the\ncurvature and torsion tensors. Our solutions of the dynamical equations show\nthat the curvature tensors at different points are correlated via non-local,\nexponential rescaling factors determined by the torsion tensor.\n", "  The well-known Migdal-Luttinger theorem states that the jump of the\nsingle-nucleon momentum distribution at the Fermi surface is equal to the\ninverse of the nucleon effective E-mass. Recent experiments studying\nshort-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei using electron-nucleus scatterings at\nthe Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB) together with model calculations\nconstrained significantly the Migdal-Luttinger jump at saturation density of\nnuclear matter. We show that the corresponding nucleon effective E-mass is\nconsequently constrained to $M_0^{\\ast,\\rm{E}}/M\\approx2.22\\pm0.35$ in\nsymmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and the E-mass of neutrons is smaller than that\nof protons in neutron-rich matter. Moreover, the average depletion of the\nnucleon Fermi sea increases (decreases) approximately linearly with the isospin\nasymmetry $\\delta$ according to $\\kappa_{\\rm{p}/\\rm{n}}\\approx 0.21\\pm0.06 \\pm\n(0.19\\pm0.08)\\delta$ for protons (neutrons). These results will help improve\nour knowledge about the space-time non-locality of the single-nucleon potential\nin neutron-rich nucleonic matter useful in both nuclear physics and\nastrophysics.\n", "  We measure the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in the radiative-penguin decay\n$B^0 \\to {{K^0_{S}}} \\pi^- \\pi^+ \\gamma$, using a sample of $471$ million\n$\\Upsilon(4S) \\to B{\\kern 0.18em\\overline{\\kern -0.18em B}}$ events recorded\nwith the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ storage ring at SLAC. Using\nevents with $m_{K\\pi\\pi}<1.8{\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V/}c^2}$, we measure the\nbranching fractions of $B^+ \\to K^+ \\pi^- \\pi^+ \\gamma$ and $B^0 \\to K^0 \\pi^+\n\\pi^- \\gamma$, the branching fractions of the kaonic resonances decaying to\n$K^+ \\pi^- \\pi^+$, as well as the overall branching fractions of the $B^+ \\to\n\\rho^0 K^+ \\gamma$, $B^+ \\to K^{*0} \\pi^+ \\gamma$ and S-wave $B^+ \\to (K\n\\pi)^{*0}_0 \\pi^+ \\gamma$ components. For events from the $\\rho$ mass band, we\nmeasure the $CP$-violating parameters\n${\\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma}} = 0.14 \\pm 0.25 \\pm 0.03$ and\n${\\mathcal{C}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma}} = -0.39 \\pm 0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$,\nwhere the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. We\nextract from this measurement the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry related to the\n$CP$ eigenstate $\\rho^0 {{K^0_{S}}}$ and obtain\n${\\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\\rho\\gamma}} = -0.18 \\pm 0.32^{+ 0.06}_{-0.05}$,\nwhich provides information on the photon polarization in the underlying $b \\to\ns \\gamma$ transition.\n", "  We present a large-$S$ study of a quantum spin ice Hamiltonian, introduced by\nHuang, et al., [PRL 112, 167203 (2014)], on the kagome lattice. This model\ninvolves a competition between the frustrating Ising term of classical kagome\nice, a Zeeman magnetic field $h$,and a nearest-neighbor transverse spin-flip\nterm $S^x_iS^x_j - S^y_iS^y_j$. Recent Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations by\nCarrasquilla, et al., [Nature Communications, 6, 7421, (2015)], uncovered lobes\nof a disordered phase for large Ising interaction and $h\\neq 0$ -- a putative\nquantum spin liquid phase. Here, we examine the nature of this model using\nlarge-$S$ expansion. We show that the ground state properties generally have\nthe same trends with those observed in QMC simulations. In particular, the\nlarge-$S$ ground state phase diagram captures the existence of the disordered\nlobes.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect is deemed to be a unique transport property of\nferromagnetic metals, caused by the concerted action of spin polarization and\nspin-orbit coupling. Nevertheless, recent experiments have shown that the\neffect also occurs in a nonmagnetic metal (Pt) in contact with a magnetic\ninsulator (yttrium iron garnet (YIG)), even when precautions are taken to\nensure there is no induced magnetization in the metal. We propose a theory of\nthis effect based on the combined action of spin-dependent scattering from the\nmagnetic interface and the spin Hall effect in the bulk of the metal. At\nvariance with previous theories, we predict the effect to be of first order in\nthe spin-orbit coupling, just as the conventional anomalous Hall effect -- the\nonly difference being the spatial separation of the spin orbit interaction and\nthe magnetization. For this reason we name this effect \\textit{nonlocal\nanomalous Hall effect} and predict that its sign will be determined by the sign\nof the spin Hall angle in the metal. The AH conductivity that we calculate from\nour theory is in good agreement with the measured values in Pt/YIG structures.\n", "  Determining the number of stable phase-locked solutions for locally coupled\nKuramoto models is a long-standing mathematical problem with important\nimplications in biology, condensed matter physics and electrical engineering\namong others. We investigate Kuramoto models on networks with various\ntopologies and show that different phase-locked solutions are related to one\nanother by loop currents. The latter take only discrete values, as they are\ncharacterized by topological winding numbers. This result is generically valid\nfor any network, and also applies beyond the Kuramoto model, as long as the\ncoupling between oscillators is antisymmetric in the oscillators' coordinates.\nMotivated by these results we further investigate loop currents in\nKuramoto-like models. We consider loop currents in nonoriented $n$-node cycle\nnetworks with nearest-neighbor coupling. Amplifying on earlier works, we give\nan algebraic upper bound $\\mathcal{N} \\le 2 \\, {\\rm Int}[n/4]+1$ for the number\n$\\cal N$ of different, linearly stable phase-locked solutions. We show that the\nnumber of different stable solutions monotonically decreases as the coupling\nstrength is decreased. Furthermore stable solutions with a single angle\ndifference exceeding $\\pi/2$ emerge as the coupling constant $K$ is reduced, as\nsmooth continuations of solutions with all angle differences smaller than\n$\\pi/2$ at higher $K$. In a cycle network with nearest-neighbor coupling we\nfurther show that phase-locked solutions with two or more angle differences\nlarger than $\\pi/2$ are all linearly unstable. We point out similarities\nbetween loop currents and vortices in superfluids and superconductors as well\nas persistent currents in superconducting rings and two-dimensional Josephson\njunction arrays.\n", "  We investigate the Drude weight and the related Mazur-Suzuki (MS) bound in a\nbroad variety of strongly coupled field theories with a gravity dual at finite\ntemperature and chemical potential. We revisit the derivation of the recently\nproposed universal expression for the Drude weight for Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton\n(EMd) theories and extend it to the case of theories with multiple massless\ngauge fields. We show that the MS bound, which in the context of condensed\nmatter provides information on the integrability of the theory, is saturated in\nthese holographic theories including R-charged backgrounds. We then explore the\nlimits of this universality by studying EMd theories with $U(1)$ spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and gravity duals of non-relativistic field theories\nincluding an asymptotically Lifshitz EMd model with two massless gauge fields\nand the Einstein-Proca model. In all these cases, the Drude weight, computed\nanalytically, deviates from the universal result and the MS bound is not\nsaturated. In general it is not possible to deduce the low temperature\ndependence of the Drude weight by simple dimensional analysis. Finally we study\nthe effect of a weak breaking of translational symmetry by coupling the EMd\naction, with and without $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking, to an axion\nfield. We show the coherent part of the conductivity in this limit is simply\nthe product of the MS bound and the scattering time obtained from the leading\nquasinormal mode. For asymptotically $AdS$ theories it seems that the MS bound\nsets a lower bound on the DC conductivity for a given scattering time.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos comprise an entire class of dark matter models that,\ndepending on their production mechanism, can be hot, warm, or cold dark matter.\nWe simulate the Local Group and representative volumes of the Universe in a\nvariety of sterile neutrino models, all of which are consistent with the\npossible existence of a radiative decay line at ~3.5 keV. We compare models of\nproduction via resonances in the presence of a lepton asymmetry (suggested by\nShi & Fuller 1999) to \"thermal\" models. We find that properties in the highly\nnonlinear regime - e.g., counts of satellites and internal properties of halos\nand subhalos - are insensitive to the precise fall-off in power with\nwavenumber, indicating that nonlinear evolution essentially washes away\ndifferences in the initial (linear) matter power spectrum. In the quasi-linear\nregime at higher redshifts, however, quantitative differences in the 3D matter\npower spectra remain, raising the possibility that such models can be tested\nwith future observations of the Lyman-alpha forest. While many of the sterile\nneutrino models largely eliminate multiple small-scale issues within the Cold\nDark Matter (CDM) paradigm, we show that these models may be ruled out in the\nnear future via discoveries of additional dwarf satellites in the Local Group.\n", "  Singular Mueller matrices play an important role in polarization algebra and\nhave peculiar properties that stem from the fact that either the medium\nexhibits maximum diattenuation and/or polarizance, or because its associated\ncanonical depolarizer has the property of fully randomizing, the circular\ncomponent (at least) of the states of polarization of light incident on it. The\nformal reasons for which the Mueller matrix M of a given medium is singular are\nsystematically investigated, analyzed and interpreted in the framework of the\nserial decompositions and the characteristic ellipsoids of M. The analysis\nallows for a general classification and geometric representation of singular\nMueller matrices, of potential usefulness to experimentalists dealing with such\nmedia.\n", "  We consider the anomalous dimensions of restricted Schur polynomials\nconstructed using n~O(N) complex adjoint scalars Z and m complex adjoint\nscalars Y. We fix m<<n so that our operators are almost half BPS. At leading\norder in m/n this system corresponds to a dilute gas of m free magnons. Adding\nthe first correction of order m/n to the anomalous dimension, which arises at\ntwo loops, we find non-zero magnon interactions. The form of this new operator\nmixing is studied in detail for a system of two giant gravitons with four\nstrings attached.\n", "  We investigate all possible noise environments for controlled remote state\npreparation. We find that the optimal efficiency is not only dependent on the\nisolate decay rate but also dependent on the coupling term of environments.\nSuch a coupling provides a clue to control the noisy quantum system for\nrealistic quantum communication. We show that, furthermore, the noise channel\ncan be used as an important resource for quantum information tasks. Especially,\nan approach is proposed to realize a perfect controlled remote state\npreparation under the noisy effects environments by choosing the noisy\nenvironments and adjusting their relations in terms of noisy rates.\n", "  This study examine the difference in the size of avalanches among industries\ntriggered by demand shocks, which can be rephrased by control of the economy or\nfiscal policy, and by using the production-inventory model and observed data.\nWe obtain the following results. (1) The size of avalanches follows power law.\n(2) The mean sizes of avalanches for industries are diverse but their standard\ndeviations highly overlap. (3) We compare the simulation with an input-output\ntable and with the actual policies. They are compatible.\n", "  We utilize electron counting techniques to distinguish a spin conserving fast\ntunneling process and a slower process involving spin flips in\nAlGaAs/GaAs-based double quantum dots. By studying the dependence of the rates\non the interdot tunnel coupling of the two dots, we find that as many as 4% of\nthe tunneling events occur with a spin flip related to spin-orbit coupling in\nGaAs. Our measurement has a fidelity of 99 % in terms of resolving whether a\ntunneling event occurred with a spin flip or not.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosion events in the\nuniverse. An amount of gravitational energy of the order of the rest-mass\nenergy of the Sun is released from a small region, within seconds or longer.\nThis should lead to the formation of a fireball of temperature in the MeV\nrange, consisting of electrons/positrons, photons, and a small fraction of\nbaryons. We exploit the potential of GRB fireballs for being a laboratory for\ntesting particle physics beyond the Standard Model, where we find that\nWeinberg's Higgs portal model serves as a good candidate for this purpose. Due\nto the resonance effects, the Goldstone bosons can be rapidly produced by\nelectron-positron annihilation process in the initial fireballs of the\ngamma-ray bursts. On the other hand, the mean free path of the Goldstone bosons\nis larger than the size of the GRB initial fireballs, so they are not coupled\nto the GRB's relativistic flow and can lead to significant energy loss. Using\ngeneric values for the GRB initial fireball energy, temperature, radius,\nexpansion rate, and baryon number density, we find that the GRB bounds on the\nparameters of Weinberg's Higgs portal model are indeed competitive to current\nlaboratory constraints.\n", "  We investigated\nSrFe$\\mathrm{_2}$(As$\\mathrm{_{1-x}}$P$\\mathrm{_x}$)$\\mathrm{_2}$ single\ncrystals with four different phosphorus concentrations x in the superconducting\nphase (x = 0.35, 0.46) and in the magnetic phase (x = 0, 0.2). The\nsuperconducting samples display a V-shaped superconducting gap, which suggests\nnodal superconductivity. Furthermore we determined the superconducting\ncoherence length by measuring the spatially resolved superconducting density of\nstates (DOS). Using inelastic tunneling spectroscopy we investigated\nexcitations in the samples with four different phosphorus concentrations.\nInelastic peaks are related to bosonic modes. Phonon and non-phonon mechanism\nfor the origin of these peaks are discussed.\n", "  Conventional in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states require two ingredients: magnetic\natoms and a superconducting host that, in the normal phase, has a finite\ndensity of states at the Fermi energy. Here we show that hydrogenated graphene\ncan host Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states without any of those two ingredients. Atomic\nhydrogen chemisorbed in graphene is known to act as paramagnetic center with a\nweakly localized magnetic moment. Our calculations for hydrogenated graphene in\nproximity to a superconductor show that individual adatoms induce in-gap\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov states with an exotic spectrum whereas chains of adatoms\nresult in a gapless Yu- Shiba-Rusinov band. Our predictions can be tested using\nstate of the art techniques, combining recent progress of atomic manipulation\nof atomic hydrogen on graphene together with the well tested proximity effect\nin graphene.\n", "  The theory of massive gravity proposed by Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend is\nconsidered in the special case of the pure irreducibly fourth order quadratic\nLagrangian. It is shown that the asymptotically locally flat black holes of\nthis theory can be consistently deformed to \"black flowers\" that are no longer\nspherically symmetric. Moreover, we construct radiating spacetimes settling\ndown to these black flowers in the far future. The generic case can be shown to\nfit within a relaxed set of asymptotic conditions as compared to the ones of\ngeneral relativity at null infinity, while the asymptotic symmetries remain the\nsame. Conserved charges as surface integrals at null infinity are constructed\nfollowing a covariant approach, and their algebra represents BMS$_{3}$, but\nwithout central extensions. For solutions possessing an event horizon, we\nderive the first law of thermodynamics from these surface integrals.\n", "  We discuss renormalization group equations for gauge coupling constants in\ngauge-Higgs grand unification on five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum warped space.\nWe show that all the four-dimensional Standard Model gauge coupling constants\nare asymptotically free and are effectively unified in $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs\ngrand unified theories on 5D Randall-Sundrum warped space.\n", "  We present $N$-body simulations of globular clusters, exploring the effect of\ndifferent galactic potentials on cluster sizes, $r_h$. For various\ngalactocentric distances, $R_G$, we assess how cluster sizes change when we\nvary the virial mass and concentration of the host galaxy's dark-matter halo.\nWe show that sizes of GCs are determined by the local galactic mass density\nrather than the virial mass of the host galaxy. We find that clusters evolving\nin the inner haloes of less concentrated galaxies are significantly more\nextended than those evolving in more concentrated ones, while the sizes of\nthose orbiting in the outer halo are almost independent of concentration.\nAdding a baryonic component to our galaxy models does not change these results\nmuch, since its effect is only significant in the very inner halo. Our\nsimulations suggest that there is a relation between $r_h$ and $R_G$, which\nsystematically depends on the physical parameters of the halo. Hence, observing\nsuch relations in individual galaxies can put a new observational constraint on\ndark-matter halo characteristics. However, by varying the halo mass in a wide\nrange of $10^{9}\\leq M_{vir}/\\msun \\leq10^{13}$, we find that the $r_h-R_G$\nrelationship will be nearly independent of halo mass, if one assumes $M_{vir}$\nand $c_{vir}$ as two correlated parameters, as is suggested by cosmological\nsimulations.\n", "  X-Ray Thomson Scattering (XRTS) is an important experimental technique used\nto measure the temperature, ionization state, structure, and density of warm\ndense matter (WDM). The fundamental property probed in these experiments is the\nelectronic dynamic structure factor (DSF). In most models, this is decomposed\ninto three terms [Chihara, J. Phys. F: Metal Phys. {\\bf 17}, 295 (1987)]\nrepresenting the response of tightly bound, loosely bound, and free electrons.\nAccompanying this decomposition is the classification of electrons as either\nbound or free, which is useful for gapped and cold systems but becomes\nincreasingly questionable as temperatures and pressures increase into the WDM\nregime. In this work we provide unambiguous first principles calculations of\nthe dynamic structure factor of warm dense beryllium, independent of the\nChihara form, by treating bound and free states under a single formalism. The\ncomputational approach is real-time finite-temperature time-dependent density\nfunctional theory (TDDFT) being applied here for the first time to WDM. We\ncompare results from TDDFT to Chihara-based calculations for experimentally\nrelevant conditions in shock-compressed beryllium.\n", "  In the temperature-concentration phase diagram of most iron-based\nsuperconductors, antiferromagnetic order is gradually suppressed to zero at a\ncritical point, and a dome of superconductivity forms around that point. The\nnature of the magnetic phase and its fluctuations is of fundamental importance\nfor elucidating the pairing mechanism. In Ba{1-x}KxFe2As2 and Ba{1-x}NaxFe2As2,\nit has recently become clear that the usual stripe-like magnetic phase, of\northorhombic symmetry, gives way to a second magnetic phase, of tetragonal\nsymmetry, near the critical point, between x = 0.24 and x = 0.28. Here we\nreport measurements of the electrical resistivity of Ba{1-x}KxFe2As2 under\napplied hydrostatic pressures up to 2.75 GPa, for x = 0.22, 0.24 and 0.28. We\ntrack the onset of the tetragonal magnetic phase using the sharp anomaly it\nproduces in the resistivity. In the temperature-concentration phase diagram of\nBa{1-x}KxFe2As2, we find that pressure greatly expands the tetragonal magnetic\nphase, while the stripe-like phase shrinks. This raises the interesting\npossibility that the fluctuations of the former phase might be involved in the\npairing mechanism responsible for the superconductivity.\n", "  In this paper we study the $Z$, $Z+$ jet, $Z+c$ and $Z+c+$ jet production in\n$pp$ collisions at the LHC considering different models for an intrinsic charm\ncontent of the proton. We analyse the impact of the intrinsic charm in the\nrapidity and transverse momentum distributions for these different processes.\nOur results indicated that differently from the other processes, the $Z+c$\ncross section is strongly affected by the presence of the intrinsic charm.\nMoreover, we propose the analysis of the ratios $R(Z+c/Z) \\equiv\n\\sigma(Z+c)/\\sigma(Z)$ and $R(Z+c/Z+\\mbox{jet}) \\equiv\n\\sigma(Z+c)/\\sigma(Z+\\mbox{jet})$ and demonstrate that these observables can be\nused as a probe of the intrinsic charm.\n", "  We derive effective lattice models for ultracold bosonic or fermionic\nnonreactive molecules (NRMs) in an optical lattice, analogous to the Hubbard\nmodel that describes ultracold atoms in a lattice. In stark contrast to the\nHubbard model, which is commonly assumed to accurately describe NRMs, we find\nthat the single on-site interaction parameter $U$ is replaced by a\nmulti-channel interaction, whose properties we elucidate. The complex,\nmulti-channel collisional physics is unrelated to dipolar interactions, and so\noccurs even in the absence of an electric field or for homonuclear molecules.\nWe find a crossover between coherent few-channel models and fully incoherent\nsingle-channel models as the lattice depth is increased. We show that the\neffective model parameters can be determined in lattice modulation experiments,\nwhich consequently measure molecular collision dynamics with a vastly sharper\nenergy resolution than experiments in an ultracold gas.\n", "  Aiming at efficient numerical treatment of tunneling ionization of atoms and\nmolecules by mid-infrared (IR) lasers, exterior time scaling (ETS) theory is\nformulated as a generalization of the time-scaled coordinate approach. The key\nidea of ETS is the division of the spatial volume into a small region around\nthe nucleus and its outside; the radial coordinates are time scaled only in the\nouter region. The continuum components of photoelectron wave packets are\nprevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the\nlong-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis\nfunctions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the\nbound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of\nnon-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are\nless stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in\nwhich the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff.\nFor numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms\nof finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions. Furthermore, the\nstiffness-free Lanczos time propagator is introduced to remove any persistent\nstiffness in the treatment of mid-IR lasers due to the involvement of hundreds\nof angular-momentum states. The test calculations for atomic hydrogen\ninteracting with linearly polarized mid-IR pulses demonstrate the accuracy and\nnumerical efficiency of the new scheme, and exhibit its special capability if\nthere is no recollision with the parent ion. Hence, ETS will show its true\npotential for the detailed analysis of photoelectron wave packet dynamics in\ncircularly or near-circularly polarized mid-IR fields.\n", "  The concept of coherence is one of cornerstones in physics. The development\nof quantum information science has lead to renewed interest in properly\napproaching the coherence at the quantum level. Various measures could be\nproposed to quantify coherence of a quantum state with respect to the\nprescribed orthonormal basis. To be a proper measure of coherence, each\ncandidate should enjoy certain properties. It seems that the monotonicity\nproperty plays a crucial role here. Indeed, there is known an intuitive measure\nof coherence that does not share this condition. We study coherence measures\ninduced by quantum divergences of the Tsallis type. Basic properties of the\nconsidered coherence quantifiers are derived. Trade-off relations between\ncoherence and mixedness are examined. The property of monotonicity under\nincoherent selective measurements has to be reformulated. The proposed\nformulation can naturally be treated as a parametric extension of its standard\nform. Finally, two coherence measures quadratic in moduli of matrix elements\nare compared from the monotonicity viewpoint.\n", "  We study the supersymmetric extension of $SO(10)$-inspired thermal\nleptogenesis showing the constraints on neutrino parameters and on the reheat\ntemperature $T_{\\rm RH}$ that derive from the condition of successful\nleptogenesis from next-to-lightest right handed (RH) neutrinos ($N_2$) decays\nand the more stringent ones when independence of the initial conditions (strong\nthermal leptogenesis) is superimposed. In the latter case, the increase of the\nlightest right-handed neutrino ($N_1$) decay parameters helps the wash-out of a\npre-existing asymmetry and constraints relax compared to the non-supersymmetric\ncase. We find significant changes especially in the case of large $\\tan\\beta$\nvalues $(\\gtrsim 15)$. In particular, for normal ordering, the atmospheric\nmixing angle can now be also maximal. The lightest (ordinary) neutrino mass is\nstill constrained within the range $10 \\lesssim m_1/{\\rm meV} \\lesssim 30$\n(corresponding to $75\\lesssim \\sum_i m_i/{\\rm meV} \\lesssim 120$). Inverted\nordering is still disfavoured, but an allowed region satisfying strong thermal\nleptogenesis opens up at large $\\tan\\beta$ values. We also study in detail the\nlower bound on $T_{\\rm RH}$ finding $T_{\\rm RH}\\gtrsim 1 \\times 10^{10}\\,{\\rm\nGeV}$ independently of the initial $N_2$ abundance. Finally, we propose a new\n$N_2$-dominated scenario where the $N_1$ mass is lower than the sphaleron\nfreeze-out temperature. In this case there is no $N_1$ wash-out and we find\n$T_{\\rm RH} \\gtrsim 1\\times 10^{9}\\,{\\rm GeV}$. These results indicate that\n$SO(10)$-inspired thermal leptogenesis can be made compatible with the upper\nbound from the gravitino problem, an important result in light of the role\noften played by supersymmetry in the quest of a realistic model of fermion\nmasses.\n", "  Motile cilia are used by many eukaryotic cells to transport flow.\nCilia-driven flows are important to many physiological functions, yet a deep\nunderstanding of the interplay between the mechanical structure of cilia and\ntheir physiological functions in healthy and diseased conditions remains\nelusive. For developing such understanding, one needs a quantitative framework\nfor assessing cilia performance and robustness when subject to perturbations in\nthe cilia apparatus. Here, we link cilia design (beating patterns) to function\n(flow transport) in the context of experimentally- and theoretically-derived\ncilia models. We particularly examine the optimality and robustness of cilia\ndesign. Optimality refers to efficiency of flow transport, while robustness is\ndefined as low sensitivity to variations in the design parameters. We find that\nsuboptimal designs can be more robust than optimal ones. That is, designing for\nthe most efficient cilium does not guarantee robustness. These findings have\nsignificant implications on the understanding of cilia design in artificial and\nbiological systems.\n", "  We report on the observation of a terahertz radiation induced photon drag\neffect in epitaxially grown $n$- and $p$-type\n(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ three dimensional topological insulators\nwith different antimony concentrations $x$ varying from 0 to 1. We demonstrate\nthat the excitation with polarized terahertz radiation results in a $dc$\nelectric photocurrent. While at normal incidence a current arises due to the\nphotogalvanic effect in the surface states, at oblique incidence it is\noutweighed by the trigonal photon drag effect. The developed microscopic model\nand theory show that the photon drag photocurrent is due to the dynamical\nmomentum alignment by time and space dependent radiation electric field and\nimplies the radiation induced asymmetric scattering in the electron momentum\nspace.\n", "  In the context of measurement-based quantum computation a way of maintaining\nthe coherence of a graph state is to measure its stabilizer operators. Aside\nfrom performing quantum error correction, it is possible to exploit the\ninformation gained from these measurements to characterize and then counteract\na coherent source of errors; that is, to determine all the parameters of an\nerror channel that applies a fixed - but unknown - unitary operation to the\nphysical qubits. Such a channel is generated, e.g., by local stray fields that\nact on the qubits. We study the case in which each qubit of a given graph state\nmay see a different error channel and we focus on channels given by a rotation\non the Bloch sphere around either the x, y or z axis, for which analytical\nresults can be given in a compact form. The possibility of reconstructing the\nchannels at all qubits depends non-trivially on the topology of the graph\nstate. We prove via perturbation methods that the reconstruction process is\nrobust and supplement the analytic results with numerical evidence.\n", "  A Brownian information engine is a device extracting a mechanical work from a\nsingle heat bath by exploiting the information on the state of a Brownian\nparticle immersed in the bath. As for engines, it is important to find the\noptimal operating condition that yields the maximum extracted work or power.\nThe optimal condition for a Brownian information engine with a finite cycle\ntime $\\tau$ has been rarely studied because of the difficulty in finding the\nnonequilibrium steady state. In this study, we introduce a model for the\nBrownian information engine and develop an analytic formalism for its steady\nstate distribution for any $\\tau$. We find that the extracted work per engine\ncycle is maximum when $\\tau$ approaches infinity, while the power is maximum\nwhen $\\tau$ approaches zero.\n", "  We compute and analyze correlation functions in the isovector vector channel\nat vanishing spatial momentum across the deconfinement phase transition in\nlattice QCD. The simulations are carried out at temperatures $T/T_c=0.156, 0.8,\n1.0, 1.25$ and $1.67$ with $T_c\\simeq203$MeV for two flavors of Wilson-Clover\nfermions with a zero-temperature pion mass of $\\simeq270$MeV. Exploiting exact\nsum rules and applying a phenomenologically motivated ansatz allows us to\ndetermine the spectral function $\\rho(\\omega,T)$ via a fit to the lattice\ncorrelation function data. From these results we estimate the electrical\nconductivity across the deconfinement phase transition via a Kubo formula and\nfind evidence for the dissociation of the $\\rho$ meson by resolving its\nspectral weight at the available temperatures. We also apply the Backus-Gilbert\nmethod as a model-independent approach to this problem. At any given frequency,\nit yields a local weighted average of the true spectral function. We use this\nmethod to compare kinetic theory predictions and previously published\nphenomenological spectral functions to our lattice study.\n", "  Numerous geological features that could be evaporitic in origin have been\nidentified on the surface of Titan. Although they seem to be water-ice poor,\ntheir main properties -chemical composition, thickness, stratification- are\nessentially unknown. In this paper, which follows on a previous one focusing on\nthe surface composition (Cordier et al., 2013), we provide some answers to\nthese questions derived from a new model. This model, based on the up-to-date\nthermodynamic theory known as \"PC-SAFT\", has been validated with available\nlaboratory measurements and specifically developed for our purpose. 1-D models\nconfirm the possibility of an acetylene and/or butane enriched central layer of\nevaporitic deposit. The estimated thickness of this acetylene-butane layer\ncould explain the strong RADAR brightness of the evaporites. The 2-D\ncomputations indicate an accumulation of poorly soluble species at the\ndeposit's margin. Among these species, HCN or aerosols similar to tholins could\nplay a dominant role. Our model predicts the existence of chemically trimodal\n\"bathtub rings\" which is consistent with what it is observed at the south polar\nlake Ontario Lacus. This work also provides plausible explanations to the lack\nof evaporites in the south polar region and to the high radar reflectivity of\ndry lakebeds.\n", "  One of interesting open questions for the high transition temperature (Tc)\nsuperconductivity in sulfur hydrides is why high pressure phases of H3S have\nextremely high Tc's. Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the\nvan Hove singularities (vHs) around the Fermi level is crucial. However, while\nthere have been quantitative estimates of Tc based on the Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory, the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) has been neglected\nto simplify the Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant\nDOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic structure over 40eV\naround the Fermi level. In contrast with the previous conventional\ncalculations, this approach with a sufficiently large number of Matsubara\nfrequencies enables us to calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo\nCoulomb potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S for which\nthe vHs is absent, the constant DOS approximation employed so far seriously\noverestimates (underestimates) Tc by ~ 60K (~ 10K) for H3S (H2S). We then\ndiscuss the impact of the strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic\nstructure with and without the vHs and how it affects the superconductivity.\nEspecially, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the self-consistent\ncalculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect of the energy shift due to the\nzero-point motion, and (3) the effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies\ndue to strong anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)-(3) on Tc is about\n10-30K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated to be 181K for H3S at\n250GPa and 34K for H2S at 140GPa, which explains the pressure dependence of Tc\nobserved in the experiment. In addition, we evaluate the lowest order vertex\ncorrection beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and discuss the validity of the\nMigdal approximation for sulfur hydrides.\n", "  We discuss a possible explanation of the recently observed diphoton excess at\naround 750 GeV as seen by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron\nCollider. We calculate the cross section of the diphoton signature in 2-Higgs\nDoublet Models with the addition of a real isospin scalar multiplet without a\nvacuum expectation value, where a neutral component of such a representation\ncan be a dark matter candidate. We find that the branching fraction of an\nadditional CP-even Higgs boson $H$ from the doublet fields into the diphoton\nmode can be significantly enhanced, by up to a factor of $10^3$, with respect\nto the case of the simple 2-Higgs Doublet Model. Such a sizable enhancement is\nrealized due to multi-charged inert particle loops entering the $H\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$ decay mode. Through this enhancement, we obtain a suitable cross\nsection of the $gg\\to H \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ process to explain the data with the\nfixed mass of $H$ being 750 GeV.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate an interferometric protocol for multiplexing\noptical states of light, with potential to become a standard element in\nfree-space communication schemes that utilize light endowed with orbital\nangular momentum (OAM). We demonstrate multiplexing for odd and even OAM\nsuperpositions generated using different sources. In addition, our technique\npermits one to prepare either coherent superpositions or statistical mixtures\nof OAM states. We employ state tomography to study the performance of this\nprotocol, and we demonstrate fidelities greater than 0.98.\n", "  We develop non-linear integro-differential kinetic equations for\nproliferating L\\'{e}vy walkers with birth and death processes. A hyperbolic\nscaling is applied directly to the general equations to get the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequations that will allow to determine the rate of front propagation. We found\nthe conditions for switching, birth and death rates under which the propagation\nvelocity reaches the maximum value, i.e. the walker's speed. In the strong\nanomalous case the death rate was found to influence the velocity of\npropagation to fall below the walker's maximum speed.\n", "  We argue that a crucial determinant of the acceptance dependence of\nfluctuation measures in heavy-ion collisions is the range of correlations in\nthe momentum space, e.g., in rapidity, $\\Delta y_{\\rm corr}$. The value of\n$\\Delta y_{\\rm corr}\\sim1$ for critical thermal fluctuations is determined by\nthe thermal rapidity spread of the particles at freezeout, and has little to do\nwith position space correlations, even near the critical point where the\nspatial correlation length $\\xi$ becomes as large as $2-3$ fm (this is in\ncontrast to the magnitudes of the cumulants, which are sensitive to $\\xi$).\nWhen the acceptance window is large, $\\Delta y\\gg\\Delta y_{\\rm corr}$, the\ncumulants of a given particle multiplicity, $\\kappa_k$, scale linearly with\n$\\Delta y$, or mean multiplicity in acceptance, $\\langle N\\rangle$, and\ncumulant ratios are acceptance independent. While in the opposite regime,\n$\\Delta y\\ll\\Delta y_{\\rm corr}$, the factorial cumulants, $\\hat\\kappa_k$,\nscale as $(\\Delta y)^k$, or $\\langle N\\rangle^k$. We demonstrate this general\nbehavior quantitatively in a model for critical point fluctuations, which also\nshows that the dependence on transverse momentum acceptance is very\nsignificant. We conclude that extension of rapidity coverage proposed by STAR\nshould significantly increase the magnitude of the critical point fluctuation\nsignatures.\n", "  We study whether the hinted 750 GeV resonance at the LHC can be a\nColeman-Weinberg inflaton which is non-minimally coupled to gravity. Since the\ninflaton must couple to new charged and coloured states to reproduce the LHC\ndiphoton signature, the same interaction can generate its effective potential\nand trigger the electroweak symmetry breaking via the portal coupling to the\nHiggs boson. This inflationary scenario predicts a lower bound on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\\gtrsim 0.006$, where the minimal value corresponds\nto the measured spectral index $n_s\\simeq0.97$. However, we find that the\ncompatibility with the LHC diphoton signal requires exotic new physics at\nenergy scales accessible at the LHC. We study and quantify the properties of\nthe predicted exotic particles.\n", "  The influence of finite relaxation times on Thomson scattering from\nwarm-dense plasmas is examined within the framework of the average-atom\napproximation. Presently most calculations use the collision-free Lindhard\ndielectric function to evaluate the free-electron contribution to the Thomson\ncross section. In this work, we use the Mermin dielectric function, which\nincludes relaxation time explicitly. The relaxation time is evaluated by\ntreating the average atom as an impurity in a uniform electron gas and depends\ncritically on the transport cross section. The calculated relaxation rates\nagree well with values inferred from the Ziman formula for the static\nconductivity and also with rates inferred from a fit to the frequency-dependent\nconductivity. Transport cross sections determined by the phase-shift analysis\nin the average-atom potential are compared with those evaluated in the commonly\nused Born approximation. The Born approximation converges to the exact cross\nsections at high energies; however, differences that occur at low energies lead\nto corresponding differences in relaxation rates. The relative importance of\nincluding relaxation time when modeling X-ray Thomson scattering spectra is\nexamined by comparing calculations of the free-electron dynamic structure\nfunction for Thomson scattering using Lindhard and Mermin dielectric functions.\nApplications are given to warm-dense Be plasmas, with temperatures ranging from\n2 to 32~eV and densities ranging from 2 to 64~g/cc.\n", "  The backreaction of inhomogeneities describes the effect of inhomogeneous\nstructure on average properties of the Universe. We investigate this approach\nby testing the consistency of cosmological $N$-body simulations as non-linear\nstructure evolves. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE), we\ncalculate the kinematical backreaction $Q$ from simulations on different scales\nin order to measure how much $N$-body simulations should be corrected for this\neffect. This is the first step towards creating fully relativistic and\ninhomogeneous $N$-body simulations. In this paper we compare the interpolation\ntechniques available in DTFE and illustrate the statistical dependence of $Q$\nas a function of length scale.\n", "  We use the Higgs coupling and the muon anomalous magnetic moment measurements\nto constrain the parameter space of the natural supersymmetry (SUSY) in the\nGeneralized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA) model. We scan the parameter space\nof the GmSUGRA model with small electroweak fine-tuning measure ($\\Delta_{\\rm\nEW} \\leq 100$). The parameter space after applying various sparticle mass\nbounds, Higgs mass bounds, B-physics bounds, the muon magnetic moment\nconstraint, and the Higgs coupling constraint from measurements at HL-LHC, ILC,\nand CEPC, is shown in the planes of various interesting model parameters and\nsparticle masses. Our study indicates that the Higgs coupling and muon\nanomalous magnetic moment measurements can constrain the parameter space\neffectively. It is shown that $\\Delta_{\\rm EW}\\sim$ 30, consistence with all\nconstraints, and having supersymmetric contributions to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment within 1$\\sigma$ can be achieved. The precision of $k_b$ and\n$k_{\\tau}$ measurements at CEPC can bound $m_A$ to be above 1.2 TeV and 1.1 TeV\nrespectively. The combination of the Higgs coupling measurement and muon\nanomalous magnetic moment measurement constrain $\\tilde{e}_R$ mass to be in the\nrange from 0.6 TeV to 2 TeV. The range of both $\\tilde{e}_L$ and\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_e$ masses is 0.4 TeV $\\sim$ 1.2 TeV. In all cases, the\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ mass needs to be small (mostly $\\leq$ 400 GeV). The\ncomparison of bounds in the $\\tan\\beta - m_A$ plane shows that the Higgs\ncoupling measurement is complementary to the direct collider searches for heavy\nHiggs when constraining the natural SUSY. A few mass spectra in the typical\nregion of parameter space after applying all constraints are shown as well.\n", "  Intermediate-mass, chemically peculiar stars with strong magnetic fields give\nus an excellent opportunity to study the topology of their surface magnetic\nfields and the interplay between magnetic geometries and abundance\ninhomogeneities in their atmospheres.\n  We reconstruct detailed maps of the surface magnetic field and abundance\ndistributions for the magnetic Ap star HD 125248.\n  We performed the analysis based on phase-resolved, four Stokes parameter\nspectropolarimetric observations obtained with the HARPSpol instrument. These\ndata were interpreted with the magnetic Doppler imaging technique.\n  We improved the atmospheric parameters of the star, T_eff = 9850K +/- 250K\nand logg = 4.05 +/- 0.10. We performed detailed abundance analysis and\ndiscovered vertical stratification effects for the FeII and CrII ions. We\ncomputed LSD Stokes profiles and studied their behavior with rotational phase.\nWe improved the rotational period of the star P_rot = 9.29558(6)d. Magnetic\nDoppler imaging of HD 125248 showed that its magnetic field is mostly poloidal\nand quasi-dipolar with two large spots of different polarity and field\nstrength. The chemical maps of Fe, Cr, Ce, Nd, Gd, and Ti show abundance\ncontrasts of 0.9-3.5 dex. Among these elements, the Fe abundance map does not\nshow high-contrast features. Cr is overabundant around the negative magnetic\npole and has 3.5 dex abundance range. The rare earth elements and Ti are\noverabundant near the positive magnetic pole.\n  The magnetic field of HD 125248 has strong deviations from the classical\naxisymmetric dipole field geometry. The comparison to results derived for other\nstars using four Stokes magnetic Doppler imaging suggests evidence that the\nfield topology becomes simpler with increasing age. The abundance maps show\nweak correlation with the magnetic field geometry, but they do not agree with\nthe atomic diffusion calculations.\n", "  We discuss the computation of the Higgs boson decay amplitude to two photons\nthrough the W-loop using dispersion relations. The imaginary part of the form\nfactor F_W(s) that parametrizes this decay is unambiguous in four dimensions.\nWhen it is used to calculate the unsubtracted dispersion integral, the finite\nresult for the form factor F_W(s) is obtained. However, the F_W(s) obtained in\nthis way differs by a constant term from the result of a diagrammatic\ncomputation, based on dimensional regularization. It is easy to accommodate the\nmissing constant by writing a once-subtracted dispersion relation for F_W(s)\nbut it is unclear why the subtraction needs to be done. The goal of this paper\nis to investigate this question in detail. We show that the correct constant\ncan be recovered within a dispersive approach in a number of ways that,\nhowever, either require an introduction of an ultraviolet regulator or\nunphysical degrees of freedom; unregulated and unsubtracted computations in the\nunitary gauge are insufficient, in spite of the fact that such computations\ngive a finite result.\n", "  We explore a dark matter model extending the standard model particle content\nby one fermionic $SU(2)_L$ triplet and two fermionic $SU(2)_L$ quadruplets,\nleading to a minimal realistic UV-complete model of electroweakly interacting\ndark matter which interacts with the Higgs doublet at tree level via two kinds\nof Yukawa couplings. After electroweak symmetry-breaking, the physical spectrum\nof the dark sector consists of three Majorana fermions, three singly charged\nfermions, and one doubly charged fermion, with the lightest neutral fermion\n$\\chi_1^0$ serving as a dark matter candidate. A typical spectrum exhibits a\nlarge degree of degeneracy in mass between the neutral and charged fermions,\nand we examine the one-loop corrections to the mass differences to ensure that\nthe lightest particle is neutral. We identify regions of parameter space for\nwhich the dark matter abundance is saturated for a standard cosmology,\nincluding coannihilation channels, and find that this is typically achieved for\n$m_{\\chi_1^0}\\sim 2.4~\\mathrm{TeV}$. Constraints from precision electroweak\nmeasurements, searches for dark matter scattering with nuclei, and dark matter\nannihilation are important, but leave open a viable range for a thermal relic.\n", "  We present a methodology to recover cosmic microwave background (CMB)\npolarization in which the quantity $P = Q+ iU$ is linearly combined at\ndifferent frequencies using complex coefficients. This is the most general\nlinear combination of the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters which preserves the\nphysical coherence of the residual contribution on the CMB estimation. The\napproach is applied to the internal linear combination (ILC) and the internal\ntemplate fitting (ITF) methodologies. The variance of $P$ of the resulting map\nis minimized to compute the coefficients of the linear combination. One of the\nkey aspects of this procedure is that it serves to account for a global\nfrequency-dependent shift of the polarization phase. Although in the standard\ncase, in which no global E-B transference depending on frequency is expected in\nthe foreground components, minimizing $\\left\\langle |P|^2\\right\\rangle$ is\nsimilar to minimizing $\\left\\langle Q^2\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left\\langle\nU^2\\right\\rangle$ separately (as previous methodologies proceed), multiplying\n$Q$ and $U$ by different coefficients induces arbitrary changes in the\npolarization angle and it does not preserve the coherence between the spinorial\ncomponents. The approach is tested on simulations, obtaining a similar residual\nlevel with respect to the one obtained with other implementations of the ILC,\nand perceiving the polarization rotation of a toy model with the frequency\ndependence of the Faraday rotation.\n", "  Spitzer microlensing parallax observations of OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 decisively\nbreaks a degeneracy between planetary and binary solutions that is somewhat\nambiguous when only ground-based data are considered. Only eight viable models\nsurvive out of an initial set of 32 local minima in the parameter space. These\nmodels clearly indicate that the lens is a stellar binary system possibly\nlocated within the bulge of our Galaxy, ruling out the planetary alternative.\nWe argue that several types of discrete degeneracies can be broken via such\nspace-based parallax observations.\n", "  For a limited set of impact conditions, a drop impacting onto a pool can\nentrap an air bubble as large as its own size. The subsequent rise and rupture\nof this large bubble plays an important role in aerosol formation and gas\ntransport at the air-sea interface. The large bubble is formed when the impact\ncrater closes up near the pool surface and is known to occur only for drops\nwhich are prolate at impact. Herein we use experiments and numerical\nsimulations to show that a concentrated vortex ring, produced in the neck\nbetween the drop and pool, controls the crater deformations and pinch-off.\nHowever, it is not the strongest vortex rings which are responsible for the\nlarge bubbles, as they interact too strongly with the pool surface and\nself-destruct. Rather, it is somewhat weaker vortices which can deform the\ndeeper craters, which manage to pinch off the large bubbles. These observations\nalso explain why the strongest and most penetrating vortex rings emerging from\ndrop impacts, are not produced by oblate drops but by more prolate drop shapes,\nas had been observed in previous experiments.\n", "  We apply the formalism of quantum measurement theory to the idealized\nmeasurement of the position of a particle with an optical interferometer,\nfinding that the backaction of counting entangled photons systematically\ncollapses the particle's wavefunction toward a narrow Gaussian wavepacket at\nthe location $x_\\mathrm{est}$ determined by the measurement without appeal to\nenvironmental decoherence or other spontaneous collapse mechanism. Further, the\nvariance in the particle's position, as calculated from the post-measurement\nwavefunction agrees precisely with shot-noise limited uncertainty of the\nmeasured $x_\\mathrm{est}$. Both the identification of the absolute square of\nthe particle's initial wavefunction as the probability density for\n$x_\\mathrm{est}$ and the de Broglie hypothesis emerge as consequences of\ninterpreting the intensity of the optical field as proportional to the\nprobability of detecting a photon. Linear momentum information that is encoded\nin the particle's initial wavefunction survives the measurement, and the\npre-measurement expectation values are preserved in the ensemble average.\n", "  Heavy quarkonia in a homogeneous magnetic field are analyzed by using a\npotential model with constituent quarks. To obtain anisotropic wave functions\nand corresponding eigenvalues, the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method is\napplied, where the anisotropic wave functions are expanded by a Gaussian basis\nin the cylindrical coordinates. Deformation of the wave functions and the mass\nshifts of the $S$-wave heavy quarkonia ($\\eta_c$, $J/\\psi$, $\\eta_c(2S)$,\n$\\psi(2S)$ and bottomonia) are examined for the wide range of external magnetic\nfield. The spatial structure of the wave functions changes drastically as\nadjacent energy levels cross each other. Possible observables in heavy-ion\ncollision experiments and future lattice QCD simulations are also discussed.\n", "  We propose a possible explanation of the recent diphoton excess reported by\nATLAS and CMS collaborations, at around 750 GeV diphoton invariant mass, within\nthe framework of $E_{6}$ motivated Alternative Left-Right Symmetric Model\n(ALRSM), which is capable of addressing the $B$ decay anomalies in the flavor\nsector, the $eejj$ and $e$ missing $p_{T}jj$ excesses reported by CMS in run 1\nof LHC and has the feature of high scale leptogenesis. We find that gluon-gluon\nfusion can give the observed production rate of the 750 GeV resonance,\n$\\tilde{n}$, through a loop of scalar leptoquarks ($\\tilde{h}^{(c)}$) with mass\nbelow a few TeV range, while $\\tilde{n}$ can subsequently decay into\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ final state via loops of $\\tilde{h}^{(c)}$ and\n$\\tilde{E}^{(c)}$. Interestingly, the $\\tilde{E}^{(c)}$ loop can enhance the\ndiphoton branching ratio significantly to successfully explain the observed\ncross section of the diphoton signal.\n", "  Domain wall dynamics in a magnetoelectric antiferromagnet is analyzed, and\nits implications for magnetoelectric memory applications are discussed.\nCr$_2$O$_3$ is used in the estimates of the materials parameters. It is found\nthat the domain wall mobility has a maximum as a function of the electric field\ndue to the gyrotropic coupling induced by it. In Cr$_2$O$_3$ the maximal\nmobility of 0.1 m/(s$\\times$Oe) is reached at $E\\approx0.06$ V/nm. Fields of\nthis order may be too weak to overcome the intrinsic depinning field, which is\nestimated for B-doped Cr$_2$O$_3$. These major drawbacks for device\nimplementation can be overcome by applying a small in-plane shear strain, which\nblocks the domain wall precession. Domain wall mobility of about 0.7\nm/(s$\\times$Oe) can then be achieved at $E=0.2$ V/nm. A split-gate scheme is\nproposed for the domain-wall controlled bit element; its extension to\nmultiple-gate linear arrays can offer advantages in memory density,\nprogrammability, and logic functionality.\n", "  We present multiwavelength identifications for the counterparts of 1088\nsubmillimeter sources detected at 850$\\mu$m in the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy\nSurvey study of the UKIDSS-UDS field. By utilising an ALMA pilot study on a\nsubset of our bright SCUBA-2 sample as a training set, along with the deep\noptical-near-infrared data available in this field, we develop a novel\ntechnique, Optical-IR Triple Color (OIRTC), using $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$,\n$[3.6]-[4.5]$ colors to select the candidate submillimeter galaxy (SMG)\ncounterparts. By combining radio identification and the OIRTC technique, we\nfind counterpart candidates for 80% of the Class = 1 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ SCUBA-2\nsample, defined as those that are covered by both radio and OIR imaging and the\nbase sample for our scientific analyses. Based on the ALMA training set, we\nexpect the accuracy of these identifications to be $82\\pm20$%, with a\ncompleteness of $69\\pm16$%, essentially as accurate as the traditional\n$p$-value technique but with higher completeness. We find that the fraction of\nSCUBA-2 sources having candidate counterparts is lower for fainter 850$\\mu$m\nsources, and we argue that for follow-up observations sensitive to SMGs with\n$S_{850}\\gtrsim 1$ mJy across the whole ALMA beam, the fraction with multiple\ncounterparts is likely to be $>40$% for SCUBA-2 sources at $S_{850} \\gtrsim 4$\nmJy. We find that the photometric redshift distribution for the SMGs is well\nfit by a lognormal distribution, with a median redshift of $z=2.3\\pm0.1$. After\naccounting for the sources without any radio and/or OIRTC counterpart, we\nestimate the median redshift to be $z=2.6\\pm0.1$ for SMGs with $S_{850} >1$\nmJy. We also use this new large sample to study the clustering of SMGs and the\nthe far-infrared properties of the unidentified submillimeter sources by\nstacking their Herschel SPIRE far-infrared emission.\n", "  We study spectral parametric correlations in quantum chaotic systems and\nintroduce the number covariance as a measure of such correlations. We derive\nanalytic results for the classical random matrix ensembles using the binary\ncorrelation method and obtain compact expressions for the co- variance. We\nillustrate the universality of this measure by presenting the spectral analysis\nof the quantum kicked rotors for the time-reversal invariant and time-reversal\nnon-invariant cases. A local version of the parametric number variance\nintroduced earlier is also investigated.\n", "  We consider a modified Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework between the Planck\nscale and the GUT scale. In this scenario, RS works as a theory of flavour and\nnot as a solution to the hierarchy problem. The latter is resolved by\nsupersymmetrising the bulk, so that the minimal supersymmetric standard model\nbeing the effective 4-dimensional theory. Matter fields are localised in the\nbulk in order to fit fermion-mass and mixing-data. If $R$-parity violating\nterms are allowed in the superpotential, their orders of magnitude throughout\nflavour space are then predicted, resulting in rich flavour textures. If the\n$R$-parity violating contributions to neutrino masses are somewhat suppressed,\nthen lepton-number violating models exist which explain the neutrino\noscillation data while not being in contradiction with current experimental\nbounds. Another promising model is one where baryon number is violated and\nDirac neutrino masses result solely from fermion localisation. We sketch the\nlikely discovery signatures of the baryon-number and the lepton-number\nviolating cases.\n", "  Geomagnetically-aligned density structures with a range of sizes exist in the\nnear-Earth plasma environment, including 10-100 km-wide VLF/HF wave-ducting\nstructures. Their small diameters and modest density enhancements make them\ndifficult to observe, and there is limited evidence for any of the several\nformation mechanisms proposed to date. We present a case study of an event on\n26 August 2014 where a travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID) shortly\nprecedes the formation of a complex collection of field-aligned ducts, using\ndata obtained by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope. Their\nspatiotemporal proximity leads us to suggest a causal interpretation.\nGeomagnetic conditions were quiet at the time, and no obvious triggers were\nnoted. Growth of the structures proceeds rapidly, within 0.5 hr of the passage\nof the TID, attaining their peak prominence 1-2 hr later and persisting for\nseveral more hours until observations ended at local dawn. Analyses of the next\ntwo days show field-aligned structures to be preferentially detectable under\nquiet rather than active geomagnetic conditions. We used a raster scanning\nstrategy facilitated by the speed of electronic beamforming to expand the\nquasi-instantaneous field of view of the MWA by a factor of three. These\nobservations represent the broadest angular coverage of the ionosphere by a\nradio telescope to date.\n", "  We construct \\HI~absorption spectra for 18 planetary nebulae (PNe) and their\nbackground sources using the data from the International Galactic Plane Survey.\nWe estimate the kinematic distances of these PNe, among which 15 objects'\nkinematic distances are obtained for the first time. The distance uncertainties\nof 13 PNe range from 10% to 50%, which is a significant improvement with\nuncertainties of a factor two or three smaller than most of previous distance\nmeasurements. We confirm that PN G030.2-00.1 is not a PN because of its large\ndistance found here.\n", "  Horava gravity theory possesses global Lifshitz space as a solution and has\nbeen conjectured to provide a natural framework for Lifshitz holography. We\nderive the conditions on the two derivative Horava gravity Lagrangian that are\nnecessary for static, asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes with flat transverse\ndimensions to contain a universal horizon, which plays a similar thermodynamic\nrole as the Killing horizon in general relativity. Specializing to z=2 in 1+2\ndimensions, we then numerically construct such regular solutions over the whole\nspacetime. We calculate the mass for these solutions and show that, unlike the\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter case, the first law applied to the universal\nhorizon is straightforwardly compatible with a thermodynamic interpretation.\n", "  The inverse Schulze-Hardy rule was recently proposed based on experimental\nobservations (Cao et al., Langmuir, 2015, 31, 6610-6614). This rule describes\nan interesting new situation of the aggregation of charged colloidal particles\nin the presence of the multivalent coions. Specifically, it can be shown that\nthe critical coagulation concentration is inversely proportional to the coion\nvalence. Here the derivation of the inverse Schulze-Hardy rule based on purely\ntheoretical grounds is presented for the first time. This derivation\ncomplements the classical Schulze-Hardy rule which describes the multivalent\ncounterion systems.\n", "  We reveal the existence of slowly-decaying dark solitons in the radiation\nbuild-up dynamics of bright pulses in all-normal dispersion mode-locked fiber\nlasers, numerically modeled in the framework of a generalized nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The evolution of noise perturbations to\nquasi-stationary dark solitons is examined, and the significance of background\nshape and soliton-soliton collisions on the eventual soliton decay is\nestablished. We demonstrate the role of a restoring force in extending soliton\ninteractions in conservative systems to include the effects of dissipation, as\nencountered in laser cavities, and generalize our observations to other\nnonlinear systems.\n", "  We perform real-time lattice simulations of out-of-equilibrium quark\nproduction in non-Abelian gauge theory in 3+1-dimensions. Our simulations\ninclude the backreaction of quarks onto the dynamical gluon sector, which is\nparticularly relevant for strongly correlated quarks. We observe fast\nisotropization and universal behavior of quarks and gluons at weak coupling and\nestablish a quantitative connection to previous pure glue results. In order to\nunderstand the strongly correlated regime, we perform simulations for a large\nnumber of flavors and compare them to those obtained with two light quark\nflavors. By doing this we are able to provide estimates of the chemical\nequilibration time.\n", "  We present theoretical and numerical results for the one-dimensional\nstochastically forced Burgers equation decimated on a fractal Fourier set of\ndimension $D$. We investigate the robustness of the energy transfer mechanism\nand of the small-scale statistical fluctuations by changing $D$. We find that a\nvery small percentage of mode-reduction ($D \\lesssim 1$) is enough to destroy\nmost of the characteristics of the original non-decimated equation. In\nparticular, we observe a suppression of intermittent fluctuations for $D <1$\nand a quasi-singular transition from the fully intermittent ($D=1$) to the\nnon-intermittent case for $D \\lesssim 1$. Our results indicate that the\nexistence of strong localized structures (shocks) in the one-dimensional\nBurgers equation is the result of highly entangled correlations amongst all\nFourier modes.\n", "  The case for a dibaryon resonance, appearing in np scattering, has support\nfrom a WASA-at-COSY measurement of the polarization quantity A_y over a\ncenter-of-mass energy region suggested by structures seen earlier in two-pion\nproduction experiments. Here we compare fits with and without an associated\npole in order to clarify the impact of these COSY data. We then consider what\nfurther np scattering measurements would most clearly distinguish between the\npole and non-pole fit results.\n", "  Creating spherical initial conditions in smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations that are spherically conformal is a difficult task. Here, we\ndescribe two algorithmic methods for evenly distributing points on surfaces,\nthat when paired can be used to build 3D spherical objects with optimal\nequipartition of volume between particles, commensurate with an arbitrary,\nradial density function. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method against\nstretched lattice arrangements on the metrics of hydrodynamic stability,\nspherical conformity, and the harmonic power distribution of gravitational\nsettling oscillations. We further demonstrate how our method is highly\noptimized for simulating multi-material spheres, such as planets with\ncore-mantle boundaries.\n", "  The widths of the strong decays $Z_c^{+}(3900)\\to J/\\psi \\pi^{+}$ and\n$Z_c^{+}(3900)\\to \\eta_{c} \\rho^{+}$ are calculated. To this end, the mass and\ndecay constant of the exotic $Z_c^{+}(3900)$ state are computed by means of a\ntwo-point sum rule. The obtained results are then used to calculate the strong\ncouplings $g_{Z_{c}J/\\psi \\pi }$ and $g_{Z_{c}\\eta_{c} \\rho }$ employing QCD\nsum rules on the light-cone supplied by a technique of the soft-meson\napproximation. We compare our predictions on the mass and decay widths with\navailable experimental data and other theoretical results.\n", "  The research of effective and reliable detrending methods for Spitzer data is\nof paramount importance for the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres.\nTo date, the totality of exoplanetary observations in the mid- and\nfar-infrared, at wavelengths $>$3 $\\mu$m, have been taken with Spitzer. In some\ncases, in the past years, repeated observations and multiple reanalyses of the\nsame datasets led to discrepant results, raising questions about the accuracy\nand reproducibility of such measurements. Morello et al. 2014, 2015 proposed a\nblind-source separation method based on the Independent Component Analysis of\npixel time series (pixel-ICA) to analyze IRAC data, obtaining coherent results\nwhen applied to repeated transit observations previously debated in the\nliterature. Here we introduce a variant to pixel-ICA through the use of wavelet\ntransform, wavelet pixel-ICA, which extends its applicability to low-S/N cases.\nWe describe the method and discuss the results obtained over twelve eclipses of\nthe exoplanet XO3b observed during the \"Warm Spitzer\" era in the 4.5 $\\mu$m\nband. The final results will be reported also in Ingalls et al. (in prep.),\ntogether with results obtained with other detrending methods, and over ten\nsynthetic eclipses that were analyzed for the \"IRAC Data Challenge 2015\". Our\nresults are consistent within 1 $\\sigma$ with the ones reported in Wong et al.\n2014. The self-consistency of individual measurements of eclipse depth and\nphase curve slope over a span of more than three years proves the stability of\nWarm Spitzer/IRAC photometry within the error bars, at the level of 1 part in\n10$^4$ in stellar flux.\n", "  We study hydrodynamic slowing-down of a particle moving in a temperature\ngradient perpendicular to a wall. At distances much smaller than the particle\nradius, $h\\ll a$, lubrication approximation leads to the reduced velocity\n$u/u_{0}=3\\frac{h}{a}\\ln \\frac{a}{h}$, with respect to the bulk value $u_{0}$.\nWith Brenner's result for confined diffusion, we find that the trapping\nefficiency, or effective Soret coefficient, increases logarithmically as the\nparticle gets very close to the wall. This provides a quantitative explanation\nfor the recently observed enhancement of thermophoretic trapping at short\ndistances. Our discussion of parallel and perpendicular thermophoresis in a\ncapillary, reveals a very a good agreement with five recent experiments on\ncharged polystyrene particles.\n", "  The random field S=1/2 Heisenberg chain exhibits a dynamical many body\nlocalization transition at a critical disorder strength, which depends on the\nenergy density. At weak disorder, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis\n(ETH) is fulfilled on average, making local observables smooth functions of\nenergy, whose eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations decrease exponentially with\nsystem size. We demonstrate the validity of ETH in the thermal phase as well as\nits breakdown in the localized phase and show that rare states exist which do\nnot strictly follow ETH, becoming more frequent closer to the transition.\nSimilarly, the probability distribution of the entanglement entropy at\nintermediate disorder develops long tails all the way down to zero\nentanglement. We propose that these low entanglement tails stem from localized\nregions at the subsystem boundaries which were recently discussed as a possible\nmechanism for subdiffusive transport in the ergodic phase.\n", "  We derive new constraints on massive gravity from unitarity and analyticity\nof scattering amplitudes. Our results apply to a general effective theory\ndefined by Einstein gravity plus the leading soft diffeomorphism-breaking\ncorrections. We calculate scattering amplitudes for all combinations of tensor,\nvector, and scalar polarizations. The high-energy behavior of these amplitudes\nprescribes a specific choice of couplings that ameliorates the ultraviolet\ncutoff, in agreement with existing literature. We then derive consistency\nconditions from analytic dispersion relations, which dictate positivity of\ncertain combinations of parameters appearing in the forward scattering\namplitudes. These constraints exclude all but a small island in the parameter\nspace of ghost-free massive gravity. While the theory of the \"Galileon\" scalar\nmode alone is known to be inconsistent with positivity constraints, this is\nremedied in the full massive gravity theory.\n", "  It is shown that classical spaces with geometries emerge on boundaries of\nrandomly connected tensor networks with appropriately chosen tensors in the\nthermodynamic limit. With variation of the tensors, the dimensions of the\nspaces can be freely chosen, and the geometries, which are curved in general,\ncan be varied. We give the explicit solvable examples of emergent flat tori in\narbitrary dimensions, and the correspondence from the tensors to the geometries\nfor general curved cases. The perturbative dynamics in the emergent space is\nshown to be described by an effective action which is invariant under the\nspatial diffeomorphism due to the underlying orthogonal group symmetry of the\nrandomly connected tensor network. It is also shown that there are various\nphase transitions among spaces, including extended and point-like ones, under\ncontinuous change of the tensors.\n", "  The double-averaging (DA) approximation is widely employed as the standard\ntechnique in studying the secular evolution of the hierarchical three-body\nsystem. We show that effects stemmed from the short-timescale oscillations\nignored by DA can accumulate over long timescales and lead to significant\nerrors in the long-term evolution of the Lidov-Kozai cycles. In particular, the\nconditions for having an orbital flip, where the inner orbit switches between\nprograde and retrograde with respect to the outer orbit and the associated\nextremely high eccentricities during the switch, can be modified significantly.\nThe failure of DA can arise for a relatively strong perturber where the mass of\nthe tertiary is considerable compared to the total mass of the inner binary.\nThis issue can be relevant for astrophysical systems such as stellar triples,\nplanets in stellar binaries, stellar-mass binaries orbiting massive black holes\nand moons of the planets perturbed by the Sun. We derive analytical equations\nfor the short-term oscillations of the inner orbit to the leading order for all\ninclinations, eccentricities and mass ratios. Under the test particle\napproximation, we derive the \"corrected double-averaging\" (CDA) equations by\nincorporating the effects of short-term oscillations into the DA. By comparing\nto N-body integrations, we show that the CDA equations successfully correct\nmost of the errors of the long-term evolution under the DA approximation for a\nlarge range of initial conditions. We provide an implementation of CDA that can\nbe directly added to codes employing DA equations.\n", "  On the standpoint of Occam's Razor approach, we consider the minimum number\nof parameters in the quark mass matrices needed for the successful CKM mixing\nand CP violation. We impose three zeros in the down-quark mass matrix with\ntaking the diagonal up-quark mass matrix to reduce the number of free\nparameters. The three zeros are maximal zeros in order to have a CP violating\nphase in the quark mass matrix. Then, there remain six real parameters and one\nCP violating phase, which is the minimal number to reproduce the observed data\nof the down-quark masses and the CKM parameters. The twenty textures with three\nzeros are examined. Among them, the thirteen textures are viable for the\ndown-quark mass matrix. As a representative of these textures, we discuss a\ntexture $M_d^{(1)}$ in details. By using the experimental data on $\\sin\n2\\beta$, $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\theta_{23}$ together with the observed quark\nmasses, the Cabibbo angle is predicted to be close to the experimental data. It\nis found that this surprising result remains unchanged in all other viable\ntextures. We also investigate the correlations among $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$, $\\sin\n2\\beta$ and $J_{CP}$. For all textures, the maximal value of the ratio\n$|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ is $0.09$, which is smaller than the upper-bound of the\nexperimental data, $0.094$. We hope that this prediction will be tested in\nfuture experiments.\n", "  We tackle the problem of accurate optical tracking of distant man-made\nprobes, on Halo orbit around the Earth-Sun libration point L2 and beyond, along\ninterplanetary transfers. The improved performance of on-target tracking,\nespecially when observing with small-class telescopes is assessed providing a\ngeneral estimate of the expected S/N ratio in spacecraft detection. The\non-going Gaia mission is taken as a pilot case for our analysis, reporting on\nfresh literature and original optical photometry and astrometric results. The\nprobe has been located, along its projected nominal path, within 0.13 +/- 0.09\narcsec, or 0.9 +/- 0.6 km. Spacecraft color appears to be red, with (V-R_c) =\n1.1 +/- 0.2 and a bolometric correction to the R_c band of (Bol-R_c) = -1.1 +/-\n0.2. The apparent magnitude, R_c = 20.8 +/- 0.2, is much fainter than\noriginally expected. These features lead to suggest a lower limit for the Bond\nalbedo a = 0.11 +/- 0.05 and confirm that incident Sun light is strongly\nreddened by Gaia through its on-board MLI blankets covering the solar shield.\nRelying on the Gaia figures, we found that VLT-class telescopes could yet be\nable to probe distant spacecraft heading Mars, up to 30 million km away, while\na broader optical coverage of the forthcoming missions to Venus and Mars could\nbe envisaged, providing to deal with space vehicles of minimum effective area\nAeff >= 10^6 cm^2. In addition to L2 surveys, 2m-class telescopes could also\neffectively flank standard radar-ranging techniques in deep-space probe\ntracking along Earth's gravity-assist maneuvers for interplanetary missions.\n", "  We aim to obtain high-quality time-resolved spectral fits of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) observed by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. We perform time-resolved spectral analysis with high\ntemporal and spectral resolution of the brightest bursts observed by Fermi GBM\nin its first 4 years of mission. We present the complete catalog containing\n1,491 spectra from 81 bursts with high spectral and temporal resolution.\nDistributions of parameters, statistics of the parameter populations,\nparameter-parameter and parameter-uncertainty correlations, and their exact\nvalues are obtained and presented as main results in this catalog. We report a\ncriterion that is robust enough to automatically distinguish between different\nspectral evolutionary trends between bursts. We also search for plausible\nblackbody emission components and find that only 3 bursts (36 spectra in total)\nshow evidence of a pure Planck function. It is observed that the averaged\ntime-resolved low-energy power-law index and peak energy are slightly harder\nthan the time-integrated values. Time-resolved spectroscopic results should be\nused when interpreting physics from the observed spectra, instead of the\ntime-integrated results.\n", "  We study the problem of detecting multipartite entanglement among\nindistinguishable fermionic particles. A multipartite concurrence for pure\nstates of $N$ identical fermions, each one having a $d$-dimensional\nsingle-particle Hilbert space, is introduced. Such entanglement measure, in\nparticular, is optimized for maximally entangled states of three identical\nfermions that play a role analogous to the usual (qubit)\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. In addition, it is shown that the fermionic\nmultipartite concurrence can be expressed as the mean value of an observable,\nprovided two copies of the composite state are available.\n", "  We report on the optical properties of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots emitting\nnear the telecommunication O-band, probed via Coulomb blockade and non-resonant\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy, in the presence of external electric and\nmagnetic fields. We extract the physical properties of the electron and hole\nwavefunctions, including the confinement energies, interaction energies,\nwavefunction lengths, and $g$-factors. For excitons, we measure the permanent\ndipole moment, polarizability, diamagnetic coefficient, and Zeeman splitting.\nThe carriers are determined to be in the strong confinement regime. Large range\nelectric field tunability, up to 7 meV, is demonstrated for excitons. We\nobserve a large reduction, up to one order of magnitude, in the diamagnetic\ncoefficient when rotating the magnetic field from Faraday to Voigt geometry due\nto the unique dot morphology. The complete spectroscopic characterization of\nthe fundamental properties of long-wavelength dot-in-a-well structures provides\ninsight for the applicability of quantum technologies based on quantum dots\nemitting at telecom wavelengths.\n", "  We examine the problem of finding the minimum number of Pauli measurements\nneeded to uniquely determine an arbitrary $n$-qubit pure state among all\nquantum states. We show that only $11$ Pauli measurements are needed to\ndetermine an arbitrary two-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum state\ntomography with $16$ measurements, and only $31$ Pauli measurements are needed\nto determine an arbitrary three-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum\nstate tomography with $64$ measurements. We demonstrate that our protocol is\nrobust under depolarizing error with simulated random pure states. We\nexperimentally test the protocol on two- and three-qubit systems with nuclear\nmagnetic resonance techniques. We show that the pure state tomography protocol\nsaves us a number of measurements without considerable loss of fidelity. We\ncompare our protocol with same-size sets of randomly selected Pauli operators\nand find that our selected set of Pauli measurements significantly outperforms\nthose random sampling sets. As a direct application, our scheme can also be\nused to reduce the number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in\nquantum optical systems.\n", "  Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology provides the most direct evidence for the\npresence of dark energy. This result is based on the assumption that the\nlook-back time evolution of SN Ia luminosity, after light-curve corrections,\nwould be negligible. Recent studies show, however, that the Hubble residual\n(HR) of SN Ia is correlated with the mass and morphology of host galaxies,\nimplying the possible dependence of SN Ia luminosity on host galaxy properties.\nIn order to investigate this more directly, we have initiated spectroscopic\nsurvey for the early-type host galaxies, for which population age and\nmetallicity can be more reliably determined from the absorption lines. As the\nfirst paper of the series, here we present the results from high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (>100 per pixel) spectra for 27 nearby host galaxies in\nthe southern hemisphere. For the first time in host galaxy studies, we find a\nsignificant (~3.9sigma) correlation between host galaxy mass (velocity\ndispersion) and population age, which is consistent with the \"downsizing\" trend\namong non-host early-type galaxies. This result is rather insensitive to the\nchoice of population synthesis models. Since we find no correlation with\nmetallicity, our result suggests that stellar population age is mainly\nresponsible for the relation between host mass and HR. If confirmed, this would\nimply that the luminosity evolution plays a major role in the systematic\nuncertainties of SN Ia cosmology.\n", "  It is known that there are two mechanisms for localizing a bulk fermion on a\nbrane, one is the well-known Yukawa coupling and the other is the new coupling\nproposed in [Phys. Rev. D 89, 086001 (2014)]. In this paper, we investigate\nlocalization and resonance spectrum of a bulk fermion on the same branes with\nthe two localization mechanisms. It is found that both the two mechanisms can\nresult in a volcano-like effective potential of the fermion Kaluza-Klein modes.\nThe left-chiral fermion zero mode can be localized on the brane and there exist\nsome discrete massive fermion Kaluza-Klein modes that quasilocalized on the\nbrane (also called fermion resonances). The number of the fermion resonances\nincreases linearly with the coupling parameter.\n", "  We report the enhancement of the thermoelectric power (TEP) in graphene with\nextremely low disorder. At high temperature we observe that the TEP is\nsubstantially larger than the prediction of the Mott relation, approaching to\nthe hydrodynamic limit due to strong inelastic scattering among the charge\ncarriers. However, closer to room temperature the inelastic\ncarrier-optical-phonon scattering becomes more significant and limits the TEP\nbelow the hydrodynamic prediction. We support our observation by employing a\nBoltzmann theory incorporating disorder, electron interactions, and optical\nphonons.\n", "  We investigate the electronic dispersion of the high-T$_{\\mathrm{c}}$ cuprate\nsuperconductors using the fully self-consistent version of the phenomenological\nmodel, where charge planar quasiparticles are coupled to spin fluctuations. The\ninputs we use ---the underlying (bare) band structure and the spin\nsusceptibility $\\chi$--- are extracted from fits of angle resolved\nphotoemission and inelastic neutron scattering data of underdoped\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.6}$ by T. Dahm and coworkers (T. Dahm et al., Nat. Phys.\n5, 217 (2009)). Our main results are: (i) We have confirmed the finding by T.\nDahm and coworkers that the main nodal kink is, for the present values of the\ninput parameters, determined by the upper branch of the hour-glass of $\\chi$.\nWe demonstrate that the properties of the kink depend qualitatively on the\nstrength of the charge-spin coupling. (ii) The effect of the resonance mode of\n$\\chi$ on the electronic dispersion strongly depends on its kurtosis in the\nquasimomentum space. A low (high) kurtosis implies a negligible (considerable)\neffect of the mode on the dispersion in the near-nodal region. (iii) The energy\nof the kink decreases as a function of the angle $\\theta$ between the Fermi\nsurface cut and the nodal direction, in qualitative agreement with recent\nexperimental observations. We clarify the trend and make a specific prediction\nconcerning the angular dependence of the kink energy in underdoped\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.6}$.\n", "  Asymptotically flat black holes in $2+1$ dimensions are a rarity. We study\nthe recently found black flower solutions (asymptotically flat black holes with\ndeformed horizons), static black holes, rotating black holes and the dynamical\nblack flowers (black holes with radiative gravitons ) of the purely quadratic\nversion of new massive gravity. We show how they appear in this theory and we\nalso show that they are also solutions to the infinite order extended version\nof the new massive gravity, that is the Born-Infeld extension of new massive\ngravity with an amputated Einsteinian piece. The same metrics also solve the\ntopologically extended versions of these theories, with modified conserved\ncharges and the thermodynamical quantities, such as the Wald entropy. Besides\nthese we find new conformally flat radiating type solutions to these extended\ngravity models. We also show that these metrics do not arise in Einstein's\ngravity coupled to physical perfect fluids.\n", "  We argue that Hartle-Hawking states in the Regge quantum gravity model\ngenerically contain non-trivial entanglement between gravity and matter fields.\nGeneric impossibility to talk about \"matter in a point of space\" is in line\nwith the idea of an emergent spacetime, and as such could be taken as a\npossible candidate for a criterion for a plausible theory of quantum gravity.\nFinally, this new entanglement could be seen as an additional \"effective\ninteraction\", which could possibly bring corrections to the weak equivalence\nprinciple.\n", "  Evolved stars are crucial pieces to understand the dependency of the planet\nformation mechanism on the stellar mass and to explore deeper the mechanism\ninvolved in star-planet interactions. Over the past ten years, we have\nmonitored about 1000 evolved stars for radial velocity variations in search for\nlow-mass companions under the Penn State - Torun Centre for Astronomy Planet\nSearch program with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Selected prospective candidates\nthat required higher RV precision measurements have been followed with HARPS-N\nat the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo under the TAPAS project.\n  We aim to detect planetary systems around evolved stars to be able to build\nsound statistics on the frequency and intrinsic nature of these systems, and to\ndeliver in-depth studies of selected planetary systems with evidence of\nstar-planet interaction processes. For HD 5583 we obtained 14 epochs of precise\nRV measurements collected over 2313 days with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET),\nand 22 epochs of ultra-precise HARPS-N data collected over 976 days. For BD+15\n2375 we collected 24 epochs of HET data over 3286 days and 25 epochs of HARPS-S\ndata over 902 days.\n  We report the discovery of two planetary mass objects orbiting two evolved\nRed Giant stars: HD~5583 has a m sin i = 5.78 M$_{J}$ companion at 0.529~AU in\na nearly circular orbit (e=0.076), the closest companion to a giant star\ndetected with the RV technique, and BD+15~2735 that with a m sin i= 1.06\nM$_{J}$ holds the record of the lightest planet found so far orbiting an\nevolved star (in a circular e=0.001, 0.576~AU orbit). These are the third and\nfourth planets found within the TAPAS project, a HARPS-N monitoring of evolved\nplanetary systems identified with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.\n", "  We report the discovery of DGSAT I, an ultra-diffuse, quenched galaxy located\n10.4 degrees in projection from the Andromeda galaxy (M31). This low-surface\nbrightness galaxy (mu_V = 24.8 mag/arcsec), found with a small amateur\ntelescope, appears unresolved in sub-arcsecond archival Subaru/Suprime-Cam\nimages, and hence has been missed by optical surveys relying on resolved star\ncounts, in spite of its relatively large effective radius (R_e(V) = 12 arcsec)\nand proximity (15 arcmin) to the well-known dwarf spheroidal galaxy And II. Its\nred color (V-I = 1.0), shallow Sersic index (n_V=0.68), and the absence of\ndetectable H-alpha emission are typical properties of dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nand suggest that it is mainly composed of old stars.\n  Initially interpreted as an interesting case of an isolated dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy in the local universe, our radial velocity measurement obtained with the\nBTA 6-meter telescope (V_h=5450 +/- 40 km/s) shows that this system is an\nM31-background galaxy associated with the filament of the Pisces-Perseus\nsupercluster. At the distance of this cluster (~78 Mpc), DGSAT I would have an\nR_e ~ 4.7 kpc and M_V ~-16.3$. Its properties resemble those of the\nultra-diffuse galaxies recently discovered in the Coma cluster. DGSAT I is the\nfirst case of these rare ultra-diffuse galaxies found in this galaxy cluster.\nUnlike the ultra-diffuse galaxies associated with the Coma and Virgo clusters,\nDGSAT I is found in a much lower density environment, which provides a fresh\nconstraint on the formation mechanisms for this intriguing class of galaxy.\n", "  A search for Lorentz- and CPT-violating signals in the double beta decay\nspectrum of $^{136}$Xe has been performed using an exposure of 100 kg$\\cdot$yr\nwith the EXO-200 detector. No significant evidence of the spectral modification\ndue to isotropic Lorentz-violation was found, and a two-sided limit of $-2.65\n\\times 10^{-5 } \\; \\textrm{GeV} < \\mathring{a}^{(3)}_{\\text{of}} < 7.60 \\times\n10^{-6} \\; \\textrm{GeV}$ (90% C.L.) is placed on the relevant coefficient\nwithin the Standard-Model Extension (SME). This is the first experimental study\nof the effect of the SME-defined oscillation-free and momentum-independent\nneutrino coupling operator on the double beta decay process.\n", "  The cosmic evolution of gamma-ray burst (GRB) luminosity is essential for\nrevealing the GRB physics and for using GRBs as cosmological probes. We\ninvestigate the luminosity evolution of long GRBs with a large sample of 258\n{\\em Swift}/BAT GRBs. Parameterized the peak luminosity of individual GRBs\nevolves as $L_{\\rm p}\\propto{\\rm }(1+z)^{k}$, we get $k=1.49\\pm0.19$ using the\nnon-parametric $\\tau$ statistics method without considering observational\nbiases of GRB trigger and redshift measurement. By modeling these biases with\nthe observed peak flux and characterizing the peak luminosity function of long\nGRBs as a smoothly broken power-law with a break that evolves as $L_{\\rm\nb}\\propto (1+z)^{k_{\\rm b}}$, we obtain $k_{\\rm b}=1.14^{+0.99}_{-0.47}$\nthrough simulations based on assumption that the long GRB rate follows the star\nformation rate (SFR) incorporating with cosmic metallicity history. The derived\n$k$ and $k_b$ values are systematically smaller than that reported in previous\npapers. By removing the observational biases of the GRB trigger and redshift\nmeasurement based on our simulation analysis, we generate mock {\\em complete}\nsamples of 258 and 1000 GRBs to examine how these biases affects on the $\\tau$\nstatistics method. We get $k=0.94\\pm 0.14$ and $k=0.80\\pm 0.09$ for the two\nsamples, indicating that these observational biases may lead to overestimate\nthe $k$ value. With the large uncertain of $k_b$ derived from our simulation\nanalysis, one even cannot convincingly argue a robust evolution feature of the\nGRB luminosity.\n", "  We investigate the Bose-Einstein condensation patterns, the critical and\nmulticritical behaviors of three-dimensional mixtures of bosonic gases with\nshort-range density-density interactions. These systems have a global U(1)+U(1)\nsymmetry, as the system Hamiltonian is invariant under independent U(1)\ntransformations acting on each species. In particular, we consider the\nthree-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model for two lattice bosonic gases coupled by\nan on-site inter-species density-density interaction. We study the phase\ndiagram and the critical behaviors along the transition lines characterized by\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation of one or both species. We present mean-field\ncalculations and numerical finite-size scaling analyses of quantum Monte Carlo\ndata. We also consider multicritical points, close to which it is possible to\nobserve the condensation of both gas components. We determine the possible\nmulticritical behaviors by using field-theoretical perturbative methods. We\nconsider the U(1)+U(1)-symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Phi4 theory and\ndetermine the corresponding stable fixed points of the renormalization-group\nflow. The analysis predicts that, in all cases, the multicritical behavior is\nanalogous to the one that would be observed in systems of two identical gases,\nwith an additional Z_2 exchange symmetry.\n", "  In this article we investigate the prospects for probing the strength of the\npossible non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in long baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments. We find that these experiments are sensitive to NSI\ncouplings down to the level of 0.01-0.1 depending on the oscillation channel\nand the baseline length, as well as on the detector's fiducial mass. We also\ninvestigate the interference of the leptonic CP angle $\\delta_{CP}$ with the\nconstraining of the NSI couplings. It is found that the interference is strong\nin the case of the $\\nu_{e}\\leftrightarrow\\nu_{\\mu}$ and\n$\\nu_{e}\\leftrightarrow\\nu_{\\tau}$ transitions but not significant in other\ntransitions. In our numerical analysis we apply the GLoBES software and use the\nLBNO setup as our benchmark.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the new hard pole contribution to the\n$P_{h\\perp}$-weighted single-transverse spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering. We perform the complete next-to-leading order calculation\nof the $P_{h\\perp}$-weighted cross section and show that the new hard pole\ncontribution is required in order to obtain the complete evolution equation for\nthe Qiu-Sterman function derived by different approaches.\n", "  High contrast imaging and spectroscopy provide unique constraints for\nexoplanet formation models as well as for planetary atmosphere models. But this\ncan be challenging because of the planet-to-star small angular separation and\nhigh flux ratio. Recently, optimized instruments like SPHERE and GPI were\ninstalled on 8m-class telescopes. These will probe young gazeous exoplanets at\nlarge separations (~1au) but, because of uncalibrated aberrations that induce\nspeckles in the coronagraphic images, they are not able to detect older and\nfainter planets. There are always aberrations that are slowly evolving in time.\nThey create quasi-static speckles that cannot be calibrated a posteriori with\nsufficient accuracy. An active correction of these speckles is thus needed to\nreach very high contrast levels (>1e7). This requires a focal plane wavefront\nsensor. Our team proposed the SCC, the performance of which was demonstrated in\nthe laboratory. As for all focal plane wavefront sensors, these are sensitive\nto chromatism and we propose an upgrade that mitigates the chromatism effects.\nFirst, we recall the principle of the SCC and we explain its limitations in\npolychromatic light. Then, we present and numerically study two upgrades to\nmitigate chromatism effects: the optical path difference method and the\nmultireference self-coherent camera. Finally, we present laboratory tests of\nthe latter solution.\n  We demonstrate in the laboratory that the MRSCC camera can be used as a focal\nplane wavefront sensor in polychromatic light using an 80 nm bandwidth at 640\nnm. We reach a performance that is close to the chromatic limitations of our\nbench: contrast of 4.5e-8 between 5 and 17 lambda/D.\n  The performance of the MRSCC is promising for future high-contrast imaging\ninstruments that aim to actively minimize the speckle intensity so as to detect\nand spectrally characterize faint old or light gaseous planets.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the experiments on coherent population\noscillations and coher- ent population trapping on the intercombination line of\n174Y b. The transition involves a change of the spin and thus can not be\ninterpreted in terms of an effective Lambda system. The reported experiments\nare done in the regime where both pump and probe fields can saturate the\ntransition. We demonstrate by both numerical and analytical calculations the\nappearance of the interference minimum as both pump and probe start saturating\nthe transition. We present an analytical result for the threshold probe power\nwhen the interference minimum can appear. We also present de- tailed study of\nthe appearance of the interference minimum when magnetic fields are applied.\nThe magnetic fields not only create Zeeman splittings but in addition make the\nsystem open because of the couplings to other levels. We show the possibility\nof interference minimum at the position of subharmonic resonances.\n", "  The supersonic motion of gravitating objects through a gaseous medium\nconstitutes a classical problem in theoretical astrophysics. Its application\ncovers a broad range of objects and scales from planets up to galaxies.\nEspecially the dynamical friction, caused by the forming wake behind the\nobject, plays an important role for the dynamics of the system. To calculate\nthe dynamical friction, standard formulae, based on linear theory are often\nused. It is our goal to check the general validity of these formulae and\nprovide suitable expressions for the dynamical friction acting on the moving\nobject, based on the basic physical parameters of the problem. We perform\nsequences of high resolution numerical studies of rigid bodies moving\nsupersonically through a homogeneous medium, and calculate the total drag\nacting on the object, which is the sum of gravitational and hydro drag. We\nstudy cases without gravity with purely hydrodynamical drag, as well as\ngravitating objects. From the final equilibrium state of the simulations, we\ncompute for gravitating objects the dynamical friction by direct numerical\nintegration of the gravitational pull acting on the embedded object. The\nnumerical experiments confirm the known scaling laws for the dependence of the\ndynamical friction on the basic physical parameters as derived in earlier\nsemi-analytical studies. As a new important result we find that the shock's\nstand-off distance is revealed as the minimum spatial interaction scale of\ndynamical friction. Below this radius, the gas settles into a hydrostatic\nstate, which causes no net gravitational pull onto the moving body. Finally, we\nderive an analytic estimate for the stand-off distance that can be used to\ncalculate the dynamical friction force.\n", "  The emission from open cavities with non-integrable features remains a\nchallenging problem of practical as well as fundamental relevance.\nSquare-shaped dielectric microcavities provide a favorable case study with\ngeneric implications for other polygonal resonators. We report on a joint\nexperimental and theoretical study of square-shaped organic microlasers\nexhibiting a far-field emission that is strongly concentrated in the directions\nparallel to the side walls of the cavity. A semiclassical model for the\nfar-field distributions is developed that is in agreement with even fine\nfeatures of the experimental findings. Comparison of the model calculations\nwith the experimental data allows the precise identification of the lasing\nmodes and their emission mechanisms, providing strong support for a physically\nintuitive ray-dynamical interpretation. Special attention is paid to the role\nof diffraction and the finite side length.\n", "  (Abridged) We investigate the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in\nthe central 300 kpc of the Virgo cluster using deep imaging obtained as part of\nthe NGVS. We build a sample of nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the\nyet unexplored $-14 < M_{g} < -8$ magnitude range. The observed distribution of\napparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial models with\nnormally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a\nBayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model\nparameters, which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account\nfor individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For this\npopulation we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.43, and a mean triaxiality\nT=0.16. This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family\nof thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57.\nWe additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group\nsatellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly\nlarger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round\napparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We\nfinally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of\nmore massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of\nsimilar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this\nlow-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the\ngalaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in\ndenser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity\ngalaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects\nsuggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at\nlow masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role.\n", "  An interferometric imaging technique has been proposed to instantly measure\nthe diameter of individual spherical dust particles suspended in a gas\ndischarge plasma. The technique is based on the defocused image analysis of\nboth spherical particles and their binary agglomerates. Above a critical\ndiameter, the defocused images of spherical particles contain stationary\ninterference fringe patterns and the fringe number increases with particle\ndiameters. Below this critical diameter, the particle size has been measured\nusing the rotational interference fringe patterns which appear only on the\ndefocused images of binary agglomerates. In this case, a lower cut-off limit of\nparticle diameter has been predicted, below which no such rotational fringe\npatterns are observed for the binary agglomerates. The method can be useful as\na diagnostics for complex plasma experiments on earth as well as under\nmicrogravity condition.\n", "  The phenomenon of multiple populations in globular clusters is still far from\nunderstood, with several proposed mechanisms to explain the observed behaviour.\nThe study of elemental and isotopic abundance patterns are crucial for\ninvestigating the differences among candidate pollution mechanisms. We derive\nmagnesium isotopic ratios for 13 stars in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC\n104) to provide new, detailed information about the nucleosynthesis that has\noccurred within the cluster. For the first time, the impact of 3D model stellar\natmospheres on the derived Mg isotopic ratios is investigated. Using both\ntailored 1D atmospheric models and 3D hydrodynamical models, we derive\nmagnesium isotopic ratios from four features of MgH near 5135{\\AA} in 13 giants\nnear the tip of the RGB, using high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra.\nWe derive the magnesium isotopic ratios for all stars and find no significant\noffset of the isotopic distribution between the pristine and the polluted\npopulations. Furthermore, we do not detect any statistically significant\ndifferences in the spread in the Mg isotopes in either population. No trends\nwere found between the Mg isotopes and [Al/Fe]. The inclusion of 3D atmospheres\nhas a significant impact on the derived 25Mg/24Mg ratio, increasing it by a\nfactor of up to 2.5, compared to 1D. The 26Mg/24Mg ratio, on the other hand,\nessentially remains unchanged. We confirm the results seen from other globular\nclusters, where no strong variation in the isotopic ratios is observed between\nstellar populations, for observed ranges in [Al/Fe]. We see no evidence for any\nsignificant activation of the Mg-Al burning chain. The use of 3D atmospheres\ncauses an increase of a factor of up to 2.5 in the fraction of 25Mg, resolving\npart of the discrepancy between the observed isotopic fraction and the\npredictions from pollution models.\n", "  Functionals of Brownian/non-Brownian motions have diverse applications and\nattracted a lot of interest of scientists. This paper focuses on deriving the\nforward and backward fractional Feynman-Kac equations describing the\ndistribution of the functionals of the space and time tempered anomalous\ndiffusion, belonging to the continuous time random walk class. Several examples\nof the functionals are explicitly treated, including the occupation time in\nhalf-space, the first passage time, the maximal displacement, the fluctuations\nof the occupation fraction, and the fluctuations of the time-averaged position.\n", "  Motivated by the formal argument that a non-zero shear modulus is the result\nof averaging over a constrained configurations space, we demonstrate that the\nshear modulus calculated over a range of temperatures and averaging times can\nbe expressed (relative to its infinite frequency value) as a single function of\nthe mean squared displacement. This result is shown to hold for both a\nglass-liquid and a crystal-liquid system.\n", "  We numerically investigate the electronic structures around a vortex core in\na bilayer superconducting system, with s-wave pairing, Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling and Zeeman magnetic field, with use of the quasiclassical Green's\nfunction method. The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase and the so-called\npair-density wave (PDW) phase appear in the temperature-magnetic-field phase\ndiagram in a bulk uniform system [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134514 (2012)]. In the low\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the layers, the zero-energy vortex bound states\nin the BCS phase are split by the Zeeman magnetic field. On the other hand, the\nPDW state appears in the high magnetic field, and sign of the order parameter\nis opposite between the layers. We find that the vortex core suddenly shrinks\nand the zero-energy bound states appear by increasing the magnetic field\nthrough the BCS-PDW transition. We discuss the origin of the change in vortex\ncore structure between the BCS and PDW states by clarifying the relation\nbetween the vortex bound states and the bulk energy spectra. In the high\nmagnetic field region, the PDW state and vortex bound states are protected by\nthe spin-orbit coupling. These characteristic behaviors in the PDW state can be\nobserved by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.\n", "  Thanks to the huge amount of gamma-ray pulsar photons collected by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope since June 2008, it is now possible to constrain gamma-ray\ngeometrical models by comparing simulated and observed light-curve\nmorphological characteristics. We assumed vacuum-retarded dipole pulsar\nmagnetic field and tested simulated and observed morphological light-curve\ncharacteristics in the framework of two pole emission geometries, Polar Cap\n(PC), radio, and Slot Gap (SG), and Outer Gap (OG)/One Pole Caustic (OPC)\nemission geometries. We compared simulated and observed/estimated light-curve\nmorphological parameters as a function of observable and non-observable pulsar\nparameters. The PC model gives the poorest description of the LAT pulsar\nlight-curve morphology. The OPC best explains both the observed gamma-ray peak\nmultiplicity and shape classes. The OPC and SG models describe the observed\ngamma-ray peak-separation distribution for low- and high-peak separations,\nrespectively. This suggests that the OPC geometry best explains the single-peak\nstructure but does not manage to describe the widely separated peaks predicted\nin the framework of the SG model as the emission from the two magnetic\nhemispheres. The OPC radio-lag distribution shows higher agreement with\nobservations suggesting that assuming polar radio emission, the gamma-ray\nemission regions are likely to be located in the outer magnetosphere. The\nlarger agreement between simulated and LAT estimations in the framework of the\nOPC suggests that the OPC model best predicts the observed variety of profile\nshapes. The larger agreement between observations and the OPC model jointly\nwith the need to explain the abundant 0.5 separated peaks with two-pole\nemission geometries, calls for thin OPC gaps to explain the single-peak\ngeometry but highlights the need of two-pole caustic emission geometry to\nexplain widely separated peaks.\n", "  The charge ratio, $R_\\mu = N_{\\mu^+}/N_{\\mu^-}$, for cosmogenic multiple-muon\nevents observed at an under- ground depth of 2070 mwe has been measured using\nthe magnetized MINOS Far Detector. The multiple-muon events, recorded nearly\ncontinuously from August 2003 until April 2012, comprise two independent data\nsets imaged with opposite magnetic field polarities, the comparison of which\nallows the systematic uncertainties of the measurement to be minimized. The\nmultiple-muon charge ratio is determined to be $R_\\mu = 1.104 \\pm 0.006 {\\rm\n\\,(stat.)} ^{+0.009}_{-0.010} {\\rm \\,(syst.)} $. This measurement complements\nprevious determinations of single-muon and multiple-muon charge ratios at\nunderground sites and serves to constrain models of cosmic ray interactions at\nTeV energies.\n", "  Astrophysical phenomena involving massive black holes (BHs) in close binaries\nare expected to leave detectable signatures in the electromagnetic and\ngravitational-wave spectrum. Such imprints may provide precious information to\nprobe the space-time around rotating BHs and to reveal new insights on the\nnature of gravity in the strong-field regime. To support this observational\nwindow, it is crucial to develop suitable tests to verify the predictions of\nGeneral Relativity. In this framework, the metric recently proposed by\nJohannsen and Psaltis parametrizes strong-field deviations from a Kerr\nspace-time in a theory-independent way. In the following, we make use of this\napproach to describe the tidal field produced by spinning BHs. We compute the\ngravito-magnetic and gravito-electric tidal tensors for particles moving on\nequatorial circular geodesics, comparing our results with those obtained in the\nstandard General Relativity scenario. Our calculations show significant\ndifferences even for distances far form the last stable orbit, which may affect\nthe evolution of the binary and leave detectable signatures. We test our\nframework computing quasiequilibrium sequences of BH-white dwarf systems by\nmeans of the affine model, for different binary configurations.\n", "  Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) allow an\nalternative formulation of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm\nintroduced by White. Here, we describe how non-abelian spin symmetry can be\nexploited in MPSs and MPOs by virtue of the Wigner--Eckart theorem at the\nexample of the spin-adapted quantum chemical Hamiltonian operator.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic properties of matter at vanishing temperature for\nnon-extreme values of the isospin chemical potential and of the strange quark\nchemical potential. From the leading order pressure obtained by maximizing the\nstatic chiral Lagrangian density we derive a simple expression for the equation\nof state in the pion condensed phase and in the kaon condensed phase. We find\nan analytical expression for the maximum of the ratio between the energy\ndensity and the Stefan-Boltzmann energy density as well as for the isospin\nchemical potential at the peak both in good agreement with lattice simulations\nof quantum chromodynamics. We speculate on the location of the crossover from\nthe Bose-Einstein condensate state to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state by a\nsimple analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the system. For $\\mu_I\n\\gtrsim 2 m_\\pi$ the leading order chiral perturbation theory breaks down; as\nan example it underestimates the energy density of the system and leads to a\nwrong asymptotic behavior.\n", "  Rare $d$-electron derived heavy-fermion properties of the solid-solution\nseries LaCu$_3$Ru$_x$Ti$_{4-x}$O$_{12}$ were studied for $1 \\leq x \\leq 4$ by\nresistivity, susceptibility, specific-heat measurements, and magnetic-resonance\ntechniques. The pure ruthenate ($x = 4$) is a heavy-fermion metal characterized\nby a resistivity proportional to $T^2$ at low temperatures $T$. The coherent\nKondo lattice formed by the localized Ru 4$d$ electrons is screened by the\nconduction electrons leading to strongly enhanced effective electron masses. By\nincreasing titanium substitution the Kondo lattice becomes diluted resulting in\nsingle-ion Kondo properties like in the paradigm $4f$-based heavy-fermion\ncompound Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$Cu$_{2.05}$Si$_2$ [M. Ocko {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B\n\\textbf{64}, 195106 (2001)]. In LaCu$_3$Ru$_x$Ti$_{4-x}$O$_{12}$ the\nheavy-fermion behavior finally breaks down on crossing the metal-to-insulator\ntransition close to $x = 2$.\n", "  This work was motivated by the quest for observing interference of\nfractionally charged quasi particles. Here, we study the behavior of an\nelectronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) at the integer quantum Hall effect\n(IQHE) regime at filling factors greater than one. Both the visibility and the\ndrift velocity were measured, and were found to be highly correlated as\nfunction of filling factor. As the filling factor approached unity, the\nvisibility quenched, not to recover for filling factors smaller than unity.\nAlternatively, the velocity saturated around a minimal value at unity filling\nfactor. We highlight the significant role interactions between the interfering\nedge and the bulk play, as well as that of the defining potential at the edge.\nShot noise measurements suggest that phase-averaging (due to phase\nrandomization), rather than single particle decoherence, is likely to be the\ncause of the dephasing in the fractional regime.\n", "  Aims. We demonstrate the high multiplex advantage of crowded field 3D\nspectroscopy using the new integral field spectrograph MUSE by means of a\nspectroscopic analysis of more than 12,000 individual stars in the globular\ncluster NGC 6397. Methods. The stars are deblended with a PSF fitting\ntechnique, using a photometric reference catalogue from HST as prior, including\nrelative positions and brightnesses. This catalogue is also used for a first\nanalysis of the extracted spectra, followed by an automatic in-depth analysis\nusing a full-spectrum fitting method based on a large grid of PHOENIX spectra.\nResults. With 18,932 spectra from 12,307 stars in NGC 6397 we have analysed the\nlargest sample so far available for a single globular cluster. We derived a\nmean radial velocity of vrad=17.84+-0.07 km/s and a mean metallicity of\n[Fe/H]=-2.120+-0.002, with the latter seemingly varying with temperature for\nstars on the RGB. We determine T_eff and [Fe/H] from the spectra, and log g\nfrom HST photometry. This is the first very comprehensive HRD for a globular\ncluster based on the analysis of several thousands of stellar spectra, ranging\nfrom the main sequence to the tip of the RGB. Furthermore, two interesting\nobjects were identified with one being a post-AGB star and the other a possible\nmillisecond-pulsar companion.\n", "  The optical and optical/near-infrared pseudo-bolometric light curves of 85\nstripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are constructed using a consistent method\nand a standard cosmology. The light curves are analysed to derive temporal\ncharacteristics and peak luminosity $L_{\\mathrm{p}}$, enabling the construction\nof a luminosity function. Subsequently, the mass of $^{56}$Ni synthesised in\nthe explosion, along with the ratio of ejecta mass to ejecta kinetic energy,\nare found. Analysis shows that host-galaxy extinction is an important factor in\naccurately determining luminosity values as it is significantly greater than\nGalactic extinction in most cases. It is found that broad-lined SNe~Ic\n(SNe~Ic-BL) and gamma-ray burst SNe are the most luminous subtypes with a\ncombined median $L_{\\mathrm{p}}$, in erg s$^{-1}$, of\nlog($L_{\\mathrm{p}})=43.00$ compared to $42.51$ for SNe Ic, $42.50$ for SNe~Ib,\nand $42.36$ for SNe~IIb. It is also found that SNe~Ic-BL synthesise\napproximately twice the amount of $^{56}$Ni compared with SNe~Ic, Ib, and IIb,\nwith median $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.34$, 0.16, 0.14, and 0.11 M$_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. SNe~Ic-BL, and to a lesser extent SNe~Ic, typically rise from\n$L_{\\mathrm{p}}/2$ to $L_{\\mathrm{p}}$ more quickly than SNe~Ib/IIb;\nconsequently, their light curves are not as broad.\n", "  In four dimensions, the most general metric admitting two Killing vectors and\na rank-two Killing tensor can be parameterized by ten arbitrary functions of a\nsingle variable. We show that picking a special vierbien, reducing the system\nto eight functions, implies the existence of two geodesic and share-free, null\ncongruences, generated by two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor.\nThus, if the spacetime is an Einstein manifold, the Goldberg-Sachs theorem\nimplies it is Petrov type D, and by explicit construction, is in the Carter\nclass. Hence, our analysis provide an straightforward connection between the\nmost general integrable structure and the Carter family of spacetimes.\n", "  The Star formation rate (SFR) is a crucial parameter to investigate galaxy\nevolution. At low redshift the cosmic SFR density declines smoothly, and\nmassive active galaxies become passive, reducing their star formation activity.\nThis implies that the bulk of the SFR density at low redshift is mainly driven\nby low mass objects. We investigate the properties of a sample of low\nluminosity Far-Infrared (FIR) sources selected at 250 microns from Pappalardo\net al. (2015). We have collected data from Ultraviolet to FIR to perform a\nmulti-wavelengths analysis. The main goal is to investigate the correlation\nbetween SFR, stellar mass, and dust mass for a galaxy population with a wide\nrange in dust content and stellar mass, including the low mass regime that most\nprobably dominates the SFR density at low z. We define a main sample of ~800\nsources with full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) coverage between 0.15 <\nlambda < 500 microns and an extended sample with ~5000 sources in which we\nremove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands. We analyze\nboth samples with two different SED fitting methods: MAGPHYS and CIGALE. In the\nSFR versus stellar mass plane our samples occupy a region included between\nlocal spirals and higher redshift star forming galaxies. The galaxies subsample\nwith the higher masses (M* > 3e10 Msol) does not lie on the main sequence, but\nshows a small offset, as a consequence of the decreased star formation. Low\nmass galaxies (M* < 1e10 Msol) settle in the main sequence with SFR and stellar\nmass consistent with local spirals. Deep Herschel data allow the identification\nof a mixed galaxy population, with galaxies still in an assembly phase, or\ngalaxies at the beginning of their passive evolution. We find that the dust\nluminosity is the parameter that discriminates these two galaxy populations.\n", "  We model the dust and free-free continuum emission in the high-mass\nstar-forming region Sagittarius B2 in order to reconstruct the\nthree-dimensional density and dust temperature distribution, as a crucial input\nto follow-up studies of the gas velocity field and molecular abundances. We\nemploy the three-dimensional radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to calculate\nthe dust temperature self-consistently, provided a given initial density\ndistribution. This density distribution of the entire cloud complex is then\nrecursively reconstructed based on available continuum maps, including both\nsingle-dish and high-resolution interferometric maps covering a wide frequency\nrange (40 GHz - 4 THz). The model covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100\nau, i.e. a spatial dynamic range of 10^5.\n  We find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2 can be reasonably\nwell fitted by applying a superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like\ndensity profiles. In order to reproduce the spectral energy distribution, we\nposition Sgr B2(N) along the line of sight behind the plane containing Sgr\nB2(M). We find that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas mass of 8.0\nx 10^6 Msun within a diameter of 45 pc, corresponding to an averaged gas\ndensity of 170 Msun/pc^3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400 Msun and 20700\nMsun and luminosities of 1.8 x 10^6 Lsun and 1.2 x 10^7 Lsun for Sgr B2(N) and\nSgr B2(M), respectively. We report H_2 column densities of 2.9 x 10^24 cm^-2\nfor Sgr B2(N) and 2.5 x 10^24 cm^-2 for Sgr B2(M) in a 40\" beam. For Sgr B2(S),\nwe derive a stellar mass of 1100 Msun, a luminosity of 6.6 x 10^5 Lsun and a\nH_2 column density of 2.2 x 10^24 cm^-2 in a 40\" beam. We calculate a star\nformation efficiency of 5% for Sgr B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M), indicating that\nmost of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been converted to stars or\ndispersed.\n", "  We present the FARGO3D code, recently publicly released. It is a\nmagnetohydrodynamics code developed with special emphasis on protoplanetary\ndisks physics and planet-disk interactions, and parallelized with MPI. The\nhydrodynamics algorithms are based on finite difference upwind, dimensionally\nsplit methods. The magnetohydrodynamics algorithms consist of the constrained\ntransport method to preserve the divergence-free property of the magnetic field\nto machine accuracy, coupled to a method of characteristics for the evaluation\nof electromotive forces and Lorentz forces. Orbital advection is implemented,\nand an N-body solver is included to simulate planets or stars interacting with\nthe gas. We present our implementation in detail and present a number of widely\nknown tests for comparison purposes. One strength of FARGO3D is that it can run\non both \"Graphical Processing Units\" (GPUs) or \"Central Processing unit\"\n(CPUs), achieving large speed up with respect to CPU cores. We describe our\nimplementation choices, which allow a user with no prior knowledge of GPU\nprogramming to develop new routines for the CPU, and have them translated\nautomatically for the GPU.\n", "  The detection reliability of weak signals is a critical issue in many\nastronomical contexts and may have severe consequences for determining number\ncounts and luminosity functions, but also for optimising the use of telescope\ntime in follow-up observations. Because of its optimal properties, one of the\nmost popular and widely-used detection technique is the matched filter (MF).\nThis is a linear filter designed to maximise the detectability of a signal of\nknown structure that is buried in additive Gaussian random noise. In this work\nwe show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the\nsearched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)\nor an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this\ntechnique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the\nprobability of false detection. This is because the correct use of the MF\nrelies upon a-priori knowledge of the position of the signal of interest. In\nthe absence of this information, the statistical significance of features that\nare actually noise is overestimated and detections claimed that are actually\nspurious. For this reason, we present an alternative method of computing the\nprobability of false detection that is based on the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the peaks of a random field. It is able to provide a correct\nestimate of the probability of false detection for the one-, two- and\nthree-dimensional case. We apply this technique to a real two-dimensional\ninterferometric map obtained with ALMA.\n", "  Radial velocity planet search surveys of nearby Solar-type stars have shown a\nstrong deficit of brown dwarf companions within $\\sim5\\,\\mathrm{AU}$. There is\npresently no comprehensive explanation of this lack of brown dwarf companions,\ntherefore, increasing the sample of such objects is crucial to understand their\nformation and evolution. Based on precise radial velocities obtained using the\nSOPHIE spectrograph at Observatoire de Haute-Provence we characterise the\norbital parameters of $15$ companions to solar-type stars and constrain their\ntrue mass using astrometric data from the Hipparcos space mission. The nine\ncompanions not shown to be stellar in nature have minimum masses ranging from\n~$13$ to $70\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, and are well distributed across the\nplanet/brown dwarf mass regime, making them an important contribution to the\nknown population of massive companions around solar-type stars. We characterise\nsix companions as stellar in nature with masses ranging from a minimum mass of\n$76 \\pm 4\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ to a mass of $0.35 \\pm\n0.03\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. The orbital parameters of two previously known\nsub-stellar candidates are improved.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of our search for and study of $z\n\\gtrsim 6$ galaxy candidates behind the third Frontier Fields (FF) cluster,\nMACSJ0717.5+3745, and its parallel field, combining data from Hubble and\nSpitzer. We select 39 candidates using the Lyman Break technique, for which the\nclear non-detection in optical make the extreme mid-$z$ interlopers hypothesis\nunlikely. We also take benefit from $z \\gtrsim 6$ samples selected using\nprevious Frontier Fields datasets of Abell 2744 and MACS0416 to improve the\nconstraints on the properties of very high-redshift objects. We compute the\nredshift and the physical properties, such emission lines properties, star\nformation rate, reddening, and stellar mass for all Frontier Fields objects\nfrom their spectral energy distribution using templates including nebular\nemission lines. We study the relationship between several physical properties\nand confirm the trend already observed in previous surveys for evolution of\nstar formation rate with galaxy mass, and between the size and the UV\nluminosity of our candidates. The analysis of the evolution of the UV\nLuminosity Function with redshift seems more compatible with an evolution of\ndensity. Moreover, no robust $z\\ge$8.5 object is selected behind the cluster\nfield, and few $z$$\\sim$9 candidates have been selected in the two previous\ndatasets from this legacy survey, suggesting a strong evolution in the number\ndensity of galaxies between $z$$\\sim$8 and 9. Thanks to the use of the lensing\ncluster, we study the evolution of the star formation rate density produced by\ngalaxies with L$>$0.03L$^{\\star}$, and confirm the strong decrease observed\nbetween $z$$\\sim$8 and 9.\n", "  We present results for the QED contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment\nof the muon containing closed electron loops. The main focus is on perturbative\ncorrections at four-loop order where the external photon couples to the\nexternal muon. Furthermore, all four-loop contributions involving\nsimultaneously a closed electron and tau loop are computed. In combination with\nour recent results on the light-by-light-type corrections (see Ref.\n\\cite{Kurz:2015bia}) the complete four-loop electron-loop contribution to the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been obtained with an independent\ncalculation. Our calculation is based on an asymptotic expansion in the ratio\nof the electron and the muon mass and shows the importance of higher order\nterms in this ratio. We perform a detailed comparison with results available in\nthe literature and find good numerical agreement.\n  As a by-product we present analytic results for the on-shell muon mass and\nwave function renormalization constants at three-loop order including massive\nclosed electron and tau loops, which we also calculated using the method of\nasymptotic expansion.\n", "  Accurate estimation of the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is important\nto understand the cluster merger process and further the formation and\nevolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we\nexplore a baryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters by using\nhydrodynamical simulations. We find that the baryons play an important role in\naccelerating the merger process. The merger timescale decreases with increasing\nthe gas fraction of galaxy clusters. For example, the merger timescale is\nshortened by a factor of up to 3 for merging clusters with gas fractions 0.15,\ncompared with the timescale obtained with zero gas fractions. The baryonic\neffect is significant for a wide range of merger parameters and especially more\nsignificant for nearly head-on mergers and high merging velocities. The\nbaryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is expected to have\nimpacts on the structure formation in the universe, such as the cluster mass\nfunction and massive substructures in galaxy clusters, and a bias of \"no-gas\"\nmay exist in the results obtained from the dark matter-only cosmological\nsimulations.\n", "  We study the lowest energy configurations of an equimolar binary mixture of\nclassical pointlike particles with charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, such that\n$q=Q_2/Q_1\\in [0,1]$. The particles interact pairwisely via 3D Coulomb\npotential and are confined to a 2D plane with a homogeneous neutralizing\nbackground charge density. In a recent paper by M. Antlanger and G. Kahl [Cond.\nMat. Phys. {\\bf 16}, 43501 (2013)], using numerical computations based on\nevolutionary algorithm, six fully mixed structures were identified for $0\\le\nq\\lesssim 0.59$, while the separation of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ pure hexagonal phases\nminimizes the energy for $0.59\\lesssim q<1$. Here, we introduce a novel\nstructure which consists in the separation of two phases, the pure hexagonal\none formed by a fraction of particles with the larger charge $Q_1$ and the\nother fixed one containing different numbers of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ charges. Using\nan analytic method based on an expansion of the interaction energy in Misra\nfunctions we show that this novel structure provides the lowest energy in two\nintervals of $q$ values, $0<q\\lesssim 0.04707$ and $0.58895\\lesssim q\\lesssim\n0.61367$. This fact might inspire numerical methods, for both Coulomb and\nYukawa interactions, to test more general separations which go beyond the\nseparation of two pure phases.\n", "  We present well-sampled optical observations of the bright Type Ia supernova\n(SN~Ia) SN 2011fe in M101. Our data, starting from $\\sim16$ days before maximum\nlight and extending to $\\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented\ntime series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN~Ia. Fitting the\nearly-time rising light curve, we find that the luminosity evolution of SN\n2011fe follows a $t^n$ law, with the index $n$ being close to 2.0 in the $VRI$\nbands but slightly larger in the $U$ and $B$ bands. Combining the published\nultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution\nof UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger\nUV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe~Ia with\nsimilar $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons\nin the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster\ndecline at late phases ($t\\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the\nejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons. These results favor the\nnotion that SN 2011fe might have a progenitor system with relatively lower\nmetallicity. On the other hand, the early-phase spectra exhibit prominent\nhigh-velocity features (HVFs) of O~I $\\lambda$7773 and the Ca~II~NIR triplet,\nbut only barely detectable in Si~II~6355. This difference can be caused either\nby an ionization/temperature effect or an abundance enhancement scenario for\nthe formation of HVFs; it suggests that the photospheric temperature of SN\n2011fe is intrinsically low, perhaps owing to incomplete burning during the\nexplosion of the white dwarf.\n", "  We present our investigation into the long-term variability of the X-ray\nobscuration and optical-UV-X-ray continuum in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. In\n2013 and 2014, the Swift observatory monitored NGC 5548 on average every day or\ntwo, with archival observations reaching back to 2005, totalling about 670 ks\nof observing time. Both broadband spectral modelling and temporal rms\nvariability analysis are applied to the Swift data. We disentangle the\nvariability caused by absorption, due to an obscuring weakly-ionised outflow\nnear the disk, from variability of the intrinsic continuum components (the soft\nX-ray excess and the power-law) originating from the disk and its associated\ncoronae. The spectral model that we apply to this extensive Swift data is the\nglobal model that we derived for NGC 5548 from analysis of the stacked spectra\nfrom our multi-satellite campaign of summer 2013 (including XMM-Newton, NuSTAR\nand HST). The results of our Swift study show that changes in the covering\nfraction of the obscurer is the primary and dominant cause of variability in\nthe soft X-ray band on timescales of 10 days to ~ 5 months. The obscuring\ncovering fraction of the X-ray source is found to range between 0.7 and nearly\n1.0. The contribution of the soft excess component to the X-ray variability is\noften much less than that of the obscurer, but it becomes comparable when the\noptical-UV continuum flares up. We find that the soft excess is consistent with\nbeing the high-energy tail of the optical-UV continuum and can be explained by\nwarm Comptonisation: up-scattering of the disk seed photons in a warm,\noptically thick corona as part of the inner disk. To this date, the Swift\nmonitoring of NGC 5548 shows that the obscurer has been continuously present in\nour line of sight for at least 4 years (since at least February 2012).\n", "  We determine the ultimate classical information capacity of a linear\ntime-invariant bosonic channel with additive phase-insensitive Gaussian noise.\nThis channel can model fiber-optic communication at power levels below the\nthreshold for significant nonlinear effects. We provide a general\ncontinuous-time result that gives the ultimate capacity for such a channel\noperating in the quasimonochromatic regime under an average power constraint.\nThis ultimate capacity is compared with corresponding results for heterodyne\nand homodyne detection over the same channel.\n", "  Two low-mass pre-white dwarfs, which could be precursors of ELM white dwarfs,\nhave been observed to show multiperiodic photometric variations. They could\nconstitute a new class of pulsating low-mass pre-white dwarf stars. We present\na detailed nonadiabatic pulsation study of such stars, employing full\nevolutionary sequences of low-mass He-core pre-white dwarf models. We have\nconsidered models in which element diffusion is accounted for and also models\nin which it is neglected. We confirm and explore in detail a new instability\nstrip in the domain of low gravities and low effective temperatures of the\n$T_{\\rm eff}-\\log g$ diagram, where low-mass pre-white dwarfs are currently\nfound. The destabilized modes are radial and nonradial $p$ and $g$ modes\nexcited by the $\\kappa-\\gamma$ mechanism acting mainly at the zone of the\nsecond partial ionization of He, with non-negligible contributions from the\nregion of the first partial ionization of He and the partial ionization of H.\nThe computations with element diffusion are unable to explain the pulsations\nobserved in the two known pulsating pre-white dwarfs, suggesting that element\ndiffusion might be inhibited at these stages of the pre-white dwarf evolution.\nOur nonadiabatic models without diffusion, on the other hand, naturally explain\nthe existence and range of periods of the pulsating pre-white dwarf star WASP\nJ1628$+$10B, although they fail to explain the pulsations of WASP J0247$-$25B,\nthe other known member of the class, indicating that the He abundance in the\ndriving region of this star might be substantially larger than predicted by our\nmodels. Further discoveries of additional members of this new class of\npulsating stars and their analysis in the context of the theoretical background\npresented in this paper will shed new light on the evolutionary history of\ntheir progenitor stars.\n", "  The structure of $^{35}$P was studied with a one-proton knockout reaction\nat88~MeV/u from a $^{36}$S projectile beam at NSCL. The $\\gamma$ rays from\nthedepopulation of excited states in $^{35}$P were detected with GRETINA,\nwhilethe $^{35}$P nuclei were identified event-by-event in the focal plane of\ntheS800 spectrograph. The level scheme of $^{35}$P was deduced up to 7.5 MeV\nusing$\\gamma-\\gamma$ coincidences. The observed levels were attributed to\nprotonremovals from the $sd$-shell and also from the deeply-bound $p\\_{1/2}$\norbital.The orbital angular momentum of each state was derived from the\ncomparisonbetween experimental and calculated shapes of individual\n($\\gamma$-gated)parallel momentum distributions. Despite the use of different\nreactions andtheir associate models, spectroscopic factors, $C^2S$, derived\nfrom the$^{36}$S $(-1p)$ knockout reaction agree with those obtained earlier\nfrom$^{36}$S($d$,\\nuc{3}{He}) transfer, if a reduction factor $R\\_s$, as\ndeducedfrom inclusive one-nucleon removal cross sections, is applied to the\nknockout transitions.In addition to the expected proton-hole configurations,\nother states were observedwith individual cross sections of the order of\n0.5~mb. Based on their shiftedparallel momentum distributions, their decay\nmodes to negative parity states,their high excitation energy (around 4.7~MeV)\nand the fact that they were notobserved in the ($d$,\\nuc{3}{He}) reaction, we\npropose that they may resultfrom a two-step mechanism or a nucleon-exchange\nreaction with subsequent neutronevaporation. Regardless of the mechanism, that\ncould not yet be clarified, thesestates likely correspond to neutron core\nexcitations in \\nuc{35}{P}. Thisnewly-identified pathway, although weak, offers\nthe possibility to selectivelypopulate certain intruder configurations that are\notherwise hard to produceand identify.\n", "  This paper studies the dependence of the CaIIH line core brightness on the\nstrength and inclination of photospheric magnetic field, and on the parameters\nof convective and wave motions in a facular region at the solar disc center. We\nuse three simultaneous datasets obtained at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope\n(Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife): (1) spectra of BaII 4554 A line registered\nwith the instrument TESOS to measure the variations of intensity and velocity\nthrough the photosphere up to the temperature minimum; (2) spectropolarimetric\ndata in FeI 1.56 $\\mu$m lines (registered with the instrument TIP II) to\nmeasure photospheric magnetic fields; (3) filtergrams in CaIIH that give\ninformation about brightness fluctuations in the chromosphere. The results show\nthat the CaIIH brightness in the facula strongly depends on the power of waves\nwith periods in the 5-min range, that propagate upwards, and also on the phase\nshift between velocity oscillations at the bottom photosphere and around the\ntemperature minimum height, measured from BaII line. The CaIIH brightness is\nmaximum at locations where the phase shift between temperature and velocity\noscillations lies within 0-100 degrees. There is an indirect influence of\nconvective motions on the CaIIH brightness. Namely, the higher is the amplitude\nof convective velocities and the larger is the height where they change their\ndirection of motion, the brighter is the facula. Altogether, our results lead\nto conclusions that facular regions appear bright not only because of the\nWilson depression in magnetic structures, but also due to real heating.\n", "  We correct erroneous conclusions from Ref.[1] regarding the values of various\ncritical exponents, calculated to the two-loop order, and argue that\n$\\epsilon$-expansion near two spatial dimension, with $\\epsilon=d-2$ may not be\nreliable to address the critical properties of disorder driven Dirac\nsemimetal-metal quantum phase transition in $d=3$.\n", "  Some reddened quasars appear to be transitional objects in the merger-induced\nblack hole growth/galaxy evolution paradigm, where a heavily obscured nucleus\nstarts to be unveiled by powerful quasar winds evacuating the surrounding\ncocoon of dust and gas. Hard X-ray observations are able to peer through this\ngas and dust, revealing the properties of circumnuclear obscuration. Here, we\npresent NuSTAR and XMM-Newton/Chandra observations of FIRST-2MASS selected red\nquasars F2M 0830+3759 and F2M 1227+3214. We find that though F2M 0830+3759 is\nmoderately obscured ($N_{\\rm H,Z} = 2.1\\pm0.2 \\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) and F2M\n1227+3214 is mildly absorbed ($N_{\\rm H,Z} = 3.4^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\\times10^{21}$\ncm$^{-2}$) along the line-of-sight, heavier global obscuration may be present\nin both sources, with $N_{\\rm H,S} = 3.7^{+4.1}_{-2.6} \\times 10^{23}$\ncm$^{-2}$ and $< 5.5\\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, for F2M 0830+3759 and F2M\n1227+3214, respectively. F2M 0830+3759 also has an excess of soft X-ray\nemission below 1 keV which is well accommodated by a model where 7% of the\nintrinsic AGN X-ray emission is scattered into the line-of-sight. While F2M\n1227+3214 has a dust-to-gas ratio ($E(B-V)$/$N_{\\rm H}$) consistent with the\nGalactic value, the $E(B-V)$/$N_{\\rm H}$ value for F2M 0830+3759 is lower than\nthe Galactic standard, consistent with the paradigm that the dust resides on\ngalactic scales while the X-ray reprocessing gas originates within the\ndust-sublimation zone of the broad-line-region. The X-ray and 6.1$\\mu$m\nluminosities of these red quasars are consistent with the empirical relations\nderived for high-luminosity, unobscured quasars, extending the parameter space\nof obscured AGN previously observed by NuSTAR to higher luminosities.\n", "  We show theoretically that, in the limit of weak dispersion, one-dimensional\n(1D) binary centrosymmetric photonic crystals can support topological edge\nmodes in all photonic band gaps. By analyzing their bulk band topology, these\n\"harmonic\" topological edge modes can be designed in a way that they exist at\nall photonic band gaps opened at the center of the Brillouin Zone, or at all\ngaps opened at the zone boundaries, or both. The results may suggest a new\napproach to achieve robust multi-frequency coupled modes for applications in\nnonlinear photonics, such as frequency up-conversion.\n", "  Cosmological observations indicate that most of the matter in the Universe is\nDark Matter. Dark Matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles\n(WIMPs) can be detected directly, via its elastic scattering off target nuclei.\nMost current direct detection experiments only measure the energy of the\nrecoiling nuclei. However, directional detection experiments are sensitive to\nthe direction of the nuclear recoil as well. Due to the Sun's motion with\nrespect to the Galactic rest frame, the directional recoil rate has a dipole\nfeature, peaking around the direction of the Solar motion. This provides a\npowerful tool for demonstrating the Galactic origin of nuclear recoils and\nhence unambiguously detecting Dark Matter. Furthermore, the directional recoil\ndistribution depends on the WIMP mass, scattering cross section and local\nvelocity distribution. Therefore, with a large number of recoil events it will\nbe possible to study the physics of Dark Matter in terms of particle and\nastrophysical properties. We review the potential of directional detectors for\ndetecting and characterizing WIMPs.\n", "  Following a major upgrade, the two advanced detectors of the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) held their first\nobservation run between September 2015 and January 2016. With a strain\nsensitivity of $10^{-23}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 100 Hz, the product of\nobservable volume and measurement time exceeded that of all previous runs\nwithin the first 16 days of coincident observation. On September 14th, 2015 the\nAdvanced LIGO detectors observed a transient gravitational-wave signal\ndetermined to be the coalescence of two black holes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,\n061102 (2016)], launching the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. The event,\nGW150914, was observed with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 24 in\ncoincidence by the two detectors. Here we present the main features of the\ndetectors that enabled this observation. At full sensitivity, the Advanced LIGO\ndetectors are designed to deliver another factor of three improvement in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for binary black hole systems similar in masses to\nGW150914.\n", "  The LIGO detection of the gravitational wave transient GW150914, from the\ninspiral and merger of two black holes with masses $\\gtrsim 30\\,\n\\text{M}_\\odot$, suggests a population of binary black holes with relatively\nhigh mass. This observation implies that the stochastic gravitational-wave\nbackground from binary black holes, created from the incoherent superposition\nof all the merging binaries in the Universe, could be higher than previously\nexpected. Using the properties of GW150914, we estimate the energy density of\nsuch a background from binary black holes. In the most sensitive part of the\nAdvanced LIGO/Virgo band for stochastic backgrounds (near 25 Hz), we predict\n$\\Omega_\\text{GW}(f=25 Hz) = 1.1_{-0.9}^{+2.7} \\times 10^{-9}$ with 90\\%\nconfidence. This prediction is robustly demonstrated for a variety of formation\nscenarios with different parameters. The differences between models are small\ncompared to the statistical uncertainty arising from the currently poorly\nconstrained local coalescence rate. We conclude that this background is\npotentially measurable by the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors operating at their\nprojected final sensitivity.\n", "  The search for new ferroelectric (FE) materials holds promise for broadening\nour understanding of FE mechanisms and extending the range of application of FE\nmaterials. Here we investigate a class of ABO3 and A2BB'O6 materials that can\nbe derived from the X2O3 corundum structure by mixing two or three ordered\ncations on the X site. Most such corundum derivatives have a polar structure,\nbut it is unclear whether the polarization is reversible, which is a\nrequirement for a FE material. In this paper, we propose a method to study the\nFE reversal path of materials in the corundum derivative family. We first\ncategorize the corundum derivatives into four classes and show that only two of\nthese allow for the possibility of FE reversal. We then calculate the energy\nprofile and energy barrier of the FE reversal path using first-principles\ndensity functional methods with a structural constraint. Furthermore, we\nidentify several empirical measures that can provide a rule of thumb for\nestimating the energy barriers. Finally, the conditions under which the\nmagnetic ordering is compatible with ferroelectricity are determined. These\nresults lead us to predict several potentially new FE materials.\n", "  We study a model for quantum lightcone fluctuations in which vacuum\nfluctuations of the electric field and of the squared electric field in a\nnonlinear dielectric material produce variations in the flight times of probe\npulses. When this material has a non-zero third order polarizability, the\nflight time variations arise from squared electric field fluctuations, and are\nanalogous to effects expected when the stress tensor of a quantized field\ndrives passive spacetime geometry fluctuations. We also discuss the dependence\nof the squared electric field fluctuations upon the geometry of the material,\nwhich in turn determines a sampling function for averaging the squared electric\nfield along the path of the pulse. This allows us to estimate the probability\nof especially large fluctuations, which is a measure of the probability\ndistribution for quantum stress tensor fluctuations.\n", "  The dynamics of complex networks, being a current hot topic of many\nscientific fields, is often coded through the corresponding Laplacian matrix.\nThe spectrum of this matrix carries the main features of the networks'\ndynamics. Here we consider the deterministic networks which can be viewed as\n\"comb-of-comb\" iterative structures. For their Laplacian spectra we find\nanalytical equations involving Chebyshev polynomials, whose properties allow\none to analyze the spectra in deep. Here, in particular, we find that in the\ninfinite size limit the corresponding spectral dimension goes as\n$d_s\\rightarrow2$. The $d_s$ leaves its fingerprint in many dynamical\nprocesses, as we exeplarily show by considering the dynamical properties of the\npolymer networks, including single monomer displacement under a constant force,\nmechanical relaxation, and fluorescence depolarization.\n", "  Ultra-relativistic motion and efficient conversion of kinetic energy to\nradiation are required by gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations, yet they are\ndifficult to simultaneously achieve. Three leading mechanisms have been\nproposed to explain the observed emission emanating from GRB outflows:\nradiation from either relativistic internal or external shocks, or thermal\nemission from a photosphere. Previous works were dedicated to independently\ntreating these three mechanisms and arguing for a sole, unique origin of the\nprompt emission of gamma-ray bursts. In contrast, herein, we first explain why\nall three models are valid mechanisms and that a contribution from each of them\nis expected in the prompt phase. Additionally, we show that a single parameter,\nthe dimensionless entropy of the GRB outflow, determines which mechanism\ncontributes the most to the emission. More specifically, internal shocks\ndominate for low values of the dimensionless entropy, external shocks for\nintermediate values and finally, photospheric emission for large values. We\npresent a unified framework for the emission mechanisms of GRBs with easily\ntestable predictions for each process.\n", "  We present new radial velocity measurements of eight stars secured with the\nspectrograph SOPHIE at the 193-cm telescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory\nallowing the detection and characterization of new giant extrasolar planets.\nThe host stars are dwarfs of spectral types between F5 and K0 and magnitudes\nbetween 6.7 and 9.6; the planets have minimum masses M_p sin i between 0.4 to\n3.8 M_Jup and orbital periods of several days to several months. The data allow\nonly single planets to be discovered around the first six stars (HD143105,\nHIP109600, HD35759, HIP109384, HD220842, and HD12484), but one of them shows\nthe signature of an additional substellar companion in the system. The seventh\nstar, HIP65407, allows the discovery of two giant planets, just outside the\n12:5 resonance in weak mutual interaction. The last star, HD141399, was already\nknown to host a four-planetary system; our additional data and analyses allow\nnew constraints to be put on it. We present Keplerian orbits of all systems,\ntogether with dynamical analyses of the two multi-planetary systems. HD143105\nis one of the brightest stars known to host a hot Jupiter, which could allow\nnumerous follow-up studies to be conducted despite this is not a transiting\nsystem. The giant planets HIP109600b, HIP109384b, and HD141399c are located in\nthe habitable zone of their host star.\n", "  We present a large dataset of high cadence dMe flare light curves obtained\nwith custom continuum filters on the triple-beam, high-speed camera system\nULTRACAM. The measurements provide constraints for models of the NUV and\noptical continuum spectral evolution on timescales of ~1 second. We provide a\nrobust interpretation of the flare emission in the ULTRACAM filters using\nsimultaneously-obtained low-resolution spectra during two moderate-sized flares\nin the dM4.5e star YZ CMi. By avoiding the spectral complexity within the\nbroadband Johnson filters, the ULTRACAM filters are shown to characterize\nbona-fide continuum emission in the NUV, blue, and red wavelength regimes. The\nNUV/blue flux ratio in flares is equivalent to a Balmer jump ratio, and the\nblue/red flux ratio provides an estimate for the color temperature of the\noptical continuum emission. We present a new \"color-color\" relationship for\nthese continuum flux ratios at the peaks of the flares. Using the RADYN and RH\ncodes, we interpret the ULTRACAM filter emission using the dominant emission\nprocesses from a radiative-hydrodynamic flare model with a high nonthermal\nelectron beam flux, which explains a hot, T~10,000 K, color temperature at\nblue-to-red optical wavelengths and a small Balmer jump ratio as are observed\nin moderate-sized and large flares alike. We also discuss the high\ntime-resolution, high signal-to-noise continuum color variations observed in YZ\nCMi during a giant flare, which increased the NUV flux from this star by over a\nfactor of 100.\n", "  We calculate the inclusive gluon correlation function for arbitrary number of\ngluons with full rapidity and transverse momentum dependence for the initial\nglasma state of the p-p, p-A and A-A collisions. The formula we derive via\nsuperdiagrams generates cumulants for any number of gluons. Higher order\ncumulants contain information on correlations between multiple gluons, and they\nare necessary for calculations of higher dimensional ridges as well as flow\ncoefficients from multi-particle correlations.\n", "  The impact of variable Ti self-doping on the 1T-TiSe2 charge density wave\n(CDW) is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. Supported by density\nfunctional theory we show that agglomeration of intercalated-Ti atoms acts as\npreferential nucleation centers for the CDW that breaks up in phaseshifted CDW\ndomains whose size directly depends on the intercalated-Ti concentration and\nwhich are separated by atomically-sharp phase boundaries. The close\nrelationship between the diminution of the CDW domain size and the\ndisappearance of the anomalous peak in the temperature dependent resistivity\nallows to draw a coherent picture of the 1T-TiSe2 CDW phase transition and its\nrelation to excitons.\n", "  Context. The mass-loss mechanism of cool massive evolved stars is poorly\nunderstood. The proximity of Betelgeuse makes it an appealing target to study\nits atmosphere, map the shape of its envelope, and follow the structure of its\nwind from the photosphere out to the interstellar medium. Aims. A link is\nsuspected between the powerful convective motions in Betelgeuse and its mass\nloss. We aim to constrain the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the\nconvective pattern on the photosphere and to search for evidence of this link.\nMethods. We report new interferometric observations in the infrared H band\nusing the VLTI/PIONIER instrument. We monitored the photosphere of Betelgeuse\nbetween 2012 January and 2014 November to look for evolutions that may trigger\nthe outflow. Results. Our interferometric observations at low spatial\nfrequencies are compatible with the presence of a hot spot on the photosphere\nthat has a characteristic width of one stellar radius. It appears to be\nsuperposed on the smaller scale convective pattern. In the higher spatial\nfrequency domain, we observe a significant difference between the observations\nand the predictions of 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Conclusions. We bring new\nevidence for the presence of a convective pattern in the photosphere of red\nsupergiants. The inferred hot spot is probably the top of a giant convection\ncell although an asymmetric extension of the star cannot be excluded by these\ninterferometric observations alone. The properties of the observed surface\nfeatures show a stronger contrast and inhomogeneity as predicted by 3D\nradiative hydrodynamical simulations. We propose that the large observed\nfeature is modifying the signature of the convective pattern at the surface of\nthe star in a way that simulations cannot reproduce.\n", "  In anticipation of new observational results for Jupiter's axial moment of\ninertia and gravitational zonal harmonic coefficients from the forthcoming Juno\norbiter, we present a number of preliminary Jupiter interior models. We combine\nresults from ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures,\nincluding immiscibility calculations, with a new nonperturbative calculation of\nJupiter's zonal harmonic coefficients, to derive a self-consistent model for\nthe planet's external gravity and moment of inertia. We assume helium rain\nmodified the interior temperature and composition profiles. Our calculation\npredicts zonal harmonic values to which measurements can be compared. Although\nsome models fit the observed (pre-Juno) second- and fourth-order zonal\nharmonics to within their error bars, our preferred reference model predicts a\nfourth-order zonal harmonic whose absolute value lies above the pre-Juno error\nbars. This model has a dense core of about 12 Earth masses, and a\nhydrogen-helium-rich envelope with approximately 3 times solar metallicity.\n", "  The question how the outer solar atmosphere is heated from solar photospheric\ntemperatures of about 5800K up to solar chromospheric and coronal temperatures\nof about 20.000K and millions of degrees respectively, remained without any\nsatisfying answer for centuries. On 4 May 2005, I recorded several time series\nof Halpha line scans with the GREGOR Fabry-Perot Interferometer, still deployed\nat the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), for different solar limb and\non-disk positions as well as for quiet sun at solar disk center. The spatially\nand temporally highly resolved time series of Halpha line parameters reveal the\nentire and detailed complexity as well as the overwhelming dynamics of spicules\ncovering the entire solar disk, thus apparently confirming spicules as the\npotential driver of chromospheric heating for both the Sun and sun-like stars,\nwith an expected mass flux larger than 100 times that of the solar wind.\nSpicules seem to be the result of the interaction of the highly dynamic\nphotospheric quiet-sun or active-region small-scale magnetic field, which is\ndominated by convective processes and is predominantly located in intergranular\nlanes and at meso- or supergranular scales.\n", "  Massive stars form on different scales ranging from large, dispersed OB\nassociations to compact, dense starburst clusters. The complex structure of\nregions of massive star formation, and the involved short timescales provide a\nchallenge for our understanding of their birth and early evolution. As one of\nthe most massive and luminous star-forming region in our Galaxy, W49 is the\nideal place to study the formation of the most massive stars. By classifying\nthe massive young stars deeply embedded into the molecular cloud of W49, we aim\nto investigate and trace the star formation history of this region. We analyse\nnear-infrared $K$-band spectroscopic observations of W49 from LBT/LUCI combined\nwith $JHK$ images obtained with NTT/SOFI and LBT/LUCI. Based on $JHK$-band\nphotometry and K-band spectroscopy the massive stars are placed in a\nHertzsprung Russell diagram. By comparison with evolutionary models, their age\nand hence the star formation history of W49 can be investigated. Fourteen O\ntype stars as well as two young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified by our\nspectroscopic survey. Eleven O-stars are main sequence stars with subtypes\nranging from O3 to O9.5, with masses ranging from $\\sim 20$ $M_{\\odot}$ to\n$\\sim 120$ $M_{\\odot}$. Three of the O-stars show strong wind features, and are\nconsidered to be Of-type supergiants with masses beyond 100 $M_{\\odot}$ . The\ntwo YSOs show CO emission, indicative for the presence of circumstellar disks\nin the central region of the massive cluster. The age of the cluster is\nestimated as $\\sim1.5$ Myr, with star formation still ongoing in different\nparts of the region. The ionising photons from the central massive stars have\nnot yet cleared the molecular cocoon surrounding the cluster. W49 is comparable\nto extragalactic star-forming regions and provides us with an unique\npossibility to study a starburst in detail.\n", "  Oxygen abundances of 34 B-type stars in the effective temperature range of\nTeff~10000-28000K with diversified rotational velocities (vesini~ 0-250km/s)\nwere determined from the OI triplet lines at 7771-5A, with an aim to examine\nwhether this OI feature can be a reliable abundance indicator for such\nhigh-temperature stars including rapid rotators. It revealed that the required\nnon-LTE abundance correction is distinctly large (ranging from ~-0.6dex to\n~-1.7dex) and its consideration is indispensable. On the condition that the\nnon-LTE effect is taken into account, this triplet is a useful O abundance\nindicator (with a precision of <~0.2dex) up to Teff <~25000K, since its total\nequivalent width is sufficiently large (>~200mA). In contrast, it is not\nadequate for abundance derivation for stars at Teff >~25000K, where its\nstrength rapidly drops down toward a hardly detectable level (except for\nsharp-lined stars) and its sensitivity to Teff or log g becomes considerably\nlarge. The resulting non-LTE oxygen abundances turned out to be almost normal\n(i.e., near-solar around ~8.7-8.8 within +/-~0.2dex) for most stars without any\ndependence upon projected rotational velocity as well as luminosity (or mass),\nwhich is consistent with the prediction of recent stellar evolution\ncalculations.\n", "  We study the critical points of Coulomb energy considered as a function on\nconfiguration spaces associated with certain geometric constraints. Two\nsettings of such kind are discussed in some detail. The first setting arises by\nconsidering polygons of fixed perimeter with freely sliding positively charged\nvertices. The second one is concerned with triples of positive charges\nconstrained to three concentric circles. In each of these cases the Coulomb\nenergy is generically a Morse function. We describe the minima and other\nstationary points of Coulomb energy and show that, for three charges, a\npitchfork bifurcation takes place accompanied by an effect of the Euler's\nBuckling Beam type.\n", "  We present an extensive survey for rapid pulsators among Extreme Horizontal\nBranch (EHB) stars in omega Cen. The observations performed consist of nearly\n100 hours of time-series photometry, as well as low-resolution spectroscopy. We\nobtained photometry for some 300 EHB stars. Based on the spectroscopy, we\nderive reliable values of log g, Teff and log(N(He)/N(H)) for 38 targets, as\nwell as estimates of the effective temperature for another nine targets. The\nsurvey uncovered a total of five rapid variables with multi-periodic\noscillations between 85 and 125 s. Spectroscopically, they form a homogeneous\ngroup of hydrogen-rich subdwarf O stars clustered between 48,000 and 54,000 K.\nFor each of the variables we are able to measure between two and three\nsignificant pulsations believed to constitute independent harmonic\noscillations. In addition to the rapid variables, we found an EHB star with an\napparently periodic luminosity variation of ~2700 s, which we tentatively\nsuggest may be caused by ellipsoidal variations in a close binary. Using the\noverlapping photometry and spectroscopy sample we are able to map an empirical\nomega Cen instability strip. This can be directly compared to the pulsation\ndriving predicted from the Montreal \"second-generation\" models. We find that\nthe region where p-mode excitation occurs is bifurcated, and the well-known\ninstability strip between 29,000-36,000 K where the rapid subdwarf B pulsators\nare found is complemented by a second one above 50,000 K. While significant\nchallenges remain at the quantitative level, we believe that the same\nkappa-mechanism that drives the pulsations in hot B subdwarfs is also\nresponsible for the excitation of the rapid oscillations observed in the omega\nCen variables.\n", "  In this letter we explore how recurrence quantifier, the determinism\n($\\Delta$), can reveal stationarity breaking and coupling between physical\nsystems. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect small variations in a\ndynamical system based only on temporal signal displayed by another system\ncoupled to it. To introduce basic ideas, we consider a well known dynamical\nsystem composed of two master-slave coupled Lorenz oscillators. We start\nevidencing that due to the sensitivity of $\\Delta$ computed from temporal time\nseries of slave oscillator, its is possible to detect the stationary breaking\nimposed in the master oscillator. As a second example, the method is carried\nout in a real physiological data acquired from accelerometer sensors\n($\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$) and used to detect micro arousal phenomenology (described\nby a sharp burst in $\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ signal) during sleep periods in mice.\nMoreover, we show for the first time that making use of recurrence quantifier\nit is possible to infer a coupling between electric signals from hippocampus\nand \"locomotor brain areas\" of mice, based only on non invasive data from\n$\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$. Our results suggest new possibilities of analysis of coupled\nsystems making use of accessible time series. Our second example supports an\ninterpretation of an internal coupling detectable as a stationarity breaking in\n$\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ that occurs some seconds before micro arousal processes\nduring sleep periods in rodents, contributing to the idea that micro arousals\nare elements of sleep taking part in the regulation of sleep process. Such a\ncharacterization of micro arousals can improve our knowledge about sleep\nfostering tools of sleep diagnose and pharmacology research for mammals in\ngeneral.\n", "  The Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime observing\ntarget for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which can resolve the 1.3 mm\nemission from this source on angular scales comparable to that of the general\nrelativistic shadow. Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes\nto infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much\nricher source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase\ninformation on Sgr A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights\nover 4 years. Closure phases, the sum of visibility phases along a closed\ntriangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against\nphase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable\natmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in\nCalifornia, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero. This result conclusively\ndemonstrates that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few\nSchwarzschild radii and can be used to break 180-degree rotational ambiguities\ninherent from amplitude data alone. The stability of the sign of the closure\nphase over most observing nights indicates persistent asymmetry in the image of\nSgr A* that is not obscured by refraction due to interstellar electrons along\nthe line of sight.\n", "  We describe the difficulties that advanced undergraduate and graduate\nstudents have with quantum measurement within the standard interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. We explore the possible origins of these difficulties by\nanalyzing student responses to questions from both surveys and interviews.\nResults from this research are applied to develop research-based learning\ntutorials to improve students' understanding of quantum measurement.\n", "  We show that an integrable four-dimensional non-unitary field theory that was\nrecently proposed as a certain limit of the $\\gamma_i$-deformed $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSYM theory is incomplete and not conformal -- not even in the planar limit. We\ncomplete this theory by double-trace couplings and find conformal one-loop\nfix-points when admitting respective complex coupling constants. These\ncouplings must not be neglected in the planar limit, as they can contribute to\nplanar multi-point functions. Based on our results for certain two-loop planar\nanomalous dimensions, we propose tests of integrability.\n", "  Using the Wide Field Camera for the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, we\nmeasure the near-infrared colors of near-Earth objects (NEOs) in order to put\nconstraints on their taxonomic classifications. The rapid-response character of\nour observations allows us to observe NEOs when they are close to the Earth and\nbright. Here we present near-infrared color measurements of 86 NEOs, most of\nwhich were observed within a few days of their discovery, allowing us to\ncharacterize NEOs with diameters of only a few meters. Using machine-learning\nmethods, we compare our measurements to existing asteroid spectral data and\nprovide probabilistic taxonomic classifications for our targets. Our\nobservations allow us to distinguish between S-complex, C/X-complex, D-type,\nand V-type asteroids. Our results suggest that the fraction of S-complex\nasteroids in the whole NEO population is lower than the fraction of ordinary\nchondrites in the meteorite fall statistics. Future data obtained with UKIRT\nwill be used to investigate the significance of this discrepancy.\n", "  We report on the MASTER Global Robotic Net discovery of an eclipsing binary,\nMASTER OT J095310.04+335352.8, previously known as unremarkable star TYC\n2505-672-1, which displays extreme orbital parameters. The orbital period\nP=69.1 yr is more than 2.5 times longer than that of epsilon-Aurigae, which is\nthe previous record holder. The light curve is characterized by an extremely\ndeep total eclipse with a depth of more than 4.5 mag, which is symmetrically\nshaped and has a total duration of 3.5 yrs. The eclipse is essentially gray.\nThe spectra acquired with the Russian 6 m BTA telescope both at minimum and\nmaximum light mainly correspond to an M0-1III--type red giant, but the spectra\ntaken at the bottom of eclipse show small traces of a sufficiently hot source.\nThe observed properties of this system can be better explained as the red giant\neclipsed by a large cloud (the disk) of small particles surrounding the\ninvisible secondary companion.\n", "  We study theoretically the mode conversion and the associated resonant\nabsorption of p-polarized electromagnetic waves into longitudinal plasma\noscillations in cold, unmagnetized and stratified plasmas with periodic spatial\ndensity variations. We consider sinusoidal density configurations for which the\nfrequency band where mode conversion occurs is well included within a\ntransmission band of the one-dimensional plasma photonic crystal. We calculate\nthe mode conversion coefficient, which measures the fraction of the\nelectromagnetic wave energy absorbed into the plasma, and the spatial\ndistribution of the magnetic field intensity for various values of the wave\nfrequency and the incident angle using the invariant imbedding theory of mode\nconversion. We find that the absorption is greatly enhanced over a wide range\nof frequency and incident angle due to the interplay between the mode\nconversion and the photonic band structure. The enhancement occurs because for\nfrequencies within a transmission band, the wave reflection is strongly\nsuppressed and the waves penetrate more deeply into the inhomogeneous region,\nthereby increasing the possibility for them to reach many resonance points\nwhere the dielectric permittivity vanishes.\n", "  We describe the difficulties advanced undergraduate and graduate students\nhave with concepts related to addition of angular momentum in quantum\nmechanics. We also describe the development and implementation of a\nresearch-based learning tool, a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT),\nto reduce these difficulties. The preliminary evaluation shows that the QuILT\nrelated to the basics of the addition of angular momentum is helpful in\nimproving students' understanding of these concepts.\n", "  The interaction between two different materials can present novel phenomena\nthat are quite different from the physical properties observed when each\nmaterial stands alone. Strong electronic correlations, such as magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, can be produced as the result of enhanced Coulomb\ninteractions between electrons. Two-dimensional materials are powerful\ncandidates to search for the novel phenomena because of the easiness of\narranging them and modifying their properties accordingly. In this work, we\nreport magnetic effects of graphene, a prototypical non-magnetic\ntwo-dimensional semi-metal, in the proximity with sulfur, a diamagnetic\ninsulator. In contrast to the well-defined metallic behaviour of clean\ngraphene, an energy gap develops at the Fermi energy for the graphene/sulfur\ncompound with decreasing temperature. This is accompanied by a steep increase\nof the resistance, a sign change of the slope in the magneto-resistance between\nhigh and low fields, and magnetic hysteresis. A possible origin of the observed\nelectronic and magnetic responses is discussed in terms of the onset of\nlow-temperature magnetic ordering. These results provide intriguing insights on\nthe search for novel quantum phases in graphene-based compounds.\n", "  Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are massive stars that have lost most or all of their\nhydrogen via powerful stellar winds. Recent observations have indicated that\nhydrogen-free WR stars have cooler temperatures than those predicted by current\nevolutionary models. To investigate how varying mass-loss rate affects WR\nevolution, we have created a grid of pure helium star models. We compare our\nresults with Galactic and LMC WR observations and show that the temperature\nranges of observed WR stars can be reproduced by varying the mass-loss rate,\nwhich effectively determines the size of the helium envelope around the core.\nWe also find that WN and WO stars arise from more massive stars, whereas WC\nstars come from lower masses. This contradicts the standard Conti scenario by\nwhich WN and WC stars evolve in an age sequence. We also predict the magnitudes\nof our models at core-collapse and compare with observations of nearby\nprogenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. We confirm the findings of previous\nstudies that suggest WR stars are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae:\nthe progenitors would remain unobserved except in the cases where the\nprogenitor is a low-mass helium giant, as is the case of iPTF13bvn.\n", "  We study the decays of the charmonium resonances $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(3686)$ to\nthe final states $\\Xi^{-}\\bar\\Xi^{+}$,\n$\\Sigma(1385)^{\\mp}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{\\pm}$ based on a single baryon tag method\nusing data samples of $(223.7 \\pm 1.4) \\times 10^{6}$ $J/\\psi$ and $(106.4 \\pm\n0.9) \\times 10^{6}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at\nthe BEPCII collider. The decay\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{\\mp}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{\\pm}$ is observed for\nthe first time, and the measurements of the other processes, including the\nbranching fractions and angular distributions, are in good agreement with and\nmuch more precise than the previously published results. Additionally, the\nratios\n$\\frac{{\\cal{B}}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Xi^{-}\\bar\\Xi^{+})}{{\\cal{B}}(J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\Xi^{-}\\bar\\Xi^{+})}$,\n$\\frac{{\\cal{B}}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{-}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{+})}{{\\cal{B}}(J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{-}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{+})}$\nand\n$\\frac{{\\cal{B}}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{+}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{-})}{{\\cal{B}}(J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{+}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{-})}$\nare determined.\n", "  Supergravity grand unified models (SUGRA GUTs) are highly motivated and allow\nfor a high degree of electroweak naturalness when the superpotential parameter\nmu~ 100-300 GeV (preferring values closer to 100 GeV). We first illustrate that\nmodels with radiatively-driven naturalness enjoy a generalized focus-point\nbehavior wherein all soft terms are correlated instead of just scalar masses.\nNext, we generate spectra from four SUGRA GUT archetypes: 1. SO(10) models\nwhere the Higgs doublets live in different 10-dimensional irreducible\nrepresentations (irreps), 2. models based on SO(10) where the Higgs multiplets\nlive in a single 10-dimensional irrep but with D-term scalar mass splitting, 3.\nmodels based on SU(5) and 4. a more general SUGRA model with 12 independent\nparameters. Electroweak naturalness implies for all models a spectrum of light\nhiggsinos with m(higgsinos)< 300 GeV and gluinos with m(gluino)< 2-4 TeV.\nHowever, masses and mixing in the third generation sfermion sector differ\ndistinctly between the models. These latter differences would be most easily\ntested at a linear e^+e^- collider with \\sqrt{s}~ multi-TeV-scale but\nmeasurements at a 50-100 TeV hadron collider are also possible.\n", "  Flares and eruptions from solar active regions are associated with\natmospheric electrical currents accompanying distortions of the coronal field\naway from a lowest-energy potential state. In order to better understand the\norigin of these currents and their role in M- and X-class flares, I review all\nactive-region observations made with SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA from 2010/05 through\n2014/10 within approximately 40 degrees from disk center. I select the roughly\n4% of all regions that display a distinctly nonpotential coronal configuration\nin loops with a length comparable to the scale of the active region, and all\nthat emit GOES X-class flares. The data for 41 regions confirm, with a single\nexception, that strong-field, high-gradient polarity inversion lines (SHILs)\ncreated during emergence of magnetic flux into, and related displacement\nwithin, pre-existing active regions are associated with X-class flares. Obvious\nnonpotentiality in the active region-scale loops occurs in 6 of 10 selected\nregions with X-class flares, all with relatively long SHILs along their primary\npolarity inversion line, or with a long internal filament there.\nNonpotentiality can exist in active regions well past the flux-emergence phase,\noften with reduced or absent flaring. I conclude that the dynamics of the flux\ninvolved in the compact SHILs is of preeminent importance for the large-flare\npotential of active regions within the next day, but that their associated\ncurrents may not reveal themselves in active region-scale nonpotentiality. In\ncontrast, active region-scale nonpotentiality, which can persist for many days,\nmay inform us about the eruption potential other than those from SHILs which is\nalmost never associated with X-class flaring.\n", "  In the present work, we study morphologies arising due to competing substrate\ninteraction, electric field and confinement effects on a symmetric diblock\ncopolymer. We employ a coarse grained non-local Cahn-Hilliard phenomenological\nmodel taking into account the appropriate contributions of substrate\ninteraction and electrostatic field. The proposed model couples the\nOhta-Kawasaki functional with Maxwell equation of electrostatics, thus\nalleviating the need for any approximate solution used in previous studies. We\ncalculate the phase diagram in electric field-substrate strength space for\ndifferent film thicknesses. In addition to identifying the presence of\nparallel, perpendicular and mixed lamellae phases similar to analytical\ncalculations, we also find a region in the phase diagram where hybrid\nmorphologies (combination of two phases) coexist. These hybrid morphologies\narise either solely due to substrate affinity and confinement or are induced\ndue to the applied electric field. The dependence of the critical fields for\ntransition between the various phases on substrate strength, film thickness and\ndielectric contrast is discussed. Some preliminary 3D results are also\npresented to corroborate the presence of hybrid morphologies.\n", "  Detections of C60 and C70 fullerenes in planetary nebulae (PNe) of the\nMagellanic Clouds and of our own Galaxy have raised the idea that other forms\nof carbon such as hydrogenated fullerenes (fulleranes like C60H36 and C60H18),\nbuckyonions, and carbon nanotubes, may be widespread in the Universe. Here we\npresent VLT/ISAAC spectra (R ~600) in the 2.9-4.1 microns spectral region for\nthe Galactic PNe Tc 1 and M 1-20, which have been used to search for\nfullerene-based molecules in their fullerene-rich circumstellar environments.\nWe report the non-detection of the most intense infrared bands of several\nfulleranes around ~3.4-3.6 microns in both PNe. We conclude that if fulleranes\nare present in the fullerene-containing circumstellar environments of these\nPNe, then they seem to be by far less abundant than C60 and C70. Our\nnon-detections together with the (tentative) fulleranes detection in the\nproto-PN IRAS 01005+7910 suggest that fulleranes may be formed in the short\ntransition phase between AGB stars and PNe but they are quickly destroyed by\nthe UV radiation field from the central star.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts have recently been used to place limits on Einstein's\nEquivalence Principle via observations of time delays between photons of\ndifferent radio frequencies by \\citet{wei15}. These limits on differential\npost-Newtonian parameters ($\\Delta \\gamma<2.52\\times10^{-8}$) are the best yet\nachieved but still rely on uncertain assumptions, namely the relative\ncontributions of dispersion and gravitational delays to the observed time\ndelays and the distances to FRBs. Also very recently, the first FRB host galaxy\nhas likely been identified, providing the first redshift-based distance\nestimate to FRB 150418 \\citep{kea16}. Moreover, consistency between the\n\\omegaigm\\ estimate from FRB 150418 and \\omegaigm~expected from $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels and WMAP observations leads one to conclude that the observed time delay\nfor FRB 150418 is highly dominated by dispersion, with any gravitational delays\nsmall contributors. This points to even tighter limits on $\\Delta \\gamma$. In\nthis paper, the technique of \\citet{wei15} is applied to FRB 150418 to produce\na limit of $\\Delta \\gamma < 1 - 2\\times10^{-9}$, approximately an order of\nmagnitude better than previous limits and in line with expectations by\n\\citet{wei15} for what could be achieved if the dispersive delay is separated\nfrom other effects. Future substantial improvements in such limits will depend\non accurately determining the contribution of individual ionized components to\nthe total observed time delays for FRBs.\n", "  Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observed both of Rhea's\npolar regions during two flybys on 2013/03/09 and 2015/02/10. The results show\nRhea's southern winter pole is one of the coldest places directly observed in\nour solar system: temperatures of 25.4+/-7.4 K and 24.7+/-6.8 K are inferred.\nThe surface temperature of the northern summer pole is warmer: 66.6+/-0.6 K.\nAssuming the surface thermophysical properties of both polar regions are\ncomparable then these temperatures can be considered a summer and winter\nseasonal temperature constraint for the polar region. These observations\nprovide solar longitude coverage at 133 deg and 313 deg for the summer and\nwinter poles respectively, with additional winter temperature constraint at 337\ndeg. Seasonal models with bolometric albedos of 0.70-0.74 and thermal inertias\nof 1-46 MKS can provide adequate fits to these temperature constraints. Both\nthese albedo and thermal inertia values agree (within error) with those\npreviously observed on both Rhea's leading and trailing hemispheres.\nInvestigating the seasonal temperature change of Rhea's surface is particularly\nimportant, as the seasonal wave is sensitive to deeper surface temperatures\n(~10cm to m) than the more commonly reported diurnal wave (<1cm). The low\nthermal inertia derived here implies that Rhea's polar surfaces are highly\nporous even at great depths. Analysis of a CIRS 10 to 600 cm-1 stare\nobservation, taken between 16:22:33 and 16:23:26 UT on 2013/03/09 centered on\n71.7 W, 58.7 S provides the first analysis of a thermal emissivity spectrum on\nRhea. The results show a flat emissivity spectrum with negligible emissivity\nfeatures. A few possible explanations exist for this flat emissivity spectrum,\nbut the most likely for Rhea is that the surface is both highly porous and\ncomposed of small particles (less than approximately 50 um).\n", "  In this article, we study the coherent pion production in neutrino-nucleus\ninteraction in the resonance region using the formalism based on partially\nconserved axial current (PCAC) theorem which relates the neutrino-nucleus cross\nsection to the pion-nucleus elastic cross section. The pion nucleus elastic\ncross section is calculated using the Glauber model in terms of pion-nucleon\ncross sections obtained by parameterizing the experimental data. We calculate\nthe differential and integrated cross sections for charged current coherent\npion production in neutrino carbon scattering. The results of integrated cross\nsection calculations are compared with the measured data. Predictions for the\ndifferential and integrated cross sections for coherent pion productions in\nneutrino iron scattering using above formalism are also made.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers such as MoSe2,MoS2 and WSe2 are\ndirect bandgap semiconductors with original optoelectronic and spin-valley\nproperties. Here we report spectrally sharp, spatially localized emission in\nmonolayer MoSe2. We find this quantum dot like emission in samples exfoliated\nonto gold substrates and also suspended flakes. Spatial mapping shows a\ncorrelation between the location of emitters and the existence of wrinkles\n(strained regions) in the flake. We tune the emission properties in magnetic\nand electric fields applied perpendicular to the monolayer plane. We extract an\nexciton g-factor of the discrete emitters close to -4, as for 2D excitons in\nthis material. In a charge tunable sample we record discrete jumps on the meV\nscale as charges are added to the emitter when changing the applied voltage.\nThe control of the emission properties of these quantum dot like emitters paves\nthe way for further engineering of the light matter interaction in these\natomically thin materials.\n", "  Methods. We used the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope to acquire\nhigh-resolution (R $\\approx$ 70000) spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio\n(S/N $\\approx$ 400 - 650 per pixel) of HIP 100963 and the Sun for a\ndifferential abundance analysis. We measured the equivalent widths (EWs) of\niron lines to determine the stellar parameters by employing the differential\nspectroscopic equilibrium. We determined the composition of volatile,\nrefractory, and neutron-capture elements through a differential abundance\nanalysis with respect to the Sun.\n  Results. The stellar parameters we found are $T_{\\rm{eff}}=5818 \\pm 4$ K, log\n$g = 4.49 \\pm 0.01$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.03 \\pm 0.01 $ $\\rm{km\\ {s}}^{-1}$ , and\n[Fe/H] $ = -\\ 0.003 \\pm 0.004$ dex. These low errors allow us to compute a\nprecise mass ($1.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and age (2.0 $\\pm$ 0.4 Gyr),\nobtained using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. Using our [Y/Mg] ratio, we have\ndetermined an age of $2.1 \\pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the age computed\nusing isochrones. Our isochronal age also agrees with the age determined from\nstellar activity (2.4 $\\pm$ 0.3 Gyr). We study the abundance pattern with\ncondensation temperature ($\\rm{T_{cond}}$) taking corrections by the GCE into\naccount. We show that the enhancements of neutron-capture elements are\nexplained by contributions from both the $s$- and $r$-process. The lithium\nabundance follows the tight Li-age correlation seen in other solar twins.\n  Conclusions. We confirm that HIP 100963 is a solar twin and demonstrate that\nits abundance pattern is about solar after corrections for GCE. The star also\nshows enrichment in $s-$ and $r$-process elements, as well as depletion in\nlithium that is caused by stellar evolution.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the odd-state part of bare $\\Lambda \\Lambda$\ninteractions on the structure of neutron stars (NSs) by constructing equations\nof state (EOSs) for uniform nuclear matter containing $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma^-$\nhyperons with use of the cluster variational method. The isoscalar part of the\nArgonne v18 two-nucleon potential and the Urbana IX three-nucleon potential are\nemployed as the interactions between nucleons, whereas, as the bare $\\Lambda N$\nand even-state $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ interactions, two-body central potentials that\nare determined so as to reproduce the experimental data on single- and\ndouble-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei are adopted. In addition, the $\\Sigma^- N$\ninteraction is constructed so as to reproduce the empirical single-particle\npotential of $\\Sigma^-$ in symmetric nuclear matter. Since the odd-state part\nof the $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ interaction is not known owing to lack of experimental\ndata, we construct four EOSs of hyperonic nuclear matter, each with a different\nodd-state part of the $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ interaction. The EOS obtained for NS\nmatter becomes stiffer as the odd-state $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ interaction becomes\nmore repulsive, and correspondingly the maximum mass of NSs increases. It is\ninteresting that the onset density of $\\Sigma^-$ depends strongly on the\nrepulsion of the odd-state $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ interaction. Furthermore, we take\ninto account the three-baryon repulsive force to obtain results that are\nconsistent with observational data on heavy NSs.\n", "  Relativistic Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation methods for open\nshells are used to calculate ionization potentials and static scalar\npolarizabilities of eight superheavy elements with open $6d$-shell, which\ninclude Db, Sg, Bh, Hs, Mt, Ds, Rg and Cn ($Z$=105 to 112). Inter-electron\ncorrelations are taken into account with the use of the semi-empirical\npolarization potential. Its parameters are chosen to fit the known ionization\npotentials of lighter atoms. Calculations for lighter atoms are also used to\nillustrate the accuracy of the approach.\n", "  Ground- and space-based planet searches employing radial velocity techniques\nand transit photometry have detected thousands of planet-hosting stars in the\nMilky Way. The chemistry of these atmospheres is controlled by the shape and\nabsolute flux of the stellar spectral energy distribution, however, flux\ndistributions of relatively inactive low-mass stars are poorly known at\npresent. To better understand exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars, we have\nexecuted a panchromatic (X-ray to mid-IR) study of the spectral energy\ndistributions of 11 nearby planet hosting stars, the {\\it Measurements of the\nUltraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems}\n(MUSCLES) Treasury Survey. The MUSCLES program consists of contemporaneous\nobservations at X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths. We show that energetic\nradiation (X-ray and ultraviolet) is present from magnetically active stellar\natmospheres at all times for stars as late as M5. Emission line luminosities of\n\\ion{C}{4} and \\ion{Mg}{2} are strongly correlated with band-integrated\nluminosities. We find that while the slope of the spectral energy distribution,\nFUV/NUV, increases by approximately two orders of magnitude form early K to\nlate M dwarfs ($\\approx$~0.01~to~1), the absolute FUV and XUV flux levels at\ntheir corresponding habitable zone distances are constant to within factors of\na few, spanning the range 10~--~70 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the habitable\nzone. Despite the lack of strong stellar activity indicators in their optical\nspectra, several of the M dwarfs in our sample show spectacular flare emission\nin their UV light curves. Finally, we interpret enhanced $L(line)$/$L_{Bol}$\nratios for \\ion{C}{4} and \\ion{N}{5} as tentative observational evidence for\nthe interaction of planets with large planetary mass-to-orbital distance ratios\n($M_{plan}$/$a_{plan}$) with the transition regions of their host stars.\n", "  Background: In the last few decades quantum phase transitions have been of\ngreat interest in Nuclear Physics. In this context, two-fluid algebraic models\nare ideal systems to study how the concept of quantum phase transition evolves\nwhen moving into more complex systems, but the number of publications along\nthis line has been scarce up to now.\n  Purpose: We intend to determine the phase diagram of a two-fluid Lipkin\nmodel, that resembles the nuclear proton-neutron interacting boson model\nHamiltonian, using both numerical results and analytic tools, i.e., catastrophe\ntheory, and to compare the mean-field results with exact diagonalizations for\nlarge systems. Method: The mean-field energy surface of a consistent-Q-like\ntwo-fluid Lipkin Hamiltonian is studied and compared with exact results coming\nfrom a direct diagonalization. The mean-field results are analyzed using the\nframework of catastrophe theory.\n  Results: The phase diagram of the model is obtained and the order of the\ndifferent phase-transition lines and surfaces is determined using a catastrophe\ntheory analysis.\n  Conclusions: There are two first order surfaces in the phase diagram, one\nseparating the spherical and the deformed shapes, while the other separates two\ndifferent deformed phases. A second order line, where the later surfaces merge,\nis found. This line finishes in a transition point with a divergence in the\nsecond order derivative of the energy that corresponds to a tricritical point\nin the language of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions.\n", "  X-rays are a powerful probe of activity in early stages of star formation.\nThey allow us to identify young stars even after they have lost the IR\nsignatures of circumstellar disks and provide constraints on their distance.\nHere we report on XMM-Newton observations which detect 121 young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) in two fields between L1641S and $\\kappa$ Ori. These\nobservations extend the Survey of Orion A with XMM and Spitzer (SOXS). The YSOs\nare contained in a ring of gas and dust apparent at millimeter wavelengths, and\nin far-IR and near-IR surveys. The X-ray luminosity function of the young\nstellar objects detected in the two fields indicates a distance of 250-280 pc,\nmuch closer than the Orion A cloud and similar to distance estimates of\n$\\kappa$ Ori. We propose that the ring is a 5-8 pc diameter shell that has been\nswept up by $\\kappa$ Ori. This ring contains several groups of stars detected\nby Spitzer and WISE including one surrounding the Herbig Ae/Be stars V1818 Ori.\nIn this interpretation, the $\\kappa$ Ori ring is one of several shells swept up\nby massive stars within the Orion Eridanus Superbubble, and is unrelated to the\nsouthern portion of Orion A / L1641 S.\n", "  We present complete analytical and numerical results that demonstrate the\nanomalous universal fluctuations of the spin-Hall conductance in chiral\nmaterials such as graphene and topological insulators. We investigated both the\ncorresponding fluctuations, the Universal Fractionated and the Universal\nQuantized, and also the open channels orbital number crossover between the two\nregimes. In particular, we show that the Wigner-Dyson symmetries does not\nproperly describe such conductances and the preponderant role of the chiral\nclasses on the Dirac quantum dots. The results are analytical and solve\noutstanding issues.\n", "  We introduce a new algorithm for colour separation and deblending of\nmulti-band astronomical images called MuSCADeT which is based on\nMorpho-spectral Component Analysis of multi-band images. The MuSCADeT algorithm\ntakes advantage of the sparsity of astronomical objects in morphological\ndictionaries such as wavelets and their differences in spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) across multi-band observations. This allows us to devise a\nmodel independent and automated approach to separate objects with different\ncolours. We show with simulations that we are able to separate highly blended\nobjects and that our algorithm is robust against SED variations of objects\nacross the field of view. To confront our algorithm with real data, we use HST\nimages of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS J1149+2223 and we show that\nMuSCADeT performs better than traditional profile-fitting techniques in\ndeblending the foreground lensing galaxies from background lensed galaxies.\nAlthough the main driver for our work is the deblending of strong gravitational\nlenses, our method is fit to be used for any purpose related to deblending of\nobjects in astronomical images. An example of such an application is the\nseparation of the red and blue stellar populations of a spiral galaxy in the\ngalaxy cluster Abell 2744. We provide a python package along with all\nsimulations and routines used in this paper to contribute to reproducible\nresearch efforts. Codes can be found at http://lastro.epfl.ch/page-126973.html.\n", "  It is still unknown how magnetic field-generation mechanisms could operate in\nlow-mass dwarf galaxies. Here, we present a detailed study of a nearby\npure-disk dwarf galaxy NGC 2976. Unlike previously observed dwarf objects, this\ngalaxy possesses a clearly defined disk. For the purpose of our studies, we\nperformed deep multi-frequency polarimetric observations of NGC 2976 with the\nVLA and Effelsberg radio telescopes. Additionally, we supplement them with\nre-imaged data from the WSRT-SINGS survey. The magnetic field morphology\ndiscovered in NGC 2976 consists of a southern polarized ridge. This structure\ndoes not seem to be due to just a pure large-scale dynamo process (possibly\ncosmic-ray driven) at work in this object, as indicated by the RM data and\ndynamo number calculations. Instead, the field of NGC 2976 is modified by past\ngravitational interactions and possibly also by ram pressure inside the M 81\ngalaxy group environment. The estimates of total (7 muG) and ordered (3 muG)\nmagnetic field strengths, as well as degree of field order (0.46), which is\nsimilar to those observed in spirals, suggest that tidally generated magnetized\ngas flows can further enhance dynamo action in the object. NGC 2976 is\napparently a good candidate for the efficient magnetization of its\nneighbourhood. It is able to provide an ordered (perhaps also regular) magnetic\nfield into the intergalactic space up to a distance of about 5 kpc. Tidal\ninteractions (and possibly also ram pressure) can lead to the formation of\nunusual magnetic field morphologies (like polarized ridges) in galaxies out of\nthe star-forming disks, which do not follow any observed component of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), as observed in NGC 2976. These galaxies are able to\nprovide ordered magnetic fields far out of their main disks.\n", "  We analyse photometry for 138 first overtone Cepheids from the Small\nMagellanic Cloud, in which Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) team\ndiscovered additional variability with period shorter than first overtone\nperiod, and period ratios in the (0.60, 0.65) range. In the Petersen diagram\nthese stars form three well separated sequences. The additional variability\ncannot correspond to other radial mode. This form of pulsation is still\npuzzling.\n  We find that amplitude of the additional variability is small, typically 2-4\nper cent of the first overtone amplitude, which corresponds to 2-5 mmag. In\nsome stars we find simultaneously two close periodicities corresponding to two\nsequences in the Petersen diagram. The most important finding is the detection\nof power excess at half the frequency of the additional variability (at\nsubharmonic) in 35 per cent of the analysed stars. Interestingly, power excess\nat subharmonic frequency is detected mostly for stars of the middle sequence in\nthe Petersen diagram (74 per cent), incidence rate is much lower for stars of\nthe top sequence (31 per cent), and phenomenon is not detected for stars of the\nbottom sequence. The amplitude and/or phase of the additional periodicities\nstrongly vary in time.\n  Similar form of pulsation is observed in first overtone RR Lyrae stars. Our\nresults indicate that the nature and cause of this form of pulsation is the\nsame in the two groups of classical pulsators; consequently, a common model\nexplaining this form of pulsation should be searched for. Our results favour\nthe theory of the excitation of non-radial modes of angular degrees 7, 8 and 9,\nproposed recently by Dziembowski.\n", "  A great variety of nonlinear dissipative systems are known to host structures\nhaving a correlation range much shorter than the size of the system. The\ndynamics of these Localized Structures (LSs) have been investigated so far in\nsituations featuring parity symmetry. In this letter we extend this analysis to\nsystems lacking of this property. We show that the LS drifting speed in a\nparameter varying landscape is not simply proportional to the parameter\ngradient, as found in parity preserving situations. The symmetry breaking\nimplies a new contribution to the velocity field which is a function of the\nparameter value, thus leading to a new paradigm for LSs manipulation. We\nillustrate this general concept by studying the trajectories of the LSs found\nin a passively mode-locked laser operated in the localization regime. Moreover,\nthe lack of parity affects significantly LSs interactions which are governed by\nasymmetrical repulsive forces.\n", "  Intrinsically explosive growth of a ballooning finger is demonstrated in\nnonlinear magnetohydrodynamic calculations of high-$\\beta$ disruptions in\ntokamaks. The explosive finger is formed by an ideally unstable n=1 mode,\ndominated by an m/n=2/1 component. The quadrupole geometry of the 2/1 perturbed\npressure field provides a generic mechanism for the formation of the initial\nballooning finger and its subsequent transition from exponential to explosive\ngrowth, without relying on secondary processes. The explosive ejection of the\nhot plasma from the core and stochastization of the magnetic field occur in\nAlfv\\'enic time scales, accounting for the extremely fast growth of the\nprecursor oscillations and the rapidity of the thermal quench in some\nhigh-$\\beta$ disruptions.\n", "  We have analyzed the HCO+ (1-0) data of the Class I-II protostar, HL Tau,\nobtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array long baseline\ncampaign. We generated the HCO+ image cube at an angular resolution of ~0.07\n(~10 AU), and performed azimuthal averaging on the image cube to enhance the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and measure the radial profile of the HCO+ integrated\nintensity. Two gaps at radii of ~28 AU and ~69 AU and a central cavity are\nidentified in the radial intensity profile. The inner HCO+ gap is coincident\nwith the millimeter continuum gap at a radius of 32 AU. The outer HCO+ gap is\nlocated at the millimeter continuum bright ring at a radius of 69 AU and\noverlaps with the two millimeter continuum gaps at radii of 64 AU and 74 AU. On\nthe contrary, the presence of the central cavity is likely due to the high\noptical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission and not the depletion of the HCO+\ngas. We derived the HCO+ column density profile from its intensity profile.\nFrom the column density profile, the full-width-half-maximum widths of the\ninner and outer HCO+ gaps are both estimated to be ~14 AU, and their depths are\nestimated to be ~2.4 and ~5.0. These results are consistent with the\nexpectation from the gaps opened by forming (sub-)Jovian mass planets, while\nplacing tight constraints on the theoretical models solely incorporating the\nvariation of dust properties and grain sizes.\n", "  Nonlocal gravity has been shown to provide a phenomenologically viable\ninfrared modification of GR. A natural question is whether the required\nnonlocality can emerge from perturbative quantum loop corrections due to light\nparticles. We show that this is not the case. For the value of the mass scale\nof the non-local models required by cosmology, the perturbative form factors\nobtained from the loop corrections, in the present cosmological epoch, are in\nthe regime where they are local. The mechanism behind the generation of the\nrequired nonlocality must be more complex, possibly related to strong infrared\neffects and non-perturbative mass generation for the conformal mode.\n", "  To clarify the magnetic properties of cluster-glass states in Sr1-xLaxRuO3\n(0.3 <= x <= 0.5), we report herein the results of muon spin relaxation (muSR)\nand neutron powder diffraction measurements. The muSR experiments showed that\nmagnetic clusters start developing well above the peak temperature T^* in the\nac susceptibility. The volume fraction of the magnetically ordered region\nincreases continuously with decreasing temperature, showing no anomaly at T^*,\nand reaches nearly 100% at the lowest temperature. The temperature variation of\nthe volume fraction is essentially independent of the La concentration in the x\nrange presently investigated, although the dc magnetization is significantly\nsuppressed with increasing x. Neutron powder diffraction experiments revealed\nthat the ground state for x = 0.3 is a long-range ferromagnetic ordered state.\nThese results indicate that, with decreasing temperature, cluster-glass states\nin Sr1-xLaxRuO3 gradually develop into long-range ferromagnetic ordered states\nwith decreasing temperature, and that the magnetic ordering process differs\nstrikingly from that expected for a conventional second-order ferromagnetic\ntransition.\n", "  Some O and B stars show unusually strong or weak lines of carbon and/or\nnitrogen. These objects are classified as OBN or OBC stars. It has recently\nbeen shown that nitrogen enrichment and carbon depletion are the most likely\nexplanations for the existence of the ON class. We investigate OC stars (all\nbeing supergiants) to check that surface abundances are responsible for the\nobserved anomalous line strengths. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of three\nOC supergiants using atmosphere models. A fourth star was previously studied by\nus. Our sample thus comprises all OC stars known to date in the Galaxy. We\ndetermine the stellar parameters and He, C, N, and O surface abundances. We\nshow that all stars have effective temperatures and surface gravities fully\nconsistent with morphologically normal O supergiants. However, OC stars show\nlittle, if any, nitrogen enrichment and carbon surface abundances consistent\nwith the initial composition. OC supergiants are thus barely chemically\nevolved, unlike morphologically normal O supergiants.\n", "  We investigate the minimum planet mass that produces observable signatures in\ninfrared scattered light and submm continuum images and demonstrate how these\nimages can be used to measure planet masses to within a factor of about two. To\nthis end we perform multi-fluid gas and dust simulations of discs containing\nlow mass planets, generating simulated observations at $1.65 \\mu$m, $10 \\mu$m\nand $850 \\mu$m. We show that the minimum planet mass that produces a detectable\nsignature is $\\sim 15 M_\\oplus$: this value is strongly dependent on disc\ntemperature and changes slightly with wavelength (favouring the submm). We also\nconfirm previous results that there is a minimum planet mass of $\\sim 20\nM_\\oplus$ that produces a pressure maximum in the disc: only planets above this\nthreshold mass generate a dust trap that can eventually create a hole in the\nsubmm dust. Below this mass, planets produce annular enhancements in dust\noutward of the planet and a reduction in the vicinity of the planet. These\nfeatures are in steady state and can be understood in terms of variations in\nthe dust radial velocity, imposed by the perturbed gas pressure radial profile,\nanalogous to a traffic jam. We also show how planet masses can be derived from\nstructure in scattered light and sub-mm images. We emphasise that simulations\nwith dust need to be run over thousands of planetary orbits so as to allow the\ngas profile to achieve a steady state and caution against the estimation of\nplanet masses using gas only simulations.\n", "  We present a search, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), for\nelectromagnetic counterparts to two candidate high energy neutrino events\ndetected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope in 2013 November and 2014 March.\nThese events were selected by ANTARES because they are consistent, within 0.4\ndegrees, with the locations of galaxies within 20 Mpc of Earth. Using MWA\narchival data at frequencies between 118 and 182 MHz, taken ~20 days prior to,\nat the same time as, and up to a year after the neutrino triggers, we look for\ntransient or strongly variable radio sources consistent with the neutrino\npositions. No such counterparts are detected, and we set a 5 sigma upper limit\nfor low-frequency radio emission of ~1E37 erg/s for progenitors at 20 Mpc. If\nthe neutrino sources are instead not in nearby galaxies, but originate in\nbinary neutron star coalescences, our limits place the progenitors at z > 0.2.\nWhile it is possible, due to the high background from atmospheric neutrinos,\nthat neither event is astrophysical, the MWA observations are nevertheless\namong the first to follow up neutrino candidates in the radio, and illustrate\nthe promise of wide-field instruments like MWA to detect electromagnetic\ncounterparts to such events.\n", "  We investigate whether the recently discovered Phoenix stream may be part of\na much longer structure that includes the previously discovered Hermus stream.\nUsing a simple model of the Galaxy with a disk, bulge, and a spherical dark\nmatter halo, we show that a nearly circular orbit, highly inclined with respect\nto the disk, can be found that fits the positions, orientations, and distances\nof both streams. While the two streams are somewhat misaligned in the sense\nthat they do not occupy the same plane, nodal precession due to the Milky Way\ndisk potential naturally brings the orbit into line with each stream in the\ncourse of half an orbit. We consequently consider a common origin for the two\nstreams as plausible. Based on our best fitting orbit, we make predictions for\nthe positions, distances, radial velocities, and proper motions along each\nstream. If our hypothesis is borne out by measurements, then at ~183 degrees\n(~235 degrees with respect to the Galactic center) and ~76 kpc in length,\nPhoenix-Hermus would become the longest cold stream yet found. This would make\nit a particularly valuable new probe of the shape and mass of the Galactic halo\nout to ~20 kpc.\n", "  High-precision kinematic studies of globular clusters require an accurate\nknowledge of all possible sources of contamination. Amongst other sources,\nbinary stars can introduce systematic biases in the kinematics. Using a set of\nMonte Carlo cluster simulations with different concentrations and binary\nfractions, we investigate the effect of unresolved binaries on proper-motion\ndispersion profiles, treating the simulations like HST proper-motion samples.\nSince globular clusters evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition,\nmore massive stars lose energy and decrease their velocity dispersion. As a\nconsequence, on average, binaries have a lower velocity dispersion, since they\nare more massive kinematic tracers. We show that, in the case of clusters with\nhigh binary fraction (initial binary fraction of 50%) and high concentration\n(i.e., closer to energy equipartition), unresolved binaries introduce a\ncolor-dependent bias in the velocity dispersion of main-sequence stars of the\norder of 0.1-0.3 km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to $1-6$% of the velocity\ndispersion), with the reddest stars having a lower velocity dispersion, due to\nthe higher fraction of contaminating binaries. This bias depends on the ability\nto distinguish binaries from single stars, on the details of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram and the photometric errors. We apply our analysis to\nthe HSTPROMO data set of NGC 7078 (M15) and show that no effect ascribable to\nbinaries is observed, consistent with the low binary fraction of the cluster.\nOur work indicates that binaries do not significantly bias proper-motion\nvelocity-dispersion profiles, but should be taken into account in the error\nbudget of kinematic analyses.\n", "  We present the first direct comparison between Balmer line and panchromatic\nSED-based SFRs for z~2 galaxies. For this comparison we used 17 star-forming\ngalaxies selected from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, with\n$3\\sigma$ detections for H$\\alpha$ and at least two IR bands (Spitzer/MIPS\n24$\\mu$m and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160$\\mu$m, and in some cases Herschel/SPIRE\n250, 350, and 500$\\mu$m). The galaxies have total IR (8-1000$\\mu$m)\nluminosities of $\\sim10^{11.4}-10^{12.4}\\,\\textrm{L}_\\odot$ and star-formation\nrates (SFRs) of $\\sim30-250\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. We fit the\nUV-to-far-IR SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis (FSPS) models -\nwhich include both stellar and dust emission - and compare the inferred SFRs\nwith the SFR(H$\\alpha$,H$\\beta$) values corrected for dust attenuation using\nBalmer decrements. The two SFRs agree with a scatter of 0.17 dex. Our results\nimply that the Balmer decrement accurately predicts the obscuration of the\nnebular lines and can be used to robustly calculate SFRs for star-forming\ngalaxies at z~2 with SFRs up to $\\sim200\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$.\nWe also use our data to assess SFR indicators based on modeling the\nUV-to-mid-IR SEDs or by adding SFR(UV) and SFR(IR), for which the latter is\nbased on the mid-IR only or on the full IR SED. All these SFRs show a poorer\nagreement with SFR(H$\\alpha$,H$\\beta$) and in some cases large systematic\nbiases are observed. Finally, we show that the SFR and dust attenuation derived\nfrom the UV-to-near-IR SED alone are unbiased when assuming a delayed\nexponentially declining star-formation history.\n", "  The orbit of Mercury has large values of eccentricity and inclination that\ncannot be easily explained if this planet formed on a circular and coplanar\norbit. Here, we study the evolution of Mercury's orbit during the instability\nrelated to the migration of the giant planets in the framework of the jumping\nJupiter model. We found that some instability models are able to produce the\ncorrect values of Mercury's eccentricity and inclination, provided that\nrelativistic effects are included in the precession of Mercury's perihelion.\nThe orbital excitation is driven by the fast change of the normal oscillation\nmodes of the system corresponding to the perihelion precession of Jupiter (for\nthe eccentricity), and the nodal regression of Uranus (for the inclination).\n", "  We present an exact diagonalization study on layered $J_{1}-J_{2}$\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin model to examine the role of frustration\ninduced by inplane next-nearest neighbor coupling $J_{2}$, in presence of\ninterlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_{\\perp}$. A finite lattice of 24 spins\nin layered geometry of $(4\\times 3)\\oplus (4\\times 3)$ is considered and the\nresulting Hamiltonian matrix diagonalized using Davidson iterative algorithm to\nobtain the ground and a few low-lying excited states. The lattice size ($24$\nspins with Hilbert space dimensionality of $2704156$ in $S_{z}^{tot}=0$\nsubspace) has been kept relatively small because of the large number of runs\nrequired to sample $J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{\\perp}$ parameter space. Quantities like\nspin-gap, Shannon entropy, spin-spin correlation, static spin structure-factor,\nmagnetic specific-heat and magnetic susceptibility are calculated for various\nvalues of spin-spin coupling parameters. With increase in interlayer coupling,\nthe system is driven to states with long range order and the interval of\nquantum paramagnetically disordered state, sandwiched between N\\'{e}el and\ncollinear ordered states, narrows on the scale of inplane frustration\nparameter.\n", "  Alternative theories of gravity and their solutions are of considerable\nimportance since at some fundamental level the world can reveal new features.\nIndeed, it is suspected that the gravitational field might be nonminimally\ncoupled to the other fields at scales not yet probed, bringing into the\nforefront nonminimally coupled theories. In this mode, we consider a nonminimal\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant. Imposing spherical\nsymmetry and staticity for the spacetime and a magnetic Wu-Yang ansatz for the\nYang-Mills field, we find expressions for the solutions of the theory. Further\nimposing constraints on the nonminimal parameters, we find a family of exact\nsolutions of the theory depending on five parameters, namely, two nonminimal\nparameters, the cosmological constant, the magnetic charge, and the mass. These\nsolutions represent magnetic monopoles and black holes in magnetic monopoles\nwith de Sitter, Minkowskian, and anti-de Sitter asymptotics, depending on the\nsign and value of the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. We classify completely\nthe family of solutions with respect to the number and the type of horizons and\nshow that the spacetime solutions can have, at most, four horizons. For\nparticular sets of the parameters, these horizons can become double, triple,\nand quadruple. For instance, for a positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda$,\nthere is a critical $\\Lambda_c$ for which the solution admits a quadruple\nhorizon, evocative of the $\\Lambda_c$ that appears for a given energy density\nin both the Einstein static and Eddington-Lema\\^{\\i}tre dynamical universes. As\nan example of our classification, we analyze solutions in the Drummond-Hathrell\nnonminimal theory that describe nonminimal black holes. Another application is\nwith a set of regular black holes previously treated.\n", "  We provide an evidence for the validity of strong monogamy inequality of\nmulti-party quantum entanglement using square of convex-roof extended\nnegativity(SCREN). We first consider a large class of multi-qudit mixed state\nthat are in a partially coherent superposition of a generalized W-class state\nand the vacuum, and provide some useful properties about this class of states.\nWe show that monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement in terms of SCREN\nholds for this class of states. We further show that SCREN strong monogamy\ninequality of multi-qudit entanglement also holds for this class of states.\nThus SCREN is a good alternative to characterize the monogamous and strongly\nmonogamous properties of multi-qudit entanglement.\n", "  Corona structures and processes during the pre-impulsive stage of solar\neruption are crucial to understanding the physics leading to the subsequent\nexplosive energy release. Here we present the first microwave imaging study of\na hot flux rope structure during the pre-impulsive stage of an eruptive M7.7\nsolar flare, with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz. The flux rope\nis also observed by the SDO/AIA in its hot passbands of 94 and 131 \\AA\\. In the\nmicrowave data, it is revealed as an overall arcade-like structure consisting\nof several intensity enhancements bridged by generally weak emissions, with\nbrightness temperatures ($T_B$) varying from ~10,000~K to ~20,000 K. Locations\nof microwave intensity enhancements along the structure remain relatively fixed\nat certain specific parts of the flux rope, indicating that the distribution of\nemitting electrons is affected by the large scale magnetic configuration of the\ntwisted flux rope. Wavelet analysis shows a pronounced 2-min period of the\nmicrowave $T_B$ variation during the pre-impulsive stage of interest. The\nperiod agrees well with that reported for AIA sunward-contracting loops and\nupward ejective plasmoids (suggested to be reconnection outflows). This\nsuggests that both periodicities are controlled by the same reconnection\nprocess that takes place intermittently at a 2-min time scale. We infer that at\nleast a part of the emission is excited by non-thermal energetic electrons via\nthe gyro-synchrotron mechanism. The study demonstrates the potential of\nmicrowave imaging in exploring the flux rope magnetic geometry and relevant\nreconnection process during the onset of solar eruption.\n", "  Generally, blinks are treated on equal with artifacts and noise while\nanalyzing EEG signals. However, blinks carry important information about mental\nprocesses and thus it is important to detect blinks accurately. The aim of the\npresented study is to propose a blink detection method and discuss its\napplication for extracting blink rate variability, a novel concept that might\nshed some light on the mental processes. In this study, 14 EEG recordings were\nselected for assessing the quality of the proposed blink detection algorithm.\n", "  There exists an inordinate amount of spectral data in both public and private\nastronomical archives which remain severely under-utilised. The lack of\nreliable open-source tools for analysing large volumes of spectra contributes\nto this situation, which is poised to worsen as large surveys successively\nrelease orders of magnitude more spectra. In this Article I introduce sick, the\nspectroscopic inference crank, a flexible and fast Bayesian tool for inferring\nastrophysical parameters from spectra. sick can be used to provide a\nnearest-neighbour estimate of model parameters, a numerically optimised point\nestimate, or full Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior\nprobability distributions. This generality empowers any astronomer to\ncapitalise on the plethora of published synthetic and observed spectra, and\nmake precise inferences for a host of astrophysical (and nuisance) quantities.\nModel intensities can be reliably approximated from existing grids of synthetic\nor observed spectra using linear multi-dimensional interpolation, or a\nCannon-based model. Additional phenomena that transform the data (e.g.,\nredshift, rotational broadening, continuum, spectral resolution) are\nincorporated as free parameters and can be marginalised away. Outlier pixels\n(e.g., cosmic rays or poorly modelled regimes) can be treated with a Gaussian\nmixture model, and a noise model is included to account for systematically\nunderestimated variance. Combining these phenomena into a scalar-justified,\nquantitative model permits precise inferences with credible uncertainties on\nnoisy data. Using a forward model on low-resolution, high S/N spectra of M67\nstars reveals atomic diffusion processes on the order of 0.05 dex, previously\nonly measurable with differential analysis techniques in high-resolution\nspectra. [abridged]\n", "  The reflection spectrum of the torus around AGN is characterized by X-ray\nfluorescent lines, which are most prominent for type II AGN. A clumpy torus\nallows photons reflected from the back-side of the torus to leak through the\nfront free-of-obscuration regions. Therefore, the observed X-ray fluorescent\nlines are sensitive to the clumpiness of the torus. We analyse a sample of type\nII AGN observed with Chandra HETGS, and measure the fluxes for the Si Ka and Fe\nKa lines. The measured Fe Ka/Si Ka ratios, spanning a range between $5-60$, are\nfar smaller than the ratios predicted from simulations of smooth tori,\nindicating that the tori of the studied sources have clumpy distributions\nrather than smooth ones. Compared with simulation results of clumpy tori with a\nhalf-opening angle of 60$^{\\circ}$, the Circinus galaxy has a Fe Ka/Si Ka ratio\nof $\\sim60$, which is close to the simulation results for $N=5$, where $N$ is\nthe average number of clumps along the line of sight. The Fe Ka/Si Ka ratios of\nthe other sources are all below the simulation results for $N=2$. Overall, it\nshows that the non-Fe fluorescent lines in the soft X-ray band are a\npotentially powerful probe of the clumpiness of the torus around AGN.\n", "  Chondrules represent one of the best probes of the physical conditions and\nprocesses acting in the early solar nebula. Proposed chondrule formation models\nare assessed based on their ability to match the meteoritic evidence,\nespecially experimental constraints on their thermal histories. The model most\nconsistent with chondrule thermal histories is passage through shock waves in\nthe solar nebula. Existing models of heating by shocks generally yield a good\nfirst-order approximation to inferred chondrule cooling rates. However, they\npredict prolonged heating in the pre-shock region, which would cause volatile\nloss and isotopic fractionation, which are not observed. These models have\ntypically included particles of a single (large) size, i.e., chondrule\nprecursors, or at most, large particles accompanied by micron-sized grains. The\nsize distribution of solids present during chondrule formation controls the\nopacity of the affected region, and significantly affects the thermal histories\nof chondrules. Micron-sized grains evaporate too quickly to prevent excessive\nheating of chondrule precursors. However, isolated grains in chondrule-forming\nregions would rapidly coagulate into fractal aggregates. Pre-shock heating by\ninfrared radiation from the shock front would cause these aggregates to melt\nand collapse into intermediate-sized (tens of microns) particles. We show that\ninclusion of such particles yields chondrule cooling rates consistent with\npetrologic and isotopic constraints.\n", "  In the single fluid, nonrelativistic, ideal-Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma\ndescription magnetic field lines play a fundamental role by defining\ndynamically preserved \"magnetic connections\" between plasma elements. Here we\nshow how the concept of magnetic connection needs to be generalized in the case\nof a relativistic MHD description where we require covariance under arbitrary\nLorentz transformations. This is performed by defining 2-D {\\it magnetic\nconnection hypersurfaces} in the 4-D Minkowski space. This generalization\naccounts for the loss of simultaneity between spatially separated events in\ndifferent frames and is expected to provide a powerful insight into the 4-D\ngeometry of electromagnetic fields when ${\\bf E} \\cdot {\\bf B} = 0$.\n", "  Bulk NdNiO3 exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as the temperature\nis lowered that is also seen in tensile strained films. In contrast, films that\nare under a large compressive strain typically remain metallic at all\ntemperatures. To clarify the microscopic origins of this behavior, we use\nposition averaged convergent beam electron diffraction in scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy to characterize strained NdNiO3 films both above and below\nthe MIT temperature. We show that a symmetry lowering structural change takes\nplace in case of the tensile strained film, which undergoes an MIT, but is\nabsent in the compressively strained film. Using space group symmetry\narguments, we show that these results support the bond length\ndisproportionation model of the MIT in the rare-earth nickelates. Furthermore,\nthe results provide insights into the non-Fermi liquid phase that is observed\nin films for which the MIT is absent.\n", "  The macroscopic current density responsible for the mean magnetization\n$\\mathbf{M}$ of a uniformly magnetized bounded sample is localized near its\nsurface. In order to evaluate $\\mathbf{M}$ one needs the current distribution\nin the whole sample: bulk and boundary. In recent years it has been shown that\nthe boundary has no effect on $\\mathbf{M}$ in insulators: therein, $\\mathbf{M}$\nadmits an alternative expression, not based on currents. $\\mathbf{M}$ can be\nexpressed in terms of the bulk electron distribution only, which is\n\"nearsighted\" (exponentially localized); this virtue is not shared by metals,\nhaving a qualitatively different electron distribution. We show, by means of\nsimulations on paradigmatic model systems, that even in metals the $\\mathbf{M}$\nvalue can be retrieved in terms of the bulk electron distribution only.\n", "  We formulate a coherent approach to signals and systems theory on time\nscales. The two derivatives from the time-scale calculus are used, i.e., nabla\n(forward) and delta (backward), and the corresponding eigenfunctions, the\nso-called nabla and delta exponentials, computed. With these exponentials, two\ngeneralised discrete-time Laplace transforms are deduced and their properties\nstudied. These transforms are compatible with the standard Laplace and $Z$\ntransforms. They are used to study discrete-time linear systems defined by\ndifference equations. These equations mimic the usual continuous-time equations\nthat are uniformly approximated when the sampling interval becomes small.\nImpulse response and transfer function notions are introduced. This implies a\nunified mathematical framework that allows us to approximate the classic\ncontinuous-time case when the sampling rate is high or to obtain the standard\ndiscrete-time case, based on difference equations, when the time grid becomes\nuniform.\n", "  There has been considerable controversy regarding the structure of\nTiBe$_{12}$, which is variously reported as hexagonal and tetragonal. Lattice\ndynamics simulations based on density functional theory show the tetragonal\nphase space group $I4/mmm$ to be more stable over all temperatures, while the\nhexagonal phase exhibits an imaginary phonon mode, which, if followed, would\nlead to the cell adopting the tetragonal structure. We then report the\npredicted ground state elastic constants and temperature dependence of the bulk\nmodulus and thermal expansion for the tetragonal phase.\n", "  The gas in galaxy clusters is heated by shock compression through accretion\n(outer shocks) and mergers (inner shocks). These processes additionally produce\nturbulence. To analyse the relation between the thermal and turbulent energies\nof the gas under the influence of non-adiabatic processes, we performed\nnumerical simulations of cosmic structure formation in a box of 152 Mpc\ncomoving size with radiative cooling, UV background, and a subgrid scale model\nfor numerically unresolved turbulence. By smoothing the gas velocities with an\nadaptive Kalman filter, we are able to estimate bulk flows toward cluster\ncores. This enables us to infer the velocity dispersion associated with the\nturbulent fluctuation relative to the bulk flow. For halos with masses above\n$10^{13}\\,M_\\odot$, we find that the turbulent velocity dispersions averaged\nover the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and the intracluster medium (ICM)\nare approximately given by powers of the mean gas temperatures with exponents\naround 0.5, corresponding to a roughly linear relation between turbulent and\nthermal energies and transonic Mach numbers. However, turbulence is only weakly\ncorrelated with the halo mass. Since the power-law relation is stiffer for the\nWHIM, the turbulent Mach number tends to increase with the mean temperature of\nthe WHIM. This can be attributed to enhanced turbulence production relative to\ndissipation in particularly hot and turbulent clusters.\n", "  Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are suggested to be acceleration sites of cosmic\nrays in the Galaxy. While the magnetic field plays an important role in the\nacceleration process, previous observations of magnetic field configurations of\nPWNe are rare, particularly for evolved systems. We present a radio\npolarization study of the \"Snail\" PWN inside the supernova remnant G327.1-1.1\nusing the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This PWN is believed to have been\nrecently crushed by the supernova (SN) reverse shock. The radio morphology is\ncomposed of a main circular body with a finger-like protrusion. We detected a\nstrong linear polarization signal from the emission, which reflects a highly\nordered magnetic field in the PWN and is in contrast to the turbulent\nenvironment with a tangled magnetic field generally expected from\nhydrodynamical simulations. This could suggest that the characteristic\nturbulence scale is larger than the radio beam size. We built a toy model to\nexplore this possibility, and found that a simulated PWN with a turbulence\nscale of about one-eighth to one-sixth of the nebula radius and a pulsar wind\nfilling factor of 50--75% provides the best match to observations. This implies\nsubstantial mixing between the SN ejecta and pulsar wind material in this\nsystem.\n", "  We report on a search for optical pulsations from PSR J0337+1715 at its\nobserved radio pulse period. PSR J0337+1715 is a millisecond pulsar (2.7 ms\nspin period) in a triple hierarchical system with two white dwarfs, and has a\nknown optical counterpart with g-band magnitude 18. The observations were done\nwith the Array Camera for Optical to Near-IR Spectrophotometry (ARCONS) at the\n200\" Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. No significant pulsations were\nfound in the range 4000-11000 angstroms, and we can limit pulsed emission in\ng-band to be fainter than 25 mag.\n", "  We present an intrinsic AGN SED extending from the optical to the submm,\nderived with a sample of unobscured, optically luminous (vLv(5100)>10^43.5\nerg/s) QSOs at z<0.18 from the Palomar Green survey. The intrinsic AGN SED was\ncomputed by removing the contribution from stars using the 11.3um polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature in the QSOs' mid-IR spectra; the 1sigma\nuncertainty on the SED ranges between 12 and 45 per cent as a function of\nwavelength and is a combination of PAH flux measurement errors and the\nuncertainties related to the conversion between PAH luminosity and star-forming\nluminosity. Longwards of 20um the shape of the intrinsic AGN SED is independent\nof the AGN power indicating that our template should be applicable to all\nsystems hosting luminous AGN (vLv(5100) or L_X(2-10keV) > 10^43.5 erg/s). We\nnote that for our sample of luminous QSOs, the average AGN emission is at least\nas high as, and mostly higher than, the total stellar powered emission at all\nwavelengths from the optical to the submm. This implies that in many galaxies\nhosting powerful AGN, there is no `safe' broadband photometric observation (at\nlambda<1000um) which can be used in calculating star-formation rates without\nsubtracting the AGN contribution. Roughly, the AGN contribution may be ignored\nonly if the intrinsic AGN luminosity at 5100 Ang is at least a factor of 4\nsmaller than the total infrared luminosity (L_IR; 8-1000um) of the galaxy.\nFinally, we examine the implication of our work in statistical studies of\nstar-formation in AGN host galaxies.\n", "  A sub-set of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), with X-ray\nluminosities well above $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, typically have energy spectra\nwhich can be well described as hard power-laws, and short-term variability in\nexcess of $\\sim10\\%$. This combination of properties suggests that these ULXs\nmay be some of the best candidates to host intermediate mass black holes\n(IMBHs), which would be accreting at sub-Eddington rates in the hard state seen\nin Galactic X-ray binaries. In this work, we present a temporal and spectral\nanalysis of all of the available XMM-Newton data from one such ULX, the\npreviously poorly studied 2XMM J143242.1$-$440939, located in NGC 5643. We\nreport that its high quality EPIC spectra can be better described by a broad,\nthermal component, such as an advection dominated disc or an optically thick\nComptonising corona. In addition, we find a hint of a marginal change in the\nshort-term variability which does not appear to be clearly related to the\nsource unabsorbed luminosity. We discuss the implications of these results,\nexcluding the possibility that the source may be host an IMBH in a low state,\nand favouring an interpretation in terms of super-Eddington accretion on to a\nblack hole of stellar origin. The properties of NGC 5643 ULX1 allow us to\nassociate this source to the population of the hard/ultraluminous ULX class.\n", "  The combinations of particle aspect ratio and enthalpic-barrier templates\nthat lead to translational and orientational ordering of monolayers of\nrectangular particles are determined using Monte Carlo simulations and density\nfunctional theory. For sufficiently high enthalpic barriers, we find that only\nspecific combinations of particle sizes and template spacings lead to ordered\narrays. The pattern multiplication factor provided by the template extends to\napproximately ten times the smallest dimension of the particle.\n", "  Despite intensive searches, the only pulsar within 0.1 pc of the central\nblack hole in our Galaxy, Sgr A*, is a radio-loud magnetar. Since magnetars are\nrare among the Galactic neutron star population, and a large number of massive\nstars are already known in this region, the Galactic centre (GC) should harbor\na large number of neutron stars. Population syntheses suggest several thousand\nneutron stars may be present in the GC. Many of these could be highly energetic\nmillisecond pulsars which are also proposed to be responsible for the GC\ngamma-ray excess. We propose that the presence of a neutron star within 0.03~pc\nfrom Sgr~A* can be revealed by the shock interactions with the disk around the\ncentral black hole. As we demonstrate, these interactions result in observable\ntransient non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission over timescales of months,\nprovided that the spin down luminosity of the neutron star is L_{sd}~10^{35}\nerg/s. Current limits on the population of normal and millisecond pulsars in\nthe GC region suggest that a number of such pulsars are present with such\nluminosities.\n", "  We develop a model for subpulse separation period, $P_2$, taking into account\nboth the apparent motion of the visible point as a function of pulsar phase,\n$\\psi$, and the possibility of abrupt jumps between different rotation states\nin non-corotating pulsar magnetospheres. We identify three frequencies: (i) the\nspin frequency of the star, (ii) the drift frequency of the magnetospheric\nplasma in the source region, and (iii) the angular frequency of the visible\npoint around its trajectory. We show how the last of these, which is neglected\nin traditional models by implicitly assuming the line of sight through the\ncenter of the star, affects the interpretation of $P_2$. We attribute the\nsubpulse structure to emission from $m$ anti-nodes distributed uniformly in\nazimuthal angle about the magnetic axis. We show that variations of $P_2$ as a\nfunction of rotational phase or observing frequency arise naturally when the\nmotion of the visible point is taken into account. We discuss possible\napplication of our model in signifying overall field-line distortion at the\nemitting region. Abrupt changes in $P_2$ can occur during state switching in\nthe magnetosphere. We demonstrate that the unique value of $P_2$ in each\nrotation state can be used, in principle, to relate the rotation state of the\nmagnetospheres to subpulse drifting.\n", "  We present an in depth study on the evolution of galaxy properties in compact\ngroups over the past 3 Gyr. We are using the largest multi-wavelength sample\nto-date, comprised 1770 groups (containing 7417 galaxies), in the redshift\nrange of 0.01<z<0.23. To derive the physical properties of the galaxies we rely\non ultraviolet (UV)-to-infrared spectral energy distribution modeling, using\nCIGALE. Our results suggest that during the 3 Gyr period covered by our sample,\nthe star formation activity of galaxies in our groups has been substantially\nreduced (3-10 times). Moreover, their star formation histories as well as their\nUV-optical and mid-infrared colors are significantly different from those of\nfield and cluster galaxies, indicating that compact group galaxies spend more\ntime transitioning through the green valley. The morphological transformation\nfrom late-type spirals into early-type galaxies occurs in the mid-infrared\ntransition zone rather than in the UV-optical green valley. We find evidence of\nshocks in the emission line ratios and gas velocity dispersions of the\nlate-type galaxies located below the star forming main sequence. Our results\nsuggest that in addition to gas stripping, turbulence and shocks might play an\nimportant role in suppressing the star formation in compact group galaxies.\n", "  We present the first detailed integral field spectroscopy study of nine\ncentral void galaxies with M*>10^10 Msun using the Wide Field Spectrograph\n(WiFeS) to determine how a range of assembly histories manifest themselves in\nthe current day Universe. While the majority of these galaxies are evolving\nsecularly, we find a range of morphologies, merger histories and stellar\npopulation distributions, though similarly low Halpha-derived star formation\nrates (<1 Msun/yr). Two of our nine galaxies host AGNs, and two have kinematic\ndisruptions to their gas that are not seen in their stellar component. Most\nmassive void galaxies are red and discy, which we attribute to a lack of major\nmergers. Some have disturbed morphologies and may be in the process of evolving\nto early-type thanks to ongoing minor mergers at present times, likely fed by\ntendrils leading off filaments. The diversity in our small galaxy sample,\ndespite being of similar mass and environment means that these galaxies are\nstill assembling at present day, with minor mergers playing an important role\nin their evolution.\n  We compare our sample to a mass and magnitude-matched sample of field\ngalaxies, using data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field\nspectrograph (SAMI) galaxy survey. We find that despite environmental\ndifferences, galaxies of mass M*>10^10 Msun have similarly low star formation\nrates (<3 Msun/yr). The lack of distinction between the star formation rates of\nthe void and field environments points to quenching of massive galaxies being a\nlargely mass-related effect.\n", "  We analyze vector localized solutions of two-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) with variable nonlinearity parameter and external trap\npotential through similarity transformation technique which transforms the two\ncoupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations into a pair of coupled nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equations with constant coefficients under a specific\nintegrability condition. In this analysis we consider three different types of\nexternal trap potentials: a time-independent trap, a time-dependent monotonic\ntrap, and a time-dependent periodic trap. We point out the existence of\ndifferent interesting localized structures, namely rogue waves, dark-and bright\nsoliton-rogue wave, and rogue wave-breather-like wave for the above three cases\nof trap potentials. We show how the vector localized density profiles in a\nconstant background get deformed when we tune the strength of the trap\nparameter. Further we investigate the nature of the trajectories of the\nnonautonomous rogue waves. We also construct the dark-dark rogue wave solution\nfor repulsive-repulsive interaction of two-component BECs and analyze the\nassociated characteristics for the three different kinds of traps. We then\ndeduce single, two and three composite rogue waves for three component BECs and\ndiscuss the correlated characteristics when we tune the strength of the trap\nparameter for different trap potentials.\n", "  We use near infrared integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy to search for\nH$\\alpha$ emission associated with star formation in a sample of 28 heavily\nreddened ($E(B-V)\\simeq$0.5-1.9), hyperluminous\n($log(L_{bol}/ergs^{-1})\\simeq$47-48) broad-line quasars at $z\\simeq$1.4-2.7.\nSixteen of the 28 quasars show evidence for star formation with an average\nextinction-corrected star formation rate (SFR) of 320$\\pm$70M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$.\nA stacked spectrum of the detections shows weak [NII], consistent with star\nformation as the origin of the narrow H$\\alpha$ emission. The star-forming\nregions are spatially unresolved in 11 of the 16 detections and constrained to\nlie within $\\sim$6kpc of the quasar emission. In the five resolved detections\nwe find the star-forming regions are extended on scales of $\\sim$8kpc around\nthe quasar emission. The prevalence of high SFRs is consistent with the\nidentification of the heavily reddened quasar population as representing a\ntransitional phase from apparent `starburst galaxies' to optically-luminous\nquasars. Upper limits are determined for 10 quasars in which star formation is\nundetected. In two of the quasars the SFR is constrained to be relatively\nmodest, $<$50M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$, but significantly higher levels of star\nformation could be present in the other eight quasars. The combination of the\n16 strong star formation detections and the eight high SFR limits means that\nhigh levels of star formation may be present in the majority of the sample.\nHigher spatial resolution data, of multiple emission lines, will allow us to\nbetter understand the interplay between star formation and Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) activity in these transitioning quasars.\n", "  Alhena ($\\gamma$ Gem) was observed in the frame of the BRITE (BRIght Target\nExplorer) spectropolarimetric survey, which gathers high resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise, high sensitivity, spectropolarimetric observations of all\nstars brighter than V=4 to combine seismic and spectropolarimetric studies of\nbright stars.\n  We present here the discovery of a very weak magnetic field \\textbf{on} the\nAm star Alhena, thanks to very high signal-to-noise spectropolarimetric data\nobtained with Narval at T\\'elescope Bernard Lyot (TBL). All previously studied\nAm stars show the presence of ultra-weak (sub-Gauss) fields with Zeeman\nsignatures with an unexpected prominent positive lobe. However, Alhena presents\na slightly stronger (but still very weak, only a few Gauss) field with normal\nZeeman signatures with a positive and negative lobe, as found in stronger field\n(hundreds or thousands of Gauss) stars. It is the first detection of a normal\nmagnetic signature in an Am star.\n  Alhena is thus a very interesting object, which might provide the clue to\nunderstanding the peculiar shapes of the magnetic signatures of the other Am\nstars.\n", "  To probe the circumstellar environment of IRAS 13481-6124, a 20 M_sun\nhigh-mass young stellar object (HMYSO) with a parsec-scale jet and accretion\ndisc, we investigate the origin of its Br\\gamma-emission line through NIR\ninterferometry. We present the first AMBER/VLTI observations of the\nBr\\gamma-emitting region in an HMYSO at R~1500. Our AMBER/VLTI observations\nreveal a spatially and spectrally resolved Br\\gamma-line in emission with a\nstrong P Cygni profile, indicating outflowing matter with a terminal velocity\nof ~500 km/s. Visibilities, differential phases, and closure phases are\ndetected in our observations within the spectral line and in the adjacent\ncontinuum. Both total visibilities (continuum plus line emitting region) and\npure-line visibilities indicate that the Br\\gamma-emitting region is more\ncompact (2-4 mas in diameter or ~6-13 au at 3.2 kpc) than the\ncontinuum-emitting region (~5.4 mas or ~17 au). The absorption feature is also\nspatially resolved at the longest baselines (81 and 85 m) and has a visibility\nthat is slightly smaller than the continuum-emitting region. The differential\nphases at the four longest baselines display an \\u2018S\\u2019-shaped structure\nacross the line, peaking in the blue- and red-shifted high-velocity components.\nThe calibrated photocentre shifts are aligned with the known jet axis, i.e they\nare probably tracing an ionised jet. The high-velocity components (v_r~100-500\nkm/s) are located far from the source, whereas the low-velocity components\n(0-100 km/s) are observed to be closer, indicating a strong acceleration of the\ngas flow in the inner 10 au. Finally, a non-zero closure phase along the\ncontinuum is detected. By comparing our observations with the synthetic images\nof the continuum around 2.16 um, we confirm that this feature originates from\nthe asymmetric brightness distribution of the continuum owing to the\ninclination of the inner disc.\n", "  We report an experimental and theoretical investigation of the lattice\ndynamics and thermal properties of the actinide dioxide NpO$_2$. The\nenergy-wavevector dispersion relation for normal modes of vibration propagating\nalong the $[001]$, $[110]$, and $[111]$ high-symmetry lines in NpO$_2$ at room\ntemperature has been determined by measuring the coherent one-phonon scattering\nof X-rays from a $\\sim$1.2 mg single-crystal specimen, the largest available\nsingle crystal for this compound. The results are compared against ab initio\nphonon dispersions computed within the first-principles density functional\ntheory in the generalized gradient approximation plus Hubbard $U$ correlation\n(GGA+$U$) approach, taking into account third-order anharmonicity effects in\nthe quasiharmonic approximation. Good agreement with the experiment is obtained\nfor calculations with an on-site Coulomb parameter $U = 4$ eV and Hund's\nexchange $J= 0.6$ eV in line with previous electronic structure calculations.\nWe further compute the thermal expansion, heat capacity, thermal conductivity,\nphonon linewidth, and thermal phonon softening, and compare with available\nexperiments. The theoretical and measured heat capacities are in close\nagreement with another. About 27% of the calculated thermal conductivity is due\nto phonons with energy higher than 25 meV ($\\sim$ 6 THz ), suggesting an\nimportant role of high-energy optical phonons in the heat transport. The\nsimulated thermal expansion reproduces well the experimental data up to about\n1000 K, indicating a failure of the quasiharmonic approximation above this\nlimit.\n", "  We measure chemical abundance ratios and radial velocities in four massive\n(i.e., young) [alpha/Fe]-rich red giant stars using high-resolution high-S/N\nspectra from ESPaDOnS fed by Gemini-GRACES. Our differential analysis ensures\nthat our chemical abundances are on the same scale as the Alves-Brito et al.\n(2010) study of bulge, thin and thick disk red giants. We confirm that the\nprogram stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios and are slightly metal poor.\nAside from lithium enrichment in one object, the program stars exhibit no\nchemical abundance anomalies when compared to giant stars of similar\nmetallicity throughout the Galaxy. This includes the elements Li, O, Si, Ca,\nTi, Cr, Ni, Cu, Ba, La, and Eu. Therefore, there are no obvious chemical\nsignatures that can help to reveal the origin of these unusual stars. While our\nnew observations show that only one star (not the Li-rich object) exhibits a\nradial velocity variation, simulations indicate that we cannot exclude the\npossibility that all four could be binaries. In addition, we find that two\n(possibly three) stars show evidence for an infrared excess, indicative of a\ndebris disk. This is consistent with these young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars being\nevolved blue stragglers, suggesting their apparent young age is a consequence\nof a merger or mass transfer. We would expect a binary fraction of ~50% or\ngreater for the entire sample of these stars, but the signs of the circumbinary\ndisk may have been lost since these features can have short timescales. Radial\nvelocity monitoring is needed to confirm the blue straggler origin.\n", "  We explore the past evolution of Saturn's moons using direct numerical\nintegrations. We find that the past Tethys-Dione 3:2 orbital resonance\npredicted in standard models likely did not occur, implying that the system is\nless evolved than previously thought. On the other hand, the orbital\ninclinations of Tethys, Dione and Rhea suggest that the system did cross the\nDione-Rhea 5:3 resonance, which is closely followed by a Tethys-Dione secular\nresonance. A clear implication is that either the moons are significantly\nyounger than the planet, or that their tidal evolution must be extremely slow\n(Q > 80,000). As an extremely slow-evolving system is incompatible with intense\ntidal heating of Enceladus, we conclude that the moons interior to Titan are\nnot primordial, and we present a plausible scenario for the system's recent\nformation. We propose that the mid-sized moons re-accreted from a disk about\n100 Myr ago, during which time Titan acquired its significant orbital\neccentricity. We speculate that this disk has formed through orbital\ninstability and massive collisions involving the previous generation of\nSaturn's mid-sized moons. We identify the solar evection resonance perturbing a\npair of mid-sized moons as the most likely trigger of such an instability. This\nscenario implies that most craters on the moons interior to Titan must have\nbeen formed by planetocentric impactors.\n", "  The experimentally available data on the alpha decay half lives and Q? values\nfor 96 superheavy nuclei are used to fix the parameters for a modified version\nof the Brown empirical formula through two fitting procedures which enables its\ncomparison with similar fits using Viola-Seaborg and Royer formulas. The new\nexpressions provide very good agreement with experimental data having fewer or\nthe same number of parameters. All formulas with the obtained parameters are\nthen extrapolated to generate half lives predictions for 125 unknown superheavy\nalpha emitters. The nuclei where the employed empirical formulas maximally or\nminimally diverge are pointed out and a selection of 36 nuclei with exceptional\nsuperposition of predictions was made for experimental reference.\n", "  The origin of the radio emission in radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) has been a\nmatter of debate for a long time. It is not well understood whether the\nemission is caused by star formation in the host galaxy or by black hole\nactivity of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). We shed some light on these\nquestions using the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique to\nsearch for RQQs in the field of the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS). The\nextensive multi-wavelength coverage of the field (from radio to X-rays) was\nused to classify RQQs, and the milli-arcsecond resolution of VLBI provides a\ndirect way to identify AGNs. In a sample of 18 RQQs we detected 3 using the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.4 GHz. In this letter we report for the\nfirst time on a sample of RQQs with a measured lower limit on the fraction of\nradio emission coming from the AGN, thus demonstrating that the radio emission\nof at least some RQQs is dominated by an AGN.\n", "  The mechanism of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) is still debated and might arise from the central AGN, from star\nformation activity in the host, or from either of these sources. A direct\ndetection of compact and bright radio cores embedded in sources that are\nclassified as RQ can unambiguously determine whether a central AGN\nsignificantly contributes to the radio emission. We search for compact,\nhigh-surface-brightness radio cores in RQ AGNs that are caused unambiguously by\nAGN activity. We used the Australian Long Baseline Array to search for compact\nradio cores in four RQ AGNs located in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South\n(ECDFS). We also targeted four radio-loud (RL) AGNs as a control sample. We\ndetected compact and bright radio cores in two AGNs that are classified as RQ\nand in one that is classified as RL. Two RL AGNs were not imaged because the\nquality of the observations was too poor. We report on a first direct evidence\nof radio cores in RQ AGNs at cosmological redshifts. Our detections show that\nsome of the sources that are classified as RQ contain an active AGN that can\ncontribute significantly (about 50% or more) to the total radio emission.\n", "  We apply the relativistic precession (RP) model with its variants and the\nresonance epicyclic model with its variants, based on the frequencies of the\ngeodesic epicyclic motion in the field of a Kerr black hole, to put limits on\nthe mass of the black hole in the ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-1\ndemonstrating twin high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) with\nthe frequency ratio near 3:2. The mass limits implied by the geodesic HF QPO\nmodels are compared to those obtained due to the model of string loop\noscillations around a stable equilibrium position. Assuming the whole range of\nthe black hole dimensionless spin, 0 < a < 1, the restrictions on the black\nhole mass related to the twin HF QPOs are widely extended and strongly model\ndependent; nevertheless, they give the lower limit M_{M82 X-1} > 130 M_{sun}\nconfirming existence of an intermediate black hole in the M82 X-1 source. The\nupper limit given by one of the variants of the geodesic twin HF QPO models\ngoes up to M_{M82 X-1}<1500 M_{sun}. The range 37-210 mHz of the low-frequency\nQPOs observed in the M82 X-1 source introduces additional restrictive limits on\nthe black hole mass, if we model the low-frequency QPOs by nodal precession of\nthe epicyclic motion. The nodal precession model restrictions combined with\nthose implied by the geodesic models of the twin HF QPOs give allowed ranges of\nthe M82 X-1 black hole parameters, namely 140 M_{sun}<M_{M82 X-1}<660 M_{sun}\nfor the mass parameter and 0.05<a_{M82 X-1}<0.6 for the spin parameter.\n", "  A continuous supersonic flow reactor has been used to measure rate constants\nfor the C + NH3 reaction over the temperature range 50 to 296 K. C atoms were\ncreated by the pulsed laser photolysis of CBr4. The kinetics of the title\nreaction were followed directly by vacuum ultra-violet laser induced\nfluorescence (VUV LIF) of C loss and through H formation. The experiments show\nunambiguously that the reaction is rapid at 296 K, becoming faster at lower\ntemperatures, reaching a value of 1.8 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 50 K. As this\nreaction is not currently included in astrochemical networks, its influence on\ninterstellar nitrogen hydride abundances is tested through a dense cloud model\nincluding gas-grain interactions. In particular, the effect of the\northo-to-para ratio of H2 which plays a crucial role in interstellar NH3\nsynthesis is examined.\n", "  We present the latest result of the TAPAS project that is devoted to intense\nmonitoring of planetary candidates that are identified within the\nPennState-Toru\\'n planet search.\n  We aim to detect planetary systems around evolved stars to be able to build\nsound statistics on the frequency and intrinsic nature of these systems, and to\ndeliver in-depth studies of selected planetary systems with evidence of\nstar-planet interaction processes.\n  The paper is based on precise radial velocity measurements: 13 epochs\ncollected over 1920 days with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its\nHigh-Resolution Spectrograph, and 22 epochs of ultra-precise HARPS-N data\ncollected over 961 days.\n  We present a warm-Jupiter ($T_{eq}=1350 K$, $m_{2} sin i=5.4\\pm$0.4$M_{J}$)\ncompanion with an orbital period of 26.468 days in a circular ($e=0.036$) orbit\naround a giant evolved ($\\log g=3.11\\pm0.09$, $R=6.26\\pm0.86R_{\\odot}$) star\nwith $M_{\\star}=1.87\\pm0.17M_{\\odot}$. This is the most massive and oldest star\nfound to be hosting a close-in giant planet. Its proximity to its host\n($a=0.21au$) means that the planet has a $13.9\\pm2.0\\%$ probability of\ntransits; this calls for photometric follow-up study.\n  This massive warm Jupiter with a near circular orbit around an evolved\nmassive star can help set constraints on general migration mechanisms for warm\nJupiters and, given its high equilibrium temperature, can help test energy\ndeposition models in hot Jupiters.\n", "  Tidal interactions between disc galaxies and low mass companions are an\nestablished method for generating galactic spiral features. In this work we\npresent a study of the structure and dynamics of spiral arms driven in\ninteractions between disc galaxies and perturbing companions in 3-D\nN-body/smoothed hydrodynamical numerical simulations. Our specific aims are to\ncharacterize any differences between structures formed in the gas and stars\nfrom a purely hydrodynamical and gravitational perspective, and to find a\nlimiting case for spiral structure generation. Through analysis of a number of\ndifferent interacting cases, we find that there is very little difference\nbetween arm morphology, pitch angles and pattern speeds between the two media.\nThe main differences are a minor offset between gas and stellar arms, clear\nspurring features in gaseous arms, and different radial migration of material\nin the stronger interacting cases. We investigate the minimum mass of a\ncompanion required to drive spiral structure in a galactic disc, finding the\nlimiting spiral generation cases with companion masses of the order\n$1\\times10^9M_\\odot$, equivalent to only 4% of the stellar disc mass, or 0.5%\nof the total galactic mass of a Milky Way analogue.\n", "  We report the discovery of a rare compact early-type galaxy, SDSS\nJ085431.18+173730.5 (hereafter cE\\_AGN). It has an half light radius of R$_{e}$\n= 490 pc and a brightness of M$_{r}$ = $-$18.08 mag. Optical spectroscopy\navailable from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) reveals the presence of\nprominent broad-line emissions with the H$\\alpha$ broad component width of\nFWHM=2400 km/s. The black hole (BH) mass, as estimated from the luminosity and\nwidth of the broad H$\\alpha$ emission, is 2.1$\\times$10$^{6}$ M$_{\\sun}$. With\nthe help of surface photometry, we perform a detailed analysis of the\nstructural properties. The observed light distribution is best modeled with a\ndouble S\\'ersic function. Fixing the outer component as an exponential disk, we\nfind that the inner component has a S\\'ersic index of n = 1.4. Considering the\ninner component as bulge/spheroidal we find that cE\\_AGN remains consistent in\nboth BH mass -- bulge mass relation and BH mass -- bulge S\\'ersic index\nrelation. Given these observational properties, we discuss its possible origin\ninvestigating the surrounding environment where it is located.\n", "  We analyze modern operational models of wind wave prediction on the subject\nfor compliance dissipation. Our numerical simulations from the \"first\nprinciple\" demonstrate that heuristic formulas for damping rate of free wind\nsea due to \"white capping\" (or wave breaking) dramatically exaggerates the role\nof this effect in these models.\n", "  The first black hole seeds, formed when the Universe was younger than 500\nMyr, are recognized to play an important role for the growth of early (z ~ 7)\nsuper-massive black holes. While progresses have been made in understanding\ntheir formation and growth, their observational signatures remain largely\nunexplored. As a result, no detection of such sources has been confirmed so\nfar. Supported by numerical simulations, we present a novel photometric method\nto identify black hole seed candidates in deep multi-wavelength surveys. We\npredict that these highly-obscured sources are characterized by a steep\nspectrum in the infrared (1.6-4.5 micron), i.e. by very red colors. The method\nselects the only 2 objects with a robust X-ray detection found in the\nCANDELS/GOODS-S survey with a photometric redshift z > 6. Fitting their\ninfrared spectra only with a stellar component would require unrealistic star\nformation rates (>2000 solar masses per year). To date, the selected objects\nrepresent the most promising black hole seed candidates, possibly formed via\nthe direct collapse black hole scenario, with predicted mass >10^5 solar\nmasses. While this result is based on the best photometric observations of\nhigh-z sources available to date, additional progress is expected from\nspectroscopic and deeper X-ray data. Upcoming observatories, like the JWST,\nwill greatly expand the scope of this work.\n", "  The DFT/vdW-WF2s1 method based on the generation of localized Wannier\nfunctions, recently developed to include the van der Waals interactions in the\nDensity Functional Theory and describe adsorption processes on metal surfaces\nby taking metal-screening effects into account, is applied to the case of the\ninteraction of Xe with noble-metal surfaces, namely Ag(111), Au(111), and\nCu(111). The study is also repeated by adopting the DFT/vdW-QHO-WF variant\nrelying on the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator model which describes well many-body\neffects. Comparison of the computed equilibrium binding energies and distances,\nand the $C_3$ coefficients characterizing the adatom-surface van der Waals\ninteractions, with available experimental and theoretical reference data shows\nthat the methods perform well and elucidate the importance of properly\nincluding screening effects. The results are also compared with those obtained\nby other vdW-corrected DFT schemes, including PBE-D, vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, rVV10,\nand by the simpler Local Density Approximation (LDA) and semilocal (PBE)\nGeneralized Gradient Approximation (GGA) approaches.\n", "  Recent years have seen the discovery of an ever growing number of stellar\ndebris streams and clouds. These structures are typically detected as extended\nand often curvilinear overdensities of metal-poor stars that stand out from the\nforeground disk population. The streams typically stretch tens of degrees or\nmore across the sky, even encircling the Galaxy, and range in heliocentric\ndistance from 3 to 100 kpc. This chapter summarizes the techniques used for\nfinding such streams and provides tables giving positions, distances,\nvelocities, and metallicities, where available, for all major streams and\nclouds that have been detected as of January 2015. Sky maps of the streams are\nalso provided. Properties of individual tidal debris structures are discussed.\n", "  In this paper a mass dimension one fermionic sigma model, realized by the\neigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator with dual helicity (Elko\nspinors), is developed. Such spinors are chosen as a specific realization of\nmass dimension one spinors, wherein the non-commutative fermionic feature is\nruled by torsion. Moreover, we analyse Elko spinors as a source of matter in a\nbackground in expansion. Moreover, we analyse Elko spinors as a source of\nmatter in a background in expansion and we have found that such kind of mass\ndimension one fermions can serve not only as dark matter but they also induce\nan effective cosmological constant.\n", "  It is shown, using results of measurements of ion saturation current in the\nplasma edges of different magnetic fusion confinement devices (tokamaks and\nstellarators), that the plasma dynamics in the edges is dominated by\ndistributed chaos with spontaneously broken translational symmetry at low\nmagnetic field, and with spontaneously broken reflexional symmetry (by helical\nsolitons) at high magnetic field.\n", "  The paper contains the description of the dynamics of non-equilibrium\nprocesses of spin $s=1$ magnets in an external variable field. We have obtained\nnonlinear dynamic equations with sources and calculated low-frequency\nasymptotics of two-time Green's functions for ferro- and quadrupole magnetic\nstates with $SO(3)$ and $SU(3)$ exchange symmetry of the Hamiltonian. It has\nbeen shown that for ferro- and quadrupole magnetic states singularities of\nGreen's functions in wave vectors $1/k$, $1/k^2$ and frequencies $1/\\omega,\n1/\\omega^2$ have well-known character. We set the exact form of the magnetic\nanisotropy of these Green's functions. For states with $SO(3)$ symmetry of the\nexchange Hamiltonian, we have found Green's functions with quadrupole degrees\nof freedom and compared them with Green's functions of magnets having exchange\n$SU(3)$ symmetry.\n", "  In this chapter we review the electrostatic properties of charged membranes\nin aqueous solutions, with or without added salt, employing simple physical\nmodels. The equilibrium ionic profiles close to the membrane are governed by\nthe well-known Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. We analyze the effect of\ndifferent boundary conditions, imposed by the membrane, on the ionic profiles\nand the corresponding osmotic pressure. The discussion is separated into the\nsingle membrane case and that of two interacting membranes. For one membrane\nsetup, we show the different solutions of the PB equation and discuss the\ninterplay between constant-charge and constant-potential boundary conditions. A\nmodification of the PB theory is presented to treat the extremely high\ncounter-ion concentration in the vicinity of a charge membrane. For two\nequally-charged membranes, we analyze the different pressure regimes for the\nconstant-charge boundary condition, and discuss the difference in the osmotic\npressure for various boundary conditions. The non-equal charged membranes is\nreviewed as well, and the crossover from repulsion to attraction is calculated\nanalytically. We then examine the charge-regulation boundary condition and\ndiscuss its effects on the ionic profiles and the osmotic pressure for two\nequally-charged membranes. In the last section, we briefly review the van der\nWaals (vdW) interactions and their effect on the free energy between two planar\nmembranes. We explain the simple Hamaker pair-wise summation procedure, and\nintroduce the more rigorous Lifshitz theory. The latter is a key ingredient in\nthe DLVO theory, which combines repulsive electrostatic with attractive vdW\ninteractions, and offers a simple explanation for colloidal or membrane\nstability. Finally, the chapter ends by a short account of the limitations of\nthe approximations inherent in the PB theory.\n", "  The resolution and efficiency of a precision drift-tube chamber for the ATLAS\nmuon spectrometer with final read-out electronics was tested at the Gamma\nIrradiation Facility at CERN in a 100 GeV muon beam and at photon irradiation\nrates of up to 990 Hz/square cm which corresponds to twice the highest\nbackground rate expected in ATLAS. A silicon strip detector telescope was used\nas external reference in the beam. The pulse-height measurement of the read-out\nelectronics was used to perform time-slewing corrections which lead to an\nimprovement of the average drift-tube resolution from 104 microns to 82 microns\nwithout irradiation and from 128 microns to 108 microns at the maximum expected\nrate. The measured drift-tube efficiency agrees with the expectation from the\ndead time of the read-out electronics up to the maximum expected rate.\n", "  In nonzero magnetic field, the magnetic properties and thermodynamics of the\nquantum-chromodynamic (QCD) matter is studied in the hadron resonance gas and\nthe Polyakov linear-sigma models and compared with recent lattice calculations.\nBoth models are fairly suited to describe the degrees of freedom in the\nhadronic phase. The partonic ones are only accessible by the second model. It\nis found that the QCD matter has paramagnetic properties, which monotonically\ndepend on the temperature and are not affected by the hadron-quark\nphase-transition. Furthermore, raising the magnetic field strength increases\nthe thermodynamic quantities, especially in the hadronic phase but reduces the\ncritical temperature, i.e. inverse magnetic catalysis.\n", "  Povh and Walcher have written a paper entitled \"The end of the nucleon-spin\ncrisis\" [arXiv:1603.05884]. But there is no such crisis. What appeared to be a\nspin crisis in the parton model, 28 years ago, was a consequence of a\nmisinterpretation of the results of the famous European Muon Collaboration\nexperiment on polarized deep inelastic scattering. It would thus seem that Povh\nand Walcher have invoked a somewhat dubious argument based on hadronic\nfluctuations of the photon in order to resolve a non-existent problem.\n", "  Finding an efficient and compelling regularization of soft and collinear\ndegrees of freedom at the same invariant mass scale, but separated in rapidity\nis a persistent problem in high-energy factorization. In the course of a\ncalculation, one encounters divergences unregulated by dimensional\nregularization, often called rapidity divergences. Once regulated, a general\nframework exists for their renormalization, the rapidity renormalization group\n(RRG), leading to fully resummed calculations of transverse momentum (to the\njet axis) sensitive quantities. We examine how this regularization can be\nimplemented via a multi-differential factorization of the soft-collinear\nphase-space, leading to an (in principle) alternative non-perturbative\nregularization of rapidity divergences. As an example, we examine the\nfully-differential factorization of a color singlet's momentum spectrum in a\nhadron-hadron collision at threshold. We show how this factorization acts as a\nmother theory to both traditional threshold and transverse momentum\nresummation, recovering the classical results for both resummations. Examining\nthe refactorization of the transverse momentum beam functions in the threshold\nregion, we show that one can directly calculate the rapidity renormalized\nfunction, while shedding light on the structure of joint resummation. Finally,\nwe show how using modern bootstrap techniques, the transverse momentum spectrum\nis determined by an expansion about the threshold factorization, leading to a\nviable higher loop scheme for calculating the relevant anomalous dimensions for\nthe transverse momentum spectrum.\n", "  Based on a recent proposal for the gravitational entropy of free\ngravitational fields, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of black hole\nformation through gravitational collapse in the framework of the semitetrad\n1+1+2 covariant formalism. In the simplest case of an Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt\ncollapse we prove that the change in gravitational entropy outside a collapsing\nbody is related to the variation of the surface area of the body itself, even\nbefore the formation of horizons. As a result, we are able to relate the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole endstate to the variation of the\nvacuum gravitational entropy outside the collapsing body.\n", "  We consider the linear, time-independent fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation $$\n  (-\\Delta)^s \\psi+V\\psi=f. $$ We are interested in the local H\\\"older\nexponents of distributional solutions $\\psi$, assuming local $L^p$\nintegrability of the functions $V$ and $f$. By standard arguments, we obtain\nthe formula $2s-N/p$ for the local H\\\"older exponent of $\\psi$ where we take\nsome extra care regarding endpoint cases. For our main result, we assume that\n$V$ and $f$ (but not necessarily $\\psi$) are radial functions, a situation\nwhich is commonplace in applications. We find that the regularity theory\n\"becomes one-dimensional\" in the sense that the H\\\"older exponent improves from\n$2s-N/p$ to $2s-1/p$ away from the origin. Similar results hold for\n$\\nabla\\psi$ as well.\n", "  In this paper we consider the modeling of opinion dynamics over time\ndependent large scale networks. A kinetic description of the agents'\ndistribution over the evolving network is considered which combines an opinion\nupdate based on binary interactions between agents with a dynamic creation and\nremoval process of new connections. The number of connections of each agent\ninfluences the spreading of opinions in the network but also the way\nconnections are created is influenced by the agents' opinion. The evolution of\nthe network of connections is studied by showing that its asymptotic behavior\nis consistent both with Poisson distributions and truncated power-laws. In\norder to study the large time behavior of the opinion dynamics a mean field\ndescription is derived which allows to compute exact stationary solutions in\nsome simplified situations. Numerical methods which are capable to describe\ncorrectly the large time behavior of the system are also introduced and\ndiscussed. Finally, several numerical examples showing the influence of the\nagents' number of connections in the opinion dynamics are reported.\n", "  This paper presents a novel workflow for seismic net pay estimation with\nuncertainty. It is demonstrated on the Cassra/Iris Field. The theory for the\nstochastic wavelet derivation (which estimates the seismic noise level along\nwith the wavelet, time-to-depth mapping, and their uncertainties), the\nstochastic sparse spike inversion, and the net pay estimation (using secant\nareas) along with its uncertainty; will be outlined. This includes benchmarking\nof this methodology on a synthetic model. A critical part of this process is\nthe calibration of the secant areas. This is done in a two step process. First,\na preliminary calibration is done with the stochastic reflection response\nmodeling using rock physics relationships derived from the well logs. Second, a\nrefinement is made to the calibration to account for the encountered net pay at\nthe wells. Finally, a variogram structure is estimated from the extracted\nsecant area map, then used to build in the lateral correlation to the ensemble\nof net pay maps while matching the well results to within the nugget of the\nvariogram. These net pay maps are then integrated, over the area of full\nsaturation gas, to give the GIIP distribution (Gaussian distributions for the\nporosity, gas expansion factor, and gas saturation for the sand end member are\nassumed and incorporated in the estimate of GIIP). The method is demonstrated\non the Iris (UP5 turbidite) interval. The net pay is corrected for reduction in\nthe amplitudes over part of the area due to shallow gas. The sensitivity of the\nGIIP to the independent stochastic variables is estimated (determining the\nvalue of information) so that business decisions can be made that maximize the\nvalue of the field.\n", "  We investigate temperature smearing effects on the electron-boson spectral\ndensity function ($I^2\\chi(\\omega)$) obtained from optical data using a maximum\nentropy inversion method. We start with two simple model input\n$I^2\\chi(\\omega)$, calculate the optical scattering rates at selected\ntemperatures using the model input spectral density functions and a generalized\nAllen's formula, then extract back $I^2\\chi(\\omega)$ at each temperature from\nthe calculated optical scattering rate using the maximum entropy method (MEM)\nwhich has been used for analysis of optical data of high-temperature\nsuperconductors including cuprates, and finally compare the resulting\n$I^2\\chi(\\omega)$ with the input ones. From this approach we find that the\ninversion process can recover the input $I^2\\chi(\\omega)$ almost perfectly when\nthe quality of fits is good enough and also temperature smearing (or thermal\nbroadening) effects appear in the $I^2\\chi(\\omega)$ when the quality of fits is\nnot good enough. We found that the coupling constant and the logarithmically\naveraged frequency are robust to the temperature smearing effects and/or the\nquality of fits. We use these robust properties of the two quantities as\ncriterions to check whether experimental data have intrinsic\ntemperature-dependent evolutions or not. We carefully apply the MEM to two\nmaterial systems (one optimally doped and the other underdoped cuprates) and\nconclude that the $I^2\\chi(\\omega)$ extracted from the optical data contain\nintrinsic temperature-dependent evolutions.\n", "  Gravitation violates baryon number $B$: A star has a huge amount of it, while\na black hole forming from the star has none. Consider primordial black holes\nbefore the hadronic annihiliation in the early universe, encountering and\nabsorbing baryons and antibaryons: Each such absorption changes $B$ of the\nuniverse by one unit, up or down. But the absorption events are $uncorrelated$\n$and$ $random$, hence they amount to a random walk in $B$-space, leading to the\nexpectation of a net $|B|$ at the end.\n  While the scale of this effect is most uncertain, it must exist. We explore\nsome ramifications, including the change of net $|B|$ with expansion,\nconnection with universe topology, and possible observational signatures.\n", "  Given a conserved and traceless energy-momentum tensor and a conformal\nKilling vector, one obtains a conserved current. We generalise this\nconstruction to superconformal theories in three, four, five and six dimensions\nwith various amounts of supersymmetry by working in the appropriate\nsuperspaces.\n", "  Discovering communities in complex networks helps to understand the behaviour\nof the network. Some works in this promising research area exist, but\ncommunities uncovering in time-dependent and/or multiplex networks has not\ndeeply investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a communities detection\napproach for multislice networks based on modularity optimization. We first\npresent a method to reduce the network size that still preserves modularity.\nThen we introduce an algorithm that approximates modularity optimization (as\nusually adopted) for multislice networks, thus finding communities. The network\nsize reduction allows us to maintain acceptable performances without affecting\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n", "  The paper presents the results of SERS studies of the dynamic behavior of\n\"phenol-semiquinone-quinone\" system. This system is a key part of\nchemiluminescent sensors for reactive oxygen species. The dynamics of the\nsystem seems to be very important in the processes that determine the secondary\nmetabolism at the cellular level in molecular biology. THz Raman spectra were\nrecorded for the labile products formed in the processes initiated by proton\ntransfer. A mechanism of the proton-transfer-initiated reaction is proposed.\n", "  This is a review of explicit computations of Connes distance in\nnoncommutative geometry, covering finite dimensional spectral triples,\nalmost-commutative geometries, and spectral triples on the algebra of compact\noperators. Several applications to physics are covered, like the metric\ninterpretation of the Higgs field, and the comparison of Connes distance with\nthe minimal length that emerges in various models of quantum spacetime. Links\nwith other areas of mathematics are studied, in particular the horizontal\ndistance in sub-Riemannian geometry. The interpretation of Connes distance as a\nnoncommutative version of the Monge-Kantorovich metric in optimal transport is\nalso discussed.\n", "  The Ising double chain has been overlooked for more than 80 years, since one\nwas mostly interested in phase transitions. We consider two types of\ndegeneracy, spin occupation degeneracy and \"bond\" occupation degeneracy. We\nshow that bond occupation on \"open nets\" is of particular importance for the\nunderstanding of melting. The number of open nets on a double chain is\ndetermined analytically. If only one bond site of a net is occupied, this\nalready produces a definite number of bonds on sites, bonds that do not belong\nto the net. All nets on a given chain of length $n$ then yield a total number\n$i^{(n)}_{\\rm tot}$ of bonds, allowing to calculate a characteristic energy\n$u^{(n)}_{ch}$, an approximation of the critical energy $u_c$ of the infinite\ndouble chain. We finally present an explanation for the critical energy $u^{\\rm\nKG}_c$ of the kagom\\'e lattice in terms of the critical energies $u^{\\rm TR}_c$\nand $u^{\\rm HC}_c$ of the triangular and honeycomb lattices.\n", "  Superposition of explicit (analytic) monotone non-increasing shock waves for\nthe KdV-Burgers equation is studied, modelled numerically and graphically\npresented. Initial profile chosen as a sum of two such shock waves gradually\ntransforms into a single shock wave of a somewhat complex yet predictable\nstructure. This transformation is demonstrated in detail.\n", "  The study is about a basic shadow experiment, which was enriched with a\nsimulation to understand the reasoning of participants when we use a trick. Two\nlight sources create an umbra and penumbra behind the objects. With this\nexperiment, we asked what would happen when the penumbras interact. Most of the\nparticipants predicted the correct solution, that there should be an umbra.\nSome of the participants choose wrong alternative, and explained in terms of\nthe structure of penumbra.\n", "  Neptune has brightened by more than 10% during the past several decades. We\nreport on the analysis of published Johnson-Cousins B and V magnitudes dating\nback to 1954 along with new U, B, V, R, Rc, I and Ic photometry that we\nrecorded during the past 24 years. Characteristic magnitudes, colors and\nalbedos in all seven band-passes are derived from the ensemble of data.\nAdditionally, 25 spectra spanning 26 hours of observation on 5 nights are\nanalyzed. The spectrophotometry demonstrates that planetary flux and albedo is\ninversely related to the equivalent widths of methane bands. We attribute the\nchanges in band strength, flux and albedo to the high altitude clouds which\nrotate across the planet's visible disk. Bright clouds increase albedo and flux\nwhile reducing methane absorption. Synthetic V magnitudes derived from the\nspectroscopy also agree closely with the photometric quantities, which\ncross-validates the two techniques. The spectroscopic and photometric results\nare discussed within the framework of the secular brightness variations of\nNeptune.\n", "  Measurement of the coronal magnetic field is a crucial ingredient in\nunderstanding the nature of solar coronal dynamic phenomena at all scales. We\nemploy STEREO/COR1 data obtained near maximum of solar activity in December\n2012 (Carrington rotation, CR 2131) to retrieve and analyze the\nthree-dimensional (3D) coronal electron density in the range of heights from\n$1.5$ to $4\\ \\mathrm{R}_\\odot$ using a tomography method and qualitatively\ndeduce structures of the coronal magnetic field. The 3D electron density\nanalysis is complemented by the 3D STEREO/EUVI emissivity in 195 \\AA \\ band\nobtained by tomography for the same CR period. We find that the magnetic field\nconfiguration during CR 2131 has a tendency to become radially open at\nheliocentric distances below $\\sim 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{R}_\\odot$. We compared the\nreconstructed 3D coronal structures over the CR near the solar maximum to the\none at deep solar minimum. Results of our 3D density reconstruction will help\nto constrain solar coronal field models and test the accuracy of the magnetic\nfield approximations for coronal modeling.\n", "  We report the experimental evidence of the ac Josephson effect in a\ntransition edge sensor (TES) operating in a frequency domain multiplexer and\nbiased by ac voltage at MHz frequencies. The effect is observed by measuring\nthe non-linear impedance of the sensor. The TES is treated as a weakly linked\nsuperconducting system and within the resistively shunted junction model\nframework. We provide a full theoretical explanation of the results by finding\nthe analytic solution of the non-inertial Langevian equation of the system and\ncalculating the non-linear response of the detector to a large ac bias current\nin the presence of noise.\n", "  We are developing transition-edge sensor (TES)-based microcalorimeters for\nthe X-ray Integral Field Unit (XIFU) of the future European X-Ray Observatory\nAthena. The microcalorimeters are based on TiAu TESs coupled to 250{\\mu}m\nsquared, AuBi absorbers. We designed and fabricated devices with different\ncontact geometries between the absorber and the TES to optimise the detector\nperformance and with different wiring topology to mitigate the self-magnetic\nfield. The design is tailored to optimise the performance under Frequency\nDomain Multiplexing. In this paper we review the main design feature of the\npixels array and we report on the performance of the 18 channels, 2-5MHz\nfrequency domain multiplexer that will be used to characterised the detector\narray.\n", "  Applications of magnetic memory devices greatly benefit from ultra-fast,\nlow-power switching. Here we propose how this can be achieved efficiently in a\nnano-sized synthetic antiferromagnet by using perpendicular-to-the-plane\npicosecond-range magnetic field pulses. Our detailed micromagnetic simulations,\nsupported by analytical results, yield the parameter space where inertial\nswitching and relaxation-free switching can be achieved in the system. We\nfurthermore discuss the advantages of dynamic switching in synthetic\nantiferromagnets and, specifically, their relatively low-power switching as\ncompared to that in single ferromagnetic particles. Finally, we show how\nexcitation of spin-waves in the system can be used to significantly reduce the\npost-switching spin oscillations for practical device geometries.\n", "  The Sun is a magnetically active star and is the source of the solar wind,\nelectromagnetic radiation and energetic particles which affect the heliosphere\nand the Earths atmosphere. The magnetic field of the Sun is responsible for\nmost of the dynamic activity of the Sun. This thesis research seeks to\nunderstand solar magnetic field generation and the role that magnetic fields\nplay in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Specifically, this thesis focuses\non two themes: in the first part, we study the origin and behaviour of solar\nmagnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory and modelling, and in\nthe second part, utilizing observations and data analysis we study two major\nproblems in solar physics, namely, the coronal heating problem and initiation\nmechanisms of solar flares.\n", "  We show how to use properties of the quantum conditional mutual information\nto obtain continuity bounds for information characteristics of quantum channels\ndepending on their input dimension.\n  First we prove tight estimates for variation of the output Holevo quantity\nwith respect to simultaneous variations of a channel and of an input ensemble.\n  Then we obtain tight continuity bounds for output conditional mutual\ninformation for a single channel and for $n$ copies of a channel.\n  As a result tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for basic capacities\nof quantum channels depending on the input dimension are obtained. They\ncomplement the Leung-Smith continuity bounds depending on the output dimension.\n", "  Complex systems are composed of a large number of simple components connected\nto each other in the form of a network. It is shown that, for some network\nconfigurations, the equivalent dynamic behavior of the system is governed by an\nimplicit integro-differential operator even though the individual components\nthemselves satisfy equations that use explicit operators of integer order. The\nnetworks considered here are infinite trees and ladders, and each is composed\nonly of two types of integer-order components with potential-driven flows that\nare repeated ad infinitum. In special cases the equivalent operator for the\nsystem is a fractional-order derivative, but in general it is implicit and can\nonly be expressed as a solution of an operator equation. These implicit\noperators, which are a generalization of fractional-order derivatives, play an\nimportant role in the analysis and modeling of complex systems.\n", "  There is growing interest in promoting deformation twinning for plasticity in\nadvanced materials, as highly organized twin boundaries are beneficial to\nbetter strength-ductility combination in contrast to disordered grain\nboundaries. Twinning deformation typically involves the kinetics of stacking\nfaults, its interaction with dislocations, and dislocation - twin boundary\ninteractions. While the latter has been intensively investigated, the dynamics\nof stacking faults has been less known. In this work, we report several new\ninsights on the stacking fault behavior in twin induced plasticity from our\nmeta-atom molecular dynamics simulation: The stacking fault interactions are\ndominated by dislocation reactions taking place spontaneously, different from\nthe proposed mechanism in literatures; The competition among generating a\nsingle stacking fault, a twinning partial and a trailing partial dislocation is\ndependent on a unique parameter, i.e. stacking fault energy, which in turn\ndetermines deformation twinning behaviors. The complex twin-slip and\ntwin-dislocation interactions demonstrate the dual role of deformation twins as\nboth dislocation barrier and storage, potentially contributing to the high\nstrength and ductility of advanced materials like TWIP steels where deformation\ntwinning dominated plasticity accounts for the superb strength-ductility\ncombination.\n", "  We discuss the description of eigenspace of a quantum walk model $U$ with an\nassociating linear operator $T$ in abstract settings of quantum walk including\nthe Szegedy walk on graphs. In particular, we provide the spectral mapping\ntheorem of $U$ without the spectral decomposition of $T$. Arguments in this\ndirection reveal the eigenspaces of $U$ characterized by the generalized\nkernels of linear operators given by $T$.\n", "  We investigate the optical Kerr nonlinearities of an ensemble of cold Rydberg\natoms under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). By\nusing an approach beyond mean-field theory, we show that the system possesses\nnot only enhanced third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, but also giant\nfifth-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, which has a cubic dependence on\natomic density. Our results demonstrate that both the third-order and the\nfifth-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities consist of two parts,\ncontributed respectively by photon-atom interaction and Rydberg-Rydberg\ninteraction. The Kerr nonlinearity induced by the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction\nplays a leading role at high atomic density. We find that the fifth-order\nnonlinear optical susceptibility in the Rydberg-EIT system may be five orders\nof magnitude larger than that obtained in traditional EIT systems. The results\nobtained may have promising applications in light and quantum information\nprocessing and transmission at weak-light level.\n", "  Boron suboxide B6O, the hardest known oxide, has an R-3m crystal structure\n({\\alpha}-B6O) that can be described as an oxygen-intercalated structure of\n{\\alpha}-boron, or, equivalently, as a cubic close packing of B12 icosahedra\nwith two oxygen atoms occupying all octahedral voids in it. Here we show a new\nground state of this compound at ambient conditions, Cmcm-B6O (\\b{eta}-B6O),\nwhich in all quantum-mechanical treatments that we tested (GGA, LDA, and hybrid\nfunctional HSE06) comes out to be slightly but consistently more stable.\nIncreasing pressure and temperature further stabilize it with respect to the\nknown {\\alpha}-B6O structure. \\b{eta}-B6O also has a slightly higher hardness\nand may be synthesized using different experimental protocols. We suggest that\n\\b{eta}-B6O is present in mixture with {\\alpha}-B6O, and its presence accounts\nfor previously unexplained bands in the experimental Raman spectrum.\n", "  Antagonistic salts are composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions. In a\nmixture solvent (water-oil) such ion pairs are preferentially attracted to\nwater or oil, giving rise to a coupling between the charge density and the\ncomposition. First, they form a large electric double layer at a water-oil\ninterface, reducing the surface tension and producing mesophases. Here, the\ncations and anions are loosely bound by the Coulomb attraction across the\ninterface on the scale of the Debye screening length. Second, on solid\nsurfaces, hydrophilic (hydrophobic) ions are trapped in a water-rich (oil-rich)\nadsorption layer, while those of the other species are expelled from the layer.\nThis yields a solvation mechanism of local charge separation near a solid. In\nparticular, near the solvent criticality, disturbances around solid surfaces\ncan become oscillatory in space. In mesophases, we calculate periodic\nstructures, which resemble those in experiments.\n", "  The structure of stable magnetic solitons of various orders in soft magnetic\nnanotube with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy has been studied using numerical\nsimulation. Solitons of even order are immobile in axially applied magnetic\nfield. Odd solitons show decreased mobility with respect to that of head-to\nhead domain wall. Solitons of various orders can participate in nanotube\nmagnetization reversal process. Various coalescence and decomposition processes\nin soliton assembly are considered. It is shown that the general magnetization\nstate of magnetic nanotube consists of chains of magnetic solitons of various\norders.\n", "  In this study the detection of the oil spill using synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) imagery is considered. Detection of the oil spill is performed using\nchange detection algorithms between imagery acquired at different times. The\nspecific algorithms used are the correlation coefficient change statistic and\nthe intensity ratio change statistic algorithms. Therefore these algorithms and\nthe probabilistic selection of the threshold criteria is reviewed and\ndiscussed. A recently offered change detection method which depends on the idea\nof generating two different final change maps of two images in a sequence, is\nused. First final change map is obtained by cumulatively adding the sequences\nof change maps in such a manner that common change areas are excluded and\nuncommon change areas are included. The second final change map is obtained by\ncomparing the first and the last images in the temporal sequence. This method\nrequires at least three images to be employed and can be generalized to longer\ntemporal image sequences. The purpose of this approach is to provide a double\ncheck mechanism to the conventional approach and thus to reduce the probability\nof false alarm and enhance the change detection. The algorithms mentioned are\napplied to a 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill imagery together with the method\ndescribed. It is shown that intensity ratio change statistic is a better tool\nfor identification of the changes due to the oil spill compared to the\ncorrelation coefficient change statistic. It is also shown that two final\nchange map method can reduce the probability of false alarm. The data used in\nthis study is acquired by the Japanese Aerospace Agency's Advanced Land\nObserving Satellite (ALOS) through Alaska SAR Facility (ASF) at the University\nof Alaska, Fairbanks, AK.\n", "  Recent experimental data demonstrate emerging magnetic order in platinum\natomically thin nanowires. Furthermore, an unusual form of magnetic anisotropy\n-- colossal magnetic anisotropy (CMA) -- was earlier predicted to exist in\natomically thin platinum nanowires. Using spin dynamics simulations based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we here explore the spin dynamics of atomically\nthin platinum wires to reveal the spin relaxation signature of colossal\nmagnetic anisotropy, comparing it with other types of anisotropy such as\nuniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA). We find that the CMA alters the spin\nrelaxation process distinctly and, most importantly, causes a large speed-up of\nthe magnetic relaxation compared to uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The magnetic\nbehavior of the nanowire exhibiting CMA should be possible to identify\nexperimentally at the nanosecond time scale for temperatures below 5 K. This\ntime-scale is accessible in e.g., soft x-ray free electron laser experiments.\n", "  Shape and frequency-shift map of direct and indirect images of Keplerian\ndiscs orbiting in Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) black hole and no-horizon\nspacetimes are determined. Then profiles of spectral lines generated in the\ninnermost parts of the Keplerian discs in the Bardeen and ABG spacetimes are\nconstructed. The frequency-shift maps and profiled spectral lines are compared\nto those generated in the field of Schwarzschild black holes and possible\nobservationally relevant signatures of the regular black hole and no-horizon\nspacetimes are discussed. We demonstrate that differences relative to the\nSchwarzschild spacetimes are for the no-horizon spacetimes much more profound\nin comparison to the regular black hole spacetimes and increase with increasing\ncharge parameter of the spacetime. The differences are stronger for small and\nlarge inclination angles than for mediate ones. For the no-horizon spacetimes,\nthe differences enable to distinguish the Bardeen and ABG spacetime, if\ninclination angle to the distant observer is known. We also show that\ncontribution of the so called ghost images to the profiled lines increases with\nincreasing charge parameter of the spacetimes.\n", "  Models with an extended scalar sector may in principle provide new sources of\nCP violation originating in the scalar potential. One of the simplest ways to\nimplement this idea is to have CP violation in a two-Higgs-doublet model. Here,\nit leads to CP violation in trilinear weak gauge boson couplings. We discuss\nhow these couplings are becoming constrained in the alignment limit. In a model\nwith three Higgs doublets, subject to an $S_3$ symmetry, several complex vacua\nare possible. Some of these, but not all, may lead to spontaneous CP violation.\n", "  NiCo2O4 of varying nanostrucutures ranging from nanowires, nanoplates to\nnano-plates@nanowires were successfully grown on microporous (MP) Ni foams via\none-step hydrothermal process. The investigation of electrochemical capacitance\nfavors Ni-Co2O4 of nanoplates@nanowires microstructures which possesses\nspecific capacitance of 1380.3 F/g and 1033F/g at 5A/g and 50A/g respectively\nand 86.7% capacitance re-tention after 5000 cycles at 30A/g. The relationship\nbetween morphology and specific capacitance was further explored by the model\nof surface roughness factor (RF), which is indicative of the active\nelectrode-electrolyte interface areas. The RF of porous Ni@NiCo2O4 was\nremarkably improved by employing hierarchically porous (HP) Ni monoliths as\nsubstrates, which illustrates the model of high energy density (12.6 F/cm2)\nelectrodes for super-capacitors.\n", "  We have performed an analytical study of quantum-classical equivalence for\nquantum $XY$-spin chains with arbitrary interactions to explore the classical\ncounterpart of the factorizing magnetic fields that drive the system into a\nseparable ground state. We demonstrate that the factorizing line in parameter\nspace of a quantum model is equivalent to the so-called natural boundary that\nemerges in mapping the quantum $XY$-model onto the two dimensional classical\nIsing model. As a result, we show that the quantum systems with the\nnon-factorizable ground state could not be mapped onto the classical Ising\nmodel. Based on the presented correspondence we suggest a promising method for\nobtaining the factorizing field of quantum systems through the commutation of\nthe quantum Hamiltonian and the transfer matrix of the classical model.\n", "  In the present paper it is considered space time manifold with four\ncommutative coordinates with Poinc\\'are group of motion but different from\nPoinc\\'are Minkowski space time of the modern physics.\n", "  Atomically thin MoS2/graphene heterostructures are promising candidates for\nnanoelectronic and optoelectronic technologies. Among different graphene\nsubstrates, epitaxial graphene (EG) on SiC provides several potential\nadvantages for such heterostructures including high electronic quality, tunable\nsubstrate coupling, wafer-scale processability, and crystalline ordering that\ncan template commensurate growth. Exploiting these attributes, we demonstrate\nhere the thickness-controlled van der Waals epitaxial growth of MoS2 on EG via\nchemical vapor deposition, giving rise to transfer-free synthesis of a\ntwo-dimensional heterostructure with registry between its constituent\nmaterials. The rotational commensurability observed between the MoS2 and EG is\ndriven by the energetically favorable alignment of their respective lattices\nand results in nearly strain-free MoS2, as evidenced by synchrotron X-ray\nscattering and atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The\nelectronic nature of the MoS2/EG heterostructure is elucidated with STM and\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy, which reveals bias-dependent apparent\nthickness, band bending, and a reduced bandgap of ~0.4 eV at the monolayer MoS2\nedges.\n", "  It has been recently demonstrated that superconducting transition edge\nsensors (TESs) behave as weak-links due to longitudinally induced\nsuperconductivity from the leads with higher Tc. In this work we study the\nimplication of this behaviour for TES-based bolometers and microcalorimeter\nunder ac bias. The TESs are read-out at frequencies between 1 and 5 MHz by a\nFrequency Domain Multiplexer based on a linearised two-stage SQUID amplifier\nand high- Q lithographically made superconducting LC resonators. In particular,\nwe focus on SRON TiAu TES bolometers with a measured dark Noise Equivalent\nPower (NEP) of $3.2 \\cdot 10^{-19} W/Hz^{1/2}$ developed for the short\nwavelength band for the instrument SAFARI on the SPICA telescope.\n", "  With reduced degrees of freedom, structural defects are expected to play a\ngreater role in two-dimensional materials in comparison to their bulk\ncounterparts. In particular, mechanical strength, electronic properties, and\nchemical reactivity are strongly affected by crystal imperfections in the\natomically thin limit. Here, ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) are employed to interrogate point and\nline defects in monolayer MoS2 grown on epitaxial graphene (EG) at the atomic\nscale. Five types of point defects are observed with the majority species\nshowing apparent structures that are consistent with vacancy and interstitial\nmodels. The total defect density is observed to be lower than MoS2 grown on\nother substrates, and is likely attributed to the van der Waals epitaxy of MoS2\non EG. Grain boundaries (GBs) with 30{\\deg} and 60{\\deg} tilt angles resulting\nfrom the rotational commensurability of MoS2 on EG are more easily resolved by\nSTM than atomic force microscopy at similar scales due to the enhanced contrast\nfrom their distinct electronic states. For example, band gap reduction to ~0.8\neV and ~0.5 eV is observed with STS for 30{\\deg} and 60{\\deg} GBs,\nrespectively. In addition, atomic resolution STM images of these GBs are found\nto agree well with proposed structure models. This work offers quantitative\ninsight into the structure and properties of common defects in MoS2, and\nsuggests pathways for tailoring the performance of MoS2/graphene\nheterostructures via defect engineering.\n", "  We perform a detailed numerical study of the conductance $G$ through\none-dimensional (1D) tight-binding wires with on-site disorder. The random\nconfigurations of the on-site energies $\\epsilon$ of the tight-binding\nHamiltonian are characterized by long-tailed distributions: For large\n$\\epsilon$, $P(\\epsilon)\\sim 1/\\epsilon^{1+\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\\in(0,2)$. Our\nmodel serves as a generalization of 1D Lloyd's model, which corresponds to\n$\\alpha=1$. First, we verify that the ensemble average $\\left\\langle -\\ln\nG\\right\\rangle$ is proportional to the length of the wire $L$ for all values of\n$\\alpha$, providing the localization length $\\xi$ from $\\left\\langle-\\ln\nG\\right\\rangle=2L/\\xi$. Then, we show that the probability distribution\nfunction $P(G)$ is fully determined by the exponent $\\alpha$ and\n$\\left\\langle-\\ln G\\right\\rangle$. In contrast to 1D wires with standard\nwhite-noise disorder, our wire model exhibits bimodal distributions of the\nconductance with peaks at $G=0$ and $1$. In addition, we show that $P(\\ln G)$\nis proportional to $G^\\beta$, for $G\\to 0$, with $\\beta\\le\\alpha/2$, in\nagreement to previous studies.\n", "  Academic research is driven by several factors causing different disciplines\nto act as \"sources\" or \"sinks\" of knowledge. However, how the flow of authors'\nresearch interests -- a proxy of human knowledge -- evolved across time is\nstill poorly understood. Here, we build a comprehensive map of such flows\nacross one century, revealing fundamental periods in the raise of interest in\nareas of human knowledge. We identify and quantify the most attractive topics\nover time, when a relatively significant number of researchers moved from their\noriginal area to another one, causing what we call a \"diaspora of the\nknowledge\" towards sinks of scientific interest, and we relate these points to\ncrucial historical and political events. Noticeably, only a few areas -- like\nMedicine, Physics or Chemistry -- mainly act as sources of the diaspora,\nwhereas areas like Material Science, Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience,\nImmunology and Microbiology or Environmental Science behave like sinks.\n", "  We investigated the magnetization and crystal structure of FeSe\npolycrystalline samples with various grain sizes. For the samples with large\ngrains, a large magnetic critical current density Jc was observed. For the\nsamples with small grains, superconductivity signals were not observed;\ninstead, magnetization hysteresis, which is not a result of superconductivity,\nwas observed. In the X-ray diffraction pattern for the samples with small\ngrains, broad additional peaks were observed, corresponding to the formation of\nthe non-superconducting (monoclinic) Fe-Se phase at the FeSe grain surface. The\ncrystal structure instability at the grain surface would be the reason for the\nlow superconducting properties of the Fe-chalcogenide polycrystalline wires\ninvestigated thus far.\n", "  We derive a Markovian master equation for the single-electron density matrix,\napplicable to quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). The equation conserves the\npositivity of the density matrix, includes off-diagonal elements (coherences)\nas well as in-plane dynamics, and accounts for electron scattering with phonons\nand impurities. We use the model to simulate a terahertz-frequency QCL, and\ncompare the results with both experiment and simulation via nonequilibrium\nGreen's functions (NEGF). We obtain very good agreement with both experiment\nand NEGF when the QCL is biased for optimal lasing. For the considered device,\nwe show that the magnitude of coherences can be a significant fraction of the\ndiagonal matrix elements, which demonstrates their importance when describing\nTHz QCLs. We show that the in-plane energy distribution can deviate far from a\nheated Maxwellian distribution, which suggests that the assumption of\nthermalized subbands in simplified density-matrix models is inadequate. We also\nshow that the current density and subband occupations relax towards their\nsteady-state values on very different time scales.\n", "  We proposed a distributed approximating functional method for efficiently\ndescribing the electronic dynamics in atoms and molecules in the presence of\nthe Coulomb singularities, using the kernel of a grid representation derived by\nusing the solutions of the Coulomb differential equation based upon the\nSchwartz's interpolation formula, and a grid representation using the\nLobatto/Radau shape functions. The elements of the resulted Hamiltonian matrix\nare confined in a narrow diagonal band, which is similar to that using the\n(higher order) finite difference methods. However, the spectral convergence\nproperties of the original grid representations are retained in the proposed\ndistributed approximating functional method for solving the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation involving the Coulomb singularity. Thus the method is effective for\nsolving the electronic Schr\\\"odinger equation using iterative methods where the\naction of the Hamiltonian matrix on the wave function need to evaluate many\ntimes. The method is investigated by examining its convergence behaviours for\ncalculating the electronic states of the H atom, H$_2^+$ molecule, the H atom\nin a parallel magnetic and electric fields, as the radial basis functions.\n", "  Bethe-Salpeter equation is applied to $p$-$n$ elastic scattering. The spin\nobservables are calculated by the M matrix similar to $p$-$p$ case. The\nparameters of the meson-exchange model are used with the cut-off for the pion\nexchange interaction. Change of the M matrix indicates breaking of the charge\nindependence in the nucleon-nucleon system.\n", "  The formalism of the continuum random-phase approximation theory which\ntreats, without ap- proximations, the continuum part of the single-particle\nspectrum, is extended to describe charge- exchange excitations. Our approach is\nself-consistent, meaning that we use a unique, finite-range, interaction in the\nHartree-Fock calculations which generate the single-particle basis and in the\ncon- tinuum random-phase approximation which describes the excitation. We study\nexcitations induced by the Fermi, Gamow-Teller and spin-dipole operators in\ndoubly magic nuclei by using four Gogny- like finite-range interactions, two of\nthem containing tensor forces. We focus our attention on the importance of the\ncorrect treatment of the continuum configuration space and on the effects of\nthe tensor terms of the force.1\n", "  We examine electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in an ensemble of\ncold $\\Lambda-$type atoms induced by a quantum control field in multi-mode\ncoherent states and compare it with the transparency created by the classical\nlight of the same intensity. We show that the perfect coincidence is achieved\nonly in the case of a single-mode coherent state, whereas the transparency\nsharply decreases, when the number of the modes exceeds the mean number of\ncontrol photons in the medium. The origin of the effect is the modification of\nphoton statistics in the control field with increasing the number of the modes\nthat weakens its interaction with atoms resulting in a strong probe absorption.\nFor the same reason, the probe pulse transforms from EIT-based slow-light into\nsuperluminal propagation caused by the absorption.\n", "  In this article we study the interaction between an impurity and the gas of\nBogoliubov excitations of a Fermi superfluid by mapping it on the polaron\nproblem for an impurity in a BEC. The description of the Fermi superfluid\nacross the BEC-BCS crossover regime is based on a recently developed effective\nfield theory presented in [Eur. Phys. J. B 88, 122 (2015)] and provides us with\nthe interaction-dependent dispersion relations for the Bogoliubov excitations.\nThe behavior of the polaronic coupling constant $\\alpha$ and of the effective\nmass of the polaron is examined in a broad window of the BEC-BCS crossover.\n", "  We show that not feeling the boundary estimates for heat kernels hold for any\nnon-negative self-adjoint extension of the Laplace operator acting on\nvector-valued compactly supported functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. They\nare therefore valid for any choice of boundary condition and we show that the\nimplied constants can be chosen independent of the self-adjoint extension. The\nmethod of proof is very general and is based on finite propagation speed\nestimates and explicit Fourier Tauberian theorems obtained by Y. Safarov.\n", "  Methanol and water vapour masers are signposts of early stages of high-mass\nstar formation but it is generally thought that due to different excitation\nprocesses they probe distinct parts of stellar environments. Here we present\nobservations of the intermediate-mass young stellar object G107.298+5.639,\nrevealing for the first time that 34.4 d flares of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser\nemission alternate with flares of individual features of the 22 GHz water\nmaser. High angular resolution data reveal that a few components of both maser\nspecies showing periodic behaviour coincide in position and velocity and all\nthe periodic water maser components appear in the methanol maser region of size\nof 360 au. The maser flares could be caused by variations in the infrared\nradiation field induced by cyclic accretion instabilities in a circumstellar or\nprotobinary disc. The observations do not support either the stellar pulsations\nor the seed photon flux variations as the underlying mechanisms of the\nperiodicity in the source.\n", "  A solar eruptive event SOL2010-06-13 observed with SDO/AIA has been discussed\nin the contexts of the CME gebesis and an associated EUV transient in terms of\na shock driven by the apparent CME rim. We have revealed in this event an\nerupting flux rope, studied its properties, and detected wave signatures inside\nthe developing CME. These findings have allowed us to establish new features in\nthe genesis of the CME and associated EUV wave and to reconcile all of the\nepisodes into a causally-related sequence. (1) A hot 11 MK flux rope developed\nfrom a compact filament, accelerated up to 3 km/s$^2$ 1 min before a hard X-ray\nburst and earlier than other structures, reached 420 km/s, and decelerated to\n50 km/s. (2) The CME development was driven by the flux rope. Closed structures\nabove the rope got sequentially involved in the expansion from below upwards,\ncame closer together, and disappeared to reveal their envelope, the rim, which\nbecame the outer boundary of the cavity. The rim was associated with the\nseparatrix surface of a magnetic domain, which contained the pre-eruptive\nfilament. (3) The rim formation was associated with a successive compression of\nthe upper active-region structures into the CME frontal structure (FS). When\nthe rim was formed, it resembled a piston. (4) The disturbance responsible for\nthe CME formation was excited by the flux rope inside the rim, and then\npropagated outward. EUV structures at different heights started to accelerate,\nwhen their trajectories in the distance-time diagram were crossed by the front\nof this disturbance. (5) Outside the rim and FS, the disturbance propagated\nlike a blast wave, manifesting in a type II radio burst and a leading part of\nthe EUV transient. Its main, trailing part was the FS, which consisted of\nswept-up 2 MK loops enveloping the rim. The wave decelerated and decayed soon,\nbeing not driven by the trailing piston, which slowed down.\n", "  The structure and the medium effects exerted on the spectral characteristics\nof the carbonyl group stretching vibrations in some structural fragments of\npoly-3-hydroxybutyrate have been analyzed. Calculations of the equilibrium\nconfigurations and IR spectra were carried out using the Gaussian program set\nin the approximation B3LYP/cc-pVDZ. It has been shown that typical bending of\nthe poly-3-hydroxybutyrate chain is observed with an increase in the number of\nstructural units. In order to explain the difference between the calculated and\nexperimental frequencies of the C=O group stretching vibrations, the\ncalculations of the potential energy curve associated with variations in the\nlength of C=O bond and the subsequent numerical solution of a one-dimensional\nvibrational Schr\\\"odinger equation have been performed. The medium effects have\nbeen taken into account within the scope of a polarizable continuum model.\nOwing to the inclusion of the above-mentioned factors, which affect frequencies\nof the carbonyl groups stretching vibrations, correlation between the\ntheoretical and experimental results has been improved significantly.\n", "  In this work, quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Schwarzschild black hole are\ninvestigated by taking into account the quantum fluctuations. Gravitational and\nDirac perturbations were considered for this case. The Regge-Wheeler gauge and\nthe Dirac equation were used to derive the perturbation equations of the\ngravitational and Dirac fields respectively and the third order\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation method is used for the computing\nof the quasinormal frequencies. The results show that due to the quantum\nfluctuations in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, the QNMs of the\nblack hole damp more slowly when increasing the quantum correction factor (a),\nand oscillate more slowly.\n", "  Electrical control of oxygen off-stoichiometry of transition-metal oxides at\nroom temperature is a desired strategy to simultaneously switch the electrical\nconductance and magnetism of the device. Although the use of the\nelectrochemical redox reaction of transition-metal oxides is the most\nreasonable way to achieve the aforementioned switch, such a device has not been\nrealized because of the lack of a leakage-free liquid electrolyte. Here, we\ndemonstrate an electromagnetic device that can reversibly switch a\ntransition-metal oxide from an insulator/non-magnet to a metal/magnet (Tc=275\nK) using a newly developed 'leakage-free electrolyte', incorporated in an\namorphous NaTaO3 nanopillar array film. Reversible switching occurs\nelectrically, obeying Faraday's laws of electrolysis, under a DC voltage of\n+(-)3 V within 2-3 s at RT. The present electromagnetic device does not have\nthe drawback of liquid leakage, and the leakage-free electrolyte provides a\nnovel design concept for practical electromagnetic devices using\ntransition-metal oxides.\n", "  We have investigated scintillation light distribution in BaF$_{2}$ and pure\nCsI crystals with dimensions 3x3x20 cm$^{3}$ using the Geant4 toolkit. The\ndiffuse wrapping material is selected as coating for the crystals. The\nsimulated cosmic muons and 105 MeV electrons are used as beam particles. The\noptical attenuation along the crystals is explored with the simulation data. We\nhave demonstrated the impact of the crystal surface finish on the light\ndistribution at the crystal end, optical photon arrival time, incidence angle\ndistributions, and optical attenuation for the studied crystals.\n", "  In this work we examine the possibility to describe yrast positive- and\nnegative-parity excitations of deformed even-even nuclei through a collective\nrotation model in which the nuclear surface is characterized by triaxial\nquadrupole and octupole deformations. The nuclear moments of inertia are\nexpressed as sums of quadrupole and octupole parts. By assuming an adiabatic\nseparation of rotation and vibration degrees of freedom we suppose that the\nstructure of the positive- and negative- parity bands may be determined by the\ntriaxial-rigid-rotor motion of the nucleus. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in\na symmetrized rotor basis with embedded parity we obtain a model description\nfor the yrast positive- and negative-parity bands in several actinide nuclei.\nWe show that the energy displacement between the opposite-parity sequences can\nbe explained as the result of the quadrupole-octupole triaxiality.\n", "  In this essay, we recall the specificities of the transition to turbulence in\nwall-bounded flows and present recent achievements in the understanding of this\nproblem. The transition is abrupt with laminar-turbulent coexistence over a\nfinite range of Reynolds numbers, the transitional range. The archetypical\ncases of Poiseuille pipe flow and plane Couette flow are first reviewed at the\nphenomenological level, together with a few other flow configurations.\nTheoretical approaches are then examined with particular emphasis on the\nexistence of special nontrivial solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations at\nfinite distance from laminar flow. Dynamical systems theory is most appropriate\nto analyze their role, in particular with respect to the transient character of\nturbulence in the lower transitional range. The extensions needed to deal with\nthe prominent spatiotemporal features of the transition are then discussed.\nTurbulence growth/decay in terms of statistical physics of many-body systems\nand the relevance of directed percolation as a stochastic process able to\naccount for it are next scrutinized. To conclude, we advocate the recourse to\nwell-designed modeling able to provide us with a conceptually coherent picture\nof the full transitional range and put forward some open issues.\n", "  In recent years the controlled coupling of single photon emitters to\npropagating surface plasmons has been intensely studied, which is fueled by the\nprospect of a giant photonic non-linearity on a nano-scaled platform. In this\narticle we will review the recent progress on coupling single emitters to\nnano-wires towards the construction of a new platform for strong light-matter\ninteraction. The control over such a platform might open new doors for quantum\ninformation processing and quantum sensing at the nanoscale, and for the study\nof fundamental physics in the ultra-strong coupling regime.\n", "  Mixed state can be used in dense coding. We have analyzed here that maximally\nentangled mixed states like Werner state is dense codeable for a certain range\nof state parameter whereas for some wider range of the state parameter the\nstate is $`$steerable' but cannot be used in dense coding. For qutrit system we\nconsider isotropic states and have found similar characteristics, like the\nstates are $`$steerable' for a range of state parameter but for a sub range of\nthat steerability range only, the states are dense-codeable.\n", "  Classical sliding friction is dominated by the slip-stick mechanism, where\ncontacts between two bodies are alternately formed and sheared as the bodies\nmove past each other. When the interface between two bodies is perfectly\nsmooth, classical friction goes to zero, a state called superlubricity. In this\nlimit, much weaker mechanisms, called quantum friction are predicted. These\nmechanisms are based on an exchange of elementary excitations between two\nbodies moving relatively to each other. For the friction to be called quantum,\nthe excitations must arise from the quantum mechanical description of the\nbodies. Photons and phonons are such excitations. Friction results from an\nirreversible momentum transfer from these excitations to the bodies, affecting\ntheir motion. We measured the friction force between crystallites of solid 4He\nmoving relative to each other at low temperatures. Our data are in excellent\nagreement with the concept of quantum phonon friction.\n", "  Brilliantov et al. (PNAS, 2015) propose a model for the size distribution\n~R^-3 for small particles with radius R and ~exp(-(R/Rc)^3) for large\nparticles, where Rc=5.5 m. In 1989 Longaretti found analytically ~R^-3 for\nsmall particles and R^-6 for large ones (2). The law R^-6 also describes\nmoonlets with size ~ 0.1-1 km. Cut-off law from Brilliantov et al. model does\nnot describe moonlets and requires new mechanism for the origin of ~ 1 km size\nbodies. This model does not take into account the key effects of\nself-gravitation of large particles and differential rotation of the rings.\nLongaretti used a more accurate model of destruction of particles: \"A relative\nincrease of the erosion/destruction rate of the large particles must take\nplace, because these particles have relative velocities of collision larger\nthan the dispersion velocity, due to the differential Keplerian motion\". The\nnew model does not explain the difference between the rings and the satellites\nand the authors suggest that their calculations are applicable to the rings of\nthe Chariklo and Chiron. In fact, the Chariklo rings are not examples of\nplanetary rings, but proto-satellite disks. Simplified physical model that does\nnot describe moonlets and the outer boundary of the rings makes the new model\nnot a step forward but a step backwards in comparison with the papers of 20-30\nyears old.\n", "  Near-infrared (2.5-5.0$\\,\\mu$m) low-resolution\n($\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda{\\sim}100$) spectra of 72 Galactic planetary nebulae\n(PNe) were obtained with the Infrared Camera (IRC) in the post-helium phase.\nThe IRC, equipped with a $1'{\\times}1'$ window for spectroscopy of a point\nsource, was capable of obtaining near-infrared spectra in a slit-less mode\nwithout any flux loss due to a slit. The spectra show emission features\nincluding hydrogen recombination lines and the 3.3-3.5$\\,\\mu$m hydrocarbon\nfeatures. The intensity and equivalent width of the emission features were\nmeasured by spectral fitting. We made a catalog providing unique information on\nthe investigation of the near-infrared emission of PNe. In this paper, details\nof the observations and characteristics of the catalog are described.\n", "  Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) generates samples from a prescribed probability\ndistribution in a configuration space by simulating Hamiltonian dynamics,\nfollowed by the Metropolis (-Hastings) acceptance/rejection step. Compressible\nHMC (CHMC) generalizes HMC to a situation in which the dynamics is reversible\nbut not necessarily Hamiltonian. This article presents a framework to further\nextend the algorithm. Within the existing framework, each trajectory of the\ndynamics must be integrated for the same amount of (random) time to generate a\nvalid Metropolis proposal. Our generalized acceptance/rejection mechanism\nallows a more deliberate choice of the integration time for each trajectory.\nThe proposed algorithm in particular enables an effective application of\nvariable step size integrators to HMC-type sampling algorithms based on\nreversible dynamics. The potential of our framework is further demonstrated by\nanother extension of HMC which reduces the wasted computations due to unstable\nnumerical approximations and corresponding rejected proposals.\n", "  Magnetic response is a fundamental property of superconducting materials,\nwhich helps to distinguish two superconductivity types: the ideally diamagnetic\ntype I and type II, which can develop the mixed state with Abrikosov vortices.\nWe demonstrate that multi-band superconductors with one shallow band, that have\nrecently attracted much attention for their high critical temperatures and\nunusual properties, often stay apart of this simple classification. In a wide\nrange of microscopic parameters such systems fall into the inter-type or\ntransitional interval in between the standard types and display unconventional\nmixed state configurations.\n", "  In this talk I discuss recent developments in moduli stabilisation, SUSY\nbreaking and chiral D-brane models together with several interesting features\nof cosmological models built in the framework of type IIB string\ncompactifications. I show that a non-trivial pre-inflationary dynamics can give\nrise to a power loss at large angular scales for which there have been mounting\nobservational hints from both WMAP and Planck. I then describe different\nstringy embeddings of inflationary models which yield large or small tensor\nmodes. I finally argue that reheating is generically driven by the decay of the\nlightest modulus which can produce, together with Standard Model particles,\nalso non-thermal dark matter and light hidden sector degrees of freedom that\nbehave as dark radiation.\n", "  An optical characterization tool of Raman spectroscopy with extremely weak\nscattering cross section tool is not popular to analyze scattered signal from a\nsingle nanostructure in the sub-diffraction regime. In this regard, plasmonic\nassisted characterization tools are only relevant in spectroscopic studies of\nnanoscale object in the sub-diffraction limit. We have reported polarized\nresonance Raman spectroscopic (RRS) studies with strong electron-phonon\ncoupling to understand the crystalline orientation of a single AlGaN nanowire\nof diameter about 100 nm. AlGaN nanowire is grown by chemical vapor deposition\ntechnique using the catalyst assisted vapor-liquid-solid process. The results\nare compared with the high resolution transmission electron microscopic\nanalysis. As a matter of fact, optical confinement effect due to the dielectric\ncontrast of nanowire with respect to that of surrounding media assisted with\nelectron-phonon coupling of RRS are useful for the spectroscopic analysis in\nthe sub-diffraction limit of 325 nm (lamda(2N.A.)^(-1)) using an excitation\nwavelength (lamda) of 325 nm and near ultraviolet 40X far field objective with\na numerical aperture (N.A.) value of 0.50.\n", "  For the International Large Detector concept at the planned International\nLinear Collider, the use of time projection chambers (TPC) with micro-pattern\ngas detector readout as the main tracking detector is investigated. In this\npaper, results from a prototype TPC, placed in a 1 T solenoidal field and read\nout with three independent GEM-based readout modules, are reported. The TPC was\nexposed to a 6 GeV electron beam at the DESY II synchrotron. The efficiency for\nreconstructing hits, the measurement of the drift velocity, the space point\nresolution and the control of field inhomogeneities are presented.\n", "  Collective and directed motility or swarming is an emergent phenomenon\ndisplayed by many self-organized assemblies of active biological matter such as\nclusters of embryonic cells during tissue development, cancerous cells during\ntumor formation and metastasis, colonies of bacteria in a biofilm, or even\nflocks of birds and schools of fish at the macro-scale. Such clusters typically\nencounter very heterogeneous environments. What happens when a cluster\nencounters an interface between two different environments has implications for\nits function and fate. Here we study this problem by using a mathematical model\nof a cluster that treats it as a single cohesive unit that moves in two\ndimensions by exerting a force/torque per unit area whose magnitude depends on\nthe nature of the local environment. We find that low speed (overdamped)\nclusters encountering an interface with a moderate difference in properties can\nlead to refraction or even total internal reflection of the cluster. For large\nspeeds (underdamped), where inertia dominates, the clusters show more complex\nbehaviors crossing the interface multiple times and deviating from the\npredictable refraction and reflection for the low velocity clusters. We then\npresent an extreme limit of the model in the absense of rotational damping\nwhere clusters can become stuck spiraling along the interface or move in large\ncircular trajectories after leaving the interface. Our results show a wide\nrange of behaviors that occur when collectively moving active biological matter\nmoves across interfaces and these insights can be used to control motion by\npatterning environments.\n", "  Dust scattering is the main source of diffuse emission in the far-ultraviolet\n(FUV). For several locations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite has observed diffuse\nradiation in the FUV with intensities ranging from 1000 - 3 X 10^5 photon units\nand diffuse fraction between 5% - 20% at 1100 {\\deg}A. Here, we compare the FUV\ndiffuse emission with the mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) diffuse\nemission observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the AKARI satellite for\nthe same locations. The intensity ratios in the different MIR and FIR bands for\neach of the locations will enable us to determine the type of dust contributing\nto the diffuse emission as well as to derive a more accurate 3D distribution of\nstars and dust in the region, which in turn may be used to model the observed\nscattering in the FUV. In this work we present the infrared (IR) data for two\ndifferent regions in LMC, namely N11 and 30 Doradus. We also present the FUV~IR\ncorrelation for different infrared bands.\n", "  Copper (Cu), gold (Au) (111) crystals were illuminated with 120 fs pulses and\nprobed by 600 fs X-ray pulses. Rocking curves were measured versus 267 nm (UV)\npump- 0.154 nm probe delay time. Curve width broadening, peak diffracted\nintensity and angular shift were recorded for the range of UV excitation\nintensities of 2-8 mJ/cm2 . Observed oscillations in time delay dependences of\nshift, width and of peak intensity of rocking curves are correlated, as\ndescribed by acoustic pulse bouncing between crystal surfaces. In (111) Au,\nacoustic pulse originates from pump absorption layer, and peak intensity drops\nby a factor of two (at delay time at which sonic wave reaches Au-substrate\nboundary) of its initial value prior to absorption of laser pulse. In Cu,\ncorrelated rocking curves dynamics is also observed, however buildup of rocking\ncurve broadening is faster than one can expect from sonic wavepacket\noriginating in pump absorption layer. This effect is attributed to acoustic\nphonon generation outside of pump absorption layer, it is much stronger in Cu\nthan in Au. Phonon generation in Cu is distributed throughout the whole bulk of\ncrystal due to delocalization of mobile hot electrons diffusing from pump\nabsorption layer.\n", "  Advances in science are being sought in newly available opportunities to\ncollect massive quantities of data about complex systems. While key advances\nare being made in detailed mapping of systems, how to relate this data to\nsolving many of the challenges facing humanity is unclear. The questions we\noften wish to address require identifying the impact of interventions on the\nsystem and that impact is not apparent in the detailed data that is available.\nHere we review key concepts and motivate a general framework for building\nlarger scale views of complex systems and for characterizing the importance of\ninformation in physical, biological and social systems. We provide examples of\nits application to evolutionary biology with relevance to ecology,\nbiodiversity, pandemics, and human lifespan, and in the context of social\nsystems with relevance to ethnic violence, global food prices, and stock market\npanic. Framing scientific inquiry as an effort to determine what is important\nand unimportant is a means for advancing our understanding and addressing many\npractical concerns, such as economic development or treating disease.\n", "  We discover a new mechanism of electronic population inversion using strong\nfemtosecond pulses, where the transfer is mediated by vibrational motion on a\nlight-induced potential. The process can be achieved with a single pulse tuning\nits frequency to the red of the Franck-Condon window. We show the determinant\nrole that the sign of the slope of the transition dipole moment can play on the\ndynamics, and extend the method to multiphoton processes with odd number of\npulses. As an example, we show how the scheme can be applied to population\ninversion in Na2.\n", "  By means of the examples of classical and Bohmian quantum mechanics, we\nillustrate the well-known ideas of Boltzmann as to how one gets from laws\ndefined for the universe as a whole to dynamical relations describing the\nevolution of subsystems. We explain how probabilities enter into this process,\nwhat quantum and classical probabilities have in common and where exactly their\ndifference lies.\n", "  The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of orbital angular momentum operator on\nnoncommutative lattice for a circle poset by theta-quantization are\nconstructed, and it is demonstrated that they are equivalent to those of the\nconventional quantum mechanics.\n", "  The radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz is tightly correlated with the far-infrared\nluminosities for various galaxy types (e.g. [16, 6, 2]) over a wide range of\nredshift (see e.g. [5, 1, 15, 8, 7]). The relationship is widely believed to be\ndriven by the internal star formation activity. Radio emission from these\ngalaxies are predominantly produced from the synchrotron emission of cosmic-ray\nelectrons accelerated in supernova shocks. The infrared emission is due to\nultraviolet light from young massive stars that is absorbed and re-radiated by\ndust [3]. A correlation is found also in local clusters but cluster galaxies\nappears to have excess radio emission relative to the amount of far-infrared\nemission [9, 13, 11]. In this work, we measure the far-infrared-radio\nrelationship in a massive cluster to test how this relationship changes at\nintermediate z between the field and a high-density cluster environment.\n", "  Non-linear oscillator networks have revealed properties as the remote\nsynchronization and the quorum sensing. The remote synchronization, defined as\nthe synchronization of nodes not directly connected by any sequence of\nsynchronized nodes, was found firstly in networks of amplitude oscillators and\nrecently in bipartite delayed networks of phase oscillators. The quorum\nsensing, a biological information scheme discovered in cell aggregates, has\nbeen investigated in amplitude oscillators coupled by a common medium.\nImplications of such findings are important in technology and biology. We show\nboth of them in non-bipartite, biologically plausible networks of Kuramoto\noscillators. The quorum sensing emerges using the graph edge density, while the\nremote synchronization is obtained by means of an oscillator acting as a\npacemaker. In the remote synchronization two distinct groups of well inter and\ninfra-synchronized nodes, separated by non-synchronized paths, appear clearly.\nOur biological interpretation is that the remote synchronization, bypassing the\nnormal quorum sensing mechanism, is responsible of the pathological cell\nproliferation. This approach seems suitable to study the quorum sensing\nalterations due to genetic mutation or to the environmental action before the\nactual mass replication begins.\n", "  Due to concerns about environmental and industrial hazards of lead, a number\nof military, law enforcement, and wildlife management agencies are giving\ncareful consideration to lead-free ammunition. The goal of lead-free bullets is\nto gain the advantages of reduced lead use in the environment while maintaining\nequal or better terminal performance. Accepting reduced terminal performance\nwould foolishly risk the lives of military and law enforcement personnel. This\npaper uses the established technique of studying bullet impacts in ballistic\ngelatin to characterize the terminal performance of eight commercial off-the-\nshelf lead-free handgun bullets for comparison with earlier analysis of\njacketed lead bullets. Peak retarding force and energy deposit in calibrated\nballistic gelatin are quantified using high speed video. The temporary stretch\ncavities and permanent wound cavities are also characterized. Two factors tend\nto reduce the terminal performance of these lead-free projectiles compared to\nsimilar jacketed lead designs. First, solid copper construction increase barrel\nfriction, which reduces muzzle velocity and energy, and thus reduces the\nability of the bullet to exert damaging forces in tissue simulant. Second, the\nlower density of copper requires a longer bullet for a given mass and caliber,\nwhich reduces remaining powder volume in the brass cartridge case, which also\ntends to reduce muzzle velocity and energy. The results of the present study\nare consistent with earlier analysis showing that expansion is necessary to\nmaximize the potential for rapid incapacitation of enemy combatants. In spite\nof some new non-expanding nose designs that moderately increase forces between\nbullet and tissue, the largest retarding forces and highest incapacitation\npotential requires expanding bullets which maximize frontal area.\n", "  Building on previous work, we explore the parameter space of general free\nfunctions in non-relativistic modified gravity theories motivated by k-essence\nand other scalar-tensor theories. Using a few proposed tests, we aim to update\nSolar System based constraints on these ideas in line with previous theories\nand suggest their utility in constraining modification to GR, potentially even\nbeing able to test k-essence type theories.\n", "  The Omega-preprocessing was introduced to improve phase noise rejection by\nusing a least square algorithm. The associated variance is the PVAR which is\nmore efficient than MVAR to separate the different noise types. However, unlike\nAVAR and MVAR, the decimation of PVAR estimates for multi-tau analysis is not\npossible if each counter measurement is a single scalar. This paper gives a\ndecimation rule based on two scalars, the processing blocks, for each\nmeasurement. For the Omega-preprocessing, this implies the definition of an\noutput standard as well as hardware requirements for performing high-speed\ncomputations of the blocks.\n", "  We report two-dimensional quantum transport and Dirac fermions in YbMnBi2\nsingle crystals. YbMnBi2 is a layered material with anisotropic conductivity\nand magnetic order below 290 K. Magnetotransport properties, nonzero Berry\nphase and small cyclotron mass indicate the presence of quasi two dimensional\nDirac fermions. Quantum oscillations in Hall resistivity suggest the presence\nof both electron and hole parts of the Fermi surface whereas the Berry phase\nsuggests spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Inflation in the early Universe is a grand phase transition which have\nproduced the seeds of all the structures we now observe. We focus on the\nnon-equilibrium aspect of this phase transition especially the inevitable\ninfrared (IR) divergence associated to the the quantum and classical fields\nduring the inflation. There is a long history of research for removing this IR\ndivergence for healthy perturbation calculations. On the other hand, the same\nIR divergence is quite relevant and have developed the primordial density\nfluctuations in the early Universe. We develop a unified formalism in which the\nIR divergence is clearly separated from the microscopic quantum field theory\nbut only appear in the statistical classical structure. We derive the classical\nLangevin equation for the order parameter within the quantum field theory\nthrough the instability of the de Sitter vacuum during the inflation. This\nseparation process is relevant in general to develop macroscopic structures and\nto derive the basic properties of statistical mechanics in the quantum field\ntheory.\n", "  How can quantum mechanics be (i) the fundamental theoretical framework of\ncontemporary physics and (ii) a probability calculus that presupposes the\nevents to which, and on the basis of which, it assigns probabilities? The\nquestion is answered without invoking knowledge or observers, by interpreting\nthe necessary distinction between two kinds of physical quantities -\nunconditionally definite quantities and quantities that have values only if\nthey are measured - as a distinction between the manifested world and its\nmanifestation.\n", "  We study a global nuclear structure in the framework of experimental\nobservables. With the aid of large nuclear structure data at the national\nnuclear data center, NNDC, we present the distinctive systematic patterns\nemerged in the first 2+ excited energies, E(2+) and their energy ratios to the\nfirst 4+ levels, R = E(4+)/E(2+), in the even-even nuclei, over 50 < Z < 82 for\nprotons, and 50 < N < 126 for neutrons. We introduce the so-called pseudo-shell\nconfigurations from the subshells mixture in order to explain a semi-double\nshell closure, a shape phase transition, and a reinforced deformation. It is\nfound that the reinforced deformation arises when Z = 64 or 66 correlates with\nN = 90 and reaches its maximum, indicating R = 3.3. Such a saturated reinforced\ndeformation spans over Z = 58 to 72 and N = 100 to 106 as showing its center at\nZ = 64 or 66 and at N = 102 or 104. We define this reinforced deformation 'a\nferro-deformation' like a ferro-magnetism in condensed matter physics. The\nshape coexistence would be expected to occur, such as a ferro-deformation, with\na strong rotational mode, and a near spherical shape, with a vibrational mode,\nat the critical points of Z = 64 or 66, with N = 88 and 90; 150Sm and 152Sm,\n152Gd and 154Gd, and 154Dy and 156Dy. We suggest that a super-deformation,\nwhich can be formed at high-lying excited states in a moderate deformed\nnucleus, would correspond to the ferro-deformation at N = 88 for the nuclei;\nSm, Gd, and Dy. We argue that the ferro-deformation can be closely associated\nwith a strong spin-orbital interaction between neutrons and protons in the\nspin-orbit doublet, h9/2-h11/2, leading to the critical points at Z, N = 64,\n104.\n", "  We develop tools for performing effective field theory (EFT) calculations in\na manifestly gauge-covariant fashion. We clarify how functional methods account\nfor one-loop diagrams resulting from the exchange of both heavy and light\nfields, as some confusion has recently arisen in the literature. To efficiently\nevaluate functional traces containing these \"mixed\" one-loop terms, we develop\na new covariant derivative expansion (CDE) technique that is capable of\nevaluating a much wider class of traces than previous methods. The technique is\ndetailed in an appendix, so that it can be read independently from the rest of\nthis work. We review the well-known matching procedure to one-loop order with\nfunctional methods. What we add to this story is showing how to isolate\none-loop terms coming from diagrams involving only heavy propagators from\ndiagrams with mixed heavy and light propagators. This is done using a non-local\neffective action, which physically connects to the notion of \"integrating out\"\nheavy fields. Lastly, we show how to use a CDE to do running analyses in EFTs,\n\\textit{i.e.} to obtain the anomalous dimension matrix. We demonstrate the\nmethodologies by several explicit example calculations.\n", "  The nature of the progenitors of SNe Ia is not yet fully understood. In the\nsingle-degenerate (SD) scenario, the collision of the SN ejecta with its\ncompanion star is expected to produce detectable UV emission in the first few\ndays after the SN explosion within certain viewing angles. It was recently\nfound that the $B-V$ colour of the nearby SN Ia SN 2012cg at about sixteen days\nbefore the maximum $B$-band brightness was about 0.2 mag bluer than those of\nother normal SNe Ia, which was reported as the first evidence for excess blue\nlight from the interaction of normal SN Ia ejecta with its companion star. In\nthis work, we compare current observations for SN 2012cg from its pre-explosion\nphase to the late-time nebular phase with theoretical predictions from binary\nevolution and population synthesis calculations for a variety of popular\nprogenitor scenarios. We find that a main-sequence donor or a carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf donor binary system is more likely to be the progenitor of SN\n2012cg. However, both scenarios also predict properties which are in\ncontradiction to the observed features of this system. Taking both theoretical\nand observational uncertainties into account, we suggest that it might be too\nearly to conclude that SN 2012cg was produced from an explosion of a\nChandrasekhar-mass white dwarf in the SD scenario. Future observations and\nimproved detailed theoretical modelling are still required to place a more\nstringent constraint on the progenitor of SN 2012cg.\n", "  Frequency combs based on terahertz quantum cascade lasers feature broadband\ncoverage and high output powers in a compact package, making them an attractive\noption for broadband spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate the first\nmulti-heterodyne spectroscopy using two terahertz quantum cascade laser combs.\nWith just 100 $\\mu$s of integration time, we achieve peak signal-to-noise\nratios exceeding 60 dB and a spectral coverage greater than 250 GHz centered at\n2.8 THz. Even with room-temperature detectors we are able to achieve peak\nsignal-to-noise ratios of 50 dB, and as a proof-of-principle we use these combs\nto measure the broadband transmission spectrum of etalon samples. Finally, we\nshow that with proper signal processing, it is possible to extend the\nmulti-heterodyne spectroscopy to quantum cascade laser combs operating in\npulsed mode, greatly expanding the range of quantum cascade lasers that could\nbe suitable for these techniques.\n", "  The gravitational interaction is expected to be modified for very short\ndistances. This is particularly important in situations in which the curvature\nof spacetime is large in general, such as close to the initial cosmological\nsingularity. The gravitational dynamics is then captured by the higher\ncurvature terms in the action, making it difficult to reliably extrapolate any\nprediction of general relativity. In this note we review pure Lovelock\nequations for Kasner-type metrics. These equations correspond to a single $N$th\norder Lovelock term in the action in $d=2N+1,\\,2N+2$ dimensions, and they\ncapture the relevant gravitational dynamics when aproaching the big-bang\nsingularity within the Lovelock family of theories. These are classified in\nseveral isotropy types. Some of these families correspond to degenerate classes\nof solutions, such that their dynamics is not completely determined by the\nequations of pure Lovelock gravity. Instead, these Kasner solutions become\nsensitive to the subleading terms in the Lovelock series.\n", "  For calculation of the single-channel nucleon-nucleon scattering a\nphase-functions method has been proposed. Using a phase-functions method the\nfollowing phase shifts of a np- scattering numerically for 1S0-, 1P1-, 3P0-,\n3P1-, 1D2-, 3D2-, 1F3-, 3F3-, 1G4-, 3G4- states are calculated. The\ncalculations has been performed using realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials\nArgonne group (Av18, Av14sscc, Av8', Av8'sscc, Av6', Av4', Av2'). Obtained\nphase shifts are in good agreement with the results obtained in the framework\nof other methods. Using the obtained phase shifts we have calculated the full\ncross-section np- scattering.\n", "  Glasses produced via physical vapor deposition can display greater kinetic\nstability and lower enthalpy than glasses prepared by liquid cooling. While the\nreduced enthalpy has often been used as a measure of the stability, it is not\nobvious whether dynamic measures of stability provide the same view. Here, we\nstudy dynamics in vapor-deposited and liquid-cooled glass films using molecular\nsimulations of a bead-spring polymer model as well as a Lennard-Jones binary\nmixture in two and three dimensions. We confirm that the dynamics in\nvapor-deposited glasses is indeed slower than in ordinary glasses. We further\nshow that the inherent structure energy is a good reporter of local dynamics,\nand that aged systems and glasses prepared by cooling at progressively slower\nrates exhibit the same behavior as vapor-deposited materials when they both\nhave the same inherent structure energy. These findings suggest that the\nstability inferred from measurements of the energy is also manifested in\ndynamic observables, and they strengthen the view that vapor deposition\nprocesses provide an effective strategy for creation of stable glasses.\n", "  The direct detection of reflected light from exoplanets is an excellent probe\nfor the characterization of their atmospheres. The greatest challenge for this\ntask is the low planet-to-star flux ratio, which even in the most favourable\ncase is of the order of $10^{-4}$ in the optical. This ratio decreases even\nmore for planets in their host habitable zone, typically lower than $10^{-7}$.\nTo reach the signal-to-noise level required for such detections, we propose to\nunleash the power of the Cross Correlation Function in combination with the\ncollecting power of next generation observing facilities. The technique we\npropose has already yielded positive results by detecting the reflected\nspectral signature of 51 Pegasi b (see Martins et al. 2015). In this work, we\nattempted to infer the number of hours required for the detection of several\nplanets in their host habitable zone using the aforementioned technique from\ntheoretical EELT observations. Our results show that for 5 of the selected\nplanets it should be possible to directly recover their reflected spectral\nsignature.\n", "  The current state of the art in direct water splitting in\nphoto-electrochemical cells (PECs) is presented together with: (i) a case study\nof water splitting using a simple solar cell with the most efficient water\nsplitting electrodes and (ii) a detailed mechanism analysis. Detailed analysis\nof the energy balance and efficiency of solar hydrogen production are\npresented. The role of hydrogen peroxide formation as an intermediate in oxygen\nevolution reaction is newly revealed and explains why an oxygen evolution is\nnot taking place at the thermodynamically expected 1.23 V potential.\n  Solar hydrogen production with electrical-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency\nof 52% is demonstrated using a simple ~0.7%-efficient n-Si/Ni Schottky solar\ncell connected to a water electrolysis cell. This case study shows that\nseparation of the processes of solar harvesting and electrolysis avoids\nphoto-electrode corrosion and utilizes optimal electrodes for hydrogen and\noxygen evolution reactions and achieves ~10% efficiency in light-to-hydrogen\nconversion with a standard 18% efficient household roof Si-solar cells.\n", "  The time evolution of protons and $^3$He fragments from Au+Au/Pb+Pb reactions\nat 0.25, 2, and 20 GeV$/$nucleon is investigated with the potential version of\nthe Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model combined with\nthe traditional coalescence afterburner. In the coalescence process, the\nrelative distance $R_0$ and relative momentum $P_0$ are surveyed in the range\nof 3-4 fm and 0.25-0.35 GeV$/$c, respectively. For both clusters, a strong\nreversed correlation between $R_0$ and $P_0$ is seen and it is time-dependent\nas well. For protons, the accepted ($R_0$, $P_0$) bands lie in the time\ninterval 30-60 fm$/$c, while for $^3$He, a longer time evolution (at about\n60-90 fm$/$c) is needed. Otherwise, much smaller $R_0$ and $P_0$ values should\nbe chosen. If we further look at the rapidity distributions from both central\nand semi-central collisions, it is found that the accepted [$t_{\\rm cut}, (R_0,\nP_0$)] assemble can provide consistent results for proton yield and collective\nflows especially at mid-rapdities, while for $^3$He, the consistency is\ndestroyed at both middle and projectile-target rapidities.\n", "  We prove for generalisations of quasi-homogeneous $n$-body problems with\ncenter of mass zero and $n$-body problems in spaces of negative constant\nGaussian curvature that if the masses and rotation are fixed, there exists, for\nevery order of the masses, at most one equivalence class of relative equilibria\nfor which the point masses lie on a circle, as well as that there exists, for\nevery order of the masses, at most one equivalence class of relative equilibria\nfor which all but one of the point masses lie on a circle and rotate around the\nremaining point mass. The method of proof is a generalised version of a proof\nby J.M. Cors, G.R. Hall and G.E. Roberts on the uniqueness of co-circular\ncentral configurations for power-law potentials.\n", "  The fairness of a secure multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) protocol\nrequires that all involved parties are entirely peer entities and can equally\ninfluence the outcome of the protocol to establish a shared key wherein no one\ncan decide the shared key alone. However, it is found that parts of the\nexisting MQKA protocols are sensitive to collusion attacks, i.e., some of the\ndishonest participants can collaborate to predetermine the final key without\nbeing detected. In this paper, a multi-party QKA protocol resisting collusion\nattacks is proposed. Different from previous QKA protocol resisting $N-1$\ncoconspirators or resisting $1$ coconspirators, we investigate the general\ncircle-type MQKA protocol which can be secure against $t$ dishonest\nparticipants' cooperation. Here, $t < N$. We hope the results of the presented\npaper will be helpful for further research on fair MQKA protocols.\n", "  We report on experimental verification of the rotational sense and type of\nhomogeneous chiral spin spiral order in a Mn monolayer on a W(110) substrate\nusing spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that the magnetic\ncontrast due to the spin spiral order almost vanishes with a magnetic tip\nmagnetized normal to the (001) plane, indicating that the spin spiral rotates\nin the plane. From a shift in the most-contrasted sites by changing the tip\nmagnetization direction within the rotating plane, we reveal that the\nrotational sense is left-handed, consistent with the previous results predicted\nby first-principle calculations. By comparing the current system with a chiral\nmagnetic domain wall in Fe double layers on the same substrate, we found that\nthe polarity of the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, the driving force of\nthose chiral magnets, is dominantly determined by the choice of the substrate\nrather than the overlayer.\n", "  We present an extensive numerical study of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model\nin transverse field. Recent numerical studies of quantum spin-glasses have\nfocused on exact diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian for small systems\n($\\approx$ 20 spins). However, such exact numerical treatments are difficult to\napply on larger systems. We propose making an approximation by using only a\nsubspace of the full Hilbert space spanned by low-lying excitations consisting\nof one-spin flipped and two-spin flipped states. The approximation procedure is\ncarried out within the theoretical framework of Hartree-Fock approximation and\nConfiguration Interaction. Although not exact, our approach allows us to study\nlarger system sizes comparable to that achievable by state of the art Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. We calculate two quantities of interest due to recent\nadvances in quantum annealing, the ground-state energy and the energy gap\nbetween the ground and first excited state. For the energy gap, we derive a\nnovel formula that enables it to be calculated using just the ground-state\nwavefunction, thereby circumventing the need to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. We\ncalculate the scalings of the energy gap and the leading correction to the\nextensive part of the ground-state energy with system size, which are difficult\nto obtain with current methods.\n", "  In some extensions of the Standard Model, Yukawa couplings of the physical\nHiggs boson can be deviated from those in the Standard Model. We study a\npossibility whether or not such anomalous Yukawa couplings are consistent with\nthe LHC Run 1 data. It is found that sizable deviations of top and bottom (and\ntau) Yukawa couplings from the Standard Model predictions can nicely fit the\ndata. New physics beyond the Standard Model can be revealed through more\nprecise measurements of such anomalous Yukawa couplings at the LHC Run 2 in the\nnear future. We also discuss a simple setup which can leads to anomalous Yukawa\ncouplings.\n", "  In this paper we study the dynamics of the trapped region using a frame\nindependent semi-tetrad covariant formalism for general Locally Rotationally\nSymmetric (LRS) class II spacetimes. We covariantly prove some important\ngeometrical results for the apparent horizon, and state the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a singularity to be locally naked. These conditions\nbring out, for the first time in a quantitative and transparent manner, the\nimportance of the Weyl curvature in deforming and delaying the trapped region\nduring continual gravitational collapse, making the central singularity locally\nvisible.\n", "  Ferri-/ferromagnetic exchange coupled composites are promising candidates for\nbit patterned media because of the ability to control the magnetic properties\nof the ferrimagnet by its composition. A micromagnetic model for the bilayer\nsystem is presented where we also incorporate the microstructural features of\nboth layers. Micromagnetic finite element simulations are performed to\ninvestigate the magnetization reversal behaviour of such media. By adding the\nexchange coupled ferrimagnet to the ferromagnet, the switching field could be\nreduced by up to $40\\,\\%$ and also the switching field distribution is\nnarrowed. To reach these significant improvements, an interface exchange\ncoupling strength of $2\\,\\mathrm{mJ/m^2}$ is required.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of high energy multiparticle production and discuss\nhow the space-time picture of inelastic interaction may reveal itself in\nidentical particles Bose-Einstein correlations.\n", "  Aims: We present a new updated study of the unique quintuple system of two\neclipsing binaries, V994 Her. Methods: Based on new obtained photometric\nobservations, we analysed the period variations of the two eclipsing pairs of\nV994 Her. Results: We found that the orbital period of the two eclipsing\nbinaries around a common barycenter is about 2.9 yrs instead of the original\nperiod, which was reported as 6.3 yrs. Moreover, the system now seems to be\nclose to coplanar (i ~ 84deg), and we also revised the individual masses of all\nfour eclipsing components. The two eclipsing pairs show slow apsidal motion\nwith periods of about 116 and 111 yrs, respectively. Pairs A and B are distant\nby about 17 mas on the sky, which is encouraging for observers because an\ninterferometric detection may be possible in the next years. Conclusions: All\nof these results are based on the photometric observations of V994 Her and its\ndetailed analysis of the period changes of the two eclipsing binaries.\n", "  Using the residual symmetry approach, we propose a complex extension of the\nscaling ansatz on $M_\\nu$ which allows a nonzero mass for each of the three\nlight neutrinos as well as a nonvanishing $\\theta_{13}$. Leptonic Dirac CP\nviolation must be maximal while atmospheric neutrino mixing need not to be\nexactly maximal. Each of the two Majorana phases, to be probed by the search\nfor $0\\nu \\beta\\beta$ decay, has to be zero or $\\pi$ and a normal neutrino mass\nhierarchy is allowed.\n", "  We study a model problem describing vibrational resonance by means of a\nhigh-order averaging technique based on so-called word series. With the tech-\nnique applied here, the tasks of constructing the averaged system and the\nassoci- ated change of variables are divided into two parts. It is first\nnecessary to build recursively a set of so-called word basis functions and,\nafter that, all the required manipulations involve only scalar coefficients\nthat are computed by means of sim- ple recursions. As distinct from the\nsituation with other approaches, with word- series, high-order averaged systems\nmay be derived without having to compute the associated change of variables. In\nthe system considered here, the construction of high-order averaged systems\nmakes it possible to obtain very precise approxima- tions to the true dynamics.\n", "  We study a random Schroedinger operator, the Laplacian with random Dirac\ndelta potentials on a torus T^d_L = R^d/LZ^d, in the thermodynamic limit\nL\\to\\infty, for dimension d=2. The potentials are located on a randomly\ndistorted lattice Z^2+\\omega, where the displacements are i.i.d. random\nvariables sampled from a compactly supported probability density. We prove\nthat, if the disorder is sufficiently weak, there exists a certain energy\nthreshold E_0>0 above which exponential localization of the eigenfunctions must\nbreak down. In fact we can rule out any decay faster than a certain polynomial\none. Our results are obtained by translating the problem of the distribution of\neigenfunctions of the random Schroedinger operator into a study of the spatial\ndistribution of two point correlation densities of certain random\nsuperpositions of Green's functions and its relation with a lattice point\nproblem.\n", "  In this work we extend previous analyses of linguistic networks by adopting a\nmulti-layer network framework for modelling the human mental lexicon, i.e. an\nabstract mental repository where words and concepts are stored together with\ntheir linguistic patterns. Across a three-layer linguistic multiplex, we model\nEnglish words as nodes and connect them according to (i) phonological\nsimilarities, (ii) synonym relationships and (iii) free word associations. Our\nmain aim is to exploit this multi-layered structure to explore the influence of\nphonological and semantic relationships on lexicon assembly over time. We\npropose a model of lexicon growth which is driven by the phonological layer:\nwords are suggested according to different orderings of insertion (e.g. shorter\nword length, highest frequency, semantic multiplex features) and accepted or\nrejected subject to constraints. We then measure times of network assembly and\ncompare these to empirical data about the age of acquisition of words. In\nagreement with empirical studies in psycholinguistics, our results provide\nquantitative evidence for the hypothesis that word acquisition is driven by\nfeatures at multiple levels of organisation within language.\n", "  Manufacturing of aluminum alloy based casting composite materials via stir\ncasting is one of the prominent and economical route for development and\nprocessing of metal matrix composites materials. Properties of these materials\ndepend upon many processing parameters and selection of matrix and\nreinforcements. Literature reveals that most of the researchers are using 2, 6\nand 7xxx aluminum matrix reinforced with SiC particles for high strength\nproperties whereas, insufficient information is available on reinforcement of\n\"Al2O3\" particles in 7xxx aluminum matrix. The 7xxx series aluminum matrix\nusually contains Cu-Zn-Mg. Therefore, the present research was conducted to\ninvestigate the effect of elemental metal such as Cu-Zn-Mg in aluminum matrix\non mechanical properties of stir casting of aluminum composite materials\nreinforced with alpha \"Al2O3\" particles using simple foundry melting alloying\nand casting route. The age hardening treatments were also applied to study the\naging response of the aluminum matrix on strength, ductility and hardness. The\nexperimental results indicate that aluminum matrix cast composite can be\nmanufactured via conventional foundry method giving very good responses to the\nstrength and ductility up to 10% \"Al2O3\" particles reinforced in aluminum\nmatrix.\n", "  We investigate optimal control of dynamical systems which are affine, i.e.,\nlinear in control, but nonlinear in state. The control task is to enforce the\nsystem state to follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible,\na task also known as optimal trajectory tracking. To obtain well-behaved\nsolutions to optimal control, a regularization term with coefficient\n$\\varepsilon$ must be included in the cost functional. Assuming $\\varepsilon$\nto be small, we reinterpret affine optimal control problems as singularly\nperturbed differential equations. Performing a singular perturbation expansion,\napproximations for the optimal tracking of arbitrary desired trajectories are\nderived. For $\\varepsilon=0$, the state trajectory may become discontinuous,\nand the control may diverge. On the other hand, the analytical treatment\nbecomes exact. We identify the conditions leading to linear evolution\nequations. These result in exact analytical solutions for an entire class of\nnonlinear trajectory tracking problems. The class comprises, among others,\nmechanical control systems in one spatial dimension and the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel with a control acting on the activator.\n", "  The high-precision HERA data allows searches up to TeV scales for Beyond the\nStandard Model contributions to electron-quark scattering. Combined\nmeasurements of the inclusive deep inelastic cross sections in neutral and\ncharged current $ep$ scattering corresponding to a luminosity of around 1\nfb$^{-1}$ have been used in this analysis. A new approach to the beyond the\nStandard Model analysis of the inclusive $ep$ data is presented; simultaneous\nfits of parton distribution functions together with contributions of \"new\nphysics\" processes were performed. Results are presented considering a finite\nradius of quarks within the quark form-factor model. The resulting 95% C.L.\nupper limit on the effective quark radius is $0.43\\cdot 10^{-16}$ cm.\n", "  We prove sharpness of the phase transition for the random-cluster model with\n$q \\geq 1$ on graphs of the form $\\mathcal{S} := \\mathcal{G} \\times S$, where\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is a planar lattice with mild symmetry assumptions, and $S$ a\nfinite graph. That is, for any such graph and any $q \\geq 1$, there exists some\nparameter $p_c = p_c(\\mathcal{S}, q)$, below which the model exhibits\nexponential decay and above which there exists a.s. an infinite cluster. The\nresult is also valid for the random-cluster model on planar graphs with long\nrange, compactly supported interaction. It extends to the Potts model via the\nEdwards-Sokal coupling.\n", "  We present a simple phenomenological method for detrending of raw Kepler and\nMOST photometry, which is illustrated by means of photometric data processing\nof two periodically variable chemically peculiar stars, KIC 6950556 and HD\n37633. In principle, this method may be applied to any type of periodically\nvariable objects and satellite or ground based photometries. As a by product,\nwe have identified KIC 6950556 as a magnetic chemically peculiar star with an\nACV type variability.\n", "  The present work introduces an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for continuum\npercolation composed of randomly-oriented rectangles. By conducting extensive\nsimulations, we report high precision percolation thresholds for a variety of\nhomogeneous systems with different rectangle aspect ratios. This work verifies\nand extends the excluded area theory. It is confirmed that percolation\nthresholds are dominated by the average excluded areas for both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous rectangle systems (except for some special heterogeneous systems\nwhere the rectangle lengths differ too much from one another). In terms of the\nexcluded areas, generalized formulae are proposed to effectively predict\nprecise percolation thresholds for all these rectangle systems. This work is\ntherefore helpful for both practical applications and theoretical studies\nconcerning relevant systems.\n  The Erratum addresses errors in our earlier paper \"Percolation thresholds of\ntwo-dimensional continuum systems of rectangles\" published in [Phys. Rev. E 88,\n012101 (2013)].\n", "  Multi-wavelength transit and secondary-eclipse light-curve observations are\nsome of the most powerful techniques to probe the thermo-chemical properties of\nexoplanets. Although the large planet-to-star brightness contrast and few\navailable spectral bands produce data with low signal-to-noise ratios, a\nBayesian approach can robustly reveal what constraints we can set, without\nover-interpreting the data. Here I performed an end-to-end analysis of\ntransiting exoplanet data. I analyzed space-telescope data for three planets to\ncharacterize their atmospheres and refine their orbits, investigated correlated\nnoise estimators, and contributed to the development of the respective\ndata-analysis pipelines. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the Photometry for Orbits,\nEclipses and Transits (POET) pipeline to model Spitzer Space Telescope light\ncurves, applied to secondary-eclipse observations of the Jupiter-sized planets\nWASP-8b and TrES-1. Chapter 4 studies commonly used correlated-noise estimators\nfor exoplanet light-curve modeling, time averaging, residual permutations, and\nwavelet likelihood, and assesses their applicability and limitations to\nestimate parameters uncertainties. Chapter 5 describes the open-source Bayesian\nAtmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART) code to characterize exoplanet\natmospheres. BART combines a thermochemical-equilibrium code, a one-dimensional\nline-by-line radiative-transfer code, and the Multi-core Markov-chain Monte\nCarlo statistical module to constrains the atmospheric temperature and\nchemical-abundance profiles of exoplanets. I applied the BART code to the\nHubble and Spitzer Space Telescope transit observations of the Neptune-sized\nplanet HAT-P-11b. BART finds an atmosphere enhanced in heavy elements,\nconstraining the water abundance to ~100 times that of the solar abundance.\n", "  Since governments give stimulus to firms and expect the spillover effect by\nfiscal policies, it is important to know the effectiveness that they can\ncontrol the economy. To clarify the controllability of the economy, we\ninvestigate a firm production network observed exhaustively in Japan and what\nfirms should be directly or indirectly controlled by using control theory. By\ncontrol theory, we can classify firms into three different types: (a) firms\nthat should be directly controlled; (b) firms that should be indirectly\ncontrolled; (c) neither of them (ordinary). Since there is a direction\n(supplier and client) in the production network, we can consider controls of\ntwo different directions: demand and supply sides. As analyses results, we\nobtain the following results: (1) Each industry has diverse share of firms that\nshould be controlled directly or indirectly. The configurations of the shares\nin industries are different between demand- and supply-sides; (2) Advancement\nof industries, such like, primary industries or other advanced industries, does\nnot show apparent difference in controllability; (3) If we clip a network in\ndescending order of capital size, we do not lose the control effect for both\ndemand- and supply-sides.\n", "  We want to study the perturbation growth of an initial seed of an ellipsoidal\nshape in Top-Hat collapse model of structure formation in the Modified\nChaplygin gas cosmology. Considering reasonable values of the constants and the\nparameters of the model under study, it is shown that a very small deviation\nfrom spherical symmetry (ellipsoidal geometry) in the initial seed leads to a\nfinal highly non-spherical structure which can be considered as a candidate for\njustifying already known cosmological structures as cosmic walls and filaments.\n", "  Earlier de Sabbata and Gasperini have shown that neutrinos oscillation which\ngives them a mass can be induced by torsion. More recently Enqvist et al have\nshown that it is possible to use massive neutrinos BBN magnetic fields to seed\ngalactic magnetic fields. Thus based on these previous investigations we\npresent several examples of how obtaining cosmological magnetic seed fields as\ngalactic magnetic fields from massive neutrino densities and also from the\ntorsion obtained by Nitsch as $T\\approx{10^{-24}s^{-1}}$ at the present day\nwhich yields magnetic seed field of the order of $B_{seed}\\approx{10^{-12}G}$.\nIn the case we use torsion derived from massive neutrinos given by\n$T_{\\nu}\\approx{10^{-26}s^{-1}}$ one obtains in BBN time $t\\approx{1s}$ with\nthe primordial nucleosynthesis magnetic field given by\n$B_{BBN}\\approx{10^{11}G}$ a relic magnetic field $B_{c}\\approx{10^{39}G}$\nwhich shows that the result obtained by Enqvist et al for the cosmological\nfields at the early universe. Galactic dynamo seed could be obtained from\nneutrinos at recombination. It is also shown that in the approximation of weak\nfields torsion can slow down the decay of magnetic fields which confirms\nprevious results. At Planck era where the time is $t\\sim{10^{-43}s}$ and\n$B_{Pl}\\sim{10^{58}G}$ the use of formula with the strongest torsion\n$10^{-19}G$this yields $B_{seed}\\sim{10^{-4}G}$ is a too strong field to\nwarrant a galactic dynamo seed.\n", "  This is a reply to the recent comment from Ikeda, Berthier, and Sollich\n(arXiv:1602.04796) on \"Constant stress and pressure rheology of colloidal\nsuspensions\", Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 158301 (2015).\n", "  Linear spinor fields are a generalization of the Dirac field that have direct\ncorrespondence with the known physics of fermions, inherent causality\nproperties in their most fundamental constructions, and positive mass\neigenvalues for all particle types. The algebra of the generators for\ninfinitesimal transformations of these fields directly constructs the Minkowski\nmetric \\emph{within} the internal group space as a consequence of non-vanishing\ncommutation relations between generators that carry space-time indexes. In\naddition, the generators have a fundamental matrix representation that includes\nLorentz transformations within a group that unifies internal gauge symmetries\ngenerated by a set of hermitian generators for SU(3)$\\times$SU(2)$\\times$U(1),\nand nothing else. The construction of linearly independent internal SU(3) and\nSU(2) symmetry groups necessarily involves the mixing of three generations of\nthe mass eigenstates labeling the (massive) representations of the linear\nspinor fields. The group algebra also provides a mechanism for the dynamic\nmixing of massless particles of differing \"transverse mass\" eigenvalues\nconjugate to the affine parameter labeling translations along their light-like\ntrajectories. The inclusion of a transverse mass generator is necessary for\ngroup closure of the extended Poincare algebra, but its eigenvalue must vanish\nfor massive particle representations. A unified set of space-time group\ntransformation operations along with internal gauge group symmetry operations\nfor linear spinor fields will be demonstrated in this paper.\n", "  The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first\nproposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a\ncentral authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called\nthe blockchain. In this paper we use the no-cloning theorem of quantum\nmechanics to introduce Quantum Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-like currency that runs on a\nquantum computer. We show that our construction of quantum shards and two\nblockchains allows untrusted peers to mint quantum money without risking the\nintegrity of the currency. The Quantum Bitcoin protocol has several advantages\nover classical Bitcoin, including immediate local verification of transactions.\nThis is a major improvement since we no longer need the computationally\nintensive and time-consuming method Bitcoin uses to record all transactions in\nthe blockchain. Instead, Quantum Bitcoin only records newly minted currency\nwhich drastically reduces the footprint and increases efficiency. We present\nformal security proofs for counterfeiting resistance and show that a quantum\nbitcoin can be re-used a large number of times before wearing out - just like\nordinary coins and banknotes. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum\nmoney system and we show that the lack of a paper trail implies full anonymity\nfor the users. In addition, there are no transaction fees and the system can\nscale to any transaction volume.\n", "  Results are reported from a numerical investigation of orbits in a truncated\nToda potential which is perturbed by weak friction and noise. Two significant\nconclusions are shown to emerge: (1) Despite other nontrivial behaviour,\nconfiguration, velocity, and energy space moments associated with these\nperturbations exhibit a simple scaling in the amplitude of the friction and\nnoise. (2) Even very weak friction and noise can induce an extrinsic diffusion\nthrough cantori on a time scale much shorter than that associated with\nintrinsic diffusion in the unperturbed system.\n", "  We develop the concept of frequency dependent effective mass, M(omega), of\njammed granular materials which occupy a rigid cavity to a filling fraction of\n48%, the remaining volume being air of normal room condition or controlled\nhumidity. The dominant features of M(omega) provide signatures of the\ndissipation of acoustic modes, elasticity and aging effects in the granular\nmedium. We perform humidity controlled experiments and interpret the data in\nterms of a continuum model and a \"trap\" model of thermally activated capillary\nbridges at the contact points. The results suggest that attenuation in the\ngranular materials is influenced significantly by the kinetics of capillary\ncondensation between the asperities at the contacts.\n", "  The U(1,1) and U(2) transformations realized by three-mode interaction in the\nrespective parametric approximations are studied in conditional measurement,\nand the corresponding non-unitary transformation operators are derived. As an\napplication, the preparation of single-mode quantum states using an optical\nfeedback loop is discussed, with special emphasis of Fock state preparation.\nFor that example, the influence of non-perfect detection and feedback is also\nconsidered.\n"]}
