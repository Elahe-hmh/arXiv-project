the thin disc in the solar cylinder\nbased on a continuous star formation history and a continuous dynamical heating\nof the stellar subpopulations. The vertical distribution of the stellar\nsubpopulations are calculated self-consistently in dynamical equilibrium. The\nSFR and AVR of the stellar subpopulations are determined by fitting the\nvelocity distribution functions of main sequence stars. The SFR shows a maximum\n10 Gyr ago declining by a factor of 10 until present time. A constant SFR can\nbe ruled out. The velocity dispersion of the stellar subpopulations increase\nwith age according to a power law with index 0.375. The new scale heights lead\nto a best fit IMF with power-law indices of 1.5 below and 4.0 above 1.6 Msun,\nwhich has no kink around 1 Msun. Including a thick disc component results in\nslight variations of the thin disc properties, but has a negligible influence\non the SFR. A variety of predictions are made concerning the number density,\nage and metallicity distributions of stellar subpopulations as a function of z\nabove the galactic plane.\n", "  We present the far-IR, millimeter, and radio photometry as well as optical\nand near-IR spectroscopy of a sample of 48 z~1-3 Spitzer-selected ULIRGs with\nIRS mid-IR spectra. Our goals are to compute their bolometric emission, and to\ndetermine both the presence and relative strength of their AGN and starburst\ncomponents. We find that strong-PAH sources tend to have higher 160um and 1.2mm\nfluxes than weak-PAH sources. The depth of the 9.7um silicate feature does not\naffect MAMBO detectability. We fit the far-IR SEDs of our sample and find an\naverage <L_{IR}>~7x10^{12}Lsun for our z>1.5 sources. Spectral decomposition\nsuggests that strong-PAH sources typically have ~20-30% AGN fractions. Weak-PAH\nsources by contrast tend to have >~70% AGN fractions, with a few sources having\ncomparable contributions of AGN and starbursts. The optical line diagnostics\nsupport the presence of AGN in the bulk of the weak-PAH sources. With one\nexception, our sources are narrow-line sources, show no obvious correspondence\nbetween the optical extinction and the silicate feature depth, and, in two\ncases, show evidence for outflows. Radio AGN are present in both strong-PAH and\nweak-PAH sources. This is supported by our sample's far-IR-to-radio ratios (q)\nbeing consistently below the average value of 2.34 for local star-forming\ngalaxies. We use survival analysis to include the lower-limits given by the\nradio-undetected sources, arriving at <q>=2.07+/-0.01 for our z>1.5 sample. In\ntotal, radio and, where available, optical line diagnostics support the\npresence of AGN in 57% of the z>1.5 sources, independent of IR-based\ndiagnostics. For higher-z sources, the AGN luminosities alone are estimated to\nbe >10^{12}Lsun, which, supported by the [OIII] luminosities, implies that the\nbulk of our sources host obscured quasars.\n", "  We propose a Parton Distribution Function (PDF) fitting technique which is\nbased on an interactive neural network algorithm using Self-Organizing Maps\n(SOMs). SOMs are visualization algorithms based on competitive learning among\nspatially-ordered neurons. Our SOMs are trained with stochastically generated\nPDF samples. On every optimization iteration the PDFs are clustered on the SOM\naccording to a user-defined feature and the most promising candidates are\nselected as a seed for the subsequent iteration. Our main goal is thus to\nprovide a fitting procedure that, at variance with the global analyses and\nstandard neural network approaches, allows for an increased control of the\nsystematic bias by enabling user interaction in the various stages of the\nfitting process.\n", "  Within the hierarchical framework for galaxy formation, merging and tidal\ninteractions are expected to shape large galaxies to this day. While major\nmergers are quite rare at present, minor mergers and satellite disruptions -\nwhich result in stellar streams - should be common, and are indeed seen in both\nthe Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. As a pilot study, we have carried out\nultra-deep, wide-field imaging of some spiral galaxies in the Local Volume,\nwhich has revealed external views of such stellar tidal streams at\nunprecedented detail, with data taken at small robotic telescopes\n(0.1-0.5-meter) that provide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity. The goal\nof this project is to undertake the first systematic and comprehensive imaging\nsurvey of stellar tidal streams, from a sample of ~50 nearby Milky-Way-like\nspiral galaxies within 15 Mpc, that features a surface brightness sensitivity\nof ~ 30 mag/arcsec^2 The survey will result in estimates of the incidence,\nsize/geometry and stellar luminosity/mass distribution of such streams. This\nwill not only put our Milky Way and M31 in context but, for the first time,\nalso provide an extensive statistical basis for comparison with\nstate-of-the-art, self-consistent cosmological simulations of this phenomenon.\n", "  We study the efficacy of two-qubit mixed entangled states as resources for\nquantum teleportation. We first consider two maximally entangled mixed states,\nviz., the Werner state\\cite{werner}, and a class of states introduced by Munro\n{\\it et al.} \\cite{munro}. We show that the Werner state when used as\nteleportation channel, gives rise to better average teleportation fidelity\ncompared to the latter class of states for any finite value of mixedness. We\nthen introduce a non-maximally entangled mixed state obtained as a convex\ncombination of a two-qubit entangled mixed state and a two-qubit separable\nmixed state. It is shown that such a teleportation channel can outperform\nanother non-maximally entangled channed, viz., the Werner derivative for a\ncertain range of mixedness. Further, there exists a range of parameter values\nwhere the former state satisfies a Bell-CHSH type inequality and still performs\nbetter as a teleportation channel compared to the Werner derivative even though\nthe latter violates the inequality.\n", "  Recently we have proposed mechanisms to explain origins of the charged lepton\nspectrum as well as Koide's mass formula, on the basis of U(3)\\times O(3)\nfamily gauge symmetry. In this note, we review the basic ideas of these\nmechanisms. Without technical details, and adding some speculations, we give a\nsketch of the mechanisms, what the important points are and what assumptions\nare involved.\n  We adopt a known scenario, in which the charged lepton spectrum is determined\nby the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field that takes values on 3-by-3\nmatrix. Within this scenario, we propose a mechanism, in which the radiative\ncorrection induced by U(3) family gauge interaction cancels the QED radiative\ncorrection to Koide's mass formula. We consider SU(9)\\times U(1) symmetry\nbroken down to U(3)\\times O(3) symmetry. This leads to a potential model which\npredicts Koide's mass formula and the charged lepton spectrum consistent with\nthe experimental values, by largely avoiding fine tuning of parameters. These\nare discussed within an effective theory, and we argue for its validity and\nusefulness.\n", "  Since VLBI techniques give microarcsecond position accuracy of celestial\nobjects, tests of GR using radio sources as probes of a gravitational field\nhave been made. We present the results from two recent tests using the VLBA: In\n2005, the measurement of the classical solar deflection; and in 2002, the\nmeasurement of the retarded gravitational deflection associated with Jupiter.\nThe deflection experiment measured PPN-gamma to an accuracy of 0.0003; the\nJupiter experiment measured the retarded term to 20% accuracy. The controversy\nover the interpretation of the retarded term is summarized.\n", "  We use the concept of \\textit{entangled graphs} with weighted edges to\npresent a classification for four-qubit entanglement which is based neither on\nthe LOCC nor the SLOCC. Entangled graphs, first introduced by Plesch et al.\n[Phys. Rev. A 67, (2003) 012322], are structures such that each qubit of a\nmulti-qubit system is represented as a vertex and an edge between two vertices\ndenotes bipartite entanglement between the corresponding qubits. Our\nclassification is based on the use of generalized Schmidt decomposition of pure\nstates of multi-qubit systems. We show that for every possible entangled graph\none can find a pure state such that the reduced entanglement of each pair,\nmeasured by concurrence, represents the weight of the corresponding edge in the\ngraph. We also use the concept of tripartite and quadripartite concurrences as\na proper measure of global entanglement of the states. In this case a circle\nincluding the graph indicates the presence of global entanglement.\n", "  Previous studies suggest that the planet-forming disks around very-low-mass\nstars/brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars, in\ncontrast to model predictions of larger scale heights for gas-disks around\nlower-mass stars. We conducted a statistically robust study to determine\nwhether there is evidence for stellar-mass-dependent disk structure in\nplanet-forming disks. We find a statistically significant difference in the\nSpitzer/IRAC color distributions of disks around very-low-mass and low-mass\nstars all belonging to the same star-forming region, the Chamaeleon I\nstar-forming region. We show that self consistently calculated disk models\ncannot fit the median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the two groups.\nThese SEDs can be only explained by flatter disk models, consistent with the\neffect of dust settling in disks. We find that relative to the disk structure\npredicted for flared disks the required reduction in disk scale height is\nanti-correlated with the stellar mass, i.e. disks around lower-mass stars are\nflatter. Our results show that the initial and boundary conditions of planet\nformation are stellar-mass-dependent, an important finding that must be\nconsidered in planet formation models.\n", "  We construct a model for inelastic neutrino- and electron-nucleon scattering\ncross sections using effective leading order parton distribution functions with\na new scaling variable $\\xi_w$. Non-perturbative effects are well described\nusing the $\\xi_w$ scaling variable, in combination with multiplicative $K$\nfactors at low $Q^2$. Our model describes all inelastic charged lepton-nucleon\nscattering (including resonance) data (HERA/NMC/BCDMS/SLAC/JLab) ranging from\nvery high $Q^2$ to very low $Q^2$ and down to the photo-production region. The\nmodel describes existing inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering measurements,\nand is currently used in analyses of neutrino oscillation experiments in the\nfew GeV region.\n", "  We study the propagation of waves in quasi-one-dimensional finite periodic\nsystems whose classical (ray) dynamics is diffusive. By considering a random\nmatrix model for a chain of $L$ identical chaotic cavities, we show that its\naverage conductance as a function of $L$ displays an ohmic behavior even though\nthe system has no disorder. This behavior, with an average conductance decay\n$N/L$, where $N$ is the number of propagating modes in the leads that connect\nthe cavities, holds for $1\\ll L \\lesssim \\sqrt{N}.$ After this regime, the\naverage conductance saturates at a value of ${\\mathcal O}(\\sqrt{N})$ given by\nthe average number of propagating Bloch modes $<N_B>$ of the infinite chain. We\nalso study the weak localization correction and conductance distribution, and\ncharacterize its behavior as the system undergoes the transition from diffusive\nto Bloch-ballistic. These predictions are tested in a periodic cosine\nwaveguide.\n", "  This paper demonstrates that the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of a\ndiluted 2D Ising antiferromagnetic system corresponds with the phase diagram\nfor non conventional superconductors. An energy gap of this system is defined.\nWe also find a strange phenomenon that when the lattice size of simulation\nincreased the crystal structure becomes more like quasi crystal at the low\ntemperature.\n", "  Chiral polymers are ubiquitous in nature and in the cellular context they are\noften found in association with membranes. Here we show that surface bound\npolymers with an intrinsic twist and anisotropic bending stiffness can exhibit\na sharp continuous phase transition between states with very different\neffective persistence lengths as the binding affinity is increased. Above a\ncritical value for the binding strength, determined solely by the torsional\nmodulus and intrinsic twist rate, the filament can exist in a zero twist,\nsurface bound state with a homogeneous stiffness. Below the critical binding\nstrength, twist walls proliferate and function as weak or floppy joints that\nsharply reduce the effective persistence length that is measurable on long\nlengthscales. The existence of such dramatically different conformational\nstates has implications for both biopolymer function {\\it in vivo} and for\nexperimental observations of such filaments {\\it in vitro}.\n", "  We propose a model of nonequilibrium quantum transport of particles and\nenergy in a system connected to mesoscopic Fermi reservoirs (meso-reservoir).\nThe meso-reservoirs are in turn thermalized to prescribed temperatures and\nchemical potentials by a simple dissipative mechanism described by the Lindblad\nequation. As an example, we study transport in monoatomic and diatomic chains\nof non-interacting spinless fermions. We show numerically the breakdown of the\nOnsager reciprocity relation due to the dissipative terms of the model.\n", "  In this study, approximation formulas for evaluating Landau constants are\nelaborated by using the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme (BPES). Results\nare compared to some referred studies.\n", "  Thermoelectric properties of the system La$_2$NiO$_{4+\\delta}$ have been\nstudied ab initio. Large Seebeck coefficient values are predicted for the\nparent compound, and to some extent remain in the hole-doped metallic phase,\naccompanied of an increase in the conductivity. This system, due to its layered\nstructure would be a suitable candidate for an improvement of its\nthermoelectric figure of merit by nanostructurization in thin films, that has\nalready been shown to increase the electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$). Our\ncalculations show that in the region around La$_2$NiO$_{4.05}$ the system has a\nlarge thermopower at high temperatures and also a substantially increased\n$\\sigma$. Films grown with this low-doping concentration will show an optimal\nrelationship between thermopower and $\\sigma$. This result is obtained for\nvarious exchange-correlation schemes (correlated, uncorrelated and\nparameter-free) that we use to analyze the electronic structure of the\nhole-doped compound.\n", "  While the formal valence and charge state concepts have been tremendously\nimportant in materials physics and chemistry, their very loose connection to\nactual charge leads to uncertainties in modeling behavior and interpreting\ndata. We point out, taking several transition metal oxides (La$_2$VCuO$_6$,\nYNiO$_3$, CaFeO$_3$, AgNiO$_2$, V$_4$O$_7$) as examples, that while dividing\nthe crystal charge into atomic contributions is an ill-posed activity, the 3d\noccupation of a cation (and more particularly, differences) is readily\navailable in first principles calculations. We discuss these examples, which\ninclude distinct charge states and charge-order (or disproportionation)\nsystems, where different \"charge states\" of cations have identical 3d orbital\noccupation. Implications for theoretical modeling of such charge states and\ncharge-ordering mechanisms are discussed.\n", "  We study particle current and occupation distribution in a recently proposed\nmodel for coherent quantum transport. In this model a system connected to\nmesoscopic Fermi reservoirs (mesoreservoir) is driven out of equilibrium by the\naction of superreservoirs with prescribed temperatures and chemical potentials\ndescribed by a simple dissipative mechanism with the Lindblad equation. We\ncompare exact (numerical) results for the non-equilibrium steady state particle\ncurrent with theoretical expectations based on the Landauer formula and show\nthat the model reproduce the behavior of coherent quantum systems in the\nexpected parameter region. We also obtain the occupation distribution on the\nmesoreservoir in the non-equilibrium steady state and compare them with the\noccupation distribution on the leads in usual description of coherent quantum\ntransport.\n", "  The inclusive tau lepton hadronic decay and its description within Dispersive\napproach to Quantum Chromodynamics are briefly discussed.\n", "  The emergence of collective motion, also known as flocking or swarming, in\ngroups of moving individuals who orient themselves using only information from\ntheir neighbors is a very general phenomenon that is manifested at multiple\nspatial and temporal scales. Swarms that occur in natural environments\ntypically have to contend with spatial disorder such as obstacles that hinder\nan individual's motion or communication with neighbors. We study swarming\nparticles, with both aligning and repulsive interactions, on percolated\nnetworks where topological disorder is modeled by the random removal of lattice\nbonds. We find that an infinitesimal amount of disorder can completely suppress\nswarming for particles that utilize only alignment interactions suggesting that\nalignment alone is insufficient. The addition of repulsive forces between\nparticles produces a critical phase transition from a collectively moving swarm\nto a disordered gas-like state. This novel phase transition is entirely driven\nby the amount of topological disorder in the particles environment and displays\ncritical features that are similar to those of 2D percolation, while occurring\nat a value of disorder that is far from the percolation critical point.\n", "  English translation of P. Drude, Annalen der Physik 13, 512 (1904), an\narticle by Paul Drude about Tesla transformers and wireless telegraphy.\nIncludes a discussion of the derivation of an equivalent circuit and the\nprediction of nonreciprocal mutual inductance for Tesla transformers in the\narticle, which is supplementary material for B. McGuyer, PLoS ONE 9, e115397\n(2014).\n", "  Thermoelectric properties of the system La$_2$NiO$_{4+\\delta}$ have been\nrecently discussed [Phys. Rev. B 86, 165114 (2012)] via ab initio calculations.\nAn optimum hole-doping value was obtained with reasonable thermopower and\nthermoelectric figure of merit being calculated. Here, a large increase in the\nthermoelectric performance through lattice strain and the corresponding atomic\nrelaxations is predicted. This increase would be experimentally attainable via\ngrowth in thin films of the material on top of different substrates. A small\ntensile strain would produce large thermoelectric figures of merit at high\ntemperatures, $zT$ $\\sim$ 1 in the range of oxygen excess $\\delta$ $\\sim$ 0.05\n- 0.10 and in-plane lattice parameter in the range 3.95 - 4.05 \\AA. In that\nrelatively wide range of parameters, thermopower values close to 200 $\\mu$V/K\nare obtained. The best performance of this compound is expected to occur in the\nhigh temperature limit.\n", "  We consider the 3D quantum BBGKY hierarchy which corresponds to the\n$N$-particle Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. We assume the pair interaction is\n$N^{3\\beta -1}V(N^{\\beta}\\bullet).$ For interaction parameter $\\beta\n\\in(0,\\frac23)$, we prove that, as $N\\rightarrow \\infty ,$ the limit points of\nthe solutions to the BBGKY hierarchy satisfy the space-time bound conjectured\nby Klainerman-Machedon in 2008. This allows for the application of the\nKlainerman-Machedon uniqueness theorem, and hence implies that the limit is\nuniquely determined as a tensor product of solutions to the Gross-Pitaevski\nequation when the $N$-body initial data is factorized. The first result in this\ndirection in 3D was obtained by T. Chen and N. Pavlovi\\'{c} (2011) for $\\beta\n\\in (0,\\frac14)$ and subsequently by X. Chen (2012) for $\\beta\\in (0,\\frac27]$.\nWe build upon the approach of X. Chen but apply frequency localized\nKlainerman-Machedon collapsing estimates and the endpoint Strichartz estimate\nin the estimate of the potential part to extend the range to $\\beta\\in\n(0,\\frac23)$. Overall, this provides an alternative approach to the mean-field\nprogram by Erd\\\"os-Schlein-Yau (2007), whose uniqueness proof is based upon\nFeynman diagram combinatorics.\n", "  The Von Neumann quantum measurement theory and Zurek reformulation are based\non an assumption that the quantum system, apparatus and environment obey the\nquantum mechanics rules. According to the Zurek theory the observers typically\ninteract with their surrounding environments. In this article, we give a more\nrealistic image of the quantum measurement theory; we have proposed a\ncorrection to Zurek quantum measurement theory based on the fuzzy logic and\nfuzzy set theory.\n", "  We present a new variational framework for dissipative general relativistic\nfluid dynamics. The model extends the convective variational principle for\nmulti-fluid systems to account for a range of dissipation channels. The key\ningredients in the construction are i) the use of a lower dimensional matter\nspace for each fluid component, and ii) an extended functional dependence for\nthe associated volume forms. In an effort to make the concepts clear, the\nformalism is developed in steps with the model example of matter coupled to\nheat considered at each level. Thus we discuss a model for heat flow, derive\nthe relativistic Navier-Stokes equations and discuss why the individual\ndissipative stress tensors need not be spacetime symmetric. We argue that the\nnew formalism, which notably does not involve an expansion away from an assumed\nequilibrium state, provides a conceptual breakthrough in this area of research\nand provide an ambitious list of directions in which one may want to extend it\nin the future. This involves an exciting set of problems, relating to both\napplications and foundational issues.\n", "  Recently, a square-integrable discrete basis, obtained performing a simple\nanalytical local scale transformation to the harmonic oscillator basis, has\nbeen proposed and successfully applied to study the properties of two-body\nsystems. Here, the method is generalized to study three-body systems. To test\nthe goodness of the formalism and establish its applicability and limitations,\nthe capture reaction rate for the nucleosynthesis of the Borromean nucleus 6He\n(4He + n + n) is addressed. Results are compared with previous publications and\nwith calculations based on actual three-body continuum wave functions, which\ncan be generated for this simple case. The obtained results encourage the\napplication to other Borromean nuclei of astrophysical interest such as 9Be and\n12C, for which actual three-body continuum calculations are very involved.\n", "  Laser induced ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic metals was\ndiscovered almost 20 years ago, but currently there is still lack of consensus\non the microscopic mechanism responsible for the corresponding transfer of\nangular momentum and energy between electron, lattice and spin subsystems. A\ndistinct, but intrinsically correlated phenomenon occurring on a longer\ntimescale is the magnetization precession after the ultrafast demagnetization\nprocess, if a magnetic field is applied to tilt the magnetization vector away\nfrom its easy direction, which can be attributed to the change of anisotropy\nafter laser heating. In an in-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt thin film with\nperpendicular interface anisotropy, we found excellent agreement between\ntheoretical prediction with plausible parameters and experimental data measured\nusing time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. This agreement confirms that\nthe time evolution of the anisotropy field, which is driven by the interaction\nbetween electrons and phonons, determines the magnetization precession\ncompletely. A detailed analysis shows that, even though the whole sample is\nmagnetized in-plane, the dynamic interface anisotropy field dictates the\ninitial phase of the magnetization precession, highlighting the significance of\nthe interface anisotropy field in laser induced magnetization precession.\n", "  To gain insight into the mechanism of charge-ordering transitions, which\nconventionally are pictured as a disproportionation of an ion M as 2M$^{n+}$\n$\\rightarrow$ M$^{(n+1)+}$ + M$^{(n-1)+}$, we (1) review and reconsider the\ncharge state (or oxidation number) picture itself, (2) introduce new results\nfor the putative charge ordering compound AgNiO$_2$ and the dual charge state\ninsulator AgO, and (3) analyze cationic occupations of actual (not formal)\ncharge, and work to reconcile the conundrums that arise. We establish that\nseveral of the clearest cases of charge ordering transitions involve no\ndisproportion (no charge transfer between the cations, hence no charge\ntransfer), and that the experimental data used to support charge ordering can\nbe accounted for within density functional based calculations that contain no\ncharge transfer between cations. We propose that the charge state picture\nretains meaning and importance, at least inn many cases, if one focuses on\nWannier functions rather than atomic orbitals. The challenge of modeling charge\nordering transitions with model Hamiltonians is discussed.\n", "  Properly coordinating cooperation is relevant for resolving public good\nproblems such as clean energy and environmental protection. However, little is\nknown about how individuals can coordinate themselves for a certain level of\ncooperation in large populations of strangers. In a typical situation, a\nconsensus-building process hardly succeeds due to lack of face and standing.\nThe evolution of cooperation in this type of situation is studied using\nthreshold public good games in which cooperation prevails when it is initially\nsufficient, or otherwise, it perishes. While punishment is a powerful tool to\nshape human behaviours, institutional punishment is often too costly to start\nwith only a few contributors, which is another coordination problem. Here we\nshow that whatever the initial conditions, reward funds based on voluntary\ncontribution can evolve. The voluntary reward paves the way for effectively\novercoming the coordination problem and efficiently transforms freeloaders to\ncooperators with a perceived small risk of collective failure.\n", "  We derive a redshift drift formula within the framework of varying speed of\nlight (VSL) theory using the specific ansatz for the variability of $c(t) = c_0\na^n(t)$. We show that negative values of the parameter $n$, which correspond to\ndiminishing value of the speed of light during the evolution of the universe,\neffectively rescales dust matter to become little negative pressure matter, and\nthe cosmological constant to became phantom. Positive values of $n$ (growing\n$c(t)$) make VSL model to become more like Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model.\nObservationally, there is a distinction between the VSL model and the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model for the admissible values of the parameter $n \\sim -\n10^{-5}$, though it will be rather difficult to detect by planned extremely\nlarge telescopes (E-ELT, TMT, GMT) within their accuracy.\n", "  A recent study by Rahaman et al. has shown that the galactic halo possesses\nthe necessary properties for supporting traversable wormholes, based on two\nobservational results, the density profile due to Navarro et al. and the\nobserved flat rotation curves of galaxies. Using a method for calculating the\ndeflection angle pioneered by V. Bozza, it is shown that the deflection angle\ndiverges at the throat of the wormhole. The resulting photon sphere has a\nradius of 0.40 ly. Given the dark-matter background, detection may be possible\nfrom past data using ordinary light.\n", "  We consider gravity in four dimensions in the vielbein formulation, where the\nfundamental variables are a tetrad $e$ and a SO(3,1) connection $\\omega$. We\nstart with the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism\ninvariance which includes, besides the standard Palatini term, other terms that\neither do not change the equations of motion, or are topological in nature. For\nour analysis we employ the covariant Hamiltonian formalism where the phase\nspace $\\Gamma$ is given by solutions to the equations of motion. We consider\nspacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically flat\nboundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizons\nboundary conditions. For this extended action we study the effect of the\ntopological terms on the Hamiltonian formulation. We prove two results. The\nfirst one is rather generic, applicable to any field theory with boundaries:\nThe addition of topological terms (and any other boundary term) does not modify\nthe symplectic structure of the theory. The second result pertains to the\nconserved Hamiltonian and Noether charges, whose properties we analyze in\ndetail, including their relationship. While the Hamiltonian charges are\nunaffected by the addition of topological and boundary terms, we show in detail\nthat the Noether charges {\\em do} change. Thus, a non-trivial relation between\nthese two sets of charges arises when the boundary and topological terms needed\nfor a consistent formulation are included.\n", "  In this paper, we study the local-in-time existence of solutions to\nrandomized forms of the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy on periodic domains. In\nparticular, we study the independently randomized Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy\nand the dependently randomized Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, which were first\nintroduced in the author's joint work with Staffilani \\cite{SoSt}. For these\nhierarchies, we construct local-in-time low-regularity solutions in spaces\nwhich contain a random component. The constructed density matrices will solve\nthe full randomized hierarchies, thus extending the results from \\cite{SoSt},\nwhere solutions solving arbitrarily long subhierarchies were given.\n  Our analysis will be based on the truncation argument which was first used in\nthe deterministic setting in the work of T. Chen and Pavlovi\\'{c} \\cite{CP4}.\nThe presence of randomization in the problem adds additional difficulties, most\nnotably to estimating the Duhamel expansions that are crucial in the truncation\nargument. These difficulties are overcome by a detailed analysis of the Duhamel\nexpansions. In the independently randomized case, we need to keep track of\nwhich randomization parameters appear in the Duhamel terms, whereas in the\ndependently randomized case, we express the Duhamel terms directly in terms of\nthe initial data. In both cases, we can obtain stronger results with respect to\nthe time variable if we assume additional regularity on the initial data.\n", "  We have performed ab initio calculations within the LDA+U method in the\nmultilayered system (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$ / (SrMnO$_3$)$_n$. Our results suggest a\ncharge-ordered state that alternates Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ cations in a\ncheckerboard in-plane pattern is developed at the interfacial layer, leading to\na gap opening. Such an interfacial charge-ordered situation would be the\nenergetically favored reconstruction between LaMnO$_3$ and SrMnO$_3$. This\nhelps understanding the insulating behavior observed experimentally in these\nmultilayers at intermediate values of $n$, whose origin is known to be due to\nsome interfacial mechanism.\n", "  Building upon past work on the phase diagram of Janus fluids [Sciortino et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{103}, 237801 (2009)], we perform a detailed study\nof integral equation theory of the Kern-Frenkel potential with coverage that is\ntuned from the isotropic square-well fluid to the Janus limit. An improved\nalgorithm for the reference hypernetted-chain (RHNC) equation for this problem\nis implemented that significantly extends the range of applicability of RHNC.\nResults for both structure and thermodynamics are presented and compared with\nnumerical simulations. Unlike previous attempts, this algorithm is shown to be\nstable down to the Janus limit, thus paving the way for analyzing the\nfrustration mechanism characteristic of the gas-liquid transition in the Janus\nsystem. The results are also compared with Barker-Henderson thermodynamic\nperturbation theory on the same model. We then discuss the pros and cons of\nboth approaches within a unified treatment. On balance, RHNC integral equation\ntheory, even with an isotropic hard-sphere reference system, is found to be a\ngood compromise between accuracy of the results, computational effort, and\nuniform quality to tackle self-assembly processes in patchy colloids of complex\nnature. Further improvement in RHNC however clearly requires an\n\\emph{anisotropic} reference bridge function.\n", "  The $^{13}$CO molecule is often used as a column density tracer in regions\nwhere the $^{12}$CO emission saturates. The $^{13}$CO column density is then\nrelated to that of $^{12}$CO by a uniform isotopic ratio. A similar\napproximation is frequently used when deriving $^{13}$CO emission maps from\nnumerical simulations of molecular clouds. To test this assumption we calculate\nthe $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio self-consistently, taking the isotope selective\nphotodissociation and the chemical fractionation of CO into account. We model\nthe coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical evolution and the emergent\n$^{13}$CO emission of isolated, starless molecular clouds in various\nenvironments. Selective photodissociation has a minimal effect on the ratio,\nwhile the chemical fractionation causes a factor of 2-3 decrease at\nintermediate cloud depths. The variation correlates with both the $^{12}$CO and\nthe $^{13}$CO column densities. Neglecting the depth dependence results in\n$\\leq$60 per cent error in $^{12}$CO column densities derived from $^{13}$CO.\nThe same assumption causes $\\leq$50 per cent disparity in the $^{13}$CO\nemission derived from simulated clouds. We show that the discrepancies can be\ncorrected by a fitting formula. The formula is consistent with\nmillimetre-wavelength isotopic ratio measurements of dense molecular clouds,\nbut underestimates the ratios from the ultraviolet absorption of diffuse\nregions.\n", "  Spectral measures for fundamental representations of the rank two Lie groups\n$SU(3)$, $Sp(2)$ and $G_2$ have been studied. Since these groups have rank two,\nthese spectral measures can be defined as measures over their maximal torus\n$\\mathbb{T}^2$ and are invariant under an action of the corresponding Weyl\ngroup, which is a subgroup of $GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Here we consider spectral\nmeasures invariant under an action of the other finite subgroups of\n$GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. These spectral measures are all associated with fundamental\nrepresentations of other rank two Lie groups, namely $\\mathbb{T}^2=U(1) \\times\nU(1)$, $U(1) \\times SU(2)$, $U(2)$, $SU(2) \\times SU(2)$, $SO(4)$ and $PSU(3)$.\n", "  Eigenfunctions of integrable planar billiards are studied - in particular,\nthe number of nodal domains, $\\nu$, of the eigenfunctions are considered. The\nbilliards for which the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation (Helmholtz\nequation) is separable admit trivial expressions for the number of domains.\nHere, we discover that for all separable and non-separable integrable\nbilliards, $\\nu $ satisfies certain difference equations. This has been\npossible because the eigenfunctions can be classified in families labelled by\nthe same value of $m\\mod kn$, given a particular $k$, for a set of quantum\nnumbers, $m, n$. Further, we observe that the patterns in a family are similar\nand the algebraic representation of the geometrical nodal patterns is found.\nInstances of this representation are explained in detail to understand the\nbeauty of the patterns. This paper therefore presents a mathematical connection\nbetween integrable systems and difference equations.\n", "  In this paper, we will obtain a rigorous derivation of the defocusing cubic\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation on the three-dimensional torus\n$\\mathbb{T}^3$ from the many-body limit of interacting bosonic systems. This\ntype of result was previously obtained on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ in the work of\nErd\\H{o}s, Schlein, and Yau \\cite{ESY2,ESY3,ESY4,ESY5}, and on $\\mathbb{T}^2$\nand $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in the work of Kirkpatrick, Schlein, and Staffilani\n\\cite{KSS}. Our proof relies on an unconditional uniqueness result for the\nGross-Pitaevskii hierarchy at the level of regularity $\\alpha=1$, which is\nproved by using a modification of the techniques from the work of T. Chen,\nHainzl, Pavlovi\\'{c} and Seiringer \\cite{ChHaPavSei} to the periodic setting.\nThese techniques are based on the Quantum de Finetti theorem in the formulation\nof Ammari and Nier \\cite{AmmariNier1,AmmariNier2} and Lewin, Nam, and Rougerie\n\\cite{LewinNamRougerie}. In order to apply this approach in the periodic\nsetting, we need to recall multilinear estimates obtained by Herr, Tataru, and\nTzvetkov \\cite{HTT}.\n  Having proved the unconditional uniqueness result at the level of regularity\n$\\alpha=1$, we will apply it in order to finish the derivation of the\ndefocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation on $\\mathbb{T}^3$, which\nwas started in the work of Elgart, Erd\\H{o}s, Schlein, and Yau \\cite{EESY}. In\nthe latter work, the authors obtain all the steps of Spohn's strategy for the\nderivation of the NLS \\cite{Spohn}, except for the final step of uniqueness.\nAdditional arguments are necessary to show that the objects constructed in\n\\cite{EESY} satisfy the assumptions of the unconditional uniqueness theorem.\nOnce we achieve this, we are able to prove the derivation result. In\nparticular, we show \\emph{Propagation of Chaos} for the defocusing\nGross-Pitaevskii hierarchy on $\\mathbb{T}^3$ for suitably chosen initial data.\n", "  We define the separability and entanglement notion for particle with spin\n$s=1$. We consider two cases. In the first the particle is composed of two\nfermions with $s_1=1/2$ and $s_2=1/2$. In the second case the state is the\nqutrit state which is not composed system. The notion of negativity and\nconcurrence is defined for the qutrit state. The concurrence and negativity of\nentangled and separable qutrit states determined by the parameters of the\ndensity matrix are explicitly calculated. The maximum entanglement of the\nqutrit state is observed for maximum values of non diagonal matrix elements of\nthe density matrix. New entropic inequalities for the density matrix of the\nqutrit state are obtained.\n", "  The structure of the Borromean nucleus $^9$Be ($\\alpha+\\alpha+n$) is\naddressed within a three-body approach using the analytical transformed\nharmonic oscillator method. The three-body formalism provides an accurate\ndescription of the radiative capture reaction rate for the entire temperature\nrange relevant in Astrophysics. At high temperatures, results match the\ncalculations based on two-step sequential processes. At low temperatures, where\nthe particles have no access to intermediate two-body resonances, the\nthree-body direct capture leads to reaction rates larger than the sequential\nprocesses. These results support the reliability of the method for systems with\nseveral charged particles.\n", "  Hard helices can be regarded as a paradigmatic elementary model for a number\nof natural and synthetic soft matter systems, all featuring the helix as their\nbasic structural unit: from natural polynucleotides and polypeptides to\nsynthetic helical polymers; from bacterial flagella to colloidal helices. Here\nwe present an extensive investigation of the phase diagram of hard helices\nusing a variety of methods. Isobaric Monte Carlo numerical simulations are used\nto trace the phase diagram: on going from the low-density isotropic to the\nhigh-density compact phases, a rich polymorphism is observed exhibiting a\nspecial chiral screw-like nematic phase and a number of chiral and/or polar\nsmectic phases. We present a full characterization of the latter, showing that\nthey have unconventional features, ascribable to the helical shape of the\nconstituent particles. Equal area construction is used to locate the\nisotropic-to-nematic phase transition, and results are compared with those\nstemming from an Onsager-like theory. Density functional theory is also used to\nstudy the nematic-to-screw-nematic phase transition: within the simplifying\nassumption of perfectly parallel helices, we compare different levels of\napproximation, that is second- and third-virial expansions and Parsons-Lee\ncorrection.\n", "  Prion diseases are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative\ndiseases that affect a wide variety of mammalian species such as sheep and\ngoats, cattle, deer, elks, humans and mice etc., but rabbits have a low\nsusceptibility to be infected by prion diseases with respect to other species.\nThe stability of rabbit prion protein is due to its highly ordered\n{\\beta}2-{\\alpha}2 loop (PLoS One 5(10) e13273 (2010); Journal of Biological\nChemistry 285(41) 31682-31693 (2010)) and a hydrophobic staple helix-capping\nmotif (PNAS 107(46) 19808-19813 (2010); PLoS One 8 (5) e63047 (2013)). The\n{\\beta}2-{\\alpha}2 loop and the tail of Helix 3 it interacts with have been a\nfocus in prion protein structure studies. For this loop we found a salt bridge\nlinkage ASP177-ARG163 (O-N) (Journal of Theoretical Biology 342 (7 February\n2014) 70-82 (2014)). Some scientists said on the 2FJ3.pdb NMR file of the\nrabbit prion protein, the distance of ASP177-ARG163 (O-N) gives the salt bridge\nof about 10 {\\AA} which is nearly null in terms of energy and such a salt\nbridge is not observed in their work. But, from the 3O79.pdb X-ray file of the\nrabbit prion protein, we can clearly observe this salt bridge. This article\nanalyses the NMR and X-ray structures and gives an answer to the above\nquestion: the salt bridge presents at pH 6.5 in the X-ray structure is simply\ngone at pH 4.5 in the NMR structure is simply due to the different pH values\nthat impact electrostatics at the salt bridge and hence also impact the\nstructures. Moreover, some molecular dynamics simulation results of the X-ray\nstructure are reported in this article to reveal the secrets of the structural\nstability of rabbit prion protein.\n", "  In a recent paper R. Pandharipande, J. Solomon and R. Tessler initiated a\nstudy of the intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with\nboundary. The authors conjectured KdV and Virasoro type equations that\ncompletely determine all intersection numbers. In this paper we study these\nequations in detail. In particular, we prove that the KdV and the Virasoro type\nequations for the intersection numbers on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces\nwith boundary are equivalent.\n", "  Ad-hoc networks are often deployed in regions with complicated boundaries. We\nshow that if the boundary is modeled as a fractal, a network requiring line of\nsight connections has the counterintuitive property that increasing the number\nof nodes decreases the full connection probability. We characterise this decay\nas a stretched exponential involving the fractal dimension of the boundary, and\ndiscuss mitigation strategies. Applications of this study include the analysis\nand design of sensor networks operating in rugged terrain (e.g. railway\ncuttings), mm-wave networks in industrial settings and\nvehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure networks in urban environments.\n", "  The q-deformed entropies of quantum and classical systems are discussed.\nStandard and q-deformed entropic inequalities for X - states of the two-qubit\nand a state of single qudit with $j=3/2$ are presented.\n", "  We present a KL-control treatment of the fundamental problem of erasing a\nbit. We introduce notions of \"reliability\" of information storage via a\nreliability timescale $\\tau_r$, and \"speed\" of erasing via an erasing timescale\n$\\tau_e$. Our problem formulation captures the tradeoff between speed,\nreliability, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost required to erase a bit. We\nshow that rapid erasing of a reliable bit costs at least $\\log 2 - \\log\\left(1\n- \\operatorname{e}^{-\\frac{\\tau_e}{\\tau_r}}\\right) > \\log 2$, which goes to\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\log\\frac{2\\tau_r}{\\tau_e}$ when $\\tau_r>>\\tau_e$.\n", "  Nitrogen hydrides, including ammonia (NH3), hydrazine (N2H4), hydrazoic acid\n(HN3) and etc, are compounds of great fundamental and applied importance. Their\nhigh-pressure behavior is important because of their abundance in giant planets\nand because of the hopes of discoverying high-energy-density materials. Here,\nwe have performed a systematic investi- gation on the structural stability of\nN-H system in a pressure range up to 800 GPa through evolutionary structure\nprediction simulations. Surprisingly, we found that high pressure stabilizes a\nseries of previously unreported compounds with peculiar structural and\nelectronic properties, such as the N4H, N3H, N2H and NH phases composed of\nnitrogen backbones, the N9H4 phase containing two dimensional metallic nitrogen\nplanes and novel N8H, NH2, N3H7, NH4 and NH5 molecular phases. Another surprise\nis that NH3 becomes thermodynamically unstable above ~460 GPa. We found that\nhigh-pressure chemistry is much more diverse that hydrocarbon chemistry at\nnormal conditions, leading to expectations that N-H-O and N-H-O-S systems under\npressure are likely to possess richer chemistry than the known organic\nchemistry. This, in turn, opens a possibility of nitrogen-based life at high\npressure. The predicted phase diagram of the N-H system also provides a\nreference for synthesis of high-energy-density materials.\n", "  We introduce a pair of novel difference equations, whose solutions are\nexpressed in terms of Racah or Wilson polynomials depending on the nature of\nthe finite-difference step. A number of special cases and limit relations are\nalso examined, which allow to introduce similar difference equations for the\northogonal polynomials of the $ _3 F_2$ and $ _2 F_1$ types. It is shown that\nthe introduced equations allow to construct new models of exactly-solvable\nquantum dynamical systems, such as spin chains with a nearest-neighbour\ninteraction and fermionic quantum oscillator models.\n", "  In this paper we study various properties of the double ramification\nhierarchy, an integrable hierarchy of hamiltonian PDEs introduced in [Bur15]\nusing intersection theory of the double ramification cycle in the moduli space\nof stable curves. In particular, we prove a recursion formula that recovers the\nfull hierarchy starting from just one of the Hamiltonians, the one associated\nto the first descendant of the unit of a cohomological field theory. Moreover,\nwe introduce analogues of the topological recursion relations and the divisor\nequation both for the hamiltonian densities and for the string solution of the\ndouble ramification hierarchy. This machinery is very efficient and we apply it\nto various computations for the trivial and Hodge cohomological field theories,\nand for the $r$-spin Witten's classes. Moreover we prove the Miura equivalence\nbetween the double ramification hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy for\nthe Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line (extended Toda\nhierarchy).\n", "  We determine the energy-momentum tensor of non-perfect fluids in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. To this end, we derive the constitutive equations\nfor energy density, isotropic and anisotropic pressure as well as for heat-flux\nfrom the corresponding propagation equations and by drawing on Einstein's\nequations. Following Obukhov at this, we assume the corresponding space-times\nto be conform-stationary and homogeneous. This procedure provides these\nquantities in closed form, i.e., in terms of the structure constants of the\nthree-dimensional isometry group of homogeneity and, respectively, in terms of\nthe kinematical quantities expansion, rotation and acceleration. In particular,\nwe find a generalized form of the Friedmann equations. As special cases we\nrecover Friedmann and G\\\"odel models as well as non-tilted Bianchi solutions\nwith anisotropic pressure. All of our results are derived without assuming any\nequations of state or other specific thermodynamic conditions a priori. For the\nconsidered models, results in literature are generalized to rotating fluids\nwith dissipative fluxes.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied $F(R,T)$ gravity as an arbitrary function of\ncurvature and torsion scalars in Friedmann--Lema\\^{\\i}tre--Robertson--Walker\n(FLRW) background. Then, we have considered interacting model between $F(R,T)$\ngravity and modified Chaplygin gas. The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas. Subsequently, we reconstructed the model by an origin of a\nscalar field entitled quintessence model with a field potential. The field\npotential has been calculated in terms of free parameters of $F(R,T)$ gravity\nand modified Chaplygin gas. In what follows, we used a parametrization, and the\ncosmological parameters have been written in terms of redshift $z$. Next, we\nplotted cosmological parameters with respect to three variable of cosmic time,\nredshift $z$ and $e$-folding number $N=ln(a)$, and the figures showed us an\naccelerated expansion of Universe. Also, we have described the scenario in\nthree status early time, late time and future time by $e$-folding number.\nFinally, the stability of scenario has been investigated by a useful function\nnamed sound speed, and the graph of sound speed versus $e$-folding number has\nbeen showed us that there is the stability in late time.\n", "  Entangled quantum states in high-dimensional space show many advantages\ncompared with entangled states in two-dimensional space. The former enable\nquantum communication with higher channel capacity, enable more efficient\nquantum-information processing, and are more feasible for closing the detection\nloophole in Bell test experiments. Establishing high-dimensional entangled\nmemories is essential for long-distance communication, but its experimental\nrealization is lacking. We experimentally established high-dimensional\nentanglement in orbital angular momentum space between two atomic ensembles\nseparated by 1 m. We reconstructed the density matrix for a three-dimensional\nentanglement and obtained an entanglement fidelity of 83.9+/-2.9%. More\nimportantly, we confirmed the successful preparation of a state entangled in\nmore than three-dimensional space (up to seven-dimensional) using entanglement\nwitnesses. Achieving high-dimensional entanglement represents a significant\nstep towards a high-capacity quantum network.\n", "  We develop a collective field theory for fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\nstates. We show that in the leading approximation for a large number of\nparticles, the properties of Laughlin states are captured by a Gaussian free\nfield theory with a (filling fraction dependent) background charge. Gradient\ncorrections to the Gaussian field theory arise from ultraviolet regularization.\nThey are the origin of the gravitational anomaly and are described by the\nLiouville theory of quantum gravity. The field theory simplifies the\ncomputation of correlation functions in FQH states and makes manifest the\neffect of quantum anomalies.\n", "  Material-based two-level systems (TLSs), appearing as defects in\nlow-temperature devices including superconducting qubits and photon detectors,\nare difficult to characterize. In this study we apply a uniform dc-electric\nfield across a film to tune the energies of TLSs within. The film is embedded\nin a superconducting resonator such that it forms a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamical (cQED) system. The energy of individual TLSs is observed as a\nfunction of the known tuning field. By studying TLSs for which we can determine\nthe tunneling energy, the actual $p_z$, dipole moments projected along the\nuniform field direction, are individually obtained. A distribution is created\nwith 60 $p_z$. We describe the distribution using a model with two dipole\nmoment magnitudes, and a fit yields the corresponding values $p=p_1= 2.8\\pm\n0.2$ Debye and $p=p_2=8.3\\pm0.4$ Debye. For a strong-coupled TLS the\nvacuum-Rabi splitting can be obtained with $p_z$ and tunneling energy. This\nallows a measurement of the circuit's zero-point electric field fluctuations,\nin a method that does not need the electric-field volume.\n", "  We revisit and extend previous calculations of glueball decay rates in the\nSakai-Sugimoto model, a holographic top-down approach for QCD with chiral\nquarks based on D8 probe branes in Witten's holographic model of\nnonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The rates for decays into two pions, two\nvector mesons, four pions, and the strongly suppressed decay into four pi0 are\nworked out quantitatively, using a range of the 't Hooft coupling which closely\nreproduces the decay rate of rho and omega mesons and also leads to a gluon\ncondensate consistent with QCD sum rule calculations. The lowest holographic\nglueball, which arises from a rather exotic polarization of gravitons in the\nsupergravity background, turns out to have a significantly lower mass and\nlarger width than the two widely discussed glueball candidates f0(1500) and\nf0(1710). The lowest nonexotic and predominantly dilatonic scalar mode, which\nhas a mass of 1487 MeV in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, instead provides a\nnarrow glueball state, and we conjecture that only this nonexotic mode should\nbe identified with a scalar glueball component of f0(1500) or f0(1710).\nMoreover the decay pattern of the tensor glueball is determined, which is found\nto have a comparatively broad total width when its mass is adjusted to around\nor above 2 GeV.\n", "  We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) of a strip geometry\nin four dimensional Q-lattice backgrounds, which exhibit metal-insulator\ntransitions in the dual field theory. Remarkably, we find that the HEE always\ndisplays a peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical points. Our model\nprovides the first direct evidence that the HEE can be used to characterize the\nquantum phase transition (QPT). We also conjecture that the maximization\nbehavior of HEE at quantum critical points would be universal in general\nholographic models.\n", "  Natural radioactivity concentrations in high exposure building materials are\ncommonly used in Iran, which is measured a direct exposure by using\n{\\gamma}-ray spectrometry. The values for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were in the\nranges 3.8 - 94.2, 6.5 - 172.2 and 556.9 - 1539.2 Bqkg-1, respectively. The\nabsorbed dose rates in the standard dwelling room due to 238U, 232Th series and\n40K were calculated with MCNPX code. The simulation and experimental results\nwere between 7.95 - 41.74 and 8.36 - 39.99 nGy h-1, respectively. These results\nwere compared with experimental outing and there was overlap closely. The\nsimulation results are able to develop for any kind of dwelling places.\n", "  The phenomenon of quantum steering and probabilistic meaning of the\ncorrelations are discussed for the state of the single qudit. The method of\nqubit portrait of the qudit states is used to extend the known steering\ndetection inequality to the system without subsystems. The example of the\n$X$-state with $j=3/2$ is studied in detail.\n", "  The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process is studied in the presence of strong and\nshort laser pulses. We show that for a relativistically intense plane-wave\nlaser field many features of the momentum distribution of the produced\nelectron-positron pair like its extension, region of highest probability and\ncarrier-envelope phase effects can be explained from the classical evolution of\nthe created particles in the background field. To this end an intuitive\nsemiclassical picture based on the local constant-crossed field approximation\napplied on the probability-amplitude level is established and compared with the\nstandard approach used in QED-PIC codes. The main difference is the\nsubstructure of the spectrum, which results from interference effects between\nmacroscopically separated formation regions. In order to compare the\npredictions of the semiclassical approach with exact calculations, a very fast\nnumerical scheme is introduced. It renders the calculation of the fully\ndifferential spectrum on a grid which resolves all interference fringes\nfeasible. Finally, the difference between classical and quantum absorption of\nlaser four-momentum in the process is pointed out and the dominance of the\nformer is proven. As a self-consistent treatment of the quantum absorption is\nnot feasible within existing QED-PIC approaches, our results provide reliable\nerror estimates relevant for regimes where the laser depletion due to a\ndeveloping QED cascade becomes significant.\n", "  In this paper we define a quantization of the Double Ramification Hierarchies\nof [Bur15b] and [BR14], using intersection numbers of the double ramification\ncycle, the full Chern class of the Hodge bundle and psi-classes with a given\ncohomological field theory. We provide effective recursion formulae which\ndetermine the full quantum hierarchy starting from just one Hamiltonian, the\none associated with the first descendant of the unit of the cohomological field\ntheory only. We study various examples which provide, in very explicit form,\nnew $(1+1)$-dimensional integrable quantum field theories whose classical\nlimits are well-known integrable hierarchies such as KdV, Intermediate Long\nWave, Extended Toda, etc. Finally we prove polynomiality in the ramification\nmultiplicities of the integral of any tautological class over the double\nramification cycle.\n", "  We construct highest-weight modules and a Yangian extension of the centrally\nextended sl(1|1)^2 superalgebra, that is a symmetry of the worldsheet\nscattering associated with the AdS3/CFT3 duality. We demonstrate that the\nR-matrix intertwining atypical modules is of a trigonometric type. We also\nconsider a quantum deformation of this superalgebra, its modules, and obtain a\nquantum affine extension of the Drinfeld-Jimbo type that describes a deformed\nworldsheet scattering.\n", "  The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive function of\nquantum channels, which finds application as an upper bound on the rate at\nwhich secret key and entanglement can be generated when using a quantum channel\na large number of times in addition to unlimited classical communication. This\nquantity has led to an upper bound of $\\log((1+\\eta)/(1-\\eta))$ on the capacity\nof a pure-loss bosonic channel for such a task, where $\\eta$ is the average\nfraction of photons that make it from the input to the output of the channel.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to extend these results beyond the\nsingle-sender single-receiver setting to the more general case of a single\nsender and multiple receivers (a quantum broadcast channel). We employ\nmultipartite generalizations of the squashed entanglement to constrain the\nrates at which secret key and entanglement can be generated between any subset\nof the users of such a channel, along the way developing several new properties\nof these measures. We apply our results to the case of a pure-loss broadcast\nchannel with one sender and two receivers.\n", "  Low carrier mobility and high electrical contact resistance are two major\nobstacles prohibiting explorations of quantum transport in TMDCs. Here, we\ndemonstrate an effective method to establish low-temperature Ohmic contacts in\nboron nitride encapsulated TMDC devices based on selective etching and\nconventional electron-beam evaporation of metal electrodes. This method works\nfor most extensively studied TMDCs in recent years, including MoS2, MoSe2,\nWSe2, WS2, and 2H-MoTe2. Low electrical contact resistance is achieved at 2 K.\nAll of the few-layer TMDC devices studied show excellent performance with\nremarkably improved field-effect mobilities ranging from 2300 cm2/V s to 16000\ncm2/V s, as verified by the high carrier mobilities extracted from Hall effect\nmeasurements. Moreover, both high-mobility n-type and p-type TMDC channels can\nbe realized by simply using appropriate contact metals. Prominent Shubnikov-de\nHaas oscillations have been observed and investigated in these high-quality\nTMDC devices.\n", "  The role of the environment initial conditions in the breaking of the time\nreversal symmetry of effective theories and in generating the soft\nirreversibility is studied by the help of Closed Time Path formalism. The\ninitial conditions break the time reversal symmetry of the solution of the\nequation of motion in a trivial manner. When open systems are considered then\nthe initial conditions of the environment must be included in the effective\ndynamics. This is achieved by means of a generalized $\\epsilon$-prescription\nwhere the non-uniform convergence of the limit $\\epsilon\\to0$ leaves behind a\nspontaneous breakdown of the time reversal symmetry.\n", "  We study monopole operators at the conformal critical point of the\n$\\mathbb{CP}^{N_b - 1}$ theory in $2+1$ spacetime dimensions. Using the\nstate-operator correspondence and a saddle point approximation, we compute the\nscaling dimensions of these operators to next-to-leading order in $1/N_b$. We\nfind remarkable agreement between our results and numerical studies of quantum\nantiferromagnets on two-dimensional lattices with SU($N_b$) global symmetry,\nusing the mapping of the monopole operators to valence bond solid order\nparameters of the lattice antiferromagnet.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like topological excitations in ferromagnets,\nwhich have the topological number $Q=\\pm 1$, and hence show the skyrmion Hall\neffect (SkHE) due to the Magnus force effect originating from the topology.\nHere, we propose the counterpart of the magnetic skyrmion in the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) system, that is, the AFM skyrmion, which is\ntopologically protected but without showing the SkHE. Two approaches for\ncreating the AFM skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice\nsimulations: (i) by injecting a vertical spin-polarized current to a nanodisk\nwith the AFM ground state; (ii) by converting an AFM domain-wall pair in a\nnanowire junction. It is demonstrated that the AFM skyrmion, driven by the\nspin-polarized current, can move straightly over long distance, benefiting from\nthe absence of the SkHE. Our results will open a new strategy on designing the\nnovel spintronic devices based on AFM materials.\n", "  We report structural, magnetic, transport and thermal properties of\nsingle-crystal Ca2Ru1-xIrxO4 (0 < x< 0.65). Ca2RuO4 is a structurally-driven\nMott insulator with a metal-insulator transition at TMI = 357 K, which is well\nseparated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110 K. Substitution of 5d\nelement, Ir, for Ru enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and locking between the\nstructural distortions and magnetic moment canting. In particular, Ir doping\nintensifies the distortion or rotation of Ru/IrO6 octahedra and induces weak\nferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. Moreover, the magnetic ordering\ntemperature TN increases from 110 K at x = 0 to 215 K with enhanced magnetic\nanisotropy at x = 0.65. The effect of Ir doping sharply contrasts with that of\n3d-element doping such as Cr, Mn and Fe, which suppresses TN and induces\nunusual negative volume thermal expansion. The stark difference between 3d- and\n5d-element doping underlines a strong magnetoelastic coupling inherent in the\nIr-rich oxides.\n", "  Plane Poiseuille flow past a nanoscale cylinder that is arbitrarily confined\n(i.e., symmetrically or asymmetrically confined) in a slit channel is studied\nvia hydrodynamic lubrication theory and molecular dynamics simulations,\nconsidering cases where the cylinder remains static or undergoes thermal\nmotion. Lubrication theory predictions for the drag force and volumetric flow\nrate are in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulations of flows having\nmolecularly thin lubrication gaps, despite the presence of significant\nstructural forces induced by the crystalline structure of the modeled solid.\nWhile the maximum drag force is observed in symmetric confinement, i.e., when\nthe cylinder is equidistant from both channel walls, the drag decays\nsignificantly as the cylinder moves away from the channel centerline and\napproaches a wall. Hence, significant reductions in the mean drag force on the\ncylinder and hydraulic resistance of the channel can be observed when thermal\nmotion induces random off-center displacements. Analytical expressions and\nnumerical results in this work provide useful insights into the hydrodynamics\nof colloidal solids and macromolecules in confinement.\n", "  We report thermoelectric power experiments in e-doped thin films of SrTiO$_3$\n(STO) which demonstrate that the electronic band degeneracy can be lifted\nthrough defect management during growth. We show that even small amounts of\ncationic vacancies, combined with epitaxial stress, produce a homogeneous\ntetragonal distortion of the films, resulting in a Kondo-like resistance upturn\nat low temperature, large anisotropic magnetoresistance, and non-linear Hall\neffect. Ab-initio calculations confirm a different occupation of each band\ndepending on the degree of tetragonal distortion. The phenomenology reported in\nthis paper for tetragonally distorted e-doped STO thin films, is similarto that\nobserved in LaAlO$_3$/STO interfaces and magnetic STO quantum wells.\n", "  In this thesis we are interested in the problem of dark energy in cosmology.\nIn particular, we consider the possibility that this effect is due to an\ninfrared non-local modification of the theory of General Relativity. Inspired\nby massive gravity, we construct non-local theories in which gravity may be\nmassive, but where the symmetry of diffeomorphisms is preserved. We focus on\nthe cosmology of these theories and confront them with observational\nconstraints. On a more theoretical level, we discuss some subtleties of\nnon-local field theory and address in a novel way the issue of stability. This\nthesis is based on both published and original work.\n", "  We have studied the exchange corrections to linear electrostatic wave\npropagation in a plasma using a quantum kinetic formalism. Specifically we have\nconsidered the zero temperature limit. In order to simplify the calculations we\nhave focused on the long wavelength limit, i.e. wavelengths much longer than\nthe de Broglie wavelength. For the case of ion-acoustic waves we have\ncalculated the exchange correction both to the damping rate and the real part\nof the frequency. For Langmuir waves the frequency shift due to exchange\neffects is found. Our results are compared with the frequency shifts deduced\nfrom commonly used exchange potentials which are computed from density\nfunctional theory.\n", "  The steering property known for two qubit-state in terms of specific\ninequalities for correlation function is translated for the state of qudit with\nthe spin $j=3/2$. Since most steering detection inequalities are based on the\ncorrelation functions we introduce analogs of such functions for the single\nqudit systems. The tomographic probability representation for the qudit states\nis applied. The connection between the correlation function in two qubit system\nand the single qudit is presented in an integral form with a intertwining\nkernel calculated explicitly in tomographic probability terms.\n", "  In this paper, we examine a flat FLRW spacetime with a scalar field potential\nand show by applying Osgood's criterion to the Einstein field equations that\nall such models, irrespective of the particular choice of potential develop\nfinite-time singularities. That is, we show that solutions to the field\nequations become singular in finite time, which can have important implications\nfor the role of inflation in cosmological models. We further point out that a\npossible reason for this behaviour is that the solutions to the field equations\nin such inflationary scenarios do not obey global existence and uniqueness\nproperties, which is a typical characteristic of solutions that diverge in\nfinite time.\n", "  We study the realistic structure of F-term Nambu-Goto cosmic strings forming\nin a general supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory implementation, assuming\nstandard hybrid inflation. Examining the symmetry breaking of the unification\ngauge group down to the Standard Model, we discuss the minimal field content\nnecessary to describe abelian cosmic strings appearing at the end of inflation.\nWe find that several fields will condense in most theories, questioning the\nplausible occurrence of associated currents (bosonic and fermionic). We\nperturbatively evaluate the modification of their energy per unit length due to\nthe condensates. We provide a criterion for comparing the usual abelian Higgs\napproximation used in cosmology to realistic situations.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that optical wavefront shaping selectively\ncouples light into the fundamental diffusion mode of a scattering medium. The\ntotal energy density inside a scattering medium of zinc oxide (ZnO)\nnanoparticles was probed by measuring the emitted fluorescent power of spheres\nthat were randomly positioned inside the medium. The fluorescent power of an\noptimized incident wave front is observed to be enhanced compared to a\nnon-optimized incident front. The observed enhancement increases with sample\nthickness. Based on diffusion theory, we derive a model wherein the\ndistribution of energy density of wavefront-shaped light is described by the\nfundamental diffusion mode. The agreement between our model and the data is\nstriking not in the least since there are no adjustable parameters. Enhanced\ntotal energy density is crucial to increase the efficiency of white LEDs, solar\ncells, and of random lasers, as well as to realize controlled illumination in\nbiomedical optics.\n", "  The heterotic--string models in the free fermionic formulation gave rise to\nsome of the most realistic string models to date, which possess N=1 spacetime\nsupersymmetry. Lack of evidence for supersymmetry at the LHC instigated recent\ninterest in non-supersymmetric heterotic-string vacua. We explore what may be\nlearned in this context from the quasi--realistic free fermionic models. We\nshow that constructions with a low number of families give rise to\nproliferation of a priori tachyon producing sectors, compared to the\nnon--realistic examples, which typically may contain only one such sector. The\nreason being that in the realistic cases the internal six dimensional space is\nfragmented into smaller units. We present one example of a quasi--realistic,\nnon--supersymmetric, non--tachyonic, heterotic--string vacuum and compare the\nstructure of its massless spectrum to the corresponding supersymmetric vacuum.\nWhile in some sectors supersymmetry is broken explicitly, i.e. the bosonic and\nfermionic sectors produce massless and massive states, other sectors, and in\nparticular those leading to the chiral families, continue to exhibit fermi-bose\ndegeneracy. In these sectors the massless spectrum, as compared to the\nsupersymmetric cases, will only differ in some local or global U(1) charges. We\ndiscuss the conditions for obtaining $n_b=n_f$ at the massless level in these\nmodels. Our example model contains an anomalous U(1) symmetry, which generates\na tadpole diagram at one loop-order in string perturbation theory. We speculate\nthat this tadpole diagram may cancel the corresponding diagram generated by the\none-loop non-vanishing vacuum energy and that in this respect the\nsupersymmetric and non-supersymmetric vacua should be regarded on equal\nfooting. Finally we discuss vacua that contain two supersymmetry generating\nsectors.\n", "  While band insulators are usually described in wavevector space in terms of\nfully filled bands, they are sometimes also described in terms of a\ncomplementary Wannier picture in which electrons occupy localized, atom-like\norbitals. Under what conditions does the latter picture break down? The\npresence of irremovable quantum entanglement between different sites can\nobstruct a localized orbital description, which occurs in systems like Chern\nand topological insulators. We collectively refer to such states as Quantum\nBand Insulators (QBIs). Here we report the theoretical discovery of a\nfilling-enforced QBI - that is, a free electron insulator in which the band\nfilling is smaller than the minimum number dictated by the atomic picture.\nConsequently such insulators have no representation in terms of filling\nlocalized orbitals and must be QBIs. This is shown to occur in models of\ncertain cubic crystals with non-symmorphic space groups. Like topological\ninsulators, filling-enforced QBIs require spin-orbit coupling. However, in\ncontrast, they do not typically exhibit protected surface states. Instead their\nnontrivial nature is revealed by studying the quantum entanglement of their\nground state wavefunction.\n", "  We propose that dark energy in the form of a scalar field could effectively\ncouple to dark matter inhomogeneities. Through this coupling energy could be\ntransferred to/from the scalar field, which could possibly enter an accelerated\nregime. Though phenomenological, this scenario is interesting as it provides a\nnatural trigger for the onset of the acceleration of the universe, since dark\nenergy starts driving the expansion of the universe when matter inhomogeneities\nbecome sufficiently strong. Here we study a possible realization of this idea\nby coupling dark energy to dark matter via the linear growth function of matter\nperturbations. The numerical results show that it is indeed possible to obtain\na viable cosmology with the expected series of radiation, matter and\ndark-energy dominated eras. In particular, the current density of dark energy\nis given by the value of the coupling parameters rather than by very special\ninitial conditions for the scalar field. In other words, this model - unlike\nstandard models of cosmic late acceleration - does not suffer from the\nso-called \"coincidence problem\" and its related fine tuning of initial\nconditions.\n", "  The use of science to understand its own structure is becoming popular, but\nunderstanding the organization of knowledge areas is still limited because some\npatterns are only discoverable with proper computational treatment of\nlarge-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a network-based methodology\ncombined with text analytics to construct the taxonomy of science fields. The\nmethodology is illustrated with application to two topics: complex networks\n(CN) and photonic crystals (PC). We built citation networks using data from the\nWeb of Science and used a community detection algorithm for partitioning to\nobtain science maps of the fields considered. We also created an importance\nindex for text analytics in order to obtain keywords that define the\ncommunities. A dendrogram of the relatedness among the subtopics was also\nobtained. Among the interesting patterns that emerged from the analysis, we\nhighlight the identification of two well-defined communities in PC area, which\nis consistent with the known existence of two distinct communities of\nresearchers in the area: telecommunication engineers and physicists. With the\nmethodology, it was also possible to assess the interdisciplinary and time\nevolution of subtopics defined by the keywords. The automatic tools described\nhere are potentially useful not only to provide an overview of scientific areas\nbut also to assist scientists in performing systematic research on a specific\ntopic.\n", "  It is shown that the de Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick\nrotation. In imaginary time, super- horizon quantum and classical metric\nfluctuations of the empty FLRW space (with no matter fields) form a\nself-consistent de Sitter state. The invariance with respect to Wick rotation\nsuggests that this de Sitter state is formed also in the empty space of real\ntime. At the start and by the end of its cosmological evolution the Universe is\nempty, so that the de Sitter expansion of the empty space can be the cause of\ninflation and dark energy. This scenario is consistent with the existing\nobservational data\n", "  We develop an accurate finite-time scaling analysis of the angular width of\nthe coherent backscattering (CBS) peak for waves propagating in 3D random\nmedia. Applying this method to ultracold atoms in optical speckle potentials,\nwe show how to determine both the mobility edge and the critical exponent of\nthe Anderson transition from the temporal behavior of the CBS width. Our method\ncould be used in experiments to fully characterize the 3D Anderson transition.\n", "  Theoretical analysis and fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations\nreveal a Brownian ratchet mechanism by which thermal fluctuations drive the net\ndisplacement of immiscible liquids confined in channels or pores with micro- or\nnanoscale dimensions. The thermally-driven displacement is induced by surface\nnanostructures with directional asymmetry and can occur against the direction\nof action of wetting or capillary forces. Mean displacement rates in molecular\ndynamics simulations are predicted via analytical solution of a Smoluchowski\ndiffusion equation for the position probability density. The proposed physical\nmechanisms and derived analytical expressions can be applied to engineer\nsurface nanostructures for controlling the dynamics of diverse wetting\nprocesses such as capillary filling, wicking, and imbibition in micro- or\nnanoscale systems.\n", "  The maximal analytic Schwarzschild spacetime is manifestly inextendible as a\nLorentzian manifold with a twice continuously differentiable metric. In this\npaper, we prove the stronger statement that it is even inextendible as a\nLorentzian manifold with a continuous metric. To capture the obstruction to\ncontinuous extensions through the curvature singularity, we introduce the\nnotion of the spacelike diameter of a globally hyperbolic region of a\nLorentzian manifold with a merely continuous metric and give a sufficient\ncondition for the spacelike diameter to be finite. The investigation of\nlow-regularity inextendibility criteria is motivated by the strong cosmic\ncensorship conjecture.\n", "  The Berry phase has found applications in building topological order\nparameters for certain condensed matter systems. The question whether some\ngeometric phase for mixed states can serve the same purpose has been raised,\nand proposals are on the table. We analyze the intricate behaviour of Uhlmann's\ngeometric phase in the Kitaev chain at finite temperature, and then argue that\nit captures quite different physics from that intended. We also analyze the\nbehaviour of a geometric phase introduced in the context of interferometry. For\nthe Kitaev chain, this phase closely mirrors that of the Berry phase, and we\nargue that it merits further investigation.\n", "  We introduce a program aimed to studying problems arising from the theory of\ncomplex networks with differential geometric means. We study the propagation of\ninfluences on manifolds assuming that at each point only a finite number of\npropagation velocities are allowed. This leads to the computation of the volume\nof the moduli spaces of directed paths, i.e. paths satisfying the imposed\ntangential restrictions. The proposed settings provide a fertile ground for\nresearch with potential applications in geometry, mathematical physics,\ndifferential equations, and combinatorics. We establish the general framework,\ndevelop its structural properties, and consider a few basic examples of\nrelevance. The interaction between differential geometry and complex networks\nis a new and promising field of study.\n", "  We investigate the classical Renyi entropy S_n and the associated mutual\ninformation I_n in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (S-K) model, which is the\nparadigm model of mean-field spin glasses. Using classical Monte Carlo\nsimulations and analytical tools we investigate the S-K model on the n-sheets\nbooklet. This is obtained by gluing together n independent copies of the model,\nand it is the main ingredient to construct the Renyi entanglement-related\nquantities. We find a glassy phase at low temperature, whereas at high\ntemperature the model exhibits paramagnetic behavior, consistent with the\nregular S-K model. The temperature of the paramagnetic-glassy transition\ndepends non-trivially on the geometry of the booklet. At high-temperatures we\nprovide the exact solution of the model by exploiting the replica symmetry.\nThis is the permutation symmetry among the fictitious replicas that are used to\nperform disorder averages (via the replica trick). In the glassy phase the\nreplica symmetry has to be broken. Using a generalization of the Parisi\nsolution, we provide analytical results for S_n and I_n, and for standard\nthermodynamic quantities. Both S_n and I_n exhibit a volume law in the whole\nphase diagram. We characterize the behavior of the corresponding densities\nS_n/N, I_n/N, in the thermodynamic limit. Interestingly, at the critical point\nthe mutual information does not exhibit any crossing for different system\nsizes, in contrast with local spin models.\n", "  In the comment of Avelino, Sousa and Lobo [arXiv:1506.06028], it is argued,\nby comparing the kinetic energy of a topological defect with the overall energy\nof a pulsar, that the origin of the pulsar glitch phenomenon due to the passage\nof networks of topological defects through pulsars is faced with serious\ndifficulties. Here, we point out that topological defects may trigger pulsar\nglitches within traditional scenarios, such as vortex unpinning. If the energy\ntransfer from a topological defect exceeds the activation energy for a single\npinned vortex, this may lead to an avalanche of unpinning of vortices and\nconsequently a pulsar glitch, and therefore the source of angular momentum and\nenergy required for a glitch event is provided by the pulsar itself. Indeed,\nthe activation energy for such a process can be very small (essentially zero\ncompared with the observed increase in the pulsar's rotational kinetic energy\nat the onset of a glitch). The unpinning of a vortex by a topological defect\nmay occur through the passage of the defect into the core of the pulsar.\n", "  We classify all pairs of recurrence relations in which two Hahn or dual Hahn\npolynomials with different parameters appear. Such couples are referred to as\n(dual) Hahn doubles. The idea and interest comes from an example appearing in a\nfinite oscillator model [Jafarov E.I., Stoilova N.I., Van der Jeugt J., J.\nPhys. A: Math. Theor. 44 (2011), 265203, 15 pages, arXiv:1101.5310]. Our\nclassification shows there exist three dual Hahn doubles and four Hahn doubles.\nThe same technique is then applied to Racah polynomials, yielding also four\ndoubles. Each dual Hahn (Hahn, Racah) double gives rise to an explicit new set\nof symmetric orthogonal polynomials related to the Christoffel and Geronimus\ntransformations. For each case, we also have an interesting class of\ntwo-diagonal matrices with closed form expressions for the eigenvalues. This\nextends the class of Sylvester-Kac matrices by remarkable new test matrices. We\nexamine also the algebraic relations underlying the dual Hahn doubles, and\ndiscuss their usefulness for the construction of new finite oscillator models.\n", "  We investigate relations between elliptic multiple zeta values and describe a\nmethod to derive the number of indecomposable elements of given weight and\nlength. Our method is based on representing elliptic multiple zeta values as\niterated integrals over Eisenstein series and exploiting the connection with a\nspecial derivation algebra. Its commutator relations give rise to constraints\non the iterated integrals over Eisenstein series relevant for elliptic multiple\nzeta values and thereby allow to count the indecomposable representatives.\nConversely, the above connection suggests apparently new relations in the\nderivation algebra. Under https://tools.aei.mpg.de/emzv we provide relations\nfor elliptic multiple zeta values over a wide range of weights and lengths.\n", "  We study the formation of bright solitons in the impurity component of\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC)-impurity mixture by using the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. While we assume the boson-boson and\nimpurity-boson interactions to be effectively repulsive, their character can be\nchanged spontaneously from repulsive to attractive in the presence of strong\nanomalous correlations. In such a regime the impurity component becomes a\nsystem of effectively attractive atoms leading automatically to the generation\nof bright solitons. We find that this soliton decays at higher temperatures due\nto the dissipation induced by the impurity-host and host-host interactions. We\nshow that after a sudden increase of the impurity-boson strength a train of\nbright solitons is produced and this can be interpreted in terms of the\nmodulational instability (MI) of the time-dependent impurity wave function.\n", "  We study the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in a slab-type\nwaveguide which walls consist of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D\nTI). The results show that a cutoff frequency with topological stability limits\nthe spectrum that propagates along the waveguide and are in agreement with\nexperimental observations. Our approach also provides a way to measure the\npenetration length of surface metallic states in 3D TI.\n", "  Synchronization is an important and prevalent phenomenon in natural and\nengineered systems. In many dynamical networks, the coupling is balanced or\nadjusted in order to admit global synchronization, a condition called Laplacian\ncoupling. Many networks exhibit incomplete synchronization, where two or more\nclusters of synchronization persist, and computational group theory has\nrecently proved to be valuable in discovering these cluster states based upon\nthe topology of the network. In the important case of Laplacian coupling,\nadditional synchronization patterns can exist that would not be predicted from\nthe group theory analysis alone. The understanding of how and when clusters\nform, merge, and persist is essential for understanding collective dynamics,\nsynchronization, and failure mechanisms of complex networks such as electric\npower grids, distributed control networks, and autonomous swarming vehicles. We\ndescribe here a method to find and analyze all of the possible cluster\nsynchronization patterns in a Laplacian-coupled network, by applying methods of\ncomputational group theory to dynamically-equivalent networks. We present a\ngeneral technique to evaluate the stability of each of the dynamically valid\ncluster synchronization patterns. Our results are validated in an electro-optic\nexperiment on a 5 node network that confirms the synchronization patterns\npredicted by the theory.\n", "  The fluctuations exhibited by the cross-sections generated in a\ncompound-nucleus reaction or, more generally, in a quantum-chaotic scattering\nprocess, when varying the excitation energy or another external parameter, are\ncharacterized by the width Gamma_corr of the cross-section correlation\nfunction. In 1963 Brink and Stephen [Phys. Lett. 5, 77 (1963)] proposed a\nmethod for its determination by simply counting the number of maxima featured\nby the cross sections as function of the parameter under consideration. They,\nactually, stated that the product of the average number of maxima per unit\nenergy range and Gamma_corr is constant in the Ercison region of strongly\noverlapping resonances. We use the analogy between the scattering formalism for\ncompound-nucleus reactions and for microwave resonators to test this method\nexperimentally with unprecedented accuracy using large data sets and propose an\nanalytical description for the regions of isolated and overlapping resonances.\n", "  If advanced civilizations appear in the universe with an ability and desire\nto expand, the entire universe can become saturated with life on a short\ntimescale, even if such expanders appear rarely. Our presence in an apparently\nuntouched Milky Way thus constrains the appearance rate of galaxy-spanning\nKardashev type III (K3) civilizations, if it is assumed that some fraction of\nK3 civilizations will continue their expansion at intergalactic distances. We\nuse this constraint to estimate the appearance rate of K3 civilizations for 81\ncosmological scenarios by specifying the extent to which humanity is a\nstatistical outlier. We find that in nearly all plausible scenarios, the\ndistance to the nearest visible K3 is cosmological. In searches for K3 galaxies\nwhere the observable range is limited, we also find that the most likely\ndetections tend to be expanding civilizations who have entered the observable\nrange from farther away. An observation of K3 clusters is thus more likely than\nisolated K3 galaxies.\n", "  In quantum simulation, many-body phenomena are probed in controllable quantum\nsystems. Recently, simulation of Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians using cold atoms\nrevealed previously hidden local correlations. However, fermionic many-body\nHubbard phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and spin liquids are\nmore difficult to simulate using cold atoms. To date the required single-site\nmeasurements and cooling remain problematic, while only ensemble measurements\nhave been achieved. Here we simulate a two-site Hubbard Hamiltonian at low\neffective temperatures with single-site resolution using subsurface dopants in\nsilicon. We measure quasiparticle tunneling maps of spin-resolved states with\natomic resolution, finding interference processes from which the entanglement\nentropy and Hubbard interactions are quantified. Entanglement, determined by\nspin and orbital degrees of freedom, increases with increasing covalent bond\nlength. We find separation-tunable Hubbard interaction strengths that are\nsuitable for simulating strongly correlated phenomena in larger arrays of\ndopants, establishing dopants as a platform for quantum simulation of the\nHubbard model.\n", "  We propose a cold atom implementation to attain the continuum limit of\n(1+1)-d CP(N-1) quantum field theories. These theories share important features\nwith (3+1)-d QCD, such as asymptotic freedom and $\\theta$ vacua. Moreover,\ntheir continuum limit can be accessed via the mechanism of dimensional\nreduction. In our scheme, the CP(N-1) degrees of freedom emerge at low energies\nfrom a ladder system of SU(N) quantum spins, where the N spin states are\nembodied by the nuclear Zeeman states of alkaline-earth atoms, trapped in an\noptical lattice. Based on Monte Carlo results, we establish that the continuum\nlimit can be demonstrated by an atomic quantum simulation by employing the\nfeature of asymptotic freedom. We discuss a protocol for the adiabatic state\npreparation of the ground state of the system, the real-time evolution of a\nfalse $\\theta$-vacuum state after a quench, and we propose experiments to\nunravel the phase diagram at non-zero density.\n", "  For fifty years, cosmic-ray air showers have been detected by their radio\nemission. We present the first laboratory measurements that validate\nelectrodynamics simulations used in air shower modeling. An experiment at SLAC\nprovides a beam test of radio-frequency (RF) radiation from charged particle\ncascades in the presence of a magnetic field, a model system of a cosmic-ray\nair shower. This experiment provides a suite of controlled laboratory\nmeasurements to compare to particle-level simulations of RF emission, which are\nrelied upon in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air shower detection. We compare\nsimulations to data for intensity, linearity with magnetic field, angular\ndistribution, polarization, and spectral content. In particular, we confirm\nmodern predictions that the magnetically induced emission in a dielectric forms\na cone that peaks at the Cherenkov angle and show that the simulations\nreproduce the data within systematic uncertainties.\n", "  This work deals with the position control of selected patterns in\nreaction-diffusion systems. Exemplarily, the Schl\\\"{o}gl and FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel are discussed using three different approaches. First, an analytical\nsolution is proposed. Second, the standard optimal control procedure is\napplied. The third approach extends standard optimal control to so-called\nsparse optimal control that results in very localized control signals and\nallows the analysis of second order optimality conditions.\n", "  We study the linear statistics of the circular $\\beta$-ensemble with a\nStein's method argument, where the exchangeable pair is generated through\ncircular Dyson Brownian motion. This generalizes previous results obtained in\nsuch a way for the CUE and provides a novel approach for studying linear\nstatistics of $\\beta$-ensembles. This approach allows studying simultaneously a\ncollection of linear statistics whose number grows with the dimension of the\nensemble. Also this approach requires estimating only low order moments of the\nlinear statistics.\n", "  \\textit{Ab initio} calculations have been performed on hexagonal layers of\nM$_2$O$_3$ (M being several transition metals of the $5d$ series) sandwiched by\na band insulator such as Al$_2$O$_3$ that provides the honeycomb lattice where\nthe $5d$ electrons reside. This corundum-structure-based superlattice is the\nmost obvious way to design a honeycomb lattice with transition metal cations\navoiding the use of largely polar surfaces. We obtain that this system supports\nthe presence of Dirac cones at the Fermi level that open up with the\nintroduction of spin-orbit coupling at various fillings of the $5d$ band. The\nDFT calculations performed in this work show that the $5d^5$ situation is\nalways a trivial insulator, whereas the $5d^8$ filling presents topological\ninsulating configurations which evolve into a trivial state with increasing\ntensile strain or on-site Coulomb potential U. However, LDA+U calculations show\na stable antiferromagnetic solution for the $5d^8$ case at every U value, which\nwould break time reversal symmetry and could affect the topological properties\nof the system. We also discuss the similarities with the buckled honeycomb\nlattice obtained using perovskite (111) bilayers previously studied in\nliterature, in particular for the $5d^5$ and $5d^8$ configurations. This work\nprovides some clues on the stability of topological phases using metal oxides\nin general.\n", "  We explore the crucial role of relative space-time positioning between the\ntwo detectors in an operational two-party entanglement-harvesting protocol.\nSpecifically we show that the protocol is robust if imprecision in spatial\npositioning and clock synchronization are much smaller than the spatial\nseparation between the detectors and its light-crossing time thereof. This in\nprinciple guarantees robustness if the imprecision is comparable to a few times\nthe size of the detectors, which suggests entanglement harvesting could be\nexplored for tabletop experiments. On the other hand, keeping the effects of\nthis imprecision under control would be demanding on astronomical scales.\n", "  Zero-dimensional dissipative action possesses non-trivial minima known as\nKorshunov instantons. They have been known so far only for imaginary time\nrepresentation that is limited to equilibrium systems. In this work we\nreconstruct and generalise Korshunov instantons using real-time Keldysh\napproach. This allows us to formulate the dissipative action theory for generic\nnon-equilibrium conditions. Possible applications of the theory to transport in\nstrongly biased quantum dots are discussed..\n", "  Intracellular positive ions neutralise negative charges on the phosphates of\na DNA strand conferring greater strength on the hydrogen bonds that connect\ncomplementary strands into a double helix and so confer enhanced stability.\nBeyond a certain value of salt concentration, the DNA molecule displays a\nunstable nature {\\it in vivo} as well as {\\it in vitro}. We consider a wide\nrange of salt concentrations and study the stability of the DNA double helix\nusing a statistical model. Through numerical calculations we attempt to explain\nthe different behaviour exhibited by DNA molecules in this range. We compare\nour results with experimental data and find a close agreement.\n", "  We evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of two quantum repeater\nprotocols with an existing experimental platform based on a $^{40}$Ca$^+$-ion\nin a segmented micro trap, and a third one that requires small changes to the\nplatform. A fiber cavity serves as an ion-light interface. Its small mode\nvolume allows for a large coupling strength of $g_c = 2 \\pi 20$ MHz despite\ncomparatively large losses $\\kappa = 2 \\pi 36.6$ MHz. With a fiber diameter of\n125 mu m, the cavity is integrated into the microstructured ion trap, which in\nturn is used to transport single ions in and out of the interaction zone in the\nfiber cavity. We evaluate the entanglement generation rate for a given fidelity\nusing parameters from the experimental setup. The DLCZ protocol (Duan et al,\nNature, 2001, 414, 413-418) and the hybrid protocol (van Loock et al, Phys.\nRev. Lett., 2006, 96, 240501) outperform the EPR protocol (Sanguard et al, New\nJ. Phys., 2013, 15, 085004). We calculate rates of more than than 35 s$^{-1}$\nfor non-local Bell state fidelities larger than 0.9 with the existing platform.\nWe identify parameters which mainly limit the attainable rates, and conclude\nthat entanglement generation rates of 740 s$^{-1}$ at fidelities of 0.9 are\nwithin reach with current technology.\n", "  A scaling theory of long-wavelength electrostatic turbulence in a magnetised,\nweakly collisional plasma (e.g., ITG turbulence) is proposed, with account\ntaken both of the nonlinear advection of the perturbed particle distribution by\nfluctuating ExB flows and of its phase mixing, which is caused by the streaming\nof the particles along the mean magnetic field and, in a linear problem, would\nlead to Landau damping. It is found that it is possible to construct a\nconsistent theory in which very little free energy leaks into high velocity\nmoments of the distribution function, rendering the turbulent cascade in the\nenergetically relevant part of the wave-number space essentially fluid-like.\nThe velocity-space spectra of free energy expressed in terms of Hermite-moment\norders are steep power laws and so the free-energy content of the phase space\ndoes not diverge at infinitesimal collisionality (while it does for a linear\nproblem); collisional heating due to long-wavelength perturbations vanishes in\nthis limit (also in contrast with the linear problem, in which it occurs at the\nfinite rate equal to the Landau-damping rate). The ability of the free energy\nto stay in the low velocity moments of the distribution function is facilitated\nby the \"anti-phase-mixing\" effect, whose presence in the nonlinear system is\ndue to the stochastic version of the plasma echo (the advecting velocity\ncouples the phase-mixing and anti-phase-mixing perturbations). The partitioning\nof the wave-number space between the (energetically dominant) region where this\nis the case and the region where linear phase mixing wins its competition with\nnonlinear advection is governed by the \"critical balance\" between linear and\nnonlinear timescales (which for high Hermite moments splits into two\nthresholds, one demarcating the wave-number region where phase mixing\npredominates, the other where plasma echo does).\n", "  We propose a new model in the teleparallel framework where we consider a\nscalar field nonminimally coupled to both the torsion $T$ and a boundary term\ngiven by the divergence of the torsion vector $B=\\frac{2}{e}\\partial_\\mu\n(eT^\\mu)$. This is inspired by the relation $R=-T+B$ between the Ricci scalar\nof general relativity and the torsion of teleparallel gravity. This theory in\nsuitable limits incorporates both the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to\ntorsion, and the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci scalar. We\nanalyse the cosmology of such models, and we perform a dynamical systems\nanalysis on the case when we have only a pure coupling to the boundary term. It\nis found that the system generically evolves to a late time accelerating\nattractor solution without requiring any fine tuning of the parameters. A\ndynamical crossing of the phantom barrier is also shown to be possible.\n", "  There are a wide variety of different vector formalisms currently utilized in\nengineering and physics. For example, Gibbs' three-vectors, Minkowski\nfour-vectors, complex spinors in quantum mechanics, quaternions used to\ndescribe rigid body rotations and vectors defined in Clifford geometric\nalgebra. With such a range of vector formalisms in use, it thus appears that\nthere is as yet no general agreement on a vector formalism suitable for science\nas a whole. This is surprising, in that, one of the primary goals of nineteenth\ncentury science was to suitably describe vectors in three-dimensional space.\nThis situation has also had the unfortunate consequence of fragmenting\nknowledge across many disciplines, and requiring a significant amount of time\nand effort in learning the various formalisms. We thus historically review the\ndevelopment of our various vector systems and conclude that Clifford's\nmultivectors best fulfills the goal of describing vectorial quantities in three\ndimensions and providing a unified vector system for science.\n", "  Dark matter in the sub-GeV mass range is a theoretically motivated but\nlargely unexplored paradigm. Such light masses are out of reach for\nconventional nuclear recoil direct detection experiments, but may be detected\nthrough the small ionization signals caused by dark matter-electron scattering.\nSemiconductors are well-studied and are particularly promising target materials\nbecause their ${\\cal O}(1~\\rm{eV})$ band gaps allow for ionization signals from\ndark matter as light as a few hundred keV. Current direct detection\ntechnologies are being adapted for dark matter-electron scattering. In this\npaper, we provide the theoretical calculations for dark matter-electron\nscattering rate in semiconductors, overcoming several complications that stem\nfrom the many-body nature of the problem. We use density functional theory to\nnumerically calculate the rates for dark matter-electron scattering in silicon\nand germanium, and estimate the sensitivity for upcoming experiments such as\nDAMIC and SuperCDMS. We find that the reach for these upcoming experiments has\nthe potential to be orders of magnitude beyond current direct detection\nconstraints and that sub-GeV dark matter has a sizable modulation signal. We\nalso give the first direct detection limits on sub-GeV dark matter from its\nscattering off electrons in a semiconductor target (silicon) based on published\nresults from DAMIC. We make available publicly our code, QEdark, with which we\ncalculate our results. Our results can be used by experimental collaborations\nto calculate their own sensitivities based on their specific setup. The\nsearches we propose will probe vast new regions of unexplored dark matter model\nand parameter space.\n", "  The vulnerability to single-detector instrumental artifacts in standard\ndetection methods for long-duration quasimonochromatic gravitational waves from\nnonaxisymmetric rotating neutron stars [continuous waves (CWs)] was addressed\nin past work [D. Keitel et al., Phys. Rev. D 89, 064023 (2014).] by a Bayesian\napproach. An explicit model of persistent single-detector disturbances led to a\ngeneralized detection statistic with improved robustness against such\nartifacts. Since many strong outliers in semicoherent searches of LIGO data are\ncaused by transient disturbances that last only a few hours, we extend the\nnoise model to cover such limited-duration disturbances, and demonstrate\nincreased robustness in realistic simulated data. Besides long-duration CWs,\nneutron stars could also emit transient signals which, for a limited time, also\nfollow the CW signal model (tCWs). As a pragmatic alternative to specialized\ntransient searches, we demonstrate how to make standard semicoherent CW\nsearches more sensitive to transient signals. Considering tCWs in a single\nsegment of a semicoherent search, Bayesian model selection yields a new\ndetection statistic that does not add significant computational cost. On\nsimulated data, we find that it increases sensitivity towards tCWs, even of\nvarying durations, while not sacrificing sensitivity to classical CW signals,\nand still being robust to transient or persistent single-detector instrumental\nartifacts.\n", "  HERD is the High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection instrument proposed to\noperate onboard China's space station in the 2020s. It is designed to detect\nenergetic cosmic ray nuclei, leptons and photons with a high energy resolution\n($\\sim1\\%$ for electrons and photons and $20\\%$ for nuclei) and a large\ngeometry factor ($>3\\,{ m^2\\,sr}$ for electrons and diffuse photons and $>2\\,{\nm^2\\,sr}$ for nuclei). In this work we discuss the capability of HERD to detect\nmonochromatic $\\gamma$-ray lines, based on simulations of the detector\nperformance. It is shown that HERD will be one of the most sensitive\ninstruments for monochromatic $\\gamma$-ray searches at energies between\n$\\sim10$ to a few hundred GeV. Above hundreds of GeV, Cherenkov telescopes will\nbe more sensitive due to their large effective area. As a specific example, we\nshow that a good portion of the parameter space of a supersymmetric dark matter\nmodel can be probed with HERD.\n", "  In many urban areas of the developing world, piped water is supplied only\nintermittently, as valves direct water to different parts of the water\ndistribution system at different times. The flow is transient, and may\ntransition between free-surface and pressurized, resulting in complex dynamical\nfeatures with important consequences for water suppliers and users. Here, we\ndevelop a computational model of transition, transient pipe flow in a network,\naccounting for a wide variety of realistic boundary conditions. We validate the\nmodel against several published data sets, and demonstrate its use on a real\npipe network. The model is extended to consider several optimization problems\nmotivated by realistic scenarios. We demonstrate how to infer water flow in a\nsmall pipe network from a single pressure sensor, and show how to control water\ninflow to minimize damaging pressure gradients.\n", "  Superconducting microresonators have been successfully utilized as detection\nelements for a wide variety of applications. With multiplexing factors\nexceeding 1,000 detectors per transmission line, they are the most scalable\nlow-temperature detector technology demonstrated to date. For high-throughput\napplications, fewer detectors can be coupled to a single wire but utilize a\nlarger per-detector bandwidth. For all existing designs, fluctuations in\nfabrication tolerances result in a non-uniform shift in resonance frequency and\nsensitivity, which ultimately limits the efficiency of band-width utilization.\nHere we present the design, implementation, and initial characterization of a\nsuperconducting microresonator readout integrating two tunable inductances per\ndetector. We demonstrate that these tuning elements provide independent control\nof both the detector frequency and sensitivity, allowing us to maximize the\ntransmission line bandwidth utilization. Finally we discuss the integration of\nthese detectors in a multilayer fabrication stack for high-speed readout of the\nD-Wave quantum processor, highlighting the use of control and routing circuitry\ncomposed of single flux-quantum loops to minimize the number of control wires\nat the lowest temperature stage.\n", "  Entanglement temperature is an interesting quantity which relates the\nincreased amount of entanglement entropy and energy for a weakly excited state\nin entanglement first-law, it is proportional to the inverse of the size of the\nentanglement subsystem and only depends on the shape of the entanglement\nregion. We find the explicit formula of entanglement temperature for the\ngeneral hyperscaling violation backgrounds with a strip-subsystem. We then\ninvestigate the entanglement temperature for a round ball-subsystem, we check\nthat the entanglement temperature have a universal form when the hyperscaling\nviolation exponent is near zero.\n", "  The field of a moving pointlike charge is determined in nonlinear local\nelectrodynamics. As a model Lagrangian for the latter we take the one whose\nnonlinearity is the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics\ntruncated at the leading term of its expansion in powers of the first field\ninvariant. The total energy of the field produced by a point charge is finite\nin that model; thereby its field configuration is a soliton. We define a finite\nenergy-momentum vector of this field configuration to demonstrate that its\ncomponents satisfy the standard mechanical relation characteristic of a free\nmoving massive particle.\n", "  Driving existing materials to exhibit topologically nontrivial state is of\nboth scientific and technological interests. Using first-principle\ncalculations, we propose the first demonstration of electron doping induced\nmultiple quantum phase transition in a single material of the organometallic\nframework, HTT-Pt, which has been synthesized by reacting triphenylene\nhexathiol molecules (HTT) with PtCl2. At low elec-tron doping, the HTT-Pt\nconverts from a normal insulator to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator with\ntime-reversal symmetry (TRS). At high electron doping, the TRS is further\nbroken making the HTT-Pt a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator. The\ntopologically nontrivial band gap of the electron-doped HTT-Pt opened by\nintrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can be as large as 44.5 meV, which is\npromising for realizing these quantum phases at high temperatures. The\npossibility of switching between the QSH and QAH states offers an intriguing\nplatform for new device paradigm by interfacing between a QSH and QAH state.\n", "  Sr2IrO4 is a magnetic insulator assisted by strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nwhereas the Sr2RuO4 is a p-wave superconductor. The contrasting ground states\nhave been shown to result from the critical role of the strong SOC in the\niridate. Our investigation of structural, transport, and magnetic properties\nreveals that substituting 4d Ru4+ (4d4) ions for 5d Ir4+(5d5) ions in Sr2IrO4\ndirectly adds holes to the t2g bands, reduces the SOC and thus rebalances the\ncompeting energies in single-crystal Sr2Ir1-xRuxO4. A profound effect of Ru\ndoping driving a rich phase diagram is a structural phase transition from a\ndistorted I41/acd to a more ideal I4/mmm tetragonal structure near x=0.50 that\naccompanies a phase transition from an antiferromagnetic-insulating state to a\nparamagnetic-metal state. We also make a comparison drawn with Rh doped\nSr2IrO4, highlighting important similarities and differences.\n", "  We sudy the impact of a weak random potential with a Gaussian correlation\nfunction on the thermodynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) dipolar bosonic gas.\nAnalytical expressions for the quantum depletion, anomalous density, the ground\nstate energy, the equation of state and the sound velocity are derived in the\nroton regime within the framework of the Bogoliubov theory. Surprisingly, we\nfind that the condensate depletion and the anomalous density are comparable.\nThe structure factor and the superfluid fraction are also obtained analytically\nand numerically. We show that these quantities acquire dramatically modified\nprofiles when the roton is close to zero yielding the transition to an unusual\nquantum state.\n", "  We investigate the turbulence-induced dissipation of the large scales in a\nstatistically homogeneous flow using an \"optimal closure,\" which one of us (BT)\nhas recently exposed in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. This statistical\nclosure employs a Gaussian model for the turbulent scales, with corresponding\nvanishing third cumulant, and yet it captures an intrinsic damping. The key to\nthis apparent paradox lies in a clear distinction between true ensemble\naverages and their proxies, most easily grasped when one works directly with\nthe Liouville equation rather than the cumulant hierarchy. We focus on a simple\nproblem for which the optimal closure can be fully and exactly worked out: the\nrelaxation arbitrarily far-from-equilibrium of a single energy shell towards\nGibbs equilibrium in an inviscid shell model of 3D turbulence. The predictions\nof the optimal closure are validated against DNS and contrasted with those\nderived from EDQNM closure.\n", "  In this paper we consider CP-violating new-physics contributions to the decay\n$t \\to b \\bar b c$. We examine the prospects for detecting such new physics at\nthe LHC, which requires studying the process $gg \\to t (\\to b \\bar b c) \\bar t\n(\\to \\bar b \\ell \\bar \\nu)$. We find two observables that can be used to reveal\nthe presence of CP-violating new physics in $t \\to b \\bar b c$. They are (i)\nthe partial-rate asymmetry and (ii) the triple-product correlations involving\nthe momenta of various particles associated with the interaction. A Monte Carlo\nanalysis is performed to determine how well these observables can be used to\ndetect the presence of new physics, and to measure its parameters. We find that\nthere is little difficulty in extracting the value of the relevant new-physics\nparameter from the partial-rate asymmetry. For the triple-product correlations,\nwe test multiple strategies that can be used for the extraction of the\ncorresponding combination of new-physics parameters.\n", "  We present a new approach, based on Noether's energy-momentum tensor, to\nconstruct the lagrangian for nonrelativistic nonisentropic Euler fluids. An\nadvantage of this approach is that it naturally provides a generalised Clebsh\ndecomposition for the fluid velocity. This is used to develop a hamiltonian\nformulation inolving a noncanonical algebra. This algebra is very simply\nobtained from the symplectic structure. It is used to show that the components\nof the Noether's energy-momentum tensor satisfy certain Schwinger-type\nrelations. These relations, which are reminiscent of corresponding relations in\nrelativistic field theory, are new.\n", "  We study a minimal model for the dynamics of spinons in quantum spin ice. The\nmodel captures the essential strong coupling between the spinon and the\ndisordered background spins. We demonstrate that the spinon motion can be\nmapped to a random walk with an entropy-induced memory in imaginary time. Our\nnumerical simulation of the spinon walk indicates that the spinon propagates as\na massive quasiparticle at low energy despite its strong coupling to the spin\nbackground at the microscopic energy scale. We discuss the experimental\nimplications of our findings.\n", "  For proton linear accelerators used in applications such as\naccelerator-driven systems, due to the nature of the operation, it is essential\nfor the beam failure rate to be several orders of magnitude lower than usual\nperformance of similar accelerators. A fault-tolerant mechanism should be\nmandatorily imposed in order to maintain short recovery time, high uptime and\nextremely low frequency of beam loss. This paper proposes an innovative and\nchallenging way for compensation and rematch of cavity failure using fast\nelectronic devices and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) instead of\nembedded computers to complete the computation of beam dynamics. A method of\nbuilding an equivalent model for the FPGA, with optimization using a genetic\nalgorithm, is shown. Results based on the model and algorithm are compared with\nTRACEWIN simulation to show the precision and correctness of the mechanism.\n", "  The lattice thermal conductivities of silicon clathrate frameworks II and\nVIII are investigated by using ab initio lattice dynamics and iterative\nsolution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation(BTE) for phonons.\nWithin the temperature range 100-350 K, the clathrate structures II and VIII\nwere found to have lower lattice thermal conductivity values than silicon\ndiamond structure (d-Si) by factors of 1/2 and 1/5, respectively. The main\nreason for the lower lattice thermal conductivity of the clathrate structure II\nin comparison to d-Si was found to be the harmonic phonon spectra, while in the\ncase of the clathrate structure VIII, the difference is mainly due to the\nharmonic phonon spectra and partly due to shorter relaxation times of phonons.\nIn the studied clathrate frameworks, the anharmonic effects have larger impact\non the lattice thermal conductivity than the size of the unit cell. For the\nstructure II, the predicted lattice thermal conductivity differs approximately\nby factor of 20 from the previous experimental results obtained for a\npolycrystalline sample at room temperature.\n", "  Spin transport via electrons is typically plagued by Joule heating and short\ndecay lengths due to spin-flip scattering. It is known that dissipationless\nspin currents can arise when using conventional superconducting contacts, yet\nthis has only been experimentally demonstrated when using intricate\nmagnetically inhomogeneous multilayers, or in extreme cases such as half-metals\nwith interfacial magnetic disorder. Moreover, it is unknown how such spin\nsupercurrents decay in the presence of spin-flip scattering. Here, we present a\nmethod for generating a spin supercurrent by using only a single homogeneous\nmagnetic element. Remarkably, the spin supercurrent generated in this way does\nnot decay spatially, in stark contrast to normal spin currents that remain\npolarized only up to the spin relaxation length. We also expose the existence\nof a superconductivity-mediated torque even without magnetic inhomogeneities,\nshowing that the different components of the spin supercurrent polarization\nrespond fundamentally differently to a change in the superconducting phase\ndifference. This establishes a mechanism for tuning dissipationless spin and\ncharge flow separately, and confirms the advantage that superconductors can\noffer in spintronics.\n", "  Inclusive production of $\\Lambda$-hyperons was measured with the large\nacceptance NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS in inelastic p+p\ninteractions at beam momentum of 158~\\GeVc. Spectra of transverse momentum and\ntransverse mass as well as distributions of rapidity and x$_{_F}$ are\npresented. The mean multiplicity was estimated to be\n$0.120\\,\\pm0.006\\;(stat.)\\,\\pm 0.010\\;(sys.)$. The results are compared with\nprevious measurements and predictions of the EPOS, UrQMD and FRITIOF models.\n", "  Recent technological advances in integrated photonics have spurred on the\nstudy of topological phenomena in engineered bosonic systems. Indeed, the\ncontrollability of silicon ring-resonator arrays has opened up new perspectives\nfor building lattices for photons with topologically nontrivial bands and\nintegrating them into photonic devices for practical applications. Here, we\npush these developments even further by exploiting the different modes of a\nsilicon ring resonator as an extra dimension for photons. Tunneling along this\nsynthetic dimension is implemented via an external time-dependent modulation\nthat allows for the generation of engineered gauge fields. We show how this\napproach can be used to generate a variety of exciting topological phenomena in\nintegrated photonics, ranging from a topologically-robust optical isolator in a\nspatially one-dimensional (1D) ring-resonator chain to a driven-dissipative\nanalog of the 4D quantum Hall effect in a spatially 3D resonator lattice. Our\nproposal paves the way towards the use of topological effects in the design of\nnovel photonic lattices supporting many frequency channels and displaying\nhigher connectivities.\n", "  BaIrO3 is a magnetic insulator driven by the spin-orbit interaction (SOI),\nwhereas BaRuO3 is a paramagnet and exhibits a crossover from a metallic to an\ninsulating regime. Our investigation of structural, magnetic, transport and\nthermal properties reveals that substitution of Ru4+ (4d4) ions for Ir5+ (5d5)\nions in BaIrO3 reduces the magnitudes of the SOI and a monoclinic structural\ndistortion, and rebalances the competition between the SOC and the lattice\ndegrees freedom to generate a rich phase diagram for BaIr1-xRuxO3 (0< x <1).\nThere are two major effects of Ru additions: (1) Light Ru doping (0 < x < 0.15)\nprompts simultaneous, precipitous drops in both the magnetic ordering\ntemperature TN and the electrical resistivity, which exhibits a crossover\nbehavior from a metallic to an insulating state near TN. (2) Heavier Ru doping\n(0.41< x < 0.9) induces a robust metallic state with a strong spin frustration\ngenerated by competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions.\n", "  The recently discovered charge order is a generic feature of cuprate\nsuperconductors, however, its microscopic origin remains debated. Within the\nframework of the fermion-spin theory, the nature of charge order in the\npseudogap phase and its evolution with doping are studied by taking into\naccount the electron self-energy (then the pseudogap) effect. It is shown that\nthe antinodal region of the electron Fermi surface is suppressed by the\nelectron self-energy, and then the low-energy electron excitations occupy the\ndisconnected Fermi arcs located around the nodal region. In particular, the\ncharge-order state is driven by the Fermi-arc instability, with a\ncharacteristic wave vector corresponding to the hot spots of the Fermi arcs\nrather than the antinodal nesting vector. Moreover, although the Fermi arc\nincreases its length as a function of doping, the charge-order wave vector\nreduces almost linearity with the increase of doping. The theory also indicates\nthat the Fermi arc, charge order, and pseudogap in cuprate superconductors are\nintimately related each other, and all of them emanates from the electron\nself-energy due to the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin\nexcitations.\n", "  The Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to the counterintuitive result of a\nvanishing electronic flux density upon vibrational dynamics in the electronic\nground state. To circumvent this long known issue, we propose using pairwise\nanti-symmetrically translated vibronic densities to generate a symmetric\nelectronic density that can be forced to satisfy the continuity equation\napproximately. The so-called Born-Oppenheimer broken symmetry ansatz yields all\ncomponents of the flux density simultaneously while requiring only knowledge\nabout the nuclear quantum dynamics on the electronic adiabatic ground state\npotential energy surface. The underlying minimization procedure is transparent\nand computationally inexpensive, and the solution can be computed from the\nstandard output of any quantum chemistry program. Taylor series expansion\nreveals that the implicit electron dynamics originates from non-adiabatic\ncoupling to the explicit Born-Oppenheimer nuclear dynamics. The new approach is\napplied to the ${\\rm H}_2^+$ molecular ion vibrating in its ${}^2\\Sigma^+_g$\nground state. The electronic flux density is found to have the correct nodal\nstructure and symmetry properties at all times.\n", "  We introduce an algorithm to obtain coefficients of fractional parentage for\nlight $p$-shell nuclei. The coefficients enable to use Jacobi coordinates in\nno-core shell model calculations separating off the center-of-mass motion.\nFully antisymmetrized basis states are given together with recoupling\ncoefficients that allow one to apply two- and three-nucleon operators. As an\nexample, we study the dependence on the harmonic oscillator frequency of $^3$H,\n$^4$He, $^6$He, $^6$Li and $^7$Li and extract their binding and excitation\nenergies. The coefficients will be made openly accessible as HDF5 data files.\n", "  The {\\it dark matter} seem to be an inevitable ingredient of the total matter\nconfiguration in the Universe and the knowledge how the {\\it dark matter}\naffects the properties of superconductors is of vital importance for the\nexperiments aimed at its direct detection. The homogeneous magnetic field\nacting perpendicularly to the surface of (2+1) dimensional s-wave holographic\nsuperconductor in the theory with {\\it dark matter} sector has been modeled by\nthe additional $U(1)$-gauge field representing dark matter and coupled to the\nMaxwell one. As expected the free energy for the vortex configuration turns out\nto be negative. Importantly its value is lower in the presence of {\\it dark\nmatter} sector. This feature can explain why in the Early Universe first the\nweb of {\\it dark matter} appeared and next on these gratings the ordinary\nmatter forming cluster of galaxies has formed.\n", "  In this paper we study the relationship between the $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)^+$\nresonance and the decay of the $B_c$ meson into $J/\\psi DK$. In this process,\nthe $B_c$ meson decays first into $J/\\psi$ and the quark pair $c\\bar{s}$, and\nthen the quark pair hadronizes into $DK$ or $D_s\\eta$ components, which undergo\nfinal state interaction. This final state interaction, generating the\n$D_{s0}^{*}(2317)^+$ resonance, is described by the chiral unitary approach.\nWith the parameters which allow us to match the pole position of the\n$D_{s0}^{*}(2317)^+$, we obtain the $DK$ invariant mass distribution of the\ndecay $B_c\\to J/\\psi DK$, and also the rate for $B_c\\to J/\\psi\nD_{s0}^{*}(2317)$. The ratio of these two magnitude is then predicted.\n", "  Although climate change and energy are intricately linked, their explicit\nconnection is not always prominent in public discourse and the media.\nDisruptive extreme weather events, including hurricanes, focus public attention\nin new and different ways, offering a unique window of opportunity to analyze\nhow a focusing event influences public discourse. Media coverage of extreme\nweather events simultaneously shapes and reflects public discourse on climate\nissues. Here we analyze climate and energy newspaper coverage of Hurricanes\nKatrina (2005) and Sandy (2012) using topic models, mathematical techniques\nused to discover abstract topics within a set of documents. Our results\ndemonstrate that post-Katrina media coverage does not contain a climate change\ntopic, and the energy topic is limited to discussion of energy prices, markets,\nand the economy with almost no explicit linkages made between energy and\nclimate change. In contrast, post-Sandy media coverage does contain a prominent\nclimate change topic, a distinct energy topic, as well as integrated\nrepresentation of climate change and energy, indicating a shift in climate and\nenergy reporting between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.\n", "  The anomalous low-temperature behavior of the spontaneous magnetization of\nordered arrays of In_{1-x}Mn_xAs quantum dots is discussed. It is shown that\nthe experimental results can be well understood, within a mean field\napproximation, assuming collective response through rather strong spin\ntunneling processes between neighbouring dots.\n", "  An ordering between the quantum states emerging from a single mode\ngauge-covariant bosonic Gaussian channel is proven. Specifically, we show that\nwithin the set of input density matrices with the same given spectrum, the\nelement passive with respect to the Fock basis (i.e. diagonal with decreasing\neigenvalues) produces an output which majorizes all the other outputs emerging\nfrom the same set. When applied to pure input states, our finding includes as a\nspecial case the result of A. Mari, et al., Nat. Comm. 5, 3826 (2014) which\nimplies that the output associated to the vacuum majorizes the others.\n", "  Current multispectral imagers suffer from low photon efficiency and limited\nspectrum range. These limitations are partially due to the technological\nlimitations from array sensors (CCD or CMOS), and also caused by separative\nmeasurement of the entries/slices of a spatial-spectral data cube. Besides,\nthey are mostly expensive and bulky. To address above issues, this paper\nproposes to image the 3D multispectral data with a single bucket detector in a\nmultiplexing way. Under the single pixel imaging scheme, we project\nspatial-spectral modulated illumination onto the target scene to encode the\nscene's 3D information into a 1D measurement sequence. Conventional spatial\nmodulation is used to resolve the scene's spatial information. To avoid\nincreasing requisite acquisition time for 2D to 3D extension of the latent\ndata, we conduct spectral modulation in a frequency-division multiplexing\nmanner in the speed gap between slow spatial light modulation and fast detector\nresponse. Then the sequential reconstruction falls into a simple Fourier\ndecomposition and standard compressive sensing problem. A proof-of-concept\nsetup is built to capture the multispectral data (64 pixels $\\times$ 64 pixels\n$\\times$ 10 wavelength bands) in the visible wavelength range (450nm-650nm)\nwith acquisition time being 1 minute. The imaging scheme is of high flexibility\nfor different spectrum ranges and resolutions. It holds great potentials for\nvarious low light and airborne applications, and can be easily manufactured\nproduction-volume portable multispectral imagers.\n", "  Considering non-Gaussian smeared matter distributions, we investigate\nthermodynamic behaviors of the noncommutative high-dimensional\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini anti-de Sitter black hole, and obtain the condition\nfor the existence of extreme black holes. We indicate that the Gaussian smeared\nmatter distribution, which is a special case of non-Gaussian smeared matter\ndistributions, is not applicable for the 6- and higher-dimensional black holes\ndue to the hoop conjecture. In particular, the phase transition is analyzed in\ndetail. Moreover, we point out that the Maxwell equal area law maintains for\nthe noncommutative black hole whose Hawking temperature is within a specific\nrange, but fails for that whose the Hawking temperature is beyond this range.\n", "  There exists, in general, no unique definition of the size (volume, area,\netc., depending on dimension) of a soliton. Here we demonstrate that the\ngeometric volume (area etc.) of a soliton is singled out in the sense that it\nexactly coincides with the thermodynamical or continuum-mechanical volume. In\naddition, this volume may be defined uniquely for rather arbitrary solitons in\narbitrary dimensions.\n", "  A first measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top\nquark polarisation, in t-channel single top quark production is presented. It\nis based on a sample of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse-femtobarns. A\nhigh-purity sample of t-channel single top quark events with an isolated muon\nis selected. Signal and background components are estimated using a fit to\ndata. A differential cross section measurement, corrected for detector effects,\nof an angular observable sensitive to the top quark polarisation is performed.\nThe differential distribution is used to extract a top quark spin asymmetry of\n0.26 +/- 0.03 (stat) +/- 0.10 (syst), which is compatible with a p-value of\n4.6% with the standard model prediction of 0.44.\n", "  Evanescent electromagnetic waves possess spin-momentum locking, where the\ndirection of propagation (momentum) is locked to the inherent polarization of\nthe wave (transverse spin). We study the optical forces arising from this\nuniversal phenomenon and show that the fundamental origin of recently reported\nnon-trivial optical chiral forces is spin-momentum locking. For evanescent\nwaves, we show that the direction of energy flow, direction of decay, and\ndirection of spin follow a right hand rule for three different cases of total\ninternal reflection, surface plasmon polaritons, and $HE_{11}$ mode of an\noptical fiber. Furthermore, we explain how the recently reported phenomena of\nlateral optical force on chiral and achiral particles is caused by the\ntransverse spin of the evanescent field and the spin-momentum locking\nphenomenon. Finally, we propose an experiment to identify the unique lateral\nforces arising from the transverse spin in the optical fiber and point to\nfundamental differences of the spin density from the well-known orbital angular\nmomentum of light. Our work presents a unified view on spin-momentum locking\nand how it affects optical forces on chiral and achiral particles.\n", "  Previous searches for the $\\gamma$-ray signatures of annihilating galactic\ndark matter used predefined spatial templates to describe the background of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from astrophysical processes like cosmic ray\ninteractions. In this work, we aim to establish an alternative approach, in\nwhich the astrophysical components are identified solely by their spectral and\nmorphological properties. To this end, we adopt the recent reconstruction of\nthe diffuse $\\gamma$-ray sky from Fermi data by the D$^{3}$PO algorithm and the\nfact that more than 90\\% of its flux can be represented by only two spectral\ncomponents, resulting form the dense and dilute interstellar medium. Under\nthese presumptions, we confirm the reported DM annihilation-like signal in the\ninner Galaxy and derive upper limits for dark matter annihilation cross\nsections. We investigate whether the DM signal could be a residual of the\nsimplified modeling of astrophysical emission by inspecting the morphology of\nthe regions, which favor a dark matter component. The central galactic region\nfavors strongest for such a component with the expected spherically symmetric\nand radially declining profile. However, astrophysical structures, in\nparticular sky regions which seem to host most of the dilute interstellar\nmedium, obviously would benefit from a DM annihilation-like component as well.\nAlthough these regions do not drive the fit, they warn that a more detailed\nunderstanding of astrophysical $\\gamma$-ray emitting processes in the galactic\ncenter region are necessary before definite claims about a DM annihilation\nsignal can be made. The regions off the Galactic plane actually disfavor the\nbest fit DM annihilation cross section from the inner Galactic region unless\nthe radial decline of the Galactic DM density profile in the outer regions is\nsignificantly steeper than that usually assumed.\n", "  We present a two-band Bose-Hubbard model which is shown to be minimal in the\nnecessary coupling terms at resonant tunneling conditions. The dynamics of the\nmany-body problem is studied by sweeping the system across an avoided level\ncrossing. The linear sweep generalizes Landau-Zener transitions from\nsingle-particle to many-body realizations. The temporal evolution of single-\nand two-body observables along the sweeps is investigated in order to\ncharacterize the non-equilibrium dynamics in our complex quantum system.\n", "  A Hermitian quantum phase operator is formulated that mirrors the classical\nphase variable with proper time dependence and satisfies trigonometric\nidentities. The eigenstates of the phase operator are solved in terms of\nGegenbauer ultraspherical polynomials in the number state representation.\n", "  We use the Fisher matrix formalism and semi-numerical simulations to derive\nquantitative predictions of the constraints that power spectrum measurements on\nnext-generation interferometers, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization\nArray (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will place on the\ncharacteristics of the X-ray sources that heated the high redshift\nintergalactic medium. Incorporating observations between $z=5$ and $z=25$, we\nfind that the proposed 331 element HERA and SKA phase 1 will be capable of\nplacing $\\lesssim 10\\%$ constraints on the spectral properties of these first\nX-ray sources, even if one is unable to perform measurements within the\nforeground contaminated \"wedge\" or the FM band. When accounting for the\nenhancement in power spectrum amplitude from spin temperature fluctuations, we\nfind that the observable signatures of reionization extend well beyond the peak\nin the power spectrum usually associated with it. We also find that lower\nredshift degeneracies between the signatures of heating and reionization\nphysics lead to errors on reionization parameters that are significantly\ngreater than previously predicted. Observations over the heating epoch are able\nto break these degeneracies and improve our constraints considerably. For these\ntwo reasons, 21\\,cm observations during the heating epoch significantly enhance\nour understanding of reionization as well.\n", "  In the well-studied (2,2,2) Bell experiment consisting of two parties, two\nmeasurement settings per party, and two possible outcomes per setting, it is\nknown that if the experiment obeys no-signaling constraints, then the set of\nadmissible experimental probability distributions is fully characterized as the\nconvex hull of 24 distributions: 8 Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes and 16 local\ndeterministic distributions. Here, we refine this result to show that in the\n(2,2,2) case, any nonlocal nonsignaling distribution can always be uniquely\nexpressed as a convex combination of exactly one PR box and (up to) eight local\ndeterministic distributions. In this representation each PR box will always\noccur only with a fixed set of eight local deterministic distributions with\nwhich it is affiliated. This decomposition has multiple applications: we\ndemonstrate an analytical proof that the minimum detection efficiency for which\nnonlocality can be observed is $\\eta>2/3$ even for theories constrained only by\nthe no-signaling principle, and we develop new algorithms that speed the\ncalculation of important statistical functions of Bell test data. Finally, we\nenumerate the vertices of the no-signaling polytope for the (2, n, 2) \"chained\nBell\" scenario and find that similar decomposition results are possible in this\ngeneral case. Here, our results allow us to prove the optimality of a bound,\nderived in Barrett et al. [1], on the proportion of local theories in a\nlocal/nonlocal mixture that can be inferred from the experimental violation of\na chained Bell inequality.\n", "  Based on recent experimental data obtained by the CLAS Collaboration, the\n$\\Sigma(1385)$ photoproduction off a neutron target at laboratory photon\nenergies $E_\\gamma$ up to 2.5\\,GeV is investigated in an effective Lagrangian\napproach including $s$-, $u$-, and $t$-channel Born-term contributions. The\npresent calculation does not take into account any explicit $s$-channel\nbaryon-resonance contributions, however, in the spirit of duality, we include\n$t$-channel exchanges of mesonic Regge trajectories. The onset of the Regge\nregime is controlled by smoothly interpolating between Feynman-type\nsingle-meson exchanges and full-fledged Regge-trajectory exchanges. Gauge\ninvariance broken by the Regge treatment is fully restored by introducing\ncontact-type interaction currents that result from the implementation of\n\\textit{local} gauge invariance in terms of generalized Ward-Takahashi\nidentities. The cross sections for the $\\gamma n\\to K^+\\Sigma^*(1385)^-$\nreaction are calculated and compared with experimental results from the CLAS\nand LEPS collaborations. Despite its simplicity, the present theoretical\napproach provides a good description of the main features of the data. However,\nthe parameters fitted to the data show that the gauge-invariance-restoring\ncontact term plays a large role which may point to large contributions from\nfinal-state interactions.\n", "  ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the long wavelength dust emission in 145\nstar-forming galaxies are used to probe the evolution of star-forming ISM. We\nalso develop the physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z\n~ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of\ninterstellar medium (ISM) masses. The galaxies with highest star formation\nrates (SFRs) at <z> = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the\nMilky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50 to 80%, i.e. gas masses 1 - 4\ntimes their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: SFR =\n35 M_ mol^0.89 x (1+z)_{z=2}^0.95 x (sSFR)_{MS}^0.23 \\msun yr^-1 -- an\napproximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation\nefficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the Main\nSequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on\na timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS -- thus these\n'starbursts' are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses\nrather than and increased efficiency for converting gas to stars. At z $> 1$,\nthe entire population of star-forming galaxies has $\\sim$ 2 - 5 times shorter\ngas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate\na different mode of star formation in the early universe -- most likely\ndynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions -- a natural\nconsequence of the high gas accretion rates.\n", "  We estimate the critical thresholds of bond and site percolation on\nnonplanar, effectively two-dimensional graphs with chimera like topology. The\nbuilding blocks of these graphs are complete and symmetric bipartite subgraphs\nof size $2n$, referred to as $K_{n,n}$ graphs. For the numerical simulations we\nuse an efficient union-find based algorithm and employ a finite-size scaling\nanalysis to obtain the critical properties for both bond and site percolation.\nWe report the respective percolation thresholds for different sizes of the\nbipartite subgraph and verify that the associated universality class is that of\nstandard two-dimensional percolation. For the canonical chimera graph used in\nthe D-Wave Systems Inc.~quantum annealer ($n = 4$), we discuss device failure\nin terms of network vulnerability, i.e., we determine the critical fraction of\nqubits and couplers that can be absent due to random failures prior to losing\nlarge-scale connectivity throughout the device.\n", "  The quantum condensate of Cooper-pairs forming a superconductor was\noriginally conceived to be translationally invariant. In theory, however, pairs\ncan exist with finite momentum $Q$ and thereby generate states with spatially\nmodulating Cooper-pair density. While never observed directly in any\nsuperconductor, such a state has been created in ultra-cold $^{6}$Li gas. It is\nnow widely hypothesized that the cuprate pseudogap phase contains such a 'pair\ndensity wave' (PDW) state. Here we use nanometer resolution scanned Josephson\ntunneling microscopy (SJTM) to image Cooper-pair tunneling from a $d$-wave\nsuperconducting STM tip to the condensate of\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$. Condensate visualization capabilities are\ndemonstrated directly using the Cooper-pair density variations surrounding Zn\nimpurity atoms and at the Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$\ncrystal-supermodulation. Then, by using Fourier analysis of SJTM images, we\ndiscover the direct signature of a Cooper-pair density modulation at\nwavevectors $Q_{p} \\approx (0.25,0)2\\pi / a_{0}$;$(0,0.25)2\\pi / a_{0}$ in\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$. The amplitude of these modulations is ~5%\nof the homogenous condensate density and their form factor exhibits primarily\n$s$/$s'$-symmetry. This phenomenology is expected within Ginzburg-Landau theory\nwhen a charge density wave with $d$-symmetry form factor and wave vector\n$Q_{c}=Q_{p}$ coexists with a homogeneous $d$-symmetry superconductor ; it is\nalso encompassed by several contemporary microscopic theories for the pseudogap\nphase.\n", "  We consider a three-Higgs doublet scenario in this paper, invariant under the\ndiscrete group S3 , and probe its high-scale validity by allowing the model\nparameters to evolve under a renormalization group. We choose two particular\nalignments of vacuum expectation values (vev) for our study, out of a set of\nseveral such possible ones. All three doublets receive nonzero vacuum\nexpectation values in the first case, and in the second case, two of the\ndoublets remain without vev. The constraints on the parameter space at low\nenergy, including the measured value of the Higgs mass and the signal\nstrengths, oblique corrections and also measurements of relic density and\ndirect detection rates are juxtaposed with the conditions of vacuum stability,\nperturbativity and unitarity at various scales. We find that the scenario with\nthree nonzero vevs is not valid beyond 107 GeV, assuming no additional physics\nparticipates at the intermediate scales. On the contrary, the scenario with\nonly one nonzero vev turns out to be a successful model for cold dark matter\nphenomenology, which also turns out to be valid up to the Planck scale at the\nsame time. Stringent restrictions are obtained on the model parameter space in\neach case. Thus, the S3 symmetric scalar sector emerges as an ultraviolet\ncomplete theory.\n", "  We consider the problem of constructing the stationary state following a\nquantum quench, using the exact overlaps for finite size integrable models. We\nfocus on the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with initial state N\\'eel or\nMajumdar-Ghosh (dimer), although the proposed approach is valid for an\narbitrary integrable model. We consider only eigenstates which do not contain\nzero-momentum strings because the latter are affected by fictitious\nsingularities that are very difficult to take into account. We show that the\nfraction of eigenstates that do not contain zero-momentum strings is vanishing\nin the thermodynamic limit. Consequently, restricting to this part of the\nHilbert space leads to vanishing expectation values of local observables.\nHowever, it is possible to reconstruct the asymptotic values by properly\nreweighting the expectations in the considered subspace, at the price of\nintroducing finite-size corrections. We also develop a Monte Carlo sampling of\nthe Hilbert space which allows us to study larger systems. We accurately\nreconstruct the expectation values of the conserved charged and the root\ndistributions in the stationary state, which turn out to match the exact\nthermodynamic results. The proposed method can be implemented even in cases in\nwhich an analytic thermodynamic solution is not obtainable.\n", "  In this paper we consider the fact that the simple criterion used to label\nfast radio transient events as either fast radio bursts (FRBs, thought to be\nextragalactic with as yet unknown progenitors) or rotating radio transients\n(RRATs, thought to be Galactic neutron stars) is uncertain. We identify single\npulse events reported in the literature which have never been seen to repeat,\nand which have been labelled as RRATs, but are potentially mis-labelled FRBs.\nWe examine the probability that such `grey area' events are within the Milky\nWay. The uncertainty in the RRAT/FRB labelling criterion, as well as\nGalactic-latitude dependent reporting bias may be contributing to the observed\nlatitude dependence of the FRB rate, in addition to effects such as Eddington\nbias due to scintillation.\n", "  The Fokker action governing the motion of compact binary systems without\nspins is derived in harmonic coordinates at the fourth post-Newtonian\napproximation (4PN) of general relativity. Dimensional regularization is used\nfor treating the local ultraviolet (UV) divergences associated with point\nparticles, followed by a renormalization of the poles into a redefinition of\nthe trajectories of the point masses. Effects at the 4PN order associated with\nwave tails propagating at infinity are included consistently at the level of\nthe action. A finite part procedure based on analytic continuation deals with\nthe infrared (IR) divergencies at spatial infinity, which are shown to be fully\nconsistent with the presence of near-zone tails. Our end result at 4PN order is\nLorentz invariant and has the correct self-force limit for the energy of\ncircular orbits. However, we find that it differs from the recently published\nresult derived within the ADM Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity [T.\nDamour, P. Jaranowski, and G. Sch\\\"afer, Phys. Rev. D 89, 064058 (2014)]. More\nwork is needed to understand this discrepancy.\n", "  We develop a variant of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nalgorithm for two-dimensional cylinders that uses a real space representation\nalong the cylinder and a momentum space representation in the perpendicular\ndirection. The mixed representation allows us to use the momentum around the\ncircumference as a conserved quantity in the DMRG algorithm. Compared with the\ntraditional purely real-space approach, we find a significant speedup in\ncomputation time and a considerable reduction in memory usage. Applying the\nmethod to the interacting fermionic Hofstadter model, we demonstrate a\nreduction in computation time by over 20-fold, in addition to a sixfold memory\nreduction.\n", "  We report the phase diagram for the superconducting system\n(${^{7}}$Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_{x}}$OD)FeSe and contrast it with that of\n(Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_{x}}$OH)FeSe both in single crystal and powder forms. Samples\nwere prepared via hydrothermal methods and characterized with laboratory and\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction, high-resolution neutron powder diffraction\n(NPD), and high intensity NPD. We find a correlation between the tetragonality\nof the unit cell parameters and the critical temperature, $T_{c}$, which is\nindicative of the effects of charge doping on the lattice and formation of iron\nvacancies in the FeSe layer. We observe no appreciable isotope effect on the\nmaximum $T_{c}$ in substituting H by by D. The NPD measurements definitively\nrule out an antiferromagnetic ordering in the non-superconducting\n(Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_{x}}$OD)FeSe samples below 120 K, which has been reported in\nnon-superconducting (Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_{x}}$OH)FeSe.$^{1}$ A likely explanation\nfor the observed antiferromagnetic transition in (Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_{x}}$OH)FeSe\nsamples is the formation of impurities during their preparation such as\nFe${_{3}}$O${_{4}}$ and LixFeO2, which express a charge ordering transition\nknown as the Verwey transition near 120 K. The concentration of these oxide\nimpurities is found to be dependent on the concentration of the lithium\nhydroxide reagent and the use of H${_{2}}$O vs. D${_{2}}$O as the solvent\nduring synthesis. We also describe the reaction conditions that lead to some of\nour superconducting samples to exhibit ferromagnetism below $T_{c}$.\n", "  It is shown that the classical gravitational waves of super-horizon\nwavelengths are able to form the de Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty\n(with no matter fields) Universe. The contemporary Universe is about 70% empty\nand asymptotically is going to become completely empty, so the effect caused by\nemptiness should be already very noticeable. It could manifest itself as the\ndark energy.\n", "  The negatively-charged silicon-vacancy ($\\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$) center in diamond\nis a bright source of indistinguishable single photons and a useful resource in\nquantum information protocols. Until now, $\\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers with\nnarrow optical linewidths and small inhomogeneous distributions of\n$\\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ transition frequencies have only been reported in samples\ndoped with silicon during diamond growth. We present a technique for producing\nimplanted $\\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers with nearly lifetime-limited optical\nlinewidths and a small inhomogeneous distribution. These properties persist\nafter nanofabrication, paving the way for incorporation of high-quality\n$\\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers into nanophotonic devices.\n", "  A variational formulation for the geodesic circles in two-dimensional\nRiemannian manifold is discovered. Some relations with the uniform relativistic\nacceleration and the one-dimensional 'spin'-curvature interaction is\ninvestigated.\n", "  We study the convergence of bound-state quadrupole moments in finite harmonic\noscillator spaces. We derive an expression for the infrared extrapolation for\nthe quadrupole moment of a nucleus and benchmark our results using different\nmodel interactions for the deuteron. We find good agreement between the\nanalytically derived and numerically obtained convergence behavior. We also\nderive an extrapolation formula for electric quadrupole transitions and find\ngood agreement with the numerical calculation of a simple system.\n", "  The specific heat of regular Ising polyhedra is investigated in detail as a\nfunction of temperature and magnetic field. It is shown that the regular Ising\npolyhedra display diverse double-peak temperature dependences of the specific\nheat whenever the magnetic field approaches a level-crossing field. The\nSchottky theory of a two-level system often provides a plausible explanation of\na height and position of low-temperature peak, which emerges in the specific\nheat of a regular Ising polyhedron due to low-lying excitations from a ground\nstate to a first-excited state. The height and position of Schottky-type\nmaximum depends essentially on a relative degeneracy of the ground state and\nfirst-excited state, which are in general quite distinct in geometrically\nfrustrated Ising spin clusters. Low-temperature variations of the specific heat\nwith the magnetic field exhibit multipeak structure with two peaks (of\ngenerally different height) symmetrically placed around each level-crossing\nfield.\n", "  Researchers have developed several theoretical methods for predicting\nepidemic thresholds, including the mean-field like (MFL) method, the quenched\nmean-field (QMF) method, and the dynamical message passing (DMP) method. When\nthese methods are applied to predict epidemic threshold they often produce\ndiffering results and their relative levels of accuracy are still unknown. We\nsystematically analyze these two issues---relationships among differing results\nand levels of accuracy---by studying the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)\nmodel on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of 56 real-world\nnetworks. In uncorrelated configuration networks the MFL and DMP methods yield\nidentical predictions that are larger and more accurate than the prediction\ngenerated by the QMF method. When compared to the 56 real-world networks, the\nepidemic threshold obtained by the DMP method is closer to the actual epidemic\nthreshold because it incorporates full network topology information and some\ndynamical correlations. We find that in some scenarios---such as networks with\npositive degree-degree correlations, with an eigenvector localized on the high\n$k$-core nodes, or with a high level of clustering---the epidemic threshold\npredicted by the MFL method, which uses the degree distribution as the only\ninput parameter, performs better than the other two methods. We also find that\nthe performances of the three predictions are irregular versus modularity.\n", "  Bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states are gapped disordered\nphases of matter possessing symmetry-preserving boundary excitations. It has\nbeen proposed that, at long wavelengths, the universal properties of an SPT\nsystem are captured by an effective non-linear sigma model field theory in the\npresence of a quantized topological theta-term. By studying lattice models of\nbosonic SPT states, we are able to identify, in their Euclidean path integral\nformulation, (discrete) Berry phases that hold relevant physical information on\nthe nature of the SPT ground states. These discrete Berry phases are given\nintuitive physical interpretation in terms of instanton effects that capture\nthe presence of a theta-term on the microscopic scale.\n", "  For a pair of quantum channels with the same input space, we show that the\npossibility of approximation of one channel by post-processings of the other\nchannel can be characterized by comparing the success probabilities for the two\nensembles obtained as outputs for any ensemble on the input space coupled with\nan ancilla. This provides an operational interpretation to a natural extension\nof Le Cam's deficiency to quantum channels. In particular, we obtain a version\nof the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments. The proofs\nare based on some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of\nindependent interest.\n", "  A puzzle arising from Faraday's law is considered and solved concerning the\nquestion which voltage is induced in an open wire with a time-varying\nhomogeneous magnetic field. In contrast to closed wires where the voltage is\ndetermined by the time variance of magnetic field and enclosed area, in an open\nwire we have to integrate the electric field along the wire. It is found that\nthe longitudinal electric field contributes with 1/3 and the transverse field\nwith 2/3 to the induced voltage. In order to find the electric fields the\nsources of the magnetic fields are necessary to know. The representation of a\nhomogeneous and time-varying magnetic field implies unavoidably a certain\nsymmetry point or symmetry line which depend on the geometry of the source. As\na consequence the induced voltage of an open wire is found to be the area\ncovered with respect to this symmetry line or point perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. This in turn allows to find the symmetry points of a magnetic\nfield source by measuring the voltage of an open wire placed with different\nangles in the magnetic field. We present exactly solvable models for a symmetry\npoint and for a symmetry line, respectively. The results are applicable to open\ncircuit problems like corrosion and for astrophysical applications.\n", "  The XENON1T experiment is currently in the commissioning phase at the\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. In this article we study the\nexperiment's expected sensitivity to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon\ninteraction cross section, based on Monte Carlo predictions of the electronic\nand nuclear recoil backgrounds.\n  The total electronic recoil background in $1$ tonne fiducial volume and ($1$,\n$12$) keV electronic recoil equivalent energy region, before applying any\nselection to discriminate between electronic and nuclear recoils, is $(1.80 \\pm\n0.15) \\cdot 10^{-4}$ ($\\rm{kg} \\cdot day \\cdot keV)^{-1}$, mainly due to the\ndecay of $^{222}\\rm{Rn}$ daughters inside the xenon target. The nuclear recoil\nbackground in the corresponding nuclear recoil equivalent energy region ($4$,\n$50$) keV, is composed of $(0.6 \\pm 0.1)$ ($\\rm{t} \\cdot y)^{-1}$ from\nradiogenic neutrons, $(1.8 \\pm 0.3) \\cdot 10^{-2}$ ($\\rm{t} \\cdot y)^{-1}$ from\ncoherent scattering of neutrinos, and less than $0.01$ ($\\rm{t} \\cdot y)^{-1}$\nfrom muon-induced neutrons.\n  The sensitivity of XENON1T is calculated with the Profile Likelihood Ratio\nmethod, after converting the deposited energy of electronic and nuclear recoils\ninto the scintillation and ionization signals seen in the detector. We take\ninto account the systematic uncertainties on the photon and electron emission\nmodel, and on the estimation of the backgrounds, treated as nuisance\nparameters. The main contribution comes from the relative scintillation\nefficiency $\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{eff}$, which affects both the signal from WIMPs\nand the nuclear recoil backgrounds. After a $2$ y measurement in $1$ t fiducial\nvolume, the sensitivity reaches a minimum cross section of $1.6 \\cdot 10^{-47}$\ncm$^2$ at m$_\\chi$=$50$ GeV/$c^2$.\n", "  We study the density of states (DOS) in diffusive superconductors with\npointlike magnetic impurities of arbitrary strength described by the Poissonian\nstatistics. The mean-field theory predicts a nontrivial structure of the DOS\nwith the continuum of quasiparticle states and (possibly) the impurity band. In\nthis approximation, all the spectral edges are hard, marking distinct\nboundaries between spectral regions of finite and zero DOS. Considering\ninstantons in the replica sigma-model technique, we calculate the average DOS\nbeyond the mean-field level and determine the smearing of the spectral edges\ndue interplay of fluctuations of potential and nonpotential disorder. The\nlatter, represented by inhomogeneity in the concentration of magnetic\nimpurities, affects the subgap DOS in two ways: via fluctuations of the\npair-breaking strength and via induced fluctuations of the order parameter. In\nlimiting cases, we reproduce previously reported results for the subgap DOS in\ndisordered superconductors with strong magnetic impurities.\n", "  Wave motion in a continuous elastic rod with a periodically attached\ninertial-amplification mechanism is investigated. The mechanism has properties\nsimilar to an \"inerter\" typically used in vehicle suspensions, however here it\nis constructed and utilized in a manner that alters the intrinsic properties of\na continuous structure. The elastodynamic band structure of the hybrid\nrod-mechanism structure yields band gaps that are exceedingly wide and deep\nwhen compared to what can be obtained using standard local resonators, while\nstill being low in frequency. With this concept, a large band gap may be\nrealized with as much as twenty times less added mass compared to what is\nneeded in a standard local resonator configuration. The emerging inertially\nenhanced continuous structure also exhibits unique qualitative features in its\ndispersion curves. These include the existence of a characteristic double-peak\nin the attenuation constant profile within gaps and the possibility of\ncoalescence of two neighbouring gaps creating a large contiguous gap.\n", "  It is common for dispersion curves of damped periodic materials to be based\non real frequencies versus complex wavenumbers or, conversely, real wavenumbers\nversus complex frequencies. The former condition corresponds to harmonic wave\nmotion where a driving frequency is prescribed and where attenuation due to\ndissipation takes place only in space alongside spatial attenuation due to\nBragg scattering. The latter condition, on the other hand, relates to free wave\nmotion admitting attenuation due to energy loss only in time while spatial\nattenuation due to Bragg scattering also takes place. Here, we develop an\nalgorithm for 1D systems that provides dispersion curves for damped free wave\nmotion based on frequencies and wavenumbers that are permitted to be\nsimultaneously complex. This represents a generalized application of Bloch's\ntheorem and produces a dispersion band structure that fully describes all\nattenuation mechanisms, in space and in time. The algorithm is applied to a\nviscously damped mass-in-mass metamaterial exhibiting local resonance. A\nfrequency-dependent effective mass for this damped infinite chain is also\nobtained.\n", "  We give upper and lower bounds on the information-theoretic threshold for\ncommunity detection in the stochastic block model. Specifically, let $k$ be the\nnumber of groups, $d$ be the average degree, the probability of edges between\nvertices within and between groups be $c_\\mathrm{in}/n$ and $c_\\mathrm{out}/n$\nrespectively, and let $\\lambda = (c_\\mathrm{in}-c_\\mathrm{out})/(kd)$. We show\nthat, when $k$ is large, and $\\lambda = O(1/k)$, the critical value of $d$ at\nwhich community detection becomes possible -- in physical terms, the\ncondensation threshold -- is \\[ d_c = \\Theta\\!\\left( \\frac{\\log k}{k \\lambda^2}\n\\right) \\, , \\] with tighter results in certain regimes. Above this threshold,\nwe show that the only partitions of the nodes into $k$ groups are correlated\nwith the ground truth, giving an exponential-time algorithm that performs\nbetter than chance -- in particular, detection is possible for $k \\ge 5$ in the\ndisassortative case $\\lambda < 0$ and for $k \\ge 11$ in the assortative case\n$\\lambda > 0$. (Similar upper bounds were obtained independently by Abbe and\nSandon.) Below this threshold, we use recent results of Neeman and Netrapalli\n(who generalized arguments of Mossel, Neeman, and Sly) to show that no\nalgorithm can label the vertices better than chance, or even distinguish the\nblock model from an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph with high probability. We\nalso rely on bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to\nAchlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on $d_c$ is the second moment\nlower bound on the $k$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a certain\neffective degree.\n", "  ORBKIT is a toolbox for post-processing electronic structure calculations\nbased on a highly modular and portable Python architecture. The program allows\ncomputing a multitude of electronic properties of molecular systems on\narbitrary spatial grids from the basis set representation of its electronic\nwavefunction, as well as several grid-independent properties. The required data\ncan be extracted directly from the standard output of a large number of quantum\nchemical programs. ORBKIT can be used as a standalone program to determine\nstandard quantities, for example, the electron density, molecular orbitals, and\nderivatives thereof. The cornerstone of ORBKIT is its modular structure. The\nexisting basic functions can be arranged in an individual way and can be easily\nextended by user-written modules to determine any other desired quantities.\nORBKIT offers multiple output formats that can be processed by common\nvisualization tools (VMD, Molden, etc.). Additionally, ORBKIT possesses\nroutines to order molecular orbitals computed at different nuclear\nconfigurations according to their electronic character and to interpolate the\nwavefunction between these configurations. The program is open-source under\nGNU-LGPLv3 license and freely available at\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/orbkit/. This article provides an overview of\nORBKIT with particular focus on its capabilities and applicability, and\nincludes several example calculations.\n", "  Pair density wave superconductivity constitutes a novel electronic condensate\nproposed to be realized in certain unconventional superconductors. Establishing\nits potential existence is important for our fundamental understanding of\nsuperconductivity in correlated materials. Here we compute the dynamical\nmagnetic susceptibility in the presence of a pair density wave ordered state,\nand study its fingerprints on the spin-wave spectrum including the neutron\nresonance. In contrast to the standard case of d-wave superconductivity, we\nshow that the pair density wave phase exhibits neither a spin-gap nor a\nmagnetic resonance peak, in agreement with a recent neutron scattering\nexperiment on underdoped La$_{1.905}$Ba$_{0.095}$CuO$_4$ [Z. Xu et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 113, 177002 (2014)].\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have shown great promise in\n(opto)electronic applications. However, their developments are limited by a\nlarge Schottky barrier (SB) at the metal-semiconductor junction (MSJ), which is\ndifficult to tune by using conventional metals due to the strong Fermi level\npinning (FLP) effect. Here we show that, this problem can be overcome by using\n2D metals, which are bounded with 2D semiconductors through van der Waals (vdW)\ninteraction. This success relies on a weak FLP at the vdW MSJ, which is\nattributed to the suppression of metal-induced gap states. Consequently, the SB\nbecomes tunable and can vanish with proper 2D metals (e.g. H-NbS2). This work\nnot only offers new insights into the fundamental properties of\nheterojunctions, but also uncovers great potential of 2D metals in device\napplications.\n", "  We report the first experimental observation of frequency shift in high order\nharmonic generation (HHG) from isotopic molecules H2 and D2 . It is found that\nharmonics generated from the isotopic molecules exhibit obvious spectral red\nshift with respect to those from Ar atom. The red shift is further demonstrated\nto arise from the laser-driven nuclear motion in isotopic molecules. By\nutilizing the red shift observed in experiment, we successfully retrieve the\nnuclear vibrations in H2 and D2, which agree well with the theoretical\ncalculations from the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) with\nNon-Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the frequency\nshift can be manipulated by changing the laser chirp.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of light spin-0 particles and stress that they can\nbe efficiently searched for at the LHCb experiment in the form of dimuon\nresonances. Given the large production cross sections in the forward rapidity\nregion together with the efficient triggering and excellent mass resolution, it\nis argued that LHCb can provide unique sensitivity to such states. We\nillustrate our proposal using the recent measurement of Upsilon production by\nLHCb, emphasising the importance of mixing effects in the bottomonium resonance\nregion. The implications for dimuon decays of spin-0 bottomonium states are\nalso briefly discussed.\n", "  Future electromagnetic observations of black holes may allow us to test\nGeneral Relativity in the strong-field regime. Such tests, however, require\nknowledge of rotating black hole solutions in modified gravity theories, a\nclass of which does not admit the Kerr metric as a solution. Several rotating\nblack hole solutions in modified theories have only been found in the\nslow-rotation approximation (i.e. assuming the spin angular momentum is much\nsmaller than the mass squared). We here investigate whether the systematic\nerror due to the approximate nature of these black hole metrics is small enough\nrelative to the observational error to allow their use in electromagnetic\nobservations to constrain deviations from General Relativity. We address this\nby considering whether electromagnetic observables constructed from a\nslow-rotation approximation to the Kerr metric can fit observables constructed\nfrom the full Kerr metric with systematic errors smaller than current\nobservational errors. We focus on black hole shadow and continuum spectrum\nobservations, as these are the least influenced by accretion disk physics, with\ncurrent observational errors of about 10%. We find that the fractional\nsystematic error introduced by using a second-order, slowly-rotating Kerr\nmetric is at most 2% for shadows created by black holes with dimensionless\nspins $\\chi\\leq0.6$. We also find that the systematic error introduced by using\nthe slowly-rotating Kerr metric as an exact metric when constructing continuum\nspectrum observables is negligible for black holes with dimensionless spins of\n$\\chi \\lesssim 0.9$. Our results suggest that the modified gravity solutions\nfound in the slow-rotation approximation may be used to constrain realistic\ndeviations from General Relativity with continuum spectrum and black hole\nshadow observations.\n", "  For a pair of quantum channels with the same input space, we show that the\npossibility of approximation of one channel by post-processings of the other\nchannel can be characterized by comparing the success probabilities for the two\nensembles obtained as outputs for any ensemble on the input space coupled with\nan ancilla. This provides an operational interpretation to a natural extension\nof Le Cam's deficiency to quantum channels. In particular, we obtain a version\nof the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments. The proofs\nare based on some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of\nindependent interest.\n", "  We study Lepton Flavour Violating hadron decays of the tau lepton within the\nSimplest Little Higgs model. Namely we consider $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu (P, V,\nPP)$ where $P$ and $V$ are short for a pseudoscalar and a vector meson. We find\nthat, in the most positive scenarios, branching ratios for these processes are\npredicted to be, at least, four orders of magnitude smaller than present\nexperimental bounds.\n", "  We analyze the short-time behavior of the heat and charge currents through\nnanoscale conductors exposed to a temperature gradient. To this end, we employ\nLuttinger's thermomechanical potential to simulate a sudden change of\ntemperature at one end of the conductor. We find that the direction of the\ncharge current through an impurity is initially opposite to the direction of\nthe charge current in the steady-state limit. Furthermore, we investigate the\ntransient propagation of energy and particle density driven by a temperature\nvariation through a conducting nanowire. Interestingly, we find that the\nvelocity of the wavefronts of, both, the particle and the energy wave have the\nsame constant value, insensitive to changes in the average electronic density.\nIn the steady-state regime, we find that, at low temperatures, the local\ntemperature and potential, as measured by a floating probe lead, exhibit\ncharacteristic oscillations due to quantum interference, with a periodicity\nthat corresponds to half the Fermi wavelength of the electrons.\n", "  The distribution of coherence in multipartite systems in examined. We use a\nnew coherence measure with entropic nature and metric properties, based on the\nquantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. The metric property allows for the coherence\nto be decomposed into various contributions, which arise from local and\nintrinsic coherences. We find that there are trade-off relations between the\nvarious contributions of coherence, as a function of parameters of the quantum\nstate. In bipartite systems the coherence resides on individual sites or\ndistributed among the sites, which contribute in a complementary way. In more\ncomplex systems, the characteristics of the coherence can display more subtle\nchanges with respect to the parameters of the quantum state. In the case of the\nXXZ Heisenberg model, the coherence changes from a monogamous to a polygamous\nnature. This allows us to define the shareability of coherence, leading to\nmonogamy relations for coherence.\n", "  We demonstrate an easily tunable locking scheme for stabilizing frequency-sum\nof two lasers on a two-photon ladder transition based on polarization rotation\nin warm rubidium vapors induced by magnetic field and circularly polarized\ndrive field. Unprecedented tunability of the two-photon offset frequency is due\nto strong splitting and shifting of magnetic states in external field. In our\nexperimental setup we achieve two-photon detuning of up to 700 MHz.\n", "  We propose a practical parametrisation for the line shapes of near-threshold\nstates compatible with all requirements of unitarity and analyticity. The\ncoupled-channel system underlying the proposed parametrisation includes bare\npoles and an arbitrary number of elastic and inelastic channels treated fully\nnonperturbatively. The resulting formulae are general enough to be used for a\nsimultaneous analysis of the data in all available production and decay\nchannels of the (system of) state(s) under consideration for a quite wide class\nof reactions. As an example, we fit the experimental data currently available\nfor several decay channels for the charged $Z_b^{(\\prime)}$ states in the\nspectrum of bottomonia and find a good overall description of the data. We find\nthe present data to be consistent with the $Z_b(10610)$ as a virtual state and\nwith the $Z_b(10650)$ as a resonance, both residing very close to the\n$B\\bar{B}^*$ and $B^*\\bar{B}^*$ threshold, respectively.\n", "  This work contains a detailed analysis of the properties of the ground state\nof a two-component two-sites Bose-Hubbard model, which captures the physics of\na binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a double-well\npotential. The atom-atom interactions within each species and among the two\nspecies are taken as variable parameters while the hopping terms are kept\nfixed. To characterize the ground state we use observables such as the\nimbalance of population and its quantum uncertainty. The quantum many-body\ncorrelations present in the system are further quantified by studying the\ndegree of condensation of each species, the entanglement between the two sites\nand the entanglement between the two species. The latter is measured by means\nof the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entropy or the purity obtained after\ntracing out a part of the system. A number of relevant states are identified,\ne.g. Schr\\\"odinger catlike many-body states, in which the outcome of the\npopulation imbalance of both components is completely correlated, and other\nstates with even larger von Neumann entropy which have a large spread in Fock\nspace.\n", "  Precise luminosity measurements for the OLYMPUS two-photon exchange\nexperiment at DESY were performed by counting scattering events with\nalternating beams of electrons and positrons incident on atomic electrons in a\ngaseous hydrogen target. Final products of M{\\o}ller, Bhabha, and pair\nannihilation interactions were observed using a pair of lead fluoride Cherenkov\ncalorimeters with custom housings and electronics, adapted from a system used\nby the A4 parity violation experiment at MAMI. This paper describes the design,\ncalibration, and operation of these detectors. An explanation of the Monte\nCarlo methods used to simulate the physical processes involved both at the\nscattering vertices and in the detector apparatus is also included.\n", "  We demonstrate that chiral skyrmionic magnetization configurations can be\nfound as the minimum energy state in B20 thin film materials with easy-plane\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy with an applied magnetic field perpendicular to\nthe film plane. Our observations contradict results from prior analytical work,\nbut are compatible with recent experimental investigations. The size of the\nobserved skyrmions increases with the easy-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy.\nWe use a full micromagnetic model including demagnetization and a\nthree-dimensional geometry to find local energy minimum (metastable)\nmagnetization configurations using numerical damped time integration. We\nexplore the phase space of the system and start simulations from a variety of\ninitial magnetization configurations to present a systematic overview of\nanisotropy and magnetic field parameters for which skyrmions are metastable and\nglobal energy minimum (stable) states.\n", "  We present an accurate non-linear matter power spectrum prediction scheme for\na variety of extensions to the standard cosmological paradigm, which uses the\ntuned halo model previously developed in Mead (2015b). We consider dark energy\nmodels that are both minimally and non-minimally coupled, massive neutrinos and\nmodified gravitational forces with chameleon and Vainshtein screening\nmechanisms. In all cases we compare halo-model power spectra to measurements\nfrom high-resolution simulations. We show that the tuned halo model method can\npredict the non-linear matter power spectrum measured from simulations of\nparameterised $w(a)$ dark energy models at the few per cent level for\n$k<10\\,h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and we present theoretically motivated extensions\nto cover non-minimally coupled scalar fields, massive neutrinos and Vainshtein\nscreened modified gravity models that result in few per cent accurate power\nspectra for $k<10\\,h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. For chameleon screened models we\nachieve only 10 per cent accuracy for the same range of scales. Finally, we use\nour halo model to investigate degeneracies between different extensions to the\nstandard cosmological model, finding that the impact of baryonic feedback on\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum can be considered independently of\nmodified gravity or massive neutrino extensions. In contrast, considering the\nimpact of modified gravity and massive neutrinos independently results in\nbiased estimates of power at the level of 5 per cent at scales\n$k>0.5\\,h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. An updated version of our publicly available\nHMcode can be found at https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode\n", "  We study structure of solutions of the recently constructed minimal\nextensions of Einstein's gravity in four dimensions at the quartic curvature\nlevel. The extended higher derivative theory, just like Einstein's gravity, has\nonly a massless spin-two graviton about its unique maximally symmetric vacuum.\nThe extended theory does not admit the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics as exact\nsolutions, hence there is no issue of Schwarzschild type singularity but,\napproximately, outside a source, spherically symmetric metric with the correct\nNewtonian limit is recovered. We also show that for all Einstein space-times,\nsquare of the Riemann tensor (the Kretschmann scalar or the Gauss-Bonnet\ninvariant) obeys a non-linear scalar Klein-Gordon equation.\n", "  Let $H$ be a Schr\\\"odinger type operator with long-range perturbation. We\nstudy the wave front set of the distribution kernel of $(H-\\lambda\\mp\ni0)^{-1}$, where $\\lambda$ is in the absolutely continous spectrumof $H$.The\nresult is a refinement of the microlocal resolvent estimate of Isozaki-Kitada\n\\cite{IK1,IK2}. We prove the result for a class of pseudodifferential operators\non manifolds so that they apply to discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators and higher\norder operators on the Euclidean space. The proof relies on propagation\nestimates, whereas the original proof of Isozaki-Kitada relies on a\nconstruction of parametrices.\n", "  We construct the first-order symmetry operators of Killing spinor equation in\nterms of odd Killing-Yano forms. By modifying the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of\nKilling-Yano forms, we show that the symmetry operators of Killing spinors\nclose into an algebra in AdS_5 spacetime. Since the symmetry operator algebra\nof Killing spinors corresponds to a Jacobi identity in extended Killing\nsuperalgebras, we investigate the possible extensions of Killing superalgebras\nto include higher-degree Killing-Yano forms. We found that there is a\nsuperalgebra extension but no Lie superalgebra extension of the Killing\nsuperalgebra constructed out of Killing spinors and odd Killing-Yano forms in\nAdS_5 background.\n", "  Encoding many qubits in different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons\nis one of the routes towards enlarging the Hilbert space spanned by a photonic\nquantum state. Hyperentangled photon states (i.e. states showing entanglement\nin multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both\nfundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing\nthe number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and\nintegration of the basic elements and functions to guarantee the set-up\nstability. This motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise\ncontrol of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use\nof path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum\ncircuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on\nboth DOFs. Our results pave the way towards the full integration on a chip of\nhybrid multiqubit multiphoton states.\n", "  One of the key challenges of quantum-chemical multi-configuration methods is\nthe necessity to manually select orbitals for the active space. This selection\nrequires both expertise and experience and can therefore impose severe\nlimitations on the applicability of this most general class of ab initio\nmethods. A poor choice of the active orbital space may yield even qualitatively\nwrong results. This is obviously a severe problem, especially for wave function\nmethods that are designed to be systematically improvable. Here, we show how\nthe iterative nature of the density matrix renormalization group combined with\nits capability to include up to about one hundred orbitals in the active space\ncan be exploited for a systematic assessment and selection of active orbitals.\nThese benefits allow us to implement an automated approach for active orbital\nspace selection, which can turn multi-configuration models into black box\napproaches.\n", "  We present a systematic framework to obtain the most general solutions of the\nequations of motion in first order gravity theory with degenerate tetrads.\nThere are many possible solutions. Generically, these exhibit non-vanishing\ntorsion even in the absence of any matter coupling. These solutions are shown\nto contain a special set of eight configurations which are associated with the\nhomogeneous model three-geometries of Thurston.\n", "  Insulating quantum spin liquids can undergo a confinement transition to a\nvalence bond solid state via the condensation of topological excitations of the\nassociated gauge theory. We extend the theory of such transitions to\nfractionalized Fermi liquids (FL*): these are metallic doped spin liquids in\nwhich the Fermi surfaces only have gauge neutral quasiparticles. Using insights\nfrom a duality transform on a doped quantum dimer model for the U(1)-FL* state,\nwe show that projective symmetry group of the theory of the topological\nexcitations remains unmodified, but the Fermi surfaces can lead to additional\nfrustrating interactions. We propose a theory for the confinement transition of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-FL* states via the condensation of visons. A variety of\nconfining, incommensurate density wave states are possible, including some that\nare similar to the incommensurate $d$-form factor density wave order observed\nin several recent experiments on the cuprate superconductors.\n", "  Using the Herschel Space Observatory we have observed a representative sample\nof 87 powerful 3CR sources at redshift z < 1. The far-infrared (FIR, 70-500\nmicron) photometry is combined with mid-infrared (MIR) photometry from the\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and catalogued data to analyse the\ncomplete spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each object from optical to\nradio wavelength. To disentangle the contributions of different components, the\nSEDs are fitted with a set of templates to derive the luminosities of host\ngalaxy starlight, dust torus emission powered by active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nand cool dust heated by stars. The level of emission from relativistic jets is\nalso estimated, in order to isolate the thermal host galaxy contribution. The\nnew data are in line with the orientation-based unification of high-excitation\nradio-loud AGN, in that the dust torus becomes optically thin longwards of 30\nmicron. The low excitation radio galaxies and the MIR weak sources represent\nMIR- and FIR-faint AGN population different from the high-excitation MIR-bright\nobjects; it remains an open question whether they are at a later evolutionary\nstate or an intrinsically different population. The derived luminosities for\nhost starlight and dust heated by star formation are converted to stellar\nmasses and star formation rates (SFR). The host-normalized SFR of the bulk of\nthe 3CR sources is low when compared to other galaxy populations at the same\nepoch. Estimates of the dust mass yield a 1--100 times lower dust/stellar mass\nratio than for the Milky Way, indicating that these 3CR hosts have very low\nlevels of interstellar matter explaining the low level of star formation. Less\nthan 10% of the 3CR sources show levels of star formation above those of the\nmain sequence of star forming galaxies.\n", "  Using techniques from the theories of convex polytopes, lattice paths, and\nindirect influences on directed manifolds, we construct continuous analogues\nfor the binomial coefficients and the Catalan numbers. Our approach for\nconstructing these analogues can be applied to a wide variety of combinatorial\nsequences. As an application we develop a continuous analogue for the binomial\ndistribution.\n", "  Modified theories of gravity provide us with a unique opportunity to generate\ninnovative tests of gravity. In Chameleon f(R) gravity, the gravitational\npotential differs from the weak-field limit of general relativity (GR) in a\nmass dependent way. We develop a probe of gravity which compares high mass\nclusters, where Chameleon effects are weak, to low mass clusters, where the\neffects can be strong. We utilize the escape velocity edges in the\nradius/velocity phase space to infer the gravitational potential profiles on\nscales of 0.3-1 virial radii. We show that the escape edges of low mass\nclusters are enhanced compared to GR, where the magnitude of the difference\ndepends on the background field value |fR0|. We validate our probe using N-body\nsimulations and simulated light cone galaxy data. For a DESI (Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument) Bright Galaxy Sample, including observational\nsystematics, projection effects, and cosmic variance, our test can\ndifferentiate between GR and Chameleon f(R) gravity models, |fR0| = 4e-6 (2e-6)\nat > 5{\\sigma} (> 2{\\sigma}), more than an order of magnitude better than\ncurrent cluster-scale constraints.\n", "  We provide an analytical as well as a numerical study of the holographic\n$s$-wave superconductors in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Power-Maxwell\nelectrodynamics. We limit our study to the case where scalar and gauge fields\ndo not have an effect on the background metric. We use a variational method,\nbased on Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for our analytical study, as well\nas a numerical shooting method in order to compare with our analytical results.\nInterestingly enough, we observe that unlike Born-Infeld-like nonlinear\nelectrodynamics which decrease the critical temperature compared to the linear\nMaxwell field, the Power-Maxwell electrodynamics is able to increase the\ncritical temperature of the holographic superconductors in the sublinear\nregime. We find that requiring the finite value for the gauge field on the\nasymptotic boundary $r\\rightarrow \\infty$, restricts the power parameter, $q$,\nof the Power-Maxwell field to be in the range $1/2<q<{(d-1)}/{2}$. Our study\nindicates that it is quite possible to make condensation \\emph{easier} as $q$\n\\emph{decreases} in its allowed range. We also find that for all values of $q$,\nthe condensation can be affected by the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\\alpha$.\nHowever, the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term makes the transition slightly\nharder. Finally, we obtain an analytic expression for the order parameter and\nthus obtain the associated critical exponent near the phase transition. We find\nthat the critical exponent has its universal value of $\\beta=1/2$ regardless of\nthe parameters $q$, $\\alpha$ as well as dimension $d$, consistent with\nmean-field values obtained in previous studies.\n", "  There is still no general consensus on how one can describe the\nout-of-equilibrium phenomena in matter induced by an ultrashort light pulse. We\ninvestigate the pulse-induced dynamics in a layered Dirac semimetal SrMnBi2 by\npump-and-probe photoemission spectroscopy. At ~<1 ps, the electronic recovery\nslowed upon increasing the pump power. Such a bottleneck-type slowing is\nexpected in a two-temperature model (TTM) scheme, although opposite trends have\nbeen observed to date in graphite and in cuprates. Subsequently, an\nunconventional power-law cooling took place at ~100 ps, indicating that spatial\nheat diffusion is still ill defined at ~100 ps. We identify that the successive\ndynamics before the emergence of heat diffusion is a canonical realization of a\nTTM scheme. Criteria for the applicability of the scheme is also provided.\n", "  In this paper,we have studied phase transitions of higher dimensional charge\nblack hole with spherical symmetry. we calculated the local energy and local\ntemperature, and find that these state parameters satisfy the first law of\nthermodynamics. We analyze the critical behavior of black hole thermodynamic\nsystem by taking state parameters $(Q,\\Phi)$ of black hole thermodynamic\nsystem, in accordance with considering to the state parameters $(P,V)$ of Van\nder Waals system respectively. we obtain the critical point of black hole\nthermodynamic system, and find the critical point is independent of the dual\nindependent variables we selected. This result for asymptotically flat space is\nconsistent with that for AdS spacetime, and is intrinsic property of black hole\nthermodynamic system.\n", "  Several theoretical groups describe the antikaon-nucleon interaction at low\nenergies within approaches based on the chiral SU(3) dynamics and including\nnext-to-leading order contributions. We present a comparative analysis of the\npertinent models and discuss in detail their pole contents. It is demonstrated\nthat the approaches lead to very different predictions for the $K^{-}p$\namplitude extrapolated to subthreshold energies as well as for the $K^{-}n$\namplitude. The origin of the poles generated by the models is traced to the\nso-called zero coupling limit, in which the inter-channel couplings are\nswitched off. This provides new insights into the pole contents of the various\napproaches. In particular, different concepts of forming the $\\Lambda(1405)$\nresonance are revealed and constraints related to the appearance of such poles\nin a given approach are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the low-energy $^9$Be elastic scattering on two different\ntargets (heavy, light) within a four-body framework using the\nContinuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) method. The $^9$Be projectile is\ndescribed in a $\\alpha + \\alpha + n$ three-body model using the analytical\ntransformed harmonic oscillator (THO) basis in hyperspherical coordinates. We\nshow that continuum couplings are important to describe the elastic cross\nsection, especially at low energies and on heavy targets. The dipolar\ncontribution to the elastic cross section at energies around the Coulomb\nbarrier is important but small compared to the case of halo nuclei. The effect\nof the projectile low-energy resonances is also relevant. The agreement with\nthe available experimental data supports the reliability of the method to\ndescribe reactions induced by three-body projectiles including more than one\ncharged particle.\n", "  It has been recently shown that the flavor composition of a self-interacting\nneutrino gas can spontaneously acquire a time-dependent pulsating component\nduring its flavor evolution. In this work, we perform a more detailed study of\nthis effect in a model where neutrinos are assumed to be emitted in a\ntwo-dimensional plane from an infinite line that acts as a neutrino antenna. We\nconsider several examples with varying matter and neutrino densities and find\nthat temporal instabilities with various frequencies are excited in a cascade.\nWe compare the numerical calculations of the flavor evolution with the\npredictions of linearized stability analysis of the equations of motion. The\nresults obtained with these two approaches are in good agreement in the linear\nregime, while a dramatic speed-up of the flavor conversions occurs in the\nnon-linear regime due to the interactions among the different pulsating modes.\nWe show that large flavor conversions can take place if some of the temporal\nmodes are unstable for long enough, and that this can happen even if the matter\nand neutrino densities are changing, as long as they vary slowly.\n", "  A systematic investigation of octupole deformed nuclei is presented for\neven-even systems with $Z\\leq 106$ located between the two-proton and\ntwo-neutron drip lines. For this study we use five most up-to-date covariant\nenergy density functionals of different types, with a non-linear meson\ncoupling, with density dependent meson couplings, and with density-dependent\nzero-range interactions. Pairing correlations are treated within relativistic\nHartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory based on an effective separable\nparticle-particle interaction of finite range. This allows us to assess\ntheoretical uncertainties within the present covariant models for the\nprediction of physical observables relevant for octupole deformed nuclei. In\naddition, a detailed comparison with the predictions of non-relativistic models\nis performed. A new region of octupole deformation, centered around $Z\\sim 98,\nN\\sim 196$ is predicted for the first time. In terms of its size in the $(Z,N)$\nplane and the impact of octupole deformation on binding energies this region is\nsimilar to the best known region of octupole deformed nuclei centered at $Z\\sim\n90, N\\sim 136$. For the later island of octupole deformed nuclei, the\ncalculations suggest substantial increase of its size as compared with\navailable experimental data.\n", "  This article reports an improved independent measurement of neutrino mixing\nangle $\\theta_{13}$ at the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. Electron\nantineutrinos were identified by inverse $\\beta$-decays with the emitted\nneutron captured by hydrogen, yielding a data-set with principally distinct\nuncertainties from that with neutrons captured by gadolinium. With the final\ntwo of eight antineutrino detectors installed, this study used 621 days of data\nincluding the previously reported 217-day data set with six detectors. The\ndominant statistical uncertainty was reduced by 49%. Intensive studies of the\ncosmogenic muon-induced $^9$Li and fast neutron backgrounds and the\nneutron-capture energy selection efficiency, resulted in a reduction of the\nsystematic uncertainty by 26%. The deficit in the detected number of\nantineutrinos at the far detectors relative to the expected number based on the\nnear detectors yielded $\\sin^22\\theta_{13} = 0.071 \\pm 0.011$ in the\nthree-neutrino-oscillation framework. The combination of this result with the\ngadolinium-capture result is also reported.\n", "  A new, so called odd Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible\ncovariant tensor representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n). The related\nGel'fand-Zetlin patterns are based upon the decomposition according to a\nparticular chain of subalgebras of gl(n|n). This chain contains only genuine\nLie superalgebras of type gl(k|l) with k and l nonzero (apart from the final\nelement of the chain which is gl(1|0)=gl(1)). Explicit expressions for a set of\ngenerators of the algebra on this Gel'fand-Zetlin basis are determined. The\nresults are extended to an explicit construction of a class of irreducible\nhighest weight modules of the general linear Lie superalgebra\ngl(\\infty|\\infty).\n", "  Of all the activity observed on the Sun, two of the most energetic events are\nflares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Usually, solar active regions that\nproduce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true\n(Yashiro et al., 2005). Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still\nunclear which circumstances will produce a CME (Webb & Howard, 2012).\nTherefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish\nflares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no\nextensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to\ndistinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by\nusing features derived from [1] photospheric vector magnetic field data taken\nby the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument\nand [2] X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that\neither produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare\n(the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to [1] determine\nwhich features distinguish these two populations, and [2] forecast whether an\nactive region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We\ncompute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that\nit is a relatively high value of approximately 0.8 plus or minus 0.2. We\nconclude that a combination of six parameters, which are all intensive in\nnature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the\nphotospheric magnetic field.\n", "  Current and future continuum surveys being undertaken by the new generation\nof radio telescopes are now poised to address many important science questions,\nranging from the earliest galaxies, to the physics of nearby AGN, as well as\npotentially providing new and unexpected discoveries. However, how to\nefficiently analyse the large quantities of data collected by these studies in\norder to maximise their scientific output remains an open question. In these\nproceedings we present details of the surveys module for the Broadband Radio\nAstronomy Tools (BRATS) software package which will combine new observations\nwith existing multi-frequency data in order to automatically analyse and select\nsources based on their spectrum. We show how these methods can been applied to\ninvestigate objects observed on a variety of spatial scales, and suggest a\npathway for how this can be used in the wider context of surveys and large\nsamples.\n", "  The memory function formalism is an important tool to evaluate the frequency\ndependent electronic conductivity. It is previously used within some\napproximations in the case of electrons interacting with various other degrees\nof freedom in metals with great success. However, one needs to go beyond those\napproximations as the interaction strengths become stronger. In this work, we\npropose a systematic expansion of the memory function involving its various\nmoments. We calculate the higher order contribution to the generalized Drude\nscattering rate in case of electron-impurity interactions. Further we compare\nour results with the results from previously studied lowest order calculations.\nWe find larger contributions from the higher moments in the low frequency\nregime and also in the case of larger interaction strength.\n", "  We present initial analysis and conclusions from plasma observations made\nduring the reported \"Mars plume event\" of March - April 2012. During this\nperiod, multiple independent amateur observers detected a localized,\nhigh-altitude \"plume\" over the Martian dawn terminator [Sanchez-Lavega et al.,\nNature, 2015, doi:10.1038/nature14162], the cause of which remains to be\nexplained. The estimated brightness of the plume exceeds that expected for\nauroral emissions, and its projected altitude greatly exceeds that at which\nclouds are expected to form. We report on in-situ measurements of ionospheric\nplasma density and solar wind parameters throughout this interval made by Mars\nExpress, obtained over the same surface region, but at the opposing terminator.\nMeasurements in the ionosphere at the corresponding location frequently show a\ndisturbed structure, though this is not atypical for such regions with intense\ncrustal magnetic fields. We tentatively conclude that the formation and/or\ntransport of this plume to the altitudes where it was observed could be due in\npart to the result of a large interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)\nencountering the Martian system. Interestingly, we note that the only similar\nplume detection in May 1997 may also have been associated with a large ICME\nimpact at Mars.\n", "  Dielectronic recombination (DR) is a key atomic process which affects the\nspectroscopic diagnostic modelling of tungsten, most of whose ionization stages\nwill be found somewhere in the ITER fusion reactor: in the edge, divertor, or\ncore plasma. Accurate DR data is sparse while complete DR coverage is\nunsophisticated (e.g. average-atom or Burgess General Formula) as illustrated\nby the large uncertainties which currently exist in the tungsten ionization\nbalance. To this end, we present a series of partial final state-resolved and\ntotal DR rate coefficients for W73+ to W56+ Tungsten ions. This is part of a\nwider effort within The Tungsten Project to calculate accurate dielectronic\nrecombination rate coefficients for the tungsten isonuclear sequence for use in\ncollisional-radiative modelling of finite-density tokamak plasmas. The\nrecombination rate coefficients have been calculated with autostructure using\nkappa-averaged relativistic wavefunctions in level resolution (intermediate\ncoupling) and configuration resolution (configuration average). The results are\navailable from OPEN-ADAS according to the adf09 and adf48 standard formats.\nComparison with previous calculations of total DR rate coefficients for W63+\nand W56+ yield agreement to within 20% and 10%, respectively, at peak\ntemperature. It is also seen that the Juttner correction to the Maxwell\ndistribution has a significant effect on the ionization balance of tungsten at\nthe highest charge states, changing both the peak abundance temperatures and\nthe ionization fractions of several ions.\n", "  We report on the search for spectral irregularities induced by oscillations\nbetween photons and axionlike-particles (ALPs) in the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of\nNGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster. Using six years of Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope data, we find no evidence for ALPs and exclude couplings\nabove $5\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses $0.5 \\lesssim m_a\n\\lesssim 5$ neV at 95% confidence. The limits are competitive with the\nsensitivity of planned laboratory experiments, and, together with other bounds,\nstrongly constrain the possibility that ALPs can reduce the $\\gamma$-ray\nopacity of the Universe.\n", "  Half-metals and spin gapless semiconductors are promising candidates for\nspintronic applications due to the complete (100%) spin polarization of\nelectrons around the Fermi level. Based on recent experimental and theoretical\nfindings of graphene-like monolayer transition metal carbides and nitrides\n(also known as MXenes), we demonstrate from first-principles calculations that\nmonolayer Ti2C and Ti2N exhibit nearly half-metallic ferromagnetism with the\nmagnetic moments of 1.91 and 1.00 UB per formula unit, respectively, while\nmonolayer V2C is a metal with instable antiferromagnetism, and monolayer V2N is\na nonmagnetic metal. Interestingly, under a biaxial strain, there is a phase\ntransition from nearly half-metal to truly half-metal, spin gapless\nsemiconductor, and metal for monolayer Ti2C. Monolayer Ti2N is still a nearly\nhalf-metal under a proper biaxial strain. Large magnetic moments can be induced\nby the biaxial tensile and compressive strains for monolayer V2C and V2N,\nrespectively. We also show that the structures of these four monolayer MXenes\nare stable according to the calculated formation energy and phonon spectrum.\nOur investigations suggest that, unlike monolayer graphene, monolayer MXenes\nTi2C and Ti2N without vacancy, doping or external electric field exhibit\nintrinsic magnetism, especially the half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin\ngapless semiconductivity, which will stimulate further studies on possible\nspintronic applications for new two-dimensional materials of MXenes.\n", "  We present a model for describing the general structure of molecular clouds\n(MCs) at early evolutionary stages in terms of their mass-size relationship.\nSizes are defined through threshold levels at which equipartitions between\ngravitational, turbulent and thermal energy $|W| \\sim f(E_{\\rm kin} + E_{\\rm\nth})$ take place, adopting interdependent scaling relations of velocity\ndispersion and density and assuming a lognormal density distribution at each\nscale. Variations of the equipartition coefficient $1\\le f\\le 4$ allow for\nmodelling of star-forming regions at scales within the size range of typical\nMCs ($\\gtrsim$4 pc). Best fits are obtained for regions with low or no star\nformation (Pipe, Polaris) as well for such with star-forming activity but with\nnearly lognormal distribution of column density (Rosette). An additional\nnumerical test of the model suggests its applicability to cloud evolutionary\ntimes prior to the formation of first stars.\n", "  We construct new models of outer heat blanketing envelopes of neutron stars\ncomposed of binary ion mixtures (H - He, He - C, C - Fe) in and out of\ndiffusive equilibrium. To this aim, we generalize our previous work on\ndiffusion of ions in isothermal gaseous or Coulomb liquid plasmas to handle\nnon-isothermal systems. We calculate the relations between the effective\nsurface temperature Ts and the temperature Tb at the bottom of heat blanketing\nenvelopes (at a density rhob= 1e8 -- 1e10 g/cc) for diffusively equilibrated\nand non-equilibrated distributions of ion species at different masses DeltaM of\nlighter ions in the envelope. Our principal result is that the Ts - Tb\nrelations are fairly insensitive to detailed distribution of ion fractions over\nthe envelope (diffusively equilibrated or not) and depend almost solely on\nDeltaM. The obtained relations are approximated by analytic expressions which\nare convenient for modeling the evolution of neutron stars.\n", "  A recently proposed theory of chiral discrimination in NMR spectroscopy based\non the detection of a molecular electric polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ rotating in\na plane perpendicular to the NMR magnetic field [A. D. Buckingham, J. Chem.\nPhys. $\\mathbf{140}$, 011103 (2014)], is here generalized to paramagnetic\nsystems. Our theory predicts new contributions to $\\mathbf{P}$, varying as the\nsquare of the inverse temperature. Ab initio calculations for ten Dy$^{3+}$\ncomplexes, at 293K, show that in strongly anisotropic paramagnetic molecules\n$\\mathbf{P}$ can be more than 1000 times larger than in diamagnetic molecules,\nmaking paramagnetic NMR chiral discrimination amenable to room temperature\ndetection.\n", "  Hybrid InSb nanowire-superconductor devices are promising for investigating\nMajorana modes and topological quantum computation in solid-state devices. An\nexperimental realisation of ballistic, phase-coherent superconductor-nanowire\nhybrid devices is a necessary step towards engineering topological\nsuperconducting electronics. Here, we report on a low-temperature transport\nstudy of Josephson junction devices fabricated from InSb nanowires grown by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy and provide a clear evidence for phase-coherent,\nballistic charge transport through the nanowires in the junctions. We\ndemonstrate that our devices show gate-tunable proximity-induced supercurrent\nand clear signatures of multiple Andreev reflections in the differential\nconductance, indicating phase-coherent transport within the junctions. We also\nobserve periodic modulations of the critical current that can be associated\nwith the Fabry-P\\'{e}rot interference in the nanowires in the ballistic\ntransport regime. Our work shows that the InSb nanowires grown by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy are of excellent material quality and hybrid\nsuperconducting devices made from these nanowires are highly desirable for\ninvestigation of the novel physics in topological states of matter and for\napplications in topological quantum electronics.\n", "  We introduce positive elastic potentials in the harmonic approximation\nleading by Hamilton's variational principle to fractional Laplacian matrices\nhaving the forms of power law matrix functions of the simple local Bornvon\nKarman Laplacian. The fractional Laplacian matrices are well defined on\nperiodic and infinite lattices in $n=1,2,3,..$ dimensions. The present approach\ngeneralizes the central symmetric second differenceoperator (Born von Karman\nLaplacian) to its fractional central symmetric counterpart (Fractional\nLaplacian matrix).For non-integer powers of the Born von Karman Laplacian, the\nfractional Laplacian matrix is nondiagonal with nonzero matrix elements\neverywhere, corresponding to nonlocal behavior: For large lattices the matrix\nelements far from the diagonal expose power law asymptotics leading to\ncontinuum limit kernels of Riesz fractional derivative type. We present\nexplicit results for the fractional Laplacian matrix in 1D for finite periodic\nand infinite linear chains and their Riesz fractional derivative continuum\nlimit kernels.The approach recovers for $\\alpha=2$ the well known classical\nBorn von Karman linear chain (1D lattice) with local next neighbor\nspringsleading in the well known continuum limit of classic local standard\nelasticity, and for other integer powers to gradient elasticity.We also present\na generalization of the fractional Laplacian matrix to n-dimensional cubic\nperiodic (nD tori) and infinite lattices. For the infinite nD lattice we\ndeducea convenient integral representation.We demonstrate that our fractional\nlattice approach is a powerful tool to generate physically admissible nonlocal\nlattice material models and their continuum representations.\n", "  Complex systems show the capacity to aggregate information and to display\ncoordinated activity. In the case of social systems the interaction of\ndifferent individuals leads to the emergence of norms, trends in political\npositions, opinions, cultural traits, and even scientific progress. Examples of\ncollective behavior can be observed in activities like the Wikipedia and Linux,\nwhere individuals aggregate their knowledge for the benefit of the community,\nand citizen science, where the potential of collectives to solve complex\nproblems is exploited. Here, we conducted an online experiment to investigate\nthe performance of a collective when solving a guessing problem in which each\nactor is endowed with partial information and placed as the nodes of an\ninteraction network. We measure the performance of the collective in terms of\nthe temporal evolution of the accuracy, finding no statistical difference in\nthe performance for two classes of networks, regular lattices and random\nnetworks. We also determine that a Bayesian description captures the behavior\npattern the individuals follow in aggregating information from neighbors to\nmake decisions. In comparison with other simple decision models, the strategy\nfollowed by the players reveals a suboptimal performance of the collective. Our\ncontribution provides the basis for the micro-macro connection between\nindividual based descriptions and collective phenomena.\n", "  Landauer's formula is the standard theoretical tool to examine ballistic\ntransport in nano- and meso-scale junctions, but it necessitates that any\nvariation of the junction with time must be slow compared to characteristic\ntimes of the system, e.g., the relaxation time of local excitations. Transport\nthrough structurally dynamic junctions is, however, increasingly of interest\nfor sensing, harnessing fluctuations, and real-time control. Here, we calculate\nthe steady-state current when relaxation of electrons in the reservoirs is\npresent and demonstrate that it gives rise to three regimes of behavior: weak\nrelaxation gives a contact-limited current; strong relaxation localizes\nelectrons, distorting their natural dynamics and reducing the current; and in\nan intermediate regime the Landauer view of the system only is recovered. We\nalso demonstrate that a simple equation of motion emerges, which is suitable\nfor efficiently simulating time-dependent transport.\n", "  Inspired from the idea of minimally coupling of a real scalar field to\ngeometry, we investigate the classical and quantum models of a flat\nenergy-dependent FRW cosmology coupled to a perfect fluid in the framework of\nthe scalar-rainbow metric gravity. We use the standard Schutz' representation\nfor the perfect fluid and show that under a particular energy-dependent gauge\nfixing, it may lead to the identification of a time parameter for the\ncorresponding dynamical system. It is shown that, under some circumstances on\nthe minisuperspace prob energy, the classical evolution of the of the universe\nrepresents a late time expansion coming from a bounce instead of the big-bang\nsingularity. Then we go forward by showing that this formalism gives rise to a\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum-mechanical\ndescription of the model under consideration, the eigenfunctions of which can\nbe used to construct the wave function of the universe. We use the resulting\nwave function in order to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of\nclassical singularities due to quantum effects by means of the many-worlds and\nBohmian interpretation of quantum cosmology.\n", "  The first run of the LHC showed hints of a new resonance with mass near $1.9$\nTeV decaying into electroweak gauge boson pairs as well as into dijets. While\nRun 2 has neither confirmed nor ruled out such a resonance, it has yielded new\nconstraints on models attempting to explain these decays. Additionally in $W'$\nmodels where this new resonance is a charged vector boson that is a weak\nisospin singlet there is the potential for conflict with the electroweak\nprecision $T$ parameter. We construct variants of a $W'$ resonance model that\nprovide an excellent fit to both Run 1 and Run 2 data, as well as electroweak\nprecision measurements. The model also predicts a neutral vector boson, a $Z'$,\nwith mass close to $3$ TeV. This $Z'$ is compatible with the intriguing Run 2\nobservation of a dielectron pair with invariant mass of $2.9$ TeV at CMS.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of molecular clouds (MCs) with\nself-consistent CO gas-phase and isotope chemistry in various environments. The\nsimulations are post-processed with a line radiative transfer code to obtain\n$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission maps for the $J=1\\rightarrow0$ rotational\ntransition. The emission maps are analysed with commonly used observational\nmethods, i.e. the $^{13}$CO column density measurement, the virial mass\nestimate and the so-called $X_{\\textrm{CO}}$ (also CO-to-H$_2$) conversion\nfactor, and then the inferred quantities (i.e. mass and column density) are\ncompared to the physical values. We generally find that most methods examined\nhere recover the CO-emitting H$_{2}$ gas mass of MCs within a factor of two\nuncertainty if the metallicity is not too low. The exception is the $^{13}$CO\ncolumn density method. It is affected by chemical and optical depth issues, and\nit measures both the true H$_{2}$ column density distribution and the molecular\nmass poorly. The virial mass estimate seems to work the best in the considered\nmetallicity and radiation field strength range, even when the overall virial\nparameter of the cloud is above the equilibrium value. This is explained by a\nsystematically lower virial parameter (i.e. closer to equilibrium) in the\nCO-emitting regions; in CO emission, clouds might seem (sub-)virial, even when,\nin fact, they are expanding or being dispersed. A single CO-to-H$_{2}$\nconversion factor appears to be a robust choice over relatively wide ranges of\ncloud conditions, unless the metallicity is low. The methods which try to take\nthe metallicity dependence of the conversion factor into account tend to\nsystematically overestimate the true cloud masses.\n", "  One-dimensional Bose-Hubbard models are well known to obey a transition from\nregular to quantum-chaotic spectral statistics. We are extending this concept\nto relatively simple two-dimensional many-body models. Also in two dimensions a\ntransition from regular to chaotic spectral statistics is found and discussed.\nIn particular, we analyze the dependence of the spectral properties on the bond\nnumber of the two-dimensional lattices and the applied boundary conditions. For\nmaximal connectivity, the systems behave most regularly in agreement with the\napplicability of mean-field approaches in the limit of many nearest-neighbor\ncouplings at each site.\n", "  By combining the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system with the LHC\nexperiments, a powerful search machine for new physics beyond the standard\nmodel can be realised. The pair of final state protons in the central\nproduction process, exit the LHC beam vacuum chamber at locations determined by\ntheir fractional momentum losses and will be detected by the BLM detectors. By\nmapping out the coincident pairs of the BLM identified proton candidates around\nthe four LHC interaction regions, a scan for centrally produced particle states\ncan be made independently of their decay modes.\n", "  Supernova (SN) explosions play an important role in the development of\ngalactic structures. The energy and momentum imparted on the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in so-called \"supernova feedback\" drives turbulence, heats the\ngas, enriches it with heavy elements, can lead to the formation of new stars or\neven suppress star formation by disrupting stellar nurseries. In the numerical\nsimulation at the sub-galactic level, not including the energy and momentum of\nsupernovas in the physical description of the problem can also lead to several\nproblems that might partially be resolved by including a description of\nsupernovas. In this thesis such an implementation is attempted for the combined\nnumerical hydrodynamics and N-body simulation software Arepo (Springel, 2010)\nfor the high density gas in the ISM only. This allows supernova driven\nturbulence in boxes of 400pc cubed to be studied. In a stochastic process a\nlarge amount of thermal energy is imparted on a number of neighbouring cells,\nmimicking the effect of a supernova explosions. We test this approach by\nmodelling the explosion of a single supernova in a uniform density medium and\ncomparing the evolution of the resulting supernova remnant to the\ntheoretically-predicted behaviour. We also run a simulation with our feedback\ncode and a fixed supernova rate derived from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation\n(Kennicutt, 1998) for a duration of about 20 Myrs. We describe our method in\ndetail in this text and discuss the properties of our implementation. vii\n", "  This paper presents the potential research on holographic Schwinger effect\nwith rotating probe D3-brane etc. We discover, for zero temperature case in the\nSchwinger effect, the faster the angular velocity, the farther the distance of\nthe test particles pair at D3-brane, the potential barrier of total potential\nenergy also grows higher and wider. This paper discovers: at finite\ntemperature, when S5 without rotation near the horizon, there is the failure of\nthe Schwinger effect because the particles will remain at annihilate state,\nwhich is an absolute vacuum state. However, the angular velocity in S5 will\navoid the existence of the absolute vacuum near the horizon. Both zero and\nfinite temperature states, the achieved results completely agree with the\nresults of the DBI action. So the theories of this paper are consistent, all\nthese show that these theories will play important roles in pair production\nresearch in the future.\n", "  A three-step process has been demonstrated to improve the performance of\nphotodiode by creating nanocone forest on the surface of photodiode as an\nantireflection layer. This high-throughput, low-cost process has been shown to\ndecrease the reflectivity by 66.1%, enhance the quantum efficiency by 27%, and\nincrease the responsivity by 25.7%. This low-cost manufacture process can be\napplied to increase the responsivity of silicon based photonic devices.\n", "  The study of extrasolar planets has rapidly expanded to encompass the search\nfor new planets, measurements of sizes and masses, models of planetary\ninteriors, planetary demographics and occurrence frequencies, the\ncharacterization of planetary orbits and dynamics, and studies of these worlds'\ncomplex atmospheres. Our insights into exoplanets dramatically advance whenever\nimproved tools and techniques become available, and surely the largest tools\nnow being planned are the optical/infrared Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).\nTwo themes summarize the advantages of atmospheric studies with the ELTs: high\nangular resolution when operating at the diffraction limit and high spectral\nresolution enabled by the unprecedented collecting area of these large\ntelescopes. This brief review describes new opportunities afforded by the ELTs\nto study the composition, structure, dynamics, and evolution of these planets'\natmospheres, while specifically focusing on some of the most compelling\natmospheric science cases for four qualitatively different planet populations:\nhighly irradiated gas giants, young, hot giant planets, old, cold gas giants,\nand small planets and Earth analogs.\n", "  The intensities of the low energy part of the spectra of primary cosmic ray\nnuclei including C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe measured by Voyager 1 beyond the\nheliopause are deficient relative to the spectra measured at energies above\n~100 MeV/nuc as calculated using a standard Leaky Box Model with the path\nlength a function of rigidity. Modifications to the normal exponential\ndistribution of path lengths at a single rigidity as is used in a simple LBM\nwill provide a good fit to this new Voyager 1 data at low energies. These\nmodifications, sometimes called a truncation, lead to a deficiency of short\npath lengths relative to an exponential distribution. This deficiency in the\nintensities can be described by a truncation parameter = 0.12. This\nmodification can be produced in several ways including a non-uniform local\ndistribution of cosmic ray sources. A uniform source distribution in the\ngalactic plane that is deficient in sources within 0.2-0.4 Kpc of the Sun is\nindicated by the data. Further studies of these low energy spectra in more\ndetail will improve these estimates and help define other features of the local\ngalactic distribution of these cosmic rays.\n", "  In the drive towards higher strength alloys, a diverse range of alloying\nelements is employed to enhance their strength and ductility. Limited solid\nsolubility of these elements in steel leads to segregation during casting which\naffects the entire down-stream processing and eventually the mechanical\nproperties of the finished product. Although it is thought that the presence of\ncontinuous bands lead to premature failure, it has not been possible to verify\nthis link. This poses as increasingly greater risk for higher alloyed, higher\nstrength steels which are prone to centre-line segregation: it is thus vital to\nbe able to predict the mechanical behaviour of multi-phase (MP) steels under\nloading.\n  This review covers the microstructure and properties of galvanised advanced\nhigh strength steels with particular emphasis to their use in automotive\napplications. In order to understand the origins of banding, the origins of\nsegregation of alloying elements during casting and partitioning in the solid\nstate will be discussed along with the effects on the mechanical behaviour and\ndamage evolution under (tensile) loading. Attention will also be paid to the\napplication of microstructural models in tailoring the production process to\nenable suppression of the effects of segregation upon banding. Finally, the\ntheory and application of the experimental techniques used in this work to\nelucidate the structure and properties will be examined.\n", "  Quantum Mechanics, the physical theory describing the microworld, represents\none of science's greatest triumphs. It lies at the root of all modern digital\ntechnologies and offers unparalleled correspondence between prediction and\nexperiments. Remarkably, however, after more than 100 years it is still unclear\nwhat quantum mechanics means in terms of basic philosophical questions about\nthe nature of reality. While there are many interpretations of the mathematical\nmachinery of quantum physics, there remains no experimental means to\ndistinguish between most of them.\n  In this contribution, (based on a discussion at the NYAS), I wish to consider\nthe ways in which the enduring lack of an agreed upon interpretation of quantum\nphysics influences a number of critical philosophical debates about physics and\nreality. I briefly review two problems effected by quantum interpretations: the\nmeaning of the term 'Universe' and the nature of consciousness. In what follows\nI am explicitly not advocating for any particular quantum interpretation.\nInstead, I am interested in how the explicit inability of modern physics to\nexperimentally distinguish between interpretations with wildly divergent\nontological/epistemological implications plays into discussions of physics and\nits description of the world.\n", "  Conway and Kochen's Free Will Theory is examined as an important foundational\nelement in a new area of activity in computer science - developing protocols\nfor quantum computing\n", "  The history of the gravitational wave experiments at the Frascati National\nLaboratories of INFN is described, from the early suggestion of Edoardo Amaldi\nto the realization of NAUTILUS, the most sensitive detector at the end of the\nXXth century.\n", "  Aristotle has split physics at the sphere of the moon; above this sphere\nthere is no change except eternal spherical motion, below are two different\nkinds of motion: Natural motion (without specific cause) and enforced motion.\nIn modern view motion is caused by gravity and by other forces. The split at\nthe sphere of the moon has been definitely overcome through the observation of\na supernova and several comets by Tycho Brahe. The second distinction was\neradicated by Isaak Newton who showed that gravitational motion was caused by a\nforce proportional to the inverse square of the distance. By the theory of\nGeneral Relativity, Albert Einstein showed that there is no gravitational force\nbut motion under gravity (i.e. Aristotles <natural motion>) is caused by the\ncurved geometry of spacetime. In this way, the Aristotelian distinction between\nnatural motion and enforced motion has come back in the form of two great\ntheories: General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory which are today\nincompatible. To find a way out of this dilemma is the challenge of modern\nphysics.\n", "  Mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequency combs have broad applications in molecular\nspectroscopy and chemical/biological sensing. Recently developed\nmicroresonator-based combs in this wavelength regime could enable portable and\nrobust devices using a single-frequency pump field. Here, we report the first\ndemonstration of a modelocked microresonator-based frequency comb in the mid-IR\nspanning 2.4 {\\mu}m to 4.3 {\\mu}m. We observe high pump-to-comb conversion\nefficiency, in which 40% of the pump power is converted to the output comb\npower. Utilizing an integrated PIN structure allows for tuning the silicon\nmicroresonator and controling modelocking and cavity soliton formation,\nsimplifying the generation, monitoring and stabilization of mid-IR frequency\ncombs via free-carrier detection and control. Our results significantly advance\nmicroresonator-based comb technology towards a portable and robust mid-IR\nspectroscopic device that operates at low pump powers.\n", "  We study the degree of entanglement of arbitrary superpositions of $m,n$\nphoton-added coherent states (PACS) $|\\psi\\rangle \\propto u |{\\alpha},m\\rangle\n|{\\beta},n \\rangle+ v |{\\beta},n\\rangle |{\\alpha},m\\rangle$ using the\nconcurrence, and obtain the general conditions for maximal entanglement. We\nshow that photon addition process can be identified as an entanglement enhancer\noperation for superpositions of coherent states (SCS). Specifically for the\nknown bipartite positive SCS: $|\\psi\\rangle \\propto |\\alpha\\rangle_a\n|-\\alpha\\rangle_b + |-\\alpha\\rangle_a |\\alpha\\rangle_b $ whose entanglement\ntends to zero for $\\alpha \\to 0$, can be maximal if al least one photon is\nadded in a subsystem. A full family of maximally entangled PACS is also\npresented. We also analyzed the decoherence effects in the entangled PACS\ninduced by a simple depolarizing channel. We find that robustness against\ndepolarization is increased by adding photons to the coherent states of the\nsuperposition. We obtain the dependence of the critical depolarization\n$p_{\\text{crit}}$ for null entanglement as a function of $m,n, \\alpha$ and\n$\\beta $.\n", "  A multi-peaked version of the analytically extended function (AEF) intended\nfor approximation of multi-peaked lightning current wave-forms will be\npresented along with some of its basic properties. A general framework for\nestimating the parameters of the AEF using the Marquardt least-squares method\n(MLSM) for a waveform with an arbitrary (finite) number of peaks as well as a\ngiven charge trans-fer and specific energy will also be described. This\nframework is used to find parameters for some common single-peak wave-forms and\nsome advantages and disadvantages of the approach will be discussed.\n", "  The Pauli exclusion principle plays an important role in many-body fermion\nsystems preventing them from collapsing by repulsion. For example, the Pauli\nprinciple causes a repulsive potential at short distances between two $\\alpha$\nparticles. On the other hand, the existence of nuclear rainbows demonstrates\nthat the inter-nuclear potential is sufficiently attractive in the internal\nregion to cause refraction. The two concepts of repulsion and attraction are\nseemingly irreconcilable. Contrary to traditional understanding, it is shown\nthat the Pauli principle causes a {\\it universal structural Pauli attraction}\nbetween nuclei rather than a {\\it structural repulsive core}. Through\nsystematic studies of $\\alpha$+$\\alpha$, $\\alpha$+$^{16}$O, $\\alpha$+$^{40}$Ca\nand $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O systems, it is shown that the emergence of cluster\nstructures near the threshold energy at low energies and nuclear rainbows at\nhigh energies is a direct consequence of the Pauli principle.\n", "  Thin block copolymer films have attracted considerable academic attention\nbecause of their ability to self-assemble into various microstructures, many of\nwhich have potential technological applications. Despite the ongoing interest,\nlittle effort has focused on the onset of plasticity and failure which are\nimportant factors for the eventual adoption of these materials. Here we use\ndelamination to impart a quantifiable local stain on thin films of homopolymer\npolystyrene and poly(2-vinylpyridine), as well as block copolymers made of\nstyrene and 2-vinylpyridine. Direct observation of the damage caused by bending\nwith atomic force microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy, leads to\nthe identification of a critical strain for the onset of plasticity. Moving\nbeyond our initial scaling analysis, the more quantitative analysis presented\nhere shows strain levels for thick films to be comparable to bulk measurements.\nMonitoring the critical strain leads to several observations: 1.) as-cast\nPS-P2VP has low critical strain, 2.) annealing slowly increases critical strain\nas microstructural ordering takes place, and 3.) similar to the homopolymer,\nboth as cast and ordered films both show increasing critical strain under\nconfinement.\n", "  Materials science has been intensively developed during the last 30 years.\nThis is due, on the one hand, to an increasing demand of new materials for new\napplications and, on the other hand, to technological progress which allows for\nthe synthesis of materials of desired characteristics and to investigate their\nproperties with sophisticated experimental apparatus. Among these advanced\nmaterials, magnetic materials at nanometric scale such as ultra thin films or\nultra fine aggregates are no doubt among the most important for electronic\ndevices.In this review, we show advanced theoretical methods and solved\nexamples that help understand microscopic mechanisms leading to experimental\nobservations in magnetic thin films. Attention is paid to the case of\nmagnetically frustrated systems in which two or more magnetic interactions are\npresent and competing. The interplay between spin frustration and surface\neffects is the origin of spectacular phenomena which often occur at boundaries\nof phases with different symmetries: reentrance, disorder lines, coexistence of\norder and disorder at equilibrium. These phenomena are shown and explained\nusing of some exact methods, the Green's function and Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe show in particular how to calculate surface spin-wave modes, surface\nmagnetization, surface reorientation transition and spin transport.\n", "  Starting from the general expression for the ground state correlation energy\nin the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem (ACFDT) framework,\nit is shown that the dielectric matrix formulation, which is usually applied to\ncalculate the direct random phase approximation (dRPA) correlation energy, can\nbe used for alternative RPA expressions including exchange effects. Within this\nfamework, the ACFDT analog of the second order screened exchange (SOSEX)\napproximation leads to a logarithmic formula for the correlation energy similar\nto the direct RPA expression. Alternatively, the contribution of the exchange\ncan be included in the kernel used to evaluate the response functions. In this\ncase the use of an approximate kernel is crucial to simplify the formalism and\nto obtain a correlation energy in logarithmic form. Technical details of the\nimplementation of these methods are discussed and it is shown that one can take\nadvantage of density fitting or Cholesky decomposition techniques to improve\nthe computational efficiency; a discussion on the numerical quadrature made on\nthe frequency variable is also provided. A series of test calculations on\natomic correlation energies and molecular reaction energies shows that exchange\neffects are instrumental to improve over direct RPA results.\n", "  A general treatment of the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is presented\nwhich is valid for an arbitrary system-environment model in the weak\nsystem-environment coupling regime. It is shown that the effective lifetime of\na quantum state that is subjected to repeated projective measurements depends\non the overlap of the spectral density of the environment and a generalized\n`filter function' which in turn depends on the system state that is repeatedly\nbeing prepared, the measurement interval, the system parameters, the\nsystem-environment coupling, and the environment correlation function. This\ngeneral framework is then used to study explicitly the Zeno to anti-Zeno\ncrossover behavior for the spin-boson model where a single two-level system is\ncoupled to a bosonic environment. It is shown that our framework reproduces\nresults for the usual population decay case as well as for the pure dephasing\nmodel, while at the same time allowing us to study the Zeno to anti-Zeno\ntransition when both decay and dephasing take place. These results are then\nextended to many two-level systems coupled collectively to the bosonic\nenvironment to show that the distinction between the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects\nbecomes more pronounced as the number of two-level systems increases.\n", "  That water expands when freezing is a well-known fact, and it is at the basis\nof an experiment that is often involuntary performed with beer bottles in\nfreezers. But why does the water behave this way?

The duck family (Scrooge, Donald and nephews) are\nteaming against Scrooge's worst enemy, Flintheart Glomgold, trying to buy the\nfamous Plain Awful square eggs. Inadvertently, Scrooge violates the taboo,\nshowing his Number One Dime, and is imprisoned in the stone quarries. He can be\nreleased only after the presentation of an ice cream soda to the President of\nPlain Awful. Donald and his nephews fly with Flintheart to deliver it, but\nScrooge's enemy, of course, betrays the previous agreement after getting the\nice cream, forcing the ducks into making an emergence replacement on the spot.\nUsing dried milk, sugar and chocolate from their ration packs, plus some snow\nand salt for cooling they are able make the ice cream, and after dressing it\nwith the carbonated water from a fire extinguisher they finally manage to\nproduce the desired dessert.

In American\nEnglish, it is often prefixed by the adjective \"cold\". On the contrary, in\nItalian the equivalent expression \"denaro liquido\" can be literary translated\nas \"liquid money\". In French the expression is equivalent with the additional\nfactor, with respect to the rest of this discussion, that money becomes\n\"argent\". We have therefore two very different points of view: Is money hard\nand cold, or rather liquid and \"jingling\" (\"moneta sonante\")? As usual, we\nshall investigate this topic starting from some comics about the duck family.\n", "  We predict a fast domain wall (DW) motion induced by a thermal gradient\nacross a nanoscopic ferromagnetic stripe of MnBi.

Indeed, it is\nadopted to study the distribution of the stellar component in the Milky Way, to\nstudy dark matter and dark energy on very large scales and even to discover\nexoplanets. Moreover, thanks to technological developments, it will allow the\nmeasure of the physical parameters (mass, angular momentum and electric charge)\nof supermassive black holes in the center of ours and nearby galaxies.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theory for linear gravity-driven ship waves in the\npresence of a shear current with uniform vorticity, including the effects of\nfinite water depth. The wave resistance in the presence of shear current is\ncalculated for the first time, containing in general a non-zero lateral\ncomponent. While formally apparently a straightforward extension of existing\ndeep water theory, the introduction of finite water depth is physically\nnon-trivial, since the surface waves are now affected by a subtle interplay of\nthe effects of the current and the sea bed. This becomes particularly\npronounced when considering the phenomenon of critical velocity, the velocity\nat which transversely propagating waves become unable to keep up with the\nmoving source. The phenomenon is well known for shallow water, and was recently\nshown to exist also in deep water in the presence of a shear current\n[Ellingsen, J.~Fluid Mech.\\ {\\bf 742} R2 (2014)]. We derive the exact criterion\nfor criticality as a function of an intrinsic shear Froude number $S\\sqrt{b/g}$\n($S$ is uniform vorticity, $b$ size of source), the water depth, and the angle\nbetween the shear current and the ship's motion. Formulae for both the normal\nand lateral wave resistance force are derived, and we analyse its dependence on\nthe source velocity (or Froude number $Fr$) for different amounts of shear and\ndifferent directions of motion. The effect of the shear current is to increase\nwave resistance for upstream ship motion and decrease it for downstream motion.\nAlso the value of $Fr$ at which $R$ is maximal is lowered for upstream and\nincreased for downstream directions of ship motion. For oblique angles between\nship motion and current there is a lateral wave resistance component which can\namount to $10$-$20\\%$ of the normal wave resistance for side-on shear and\n$S\\sqrt{b/g}$ of order unity.

Starting with a general Lagrangian that\nconsists of a metric, a scalar field, a vector gauge field, together with a\ntwo-form potential, we derive off-shell Noether potentials of the Lagrangian\nand generalize the Abbott-Deser-Tekin (ADT) formalism to the off-shell level by\nestablishing one-to-one correspondence between the ADT potential and the\noff-shell Noether potential. It is proved that the off-shell generalized ADT\nformalism is conformally invariant. Then we apply the formulation to compute\nmass and angular momentum of the four-dimensional Kerr-Sen black hole and the\nfive-dimensional rotating charged black string in the string frame without a\nnecessity to transform the metrics into the Einstein frame.\n", "  Finite temperature QCD sum rules are applied to the behaviour of charmonium\nand bottonium states, leading to their survival at and beyond the critical\ntemperature for deconfinement. Di-muon production in heavy-ion collisions in\nthe $\\rho$-region is also discussed.\n", "  This study presents the first direct and quantitative measurements of the\nnuclear momentum distribution anisotropy and the quantum kinetic energy tensor\nin stable and metastable (supercooled) water near its triple point using Deep\nInelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS). From the experimental spectra accurate\nlineshapes of the hydrogen momentum distributions are derived using an\nanisotropic Gaussian and a model independent framework. The experimental\nresults, benchmarked with those obtained for the solid phase, provide the state\nof the art directional values of the hydrogen mean kinetic energy in metastable\nwater. The determinations of the direction kinetic energies in the supercooled\nphase, benchmarked with ice at the same temperature, provide accurate and\nquantitative measurements of these dynamical observables in metastable and\nstable phases, {i.e.} key insight in the physical mechanisms of the hydrogen\nquantum state in both disordered and polycrystalline systems. The remarkable\nfindings of this study establish novel insight to further expand the capacity\nand accuracy of DINS investigations of the nuclear quantum effects in water and\nrepresent reference experimental values for theoretical investigations.\n", "  In this paper, we formulated the non-steady flow due to the uniformly\naccelerated and rotating circular cylinder from rest in a stationary, viscous,\nincompressible and micropolar fluid. This flow problem is examined numerically\nby adopting a special scheme comprising the Adams-Bashforth Temporal Fourier\nSeries method and the Runge-Kutta Temporal Special Finite-Difference method.\nThis numerical scheme transforms the governing equation for micropolar fluids\nfor this problem into system of finite-difference equations. This system was\nfurther solved numerically by point SOR-method. These results were also further\nextrapolated by the Richardson extrapolation method. This scheme is valid for\nall values of the flow and fluid-parameters and for all time. Moreover the\nboundary conditions of the vorticity and the spin at points far from the\ncylinder are being imposed and encountered too. The results are compared with\nexisting results (for non-rotating circular cylinder in Newtonian fluids). The\ncomparison is good. The enhancement of lift and reduction in drag was observed\nif the micropolarity effects are intensified. Same is happened if the rotation\nof a cylinder increases. Furthermore, the vortex-pair in the wake is delayed to\nsuccessively higher times as rotation parameter increases. In addition, the\nrotation helps not only in dissolving vortices adjacent to the cylinder and\nadverse pressure region but also in dissolving the boundary layer separation.\nFurthermore, the rotation reduces the micropolar spin boundary layer also.\n", "  It is shown that the oscillation method to study liquid viscosity of\n[1-3,7-34], which is the basis of oscillation method to study crystallization\nand melting in multicomponent system, is based on incorrect consideration of\none dimensional forced (constrained) )vibrations of plate in viscous liquid,\nbecause additional (apparent) mass of liquid and surface forces are incorrectly\ntaken into account, and Archimedes force did not taken into account. It is\nshown that the vibrations cannot be one dimensional, and torsional vibrations\nneed to be taken into account. It is shown also that the characteristics of\nvibrating system depend on time, the system has no isothermal conditions, the\nsystem cannot reach metastable conditions therefore one cannot observe\nhomogeneous crystallization and melting, the results obtained with the use of\nthe method are not reliable and incorrect.\n", "  It is shown that the oscillation method to study liquid viscosity of\n[1-3,7-34] is based on incorrect consideration of one dimensional forced\n(constrained) )vibrations of plate in viscous liquid, because additional\n(apparent) mass of liquid and surface forces are incorrectly taken into\naccount, and Archimedes force did not taken into account. It is shown the\nvibrations cannot be one dimensional, and torsional vibrations need to be take\ninto account, the results obtained with the use of the method are not reliable\nand incorrect.\n", "  The $\\mathrm{\\tilde{C}}$ $^1$B$_2$ state of SO$_2$ has a double-minimum\npotential in the antisymmetric stretch coordinate, such that the minimum energy\ngeometry has nonequivalent SO bond lengths. The asymmetry in the potential\nenergy surface is expressed as a staggering in the energy levels of the\n$\\nu_3'$ progression. We have recently made the first observation of low-lying\nlevels with odd quanta of $v_3'$, which allows us--in the current work--to\ncharacterize the origins of the level staggering. Our work demonstrates the\nusefulness of low-lying vibrational level structure, where the character of the\nwavefunctions can be relatively easily understood, to extract information about\ndynamically important potential energy surface crossings that occur at much\nhigher energy. The measured staggering pattern is consistent with a vibronic\ncoupling model for the double-minimum, which involves direct coupling to the\nbound 2$^1$A$_1$ state and indirect coupling with the repulsive 3$^1$A$_1$\nstate. The degree of staggering in the $\\nu_3'$ levels increases with quanta of\nbending excitation, which is consistent with the approach along the\n$\\mathrm{\\tilde{C}}$ state potential energy surface to a conical intersection\nwith the 2$^1$A$_1$ surface at a bond angle of $\\sim$145$^{\\circ}$.\n", "  Cellular automata can show well known features of quantum mechanics, such as\na linear rule according to which they evolve and which resembles a discretized\nversion of the Schroedinger equation. This includes corresponding conservation\nlaws. The class of \"natural\" Hamiltonian cellular automata is based exclusively\non integer-valued variables and couplings and their dynamics derives from an\nAction Principle. They can be mapped reversibly to continuum models by applying\nSampling Theory. Thus, \"deformed\" quantum mechanical models with a finite\ndiscreteness scale $l$ are obtained, which for $l\\rightarrow 0$ reproduce\nfamiliar continuum results. We have recently demonstrated that such automata\ncan form \"multipartite\" systems consistently with the tensor product structures\nof nonrelativistic many-body quantum mechanics, while interacting and\nmaintaining the linear evolution. Consequently, the Superposition Principle\nfully applies for such primitive discrete deterministic automata and their\ncomposites and can produce the essential quantum effects of interference and\nentanglement.\n", "  The stationary and highly non-stationary resonant dynamics of the\nharmonically forced pendulum are described in the framework of a semi-inverse\nprocedure combined with the Limiting Phase Trajectory concept. This procedure,\nimplying only existence of slow time scale, permits to avoid any restriction on\nthe oscillation amplitudes. The main results relating to the dynamical\nbifurcation thresholds are represented in a closed form. The small parameter\ndefining the separation of the time scales is naturally identified in the\nanalytical procedure. Considering the pendulum frequency as the control\nparameter we reveal two qualitative transitions. One of them corresponding to\nstationary instability with formation of two additional stationary states, the\nother, associated with the most intense energy drawing from the source, at\nwhich the amplitude of pendulum oscillations abruptly grows.\n  Analytical predictions of both bifurcations are verified by numerical\nintegration of original equation.\n  It is also shown that occurrence of chaotic domains may be strongly connected\nwith the second transition.\n", "  The need for the extra dimension in Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) regularization\nis explained by the topology of the Hopf fibration, which defines the geometry\nand structure of KS space. A trajectory in Cartesian space is represented by a\nfour-dimensional manifold, called the fundamental manifold. Based on geometric\nand topological aspects classical concepts of stability are translated to KS\nlanguage. The separation between manifolds of solutions generalizes the concept\nof Lyapunov stability. The dimension-raising nature of the fibration transforms\nfixed points, limit cycles, attractive sets, and Poincar\\'e sections to\nhigher-dimensional subspaces. From these concepts chaotic systems are studied.\nIn strongly perturbed problems the numerical error can break the topological\nstructure of KS space: points in a fiber are no longer transformed to the same\npoint in Cartesian space. An observer in three dimensions will see orbits\ndeparting from the same initial conditions but diverging in time. This apparent\nrandomness of the integration can only be understood in four dimensions. The\nconcept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the\ntime scale in which numerical simulations can be trusted. Ideally all\ntrajectories departing from the same fiber should be KS transformed to a unique\ntrajectory in three-dimensional space, because the fundamental manifold that\nthey constitute is unique. By monitoring how trajectories departing from one\nfiber separate from the fundamental manifold a critical time, equivalent to the\nLyapunov time, is estimated. These concepts are tested on N-body examples: the\nPythagorean problem, and an example of field stars interacting with a binary.\n", "  The ad-hoc imposition of normal ordering on the Lagrangian, energy-momentum\ntensor and currents is a standard tool in quantum field theory (QFT) to\neliminate infinite vacuum expectation values (v.e.v.) However, for fermionic\nexpressions these infinite terms are due to anti-particles only. This exposes\nan asymmetry in standard QFT, which can be traced back to a bias towards\nparticles in the Dirac bra-ket notation. To counter this bias a new ordering\nprinciple (called the $\\mathbb{R}$-product) is required which restores the\nsymmetry (or rather duality) between particles and anti-particles and\neliminates the infinite v.e.v. While this $\\mathbb{R}$-product was already used\nin a bound-state application, this paper aims to give it a more general\nfoundation and analyze its overall impact in QFT.\n  For boson fields the particle bias is hidden and the fields must first be\nexpanded into bilinear particle-anti-particle fermion operators. This new\nrepresentation also leads to vanishing v.e.v.'s and avoids some common\ntechnical problems in the quantization of vector fields, while it admits new\nconstant contributions that mimic the Higgs mechanism without unacceptable\ncontributions to the cosmological constant.\n  Since the $\\mathbb{R}$-product does not apply between operators belonging to\ndifferent space- time coordinates (e.g. propagators and vacuum condensates),\nmost standard QFT calculations remain unaffected by this new principle,\npreserving those quantitative successes. The boson propagator also retains a\nstandard bosonic form despite the fermionic representation. However, the\nfoundations of QFT are affected strongly as the new principle suggests that the\nStandard Model is an effective theory built (partly?) on massless bare quarks.\n", "  On L 2 (R), we consider the Schr\\\"odinger operator (1.1) H \\k{o} = --\n$\\partial$ 2 $\\partial$x 2 + v(x) -- \\k{o}x, where v is a real analytic\n1-periodic function and \\k{o} is a positive constant. This operator is a model\nto study a Bloch electron in a constant electric field ([1]). The parameter\n\\k{o} is proportional to the electric field. The operator (1.1) was studied\nboth by physicists (see, e.g., the review [6]) and by mathematicians (see,\ne.g., [9]). Its spectrum is absolutely continuous and fills the real axis. One\nof main features of H \\k{o} is the existence of Stark-Wannier ladders. These\nare \\k{o}-periodic sequences of resonances, which are poles of the analytic\ncontinuation of the resolvent kernel in the lower half plane through the\nspectrum (see, e.g., [2]). Most of the mathematical work studied the case of\nsmall \\k{o} (see, e.g., [9, 3] and references therein). When \\k{o} is small,\nthere are ladders exponentially close to the real axis. Actually, only the case\nof finite gap potentials v was relatively well understood. For these\npotentials, there is only a finite number of ladders exponentially close to the\nreal axis. It was further noticed that the ladders non-trivially \"interact\" as\n\\k{o} changes, and conjectured that the behavior of the resonances strongly\ndepends on number theoretical properties of \\k{o} (see, e.g., [1]). In the\npresent note, we only consider the periodic potential v(x) = 2 cos(2$\\pi$x) and\nstudy the reflection coefficient r(E) of the Stark-Wannier operator (1.1) in\nthe lower half of the complex plane of the spectral parameter E. The resonances\nare the poles of the reflection coefficient. We show that, as Im E\n$\\rightarrow$ --$\\infty$, the function E $\\rightarrow$ 1 r(E) can be\nasymptotically described in terms of a regularized cubic exponential sum that\nis a close relative of the cubic exponential sums often encountered in analytic\nnumber theory. This explains the dependence of the reflection coefficient on\nthe arithmetic.\n", "  We analyze the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theory with the\nnonperturbative renormalization group equation (NPRGE), which is a first order\nnonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). In case that the spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking occurs, the NPRGE encounters some non-analytic\nsingularities at the finite critical scale even though the initial function is\ncontinuous and smooth. Therefore there is no usual solution of the PDE beyond\nthe critical scale. In this paper, we newly introduce the notion of a weak\nsolution which is the global solution of the weak NPRGE. We show how to\nevaluate the physical quantities with the weak solution.\n", "  We study the interplay of quadrupole and octupole degrees of freedom in the\nstructure of the isotope $^{144}$Ba. A symmetry conserving configuration mixing\nmethod (SCCM) based on a Gogny energy density functional (EDF) has been used.\nThe method includes particle number, parity and angular momentum restoration as\nwell as axial quadrupole and octupole shape mixing within the generator\ncoordinate method. Predictions both for excitation energies and electromagnetic\ntransition probabilities are in good agreement with the most recent\nexperimental data.\n", "  In ultrabroadband terahertz electro-optic sampling, spectral filtering of the\ngate pulse can strongly reduce the quantum noise while the signal level is only\nweakly affected. The concept is tested for phase-matched electro-optic\ndetection of field transients centered at 45 THz with 12-fs near-infrared gate\npulses in AgGaS2. Our new approach increases the experimental signal-to-noise\nratio by a factor of 3 compared to standard electro-optic sampling. Under\ncertain conditions an improvement factor larger than 5 is predicted by our\ntheoretical analysis.\n", "  Previously we considered the effect of experimental parameters on optimized\ntransmission through opaque media using spatial light modulator (SLM)-based\nwavefront shaping. In this study we consider the opposite geometry, in which we\noptimize reflection from an opaque surface such that the backscattered light is\nfocused onto a spot on an imaging detector. By systematically varying different\nexperimental parameters (genetic algorithm iterations, bin size, SLM active\narea, target area, spot size, and sample angle with respect to the optical\naxis) and optimizing the reflected light we determine how each parameter\naffects the intensity enhancement. We find that the effects of the experimental\nparameters on the enhancement are similar to those measured for a transmissive\ngeometry, but with the exact functional forms changed due to the different\ngeometry and the use of a genetic algorithm instead of an iterative algorithm.\nAdditionally, we find preliminary evidence of greater enhancements than\npredicted by random matrix theory, suggesting a possibly new physical mechanism\nto be investigated in future work.\n", "  This paper discusses the free vibration of elastic spherical structures in\nthe presence of an externally unbounded acoustic medium. In this vibration,\ndamping associated with the radiation of energy from the confined solid medium\nto the surrounding acoustic medium is observed. Evaluating the coupled system\nresponse (solid displacement and acoustic pressure) and characterizing the\nacoustic radiation damping in conjunction with the media properties are the\nmain objectives of this research. In this work, acoustic damping is\ndemonstrated for two problems: the thin spherical shell and the solid sphere.\nThe mathematical approach followed in solving these coupled problems is based\non the Laplace transform method. The linear under-damped harmonic oscillator is\nthe reference model for damping estimation. The damping evaluation is performed\nin frequency as well as in time domains; both investigations lead to identical\ndamping factor expressions.\n", "  The URAT Parallax Catalog (UPC) consists of 112,177 parallaxes. The catalog\nutilizes all Northern Hemisphere exposures from the United States Naval\nObservatory (USNO) Robotic Astrometric Telescope (URAT) obtained between April\n2012 and June 2015. Relative parallaxes are converted to absolute using\nphotometric distance estimates of UCAC4 reference stars. There are 2 groups of\nstars in this catalog: 1) 58,677 stars with prior published trigonometric\nparallax (Hipparcos, Yale Parallax Catalog, MEarth project and SIMBAD), and 2)\n53,500 stars with first time trigonometric parallaxes as obtained from URAT\ndata. More stringent selection criteria have been applied for group 2 then for\ngroup 1 in order to keep the rate of false detections low. The mean error in\nUPC parallaxes is 10.8 and 4.3 mas for groups 1 and 2, respectively. All stars\nin UPC are north of -13 deg Dec and between 6.5 and 17 mag. The UPC is\npublished by CDS as catalog I/333 and the acronym has been registered with the\nIAU. The Finch & Zacharias (2016, in press with AJ) paper describes the data,\nreductions, and results of an about 1000 star subset (stars within 40 pc of the\nSun) of the entire UPC. The UPC also provides accurate positions and proper\nmotions on the ICRS. This is the largest parallax catalog published since the\nHipparcos Catalog.\n", "  The kinematics of pre-Maxwell electrodynamics is examined and interpretations\nof these fields is found through an examination of the associated Lorentz force\nand the structure of the energy-momentum tensor.\n", "  A new quartic force field for the SO$_2$ $\\tilde{\\text{C}}$$^1$B$_2$ state\nhas been derived, based on high resolution data from S$^{16}$O$_2$ and\nS$^{18}$O$_2$. Included are eight $b_2$ symmetry vibrational levels of\nS$^{16}$O$_2$ reported in the first paper of this series [G. B. Park,\n$\\textit{et al.}$, J. Chem. Phys. $\\textbf{144}$, 144311 (2016)]. Many of the\nexperimental observables not included in the fit, such as the Franck-Condon\nintensities and the Coriolis-perturbed effective $C$ rotational constants of\nhighly anharmonic $\\tilde{\\text{C}}$ state vibrational levels, are well\nreproduced using our force field. Because the two stretching modes of the\n$\\tilde{\\text{C}}$ state are strongly coupled via Fermi-133 interaction, the\nvibrational structure of the $\\tilde{\\text{C}}$ state is analyzed in a\nFermi-system basis set, constructed explicitly in this work via\n$\\textit{partial}$ $\\textit{diagonalization}$ of the vibrational Hamiltonian.\nThe physical significance of the Fermi-system basis is discussed in terms of\nsemiclassical dynamics, based on study of Fermi-resonance systems by Kellman\nand coworkers [M. E. Kellman and L. Xiao, J. Chem. Phys. $\\textbf{93}$, 5821\n(1990)]. By diagonalizing the vibrational Hamiltonian in the Fermi-system\nbasis, the vibrational characters of all vibrational levels can be determined\nunambiguously. It is shown that the bending mode cannot be treated separately\nfrom the coupled stretching modes, particularly at vibrational energies of more\nthan 2000 cm$^{-1}$. Based on our force field, the structure of the Coriolis\ninteractions in the $\\tilde{\\text{C}}$ state of SO$_2$ is also discussed. We\nidentify the origin of the alternating patterns in the effective $C$ rotational\nconstants of levels in the vibrational progressions of the symmetry-breaking\nmode, $\\nu_\\beta$ (which correlates with the antisymmetric stretching mode in\nour assignment scheme).\n", "  In the frequency domain, the nearly constant loss, is characterized by a\nslope 1 in log of the real part of the electrical conductivity vs log frequency\nplots. It can be explained by an anomalous diffusion, defined by a random walk\nwith the mean square displacement proportional to the logarithm of time, rather\nthan being linearly proportional to time, as in normal diffusion. The present\nwork suggests a random walk algorithm that leads to anomalous, logarithmic time\ndependence. That has been accomplished by scaling down the subsequent random\nwalk displacements by a factor, 1/t^(1/2)\n", "  Neutrino physics is currently suffering from lack of knowledge from at least\nfour major ingredients. One of them is the presence or not of new sterile\nneutrino states at the mass scale of around 1 eV. Settling this point should be\nthe highest priority for the neutrino community. We will discuss the\nstate-of-the art of experimental searches for sterile neutrinos with\naccelerators, both at long and short baselines.\n", "  The Bargmann-Wigner (BW) framework describes particles of spin-j in terms of\nDirac spinors of rank 2j, obtained as the local direct product of n Dirac\nspinor copies, with n=2j. Such spinors are reducible, and contain also\n(j,0)+(0,j)-pure spin representation spaces. The 2(2j+1) degrees of freedom of\nthe latter are identified by a projector given by the n-fold direct product of\nthe covariant parity projector within the Dirac spinor space. Considering\ntotally symmetric tensor spinors one is left with the expected number of\n2(2j+1) independent degrees of freedom. The BW projector is of the order\n$\\partial ^{2j}$ in the derivatives, and so are the related spin-j wave\nequations and associated Lagrangians. High order differential equations can not\nbe consistently gauged, and allow several unphysical aspects, such as\nnon-locality, acausality, ghosts and etc to enter the theory. In order to avoid\nthese difficulties we here suggest a strategy of replacing the high order of\nthe BW wave equations by the universal second order. To do so we replaced the\nBW projector by one of zeroth order in the derivatives. We built it up from one\nof the Casimir invariants of the Lorentz group when exclusively acting on\nspaces of internal spin degrees of freedom. This projector allows one to\nidentify anyone of the irreducible sectors of the primordial rank-2j spinor, in\nparticular (j,0)+(0,j), and without any reference to the external space-time\nand the four-momentum. The dynamics is then introduced by requiring the (j,0)+\n(0,j) sector to satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation. The scheme allows for a\nconsistent minimal gauging.\n", "  Infinity, in various guises, has been invoked recently in order to `explain'\na number of important questions regarding observable phenomena in science, and\nin particular in cosmology. Such explanations are by their nature speculative.\nHere we introduce the notions of relative infinity, closure, and economy of\nexplanation and ask: to what extent explanations involving relative or real\nconstructed infinities can be treated as reasonable?\n", "  We propose that the SI be modified so that the radian is a base unit. Some of\nthe details and consequences of such a modification are examined.\n", "  Recent experiments have perfectly verified the fact that quantum correlations\nbetween two entangled particles are stronger than any classical, local\npre-quantum worldview allows. This is famously called the EPR paradox first\nconceived as a thought experiment and decades later realized in the lab. We\ndiscuss in depth the nature of the paradox and show that the problematics it\npresents is first and foremost epistemological. After briefly exploring\nresolutions to the paradox that after many decades of discourse still remain\ncontroversial, we argue that the paradox is rooted in the failure of our\ncurrent metaphysical scheme, being the foundation of our knowledge, to\naccommodate and cohere our knowledge of the phenomena of entanglement. We then\ndevelop and make the case for a novel and more fundamental resolution of the\nparadox by changing the underlying metaphysical foundation from one based on\nindividuals to a one based on individuation. We discuss in detail how in the\nlight of this new scheme concepts central to the paradox such as realism,\ncausality and locality are adjusted to the effect that the paradox is resolved\nwithout giving up these concepts so fundamental to our thinking. We conclude\nwith a brief note about the important role of metaphysics to the progress of\nknowledge and our understanding of reality.\n", "  This study presents and validates a novel (non-ECG-triggered) MRI sequence\nbased on SPAtial Modulation of the Magnetization (SPAMM) to non-invasively\nmeasure 3D (quasi-static) soft tissue deformations using only six acquisitions\n(three static and three indentations). In current SPAMM tagged MRI approaches\ndata is typically constructed from many repeated motion cycles. This has so far\nrestricted its application to the measurement of highly repeatable and periodic\nmovements (e.g. cardiac deformation). In biomechanical applications where soft\ntissue deformation is artificially induced, often by indentation, significant\nrepeatability constraints exist and, for clinical applications, discomfort and\nhealth issues generally preclude a large number of repetitions.\n", "  The mechanical properties of human soft tissue are crucial for impact\nbiomechanics, rehabilitation engineering and surgical simulation. Validation of\nthese constitutive models using human data remains challenging and often\nrequires the use of non-invasive imaging and inverse finite element (FE)\nanalysis. Post processing data from imaging methods such as tagged magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) can be challenging. Digital Image Correlation (DIC)\nhowever is a relatively straightforward imaging method and thus the goal of\nthis study was to assess the use of DIC in combination with FE modelling to\ndetermine the bulk material properties of human soft tissue. Indentation\nexperiments were performed on a silicone gel soft tissue phantom. A two camera\nDIC setup was then used to record the 3D surface deformation. The experiment\nwas then simulated using a FE model.\n", "  We report evidence for multiband transport and an insulating low-temperature\nnormal state in superconducting K$_{0.50}$Na$_{0.24}$Fe$_{1.52}$Se$_{2}$ with\n$T_{c}\\approx 20$ K. The temperature-dependent upper critical field, $H_{c2}$,\nis well described by a two-band BCS model. The normal-state resistance,\naccessible at low temperatures only in pulsed magnetic fields, shows an\ninsulating logarithmic temperature dependence as $T \\rightarrow 0$ after\nsuperconductivity is suppressed. This is similar as for high-$T_{c}$ copper\noxides and granular type-I superconductors, suggesting that the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition observed in high magnetic fields is related\nto intrinsic nanoscale phase separation.\n", "  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is common across Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the\ninvestigation of SCD in this area has been significantly limited mainly due to\nthe lack of research facilities and skilled personnel. Here, we present optical\nmeasurements of individual red blood cells (RBCs) from healthy individuals and\nindividuals with SCD and sickle cell trait in Tanzania using the quantitative\nphase imaging technique. By employing a quantitative phase imaging unit (QPIU),\nan existing microscope in a clinic is transformed into a powerful quantitative\nphase microscope providing measurements on the morphological, biochemical, and\nbiomechanical properties of individual cells. The present approach will open up\nnew opportunities for cost-effective investigation and diagnosis of several\ndiseases in low resource environments.\n", "  The F theorem states that, for a unitary three dimensional quantum field\ntheory, the F quantity defined in terms of the partition function on a three\nsphere is positive, stationary at fixed point and decreases monotonically along\na renormalization group flow. We construct holographic renormalization group\nflows corresponding to relevant deformations of three-dimensional conformal\nfield theories on spheres, working to quadratic order in the source. For these\nrenormalization group flows, the F quantity at the IR fixed point is always\nless than F at the UV fixed point, but F increases along the RG flow for\ndeformations by operators of dimension $3/2 < \\Delta < 5/2$. Therefore the\nstrongest version of the F theorem is in general violated.\n", "  By further developing the generalized $\\Gamma$-calculus for hypoelliptic\noperators, we prove hypocoercive estimates for a large class of Kolmogorov type\noperators which are defined on non necessarily totally geodesic Riemannian\nfoliations. We study then in detail the example of the velocity spherical\nBrownian motion, whose generator is a step-3 generating hypoelliptic\nH\\\"ormander's type operator. To prove hypocoercivity in that case, the key\npoint is to show the existence of a convenient Riemannian foliation associated\nto the diffusion. We will then deduce, under suitable geometric conditions, the\nconvergence to equilibrium of the diffusion in $H^1$ and in $L^2$.\n", "  The $\\mathrm{\\tilde{C}}$ $^1$B$_2$ state of SO$_2$ has a double-minimum\npotential in the antisymmetric stretch coordinate, such that the minimum energy\ngeometry has nonequivalent SO bond lengths. However, low-lying levels with odd\nquanta of antisymmetric stretch (b$_2$ vibrational symmetry) have not\npreviously been observed because transitions into these levels from the\nzero-point level of the $\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}$ state are vibronically forbidden.\nWe use IR-UV double resonance to observe the b$_2$ vibrational levels of the\n$\\mathrm{\\tilde{C}}$ state below 1600 cm$^{-1}$ of vibrational excitation. This\nenables a direct characterization of the vibrational level staggering that\nresults from the double-minimum potential. In addition, it allows us to\ndeperturb the strong $c$-axis Coriolis interactions between levels of a$_1$ and\nb$_2$ vibrational symmetry, and to determine accurately the vibrational\ndependence of the rotational constants in the distorted $\\mathrm{\\tilde{C}}$\nelectronic state.\n", "  We consider cosmological properties of modified gravity with nonlocal term $\nR^p\\mathcal{F}(\\Box)R^q$ in its Lagrangian. Equations of motion are presented.\nFor the flat FLRW metric, and some particular values of natural numbers $p$ and\n$q$ cosmological solutions of the form $a(t)= C e^{- \\frac \\gamma{12}t^2}$ are\nfound.\n", "  Created surfaces or meta surfaces, composed of appropriately shaped\nsub-wavelength structures, namely, meta-atoms, control light at wavelength\nscales. Historically, meta surfaces have used radiating metallic resonators as\nwavelength inclusions. However, while resonant optical meta surfaces made from\nmetal have been sub-wavelength in the propagation direction, they are too loss\nfor many applications.\n", "  The physics of matter in the condensed state is concerned with problems in\nwhich the number of constituent particles is vastly greater than can be easily\ncomprehended. The inherent physical limitations of the human mind are\nfundamental and restrict the way in which we can interact with and learn about\nthe universe. This presents challenges for developing scientific explanations\nthat are met by emergent narratives, concepts and arguments that have a\nnon-trivial relationship to the underlying microphysics. By examining examples\nwithin condensed matter physics, and also from cellular automata, I show how\nsuch emergent narratives efficiently describe elements of reality.\n", "  To reduce Schottky-barrier-induced contact and access resistance, and the\nimpact of charged impurity and phonon scattering on mobility in devices based\non 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), considerable effort has been put\ninto exploring various doping techniques and dielectric engineering using\n$high-\\kappa$ oxides, respectively. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a\n$high-\\kappa$ dielectric that serves as an effective n-type charge transfer\ndopant on monolayer (ML) molybdenum disulfide ($MoS_{2}$). Utilizing amorphous\ntitanium suboxide (ATO) as the '$high-\\kappa$ dopant', we achieved a contact\nresistance of ~ $180$ ${\\Omega}.{\\mu}m$ which is the lowest reported value for\nML $MoS_{2}$. An ON current as high as $240$ ${\\mu}A/{\\mu}m$ and field effect\nmobility as high as $83$ $cm^2/V-s$ were realized using this doping technique.\nMoreover, intrinsic mobility as high as $102$ $cm^2/V-s$ at $300$ $K$ and $501$\n$cm^2/V-s$ at $77$ $K$ were achieved after ATO encapsulation which are among\nthe highest mobility values reported on ML $MoS_{2}$. We also analyzed the\ndoping effect of ATO films on ML $MoS_{2}$, a phenomenon which is absent when\nstoichiometric $TiO_{2}$ is used, using ab initio density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations which shows excellent agreement with our experimental\nfindings. Based on the interfacial-oxygen-vacancy mediated doping as seen in\nthe case of $high-\\kappa$ ATO - ML $MoS_{2}$, we propose a mechanism for the\nmobility enhancement effect observed in TMD-based devices after encapsulation\nin a $high-\\kappa$ dielectric environment.\n", "  At 300-3000K and 1-500MPa, variations of relative contents for small water\nclusters (H2O)n (n=1~6) were calculated by using statistical mechanical\nmethods. First, 9 kinds of small water clusters were selected and their\nstructures were optimized by using ab initio method. In the wide range of\ntemperature (300-3000K) and pressure (1-500MPa), their equilibrium constants of\nreactions for formation of 9 kinds of water clusters were determined by using\nmolecular partition function. Next, changes of contents (molar fractions) as\nfunction of temperature and pressure were estimated. The obtained results for\nsmall water clusters can be used to interpret temperature-pressure dependency\nof the average number for the hydrogen bonds in water clusters and\nredistribution of the water clusters at the ultrasonic cavitation reactions.\n", "  The near infrared scattering images of human muscle include some information\non bloodstream and hemoglobin concentration according to skin depth and time.\nThis paper addressed a method of determining oxygen saturation and\nphotoplethysmogram from the near infrared (NIR) scattering images of muscle.\nDepending on the modified Beer-Lambert Law and the diffuse scattering model of\nmuscular tissue, we determined an extinction coefficient matrix of hemoglobin\nfrom the near infrared scattering images and analyzed distribution of oxygen\nsaturation of muscle with a depth from the extinction coefficient matrix. And\nwe determined a dynamic attenuation variation curve with respect to fragmentary\nimage frames sensitive to bloodstream from scattering image frames of muscle\nwith time and then obtained the photoplethysmogram and heart rate by Fourier\ntransformation and inverse transformation. This method based on the NIR\nscattering images can be applied in measurement of an average oxygen saturation\nand photoplethysmogram even in local region of optically heterogeneous muscle\nand skin.\n", "  To increase system capacity of underwater optical communications, we employ\nthe spatial domain to simultaneously transmit multiple orthogonal spatial\nbeams, each carrying an independent data channel. In this paper, we multiplex\nand transmit four green orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams through a single\naperture. Moreover, we investigate the degrading effects of\nscattering/turbidity, water current, and thermal gradient-induced turbulence,\nand we find that thermal gradients cause the most distortions and turbidity\ncauses the most loss. We show systems results using two different data\ngeneration techniques, one at 1064 nm for 10-Gbit/s/beam and one at 520 nm for\n1-Gbit/s/beam, we use both techniques since present data-modulation\ntechnologies are faster for infrared (IR) than for green. For the higher-rate\nlink, data is modulated in the IR, and OAM imprinting is performed in the green\nusing a specially-designed metasurface phase mask. For the lower rates, a green\nlaser diode is directly modulated. Finally, we show that inter-channel\ncrosstalk induced by thermal gradients can be mitigated using multi-channel\nequalisation processing.\n", "  The quantumness of a generic state is the resource of many applications in\nquantum information theory and it is interesting to survey the measures which\nare able to detect its trace in the properties of the state. In this work we\nstudy the quantum discord and fully entangled fraction of two classes of\nbipartite states and compare their behaviors. These classes are complements to\nthe $d\\otimes d$ Werner and isotropic states, in the sense that each class\npossesses the same purification as the corresponding complemental class of\nstates. Our results show that maximally entangled mixed states are also\nmaximally discordant states, leading to a generalization of the well-known fact\nthat all maximally entangled pure states have also maximum quantum discord.\nMoreover, it is shown that the separability-entanglement boundary of a Werner\nor isotropic state is manifested as an inflection point in the diagram of\nquantum discord of the corresponding complemental state.\n", "  As the RR Lyrae stars evolve on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram they are\nbelieved to become short period Type II Cepheids, known as BL Her type (with a\npulsation period from $1$ to $3-8$ days). Assuming that their mass is around\n$0.5 - 0.6 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, and that they are low metallicity objects, they\nwere thought to belong to the halo of the Milky Way. We investigated seven\nGalactic short period Type II Cepheids (BL Her, SW Tau, V553 Cen, DQ And, BD\nCas, V383 Cyg, and KT Com) in order to establish their membership within the\nGalactic structure using the kinematic approach. $Gaia$ should provide us with\nmore data needed to conduct the study of the whole sample.\n", "  In the past few years, the meteoric development of hybrid organic--inorganic\nperovskite solar cells (PSC) astonished the community. The efficiency has\nalready reached the level needed for commercialization; however, the\ninstability hinders its deployment on the market. Here, we report a mechanism\nto chemically stabilize PSC absorbers. We propose to replace the widely used\nmethylammonium cation (\\ce{CH3NH3+}) by alternative molecular cations allowing\nan enhanced electronic coupling between the cation and the \\ce{PbI6} octahedra\nwhile maintaining the band gap energy within the suitable range for solar\ncells. The mechanism exploits establishing a balance between the\nelectronegativity of the materials' constituents and the resulting ionic\nelectrostatic interactions. The calculations demonstrate the concept of\nenhancing the electronic coupling, and hence the stability, by exploring the\nstabilizing features of \\ce{CH3PH3+}, \\ce{CH3SH2+}, and \\ce{SH3+} cations,\namong several other possible candidates. Chemical stability enhancement hence\nresults from a strong, yet balanced, electronic coupling between the cation and\nthe halides in the octahedron. This shall unlock the hindering instability\nproblem for PSCs and allow them to hit the market as a serious low-cost\ncompetitor to silicon based solar cell technologies.\n", "  We demonstrate that the quasistatic recording of the magnetic excitation\nfunction M(H) of superparamagnetic iron oxide magnetic nanoparticle (SPION)\nsuspensions by an atomic magnetometer allows a precise determination of the\nsample's iron mass content mFe and the particle size distribution.\n", "  Based on the Kubo formula approach, the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Rashba s-wave superconductor in the presence of\nnonmagnetic impurities is calculated. We will show that by increasing the\nsuperconducting gap, the SHC decreases monotonically to zero, while by\ndecreasing the concentration of impurities at zero gap, the SHC closes to the\nclean limit universal value . As a function of the impurity relaxation rate at\nand (is the spin-orbit coupling in unit of), we will show that in the dirty\nlimit () the SHC vanishes, and by increasing the relaxation time () the SHC\ndepends on the value of superconducting gap (), is changed from zero for full\ngap to in zero gap. At low temperatures, the SHC goes to zero exponentially and\nnear the critical temperature depending on the concentration of the scattering\ncenters, the SHC will tend to the value of normal state. We will also show that\nthe SHC is independent of spin-orbit coupling () in the clean limit.\n", "  This year's Physics Nobel prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillations\nwhich resolved the problem of the missing solar neutrinos and the atmospheric\nmuon neutrinos implies that at least one of the three neutrino species has a\ntiny mass. The neutrino oscillations measure the mass difference squared, and\nthe individual neutrino masses have yet to be accurately ascertained. Particle\ntheory has so far not given a predictive picture for neutrino masses. Here we\npropose that the anthropic principle may be relevant, as it is frequently\ninvoked to understand other aspects of the universe, including the precise\nvalues of fine structure constant or nuclear coupling constant or even the\nproton-electron mass ratio.\n", "  In this article, three dimensional (3D) lid-driven cubic cavity flows have\nbeen studied numerically for various values of Reynolds number ($Re$). The\nnumerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations modeling incompressible\nviscous fluid flow in a cubic cavity is obtained via a methodology combining a\nfirst order accurate operator-splitting, $L^2$-projection Stokes solver, a\nwave-like equation treatment of the advection and finite element methods. The\nnumerical results obtained for Re$=$400, 1000, and 3200 show a good agreement\nwith available numerical and experimental results in literature. Simulation\nresults predict that the critical Re$_{cr}$ for the transition from steady flow\nto oscillatory (a Hopf bifurcation) is somewhere in [1870, 1875] for the mesh\nsize $h=1/96$. Via studying the flow field distortion of fluid flow at Re\nbefore and after Re$_{cr}$, the occurrence of the first pair of\nTaylor-G\\\"ortler-like vortices is connected to the flow field distortion at the\ntransition from steady flow to oscillatory flow in 3D lid-driven cubic cavity\nflows for Re $< 2000$.\n", "  The direct gravimetry problem is solved by dividing each deposit body into a\nset of vertical adjoining bars, whereas in the inverse problem, each deposit\nbody is modelled by a homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution (spheroid).\nWell-known formulae for the z-component of gravitational intensity for a\nspheroid are transformed to a convenient form. Parameters of a spheroid are\ndetermined by minimizing the Tikhonov smoothing functional with constraints on\nthe parameters, which makes the ill-posed inverse problem by unique and stable.\nThe Bulakh algorithm for initial estimating the depth and mass of a deposit is\nmodified. The proposed technique is illustrated by numerical model examples of\ndeposits in the form of two and five bodies. The inverse gravimetry problem is\ninterpreted as a gravitational tomography problem or, in other words, as\n\"introscopy\" of Earth's crust and mantle.\n", "  One of the main goals of scientific research is to provide a description of\nthe empirical data which is as accurate and comprehensive as possible, while\nrelying on as few and simple assumptions as possible. In this paper, I propose\na definition of the notion of \"few and simple assumptions\" that is not affected\nby known problems. This leads to the introduction of a simple model of\nscientific progress that is based only on empirical accuracy and conciseness.\nAn essential point in this task is the understanding of the role played by\n\"measurability\" in the formulation of a scientific theory. This is the key to\nprevent artificially concise formulations. The model is confronted here with\nmany possible objections and with challenging cases of real progress. Although\nI cannot exclude that the model might have some limitations, it includes all\nthe cases of genuine progress examined here, and no spurious one. In this\nmodel, I stress the role of the \"state of the art\", which is the collection of\nall the theories that are the only legitimate source of scientific predictions.\nProgress is a global upgrade of the state of the art.\n", "  We argue that the spin of the 750 GeV resonance can be determined at the\n99.7% confidence level in the di-photon channel with as few as 10 fb$^{-1}$ of\nluminosity. This result is true if the resonance is produced by gluon fusion\n(independently of the selection cuts) while an appropriate choice of selection\ncuts is needed if quark production is sub-dominantly present--which is the case\nof the Kaluza-Klein gravitational excitation under the hypothesis of a spin-2\nresonance. A proportionally larger luminosity is required if the model for the\nspin-2 resonance includes a dominant production by quarks or in the absence of\nan efficient separation of the signal from the background.\n", "  It is mostly agreed that Popper's criterion of falsifiability fails to\nprovide a useful demarcation between science and pseudo-science, because ad-hoc\nassumptions are always able to save any theory that conflicts with the\nempirical data (a.k.a. the Duhem-Quine problem), and a characterization of\nad-hoc assumptions is lacking. Moreover, adding some testable predictions is\nnot very difficult. It should be emphasized that these problems do not simply\nmake Popper's demarcation approximate (if it were so, all our problems would be\nsolved!), they make it totally useless. More in general, no philosophical\ncriterion of demarcation is presently able to rule out even some of the most\nblatant cases of pseudo-science, not even approximatively (in any well defined\nsense of approximation). This is in sharp contrast with our firm belief that\nsome theories are clearly not scientific. Where does this belief come from? In\nthis paper I argue that it is necessary and possible to recognize the notion of\nsyntactic simplicity that is able to tell the difference between empirically\nequivalent scientific and non-scientific theories, with a confidence that is\nadequate to many important practical purposes, and it fully agrees with the\njudgments generally held in the scientific community.\n", "  In the 1960s, it has been substantiated that an equation of Schrodinger type\ncould describe the diffusion phenomena, and the main consequence from this\nfinding has been that there would be wave property in the diffusion processes\nas well. This theory has been immediately proved through laboratorial\nexperiments. Afterwards the theory was applied to the primordial nebula which\nwas thought to surround the protosun, and has found the consistency of the\nprediction of the theory with current distance distribution of the planets to\nbe excellent. At the end of 20th century new satellites of planets were\ndiscovered. On the basis of the new data, the theory is tested thoroughly and\nthe result allows us to come to the conclusion that the basic process for the\ndistances of the planets from the protosun to be determined has been the\ndiffusion of the primordial nebula consisting of mainly molecular gas.\n", "  We investigate heating and acceleration of protons from a thermal gas with a\ngeneric diffusion and acceleration model, and subject to Coulomb scattering and\nenergy loss, as was carried out in Petrosian & East (2008) for electrons. As\nprotons gain energy their loss to electrons becomes important. Thus, we need to\nsolve the coupled proton-electron kinetic equation. We numerically solve the\ncoupled Fokker-Plank equations and computes the time evolution of the spectra\nof both particles. We show that this can lead to a quasi-thermal component plus\na high energy nonthermal tail. We determine the evolution of nonthermal tail\nand the quasi-thermal component. The results may be used to explore the\npossibility of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation as a source of hard X-ray\nemissions from hot sources such as solar flares, accretion disk coronas and the\nintracluster medium of galaxy clusters. We find that emergence of nonthermal\nprotons is accompanied by excessive heating of the entire plasma, unless the\nturbulence needed for scattering and acceleration is steeper than Kolmogorov\nand the acceleration parameters, the duration of the acceleration, and/or the\ninitial distributions are significantly fine-tuned. These results severely\nconstraint the feasibility of nonthermal inverse bremsstrahlung process\nproducing hard X-ray emissions. However the nonthermal tail may be the seed\nparticles for further re-acceleration to relativistic energies, say by a shock.\nIn the Appendix we present some tests of the integrity of the algorithm used\nand present a new formula for the energy loss rate due to inelastic\nproton-proton interactions.\n", "  It is well known that the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space form an\northomodular lattice. Elements of this orthomodular lattice are the\npropositions of a quantum mechanical system represented by the Hilbert space,\nand by Gleason's theorem atoms of this orthomodular lattice correspond to pure\nstates of the system. Wigner's theorem says that the automorphism group of this\northomodular lattice corresponds to the group of unitary and anti-unitary\noperators of the Hilbert space. This result is of basic importance in the use\nof group representations in quantum mechanics.\n  The closed subspaces $A$ of a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ correspond to\ndirect product decompositions $\\mathcal{H}\\simeq A\\times A^\\perp$ of the\nHilbert space, a result that lies at the heart of the superposition principle.\nIt has been shown that the direct product decompositions of any set, group,\nvector space, and topological space form an orthomodular poset. This is the\nbasis for a line of study in foundational quantum mechanics replacing Hilbert\nspaces with other types of structures. It is the purpose of this note to prove\na version of Wigner's theorem: for an infinite set $X$, the automorphism group\nof the orthomodular poset Fact $(X)$ of direct product decompositions of $X$ is\nisomorphic to the permutation group of $X$.\n  The structure Fact $(X)$ plays the role for direct product decompositions of\na set that the lattice of equivalence relations plays for surjective images of\na set. So determining its automorphism group is of interest independent of its\napplication to quantum mechanics. Other properties of Fact $(X)$ are determined\nin proving our version of Wigner's theorem, namely that Fact $(X)$ is atomistic\nin a very strong way.\n", "  We have investigated electron band structure of epitaxially grown graphene on\nan SiC(0001) substrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In\nsingle-layer graphene, abnormal high spectral intensity is observed at the\nDirac energy whose origin has been questioned between in-gap states induced by\nthe buffer layer and plasmaron bands induced by electron-plasmon interactions.\nWith the formation of double-layer graphene, the Dirac energy does not show the\nhigh spectral intensity any longer different from the single-layer case. The\ninconsistency between the two systems suggests that the main ingredient of the\nhigh spectral intensity at the Dirac energy of single-layer graphene is the\nelectronic states originating from the coupling of the graphene $\\pi$ bands to\nthe localized $\\pi$ states of the buffer layer, consistent with the theoretical\nprediction on the presence of in-gap states.\n", "  This paper presents a new theory of turbulent mixing in stirred reactors. The\ndegree of homogeneity of a mixed fluid may be characterized by the Kolmogorov\nmicro-scale. The smaller its value, the better homogeneity. The micro-scale\nscales inversely with the fourth root of the energy dissipation rate in the\nstirring process. The higher this rate, the smaller lambda, and the better the\nhomogeneity in the reactor. This is true for Newtonian fluids. In non-Newtonian\nfluids the situation is different. For instance, in shear-thickening fluids it\nis plausible that high shear rates thicken the fluid and might strangle the\nmixing. The internal interactions between different fluid-mechanical and\ncolloidal variables are subtle, namely due to the (until recently) very limited\nunderstanding of turbulence. Starting from a qualitatively new turbulence\ntheory for inviscid fluids [Baumert, 2013], giving e.g. the Karman constant as\n$(2\\pi)^{-1/2} = 0.40$ [the super-pipe in Princeton gave 0.40 p/m 0.02, Bailey\net al., 2014], we generalize this approach to the case of viscous fluids and\nderive equations which in the steady state exhibit two solutions. One solution\nbranch describes a state of good mixing, the other a state of strangled\nturbulence. The physical system cannot be in two different steady states at the\nsame time. But it is physically admissible to switch between the two steady\nstates by non-stationary transitions, maybe in a chaotic fashion.\n", "  A large family of deployable filamentary structures can be built by\nconnecting two elastic rods along their length. The resulting structure has\ninteresting shapes that can be stabilized by tuning the material properties of\neach rod. To model this structure and study its stability, we show that the\nequilibrium equations describing unloaded states can be derived from a\nvariational principle. We then use a novel geometric method to study the\nstability of the resulting equilibria. As an example we apply the theory to\nestablish the stability of all possible equilibria of the Bristol ladder.\n", "  The known Omori law is presented in the form of differential equation that\ndescribes the evolution of the aftershock activity. This equation is derived\nhypothetically with taking into account deactivation of the faults in\nepicentral zone of the main shock. A generalization of the Omori law is\nproposed.\n", "  Spin pumping in Yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG)/nonmagnetic-metal (NM) layer\nsystems under ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) conditions is a popular method of\ngenerating spin current in the NM layer. A good understanding of the spin\ncurrent source is essential in extracting spin Hall angle of the NM and in\npotential spintronics applications. It is widely believed that spin current is\npumped from precessing YIG magnetization into NM layer. Here, by combining\nmicrowave absorption and DC-voltage measurements on YIG/Pt and YIG/NM1/NM2\n(NM1=Cu or Al, NM2=Pt or Ta), we unambiguously showed that spin current in NM\ncame from the magnetized NM surface (in contact with YIG) due to the magnetic\nproximity effect (MPE), rather than the precessing YIG magnetization. This\nconclusion is reached through our unique detecting method where the FMR\nmicrowave absorption of the magnetized NM surface, hardly observed in the\nconventional FMR experiments, was greatly amplified when the electrical\ndetection circuit was switched on.\n", "  The ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}D_{s}^{\\ast}$ weak decay is studied with\nthe perturbative QCD approach firstly. It is found that (1) main contributions\nto branching ratio come from the longitudinal and parallel helicity amplitudes,\n(2) branching ratio, longitudinal and parallel polarization fractions are\nsensitive to the wave functions of the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ meson, (3) branching\nratio for the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}D_{s}^{\\ast}$ decay can reach up\nto $10^{-9}$, which might be promisingly measured by the future experiments.\n", "  Learning is a complex cognitive process that depends not only on an\nindividual capability of knowledge absorption but it can be also influenced by\nvarious group interactions and by the structure of an academic curriculum. We\nhave applied methods of statistical analyses and data mining (Principal\nComponent Analysis and Maximal Spanning Tree) for anonymized students' scores\nat Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology. A slight negative\nlinear correlation exists between mean and variance of course grades, i.e.\ncourses with higher mean scores tend to possess a lower scores variance.\n  There are courses playing a central role, e.g. their scores are highly\ncorrelated to other scores and they are in the centre of corresponding Maximal\nSpanning Trees. Other courses contribute significantly to students' score\nvariance as well to the first principal component and they are responsible for\ndifferentiation of students' scores. Correlations of the first principal\ncomponent to courses' mean scores and scores variance suggest that this\ncomponent can be used for assigning ECTS points to a given course. The analyse\nis independent from declared curricula of considered courses. The proposed\nmethodology is universal and can be applied for analysis of student's scores\nand academic curriculum at any faculty.\n", "  Here we demonstrate that significant progress in this area may be achieved by\nintroducing structural elements that form hydrogen bonds with environment.\nConsidering several examples of hybrid framework materials with different\nstructural ordering containing protonated sulfonium cation H3S+ that forms\nstrong hydrogen bonds with electronegative halogen anions (Cl-, F-), we found\nthat hydrogen bonding increases the structural stability of the material and\nmay be used for tuning electronic states near the bandgap. We suggest that such\na behavior has a universal character and should be observed in hybrid\ninorganic-organic framework materials containing protonated cations. This\neffect may serve as a viable route for optoelectronic and photovoltaic\napplications.\n", "  Excitation of spin wave modes of a vortex-state magnetic dot by an\nout-of-plane oscillating magnetic field is studied numerically in the presence\nof a static in-plane magnetic field. It is shown, that the application of the\nin-plane static field shifts the position of the vortex core and leads to the\nseparate excitation of different azimuthal dipolar spin waves my perpendicular\noscillating field. It is also shown that the excited dipolar azimuthal spin\nwaves excite the gyrotropic mode of the vortex core rotation and, depending on\nthe excitation frequency, cause a significant modification (increase or\ndecrease) of the apparent dissipation rate of the gyrotropic mode. The last\neffect can be explained by the nonlinear parametric interaction between the\ngyrotropic mode and the dipolar spin wave modes with different azimuthal\nindices.\n", "  The basic science responsible for the fascinating shapes of ice crystals and\nsnowflakes is still not understood. Insufficient knowledge of the interaction\npotentials and the lack of relevant experimental access to the growth process\nare to blame for this failure. Here, we study the growth of fractal\nnanostructures in a two-dimensional (2D) system, intercalated between mica and\ngraphene. Based on our Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) data we provide\ncompelling evidence that these fractals are 2D ice. They grow while they are in\nmaterial contact with the atmosphere at 20 $^{\\circ}$C and without significant\nthermal contact to the ambient. The growth is studied in-situ, in real time and\nspace at the nanoscale. We find that the growing 2D ice nanocrystals assume a\nfractal shape, which is conventionally attributed to Diffusion Limited\nAggregation (DLA). However, DLA requires a low mass density mother phase, in\ncontrast to the actual currently present high mass density mother phase. Latent\nheat effects and consequent transport of heat and molecules are found to be key\ningredients for understanding the evolution of the snow (ice) flakes. We\nconclude that not the local availability of water molecules (DLA), but rather\nthem having the locally required orientation is the key factor for\nincorporation into the 2D ice nanocrystal. In combination with the transport of\nlatent heat we attribute the evolution of fractal 2D ice nanocrystals to local\ntemperature dependent Rotation Limited Aggregation (RLA). The ice growth occurs\nunder extreme supersaturation, i.e. the conditions closely resemble the natural\nones for the growth of complex 2D snow (ice) flakes and we consider our\nfindings crucial for solving the 'perennial' snow (ice) flake enigma.\n", "  Rather than attempting to summarise the full spectrum of recent advances in\nBeyond the Standard Model (BSM) theory, which are many, in this talk I will\ninstead take the opportunity to focus on two frameworks related to the\nhierarchy problem currently receiving significant attention. They are the `Twin\nHiggs' and the `Relaxion'. I will summarise the basic underlying structure of\nthese theories at a non-expert level and highlight some interesting\nphenomenological signatures or outstanding problems.\n", "  Direct dynamics methods using Gaussian wavepackets have to rely only on local\nproperties, such as gradients and hessians at the center of the wavepacket, so\nas to be compatible with the usual quantum chemistry methods. Matrix elements\nof the potential energy surfaces between wavepackets therefore usually have to\nbe approximated.\n  It is shown, that if a modified form of valence bond theory is used instead\nof the usual MO-based theories, the matrix elements can be obtained exactly.\nThis is so because the molecular Hamiltonian only contains the Coulomb\npotential, for which matrix elements between different basis functions\n(consisting of Gaussian nuclear and electronic orbitals) are all well-known. In\nvalence bond theory the self-consistent field calculation can be avoided so\nthat the matrix elements are analytical functions of the nuclear coordinates.\n  A method for simulating non-adiabatic quantum dynamics is sketched, where\ncoherent state trajectories are propagated \"on the fly\" on adiabatic potential\nenergy surfaces without making approximations to the matrix elements\nresponsible for the coupling between trajectories.\n", "  We investigate the multiple bifurcations in periodic orbit families in the\npotential field of a highly irregular-shaped celestial body. Topological cases\nof periodic orbits and four kinds of basic bifurcations in periodic orbit\nfamilies are studied. Multiple bifurcations in periodic orbit families consist\nof four kinds of basic bifurcations. We found both binary period-doubling\nbifurcations and binary tangent bifurcations in periodic orbit families around\nasteroid 433 Eros. The periodic orbit family with binary period-doubling\nbifurcations is nearly circular, with almost zero inclination, and is reversed\nrelative to the body of the asteroid 433 Eros. This implies that there are two\nstable regions separated by one unstable region for the motion around this\nasteroid. In addition, we found triple bifurcations which consist of two real\nsaddle bifurcations and one period-doubling bifurcation. A periodic orbit\nfamily generated from an equilibrium point of asteroid 433 Eros has five\nbifurcations, which are one real saddle bifurcation, two tangent bifurcations,\nand two period-doubling bifurcations.\n", "  In phase unwrapping, the locations and densities of residues are indicative\nof the severity of the unwrapping problem. The residues are used to detect and\nevade inconsistent phase areas. Gdeisat et al. proposed an algorithm to\nincrease the number of residues in a wrapped-phase map to improve the results\nof phase unwrapping. But this method will take much time to make the Fourier\ntransform, inverse Fourier transform, select and shift the spectral components,\nand there is no theoretical analysis on why the frequency shift can increase\nthe number of residues. In view of the above problems, we proposed an algorithm\nto increase the number of residues in a wrapped-phase map, which only uses a\nsimple multiply operation in spatial domain to realize frequency shift by\ntaking advantage of the frequency shift property of Fourier transform. Besides\nthat, we discuss the relationship between the number of residues and frequency\nshift. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity\nof the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod can speed up more than 50%.\n", "  In order to completely eliminate, or greatly reduce the number of phase wraps\nin 2D wrapped phase map, Gdeisat et al. proposed an algorithm, which uses\nshifting the spectrum towards the origin. But the spectrum can be shifted only\nby an integer number, meaning that the phase wraps reduction is often not\noptimal. In addition, Gdeisat's method will take much time to make the Fourier\ntransform, inverse Fourier transform, select and shift the spectral components.\nIn view of the above problems, we proposed an improved method for phase wraps\nelimination or reduction. First, the wrapped phase map is padded with zeros,\nthe carrier frequency of the projected fringe is determined by high resolution,\nwhich can be used as the moving distance of the spectrum. And then realize\nfrequency shift in spatial domain. So it not only can enable the spectrum to be\nshifted by a rational number when the carrier frequency is not an integer\nnumber, but also reduce the execution time. Finally, the experimental results\ndemonstrated that the proposed method is feasible.\n", "  The spatio-temporal aspects of the transition to turbulence are considered in\nthe case of a boundary layer flow developing above a flat plate exposed to\nfree-stream turbulence. Combining results on the receptivity to free-stream\nturbulence with the nonlinear concept of a transition threshold, a physically\nmotivated model suggests a spatial distribution of spot nucleation events. To\ndescribe the evolution of turbulent spots a probabilistic cellular automaton is\nintroduced, with all parameters directly fitted from numerical simulations of\nthe boundary layer. The nucleation rates are then combined with the cellular\nautomaton model, yielding excellent quantitative agreement with the statistical\ncharacteristics for different free-stream turbulence levels. We thus show how\nthe recent theoretical progress on transitional wall-bounded flows can be\nextended to the much wider class of spatially developing boundary-layer flows.\n", "  We demonstrate, for the first time, confinement of the orientation of\nmicron-sized graphitic flakes to a well-defined plane. We orient and\nrotationally trap lipid-coated highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)\nmicro-flakes in aqueous solution using a combination of uniform magnetic and AC\nelectric fields and exploiting the anisotropic diamagnetic and electrical\nproperties of HOPG. Measuring the rotational Brownian fluctuations of\nindividual oriented particles in rotational traps, we quantitatively determine\nthe rotational trap stiffness, maximum applied torque and polarization\nanisotropy of the micro-flakes, as well as their dependency on the electric\nfield frequency. Additionally, we quantify interactions of the micro-particles\nwith adjacent glass surfaces with various surface treatments. We outline the\nvarious applications of this work, including torque sensing in biological\nsystems.\n", "  The Coulomb's formula for the force FC of electrostatic interaction between\ntwo point charges is well known. In reality, however, interactions occur not\nbetween point charges, but between charged bodies of certain geometric form,\nsize and physical structure. This leads to deviation of the estimated force FC\nfrom the real force F of electrostatic interaction, thus imposing the task to\nevaluate the disparity. In the present paper the problem is being solved\ntheoretically for two charged conductive spheres of equal radii and arbitrary\nelectric charges. Assessment of the deviation is given as a function of the\nratio of the distance R between the spheres centers to the sum of their radii.\nFor the purpose, relations between FC and F derived in a preceding work of\nours, are employed to generalize the Coulomb's interactions. At relatively\nshort distances between the spheres, the Coulomb force FC, as estimated to be\ninduced by charges situated at the centers of the spheres, differ significantly\nfrom the real force F of interaction between the spheres. In the case of zero\nand non-zero charge we prove that with increasing the distance between the two\nspheres, the force F decrease rapidly, virtually to zero values, i.e. it\nappears to be short-acting force.\n", "  Anisotropic density-near-zero (ADNZ) acoustic metamaterials are investigated\ntheoretically and numerically in this letter and are shown to exhibit\nextraordinary transmission enhancement when material loss is induced. The\nenhanced transmission is due to the enhanced propagating and evanescent wave\nmodes inside the ADNZ medium thanks to the interplay of near-zero density,\nmaterial loss, and high wave impedance matching in the propagation direction.\nThe equi-frequency contour (EFC) is used to reveal whether the propagating wave\nmode is allowed in ADNZ metamaterials. Numerical simulations based on\nplate-type acoustic metamaterials with different material losses were performed\nto demonstrate collimation enabled by the induced loss in ADNZ media. This work\nprovides a different way for manipulating acoustic waves.\n", "  The feature-rich electronic excitations of monolayer germanene lie in the\nsignificant spin-orbital coupling and the buckled structure. The collective and\nsingle- particle excitations are diversified by the magnitude and direction of\ntransferred momentum, the Fermi energy and the gate voltage. There are four\nkinds of plasmon modes, according to the unique frequency- and\nmomentum-dependent phase diagrams. They behave as two-dimensional acoustic\nmodes at long wavelength. However, for the larger momenta, they might change\ninto another kind of undamped plasmons, become the seriously suppressed modes\nin the heavy intraband e-h excitations, keep the same undamped plasmons, or\ndecline and then vanish in the strong interband e-h excitations. Germanene,\nsilicene and graphene are quite different from one another in the main features\nof the diverse plasmon modes.\n", "  Bismaleimide (BMI) are thermosetting polymers mainly used in aerospace\napplications having properties of dimensional stability, low shrinkage,\nchemical resistance, fire resistance, good mechanical properties and high\nresistance against various solvents, acids, and water. BMI is commercially\navailable as Homide 250. BMI coating has also been used for the corrosion\nprotection. Metallization (AL) of BMI using vacuum evaporation was done which\nserves the purpose of prevention of space charge accumulation in aircraft\nbodies. Addition of inorganic materials like metal oxides can influence the\nproperties of the polymer as an inorganic-organic composite. The\norganic-ionorganic composites have wide applications in electronics, optics,\nchemistry and medicine. Titanium dioxide (TiO2, Titania) has a wide range of\napplications starting from photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells to\noptical coatings and electronics. A BMI-TiO2 composite was prepared by chemical\nroute. Atmospheric Plasma Jet (APPJ) using Helium gas was also treated on BMI.\nXRD and FTIR studies of the composite system prepared at different temperatures\nshowed its crystalline and structural configuration.\n", "  We present a combined study of Ni $K$-edge resonant x-ray scattering and\ndensity functional calculations to probe and distinguish electronically driven\nordering and lattice distortions in nickelate heterostructures. We demonstrate\nthat due to the low crystal symmetry, contributions from structural distortions\ncan contribute significantly to the energy-dependent Bragg peak intensities of\na bond-ordered NdNiO$_3$ reference film. For a LaNiO$_3$-LaAlO$_3$ superlattice\nthat exhibits magnetic order, we establish a rigorous upper bound on the\nbond-order parameter. We thus conclusively confirm predictions of a dominant\nspin density wave order parameter in metallic nickelates with a\nquasi-two-dimensional electronic structure.\n", "  Neutrinos play a key role in core-collapse supernova explosions. Carrying\ninformation from deep inside the stellar core, neutrinos are direct probes of\nthe supernova mechanism. Intriguing recent developments on the role of\nneutrinos in supernovae are reviewed, as well as our current understanding of\nthe flavor conversions in the stellar envelope, and the detection perspectives\nof the next burst.\n", "  The lack of evidence for low energy supersymmetry at the LHC implies a\nsupersymmetry scale in excess a TeV. While this is consistent (and even\nhelpful) with a Higgs boson mass at $\\approx$ 125 GeV, simple supersymmetric\nmodels with scalar and gaugino mass universality are being pushed into strips\nof parameter space. These often require coannihilations to obtain an acceptable\nrelic density and the extent of these coannihilation strips will be discussed.\nIn contrast, non-supersymmetric grand unified theories such as SO(10) may also\nprovide a dark matter candidate. Because of the presence of an intermediate\nscale, these theories may unify gauge couplings, provide for neutrino masses\nand a suitably long lived proton.\n", "  We propose a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) technique applicable to\nhigh-dimensional multivariate normal distributions that effectively samples\nalong chaotic trajectories. The method is predicated on the freedom of choice\nof the HMC momentum distribution, and due to its mixing properties, exhibits\nsample-to-sample autocorrelations that decay far faster than those in the\ntraditional hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We test the methods on distributions\nof varying correlation structure, finding that the proposed technique produces\nsuperior covariance estimates, is less reliant on step-size tuning, and can\neven function with sparse or no momentum re-sampling. The method presented here\nis promising for more general distributions, such as those that arise in\nBayesian learning of artificial neural networks and in the state and parameter\nestimation of dynamical systems.\n", "  We analyze possible motion control of microparticles by means of external\nelectromagnetic fields which induce potential wells having fixed spatial\ndistribution but deepening over time up to some limit. It is assumed that given\nparticles are under conditions of the high vacuum and forces acting on these\nparticles are not dissipative. We have established slowdown of comparatively\nfast particles as a result of their transit through considered potential wells.\nThis process is demonstrated on example of the nonresonance laser beam with the\nintensity amplifying over time. More detailed research of particle slowdown in\nsuch electromagnetic fields is carried out on the basis of simple analytical\nrelationships obtained from basic equations of classical mechanics for the\nmodel of the one-dimensional rectangular potential well deepening over time.\nMethod for cooling of particles, demonstrated in the present work, may be\napplied for essential increase of spectroscopy resolution of various\nmicroparticles, including in definite cases also atoms and molecules in the\nground quantum state.\n", "  The cosmographic approach, which only relies upon the homogeneity and\nisotropy of the Universe on large scales, has become an essential tool in\ndealing with an increasing number of theoretical possibilities for explaining\nthe late-time acceleration of the Universe, ranging from Modified Gravity\ntheories to Dark Energy alternatives passing from testing the cosmological\nconcordance Lambda-CDM model. Despite its generality, we show that this method\nhas a number of shortcomings when trying to adequately reconstruct theories\nwith higher-order derivatives in either the gravitational or the matter sector.\nHerein some paradigmatic examples of such an inability, explanations of the\nlimitations and prospective cures will be presented.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics is assumed to be a low-energy\neffective theory with new physics theoretically motivated to be around TeV\nscale. The dissertation presents theories with new physics beyond the Standard\nModel at the TeV scale testable in the current High Energy Colliders. The study\non leptoquarks gauge bosons in reference to TopSU(5) model in chapter 2 showed\nthat their discovery mass range extends upto 1.5 TeV at 14 TeV LHC with\nluminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$. On the other hand, in chapter 3 we studied the\ncollider phenomenology of TeV scale mirror fermions in Left-Right Mirror model\nfinding that the reaches for the mirror quarks goes upto $750$ GeV at the $14$\nTeV LHC with $~300 ~fb^{-1}$ luminosity. In chapter 4 we have enlarged the\nbosonic symmetry to fermi-bose symmetry e.g. supersymmetry and have shown that\nSUSY with non-universalities in gaugino or scalar masses within high scale\nSUGRA set up can still be accessible at LHC with 14 TeV. In chapter 5, we\nperformed a study in respect to the $e^+e^-$ collider and find that precise\nmeasurements of the higgs boson mass splittings upto $\\sim 100$ MeV may be\npossible with high luminosity in the International Linear Collider (ILC). In\nchapter 6 we have shown that the experimental data on neutrino masses and\nmixings are consistent with the proposed 4/5 parameter Dirac neutrino models\nyielding a solution for the neutrino masses with inverted mass hierarchy and\nlarge CP violating phase $\\delta$ and thus can be tested experimentally.\nChapter 7 incorporates a warm dark matter candidate in context of two Higgs\ndoublet model. The model has several testable consequences at LHC. This\ndissertation presents an endeavor to study beyond standard model (BSM) physics\nat the TeV scale with testable signals in the Colliders.\n", "  An asymptotic approach for a Schroedinger type equation with non selfadjoint\nHamiltonian of a special type in the case of two close degeneracy (turning)\npoints is developed. Both real and complex degeneracy points are treated by a\nmethod of matched asymptotic expansions in the context of a unifying approach.\nAn asymptotic expansion near degeneracy point containing the parabolic cylinder\nfunctions is constructed and the transition matrix connecting the coefficients\nof adiabatic modes in front of and behind the degeneracy point is derived.\n  A simple non-technical recipe is also provided, which enables one to apply\nresults to different physical problems without performing intermediate\ncalculations.\n", "  The spatial resolution of thermodynamic functions, exemplified by the\nentropy, is discussed. A physical definition of the spatial resolution based on\na spatial analogy of the partial molar entropy is advocated. It is shown that\nneither the grid cell theory (Gerogiokas et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10,\n35 [2014]), nor the first-order grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (Nguyen et\nal. J. Chem. Phys., 137, 044101 [2012]), of spatially resolved hydration\nentropies satisfies the definition.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a small quantum world (SQW) , which in our\nopinion, is very helpful in the situations when an experimenter's tools for\npreparing quantum states and (or) for measuring the observables of a quantum\nsystem under study are restricted due to some kind of reasons. In this case it\nis advisable to use as original an appropriate subspace of complete Hilbert\nspace of states and respectively to utilize observables acting only in this\nsubspace. If this subspace possesses some additional symmetries, the structure\nof a pure states set, as a rule, is simpler by far than in general case.\nMoreover in such SQWs some specific irreducible entangled states may appear.\nThe similar states could be very helpful in various tasks connected with\nquantum informational applications. In the present paper main ideas outlined\nabove are developed in detail in the simple and instructive case of a two-qubit\nsystem in which the accessible space of states possesses the additional\nsymmetry structure of permutation group of three elements.\n", "  We point out a simple relation between the bulk field at an arbitrary radial\nposition and the boundary OPE, by placing some old work by Ferrara, Gatto,\nGrillo and Parisi in the AdS/CFT context. This gives us, in principle, a\nprescription for extracting the classical bulk field from the boundary\nconformal block, and also clarifies why the latter is computed by a geodesic\nWitten diagram. We apply this prescription to the BTZ black hole - viewed as a\npure state created by the insertion of a heavy operator in the boundary CFT_2 -\nand use it to relate a classical field in the bulk to a heavy-light Virasoro\nconformal block in the boundary. In particular, we obtain a relation between\nthe radial bulk position and the conformal ratios in the boundary CFT. We use\nthis to show that the singular points of the radial bulk equation occur when\nthe dual boundary operators approach each other and that the associated bulk\nmonodromies map to monodromies of the (appropriately transformed) conformal\nblock, thus providing a CFT interpretation of the radial monodromy.\n", "  We have measured the expansion velocities and proper motion of the ansae in\nNGC7009 using high dispersion echelle spectra and archive narrow band HST\nimages. Assuming that the ansae are moving at equal and opposite velocities\nfrom the central star we obtain an average system radial velocity of -54 +-2\nkm/s, the eastern ansa approaching and the western ansa receding at Vr = 5.5\n+-1 km/s relative to this value. Only the proper motion of the eastern ansa\ncould be measured, leading to 2.8 +- 0.8 arcsec/century, or Vt=130 +- 40.d\nkm/s, where d is the distance to the nebula in kpc. Additionally, the electron\ntemperature and density for each ansa was measured using line intensity ratios.\nThe results are Te = 9000 K and ne = 2000 /cm3 for both ansae within the\nerrors.\n", "  We have measured the proper motion (PM) and kinematics of the ansae in NGC\n7009 using high dispersion echelle spectra and archive narrow band HST images.\nAssuming that the ansae are moving at equal and opposite velocities from the\ncentral star we obtain a system radial velocity of -53+-2km/s, the eastern ansa\napproaching and the western ansa receding at Vr=5.3+-1km/s with respect to this\nvalue. The PM of the eastern ansa is 28+-8mas/yr, which with our weighted\ndistance to NGC 7009 of 0.86+-0.34kpc gives Vexp=112+-32km/s. The electron\ntemperature and density in both ansae were determined to be Te=9000+-400K and\nNe=2300+-400/cc. The dynamic age of the ansae is 925+-260yrs.and the implied PM\nof the central star is 1+-0.5mas/yr. This is in qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with previous work.\n", "  A commonly used measure to summarize the nature of a photon spectrum is the\nso-called Hardness Ratio, which compares the number of counts observed in\ndifferent passbands. The hardness ratio is especially useful to distinguish\nbetween and categorize weak sources as a proxy for detailed spectral fitting.\nHowever, in this regime classical methods of error propagation fail, and the\nestimates of spectral hardness become unreliable. Here we develop a rigorous\nstatistical treatment of hardness ratios that properly deals with detected\nphotons as independent Poisson random variables and correctly deals with the\nnon-Gaussian nature of the error propagation. The method is Bayesian in nature,\nand thus can be generalized to carry out a multitude of\nsource-population--based analyses. We verify our method with simulation\nstudies, and compare it with the classical method. We apply this method to real\nworld examples, such as the identification of candidate quiescent Low-mass\nX-ray binaries in globular clusters, and tracking the time evolution of a flare\non a low-mass star.\n", "  In the presence of a strong $m=2$ component in a rotating galaxy, the phase\nspace structure near corotation is shaped to a large extent by the {\\it\ninvariant manifolds} of the short period family of unstable periodic orbits\nterminating at L$_1$ or L$_2$. The main effect of these manifolds is to create\nrobust {\\it phase correlations} among a number of chaotic orbits large enough\nto support a {\\it spiral} density wave outside corotation. The phenomenon is\ndescribed theoretically by soliton-like solutions of a Sine-Gordon equation.\nNumerical examples are given in an N-Body simulation of a barred spiral galaxy.\nIn these examples, we demonstrate how the projection of unstable manifolds in\nconfiguration space reproduces essentially the entire observed bar-spiral\npattern.\n", "  Doubly-degenerate binary systems consisting of two white dwarfs both composed\nof carbon and oxygen and close enough that mass is transferred from the less\nmassive to the more massive are possible progenitors of type Ia supernovae. If\nthe mass transfer rate is slow enough that the accreting white dwarf can reach\n1.38 solar masses then it can ignite carbon degenerately at its centre. This\ncan lead to a thermonuclear runaway and thence a supernova explosion. However\nif the accretion rate is too high the outer layers of the white dwarf heat up\ntoo much and carbon ignites there non-degenerately. A series of mild carbon\nflashes can then propagate inwards and convert the carbon to neon relatively\ngently. There is no thermonuclear runaway and no supernova. We have determined\nthe critical rate for accretion and find it to be generally about two-fifths of\nthe Eddington rate. In the case of actual bianry stars the mass transfer rate\nfalls off as mass is transferred so we find that this rate can be very much\nexceeded at the onset of mass transfer. We determine combinations of white\ndwarf masses that can lead to central degenerate carbon ignition.\n", "  We present the first tests of a new method, the Correlated Component Analysis\n(CCA) based on second-order statistics, to estimate the mixing matrix, a key\ningredient to separate astrophysical foregrounds superimposed to the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB). In the present application, the mixing matrix is\nparameterized in terms of the spectral indices of Galactic synchrotron and\nthermal dust emissions, while the free-free spectral index is prescribed by\nbasic physics, and is thus assumed to be known. We consider simulated\nobservations of the microwave sky with angular resolution and white stationary\nnoise at the nominal levels for the PLANCK satellite, and realistic foreground\nemissions, with a position dependent synchrotron spectral index. We work with\ntwo sets of PLANCK frequency channels: the low frequency set, from 30 to 143\nGHz, complemented with the Haslam 408 MHz map, and the high frequency set, from\n217 to 545 GHz. The concentration of intense free-free emission on the Galactic\nplane introduces a steep dependence of the spectral index of the global\nGalactic emission with Galactic latitude, close to the Galactic equator. This\nfeature makes difficult for the CCA to recover the synchrotron spectral index\nin this region, given the limited angular resolution of PLANCK, especially at\nlow frequencies. A cut of a narrow strip around the Galactic equator (|b|<3\ndeg), however, allows us to overcome this problem. We show that, once this\nstrip is removed, the CCA allows an effective foreground subtraction, with\nresidual uncertainties inducing a minor contribution to errors on the recovered\nCMB power spectrum.\n", "  The ONC appears to be unusual on two grounds: The observed constellation of\nthe OB stars of the entire Orion Nebula cluster and its Trapezium at its centre\nimplies a time-scale problem given the age of the Trapezium, and an IMF problem\nfor the whole OB star population in the ONC. Given the estimated crossing time\nof the Trapezium, it ought to have totally dynamically decayed by now.\nFurthermore, by combining the lower limit of the ONC mass with a standard IMF\nit emerges that the ONC should have formed at least about 40 stars heavier than\n5 M_sun while only ten are observed. Using N-body experiments we (i) confirm\nthe expected instability of the trapezium and (ii) show that beginning with a\ncompact OB-star configuration of about 40 stars the number of observed OB stars\nafter 1 Myr within 1 pc radius and a compact trapezium configuration can both\nbe reproduced. These two empirical constraints thus support our estimate of 40\ninitial OB stars in the cluster. Interestingly, a more-evolved version of the\nONC resembles the Upper Scorpius OB association. The N-body experiments are\nperformed with the new C-code CATENA by integrating the equations of motion\nusing the chain-multiple-regularisation method. In addition, we present a new\nnumerical formulation of the initial mass function.\n", "  We examine volume-limited samples from the SDSS galaxies to look for\nrelations among internal and collective physical parameters of galaxies as\nfaint as M_r=- 17.5, which include morphology, luminosity, color, color\ngradient, concentration, size, velocity dispersion, equivalent width (EW) of\nH_alpha line,axis ratio, the luminosity and velocity dispersion functions. At\nfixed morphology and luminosity, we find that bright (M_r<-20) early-types show\nvery small dispersions in color, color gradient, concentration, size, and\nvelocity dispersion. These dispersions increase at fainter magnitudes, where\nthe fraction of blue early-types increases. Late-types show wider dispersions\nin all physical parameters compared to early types at the same luminosity.\nConcentration indices of early-types are well-correlated with velocity\ndispersion, but are insensitive to luminosity and color for bright galaxies.\nThe slope of the Faber-Jackson relation continuously changes from 4.6 +- 0.4 to\n2.7+- 0.2 when luminosity changes from M_r = -22 to -20. The size of early-\ntypes is well-correlated with stellar velocity dispersion (for >100 km/s). We\nfind that passive spirals are well-separated from star-forming late-types at EW\n(H_alpha) of about 4. An interesting finding is that many physical parameters\nof galaxies manifest different behaviors across the absolute magnitude of about\nM_* +- 1. The morphology fraction as a function of luminosity depends less\nsensitively on large scale structure than the luminosity function (LF) does,\nand thus seems to be more universal. The effects of internal extinction in\nlate-types on the completeness of volume limited samples and on the LF and\nmorphology fraction are found to be very important. (abridged)\n", "  Generalizations of gravitational Born-Infeld type lagrangians are\ninvestigated. Phenomenological constraints (reduction to Einstein-Hilbert\naction for small curvature, spin two ghost freedom and absence of Coulomb like\nSchwarschild singularity) select one effective lagrangian whose dynamics is\ndictated by the tensors g_{\\mu\\nu} and R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}(not R_{\\mu\\nu} or\nthe scalar R).\n", "  Bermann [ Nuovo Cimento B (1983), 74, 182 ] presented a law of variation of\nHubble parameter that yields constant deceleration parameter models of the\nUniverse. In this paper, we study some cosmological models with negative\nconstant deceleration parameter within the framework of Lyra geometry.\n", "  Flavour inclusive, udsc and b fragmentation functions in unbiased jets, and\nflavour inclusive, udsc, b and gluon fragmentation functions in biased jets are\nmeasured in e+e- annihilations from data collected at centre-of-mass energies\nof 91.2, and 183-209 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. The unbiased jets are\ndefined by hemispheres of inclusive hadronic events, while the biased jet\nmeasurements are based on three-jet events selected with jet algorithms.\nSeveral methods are employed to extract the fragmentation functions over a wide\nrange of scales. Possible biases are studied in the results are obtained. The\nfragmentation functions are compared to results from lower energy e+e-\nexperiments and with earlier LEP measurements and are found to be consistent.\nScaling violations are observed and are found to be stronger for the\nfragmentation functions of gluon jets than for those of quarks. The measured\nfragmentation functions are compared to three recent theoretical\nnext-to-leading order calculations and to the predictions of three Monte Carlo\nevent generators. While the Monte Carlo models are in good agreement with the\ndata, the theoretical predictions fail to describe the full set of results, in\nparticular the b and gluon jet measurements.\n", "  We present a search for the rare flavor-changing neutral-current decay $B^+\n\\to K^+ \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ based on data sample of 82 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the\nBABAR detector at the PEP-II B-factory. Signal events are selected by examining\nthe properties of the system recoiling against either a reconstructed hadronic\nor semileptonic charged B decay. Using these two independent samples, a\ncombined limit of ${\\mathcal B}(B^+ \\to K^+ \\nu\\bar{\\nu})<5.2 \\times 10^{-5}$\nis obtained at the 90% confidence level. In addition, by modifying the particle\nidentification criteria, a limit of ${\\mathcal B} (B^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})<1.0\n\\times 10^{-4}$ is obtained using hadronic $B$ reconstruction. All results are\npreliminary.\n", "  I present results of simulations of the q=10 and q=20 2-d Potts models in the\ntransition region. The asymptotic finite size behavior sets in only for\nextremely large lattices.

We review\nhow associated models, such as the $q$ harmonic oscillator, and the lattice\nsine-Gordon and Liouville models are obtained. Explicit expressions of the\nlocal Hamiltonian of the spin ${1 \\over 2}$ XXZ spin chain coupled to dynamical\ndegrees of freedom at the one end of the chain are provided. Furthermore, the\nboundary non-local charges are given for the lattice sine Gordon model and the\n$q$ harmonic oscillator with open boundaries. We then identify the spectrum and\nthe corresponding Bethe states, of the XXZ and the q harmonic oscillator in the\ncyclic representation with special non diagonal boundary conditions. Moreover,\nthe spectrum and Bethe states of the lattice versions of the sine-Gordon and\nLiouville models with open diagonal boundaries is examined. The role of the\nconserved quantities (boundary non-local charges) in the derivation of the\nspectrum is also discussed.\n", "  We review the recent progress made towards the classification of\nsupersymmetric solutions in ten and eleven dimensions with emphasis on those of\nIIB supergravity. In particular, the spinorial geometry method is outlined and\nadapted to nearly maximally supersymmetric backgrounds.

A 62, 012102 (2000)], a\nproposal is made to generate entangled macroscopically distinguishable states\nof two spatially separated traveling optical modes. We model the decoherence\ndue to light scattering during the propagation along an optical transmission\nline and propose a setup allowing an entanglement purification from a number of\npreparations which are partially decohered due to transmission. A purification\nis achieved even without any manual intervention. We consider a nondemolition\nconfiguration to measure the purity of the state as contrast of interference\nfringes in a double-slit setup. Regarding the entangled coherent states as a\nstate of a bipartite quantum system, a close relationship between purity and\nentanglement of formation can be obtained. In this way, the contrast of\ninterference fringes provides a direct means to measure entanglement.\n", "  This paper presents a new modified quantum mechanics, Critical Complexity\nQuantum Mechanics, which includes a new account of wavefunction collapse. This\nmodified quantum mechanics is shown to arise naturally from a fully discrete\nphysics, where all physical quantities are discrete rather than continuous. I\ncompare this theory with the spontaneous collapse theories of Ghirardi, Rimini,\nWeber and Pearle and discuss some implications of the theory for a realist view\nof the quantum realm.\n"]}
