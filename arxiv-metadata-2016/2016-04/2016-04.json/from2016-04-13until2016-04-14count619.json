This\nstructure is fabricated via three-dimensional two-photon direct laser writing\nand silver shadow evaporation. The comparison of measured linear optical\nspectra with theory shows good agreement and reveals a negative real part of\nthe refractive index at around 3.85 micrometer wavelength - despite the fact\nthat the metamaterial structure is bi-anisotropic due to the lack of inversion\nsymmetry along its surface normal.\n", "  We analyze fast and slow light transmission in a zig-zag microring resonator\nchain. This novel device permits the operation in both regimes. In the\nsuperluminal case, a new ubiquitous light transmission effect is found whereby\nthe input optical pulse is reproduced in an almost simultaneous manner at the\nvarious system outputs. When the input carrier is tuned to a different\nfrequency, the system permits to slow down the propagating optical signal.\nBetween these two extreme cases, the relative delay can be tuned within a broad\nrange.\n", "  We study the dynamics of entanglement in continuous variable quantum systems\n(CVQS). Specifically, we study the phenomena of Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD)\nin general two-mode-N-photon states undergoing pure dephasing. We show that for\nthese states, ESD never occurs. These states are generalizations of the\nso-called High NOON states, shown to decrease the Rayleigh limit of lambda to\nlambda/N, which promises great improvement in resolution of interference\npatterns if states with large N are physically realized. However, we show that\nin dephasing NOON states, the time to reach V_crit, critical visibility, scales\ninversely with N^2. On the practical level, this shows that as N increases, the\nvisibility degrades much faster, which is likely to be a considerable drawback\nfor any practical application of these states.\n", "  The extraordinary transmission of light through a nano slit in a metal film\nis enhanced by introducing a nano cavity antenna formed by a nearby metallic\nnano-strip over the slit opening. For a fixed wavelength, the width of the\nmetallic nano-strip should be chosen to make the horizontal\nmetal-insulator-metal waveguide of finite length resonant as a Fabry-Perot\ncavity. When such a cavity antenna is used to enhance the transmission through\na non-resonant nano slit, the slit should be opened at a position with maximal\nmagnetic field in the horizontal resonant cavity. It is shown that an optimized\ncavity antenna can enhance greatly the transmission of light through a\nnon-resonant nano slit (by about 20 times) or a resonant nano slit (by 124%).\nThe transmission spectrum of the nano slit can also be tuned by adjusting the\nwidth of the metallic nano-strip. Such a transmission enhancement with a nano\ncavity antenna is studied for the first time and the physical mechanism is\nexplained.\n", "  By exploiting photo-induced reorientation in azo-polymer thin films, we\ndemonstrate all-optical polarization-encoded information storage with a\nscanning near-field optical microscope. In the writing routine, 5-level bits\nare created by associating different bit values to different birefringence\ndirections, induced in the polymer after illumination with linearly polarized\nlight. The reading routine is then performed by implementing\npolarization-modulation techniques on the same near-field microscope, in order\nto measure the encoded birefringence direction.\n", "  We address the existence and properties of multipole solitons localized at a\nthermally insulating interface between uniform or layered thermal media and a\nlinear dielectric. We find that in the case of uniform media, only surface\nmultipoles with less than three poles can be stable. In contrast, we reveal\nthat periodic alternation of the thermo-optic coefficient in layered thermal\nmedia makes possible the stabilization of higher order multipoles.\n", "  We demonstrate the long-distance transmission of an ultra-stable optical\nfrequency derived directly from a state-of-the-art optical frequency standard.\nUsing an active stabilization system we deliver the frequency via a 146 km long\nunderground fiber link with a fractional instability of 3*10^{-15} at 1 s,\nwhich is close to the theoretical limit for our transfer experiment. The\nrelative uncertainty for the transfer is below 1*10^{-19} after 30 000 seconds.\nTests with a very short fiber show that noise in our stabilization system\ncontributes fluctuations which are two orders of magnitude lower, namely\n3*10^{-17} at 1 s, reaching 10^{-20} after 4000 s.\n", "  In this letter, we report on all-optical fiber approach to the generation of\nultra-low noise microwave signals. We make use of two erbium fiber mode-locked\nlasers phase locked to a common ultra-stable laser source to generate an 11.55\nGHz signal with an unprecedented relative phase noise of -111 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz\nfrom the carrier.The residual frequency instability of the microwave signals\nderived from the two optical frequency combs is below 2.3 10^(-16) at 1s and\nabout 4 10^(-19) at 6.5 10^(4)s (in 5 Hz bandwidth, three days continuous\noperation).\n", "  A well-established, silver fishnet design has been further miniaturized to\nfunction as a negative-index material at the shortest wavelength to date. By\nstudying the transmittance, reflectance, and corresponding numerical\nsimulations of the sample, we report in this paper a negative refractive index\nof -0.25 at the yellow-light wavelength of 580 nm.\n", "  We construct the exact time dependent density profile for a superposition of\nthe ground and singly excited states of a harmonically trapped one dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate in the limit of strongly interacting particles, the\nTonks-Girardeau gas. Results of an off resonant light scattering experiment\nprobing the system could allow to determine the number of particles contained\nin the gas, as well as the coefficients of the superposition.\n", "  We address light propagation in couplers with longitudinal biharmonic\nmodulation of refractive index in neighboring channels. While simplest\nsingle-frequency out-of-phase modulation allows suppression of coupling for\nstrictly defined set of resonant frequencies, the addition of modulation on\nmultiple frequency dramatically modifies the structure of resonances. Thus,\nadditional modulation on double frequency may suppress primary resonance, while\nmodulation on triple frequency causes fusion of primary and secondary\nresonances.\n", "  The optical conductivity of heavy fermions can reveal fundamental properties\nof the charge carrier dynamics in these strongly correlated electron systems.\nHere we extend the conventional techniques of infrared optics on heavy fermions\nby measuring the transmission and phase shift of THz radiation that passes\nthrough a thin film of UNi2Al3, a material with hexagonal crystal structure. We\ndeduce the optical conductivity in a previously not accessible frequency range,\nand furthermore we resolve the anisotropy of the optical response (parallel and\nperpendicular to the hexagonal planes). At frequencies around 7cm^-1, we find a\nstrongly temperature-dependent and anisotropic optical conductivity that -\nsurprisingly - roughly follows the dc behavior.\n", "  We theoretically examine plasmonic resonance between two close metallic\ngrains separated by a gap of width much less than the length of the incident\nelectromagnetic wave. Resonance conditions are established and the electric\nfield enhancement is found. Our general arguments are confirmed by analytic\nsolution of the problem for simplest geometries. We discuss an extension of our\nresults to more complex cases.\n", "  We observe experimentally two-dimensional solitons in superlattices\ncomprising alternating deep and shallow waveguides fabricated via the\nfemtosecond laser direct writing technique. We find that the symmetry of linear\ndiffraction patterns as well as soliton shapes and threshold powers largely\ndiffer for excitations centered on deep and shallow sites. Thus, bulk and\nsurface solitons centered on deep waveguides require much lower powers than\ntheir counterparts on shallow sites.\n", "  Context: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is to date the only normal external\ngalaxy that has been detected in high-energy gamma rays. High-energy gamma rays\ntrace particle acceleration processes and gamma-ray observations allow the\nnature and sites of acceleration to be studied. Aims: We characterise the\ndistribution and sources of cosmic rays in the LMC from analysis of gamma-ray\nobservations. Methods: We analyse 11 months of continuous sky-survey\nobservations obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope and compare it to tracers of the interstellar medium and models\nof the gamma-ray sources in the LMC. Results: The LMC is detected at 33 sigma\nsignificance. The integrated >100 MeV photon flux of the LMC amounts to (2.6\n+/- 0.2) * 10^-7 ph/cm2/s which corresponds to an energy flux of (1.6 +/- 0.1)\n* 10^-10 erg/cm2/s, with additional systematic uncertainties of ~16%. The\nanalysis reveals the massive star forming region 30 Doradus as a bright source\nof gamma-ray emission in the LMC in addition to fainter emission regions found\nin the northern part of the galaxy. The gamma-ray emission from the LMC shows\nvery little correlation with gas density and is rather correlated to tracers of\nmassive star forming regions. The close confinement of gamma-ray emission to\nstar forming regions suggests a relatively short GeV cosmic-ray proton\ndiffusion length. Conclusions: The close correlation between cosmic-ray density\nand massive star tracers supports the idea that cosmic rays are accelerated in\nmassive star forming regions as a result of the large amounts of kinetic energy\nthat are input by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive stars\ninto the interstellar medium.\n", "  Photon echo schemes are excellent candidates for high efficiency coherent\noptical memory. They are capable of high-bandwidth multi-pulse storage, pulse\nresequencing and have been shown theoretically to be compatible with quantum\ninformation applications. One particular photon echo scheme is the gradient\necho memory (GEM). In this system, an atomic frequency gradient is induced in\nthe direction of light propagation leading to a Fourier decomposition of the\noptical spectrum along the length of the storage medium. This Fourier encoding\nallows precision spectral manipulation of the stored light. In this letter, we\nshow frequency shifting, spectral compression, spectral splitting, and fine\ndispersion control of optical pulses using GEM.\n", "  We consider soliton formation in thermal nonlinear media bounded by\nrectangular cross-sections and uncover a new class of nonlinear stationary\ntopological state. Specifically, we find that stationary higher-order vortex\nstates in standard shapes do not exist, but rather they take the form of\nmultiple, spatially separated single-charge singularities nested in an\nelliptical beam. Double-charge states are found to be remarkably robust despite\ntheir shape asymmetry and the phase-singularity splitting. States with higher\ntopological charges are found to be unstable.\n", "  We developed a four-channel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector\nsystem based on a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler. All channels showed a system\ndetection efficiency (at a 100 Hz dark-count rate) higher than 16% at 1550 nm\nwavelength, and the best channel showed a system DE of 21% and 30% at 1550 nm\nand 1310 nm wavelength, respectively.\n", "  We study the physics of a new type of subwavelength nanocavities. They are\nbased on U-shaped metal-insulator-metal waveguides supporting the excitation of\nsurface plasmon polaritons. The waveguides are simultaneously excited from both\nsides of the U by incident plane waves. Due to their finite length discrete\nmodes emerge within the nanocavity. We show that the excitation symmetry with\nrespect to the cavity ends permits the observation of even and odd modes. Our\ninvestigations include near and far field simulations and predict a strong\nspectral far field response of the comparable small nanoresonators. The strong\nnear field enhancement observed in the cavity at resonance might be suitable to\nincrease the efficiency of nonlinear optical effects, quantum analogies and\nmight facilitate the development of active optical elements, such as active\nplasmonic elements.\n", "  An optical resonator is often called fully tunable if its tunable range\nexceeds the spectral interval that contains the resonances at all the\ncharacteristic modes of this resonator. For the high Q-factor spheroidal and\ntoroidal microresonators, this interval coincides with the azimuthal free\nspectral range. In this Letter, we demonstrate the first mechanically fully\ntunable spheroidal microresonator created of a silica microbubble having a 100\nmicron order radius and a micron order wall thickness. The tunable bandwidth of\nthis resonator is more than two times greater than its azimuthal free spectral\nrange.\n", "  We propose multilayer cylindrical invisibility cloaks that are optimized for\noblique incidences through combination of analytic formalism of scattering and\ngenetic optimization. We show that by using only four layers of homogeneous and\nanisotropic metamaterials without large values of constitutive parameters, the\nscattering for oblique incidences can be reduced by two orders. Although the\noptimization is done at a single incident angle, the cloak provides reduced\nscattering over a large range of incident angles.\n", "  This work reveals an experimental microscopy acquisition scheme successfully\ncombining Compressed Sensing (CS) and digital holography in off-axis and\nfrequency-shifting conditions. CS is a recent data acquisition theory involving\nsignal reconstruction from randomly undersampled measurements, exploiting the\nfact that most images present some compact structure and redundancy. We propose\na genuine CS-based imaging scheme for sparse gradient images, acquiring a\ndiffraction map of the optical field with holographic microscopy and recovering\nthe signal from as little as 7% of random measurements. We report experimental\nresults demonstrating how CS can lead to an elegant and effective way to\nreconstruct images, opening the door for new microscopy applications.\n", "  We describe an optical beam converter for an efficient transformation of\nGaussian femtosecond laser beams to single- or double-charge vortex beams\nshowing no spatial or topological charge dispersion. The device achieves a\nconversion efficiency of 75% for single- and 50% for double-charge vortex beams\nand can operate with high energy broad bandwidth pulses. We also show that the\ntopological charge of a femtosecond vortex beam can be determined by analyzing\nits intensity distribution in the focal area of a cylindrical lens.\n", "  We analyze localization of light in honeycomb photonic lattices restricted in\none dimension which can be regarded as an optical analog of (``armchair'' and\n``zigzag'') graphene nanoribbons. We find the conditions for the existence of\nspatially localized states and discuss the effect of lattice topology on the\nproperties of discrete solitons excited inside the lattice and at its edges. In\nparticular, we discover a novel type of soliton bistability, the so-called\ngeometry-induced bistability, in the lattices of a finite extent.\n", "  We present detailed analysis of the two gamma-ray sources,1FGL J1801.3-2322c\nand 1FGL J1800.5-2359c,that have been found toward the supernova remnant(SNR)\nW28 with the Large Area Telescope(LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope.1FGL J1801.3-2322c is found to be an extended source within the\nboundary of SNR W28,and to extensively overlap with the TeV gamma-ray source\nHESS J1801-233,which is associated with a dense molecular cloud interacting\nwith the supernova remnant.The gamma-ray spectrum measured with LAT from\n0.2--100 GeV can be described by a broken power-law function with a break of\n~1GeV,and photon indices of 2.09$\\pm$0.08(stat)$\\pm$0.28(sys) below the break\nand 2.74$\\pm$0.06(stat)$\\pm$0.09(sys) above the break.Given the clear\nassociation between HESS J1801-233 and the shocked molecular cloud and a\nsmoothly connected spectrum in the GeV--TeV band,we consider the origin of the\ngamma-ray emission in both GeV and TeV ranges to be the interaction between\nparticles accelerated in the SNR and the molecular cloud.The decay of neutral\npions produced in interactions between accelerated hadrons and dense molecular\ngas provide a reasonable explanation for the broadband gamma-ray spectrum. 1FGL\nJ1800.5-2359c, located outside the southern boundary of SNR W28, cannot be\nresolved.An upper limit on the size of the gamma-ray emission was estimated to\nbe ~16$'$ using events above ~2GeV under the assumption of a circular shape\nwith uniform surface brightness. It appears to coincide with the TeV source\nHESS J1800-240B,which is considered to be associated with a dense molecular\ncloud that contains the ultra compact HII region W28A2(G5.89-0.39).We found no\nsignificant gamma-ray emission in the LAT energy band at the positions of TeV\nsources HESS J1800-230A and HESS J1800-230C.The LAT data for HESS J1800-230A\ncombined with the TeV data points indicate a spectral break between 10GeV and\n100GeV.\n", "  We report on the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT observations of the Geminga pulsar, the\nsecond brightest non-variable GeV source in the $\\gamma$-ray sky and the first\nexample of a radio-quiet $\\gamma$-ray pulsar. The observations cover one year,\nfrom the launch of the $Fermi$ satellite through 2009 June 15. A data sample of\nover 60,000 photons enabled us to build a timing solution based solely on\n$\\gamma$ rays. Timing analysis shows two prominent peaks, separated by $\\Delta\n\\phi$ = 0.497 $\\pm$ 0.004 in phase, which narrow with increasing energy. Pulsed\n$\\gamma$ rays are observed beyond 18 GeV, precluding emission below 2.7 stellar\nradii because of magnetic absorption. The phase-averaged spectrum was fitted\nwith a power law with exponential cut-off of spectral index $\\Gamma$ = (1.30\n$\\pm$ 0.01 $\\pm$ 0.04), cut-off energy $E_{0}$ = (2.46 $\\pm$ 0.04 $\\pm$ 0.17)\nGeV and an integral photon flux above 0.1 GeV of (4.14 $\\pm$ 0.02 $\\pm$ 0.32)\n$\\times$ 10$^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The first uncertainties are statistical\nand the second are systematic. The phase-resolved spectroscopy shows a clear\nevolution of the spectral parameters, with the spectral index reaching a\nminimum value just before the leading peak and the cut-off energy having maxima\naround the peaks. Phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that pulsar emission is\npresent at all rotational phases. The spectral shape, broad pulse profile, and\nmaximum photon energy favor the outer magnetospheric emission scenarios.\n", "  By using parametric down-conversion process with a strong signal field\ninjection, we demonstrate coherent frequency down-conversion from a pump photon\nto an idler photon. Contrary to a common misunderstanding, we show that the\nprocess can be free of quantum noise. With an interference experiment, we\ndemonstrate that the coherence is preserved in the conversion process. This may\nlead to a high fidelity quantum state transfer from high frequency photon to\nlow frequency photon and connects a missing link in a quantum network. With\nthis scheme of coherent frequency down-conversion of photons, we propose a\nmethod of single-photon wavelength division multiplexing.\n", "  We demonstrate a miniature self-injection locked DFB laser using resonant\noptical feedback from a high-Q crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator.\nThe linewidth reduction factor is greater than 10,000, with resultant\ninstantaneous linewidth less than 200 Hz. The minimal value of the Allan\ndeviation for the laser frequency stability is 3x10^(-12) at the integration\ntime of 20 us. The laser possesses excellent spectral purity and good long term\nstability.\n", "  Si3N4 is an excellent material for applications of nanophotonics at visible\nwavelengths due to its wide bandgap and moderately large refractive index (n\n$\\approx$ 2.0). We present the fabrication and characterization of Si3N4\nphotonic crystal nanobeam cavities for coupling to diamond nanocrystals and\nNitrogen-Vacancy centers in a cavity QED system. Confocal\nmicro-photoluminescence analysis of the nanobeam cavities demonstrates quality\nfactors up to Q ~ 55,000, which is limited by the resolution of our\nspectrometer. We also demonstrate coarse tuning of cavity resonances across the\n600-700nm range by lithographically scaling the size of fabricated devices.\nThis is an order of magnitude improvement over previous SiNx cavities at this\nimportant wavelength range.\n", "  We discover that a spatially localized gain supports stable vortex solitons\nin media with cubic nonlinearity and two-photon absorption. The interplay\nbetween nonlinear losses and gain in amplifying rings results in suppression of\notherwise ubiquitous azimuthal modulation instabilities of radially symmetric\nvortex solitons. We uncover that the topology of the gain profile imposes\nrestrictions on the maximal possible charge of vortex solitons. Symmetry\nbreaking occurs at high gain levels resulting in the formation of necklace\nvortex solitons composed of asymmetric bright spots.\n", "  We report on the simultaneous observation, by delayed Bragg diffraction, of\nfour- and six-wave mixing processes in a coherently prepared atomic ensemble\nconsisting of cold cesium atoms. For each diffracted order, we observe\ndifferent temporal pulse shapes and dependencies with the intensities of the\nexciting fields, evidencing the different mechanisms involved in each process.\nThe various observations are well described by a simplified analytical theory,\nwhich considers the atomic system as an ensemble of three-level atoms in\n{\\Lambda} configuration.\n", "  We design coupled optical microcavities and report directional light emission\nfrom high-$Q$ modes for a broad range of refractive indices. The system\nconsists of a circular cavity that provides a high-$Q$ mode in form of a\nwhispering gallery mode, whereas an adjacent deformed microcavity plays the\nrole of a waveguide or collimator of the light transmitted from the circular\ncavity. As a result of this very simple, yet robust, concept we obtain high-$Q$\nmodes with promising directional emission characteristics. No information about\nphase space is required, and the proposed scheme can be easily realized in\nexperiments.\n", "  We show that ring-like localized gain landscapes imprinted in focusing cubic\n(Kerr) nonlinear media with strong two-photon absorption support new types of\nstable higher-order vortex solitons containing multiple phase singularities\nnested inside a single core. The phase singularities are found to rotate around\nthe center of the gain landscape, with the rotation period being determined by\nthe strength of the gain and the nonlinear absorption.\n", "  Fano mechanism is the universal explanation of asymmetric resonance appearing\nin different systems. We report the evidence of Fano-like resonance in\nselective reflection from a resonant two-level medium. We draw an analogy with\nthe asymmetric resonance previously obtained for the coupled oscillators. We\nalso take into account the effects of dielectric background and local-field\ncorrection and connect our results with optical bistability.\n", "  In Nature Photonics 5, 166 (2011), we reported on a planar dielectric antenna\nthat achieved 96% efficiency in collecting the photons emitted by a single\nmolecule. In that work the transition dipole moment of the molecule was set\nperpendicular to the antenna plane. Here, we present an extension of that\nscheme that reaches collection efficiencies beyond 99% for emitters with\narbitrarily oriented dipole moments. Our work opens important doors in a wide\nrange of contexts including quantum optics, quantum metrology, nano-analytics,\nand biophysics. In particular, we provide antenna parameters to realize\nultrabright single-photon sources in high-index materials such as semiconductor\nquantum dots and color centers in diamond, as well as sensitive detection of\nsingle molecules in nanofluidic devices.\n", "  We describe a rigidly-mounted optical cavity which is insensitive to inertial\nforces acting in any direction and to the compressive force used to constrain\nit. The design is based on a cubic geometry with four supports placed\nsymmetrically about the optical axis in a tetrahedral configuration. To measure\nthe inertial force sensitivity, a laser is locked to the cavity while it is\ninverted about three orthogonal axes. The maximum acceleration sensitivity is\n2.5\\times10^-11/g (where g=9.81 ms^-2), the lowest passive sensitivity to be\nreported for an optical cavity.\n", "  We report the relative frequency stabilization of a distributed feedback\nerbium-doped fiber laser on an optical cavity by serrodyne frequency shifting.\nA correction bandwidth of 2.3 MHz and a dynamic range of 220 MHz are achieved,\nwhich leads to a strong robustness against large disturbances up to high\nfrequencies. We demonstrate that serrodyne frequency shifting reaches a higher\ncorrection bandwidth and lower relative frequency noise level compared to a\nstandard acousto-optical modulator based scheme. Our results allow to consider\npromising applications in the absolute frequency stabilization of lasers on\noptical cavities.\n", "  We propose a method for applying the quantum error-correction method for\nerrors that occur during quantum gates. Using a perturbation treatment of the\nnoise that allows us to separate it from the ideal evolution of the quantum\ngate, we demonstrate that in certain cases it is necessary to divide the\nquantum gate in short time steps intercalated by correction procedures. A\nprescription of how these gates can be constructed is provided, as well as a\nproof that, even for the cases when the division of the quantum gate in short\ntime steps is not necessary, this method may be advantageous for reducing the\ntotal duration of the computation.\n", "  It is shown that the spatial Goos-H\\\"anchen shift is greatly affected by\nspatial coherence. A typical example is given.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate series of identical two, three, and five\ncoupled high Q-factor Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) microresonators\nformed by periodic nanoscale variation of the optical fiber radius. These\nmicroresonators are fabricated with a 100 \\mum period along an 18 \\mum radius\noptical fiber. The axial FWHM of these microresonators is 80 \\mum and their\nQ-factor exceeds 107. In addition, we demonstrate a SNAP microresonator with\nthe axial FWHM as small as 30 \\mum and the axial FWHM of the fundamental mode\nas small as 10 \\mum. These results may potentially enable the dense integration\nof record low loss coupled photonic microdevices on the optical fiber platform.\n", "  We demonstrate that modulation of the local strength of the cubic\nself-focusing (SF) nonlinearity in the two-dimensional (2D) geometry, in the\nform of a circle with contrast $\\Delta g$ of the SF coefficient relative to the\nambient medium with a weaker nonlinearity, stabilizes a family of fundamental\nsolitons against the critical collapse. The result is obtained in an analytical\nform, using the variational approximation (VA) and Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK)\nstability criterion, and corroborated by numerical computations. For the small\ncontrast, the stability interval of the soliton's norm scales as $\\Delta N\\sim\n\\Delta g$ (the replacement of the circle by an annulus leads to a reduction of\nthe stability region by perturbations breaking the axial symmetry). To further\nillustrate this mechanism, we demonstrate, in an exact form, the stabilization\nof 1D solitons against the critical collapse under the action of a locally\nenhanced quintic SF nonlinearity.\n", "  When an electromagnetic wave is obliquely incident on the interface between\ntwo homogeneous media with different refractive indices, the requirement of\nphase continuity across the interface generally leads to a shift in the\ntrajectory of the wave. When a linearly position dependent phase shift is\nimposed at the interface, the resulting refraction may be described using a\ngeneralized version of Snell's law. In this Letter, we establish a formal\nequivalence between generalized refraction and blazed diffraction gratings,\nfurther discussing the relative merits of the two approaches.\n", "  We show that surface solitons in the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with truncated complex periodic potential can be stabilized by linear\nhomogeneous losses, which are necessary to balance gain in the near-surface\nchannel arising from the imaginary part of potential. Such solitons become\nstable attractors when the strength of homogeneous losses acquires values from\na limited interval and they exist in focusing and defocusing media. The domains\nof stability of surface solitons shrink with increase of the amplitude of\nimaginary part of complex potential.\n", "  Using the history-dependence of a dipolar glass hosted in a\ncompositionally-disordered lithium-enriched potassium-tantalate-niobate\n(KTN:Li) crystal, we demonstrate scale-free optical propagation at tunable\ntemperatures. The operating equilibration temperature is determined by previous\ncrystal spiralling in the temperature/cooling-rate phase-space.\n", "  The predictions that quantum theory makes about the outcomes of measurements\nare generally probabilistic. This has raised the question whether quantum\ntheory can be considered complete, or whether there could exist alternative\ntheories that provide improved predictions. Here we review recent work that\nconsiders arbitrary alternative theories, constrained only by the requirement\nthat they are compatible with a notion of \"free choice\" (defined with respect\nto a natural causal order). It is shown that quantum theory is \"maximally\ninformative\", i.e., there is no other compatible theory that gives improved\npredictions. Furthermore, any alternative maximally informative theory is\nnecessarily equivalent to quantum theory. This means that the state a system\nhas in such a theory is in one-to-one correspondence with its\nquantum-mechanical state (the wave function). In this sense, quantum theory is\ncomplete.\n", "  We introduce a new concept for stable spatial soliton formation, mediated by\nthe competition between self-bending induced by a strongly asymmetric nonlocal\nnonlinearity and spatially localized gain superimposed on a wide pedestal with\nlinear losses. When acting separately both effects seriously prevent stable\nlocalization of light, but under suitable conditions they counteract each\nother, forming robust soliton states that are attractors for a wide range of\nmaterial and input light conditions.\n", "  Faithful communication is a necessary precondition for large scale\nall-optical networking and quantum information processing. Related theoretical\ninvestigations in different areas of physics have led to various proposals in\nwhich finite discrete lattices are used as channels for short-distance\ncommunication tasks. Here, in the framework of femtosecond-laser-written\nwaveguide arrays, we present the first experimental realization of such a\nchannel with judiciously engineered couplings.\n", "  A potential flow model is derived for a large flap-type oscillating wave\nenergy converter in the open ocean. Application of the Green's integral theorem\nin the fluid domain yields a hypersingular integral equation for the jump in\npotential across the flap. Solution is found via a series expansion in terms of\nthe Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and even order. Several\nrelationships are then derived between the hydrodynamic parameters of the\nsystem. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the converter in the open\nocean and in a channel. The degree of accuracy of wave tank experiments aiming\nat reproducing the performance of the device in the open ocean is quantified.\nParametric analysis of the system is then undertaken. It is shown that\nincreasing the flap width has the beneficial effect of broadening the bandwidth\nof the capture factor curve. This phenomenon can be exploited in random seas to\nachieve high levels of efficiency.\n", "  Optical spectroscopy with broadband femtosecond laser pulses often involves\nsimultaneous excitation of multiple molecular species with close resonance\nfrequencies. Interpreting the collective optical response from molecular\nmixtures typically requires Fourier analysis of the detected time-resolved\nsignal. We propose an alternative method of separating coherent optical\nresponses from two molecular species with neighboring excitation resonances\n(here, vibrational modes of oxygen and carbon dioxide). We utilize\nro-vibrational coupling as a mechanism of suppressing the strong vibrational\nresponse from the dominating molecular species (O$_{2}$). Coherent\nro-vibrational dynamics lead to long \"silence windows\" of zero signal from\noxygen molecules. In these silence windows, the detected signal stems solely\nfrom the minority species (CO$_{2}$) enabling background-free detection and\ncharacterization of the O$_2$/CO$_2$ mixing ratio. In comparison to a Fourier\nanalysis, our technique does not require femtosecond time resolution or\ntime-delay scanning.\n", "  We have synthesized and characterized laser-deposited film samples of\nperovskite BaCrO_{3}, a missing member of the perovskite-chromate family. The\nBaCrO_{3} films have a substantially larger lattice constant than other\nchromates, are insulating, and exhibit weak ferromagnetism likely associated\nwith canted antiferromagnetism. Comparison with the other sister compounds\nCaCrO_{3} and SrCrO_{3} suggest an anomalous Mott transition where magnetism is\nindependent of whether the compound is metallic or insulating\n", "  We present an electrodynamical model of a novel quantum plasmonic device -\nmagneto-optical spaser. It is shown that a spherical gain nanoparticle coated\nwith a metallic magneto-optical shell can operate as a spaser amplifying\ncircularly polarized surface plasmons. The magneto-optical spaser may be used\nin design of optical isolator in plasmonic transmission lines as well as in\nspaser spectrometry of chiral molecules.\n", "  The Heisenberg picture for non-Hermitian but $\\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonian systems is suggested. If a non-Hermitian but\n$\\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to real second order equations of\nmotion, though their first order Heisenberg equations of motion are complex, we\ncan construct a Hermitian counterpart that gives the same second order\nequations of motion. In terms of a similarity transformation we verify the\niso-spectral property of the Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and\nobtain the related eigenfunctions. This feature can be used to determine real\neigenvalues for such non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. As an application, two\nnew non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are constructed and investigated, where one is\nnon-Hermitian and non-PT-symmetric and the other is non-Hermitian but\nPT-symmetric. Moreover, the complementarity and compatibility between our\ntreatment and the PT symmetry are discussed.\n", "  We propose a closed form formulation for the impedance of the\nMetal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) plasmonic transmission lines by solving the\nMaxwell's equations. We provide approximations for thin and thick insulator\nlayers sandwiched between metallic layers. In the case of very thin dielectric\nlayer, the surface waves on both interfaces are strongly coupled resulting in\nan almost linear dependence of the impedance of the plasmonic transmission line\non the thickness of the insulator layer. On the other hand, for very thick\ninsulator layer, the impedance does not vary with the insulator layer thickness\ndue to the weak-coupling/decoupling of the surface waves on each\nmetal-insulator interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nformulation using two test scenarios, namely, almost zero reflection in\nTee-junction and reflection from line discontinuity in the design of Bragg\nreflectors, where we compare our formulation against previously published\nresults.\n", "  We study isolated and binary neutron stars in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.\nThis theory modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action through the introduction of a\ndynamical scalar field coupled to the Pontryagin density. We here treat this\ntheory as an effective model, working to leading order in the Chern-Simons\ncoupling. We first construct isolated neutron star solutions in the\nslow-rotation expansion to quadratic order in spin. We find that isolated\nneutron stars acquire a scalar dipole charge that corrects its spin angular\nmomentum to linear order in spin and corrects its mass and quadrupole moment to\nquadratic order in spin, as measured by an observer at spatial infinity. We\nthen consider neutron stars binaries that are widely separated and solve for\ntheir orbital evolution in this modified theory. We find that the evolution of\npost-Keplerian parameters is modified, with the rate of periastron advance\nbeing the dominant correction at first post-Newtonian order. We conclude by\napplying these results to observed pulsars with the aim to place constraints on\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We find that the modifications to the observed\nmass are degenerate with the neutron star equation of state, which prevents us\nfrom testing the theory with the inferred mass of the millisecond pulsar\nJ1614-2230. We also find that the corrections to the post-Keplerian parameters\nare too small to be observable today even with data from the double binary\npulsar J0737-3039. Our results suggest that pulsar observations are not\ncurrently capable of constraining dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and thus,\ngravitational-wave observations may be the only path to a stringent constraint\nof this theory in the imminent future.\n", "  We study 2+1 dimensional phases with topological order, such as fractional\nquantum Hall states and gapped spin liquids, in the presence of global\nsymmetries. Phases that share the same topological order can then differ\ndepending on the action of symmetry, leading to symmetry enriched topological\n(SET) phases. Here we present a K-matrix Chern-Simons approach to identify all\ndistinct phases with Abelian topological order, in the presence of unitary or\nanti-unitary global symmetries . A key step is the identification of an edge\nsewing condition that is used to check if two putative phases are indeed\ndistinct. We illustrate this method for the case of $Z_2$ topological order\n($Z_2$ spin liquids), in the presence of an internal Z$_2$ global symmetry. We\nfind 6 distinct phases. The well known quantum number fractionalization\npatterns account for half of these states. Phases also differ due to the\naddition of a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. Also, we allow for\nthe unconventional possibility that anyons are exchanged by the symmetry. This\nleads to 2 additional phases with symmetry protected Majorana edge modes. Other\nroutes to realizing protected edge states in SET phases are identified.\nSymmetry enriched Laughlin states and double semion theories are also\ndiscussed. Two surprising lessons that emerge are: (i) gauging the global\nsymmetry of distinct SET phases always lead to different topological orders\nwith the same total quantum dimension, (ii) gauge theories with distinct\nDijkgraaf-Witten topological terms may have the same topological order.\n", "  We utilize and characterize high-power, high-linearity modified uni-traveling\ncarrier (MUTC) photodiodes for low-phase-noise photonic microwave generation\nbased on optical frequency division. When illuminated with picosecond pulses\nfrom a repetition-rate-multiplied gigahertz Ti:sapphire modelocked laser, the\nphotodiodes can achieve 10 GHz signal power of +14 dBm. Using these diodes, a\n10 GHz microwave tone is generated with less than 500 attoseconds absolute\nintegrated timing jitter (1 Hz-10 MHz) and a phase noise floor of -177 dBc/Hz.\nWe also characterize the electrical response, amplitude-to-phase conversion,\nsaturation and residual noise of the MUTC photodiodes.\n", "  We present a method to analyse the coupling of lateral displacements in\nnanoscale structures, in particular waveguide grating mirrors (WGM), into the\nphase of a reflected Gaussian beam using a finite-difference time-domain\nsimulation. Such phase noise is of interest for using WGMs in high-precision\ninterferometry. We show that WGMs do not couple lateral displacements into the\nphase of a reflected beam to a precision of 10^{-7} rad and that WGMs are\ntherefore not subject to the same stringent alignment requirements as\npreviously proposed layouts using diffraction gratings.\n", "  We introduce a system capable of focusing light through a multimode fiber in\n37ms, one order of magnitude faster than demonstrated in previous reports. As a\nresult, the focus spot can be maintained during significant bending of the\nfiber, opening numerous opportunities for endoscopic imaging and energy\ndelivery applications. We measure the transmission matrix of the fiber by\nprojecting binary-amplitude computer generated holograms using a digital\nmicromirror device and a field programmable gate array controller. The system\nshows two orders of magnitude enhancements of the focus spot relative to the\nbackground.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics of wave packets in two-dimensional parity-time-symmetric\noptical lattices near the phase-transition point are analytically studied. A\nnovel fourth-order equation is derived for the envelope of these wave packets.\nA pyramid diffraction pattern is demonstrated in both the linear and nonlinear\nregimes. Blow-up is also possible in the nonlinear regime for both focusing and\ndefocusing nonlinearities.\n", "  We designed and implemented a gradient index metasurface for the in-plane\nfocusing of confined terahertz surface waves. We measured the spatial\npropagation of the surface waves by two-dimensional mapping of the complex\nelectric field using a terahertz near-field spectroscope. The surface waves\nwere focused to a diameter of 500 \\micro m after a focal length of approx. 2\nmm. In the focus, we measured a field amplitude enhancement of a factor of 3.\n", "  Four-wave mixing can be used to generate coherent output beams, with\nfrequencies difficult to acquire in commercial lasers. Here a single narrow\nECDL locked to the two photon 5s-5d transition in rubidium is combined with a\ntapered amplifier system to produce a high power cw beam at 778 nm and used to\ngenerate coherent light at 420 nm through parametric four-wave mixing. This\nprocess is analyzed in terms of the the intensity and frequency of the incoming\nbeam as well as the atomic density of the sample. The efficiency of the process\nis currently limited when on resonance due to the absorption of the 420 nm\nbeam, and modifications should allow a significant increase in output power.\n", "  A splitting of modes in a circular graded-index optical fiber is demonstrated\nby solving the full Maxwell equations using the perturbation analysis. It is\nshown that the degeneracy of vortex Laguerre-Gauss modes with distinct orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) and polarization (spin) but the same total angular\nmomentum is lifted due to the spin-orbit (vector) and tensor forces. Numerical\nestimations of group delays of modes in optical fiber and frequency splitting\nin Fabry-Perot and ring resonators are presented.\n", "  The synchronization of chaotic lasers and the optical phase synchronization\nof light originating in multiple coupled lasers have both been extensively\nstudied, however, the interplay between these two phenomena, especially at the\nnetwork level is unexplored. Here we experimentally compare chaos\nsynchronization of laser networks with heterogeneous coupling delay times to\nphase synchronization of similar networks. While chaotic lasers exhibit\ndeterioration in synchronization as the network time delay heterogeneity\nincreases, phase synchronization is found to be independent of heterogeneity.\nThe experimental results are found to be in agreement with numerical\nsimulations for semiconductor lasers.\n", "  We report the observation of arbitrary accelerating beams designed using a\nnon-paraxial description of optical caustics. We use a spatial light\nmodulator-based setup and techniques of Fourier optics to generate circular and\nWeber beams subtending over 95 degrees of arc. Applying a complementary binary\nmask also allows the generation of periodic accelerating beams taking the forms\nof snake-like trajectories, and the application of a rotation to the caustic\nallows the first experimental synthesis of optical accelerating beams upon the\nsurface of a sphere in three dimensions.\n", "  Fast and efficient detection of the qubit state in trapped ion quantum\ninformation processing is critical for implementing quantum error correction\nand performing fundamental tests such as a loophole-free Bell test. In this\nwork we present a simple qubit state detection protocol for a $^{171}$Yb$^+$\nhyperfine atomic qubit trapped in a microfabricated surface trap, enabled by\nhigh collection efficiency of the scattered photons and low background photon\ncount rate. We demonstrate average detection times of 10.5, 28.1 and\n99.8\\,$\\upmu$s, corresponding to state detection fidelities of 99%, 99.85(1)%\nand 99.915(7)%, respectively.\n", "  We report fabrication of THz fiber Bragg gratings (TFBG) using CO2 laser\ninscription on subwavelength step-index polymer fibers. A fiber Bragg grating\nwith 48 periods features a ~4 GHz-wide stop band and ~15 dB transmission loss\nin the middle of a stop band. The potential of such gratings in design of\nresonant sensor for monitoring of paper quality is demonstrated. Experimental\nspectral sensitivity of the TFBG-based paper thickness sensor was found to be ~\n-0.67 GHz / 10 um. A 3D electromagnetic model of a Bragg grating was used to\nexplain experimental findings.\n", "  We study numerically a parametrically driven discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation modelling periodically curved waveguide arrays. We show that discrete\nsurface solitons persist, but their threshold power is altered by the drive.\nThere are critical drives at which the threshold values vanish. We also show\nthat parametric drives can create resonance with a phonon making a new barrier\nfor discrete solitons. By calculating the corresponding Floquet multipliers, we\nfind that the stability of symmetric and antisymmetric off-side discrete\nsurface solitons switches approximately at the critical drives for\nthresholdless solitons.\n", "  On applying a theorem previously derived by Wolf and Collett, we demonstrate\nthat partially coherent Gaussian Schell model uctuating sources (GSMS) produce\nexactly the same optical forces as a fully coherent laser beam. We also show\nthat this kind of sources helps to control the light-matter interaction in\nbiological samples which are very sensitive to thermal heating induced by\nhigher power intensities; and hence the invasiveness of the manipulation. This\nis a consequence of the fact that the same photonic force can be obtained with\na low intensity GSMS as with a high intensity laser beam.\n", "  We perform the first theoretical modeling of the spectral-temporal dynamics\nof parametric microresonator comb generation with octave-spanning bandwidths\nthrough use of the Lugiato-Lefever model extended to include higher-order\ndispersion and self-steepening. We show that three distinct stages are\nnecessary to achieve single-pulse modelocking and ultrabroadband, stabilized\ncombs. Our simulations agree well with previous experimental demonstrations and\npredict many of the observed features, including multi-pulse generation,\ndispersive wave generation, modelocking and comb stabilization.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence and stability of bright vortex solitons\nsustained by a ring-shaped parametric gain, for both focusing and defocusing\nKerr nonlinearities in lossy optical media. With the defocusing nonlinearity,\nthe vortices are stable at all values of the detuning parameter, while under\nthe focusing nonlinearity their stability region is limited to some positive\nvalues of the detuning. Unstable vortices in the focusing medium transform into\nstable rotating azimuthons.\n", "  We present exact numerical solutions of the damped-driven Jaynes--Cummings\nmodel adapted to describe absorptive optical bistability in the limit of a few\natoms strongly coupled to a high-finesse resonator. We show that the\nsimplifying semiclassical result for many physical quantities of interest is\nwell reproduced by the quantum model including even with only a few atoms in\nthe strongly coupled system. Nontrivial atom-field quantum cross-correlations\nshow up in the strong-driving limit.\n", "  Elastic light-by-light scattering, $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, is open to\nstudy at the Large Hadron Collider thanks to the large quasi-real photon fluxes\navailable in electromagnetic interactions of protons (p) and lead (Pb) ions.\nThe $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ cross sections for diphoton masses\n$m_{\\gamma\\gamma} > 5$ GeV amount to 105 fb, 260 pb, and 370 nb in p-p, p-Pb,\nand Pb-Pb collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\n= 14 TeV, 8.8 TeV, and 5.5 TeV respectively. Such a measurement has no\nsubstantial backgrounds in Pb-Pb collisions where one expects about 70 signal\nevents per run, after typical detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency\nselections.\n", "  We show that light tunneling inhibition may take place in suitable\ndynamically modulated waveguide arrays for light spots whose features are\nremarkably smaller than the wavelength of light. We found that tunneling\nbetween neighboring waveguides can be suppressed for specific frequencies of\nthe out-of-phase refractive index modulation, affording undistorted propagation\nof the input subwavelength light spots over hundreds of Rayleigh lengths.\nTunneling inhibition turns out to be effective only when the waveguide\nseparation in the array is above a critical threshold. Inclusion of a weak\nfocusing nonlinearity is shown to improve localization. We analyze the\nphenomenon in purely dielectric structures and also in arrays containing\nperiodically spaced metallic layers.\n", "  We investigated the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) stability of a hollow-fiber\nsetup used for high-energy, few-cycle pulse generation. Saturation of the\noutput pulse energy is observed at 0.6 mJ for a 260 um inner-diameter, 1 m long\nfiber, statically filled with neon, with the pressure adjusted to achieve an\noutput spectrum capable of supporting sub-4fs pulses. The maximum output pulse\nenergy can be increased to 0.8mJ by using either differential pumping, or\ncircularly polarized input pulses. We observe the onset of an\nionization-induced CEP instability, which does not increase beyond an input\npulse energy of 1.25 mJ due to losses in the fiber caused by ionization. There\nis no significant difference in the CEP stability with differential pumping\ncompared to static-fill, demonstrating that gas flow in differentially pumped\nfibers does not degrade the CEP stabilization.\n", "  We derive bounds on squark and slepton masses in mini-split supersymmetry\nscenario using low energy experiments. In this setup gauginos are at the TeV\nscale, while sfermions are heavier by a loop factor. We cover the most\nsensitive low energy probes including electric dipole moments (EDMs), meson\noscillations and charged lepton flavor violation (LFV) transitions. A leading\nlog resummation of the large logs of gluino to sfermion mass ratio is\nperformed. A sensitivity to PeV squark masses is obtained at present from kaon\nmixing measurements. A number of observables, including neutron EDMs, mu->e\ntransitions and charmed meson mixing, will start probing sfermion masses in the\n100 TeV-1000 TeV range with the projected improvements in the experimental\nsensitivities. We also discuss the implications of our results for a variety of\nmodels that address the flavor hierarchy of quarks and leptons. We find that\nEDM searches will be a robust probe of models in which fermion masses are\ngenerated radiatively, while LFV searches remain sensitive to simple-texture\nbased flavor models.\n", "  Scalar diffraction calculations such as the angular spectrum method (ASM) and\nFresnel diffraction, are widely used in the research fields of optics, X-rays,\nelectron beams, and ultrasonics. It is possible to accelerate the calculation\nusing fast Fourier transform (FFT); unfortunately, acceleration of the\ncalculation of non-uniform sampled planes is limited due to the property of the\nFFT that imposes uniform sampling. In addition, it gives rise to wasteful\nsampling data if we calculate a plane having locally low and high spatial\nfrequencies. In this paper, we developed non-uniform sampled ASM and Fresnel\ndiffraction to improve the problem using the non-uniform FFT.\n", "  We consider gapped fractional quantum Hall states on the lowest Landau level\nwhen the Coulomb energy is much smaller than the cyclotron energy. We introduce\ntwo spectral densities, \\rho_T(\\omega) and \\bar \\rho_T(\\omega), which are\nproportional to the probabilities of absorption of circularly polarized\ngravitons by the quantum Hall system. We prove three sum rules relating these\nspectral densities with the shift S, the q^4 coefficient of the static\nstructure factor S_4, and the high-frequency shear modulus of the ground state\n\\mu_\\infty, which is precisely defined. We confirm an inequality, first\nsuggested by Haldane, that S_4 is bounded from below by |S-1|/8. The Laughlin\nwavefunction saturates this bound, which we argue to imply that systems with\nground state wavefunctions close to Laughlin's absorb gravitons of\npredominantly one circular polarization. We consider a nonlinear model where\nthe sum rules are saturated by a single magneto-roton mode. In this model, the\nmagneto-roton arises from the mixing between oscillations of an internal metric\nand the hydrodynamic motion. Implications for experiments are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Nanodiamonds (NDs) containing silicon vacancy (SiV) defects were evaluated as\na potential biomarker for the labeling and fluorescent imaging of neural\nprecursor cells (NPCs). SiV-containing NDs were synthesized using chemical\nvapor deposition and silicon ion implantation. Spectrally, SiV-containing NDs\nexhibited extremely stable fluorescence and narrow bandwidth emission with an\nexcellent signal to noise ratio exceeding that of NDs containing\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. NPCs labeled with NDs exhibited normal cell\nviability and proliferative properties consistent with biocompatibility. We\nconclude that SiVcontaining NDs are a promising biomedical research tool for\ncellular labeling and optical imaging in stem cell research.\n", "  Constructing atom-resolved states from low-resolution data is of practical\nimportance in many areas of science and engineering. This problem is addressed\nin this paper in the context of multiscale factorization methods for molecular\ndynamics. These methods capture the crosstalk between atomic and coarse-grained\nscales arising in macromolecular systems. This crosstalk is accounted for by\nTrotter factorization, which is used to separate the all-atom from the\ncoarse-grained phases of the computation. In this approach, short molecular\ndynamics runs are used to advance in time the coarse-grained variables, which\nin turn guide the all-atom state. To achieve this coevolution, an all-atom\nmicrostate consistent with the updated coarse-grained variables must be\nrecovered. This recovery is cast here as a non-linear optimization problem that\nis solved with a quasi-Newton method. The approach yields a Boltzmann-relevant\nmicrostate whose coarse-grained representation and some of its fine-scale\nfeatures are preserved. Embedding this algorithm in multiscale factorization is\nshown to be accurate and scalable for simulating proteins and their assemblies.\n", "  Purpose: To present a closed formalism calculating charged particle radiation\ndamage induced in DNA. The formalism is valid for all types of charged\nparticles and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of\ndose to DNA-damage. Methods: The induction of double strand breaks in\nDNA--strings residing in irradiated cells is quantified using a single particle\nmodel. This leads to a proposal to use the cumulative Cauchy distribution to\nexpress the mix of high and low LET type damage probability generated by a\nsingle particle. A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to fit\nthe parameters of the model as a function of kinetic energy related to the\ndamage to a DNA molecule embedded in a cell. The model is applied for four\nparticles: electrons, protons, alpha--particles, and carbon ions. A geometric\ninterpretation of this observation using the impact ionization mean free path\nas a quantifier, allows extension of the model to very low energies. Results:\nThe mathematical expression describes the model adequately using a chi--square\ntest ($\\chi^2/NDF < 1$). This applies to all particle types with an almost\nperfect fit for protons, while the other particles seem to result in some\ndiscrepancies at very low energies. The implementation calculating a strict\nversion of the RBE based on complex damage alone is corroborated by\nexperimental data from the measured RBE. The geometric interpretation generates\na unique dimensionless parameter $k$ for each type of charged particle. In\naddition, it predicts a distribution of DNA damage which is different from the\ncurrent models.\n", "  We study the properties of bright and vortex solitons in thermal media with\nnonuniform thermal conductivity and homogeneous refractive index, whereby the\nlocal modulation of the thermal conductivity strongly affects the entire\nrefractive index distribution. While regions where the thermal conductivity is\nincreased effectively expel light, self-trapping may occur in the regions with\nreduced thermal conductivity, even if such regions are located close to the\nmaterial boundary. As a result, strongly asymmetric self-trapped beams may form\ninside a ring with reduced thermal conductivity and perform persistent rotary\nmotion. Also, such rings are shown to support stable vortex solitons, which may\nfeature strongly non-canonical shapes.\n", "  The ever-increasing quantity and complexity of scientific production have\nmade it difficult for researchers to keep track of advances in their own\nfields. This, together with growing popularity of online scientific\ncommunities, calls for the development of effective information filtering\ntools. We propose here a method to simultaneously compute reputation of users\nand quality of scientific artifacts in an online scientific community.\nEvaluation on artificially-generated data and real data from the Econophysics\nForum is used to determine the method's best-performing variants. We show that\nwhen the method is extended by considering author credit, its performance\nimproves on multiple levels. In particular, top papers have higher citation\ncount and top authors have higher $h$-index than top papers and top authors\nchosen by other algorithms.\n", "  Temperature inversion due to velocity filtration, a mechanism originally\nproposed to explain the heating of the solar corona, is demonstrated to occur\nalso in a simple paradigmatic model with long-range interactions, the\nHamiltonian mean-field model. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show\nthat when the system settles into an inhomogeneous quasi-stationary state in\nwhich the velocity distribution has suprathermal tails, the temperature and\ndensity profiles are anticorrelated: denser parts of the system are colder than\ndilute ones. We argue that this may be a generic property of long-range\ninteracting systems.\n", "  We consider the Lorentz model in a slab with two mass reservoirs at the\nboundaries. We show that, in a low density regime, there exists a unique\nstationary solution for the microscopic dynamics which converges to the\nstationary solution of the heat equation, namely to the linear profile of the\ndensity. In the same regime the macroscopic current in the stationary state is\ngiven by the Fick's law, with the diffusion coefficient determined by the\nGreen-Kubo formula.\n", "  We theoretically investigate ferromagnetic ordering in magnetically doped\nsolid-solution narrow-gap semiconductors with the strong spin-orbit interaction\nsuch as Cr-doped Bi$_2$(Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$)$_3$. We compute the spontaneous\nmagnetization of impurities and itinerant electrons, and estimate the critical\ntemperature as a function of the concentration of magnetic dopants and the\nstrength of the spin-orbit interaction. It is found that the critical\ntemperature is proportional to the concentration of dopants and enhanced with\nthe strong spin-orbit interaction. It is also found that the ferromagnetic\ntransition could make the system turn to the Weyl semimetal which possesses a\npair of Weyl points separating in the momentum space.\n", "  We study the nonlinear response of a driven cavity QED system in the extreme\nstrong coupling regime where the saturation photon number is below one by many\norders of magnitude. In this regime, multi-photon resonances within the\nJaynes--Cummings spectrum up to high order can be resolved. We identify an\nintensity and frequency range of the external coherent drive for which the\nsystem exhibits bistability instead of resonant multi-photon transitions. The\ncavity field evolves into a mixture of the vacuum and another quasi-classical\nstate well separated in phase space. The corresponding time evolution of the\noutgoing intensity is a telegraph signal alternating between two attractors.\n", "  Cascaded optical cavities appear in various quantum information processing\nschemes in which atomic qubits are sitting in separate cavities interconnected\nby photons as flying qubits. The usual theoretical description relies on a\ncoupled-mode Hamiltonian approach. Here we investigate the system of cascaded\ncavities without modal decomposition by using a scattering model approach and\ndetermine the validity regime of the coupled-mode models.\n", "  We report on the demonstration and characterization of a silicon optical\nresonator for laser frequency stabilization, operating in the deep cryogenic\nregime at temperatures as low as 1.5 K. Robust operation was achieved, with\nabsolute frequency drift less than 20 Hz over 1 hour. This stability allowed\nsensitive measurements of the resonator thermal expansion coefficient\n($\\alpha$). We found $\\alpha=4.6\\times10^{-13}$ ${\\rm K^{-1}}$ at 1.6 K. At\n16.8 K $\\alpha$ vanishes, with a derivative equal to $-6\\times10^{-10}$ ${\\rm\nK}^{-2}$. The temperature of the resonator was stabilized to a level below 10\n$\\mu$K for averaging times longer than 20 s. The sensitivity of the resonator\nfrequency to a variation of the laser power was also studied. The corresponding\nsensitivities and the expected Brownian noise indicate that this system should\nenable frequency stabilization of lasers at the low-$10^{-17}$ level.\n", "  Using the fractional statistical properties of so-called anyonic particles,\nwe present exact solutions for up to six strongly interacting particles in\none-dimensional confinement that interpolate the usual bosonic and fermionic\nlimits. Specifically, we consider two-component mixtures of anyons and use\nthese to eludicate the mixing-demixing properties of both balanced and\nimbalanced systems. Importantly, we demonstrate that the degree of demixing\ndepends sensitively on the external trap in which the particles are confined.\nWe also show how one may in principle probe the statistical parameter of an\nanyonic system by injection a strongly interacting impurity and doing spectral\nor tunneling measurements.\n", "  We report the laser cooling of a single $^{40}\\text{Ca}^+$ ion in a Penning\ntrap to the motional ground state in one dimension. Cooling is performed in the\nstrong binding limit on the 729-nm electric quadrupole $S_{1/2}\\leftrightarrow\nD_{5/2}$ transition, broadened by a quench laser coupling the $D_{5/2}$ and\n$P_{3/2}$ levels. We find the final ground state occupation to be $98\\pm1\\%$.\nWe measure the heating rate of the trap to be very low with\n$\\dot{\\bar{n}}\\approx 0.3\\pm0.2\\textrm{s}^{-1}$ for trap frequencies from\n$150-400\\textrm{kHz}$, consistent with the large ion-electrode distance.\n", "  We present a quantum theory of light based on quantum cellular automata\n(QCA). This approach allows us to have a thorough quantum theory of free\nelectrodynamics encompassing an hypothetical discrete Planck scale. The theory\nis particularly relevant because it provides predictions at the macroscopic\nscale that can be experimentally tested. We show how, in the limit of small\nwave-vector k, the free Maxwell's equations emerge from two Weyl QCAs derived\nfrom informational principles in Ref. [1]. Within this framework the photon is\nintroduced as a composite particle made of a pair of correlated massless\nFermions, and the usual Bosonic statistics is recovered in the low photon\ndensity limit. We derive the main phenomenological features of the theory,\nconsisting in dispersive propagation in vacuum, the occurrence of a small\nlongitudinal polarization, and a saturation effect originated by the Fermionic\nnature of the photon. We then discuss whether these effects can be\nexperimentally tested, and observe that only the dispersive effects are\naccessible with current technology, from observations of arrival times of\npulses originated at cosmological distances.\n", "  We reinterpret the spectral dimension of spacetimes as the scaling of an\neffective self-energy transition amplitude in quantum field theory (QFT), when\nthe system is probed at a given resolution. This picture has four main\nadvantages: (a) it dispenses with the usual interpretation (unsatisfactory in\ncovariant approaches) where, instead of a transition amplitude, one has a\nprobability density solving a nonrelativistic diffusion equation in an abstract\ndiffusion time; (b) it solves the problem of negative probabilities known for\nhigher-order and nonlocal dispersion relations in classical and quantum\ngravity; (c) it clarifies the concept of quantum spectral dimension as opposed\nto the classical one. We then consider a class of logarithmic dispersion\nrelations associated with quantum particles and show that the spectral\ndimension $d_s$ of spacetime as felt by these quantum probes can deviate from\nits classical value, equal to the topological dimension $D$. In particular, in\nthe presence of higher momentum powers it changes with the scale, dropping from\n$D$ in the infrared (IR) to a value $d_s^{\\rm UV}\\leq D$ in the ultraviolet\n(UV). We apply this general result to Stelle theory of renormalizable gravity,\nwhich attains the universal value $d_s^{\\rm UV}=2$ for any dimension $D$.\n", "  The Tom\\'ar\\~aho is an ethnic group of the Paraguayan Chaco who maintained\nclose contact with nature and developed original ways of explaining and\nunderstanding it. This article presents the first results of an\ninterdisciplinary project seeking to provide a detailed analysis of different\nastronomical elements in the imagined sky of the Tom\\'ar\\~aho.\n", "  The recently measured centrality dependence of high energy jets in\nproton-lead collisions at the LHC is investigated. We hypothesize that events\nwith jets of very high energy (a few hundred GeV) are characterized by a\nsuppressed number of soft particles, thus shifting these events into more\nperipheral bins. This naturally results in the suppression (enhancement) of the\nnuclear modification factor, $R_{pA}$, in central (peripheral) collisions. Our\ncalculations suggest that a moderate suppression of the order of $20\\%$, for\n$10^{3}$ GeV jets, can quantitatively reproduce the experimental data. We\nfurther extract the suppression factor as a function of jet energy and test our\nconjecture using available $R_{pA}$ data for various centralities.\n", "  Searching for new resonances and finding out their properties is an essential\npart of any existing or future particle physics experiment. The nature of a new\nresonance is characterized by its spin, charge conjugation, parity, and its\ncouplings with the existing particles of the Standard Model. If a new resonance\nis found in the four lepton final state produced via two intermediate $Z$\nbosons, the resonance could be a new heavy scalar or a $Z'$ boson or even a\nhigher spin particle. In such cases the step by step methodology as enunciated\nin this paper can be followed to determine the spin, parity and the coupling to\ntwo $Z$ bosons of the parent particles, in a fully model-independent way. In\nour approach we show how three uni-angular distributions and few experimentally\nmeasurable observables can conclusively tell us about the spin, parity as well\nas the couplings of the new resonance to two $Z$ bosons. We have performed a\nnumerical analysis to validate our approach and showed how the uniangular\nobservables can be used to disentangle the spin parity as well as coupling of\nthe resonance.\n", "  We study the structure of maps that Lorentz boosts induce on the spin degree\nof freedom of a system consisting of two massive spin-$1/2$ particles. We\nconsider the case where the spin state is described by the Werner state and the\nmomenta are discrete. Transformations on the spins are systematically\ninvestigated in various boost scenarios by calculating the orbit and\nconcurrence of the bipartite spin state with different kinds of product and\nentangled momenta. We confirm the general conclusion that Lorentz boosts cause\nnon-trivial behavior of bipartite spin entanglement. Visualization of the\nevolution of the spin state is shown to be valuable in explaining the pattern\nof concurrence. The idealized model provides a basis of explanation in terms of\nwhich phenomena in systems involving continuous momenta can be understood.\n", "  We propose a class of variational Gaussian wavefunctions to describe\nFr\\\"ohlich polarons at finite momenta. Our wavefunctions give polaron energies\nthat are in excellent agreement with the existing Monte Carlo results for a\nbroad range of interactions. We calculate the effective mass of polarons and\nfind smooth crossover between weak and intermediate impurity-bosons coupling.\nEffective masses that we obtain are considerably larger than those predicted by\nthe mean-field method. A novel prediction based on our variational\nwavefunctions is a special pattern of correlations between host atoms that can\nbe measured in time-of-flight experiments. We discuss atomic mixtures in\nsystems of ultracold atoms in which our results can be tested with current\nexperimental technology.\n", "  Recently quantum walks have been considered as a possible fundamental\ndescription of the dynamics of relativistic quantum fields. Within this\nscenario we derive the analytical solution of the Weyl walk in 2+1 dimensions.\nWe present a discrete path-integral formulation of the Feynman propagator based\non the binary encoding of paths on the lattice. The derivation exploits a\nspecial feature of the Weyl walk, that occurs also in other dimensions, that is\nclosure under multiplication of the set of the walk transition matrices. This\nresult opens the perspective of a similar solution in the 3+1 case.\n", "  In this work, we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelations. This includes broadcasting of quantum entanglement as well as\ncorrelations that go beyond the notion of entanglement. It is quite well known\nfrom the \"No-Broadcasting theorem\" that perfect broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of\npartial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states\nfrom a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general\nrepresentation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a\ncloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery\n(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of\nranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be\npossible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general\ntwo qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go\nbeyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners.\nRemarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such\ncorrelations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines. Taking\ntwo different types Buzek-Hillery quantum cloners (state dependent and state\nindependent) we analytically prove the impossibility of even partial\nbroadcasting of correlation. Lastly, we generalize this impossibility result\nfor any symmetric or asymmetric cloning machines as well. This result brings\nout a fundamental difference between the correlation defined from the\nperspective of entanglement and the correlation measure which claims to go\nbeyond entanglement.\n", "  The competition of magnetic exchange interactions and tunneling underlies\nmany complex quantum phenomena observed in real materials. We study\nnon-equilibrium magnetization dynamics in an extended 2D system by loading\neffective spin-1/2 bosons into a spin-dependent optical lattice, and we use the\nlattice to separately control the resonance conditions for tunneling and\nsuperexchange. After preparing a non-equilibrium anti-ferromagnetically ordered\nstate, we observe relaxation dynamics governed by two well-separated rates,\nwhich scale with the underlying Hamiltonian parameters associated with\nsuperexchange and tunneling. Remarkably, with tunneling off-resonantly\nsuppressed, we are able to observe superexchange dominated dynamics over two\norders of magnitude in magnetic coupling strength, despite the presence of\nvacancies. In this regime, the measured timescales are in agreement with simple\ntheoretical estimates, but the detailed dynamics of this 2D, strongly\ncorrelated, and far-from-equilibrium quantum system remain out of reach of\ncurrent computational techniques.\n", "  We demonstrate that a Weyl point, widely examined in 3D Weyl semimetals and\nsuperfluids, can develop a pair of non-degenerate gapless spheres. Such a\nbouquet of two spheres is characterized by three distinct topological\ninvariants of manifolds with full energy gaps, i.e., the Chern number of a 0D\npoint inside one developed sphere, the winding number of a 1D loop around the\noriginal Weyl point, and the Chern number of a 2D surface enclosing the whole\nbouquet. We show that such structured Weyl points can be realized in the\nsuperfluid quasiparticle spectrum of a 3D degenerate Fermi gas subject to\nspin-orbit couplings and Zeeman fields, which supports Fulde-Ferrell\nsuperfluids as the ground state.\n", "  We demonstrate that a cold, dense sample of 87Rb atoms can exhibit a\nmicron-scale lensing effect, much like that associated with a\nmacroscopically-sized lens. The experiment is carried out in the fashion of\ntraditional z-scan measurements but in much weaker fields and where close\nattention is paid to the detuning dependence of the transmitted light. The\nresults are interpreted using numerical simulations and by modeling the sample\nas a thin lens with a spherical focal length.\n", "  We calculate the radiation noise level associated with the spontaneous\nemission of a coherently driven medium. The significant field-induced\nmodification of relation between the noise power and damping constant in a\nthermal reservoir is obtained. The nonlinear noise exchange between different\natomic frequencies leads to violation of standard relations dictated by the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n", "  Vector modes are spatial modes that have spatially inhomogeneous states of\npolarization, such as, radial and azimuthal polarization. They can produce\nsmaller spot sizes and stronger longitudinal polarization components upon\nfocusing. As a result, they are used for many applications, including optical\ntrapping and nanoscale imaging. In this work, vector modes are used to increase\nthe information capacity of free space optical communication via the method of\noptical communication referred to as mode division multiplexing. A mode\n(de)multiplexer for vector modes based on a liquid crystal technology referred\nto as a q-plate is introduced. As a proof of principle, using the mode\n(de)multiplexer four vector modes each carrying a 20 Gbit/s quadrature phase\nshift keying signal on a single wavelength channel (~1550nm), comprising an\naggregate 80 Gbit/s, were transmitted ~1m over the lab table with <-16.4 dB\n(<2%) mode crosstalk. Bit error rates for all vector modes were measured at the\nforward error correction threshold with power penalties < 3.41dB.\n", "  We propose an efficient scheme for generating photonic NOON states of two\nresonators coupled to a four-level superconducting flux device. This proposal\noperates essentially by employing a technique of a coupler device resonantly\ninteracting with two resonators simultaneously. As a consequence, the\nNOON-state preparation requires only $N+1$ operational steps and thus is much\nfaster when compared with a recent proposal [Q. P. Su et al., Scientific\nReports 4, 3898 (2014)] requiring $2N$ steps of operation. Moreover, due to the\nuse of only two resonators and a device, the experimental setup is much\nsimplified when compared with previous proposals requiring three resonators and\ntwo superconducting qubits/qutrits.\n", "  Since the forward and backward waves are coupled with each other and a\nstanding wave with no net propagation of energy is formed in the photonic\nbandgap, it is a commonsense of basic physics that, any kinds of effects\nassociated with wave propagation including four-wave-mixing (FWM) are thought\nto be impossible. However, we lay great emphasis here on explaining that this\ncommonsense could be broken under specific circumstances. In this article, we\nreport with the first experimental observation of the energy conversion in the\nphotonic bandgap into other channel via FWM. Owing to the phase manipulation by\nfast light effect in the photonic bandgap, we manage to achieve the phase-match\ncondition and thus occurred FWM transfer energy into other channels outside the\nphotonic bandgap efficiently. As one-dimensional photonic crystal, simulations\non fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with and without fast light were conducted\nrespectively, and an enhanced FWM in photonic bandgap of FBG was observed. The\nexperimental result shows great agreement with the analysis.\n", "  A theory for the microscopic structure and the vibrational properties of soft\nsphere glass at finite temperature is presented. With an effective potential,\nderived here, the phase diagram and vibrational properties are worked out\naround the Maxwell critical point at zero temperature $T$ and pressure $p$.\nVariational arguments and effective medium theory identically predict a\nnon-trivial temperature scale $T^*\\sim p^{(2-a)/(1-a)}$ with $a \\approx 0.17$\nsuch that low-energy vibrational properties are hard-sphere like for $T \\gtrsim\nT^*$, and zero-temperature soft-sphere like otherwise. However, due to\ncrossovers in the equation of state relating $T$, $p$, and the packing fraction\n$\\phi$, these two regimes lead to four regions where scaling behaviors differ\nwhen expressed in terms of $T$ and $\\phi$. Scaling predictions are presented\nfor the mean-squared displacement, characteristic frequency, shear modulus, and\ncharacteristic elastic length in all regions of the phase diagram.\n", "  We derive the polarization tensor of graphene at nonzero temperature in\n(2+1)-dimensional space-time. The obtained tensor coincides with the previously\nknown one at all Matsubara frequencies, but, in contrast to it, admits analytic\ncontinuation to the real frequency axis satisfying all physical requirements.\nUsing the obtained representation for the polarization tensor, we develope\nquantum field theoretical description for the reflectivity of graphene. The\nanalytic asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients and\nreflectivities at low and high frequencies are derived for both independent\npolarizations of the electromagnetic field. The dependencies of reflectivities\non the frequency and angle of incidence are investigated. Numerical\ncomputations using the exact expressions for the polarization tensor are\nperformed and application regions for the analytic asymptotic results are\ndetermined.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate dynamic heterogeneities\nand the potential energy landscape of the Gaussian core model (GCM). Despite\nthe nearly Gaussian statistics of particles' displacements, the GCM exhibits\ngiant dynamic heterogeneities close to the dynamic transition temperature. The\ndivergence of the four-point susceptibility is quantitatively well described by\nthe inhomogeneous version of the Mode-Coupling theory. Furthermore, the\npotential energy landscape of the GCM is characterized by a geometric\ntransition and large energy barriers, as expected from the lack of activated,\nhopping dynamics. These observations demonstrate that all major features of\nmean-field dynamic criticality can be observed in a physically sound,\nthree-dimensional model.\n", "  Carbon-dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor to anthropogenic global warming,\nand the timing of its peak concentration in the atmosphere is likely to govern\nthe timing of maximum radiative forcing. It is well-known that dynamics of\natmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate\nthe solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four\ntime-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in\nCO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration\npeak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of\nchange of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio\nis large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and\nconcentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of\nthis ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2\nconcentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,\ncombined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay\nbetween peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with\nwhich decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak\nconcentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions\nthroughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is\nnot examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the\nconcentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of\natmospheric CO2, and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response\nfunction of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long\ntime-constant respectively. Reducing uncertainties in these parameters can\nreduce uncertainty in forecasts of the radiative forcing peak.\n", "  We introduce a mechanism to stabilize spatiotemporal solitons in Kerr\nnonlinear media, based on the dispersion of linear coupling between the field\ncomponents forming the soliton states. Specifically, we consider solitons in a\ntwo-core guiding structure with inter-core coupling dispersion (CD). We show\nthat CD profoundly affects properties of the solitons, causing the complete\nstabilization of the otherwise highly unstable spatiotemporal solitons in Kerr\nmedia with focusing nonlinearity. We also find that the presence of CD\nstimulates the formation of bound states, which however are unstable.\n", "  With the dielectric function computed from AdS/CFT correspondence, we studied\nthe wake potential induced by a fast moving charge in strong coupling plasma,\nand compared it with the weak coupling wake potential for different particle\nvelocities as $v=0.55c$ and $v=0.99c$. The most prominent difference between\nstrong and weak wake potential is that when $v=0.99c$ the remarkable\noscillation due to Cerenkov-like radiation and Mach cone in weak coupling\ndisappears in strong coupling, which implies that the plasmon mode with phase\nvelocity lower than the speed of light dose not exist in strong coupling\nplasma.\n", "  We find diffraction-free beams for graphene and MoS$_2$-type honeycomb\noptical lattices. The resulting composite solutions have the form of\nmulti-vortices, with spinor topological charges ($n$, $n\\pm1$). Exact solutions\nfor the spinor components are obtained in the Dirac limit. The effects of the\nvalley degree of freedom and the mass are analyzed. Passing through the\nvan-Hove singularity the topological structure of the solutions is modified.\nExactly at the singularity the diffraction-free beams take the form of strongly\nlocalized one-dimensional stripes.\n", "  A recent article by Sassa et al. [Phys. Rev. B 91, 045114 (2015)] reports on\na soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission study of MgB2. The analysis and/or\npresentation of the collected data and the corresponding calculations appear to\nbe partially inconsistent. The aim of this comment is to provide a guide to\nthese inconsistencies and to discuss their influence on the presented\nconclusions.\n", "  Optical cavities containing a negative dispersion medium have been proposed\nas a means of improving the sensitivity of laser interferometric gravitational\nwave (GW) detectors through the creation of white light signal recycling\ncavities. Here we classically demonstrate that negative dispersion can be\nrealized using an optomechanical cavity pumped by a blue detuned doublet. We\nused an 85mm cavity with an intra-cavity silicon nitride membrane. Tunable\nnegative dispersion is demonstrated, with a phase derivative $d\\varphi/df$ from\n$-0.14$ Deg$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1}$ to $-4.2\\times10^{-3}$ Deg$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1}$.\n", "  There has been much debate about the origin of the diffuse $\\gamma$--ray\nbackground in the MeV range. At lower energies, AGNs and Seyfert galaxies can\nexplain the background, but not above $\\simeq$0.3 MeV. Beyond $\\sim$10 MeV\nblazars appear to account for the flux observed. That leaves an unexplained gap\nfor which different candidates have been proposed, including annihilations of\nWIMPS. One candidate are Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Early studies concluded\nthat they were able to account for the $\\gamma$--ray background in the gap,\nwhile later work attributed a significantly lower contribution to them.\n  All those estimates were based on SN Ia explosion models which did not\nreflect the full 3D hydrodynamics of SNe Ia explosions. In addition, new\nmeasurements obtained since 2010 have provided new, direct estimates of high-z\nSNe Ia rates beyond $z\\sim$2. We take into account these new advances to see\nthe predicted contribution to the gamma--ray background.\n  We use here a wide variety of explosion models and a plethora of new\nmeasurements of SNe Ia rates. SNe Ia still fall short of the observed\nbackground. Only for a fit, which would imply $\\sim$150\\% systematic error in\ndetecting SNe Ia events, do the theoretical predictions approach the observed\nfluxes. This fit is, however, at odds at the highest redshifts with recent SN\nIa rates estimates. Other astrophysical sources such as FSRQs do match the\nobserved flux levels in the MeV regime, while SNe Ia make up to 30--50\\% of the\nobserved flux.\n", "  A new type of peculiarity -- a splitting or asymmetry of strong absorption\nlines, is found in the optical spectra of selected post-AGB stars with C-rich\ncircumstellar envelopes. The effect is maximal in BaII lines whose profile is\nsplit into two-three components. The particular components of the split\nabsorption lines are shown to be formed in a structured circumstellar envelope,\nsuggesting an efficient dredge-up of the heavy metals produced during the\npreceding evolution of this star into the envelope. We suspect that the\nsplitting (or asymmetry) of the profiles of strongest absorptions with low\nexcitation potential of the low level can be associated with the kinematic and\nchemical properties of the circumstellar environment and with type of its\nmorphology.\n", "  We present the first fundamental simulation method for the determination of\ncrater morphology due to femtosecond-pulse laser damage. To this end we have\nadapted the particle-in-cell (PIC) method commonly used in plasma physics for\nuse in the study of laser damage, and developed the first implementation of a\npair-potential for PIC codes. We find that the PIC method is a complementary\napproach to modeling laser damage, bridging the gap between fully ab-initio\nmolecular dynamics approaches and empirical models. We demonstrate our method\nby modeling a femtosecond-pulse laser incident on a flat copper slab, for a\nrange of intensities.\n", "  A photonic jet (terajet at THz frequencies) commonly denotes a specific\nspatially localized region in the near-field at the front side of a dielectric\nparticle with diameter comparable with wavelength illuminated with a plane wave\nfrom its backside (i.e., the jet emerges from the shadow surface of a\ndielectric particle). In this paper the formation of photonic is demonstrated\nusing the recently proposed 3D dielectric cuboids working in reflection mode\nwhen the specific spatially localized region is localized towards the direction\nof incidence wavefront. The results of simulations based on Finite Integration\nTechnique are discussed. All dimensions are given in wavelength units so that\nall results can be scaled any frequency of interest including optical\nfrequencies, simplifying the fabrication process compared with spherical\ndielectrics. The results here presented may be of interest for novel\napplications including microscopy techniques and sensors.\n", "  Observations of an unprecedented quality made by ALMA on the Red Rectangle of\nCO(3-2) and CO(6-5) emissions are analysed jointly with the aim of obtaining as\nsimple as possible a description of the gas morphology and kinematics. Evidence\nis found for polar conical outflows and for a broad equatorial torus in\nrotation and expansion. Simple models of both are proposed. Comparing CO(6-5)\nand CO(3-2) emissions provides evidence for a strong temperature enhancement\nover the polar outflows. Continuum emission (dust) is seen to be enhanced in\nthe equatorial region. Observed asymmetries are briefly discussed.\n", "  On September, 15th, 2007, in the community of Carancas (Puno, Peru) a stony\nmeteorite formed a crater explosive type with a mean diameter of 13.5 m. some\nsamples meteorite fragments were collected. The petrologic analysis performed\ncorresponds to a meteorite ordinary chondrite H 4-5. In this paper we have\nanalyzed the magnetic properties of a meteorite fragment with a proton\nmagnetometer. Also in order to have a complete characterization of the Carancas\nmeteorite and its crater, from several papers, articles and reports, we have\nmade a compilation of the most important characteristics and properties of this\nmeteorite.\n", "  We utilize caustic theory in ${\\cal PT}-$symmetric lattices to design\nfocusing and curved beam dynamics. We show that the gain and loss parameter in\nthese systems provides an addition degree of freedom which allows for the\ndesign of the same caustics trajectories with different intensity distribution\nin the individual waveguides. Moreover we can create aberration-free focal\npoints at any paraxial distance $z_f$, with anomalously large focal intensity.\n", "  An iterface structure between turbulence and laminar flow is investigated in\ntwo-dimensional channel flow. This spatially localized structure not only\nsustains itself, but also converts laminar state into turbulence actively. In\nother words, this coherent structure has a functionality to generate\ninhomogeneity by its inner dynamics. The dynamics of this functional coherent\nstructure is isolated using the filtered simulation, and a physical perspective\nof its dynamics is summarized in a phenomenological model called an\n\"ejection-jet\" cycle, which includes multiscale interaction process.\n", "  The Moon apparently seems to have not appreciable effect in the geomagnetic\nmonthly period, but Keil (1839), Sabine (1853), Broun (1874) and many others\nhave shown a lunisolar daily variation. It is known that solar (S) and lunar\n(L) variation have seasonal variations. Seasonal changes of S, particularly on\nquiet days, have been studied in greater detail than the seasonal changes for\nL. The purpose of this paper is to describe in more detail the effect of the\nvariation of L in the geomagnetic equator, in the absence of strong\nperturbations selecting conveniently geomagnetic data of Huancayo observatory\n(hourly mean) from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009, period which is longer\nin range of minimum solar activity of the last 160 years (end of solar cycle 23\nand start of solar cycle 24). The spectral analysis by wavelet and Fourier\nallows us to identify the main contribution of S diurnal and semidiurnal\nvariations and its sidebands, besides the effect of the seasonal variation. In\norder to observe the variation L is subtracted the variation S together with\nits sidebands, allowing observed by Fourier spectral analysis and wavelet as\nthe main contributions to the variation L, similar effect were described by\nChapman and Miller (1940).\n", "  Assessing the role of interference in natural and artificial quantum\ndyanamical processes is a crucial task in quantum information theory. To this\naim, an appopriate formalism is provided by the decoherent histories framework.\nWhile this approach has been deeply explored from different theoretical\nperspectives, it still lacks of a comprehensive set of tools able to concisely\nquantify the amount of coherence developed by a given dynamics. In this paper\nwe introduce and test different measures of the (average) coherence present in\ndissipative (Markovian) quantum evolutions, at various time scales and for\ndifferent levels of environmentally induced decoherence. In order to show the\neffectiveness of the introduced tools, we apply them to a paradigmatic quantum\nprocess where the role of coherence is being hotly debated: exciton transport\nin photosynthetic complexes. To spot out the essential features that may\ndetermine the performance of the transport we focus on a relevant trimeric\nsubunit of the FMO complex and we use a simplified (Haken-Strobl) model for the\nsystem-bath interaction. Our analysis illustrates how the high efficiency of\nenvironmentally assisted transport can be traced back to a quantum recoil\navoiding effect on the exciton dynamics, that preserves and sustains the\nbenefits of the initial fast quantum delocalization of the exciton over the\nnetwork. Indeed, for intermediate levels of decoherence, the bath is seen to\nselectively kill the negative interference between different exciton pathways,\nwhile retaining the initial positive one. The concepts and tools here developed\nshow how the decoherent histories approach can be used to quantify the relation\nbetween coherence and efficiency in quantum dynamical processes.\n", "  We present Keck-I MOSFIRE spectroscopy in the Y and H bands of GDN-8231, a\nmassive, compact, star-forming galaxy (SFG) at a redshift $z\\sim1.7$. Its\nspectrum reveals both H$_{\\alpha}$ and [NII] emission lines and strong Balmer\nabsorption lines. The H$_{\\alpha}$ and Spitzer MIPS 24 $\\mu$m fluxes are both\nweak, thus indicating a low star formation rate of SFR $\\lesssim5-10$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This, added to a relatively young age of $\\sim700$ Myr\nmeasured from the absorption lines, provides the first direct evidence for a\ndistant galaxy being caught in the act of rapidly shutting down its star\nformation. Such quenching allows GDN-8231 to become a compact, quiescent\ngalaxy, similar to 3 other galaxies in our sample, by $z\\sim1.5$. Moreover, the\ncolor profile of GDN-8231 shows a bluer center, consistent with the predictions\nof recent simulations for an early phase of inside-out quenching. Its\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion for the gas, $\\sigma^{\\rm{gas}}_{\\!_{\\rm\nLOS}}=127\\pm32$ km s$^{-1}$, is nearly 40% smaller than that of its stars,\n$\\sigma^{\\star}_{\\!_{\\rm LOS}}=215\\pm35$ km s$^{-1}$. High-resolution\nhydro-simulations of galaxies explain such apparently colder gas kinematics of\nup to a factor of $\\sim1.5$ with rotating disks being viewed at different\ninclinations and/or centrally concentrated star-forming regions. A clear\nprediction is that their compact, quiescent descendants preserve some remnant\nrotation from their star-forming progenitors.\n", "  Distributions of eigenmodes are widely concerned in both bounded and open\nsystems. In the realm of chaos, counting resonances can characterize the\nunderlying dynamics (regular vs. chaotic), and is often instrumental to\nidentify classical-to-quantum correspondence. Here, we study, both\ntheoretically and experimentally, the statistics of chaotic resonances in an\noptical microcavity with a mixed phase space of both regular and chaotic\ndynamics. Information on the number of chaotic modes is extracted by counting\nregular modes, which couple to the former via dynamical tunneling. The\nexperimental data are in agreement with a known semiclassical prediction for\nthe dependence of the number of chaotic resonances on the number of open\nchannels, while they deviate significantly from a purely\nrandom-matrix-theory-based treatment, in general. We ascribe this result to the\nballistic decay of the rays, which occurs within Ehrenfest time, and\nimportantly, within the timescale of transient chaos. The present approach may\nprovide a general tool for the statistical analysis of chaotic resonances in\nopen systems.\n", "  We develop a new dispersion minimizing compact finite difference scheme for\nthe Helmholtz equation in 2 and 3 dimensions. The scheme is based on a newly\ndeveloped ray theory for difference equations. A discrete Helmholtz operator\nand a discrete operator to be applied to the source and the wavefields are\nconstructed. Their coefficients are piecewise polynomial functions of $hk$,\nchosen such that phase and amplitude errors are minimal. The phase errors of\nthe scheme are very small, approximately as small as those of the 2-D\nquasi-stabilized FEM method and substantially smaller than those of\nalternatives in 3-D, assuming the same number of gridpoints per wavelength is\nused. In numerical experiments, accurate solutions are obtained in constant and\nsmoothly varying media using meshes with only five to six points per wavelength\nand wave propagation over hundreds of wavelengths. When used as a coarse level\ndiscretization in a multigrid method the scheme can even be used with downto\nthree points per wavelength. Tests on 3-D examples with up to $10^8$ degrees of\nfreedom show that with a recently developed hybrid solver, the use of coarser\nmeshes can lead to corresponding savings in computation time, resulting in good\nsimulation times compared to the literature.\n", "  Subwavelength plasmonic waveguides show the unique ability of strongly\nlocalizing (down to the nanoscale) and guiding light. These structures are\nintrinsically two-way optical communication channels, providing two opposite\nlight propagation directions. As a consequence, when light is coupled to these\nplanar integrated devices directly from the top (or bottom) surface using\nstrongly focused beams, it is equally shared into the two opposite propagation\ndirections. Here, we show that symmetry can be broken by using incident\ncircularly polarized light, on the basis of a spin-orbital angular momentum\ntransfer directly within waveguide bends. We predict that up to 94 \\% of the\nincoupled light is directed into a single propagation channel of a gap plasmon\nwaveguide. Unidirectional propagation of strongly localized optical energy, far\nbeyond the diffraction limit, becomes switchable by polarization, with no need\nof intermediate nano-antennas/scatterers as light directors. This study may\nopen new perspectives in a large panel of scientific domains, such as\nnanophotonic circuitry, routing and sorting, optical nanosensing, nano-optical\ntrapping and manipulation.\n", "  High-energy elastic diffraction of nucleons is considered in the framework of\nthe simplest Regge-eikonal approximation. It is demonstrated explicitly that\nthe effective transverse radius of nucleon in this nonperturbative regime is\n$\\sim 0.2\\div 0.3$ fm and much less than the transverse size of the diffractive\ninteraction region.\n", "  The discrepancy between two recently reported experimental values of the\ngravitational constant G was analysed within a differential version of MOND\ntheory. In contrast to the most commonly accepted interpretation of MOND\ntheory, it is assumed that only the relative gravitational acceleration between\na test mass and an array of source masses determines the magnitude of post\nNewtonian corrections at small magnitudes of acceleration. The analysis was\napplied to one of the most recent Cavendish-type gravitational force\nexperiments, which showed a significant deviation of the measured gravitational\nconstant from the current CODATA value. A remarkable agreement between the\nobserved G discrepancy and galaxy rotation curves was revealed by a consistent\nextrapolation within the framework of this model. The differential approach\nsuggests that gravity-induced alterations of the space-time-curvature may\ndefine the magnitude of corrections to Newton's law.\n", "  A suite of relational notions of shape are presented at the level of\nconfiguration space geometry, with corresponding new theories of shape\nmechanics and shape statistics. These further generalize two quite well known\nexamples: --1) Kendall's (metric) shape space with his shape statistics and\nBarbour's mechanics thereupon. 0) Leibnizian relational space alias metric\nscale-and-shape space to which corresponds Barbour-Bertotti mechanics. This\npaper's new theories include, using the invariant and group namings, 1) $Angle$\nalias $conformal$ $shape$ $mechanics$. 2) $Area ratio$ alias $affine$ $shape$\n$mechanics$. 3) $ Area$ alias $affine$ $scale$-$and$-$shape$ $mechanics$. 1) to\n3) rest respectively on angle space, area-ratio space, and area space\nconfiguration spaces. Probability and statistics applications are also pointed\nto in outline.\n  4) Various supersymmetric counterparts of -1) to 3) are considered. Since\nsupergravity differs considerably from GR-based conceptions of Background\nIndependence, some of the new supersymmetric shape mechanics are compared with\nboth. These reveal compatibility between supersymmetry and GR-based conceptions\nof Background Independence, at least within these simpler model arenas.\n", "  Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest\nnuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the\nfirst seconds of cosmic time. We briefly overview the essentials of this\nphysics, and present new calculations of light element abundances through li6\nand li7, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in\nthe neutron lifetime. We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon\ndensity and of the number of neutrino flavors, N_nu. We review recent\ndevelopments in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium\ncontent, and the effective number of degrees of freedom, n_eff. These\nmeasurements allow for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data\nalone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our\nBBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light\nelements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the\nprimordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations\nare now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are\nconsistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H\nnow provides a tight measurement of N_nu when combined with the CMB baryon\ndensity, and provides a 2sigma upper limit N_nu < 3.2. The new precision of the\nCMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest\nsource of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore\nrely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he4, li7\npredictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new\nphysics.\n", "  In a recent work of ours [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 073601 (2014)], we\ngeneralized the Power-Zineau-Woolley gauge to describe the electrodynamics of\natoms in an arbitrary confined geometry. Here we complement the theory by\nproposing a tractable form of the polarization field to represent atomic\nmaterial with well-defined intra-atomic potential. The direct electrostatic\ndipole-dipole interaction between the atoms is canceled. This theory yields a\nsuitable framework to determine limitations on the light-matter coupling in\nquantum optical models with discernible atoms. We find that the superradiant\ncriticality is at the border of covalent molecule formation and\ncrystallization.\n", "  An all optical soliton diode (AOSD) is proposed based on a sandwich nonlinear\nBragg-grating structure: a linearly chirped Bragg-grating linked to a uniform\nBragg-grating and again to a chirped Bragg-grating. The nonreciprocity is\nachieved by introducing two spatially asymmetric chirped Bragg-gratings with\noptical nonlinearity. High transmission ratio up to 150 is obtained when\nlaunching a picosecond Gaussian pulse into the setting. We find that such\npulses in a form of solitons propagate at a rather small velocity ($<0.03c$)\nwhen pulse wavelength is selected in the vicinity of photonic bandgap.\n", "  We demonstrate that an inverse Monte Carlo approach allows to reconstruct\neffective interaction potentials from real-space images. The method is\nexemplified on monomolecular ethanol-water films imaged with scanning force\nmicroscopy (SFM), which provides the spatial distribution of the molecules.\nDirect Monte Carlo simulations with the reconstructed potential allow for\nobtaining characteristics of the system which are unavailable in the\nexperiment, such as the heat capacity of the monomolecularly thin film, and for\na prediction of the critical temperature of the demixing transition.\n", "  We compare estimates of the speed and width of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\nin several catalogs for the CMEs associated with ~200 solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events in 2006-2013 that included 25 MeV protons. The catalogs used are:\nCDAW, CACTUS, SEEDS and CORIMP, all derived from observations by the LASCO\ncoronagraphs on the SOHO spacecraft, the CACTUS catalog derived from the COR2\ncoronagraphs on the STEREO-A and -B spacecraft, and the DONKI catalog, which\nuses observations from SOHO and the STEREO spacecraft. We illustrate how, for\nthis set of events, CME parameters can differ considerably in each catalog. The\nwell-known correlation between CME speed and proton event intensity is shown to\nbe similar for most catalogs, but this is largely because it is determined by a\nfew large particle events associated with fast CMEs, and small events\nassociated with slow CMEs. Intermediate particle events \"shuffle\" in position\nwhen speeds from different catalogs are used. Quadrature spacecraft CME speeds\ndo not improve the correlation. CME widths also vary widely between catalogs,\nand are influenced by plane of the sky projection and how the width is inferred\nfrom the coronagraph images. The high degree of association (~50%) between the\n25 MeV proton events and \"full halo\" (360 deg.-width) CMEs as defined in the\nCDAW catalog is removed when other catalogs are considered. Using CME\nparameters from the quadrature spacecraft, the SEP intensity is correlated with\nCME width, which is also correlated with CME speed.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of dust grains with various sizes in\nprotoplanetary disk winds driven by magnetorotational turbulence, by simulating\nthe time evolution of the dust grain distribution in the vertical direction.\nSmall dust grains, which are well coupled to the gas, are dragged upward with\nthe upflowing gas, while large grains remain near the midplane of a disk.\nIntermediate--size grains float at several scale heights from the midplane in\ntime-averated force balance between the downward gravity and the upward gas\ndrag. For the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 AU, dust grains with size of 20 --\n40 $\\mu m$ float at 5-10 scale heights from the midplane. Considering the\ndependence on the distance from the central star, smaller-size grains remain\nonly in an outer region of the disk, while larger-size grains are distributed\nin a broader region. We also discuss the implication of our result to the\nobservation of dusty material around young stellar objects.\n", "  We suggest and demonstrate a scheme to reconstruct the symmetric two-mode\nsqueezed thermal states of spectral sideband modes from an optical parametric\noscillator. The method is based on a single homodyne detector and active\nstabilization of the cavity. The measurement scheme have been successfully\ntested on different two-mode squeezed thermal states, ranging from uncorrelated\ncoherent states to entangled states.\n", "  We have carried out temperature-dependent inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements of YMnO3 over the temperature range 50 - 1303 K, covering both the\nantiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition (70 K), as well as the\nferroelectric to paraelectric transition (1258 K). Measurements are accompanied\nby first principles calculations of phonon spectra for the sake of\ninterpretation and analysis of the measured phonon spectra in the room\ntemperature ferroelectric (P63cm) and high temperature paraelectric (P63/mmc)\nhexagonal phases of YMnO3. The comparison of the experimental and\nfirst-principles calculated phonon spectra highlight unambiguously a\nspin-phonon coupling character in YMnO3. This is further supported by the\npronounced differences in the magnetic and non-magnetic phonon calculations.\nThe calculated atomistic partial phonon contributions of the Y and Mn atoms are\nnot affected by inclusion of magnetic interactions, whereas the dynamical\ncontribution of the O atoms is found tochange. This highlights the role of the\nsuper-exchange interactions between the magnetic Mn cations, mediated by O\nbridges. Phonon dispersion relations have also been calculated, in the entire\nBrillouin zone, for both the hexagonal phases. In the high-temperature phase,\nunstable phonon mode at the K point is highlighted. The displacement pattern at\nthe K-point indicates that the freezing of this mode along with the stable mode\nat the {\\Gamma}-point may lead to a stabilization of the low-temperature\n(P63cm) phase, and inducing ferroelectricity. Further, we have also estimated\nthe mode Gr\\\"uneisen parameter and volume thermal expansion behavior. The\nlatter is found to agree with the available experimental data.\n", "  Motivated by recent numerical discovery of a gapped spin liquid phase in\nspin-$1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, we classify\nsymmetric $Z_2$ spin liquids on triangular lattice in the Abrikosov-fermion\nrepresentation. We find 20 phases with distinct spinon symmetry quantum\nnumbers, 8 of which have their counterparts in the Schwinger-boson\nrepresentation. Among them we identify 2 promising candidates (#1 and #20),\nwhich can realize a gapped $Z_2$ spin liquid with up to next nearest neighbor\nmean-field amplitudes. We analyze their neighboring magnetic orders and valence\nbond solid patterns, and find one state (#20) that is connected to 120-degree\nNeel order by a continuous quantum phase transition. We also identify gapped\nnematic $Z_2$ spin liquids in the neighborhood of the symmetric states and find\n3 promising candidates (#1, #6 and #20).\n", "  We report on the storage of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light via the\nphenomenon of Coherent Population Oscillation (CPO) in cold cesium atoms. The\nexperiment is performed using a delayed four wave mixing configuration where\nthe transverse optical information of a probe field carrying OAM associated\nwith its azimuthal phase dependence is stored in the CPO of Zeeman sublevels of\nthe hyperfine transition $F=3\\rightarrow F^{\\prime}=2$ of cesium $D_{2}$ line.\nWe also demonstrate experimentally the simultaneous storage and retrieval of\ndifferent OAM states propagating along different directions in space, leading\nto algebric operations with OAM and therefore opening the possibility of\nmultiplexing OAM states.\n", "  We propose new large field inflation scenarios built on the framework of\nF-term axion monodromy. Our setup is based on string compactifications where\nD-branes create potentials for closed string axions via F-terms. Because the\nsource of the axion potential is different from the standard sources of moduli\nstabilisation, it is possible to lower the inflaton mass as compared to other\nmassive scalars. We discuss a particular class of models based on type IIA flux\ncompactifications with D6-branes. In the small field regime they describe\nsupergravity models of quadratic chaotic inflation with a stabiliser field. In\nthe large field regime the inflaton potential displays a flattening effect due\nto Planck suppressed corrections, allowing to easily fit the cosmological\nparameters of the model within current experimental bounds.\n", "  In this work we use the framework of effective field theory to couple\nEinstein's gravity to scalar electrodynamics and determine the renormalization\nof the model through the study of physical processes below Planck scale, a\nrealm where quantum mechanics and general relativity are perfectly compatible.\nWe consider the effective field theory up to dimension six operators,\ncorresponding to processes involving one graviton exchange. Studying the\nrenormalization group functions we see that the beta function of the electric\ncharge is positive and possesses no contribution coming from gravitational\ninteraction. Our result indicates that gravitational corrections do not alter\nthe running behavior of the gauge coupling constants, even if massive particles\nare present.\n", "  The separation of the faint cosmological background signal from bright\nastrophysical foregrounds remains one of the most daunting challenges of\nmapping the high-redshift intergalactic medium with the redshifted 21 cm line\nof neutral hydrogen. Advances in mapping and modeling of diffuse and point\nsource foregrounds have improved subtraction accuracy, but no subtraction\nscheme is perfect. Precisely quantifying the errors and error correlations due\nto missubtracted foregrounds allows for both the rigorous analysis of the 21 cm\npower spectrum and for the maximal isolation of the \"EoR window\" from\nforeground contamination. We present a method to infer the covariance of\nforeground residuals from the data itself in contrast to previous attempts at a\npriori modeling. We demonstrate our method by setting limits on the power\nspectrum using a 3 h integration from the 128-tile Murchison Widefield Array.\nObserving between 167 and 198 MHz, we find at 95% confidence a best limit of\nDelta^2(k) < 3.7 x 10^4 mK^2 at comoving scale k = 0.18 hMpc^-1 and at z = 6.8,\nconsistent with existing limits.\n", "  We analyze archival Ly$\\alpha$ spectra of 12 \"Green Pea\" galaxies observed\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope, model their Ly$\\alpha$ profiles with radiative\ntransfer models, and explore the dependence of Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction on\nvarious properties. Green Pea galaxies are nearby compact starburst galaxies\nwith [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 equivalent widths of hundreds of \\AA. All 12 Green Pea\ngalaxies in our sample show Ly$\\alpha$ lines in emission, with a Ly$\\alpha$\nequivalent width distribution similar to high redshift Ly$\\alpha$ emitters.\nCombining the optical and UV spectra of Green Pea galaxies, we estimate their\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fractions and find correlations between Ly$\\alpha$ escape\nfraction and kinematic features of Ly$\\alpha$ profiles. The escape fraction of\nLy$\\alpha$ in these galaxies ranges from 1.4% to 67%. We also find that the\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fraction depends strongly on metallicity and moderately on\ndust extinction. We compare their high-quality Ly$\\alpha$ profiles with single\nHI shell radiative transfer models and find that the Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction\nanti-correlates with the derived HI column densities. Single shell models fit\nmost Ly$\\alpha$ profiles well, but not the ones with highest escape fractions\nof Ly$\\alpha$. Our results suggest that low HI column density and low\nmetallicity are essential for Ly$\\alpha$ escape, and make a galaxy a Ly$\\alpha$\nemitter.\n", "  We carry out a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the\npopulation distributions in the ground and excited states of tunnel ionized N2\nmolecules at various driver wavelengths in the near- and mid-infrared range.\nOur results reveal that efficient couplings (i.e., population exchanges)\nbetween the ground state and the excited states occur in strong laser fields.\nThe couplings result in the population inversion between the ground and the\nexcited states at the wavelengths near 800 nm, which is verified by our\nexperiment by observing the amplification of a seed at ~391 nm. The result\nprovides insight into the mechanism of free-space nitrogen ion lasers generated\nin remote air with strong femtosecond laser pulses.\n", "  We consider the real time dynamics of an initially localized distinguishable\nimpurity injected into the ground state of the Lieb-Liniger model. Focusing on\nthe case where integrability is preserved, we numerically compute the time\nevolution of the impurity density operator in regimes far from analytically\ntractable limits. We find that the injected impurity undergoes a stuttering\nmotion as it moves and expands. For an initially stationary impurity, the\ninteraction-driven formation of a quasibound state with a hole in the\nbackground gas leads to arrested expansion -- a period of quasistationary\nbehavior. When the impurity is injected with a finite center of mass momentum,\nthe impurity moves through the background gas in a snaking manner, arising from\na quantum Newton's cradle-like scenario where momentum is exchanged\nback-and-forth between the impurity and the background gas.\n", "  Many microorganisms swim in a highly heterogeneous environment with obstacles\nsuch as fibers or polymers. To better understand how this environment affects\nmicroorganism swimming, we study propulsion of a cylinder or filament in a\nfluid with a sparse, stationary network of obstructions modeled by the Brinkman\nequation. The mathematical analysis of swimming speeds is investigated by\nstudying an infinite-length cylinder propagating lateral or spiral displacement\nwaves. For fixed bending kinematics, we find that swimming speeds are enhanced\ndue to the added resistance from the fibers. In addition, we examine the work\nand the torque exerted on the cylinder in relation to the resistance. The\nsolutions for the torque, swimming speed, and work of an infinite-length\ncylinder in a Stokesian fluid are recovered as the resistance is reduced to\nzero. Finally, we compare the asymptotic solutions with the numerical results\nobtained from the Method of Regularized Brinkmanlets. The swimming speed of a\nfinite-length filament decreases as its length decreases and planar bending\ninduces an angular velocity that increases linearly with added resistance. The\ncomparisons between the asymptotic analysis and computation give insight on the\neffect of the length of the filament, the permeability, and the thickness of\nthe cylinder in terms of the overall performance of planar and helical swimmers\n", "  High voltage breakdown in liquid argon is an important concern in the design\nof liquid argon time projection chambers, which are often used as neutrino and\ndark matter detectors. We have made systematic measurements of breakdown\nvoltages in liquid argon along insulators surrounding negative rod electrodes\nwhere the breakdown is initiated at the anode. The measurements were performed\nin an open cryostat filled with commercial grade liquid argon exposed to air,\nand not the ultra-pure argon required for electron drift. While not addressing\nall high voltage concerns in liquid argon, these measurements have direct\nrelevance to the design of high voltage feedthroughs especially for averting\nthe common problem of flash-over breakdown. The purpose of these tests is to\nunderstand the effects of materials, of breakdown path length, and of surface\ntopology for this geometry and setup. We have found that the only\nmaterial-specific effects are those due to their permittivity. We have found\nthat the breakdown voltage has no dependence on the length of the exposed\ninsulator. A model for the breakdown mechanism is presented that can help\ninform future designs.\n", "  LHC searches for fermionic top partners $T$ focus on three decay topologies:\n$T\\to bW$, $T\\to tZ$, and $T\\to th$. However, top partners may carry new\nconserved quantum numbers that forbid these decays. The simplest possibility is\na conserved parity, under which the top partner is odd and all SM states are\neven. In this case, decays of top partners may involve new particle-odd\nscalars, leading to signal topologies more commonly associated with\nsupersymmetry, either with or without R-parity conservation. We study a\nsimplified model in which this possibility is realized, and estimate the bounds\non the top partner mass in this model implied by LHC searches for\nsupersymmetry. We find that the bounds can be significantly weaker than in the\nconventional top partner decay scenario. For example, if the new parity is\nexact, a 500 GeV top partner is allowed as long as the lightest parity-odd\nscalar mass is between 325 and 500 GeV. The lower allowed top partner mass\nreduces the need for fine-tuning in the Higgs mass parameter, compared to the\nconventional decay scenario. We also present an explicit model, the Oddest\nLittle Higgs, which exhibits this phenomenology.\n", "  The effect of sintering temperatures (Ts) on the structural and magnetic\nproperties of Ni0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 (NZFO) ferrites synthesized by conventional\ndouble sintering method has been reported. The samples are sintered at 1200,\n1250 and 1300 {\\deg}C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the\nformation of a single phase cubic spinel structure of the sample. The magnetic\nparameters such as saturation magnetization, Ms; coercive field, Hc; remanent\nmagnetization, Mr and Bohr magneton, {\\mu}B are determined and well compared\nwith reported values. The obtained values are found to be 71.94 emu/gm and 1.2\nOe for Ms and Hc, respectively at Ts=1300 oC. Curie temperature (Tc) at various\nTs has also been calculated. It is noteworthy to note that the sample with a\nvery low Hc could be used in transformer core and inductor applications.\n", "  The Born-Oppenheimer electronic wavefunction $\\Phi_R^{BO}(r)$ picks up a\ntopological phase factor $\\pm 1$, a special case of Berry phase, when it is\ntransported around a conical intersection of two adiabatic potential energy\nsurfaces in $R$-space. We show that this topological quantity reverts to a\ngeometric quantity $e^{i\\gamma}$ if the geometric phase $\\gamma = \\oint\n\\mathrm{Im} \\langle \\Phi_R |\\nabla_{\\mu} \\Phi_R\\rangle \\cdot d\\mathbf{R}_{\\mu}$\nis evaluated with the conditional electronic wavefunction $\\Phi_R(r)$ from the\nexact electron-nuclear factorization $\\Phi_R(r)\\chi(R)$ instead of the\nadiabatic function $\\Phi_R^{BO}(r)$. A model of a pseudorotating molecule, also\napplicable to dynamical Jahn-Teller ions in bulk crystals, provides the first\nexamples of induced vector potentials and molecular geometric phase from the\nexact factorization. The induced vector potential gives a contribution to the\ncirculating nuclear current which cannot be removed by a gauge transformation.\nThe exact potential energy surface is calculated and found to contain a term\ndepending on the Fubini-Study metric for the conditional electronic\nwavefunction.\n", "  This paper will discuss a new method of signal read-out from photon detectors\nin ultra-large, underground liquid argon time projection chambers. In this\ndesign, the signal from the light collection system is coupled via capacitive\nplates to the TPC wire-planes. This signal is then read out using the same\ncabling and electronics as the charge information. This greatly benefits light\ncollection: it eliminates the need for an independent readout, substantially\nreducing cost; It reduces the number of cables in the vapor region of the TPC\nthat can produce impurities; And it cuts down on the number of feed-throughs in\nthe cryostat wall that can cause heat-leaks and potential points of failure. We\npresent experimental results that demonstrate the sensitivity of a LArTPC wire\nplane to photon detector signals. We also simulate the effect of a 1 $\\mu$s\nshaping time and a 2 MHz sampling rate on these signals in the presence of\nnoise, and find that a single photoelectron timing resolution of $\\sim$30 ns\ncan be achieved.\n", "  We investigated the individual properties of various polyion-coated bubbles\nwith a mean diameter ranging from 300 to 500 nm. Dark field microscopy allows\none to track the individual particles of the submicron bubbles (SBs)\nencapsulated by the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of cationic and anionic\npolyelectrolytes (PEs). Our focus is on the two-step charge reversals of PE-SB\ncomplexes: the first is a reversal from negatively charged bare SBs with no PEs\nadded to positive SBs encapsulated by polycations (monolayer deposition), and\nthe second is overcharging into negatively charged PE-SB complexes due to the\nsubsequent addition of polyanions (double-layer deposition). The details of\nthese phenomena have been clarified through the analysis of a number of\ntrajectories of various PE-SB complexes that experience either Brownian motion\nor electrophoresis. The contrasted results obtained from the analysis were as\nfollows: an amount in excess of the stoichiometric ratio of the cationic\npolymers was required for the first charge-reversal, whereas the stoichiometric\naddition of the polyanions lead to the electrical neutralization of the PE-SB\ncomplex particles. The recovery of the stoichiometry in the double-layer\ndeposition paves the way for fabricating multi-layered SBs encapsulated solely\nwith anionic and cationic PEs, which provides a simple protocol to create smart\nagents for either drug delivery or ultrasound contrast imaging.\n", "  We examine the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$ and the\nnon-additive Havrda-Charv\\'{a}t / Dar\\'{o}czy/Cressie-Read/Tsallis \\\n$\\mathcal{S}_q$ \\ and the Kaniadakis $\\kappa$-entropy \\ $\\mathcal{S}_\\kappa$ \\\nfrom the viewpoint of coarse-graining, symplectic capacities and convexity. We\nargue that the functional form of such entropies can be ascribed to a\ndiscordance in phase-space coarse-graining between two generally different\napproaches: the Euclidean/Riemannian metric one that reflects independence and\npicks cubes as the fundamental cells and the symplectic/canonical one that\npicks spheres/ellipsoids for this role. Our discussion is motivated by and\nconfined to the behaviour of Hamiltonian systems of many degrees of freedom. We\nsee that Dvoretzky's theorem provides asymptotic estimates for the minimal\ndimension beyond which these two approaches are close to each other. We state\nand speculate about the role that dualities may play in this viewpoint.\n", "  Solar magnetic activity shows both smooth secular changes, such as the Grand\nModern Maximum, and quite abrupt drops that are denoted as Grand Minima. Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of convection driven dynamos offer one way of\nexamining the mechanisms behind these events. In this work, we analyze a\nsolution of a solar-like DNS that has been evolved for roughly 80 magnetic\ncycles of 4.9 years, during which epochs of irregular behavior are detected.\nThe emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. The\nDNS employed is a semi-global (wedge) magnetoconvection model. For data\nanalysis we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and phase\ndispersion ($D^2$) methods. A special property of the DNS is the existence of\nmultiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is\nsolar-like. This mode is accompanied by a higher frequency mode near the\nsurface and a low-frequency mode in the bottom of the convection zone. The\noverall behavior of the dynamo solution is very complex exhibiting variable\ncycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong\nshort-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent\nsuppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum.\nWe interpret the overall irregular behavior to be due to the interplay of the\ndifferent dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the\nsmoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of\nthe mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The\nabrupt low activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is\nrelated to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes\nabrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the\nsuppression of the Reynolds stresses.\n", "  We provide a numerical method to calculate comprehensively the microwave and\nthe laser spectra of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices at finite\ntemperatures. Our formulation is built up with the sum rules, up to the second\norder, derived from the general principle of spectroscopy. The sum rule\napproach allows us to discuss the physical origins of a spectral peak shift and\nalso a peak broadening. We find that a spectral broadening of superfluid atoms\ncan be determined from number fluctuations of atoms, while that of normal-state\natoms is mainly attributed to quantum fluctuations resulting from hopping of\natoms. To calculate spectra at finite temperatures, based on the sum rule\napproach, we provide a two-mode approximation assuming that spectra of the\nsuperfluid and normal state atoms can be calculated separately. Our method can\nproperly deal with multi-peak structures of spectra resulting from thermal\nfluctuations and also coexisting of the superfluid and the normal states. By\ncombining the two-mode approximation with a finite temperature Gutzwiller\napproximation, we calculate spectra at finite temperatures by considering\nrealistic systems, and the calculated spectra show nice agreements with those\nin experiments.\n", "  We use uniform matrix product states (MPS) to study the (1+1)D $O(2)$ and\n$O(4)$ rotor models, which are equivalent to the Kogut-Susskind formulation of\nmatter-free nonabelian lattice gauge theory on a \"hawaiian earring\" graph for\n$U(1)$ and $SU(2)$, respectively. Applying tangent space methods to obtain\nground states and determine the mass gap and the $\\beta$ function, we find\nexcellent agreement with known results, locating the BKT transition for $O(2)$\nand successfully entering the asymptotic weak-coupling regime for $O(4)$. To\nobtain a finite local Hilbert space, we truncate in the space of generalized\nFourier modes of the gauge group, comparing the effects of different cutoff\nvalues. We find that higher modes become important in the crossover and\nweak-coupling regimes of the nonabelian theory, where entanglement also\nsuddenly increases. This could have important consequences for TNS studies of\nYang-Mills on higher dimensional graphs.\n", "  The dynamics of ultra-slow electrons in the combined potential of an ionic\ncore and a static electric field is discussed. With state-of-the-art detection\nit is possible to create such electrons through strong intense-field\nphoto-absorption and to detect them via high-resolution time-of-flight\nspectroscopy despite their very low kinetic energy. The characteristic feature\nof their momentum spectrum, which emerges at the same position for different\nlaser orientations, is derived and could be revealed experimentally with an\nenergy resolution of the order of 1meV.\n", "  In the framework of the so-called gravitoelectromagnetic formalism, according\nto which the equations of the gravitational field can be written in analogy\nwith classical electromagnetism, we study the gravitomagnetic field of a\nrotating ring, orbiting around a central body. We calculate the gravitomagnetic\ncomponent of the field, both in the intermediate zone between the ring and the\ncentral body, and far away from the ring and central body. We evaluate the\nimpact of the gravitomagnetic field on the motion of test particles and, as an\napplication, we study the possibility of using these results, together with the\nSolar System ephemeris, to infer information on the spin of ring-like\nstructures.\n", "  We show through simulation that quantum interference in non-sequential double\nionization can be used to control the recollision with subsequent ionization\n(RESI) mechanism. This includes the shape, localization and symmetry of RESI\nelectron-momentum distributions, which may be shifted from a correlated to an\nanti-correlated distribution or vice versa, far below the direct ionization\nthreshold intensity. As a testing ground, we reproduce recent experimental\nresults by employing specific coherent superpositions of excitation channels.\nWe examine two types of interference, from electron indistinguishability and\nintra-cycle events, and from different excitation channels.\n", "  We study the Schwinger effect, in which the external field having a\nspatiotemporal profile creates electron-positron pairs via multidimensional\nquantum tunneling. Our treatment is based on the trace formula for the QED\neffective action, whose imaginary part is represented by a sum over complex\nworldline solutions. The worldlines are multiperiodic, and the periods of\nmotion collectively depend on the strength of spatial and temporal\ninhomogeneity. We argue that the classical action that leads to the correct\ntunneling amplitude must take into account both the full period, $\\tilde{T}$\nand the first fundamental period, $T_1$. In view of this argument we\ninvestigate pair production in an exponentially damped sinusoidal field and\nfind that the initial momenta for multiperiodic trajectories lie on parabolic\ncurves, such that on each curve the ratio $\\tilde{T}/T_1$ stays uniform.\nEvaluation of the tunneling amplitude using these trajectories shows that\nvacuum decay rate is reduced by an order of magnitude, with respect to the\npurely time-dependent case, due to the presence of magnetic field.\n", "  We systematically explore chemical functionalization of monolayer black\nphosphorene via chemisorption of oxygen and fluorine atoms. Using the cluster\nexpansion technique, with vary- ing concentration of the adsorbate, we\ndetermine the ground states considering both single- as well as double- side\nchemisorption, which have novel chemical and electronic properties. The nature\nof the bandgap depends on the concentration of the adsorbate: for fluorination\nthe direct bandgap first decreases, and then increases while becoming indirect,\nwith increasing fluorination, while for oxidation the bandgap first increases\nand then decreases, while mostly maintaining its direct nature. Further we find\nthat the unique anisotropic free-carrier effective mass for both the electrons\nand holes, can be changed and even rotated by 90 degrees, with controlled\nchemisorption, which can be useful for exploring unusual quantum Hall effect,\nand novel electronic devices based on phosphorene.\n", "  Spin-based electronics or spintronics relies on the ability to store,\ntransport and manipulate electron spin polarization with great precision. In\nits ultimate limit, information is stored in the spin state of a single\nelectron, at which point also quantum information processing becomes a\npossibility. Here we demonstrate the manipulation, transport and read-out of\nindividual electron spins in a linear array of three semiconductor quantum\ndots. First, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of three spins with fidelities\nof 97% on average, using an approach analogous to the operation of a\ncharge-coupled-device (CCD). Next, we perform site-selective control of the\nthree spins thereby writing the content of each pixel of this \"Single-Spin\nCCD\". Finally, we show that shuttling an electron back and forth in the array\nhundreds of times, covering a cumulative distance of 80 $\\mu$m, has negligible\ninfluence on its spin projection. Extrapolating these results to the case of\nmuch larger arrays, points at a diverse range of potential applications, from\nquantum information to imaging and sensing.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with strong spin-orbit\ninteractions and valley-dependent Berry curvature effects have attracted\ntremendous recent interests. Although novel single-particle and excitonic\nphenomena related to spin-valley coupling have been extensively studied,\neffects of spin-momentum locking on collective quantum phenomena remain\nunexplored. Here we report an observation of superconducting monolayer NbSe$_2$\nwith an in-plane upper critical field over six times of the Pauli paramagnetic\nlimit by magneto-transport measurements. The effect can be understood in terms\nof the competing Zeeman effect and large intrinsic spin-orbit interactions in\nnon-centrosymmetric NbSe$_2$ monolayers, where the electronic spin is locked to\nthe out-of-plane direction. Our results provide a strong evidence of\nunconventional Ising pairing protected by spin-momentum locking and open up a\nnew avenue for studies of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity with unique\nspin and valley degrees of freedom in the exact two-dimensional limit.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity from heavy fermion (HF) is always observed\nin f-electron systems, in which Kondo physics between localized f-electrons and\nitinerant electrons plays an essential role. Whether HF superconductivity could\nbe achieved in other systems without f electrons, especially for d-electron\nsystems, is still elusive. Here, we experimentally study the origin of\nd-electron HF behavior in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) AFe2As2 (A = K,\nRb, Cs). Nuclear magnetic resonance on 75As reveals a universal\ncoherent-incoherent crossover with a characteristic temperature T*. Below T*, a\nso-called 'Knight shift anomaly' is first observed in FeSCs, which exhibits a\nscaling behavior similar to f-electron HF materials. Furthermore, the scaling\nrule also regulates the manifestation of magnetic fluctuation. These results\nundoubtedly support an emergent Kondo scenario for the d-electron HF behavior,\nwhich suggests the AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs) as the first material realization of\nd-electron HF superconductors.\n", "  Characterizing human mobility patterns is essential for understanding human\nbehaviors and the interactions with socioeconomic and natural environment. With\nthe continuing advancement of location and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based\nsocial media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few\nyears. With an access to locations of users, profiles and the contents of the\nsocial media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for\nhuman mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining\nthe latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of\nthis paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human\nmobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. We first collect\ngeo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and\norganize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory\ncorresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including\ndetected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We\nthen select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the\ncity of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided\nin user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter\nusers, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the\nspatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter\nusers, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences\nacross three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found\nthat, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups\ngenerally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the\ndemographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly\naffects the urban human mobility patterns.\n", "  Being able to implement effective entanglement distribution in noisy\nenvironments is a key step towards practical quantum communication, and\nlong-term efforts have been made on the development of it. Recently, it has\nbeen found that the null-result weak measurement (NRWM) can be used to enhance\nprobabilistically the entanglement of a single copy of amplitude-damped\nentangled state. This paper investigates remote distributions of bipartite and\nmultipartite entangled states in the amplitudedamping environment by combining\nNRWMs and entanglement distillation protocols (EDPs). We show that the NRWM has\nno positive effect on the distribution of bipartite maximally entangled states\nand multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, although it is able to\nincrease the amount of entanglement of each source state (noisy entangled\nstate) of EDPs with a certain probability. However, we find that the NRWM would\ncontribute to remote distributions of multipartite W states. We demonstrate\nthat the NRWM can not only reduce the fidelity thresholds for distillability of\ndecohered W states, but also raise the distillation efficiencies of W states.\nOur results suggest a new idea for quantifying the ability of a local filtering\noperation in protecting entanglement from decoherence.\n", "  I study the lattice dynamics and electron-phonon coupling in\nnon-centrosymmetric quasi-one-dimensional K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ using density\nfunctional theory based first principles calculations. The phonon dispersions\nshow stable phonons without any soft-mode behavior. They also exhibit features\nthat point to a strong interaction of K atoms with the lattice. I find that the\ncalculated Eliashberg spectral function shows a large enhancement around 50\ncm$^{-1}$. The phonon modes that show large coupling involve in-plane motions\nof all three species of atoms. The $\\mathbf{q}$ dependent electron-phonon\ncoupling decreases strongly away from the $q_z = 0$ plane. The total\nelectron-phonon coupling is large with a value of $\\lambda_{\\textrm{ep}} =\n3.0$, which readily explains the experimentally observed large mass\nenhancement.\n", "  A massive black hole (MBH) consumes stars whose orbits evolve into the small\nphase-space volume of unstable orbits, the \"loss-cone\", which take them\ndirectly into the MBH, or close enough to interact strongly with it. The\nresulting phenomena: tidal heating and tidal disruption, binary capture and\nhyper-velocity star ejection, gravitational wave (GW) emission by inspiraling\ncompact remnants, or hydrodynamical interactions with an accretion disk, are of\ninterest as they can produce observable signatures and thereby reveal the\nexistence of the MBH, affect its mass and spin evolution, probe strong gravity,\nand provide information on stars and gas near the MBH. The continuous loss of\nstars and the processes that resupply them shape the central stellar\ndistribution. We investigate relativistic stellar dynamics near the loss-cone\nof a non-spinning MBH in steady-state analytically and by Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the diffusion of the orbital parameters. These take into account\nNewtonian mass precession due to enclosed stellar mass, in-plane precession due\nto general relativity, dissipation by GW, uncorrelated two-body relaxation,\ncorrelated resonant relaxation (RR) and adiabatic invariance due to secular\nprecession, using a rigorously derived description of correlated post-Newtonian\ndynamics in the diffusion limit. We argue that general maximal entropy\nconsiderations strongly constrain orbital diffusion in steady-state,\nirrespective of the relaxation mechanism. We identify the exact phase-space\nseparatrix between plunges and inspirals, predict their steady-state rates, and\nverify they are robust under a wide range of assumptions. We derive the\ndependence of the rates on the mass of the MBH, show that the contribution of\nRR is small, and discuss special cases where unquenched RR in restricted\nvolumes of phase-space may affect the steady-state substantially.\n", "  We report a giant linear magnetoelectric coupling in strained BiMnO3 thin\nfilms in which the disorder associated with an islanded morphology gives rise\nto extrinsic relaxor ferroelectricity that is not present in bulk\ncentrosymmetric ferromagnetic crystalline BiMnO3. Strain associated with the\ndisorder is treated as a local variable which couples to the two ferroic order\nparameters, magnetization M and polarization P. A straightforward \"gas under a\npiston\" thermodynamic treatment explains the observed correlated temperature\ndependencies of the product of susceptibilities and the magnetoelectric\ncoefficient together with the enhancement of the coupling by the proximity of\nthe ferroic transition temperatures close to the relaxor freezing temperature.\nOur interpretation is based on a trilinear coupling term in the free energy of\nthe form L(PXM) where L is a hidden antiferromagnetic order parameter,\npreviously postulated by theory for BiMnO3. This phenomenological invariant not\nonly preserves inversion and time reversal symmetry of the strain-induced\ninteractions but also explains the pronounced linear magnetoelectric coupling\nwithout using the more conventional higher order biquadratic interaction\nproportional to (PM)^2.\n", "  Ground and space-based sky surveys enable powerful cosmological probes based\non measurements of galaxy properties and the distribution of galaxies in the\nUniverse. These probes include weak lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations,\nabundance of galaxy clusters, and redshift space distortions; they are\nessential to improving our knowledge of the nature of dark energy. On the\ntheory and modeling front, large-scale simulations of cosmic structure\nformation play an important role in interpreting the observations and in the\nchallenging task of extracting cosmological physics at the needed precision.\nThese simulations must cover a parameter range beyond the standard six\ncosmological parameters and need to be run at high mass and force resolution.\nOne key simulation-based task is the generation of accurate theoretical\npredictions for observables, via the method of emulation. Using a new sampling\ntechnique, we explore an 8-dimensional parameter space including massive\nneutrinos and a variable dark energy equation of state. We construct trial\nemulators using two surrogate models (the linear power spectrum and an\napproximate halo mass function). The new sampling method allows us to build\nprecision emulators from just 26 cosmological models and to increase the\nemulator accuracy by adding new sets of simulations in a prescribed way. This\nallows emulator fidelity to be systematically improved as new observational\ndata becomes available and higher accuracy is required. Finally, using one LCDM\ncosmology as an example, we study the demands imposed on a simulation campaign\nto achieve the required statistics and accuracy when building emulators for\ndark energy investigations.\n", "  Integrated photonics has enabled much progress towards quantum technologies.\nMany applications, including quantum communication, sensing, and distributed\nand cloud quantum computing, will require coherent photonic interconnection\nbetween separate chip-based sub-systems. Large-scale quantum computing systems\nand architectures may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable\nscaling beyond the limits of a single wafer and towards \"multi-chip\" systems.\nHowever, coherently interconnecting separate chips is challenging due to the\nfragility of these quantum states and the demanding challenges of transmitting\nphotons in at least two media within a single coherent system. Distribution and\nmanipulation of qubit entanglement between multiple devices is one of the most\nstringent requirements of the interconnected system. Here, we report a quantum\nphotonic interconnect demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and\nmanipulation between two separate chips, implemented using state-of-the-art\nsilicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated and manipulated on-chip,\nand distributed between the chips by interconverting between path-encoding and\npolarisation-encoding. We use integrated state analysers to confirm a Bell-type\nviolation of $S$=2.638+-0.039 between two chips. With improvements in loss,\nthis quantum interconnect will provide new levels of flexible systems and\narchitectures for quantum technologies.\n", "  In this work we continue a line of inquiry begun in Kanner et al. which\ndetailed a strategy for utilizing telescopes with narrow fields of view, such\nas the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT), to localize gravity wave (GW) triggers from\nLIGO/Virgo. If one considers the brightest galaxies that produce ~50% of the\nlight, then the number of galaxies inside typical GW error boxes will be\nseveral tens. We have found that this result applies both in the early years of\nAdvanced LIGO when the range is small and the error boxes large, and in the\nlater years when the error boxes will be small and the range large. This\nstrategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescope\npointings by a factor 10 to 100 compared with tiling the entire error box.\nAdditional galaxy count reduction will come from a GW rapid distance estimate\nwhich will restrict the radial slice in search volume. Combining the bright\ngalaxy strategy with a convolution based on anticipated GW localizations, we\nfind that the searches can be restricted to about 18+/-5 galaxies for 2015,\nabout 23+/-4 for 2017, and about 11+/-2 for 2020. This assumes a distance\nlocalization at or near the putative NS-NS merger range for each target year,\nand these totals are integrated out to the range. Integrating out to the\nhorizon would roughly double the totals. For nearer localizations the totals\nwould decrease. The galaxy strategy we present in this work will enable\nnumerous sensitive optical and X-ray telescopes with small fields of view to\nparticipate meaningfully in searches wherein the prospects for rapidly fading\nafterglow place a premium on a fast response time.\n", "  Eternal inflation arising from a potential landscape predicts that our\nuniverse is one realization of many possible cosmological histories. One way to\naccess different cosmological histories is via the nucleation of bubble\nuniverses from a metastable false vacuum. Another way to sample different\ncosmological histories is via classical transitions, the creation of pocket\nuniverses through the collision between bubbles. Using relativistic numerical\nsimulations, we examine the possibility of observationally determining if our\nobservable universe resulted from a classical transition. We find that\nclassical transitions produce spatially infinite, approximately open\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker universes. The leading set of observables in the\naftermath of a classical transition are negative spatial curvature and a\ncontribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature quadrupole. The\nlevel of curvature and magnitude of the quadrupole are dependent on the\nposition of the observer, and we determine the possible range of observables\nfor two classes of single-scalar field models. For the first class, where the\ninflationary phase has a lower energy than the vacuum preceding the classical\ntransition, the magnitude of the observed quadrupole generally falls to zero\nwith distance from the collision while the spatial curvature grows to a\nconstant. For the second class, where the inflationary phase has a higher\nenergy than the vacuum preceding the classical transition, the magnitude of the\nobserved quadrupole generically falls to zero with distance from the collision\nwhile the spatial curvature grows without bound. We find that the magnitude of\nthe quadrupole and curvature grow with increasing centre of mass energy of the\ncollision, and explore variations of the parameters in the scalar field\nlagrangian.\n", "  One of the most spectacular experimental findings in the fractional quantum\nHall effect is evidence for an emergent Fermi surface when the electron density\nis nearly half the density of magnetic flux quanta ($\\nu = 1/2$). The seminal\nwork of Halperin, Lee, and Read (HLR) first predicted that at $\\nu = 1/2$\ncomposite fermions--bound states of an electron and a pair of\nvortices--experience zero net magnetic field and can form a \"composite Fermi\nliquid\" with an emergent Fermi surface. In this paper we use infinite cylinder\nDMRG to provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of a Fermi sea\nof composite fermions for realistic interactions between electrons at $\\nu =\n1/2$. Moreover, we show that the state is particle-hole symmetric, in contrast\nto the construction of HLR. Instead, our findings are consistent if the\ncomposite fermions are massless Dirac particles, at finite density, similar to\nthe surface state of a 3D topological insulator. Exploiting this analogy we\ndevise a numerical test and successfully observe the suppression of $2k_F$\nbackscattering characteristic of Dirac particles.\n", "  The RSE Born Approximation is a new scattering formula in Physics, it allows\nthe calculation of strong scattering at all frequencies via the Fourier\ntransform of the scattering potential and Resonant-states. In this paper I\napply the RSE Born Approximation to Schrodinger's equation. The resonant-states\nof the system can be calculated using the recently discovered RSE perturbation\ntheory and correctly normalised to appear in spectral Green's functions via the\nflux-volume normalisation. In the limit of an infinite number of resonant\nstates being used in the RSE Born Approximation basis the approximation\nconverges to the exact solution. In the case of effectively 1-dimensional\nsystems I find an RSE Born Approximation alternative to the scattering matrix\nmethod.\n", "  We develop differential measurement protocols that circumvent the laser noise\nlimit in the stability of optical clock comparisons by synchronous probing of\ntwo clocks using phase-locked local oscillators. This allows for probe times\nlonger than the laser coherence time, avoids the Dick effect, and supports\nHeisenberg-limited measurement precision. We present protocols for such\nfrequency comparisons and develop numerical simulations of the protocols with\nrealistic noise sources. These methods provide a route to reduce frequency\nratio measurement durations by more than an order of magnitude.\n", "  The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) is a 3-Unit (3U) CubeSat\ndeveloped at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the\nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder (CU). Over 40 students contributed to the\nproject with professional mentorship and technical contributions from\nprofessors in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department at CU and from LASP\nscientists and engineers. The scientific objective of MinXSS is to study\nprocesses in the dynamic Sun, from quiet-Sun to solar flares, and to further\nunderstand how these changes in the Sun influence the Earth's atmosphere by\nproviding unique spectral measurements of solar soft x-rays (SXRs). The\nenabling technology providing the advanced solar SXR spectral measurements is\nthe Amptek X123, a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon drift detector\n(SDD). The Amptek X123 has a low mass (~324 g after modification), modest power\nconsumption (~2.50 W), and small volume (6.86 cm x 9.91 cm x 2.54 cm), making\nit ideal for a CubeSat. This paper provides an overview of the MinXSS mission:\nthe science objectives, project history, subsystems, and lessons learned that\ncan be useful for the small-satellite community.\n", "  Spectral diffusion arising from $^{29}$Si nuclear spin flip-flops, known to\nbe a primary source of electron spin decoherence in silicon, is also predicted\nto limit the coherence times of neutral donor nuclear spins in silicon. Here,\nthe impact of this mechanism on $^{31}$P nuclear spin coherence is measured as\na function of $^{29}$Si concentration using X-band pulsed electron nuclear\ndouble resonance (ENDOR). The $^{31}$P nuclear spin echo decays show that\ndecoherence is controlled by $^{29}$Si flip-flops resulting in both fast\n(exponential) and slow (non-exponential) spectral diffusion processes. The\ndecay times span a range from 100 ms in crystals containing 50% $^{29}$Si to 3\ns in crystals containing 1% $^{29}$Si. These nuclear spin echo decay times for\nneutral donors are orders of magnitude longer than those reported for ionized\ndonors in natural silicon. The electron spin of the neutral donors `protects'\nthe donor nuclear spins by suppressing $^{29}$Si flip-flops within a `frozen\ncore', as a result of the detuning of the $^{29}$Si spins caused by their\nhyperfine coupling to the electron spin.\n", "  Effects of spontaneous toroidal ordering on magnetic excitation are\ntheoretically investigated for a localized spin model that includes a staggered\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and anisotropic exchange interactions, which\narise from the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling and the multi-orbital\ncorrelation effect. We show that the model exhibits a Neel-type\nantiferromagnetic order, which simultaneously accompanies a ferroic toroidal\norder. We find that the occurrence of toroidal order modulates the magnon\ndispersion in an asymmetric way with respect to the wave number: a toroidal\ndipole order on the zigzag chain leads to a band-bottom shift, while a toroidal\noctupole order on the honeycomb lattice gives rise to a valley splitting. These\nasymmetric magnon excitations could be a source of unusual magnetic responses,\nsuch as nonreciprocal magnon transport. A variety of modulations are discussed\nwhile changing the lattice and magnetic symmetries. Implications of candidate\nmaterials for asymmetric magnon excitations are presented.\n", "  By exploiting the relatively long lifetime of the tau lepton, we propose\nseveral novel methods for searching for new physics at an electron-positron\ncollider. We consider processes that involve final states consisting of a tau\nlepton pair plus two missing particles. The mass and spin of the new physics\nparticles can be measured in 3-prong tau decays. The tau polarization, which\nreflects the coupling to new physics, can be measured from the $\\tau \\to \\pi\n\\nu$ decay channel using the impact parameter distribution of the charged pion.\nWe also discuss the corresponding backgrounds for these measurements, the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) effects, and the implications of finite detector\nresolution.\n", "  Motivated by the study of rare events for a typical genetic switching model\nin systems biology, in this paper we aim to establish the general two-scale\nlarge deviations for chemical reaction systems. We build a formal approach to\nexplicitly obtain the large deviation rate functionals for the considered\ntwo-scale processes based upon the second-quantization path integral technique.\nWe get three important types of large deviation results when the underlying two\ntimes scales are in three different regimes. This is realized by singular\nperturbation analysis to the rate functionals obtained by path integral. We\nfind that the three regimes possess the same deterministic mean-field limit but\ncompletely different chemical Langevin approximations. The obtained results are\nnatural extensions of the classical large volume limit for chemical reactions.\nWe also discuss its implication on the single-molecule Michaelis-Menten\nkinetics. Our framework and results can be applied to understand general\nmulti-scale systems including diffusion processes.\n", "  Recently lots of efforts have been made to obtain the next to leading order\nand Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal corrections to the thermal dilepton emission rate\nin perturbative QCD. Here we apply these results to the plasma created in heavy\nion collisions and see wether these corrections improve the comparison between\ntheoretical calculations and experimental results for the invariant mass\ndependence of the dilepton emission rate. In particular, we simulate the\nquark-gluon plasma produced at RHIC and LHC using a 2+1-dimensional viscous\nhydro model. We compare our results to STAR experiment and comment on the need\nfor a non-perturbative determination of the dilepton rate at low invariant\nmass.\n", "  Phosphorene is a promising two dimensional (2D) material with a direct band\ngap, high carrier mobility, and anisotropic electronic properties.\nPhosphorene-based electronic devices, however, are found to degrade upon\nexposure to air. In this paper, we provide an atomic level understanding of\nstability of phosphorene in terms of its interaction with O2 and H2O. The\nresults based on density functional theory together with first principles\nmolecular dynamics calculations show that O2 could spontaneously dissociate on\nphosphorene at room temperature. H2O will not strongly interact with pristine\nphosphorene, however, an exothermic reaction could occur if phosphorene is\nfirst oxidized. The pathway of oxidation first followed by exothermic reaction\nwith water is the most likely route for the chemical degradation of the\nphosphorene-based devices in air.\n", "  It is thought that strong electron correlation in an insulating parent phase\nwould enhance a critical temperature (Tc) of superconductivity in a doped phase\nvia enhancement of the binding energy of a Cooper pair as known in high-Tc\ncuprates. To induce a superconductor transition in an insulating phase,\ninjection of a high density of carriers is needed (e.g., by impurity doping).\nAn electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) with an ionic liquid gate insulator\nenables such a field-induced transition to be investigated and is expected to\nresult in a high Tc because it is free from deterioration in structure and\ncarrier transport that are in general caused by conventional carrier doping\n(e.g., chemical substitution). Here, for insulating epitaxial thin films (~10\nnm thick) of FeSe, we report a high Tc of 35 K, which is four times higher than\nthat of bulk FeSe, using an EDLT under application of a gate bias of +5.5 V.\nHall effect measurements under the gate bias suggest that highly accumulated\nelectron carrier in the channel, whose area density is estimated to be\n1.4x10^15 cm-2 (the average volume density of 1.7x10^21 cm-3), is the origin of\nthe high-Tc superconductivity. This result demonstrates that EDLTs are useful\ntools to explore the ultimate Tc for insulating parent materials.\n", "  We review the Lorentz integral transform coupled-cluster method for the\ncalculation of the electric dipole polarizability. We benchmark our results\nwith exact hyperspherical harmonics calculations for 4He and then we move to a\nheavier nucleus studying 16O. We observe that the implemented chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interaction at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order\nunderestimates the electric dipole polarizability.\n", "  We study the low temperature magneto-transport properties of several highly\ndisordered amorphous Indium oxide(a:InO) samples. Simultaneously fabricated\ndevices comprising a 2-dimensional (2D) film and 10 $\\mu$m long wires of\ndifferent widths were measured to investigate the effect of size as we approach\nthe 1D limit, which is around 4 times the correlation length, and happens to be\naround 100 nm for a:InO. The film and the wires showed magnetic field ({\\it B})\ninduced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT). In the superconducting\nside, the resistance increased with decrease in wire width, whereas, an\nopposite trend is observed in the insulating side. We find that this effect can\nbe explained in light of charge-vortex duality picture of the SIT. Resistance\nof the 2D film follows an activated behavior over the temperature ($T$),\nwhereas, the wires show a crossover from the high-$T$ activated to a\n$T$-independent behavior. At high temperature regime the wires' resistance\nfollow the film's until they deviate and became independent of $T$. We find\nthat temperature at which this deviation occurs evolve with magnetic field and\nthe width of the wire, which show the effect of finite size on the transport.\n", "  We generalize the model of solid inflation to an anisotropic cosmic solid.\nBarring fine tunings, the observed isotropy of the cosmological background and\nof the scalar two-point function isolate the icosahedral group as the only\npossible symmetry group of such a solid. In such a case, higher-point\ncorrelation functions---starting with the three-point one---are naturally\nmaximally anisotropic, which makes the standard detection strategies highly\ninefficient and calls for a dedicated analysis of CMB data. The tensor\ntwo-point function can also be highly anisotropic, but only in the presence of\nsizable higher-derivative couplings.\n", "  Shafieloo ea al. firstly proposed the possibility that the current cosmic\nacceleration (CA) is slowing down. However, this is rather counterintuitive\nbecause a slowing down CA cannot be accommodated in most mainstream\ncosmological models. In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories\nof dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ and deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we\npresent a comprehensive investigation on the slowing down of CA from both the\ntheoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the\nimpact of different $w(z)$ by using six parametrization models, and then\ndiscuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we\ninvestigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive\nto the specific form of $w(z)$; in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a\nslowing down CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS3 SNe Ia datasets favor a slowing\ndown CA at 1$\\sigma$ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an\neternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible. (3)\nCompared with CMB distance prior data, full CMB data more favor a slowing down\nCA. (4) Due to the low significance, the slowing down of CA is still a\ntheoretical possibility that cannot be confirmed by the current observations.\n", "  We propose an experimental setup using 3D Dirac semimetals to access a novel\nphenomenon induced by the chiral anomaly. We show that the combination of a\nmagnetic field and a circularly polarized laser induces a finite charge density\nwith an accompanying axial current. This is because the circularly polarized\nlaser breaks time-reversal symmetry and the Dirac point splits into two Weyl\npoints, which results in an axial-vector field. We elucidate the appearance of\nthe axial-vector field with the help of the Floquet theory by deriving an\neffective Hamiltonian for high-frequency electric fields. This anomalous charge\ndensity, i.e. the chiral pumping effect, is a phenomenon reminiscent of the\nchiral magnetic effect with a chiral chemical potential. We explicitly compute\nthe pumped density and the axial-current expectation value. We also take\naccount of coupling to the chiral magnetic effect to calculate a balanced\ndistribution of charge and chirality in a material that behaves as a chiral\nbattery.\n", "  Within the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach, we study\nthe two-body charmed $B$ meson decays $B_{u,d,s} \\to D^{(*)}M$, with $M$\ndenoting a light pseudoscalar (or vector) meson. The meson decay constants and\ntransition form factors are factorized out from the hadronic matrix element of\ntopological diagrams. Therefore the effect of SU(3) symmetry breaking is\nretained, which is different from the conventional topological diagram\napproach. The number of free nonperturbative parameters to be fitted from\nexperimental data is also much less. Only four universal nonperturbative\nparameters $\\chi^C$, $\\phi^C$, $\\chi^E$ and $\\phi^E$ are introduced to describe\nthe contribution of the color suppressed tree and $W$-exchanged diagrams for\nall the decay channels. With the fitted parameters from 31 decay modes induced\nby $b\\to c$ transition, we then predict the branching fractions of 120 decay\nmodes induced by both $b\\to c$ and $b\\to u$ transitions. Our results are well\nconsistent with the measured data or to be tested in the LHCb and Belle-II\nexperiments in the future. Besides, the SU(3) symmetry breaking, isospin\nviolation and $CP$ asymmetry are also investigated.\n", "  How ferromagnetic phases emerge in itinerant systems is an outstanding\nproblem in quantum magnetism. Here we consider a repulsive two-component Fermi\ngas confined in a two dimensional isotropic harmonic potential and subject to a\nlarge Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling, whose single-particle dispersion can be\ntailored by adjusting the SO coupling strength. We show that the interplay\namong SO coupling, correlation effects and mean-field repulsion leads to a\ncompetition between ferromagnetic and non-magnetic phases. At intermediate\ninteraction strengths, ferromagnetic phase emerges which can be well described\nby the mean-field Hartree-Fock theory; whereas at strong interaction strengths,\na strongly correlated non-magnetic phase is favored due to the\nbeyond-mean-field quantum correlation effects. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic\nphase of this system possesses a chiral current density induced by the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, whose experimental signature is investigated.\n", "  Pioneering study of Gamow-Teller (GT) and Fermi matrix elements (MEs) using\nno-core-configuration-interaction formalism rooted in multi-reference density\nfunctional theory is presented. After successful test performed for 6He -> 6Li\nbeta-decay, the model is applied to compute MEs in the sd- and pf-shell T=1/2\nmirror nuclei. The calculated GT MEs and the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to the Fermi branch are found to be in a very good agreement with\nshell-model predictions in spite of fundamental differences between these\nmodels concerning model space, treatment of correlations or inclusion of a\ncore. This result indirectly supports the two-body current based scenarios\nbehind the quenching of axial-vector coupling constant.\n", "  The ability of high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) to carry very large\ncurrents with almost no dissipation makes them irreplaceable for high-power\napplications. The development and further improvement of HTS-based cables\nrequires an in-depth understanding of the superconducting vortex dynamics in\npresence of complex pinning landscapes. We present a critical current analysis\nof a real HTS sample in a magnetic field by combining state-of-the-art\nlarge-scale Ginzburg-Landau simulations with reconstructive three-dimensional\nscanning transmission electron microscopy tomography of the pinning landscape\nin Dy-doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$. This methodology provides a unique\nlook at the vortex dynamics in the presence of a complex pinning landscape,\nresponsible for the high current-carrying capacity characteristic of commercial\nHTS wires. Our method demonstrates very good functional and quantitative\nagreement of the critical current between simulation and experiment, providing\na new predictive tool for HTS wires design.\n", "  We investigate the decays of the excited $(b\\bar q)$ mesons as probes of the\nshort-distance structure of the weak $\\Delta B=1$ transitions. These states are\nunstable under the electromagnetic or strong interactions although their widths\nare typically suppressed by phase space. As compared to the pseudoscalar $B$\nmeson, the purely leptonic decays of the vector $B^*$ are not chirally\nsuppressed and are sensitive to different combinations of the underlying weak\neffective operators. An interesting example is $B^*_s\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-$, which\nhas a rate that can be accurately predicted in the standard model. The\nbranching fraction is $\\mathcal{B}\\sim10^{-11}$, irrespective of the lepton\nflavor and where the main uncertainty stems from the unmeasured and\ntheoretically not-well known $B_s^*$ width. We discuss the prospects for\nproducing this decay mode at the LHC and explore the possibility of measuring\nthe $B_s^*\\to\\ell\\ell$ amplitude, instead, through scattering experiments at\nthe $B_s^*$ resonance peak. Finally we also discuss the charged-current\n$B_{u,c}^*\\to\\ell\\nu$ decay which can provide complementary information on the\n$b\\to u\\ell\\nu$ and $b\\to c\\ell\\nu$ transitions.\n", "  Quantum simulations based on near-resonance Bose gases are limited by their\nshort lifetimes due to severe atom losses. In addition to this, the recently\npredicted thermodynamical instability adds another constraint on accessing the\nresonant Bose gases. In this Letter, we offer a potential solution by proposing\nlong-lived resonant Bose gases in both two and three dimensions, where the\nconventional few-body losses are strongly suppressed. We show that the\nthermodynamical properties as well as the lifetimes of these strongly\ninteracting systems are universal, and independent of short-range physics.\n", "  The minimal area for surfaces whose border are rectangular and circular loops\nare calculated using the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation. This amounts to solve\nthe HJ equation for the value of the minimal area, without calculating the\nshape of the corresponding surface. This is done for bulk geometries that are\nasymptotically AdS. For the rectangular countour, the HJ equation, which is\nseparable, can be solved exactly. For the circular countour an expansion in\npowers of the radius is implemented. The HJ approach naturally leads to a\nregularization which consists in locating the countour away from the border.\nThe results are compared with other regularization which leaves the countour at\nthe border and calculates the area of the corresponding minimal surface up to a\ndiameter smaller than the one of the countour at the border. The results do not\ncoincide, this is traced back to the fact that in the former case the area of a\nminimal surface is calculated and in the second the computed area corresponds\nto a fraction of a different minimal surface whose countour lies at the\nboundary.\n", "  We introduce and develop a novel approach to extend the ordinary two-flavor\nneutrino oscillation formalism in matter using a non-Hermitian PT symmetric\neffective Hamiltonian. The condition of PT symmetry is weaker and less\nmathematical than that of hermicity, but more physical, and such an extension\nof the formalism can give rise to sub-leading effects in neutrino flavor\ntransitions similar to the effects by so-called non-standard neutrino\ninteractions. We derive the necessary conditions for the spectrum of the\neffective Hamiltonian to be real as well as the mappings between the\nfundamental and effective parameters. We find that the real spectrum of the\neffective Hamiltonian will depend on all new fundamental parameters introduced\nin the non-Hermitian PT symmetric extension of the usual neutrino oscillation\nformalism and that either i) the spectrum is exact and the effective leptonic\nmixing must always be maximal or ii) the spectrum is approximate and all new\nfundamental parameters must be small.\n", "  We report a measurement of the $\\nu_{\\mu}$-nucleus inclusive charged current\ncross section (=$\\sigma^{cc}$) on iron using data from exposed to the J-PARC\nneutrino beam. The detector consists of 14 modules in total, which are spread\nover a range of off-axis angles from 0$^\\circ$ to 1.1$^\\circ$. The variation in\nthe neutrino energy spectrum as a function of the off-axis angle, combined with\nevent topology information, is used to calculate this cross section as a\nfunction of neutrino energy. The cross section is measured to be\n$\\sigma^{cc}(1.1\\text{ GeV}) = 1.10 \\pm 0.15$\n$(10^{-38}\\text{cm}^2/\\text{nucleon})$, $\\sigma^{cc}(2.0\\text{ GeV}) = 2.07 \\pm\n0.27$ $(10^{-38}\\text{cm}^2/\\text{nucleon})$, and $\\sigma^{cc}(3.3\\text{ GeV})\n= 2.29 \\pm 0.45$ $(10^{-38}\\text{cm}^2/\\text{nucleon})$, at energies of 1.1,\n2.0, and 3.3 GeV, respectively. These results are consistent with the cross\nsection calculated by the neutrino interaction generators currently used by\nT2K. More importantly, the method described here opens up a new way to\ndetermine the energy dependence of neutrino-nucleus cross sections.\n", "  We study the properties of domain walls and domain patterns in ultrathin\nepitaxial magnetic films with two orthogonal in-plane easy axes, which we call\nfourfold materials. In these materials, the magnetization vector is constrained\nto lie entirely in the film plane and has four preferred directions dictated by\nthe easy axes. We prove the existence of $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ domain\nwalls in these materials as minimizers of a nonlocal one-dimensional energy\nfunctional. Further, we investigate numerically the role of the considered\ndomain wall solutions for pattern formation in a rectangular sample.\n", "  While 203 K high temperature superconductivity in H3S has been interpreted by\nBCS theory in the dirty limit here we focus on the effects of hydrogen\nzero-point-motion and the multiband electronic structure relevant for multigap\nsuperconductivity near Lifshitz transitions. We describe how the topology of\nthe Fermi surfaces evolves with pressure giving different Lifshitz-transitions.\nA neck-disrupting Lifshitz-transition (type 2) occurs where the van Hove\nsingularity, vHs, crosses the chemical potential at 210 GPa and new small 2D\nFermi surface portions appear with slow Fermi velocity where the\nMigdal-approximation becomes questionable. We show that the neglected hydrogen\nzero-point motion ZPM, plays a key role at Lifshitz transitions. It induces an\nenergy shift of about 600 meV of the vHs. The other Lifshitz-transition (of\ntype 1) for the appearing of a new Fermi surface occurs at 130 GPa where new\nFermi surfaces appear at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone here the\nMigdal-approximation breaks down and the zero-point-motion induces large\nfluctuations. The maximum Tc=203K occurs at 160 GPa where Ef/w0=1 in the small\nFermi surface pocket at Gamma point. A Feshbach-like resonance between a\npossible BEC-BCS condensate at Gamma and the BCS condensate in different\nk-space spots is proposed.\n", "  We compare the ability of 11 Differential Emission Measure (DEM)\nforward-fitting and inversion methods to constrain the properties of active\nregions and solar flares by simulating synthetic data using the instrumental\nresponse functions of SDO/AIA, SDO/EVE, RHESSI, and GOES/XRS. The codes include\nthe single-Gaussian DEM, a bi-Gaussian DEM, a fixed-Gaussian DEM, a linear\nspline DEM, the spatial synthesis DEM, the Monte-Carlo Markov chain DEM, the\nregularized DEM inversion, the Hinode/XRT method, a polynomial spline DEM, an\nEVE+GOES, and an EVE+RHESSI method. Averaging the results from all 11 DEM\nmethods, we find the following accuracies in the inversion of physical\nparameters: the EM-weighted temperature $T_w^{fit}/T_w^{sim}=0.9\\pm0.1$, the\npeak emission measure $EM_p^{fit}/EM_p^{sim}=0.6\\pm0.2$, the total emission\nmeasure $EM_t^{fit}/EM_t^{sim}=0.8\\pm0.3$, and the multi-thermal energies\n$E_{th}^{fit}/EM_{th}^{sim}=1.2\\pm0.4$. We find that the AIA spatial synthesis,\nthe EVE+GOES, and the EVE+RHESSI method yield the most accurate results.\n", "  Spin-one matter fields are relevant both for the description of hadronic\nstates and as potential extensions of the Standard Model. In this work we\npresent a formalism for the description of massive spin-one fields transforming\nin the $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$ representation of the Lorentz group, based on the\ncovariant projection onto parity eigenspaces and Poincar\\'e orbits. The\nformalism yields a constrained dynamics. We solve the constraints and perform\nthe canonical quantization accordingly. This formulation uses the recent\nconstruction of a parity-based covariant basis for matrix operators acting on\nthe $(j,0)\\oplus(0,j) $ representations. The algebraic properties of the\ncovariant basis play an important role in solving the constraints and allowing\nthe canonical quantization of the theory. We study the chiral structure of the\ntheory and conclude that it is not chirally symmetric in the massless limit,\nhence it is not possible to have chiral gauge interactions. However, spin-one\nmatter fields can have vector gauge interactions. Also, the dimension of the\nfield makes self-interactions naively renormalizable. Using the covariant\nbasis, we classify all possible naively renormalizable self-interaction terms.\n", "  We analyze the bosonic current densities induced by a magnetic flux running\nalong an idealized cosmic string considering that the coordinate along its axis\nis compactified. We also consider the presence of a magnetic flux enclosed by\nthe compactificatified axis. To develop this analysis, we calculate the\ncomplete set of normalized bosonic wave functions obeying a quasiperiodicity\ncondition along the compactified dimension. We show that in this context only\nthe azimuthal and axial currents take place.\n", "  We present an effective, low-dimensionality frequency-domain template for the\ngravitational wave signal from the stellar remnants from binary neutron star\ncoalescence. A principal component decomposition of a suite of numerical\nsimulations of binary neutron star mergers is used to construct orthogonal\nbasis functions for the amplitude and phase spectra of the waveforms for a\nvariety of neutron star equations of state and binary mass configurations. We\nreview the phenomenology of late merger / post-merger gravitational wave\nemission in binary neutron star coalescence and demonstrate how an\nunderstanding of the dynamics during and after the merger leads to the\nconstruction of a universal spectrum. We also provide a discussion of the\nprospects for detecting the post-merger signal in future gravitational wave\ndetectors as a potential contribution to the science case for third generation\ninstruments. The template derived in our analysis achieves $>90\\%$ match across\na wide variety of merger waveforms and strain sensitivity spectra for current\nand potential gravitational wave detectors. A Fisher matrix analysis yields a\npreliminary estimate of the typical uncertainty in the determination of the\ndominant post-merger oscillation frequency $f_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ as $\\delta\nf_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\sim 50$Hz. Using recently derived correlations between\n$f_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and the neutron star radii, this suggests potential\nconstraints on the radius of a fiducial neutron star of $\\sim 220$\\,m. Such\nmeasurements would only be possible for nearby ($\\sim 30$Mpc) sources with\nadvanced LIGO but become more feasible for planned upgrades to advanced LIGO\nand other future instruments, leading to constraints on the high density\nneutron star equation of state which are independent and complementary to those\ninferred from the pre-merger inspiral gravitational wave signal.\n", "  We study a classical many-particle system with an external control\nrepresented by a time-dependent extensive parameter in a Lagrangian. We show\nthat thermodynamic entropy of the system is uniquely characterized as the\nNoether invariant associated with a symmetry for an infinitesimal non-uniform\ntime translation $t\\to t+\\eta\\hbar \\beta$, where $\\eta$ is a small parameter,\n$\\hbar$ is the Planck constant, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature that depends\non the energy and control parameter, and trajectories in the phase space are\nrestricted to those consistent with quasi-static processes in thermodynamics.\n", "  We present an analytical approach for bond percolation on multiplex networks\nand use it to determine the expected size of the giant connected component and\nthe value of the critical bond occupation probability in these networks. We\nadvocate the relevance of these tools to the modeling of multilayer robustness\nand contribute to the debate on whether any benefit is to be yielded from\nstudying a full multiplex structure as opposed to its monoplex projection,\nespecially in the seemingly irrelevant case of a bond occupation probability\nthat does not depend on the layer. Although we find that in many cases the\npredictions of our theory for multiplex networks coincide with previously\nderived results for monoplex networks, we also uncover the remarkable result\nthat for a certain class of multiplex networks, well described by our theory,\nnew critical phenomena occur as multiple percolation phase transitions are\npresent. We provide an instance of this phenomenon in a multipex network\nconstructed from London rail and European air transportation datasets.\n", "  The Gottesman-Knill theorem holds that operations from the Clifford group,\nwhen combined with preparation and detection of qubit states in the\ncomputational basis, are insufficient for universal quantum computation.\nIndeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a\nlocal hidden variable theory, so that there is no need for a quantum mechanical\nexplanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup. Unfortunately,\nClifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and\nmeasurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are\notherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum\ncomputation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an\nadditional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate\nthe Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable\ntheory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell\nviolations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the\nalready existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems. We conclude with an\nexperimentally feasible schematic combining the two, which should potentially\nlead to the demonstration of Bell violation in a Majorana experiment in the\nnear future. Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for\nuniversal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which\nwe describe.\n", "  In the extended phase space, the $d$-dimensional singly spinning Kerr-AdS\nblack holes exhibit the van der Waals's phase transition and reentrant phase\ntransition. Since the black hole system is a single characteristic parameter\nthermodynamic system, we show that the form of the critical point can be\nuniquely determined by the dimensional analysis. When $d=4$, we get the\nanalytical critical point. The coexistence curve and phase diagrams are\nobtained. The result shows that the fitting form of the coexistence curve in\nthe reduced parameter space is independent of the angular momentum. When\n$d=5$---$9$, the exact critical points are numerically solved. It demonstrates\nthat when $d\\geq6$, there are two critical points. However, the small one does\nnot participate in the phase transition. Moreover, the exact critical reentrant\nphase transition points are also obtained. All the critical points are obtained\nwithout any approximation.\n", "  A systematic study of the scalar one-loop two-, three-, and four-point\nFeynman integrals is performed. We consider all cases of mass assignment and\nexternal invariants and derive closed expressions in arbitrary space-time\ndimension in terms of higher transcendental functions. The integrals play a\nrole as building blocks in general higher-loop or multi-leg processes. We also\nperform numerical checks of the calculations using AMBRE/MB and LoopTools/FF.\n", "  The quantum XY, Heisenberg, and transverse field Ising models on hyperbolic\nlattices are studied by means of the Tensor Product Variational Formulation\nalgorithm. The lattices are constructed by tessellation of congruent polygons\nwith coordination number equal to four. The calculated ground-state energies of\nthe XY and Heisenberg models and the phase transition magnetic field of the\nIsing model on the series of lattices are used to estimate the corresponding\nquantities of the respective models on the Bethe lattice. The hyperbolic\nlattice geometry induces the mean-field-like universality of the models. The\nambition to obtain results on the non-Euclidean lattice geometries has been\nmotivated by theoretical studies of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory\ncorrespondence.\n", "  Bosonic quantum conversion systems can be modeled by many-particle\nsingle-mode Hamiltonians describing a conversion of $n$ molecules of type A\ninto $m$ molecules of type B and vice versa. These Hamiltonians are analyzed in\nterms of generators of a polynomially deformed $su(2)$ algebra. In the\nmean-field limit of large particle numbers, these systems become classical and\ntheir Hamiltonian dynamics can again be described by polynomial deformations of\na Lie algebra, where quantum commutators are replaced by Poisson brackets. The\nCasimir operator restricts the motion to Kummer shapes, deformed Bloch spheres\nwith cusp singularities depending on $m$ and $n$. It is demonstrated that the\nmany-particle eigenvalues can be recovered from the mean-field dynamics using a\nWKB type quantization condition. The many-particle state densities can be\nsemiclassically approximated by the time-periods of periodic orbits, which show\ncharacteristic steps and singularities related to the fixed points, whose\nbifurcation properties are analyzed.\n", "  By using a fully quantum approach based on an input-output formulation of the\nstochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, we show rectification of radiation fields\nin a one-dimensional waveguide doped with a pair of ideal two-level systems for\nthree topical cases: classical driving, under the action of noise, and single\nphoton pulsed excitation. We show that even under the constant action of\nunwanted noise the device still operates effectively as an optical isolator,\nwhich is of critical importance for noise resistance. Finally, harnessing\nstimulated emission allows for non-reciprocal behavior for single photon\ninputs, thus showing purely quantum rectification at the single-photon level.\nThe latter is a considerable step towards the ultimate goal of devising an\nunconditional quantum rectifier for arbitrary quantum states.\n", "  The first model-independent measurement of the charm mixing parameters in the\ndecay $D^0 \\to K_S \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ is reported, using a sample of $pp$ collision\ndata recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The measured values are\n\\begin{eqnarray*} x &=& (-0.86 \\pm 0.53 \\pm 0.17) \\times 10^{-2}, \\\\ y &=&\n(+0.03 \\pm 0.46 \\pm 0.13) \\times 10^{-2}, \\end{eqnarray*} where the first\nuncertainties are statistical and include small contributions due to the\nexternal input for the strong phase measured by the CLEO collaboration, and the\nsecond uncertainties are systematic.\n", "  We examine the evolution of extremal spherically symmetric black holes,\ndeveloping both general theory as well as the specific cases of (charged) null\ndust and massless scalar field spacetimes. As matter accretes onto extremal\nmarginally trapped tubes, they generically evolve to become non-extremal with\nthe initial extremal horizon bifurcating into inner and outer non-extremal\nhorizons. At the start of this process arbitrarily slow matter accretion can\ncause a geometrically invariant measure of horizon growth to jump from zero to\ninfinity. We also consider dynamical horizons that are extremal throughout\ntheir evolution and see that such spacetimes contain two extremal black hole\nhorizons: an inner isolated one and an outer dynamical one. We compare these\nextremal dynamical horizons with the dynamical extreme event horizon spacetimes\nof Murata, Reall and Tanahashi.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown by S.~M. de Carvalho et al. (2014) that the\ndeviations between the degenerate case and observations were already evident\nfor 0.7-0.8 M$_{\\odot}$ white dwarfs. Such deviations were related to the\nneglected effects of finite temperatures on the structure of a white dwarf.\nTherefore, in this work by employing the Chandrasekhar equation of state taking\ninto account the effects of temperature we show how the total pressure of the\nwhite dwarf matter depends on the mass density at different temperatures.\nAfterwards we construct equilibrium configurations of white dwarfs at finite\ntemperatures. We obtain the mass-radius relations of white dwarfs for different\ntemperatures by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, and compare\nthem with the estimated masses and radii inferred from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 4.\n", "  We present an efficient implementation of the parquet formalism which\nrespects the asymptotic structure of the vertex functions at both single- and\ntwo-particle levels in momentum- and frequency-space. We identify the\ntwo-particle reducible vertex as the core function which is essential for the\nconstruction of the other vertex functions. This observation stimulates us to\nconsider a two-level parameter-reduction for this function to simplify the\nsolution of the parquet equations. The resulting functions, which depend on\nfewer arguments, are coined \"kernel functions\". With the use of the \"kernel\nfunctions\", the open boundary of various vertex functions in the\nMatsubara-frequency space can be faithfully satisfied. We justify our\nimplementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory\nresults from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency\nasymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are\ncorrectly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent\ndetermination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also\nfeasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.\n", "  At the LHC, an effective theory of the Higgs sector allows us to analyze\nkinematic distributions in addition to inclusive rates, although there is no\nclear hierarchy of scales. We systematically analyze how well dimension-6\noperators describe LHC observables in comparison to the full theory, and in a\nrange where the LHC will be sensitive. The key question is how the breakdown of\nthe dimension-6 description affects Higgs measurements during the upcoming LHC\nrun for weakly interacting models. We cover modified Higgs sectors with a\nsinglet and doublet extension, new top partners, and a vector triplet. First,\nweakly interacting models only generate small relevant subsets of dimension-6\noperators. Second, the dimension-6 description tends to be justified at the\nLHC. Scanning over model parameters, significant discrepancies can nevertheless\narise; their main source is the matching procedure in the absence of a\nwell-defined hierarchy of scales. This purely theoretical problem should not\naffect future LHC analyses.\n", "  We present in total fifteen potentials for which the stationary Klein-Gordon\nequation is solvable in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Because of the\nsymmetry of the confluent Heun equation with respect to the transposition of\nits regular singularities, only nine of the potentials are independent. Four of\nthese independent potentials are five-parametric. One of them possesses a\nfour-parametric ordinary hypergeometric sub-potential, another one possesses a\nfour-parametric confluent hypergeometric sub-potential, and one potential\npossesses four-parametric sub-potentials of both hypergeometric types. The\nfourth five-parametric potential has a three-parametric confluent\nhypergeometric sub-potential, which is, however, only conditionally integrable.\nThe remaining five independent Heun potentials are four-parametric and have\nsolutions only in terms of irreducible confluent Heun functions.\n", "  Photocount statistics are an important tool for the characterization of\nelectromagnetic fields, especially for fields with an irrelevant phase. In the\nmicrowave domain, continuous rather than discrete measurements are the norm.\nUsing a novel approach, we recover discrete photon statistics from the\ncumulants of a continuous distribution of field quadrature measurements. The\nuse of cumulants allows the separation between the signal of interest and\nexperimental noise. Using a parametric amplifier as the first stage of the\namplification chain, we extract useful data from up to the sixth cumulant of\nthe continuous distribution of a coherent field, hence recovering up to the\nthird moment of the discrete statistics associated with a signal with much less\nthan one average photon.\n", "  We consider the problem for the classification of static and asymptotically\nflat Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton spacetimes with a photon sphere. It is first\nproven that the photon spheres in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity have\nconstant mean and constant scalar curvature. Then we derive some relations\nbetween the mean curvature and the physical characteristics of the photon\nspheres. Using further the symmetries of the dimensionally reduced\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton field equations we show that the lapse function, the\nelectrostatic potential and the dilaton field are functionally dependent in the\npresence of a photon sphere. Using all this we prove the main classification\ntheorem by explicitly constructing all Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions\npossessing a non-extremal photon sphere.\n", "  Constrained flavor violation is a recent proposal for predicting the\ndown-quark Yukawa matrix in terms of those for up quarks and charged leptons.\nWe study the viability of CFV with respect to its predictions for the lepton\nmass ratios, showing that this remains a challenge, and suggest some possible\nmeans for improving this shortcoming. We then extend CFV to include neutrinos,\nand show that it leads to interesting predictions for hierachical heavy\nneutrinos, and leptogenesis dominated by decays of the second heaviest one (\"N2\nleptogenesis\"), as well as the possibility of low-scale leptoquark-mediated\nexotic decays.\n", "  We calculate the electronic properties of the $t$-$J$ model on a $C_{60}$\nmolecule using the density-matrix renormalization group and show that Hund's\nfirst rule is violated and that for an average of three added electron per\nmolecule, an effective attraction (pair-binding) arises for intermediate values\nof $t/J$. Specifically, it is energetically favorable to put four electrons on\none $C_{60}$ and two on a second rather than putting three on each. Our results\nshow that a dominantly electronic mechanism of superconductivity is possible in\ndoped $C_{60}$.\n", "  We present an analysis of the symmetries of the interference pattern of\ncritical currents through a two-dimensional\nsuperconductor-semiconductor-superconductor junction, taking into account\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, an arbitrarily oriented magnetic\nfield, disorder, and structural asymmetries. We relate the symmetries of the\npattern to the absence or presence of symmetries in the Hamiltonian, which\nprovides a qualitative connection between easily measurable quantities and the\nspin-orbit coupling and other symmetries of the junction. We support our\nanalysis with numerical calculations of the Josephson current based on a\nperturbative expansion up to eighth order in tunnel coupling between the normal\nregion and the superconductors.\n", "  We present infrared absorption studies of solid hydrogen deuteride to\npressures as high as 3.4 megabar in a diamond anvil cell and temperatures in\nthe range 5 to 295 K. Above 198 GPa the sample transforms to a mixture of HD\n,H2 and D2, interpreted as a process of dissociation and recombination. Three\nnew phases-lines are observed, two of which differ remarkably from those of the\nhigh-pressure homonuclear species, but none are metallic. The time-dependent\nspectral changes are analyzed to determine the molecular concentrations as a\nfunction of time; the nucleon exchange achieves steady state concentrations in\n~20 hours at ~200 GPa.\n", "  We consider $O(N)$-symmetric bosonic $\\phi^4$ field theories above four\ndimensions, and propose a new reformulation in terms of an irreducible\ntensorial field with a cubic and Yukawa terms. The $\\phi^4$ field theory so\nrewritten exhibits real and nontrivial IR-stable fixed points near and below\nsix dimension, for low values of $N$ such as $N=2$ and $N=3$. The so-defined UV\ncompletions of the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models hence constitute precious examples\nof asymptotically safe quantum field theories. The possibility of an extension\nof our results to five dimensions is discussed.\n", "  We evaluate the neutron electric dipole moment $\\vert \\vec{d}_N\\vert$ using\nlattice QCD techniques. The gauge configurations analyzed are produced by the\nEuropean Twisted Mass Collaboration using $N_f{=}2{+}1{+}1$ twisted mass\nfermions at one value of the lattice spacing of $a \\simeq 0.082 \\ {\\rm fm}$ and\na light quark mass corresponding to $m_{\\pi} \\simeq 373 \\ {\\rm MeV}$. Our\napproach to extract the neutron electric dipole moment is based on the\ncalculation of the $CP$-odd electromagnetic form factor $F_3(Q^2)$ for small\nvalues of the vacuum angle $\\theta$ in the limit of zero Euclidean momentum\ntransfer $Q^2$. The limit $Q^2 \\to 0$ is realized either by adopting a\nparameterization of the momentum dependence of $F_3(Q^2)$ and performing a fit,\nor by employing new position space methods, which involve the elimination of\nthe kinematical momentum factor in front of $F_3(Q^2)$. The computation in the\npresence of a $CP$-violating term requires the evaluation of the topological\ncharge ${\\cal Q}$. This is computed by applying the cooling technique and the\ngradient flow with three different actions, namely the Wilson, the Symanzik\ntree-level improved and the Iwasaki action. We demonstrate that cooling and\ngradient flow give equivalent results for the neutron electric dipole moment.\nOur analysis yields a value of $\\vert \\vec{d}_N\\vert=0.045(6)(1)\\ \\bar{\\theta}\n\\ e \\cdot {\\rm fm}$ for the ensemble with $m_\\pi=373$ MeV considered.\n", "  We generalize the problem of strongly interacting neutron matter by adding a\nperiodic external modulation. This allows us to study from first principles a\nneutron system that is extended and inhomogeneous, with connections to the\nphysics of both neutron-star crusts and neutron-rich nuclei. We carry out fully\nnon-perturbative microscopic Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the energy of\nneutron matter at different densities, as well as different strengths and\nperiodicities of the external potential. In order to remove systematic errors,\nwe examine finite-size effects and the impact of the wave function ansatz. We\nalso make contact with energy-density functional theories of nuclei and\ndisentangle isovector gradient contributions from bulk properties. Finally, we\ncalculate the static density-density linear response function of neutron matter\nand compare it with the response of other physical systems.\n", "  In the present work, we study the magnetic properties of the NbS2 monolayer\nby first-principles calculations. The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)\nare a family of laminar materials presenting exciting properties such as charge\ndensity waves (CDW), superconductivity and metal-insulating transitions among\nothers. 2H-NbS2 is a particular case within the family, because it is the only\none that is superconductor without exhibiting a CDW order. Although no long\nrange magnetic order was experimentally observed in the TMDC, we show here that\nthe single monolayer of NbS2 is on the verge of a spin density wave (SDW)\nphase. Our calculations indicate that a wave-like magnetic order is stabilized\nin the NbS2 monolayer in the presence of magnetic defects or within zig-zag\nnanoribbons, due to the presence of unpaired electrons. We calculate the real\npart of the bare electronic susceptibilty and the corresponding nesting\nfunction of the clean NbS2 monolayer, showing that there are strong electronic\ninstabilities at the same wavevector asociated with the calculated SDWs, also\ncorresponding with one of the main nesting vectors of the Fermi surface. We\nconclude that the physical mechanism behind the spin-wave instabilities are the\nnesting properties, accentuated by the quasi 2D character of this system, and\nthe rather strong Coulomb interactions of the 4d band of the Nb atom. We also\nestimate the amplitude of the spin-fluctuations and find that they are rather\nlarge, as expected for a system on the verge of a quantum critical transition.\n", "  We study a thermoelectric ratchet consisting of an array of disordered\nnanowires arranged in parallel on top of an insulating substrate, and contacted\nasymmetrically to two electrodes. Transport is investigated in the Mott hopping\nregime, when localized electrons can propagate through the nanowires via\nthermally assisted hops. When the electronic temperature in the nanowires is\ndifferent from the phononic one in the substrate, we show that a finite\nelectrical current is generated even in the absence of driving forces between\nthe electrodes. We discuss the device performance both as an energy harvester,\nwhen an excess heat from the substrate is converted into useful power, and as a\nrefrigerator, when an external power is supplied to cool down the substrate.\n", "  We present a method for coherently combining short data segments from\ngravitational-wave detectors to improve the sensitivity of semi-coherent\nsearches for continuous gravitational waves. All-sky searches for continuous\ngravitational waves from unknown sources are computationally limited. The\nsemi-coherent approach reduces the computational cost by dividing the entire\nobservation timespan into short segments to be analyzed coherently, then\ncombined together incoherently. Semi-coherent analyses that attempt to improve\nsensitivity by coherently combining data from multiple detectors face a\ncomputational challenge in accounting for uncertainties in signal parameters.\nIn this article, we lay out a technique to meet this challenge using summed\nFourier transform coefficients. Applying this technique to one all-sky search\nalgorithm called TwoSpect, we confirm that the sensitivity of all-sky,\nsemi-coherent searches can be improved by coherently combining the short data\nsegments. For misaligned detectors, however, this improvement requires careful\nattention when marginalizing over unknown polarization parameters. In addition,\ncare must be taken in correcting for differential detector velocity due to the\nEarth's rotation for high signal frequencies and widely separated detectors.\n", "  A common way to obtain standard-model-like Lagrangians in string theory is to\nplace D3-branes inside flux compactifications. The bosonic and fermionic masses\nand couplings of the resulting gauge theory are determined by the\nten-dimensional metric and the fluxes, respectively, and the breaking of\nsupersymmetry is soft. However, not any soft-supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian\ncan be obtained this way since the string theory equations of motion impose\ncertain relations between the soft couplings. We show that for D3-branes in\nbackground fluxes, these relations imply that the sums of the squares of the\nboson and of the fermion masses are equal and that, furthermore, one- and\ntwo-loop quantum corrections do not spoil this equality. This makes the use of\nD3-branes for constructing computationally controllable models for physics\nbeyond the standard model problematic.\n", "  The method to calculate the grand partition function of a particle system, in\nwhich constituents interact with each other via potential, that include\nrepulsive and attractive components, is proposed. The cell model, which was\nintroduced to describe critical phenomena and phase transitions, is used to\nprovide calculations. The exact procedure of integration over particle\ncoordinates and summation over number of particles is proposed. As a result, an\nevident expression for the grand partition function of the fluid cell model is\nobtained in the form of multiple integral over collective variables. As it can\nbe seen directly from the structure of the transition jacobian, the present\nmultiparticle model appeared to be different from the Ising model, which is\nwidely used to describe fluid systems. The state equation, which is valid for\nwide temperature ranges both above and below the critical one, is derived in\nmean-field approximation. The pressure calculated for the cell model at\ntemperatures above the critical one is found to be continuously increasing\nfunction of temperature and density. The isotherms of pressure as a function of\ndensity have horizontal parts at temperatures below the critical one.\n", "  We report measurements from which we determine the spatial structure of the\nlunar contribution to night sky brightness, taken at the LSST site on Cerro\nPachon in Chile. We use an array of six photodiodes with filters that\napproximate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope's {\\it u, g, r, i, z,} and {\\it\ny} bands. We use the sun as a proxy for the moon, and measure sky brightness as\na function of zenith angle of the point on sky, zenith angle of the sun, and\nangular distance between the sun and the point on sky. We make a correction for\nthe difference between the illumination spectrum of the sun and the moon. Since\nscattered sunlight totally dominates the daytime sky brightness, this technique\nallows us to cleanly determine the contribution to the (cloudless) night sky\nfrom backscattered moonlight, without contamination from other sources of night\nsky brightness. We estimate our uncertainty in the relative lunar night sky\nbrightness vs. zenith and lunar angle to be 10\\,\\%. This information is useful\nin planning the optimal execution of the LSST survey, and perhaps for other\nastronomical observations as well. Although our primary objective is to map out\nthe angular structure and spectrum of the scattered light from the atmosphere\nand particulates, we also make an estimate of the expected number of scattered\nlunar photons per pixel per second in LSST, and find values that are in overall\nagreement with previous estimates.\n", "  We present high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra of the four brightest\nconfirmed red giant stars in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Bootes II (Boo II).\nThese stars all inhabit the metal-poor tail of the Boo II metallicity\ndistribution function. The chemical abundance pattern of all detectable\nelements in these stars is consistent with that of the Galactic halo. However,\nall four stars have undetectable amounts of neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba,\nwith upper limits comparable to the lowest ever detected in the halo or in\nother dwarf galaxies. One star exhibits significant radial velocity variations\nover time, suggesting it to be in a binary system. Its variable velocity has\nlikely increased past determinations of the Boo II velocity dispersion. Our\nfour stars span a limited metallicity range, but their enhanced\n{\\alpha}-abundances and low neutron-capture abundances are consistent with the\ninterpretation that Boo II has been enriched by very few generations of stars.\nThe chemical abundance pattern in Boo II confirms the emerging trend that the\nfaintest dwarf galaxies have neutron-capture abundances distinct from the halo,\nsuggesting the dominant source of neutron-capture elements in halo stars may be\ndifferent than in ultra-faint dwarfs.\n", "  We study the renormalization group flow of the velocities in the field theory\ndescribing the coupling of the massless quasi-relativistic fermions to the\nbosons through the Yukawa coupling, as well as with both bosons and fermions\ncoupled to a fluctuating $U(1)$ gauge field in two and three spatial\ndimensions. Different versions of this theory describe quantum critical\nbehavior of interacting Dirac fermions in various condensed-matter systems. We\nperform an analysis using one-loop $\\epsilon-$expansion about three spatial\ndimensions, which is the upper critical dimension in the problem. In two\ndimensions, we find that velocities of both charged fermions and bosons\nultimately flow to the velocity of light, independently of the initial\nconditions, the number of fermionic and bosonic flavors, and the value of the\ncouplings at the critical point. In three dimensions, due to the analyticity of\nthe gauge field propagator, both the $U(1)$ charge and the velocity of light\nflow, which leads to a richer behavior than in two dimensions. We show that all\nthree velocities ultimately flow to a common terminal velocity, which is\nnon-universal and different from the original velocity of light. Therefore,\nemergence of the Lorentz symmetry in the ultimate infrared regime seems to be a\nrather universal feature of this class of theories in both two and three\ndimensions.\n", "  We develop generalization of the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo method for\nHamiltonians which explicitly depend on particle spins such as for spin-orbit\ninteractions. The method is formulated in zero variance manner and is similar\nto treatment of nonlocal operators in commonly used static- spin calculations.\nTests on atomic and molecular systems show that it is very accurate, on par\nwith the fixed-node method. This opens electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo\nmethods to a vast research area of quantum phenomena in which spin-related\ninteractions play an important role.\n", "  Data transmission at the upgraded Large Hadron Collider experiments, foreseen\nfor mid 2020s will be in the multi Gbit/s range per connection for the\ninnermost detector layers. This paper reports on first tests on the possible\nuse of carbon cables for electrical data transmission close to the interaction\npoint. Carbon cables have the potential advantage of being light, having a low\nactivation and easy integration into the detector components close to the\ninteraction point. In these tests commercially available carbon cables were\nused, in which the filaments had a very thin nickel coating. For these cables\ndata rates beyond 1 Gbit/s over more than 1m with an error rate of less than\n10^{-12} could be transmitted. The characteristics of the cables have been\nmeasured in terms of S-parameters and could be reproduced with a Spice model.\nSome outlook on potential further improvements is presented.\n", "  In this short note, we come back to the recent proposal put forward by\nKharzeev and Levin [PRL 114 (2015) 24, 242001], in which they\nphenomenologically couple the non-perturbative Veneziano ghost to the\nperturbative gluon, leading to a modified gluon propagator (the \"glost\") of the\nGribov type, with complex poles. As such, a possible link was made between the\nQCD topological \\theta-vacuum (Veneziano ghost) and color confinement (no\nphysically observable gluons). We discuss some subtleties concerning gauge\n(BRST) invariance of this proposal, related to the choice of Feynman gauge. We\nfurthermore provide an example in the Landau gauge of a similar\nphenomenological vertex that also describes the necessary Veneziano ghost but\ndoes not affect the Landau gauge gluon propagator.\n", "  The high-temperature limit of Standard Model generated by the contractions of\ngauge groups is discussed. Contraction parameters of gauge group $SU(2)$ of\nElectroweak Model and gauge group $SU(3)$ of Quantum Chromodynamics are taken\nidentical and tending to zero when temperature increase. Properties of the\nelementary particles change drastically at the infinite temperature limit: all\nparticles lose masses, all quarks are monochromatic. Electroweak interactions\nbecome long-range and are mediated by the neutral currents. Particles of\ndifferent kind do not interact. It looks like some stratification with only one\nsort of particles in each stratum. The Standard Model passes in this limit\nthrough several stages, which are distinguished by the powers of contraction\nparameter. For any stage the intermediate models are constructed and the exact\nexpressions for the respective Lagrangians are presented. The developed\napproach describes the evolution of Standard Model in the early Universe from\nthe Big Bang up to the end of several nanoseconds.\n", "  We present superconducting microwave-frequency resonators based on NbTiN\nnanowires. The small cross section of the nanowires minimizes vortex\ngeneration, making the resonators resilient to magnetic fields. Measured\nintrinsic quality factors exceed $2\\times 10^5$ in a $6$ T in-plane magnetic\nfield, and $3\\times 10^4$ in a $350$ mT perpendicular magnetic field. Due to\ntheir high characteristic impedance, these resonators are expected to develop\nzero-point voltage fluctuations one order of magnitude larger than in standard\ncoplanar waveguide resonators. These properties make the nanowire resonators\nwell suited for circuit QED experiments needing strong coupling to quantum\nsystems with small electric dipole moments and requiring a magnetic field, such\nas electrons in single and double quantum dots.\n", "  We present a renormalizable theory of scalars in which the low energy\neffective theory contains a pseudo-Goldstone Boson with a compact field space\nof 2{\\pi} F and an approximate discrete shift symmetry Z_Q with Q>>1, yet the\nnumber of fields in the theory goes as log(Q). Such a model can serve as a UV\ncompletion to models of relaxions and is a new source of exponential scale\nseparation in field theory. While the model is local in `theory space', it\nappears to not have a continuum generalization (i.e., it cannot be a\ndeconstructed extra dimension). Our framework shows that super-Planckian field\nexcursions can be mimicked while sticking to renormalizable four-dimensional\nquantum field theory. We show that a supersymmetric extension is\nstraightforwardly obtained and we illustrate possible UV completions based on a\ncompact extra-dimension, where all global symmetries arise accidentally as a\nconsequence of gauge invariance and 5D locality.\n", "  We show that by adding a single new scalar particle to the Standard Model, a\nTeV-scale leptoquark with the quantum numbers of a right-handed down quark, one\ncan explain in a natural way three of the most striking anomalies of particle\nphysics: the violation of lepton universality in $\\bar B\\to\\bar K\\ell^+\\ell^-$\ndecays, the enhanced $\\bar B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\bar\\nu$ decay rates, and the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Constraints from other precision\nmeasurements in the flavor sector can be satisfied without fine-tuning. Our\nmodel predicts enhanced $\\bar B\\to\\bar K^{(*)}\\nu\\bar\\nu$ decay rates and a\nnew-physics contribution to $B_s\\!-\\!\\bar B_s$ mixing close to the current\ncentral fit value.\n", "  We report on the emergence of two disconnected superconducting domes in\nalkali-metal potassium (K)-doped FeSe ultra-thin films grown on graphitized\nSiC(0001). The superconductivity exhibits hypersensitivity to K dosage in the\nlower-Tc dome, whereas in the heavily electron-doped higher-Tc dome it becomes\nspatially homogeneous and robust against disorder, supportive of a conventional\nCooper-pairing mechanism. Furthermore, the heavily K-doped multilayer FeSe\nfilms all reveal a large superconducting gap of ~ 14 meV, irrespective of film\nthickness, verifying the higher-Tc superconductivity only in the topmost FeSe\nlayer. The unusual finding of a double-dome superconducting phase has stepped\ntowards the mechanistic understanding of superconductivity in FeSe-derived\nsuperconductors.\n", "  The minimal requirement for cosmography - a nondynamical description of the\nuniverse - is a prescription for calculating null geodesics, and timelike\ngeodesics as a function of their proper time. In this paper, we consider the\nmost general linear connection compatible with homogeneity and isotropy, but\nnot necessarily with a metric. A light-cone structure is assigned by choosing a\nset of geodesics representing light rays. This defines a \"scale factor\" and a\nlocal notion of distance, as that travelled by light in a given proper time\ninterval. We find that the velocities and relativistic energies of free-falling\nbodies decrease in time as a consequence of cosmic expansion, but at a rate\nthat can be different than that dictated by the usual metric framework. By\nextrapolating this behavior to photons redshift, we find that the latter is in\nprinciple independent of the \"scale factor\". Interestingly, redshift-distance\nrelations and other standard geometric observables are modified in this\nextended framework, in a way that could be experimentally tested. An extremely\ntight constraint on the model, however, is represented by the blackbody-ness of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background. Finally, as a check, we also consider the\neffects of a non-metric connection in a different set-up, namely, that of a\nstatic, spherically symmetric spacetime.\n", "  The gaseous Xenon(Xe) time projection chamber (TPC) is an attractive detector\ntechnique for neutrinoless double beta decay and WIMP dark matter searches.\nWhile it is less dense compared to Liquid Xe detectors, it has intrinsic\nadvantages in tracking capability and better energy resolution. The performance\nof gaseous Xe can be further improved by molecular additives such as\ntrimethylamine(TMA), which is expected to (1) cool down the ionization\nelectrons, (2) convert Xe excitation energy to TMA ionizations through Penning\ntransfer, and (3) produce scintillation and electroluminescence light in a more\neasily detectable wavelength (300 nm). In order to test the feasibility of the\nperformance improvements with TMA, we made the first direct measurement of\nPenning and fluorescence transfer efficiency with gaseous mixtures of Xe and\nTMA. While we observed a Penning transfer efficiency up to ~35%, we found\nstrong suppression of primary scintillation light with TMA. We also found that\nthe primary scintillation light with Xe and TMA mixture can be well\ncharacterized by ~3% fluorescence transfer from Xe to TMA, with further\nsuppression due to TMA self-quenching. No evidence of the scintillation light\nproduced by recombination of TMA ions was found. This strong suppression of\nscintillation light makes dark matter searches quite challenging, while the\npossibility of improved neutrinoless double beta decay searches remains open.\nThis work has been carried out within the context of the NEXT collaboration.\n", "  We study an s-channel resonance $R$ as a viable candidate to fit the diboson\nexcess reported by ATLAS. We compute the contribution of the $\\sim 2$ TeV\nresonance $R$ to semileptonic and leptonic final states at 13 TeV LHC. To\nexplain the absence of an excess in semileptonic channel, we explore the\npossibility where the particle $R$ decays to additional light scalars $X,X$ or\n$X,Y$. Modified analysis strategy has been proposed to study three particle\nfinal state of the resonance decay and to identify decay channels of $X$.\nAssociated production of $R$ with gauge bosons has been studied in detail to\nidentify the production mechanism of $R$. We construct comprehensive categories\nfor vector and scalar BSM particles which may play the role of particles $R$,\n$X$, $Y$ and find alternate channels to fix the new couplings and search for\nthese particles.\n", "  We report the detailed transport, magnetic, thermodynamic properties and\ntheoretical calculation of KBi2 single crystals in superconducting and normal\nstates. KBi2 shows metallic behavior at normal state and enters superconducting\nstate below Tc = 3.573 K. Moreover, KBi2 exhibits low critical fields in all of\nmeasurements, field-induced crossover from second to first-order phase\ntransition in specific heat measurement, typical magnetization isotherms of\ntype-I superconductors, and small Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappaGL = 0.611.\nThese results clearly indicate that KB2 is a type-I superconductor with\nthermodynamic critical field Hc = 234.3(3) Oe.\n", "  Squeezed light generation has come of age. Significant advances on squeezed\nlight generation has been made over the last 30 years - from the initial,\nconceptual experiment in 1985 till todays top- tuned, application-oriented\nsetups. Here we review the main experimental platforms for generating\nquadrature squeezed light that has been investigated the last 30 years.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the resummation of collinear double logarithms\nin the BFKL gluon Green function using the Monte Carlo event generator BFKLex.\nThe resummed collinear terms in transverse momentum space were calculated in\nRef. [1] and correspond to the addition to the NLO BFKL kernel of a Bessel\nfunction of the first kind whose argument contains the strong coupling and a\ndouble logarithm of the ratio of the squared transverse momenta of the\nreggeized gluons. We discuss how these additional terms improve the collinear\nconvergence of the whole approach and reduce the asymptotic growth with energy\nof cross sections. Taking advantage of the Monte Carlo implementation, we show\nhow the new results reduce the diffusion of the gluon ladder into infrared and\nultraviolet transverse momentum scales, while strongly affecting final state\nconfigurations by reducing the mini-jet multiplicity.\n", "  We compute the partition function of the $q$-states Potts model on a random\nplanar lattice with $p\\leq q$ allowed, equally weighted colours on a connected\nboundary. To this end, we employ its matrix model representation in the planar\nlimit, generalising a result by Voiculescu for the addition of random matrices\nto a situation beyond free probability theory. We show that the partition\nfunctions with $p$ and $q-p$ colours on the boundary are related algebraically.\nFinally, we investigate the phase diagram of the model when $0\\leq q\\leq 4$ and\ncomment on the conformal field theory description of the critical points.\n", "  We analyze the probability of a single loop formation in a long flexible\npolymer chain in disordered environment in $d$ dimensions. The structural\ndefects are considered to be correlated on large distances $r$ according to a\npower law $\\sim r^{-a}$. Working within the frames of continuous chain model\nand applying the direct polymer renormalization scheme, we obtain the values of\ncritical exponents governing the scaling of probabilities of loop formation\nwith various positions along the chain as function of loops length. Our results\nquantitatively reveal that the presence of structural defects in environment\ndecreases the probability of loop formation in polymer macromolecules.\n", "  The result of a search for flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) through\nsingle top quark production in association with a photon is presented. The\nstudy is based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\nusing data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.8 inverse femtobarns. The search for t gamma events\nwhere t to Wb and W to mu nu is conducted in final states with a muon, a\nphoton, at least one hadronic jet with at most one being consistent with\noriginating from a bottom quark, and missing transverse momentum. No evidence\nof single top quark production in association with a photon through a FCNC is\nobserved. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the tu gamma and\ntc gamma anomalous couplings and translated into upper limits on the branching\nfraction of the FCNC top quark decays: B(t to u gamma) < 1.3E-4 and B(t to c\ngamma) < 1.7E-3. Upper limits are also set on the cross section of associated t\ngamma production in a restricted phase-space region. These are the most\nstringent limits currently available.\n", "  The coronal magnetic field directly or indirectly affects a majority of the\nphenomena studied in space physics. It provides energy for coronal heating,\ncontrols the release of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and drives heliospheric\nand magnetospheric activity, yet the coronal magnetic field itself has proven\ndifficult to measure. This difficulty has prompted a decades-long effort to\ndevelop accurate, timely, models of the field - an effort that continues today.\nWe have developed a method for improving global coronal magnetic field models\nby incorporating the type of morphological constraints which could be derived\nfrom coronal images. Here we report promising initial tests of this approach on\ntwo theoretical problems, and discuss opportunities for application.\n", "  The current LHC results make weak scale supersymmetry difficult due to\nrelatively heavy mass of the discovered Higgs boson and the null results of new\nparticle searches. Geometrical supersymmetry breaking from extra dimensions,\nScherk-Schwarz mechanism, is possible to accommodate such situations. A\nconcrete example, the Compact Supersymmetry model, has a compressed spectrum\nameliorating the LHC bounds and large mixing in the top and scalar top quark\nsector with $|A_t|\\sim 2m_{\\tilde{t}}$ which radiatively raises the Higgs mass.\nWhile the zero mode contribution of the model has been considered, in this\npaper we calculate the Kaluza-Klein tower effect to the Higgs mass. Although\nsuch contributions are naively expected to be as small as a percent level for\n10 TeV Kaluza-Klein modes, we find the effect significantly enhances the\nradiative correction to the Higgs quartic coupling by from 10 to 50 %. This is\nmainly because the top quark wave function is pushed out from the brane, which\nmakes the top mass depend on higher powers in the Higgs field. As a result the\nHiggs mass is enhanced up to 15 GeV from the previous calculation. We also show\nthe whole parameter space is testable at the LHC run II.\n", "  The $\\Omega$ baryons with $J^P=3/2^\\pm, 1/2^\\pm$ are studied on the lattice\nin the quenched approximation. Their mass levels are ordered as\n$M_{3/2^+}<M_{3/2^-}\\approx M_{1/2^-}<M_{1/2^+}$, as is expected from the\nconstituent quark model. The mass values are also close to those of the four\n$\\Omega$ states observed in experiments, respectively. We calculate the\nBethe-Salpeter amplitudes of $\\Omega(3/2^+)$ and $\\Omega(1/2^+)$ and find there\nis a radial node for the $\\Omega(1/2^+)$ Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, which may\nimply that $\\Omega(1/2^+)$ is an orbital excitation of $\\Omega$ baryons as a\nmember of the $(D,L_N^P)=(70,0_2^+)$ supermultiplet in the $SU(6)\\bigotimes\nO(3)$ quark model description. Our results are helpful for identifying the\nquantum number of experimentally observed $\\Omega$ states.\n", "  We examine the low energy effective theory of phase oscillations in a\ntwo-dimensional granular superconducting sheet where the grains are arranged in\nhoneycomb lattice structure. Using the example of graphene we present the\nevidence for the engineered Dirac nodes in the bosonic excitations: the spectra\nof the collective bosonic modes cross at the K and K points in the Brillouin\nzone and form Dirac nodes. We show how two different types of collective phase\noscillations are obtained and that they are analogous to the Leggett and the\nBogoliubov-Anderson-Gorkov modes in a two-band superconductor. We show that the\nDirac node is preserved in the presence of an inter-grain interaction, despite\ninduced changes of the qualitative features of the two collective modes.\nFinally, breaking the sublattice symmetry by choosing different on-site\npotentials for the two sublattices leads to a gap opening near the Dirac node,\nin analogy with Fermionic Dirac materials. Dirac node dispersion of bosonic\nexcitations is thus expanding the discussion of the conventional Dirac cone\nexcitations to the case of bosons. We call this case as a representative of\nBosonic Dirac Materials (BDM), similar to the case of Fermionic Dirac materials\nextensively discussed in the literature.\n", "  We evaluate the fifth order normalized cumulant, known as hyperskewness, of\nheight fluctuations dictated by the $(1+1)$-dimensional KPZ equation for the\nstochastic growth of a surface on a flat geometry in the stationary state. We\nfollow a diagrammatic approach and invoke a renormalization scheme to calculate\nthe fifth cumulant given by a connected loop diagram. This, together with the\nresult for the second cumulant, leads to the hyperskewness value $\\widetilde{S}\n= 0.0835$.\n", "  Small-field inflation (SFI) is widely considered to be unnatural because an\nextreme fine-tuning of the initial condition is necessary for sufficiently\nlarge e-folding. In this paper, we show that the unnaturally-looking initial\ncondition can be dynamically realised without any fine-tuning if the SFI occurs\nafter rapid oscillations of the inflaton field and particle creations by\npreheating. In fact, if the inflaton field $\\phi$ is coupled to another scalar\nfield $\\chi$ through the interaction $g^2 \\chi^2 \\phi^2$ and the vacuum energy\nduring the small field inflation is given by $\\lambda M^4$, the initial value\ncan be dynamically set at $(\\sqrt{\\lambda}/g) M^2/M_{\\rm pl}$, which is much\nsmaller than the typical scale of the potential $M.$ This solves the initial\ncondition problem in the new inflation model or some classes of the hilltop\ninflation models.\n", "  We show that the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) can realistically challenge\nthe Inert Doublet Model, excluding its heavy regime up to dark matter masses of\n800 GeV and probing a large fraction of the remaining viable parameter space at\neven higher masses. Two features of the Inert Doublet Model make it\nparticularly suitable for CTA searches. First, the dark matter mass (in the\nheavy regime) must be larger than 500 GeV. Second, the dark matter annihilation\ncross section, $\\sigma v$, is always larger than the thermal one, reaching\nvalues as high as $10^{-25} \\mathrm{cm^3s^{-1}}$. This higher value of $\\sigma\nv$ is the result of the unavoidable coannhilation effects that determine the\nrelic density via thermal freeze-out in the early Universe. We find that with\n100 hours of Galactic Center exposure, CTA's expected limit widely surpasses,\neven after the inclusion of systematic errors, current and projected bounds\nfrom Fermi-LAT and HESS on this model.\n", "  We study the directed Abelian sandpile model on a square lattice, with $K$\ndownward neighbors per site, $K > 2$. The $K=3$ case is solved exactly, which\nextends the earlier known solution for the $K=2$ case. For $K>2$, the avalanche\nclusters can have holes and side-branches and are thus qualitatively different\nfrom the $K=2$ case where avalance clusters are compact. However, we find that\nthe critical exponents for $K>2$ are identical with those for the $K=2$ case,\nand the large scale structure of the avalanches for $K>2$ tends to the $K=2$\ncase.\n", "  Utilizing the in-medium Lorentz decomposition of operators generating QCD\ncondensates we derive general constraints among the latter ones by the\nrequirement of a smooth transition from medium to vacuum. In this way we relate\nthe vacuum limits of heretofore unrelated condensates and provide consistency\nchecks for the vacuum saturation hypothesis and the heavy quark mass expansion.\nThe results are general and depend only on the rank and symmetry of the Lorentz\ntensors to be decomposed. The derived prescription enables to uniquely and\ndirectly identify operator product expansion contributions which are\nalgebraically specific for in-medium situations and in particular useful for\noperators with a higher rank, i.e. larger than three. Four-quark condensates in\nmass dimension six are exemplified.\n", "  We propose a simple mechanism to suppress axion isocurvature fluctuations\nusing hidden sector magnetic monopoles. This allows for the Peccei-Quinn scale\nto be of order the unification scale consistently with high scale inflation.\n", "  It has recently been understood that the hydrodynamic series generated by the\nM\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory is divergent, and that this large order\nbehaviour is consistent with the theory of resurgence. Furthermore, it was\nobserved, that the physical origin of this is the presence of a purely damped\nnonhydrodynamic mode. It is very interesting to ask whether this picture\npersists in cases where the spectrum of nonhydrodynamic modes is richer. We\ntake the first step in this direction by considering the simplest hydrodynamic\ntheory which, instead of the purely damped mode, contains a pair of\nnonhydrodynamic modes of complex conjugate frequencies. This mimics the pattern\nof black brane quasinormal modes which appear on the gravity side of the\nAdS/CFT description of \\symm\\ plasma. We find that the resulting hydrodynamic\nseries is divergent in a way consistent with resurgence and precisely encodes\ninformation about the nonhydrodynamic modes of the theory.\n", "  We study $U_A(1)$ symmetry and its relation to chiral symmetry at finite\ntemperature through the application of functional renormalization group to the\n$SU(3)$ quark meson model. Very different from the mass gap and mixing angel\nbetween $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ mesons which are defined at mean field level and\nbehavior like the chiral condensates, the topological susceptibility includes a\nfluctuations induced part which becomes dominant at high temperature. As a\nresult, the $U_A(1)$ symmetry is still considerably broken in the chiral\nsymmetry restoration phase.\n", "  Solar-analog stars provide an excellent opportunity to study the Sun's\nevolution, i.e. the changes with time in stellar structure, activity, or\nrotation for solar-like stars. The unparalleled photometric data from the NASA\nspace telescope Kepler allows us to study and characterise solar-like stars\nthrough asteroseismology. We aim to spectroscopically investigate the\nfundamental parameter and chromospheric activity of solar analogues and twins,\nbased on observations obtained with the HERMES spectrograph and combine them\nwith asteroseismology. Therefore, we need to build a solar atlas for the\nspectrograph, to provide accurate calibrations of the spectroscopically\ndetermined abundances of solar and late type stars observed with this\ninstrument and thus perform differential spectral comparisons. We acquire\nhigh-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy to construct three solar\nreference spectra by observing the reflected light of Vesta and Victoria\nasteroids and Europa (100<S/N<450) with the \\Hermes spectrograph. We then\nobserve the Kepler solar analog KIC3241581 (S/N~170). We constructed three\nsolar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm obtained with the Hermes spectrograph\nfrom observations of two bright asteroids and Europa. A comparison between our\nsolar spectra atlas to the Kurucz and HARPS solar spectrum shows an excellent\nagreement. KIC3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. The\nfundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are Teff=5689+/-11K,\nlogg=4.385+/-0.005, [Fe/H]=+0.22+/-0.01, being in agreement with the published\nglobal seismic values confirming its status of solar analogue. KIC 3241581 is a\nmetal rich solar analogue with a solar-like activity level in a binary system\nof unknown period. The chromospheric activity level is compatible to the solar\nmagnetic activity.\n", "  A new phenomenon, called cooperative internal conversion process, in which\nthe coupling of bound-free electron and neutron transitions due to the dipole\nterm of their Coulomb interaction permits cooperation of two nuclei leading to\nneutron exchange if it is allowed by energy conservation, is discussed\ntheoretically. General expression of the cross section of the process is\nreported in one particle nuclear and spherical shell models as well in the case\nof free atoms (e.g. noble gases). A half-life characteristic of the process is\nalso determined. The case of $Ne$ is investigated numerically. The process may\nhave significance in fields of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear energy\nproduction.\n", "  We present a method that uses dynamic decoupling of a multi-level quantum\nprobe to distinguish small frequency shifts that depend on $m^2_{j}$, where\n$m^2_{j}$ is the angular momentum of level $\\left|j\\right\\rangle$ along the\nquantization axis, from large noisy shifts that are linear in $m_{j}$, such as\nthose due to magnetic field noise. Using this method we measured the electric\nquadrupole moment of the $4D_{\\frac{5}{2}}$ level in $^{88}Sr^{+}$ to be\n$2.973^{+0.026}_{-0.033}\\, ea_{0}^{2}$. Our measurement improves the\nuncertainty of this value by an order of magnitude and thus helps mitigate an\nimportant systematic uncertainty in $^{88}Sr^{+}$ based optical atomic clocks\nand verifies complicated many-body quantum calculations.\n", "  We analyze a recently proposed extension of the Standard Model based on the\nSU(4) x SU(2)_L x U(1)_X gauge group, in which baryon number is interpreted as\nthe fourth color and dark matter emerges as a neutral partner of the ordinary\nquarks under SU(4). We show that under well-motivated minimal flavor-violating\nassumptions the particle spectrum contains a heavy dark matter candidate which\nis dominantly the partner of the right-handed top quark. Assuming a standard\ncosmology, the correct thermal relic density through freeze-out is obtained for\ndark matter masses around 2 - 3 TeV. We examine the constraints and future\nprospects for direct and indirect searches for dark matter. We also briefly\ndiscuss the LHC phenomenology, which is rich in top quark signatures, and\ninvestigate the prospects for discovery at a 100 TeV hadron collider.\n", "  Based on the data of multiple high-resolution R=60 000 observations obtained\nat the 6-meter telescope BTA in combination with the NES spectrograph, we\nstudied the features of the optical spectrum of the star MWC 17 with the B[e]\nphenomenon. In the wavelength interval 4050-6750 A we identified numerous\npermitted and forbidden emissions, interstellar NaI lines, and diffuse\ninterstellar bands (DIBs). Radial velocities were estimated from lines of\nvarious origin. As the systemic velocity, Vsys, the velocity from the forbidden\nemissions can be accepted: Vr=-47 km/s (relative to the local standard Vlsr=-42\nkm/s). Comparison of the obtained data with the ealier measurements allows us\nto conclude on the absence of considerable variability of spectral details.\n", "  The electronics of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment, the 10-tonne dark matter\ndetector to be installed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF),\nconsists of low-noise dual-gain amplifiers and a 100-MHz, 14-bit data\nacquisition system for the TPC PMTs. Pre-prototypes of the analog amplifiers\nand the 32-channel digitizers were tested extensively with simulated pulses\nthat are similar to the prompt scintillation light and the electroluminescence\nsignals expected in LZ. These studies are used to characterize the noise and to\nmeasure the linearity of the system. By increasing the amplitude of the test\nsignals, the effect of saturating the amplifier and the digitizers was studied.\nThe RMS ADC noise of the digitizer channels was measured to be 1.19 $\\pm$ 0.01\nADCC. When a high-energy channel of the amplifier is connected to the\ndigitizer, the measured noise remained virtually unchanged, while the noise\nadded by a low-energy channel was estimated to be 0.38 $\\pm$ 0.02 ADCC (46\n$\\pm$ 2$\\mu$V). A test facility is under construction to study saturation,\nmitigate noise and measure the performance of the LZ electronics and data\nacquisition chain.\n", "  We address the development of geometric phases in classical and quantum\nmagnetic moments (spin-1/2) precessing in an external magnetic field. We show\nthat nonadiabatic dynamics lead to a topological phase transition determined by\na change in the driving field topology. The transition is associated with an\neffective geometric phase which is identified from the paths of the magnetic\nmoments in a spherical geometry. The topological transition presents close\nsimilarities between SO(3) and SU(2) cases but features differences in, e.g.,\nthe adiabatic limits of the geometric phases, being $2\\pi$ and $\\pi$ in the\nclassical and the quantum case, respectively. We discuss possible experiments\nwhere the effective geometric phase would be observable.\n", "  Here we introduce the RobERt (Robotic Exoplanet Recognition) algorithm for\nthe classification of exoplanetary emission spectra. Spectral retrievals of\nexoplanetary atmospheres frequently requires the preselection of\nmolecular/atomic opacities to be defined by the user. In the era of\nopen-source, automated and self-sufficient retrieval algorithms, manual input\nshould be avoided. User dependent input could, in worst case scenarios, lead to\nincomplete models and biases in the retrieval. The RobERt algorithm is based on\ndeep belief neural (DBN) networks trained to accurately recognise molecular\nsignatures for a wide range of planets, atmospheric thermal profiles and\ncompositions. Reconstructions of the learned features, also referred to as\n`dreams' of the network, indicate good convergence and an accurate\nrepresentation of molecular features in the DBN. Using these deep neural\nnetworks, we work towards retrieval algorithms that themselves understand the\nnature of the observed spectra, are able to learn from current and past data\nand make sensible qualitative preselections of atmospheric opacities to be used\nfor the quantitative stage of the retrieval process.\n", "  In the context of minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we discuss\nthe possibility of the lightest Higgs boson with mass $M_h = 98 $ GeV to be\nconsistent with the $2.3\\sigma$ excess observed at the LEP in the decay mode\n$e^+e^- \\to Zh$, with $h \\to b {\\bar b}$. In the same region of the MSSM\nparameter space, the heavier Higgs boson $(H)$ with mass $M_H \\sim 125 $ GeV is\nrequired to be consistent with the latest data on Higgs coupling measurements\nat the end of 7 + 8 TeV LHC run with $25{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of data. While scanning\nthe MSSM parameter space, we impose constraints coming from flavour physics,\nrelic density of the cold dark matter as well as direct dark matter searches.\nWe study the possibility of observing this light Higgs boson in vector boson\nfusion process and associated production with $W/Z$ boson at the high\nluminosity $(3000~{\\rm fb}^{-1})$ run of the 14 TeV LHC. Our analysis shows\nthat this scenario can hardly be ruled out even at the high luminosity run of\nthe LHC. However, the precise measurement of the Higgs signal strength ratios\ncan play a major role to distinguish this scenario from the canonical MSSM one.\n", "  By using a hydrothermal method, we have successfully grown crystals of the\nnewly discovered superconductor FeS, which has an isostructure of the iron\nbased superconductor FeSe. The superconductivity appears at about 4.5K, as\nrevealed by both resistive and magnetization measurements. It is found that the\nupper critical field is relatively low, with however an rather large anisotropy\n$\\Gamma=[(dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT)/(dH_{c2}^{c}/dT)]_{T_c}\\approx5.8$. A huge\nmagnetoresistivity (290$\\%$ at 9T and 10K, ${H}$ $\\parallel$ c-axis) together\nwith a non-linear behavior of Hall resistivity vs. external field are observed.\nA two-band model is applied to fit the magnetoresistance and non-linear\ntransverse resistivity, yielding the basic parameters of the electron and hole\nbands.\n", "  We report the experimental demonstration of a magnetologic gate built on\ngraphene at room temperature. This magnetologic gate consists of three\nferromagnetic electrodes contacting a single layer graphene spin channel and\nrelies on spin injection and spin transport in the graphene. We utilize\nelectrical bias tuning of spin injection to balance the inputs and achieve\n\"exclusive or\" (XOR) logic operation. Furthermore, simulation of the device\nperformance shows that substantial improvement towards spintronic applications\ncan be achieved by optimizing device parameters such as device dimensions. This\nadvance holds promise as a basic building block for spin-based information\nprocessing.\n", "  The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is a powerful tool for studying\nnon-diffusive thermal transport. Here, we develop a new universal variational\napproach to solving the BTE that enables extraction of phonon mean free path\n(MFP) distributions from experiments exploring non-diffusive transport. By\nutilizing the known Fourier solution as a trial function, we present a direct\napproach to calculating the effective thermal conductivity from the BTE. We\ndemonstrate this technique on the transient thermal grating (TTG) experiment,\nwhich is a useful tool for studying non-diffusive thermal transport and probing\nthe mean free path (MFP) distribution of materials. We obtain a closed form\nexpression for a suppression function that is materials dependent, successfully\naddressing the non-universality of the suppression function used in the past,\nwhile providing a general approach to studying thermal properties in the\nnon-diffusive regime.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the approach to gravity as a theory of a surface\nembedded in a flat ambient space. After the brief review of the properties of\noriginal theory by Regge and Teitelboim we concentrate on its field-theoretic\nreformulation, which we call splitting theory. In this theory embedded surfaces\nare defined through the constant value surfaces of some set of scalar fields in\nhigh-dimensional Minkowski space. We obtain an exact expressions for this\nscalar fields in the case of Friedmann universe. We also discuss the features\nof quantisation procedure for this field theory.\n", "  We present an effective field theory (EFT) for a model-independent\ndescription of deformed atomic nuclei. In leading order this approach recovers\nthe well-known results from the collective model by Bohr and Mottelson. When\nhigher-order corrections are computed, the EFT accounts for finer details such\nas the variation of the moment of inertia with the band head and the small\nmagnitudes of interband $E2$ transitions. For rotational bands with a finite\nspin of the band head, the EFT is equivalent to the theory of a charged\nparticle on the sphere subject to a magnetic monopole field.\n", "  A search for evidence of particle dark matter (DM) and unparticle production\nat the LHC has been performed using events containing two charged leptons,\nconsistent with the decay of a Z boson, and large missing transverse momentum.\nThis study is based on data collected with the CMS detector corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns of pp collisions at the LHC at\na center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No significant excess of events is observed\nabove the number expected from the standard model contributions. The results\nare interpreted in terms of 90% confidence level limits on the DM-nucleon\nscattering cross section, as a function of the DM particle mass, for both\nspin-dependent and spin-independent scenarios. Limits are set on the effective\ncutoff scale Lambda, and on the annihilation rate for DM particles, assuming\nthat their branching fraction to quarks is 100%. Additionally, the most\nstringent 95% confidence level limits to date on the unparticle model\nparameters are obtained.\n", "  The gravitational self-force acting on a particle orbiting a massive central\nbody has thus far been computed for vacuum spacetimes involving a black hole.\nIn this work we continue an ongoing effort to study the self-force in nonvacuum\nsituations. We replace the black hole by a material body consisting of a\nperfect fluid, and determine the impact of the fluid's dynamics on the\nself-force and resulting orbital evolution. We show that as the particle\ninspirals toward the fluid body, its gravitational perturbations trigger a\nnumber of quasinormal modes of the fluid-gravity system, which produce resonant\nfeatures in the conservative and dissipative components of the self-force. As a\nproof-of-principle, we demonstrate this phenomenon in a simplified framework in\nwhich gravity is mediated by a scalar potential satisfying a wave equation in\nMinkowski spacetime.\n", "  We propose a unifying picture where the notion of generalized entropy is\nrelated to information theory by means of a group-theoretical approach. The\ngroup structure comes from the requirement that an entropy be well defined with\nrespect to the composition of independent systems, in the context of a recently\nproposed generalization of the Shannon-Khinchin axioms. We associate to each\nmember of a large class of entropies a generalized information measure,\nsatisfying the additivity property on a set of independent systems as a\nconsequence of the underlying group law. At the same time, we also show that\nEinstein's likelihood function naturally emerges as a byproduct of our\ninformational interpretation of (generally nonadditive) entropies. These\nresults confirm the adequacy of composable entropies both in physical and\nsocial science contexts.\n", "  Kanzelh\\\"ohe Observatory (KSO) was founded during World War II by the\n\"Deutsche Luftwaffe\" (German Airforces) as one station of a network of\nobservatories, which should provide information on solar activity in order to\nbetter assess the actual conditions of the Earth's ionosphere in terms of radio\nwave propagation. The solar observations began in 1943 with photographs of the\nphotosphere, drawings of sunspots, plage regions and faculae, as well as patrol\nobservations of the solar corona. At the beginning all data was sent to\nFreiburg (Germany). After WWII international cooperation was established and\nthe data was sent to Zurich, Paris, Moscow and Greenwich. Relative sunspot\nnumbers are derived since 1944. The agreement between relative sunspot numbers\nderived at KSO and the new International Sunspot Number (ISN) \\citep{SIDC} lies\nwithin $\\sim10\\%$. However, revisiting the historical data, we also find\nperiods with larger deviations. The reasons for the deviations were twofold:\n(1) On the one hand a major instrumental change took place during which a\nrelocation and modification of the instrument happened. (2) On the other hand,\na period of frequent replacement of personnel caused significant deviations,\ni.e. stressing the importance of experienced observers. On long-term, the\ninstrumental improvements led to better image quality. Additionally we find a\nlong term trend towards better seeing conditions since the year 2000. We may\nspeculate that this is related to climatic changes.\n", "  We study the phase diagram for staggered quarks using chiral perturbation\ntheory. In beyond-the-standard-model simulations using a large number ($>8$) of\nstaggered fermions, unphysical phases appear for coarse enough lattice spacing.\nWe argue chiral perturbation theory can be used to interpret one of these\nphases. In addition, we show only three broken phases for staggered quarks\nexist, at least for lattice spacings in the regime $a^2\\ll \\Lambda^2_{\\rm\nQCD}$.\n", "  If a subset of advanced civilizations in the universe choose to rapidly\nexpand into unoccupied space, these civilizations would have the opportunity to\ngrow to a cosmological scale over the course of billions of years. If such life\nalso makes observable changes to the galaxies they inhabit, then it is possible\nthat vast domains of life-saturated galaxies could be visible from the Earth.\nHere, we describe the shape and angular size of these domains as viewed from\nthe Earth, and calculate median visible sizes for a variety of scenarios. We\nalso calculate the total fraction of the sky that should be covered by at least\none domain. In each of the 27 scenarios we examine, the median angular size of\nthe nearest domain is within an order of magnitude of a percent of the whole\ncelestial sphere. Observing such a domain would likely require an analysis of\ngalaxies on the order of a Gly from the Earth.\n", "  We present consistent results for molecular conduction using two\ncentral-complementary approaches: the non-equilibrium Green's function\ntechnique and the quantum master equation method. Our model describes\nelectronic conduction in a donor-acceptor junction in which electron transfer\nis coupled to nuclear motion, modeled by a harmonic vibrational mode. This\nprimary mode is further coupled to secondary phonon modes, a thermal bath.\nAssuming weak electron-phonon coupling but arbitrary large molecule-metal\nhybridization, we compute several non-equilibrium transport quantities: the\nmean phonon number of the primary mode, charge current statistics. We further\npresent scaling relations for the cumulants valid in the large voltage regime.\nOur analysis illustrates that the non-equilibrium Green's function technique\nand the quantum master equation method can be worked out consistently, when\ntaking into account corresponding scattering processes.\n", "  The ability of matter to be superposed at two different locations while being\nintrinsically connected by a quantum phase is among the most counterintuitive\npredictions of quantum physics. While such superpositions have been created for\na variety of systems, the in-situ observation of the phase coherence has\nremained out of reach. Using a heralding measurement on a spin-oscillator\nentangled state, we project a mechanical trapped-ion oscillator into a\nsuperposition of two spatially separated states, a situation analogous to\nSchr\\\"odinger's cat. Quantum interference is clearly observed by extracting the\noccupations of the energy levels. For larger states, we encounter problems in\nmeasuring the energy distribution, which we overcome by performing the\nanalogous measurement in a squeezed Fock basis with each basis element\nstretched along the separation axis. Using 8 dB of squeezing we observe quantum\ninterference for cat states with phase space separations of $\\Delta \\alpha =\n15.6$, corresponding to wavepackets with a root-mean-square extent of 7.8 nm\nseparated by over 240 nm. We also introduce a method for reconstructing the\nWigner phase-space quasi-probability distribution using both squeezed and\nnon-squeezed Fock bases. We apply this to a range of negative parity cats,\nobserving the expected interference fringes and negative values at the center\nof phase space. Alongside the fundamental nature of these large state\nsuperpositions, our reconstruction methods facilitate access to the large\nHilbert spaces required to work with mesoscopic quantum superpositions, and may\nbe realized in a wide range of experimental platforms.\n", "  We consider several one-dimensional driven lattice gas models that show a\nphase transition in the stationary state between a high-density fluid phase in\nwhich the particles are homogeneously distributed and a low-density jammed\nphase where a hole cluster of macroscopic length forms in front of a particle.\nUsing a hydrodynamic equation for an interface growth model obtained from the\ndriven lattice gas models of interest here, we find that in the fluid phase,\nthe roughness exponent and the dynamic exponent that, respectively,\ncharacterise the scaling of the saturation width and the relaxation time of the\ninterface with the system size are given by the KPZ exponents. However, at the\ncritical point, we show analytically that when the equal time density-density\ncorrelation function decays slower than inverse distance, the roughness\nexponent varies continuously with a parameter in the hop rates but it is one\nhalf otherwise. Using these results and numerical simulations for the\ndensity-density autocorrelation function, we further find that the dynamic\nexponent $z=3/2$ in all the cases.\n", "  The Terahertz frequency range bears intriguing opportunities, beyond very\nadvanced applications in spectroscopy and matter control. Peculiar quantum\nphenomena are predicted to lead to light emission by non-trivial mechanisms.\nTypically, such emission mechanisms are unraveled by temporal correlation\nmeasurements of photon arrival times, as demonstrated in their pioneering work\nby Hanbury Brown and Twiss. So far, the Terahertz range misses an experimental\nimplementation of such technique with very good temporal properties and high\nsensitivity. In this paper, we propose a room-temperature scheme to measure\nphoton correlations at THz frequencies based on electro-optic sampling. The\ntemporal resolution of 146 fs is faster than one cycle of oscillation and the\nsensitivity is so far limited to ~1500 photons. With this technique, we measure\nthe photon statistics of a THz quantum cascade laser. The proposed measurement\nscheme allows, in principle, the measurement of ultrahigh bandwidth photons and\npaves the way towards THz quantum optics.\n", "  There are indications of a possible breakdown of the standard model,\nsuggesting that $\\tau$ lepton interactions violate flavor universality. BABAR,\nBelle and LHCb report high ratios of $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$. There are\nlong-standing excesses in $B\\to\\tau\\nu$ and $W\\to\\tau\\nu$ decays, and a deficit\nin inclusive $\\tau$ to strange decays. We investigate whether two Higgs doublet\nmodels with the most general allowed couplings to quarks, and a large coupling\nto $\\tau$ leptons, can explain these anomalies while respecting other flavor\nconstraints and technical naturalness. Fits to $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ data\nrequire couplings of the new Higgs doublet to down-type quarks, opening the\ndoor to many highly constrained flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC)\nprocesses. We confront these challenges by introducing a novel ansatz that\nrelates the new up- and down-type Yukawa couplings, and demonstrate viable\nvalues of the couplings that are free from fine tuning. LEP and LHC searches\nfor new Higgs bosons decaying via $H^0\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ and\n$H^\\pm\\to\\tau^\\pm\\nu$ allow a window of masses $m_H = [100$-$125]\\,$GeV and\n$m_\\pm\\sim 100\\,$GeV that is consistent with the predictions of our model.\nContamination of the $W^+\\to\\tau^+\\nu$ signal by $H^+\\to\\tau^+\\nu$ decays at\nLEP could explain the apparent $W\\to\\tau\\nu$ excess. We predict that the\nbranching ratio for $B_s\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ is not far below its current limit of\nseveral percent. An alternative model with decays of $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu_s$ to\na sterile neutrino is also argued to be viable.\n", "  The long-baseline experiment T2K in Japan has collected data in the neutrino\nmode corresponding to an exposure of $6.57 \\times 10^{20}$ POT (Protons on\nTarget) and currently it is running in the antineutrino mode. The main aim of\nthe antineutrino run is to measure the leptonic phase $\\delta_{CP}$ which may\nhelp to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In this\nwork we show that in T2K, antineutrinos are required only for removing the\nwrong octant solutions which in turn improves the CP sensitivity. If however\nthe octant is known then pure neutrino run is capable of giving the maximum CP\nsensitivity. If we divide the total true parameter space into eight sets, then\nwe find that T2K antineutrino run helps in improving the CP sensitivity for\nonly two sets while for the remaining six combinations pure neutrino run gives\nthe best CP sensitivity. Thus if the neutrino run is replaced by the\nantineutrino run then it causes a reduction in the CP sensitivity in 75$\\%$ of\nthe true parameter space due to lesser statistics. Thus it is worthwhile to\nstudy if the T2K antineutrino run can be reduced by the antineutrino runs of\nthe other experiments, so that T2K can run in dominant neutrino mode to extract\nthe best CP sensitivity. In this work we explore the possibility of the\nantineutrino component of NO$\\nu$A and the atmospheric neutrino experiment\nICAL@INO for compensating the antineutrino run of T2K.\n", "  Despite recent progress, the complete understanding of the perturbations of\ncharged, rotating black holes as described by the Kerr-Newman metric remains an\nopen and fundamental problem in relativity. In this study, we explore the\nexistence of families of quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman black holes whose\ndecay rates limit to zero at extremality, called zero-damped modes in past\nstudies. We review the nearly extremal and WKB approximation methods for\nspin-weighted scalar fields (governed by the Dudley-Finley equation) and give\nan accounting of the regimes where scalar zero-damped and damped modes exist.\nUsing Leaver's continued fraction method, we verify that these approximations\ngive accurate predictions for the frequencies in their regimes of validity. In\nthe nonrotating limit, we argue that gravito-electromagnetic perturbations of\nnearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black holes have zero-damped modes in\naddition to the well-known spectrum of damped modes. We provide an analytic\nformula for the frequencies of these modes, verify their existence using a\nnumerical search, and demonstrate the accuracy of our formula. These results,\nalong with recent numerical studies, point to the existence of a simple\nuniversal equation for the frequencies of zero-damped gravito-electromagnetic\nmodes of Kerr-Newman black holes, whose precise form remains an open question.\n", "  We derive the cross-section for exclusive vector meson production in high\nenergy deeply inelastic scattering off a deuteron target that disintegrates\ninto a proton and a neutron carrying large relative momentum in the final\nstate. This cross-section can be expressed in terms of a novel gluon Transition\nGeneralized Parton Distribution (T-GPD); the hard scale in the final state\nmakes the T-GPD sensitive to the short distance nucleon-nucleon interaction. We\nperform a toy model computation of this process in a perturbative framework and\ndiscuss the time scales that allow the separation of initial and final state\ndynamics in the T-GPD. We outline the more general computation based on the\nfactorization suggested by the toy computation: in particular, we discuss the\nrelative role of \"point-like\" and \"geometric\" Fock configurations that control\nthe parton dynamics of short range nucleon-nucleon scattering. With the aid of\nexclusive $J/\\Psi$ production data at HERA, as well as elastic nucleon-nucleon\ncross-sections, we estimate rates for exclusive deuteron photo-disintegration\nat a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our results, obtained using\nconservative estimates of EIC integrated luminosities, suggest that\ncenter-of-mass energies $s_{NN}\\sim 12$ GeV$^2$ of the neutron-proton subsystem\ncan be accessed. We argue that the high energies of the EIC can address\noutstanding dynamical questions regarding the short-range quark-gluon structure\nof nuclear forces by providing clean gluon probes of such \"knockout\" exclusive\nreactions in light and heavy nuclei.\n", "  States of matter with nontrivial topology have been classified by their bulk\nsymmetry properties. However, by cutting the topological insulator into\nribbons, the symmetry of the system is reduced. By constructing effective\nHamiltonians containing the proper symmetry of the ribbon, we find that the\nnature of topological states is dependent on the reduced symmetry of the ribbon\nand the appropriate boundary conditions. We apply our model to the recently\ndiscovered two-dimensional topological crystalline insulators composed by IV-VI\nmonolayers, where we verify that the edge terminations play a major role on the\nDirac crossings. Particularly, we find that some bulk cuts lead to\nnonsymmorphic ribbons, even though the bulk material is symmorphic. The\nnonsymmorphism yields a new topological protection, where the Dirac cone is\npreserved for arbitrary ribbon width. The effective Hamiltonians are in good\nagreement with ab initio calculations.\n", "  We present the results from observing nine Galactic novae in eruption with\nthe Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) between 2004 and 2009. While many of\nthese novae reached peak magnitudes that were either at or approaching the\ndetection limits of SMEI, we were still able to produce light curves that in\nmany cases contained more data at and around the initial rise, peak, and\ndecline than those found in other variable star catalogs. For each nova, we\nobtained a peak time, maximum magnitude, and for several an estimate of the\ndecline time (t2). Interestingly, although of lower quality than those found in\nHounsell et al. (2010a), two of the light curves may indicate the presence of a\npre-maximum halt. In addition the high cadence of the SMEI instrument has\nallowed the detection of low amplitude variations in at least one of the nova\nlight curves.\n", "  We propose a theory of interference contributions to the two-dimensional\nexciton diffusion coefficient. The theory takes into account four spin states\nof the heavy-hole exciton. An interplay of the single particle, electron and\nhole, spin splittings with the electron-hole exchange interaction gives rise to\neither localization or antilocalization behavior of excitons depending on the\nsystem parameters. Possible experimental manifestations of exciton interference\nare discussed.\n", "  We report the discovery of an ultra-faint star cluster in the constellation\nof Centaurus. This new stellar system, Kim 3, features a half light radius of\n$r_{h}=2.29^{+1.28}_{-0.52}$ pc and a total luminosity of $M_{V}=+0.7\\pm0.3$.\nApproximately 26 stars are identified as candidate member stars down to four\nmagnitudes below the main-sequence turn-off, which makes Kim 3 the least\nluminous star cluster known to date. The compact physical size and extreme low\nluminosity place it close to faint star clusters in the size-luminosity plane.\nThe stellar population of Kim 3 appears to be relatively young\n($9.5^{+3.0}_{-1.7}$ Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$=-1.6^{+0.45}_{-0.30}$) at a\nheliocentric distance of $15.14^{+1.00}_{-0.28}$ kpc. The cluster lacks a\nwell-defined center and a small but prominent group of stars consistent with\nthe Kim 3 isochrone is present approximately 9.7 pc in projection south of the\ncluster center. Both are signs of the cluster being in the final stage of tidal\ndisruption.\n", "  A loop quantization of the diagonal class A Bianchi models starting from the\ncomplex-valued self-dual connection variables is presented in this paper. The\nbasic operators in the quantum theory correspond to areas and generalized\nholonomies of the Ashtekar connection and the reality conditions are\nimplemented via the choice of the inner product on the kinematical Hilbert\nspace. The action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is given explicitly\nfor the case when the matter content is a massless scalar field (in which case\nthe scalar field can be used as a relational clock), and it is shown that the\nbig-bang and big-crunch singularities are resolved in the sense that singular\nand non-singular states decouple under the action of the Hamiltonian constraint\noperator.\n", "  We present a new finite deformation, dynamic finite element model that\nincorporates surface tension to capture elastocapillary effects on the\nelectromechanical deformation of dielectric elastomers. We demonstrate the\nsignificant effect that surface tension can have on the deformation of\ndielectric elastomers through three numerical examples: (1) surface tension\neffects on the deformation of single finite elements with homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous boundary conditions; (2) surface tension effects on instabilities\nin constrained dielectric elastomer films, and (3) surface tension effects on\nbursting drops in solid dielectrics. Generally, we find that surface tension\ncreates a barrier to instability nucleation. Specifically, we find in agreement\nwith recent experimental studies of constrained dielectric elastomer films a\ntransition in the surface instability mechanism depending on the\nelastocapillary length. The present results indicate that the proposed\nmethodology may be beneficial in studying the electromechanical deformation and\ninstabilities for dielectric elastomers in the presence of surface tension.\n", "  Disordered non-interacting systems in sufficiently high dimensions have been\npredicted to display a non-Anderson disorder-driven transition that manifests\nitself in the critical behaviour of the density of states and other physical\nobservables. Recently the critical properties of this transition have been\nextensively studied for the specific case of Weyl semimetals by means of\nnumerical and renormalisation-group approaches. Despite this, the values of the\ncritical exponents at such a transition in a Weyl semimetal are currently under\ndebate. We present an independent calculation of the critical exponents using a\ntwo-loop renormalisation-group approach for Weyl fermions in $2-\\varepsilon$\ndimensions and resolve controversies currently existing in the literature.\n", "  Local entanglement between pairs of spins, as measured by concurrence, is\ninvestigated in a disordered spin model that displays a transition from an\nergodic to a many-body localized phase in excited states. It is shown that the\nconcurrence vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes nonzero and increases in\nthe many-body localized phase. This happen to be correlated with the transition\nin the spectral statistics from Wigner to Poissonian distribution. A scaling\nform is found to exist in the second derivative of the concurrence with the\ndisorder strength. It also displays a critical value for the localization\ntransition that is close to what is known in the literature from other\nmeasures. An exponential decay of concurrence with distance between spins is\nobserved in the localized phase. Nearest neighbor spin concurrence in this\nphase is also found to be strongly correlated with the disorder configuration\nof onsite fields: nearly similar fields implying larger entanglement.\n", "  We review aspects of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortions\nwhich do not appear to have been fully explored in the literature. In\nparticular, implications of recent evidences of heating of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) by feedback from active galactic nuclei are investigated. Taking\nalso into account the IGM heating associated to structure formation, we argue\nthat values of the y parameter of several*10^(-6), i.e. a factor of a few below\nthe COBE/FIRAS upper limit, are to be expected. The Compton scattering by the\nre-ionized plasma also re-processes primordial distortions, adding a y-type\ncontribution. Hence no pure Bose-Einstein-like distortions are to be expected.\nAn assessment of Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, taking into account\nthe latest results from the Planck satellite as well as the contributions from\nthe strong CII and CO lines from star-forming galaxies, demonstrates that a\nforeground subtraction accurate enough to fully exploit the PIXIE sensitivity\nwill be extremely challenging. Motivated by this fact we also discuss methods\nto detect spectral distortions not requiring absolute measurements and show\nthat accurate determinations of the frequency spectrum of the CMB dipole\namplitude may substantially improve over COBE/FIRAS limits on distortion\nparameters. Such improvements may be at reach of next generation CMB anisotropy\nexperiments. The estimated amplitude of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB)\ndipole might be detectable by careful analyses of Planck maps at the highest\nfrequencies. Thus Planck might provide interesting constraints on the CIB\nintensity, currently known with a ~30% uncertainty.\n", "  We study the $(1+1)$-dimensional Villain, Lai, and Das Sarma (VLDS) equation\ndriven by a Gaussian white noise and implement a renormalization scheme without\nrescaling at one-loop order. Using a diagrammatic method, we calculate the\nrenormalized second and third moments in the large-scale and long-time limits.\nThe ensuing skewness value is $S=-0.0441$. This (negative) value is consistent\nwith the numerical prediction of Das Sarma \\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 53}\n359 (1996)].\n", "  It has been proposed that a large population of unresolved millisecond\npulsars (MSPs) could potentially account for the excess of GeV-scale gamma-rays\nobserved from the region surrounding the Galactic Center. The viability of this\nscenario depends critically on the gamma-ray luminosity function of this source\npopulation, which determines how many MSPs Fermi should have already detected\nas resolved point sources. In this paper, we revisit the gamma-ray luminosity\nfunction of MSPs, without relying on uncertain distance measurements. Our\ndetermination, based on a comparison of models with the observed\ncharacteristics of the MSP population, suggests that Fermi should have already\ndetected a significant number of sources associated with such a hypothesized\nInner Galaxy population. We cannot rule out a scenario in which the MSPs\nresiding near the Galactic Center are systematically less luminous than those\npresent in the Galactic Plane or within globular clusters.\n", "  We construct a neutrino model of three twin neutrinos in light of the\nneutrino appearance excesses at LSND and MiniBooNE. The model, which includes a\ntwin parity, naturally predicts identical lepton Yukawa structures in the\nStandard Model and the twin sectors. As a result, a universal mixing angle\ncontrols all three twin neutrino couplings to the Standard Model charged\nleptons. This mixing angle is predicted to be the ratio of the electroweak\nscale over the composite scale of the Higgs boson and has the right order of\nmagnitude to fit the data. The heavy twin neutrinos decay within the\nexperimental lengths into active neutrinos plus a long-lived Majoron and can\nprovide a good fit, at around $4\\sigma$ confidence level, to the LSND and\nMiniBooNE appearance data while simultaneously satisfying the disappearance\nconstraints. For the Majorana neutrino case, the fact that neutrinos have a\nlarger scattering cross section than anti-neutrinos provides a natural\nexplanation to MiniBooNE's observation of a larger anti-neutrino appearance\nexcess.\n", "  The covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum is a key element of the\nstatistical analysis of galaxy clustering data. Independent realisations of\nobservational measurements can be used to sample the covariance, nevertheless\nstatistical sampling errors will propagate into the cosmological parameter\ninference potentially limiting the capabilities of the upcoming generation of\ngalaxy surveys. The impact of these errors as function of the number of\nindependent realisations has been previously evaluated for Gaussian distributed\ndata. However, non-linearities in the late time clustering of matter cause\ndepartures from Gaussian statistics. Here, we address the impact of\nnon-Gaussian errors on the sample covariance and precision matrix errors using\na large ensemble of numerical N-body simulations. In the range of modes where\nfinite volume effects are negligible ($0.1\\lesssim k\\,[h\\,{\\rm\nMpc^{-1}}]\\lesssim 1.2$) we find deviations of the estimated variance of the\nsample covariance with respect to Gaussian predictions above $\\sim 10\\%$ level.\nThese reduce to about $\\sim 5\\%$ in the case of the precision matrix. Finally,\nwe perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the effect of covariance errors on the\ncosmological parameter constraints. In particular, assuming Euclid-like survey\ncharacteristics we find that a number of independent realisation larger than\n$\\gtrsim 5000$ is necessary to reduce the contribution of sample covariance\nerrors to the cosmological parameter uncertainties at sub-percent level. We\nalso show that restricting the analysis to large scales $k\\lesssim0.2\\,h\\,{\\rm\nMpc^{-1}}$ results in a considerable loss in constraining power, while using\nthe linear covariance to include smaller scales leads to an underestimation of\nthe errors on the cosmological parameters.\n", "  We introduce an innovative numerical technique based on convex optimization\nto solve a range of infinite dimensional variational problems arising from the\napplication of the background method to fluid flows. In contrast to most\nexisting schemes, we do not consider the Euler--Lagrange equations for the\nminimizer. Instead, we use series expansions to formulate a finite dimensional\nsemidefinite program (SDP) whose solution converges to that of the original\nvariational problem. Our formulation accounts for the influence of all modes in\nthe expansion, and the feasible set of the SDP corresponds to a subset of the\nfeasible set of the original problem. Moreover, SDPs can be easily formulated\nwhen the fluid is subject to imposed boundary fluxes, which pose a challenge\nfor the traditional methods. We apply this technique to compute rigorous and\nnear-optimal upper bounds on the dissipation coefficient for flows driven by a\nsurface stress. We improve previous analytical bounds by more than 10 times,\nand show that the bounds become independent of the domain aspect ratio in the\nlimit of vanishing viscosity. We also confirm that the dissipation properties\nof stress driven flows are similar to those of flows subject to a body force\nlocalized in a narrow layer near the surface. Finally, we show that SDP\nrelaxations are an efficient method to investigate the energy stability of\nlaminar flows driven by a surface stress.\n", "  The canonical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is one of the basic geometries\nthat have spurred significant interest in topologically nontrivial bandgap\nmodes with robust properties. Here, we show that the inclusion of suitable\nthird-order Kerr nonlinearities in SSH arrays opens rich new physics in\ntopological insulators, including the possibility of supporting self-induced\ntopological transitions based on the applied intensity. We highlight the\nemergence of a new class of topological solutions in nonlinear SSH arrays,\nlocalized at the array edges. As opposed to their linear counterparts, these\nnonlinear states decay to a plateau with non-zero amplitude inside the array,\nhighlighting the local nature of topologically nontrivial bandgaps in nonlinear\nsystems. We derive the conditions under which these unusual responses can be\nachieved, and their dynamics as a function of applied intensity. Our work paves\nthe way to new directions in the physics of topologically non-trivial edge\nstates with robust propagation properties based on nonlinear interactions in\nsuitably designed periodic arrays.\n", "  Motivated by the search for design principles of rare-earth-free strong\nmagnets, we present a study of electronic structure and magnetic properties of\nthe ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 within local density approximation (LDA) of\nthe density functional theory, and its combination with dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT). For comparison to these calculations, we have measured magnetic\nand thermodynamic properties as well as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and\nthe photoemission spectrum of single crystal Fe3GeTe2. We find that the\nexperimentally determined Sommerfeld coefficient is enhanced by an order of\nmagnitude with respect to the LDA value. This enhancement can be partially\nexplained by LDA+DMFT. In addition, the inclusion of dynamical electronic\ncorrelation effects provides the experimentally observed magnetic moments, and\nthe spectral density is in better agreement with photoemission data. These\nresults establish the importance of electronic correlations in this\nferromagnet.\n", "  We study the quantum Andreev oscillation induced by interference of the edge\nchiral Majorana fermions in junctions made of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)\ninsulators and superconductors (SCs). We show two chiral Majorana fermions on a\nQAH edge with SC proximity generically have a momentum difference $\\Delta k$,\nwhich depends on the chemical potentials of both the QAH insulator and the SC.\nDue to the spatial interference induced by $\\Delta k$, the longitudinal\nconductance of QAH-SC junctions oscillates with respect to the edge lengths and\nthe chemical potentials, which can be probed via charge transport. Furthermore,\nwe show the dynamical SC phase fluctuation will give rise to a geometrical\ncorrection to the longitudinal conductance of the junctions.\n", "  The optical spin orientation effect in a GaAs/(Ga,Al)As quantum well\ncontaining a high-mobility 2D electron gas was found to be due to\nspin-polarized minority carriers, the holes. The observed oscillations of both\nthe intensity and polarization of the photoluminescence in a magnetic field are\nwell described in a model whose main elements are resonant absorption of the\nexciting light by the Landau levels and mixing of the heavy- and light-hole\nsubbands. After subtraction of these effects, the observed influence of\nmagnetic fields on the spin polarization can be well interpreted by a standard\napproach of the optical orientation method. The spin relaxation of holes is\ncontrolled by the Dyakonov-Perel' mechanism. Deceleration of the spin\nrelaxation by the magnetic field occurs through the Ivchenko mechanism - due to\nthe cyclotron motion of holes. Mobility of holes was found to be two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than that of electrons, being determined by the scattering of\nholes upon the electron gas.\n", "  We re-examine the question of quantum oscillations from surface Fermi arcs\nand chiral modes in Weyl semimetals. By introducing two tools - semiclassical\nphase-space quantization and a numerical implementation of a layered\nconstruction of Weyl semimetals - we discover several important generalizations\nto previous conclusions that were implicitly tailored to the special case of\nidentical Fermi arcs on top and bottom surfaces. We show that the phase-space\nquantization picture fixes an ambiguity in the previously utilized energy-time\nquantization approach and correctly reproduces the numerically calculated\nquantum oscillations for generic Weyl semimetals with distinctly curved Fermi\narcs on the two surfaces. Based on these methods, we identify a 'magic'\nmagnetic-field angle where quantum oscillations become independent of sample\nthickness, with striking experimental implications. We also analyze the\nstability of these quantum oscillations to disorder, and show that the\nhigh-field oscillations are expected to persist in samples whose thickness\nparametrically exceeds the quantum mean free path.\n", "  We consider the role of quantum effects, mainly, Weyl anomaly in modifying\nFLRW model singular behavior at early times. Weyl anomaly corrections to FLRW\nmodels have been considered in the past, here we reconsider this model and show\nthe following: The singularity of this model is weak according to Tipler and\nKrolak, therefore, the spacetime might admit a geodesic extension. Weyl anomaly\ncorrections changes the nature of the initial singularity from a big bang\nsingularity to a sudden singularity. The two branches of solutions consistent\nwith the semiclassical treatment form a disconnected manifold. Joining these\ntwo parts at the singularity provides us with a $C^1$ extension to nonspacelike\ngeodesics and leaves the spacetime geodesically complete. Using Gauss-Codazzi\nequations one can derive generalized junction conditions for this\nhigher-derivative gravity. The extended spacetime obeys Friedmann and\nRaychaudhuri equations and the junction conditions. The junction does not\ngenerate Dirac delta functions in matter sources which keeps the equation of\nstate unchanged.\n", "  A junction between an n- and p-type semiconductor results in the creation of\na depletion region whose properties are at the basis of nowadays electronics.\nIf realized using topological insulators as constituent materials, p-n\njunctions are expected to manifest several unconventional effects with great\npotential for applications. Experimentally, all these fascinating properties\nremained unexplored so far, mainly because prototypical topological PNJs, which\ncan be easily realized and investigated, were not readily available. Here, we\nreport on the creation of topological PNJs which can be as narrow as few tenths\nof nm showing a built-in potential of 110meV. These junctions are intrinsically\nobtained by a thermodynamic control of the defects distribution across the\ncrystal. Our results make Bi2Te3 a robust and reliable platform to explore the\nphysics of topological p-n junction.\n", "  We evaluate the Hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of\nthe current density for a charged scalar field in the region between two\nco-dimension one branes on the background of locally AdS spacetime with an\narbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. Along compact\ndimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the\nphases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field\noperator. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. The\nlatter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. There\nexists a range in the space of the Robin coefficients for separate branes where\nthe vacuum state becomes unstable. Compared to the case of the standard AdS\nbulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on the\nparameters is less restrictive. The current density has nonzero components\nalong compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the\nbrane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact\ndimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that\ndimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that\ndistinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field\nsquared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes. In\nparticular, for Dirichlet boundary condition the current density vanishes on\nthe branes. We show that, depending on the constants in the boundary\nconditions, the presence of the branes may either increase or decrease the\ncurrent density compared with that for the brane-free geometry. Applications\nare given to the Randall--Sundrum 2-brane model with extra compact dimensions.\n", "  In this paper we extend the color dipole formalism to the study of exclusive\nprocesses associated with a leading neutron in $ep$ collisions at high\nenergies. The exclusive $\\rho$, $\\phi$ and $J/\\Psi$ production, as well as the\nDeeply Virtual Compton Scattering, are analysed assuming a diffractive\ninteraction between the color dipole and the pion emitted by the incident\nproton. We compare our predictions with the HERA data on $\\rho$ production and\nestimate the magnitude of the absorption corrections. We show that the color\ndipole formalism is able to describe the current data. Finally, we present our\nestimate for the exclusive cross sections which can be studied at HERA and in\nfuture electron-proton colliders.\n", "  Measurement of $Z$ bosons produced in association with charm jets $(Zc)$ in\nproton-proton collisions in the forward region provides a direct probe of a\npotential non-perturbative (intrinsic) charm component in the proton wave\nfunction. We provide a detailed study of the potential to measure $Zc$\nproduction at the LHCb experiment in Runs 2 and 3 of the LHC. The sensitivity\nto valence-like (sea-like) intrinsic charm is predicted to be $\\langle x\n\\rangle_{\\rm IC} \\gtrsim 0.3\\%(1\\%)$. The impact of intrinsic charm on Higgs\nproduction at the LHC, including $Hc$, is also discussed in detail.\n", "  Motivated by the di-photon resonance recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations at $\\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV, we interpret the resonance as a scalar\nboson $X (750)$ in hidden-valley-like models. The scalar boson $X$ can mix with\nthe standard model Higgs boson and thus can be produced via gluon fusion. It\nthen decays into a pair of very light hidden particles $Y$ of sub-GeV, each of\nwhich in turn decays to a pair of collimated $ \\pi^{0} $'s, and these two $\n\\pi^{0} $'s decay into photons which then form photon-jets. A photon-jet ($\n\\gamma $-jet) is a special feature that consists of a cluster of collinear\nphotons from the decay of a fast moving light particle (sub-GeV). Because these\nphotons inside the photon-jet are so collimated that it cannot be distinguished\nfrom a single photon, and so in the final state of the decay of $X(750)$ a pair\nof photon-jets look like a pair of single photons, which the experimentalists\nobserved and formed the 750 GeV di-photon resonance. Prospects for the LHC\nRun-2 about other new and testable features are also discussed.\n", "  An unit filling Bose-Hubbard Hamilonian embedded in strong Stark field is\nstudied in the off-resonant regime inhibiting single and many-particle first\norder tunneling resonances. We investigate the occurrence of coherent dipole\nwave-like propagation along of an optical lattice by means of an effective\nHamiltonian accounting for second order tunneling processes. It is shown that\ndipole wavefunction evolution in the short-time limit is ballistic and that\nfinite size effects induce dynamical self-interference patterns known as\nquantum carperts. We also present the effects of the border right after the\nfirst reflection showing that the wavefunction diffuses normally with the\nvariance changing linearly in time. This work extends the rich physical\nphenomenology of the tilted one dimensional lattice systems in a scenario of\nmany interacting quantum particles, the so-called many-body Wannier-Stark\nsystem.\n", "  We investigate the topological properties of $N_f = 2+1$ QCD with physical\nquark masses, both at zero and finite temperature. We adopt stout improved\nstaggered fermions and explore a range of lattice spacings $a \\sim 0.05 - 0.12$\nfm. At zero temperature we estimate both finite size and finite cut-off\neffects, comparing our continuum extrapolated results for the topological\nsusceptibility $\\chi$ with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At\nfinite temperature, we explore a region going from $T_c$ up to around $4\\,\nT_c$, where we provide continuum extrapolated results for the topological\nsusceptibility and for the fourth moment of the topological charge\ndistribution. While the latter converges to the dilute instanton gas prediction\nthe former differs strongly both in the size and in the temperature dependence.\nThis results in a shift of the axion dark matter window of almost one order of\nmagnitude with respect to the instanton computation.\n", "  The temporal evolution of a solar prominence inserted in a three-dimensional\nmagnetic flux rope is investigated numerically. Using the model of Titov\nDemoulin (1999) under the regime of weak twist, the cold and dense prominence\ncounteracts gravity by modifying the initially force-free magnetic\nconfiguration. In some cases a quasi-stationary situation is achieved after the\nrelaxation phase, characterized by the excitation of standing vertical\noscillations. These oscillations show a strong attenuation with time produced\nby the mechanism of continuum damping due to the inhomogeneous transition\nbetween the prominence and solar corona. The characteristic period of the\nvertical oscillations does not depend strongly on the twist of the flux rope.\nNonlinearity is the responsible for triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nassociated to the vertical oscillations and that eventually produces horizontal\nstructures. Contrary to other configurations in which the longitudinal axis of\nthe prominence is permeated by a perpendicular magnetic field, like in\nunsheared arcades, the orientation of the prominence along the flux rope axis\nprevents the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and therefore the\nappearance of vertical structuring along this axis.\n", "  Noting the structural relationships between phases of carbon and boron\ncarbide with phases of boron nitride and boron subnitride, we investigate their\nmutual solubilities using a combination of first principles total energies\nsupplemented with statistical mechanics to address finite temperatures. Owing\nto large energy costs of substitution, we find the mutual solubilities of the\nultra hard materials diamond and cubic boron nitride are negligible, and the\nsame for the quasi-two dimensional materials graphite and hexagonal boron\nnitride. In contrast, we find a continuous range of solubility connecting boron\ncarbide to boron subnitride at elevated temperatures. The electron precise\ncompound B$_{13}$CN consisting of B$_{12}$ icosahedra with NBC chains is found\nto be stable at all temperatures up to melting. It exhibits an order-disorder\ntransition in the orientation of NBC chains at approximately T=500K.\n", "  The flavor of cosmic neutrinos may help unveil their sources and could reveal\nthe presence of new physics in the neutrino sector. We consider the impacts of\nnext-generation neutrino detectors, including the planned upgrade to neutrino\ndetector--IceCube-Gen2, which is well-positioned to make dramatic improvements\nin both flavor and spectral measurements. We show that various models in\nneutrino physics beyond the Standard Model, such as neutrino decay,\npseudo-Dirac states, and neutrino self-scattering, may be found or strongly\nconstrained at IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT. We find that the additional flavor\ndiscriminants given by Glashow resonance events and so-called \"double-bang\"\ntopologies improve the ability to access the flavor of the cosmic high-energy\nneutrinos and probe the BSM physics. In addition, although the details depend\non source properties, Glashow resonance events have the additional feature of\nbeing able to inform us of the relative strengths of neutrino and antineutrino\nemission, which may help us discriminate astrophysical scenarios.\n", "  We present density functional plus dynamical mean field studies of cubic\nBaRuO$_3$ using interaction parameters previously found to be appropriate for\nthe related materials CaRuO$_3$ and SrRuO$_3$. The calculated variation in\ntransition temperature between the Ba and Sr compounds is consistent with\nexperiment, confirming the assignment of the compounds to the Hund's metal\nfamily of materials, and also confirming the appropriateness of the values for\nthe interaction parameters previously estimated and the appropriateness of the\nsingle-site dynamical mean field approximation for these materials. The results\nprovide insights into the origin of magnetism and the role of the van Hove\nsingularity in the physics of Hund's metals.\n", "  Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, is currently used by\nover $500M$ users and is considered to be a proxy of Chinese social life. In\nthis study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese\nlanguage Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture:\npeople within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions\nand those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. We first\npropose a simple ad-hoc algorithm to identify topics of Tweets and Weibo.\nDifferent from previous works on micro-message topic detection, our algorithm\nconsiders topics of the same contents but with different \\#tags. Our algorithm\ncan also detect topics for Tweets and Weibos without any \\#tags. Using a large\ncorpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January\n$1$ to December $31$, $2012$, we obtain a list of topics using clustered \\#tags\nthat we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that\nthere are no common entries among the Top $100$ most popular topics.\nFurthermore, only $9.2\\%$ of tweets correspond to the Top $1000$ topics on Sina\nWeibo platform, and conversely only $4.4\\%$ of weibos were found to discuss the\nmost popular Twitter topics. Our results reveal significant differences in\nsocial attention on the two platforms, with most popular topics on Sina Weibo\nrelating to entertainment while most tweets corresponded to cultural or\npolitical contents that is practically non existent in Sina Weibo.\n", "  In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) system, the charge density wave (CDW)\ntransition temperature TCDW is usually lower than the mean-field-theory\npredicted TMF and a CDW fluctuation region exists between them. Here, we\ninvestigate the physical properties of PdTeI single crystal containing quasi-1D\nPdTe chains. Surprisingly, we find that the carrier concentration decreases\ngradually before the long-range CDW ordering state occurring at T1 ~ 110 K,\nreflecting the existence of strong CDW fluctuation with possible pseudogap\nstate at T >> T1 because of dynamic charge separation of Pd ions (Pd3+ -> Pd2+\n+ Pd4+). Moreover, the sliding CDW state appears below T2 ~ 6 K. Combined such\nlow T2 with the feature of multiple quasi-1D bands, PdTeI exhibits exotic\ncrossover behavior from negative to huge positive magnetoresistance under\nmagnetic field and field-induced localization. Thus, PdTeI provides a novel\nplatform for studying the CDW fluctuation and the interplay between magnetic\nfield and CDW state.\n", "  The implementation and engineering of bright and coherent solid state quantum\nlight sources is key for the realization of both on chip and remote quantum\nnetworks. Despite tremendous efforts for more than 15 years, the combination of\nthese two key prerequisites in a single, potentially scalable device is a major\nchallenge. Here, we report on the observation of bright and coherent single\nphoton emission generated via pulsed, resonance fluorescence conditions from a\nsingle quantum dot (QD) deterministically centered in a micropillar cavity\ndevice via cryogenic optical lithography. The brightness of the QD fluorescence\nis greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the pillar,\nleading to an overall device efficiency of $\\eta=(74\\pm4)~\\%$ for a single\nphoton emission as pure as $g^{(2)}(0)=0.0092\\pm0.0004$. The combination of\nlarge Purcell enhancement and resonant pumping conditions allows us to observe\na two-photon wave packet overlap up to $\\nu=(88\\pm3)~\\%$\n", "  We study a generalization of higher gauge theory which makes use of\ngeneralized geometry and seems to be closely related to double field theory.\nThe local kinematical data of this theory is captured by morphisms of graded\nmanifolds between the canonical exact Courant Lie 2-algebroid $TM\\oplus T^*M$\nover some manifold $M$ and a semistrict gauge Lie 2-algebra. We discuss\ngeneralized curvatures and their infinitesimal gauge transformations. Finite\ngauge transformation as well as global kinematical data are then obtained from\nprincipal 2-bundles over 2-spaces. As dynamical principle, we consider first\nthe canonical Chern-Simons action for such a gauge theory. We then show that a\npreviously proposed 3-Lie algebra model for the six-dimensional (2,0) theory is\nvery naturally interpreted as a generalized higher gauge theory.\n", "  A very plausible explanation for the recently observed diphoton excess at the\n13 TeV LHC is a (pseudo)scalar with mass around 750 GeV, which couples to a\ngluon pair and to a photon pair through loops involving vector-like quarks\n(VLQs). To accommodate the observed rate, the required Yukawa couplings tend to\nbe large. A large Yukawa coupling would rapidly run up with the scale and\nquickly reach the perturbativity bound, indicating that new physics, possibly\nwith a strong dynamics origin, is near by. The case becomes stronger especially\nif the ATLAS observation of a large width persists. In this paper we study the\nimplication on the scale of new physics from the 750 GeV diphoton excess using\nthe method of renormalization group running with careful treatment of different\ncontributions and perturbativity criterion. Our results suggest that the scale\nof new physics is generically not much larger than the TeV scale, in particular\nif the width of the hinted (pseudo)scalar is large. Introducing multiple copies\nof VLQs, lowing the VLQ masses and enlarging VLQ electric charges help reduce\nthe required Yukawa couplings and can push the cutoff scale to higher values.\nNevertheless, if the width of the 750 GeV resonance turns out to be larger than\nabout 1 GeV, it is very hard to increase the cutoff scale beyond a few TeVs.\nThis is a strong hint that new particles in addition to the 750 GeV resonance\nand the vector-like quarks should be around the TeV scale.\n", "  We consider an effective viscous pressure as the result of a backreaction of\ninhomogeneities within Buchert's formalism. The use of an effective metric with\na time-dependent curvature radius allows us to calculate the luminosity\ndistance of the backreaction model. This quantity is different from its\ncounterpart for a \"conventional\" spatially flat bulk viscous fluid universe.\nBoth expressions are tested against the SNIa data of the Union2.1 sample with\nonly marginally different results for the distance-redshift relation and in\naccordance with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Future observations are expected to be\nable to discriminate among these models on the basis of indirect measurements\nof the curvature evolution.\n", "  The strongly-contracted variant of second order N -electron valence state\nperturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an efficient perturbative method to treat\ndynamic correlation without the problems of intruder states or level shifts,\nwhile the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) provides the capability\nto tackle static correlation in large active spaces. We present a combination\nof the DMRG and strongly-contracted NEVPT2 (DMRG-SC-NEVPT2) that uses an\nefficient algorithm to compute high order reduced density matrices from DMRG\nwave functions. The capabilities of DMRG-SC-NEVPT2 are demonstrated on\ncalculations of the chromium dimer potential energy curve at the basis set\nlimit, and the excitation energies of poly-p-phenylene vinylene trimer\n(PPV(n=3)).\n", "  Integrated fiducial cross sections for the production of four leptons via the\nH to 4l decays (l = e, mu) are measured in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8\nTeV. Measurements are performed with data corresponding to integrated\nluminosities of 5.1 inverse femtobarns at 7 TeV, and 19.7 inverse femtobarns at\n8 TeV, collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Differential cross\nsections are measured using the 8 TeV data, and are determined as functions of\nthe transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, accompanying\njet multiplicity, transverse momentum of the leading jet, and difference in\nrapidity between the Higgs boson candidate and the leading jet. A measurement\nof the Z to 4l cross section, and its ratio to the H to 4l cross section is\nalso performed. All cross sections are measured within a fiducial phase space\ndefined by the requirements on lepton kinematics and event topology. The\nintegrated H to 4l fiducial cross section is measured to be 0.56 +0.67-0.44\n(stat) +0.21-0.06 (syst) fb at 7 TeV, and 1.11 +0.41-0.35 (stat) +0.14-0.10\n(syst) fb at 8 TeV. The measurements are found to be compatible with\ntheoretical calculations based on the standard model.\n", "  We demonstrate that the partial entropy of a two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) exhibits quantized peaks at resonances between the chemical potential\nand electron levels of size quantization. In the limit of no scattering, the\npeaks depend only on the subband quantization number and are independent on\nmaterial parameters, shape of the confining potential, electron effective mass\nand temperature. The quantization of partial entropy is a signature of a\ntopological phase transition in a 2DEG. In the presence of stationary disorder,\nthe magnitude of peaks decreases. Its deviation from the quantized values is a\ndirect measure of the disorder induced smearing of the electronic density of\nstates.\n", "  Cosmic ray interactions that produce high-energy neutrinos also inevitably\ngenerate high-energy gamma rays, which finally contribute to the diffuse\nhigh-energy gamma-ray background after they escape the sources. It was recently\nfound that, the high flux of neutrinos at $\\sim30$ TeV detected by IceCube lead\nto a cumulative gamma-ray flux exceeding the Fermi isotropic gamma-ray\nbackground at 10-100 GeV, implying that the neutrinos are produced by hidden\nsources of cosmic rays, where GeV-TeV gamma-rays are not transparent. Here we\nsuggest that relativistic jets in tidal disruption events (TDEs) of\nsupermassive black holes are such hidden sources. We consider the jet\npropagation in an extended,optically thick envelope around the black hole,\nwhich is resulted from the ejected material during the disruption. While\npowerful jets can break free from the envelope, less powerful jets would be\nchoked inside the envelope. The jets accelerate cosmic rays through internal\nshocks or reverse shocks and further produce neutrinos via interaction with the\nsurrounding dense medium or photons. All three TDE jets discovered so far are\nnot detected by Fermi/LAT, suggesting that GeV-TeV gamma-rays are absorbed in\nthese jets. The cumulative neutrino flux from TDE jets can account for the\nneutrino flux observed by IceCube at PeV energies and may also account for the\nhigher flux at $\\sim30$ TeV if less powerful, choked jets are present in the\nmajority of TDEs.\n", "  We study numerically the saddle point structure of two-dimensional (2D)\nlattice gauge theory, represented by the Gross-Witten-Wadia unitary matrix\nmodel. The saddle points are in general complex-valued, even though the\noriginal integration variables and action are real. We confirm the\ntrans-series/instanton gas structure in the weak-coupling phase, and identify a\nnew complex-saddle interpretation of non-perturbative effects in the\nstrong-coupling phase. In both phases, eigenvalue tunneling refers to\neigenvalues moving off the real interval, into the complex plane, and the\nweak-to-strong coupling phase transition is driven by saddle condensation.\n", "  We extend the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker probe formalism for conductances to the\nhigh bias regime, and study the effects of environmentally-induced elastic and\ninelastic scattering on charge current in single molecule junctions, focusing\non high-bias effects. The probe technique phenomenologically incorporates\nincoherent elastic and inelastic effects to the fully coherent case, mimicking\na rich physical environment at trivial cost. We further identify\nenvironmentally-induced mechanisms which generate an asymmetry in the current,\nmanifested as a weak diode behavior. This rectifying behavior, found in two\ntypes of molecular junction models, is absent in the coherent-elastic limit,\nand is only active in the case with incoherent-inelastic scattering. Our work\nillustrates that in the low bias - linear response regime, the commonly used\n\"dephasing probe\" (mimicking only elastic decoherence effects) operates nearly\nindistinguishably from a \"voltage probe\" (admitting inelastic-dissipative\neffects). However, these probes realize fundamentally distinct $I$-$V$\ncharacteristics at high biases, reflecting the central roles of dissipation and\ninelastic scattering processes on molecular electronic transport\nfar-from-equilibrium.\n", "  We present an improved event-level likelihood formalism for including\nneutrino telescope data in global fits to new physics. We derive limits on\nspin-dependent dark matter-proton scattering by employing the new formalism in\na re-analysis of data from the 79-string IceCube search for dark matter\nannihilation in the Sun, including explicit energy information for each event.\nThe new analysis excludes a number of models in the weak-scale minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM) for the first time. This work is\naccompanied by the public release of the 79-string IceCube data, as well as an\nassociated computer code for applying the new likelihood to arbitrary dark\nmatter models.\n", "  We consider the separate spin evolution of electrons and positrons in\nelectron-positron and electron-positron-ion plasmas. We consider oblique\npropagating longitudinal waves in this systems. We report presence of the\nspin-electron acoustic waves and their dispersion dependencies. In\nelectron-positron plasmas, similarly to the electron-ion plasmas, we find one\nspin-electron acoustic wave (SEAW) at propagation parallel or perpendicular to\nthe external field and two spin-electron acoustic waves at the oblique\npropagation. At the parallel or perpendicular propagation of the longitudinal\nwaves in electron-positron-ion plasmas we find four branches: the Langmuir\nwave, the positron-acoustic wave and pair of waves having spin nature, they are\nthe SEAW and, as we called it, spin-electron-positron acoustic wave (SEPAW). At\nthe oblique propagation we find eight longitudinal waves: the Langmuir wave,\nTrivelpiece-Gould wave, pair of positron-acoustic waves, pair of SEAWs, and\npair of SEPAWs. Thus, for the first time, we report existence of the second\npositron-acoustic wave existing at the oblique propagation and existence of\nSEPAWs.\n", "  The recent diphoton excess signal at an invariant mass of 750 GeV can be\ninterpreted in the framework of left-right symmetric models with additional\nscalar singlets and vector-like fermions. We propose a minimal scenario for\nsuch a purpose. Extending the LRSM framework to include these new vector-like\nfermionic fields, on the other hand, results in interesting phenomenological\nimplications for the LRSM fermion masses and mixing. Furthermore, existence of\nsuch vector-like fermions can also have interesting implications for\nbaryogenesis and the dark matter sector. The introduction of a real bi-triplet\nscalar which contains a potential DM candidate will allow the gauge couplings\nto unify at $\\approx 10^{17.7}$ GeV.\n", "  Detecting polarized light from self-luminous exoplanets has the potential to\nprovide key information about rotation, surface gravity, cloud grain size, and\ncloud coverage. While field brown dwarfs with detected polarized emission are\ncommon, no exoplanet or substellar companion has yet been detected in polarized\nlight. With the advent of high contrast imaging spectro-polarimeters such as\nGPI and SPHERE, such a detection may now be possible with careful treatment of\ninstrumental polarization. In this paper, we present 28 minutes of $H$-band GPI\npolarimetric observations of the benchmark T5.5 companion HD 19467 B. We detect\nno polarization signal from the target, and place an upper limit on the degree\nof linear polarization of $p_{\\text{CL}99.73\\%} \\leq 2.4\\%$. We discuss our\nresults in the context of T dwarf cloud models and photometric variability.\n", "  We describe the full nonlinear development of the superradiant instability\nfor a charged massless scalar field, coupled to general relativity and\nelectromagnetism, in the vicinity of a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole. The\npresence of the negative cosmological constant provides a natural context for\nconsidering perfectly reflecting boundary conditions and studying the dynamics\nas the scalar field interacts repeatedly with the black hole. At early times,\nsmall superradiant perturbations grow as expected from linearized studies.\nBackreaction then causes the black hole to lose charge and mass until the\nperturbation becomes nonsuperradiant, with the final state described by a\nstable hairy black hole. For large gauge coupling, the instability extracts a\nlarge amount of charge per unit mass, resulting in greater entropy increase. We\ndiscuss the implications of the observed behavior for the general problem of\nsuperradiance in black hole spacetimes.\n", "  We study the transverse single-spin asymmetry with a $\\sin\\phi_S$ modulation\nin semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. Particularly, we consider the case\nin which the transverse momentum of the final state hadron is integrated out.\nThus, the asymmetry is merely contributed by the coupling of the transversity\ndistribution function $h_1(x)$ and the twist-3 collinear fragmentation function\n$\\tilde{H}(z)$. Using the available parametrization of $h_1(x)$ from SIDIS data\nand the recent extracted result for $\\tilde{H}(z)$, we predict the $\\sin\\phi_S$\nasymmetry for charged and neutral pion production at an Electron Ion Collider.\nWe find that the asymmetry is sizable and could be measured. We also study the\nimpact of the leading-order QCD evolution effect and find that it affects the\n$\\sin\\phi_S$ asymmetry at EIC considerably.\n", "  We investigate vacuum statistics and stability in random axionic landscapes.\nFor this purpose we developed an algorithm for a quick evaluation of the\ntunneling action, which in most cases is accurate within 10%. We find that\nstability of a vacuum is strongly correlated with its energy density, with\nlifetime rapidly growing as the energy density is decreased. The probability\n$P(B)$ for a vacuum to have a tunneling action $B$ greater than a given value\ndeclines as a slow power law in $B$. This is in sharp contrast with the studies\nof random quartic potentials, which found a fast exponential decline of $P(B)$.\nOur results suggest that the total number of relatively stable vacua (say, with\n$B> 100$) grows exponentially with the number of fields $N$ and can get\nextremely large for $N\\gtrsim 100$. The problem with this kind of model is that\nthe stable vacua are concentrated near the absolute minimum of the potential,\nso the observed value of the cosmological constant cannot be explained without\nfine-tuning. To address this difficulty, we consider a modification of the\nmodel, where the axions acquire a quadratic mass term, due to their mixing with\n4-form fields. This results in a larger landscape with a much broader\ndistribution of vacuum energies. The number of relatively stable vacua in such\nmodels can still be extremely large.\n", "  We performed a Raman scattering study of Na$_2$Ti$_2$As$_2$O. We identified a\nsymmetry breaking structural transition at around $T_s = 150$ K, which matches\na large bump in the electrical resistivity. Several new peaks are detected\nbelow that transition. Combined with first-principles calculations, our\npolarization-dependent measurements suggest a charge instability driven lattice\ndistortion along one of the Ti-O bonds that breaks the 4-fold symmetry and more\nthan doubles the unit cell.\n", "  General-relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations coupled with the\ncalculation of geodesics in the Kerr spacetime are an essential tool for\ndetermining the images, spectra and light curves from matter in the vicinity of\nblack holes. Such studies are especially important for ongoing and upcoming\nmillimeter/submillimeter (mm/sub-mm) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations of the supermassive black holes at the centres of Sgr A^{*} and\nM87. To this end we introduce Odyssey, a Graphics Processing Unit(GPU)-based\ncode for ray tracing and radiative transfer in the Kerr spacetime. On a single\nGPU, the performance of Odyssey can exceed 1 nanosecond per photon, per\nRunge-Kutta integration step. Odyssey is publicly available, fast, accurate,\nand flexible enough to be modified to suit the specific needs of new users.\nAlong with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) powered by a video-accelerated\ndisplay architecture, we also present an educational software tool,\nOdyssey_Edu, for showing in real time how null geodesics around a Kerr black\nhole vary as a function of black hole spin and angle of incidence onto the\nblack hole.\n", "  The high energy spectrum of alpha particles emitted from a single isotope\nuniformly contaminating a bulk solid has a flat energy spectrum with a high end\ncutoff energy equal to the maximal alpha kinetic energy ($T_{\\alpha}$) of the\ndecay. In this flat region of the spectrum, we show the surface rate\n$r_b\\text{\\,(Bq/keV-cm}^{2})$ arising from a bulk alpha contamination $\\rho_b$\n(Bq/cm$^3$) from a single isotope is given by $r_b =\\rho_b \\Delta R/ 4 \\Delta E\n$, where $\\Delta E = E_1-E_2>0\\ $ is the energy interval considered (keV) in\nthe flat region of the spectrum and $\\Delta R = R_2-R_1$, where $R_2$ ($R_1$)\nis the amount of the bulk material (cm) necessary to degrade the energy of the\nalpha from $T_{\\alpha}$ to $E_2$ ($E_1$). We compare our calculation to a rate\nmeasurement of alphas from $^{147}$Sm, ($15.32\\%\\,\\pm\\,0.03\\%$ of Sm($nat$) and\nhalf life of $(1.06\\,\\pm\\,0.01)\\times\\,10^{11} \\text{yr}$, and find good\nagreement, with the ratio between prediction to measurement of $100.2\\%\\pm\n1.6\\%\\,\\text{(stat)}\\pm 2.1\\%\\,\\text{(sys)}$. We derive the condition for the\nflat spectrum, and also calculate the relationship between the decay rate\nmeasured at the surface for a [near] surface contamination with an exponential\ndependence on depth and an a second case of an alpha source with a thin\novercoat. While there is excellent agreement between our implementation of the\nsophisticated Monte Carlo program SRIM and our intuitive model in all cases,\nboth fail to describe the measured energy distribution of a $^{148}$Gd alpha\nsource with a thin ($\\sim200\\mu$g/cm$^2$) Au overcoat. We discuss possible\norigins of the disagreement and suggest avenues for future study.\n", "  We look for correlated changes in stellar mass and star formation rate along\nfilaments in the cosmic web by examining the stellar masses and UV-derived star\nformation rates (SFR) of 1,799 ungrouped and unpaired spiral galaxies that\nreside in filaments. We devise multiple distance metrics to characterise the\ncomplex geometry of filaments, and find that galaxies closer to the cylindrical\ncentre of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near\nthe periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. In addition, these\nperipheral spiral galaxies have higher specific star formation rates (SSFR) at\na given mass. Complementing our sample of filament spiral galaxies with spiral\ngalaxies in tendrils and voids, we find that the average SFR of these objects\nin different large scale environments are similar to each other with the\nprimary discriminant in SFR being stellar mass, in line with previous works.\nHowever, the distributions of SFRs are found to vary with large-scale\nenvironment. Our results thus suggest a model in which in addition to stellar\nmass as the primary discriminant, the large-scale environment is imprinted in\nthe SFR as a second order effect. Furthermore, our detailed results for\nfilament galaxies suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto\nfilaments is primarily in an orthogonal direction. Overall, we find our results\nto be in line with theoretical expectations of the thermodynamic properties of\nthe intergalactic medium in different large-scale environments.\n", "  The Johnson graph $J(n,k)$ is defined by $n$ symbols, where vertices are\n$k$-element subsets of the symbols, and vertices are adjacent if they differ in\nexactly one symbol. In particular, $J(n,1)$ is the complete graph $K_n$, and\n$J(n,2)$ is the strongly regular triangular graph $T_n$, both of which are\nknown to support fast spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk. In this\npaper, we prove that $J(n,3)$, which is the $n$-tetrahedral graph, also\nsupports fast search. In the process, we show that a change of basis is needed\nfor degenerate perturbation theory to accurately describe the dynamics. This\nmethod can also be applied to general Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$ with fixed $k$.\n", "  In this paper we study the causes of the reported mass-dependence of the\nslope of SFR-M* relation, the so-called \"Main Sequence\" of star-forming\ngalaxies, and discuss its implication on the physical processes that shaped the\nstar formation history of massive galaxies over cosmic time. We use the CANDELS\nnear-IR imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to perform the bulge-to-disk\ndecomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time the slope of\nthe SFR-Mdisk relation at z=1. We find that this relation follows very closely\nthe shape of the SFR-M* correlation, still with a pronounced flattening at the\nhigh-mass end. This is clearly excluding, at least at z=1, the secular growth\nof quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change\nof slope of the Main Sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data available in\nthe CANDELS field, we estimate the total gas mass and the star formation\nefficiency at different positions on the SFR-M* relation. We find that the\nrelatively low SFRs observed in massive galaxies (M* > 5e10 Msun) are caused by\na decreased star formation efficiency, by up to a factor of 3 as compared to\nlower stellar mass galaxies, and not by a reduced gas content. The trend at the\nlowest masses is likely linked to the dominance of atomic over molecular gas.\nWe argue that this stellar-mass-dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of\nthe Main Sequence since z=1.5, hence over 70% of the Hubble time. The drop of\nSFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe (M* > 2e10 Msun) and is not\npresent at z=2. Altogether this provides evidence for a slow downfall of the\nstar formation efficiency in massive Main Sequence galaxies. The resulting loss\nof star formation is found to be rising starting from z=2 to reach a level\ncomparable to the mass growth of the quiescent population by z=1. We finally\ndiscuss the possible physical origin of this phenomenon.\n", "  Coronal bright points (CBPs) and jets are ubiquitous small-scale brightenings\nthat are often associated with each other. In this paper, we report our\nmultiwavelength observations of two groups of homologous jets. The first group\nwas observed by the EUVI aboard the behind STEREO spacecraft in 171 {\\AA} and\n304 {\\AA} on 2014 September 10, from a location where data from the SDO could\nnot observe. The jets (J1$-$J6) recurred for six times with intervals of 5$-$15\nminutes. They originated from the same primary CBP (BP1) and propagated in the\nnortheast direction along large-scale, closed coronal loops. Two of the jets\n(J3 and J6) produced sympathetic CBPs (BP2 and BP3) after reaching the remote\nfootpoints of the loops. The time delays between the peak times of BP1 and BP2\n(BP3) are 240$\\pm$75 s (300$\\pm75$ s). The jets were not coherent. Instead,\nthey were composed of bright and compact blobs. The sizes and apparent\nvelocities of the blobs are 4.5$-$9 Mm and 140$-$380 km/s, respectively. The\narrival times of the multiple blobs in the jets at the far-end of the loops\nindicate that the sympathetic CBPs are caused by jet flows rather than thermal\nconduction fronts. The second group was observed by the AIA aboard SDO in\nvarious wavelengths on 2010 August 3. Similar to the first group, the jets\noriginated from a short-lived bright point (BP) at the boundary of AR 11092 and\npropagated along a small-scale, closed loop before flowing into the active\nregion. Several tiny blobs with sizes of $\\sim$1.7 Mm and apparent velocity of\n~238 km/s were identified in the jets. We carried out the DEM inversions to\ninvestigate the temperatures of the blobs, finding that the blobs were\nmultithermal with average temperature of 1.8$-$3.1 MK.\n", "  Star-planet tidal interactions may result in the excitation of inertial waves\nin the convective region of stars. In low-mass stars, their dissipation plays a\nprominent role in the long-term orbital evolution of short-period planets.\nTurbulent convection can sustain differential rotation in their envelope, with\nan equatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration, which can modify\nthe waves' propagation properties. We explore in this first paper the general\npropagation properties of free linear inertial waves in a differentially\nrotating homogeneous fluid inside a spherical shell. We assume that the angular\nvelocity background flow depends on the latitudinal coordinate only, close to\nwhat is expected in the external convective envelope of low-mass stars. We use\ni) an analytical approach in the inviscid case to get the dispersion relation,\nfrom which we compute the characteristic trajectories along which energy\npropagates. This allows us to study the existence of attractor cycles and infer\nthe different families of inertial modes; ii) high-resolution numerical\ncalculations based on a spectral method for the viscous problem. We find that\nmodes that propagate in the whole shell (D modes) behave the same way as with\nsolid-body rotation. However, another family of inertial modes exists (DT\nmodes), which can propagate only in a restricted part of the convective zone.\nOur study shows that they are less common than D modes and that the\ncharacteristic rays and shear layers often focus towards a wedge - or\npoint-like attractor. More importantly, we find that for non-axisymmetric\noscillation modes, shear layers may cross a corotation resonance with a local\naccumulation of kinetic energy. Their damping rate scales very differently from\nwhat we obtain for standard D modes and we show an example where it is\nindependent of viscosity (Ekman number) in the astrophysical regime in which it\nis small.\n", "  Metal-semiconductor contacts are a pillar of modern semiconductor technology.\nHistorically, their microscopic understanding has been hampered by the\ninability of traditional analytical and numerical methods to fully capture the\ncomplex physics governing their operating principles. Here we introduce an\natomistic approach based on density functional theory and non-equilibrium\nGreen's function, which includes all the relevant ingredients required to model\nrealistic metal-semiconductor interfaces and allows for a direct comparison\nbetween theory and experiments via I-V bias curves simulations. We apply this\nmethod to characterize an Ag/Si interface relevant for photovoltaic\napplications and study the rectifying-to-Ohmic transition as function of the\nsemiconductor doping.We also demonstrate that the standard \"Activation Energy\"\nmethod for the analysis of I-V bias data might be inaccurate for non-ideal\ninterfaces as it neglects electron tunneling, and that finite-size atomistic\nmodels have problems in describing these interfaces in the presence of doping,\ndue to a poor representation of space-charge effects. Conversely, the present\nmethod deals effectively with both issues, thus representing a valid\nalternative to conventional procedures for the accurate characterization of\nmetal-semiconductor interfaces.\n", "  Quarter-wave OLEDS are microcavity devices that can operate in the low\nfinesse limit and achieve high efficiency (> 300 lm/W) by using interference to\nreduce the onset current for the transition to stimulated emission. In this\nwork we study the transition to stimulated emission and compare the kinetics\nand electrical properties of conventional and quarter-wave devices. We show\nthat suppression of spontaneous emission into the vertical mode can result in a\nsharp transition to stimulated emission at (\\gamma /eV)I ~ N_se/\\tau_sp where\nN_se/\\tau_sp is determined by optical parameters, and we find a previously\nobserved electrical signature for the transition where the excited state\npopulation becomes fixed at low current density. We then study the role of loss\nmechanisms in the quarter-wave configuration and conclude with some\nrequirements for practical device.\n", "  We apply worldline methods to the study of vacuum polarisation effects in\nplane wave backgrounds, in both scalar and spinor QED. We calculate\nhelicity-flip probabilities to one loop order and treated exactly in the\nbackground field, and provide a toolkit of methods for use in investigations of\nhigher-order processes. We also discuss the connections between the worldline,\nS-matrix, and lightfront approaches to vacuum polarisation effects.\n", "  Reliable historical records of total solar irradiance (TSI) are needed for\nclimate change attribution and research to assess the extent to which long-term\nvariations in the Sun's radiant energy incident on the Earth may exacerbate (or\nmitigate) the more dominant warming in recent centuries due to increasing\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases. We investigate potential impacts of the new\nSunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) sunspot-number time\nseries on model reconstructions of TSI. In contemporary TSI records, variations\non time scales longer than about a day are dominated by the opposing effects of\nsunspot darkening and facular brightening. These two surface magnetic features,\nretrieved either from direct observations or from solar activity proxies, are\ncombined in TSI models to reproduce the current TSI observational record.\nIndices that manifest solar-surface magnetic activity, in particular the\nsunspot-number record, then enable the reconstruction of historical TSI.\nRevisions to the sunspot-number record therefore affect the magnitude and\ntemporal structure of TSI variability on centennial time scales according to\nthe model reconstruction methodologies. We estimate the effects of the new\nSILSO record on two widely used TSI reconstructions, namely the NRLTSI2 and the\nSATIRE models. We find that the SILSO record has little effect on either model\nafter 1885 but leads to greater amplitude solar-cycle fluctuations in TSI\nreconstructions prior, suggesting many 18th and 19th century cycles could be\nsimilar in amplitude to those of the current Modern Maximum. TSI records based\non the revised sunspot data do not suggest a significant change in Maunder\nMinimum TSI values, and comparing that era to the present we find only very\nsmall potential differences in estimated solar contributions to climate with\nthis new sunspot record.\n", "  By using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent, variables formalism, we\nconsider a recently proposed topologically massive $U{\\left( 1 \\right)_{\\cal\nW}} \\times U{(1)_{\\cal Y}}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs theory in $2+1$ dimensions. In\nparticular, we inspect the impact of a Chern-Simons mixing term between two\nAbelian gauge fields on physical observables. We pursue our investigation by\nanalysing the model in two different situations. In the first case, where we\nintegrate out the massive excitation and consider an effective model for the\nmassless field, we show that the interaction energy contains a linear term\nleading to the confinement of static charge probes along with a screening\ncontribution. The second situation, where the massless field can be exactly\nintegrated over with its constraint duly taken into account, the interesting\nfeature is that the resulting effective model describes a purely screening\nphase, without any trace of a confining regime.\n", "  The finite temperature dynamics of the Dyson hierarchical classical spins\nmodels is studied via real-space renormalization rules concerning the couplings\nand the relaxation times. For the ferromagnetic model involving Long-Ranged\ncoupling $J(r) \\propto r^{-1-\\sigma}$ in the region $1/2<\\sigma<1$ where there\nexists a non-mean-field-like thermal Ferromagnetic-Paramagnetic transition, the\nRG flows are explicitly solved: the characteristic relaxation time $\\tau(L)$\nfollows the critical power-law $\\tau(L)\\propto L^{z_c(\\sigma)} $ at the phase\ntransition and the activated law $\\ln \\tau(L)\\propto L^{\\psi} $ with\n$\\psi=1-\\sigma$ in the ferromagnetic phase. For the Spin-Glass model involving\nrandom Long-Ranged couplings of variance $\\overline{J^2(r)} \\propto\nr^{-2\\sigma}$ in the region $2/3<\\sigma<1$ where there exists a\nnon-mean-field-like thermal SpinGlass-Paramagnetic transition, the coupled RG\nflows of the couplings and of the relaxation times are studied numerically :\nthe relaxation time $\\tau(L)$ follows some power-law $\\tau(L)\\propto\nL^{z_c(\\sigma)} $ at criticality and the activated law $\\ln \\tau(L)\\propto\nL^{\\psi} $ in the Spin-Glass phase with the dynamical exponent\n$\\psi=1-\\sigma=\\theta$ coinciding with the droplet exponent governing the flow\nof the couplings $J(L) \\propto L^{\\theta} $.\n", "  We provide a possible explanation of a 750 GeV diphoton excess recently\nreported by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in the context of\nphenomenological spin-2 resonance scenarios, where the independent effective\ncouplings of the resonance with gluons, quarks and photons are considered. We\nfind a parameter region where the excess can be accounted for without\nconflicting with dijet constraints. We also show that the kinematical\ndistributions might help to determine the couplings to gluons and quarks.\n", "  The true muonium $(\\mu\\bar{\\mu})$ bound state presents an interesting test of\nlight-cone quantization techniques. In addition to exhibiting the standard\nproblems of handling non-perturbative calculations, true muonium requires\ncorrect treatment of $e\\bar{e}$ Fock-state contributions. Having previously\nproduced a crude model of true muonium using the method of iterated resolvents,\nour current work has focused on the inclusion of the box diagrams to improve\nthe cutoff-dependent issues of the model. Further, a parallel computer code,\nTMSWIFT, allowing for smaller numerical uncertainties, has been developed. This\nwork focuses on the current state of these efforts to develop a model of true\nmuonium that is testable at near-term experiments.\n", "  We use single or few Cs atoms as thermometer for an ultracold, thermal Rb\ncloud. Observing the thermometer atoms' thermalization with the cold gas using\nspatially resolved fluorescence detection, we find an interesting situation,\nwhere a fraction of thermometer atoms thermalizes with the cloud while the\nother fraction remains unaffected. We compare release-recapture measurements of\nthe thermometer atoms to Monte-Carlo simulations while correcting for the\nnon-thermalized fraction, and recover the cold cloud's temperature. The\ntemperatures obtained are verified by independent time-of-flight measurements\nof the cold cloud's temperature. We also check the reliability of our\nsimulations by first numerically modelling the unperturbed in-trap motion of\nsingle atoms in absence of the cold cloud, and second by performing\nrelease-recapture thermometry on the cold cloud itself. Our findings pave the\nway for local temperature probing of quantum systems in non-equilibrium\nsituations.\n", "  We report here an all-sky soft gamma-ray source catalog based on IBIS\nobservations performed during the first 1000 orbits of INTEGRAL. The database\nfor the construction of the source list consists of all good quality data\navailable from launch in 2002 up to the end of 2010. This corresponds to\n$\\sim$110 Ms of scientific public observations with a concentrated coverage on\nthe Galactic Plane and extragalactic deep exposures. This new catalog includes\n939 sources above a 4.5 sigma significance threshold detected in the 17-100 keV\nenergy band, of which 120 represent previously undiscovered soft gamma-ray\nemitters. The source positions are determined, mean fluxes are provided in two\nmain energy bands, and are reported together with the overall source exposure.\nIndicative levels of variability are provided, and outburst times and durations\nare given for transient sources. Comparison is made with previous IBIS\ncatalogs, and those from other similar missions.\n", "  Despite fermion doubling, a two-dimensional quasi-relativistic spin-1/2\nsystem can still lead to true fractionalization of electrical charge, when a\nmassive ordered phase supports a \"half-vortex\". Such topological defect is\npossible when the order parameter in form of Dirac mass is described by two\n$U(1)$ angles, and each of them winds by an angle $\\pi$ around a point. We\ndemonstrate that such a mass configuration in an eight-dimensional Dirac\nHamiltonian exhibits only a single bound zero mode, and therefore binds the\ncharge of $e/2$. In graphene, for example, such an ordered phase is provided by\nthe easy-plane spin-triplet Kekule valence bond solid. We argue that an\napplication of an in-plane magnetic field can cause an excitonic instability\ntoward such ordered phase, even for weak repulsion, when the on-site,\nnearest-neighbor and second neighbor components of it are of comparable\nstrengths.\n", "  Although the topological order is known as a quantum order in quantum\nmany-body systems, it seems that there is not a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween topological phases and quantum phases. As a well-known example, it has\nbeen shown that all one-dimensional (1D) quantum phases are topologically\ntrivial\\cite{spt}. By such a fact, it seems a challenging task to understand\nwhen a quantum phase transition between different topological models\nnecessarily reveals different topological classes of them. In this paper, we\nmake an attempt to consider this problem by studying a phase transition between\ntwo different quantum phases which belong to a universal topological phase. We\ndefine a Hamiltonian which describes an interpolation between the toric code\nmodel with $Z_2$ topological order and the color code model with $Z_2 \\times\nZ_2$ topological order on a hexagonal lattice. We show such a model is exactly\nmapped to many copies of 1D quantum Ising model in transverse field by\nrewriting the Hamiltonian in a new complete basis. Consequently, we show that\nthe universal topological phase of the color code model and the toric code\nmodel reflects in the 1D nature of the phase transition. We also consider the\nexpectation value of Wilson loops by a perturbative calculation and show that\nbehavior of the Wilson loop captures the non-topological nature of the quantum\nphase transition. The result on the point of phase transition also show that\nthe color code model is strongly robust against the toric code model.\n", "  Let $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ be quantum states and $(\\rho_1,\\rho_2) \\mapsto D(\\rho_1,\n\\rho_2)$ be a scalar function such as the trace norm, the fidelity, and the\nrelative entropy, etc. We determine optimal bounds for $D(\\rho_1,\n\\Phi(\\rho_2))$ for $\\Phi \\in \\mathcal{S}$ for different class of functions\n$D(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of unitary quantum channels,\nthe set of mixed unitary channels, the set of unital quantum channels, and the\nset of all quantum channels.\n", "  A multi-channel atomic magnetometer operating in an unshielded environment is\ndescribed and characterised. The magnetometer is based on D1 optical pumping\nand D2 polarimetry of Cs vapour contained in gas-buffered cells. Several\ntechnical implementations are described and discussed in detail. The\ndemonstrated sensitivity of the setup is 100fT/Hz^1/2 when operating in the\ndifference mode.\n", "  We study the possibility of using multilevel algorithms for the computation\nof correlation functions of gradient flow observables. For each point in the\ncorrelation function an approximate flow is defined which depends only on links\nin a subset of the lattice. Together with a local action this allows for\nindependent updates and consequently a convergence of the Monte Carlo process\nfaster than the inverse square root of the number of measurements. We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of this idea in the correlation functions of the\ntopological charge and the energy density.\n", "  Stellar metallicity -- as a probe of the metallicity of proto-planetary disks\n-- is an important ingredient for giant planet formation, likely through its\neffect on the timescales in which rocky/icy planet cores can form. Giant\nplanets have been found to be more frequent around metal-rich stars, in\nagreement with predictions based on the core-accretion theory. In the\nmetal-poor regime, however, the frequency of planets, especially low-mass\nplanets, and how it depends on metallicity are still largely unknown. As part\nof a planet search programme focused on metal-poor stars, we study the targets\nfrom this survey that were observed with HARPS on more than 75 nights. The main\ngoals are to assess the presence of low-mass planets and provide a first\nestimate of the frequency of Neptunes and super-Earths around metal-poor stars.\nWe perform a systematic search for planetary companions, both by analysing the\nperiodograms of the radial-velocities and by comparing, in a\nstatistically-meaningful way, models with an increasing number of Keplerians. A\nfirst constraint on the frequency of planets in our metal-poor sample is\ncalculated considering the previous detection (in our sample) of a\nNeptune-sized planet around HD175607 and one candidate planet (with an orbital\nperiod of 68.42d and minimum mass $M_p \\sin i = 11.14 \\pm 2.47 M_{\\oplus}$) for\nHD87838, announced in the present study. This frequency is determined to be\nclose to 13% and is compared with results for solar-metallicity stars.\n", "  We use a background quasar to detect the presence of circum-galactic gas\naround a $z=0.91$ low-mass star forming galaxy. Data from the new Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT show that the host galaxy has a\ndust-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) of 4.7$\\pm$0.2 Msun/yr, with no\ncompanion down to 0.22 Msun/yr (5 $\\sigma$) within 240 kpc (30\"). Using a\nhigh-resolution spectrum (UVES) of the background quasar, which is fortuitously\naligned with the galaxy major axis (with an azimuth angle $\\alpha$ of only\n$15^\\circ$), we find, in the gas kinematics traced by low-ionization lines,\ndistinct signatures consistent with those expected for a \"cold flow disk\"\nextending at least 12 kpc ($3\\times R_{1/2}$). We estimate the mass accretion\nrate $\\dot M_{\\rm in}$ to be at least two to three times larger than the SFR,\nusing the geometric constraints from the IFU data and the HI column density of\n$\\log N_{\\rm HI} \\simeq 20.4$ obtained from a {\\it HST}/COS NUV spectrum. From\na detailed analysis of the low-ionization lines (e.g. ZnII, CrII, TiII, MnII,\nSiII), the accreting material appears to be enriched to about 0.4 $Z_\\odot$\n(albeit with large uncertainties: $\\log Z/Z_\\odot=-0.4~\\pm~0.4$), which is\ncomparable to the galaxy metallicity ($12+\\log \\rm O/H=8.7\\pm0.2$), implying a\nlarge recycling fraction from past outflows. Blue-shifted MgII and FeII\nabsorptions in the galaxy spectrum from the MUSE data reveal the presence of an\noutflow. The MgII and FeII doublet ratios indicate emission infilling due to\nscattering processes, but the MUSE data do not show any signs of fluorescent\nFeII* emission.\n", "  Saltation models provide considerable insight into near-bed sediment\ntransport. This paper outlines a simple, efficient numerical model of\nstochastic saltation, which is validated against previously published\nexperimental data on saltation in a channel of nearly horizontal bed.\nConvergence tests are systematically applied to ensure the model is free from\nstatistical errors emanating from the number of particle hops considered. Two\ncriteria for statistical convergence are derived; according to the first\ncriterion, at least $10^3$ hops appear to be necessary for convergent results,\nwhereas $10^4$ saltations seem to be the minimum required in order to achieve\nstatistical convergence in accordance with the second criterion. Two empirical\nformulae for lift force are considered: one dependent on the slip (relative)\nvelocity of the particle multiplied by the vertical gradient of the horizontal\nflow velocity component; the other dependent on the difference between the\nsquares of the slip velocity components at the top and bottom of the particle.\nThe former is found to give more stable results. A parameter study indicates\nthat the saltation length has a minimum value with increasing particle diameter\n(at non-dimensional $D_* \\sim 12$) for a given transport stage. Variations in\nthe friction coefficient and collision line level have negligible effect on the\nsaltation statistics within the ranges considered. Regression equations are\nobtained for each of the saltation characteristics. Finally, the model is used\nto evaluate the bed load transport rate, which is in satisfactory agreement\nwith common formulae based on flume data, especially when compared against\nother saltation-derived expressions.\n", "  (Abridged) In the framework of the BinaMicS project, we have begun a study of\nthe magnetic properties of a sample of intermediate-mass and massive\nshort-period binary systems, as a function of binarity properties. We report in\nthis paper the characterisation of the magnetic field of HD 5550, a\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binary system of intermediate-mass, using\nhigh-resolution spectropolarimetric Narval observations of HD 5550. We first\nfit the intensity spectra using Zeeman/ATLAS9 LTE synthetic spectra to estimate\nthe effective temperatures, microturbulent velocities, and the abundances of\nsome elements of both components, as well as the light-ratio of the system. We\nthen fit the least-square deconvolved $I$ profiles to determine the radial and\nprojected rotational velocities of both stars. We then analysed the shape and\nevolution of the LSD $V$ profiles using the oblique rotator model to\ncharacterise the magnetic fields of both stars.\n  We confirm the Ap nature of the primary, previously reported in the\nliterature, and find that the secondary displays spectral characteristics\ntypical of an Am star. While a magnetic field is clearly detected in the lines\nof the primary, no magnetic field is detected in the secondary, in any of our\nobservation. If a dipolar field were present at the surface of the Am star, its\npolar strength must be below 40 G. The faint variability observed in the Stokes\n$V$ profiles of the Ap star allowed us to propose a rotation period of\n$6.84_{-0.39}^{+0.61}$ d, close to the orbital period ($\\sim$6.82 d),\nsuggesting that the star is synchronised with its orbit. By fitting the\nvariability of the $V$ profiles, we propose that the Ap component hosts a\ndipolar field inclined with the rotation axis at an angle $\\beta=156\\pm17$\n$^{\\circ}$ and a polar strength $B_{\\rm d}=65 \\pm 20$ G. The field strength is\nthe weakest known for an Ap star.\n", "  We present a comprehensive new global QCD analysis of polarized inclusive\ndeep-inelastic scattering, including the latest high-precision data on\nlongitudinal and transverse polarization asymmetries from Jefferson Lab and\nelsewhere. The analysis is performed using a new iterative Monte Carlo fitting\ntechnique which generates stable fits to polarized parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) with statistically rigorous uncertainties. Inclusion of the\nJefferson Lab data leads to a reduction in the PDF errors for the valence and\nsea quarks, as well as in the gluon polarization uncertainty at $x \\gtrsim\n0.1$. The study also provides the first determination of the flavor-separated\ntwist-3 PDFs and the $d_2$ moment of the nucleon within a global PDF analysis.\n", "  We try to solve the dark matter problem in the fit between theory and the\nHubble diagram of supernovae by allowing for torsion via Einstein-Cartan's\ngravity and for anisotropy via the axial Bianchi I metric. Otherwise we are\nconservative and admit only the cosmological constant and dust. The failure of\nour model is quantified by the relative amount of dust in our best fit:\nOmega_{m0}= 27 % +/- 5 % at 1 sigma level.\n", "  Multi-color Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRDmc) has been introduced by Inoue\net al. as a particle based simulation method to study the flow of emulsion\ndroplets in non-wetting microchannels. In this work, we extend the multi-color\nmethod to also account for different wetting conditions. This is achieved by\nassigning the color information not only to fluid particles but also to virtual\nwall particles that are required to enforce proper no-slip boundary conditions.\nTo extend the scope of the original SRDmc algorithm to e.g. immiscible\ntwo-phase flow with viscosity contrast we implement an angular momentum\nconserving scheme (SRDmc+). We perform extensive benchmark simulations to show\nthat a mono-phase SRDmc fluid exhibits bulk properties identical to a standard\nSRD fluid and that SRDmc fluids are applicable to a wide range of immiscible\ntwo-phase flows. To quantify the adhesion of a SRDmc+ fluid in contact to the\nwalls we measure the apparent contact angle from sessile droplets in mechanical\nequilibrium. For a further verification of our wettability implementation we\ncompare the dewetting of a liquid film from a wetting stripe to experimental\nand numerical studies of interfacial morphologies on chemically structured\nsurfaces.\n", "  We investigate the O($n$) nonintersecting loop model on the square lattice\nunder the constraint that the loops consist of ninety-degree bends only. The\nmodel is governed by the loop weight $n$, a weight $x$ for each vertex of the\nlattice visited once by a loop, and a weight $z$ for each vertex visited twice\nby a loop. We explore the $(x,z)$ phase diagram for some values of $n$. For\n$0<n<1$, the diagram has the same topology as the generic O($n$) phase diagram\nwith $n<2$, with a first-order line when $z$ starts to dominate, and an\nO($n$)-like transition when $x$ starts to dominate. Both lines meet in an\nexactly solved higher critical point. For $n>1$, the O($n$)-like transition\nline appears to be absent. Thus, for $z=0$, the $(n,x)$ phase diagram displays\na line of phase transitions for $n\\le 1$. The line ends at $n=1$ in an\ninfinite-order transition. We determine the conformal anomaly and the critical\nexponents along this line. These results agree accurately with a recent\nproposal for the universal classification of this type of model, at least in\nmost of the range $-1 \\leq n \\leq 1$. We also determine the exponent describing\ncrossover to the generic O($n$) universality class, by introducing topological\ndefects associated with the introduction of `straight' vertices violating the\nninety-degree-bend rule. These results are obtained by means of transfer-matrix\ncalculations and finite-size scaling.\n", "  The inner structures of the multiquark states are an interesting subject in\nhadron physics, generally they may be in tetraquark states which are composed\nof colored constituents, or in molecular states which are composed of two color\nsinglets, or their mixtures. Therefore, the mechanisms which bind the\nconstituents in a unique system and induce the multiquark states to decay would\nbe different in those cases. In this work, using the quantum mechanics we\nanalyze the dynamical mechanisms inducing decays of the tetraquarks where\n$Y(4630)$ stands as an example for the study, we also comment on the molecular\nstates without making numerical computations.\n", "  The construction of models for the internal constitution and the temporal\nevolution of large planetesimals, the parent bodies of chondrites, requires\ninformation on the heat conductivity of the complex mixture of minerals and\niron metal found in chondrites. It is attempted to evaluate the heat\nconductivity of a multi-component mineral mixture and granular medium from the\nheat conductivities of its mixture components. Random mixtures of solids with\nchondritic composition and packings of spheres are numerically generated. The\nheat conduction equation is solved in high spatial resolution for a test cube\nfilled with such matter. From the heat flux through the cube the heat\nconductivity of the mixture is derived. The model results for porous material\nare consistent with data for compacted sandstone, but are at odds with\nmeasurements for H and L chondrites. The discrepancy is traced back to shock\nmodification of the currently available meteoritic material by impacts on the\nparent body over the last 4.5 Ga. This causes numerous micro-cracks that act as\nadditional barriers for heat transfer. The void structure in meteorites is\ndifferent from that which probably existed in the pristine material of the\nparent bodies. The results obtained for the heat conductivity of the pristine\nmaterial are used for calculating models for the evolution of the H chondrite\nparent body which are fitted to the cooling data of a number of H chondrites.\nThe fit to the data good.\n", "  The semiclassical effects of antievaporating black holes can be discussed in\nthe framework of $f(R)$ gravity. In particular, the\nBousso-Hawking-Nojiri-Odinstov antievaporation instability of degenerate\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter black holes (the so called Nariai space-time) leads to\na dynamical increasing of black hole horizon in $f(R)$ gravity. This phenomenon\ncauses the following transition: emitting marginally trapped surfaces become\nspace-like surfaces before the effective Bekenstein-Hawking emission time. As a\nconsequence, Bousso-Hawking thermal radiation cannot be emitted in an\nantievaporating Nariai black hole. Possible implications in cosmology and black\nhole physics are also discussed.\n", "  We are investigating universal relations between different normalisations of\nthe moment of inertia and the compactness of neutron and strange stars. Slowly\nrotating as well as rapidly rotating models are studied in General Relativity,\n$\\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity and scalar--tensor theories of gravity. Moment of\ninertia -- compactness relations are examined for different normalisations of\nthe moment of inertia. It is shown that for all studied cases the deviations\nfrom EOS universality are small for the examined equations of state. It turns\nout that in some of the cases the examined relations are also theory\nindependent to a good extent. Universality in relations between the maximum\nmass and the moment of inertia for some unstable models is also investigated.\n", "  In renormalized field theories there are in general one or few fixed points\nwhich are accessible by the renormalization-group flow. They can be identified\nfrom the fixed-point equations. Exceptionally, an infinite family of fixed\npoints exists, parameterized by a scaling exponent $\\zeta$, itself function of\na non-renormalizing parameter. Here we report a different scenario with an\ninfinite family of fixed points of which seemingly only one is chosen by the\nrenormalization-group flow. This dynamical selection takes place in systems\nwith an attractive interaction ${\\cal V}(\\phi)$, as in standard $\\phi^4$\ntheory, but where the potential $\\cal V$ at large $\\phi$ goes to zero, as e.g.\nthe attraction by a defect.\n", "  We provide a new collection of spectra of 35 carbon stars obtained with the\nESO/VLT X-shooter instrument as part of the X-shooter Spectral Library project.\nThe spectra extend from 0.3$\\mu$m to 2.4$\\mu$m with a resolving power above\n$\\sim$ 8000. The sample contains stars with a broad range of (J-K) color and\npulsation properties located in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We\nshow that the distribution of spectral properties of carbon stars at a given\n(J-K) color becomes bimodal (in our sample) when (J-K) is larger than about\n1.5. We describe the two families of spectra that emerge, characterized by the\npresence or absence of the absorption feature at 1.53$\\mu$m, generally\nassociated with HCN and C$_2$H$_2$. This feature appears essentially only in\nlarge-amplitude variables, though not in all observations. Associated spectral\nsignatures that we interpret as the result of veiling by circumstellar matter,\nindicate that the 1.53$\\mu$m feature might point to episodes of dust production\nin carbon-rich Miras.\n", "  We report broadband spin-wave spectroscopy on kagome artificial spin ice\n(ASI) made of large arrays of interconnected Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ nanobars.\nSpectra taken in saturated and disordered states exhibit a series of resonances\nwith characteristic magnetic field dependencies. Making use of micromagnetic\nsimulations, we identify resonances that reflect the spin-solid-state and\nmonopole-antimonopole pairs on Dirac strings. The latter resonances allow for\nthe generation of highly-charged vertices in ASIs via microwave assisted\nswitching. Our findings open further perspectives for fundamental studies on\nASIs and their usage in reprogrammable magnonics.\n", "  Temperature anisotropy in broad component of H$\\alpha$ line was found in the\nring trap 1 (RT-1) device by Doppler spectroscopy. Since hot hydrogen neutrals\nemitting a broad component are mainly produced by charge exchange between\nneutrals and protons, the anisotropy in the broad component is the evidence of\nproton temperature anisotropy generated by betatron acceleration.\n", "  We establish a precise connection between discrete wavelet transforms (WTs)\nand entanglement renormalization (ER), a real-space renormalization group\ntransformation for quantum systems on the lattice, in the context of free\nparticle systems. Specifically, we employ Daubechies wavelets to build\napproximations to the ground state of the critical Ising model, then\ndemonstrate that these states correspond to instances of the multi-scale\nentanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), producing the first known analytic\nMERA for critical systems.\n", "  Magneto transmission spectroscopy was employed to study the valley Zeeman\neffect in large-area monolayer MoS$_{2}$ and MoSe$_{2}$. The extracted values\nof the valley g-factors for both A- and B-exciton were found be similar with\n$g_v \\simeq -4.5$. The samples are expected to be strained due to the CVD\ngrowth on sapphire at high temperature ($700^\\circ$C). However, the estimated\nstrain, which is maximum at low temperature, is only $\\simeq 0.2\\%$.\nTheoretical considerations suggest that the strain is too small to\nsignificantly influence the electronic properties. This is confirmed by the\nmeasured value of valley g-factor, and the measured temperature dependence of\nthe band gap, which are almost identical for CVD and mechanically exfoliated\nMoS$_2$.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of $N_f = 2+1$ QCD in the $T - \\mu_B$ plane and\ninvestigate the critical point corresponding to the onset of the Roberge-Weiss\ntransition, which is found for imaginary values of $\\mu_B$. We make use of\nstout improved staggered fermions and of the tree level Symanzik gauge action,\nand explore four different sets of lattice spacings, corresponding to $N_t =\n4,6,8,10$, and different spatial sizes, in order to assess the universality\nclass of the critical point. The continuum extrapolated value of the endpoint\ntemperature is found to be $T_{\\rm RW} = 208(5)$ MeV, i.e. $T_{\\rm\n  RW}/T_c \\sim 1.34(7)$, where $T_c$ is the chiral pseudocritical temperature\nat zero chemical potential, while our finite size scaling analysis, performed\non $N_t = 4$ and $N_t = 6$ lattices, provides evidence for a critical point in\nthe $3d$ Ising universality class.\n", "  Quantum coin flipping (QCF) is an essential primitive for quantum\ncryptography. Unconditionally secure strong QCF with an arbitrarily small bias\nwas widely believed to be impossible. But basing on a problem which cannot be\nsolved without quantum algorithm, here we propose such a QCF protocol, and show\nhow it manages to evade all existing no-go proofs on QCF.\n", "  Transitional disks are structures of dust and gas around young stars with\nlarge inner cavities in which planet formation may occur. Lopsided dust\ndistributions are observed in the dust continuum emission at millimeter\nwavelengths. These asymmetrical structures can be explained as the result of an\nenhanced gas density vortex where the dust is trapped potentially promoting the\nrapid growth to the planetesimal scale. AB Aur hosts a transitional disk with a\nclear horseshoe morphology which strongly suggests the presence of a dust trap.\nOur goal is to investigate its formation and the possible effects on the gas\nchemistry. We used the NOEMA interferometer to image the 1mm continuum dust\nemission and the 13CO J=2->1, C18O J=2->1, SO J=56->45 and H2CO J=303->202\nrotational lines. Line integrated intensity ratio images are built to\ninvestigate the chemical changes within the disk. We have used a single point\n(n,T) chemical model to investigate the lifetime of gaseous CO, H2CO and SO in\nthe dust trap. Our model shows that for densities >10^7 cm^-3, the SO molecules\nare depleted (directly frozen or converted into SO2 and then frozen out) in\nless than 0.1 Myr. The lower SO abundance towards the dust trap could indicate\nthat a larger fraction of the gas is in a high density environment. Gas\ndynamics, grain growth and gas chemistry are coupled in the planet formation\nprocess. Because of the strong dependence of SO abundance on the gas density,\nthe sulfur chemistry can be used as a chemical diagnostic to detect the\nbirthsites of future planets. However, the large uncertainties inherent to\nchemical models and the limited knowledge of the disk physical structure and\ninitial conditions are important drawbacks.\n", "  We investigate ultra-cold fermions placed into an optical cavity and\nsubjected to optical lattices which confine the atoms to ladder structures. A\ntransverse running-wave laser beam induces together with the dynamical cavity\nfield a two-photon Raman-assisted tunneling process with spatially dependent\nphase imprint along the rungs of the ladders. We identify the steady states\nwhich can occur by the feedback mechanism between the cavity field and the\natoms. We find the spontaneous emergence of a finite cavity field amplitude\nwhich leads to an artificial magnetic field felt by the fermionic atoms. These\nform a chiral insulating or chiral liquid state carrying a chiral current. We\nexplore the rich state diagram as a function of the power of the transverse\nlaser beam, the atomic filling, and the phase imprint during the cavity-induced\ntunneling. Both a sudden onset or a slow exponential activation with the\ntransverse laser power of the self-organized chiral states can occur.\n", "  In this paper, we test the discrepancy between the stellar mass density and\ninstantaneous star formation rate in redshift range $0<z<8$ using a large\nobservational data sample. We first compile the measurements of the stellar\nmass densities up to $z\\sim 8$. Comparing the observed stellar mass densities\nwith the time-integral of instantaneous star formation history, we find that\nthe observed stellar mass densities are lower than that implied from star\nformation history at $z<4$. We also use Markov chain monte carlo method to\nderive the best-fitting star formation history from the observed stellar mass\ndensity data. At $0.5<z<6$, the observed star formation rate densities are\nlarger than the best-fitting one, especially at $z\\sim2$ where by a factor of\nabout two. However, at lower ($z<0.5$) and higher redshifts ($z>6$), the\nderived star formation history is consistent with the observations. This is the\nfirst time to test the discrepancy between the observed stellar mass density\nand instantaneous star formation rate up to very high redshift $z\\approx8$\nusing the Markov chain monte carlo method and a varying recycling factor.\nSeveral possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, such as\nunderestimation of stellar mass density, initial mass function and cosmic\nmetallicity evolution.\n", "  We derive the complete set of continuous maximal symmetries for Standard\nModel (SM) alignment that may occur in the tree-level scalar potential of\nmulti-Higgs Doublet Models, with $n > 2$ Higgs doublets. Our results generalize\nthe symmetries of SM alignment, without decoupling of large mass scales or\nfine-tuning, previously obtained in the context of two-Higgs Doublet Models.\n", "  We discuss the determination of the $f_0(500)$ (or $\\sigma$) resonance by\nanalytic continuation through Pad\\'e approximants of the $\\pi\\pi$-scattering\namplitude from the physical region to the pole in the complex energy plane. The\naim is to analyze the uncertainties of the method, having in view the fact that\nanalytic continuation is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Using\nas input a class of admissible parameterizations of the scalar-isoscalar\n$\\pi\\pi$ partial wave, which satisfy with great accuracy the same set of\ndispersive constraints, we find that the Roy-type integral representations lead\nto almost identical pole positions for all of them, while the predictions of\nthe Pad\\'e approximants have a larger spread, being sensitive to features of\nthe input parameterization that are not controlled by the dispersive\nconstraints. Our conservative conclusion is that the $\\sigma$-pole\ndetermination by Pad\\'e approximants is consistent with the prediction of\nRoy-type equations, but has an uncertainty almost a factor two larger.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the efficient simulation of the half-filled\nspinless $t$-$V$ model on bipartite lattices, which combines the stochastic\nseries expansion method with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo techniques\nwidely used in fermionic simulations. The algorithm scales linearly in the\ninverse temperature, cubically with the system size and is free from the\ntime-discretization error. We use it to map out the finite temperature phase\ndiagram of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice and observe a\nsuppression of the critical temperature of the charge density wave phase in the\nvicinity of a fermionic quantum critical point.\n", "  Yellow symbiotic stars are useful targets to probe whether mass transfer has\nhappened in these binary systems. However, the number of known yellow symbiotic\nstars is very scarce. We report spectroscopic observations of five candidate\nyellow symbiotic stars selected by their position in the 2MASS (J-H) vs. (H-Ks)\ndiagram and included in some emission-line catalogs. Among the five candidates,\nonly StHa63 is identified as a new yellow symbiotic star because of its\nspectrum and its position in the [TiO]1-[TiO]2 diagram that indicates a K4-K6\nspectral type. In addition, the derived electron density (10E8.4 cm-3) and\nseveral emission line intensity ratios provide further support for that\nclassification. The other four candidates are rejected as symbiotic stars\nbecause three of them actually do not show emission lines and the fourth one\nshows only Balmer emission lines. We also found that the WISE W3-W4 index\nclearly separates normal K-giants from yellow symbiotic stars and, therefore,\ncan be used as an additional tool to select candidate yellow symbiotic stars.\n", "  Recently, a new dark energy model called $\\Lambda$HDE was proposed. In this\nmodel, dark energy consists of two parts: cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and\nholographic dark energy (HDE). Two key parameters of this model are the\nfractional density of cosmological constant $\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}$, and the\ndimensionless HDE parameter $c$. Since these two parameters determine the\ndynamical properties of DE and the destiny of universe, it is important to\nstudy the impacts of different values of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}$ and $c$ on the\n$\\Lambda$HDE model. In this paper, we apply various DE diagnostic tools to\ndiagnose $\\Lambda$HDE models with different values of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}$ and\n$c$; these tools include statefinder hierarchy \\{$S_3^{(1)}, S_4^{(1)}$\\},\nfractional growth parameter $\\epsilon$, and composite null diagnostic (CND),\nwhich is a combination of \\{$S_3^{(1)}, S_4^{(1)}$\\} and $\\epsilon$. We find\nthat: (1) adopting different values of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}$ only has\nquantitative impacts on the evolution of the $\\Lambda$HDE model, while adopting\ndifferent $c$ has qualitative impacts; (2) compared with $S_3^{(1)}$,\n$S_4^{(1)}$ can give larger differences among the cosmic evolutions of the\n$\\Lambda$HDE model associated with different $\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}$ or different\n$c$; (3) compared with the case of using a single diagnostic, adopting a CND\npair has much stronger ability to diagnose the $\\Lambda$HDE model.\n", "  The duration distribution of 408 GRBs with measured both duration $T_{90}$\nand redshift $z$ is examined. Mixtures of a number of distributions (standard\nnormal, skew-normal, sinh-arcsinh, and alpha-skew-normal) are fitted to the\nobserved and intrinsic durations using the maximum log-likelihood method. The\nbest fit is chosen via the Akaike information critetion. The aim of this work\nis to assess the presence of the presumed intermediate GRB class, and to\nprovide a phenomenological model more appropriate than the common mixture of\nstandard Gaussians. While $\\log T^{obs}_{90}$ are well described by a truly\ntrimodal fit, after moving to the rest frame the statistically most significant\nfit is unimodal. To trace the source of this discrepancy, 334 GRBs observed\nonly by $Swift$/BAT are examined in the same way. In the observer frame, this\nresults in a number of statistically plausible descriptions, being uni- and\nbimodal, and with the number of components ranging from one to three. After\nmoving to the rest frame, no unambiguous conclusions may be put forward. It is\nconcluded that the size of the sample is not big enough to infer reliably GRB\nproperties based on a univariate statistical reasoning only.\n", "  The process of capture of a molecular enesemble into rotational resonance in\nthe optical centrifuge is investigated. The adiabaticity and phase space\nincompressibility are used to find the resonant capture probability in terms of\ntwo dimensionless parameters P1,P2 characterising the driving strength and the\nnonlinearity, and related to three characteristic time scales in the problem.\nThe analysis is based on the transformation to action-angle variables and the\nsingle resonance approximation, yielding reduction of the three-dimensional\nrotation problem to one degree of freedom. The analytic results for capture\nprobability are in a good agreement with simulations. The existing experiments\nsatisfy the validity conditions of the theory.\n", "  Feedback loops are known as a versatile tool for controlling transport in\nsmall systems, which usually have large intrinsic fluctuations. Here we\ninvestigate the control of a temporal correlation function, the waiting time\ndistribution, under active and passive feedback conditions. We develop a\ngeneral formalism and then specify to the simple unidirectional transport\nmodel, where we compare costs of open loop and feedback control and use methods\nfrom optimal control theory to optimize waiting time distributions.\n", "  Clusters of galaxies are expected to be reservoirs of cosmic rays (CRs) that\nshould produce diffuse gamma-ray emission due to their hadronic interactions\nwith the intra-cluster medium. The nearby Perseus cool-core cluster, identified\nas the most promising target to search for such an emission, has been observed\nwith the MAGIC telescopes at very-high energies (VHE, E>100 GeV) for a total of\n253 hr from 2009 to 2014. The active nuclei of NGC 1275, the central dominant\ngalaxy of the cluster, and IC 310, lying at about 0.6$^\\circ$ from the centre,\nhave been detected as point-like VHE gamma-ray emitters during the first phase\nof this campaign. We report an updated measurement of the NGC 1275 spectrum,\nwhich is well described by a power law with a photon index of\n$3.6\\pm0.2_{stat}\\pm0.2_{syst}$ between 90 GeV and 1.2 TeV. We do not detect\nany diffuse gamma-ray emission from the cluster and set stringent constraints\non its CR population. In order to bracket the uncertainties over the CR spatial\nand spectral distributions, we adopt different spatial templates and power-law\nspectral indexes $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha=2.2$, the CR-to-thermal pressure within\nthe cluster virial radius is constrained to be below 1-2%, except if CRs can\npropagate out of the cluster core, generating a flatter radial distribution and\nreleasing the CR-to-thermal pressure constraint to <20%. Assuming that the\nobserved radio mini-halo of Perseus is generated by secondary electrons from CR\nhadronic interactions, we can derive lower limits on the central magnetic\nfield, $B_0$, that depend on the CR distribution. For $\\alpha=2.2$,\n$B_0\\gtrsim5-8 \\mu$G, which is below the 25 $\\mu$G inferred from Faraday\nrotation measurements, whereas, for $\\alpha\\lesssim2.1$, the hadronic\ninterpretation of the diffuse radio emission is in contrast with our gamma-ray\nflux upper limits independently of the magnetic field strength.\n", "  In this work, we present a detailed theoretical investigation of the\nelectronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic slabs and clusters\ndeposited on SrTiO$\\_3$ via first-principles, with a particular emphasis on the\nmagneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA). We found that in the case of Fe films\ndeposited on SrTiO$\\_3$ the effect of the interface is to quench the MCA\nwhereas for Cobalt we observe a change of sign of the MCA from in-plane to\nout-of-plane as compared to the free surface. We also find a strong enhancement\nof MCA for small clusters upon deposition on a SrTiO$\\_3$ substrate. The\nhybridization between the substrate and the $d$-orbitals of the cluster\nextending in-plane for Fe and out-of-plane for Co is at the origin of this\nenhancement of MCA. As a consequence, we predict that the Fe nanocrystals (even\nrather small) should be magnetically stable and are thus good potential\ncandidates for magnetic storage devices.\n", "  Aims. Study the connection between the masing disk and obscuring torus in\nSeyfert 2 galaxies.\n  Methods. We present a uniform X-ray spectral analysis of the high energy\nproperties of 14 nearby megamaser Active Galactic Nuclei observed by NuSTAR. We\nuse a simple analytical model to localize the maser disk and understand its\nconnection with the torus by combining NuSTAR spectral parameters with\navailable physical quantities from VLBI mapping.\n  Results. Most of the sources analyzed are heavily obscured, showing a column\ndensity in excess of $\\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. In particular, $79\\%$ are\nCompton-thick ($N_{\\rm H} > 1.5 \\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). Using column\ndensities measured by NuSTAR, with the assumption that the torus is the\nextension of the maser disk, and further assuming a reasonable density profile,\nthe torus dimensions can be predicted. They are found to be consistent with\nmid-IR interferometry parsec-scale observations of Circinus and NGC 1068. In\nthis picture, the maser disk is intimately connected to the inner part of the\ntorus. It is probably made of a large number of molecular clouds connecting the\ntorus and the outer part of the accretion disk, giving rise to a thin disk\nrotating in most cases in Keplerian or sub-Keplerian motion. This toy model\nexplains the established close connection between water megamaser emission and\nnuclear obscuration as a geometric effect.\n", "  Using one-dimensional numerical simulations, we study the elementary process\nof Alfv\\'{e}n wave reflection in a uniform medium, including nonlinear effects.\nIn the linear regime, Alfv\\'{e}n wave reflection is triggered only by the\ninhomogeneity of the medium, whereas in the nonlinear regime, it can occur via\nnonlinear wave-wave interactions. Such nonlinear reflection (backscattering) is\ntypified by decay instability. In most studies of decay instabilities, the\ninitial condition has been a circularly polarized Alfv\\'{e}n wave. In this\nstudy we consider a linearly polarized Alfv\\'en wave, which drives density\nfluctuations by its magnetic pressure force. For generality, we also assume a\nbroadband wave with a red-noise spectrum. In the data analysis, we decompose\nthe fluctuations into characteristic variables using local eigenvectors, thus\nrevealing the behaviors of the individual modes. Different from\ncircular-polarization case, we find that the wave steepening produces a new\nenergy channel from the parent Alfv\\'en wave to the backscattered one. Such\nnonlinear reflection explains the observed increasing energy ratio of the\nsunward to the anti-sunward Alfv\\'{e}nic fluctuations in the solar wind with\ndistance against the dynamical alignment effect.\n", "  We revive the historically first dark matter model based on neutrinos, but\nwith an additional assumption that neutrinos might exist in tachyonic almost\nsterile states. To this end, we propose a group-theoretical algorithm for the\ndescription of tachyons. The key point is that we employ a distinct tachyon\nLorentz group with new (superluminal) parametrization which does not lead to\nviolation of causality and unitarity. Our dark matter model represents\neffectively scalar tachyonic neutrino-antineutrino conglomerate. Distributed\nall over the universe, such fluid behaves as stable isothermal/stiff medium\nwhich produces somewhat denser regions (`halos') around galaxies and clusters.\nTo avoid the central singularity inherent to the isothermal profile, we apply a\nspecial smoothing algorithm which yields density distributions and rotation\ncurves consistent with observational data.\n", "  Numerous anomalous results in neutrino oscillation experiments can be\nattributed to interference of ~1 eV sterile neutrino. The specially designed to\nfully explore the Gallium anomaly Baksan Experiment on Sterile Transitions\n(BEST) starts next year. We investigate the sensitivity of BEST in searches for\nsterile neutrino mixed with electron neutrino. Then, performing the combined\nanalysis of all the Gallium experiments (SAGE, GALLEX, BEST) we find the\nregions in model parameter space (sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle),\nwhich will be excluded if BEST agrees with no sterile neutrino hypothesis. For\nthe opposite case, if BEST observes the signal as it follows from the sterile\nneutrino explanation of the Gallium (SAGE and GALLEX) anomaly, we show how BEST\nwill improve upon the present estimates of the model parameters.\n", "  We consider thermoelectric transport properties of the edge states of a two\ndimensional topological insulator in a double quantum point contact geometry\ncoupled to two thermally biased reservoirs. Both spin-preserving and\nspin-flipping tunneling processes between opposite edges are analyzed in the\npresence of electron-electron interactions. We demonstrate that the\nsimultaneous presence of spin-flipping processes and interactions gives rise to\na finite longitudinal spin current. Moreover, its sign and amplitude can be\ntuned by means of gate voltages with the possibility to generate a pure spin\ncurrent, with a vanishing charge current.\n", "  The generally accepted representation of $\\kappa$-distributions in space\nplasma physics allows for two different alternatives, namely assuming either\nthe temperature or the thermal velocity to be $\\kappa$-independent. The present\npaper aims to clarify the issue concerning which of the two possible choices\nand the related physical interpretation is the correct one. A quantitative\ncomparison of the consequences of the use of both distributions for specific\nphysical systems leads to their correct interpretation. It is found that both\nalternatives can be realized, but are valid for principally different physical\nsystems. The investigation demonstrates that, before employing one of the two\nalternatives, one should be conscious about the nature of the physical system\none intends to describe, otherwise one would possibly obtain unphysical\nresults.\n", "  Using observations of the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\n(INTEGRAL), we put upper limits on the gamma-ray and hard X-ray prompt emission\nassociated with the gravitational wave event GW150914, discovered by the\nLIGO/Virgo collaboration. The omni-directional view of the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS has\nallowed us to constrain the fraction of energy emitted in the hard X-ray\nelectromagnetic component for the full high-probability sky region of LIGO\ntrigger. Our upper limits on the hard X-ray fluence at the time of the event\nrange from $F_{\\gamma}=2 \\times 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to $F_{\\gamma}=10^{-6}$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ in the 75 keV - 2 MeV energy range for typical spectral models.\nOur results constrain the ratio of the energy promptly released in gamma-rays\nin the direction of the observer to the gravitational wave energy\nE$_\\gamma/$E$_\\mathrm{GW}<10^{-6}$. We discuss the implication of gamma-ray\nlimits on the characteristics of the gravitational wave source, based on the\navailable predictions for prompt electromagnetic emission.\n", "  While monitoring a sample of apparently slowly rotating superficially normal\nbright late B and early A stars in the northern hemisphere, we have discovered\nthat HD 67044 and HD 42035, hitherto classified as normal late B-type stars,\nare actually respectively a new chemically peculiar star and a new\nspectroscopic binary containing a very slow rotator HD 42035 S with ultra-sharp\nlines (vsini = 3.7 km/s) and a fast rotator HD 42035 B with broad lines. The\nlines of Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr and Ba are conspicuous features in the high\nresolution SOPHIE spectrum of HD 67044. The HgII line at 3983.93 A is also\npresent as a weak feature. The composite spectrum of HD 42035 is characterised\nby very sharp lines formed in HD 42035 S superimposed onto the shallow and\nbroad lines of HD 42035 B. These very sharp lines are mostly due to light\nelements from C to Ni, the only heavy species definitely present are Sr and Ba.\nSelected lines of 21 chemical elements from He up to Hg have been synthesized\nusing model atmospheres computed with ATLAS9 and the spectrum synthesis code\nSYNSPEC48 including hyperfine structure of various isotopes when relevant.\nAbundances of these key elements have been derived HD 67044 and HD 42035 S. HD\n67044 is found to have distinct enhancements of Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba and\nHg and underabundances in He, C, O, Ca and Sc which shows that this star is not\na superficially normal late B-type star, but actually is a new CP star most\nlikely of the HgMn type. HD 42035 S has provisional underabundances of the\nlight elements from C to Ti and overabundances of heavier elements up to\nbarium. More accurate fundamental parameters and abundances for HD 42035 S and\nHD 42035 B will be derived if we manage to disentangle their spectra. They will\nhelp clarify the status of the two components in this interesting new\nspectroscopic binary.\n", "  The wind interaction with the dusty environment of the classical T Tauri star\nRY Tau has been investigated. During two seasons of 2013-2015 we carried out a\nspectroscopic and photometric (BVR) monitoring of the star. A correlation\nbetween the stellar brightness and the radial velocity of the wind determined\nfrom the H-alpha and Na D line profiles has been found for the first time. The\nirregular stellar brightness variations are shown to be caused by extinction in\na dusty disk wind at a distance of about 0.2 AU from the star. We suppose, that\nvariations of the circumstellar extinction results from cyclic rearrangements\nof the stellar magnetosphere and coronal mass ejections, which affect the dusty\ndisk wind near the inner boundary of the circumstellar disk.\n", "  Motivated by the dynamics of resonance capture, we study numerically the\ncoorbital resonance for inclination180 >=I>=0 in the circular restricted\nthree-body problem. We examine the similarities and differences between planar\nand three dimensional coorbital resonance capture and seek their origin in the\nstability of coorbital motion at arbitrary inclination. After we present\nstability maps of the planar prograde and retrograde coorbital resonances, we\ncharacterize the new coorbital modes in three dimensions. We see that\nretrograde mode I (R1) and mode II (R2) persist as we change the relative\ninclination, while retrograde mode III (R3) seems to exist only in the planar\nproblem. A new coorbital mode (R4) appears in 3D which is a retrograde analogue\nto an horseshoe-orbit. The Kozai-Lidov resonance is active for retrograde\norbits as well as prograde orbits and plays a key role in coorbital resonance\ncapture. Stable coorbital modes exist at all inclinations, including retrograde\nand polar obits. This result confirms the robustness the coorbital resonance at\nlarge inclination and encourages the search for retrograde coorbital companions\nof the solar system's planets.\n", "  The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the gas mass and star formation\nrate (SFR) describes the star formation regulation in disk galaxies. It is a\nfunction of gas metallicity, but the low metallicity regime of the KS diagram\nis poorly sampled. We have analyzed data for a representative set of extremely\nmetal-poor galaxies (XMPs), as well as auxiliary data, and compared these to\nempirical and theoretical predictions. The majority of the XMPs possess high\nspecific SFRs, similar to high redshift star-forming galaxies. On the KS plot,\nthe XMP HI data occupy the same region as dwarfs, and extend the relation for\nlow surface brightness galaxies. Considering the HI gas alone, a considerable\nfraction of the XMPs already fall off the KS law. Significant quantities of\n'dark' H$_2$ mass (i.e., not traced by CO) would imply that XMPs possess low\nstar formation efficiencies (SFE$_{\\rm gas}$). Low SFE$_{\\rm gas}$ in XMPs may\nbe the result of the metal-poor nature of the HI gas. Alternatively, the HI\nreservoir may be largely inert, the star formation being dominated by\ncosmological accretion. Time lags between gas accretion and star formation may\nalso reduce the apparent SFE$_{\\rm gas}$, as may galaxy winds, which can expel\nmost of the gas into the intergalactic medium. Hence, on global scales, XMPs\ncould be HI-dominated, high specific SFR ($\\gtrsim $ 10$^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$), low\nSFE$_{\\rm gas}$ ($\\lesssim$ 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) systems, in which the total HI\nmass is likely not a good predictor of the total H$_2$ mass nor of the SFR.\n", "  Rapid Blue- and Red-shifted Excursions (RBEs and RREs) are likely to be the\non-disk counterparts of Type II spicules. Recently, heating signatures from\nRBEs/RREs have been detected in IRIS slit-jaw images dominated by\ntransition-region lines around network patches. Additionally, signatures of\nType II spicules have been observed in AIA diagnostics. The full-disk,\never-present nature of the AIA diagnostics should provide us with sufficient\nstatistics to directly determine how important RBEs and RREs are to the heating\nof the transition region and corona. We find, with high statistical\nsignificance, that at least 11% of the low-coronal brightenings detected in a\nquiet-Sun region in 304, can be attributed to either RBEs or RREs as observed\nin H\\alpha, and a 6% match of 171 detected events to RBEs or RREs with very\nsimilar statistics for both types of H\\alpha\\ features. We took a statistical\napproach that allows for noisy detections in the coronal channels and provides\nus with a lower, but statistical significant, bound. Further, we consider\nmatches based on overlapping features in both time and space, and find strong\nvisual indications of further correspondence between coronal events and\nco-evolving but non-overlapping, RBEs and RREs.\n", "  Recent observations have revealed an amazing diversity of extremely luminous\nsupernovae, seemingly increasing in radiant energy without bound. We consider\nhere the physical limits of what existing models can provide for the peak\nluminosity and total radiated energy for non-relativistic, isotropic stellar\nexplosions. The brightest possible supernova is a Type I explosion powered by a\nsub-millisecond magnetar. Such models can reach a peak luminosity of $\\rm\n2\\times10^{46}\\ erg\\ s^{-1}$ and radiate a total energy of $\\rm 4\n\\times10^{52}\\ erg$. Other less luminous models are also explored, including\nprompt hyper-energetic explosions in red supergiants, pulsational-pair\ninstability supernovae, and pair-instability supernovae. Approximate analytic\nexpressions and limits are given for each case. Excluding magnetars, the peak\nluminosity is near $\\rm 1\\times10^{44}\\ erg\\ s^{-1}$ for the brightest models.\nThe corresponding limits on total radiated power are $\\rm3 \\times 10^{51}\\ erg$\n(Type I) and $\\rm1 \\times 10^{51}\\ erg$ (Type II). A magnetar-based model for\nthe recent transient event, ASASSN-15lh is presented that strains, but does not\nexceed the limits of what the model can provide.\n", "  We extend earlier investigations of heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons to the\nvector case, using a simple model in the context of the\nDyson-Schwinger-Bethe-Salpeter approach. We investigate the effects of a\ndressed-quark-gluon vertex in a systematic fashion and illustrate and attempt\nto quantify corrections beyond the phenomenologically very useful and\nsuccessful rainbow-ladder truncation. In particular we investigate dressed\nquark photon vertex in such a setup and make a prediction for the\nexperimentally as yet unknown mass of the B_c*, which we obtain at 6.334 GeV\nwell in line with predictions from other approaches. Furthermore, we combine a\ncomprehensive set of results from the theory literature. The theory average for\nthe mass of the B_c* meson is 6.336 +- 0.002 GeV.\n", "  We investigate the symmetry property and construct the wave function of the\ndibaryon states containing two strange quarks with S=0 in both the flavor SU(3)\nsymmetric and breaking cases. We discuss how the color $\\otimes$ isospin\n$\\otimes$ spin states of dibaryon in the symmetry broking case of flavor SU(3)\ncan be extracted from the fully antisymmetric states in flavor SU(3). The\nstability of the dibaryon against the strong decay into two baryons are then\ndiscussed, by using the variational method within a constituent quark model\nwith a confining and color-spin interactions. To compare our results with that\nfrom lattice QCD in flavor SU(3) limit, we search for the stable H-dibaryon in\na wide range of $\\pi$ meson mass. We find that with the given potential, there\nis no compact six quark dibaryon state in the SU(3) flavor symmetry broken case\nwith realistic quark masses as well as in flavor SU(3) symmetric case in a wide\nrange of quark masses.\n", "  Extreme excesses of $^{13}C$ ($^{12}C$/$^{13}C$<10) and $^{15}N$\n($^{14}N$/$^{15}N$<20) in rare presolar SiC grains have been considered\ndiagnostic of an origin in classical novae, though an origin in core collapse\nsupernovae (CCSNe) has also been proposed. We report C, N, and Si isotope data\nfor 14 submicron- to micron-sized $^{13}C$- and $^{15}N$-enriched presolar SiC\ngrains ($^{12}C$/$^{13}C$<16 and $^{14}N$/$^{15}N$<~100) from Murchison, and\ntheir correlated Mg-Al, S, and Ca-Ti isotope data when available. These grains\nare enriched in $^{13}C$ and $^{15}N$, but with quite diverse Si isotopic\nsignatures. Four grains with $^{29,30}Si$ excesses similar to those of type C\nSiC grains likely came from CCSNe, which experienced explosive H burning\noccurred during explosions. The independent coexistence of proton- and\nneutron-capture isotopic signatures in these grains strongly supports\nheterogeneous H ingestion into the He shell in pre-supernovae. Two of the seven\nputative nova grains with $^{30}Si$ excesses and $^{29}Si$ depletions show\nlower-than-solar $^{34}S$/$^{32}S$ ratios that cannot be explained by classical\nnova nucleosynthetic models. We discuss these signatures within the CCSN\nscenario. For the remaining five putative nova grains, both nova and supernova\norigins are viable because explosive H burning in the two stellar sites could\nresult in quite similar proton-capture isotopic signatures. Three of the grains\nare sub-type AB grains that are also $^{13}C$ enriched, but have a range of\nhigher $^{14}N$/$^{15}N$. We found that $^{15}N$-enriched AB grains\n(~50<$^{14}N$/$^{15}N$<~100) have distinctive isotopic signatures compared to\nputative nova grains, such as higher $^{14}N$/$^{15}N$, lower\n$^{26}Al$/$^{27}Al$, and lack of $^{30}Si$ excess, indicating weaker\nproton-capture nucleosynthetic environments.\n", "  Distinguishing a dark matter interaction from an astrophysical\nneutrino-induced interaction will be major challenge for future direct dark\nmatter searches. In this paper, we consider this issue within non-relativistic\nEffective Field Theory (EFT), which provides a well-motivated theoretical\nframework for determining nuclear responses to dark matter scattering events.\nWe analyze the nuclear energy recoil spectra from the different dark\nmatter-nucleon EFT operators, and compare to the nuclear recoil energy spectra\nthat is predicted to be induced by astrophysical neutrino sources. We determine\nthat for 11 of the 14 possible operators, the dark matter-induced recoil\nspectra can be cleanly distinguished from the corresponding neutrino-induced\nrecoil spectra with moderate size detector technologies that are now being\npursued, e.g., these operators would require 0.5 tonne years to be\ndistinguished from the neutrino background for low mass dark matter. Our\nresults imply that in most models detectors with good energy resolution will be\nable to distinguish a dark matter signal from a neutrino signal, without the\nneed for much larger detectors that must rely on additional information from\ntiming or direction.\n", "  We have synthesized the single-phase polycrystalline samples of Sn1-xAgxTe,\nAg-doped topological crystalline insulator SnTe, with a range of x = 0-0.5\nusing a high-pressure synthesis method. The crystal structure of Sn1-xAgxTe at\nroom temperature is a cubic NaCl-type structure, which does not vary upon Ag\nsubstitution. Bulk superconductivity with a transition temperature of 2.4 K was\nobserved for x = 0.15-0.25, and the optimal Ag content was x = 0.2. The\nSn1-xAgxTe superconducting phase will be useful for understanding the\nsuperconductivity nature and mechanisms of the carrier-doped SnTe system.\n", "  DNA strand displacement is a key reaction in DNA homologous recombination and\nDNA mismatch repair and is also heavily utilized in DNA-based computation and\nlocomotion. Despite its ubiquity in science and engineering, sequence-dependent\neffects of displacement kinetics have not been extensively characterized. Here,\nwe measured toehold-mediated strand displacement kinetics using single-molecule\nfluorescence in the presence of a single base pair mismatch. The apparent\ndisplacement rate varied significantly when the mismatch was introduced in the\ninvading DNA strand. The rate generally decreased as the mismatch in the\ninvader was encountered earlier in displacement. Our data indicate that a\nsingle base pair mismatch in the invader stalls branch migration, and\ndisplacement occurs via direct dissociation of the destabilized incumbent\nstrand from the substrate strand. We combined both branch migration and direct\ndissociation into a model, which we term, the concurrent displacement model,\nand used the first passage time approach to quantitatively explain the salient\nfeatures of the observed relationship. We also introduce the concept of\nsplitting probabilities to justify that the concurrent model can be simplified\ninto a three-step sequential model in the presence of an invader mismatch. We\nexpect our model to become a powerful tool to design DNA-based reaction schemes\nwith broad functionality.\n", "  Three conceptually different masses appear in equations of motion for objects\nunder gravity, namely, the inertial mass, $m_{\\cal I}$, the passive\ngravitational mass, $m_{\\cal P}$, and the active gravitational mass, $m_{\\cal\nA}$. It is assumed that, for any objects, $m_{\\cal I} = m_{\\cal P} = m_{\\cal\nA}$ in the Newtonian gravity, and $m_{\\cal I} = m_{\\cal P}$ in the Einsteinian\ngravity, oblivious to objects' sophisticated internal structure. Empirical\nexamination of the equivalence probes deep into gravity theories. We study the\npossibility of carrying out new tests based on pulsar timing of the stellar\ntriple system, PSR J0337+1715. Various machine-precision three-body simulations\nare performed, from which, the equivalence-violating parameters are extracted\nwith Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling that takes full correlations into\naccount. We show that the difference in masses could be probed to\n$3\\times10^{-8}$, improving the current constraints from lunar laser ranging on\nthe post-Newtonian parameters that govern violations of $m_{\\cal P}=m_{\\cal I}$\nand $m_{\\cal A}=m_{\\cal P}$ by thousands and millions, respectively. The test\nof $m_{\\cal P}=m_{\\cal A}$ would represent the first test of Newton's third law\nwith compact objects.\n", "  The Kepler Mission has provided unprecedented, nearly continuous photometric\ndata of $\\sim$200,000 objects in the $\\sim$105 deg$^{2}$ field of view from the\nbeginning of science operations in May of 2009 until the loss of the second\nreaction wheel in May of 2013. The Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog contains\ninformation including but not limited to ephemerides, stellar parameters and\nanalytical approximation fits for every known eclipsing binary system in the\nKepler Field of View. Using Target Pixel level data collected from Kepler in\nconjunction with the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog, we identify false\npositives among eclipsing binaries, i.e. targets that are not eclipsing\nbinaries themselves, but are instead contaminated by eclipsing binary sources\nnearby on the sky and show eclipsing binary signatures in their light curves.\nWe present methods for identifying these false positives and for extracting new\nlight curves for the true source of the observed binary signal. For each\nsource, we extract three separate light curves for each quarter of available\ndata by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio, the relative percent eclipse\ndepth and the flux eclipse depth. We present 289 new eclipsing binaries in the\nKepler Field of View that were not targets for observation, and these have been\nadded to the Catalog. An online version of this Catalog with downloadable\ncontent and visualization tools is maintained at\nhttp://keplerEBs.villanova.edu.\n", "  The large field and wavelength range of MUSE is well suited to mapping\nGalactic planetary nebulae (PN). The bright PN NGC 7009 was observed with MUSE\non the VLT during the Science Verification of the instrument in seeing of 0.6\".\nEmission line maps in hydrogen Balmer and Paschen lines were formed from\nanalysis of the MUSE cubes. The measured electron temperature and density from\nthe MUSE cube were employed to predict the theoretical hydrogen line ratios and\nmap the extinction distribution across the nebula. After correction for the\ninterstellar extinction to NGC 7009, the internal dust-to-gas ratio (A_V/N_H)\nhas been mapped for the first time in a PN. The extinction map of NGC 7009 has\nconsiderable structure, broadly corresponding to the morphological features of\nthe nebula. A large-scale feature in the extinction map, consisting of a crest\nand trough, occurs at the rim of the inner shell. The nature of this feature\nwas investigated and instrumental and physical causes considered; no convincing\nmechanisms were identified to produce this feature, other than mass loss\nvariations in the earlier asymptotic giant branch phase. The dust-to-gas ratio\nA_V/N_H increases from 0.7 times the interstellar value to >5 times from the\ncentre towards the periphery of the ionized nebula. The integrated A_V/N_H is\nabout 2 times the mean ISM value. It is demonstrated that extinction mapping\nwith MUSE provides a powerful tool for studying the distribution of PN internal\ndust and the dust-to-gas ratio. (Abridged.)\n", "  It was recently proposed that a giant flare of the blazar PKS B1424-418 at\nredshift $z=1.522$ is in association with a PeV-energy neutrino event detected\nby IceCube. Based on this association we here suggest that the flight time\ndifference between the PeV neutrino and gamma-ray photons from blazar flares\ncan be used to constrain the violations of equivalence principle (EP) and the\nLorentz invariance for neutrinos. From the calculated Shapiro delay due to\nclusters or superclusters in the nearby universe, we find that violation of the\nequivalence principle for neutrinos and photons is constrained to an accuracy\nof at least $10^{-5}$, which is two orders of magnitude tighter than the\nconstraint placed by MeV neutrinos from supernova 1987A. Lorentz invariance\nviolation (LIV) arises in various quantum-gravity theories, which predicts an\nenergy-dependent velocity of propagation in vacuum for photons and neutrinos.\nWe find that the association of the PeV neutrino with the gamma-ray outburst\nset limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to $> 0.01 E_{pl}$ for linear\nLIV models and $>6\\times 10^{-8} E_{pl}$ for quadratic order LIV models, where\n$E_{pl}$ is the Planck energy scale. These are the most stringent constraints\non neutrino LIV for subluminal neutrinos.\n", "  Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar\nobjects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.\n", "  Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) provides a dispersion-canceled\naxial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the\nlight source and by artifacts in the images. A recent study using chirped-pulse\ninterferometry (CPI) has demonstrated dispersion-canceled and artifact-free OCT\nwith a classical system; however, unwanted background signals still remain\nafter removing the artifacts. Here, we propose a classical optical method that\nrealizes dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free OCT. We employ\na time-reversed system for Q-OCT with transform-limited input laser pulses to\nachieve dispersion-canceled OCT with a classical system. We have also\nintroduced a subtraction method to remove artifacts and background signals.\nWith these methods, we experimentally demonstrated dispersion-canceled,\nartifact-free, and background-free axial imaging of a coverglass and\ncross-sectional imaging of the surface of a coin.\n", "  We present the spectral and temporal properties of 15 candidate transient\nX-ray sources detected in archival {\\it XMM-Newton} and {\\it Chandra}\nobservations of the nearby Magellanic-type, SB(s)m galaxy NGC 55. On the basis\nof an X-ray color classification scheme, the majority of the sources may be\nidentified as X-ray binaries (XRBs), and six sources are soft, including a\nlikely supernova remnant. We perform a detailed spectral and variability\nanalysis of the data for two bright candidate XRBs. Both sources displayed\nstrong short-term X-ray variability, and their X-ray spectra and hardness\nratios are consistent with those of XRBs. These results, combined with their\nhigh X-ray luminosities ($\\sim 10^{38}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$), strongly suggest that\nthey are black hole (BH) binaries. Seven less luminous sources have spectral\nproperties consistent with those of neutron star or BH XRBs in both normal and\nhigh-rate accretion modes, but one of them is the likely counterpart to a\nbackground galaxy (because of positional coincidence). From the spectral\nanalysis, we find that the six soft sources are candidate super soft sources\n(SSSs), with dominant emission in the soft (0.3--2 keV) X-ray band. Archival\n{\\it Hubble Space Telescope} optical images for 7 sources are available, and\nthe data suggest that most of them are likely to be high-mass XRBs. Our\nanalysis has revealed the heterogeneous nature of the transient population in\nNGC 55 (6 high-mass XRBs, 1 low-mass XRBs, 6 SSSs, 1 active galactic nucleus),\nhelping establish the similarity of the X-ray properties of this galaxy to\nthose of other Magellanic-type galaxies.\n", "  The magnetization of a ferromagnet (F) driven out of equilibrium injects pure\nspin current into an adjacent conductor (N). Such F$|$N bilayers have become\nbasic building blocks in a wide variety of spin based devices. We evaluate the\nshot noise of the spin current traversing the F$|$N interface when F is\nsubjected to a coherent microwave drive. We find that the noise spectrum is\nfrequency independent up to the drive frequency, and increases linearly with\nfrequency thereafter. The low frequency noise indicates super-Poissonian spin\ntransfer, which results from quasi-particles with effective spin $\\hbar^* =\n\\hbar (1 + \\delta)$. For typical ferromagnetic thin films, $\\delta \\sim 1$ is\nrelated to the dipolar interaction-mediated squeezing of F eigenmodes.\n", "  An initial three-station version of the Event Horizon Telescope, a\nmillimeter-wavelength very-long baseline interferometer, has observed\nSagittarius A* (Sgr A*) repeatedly from 2007 to 2013, resulting in the\nmeasurement of a variety of interferometric quantities. Of particular\nimportance, there is now a large set of closure phases, measured over a number\nof independent observing epochs. We analyze these observations within the\ncontext of a realization of semi-analytic radiatively inefficient disk models,\nimplicated by the low luminosity of Sgr A*. We find a broad consistency among\nthe various observing epochs and between different interferometric data types,\nwith the latter providing significant support for this class of models of Sgr\nA*. The new data significantly tighten existing constraints on the spin\nmagnitude and its orientation within this model context, finding a spin\nmagnitude of $a=0.10^{+0.30+0.56}_{-0.10-0.10}$, an inclination with respect to\nthe line of sight of\n$\\theta={60^\\circ}^{+5^\\circ+10^\\circ}_{-8^\\circ-13^\\circ}$, and a position\nangle of $\\xi={156^\\circ}^{+10^\\circ+14^\\circ}_{-17^\\circ-27^\\circ}$ east of\nnorth. These are in good agreement with previous analyses. Notably, the\nprevious $180^\\circ$ degeneracy in the position angle has now been conclusively\nbroken by the inclusion of the closure phase measurements. A reflection\ndegeneracy in the inclination remains, permitting two localizations of the spin\nvector orientation, one of which is in agreement with the orbital angular\nmomentum of the infrared gas cloud G2 and the clockwise disk of young stars.\nThis possibly supports a relationship between Sgr A*'s accretion flow and these\nlarger-scale features.\n", "  This paper presents [CII], [CI] and CO emission line maps of the star-forming\nregions N66, N25+N26, and N88 in the metal-poor Local Group dwarf galaxy SMC.\nThe spatial and velocity structure of the large HII region N66 reveals an\nexpanding ring of shocked molecular gas centered on the exciting star cluster\nNGC346, whereas a more distant dense molecular cloud is being eroded by UV\nradiation from the same cluster. In the N25+N26 and N88 maps, diffuse [CII]\nemission at a relatively low surface brightness extends well beyond the compact\nboundaries of the bright emission associated with the [CII] regions. In all\nregions, the distribution of this bright [CII] emission and the less prominent\n[CI] emission closely follows the outline of the CO complexes, but the\nintensity of the [CII] and [CI] emission is generally anticorrelated, which can\nbe understood by the action of photodissociation and photoionization processes.\nNotwithstanding the overall similarity of CO and [CII] maps, the intensity\nratio of these lines varies significantly, mostly due to changes in CO\nbrightness. [CII] emission line profiles are up to 50% wider in velocity than\ncorresponding CO profiles. A radiative transfer analysis shows that the [CII]\nline is the dominant tracer of (CO-dark) molecular hydrogen in the SMC. CO\nemission traces only a minor fraction of the total amount of gas. The\nsimilarity of the spatial distribution and line profile shape, and the\ndominance of molecular gas associated with [[CII] rather than CO emission imply\nthat in the low-metallicity environment of the SMC the small amount of dense\nmolecular gas traced by CO is embedded in the much more extended molecular gas\ntraced only by [CII] emission. The contribution from neutral atomic and ionized\nhydrogen zones is negligible in the star-forming regions observed.\n", "  We present a stellar population analysis of quiescent (without H$\\alpha$\nemission) and bright ($M_{r}$ $<$ $-$21.5) early-type galaxies (ETGs) with\nrecent star formation. The ETGs are selected from a spectroscopic sample of\nSDSS galaxies at 0.04 $<$ $z$ $<$ 0.11 with {\\it WISE} mid-infrared (IR) and\n{\\it GALEX} near-ultraviolet (UV) emissions. We stack the optical spectra of\nETGs with different amounts of mid-IR and near-UV excess emissions to measure\nthe strength of 4000 \\AA{} break $D_{n}$4000 and the width of Balmer absorption\nline H$\\delta_{A}$ that are indicative of recent ($\\sim$1 Gyr) star formation\nactivity. The {\\it WISE} [3.4]$-$[12] colors show stronger correlations with\nthe spectral features than NUV$-r$ colors. We fit to the stacked spectra with a\nspectral fitting code, STARLIGHT, and find that the mass fraction of young\n($\\leq$1 Gyr) and intermediate-age ($\\sim$1$-$5 Gyr) stars in the ETGs with\nmid-IR excess emission is $\\sim$4$-$11\\%, depending on the template spectrum\nused for the fit. These results show that the ETGs with mid-IR excess emission\nhave experienced star formation within the last 1$-$5 Gyr and that the mid-IR\nemission is a useful diagnostic tool for probing recent star formation activity\nin ETGs.\n", "  The nature of various plausible causal links between sympathetic events is\nstill a controversial issue. In this work, we present multi-wavelength\nobservations of sympathetic eruptions, associated flares and coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) occurring on 2013 November 17 in two close-by active regions.\nTwo filaments i.e., F1 and F2 are observed in between the active regions.\nSuccessive magnetic reconnections, caused by different reasons (flux\ncancellation, shear and expansion) have been identified during the whole event.\nThe first reconnection occurred during the first eruption via flux cancellation\nbetween the sheared arcades overlying filament F2, creating a flux rope and\nleading to the first double ribbon solar flare. During this phase we observed\nthe eruption of overlaying arcades and coronal loops, which leads to the first\nCME. The second reconnection is believed to occur between the expanding flux\nrope of F2 and the overlying arcades of the filament F1. We suggest that this\nreconnection destabilized the equilibrium of filament F1, which further\nfacilitated its eruption. The third stage of reconnection occurred in the wake\nof the erupting filament F1 between the legs of overlying arcades. This may\ncreate a flux rope and the second double ribbon flare and a second CME. The\nfourth reconnection was between the expanding arcades of the erupting filament\nF1 and the nearby ambient field, which produced the bi-directional plasma flows\ntowards both upward and downward. Observations and a nonlinear force-free field\nextrapolation confirm the possibility of reconnection and the causal link\nbetween the magnetic systems.\n", "  SDSS J095253.83+011422.0 (SDSS J0952+0114) was reported by Hall et al. (2004)\nas an exotic quasar at $z_{\\rm em}=3.020$. In contrast to prominent broad\nmetal--line emissions with FWHM~9000 km/s, only a narrow Ly \\alpha emission\nline is present with FWHM~1000 km/s. The absence of broad Ly alpha emission\nline has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\\rm\nabs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the\ndamped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge. The PDLA\ncloud has a column density of $\\log N_{\\rm H\\,I}({\\rm cm}^{-2})=21.8\\pm0.2$, a\nmetallicity of [Zn/H]$>-1.0$, and a spatial extent exceeding the Narrow\nEmission Line Region (NELR) of the quasar. With a luminosity of $L_{{\\rm\nLy}\\alpha}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed\non the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous\nreports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar\noutflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a\nnatural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas\nin the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their\nsmall size and \"seeing fuzz\" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114\nanalogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs,\nas their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly\nalpha emissions. Our preliminary survey shows that such systems are not very\nrare. They are potentially a unique sample for probing strong quasar feedback\nphenomena in the early universe.\n", "  Context. Binary systems of supermassive black holes are expected to be strong\nsources of long gravitational waves prior to merging. These systems are good\ncandidates to be observed with forthcoming space-borne detectors. Only a few of\nthese systems, however, have been firmly identified to date.\n  Aims. We aim at providing a criterion for the identification of some\nsupermassive black hole binaries based on the characteristics of the\nhigh-energy emission of a putative relativistic jet launched from the most\nmassive of the two black holes.\n  Methods. We study supermassive black hole binaries where the less massive\nblack hole has carved an annular gap in the circumbinary disk, but nevertheless\nthere is a steady mass flow across its orbit. Such a perturbed disk is hotter\nand more luminous than a standard thin disk in some regions. Assuming that the\njet contains relativistic electrons, we calculate its broadband spectral energy\ndistribution focusing on the inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk photons.\nWe also compute the opacity to the gamma rays produced in the jet by photon\nannihilation with the disk radiation and take into account the effects of the\nanisotropy of the target photon field as seen from the jet.\n  Results. We find that the excess of low-energy photons radiated by the\nperturbed disk causes an increment in the external Compton emission from the\njet in the X-ray band, and a deep absorption feature at energies of tens of\nTeVs for some sets of parameters. According to our results, observations with\nCherenkov telescopes might help in the identification of supermassive black\nhole binaries, especially those black hole binaries that host primaries from\ntens to hundreds of million of solar masses.\n", "  It is quite likely that self-gravity will play an important role in the\nevolution of accretion discs, in particular those around young stars, and those\naround supermassive black holes. We summarise, here, our current understanding\nof the evolution of such discs, focussing more on discs in young stellar\nsystem, than on discs in active galactic nuclei. We consider the conditions\nunder which such discs may fragment to form bound objects, and when they might,\ninstead, be expected to settle into a quasi-steady, self-regulated state. We\nalso discuss how this understanding may depend on the mass of the disc relative\nto the mass of the central object, and how it might depend on the presence of\nexternal irradiation. Additionally, we consider whether or not fragmentation\nmight be stochastic, where we might expect it to occur in an actual\nprotostellar disc, and if there is any evidence for fragmentation actually\nplaying a role in the formation of planetary-mass bodies. Although there are\nstill a number of outstanding issue, such as the convergence of simulations of\nself-gravitating discs, whether or not there is more than one mode of\nfragmentation, and quite what role self-gravitating discs may play in the\nplanet formation process, our general understanding of these systems seems\nquite robust.\n", "  We present a homogeneous sample of 1361 L and T dwarfs brighter than J = 17.5\n(of which 998 are new), from an effective area of 3070 deg2, classified by the\nphoto-type method to an accuracy of one spectral sub-type using izYJHKW1W2\nphotometry from SDSS+UKIDSS+WISE. Other than a small bias in the early L types,\nthe sample is shown to be effectively complete to the magnitude limit, for all\nspectral types L0 to T8. The nature of the bias is an incompleteness estimated\nat 3% because peculiar blue L dwarfs of type L4 and earlier are classified late\nM. There is a corresponding overcompleteness because peculiar red (likely\nyoung) late M dwarfs are classified early L. Contamination of the sample is\nconfirmed to be small: so far spectroscopy has been obtained for 19 sources in\nthe catalogue and all are confirmed to be ultracool dwarfs. We provide\ncoordinates and izYJHKW1W2 photometry of all sources. We identify an apparent\ndiscontinuity, $\\Delta$m $\\sim$ 0.4 mag., in the Y-K colour between spectral\ntypes L7 and L8. We present near-infrared spectra of nine sources identified by\nphoto-type as peculiar, including a new low-gravity source ULAS\nJ005505.68+013436.0, with spectroscopic classification L2{$\\gamma$}. We provide\nrevised izYJHKW1W2 template colours for late M dwarfs, types M7 to M9.\n", "  In this paper we notice that extragalactic sources seem to have non-zero\nproper motions in the PPMXL proper motion catalog. We collect a large, all-sky\nsample of extragalactic objects and fit their reported PPMXL proper motions to\nan ensemble of spherical harmonics in magnitude shells. A magnitude dependent\nproper motion correction is thus constructed.\n  This correction is applied to a set of fundamental radio sources, quasars,\nand is compared to similar corrections to assess its utility. We publish, along\nwith this paper, code which may be used to correct proper motions in the PPMXL\ncatalog over the full sky which have 2 Micron All Sky Survey photometry.\n", "  Principal characteristics of interlayer interaction and relative motion of\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layers are investigated by the first-principles\nmethod taking into account van der Waals interactions. Dependences of the\ninterlayer interaction energy on relative translational displacement of h-BN\nlayers (potential energy surfaces) are calculated for two relative orientations\nof the layers, namely, for the layers aligned in the same direction and in the\nopposite directions upon relative rotation of the layers by 180 degrees. It is\nshown that the potential energy surfaces of bilayer h-BN can be approximated by\nthe first Fourier components determined by symmetry. As a result, a wide set of\nphysical qualintities describing relative motion of h-BN layers aligned in the\nsame direction including barriers to their relative sliding and rotation, shear\nmode frequency and shear modulus are determined by a single parameter\ncorresponding to the roughness of the potential energy surface, similar to\nbilayer graphene. The properties of h-BN layers aligned in the opposite\ndirections are described by two such parameters. The possibility of partial and\nfull dislocations in stacking of the layers is predicted for h-BN layers\naligned in the same and opposite directions, respectively. The extended\ntwo-chain Frenkel-Kontorova model is used to estimate the width and formation\nenergy of these dislocations on the basis of the calculated potential energy\nsurfaces.\n", "  The success of automatic classification of variable stars strongly depends on\nthe lightcurve representation. Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector\nof many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These\ndescriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate,\nrequire substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good\nperformance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation\nis not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are\ndesigned by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast\namounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean\nastronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and\nautomated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning\ncommunity to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually\ntuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this\nwork we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature\nlearning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a\nlarge number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,\nwhich are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.\nRepresentatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform\nlightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to\ntrain an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from\nboth labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the\nlearning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO\nand OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we\nachieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using\ntraditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.\n", "  Decadal-long radial velocity surveys have recently started to discover\nanalogs to the most influential planet of our solar system, Jupiter. Detecting\nand characterizing these worlds is expected to shape our understanding of our\nuniqueness in the cosmos. Despite the great successes of recent transit\nsurveys, Jupiter analogs represent a terra incognita, owing to the strong\nintrinsic bias of this method against long orbital periods. We here report on\nthe first validated transiting Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e (KOI-490.02),\ndiscovered using Kepler archival photometry orbiting the K4-dwarf KIC-3239945.\nWith a radius of $(0.91\\pm0.02)$ $R_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, a low orbital eccentricity\n($0.06_{-0.04}^{+0.10}$) and an equilibrium temperature of $(131\\pm3)$ K,\nKepler-167e bears many of the basic hallmarks of Jupiter. Kepler-167e is\naccompanied by three Super-Earths on compact orbits, which we also validate,\nleaving a large cavity of transiting worlds around the habitable-zone. With two\ntransits and continuous photometric coverage, we are able to uniquely and\nprecisely measure the orbital period of this post snow-line planet\n($1071.2323\\pm0.0006$ d), paving the way for follow-up of this $K=11.8$ mag\ntarget.\n", "  In order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of the\npre-planetary nebula (PPN) CRL 618, we perform 3D simulations using a\nmulti-directional bullet model. The optical lobes of CRL 618 and fast molecular\noutflows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have similar expansion\nages of ~ 100 yr. Additional fast molecular outflows were found near the source\nalong the outflow axes with ages of ~ 45 yr, suggesting a second episode of\nbullet ejections. Thus, in our simulations, two episodes of bullet ejections\nare assumed. The shaping process is simulated using the ZEUS-3D hydrodynamics\ncode that includes molecular and atomic cooling. In addition, molecular\nchemistry is also included to calculate the CO intensity maps. Our results show\nthe following: (1) Multi-epoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense core\ncan produce the collimated multiple lobes as seen in CRL 618. The total mass of\nthe bullets is ~ 0.034 solar mass, consistent with the observed high-velocity\nCO emission in fast molecular outflows. (2) The simulated CO J=3-2 intensity\nmaps show that the low-velocity cavity wall and the high-velocity outflows\nalong the lobes are reasonably consistent with the observations. The\nposition-velocity diagram of the outflows along the outflow axes shows a linear\nincrease of velocity with distance, similar to the observations. The ejections\nof these bullets could be due to magneto-rotational explosions or nova-like\nexplosions around a binary companion.\n", "  The total number of globular clusters (GCs) in a galaxy rises continuously\nwith the galaxy luminosity L, while the relative number of galaxies decreases\nwith L following the Schechter function. The product of these two very\nnonlinear functions gives the relative number of GCs contained by all galaxies\nat a given L. It is shown that GCs, in this universal sense, are most commonly\nfound in galaxies within a narrow range around $L_{\\star}$. In addition, blue\n(metal-poor) GCs outnumber the red (metal-richer) ones globally by 4 to 1 when\nall galaxies are added, pointing to the conclusion that the earliest stages of\ngalaxy formation were especially favorable to forming massive, dense star\nclusters.\n", "  We have developed a method for simulating the mesoscale compaction of early\nsolar system solids in low velocity impact events, using the iSALE shock\nphysics code. Chondrules are represented by nonporous disks, placed within a\nporous matrix. By simulating impacts into bimodal mixtures over a wide range of\nparameter space (including the chondrule-to-matrix ratio, the matrix porosity\nand composition and the impact velocity), we have shown how each of these\nparameters influences the shock processing of heterogeneous materials. The\ntemperature after shock processing shows a strong dichotomy: matrix\ntemperatures are elevated much higher than the chondrules, which remain largely\ncold. Chondrules can protect some matrix from shock compaction, with shadow\nregions in the lee side of chondrules exhibiting higher porosity that elsewhere\nin the matrix. Using the results from this mesoscale modelling, we show how the\n$\\varepsilon-\\alpha$ porous compaction model parameters depend on initial bulk\nporosity. We also show that the timescale for the temperature dichotomy to\nequilibrate is highly dependent on the porosity of the matrix after the shock,\nand will be on the order of seconds for matrix porosities of less than 0.1, and\non the order of 10's to 100's seconds for matrix porosities of $\\sim$ 0.3--0.5.\nFinally, we have shown that the composition of the post-shock material is able\nto match the bulk porosity and chondrule-to-matrix ratios of meteorite groups\nsuch as carbonaceous chondrites and unequilibrated ordinary chondrites.\n", "  We present the results of CCD UBV observations of the open cluster NGC 6819.\nWe calculated the stellar density profile in the cluster's field to determine\nthe structural parameters of NGC 6819. Using the existing astrometric data, we\ncalculated the probabilities of the stars being physical members of the\ncluster, and used these objects in the determination of the astrophysical\nparameters of NGC 6819. We inferred the reddening and metallicity of the\ncluster as $E(B-V)=0.130\\pm0.035$ mag and $[Fe/H]=+0.051\\pm 0.020$ dex,\nrespectively, using the U-B vs B-V two-colour diagram and UV excesses of the\nF-G type main-sequence stars. We fit the colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC6819\nwith the PARSEC isochrones and derived the distance modula, distance and age of\nthe cluster as $\\mu_{V}=12.22\\pm 0.10$ mag, $d=2309\\pm106$ pc and $t=2.4\\pm0.2$\nGyr, respectively. The parameters of the galactic orbit estimated for NGC 6819\nindicate that the cluster is orbiting in a slightly eccentric orbit of $e=0.06$\nwith a period of $P_{orb}=142$ Myr. The slope of the mass function estimated\nfor the cluster is close to the one found for the stars in the solar\nneighbourhood.\n", "  Recently, it has been found that off-centre carbon burning in a subset of\nintermediate-mass stars does not propagate all the way to the center, resulting\nin a class of hybrid CONe cores. Here, we consider the possibility that stars\nhosting these hybrid CONe cores might belong to a close binary system and,\neventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at\nrates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical\nphase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid\ncores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation\n(as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration\n(that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid\ncores are made of a central CO volume, of mass M(CO), surrounded by an ONe\nshell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation, a medium-sized CO-rich\nregion, M(CO)<0.4 Msun, results in the ejection of a small fraction of the\nmantle while leaving a massive bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of\nthe products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its\ninner regions, unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and\nshrinking phase of the remnant. In contrast, and somehow paradoxically, delayed\ndetonations do not leave remnants but for the minimum M(CO) we have explored,\nM(CO)=0.2 Msun, and even in this case the remnant is as small as 0.13 Msun. The\nejecta produced by these delayed detonations are characterized by slightly\nsmaller masses of 56Ni and substantially smaller kinetic energies than obtained\nfor a delayed detonation of a 'normal' CO white dwarf. The optical emission\nexpected from these explosions would hardly match the observational properties\nof typical Type Ia supernovae, although they make interesting candidates for\nthe subluminous class of SN2002cx-like or SNIax.\n", "  The census of solar neighbours is still complemented by new discoveries,\nmainly of very low-mass, faint dwarfs, close to or within the substellar\ndomain. These discoveries contribute to a better understanding of the field\npopulation; its origin in terms of Galactic dynamics and (sub)stellar formation\nand evolution. Also, the nearest stars and brown dwarfs at any given age allow\nthe most precise direct characterization, including the search for planetary\ncompanions. We aim to further assess the substellar census on the Galactic\nplane. We projected the 136 stars and 26 brown dwarfs known at <6.5 pc on the\nGalactic plane and evaluated their distributions. Stars present a uniform- and\nbrown dwarfs a non-uniform distribution, with 21 objects behind the Sun and\nonly five ahead relative to the direction of rotation of the Galaxy. This\nsubstellar configuration has a probability of 0.098$^{+10.878}_{-0.098}$%\nrelative to uniformity. The helio- and geocentric nature of the distribution\nsuggests it might result in part from an observational bias, which if\ncompensated for by future discoveries, might increase the brown-dwarf-to-star\nratio, shifting it closer to values found in some star forming regions.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been an important tool for astronomy for\nquite some time; however, the nature of their progenitors remains somewhat\nmysterious. Recent theoretical studies indicated the possibility of producing\nthermonuclear detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) at masses less\nthan the Chandrasekhar mass through accretion of helium-rich matter, which\nwould, depending on mass accretion rate, mass, and initial temperature of the\nWD, spectrally resemble either a normal SN Ia or a peculiar one. This study\naims to further resolve the state of binary systems comprised of a\nsub-Chandrasekhar-mass CO WD and a helium star at the point where an\naccretion-induced detonation occurs and constrains the part of the initial\nparameter space where this kind of phenomenon is possible. Preexisting data\nobtained through simulations of single, constantly accreting CO WDs is used as\nan indicator for the behavior of new binary models in which the WD is treated\nas a point mass and which include the non-degenerate partner as a fully\nresolved stellar model. We parameterize the ignition of the accumulated helium\nlayer, changes in the WD temperature, and changes in the CO core mass depending\non the mass transfer rate. The initial conditions allowing for detonation do\nnot form a single contiguous area in the parameter space, whose shape is\nprofoundly influenced by the behavior of the donor star. Mass loss due to Nova\noutbursts acts in favor of detonation. According to our criteria, about 10% of\nthe detonations in this study can be expected to show spectra consistent with\nordinary SNe Ia; the rest exhibit peculiar features.\n", "  The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the second-largest satellite galaxy of\nthe Milky Way and is only 60 kpc away. As a nearby, massive, and dense object\nwith relatively low astrophysical backgrounds, it is a natural target for dark\nmatter indirect detection searches. In this work, we use six years of Pass 8\ndata from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to search for gamma-ray signals of\ndark matter annihilation in the SMC. Using data-driven fits to the gamma-ray\nbackgrounds, and a combination of N-body simulations and direct measurements of\nrotation curves to estimate the SMC DM density profile, we found that the SMC\nwas well described by standard astrophysical sources, and no signal from dark\nmatter annihilation was detected. We set conservative upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section. These constraints are in agreement with\nstronger constraints set by searches in the Large Magellanic Cloud and approach\nthe canonical thermal relic cross section at dark matter masses lower than 10\nGeV in the $b\\bar{b}$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels.\n", "  We present the first observations of quiescent active regions (ARs) using\nNuSTAR, a focusing hard X-ray telescope capable of studying faint solar\nemission from high temperature and non-thermal sources. We analyze the first\ndirectly imaged and spectrally resolved X-rays above 2~keV from non-flaring\nARs, observed near the west limb on 2014 November 1. The NuSTAR X-ray images\nmatch bright features seen in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays. The NuSTAR\nimaging spectroscopy is consistent with isothermal emission of temperatures\n$3.1-4.4$~MK and emission measures $1-8\\times 10^{46}$~cm$^{-3}$. We do not\nobserve emission above 5~MK but our short effective exposure times restrict the\nspectral dynamic range. With few counts above 6~keV, we can place constraints\non the presence of an additional hotter component between 5 and 12~MK of $\\sim\n10^{46}$cm$^{-3}$ and $\\sim 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, at least an order\nof magnitude stricter than previous limits. With longer duration observations\nand a weakening solar cycle (resulting in an increased livetime), future NuSTAR\nobservations will have sensitivity to a wider range of temperatures as well as\npossible non-thermal emission.\n", "  Using a highly viscous magnetic fluid, the dynamics in the aftermath of the\nRosensweig instability can be slowed down by more than 2000 times. In this way\nwe expand the regime where the growth rate is predicted to scale linearly with\nthe bifurcation parameter by six orders of magnitude, while this regime is tiny\nfor standard ferrofluids and can not be resolved experimentally there. We\nmeasure the growth of the pattern by means of a two-dimensional imaging\ntechnique, and find that the slopes of the growth and decay rates are not the\nsame - a qualitative discrepancy to the theoretical predictions. We solve this\ndiscrepancy by taking into account a viscosity which is assumed to be different\nfor the growth and decay. This may be a consequence of the measured shear\nthinning of the ferrofluid.\n", "  The prediction of the PLANCK-constrained primordial lithium abundance in the\nUniverse is in discordance with the observed Li abundances in warm Population\nII dwarf and subgiant stars. Among the physically best motivated ideas, it has\nbeen suggested that this discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed\ntoday had undergone photospheric depletion of lithium. The cause of this\ndepletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium\nabundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal\nlaboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters\nof their stars can be precisely determined. We performed a homogeneous chemical\nabundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging\nfrom the cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. NLTE\nabundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived where possible. Stellar parameters\nwere derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V-I colour-magnitude\ndiagram. Independent effective temperatures were obtained from automated\nprofile fitting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-T_eff calibrations\nto the broadband photometry. Li abundances of the turnoff and early subgiant\nstars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the middle of the SGB\nas a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up.\nAbundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and Ca are observed and\ncompared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic\ndiffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the surface convection zone. The\ncomparison shows that the stars in M30 are affected by atomic diffusion and\nadditional mixing. After applying a conservative correction for atomic\ndiffusion, we find an initial Li abundance of A(Li) = $2.48\\pm0.10$ for the\nglobular cluster M30.\n", "  Aims: Previous observations of the young massive star formation region IRAS\n19410+2336 have revealed strong outflow activity with several interacting\noutflows. We aim to get a better understanding of the outflow activity in this\nregion by observing the SiO and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission with high angular\nresolution. SiO is known to trace shocked gas, which is often associated with\nyoung energetic outflows. With the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, we intend to better\nunderstand the distribution of the quiescent gaseous component of the region.\nMethods: The SiO observations in the J=2-1 v=0 transition and H$^{13}$CO$^+$\nJ=1-0 observations were performed by the Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\ncombined with IRAM 30 m single-dish observations, in order to get the missing\nshort-spacing information. We complement this new high-resolution observation\nwith earlier CO and H$_2$ data. Results: The SiO observations do not trace the\npreviously in CO and H$_2$ identified outflows well. Although we identify\nregions of highly increased SiO abundance indicative of shock interaction,\nthere are hardly any bipolar structures in the data. The southern part of the\nregion, which exhibits strong H$_2$ emission, shows almost no SiO. The CO and\nSiO data show only weak similarities, and the main SiO emission lies between\nthe two dominating dust clumps of the region. Conclusions: Most SiO emission is\nlikely to be a result of high-velocity shocks due to protostellar jets.\nHowever, this does not explain all the emission features and additional\neffects; for example, colliding gas flows at the interface of the two main\nregions may play an important role in the origin of the emission. The present\nSiO data show that several different effects can influence SiO emission, which\nmakes the interpretation of SiO data more difficult than often assumed.\n", "  We investigate Non-Linear Plane-Wave solutions of the classical Minkowskian\nYang-Mills (YM) equations of motion. By imposing a suitable ansatz which solves\nGauss' law for the $SU(3)$ theory, we derive solutions which consist of Jacobi\nelliptic functions depending on an enumerable set of elliptic modulus values.\nThe solutions represent periodic anharmonic plane waves which possess arbitrary\nnon-zero mass and are exact extrema of the non-linear YM action. Among them, a\nunique harmonic plane wave with a non-trivial pattern in phase, spin and color\nis identified. Similar solutions are present in the $SU(4)$ case while are\nabsent from the $SU(2)$ theory.\n", "  We report on timing, flux density, and polarimetric observations of the\ntransient magnetar and 5.54 s radio pulsar XTE J1810-197 using the GBT, Nancay,\nand Parkes radio telescopes beginning in early 2006, until its sudden\ndisappearance as a radio source in late 2008. Repeated observations through\n2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star,\nas inferred from its rotation frequency derivative f-dot, decreased in an\nunsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the first year of radio monitoring. In\ncontrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque\ndecreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after\ndecreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring,\nremained steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7+/-0.3 mJy at 1.4\nGHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a few. There is\nevidence that during this last phase of radio activity the magnetar had a steep\nradio spectrum, in contrast to earlier behavior. There was no secular decrease\nthat presaged its radio demise. During this time the pulse profile continued to\ndisplay large variations, and polarimetry indicates that the magnetic geometry\nremained consistent with that of earlier times. We supplement these results\nwith X-ray timing of the pulsar from its outburst in 2003 up to 2014. For the\nfirst 4 years, XTE J1810-197 experienced non-monotonic excursions in f-dot by\nat least a factor of 8. But since 2007, its f-dot has remained relatively\nstable near its minimum observed value. The only apparent event in the X-ray\nrecord that is possibly contemporaneous with the radio shut-down is a decrease\nof ~20% in the hot-spot flux in 2008-2009, to a stable, minimum value. However,\nthe permanence of the high-amplitude, thermal X-ray pulse, even after the radio\ndemise, implies continuing magnetar activity.\n", "  Whitbourn & Shanks (2014) have reported evidence for a local void underdense\nby ~15% extending to 150-300h-1Mpc around our position in the Southern Galactic\nCap (SGC). Assuming a local luminosity function they modelled K- and r-limited\nnumber counts and redshift distributions in the 6dFGS/2MASS and SDSS redshift\nsurveys and derived normalised n(z) ratios relative to the standard homogeneous\ncosmological model. Here we test further these results using maximum likelihood\ntechniques that solve for the galaxy density distributions and the galaxy\nluminosity function simultaneously. We confirm the results from the previous\nanalysis in terms of the number density distributions, indicating that our\ndetection of the 'Local Hole' in the SGC is robust to the assumption of either\nour previous, or newly estimated, luminosity functions. However, there are\ndiscrepancies with previously published K and r band luminosity functions. In\nparticular the r-band luminosity function has a steeper faint end slope than\nthe r0.1 results of Blanton et al. (2003) but is consistent with the r0.1\nresults of Montero-Dorta & Prada (2009); Loveday et al. (2012).\n", "  We explore the role of the modified Eddington limit due to rapid rotation\n(the so-called $\\Omega\\Gamma-$limit) in the formation of Population III stars.\nWe performed one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations of mass-accreting\nzero-metallicity protostars at a very high rate ($\\dot{M} \\sim\n10^{-3}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot~yr^{-1}}$) and dealt with stellar rotation as a\nseparate post-process. The protostar would reach the Keplerian rotation very\nsoon after the onset of mass accretion, but mass accretion would continue as\nstellar angular momentum is transferred outward to the accretion disk by\nviscous stress. The protostar envelope expands rapidly when the stellar mass\nreaches $5\\sim7~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and the Eddington factor sharply increases.\nThis makes the protostar rotate critically at a rate that is significantly\nbelow the Keplerian value (i.e., the $\\Omega\\Gamma-$limit). The resultant\npositive gradient of the angluar velocity in the boundary layer between the\nprotostar and the Keplerian disk prohibits angular momentum transport from the\nstar to the disk, and consequently further rapid mass accretion. This would\nprevent the protostar from growing significantly beyond $20 -\n40~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. Another important consequence of the $\\Omega\\Gamma-$limit\nis that the protostar can remain fairly compact ($R \\lesssim\n50~\\mathrm{R_\\odot}$) and avoid a fluffy structure ($R \\gtrsim\n500~\\mathrm{R_\\odot}$) that is usually found with a very high mass accretion\nrate. This effect would make the protostar less prone to binary interactions\nduring the protostar phase. Although our analysis is based on Pop III protostar\nmodels, this role of the $\\Omega\\Gamma-$limit would be universal in the\nformation process of massive stars, regardless of metallicity.\n", "  (abridged) Context. Wide binaries are a potential pathway for the formation\nof hot Jupiters. The binary fraction among host stars is an important\ndiscriminator between competing formation theories, but has not been well\ncharacterised. Additionally, contaminating light from unresolved stars can\nsignificantly affect the accuracy of photometric and spectroscopic measurements\nin studies of transiting exoplanets. Aims. We observed 101 transiting exoplanet\nhost systems in the Southern hemisphere in order to create a homogeneous\ncatalogue of both bound companion stars and contaminating background stars. We\ninvestigate the binary fraction among the host stars in order to test theories\nfor the formation of hot Jupiters, in an area of the sky where transiting\nexoplanetary systems have not been systematically searched for stellar\ncompanions. Methods. Lucky imaging observations from the Two Colour Instrument\non the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla were used to search for previously\nunresolved stars at small angular separations. The separations and relative\nmagnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to\n10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how\nlikely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide\nmeasurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcseconds of our sample of\n101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcseconds of a host\nstar, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these.\nCalibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour\nInstrument are presented. Conclusions. We find that the overall multiplicity\nrate of the host stars is 38 +17 -13%, consistent with the rate among\nsolar-type stars in our sensitivity range, suggesting that planet formation\ndoes not preferentially occur in long period binaries compared to a random\nsample of field stars.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the available X-ray data collected by INTEGRAL,\nSwift, and XMM-Newton during the first outburst of the INTEGRAL transient IGR\nJ17451-3022, discovered in 2014 August. The monitoring observations provided by\nthe JEM-X instruments on-board INTEGRAL and the Swift/XRT showed that the event\nlasted for about 9 months and that the emission of the source remained soft for\nthe entire period. The source emission is dominated by a thermal component\n(kT~1.2 keV), most likely produced by an accretion disk. The XMM-Newton\nobservation carried out during the outburst revealed the presence of multiple\nabsorption features in the soft X-ray emission that could be associated to the\npresence of an ionized absorber lying above the accretion disk, as observed in\nmany high-inclination low mass X-ray binaries. The XMM-Newton data also\nrevealed the presence of partial and rectangular X-ray eclipses (lasting about\n820 s), together with dips. The latter can be associated with increases in the\noverall absorption column density in the direction of the source. The detection\nof two consecutive X-ray eclipses in the XMM-Newton data allowed us to estimate\nthe source orbital period at 22620.5(-1.8,+2.0) s (1{\\sigma} c.l.).\n", "  We demonstrate optomechanical quantum control of the internal electronic\nstates of a diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in the resolved-sideband\nregime by coupling the NV to both optical fields and surface acoustic waves via\na phonon-assisted optical transition and by taking advantage of the strong\nexcited-state electron-phonon coupling of a NV center. Optomechanically-driven\nRabi oscillations as well as quantum interferences between the optomechanical\nsideband and the direct dipole-optical transitions have been realized. These\nstudies open the door to using resolved-sideband optomechanical coupling for\nquantum control of both the atom-like internal states and the motional states\nof a coupled NV-nanomechanical system, leading to the development of a\nsolid-state analog of trapped ions.\n", "  Longitudinal intensity oscillations along coronal loops that are interpreted\nas signatures of magneto-acoustic waves are observed frequently in different\ncoronal structures. The aim of this paper is to estimate the physical\nparameters of the slow waves and the quantitative dependence of these\nparameters on their frequencies in the solar corona loops that are situated\nabove active regions with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar\nDynamic Observatory (SDO). The observed data on 2012-Feb-12, consisting of 300\nimages with an interval of 24 seconds in the 171 $\\rm{\\AA}$ and 193 $\\rm{\\AA}$\npassbands is analyzed for evidence of propagating features as slow waves along\nthe loop structures. Signatures of longitudinal intensity oscillations that are\ndamped rapidly as they travel along the loop structures were found, with\nperiods in the range of a few minutes to few tens of minutes. Also, the\nprojected (apparent) phase speeds, projected damping lengths, damping times and\ndamping qualities of filtered intensities centred on the dominant frequencies\nare measured in the range of $\\rm{C_s}\\simeq 38-79~ \\rm {km~s^{-1}}$,\n$\\rm{L_d}\\simeq 23-68 ~\\rm{Mm }$, $\\rm{\\tau_d}\\simeq 7- 21 ~\\rm {min}$ and\n$\\rm{\\tau_d/P}\\simeq 0.34- 0.77$, respectively. The theoretical and\nobservational results of this study indicate that the damping times and damping\nlengths increase with increasing the oscillation periods, and are highly\nsensitive function of oscillation period, but the projected speeds and the\ndamping qualities are not very sensitive to the oscillation periods.\nFurthermore, the magnitude values of physical parameters are in good agreement\nwith the prediction of the theoretical dispersion relations of high-frequency\nMHD waves ($>1.1~ \\rm{mHz}$) in a coronal plasma with electron number density\nin the range of $\\rm{n_e}\\simeq 10^{7} - 10^{12} ~\\rm{cm^{-3}}$.\n", "  4U 1323-619 is a low mass X-ray binary system that shows type I X-ray bursts\nand dips. The most accurate estimation of the orbital period is 2.941923(36)\nhrs and a distance from the source that is lower than 11 kpc has been proposed.\nWe aim to obtain the orbital ephemeris, the orbital period of the system, as\nwell as its derivative to compare the observed luminosity with that predicted\nby the theory of secular evolution. We took the advantage of about 26 years of\nX-ray data and grouped the selected observations when close in time. We folded\nthe light curves and used the timing technique, obtaining 12 dip arrival times.\nWe fit the delays of the dip arrival times both with a linear and a quadratic\nfunction. We locate 4U 1323-619 within a circular area centred at RA (J2000)=\n201.6543\\degree and DEC (J2000)= -62.1358\\degree with an associated error of\n0.0002\\degree, and confirm the detection of the IR counterpart already\ndiscussed in literature. We estimate an orbital period of P=2.9419156(6) hrs\ncompatible with the estimations that are present in the literature, but with an\naccuracy ten times higher. We also obtain a constraint on the orbital period\nderivative for the first time, estimating $\\dot{P}=(8\\pm 13)\\times 10^{-12}$\ns/s. Assuming that the companion star is in thermal equilibrium in the lower\nmain sequence, and is a neutron star of 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$, we infer a mass of\n0.28$\\pm$0.03 M$_{\\odot}$ for the companion star. Assuming a distance of 10\nkpc, we obtained a luminosity of (4.3$\\pm$0.5)$\\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nwhich is not in agreement with what is predicted by the theory of secular\nevolution. Using a 3D extinction map of the K$_{s}$ radiation in our Galaxy, we\nobtain a distance of 4.2$^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ kpc at 68\\% confidence level.\n(Abridged)\n", "  We present the discovery of a new satellite of asteroid (130) Elektra -\nS/2014 (130) 1 - in differential imaging and in integral field spectroscopy\ndata over multiple epochs obtained with SPHERE/VLT. This new (second) moonlet\nof Elektra is about 2 km across, on an eccentric orbit and about 500 km away\nfrom the primary. For a comparative study, we also observed another triple\nasteroid system (93) Minerva. For both systems, component-resolved reflectance\nspectra of the satellites and primary were obtained simultaneously. No\nsignificant spectral difference was observed between the satellites and the\nprimary for either triple system. We find that the moonlets in both systems are\nmore likely to have been created by sub-disruptive impacts as opposed to having\nbeen captured.\n", "  Giant impacts refer to collisions between two objects each of which is\nmassive enough to be considered at least a planetary embryo. The putative\ncollision suffered by the proto-Earth that created the Moon is a prime example,\nthough most Solar System bodies bear signatures of such collisions. Current\nplanet formation models predict that an epoch of giant impacts may be\ninevitable, and observations of debris around other stars are providing\nmounting evidence that giant impacts feature in the evolution of many planetary\nsystems. This chapter reviews giant impacts, focussing on what we can learn\nabout planet formation by studying debris around other stars. Giant impact\ndebris evolves through mutual collisions and dynamical interactions with\nplanets. General aspects of this evolution are outlined, noting the importance\nof the collision-point geometry. The detectability of the debris is discussed\nusing the example of the Moon-forming impact. Such debris could be detectable\naround another star up to 10Myr post-impact, but model uncertainties could\nreduce detectability to a few 100yr window. Nevertheless the 3% of young stars\nwith debris at levels expected during terrestrial planet formation provide\nvaluable constraints on formation models; implications for super-Earth\nformation are also discussed. Variability recently observed in some bright\ndisks promises to illuminate the evolution during the earliest phases when\nvapour condensates may be optically thick and acutely affected by the\ncollision-point geometry. The outer reaches of planetary systems may also\nexhibit signatures of giant impacts, such as the clumpy debris structures seen\naround some stars.\n", "  The supernova remnant (SNR) G338.3-0.0 spatially correlates with HESS\nJ1640-465, which is considered the most luminous gamma-ray source associated\nwith a SNR in our Galaxy. The X-ray pulsar PSR J1640-4631 has been recently\ndiscovered within the SNR shell, which could favor a leptonic origin for the\ndetected very-high energy (VHE) emission. In spite of this, the origin of the\nVHE radiation from HESS J1640-465 has not been unambiguously clarified so far.\nIndeed, a hadronic explanation cannot be ruled out by current observations. On\nthe basis of atomic (HI) and molecular (12^CO) archival data, we determine, for\nthe first time, the total ambient density of protons in the region of the\nG338.3-0.0/HESS J1640-465 system, a critical parameter for understanding the\nemission mechanisms at very high energies. The value obtained is in the 100-130\ncm^-3 range. Besides this, we developed a new hadronic model to describe the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of the HESS J1640-465 source, which includes\nthe latest total gamma-ray cross-section for proton-proton collisions available\nin the literature. By using the assessed ambient proton density, we found that\nthe total energy in accelerated protons required to fit the data is\n5.4^{+4.7}_{-2.3} x 10^49 erg and 1.6^{+1.4}_{-0.7} x 10^50 erg for a source\ndistance of 8.5 and 13 kpc, respectively. The case where the source distance is\n8.5 kpc agrees with the typical scenario in which the energy released is on the\norder of 10^51 erg and ~10% of that energy is transferred to the accelerated\nprotons, whereas the case corresponding to a source distance of 13 kpc requires\neither a higher value of the energy released in the explosion or a larger\nenergy fraction to accelerate protons.\n", "  Aims: We report the discovery of a young lithium rich giant, HD 16771, in the\ncore-helium burning phase that does not seem to fit existing proposals of Li\nsynthesis near the luminosity function bump or during He-core flash. We aim to\nunderstand the nature of Li enrichment in the atmosphere of HD 16771 by\nexploring various Li enhancement scenarios. Methods: We have collected\nhigh-resolution echelle spectra of HD 16771 and derived stellar parameters and\nchemical abundances for 27 elements by either line equivalent widths or\nsynthetic spectrum analyses. Results: HD 16771 is a Li-rich\n(log(n(Li))=+2.67+/-0.10 dex) intermediate mass giant star (M=2.4+/-0.1 Msun)\nwith age=0.76+/-0.13 Gyr and located at the red giant clump. Kinematics and\nchemical compositions are consistent with HD 16771 being a member of the\nGalactic thin disk population. The non-detection of 6Li(< 3%), a low carbon\nisotopic ratio (12C/13C=12+/-2), and the slow rotation (vsini=2.8 km/s) all\nsuggest that lithium might have been synthesized in this star. On the contrary,\nHD 16771 with a mass of 2.4 Msun has no chance of encountering luminosity\nfunction bump and He-core flash where the possibility of fast deep-mixing for\nLi enrichment in K giants has been suggested previously. Conclusions: Based of\nthe evolutionary status of this star, we discuss the possibility that 7Li\nsynthesis in HD 16771 is triggered by the engulfment of close-in planet(s)\nduring the RGB phase.\n", "  When searching for a marked vertex in a graph, Szegedy's usual search\noperator is defined by using the transition probability matrix of the random\nwalk with absorbing barriers at the marked vertices. Instead of using this\noperator, we analyze searching with Szegedy's quantum walk by using reflections\naround the marked vertices, that is, the standard form of quantum query. We\nshow we can boost the probability to 1 of finding a marked vertex in the\ncomplete graph. Numerical simulations suggests that the success probability can\nbe improved for other graphs, like the two-dimensional grid. We also prove\nthat, for a certain class of graphs, we can express Szegedy's search operator,\nobtained from the absorbing walk, using the standard query model.\n", "  The dynamics of two ultra-cold bosons confined in a one-dimensional\ndouble-well potential is studied. We compare the exact dynamics governed by a\nfull two-body Hamiltonian with the dynamics obtained in a two-mode model\napproximation. We show that for sufficiently large interactions the two-mode\nmodel breaks down and higher single-particle states have to be taken into\naccount to describe the dynamical properties of the system correctly.\n", "  The formation of an Ha filament in active region (AR) 10953 is described.\nObservations from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard the Hinode satellite\nstarting on 27th April 2007 until 1st May 2007 were analysed. 20 scans of the\n6302A Fe I line pair recorded by SOT/SP were inverted using the SPINOR code.\nThe inversions were analysed together with SOT/BFI G-band and Ca II H and\nSOT/NFI Ha observations. Following the disappearance of an initial Ha filament\naligned along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR, a new Ha filament\nformed in its place some 20 hours later, which remained stable for at least 1.5\ndays. The creation of the new Ha filament was driven by the ascent of\nhorizontal magnetic fields from the photosphere into the chromosphere at three\nseparate locations along the PIL. The magnetic fields at two of these locations\nwere situated directly underneath the initial Ha filament and formed orphan\npenumbrae already aligned along the Ha filament channel. The 700 G orphan\npenumbrae were stable and trapped in the photosphere until the disappearance of\nthe overlying initial Ha filament, after which they started to ascend into the\nchromosphere at 10pm5 m/s. Each ascent was associated with a simultaneous\nmagnetic flux reduction of up to 50% in the photosphere. The ascended orphan\npenumbrae formed dark 'seed' structures in Ha in parallel with the PIL, which\nelongated and merged to form an Ha filament. The filament channel featured\nhorizontal magnetic fields of on average 260 G at log(tau)=-2 suspended above\nthe nearly field-free lower photosphere. The fields took on an 'inverse'\nconfiguration at log(tau)=-2 suggesting a flux rope for the new Ha filament.\nThe orphan penumbral fields ascend into the chromosphere 9-24 hours before the\nHa filament is fully formed. The destruction of the initial Ha filament was\nlikely caused by the flux emergence at the third location along the PIL.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the static spherically symmetric solutions in\nde Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) theory. Since the diffeomorphism invariance can\nbe restored by introducing the St\\\"{u}ckelberg fields $\\phi^a$, there is new\ninvariant $I^{ab}=g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi^a\\partial_\\nu\\phi^b$ in the\nmassive gravity, which adds to the ones usually encountered in general\nrelativity (GR). In the unitary gauge $\\phi^a=x^\\mu\\delta_\\mu^a$, any inverse\nmetric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ that has divergence including the coordinate singularity in\nGR would exhibit a singularity in the invariant $I^{ab}$. Therefore, there is\nno conventional Schwarzschild metric if we choose unitary gauge. In this paper,\nwe obtain a self-consistent static spherically symmetric ansatz in the\nnonunitary gauge. Under this ansatz, we find that there are seven solutions\nincluding the Schwarzschild solution, Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m solution and five\nother solutions. These solutions may possess an event horizon depending upon\nthe physical parameters (Schwarzschild radius $r_s$, scalar charge $S$ and/or\nelectric charge $Q$). If these solutions possess an event horizon, we show that\nthe singularity of $I^{ab}$ is absent at the horizon. Therefore, these\nsolutions may become candidates for black holes in dRGT.\n", "  A radiopure cadmium tungstate crystal scintillator, enriched in $^{106}$Cd to\n66%, with mass of 216 g ($^{106}$CdWO$_4$), was used to search for double beta\ndecay processes in $^{106}$Cd in coincidence with four ultra-low background\nhigh purity germanium detectors in a single cryostat. New improved limits on\nthe double beta processes in $^{106}$Cd have been set on the level of $10^{20}-\n10^{21}$ yr after 13085 h of data taking. In particular, the half-life limit on\nthe two neutrino electron capture with positron emission,\n$T_{1/2}^{2\\nu\\varepsilon\\beta^+}\\geq 1.1\\times 10^{21}$ yr, has reached the\nregion of theoretical predictions. With this half-life limit the effective\nnuclear matrix element for the $2\\nu\\varepsilon\\beta^+$ decay is bounded as\n$M^{2\\nu\\varepsilon\\beta^+}_{eff}\\le 1.1$. The resonant neutrinoless double\nelectron captures to the 2718 keV, 2741 keV and 2748 keV excited states of\n$^{106}$Pd are restricted at the level of $T_{1/2} \\geq\n(8.5\\times10^{20}-1.4\\times10^{21}$) yr.\n", "  We argue that if particularly powerful electromagnetic afterglows of the\ngravitational waves bursts will be observed in the future, this could be used\nas a strong observational support for some suggested quantum alternatives for\nblack holes (e.g., firewalls and gravastars). A universal absence of powerful\nafterglows should be taken as a suggestive argument against such hypothetical\nquantum-gravity objects.\n", "  Hadronic diffractive processes characterised by a hard scale (hard\ndiffraction) contain a nontrivial interplay of hard and soft, nonperturbative\ninteractions, which breaks down factorisation of short and long distances. On\nthe contrary to the expectations based on the factorization hypothesis,\nassuming that hard diffraction is a higher twist, these processes should be\nclassified as a leading twist. We overview various implications of this\nimportant observation for diffractive radiation of Abelian (Drell-Yan, gauge\nbosons, Higgs boson) and non-Abelian (heavy flavors) particles, as well as\ndirect coalescence into the Higgs boson of the non-perturbative intrinsic heavy\nflavour component of the hadronic wave function.\n", "  Sub-arcsecond images of the rotational line emission of CS and SO have been\nobtained toward the Class I protostar IRAS 04365$+$2535 in TMC-1A with ALMA. A\ncompact component around the protostar is clearly detected in the CS and SO\nemission. The velocity structure of the compact component of CS reveals\ninfalling-rotating motion conserving the angular momentum. It is well explained\nby a ballistic model of an infalling-rotating envelope with the radius of the\ncentrifugal barrier (a half of the centrifugal radius) of 50 AU, although the\ndistribution of the infalling gas is asymmetric around the protostar. The\ndistribution of SO is mostly concentrated around the radius of the centrifugal\nbarrier of the simple model. Thus a drastic change in chemical composition of\nthe gas infalling onto the protostar is found to occur at a 50 AU scale\nprobably due to accretion shocks, demonstrating that the infalling material is\nsignificantly processed before being delivered into the disk.\n", "  We show how Yang-Mills theory on $S^3\\times R$ can exhibit a spectrum with\ncontinuous bands if coupled either to a topological 3-form gauge field, or to a\ndynamical axion with heavy Peccei-Quinn scale. The basic mechanism consists in\nassociating winding histories to a bosonic zero mode whose role is to convert a\ncircle in configuration space into a helix. The zero mode is, respectively, the\nholonomy of the 3-form field or the axion momentum. In these models different\ntheta sectors coexist but are not mixed by local operators. Our analysis sheds\nlight on, and extends Seiberg's proposal for modifying the topological sums in\nquantum field theories. It refutes a recent claim that $B+L$ violation at LHC\nis unsuppressed.\n", "  We present long-baseline Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)\nobservations of the 870 micron continuum emission from the nearest gas-rich\nprotoplanetary disk, around TW Hya, that trace millimeter-sized particles down\nto spatial scales as small as 1 AU (20 mas). These data reveal a series of\nconcentric ring-shaped substructures in the form of bright zones and narrow\ndark annuli (1-6 AU) with modest contrasts (5-30%). We associate these features\nwith concentrations of solids that have had their inward radial drift slowed or\nstopped, presumably at local gas pressure maxima. No significant\nnon-axisymmetric structures are detected. Some of the observed features occur\nnear temperatures that may be associated with the condensation fronts of major\nvolatile species, but the relatively small brightness contrasts may also be a\nconsequence of magnetized disk evolution (the so-called zonal flows). Other\nfeatures, particularly a narrow dark annulus located only 1 AU from the star,\ncould indicate interactions between the disk and young planets. These data\nsignal that ordered substructures on ~AU scales can be common, fundamental\nfactors in disk evolution, and that high resolution microwave imaging can help\ncharacterize them during the epoch of planet formation.\n", "  We made near infrared multicolor imaging observations of a disk around Herbig\nBe star HD100546 using Gemini/NICI. K (2.2\\,$\\mu$m), H$_2$O ice (3.06\\,$\\mu$m),\nand L'(3.8\\,$\\mu$m) disk images were obtained and we found the 3.1\\,$\\mu$m\nabsorption feature in the scattered light spectrum, likely due to water ice\ngrains at the disk surface. We compared the observed depth of the ice\nabsorption feature with the disk model based on \\cite{Oka2012} including water\nice photodesorption effect by stellar UV photons. The observed absorption depth\ncan be explained by the both disk models with/without photodesorption effect\nwithin the measurement accuracy, but slightly favors the model with\nphotodesorption effects, implying that the UV photons play an important role on\nthe survival/destruction of ice grains at the Herbig Ae/Be disk surface.\nFurther improvement on the accuracy of the observations of the water ice\nabsorption depth is needed to constrain the disk models.\n", "  In this contribution, we investigate the effects of using in-plane polarized\npiezo actuators with topological buckling displacement to drive glass-piezo\ncomposite membranes for adaptive lenses with aspherical control. We find that\nthe effects on the focal power and aspherical tuning range are relatively\nsmall, whereas the tuning speed is improved significantly with a first\nresonance of 1 kHz for a 13 mm aperture lens.\n", "  We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the optical transient\nLSQ13zm. Historical data reveal the presence of an eruptive episode (that we\nlabel as `2013a') followed by a much brighter outburst (`2013b') three weeks\nlater, that we argue to be the genuine supernova explosion. This sequence of\nevents closely resemble those observed for SN2010mc and (in 2012) SN2009ip. The\nabsolute magnitude reached by LSQ13zm during 2013a\n($M_R=-14.87\\pm0.25\\,\\rm{mag}$) is comparable with those of supernova\nimpostors, while that of the 2013b event ($M_R=-18.46\\pm0.21\\,\\rm{mag}$) is\nconsistent with those of interacting supernovae. Our spectra reveal the\npresence of a dense and structured circumstellar medium, probably produced\nthrough numerous pre-supernova mass-loss events. In addition, we find evidence\nfor high-velocity ejecta, with a fraction of gas expelled at more than\n20000\\kms. The spectra of LSQ13zm show remarkable similarity with those of\nwell-studied core-collapse supernovae. From the analysis of the available\nphotometric and spectroscopic data, we conclude that we first observed the last\nevent of an eruptive sequence from a massive star, likely a Luminous Blue\nVariable, which a short time later exploded as a core-collapse supernova. The\ndetailed analysis of archival images suggest that the host galaxy is a\nstar-forming Blue Dwarf Compact Galaxy.\n", "  One of the most remarkable aspects of our species is that while we show\nsurprisingly little genetic diversity, we demonstrate astonishing amounts of\ncultural diversity. Perhaps most impressive is the diversity of our\ntechnologies, broadly defined as all the physical objects we produce and the\nskills we use to produce them. Despite considerable focus on the evolution of\ntechnology by social scientists and philosophers, there have been few attempts\nto systematically quantify technological diversity and therefore the dynamics\nof technological change remain poorly understood. Here we show a novel Bayesian\nmodel for examining technological diversification adopted from paleontological\nanalysis of occurrence data. We use this framework to estimate the tempo of\ndiversification in American car and truck models produced between 1896 and 2014\nand to test the relative importance of competition and extrinsic factors in\nshaping changes in macroevolutionary rates. Our results identify a four-fold\ndecrease in the origination and extinction rates of car models and a negative\nnet diversification rate over the last thirty years. We also demonstrate that\ncompetition played a more significant role in car model diversification than\neither changes in oil prices or gross domestic product. Together our analyses\nprovide a set of tools that can enhance current research on technological and\ncultural evolution by providing a flexible and quantitative framework for\nexploring the dynamics of diversification.\n", "  The thermodynamical cluster model is known to present a first-order\nliquid-gas phase transition in the idealized case of an uncharged, infinitely\nextended medium. However, in most practical applications of this model, the\nsystem is finite and charged. In this paper we study how the phase diagram is\nmodified by finite size and Coulomb effects.\n  We show that the thermodynamic anomalies which are associated to the finite\nsystem counterpart of first order phase transitions, are correctly reproduced\nby this effective model. However, approximations in the calculation of the\ngrandcanonical partition sum prevent obtaining the exact mapping between\nstatistical ensembles which should be associated to finite systems. The\nensemble inequivalence associated to the transition persists in the presence of\nCoulomb, but the phase diagram is deeply modified with respect to the simple\nliquid-gas phase transition characteristic of the neutral system.\n", "  Isoscaling and isobaric yield ratio parameters are compared from canonical\nand grand canonical ensembles when applied to multifragmentation of finite\nnuclei. Source dependence of isoscaling parameters and source and isospin\ndependence of isobaric yield ratio parameters are examined in the framework of\nthe canonical and the grand canonical models. It is found that as the nucleus\nfragments more, results from both the ensembles converge and observables\ncalculated from the canonical ensemble coincide more with those obtained from\nthe formulae derived using the grand canonical ensemble.\n", "  A class of semi-discrete chains of the form $t_{1x} = f(x, t, t_1, t_x)$ is\nconsidered. For the given chains easily verifiable conditions for existence of\nx-integral of minimal order 4 are obtained.\n", "  We study theoretically ultracold collisions in quasi one-dimensional optical\ntraps for bosonic and fermionic reactive molecules in the presence of a\nperiodic potential along the trap axis. Elastic, reactive, and umklapp\nprocesses due to non-conservation of the center of mass motion are investigated\nfor parameters of relevant experimental interest. The model naturally keeps\ninto account the effect of excited energy bands and is particularly suited for\nbeing adapted to rigorous close-coupled calculations. Our formalism shows that\na correct derivation of the parameters in tight-binding effective models must\ninclude the strong momentum dependence of the coupling constant we predict even\nfor deep lattices.\n", "  Precision drift tube chambers with a sense wire positioning accuracy of\nbetter than 20 microns are under construction for the ATLAS muon spectrometer.\n70% of the 88 large chambers for the outermost layer of the central part of the\nspectrometer have been assembled. Measurements during chamber construction of\nthe positions of the sense wires and of the sensors for the optical alignment\nmonitoring system demonstrate that the requirements for the mechanical\nprecision of the chambers are fulfilled.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a 3D kinetic model (Particle-in-Cell PIC ) for the\ndescription of the large scale Earth's bow shock. The proposed version is\nstable and does not require huge or extensive computer resources. Because PIC\nsimulations work with scaled plasma and field parameters, we also propose to\nvalidate our code by comparing its results with the available MHD simulations\nunder same scaled Solar wind ( SW ) and ( IMF ) conditions. We report new\nresults from the two models. In both codes the Earth's bow shock position is\nfound to be ~14.8 RE along the Sun-Earth line, and ~ 29 RE on the dusk side.\nThose findings are consistent with past in situ observations. Both simulations\nreproduce the theoretical jump conditions at the shock. However, the PIC code\ndensity and temperature distributions are inflated and slightly shifted sunward\nwhen compared to the MHD results. Kinetic electron motions and reflected ions\nupstream may cause this sunward shift. Species distributions in the foreshock\nregion are depicted within the transition of the shock (measured ~2\nc/{\\omega}pi for {\\Theta}Bn =90o and MMS =4.7 ) and in the downstream. The size\nof the foot jump in the magnetic field at the shock is measured to be (1.7\nc/{\\omega}pi ). In the foreshocked region, the thermal velocity is found equal\nto 213 km.sec-1 at 15 RE and is equal to 63 km.sec-1at 12 RE (Magnetosheath\nregion). Despite the large cell size of the current version of the PIC code, it\nis powerful to retain macrostructure of planets magnetospheres in very short\ntime, thus it can be used for a pedagogical test purposes. It is also likely\ncomplementary with MHD to deepen our understanding of the large scale\nmagnetosphere\n", "  The dynamical history of most merging galaxies is not well understood.\nCorrelations between galaxy interaction and star formation have been found in\nprevious studies, but require the context of the physical history of merging\nsystems for full insight into the processes that lead to enhanced star\nformation. We present the results of simulations that reconstruct the orbit\ntrajectories and disturbed morphologies of pairs of interacting galaxies. With\nthe use of a restricted three-body simulation code and the help of Citizen\nScientists, we sample 10^5 points in parameter space for each system. We\ndemonstrate a successful recreation of the morphologies of 62 pairs of\ninteracting galaxies through the review of more than 3 million simulations. We\nexamine the level of convergence and uniqueness of the dynamical properties of\neach system. These simulations represent the largest collection of models of\ninteracting galaxies to date, providing a valuable resource for the\ninvestigation of mergers. This paper presents the simulation parameters\ngenerated by the project. They are now publicly available in electronic format\nat http://data.galaxyzoo.org/mergers.html. Though our best-fit model parameters\nare not an exact match to previously published models, our method for\ndetermining uncertainty measurements will aid future comparisons between\nmodels. The dynamical clocks from our models agree with previous results of the\ntime since the onset of star formation from star burst models in interacting\nsystems and suggests that tidally induced star formation is triggered very soon\nafter closest approach.\n", "  We revisit secular stability against quasi-radial collapse for rigidly\nrotating supermassive stars (SMSs) in general relativity. We suppose that the\nSMSs are in a nuclear-burning phase and can be modeled by polytropic equations\nof state with the polytropic index $n_p$ slightly smaller than $3$. The\nstability is determined in terms of the turning-point method. We find a fitting\nformula of the stability condition for the plausible range of $n_p$ ($2.95 \\alt\nn_p \\alt 3$) for SMSs. This condition reconfirms that, while non-rotating SMSs\nwith mass $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$--$10^6M_\\odot$ may undergo a\ngeneral-relativistically induced quasi-radial collapse, rigidly rotating SMSs\nwith a ratio of rotational to gravitational potential energy ($\\beta$) of $\\sim\n10^{-2}$ are likely to be stable against collapse unless they are able to\naccrete $\\sim 5$ times more mass during the (relatively brief) hydrogen-burning\nphase of their evolution. We discuss implications of our results.\n", "  The fragmentation of excited hypernuclear system formed in heavy ion\ncollisions has been described by the canonical thermodynamical model extended\nto three component systems. The multiplicity distribution of the fragments has\nbeen analyzed in detail and it has been observed that the hyperons have the\ntendency to get attached to the heavier fragments. Another important\nobservation is the phase coexistence of the hyperons, a phenomenon which is\nlinked to liquid gas phase transition in strange matter.\n", "  Double barrier heterostructures are model systems for the study of electron\ntunneling and discrete energy levels in a quantum well (QW). Until now resonant\ntunneling phenomena in metallicQW have been observed for limited thicknesses\n(1-2 nm) under which electron phase coherence is conserved. In the present\nstudy we show evidence of QW resonance states in Fe QW up to12 nmthick and at\nroom temperature in fully epitaxial doubleMgAlOxbarrier magnetic tunnel\njunctions. The electron phase coherence displayed in this QWis of unprecedented\nquality because ofa homogenous interface phase shift due to the small lattice\nmismatch at the Fe/MgAlOx interface. The physical understanding of the critical\nrole of interface strain on QW phase coherence will greatly promote the\ndevelopment of the spin-dependent quantum resonant tunneling applications.\n", "  We present the results of a survey of N-body simulations aimed at exploring\nthe evolution of compact binaries in multiple-population globular clusters.We\nshow that as a consequence of the initial differences in the structural\nproperties of the first-generation (FG) and the second-generation (SG)\npopulations and the effects of dynamical processes on binary stars, the SG\nbinary fraction decreases more rapidly than that of the FG population. The\ndifference between the FG and SG binary fraction is qualitatively similar to\nbut quantitatively smaller than that found for wider binaries in our previous\ninvestigations.The evolution of the radial variation of the binary fraction is\ndriven by the interplay between binary segregation, ionization and ejection.\nIonization and ejection counteract in part the effects of mass segregation but\nfor compact binaries the effects of segregation dominate and the inner binary\nfraction increases during the cluster evolution. We explore the variation of\nthe difference between the FG and the SG binary fraction with the distance from\nthe cluster centre and its dependence on the binary binding energy and cluster\nstructural parameters. The difference between the binary fraction in the FG and\nthe SG populations found in our simulations is consistent with the results of\nobservational studies finding a smaller binary fraction in the SG population.\n", "  We present a first principle derivation of the coupled nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equations that govern the interaction between two families of\nmodes with different transverse profiles in a generic whispering-gallery-mode\nresonator. We find regions of modulational instability and the existence of\ntrains of bright solitons both in the normal and in the anomalous dispersion\nregime.\n", "  We develop a phenomenological theory of inhomogeneous broadening in\nzero-dimensional systems and apply it to study photoluminescence (PL) spectra\nof silicon nanocrystals measured at helium and room temperatures. The proposed\napproach allowed us to explain experimentally observed PL peak asymmetry,\nlinear dependence of the peak width on its maximum and anomalous alteration of\nspectral characteristics with temperature increase.\n", "  We present theoretical description of the Casimir interaction in graphene\nsystems which is based on the Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces and the\nformalism of the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The\nrepresentation for the polarization tensor of graphene allowing the analytic\ncontinuation to the whole plane of complex frequencies is given. This\nrepresentation is used to obtain simple asymptotic expressions for the\nreflection coefficients at all Matsubara frequencies and to investigate the\norigin of large thermal effect in the Casimir force for graphene. The developed\ntheory is shown to be in a good agreement with the experimental data on\nmeasuring the gradient of the Casimir force between a Au-coated sphere and a\ngraphene-coated substrate. The possibility to observe the thermal effect for\ngraphene due to a minor modification of the already existing experimental setup\nis demonstrated.\n", "  We consider recent progress in constraining the axion-nucleon coupling\nconstants and the Yukawa-type corrections to Newtonian gravity from experiments\non measuring the Casimir interaction. After a brief review of previously\nobtained constraints, we concentrate on the new Casimir-less experiment, which\nallows to strengthen the known results up to factors of 60 and 1000 for the\naxion-like particles and Yukawa-type corrections, respectively. We also discuss\npossibilities allowing to further strengthen the constraints on axion-nucleon\ncoupling constants, and propose a new experiment aiming to achieve this goal.\n", "  The adhesive and frictional response of an AFM tip connected to a substrate\nthrough supramolecular host-guest complexes is investigated by dynamic Monte\nCarlo simulations. The variation of the pull-off force with the unloading rate\nrecently observed in experiments is here unraveled by evidencing a simultaneous\n(progressive) break of the bonds at fast (slow) rates. The model reveals the\norigin of the observed plateaus in the retraction force as a function of\ntip-surface distance, showing that they ensue from the tip geometrical\nfeatures. In lateral sliding, the model exhibits a wide range of dynamic\nbehaviors ranging from smooth sliding to stick-slip at different velocities,\nwith the average friction force determined by the characteristic\nformation/rupture rates of the complexes. In particular, it is shown that for\nsome molecular complexes friction can become almost constant over a wide range\nof velocities. Also, we show the possibility to exploit ageing effect through\nslide-hold-slide experiments, in order to infer the characteristic formation\nrate. Finally, our model predicts a novel \"anti-ageing\" effect which is\ncharacterized by a decrease of static friction force with the hold time. Such\neffect is explained in terms of enhancement of adhesion during sliding,\nespecially observed at high driving velocities.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) host some of the most energetic phenomena in the\nUniverse. AGN are thought to be powered by accretion of matter onto a rotating\ndisk that surrounds a supermassive black hole. Jet streams can be boosted in\nenergy near the event horizon of the black hole and then flow outward along the\nrotation axis of the disk. The mechanism that forms such a jet and guides it\nover scales from a few light-days up to millions of light-years remains\nuncertain, but magnetic fields are thought to play a critical role. Using the\nAtacama large mm/submm array (ALMA), we have detected a polarization signal\n(Faraday rotation) related to the strong magnetic field at the jet base of a\ndistant AGN, PKS1830-211. The amount of Faraday rotation (rotation measure) is\nproportional to the magnetic field strength along the line of sight times the\ndensity of electrons. Although it is impossible to precisely infer the magnetic\nfields in the region of Faraday rotation, the high rotation measures derived\nsuggest magnetic fields of at least tens of Gauss (and possibly considerably\nhigher) on scales of the order of light days (0.01 pc) from the black hole.\n", "  The Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers for the muon spectrometer of the AT-\nLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) consist of 3-4 layers of\npressurized drift tubes on either side of a space frame carrying an optical\nmonitoring system to correct for deformations. The full-scale prototype of a\nlarge MDT chamber has been constructed with methods suitable for large-scale\nproduction. X-ray measurements at CERN showed a positioning accuracy of the\nsense wires in the chamber of better than the required 20 ?microns (rms). The\nperformance of the chamber was studied in a muon beam at CERN. Chamber\nproduction for ATLAS now has started.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the electronic, magnetic, and optical\nproperties of CuGa$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$, as a promising candidate for\nintermediate-band (IB) solar cells. We use hybrid exchange-correlation\nfunctional within the density functional theory framework, and show that Fe\ndoping induces unoccupied states 1.6-1.9 eV above the valence band. The IBs\nsignificantly enhance the optical absorption in lower energy part of the\nspectrum. We find that at moderate $n$-type co-doping concentration, the added\ncharge occupies part of the IB in the gap, but large concentrations lower the\nenergy of the occupied IB toward the valence band. Moreover, we show that Fe\nimpurities tend to cluster within the compound and they choose\nantiferromagnetic ordering. The findings can have a significant effect in\nunderstanding this material and help to synthesize more efficient IB solar\ncells.\n", "  Spectral ellipsometry studies of the optical functions, first observation of\nphotoluminescence and low frequency dielectric permittivity investigations were\nperformed in ferroelectric - multiferroic TbMnO3 single crystals. The main\nattention was paid to electronic band structure, nature of the main optical\ntransitions and unusual behavior of the dielectric permittivity in the region\nof the sharp narrow temperature maximum, associated with ferroelectric phase\ntransition. It was found that magnitude of the permittivity maximum decreases\nstrongly with frequency, whereas position of maximum is frequency independent.\nObserved features of polarization response can be described satisfactorily in\nthe frame of on the basis of the Landau-Khalatnikov theory for critical\nrelaxation polarization\n", "  A Lax pair for the additive difference Painlev\\'e equation of type\n$E_7^{(1)}$ is explicitly obtained as certain linear difference equations of\nscalar form. The compatibility of the Lax pair is proved by using certain\ncharacterization of the coefficients in the Lax equation. Some Lax pairs for\ntypes $E_6^{(1)}$, $D_4^{(1)}$ and $A_3^{(1)}$ are also given by the\ndegeneration.\n", "  The supercritical composition of a plasma model with cold positive ions in\nthe presence of a two-temperature electron population is investigated,\ninitially by a reductive perturbation approach, under the combined requirements\nthat there be neither quadratic nor cubic nonlinearities in the evolution\nequation. This leads to a unique choice for the set of compositional parameters\nand a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) with a quartic nonlinear term.\nThe conclusions about its one-soliton solution and integrability will also be\nvalid for more complicated plasma compositions. Only three polynomial\nconservation laws can be obtained. The mKdV equation with quartic nonlinearity\nis not completely integrable, thus precluding the existence of multi-soliton\nsolutions. Next, the full Sagdeev pseudopotential method has been applied and\nthis allows for a detailed comparison with the reductive perturbation results.\nThis comparison shows that the mKdV solitons have slightly larger amplitudes\nand widths than those obtained from the more complete Sagdeev solution and that\nonly slightly superacoustic mKdV solitons have acceptable amplitudes and\nwidths, in the light of the full solutions.\n", "  In this comment, I illustrate that the formula $\\Gamma=A\\sqrt{\\delta}$\nsuggested in arXiv:1603.07667 comes from a kinematical factor, and has no\nrelation to the existence or non-existence of the $X(5568)$.\n", "  The relative differences in coordinates of\nCylindrical-Gas-Electron-Multiplier-Detector-based Inner Tracker (CGEM-IT)\nclusters are studied to search for track segments in CGEM-IT. With the full\nsimulation of single muon track samples, clear patterns are found and\nparameterized for the correct cluster combinations. The cluster combinations\nsatisfying the patterns are selected as track segment candidates in CGEM-IT\nwith an efficiency higher than 99%. The parameters of the track segments are\nobtained by a helix fitting. Some chi-squared quantities, evaluating the\ndifferences in track parameters between the track segments in CGEM-IT and the\ntracks found in Outer-Drift-Chamber (ODC), are calculated and used to match\nthem. Proper chi-squared requirements are determined as a function of\ntransverse momentum and the matching efficiency is found reasonable.\n", "  This paper describes new techniques for producing lightguides for detection\nof scintillation light in liquid argon time projection chambers. These can be\nused in future neutrino experiments such as SBND and DUNE. These new results\nbuild on a dipped-coating technique that was previously reported and is\nreviewed here. The improvements to the approach indicate a factor of four\nimprovement in attenuation length of the lightguides compared to past studies.\nThe measured attenuation lengths, which are >2 m, are consistent with the bulk\nattenuation length of the material. Schematics for a mechanical dipping system\nare provided in this paper. This system is shown to result in coatings with <\n10% variations\n", "  In this work, we show how the stellar mass (M) of galaxies affects the\n3<z<4.6 Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) distribution. To this end, we design a\nsample of 629 galaxies in the M range 7.6 < logM/Msun < 10.6 from the\n3D-HST/CANDELS survey. We perform spectroscopic observations of this sample\nusing the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System, allowing us to measure Ly-alpha\nfluxes and use 3D-HST/CANDELS ancillary data. In order to study the Ly-alpha EW\ndistribution dependence on M, we split the whole sample in three stellar mass\nbins. We find that, in all bins, the distribution is best represented by an\nexponential profile of the form dN(M)/dEW= A(M)exp(-EW/W0(M))/W0(M). Through a\nBayesian analysis, we confirm that lower M galaxies have higher Ly-alpha EWs.\nWe also find that the fraction A of galaxies featuring emission and the\ne-folding scale W0 of the distribution anti- correlate with M, recovering\nexpressions of the forms A(M)= -0.26(.13) logM/Msun+3.01(1.2) and W0(M)=\n-15.6(3.5) logM/Msun +166(34). These results are crucial for proper\ninterpretation of Ly-alpha emission trends reported in the literature that may\nbe affected by strong M selection biases.\n", "  Public debates are a common platform for presenting and juxtaposing diverging\nviews on important issues. In this work we propose a methodology for tracking\nhow ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach\nin a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner\nis determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends\non aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to\nmake better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively\npursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the\ncourse of the conversation.\n", "  The consequences of some symmetries of the three-alpha system are discussed.\nIn particular, the recent description of the low-energy spectrum of the 12C\nnucleus in terms of the Algebraic Cluster Model (ACM) is compared to that of\nthe Semimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model (SACM). The previous one applies\ninteractions of a D3h geometric symmetry [1], while the latter one has a U(3)\nmultichannel dynamical symmetry, that connects the shell and cluster pictures.\nThe available data is in line with both descriptions.\n", "  Based on a low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy study, we present a\ndirect visualization of a cycloaddition reaction performed for some specific\nfluorinated maleimide molecules deposited on graphene. These studies showed\nthat the cycloaddition reactions can be carried out on the basal plane of\ngraphene, even when there are no pre-existing defects. In the course of\ncovalently grafting the molecules to graphene, the sp2 conjugation of carbon\natoms was broken and local sp3 bonds were created. The grafted molecules\nperturbed the graphene lattice, generating a standing-wave pattern with an\nanisotropy which was attributed to a (1,2) cycloaddition, as revealed by\nT-matrix approximation calculations. DFT calculations showed that while both\n(1,4) and (1,2) cycloaddition were possible on free standing graphene, only the\n(1,2) cycloaddition could be obtained for graphene on SiC(0001). Globally\naveraging spectroscopic techniques, XPS and ARPES, were used to determine the\nmodification in the elemental composition of the samples induced by the\nreaction, indicating an opening of an electronic gap in graphene.\n", "  The Sommerfeld boundary conditions, imposed on hyperbolic differential\nequations to obtain solutions in the form of outgoing waves, are formulated\nhere so as to make explicit the role of an appropriate null vector field. When\napplied to the scalar and Maxwell equations, they lead to the asymptotic form\nof the energy-momentum tensor representing radiation as a null, perfect dust.\n", "  The Sommerfeld boundary conditions, applied to an asymptotically weak\ngravitational field, are shown to imply that the 1/r part of the curvature\ntensor of a space-time, satisfying the Einstein equations, is of type null in\nthe Petrov classification and that there is then a flux of energy carried away\nby the outgoing gravitational wave.\n", "  New spectroscopic observations of the halo hyper-velocity star candidate SDSS\nJ121150.27+143716.2 ($V=17.92$ mag) revealed a cool companion to the hot\nsubdwarf primary. The components have a very similar radial velocity and their\nabsolute luminosities are consistent with the same distance, confirming the\nphysical nature of the binary, which is the first double-lined hyper-velocity\ncandidate. Our spectral decomposition of the Keck/ESI spectrum provided an\nsdB+K3V pair, analogous to many long-period subdwarf binaries observed in the\nGalactic disk. We found the subdwarf atmospheric parameters: $T_{\\rm\neff}=30\\,600\\pm500$ K, $\\log{g}=5.57\\pm0.06$ cm s$^{-2}$ and He abundance\n$\\log(n{\\rm He}/n{\\rm H})=-3.0\\pm0.2$. Oxygen is the most abundant metal in the\nhot subdwarf atmosphere, and Mg and Na lines are the most prominent spectral\nfeatures of the cool companion, consistent with a metallicity of $[{\\rm\nFe}/{\\rm H}]=-1.3$. The non-detection of radial velocity variations suggest the\norbital period to be a few hundred days, in agreement with similar binaries\nobserved in the disk. Using the SDSS-III flux calibrated spectrum we measured\nthe distance to the system $d=5.5\\pm0.5$ kpc, which is consistent with\nultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometric constraints derived from binary\nspectral energy distributions. Our kinematic study shows that the Galactic\nrest-frame velocity of the system is so high that an unbound orbit cannot be\nruled out. On the other hand, a bound orbit requires a massive dark matter\nhalo. We conclude that the binary either formed in the halo or it was accreted\nfrom the tidal debris of a dwarf galaxy by the Milky Way.\n", "  A cluster finding method was developed and applied in four Local Group\nGalaxies (SMC, M31, M33 and NGC 6822). The aim is to study the young stellar\npopulation of these galaxies by identifying stellar structures in small and\nlarge scales. Also our aim is to assess the potential of using the observations\nof ESA's space mission Gaia for the study of nearby galaxies resolved in stars.\nThe detection method used is a Hierarchical technique based on a modified\nfriends of friends algorithm. The identified clusters are classified in five\ndistinct categories according to their size. The data for our study were used\nfrom two ground based surveys, the Local Group Galaxy Survey and the Maggelanic\nClouds Spectroscopic Survey. Relatively young main sequence stars were selected\nfrom the stellar catalogs and were used by the detection algorithm. Multiple\nyoung stellar structures were identified in all galaxies with size varying from\nvery small scales of a few pc up to scales larger than 1 kpc. The same cluster\nfinding method was used in six spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space\nTelescope in a previous study. The average size in each category of the\nidentified structures in the Local Group galaxies presents values consistent\nwith the identified structures in the relatively distant spiral galaxies. Most\nof the structures consist of stars within the observational limits of Gaia's\ninstruments. It is expected that Gaia's observations will contribute\nsignificantly on the study of the young stellar population of nearby galaxies.\n", "  The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background from both the {\\it\nPlanck} and {\\it WMAP} data exhibits a slight dip for multipoles in the range\nof $l= 10-30$. We show that such a dip could be the result of the resonant\ncreation of massive particles that couple to the inflaton field. For our\nbest-fit models, the epoch of resonant particle creation reenters the horizon\nat a wave number of $k_* \\sim 0.0011 \\pm 0.0004 $ ($h$ Mpc$^{-1}$). The\namplitude and location of this feature corresponds to the creation of a number\nof degenerate fermion species of mass $\\sim (8-11) /\\lambda^{3/2} $ $m_{pl}$\nduring inflation where $\\lambda \\sim (1.0 \\pm 0.5) N^{-2/5}$ is the coupling\nconstant between the inflaton field and the created fermion species, while $N$\nis the number of degenerate species. Although the evidence is of marginal\nstatistical significance, this could constitute new observational hints of\nunexplored physics beyond the Planck scale\n", "  The dynamical responses of complex neuronal networks to external stimulus\ninjected on a \\emph{single} neuron are investigated. Stimulating the\nlargest-degree neuron in the network, it is found that as the intensity of the\nstimulus increases, the network will be transiting from the resting to firing\nstates and then restoring to the resting state, showing a bounded firing region\nin the parameter space. Furthermore, it is found that as the coupling strength\ndecreases, the firing region is gradually expanded and, at the weak couplings,\nseparated into disconnected subregions. By a simplified network model, we\nconduct a detail analysis on the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in\nthe two-dimensional parameter space spanned by stimulating intensity and\ncoupling strength, and, by introducing a new coefficient named effective\nstimulus, explore the mechanisms of the modified firing region. It is revealed\nthat the coupling strength and stimulating intensity are equally important in\nevoking the network, but with different mechanisms. Specifically, the effective\nstimuli are \\emph{shifted up} globally with the increase of the stimulating\nintensity, while are \\emph{drawn closer} with the increase of the coupling\nstrength. The dynamical responses of small-world and random complex networks to\nexternal stimulus injected on the largest-degree neuron are also investigated,\nwhich confirm the generality of the observed phenomena.\n", "  An experimental method for suppression of DC term in the reconstructed images\nfrom Fresnel digital holograms is presented. In this method, two holograms for\nthe same object are captured sequentially and subtracted. Since these two\nholograms are captured at different moments, they are slightly different from\neach other for fluctuations of noises. The DC term is suppressed in the image\nreconstructed from the subtraction hologram, while the two virtual and real\nimages are successfully reconstructed. This method can be potentially used for\nthe improvement of image quality reconstructed from Fresnel digital holograms.\n", "  The second-order statistics (SOS) can be applied in estimation of the pure\nspectra of chemical components from the spectrum of their mixture, when SOS\nseems to be good at estimation of spectral patterns, but their peak directions\nare opposite in some cases. In this paper, one method for judgment of the peak\ndirection of the pure spectra was proposed, where the base line of the pure\nspectra was drawn by using their histograms and the peak directions were chosen\nso as to make all of the pure spectra located upwards over the base line.\nResults of the SOS analysis on the visible hyperspectral images of the mixture\ncomposed of two or three chemical components showed that the present method\noffered the reasonable shape and direction of the pure spectra of its\ncomponents.\n", "  We argue that if, in order to reverse an object's dynamics, we need to be\nable to keep track of it with enough precision, then there is an upper bound on\nthe size of the object whose dynamics we can reverse - even using all the\navailable resources of the universe. Using a bound from the holographic\nprinciple and treating the universe as the ultimate quantum computer, we show\nthat if we want to reverse the dynamics of an object which has evolved since\nthe beginning of time, its radius cannot exceed ten microns. If this\ncomputation is performed irreversibly, the object must be much smaller. This\nplaces a lower bound on the size of the smallest possible quantum measurement\ndevice.\n", "  Localized electronic states formed inside the band gap of a semiconductor due\nto crystal defects can be detrimental to the material's optoelectronic\nproperties. Semiconductors with lower tendency to form defect induced deep gap\nstates are termed defect tolerant. Here we provide a systematic first\nprinciples investigation of defect tolerance in 29 monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) of interest for nanoscale optoelectronics. We find that\nthe TMDs based on group VI and X metals form deep gap states upon creation of a\nchalcogen (S, Se, Te) vacancy while the TMDs based on group IV metals form only\nshallow defect levels and are thus predicted to be defect tolerant.\nInterestingly, all the defect sensitive TMDs have valence and conduction bands\nwith very similar orbital composition. This indicates a bonding/anti-bonding\nnature of the gap which in turn suggests that dangling bonds will fall inside\nthe gap. These ideas are made quantitative by introducing a descriptor that\nmeasures the degree of similarity of the conduction and valence band manifolds.\nFinally, the study is generalized to non-polar nanoribbons of the TMDs where we\nfind that only the defect sensitive materials form edge states within the band\ngap.\n", "  The concept of the cosmic web, viewing the Universe as a set of discrete\ngalaxies held together by gravity, is deeply engrained in cosmology. Yet,\nlittle is known about the most effective construction and the characteristics\nof the underlying network. Here we explore seven network construction\nalgorithms that use various galaxy properties, from their location, to their\nsize and relative velocity, to assign a network to galaxy distributions\nprovided by both simulations and observations. We find that a model relying\nonly on spatial proximity offers the best correlations between the physical\ncharacteristics of the connected galaxies. We show that the properties of the\nnetworks generated from simulations and observations are identical, unveiling a\ndeep universality of the cosmic web.\n", "  A scheme for computing charge-transfer matrix elements with the linear\ncombination of fragment molecular orbitals and the 'nonempirically tuned\nrange-separated' density functional is presented. It takes account of the\nself-consistent orbital relaxation induced by environmental Coulomb field and\nthe exchange interaction in fragment pairs at low computational scaling along\nthe system size. The accuracy was confirmed numerically on benchmark systems of\nimidazole and furane homo-dimer cations. Applications to hole transfers in DNA\nnucleobase pairs and in a $\\pi$-stack adenine octomer highlight the effects of\norbital relaxation.\n", "  Multi-phase material are frequently applied in a wide variety of products, as\nthey posses a unique set of properties by combining two or more distinct phases\nat the level of the microstructure. Although the macroscopic stiffness and\nhardening are reasonably well understood, questions remain about the dominant\nfailure mechanism(s). We identify the role of the microstructural topology (the\ndistribution of phases) on damage \"hot-spot\" in the microstructure, by\nperforming a numerical study on a large set of randomly generated topologies.\nThe result identifies a distinct probability distribution of phases around a\ntypical damage \"hot-spot\". This work is focused on assessing the sensitivity of\nthe result to the assumptions made on the microstructural geometry.\n", "  We show that the twisted K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow on a complex manifold X\nconverges to a flow of moving free boundaries, in a certain scaling limit. This\nleads to a new phenomenon of singularity formation and topology change which\ncan be seen as a complex generalization of the extensively studied formation of\nshocks in Hamilton-Jacobi equations and hyperbolic conservation laws (notably,\nin the adhesion model in cosmology). In particular we show how to recover the\nHele-Shaw flow (Laplacian growth) of growing 2D domains from the Ricci flow. As\nwe briefly indicate the scaling limit in question arises as the\nzero-temperature limit of a certain many particle system on X.\n", "  The bright and highly-variable Seyfert I Active Galactic Nucleus, IC4329A,\nwas observed with Suzaku 5 times in 2007 August with intervals of ~ 5 days, and\na net exposure of 24-31 ks each. Another longer observation was carried out in\n2012 August with a net exposure of 118 ks. In the 6 observations, the source\nwas detected in 2-45 keV with average 2-10 keV fluxes of\n$(0.67-1.2)\\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The intensity changed by a\nfactor of 2 among the 5 observations in 2007, and 1.5 within the 2012\nobservation. Difference spectra among these observations revealed that the\nvariability of IC4329A was carried mainly by a power-law component with a\nphoton index $\\Gamma\\sim2.0$. However, in addition to this primary component\nand the associated reflection, the broad-band Suzaku data required another,\nharder, and less variable component with $\\Gamma\\sim1.4$. The presence of this\nnew continuum was also confirmed by analyzing the same 6 data sets through the\nspectral decomposition technique developed by Noda et al. 2013a. This\n$\\Gamma\\sim1.4$ continuum is considered to be a new primary component that has\nnot been recognized in the spectra of IC4329A so far, although it was recently\nidentified in those of several other Seyfert I galaxies (Noda et al. 2013a,\n2014).\n", "  An effective shear viscosity in central Au+Au collisions is estimated in the\nrange of incident energies 3.3 GeV $\\le \\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\le$ 39 GeV. The\nsimulations are performed within a three-fluid model employing three different\nequations of state with and without the deconfinement transition. In order to\nestimate this effective viscosity, we consider the entropy produced in the 3FD\nsimulations as if it is generated within the conventional one-fluid viscous\nhydrodynamics. It is found that the effective viscosity within different\nconsidered scenarios is very similar at the expansion stage of the collision:\nas a function of temperature ($T$) the viscosity-to-entropy ratio behaves as\n$\\eta/s \\sim 1/T^4$; as a function of net-baryon density ($n_B$), $\\eta/s \\sim\n1/s$, i.e. it is mainly determined by the density dependence of the entropy\ndensity. The above dependencies take place along the dynamical trajectories of\nAu+Au collisions. At the final stages of the expansion the $\\eta/s$ values are\nranged from $\\sim$0.05 at highest considered energies to $\\sim$0.5 at the\nlowest ones.\n", "  Post-annealing effects on the crystal structure and superconductivity of the\nlithium- and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA)-intercalated superconductor\nLix(C6H16N2)yFe2-zSe2 have been investigated. Through the post-annealing, a\ntwo-step reduction of the interlayer spacing between neighboring Fe layers, d,\nhas been observed. It has been found that a new phase of Lix(C6H16N2)yFe2-zSe2\nwith d= 10.30(2) {\\AA} and Tc = 41 K different from the as-intercalated phase\nis stabilized owing to the possible stable inclination of HMDA intercalated\nbetween FeSe layers. This result supports the domic relation between Tc and d\nin the FeSe-based intercalation superconductors. The reason why Tc increases\nwith a decrease in d through the post-annealing is discussed.\n", "  The interaction-driven insulator-to-metal transition has been reported in the\nionic Hubbard model (IHM) for moderate interaction $U$, while its metallic\nphase only occupies a narrow region in the phase diagram. To explore the\nenlargement of the metallic regime, we extend the ionic Hubbard model to two\ncoupled layers and study the interplay of interlayer hybridization $V$ and two\ntypes of intralayer staggered potentials $\\Delta$: one with the same (in-phase)\nand the other with a $\\pi$-phase shift (anti-phase) potential between layers.\nOur determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations at lowest accessible\ntemperatures demonstrate that the interaction-driven metallic phase between\nMott and band insulators expands in the $\\Delta-V$ phase diagram of bilayer IHM\nonly for in-phase ionic potentials; while anti-phase potential always induces\nan insulator with charge density order. This implies possible further extension\nof the ionic Hubbard model from the bilayer case here to realistic\nthree-dimensional model.\n", "  We investigate spin polarized electron transport in ultra-thin\nSi-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire system using semi-classical\nMonte Carlo simulation method. Depolarization of electron's spin occurs in\nnanowire mainly due to D'yakonov-Perel dephasing (DP-mechanism) and\nElliott-Yafet dephasing (EY-mechanism). We studied the dependence of spin\ndephasing on ultra-thin silicon core diameter in Si-Core/Ge-Shell nanowire and\ngermanium core diameter in Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire. Variation in spin\ndephasing length with varying core diameter ranging from 1 nm to 9 nm indicate\nthat spin dephasing length increases with increase in Si-core diameter in\nSi-Core/Ge-Shell nanowire and spin dephasing length decreases with increase in\nGe-core diameter in Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire. We then studied the variation in\nspin dephasing length with varying externally applied transverse electric field\nranging from 20 kV/cm to100 kV/cm. In the electric field dependence study we\nfound that spin dephasing length is weakly dependent upon applied electric\nfield. In the end, we studied the variation in spin dephasing length with\nvarying temperature in the range of 4 K to 377 K. In this simulational study we\nfound that for both Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire system spin\ndephasing length shows a strong dependence on temperature and spin dephasing\nlength increases with decrease in temperature from room temperature range.\n", "  In this paper we study the time evolution of a temperature patch in $R^2$\naccording to the modified Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation (SQG) patch\nequation. In particular we give a temporal estimate on the growth of the\nsupport, providing a rigorous proof of the confinement of a hot patch of\ntemperature in absence of external forcing, under the quasi-geostrophic\napproximation.\n", "  We review some results obtained by the Coimbra-Ljubljana collaboration that\nreveal the important role of the pion cloud in the low- and intermediate-energy\nnucleon and delta resonances.\n", "  Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) lead to a major increase in the\nperformance of the computation of astrophysical simulations. Owing to the\ndifferent nature of GPU architecture compared to traditional central processing\nunits (CPUs) such as x86 architecture, existing numerical codes cannot be\neasily migrated to run on GPU. Here, we present a new implementation of the\nnumerical method smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) using CUDA and the first\nastrophysical application of the new code: the collision between Ceres-sized\nobjects. The new code allows for a tremendous increase in speed of\nastrophysical simulations with SPH and self-gravity at low costs for new\nhardware. We have implemented the SPH equations to model gas, liquids and\nelastic, and plastic solid bodies and added a fragmentation model for brittle\nmaterials. Self-gravity may be optionally included in the simulations and is\ntreated by the use of a Barnes-Hut tree. We find an impressive performance gain\nusing NVIDIA consumer devices compared to our existing OpenMP code. The new\ncode is freely available to the community upon request.\n", "  This document summarizes thoughts on opportunities in the soft-QCD sector\nfrom high-energy nuclear collisions at high luminosities.\n", "  In this paper we describe the current status of the CALDER project, which is\ndeveloping ultra-sensitive light detectors based on superconductors for\ncryogenic applications. When we apply an AC current to a superconductor, the\nCooper pairs oscillate and acquire kinetic inductance, that can be measured by\ninserting the superconductor in a LC circuit with high merit factor.\nInteractions in the superconductor can break the Cooper pairs, causing sizable\nvariations in the kinetic inductance and, thus, in the response of the LC\ncircuit. The continuous monitoring of the amplitude and frequency modulation\nallows to reconstruct the incident energy with excellent sensitivity. This\nconcept is at the basis of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), that are\ncharacterized by natural aptitude to multiplexed read-out (several sensors can\nbe tuned to different resonant frequencies and coupled to the same line),\nresolution of few eV, stable behavior over a wide temperature range, and ease\nin fabrication. We present the results obtained by the CALDER collaboration\nwith 2x2 cm2 substrates sampled by 1 or 4 Aluminum KIDs. We show that the\nperformances of the first prototypes are already competitive with those of\nother commonly used light detectors, and we discuss the strategies for a\nfurther improvement.\n", "  Temperature-responsive properties of surface-attached\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network films with well-controlled\nchemistry are investigated. The synthesis consists of cross-linking and\ngrafting preformed ene-reactive polymer chains through thiol--ene click\nchemistry. The formation of surface-attached and cross-linked polymer films has\nthe advantage of being wellcontrolled without any caution of no-oxygen\natmosphere or addition of initiators. PNIPAM hydrogel films with same\ncross-link density are synthesized on a wide range of thickness, from\nnanometers to micrometers. The swelling-collapse transition with temperature is\nstudied by using ellipsometry, neutron reflectivity, and atomic force\nmicroscopy as complementary surface-probing techniques. Sharp and high\namplitude temperature-induced phase transition is observed for all\nsubmicrometric PNIPAM hydrogel films. For temperature above LCST,\nsurface-attached PNIPAM hydrogels collapse similarly but without complete\nexpulsion of water. For temperature below LCST, the swelling of PNIPAM\nhydrogels depends on the film thickness. It is shown that the swelling is\nstrongly affected by the surface attachment for ultrathin films below $\\sim$150\nnm. For thicker films above 150 nm (to micrometers), surface-attached polymer\nnetworks with the same cross-link density swell equally. The density profile of\nthe hydrogel films in the direction normal to the substrate is confronted with\nin-plane topography of the free surface. It results that the free interface\nwidth is much larger than the roughness of the hydrogel film, suggesting\npendant chains at the free surface.\n", "  We have measured the gamma-ray emission spectrum of the Moon using the data\ncollected by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite during its\nfirst 7 years of operation, in the energy range from 30 MeV up to a few GeV. We\nhave also studied the time evolution of the flux, finding a correlation with\nthe solar activity. We have developed a full Monte Carlo simulation describing\nthe interactions of cosmic rays with the lunar surface. The results of the\npresent analysis can be explained in the framework of this model, where the\nproduction of gamma rays is due to the interactions of cosmic-ray proton and\nhelium nuclei with the surface of the Moon. Finally, we have used our\nsimulation to derive the cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra near Earth from\nthe Moon gamma-ray data.\n", "  This paper studies the whole process of gravitational collapse and accretion\nof a massless scalar field in asymptotically flat spacetime. Two kinds of\ninitial configurations are considered. One is the initial data without black\nhole, the other contains a black hole. Under suitable initial conditions, we\nfind that multi-horizon will appear, which means that the initial black hole\nformed by gravitational collapse or existing at the beginning will instantly\nexpand and suddenly grow, rather than grows gradually in the accretion process.\nA new type of critical behavior is found around the instant expansion. The\nnumerical computation shows that the critical exponents are universal.\n", "  Various adhesion mechanisms that have been understood in the field of\nsynthetic adhesives are described and these are linked with situations relevant\nto fouling issues. The review mainly deals with mechanical aspects of adhesion\nphenomena, with an emphasis on the role of the elasticity of the bodies, called\nsubstrata, attached by adhesive. The consequences of thin film geometry of the\nadhesive material are described, such as various heterogeneous deformations\nupon traction. The importance of the bonding process is discussed, as well as\nsome examples of non-wetting surfaces. As seen from a distance, the adhesive\nlayer is merely one interface; Some basic ideas of fracture mechanics are\nprovided and in particular, the behavior of layered systems is discussed.\nRolling sticky objects and peeled (flexible) adhesive tapes display similar\nmechanisms and it is shown how they differ from the normal separation of rigid\nbodies. Some issues directly related to fouling issues are also discussed, such\nas forces and torques acting on shells, the advantages of gregarious settlement\nbehavior and concepts for fouling release and antifouling.\n", "  We use a simple dynamical model which consists of a harmonic oscillator and a\nspherical component, in order to investigate the regular or chaotic character\nof orbits in a barred galaxy with a central spherically symmetric nucleus. Our\naim is to explore how the basic parameters of the galactic system influence the\nnature of orbits, by computing in each case the percentage of chaotic orbits,\nas well as the percentages of different types of regular orbits. We also give\nemphasis to the types of regular orbits that support either the formation of\nnuclear rings or the barred structure of the galaxy. We provide evidence that\nthe traditional x1 orbital family does not always dominate in barred galaxy\nmodels since we found several other types of resonant orbits which can also\nsupport the barred structure. We also found that sparse enough nuclei, fast\nrotating bars and high energy models can support the galactic bars. On the\nother hand, weak bars, dense central nuclei, slowly rotating bars and low\nenergy models favor the formation of nuclear rings. We also compare our results\nwith previous related work.\n", "  In quantum physics Wigner's rotation is commonly regarded as confirmed by the\nThomas precession in a hydrogen like atom. In this paper we show that a direct\nexperimental verification of Wigner's rotation is in principle accessible in\nthe regime of non-relativistic velocities at $2 \\cdot 10^3\\,$m/s and propose an\nexperiment using thermal neutrons. The experiment can be carried out in a\nlaboratory and it provides a test of relativity in the quantum domain.\n", "  This work discusses a closed-loop control strategy for complex systems\nutilizing scarce and streaming data. A discrete embedding space is first built\nusing hash functions applied to the sensor measurements from which a Markov\nprocess model is derived, approximating the complex system's dynamics. A\ncontrol strategy is then learned using reinforcement learning once rewards\nrelevant with respect to the control objective are identified. This method is\ndesigned for experimental configurations, requiring no computations nor prior\nknowledge of the system, and enjoys intrinsic robustness. It is illustrated on\ntwo systems: the control of the transitions of a Lorenz 63 dynamical system,\nand the control of the drag of a cylinder flow. The method is shown to perform\nwell.\n", "  The design of optical systems capable of processing and manipulating\nultra-short pulses and ultra-focused beams is highly challenging with far\nreaching fundamental technological applications. One key obstacle routinely\nencountered while implementing sub-wavelength optical schemes is how to\novercome the limitations set by standard Fourier optics. A strategy to overcome\nthese difficulties is to utilize the concept of generalized uncertainty\nprinciple (G-UP) that has been originally developed to study quantum gravity.\nIn this paper we propose to use the concept of G-UP within the framework of\noptics to show that the generalized Schr\u007fodinger equation describing short\npulses and ultra-focused beams predicts the existence of a minimal spatial or\ntemporal scale which in turn implies the existence of maximally localized\nstates. Using a Gaussian wavepacket with complex phase, we derive the\ncorresponding generalized uncertainty relation and its maximally localized\nstates. We numerically show that the presence of nonlinearity helps the system\nto reach its maximal localization. Our results may trigger further theoretical\nand experimental tests for practical applications and analogues of fundamental\nphysical theories.\n", "  In the sliding contact of elastomer on a rigid substrate, the coefficient of\nfriction may depend on a large number of system and loading parameters,\nincluding normal force, sliding velocity, shape of contacting bodies, surface\nroughness and so on. It was argued earlier that the contact configuration is\ndetermined more immediately through the indentation depth than the normal\nforce, and thus the indentation depth can be considered as one of \"robust\ngoverning parameters\" of friction. Both models of friction of simple shapes and\nfractal surfaces demonstrate that the coefficient of friction of elastomers\nshould be generally a function of dimensionless combinations of sliding\nvelocity, surface gradient, relaxation time and size of micro-contacts. The\nrelaxation time does depend only on temperature and the surface slope and the\nsize of micro contacts mostly on the indentation depth. Based on this general\nstructure of the law of friction, we propose a generalized master curve\nprocedure for elastomer friction where the significant governing parameter -\nindentation depth (or normal force) was taken into account. Unlike the\ngeneration of the classical master curve by horizontal shifting of dependence\n\"friction - logarithm of velocity\" for different temperatures, in the case of\nvarious indentation depth the shifting in both horizontal and vertical\ndirection is required. We experimentally investigated coefficient of friction\nof elastomer on sliding velocity for different indentation depths and\ntemperatures, and generated a master curve according to this hypothesis.\n", "  In this paper we use the two-dimensional (2D) version of a new analytical\ngravitational model in order to explore the orbital as well as the escape\ndynamics of the stars in a barred galaxy composed of a spherically symmetric\ncentral nucleus, a bar, a flat disk and a dark matter halo component. A\nthorough numerical investigation is conducted for distinguishing between\nbounded and escaping motion. Furthermore bounded orbits are further classified\ninto non-escaping regular and trapped chaotic using the Smaller ALingment Index\n(SALI) method. Our aim is to determine the basins of escape through the two\nsymmetrical escape channels around the Lagrange points $L_2$ and $L_3$ and also\nto relate them with the corresponding distribution of the escape rates of the\norbits. We integrate initial conditions of orbits in several types of planes so\nas to obtain a more complete view of the overall orbital properties of the\ndynamical system. We also present evidence that the unstable manifolds which\nguide the orbits in and out the interior region are directly related with the\nformation of spiral and ring stellar structures observed in barred galaxies. In\nparticular, we examine how the bar's semi-major axis determines the resulting\nmorphologies. Our numerical simulations indicate that weak barred structures\nfavour the formation of $R_1$ rings or $R_1'$ pseudo-rings, while strong bars\non the other hand, give rise to $R_1R_2$ and open spiral morphologies. Our\nresults are compared with earlier related work. The escape dynamics and the\nproperties of the manifolds of the full three-dimensional (3D) galactic system\nwill be given in an accompanying paper.\n", "  Heavy sweep distortion induced by alignments and inter-reflections of layers\nof a sample is a major burden in recovering 2D and 3D information in time\nresolved spectral imaging. This problem cannot be addressed by conventional\ndenoising and signal processing techniques as it heavily depends on the physics\nof the acquisition. Here we propose and implement an algorithmic framework\nbased on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization that exploits\nthe forward model for THz acquisition. The method allows recovering the\noriginal signal in spite of the presence of temporal-spatial distortions. We\naddress a blind-demodulation problem, where based on several observations of\nthe sample texture modulated by an undesired sweep pattern, the two classes of\nsignals are separated. The performance of the method is examined in both\nsynthetic and experimental data, and the successful reconstructions are\ndemonstrated. The proposed general scheme can be implemented to advance\ninspection and imaging applications in THz and other time-resolved sensing\nmodalities.\n", "  I point out a radical indeterminism in potential-based formulations of\nNewtonian gravity once we drop the condition that the potential vanishes at\ninfinity (as is necessary, and indeed celebrated, in cosmological\napplications). This indeterminism, which is well known in theoretical cosmology\nbut has received little attention in foundational discussions, can be removed\nonly by specifying boundary conditions at all instants of time, which\nundermines the theory's claim to be fully cosmological, i.e., to apply to the\nUniverse as a whole. A recent alternative formulation of Newtonian gravity due\nto Saunders (Philosophy of Science 80 (2013) pp.22-48) provides a conceptually\nsatisfactory cosmology but fails to reproduce the Newtonian limit of general\nrelativity in homogenous but anisotropic universes. I conclude that Newtonian\ngravity lacks a fully satisfactory cosmological formulation.\n", "  We provide an atomistic tight-binding description of a few carriers confined\nin ambipolar (n-p) double quantum dots defined in a semiconducting carbon\nnanotube. We focus our attention on the charge state of the system in which\nPauli blockade of the current flow is observed [F. Pei et al., Nat.\nNanotechnol. 7, 630 (2012); E. A. Laird et al., ibid 8, 565 (2013)] with a\nsingle excess electron in the n-dot and a single hole in the p-dot. We use the\nconfiguration interaction approach to determine the spin-valley structure of\nthe states near the neutrality point and discuss its consequences for the\ninterdot exchange interaction, the degeneracy of the energy spectrum and the\nsymmetry of the confined states. We calculate the transition energies lifting\nthe Pauli blockade and analyze their dependence on the magnetic field vector.\nFurthermore, we introduce bending of the nanotube and demonstrate its influence\non the transition energy spectra. The best qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data is observed for nanotubes deflected in the gated areas in\nwhich the carrier confinement is induced.\n", "  It has been shown that truncated cone-shaped cavities with microwaves\nresonating within them move slightly towards their narrow ends (the emdrive).\nStandard physics has no explanation for this and an error has not yet been\nfound. It is shown here that this effect can be predicted by assuming that the\ninertial mass of the photons in the cavity is caused by Unruh radiation, whose\nwavelengths must fit exactly within the cavity, using a theory already applied\nsuccessfully to astrophysical anomalies such as galaxy rotation where the Unruh\nwaves have to fit within the Hubble scale. In the emdrive this means that more\nUnruh waves are allowed at the wide end, leading to a greater inertial mass for\nthe photons there, and to conserve momentum the cavity must move towards its\nnarrow end, as observed. The model predicts thrusts of: 3.8, 149, 7.3, 0.23,\n0.57, 0.11, 0.64 and 0.02 mN compared with the observed thrusts of: 16, 147, 9,\n0.09, 0.05, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.02 mN and predicts that if the axial length is\nequal to the diameter of the small end of the cavity, the thrust should be\nreversed.\n", "  The method described here performs blind deconvolution of the beamforming\noutput in the frequency domain. To provide accurate blind deconvolution,\nsparsity priors are introduced with a smooth \\ell_1/\\ell_2 regularization term.\nAs the mean of the noise in the power spectrum domain is dependent on its\nvariance in the time domain, the proposed method includes a variance estimation\nstep, which allows more robust blind deconvolution. Validation of the method on\nboth simulated and real data, and of its performance, are compared with two\nwell-known methods from the literature: the deconvolution approach for the\nmapping of acoustic sources, and sound density modeling.\n", "  We embark on investigating the magneto-optical absorption in {\\em spherical}\nquantum dots {\\em completely} confined by a harmonic potential and exposed to\nan applied magnetic field in the symmetric gauge. This is done within the\nframework of Bohm-Pines' RPA that enables us to derive and discuss the full\nDyson equation that takes proper account of the Coulomb interactions.\nIntensifying the confinement or magnetic field and reducing the dot-size yields\na blue-shift in the absorption peaks. However, the size effects are seen to be\npredominant in this role. The magnetic field tends to maximize the localization\nof the particle, but leaves the peak position of the radial distribution\nintact. The intra-Landau level transitions are forbidden.\n", "  Here we embark on a thorough investigation of the magneto-optical absorption\nin semiconducting {\\em spherical} quantum dots characterized by a confining\nharmonic potential and an applied magnetic field in the symmetric gauge. This\nis done within the framework of Bohm-Pines' random-phase approximation that\nenables us to derive and discuss the full Dyson equation that takes proper\naccount of the Coulomb interactions. As an application of our theoretical\nstrategy, we compute various single-particle and many-particle phenomena such\nas the Fock-Darwin spectrum; Fermi energy; magneto-optical transitions;\nprobability distribution; and the magneto-optical absorption in the quantum\ndots. It is observed that the role of an applied magnetic field on the\nabsorption spectrum is comparable to that of a confining potential. Increasing\n(decreasing) the strength of the magnetic field or the confining potential is\nfound to be analogous to shrinking (expanding) the size of the quantum dots:\nresulting into a blue (red) shift in the absorption spectrum. The Fermi energy\ndiminishes with both increasing magnetic-field and dot-size; and exhibits\nsaw-tooth-like oscillations at large values of field or dot-size. Unlike\nlaterally confined quantum dots, both (upper and lower) magneto-optical\ntransitions survive even in the extreme instances. However, the intra-Landau\nlevel transitions are seen to be forbidden. The spherical quantum dots have an\nedge over the strictly two-dimensional quantum dots in that the additional\n(magnetic) quantum number makes the physics richer (but complex). A deeper\ngrasp of the Coulomb blockade, quantum coherence, and entanglement can lead to\na better insight into promising applications involving lasers, detectors,\nstorage devices, and quantum computing.\n", "  For any $k>1$, we find the asymptotics of the counting function of $k$-th\npower-free elements in an additive arithmetic semigroup with exponential growth\nof the abstract prime counting function. This paper continues the authors'\nearlier research dealing with the case of infinite $k$.\n", "  Detecting and analyzing dense groups or communities from social and\ninformation networks has attracted immense attention over last one decade due\nto its enormous applicability in different domains. Community detection is an\nill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance.\nThe problem has turned out to be even complicated due to the fact that\ncommunities emerge in the network in various forms - disjoint, overlapping,\nhierarchical etc. Various heuristics have been proposed depending upon the\napplication in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of\nnew metrics, which in most cases are used as optimization functions for\ndetecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of\ndetected communities during evaluation. There arises a need for an organized\nand detailed survey of the metrics proposed with respect to community detection\nand evaluation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and structured\noverview of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the\nevaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in\nmeasuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.\n", "  We present Co substitution effects in K$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y-z}$Co$_{z}$Se$_{2}$\n(0.06 $\\leq$ $z$ $\\leq$ 1.73) single crystal alloys. By 3.5\\% of Co doping\nsuperconductivity is suppressed whereas phase separation of semiconducting\nK$_{2}$Fe$_{4}$Se$_{5}$ and superconducting/metallic K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ is\nstill present. We show that the arrangement and distribution of superconducting\nphase (stripe phase) is connected with the arrangement of K, Fe and Co atoms.\nSemiconducting spin glass is found in proximity to superconducting state,\npersisting for large Co concentrations. At high Co concentrations ferromagnetic\nmetallic state emerges above the spin glass. This is coincident with changes of\nthe unit cell, arrangement and connectivity of stripe conducting phase.\n", "  Superconductivity develops in metals upon the formation of a coherent\nmacroscopic quantum state of electron pairs. Iron pnictides and chalcogenides\nare materials that have high superconducting transition temperatures. In this\nReview, we describe the advances in the field that have led to higher\nsuperconducting transition temperatures in iron-based superconductors and the\nwide range of materials that form them. We summarize both the essential aspects\nof the normal state and the mechanism for superconductivity. We emphasize the\ndegree of electron-electron correlations and their manifestation in properties\nof the normal state. We examine the nature of magnetism, analyse its role in\ndriving the electronic nematicity, and discuss quantum criticality at the\nborder of magnetism in the phase diagram. Finally, we review the amplitude and\nstructure of the superconducting pairing, and survey the potential settings for\noptimizing superconductivity.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)\nsoftware framework that incorporates tiling, a well-known loop transformation.\nBecause the multiscale, multiphysics codes built in BoxLib are designed to\nsolve complex systems at high resolution, performance on current and next\ngeneration architectures is essential. With the expectation of many more cores\nper node on next generation architectures, the ability to effectively utilize\nthreads within a node is essential, and the current model for parallelization\nwill not be sufficient. We describe a new version of BoxLib in which the tiling\nconstructs are embedded so that BoxLib-based applications can easily realize\nexpected performance gains without extra effort on the part of the application\ndeveloper. We also discuss a path forward to enable future versions of BoxLib\nto take advantage of NUMA-aware optimizations using the TiDA portable library.\n", "  Circadian (~24hr) clocks are self-sustained endogenous oscillators with which\norganisms keep track of daily and seasonal time. Circadian clocks frequently\nrely on interlocked transcriptional- translational feedback loops to generate\nrhythms that are robust against intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. To\ninvestigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the intracellular feedback loops in\ncircadian clocks, a number of mathematical models have been developed. The\nmajority of the models use Hill functions to describe transcriptional\nrepression in a way that is similar to the Goodwin model. Recently, a new class\nof models with protein sequestration-based repression has been introduced.\nHere, we discuss how this new class of models differs dramatically from those\nbased on Hill-type repression in several fundamental aspects: conditions for\nrhythm generation, robust network designs and the periods of coupled\noscillators. Consistently, these fundamental properties of circadian clocks\nalso differ among Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals depending on their key\ntranscriptional repression mechanisms (Hill-type repression or protein\nsequestration). Based on both theoretical and experimental studies, this review\nhighlights the importance of careful modeling of transcriptional repression\nmechanisms in molecular circadian clocks.\n", "  We present a novel technique for the realization of suspended Josephson\njunctions based on InAs semiconductor nanowires. The devices are assembled\nusing a technique of drop-casting guided by dielectrophoresis that allows to\nfinely align the nanostructures on top of the electrodes. The proposed\narchitecture removes the interaction between the nanowire and the substrate\nwhich is known to influence disorder and the orientation of the Rashba vector.\nThe relevance of this approach in view of the implementation of Josephson\njunctions based on High-Temperature Superconductors is discussed.\n", "  Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools to understand\norganizational principles in social networks. With the increasing power of\nsocial media platforms, when detecting communities there are two possi- ble\nsources of information one can use: the structure of social network and node\nattributes. However structure of social networks and node attributes are often\ninterpreted separately in the research of community detection. When these two\nsources are interpreted simultaneously, one common as- sumption shared by\nprevious studies is that nodes attributes are correlated with communities. In\nthis paper, we present a model that is capable of combining topology\ninformation and nodes attributes information with- out assuming correlation.\nThis new model can recover communities with higher accuracy even when node\nattributes and communities are uncorre- lated. We derive the detectability\nthreshold for this model and use Belief Propagation (BP) to make inference.\nThis algorithm is optimal in the sense that it can recover community all the\nway down to the threshold. This new model is also with the potential to handle\nedge content and dynamic settings.\n", "  It is well known that graphite has a low capacity for Na but a high capacity\nfor other alkali metals. The growing interest in alternative cation batteries\nbeyond Li makes it particularly important to elucidate the origin of this\nbehavior, which is not well understood. In examining this question, we find a\nquite general phenomenon: among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg\ngenerally have the weakest chemical binding to a given substrate, compared with\nthe other elements in the same column of the periodic table. We demonstrate\nthis with quantum mechanics calculations for a wide range of substrate\nmaterials (not limited to C) covering a variety of structures and chemical\ncompositions. The phenomenon arises from the competition between trends in the\nionization energy and the ion-substrate coupling, down the columns of the\nperiodic table. Consequently, the cathodic voltage for Na and Mg is expected to\nbe lower than those for other metals in the same column. This generality\nprovides a basis for analyzing the binding of alkali and alkaline earth metal\natoms over a broad range of systems.\n", "  The Pierre Auger Observatory has begun a major Upgrade of its already\nimpressive capabilities, with an emphasis on improved mass composition\ndetermination using the surface detectors of the Observatory. Known as\nAugerPrime, the upgrade will include new 4 m$^2$ plastic scintillator detectors\non top of all 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors, updated and more flexible surface\ndetector electronics, a large array of buried muon detectors, and an extended\nduty cycle for operations of the fluorescence detectors. This Preliminary\nDesign Report was produced by the Collaboration in April 2015 as an internal\ndocument and information for funding agencies. It outlines the scientific and\ntechnical case for AugerPrime. We now release it to the public via the arXiv\nserver. We invite you to review the large number of fundamental results already\nachieved by the Observatory and our plans for the future.\n", "  The development of theories and techniques for big data analytics offers\ntremendous flexibility for investigating large-scale events and patterns that\nemerge over space and time. In this research, we utilize a unique open-access\ndataset \"The Global Data on Events, Location and Tone\" (GDELT) to model the\nimage of China in mass media, specifically, how China has related to the rest\nof the world and how this connection has evolved upon time based on an\nautoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results of this\nresearch contribute both in methodological and empirical perspectives: We\nexamined the effectiveness of time series models in predicting trends in\nlong-term mass media data. In addition, we identified various types of\nconnection strength patterns between China and its top 15 related countries.\nThis study generates valuable input to interpret China's diplomatic and\nregional relations based on mass media data, as well as providing\nmethodological references for investigating international relations in other\ncountries and regions in the big data era.\n", "  We present a novel positive potential-density pair expansion for modelling\ngalaxies, based on the Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disc. By using three sets of such\ndiscs, each one of them aligned along each symmetry axis, we are able to\nreconstruct a broad range of potentials that correspond to density profiles\nfrom exponential discs to 3D power law models with varying triaxiality\n(henceforth simply \"twisted\" models). We increase the efficiency of our\nexpansion by allowing the scale length parameter of each disc to be negative.\nWe show that, for suitable priors on the scale length and height parameters,\nthese \"MNn discs\" have just one negative density minimum. This allows us to\nensure global positivity by demanding that the total density at the global\nminimum is positive. We find that at better than 10\\% accuracy in our density\nreconstruction, we can represent a radial and vertical exponential disc over\n$0.1-10$ scale lengths/heights with 4 MNn discs, an NFW profile over $0.1-10$\nscale lengths with 4 MNn discs, and a twisted triaxial NFW profile with 3 MNn\ndiscs per symmetry axis. Our expansion is efficient, fully analytic, and\nwell-suited to reproducing the density distribution and gravitational potential\nof galaxies from discs to ellipsoids.\n", "  The derivation of a quasi-geostrophic (QG) system from the rotating shallow\nwater equations on a midlatitude beta-plane coupled with moisture is presented.\nCondensation is prescribed to occur whenever the moisture at a point exceeds a\nprescribed saturation value. It is seen that a slow condensation time scale is\nrequired to obtain a consistent set of equations at leading order. Further,\nsince the advecting wind fields are geostrophic, changes in moisture (and\nhence, precipitation) occur only via non-divergent mechanisms. Following\nobservations, a saturation profile with gradients in the zonal and meridional\ndirections is prescribed. A purely meridional gradient has the effect of\nslowing down the dry Rossby waves, through a reduction in the \"equivalent\ngradient\" of the background potential vorticity. A large scale unstable moist\nmode results on the inclusion of a zonal gradient by itself, or in conjunction\nwith a meridional moisture gradient. For gradients that are are representative\nof the atmosphere, the most unstable moist mode propagates zonally in the\ndirection of increasing moisture, matures over an intraseasonal timescale and\nhas small phase speed.\n", "  Quantum dot arrays provide a promising platform for quantum information\nprocessing. For universal quantum simulation and computation, one central issue\nis to demonstrate the exhaustive controllability of quantum states. Here, we\nreport the addressable manipulation of three single electron spins in a triple\nquantum dot using a technique combining electron-spin-resonance and a\nmicro-magnet. The micro-magnet makes the local Zeeman field difference between\nneighboring spins much larger than the nuclear field fluctuation, which ensures\nthe addressable driving of electron-spin-resonance by shifting the resonance\ncondition for each spin. We observe distinct coherent Rabi oscillations for\nthree spins in a semiconductor triple quantum dot with up to 25 MHz spin\nrotation frequencies. This individual manipulation over three spins enables us\nto arbitrarily change the magnetic spin quantum number of the three spin\nsystem, and thus to operate a triple-dot device as a three-qubit system in\ncombination with the existing technique of exchange operations among three\nspins.\n", "  Photoelectron emission is crucial to electric charging of dust particles\naround main-sequence stars and gas heating in various dusty environments. An\nestimate of the photoelectric processes contains an ill-defined parameter\ncalled the photoelectric quantum yield, which is the total number of electrons\nejected from a dust particle per absorbed photon. Here we revisit the so-called\nsmall particle effect of photoelectron emission and provide an analytical model\nto estimate photoelectric quantum yields of small dust particles in sizes down\nto nanometers. We show that the small particle effect elevates the\nphotoelectric quantum yields of nanoparticles up to by a factor of $10^3$ for\ncarbon, water ice, and organics, and a factor of $10^2$ for silicate, silicon\ncarbide, and iron. We conclude the surface curvature of the particles is a\nquantity of great importance to the small particle effect, unless the particles\nare submicrometers in radius or larger.\n", "  A gyroid structure is a distinct morphology that is triply periodic and\nconsists of minimal isosurfaces containing no straight lines. We have designed\nand synthesized amorphous silicon (a-Si) mid-infrared gyroid photonic crystals\nthat exhibit a complete bandgap in infrared spectroscopy measurements. Photonic\ncrystals were synthesized by deposition of a-Si/Al2O3 coatings onto a\nsacrificial polymer scaffold defined by two-photon lithography. We observed a\n100% reflectance at 7.5 \\mum for single gyroids with a unit cell size of 4.5\n\\mum, in agreement with the photonic bandgap position predicted from full-wave\nelectromagnetic simulations, whereas the observed reflection peak shifted to 8\num for a 5.5 \\mum unit cell size. This approach represents a\nsimulation-fabrication-characterization platform to realize three-dimensional\ngyroid photonic crystals with well-defined dimensions in real space and\ntailored properties in momentum space.\n", "  Inspired by reliability issues in electric transmission networks, we use a\nprobabilistic approach to study the occurrence of large failures in a stylized\ncascading failure model. In this model, lines have random capacities that\ninitially meet the load demands imposed on the network. Every single line\nfailure changes the load distribution in the surviving network, possibly\ncausing further lines to become overloaded and trip as well. An initial single\nline failure can therefore potentially trigger massive cascading effects, and\nin this paper we measure the risk of such cascading events by the probability\nthat the number of failed lines exceeds a certain large threshold. Under\nparticular critical conditions, the exceedance probability follows a power-law\ndistribution, implying a significant risk of severe failures. We examine the\nrobustness of the power-law behavior by exploring under which assumptions this\nbehavior prevails.\n", "  Cosmic ray science has proved to be a very active field, with several\nimportant results from recent space-based instruments. Next generation\nexperiments will explore the multi-TeV energy range, trying to cope with the\nmass and power budget constraints of artificial satellites that limits the\ncollecting area thus reducing the available statistics at the highest energy.\nWith the aim to improve the compromise between area and mass, we propose a new\nconcept for a cosmic-ray telescope in which the detector elements are organized\nin bars along the 3 axis. In this way we can also maintain a good event shower\nsampling (for direction and energy reconstruction) and a relatively small\nnumber of channels (required power) as the detector size increases. A possible\nimplementation of the concept is also evaluated with a Geant4 simulation.\n", "  We report on the experimental studies of the deformation and fragmentation of\nliquid metal droplets by picosecond and subpicosecond laser pulses. The\nexperiments were performed with laser irradiance varying in 10E13-10E15 W/cm^2\nrange. The observed evolution of the droplet shape upon the impact dramatically\ndiffers from the previously reported for nanosecond laser pulses. Instead of\nflattening the droplet undergoes rapid asymmetric expansion and transforms into\na complex shape which can be interpreted as two conjunct spheroid shells and\nfinally fragments. We explain the described hydrodynamic response to the\nultra-short impact as a result of the propagation of the laser-induced\nconvergent shockwave through the volume of droplet.\n", "  The authors present full wave simulations and experimental results of\npropagation of electromagnetic waves in shallow seawaters. Transmitter and\nreceiver antennas are ten-turns loops placed on the seabed. Some propagation\nframeworks are presented and simulated. Finally, simulation results are\ncompared with experimental ones.\n", "  We present a new computation of the critical value of the random-cluster\nmodel with cluster weight $q\\ge 1$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This provides an\nalternative approach to the result of Beffara and Duminil-Copin. We believe\nthat this approach has several advantages. First, most of the proof can easily\nbe extended to other planar graphs with sufficient symmetries. Furthermore, it\ninvokes RSW-type arguments which are not based on self-duality. And finally, it\ncontains a new way of applying sharp threshold results which avoid the use of\nsymmetric events and periodic boundary conditions.\n", "  Shallow seawaters are problematic for acoustic and optical communications.\nSensor networks based on electromagnetic (EM) communications are evaluated in\nthis environment. In order to characterize the subaquatic channel, several\nmeasurement systems have been designed, built and tested in the sea obtaining\nvery reliable results. Experiments carried out with dipoles and loop antennas\nshowed serious disagreement with the state of the art, especially when dipole\nantennas are used. Dipoles performance was poor while magnetic loops showed\nrelevant results. Measurement system is described in detail and real\nattenuation of the subaquatic channel is obtained for several distances and\nantennas. Finally, measured and simulated results are compared with good\nagreement.\n", "  We study how quantum field theory models are modified under the\nreparametrizations of the space-time coordinates and some simultaneous\ntransformations of the field function. The transformations that turn the action\nof the massive field in the Minkowski space-time into the action of the\nmassless field in some curved space are presented.\n", "  ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is designed and optimized to study\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, in which a hot and dense,\nstrongly-interacting medium is created. Vector bosons (W and Z) are produced in\nhard scattering processes and interact weakly with the medium formed in\nheavy-ion collisions. Thus, they present a suitable reference for processes\nwhich are heavily affected by the medium. In proton-nucleus collisions their\nproduction can be used to study the modification of parton distribution\nfunctions in the nucleus and to test the validity of binary-collision scaling\nfor hard processes. The production of W and Z bosons is studied in p--Pb\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt {s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with\nthe ALICE muon spectrometer at forward ($2.03 < \\mathit{y}^{\\mu}_{\\textrm{cms}}\n< 3.53$) and backward ($-4.46< \\mathit{y}^{\\mu}_{\\textrm{cms}} <-2.96$)\nrapidity. W bosons are studied via the inclusive single muon differential\n$p_{\\rm T}$ spectrum whereas the Z-boson signal is observed in the invariant\nmass distribution of unlike-sign muon pairs as a peak around the Z-boson mass.\nIn this presentation the measured cross sections of W and Z bosons and the\nW-boson yield per centrality interval will be discussed. The cross-sections are\ncompared to theoretical calculations.\n", "  We establish the asymptotic stability of multi-solitons for the\none-dimensional Landau-Lifshitz equation with an easy-plane anisotropy. The\nsolitons have non-zero speed, are ordered according to their speeds and have\nsufficiently separated initial positions. We provide the asymptotic stability\naround solitons and between solitons. More precisely, we show that for an\ninitial datum close to a sum of $N$ dark solitons, the corresponding solution\nconverges weakly to one of the solitons in the sum, when it is translated to\nthe centre of this soliton, and converges weakly to zero when it is translated\nbetween solitons.\n", "  It is shown that the functional form of the equation of state of [4-8] is not\ncorrect in general case.\n", "  An opalic plasmonic sample, constituted by a hexagonal arrangement of\nmetallized silica spheres, presents remarkable optical properties due to the\nmixing of periodic arrangement and singularities at the sphere touching points.\nIt is therefore an interesting candidate for exploiting the excitation of both\nlocalized and propagating surface plasmons. Several channels of excitation\nbased on these properties or exploiting a certain level of disorder are\nevidenced, opening new routes for the efficient excitation of plasmons on a\nwide spectral range. The versatility of such hybrid system is evidenced in the\ncontext of two complementary experiments: specular reflective spectrometry and\nphotoemission electron microscopy. Both techniques offer different points of\nview on the same physical phenomenon and the link between them is discussed.\nSuch experiments evidence the opportunities offered by these 2D hybrid\nmaterials in the context of nanophotonics.\n", "  In this work, we provide two novel approaches to show that incompressible\nfluid flow in a finite domain contains at most a finite number vortices. We use\na recently developed geometric theory of incompressible viscous flows along\nwith an existing mathematical analysis concept to establish the finiteness. We\nalso offer a second proof of finiteness by roping in the Kolmogorov's length\nscale criterion in conjunction with the notion of diametric disks.\n", "  In this letter, a new generalized matrix spectral problem of Dirac type\nassociated with the super Lie algebra $\\mathcal{B}(0,1)$ is proposed and its\ncorresponding super integrable hierarchy is constructed.\n", "  Ultrafast charge transport in strongly biased semiconductors is at the heart\nof highspeed electronics, electro-optics, and fundamental solid-state physics.\nIntense light pulses in the terahertz (THz) spectral range have opened\nfascinating vistas: Since THz photon energies are far below typical electronic\ninterband resonances, a stable electromagnetic waveform may serve as a\nprecisely adjustable bias. Novel quantum phenomena have been anticipated for\nTHz amplitudes reaching atomic field strengths. We exploit controlled THz\nwaveforms with peak fields of 72 MV/cm to drive coherent interband polarization\ncombined with dynamical Bloch oscillations in semiconducting gallium selenide.\nThese dynamics entail the emission of phase-stable high-harmonic transients,\ncovering the entire THz-to-visible spectral domain between 0.1 and 675 THz.\nQuantum interference of different ionization paths of accelerated charge\ncarriers is controlled via the waveform of the driving field and explained by a\nquantum theory of inter- and intraband dynamics. Our results pave the way\ntowards all-coherent THz-rate electronics.\n", "  The influence of hypertension on low-density lipoproteins intake into the\narterial wall is an important factor for understanding mechanisms of\natherosclerosis. It has been experimentally observed that the increased\npressure leads to the higher level of the LDL inside the wall. In this paper we\nattempt to construct a model of the LDL transport which reproduces\nquantitatively experimental outcomes. We supplement the well known four-layer\narterial wall model to include two pressure induced effects: the compression of\nthe intima tissue and the increase of the fraction of leaky junctions. We\ndemonstrate that such model can reach the very good agreement with experimental\ndata.\n", "  The occurrence of segregation in highly dilute alloys under irradiation is an\nunusual phenomenon that has so far eluded theoretical explanation. Using ab\ninitio calculations, we are able to explain the origin of radiation-induced\nrhenium segregation in dilute tungsten-rhenium alloys.\n", "  Traditional evolutionary game theory describes how certain strategy spreads\nthroughout the system where individual player imitates the most successful\nstrategy among its neighborhood. Accordingly, player doesn't have own authority\nto change their state. However in the human society, peoples do not just follow\nstrategies of other people, they choose their own strategy. In order to see the\ndecision of each agent in timely basis and differentiate between network\nstructures, we conducted multi-agent based modeling and simulation. In this\npaper, agent can decide its own strategy by payoff comparison and we name this\nagent as \"Self-motivated agent\". To explain the behavior of self-motivated\nagent, prisoner's dilemma game with cooperator, defector, loner and punisher\nare considered as an illustrative example. We performed simulation by\ndifferentiating participation rate, mutation rate and the degree of network,\nand found the special coexisting conditions.\n", "  We analyse a 154 MHz image made from a 12 h observation with the Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA) to determine the noise contribution and behaviour of the\nsource counts down to 30 mJy. The MWA image has a bandwidth of 30.72 MHz, a\nfield-of-view within the half-power contour of the primary beam of 570 deg^2, a\nresolution of 2.3 arcmin and contains 13,458 sources above 5 sigma. The rms\nnoise in the centre of the image is 4-5 mJy/beam. The MWA counts are in\nexcellent agreement with counts from other instruments and are the most precise\never derived in the flux density range 30-200 mJy due to the sky area covered.\nUsing the deepest available source count data, we find that the MWA image is\naffected by sidelobe confusion noise at the ~3.5 mJy/beam level, due to\nincompletely-peeled and out-of-image sources, and classical confusion becomes\napparent at ~1.7 mJy/beam. This work highlights that (i) further improvements\nin ionospheric calibration and deconvolution imaging techniques would be\nrequired to probe to the classical confusion limit and (ii) the shape of\nlow-frequency source counts, including any flattening towards lower flux\ndensities, must be determined from deeper ~150 MHz surveys as it cannot be\ndirectly inferred from higher frequency data.\n", "  We present a rapid-scan, time-domain terahertz spectrometer employing\nfemtosecond Er:fiber technology and an acousto-optic delay with attosecond\nprecision, enabling scanning of terahertz transients over a 12.4 ps time window\nat a waveform refresh rate of 36 kHz, and a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.7\n\\times 10^5/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$. Our approach enables real-time monitoring of\ndynamic THz processes at unprecedented speeds, which we demonstrate through\nrapid 2D thickness mapping of a spinning teflon disc at a precision of $10\\,\\rm\nnm/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$. The compact, all-optical design ensures alignment-free\noperation even in harsh environments.\n", "  Accelerating and colliding particles has been a key strategy to explore the\ntexture of matter. Strong lightwaves can control and recollide electronic\nwavepackets, generating high-harmonic (HH) radiation which encodes the\nstructure and dynamics of atoms and molecules and lays the foundations of\nattosecond science. The recent discovery of HH generation in bulk solids\ncombines the idea of ultrafast acceleration with complex condensed matter\nsystems and sparks hope for compact solid-state attosecond sources and\nelectronics at optical frequencies. Yet the underlying quantum motion has not\nbeen observable in real time. Here, we study HH generation in a bulk solid\ndirectly in the time-domain, revealing a new quality of strong-field\nexcitations in the crystal. Unlike established atomic sources, our solid emits\nHH radiation as a sequence of subcycle bursts which coincide temporally with\nthe field crests of one polarity of the driving terahertz waveform. We show\nthat these features hallmark a novel non-perturbative quantum interference\ninvolving electrons from multiple valence bands. The results identify key\nmechanisms for future solid-state attosecond sources and next-generation\nlightwave electronics. The new quantum interference justifies the hope for\nall-optical bandstructure reconstruction and lays the foundation for possible\nquantum logic operations at optical clock rates.\n", "  In the last decade, the viscous decretion disk model has emerged as the new\nparadigm for Be star disks. In this contribution, we propose a simple\nanalytical model to estimate the continuum infrared excess arising from these\ncircumstellar disks, in the light of the currently accepted scenario. We\ndemonstrate that the disk can be satisfactorily described by a two component\nsystem: an inner optically thick region, which we call the pseudo-photosphere,\nand a diffuse outer part. In particular, a direct connexion between the disk\nbrightness profile and the thermal structure is derived, and then confronted to\nrealistic numerical simulations. This result quantifies how the\nnon-isothermality of the disk ultimately affects both infrared measured fluxes\nand visibilities.\n", "  Comets have been invoked in numerous studies as a potentially important\nsource of dust and gas around stars, but none has studied the thermo-physical\nevolution, out-gassing rate, and dust ejection of these objects in such stellar\nsystems. We investigate the thermo-physical evolution of comets in\nexo-planetary systems in order to provide valuable theoretical data required to\ninterpret observations of gas and dust. We use a quasi 3D model of cometary\nnucleus to study the thermo-physical evolution of comets evolving around a\nsingle star from 0.1 to 50 AU, whose homogeneous luminosity varies from 0.1 to\n70 solar luminosities. This paper provides mass ejection, lifetimes, and the\nrate of dust and water gas mass productions for comets as a function of the\ndistance to the star and stellar luminosity. Results show significant physical\nchanges to comets at high stellar luminosities. The models are presented in\nsuch a manner that they can be readily applied to any planetary system. By\nconsidering the examples of the Solar System, Vega and HD 69830, we show that\ndust grains released from sublimating comets have the potential to create the\nobserved (exo)zodiacal emission. We show that observations can be reproduced by\n1 to 2 massive comets or by a large number of comets whose orbits approach\nclose to the star. Our conclusions depend on the stellar luminosity and the\nuncertain lifetime of the dust grains. We find, as in previous studies, that\nexozodiacal dust disks can only survive if replenished by a population of\ntypically sized comets renewed from a large and cold reservoir of cometary\nbodies beyond the water ice line. These comets could reach the inner regions of\nthe planetary system following scattering by a (giant) planet.\n", "  We reconstruct $f(R,T)$ theory (where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $T$ is\nthe trace of energy-momentum tensor) in the framework of QCD ghost dark energy\nmodels. In this study, we concentrate on particular models of $f(R,T)$ gravity\nwhich permits the standard continuity equation in this theory. It is found that\nreconstructed function can represent phantom and quintessence regimes of the\nuniverse in the background of flat FRW universe. In addition, we explore the\nstability of ghost $f(R,T)$ models.\n", "  For a ground-based radio interferometer observing at low frequencies, the\nionosphere causes propagation delays and refraction of cosmic radio waves which\nresult in phase errors in the received signal. These phase errors can be\ncorrected using a calibration method that assumes a two-dimensional phase\nscreen at a fixed altitude above the surface of the Earth, known as the\nthin-layer model. Here we investigate the validity of the thin-layer model and\nprovide a simple equation with which users can check when this approximation\ncan be applied to observations for varying time of day, zenith angle,\ninterferometer latitude, baseline length, ionospheric electron content and\nobserving frequency.\n", "  The precise mechanisms underlying the failure of multi-phase materials may be\nstrongly dependent on the material's microstructural morphology.\nMicromechanical modeling has provided much insight into this dependence, but\nuncertainties remain about crucial modeling assumptions. This paper assesses\nthe influence of different grain shapes, damage indicators, and stress states\nusing a structured numerical model. A distinct spatial arrangement of phases\naround fracture incidents is found, consisting of hard regions in the tensile\ndirection interrupted by soft regions in the directions of shear. These key\nfeatures are only mildly sensitive to the studied variations.\n", "  An original experimental approach is presented to automatically determine the\naverage phase distribution around damage sites in multi-phase materials. An\nobjective measure is found to be the average intensity around damage sites,\ncalculated using many images. This method has the following benefits: no phase\nidentification or manual interventions are required, and statistical\nfluctuations and measurement noise are effectively averaged. The method is\ndemonstrated for dual-phase steel, revealing subtle unexpected differences in\nthe morphology surrounding damage in strongly and weakly banded\nmicrostructures.\n", "  This paper studies a two-phase material with a microstructure composed of a\nhard brittle reinforcement phase embedded in a soft ductile matrix. It\naddresses the full three-dimensional nature of the microstructure and\nmacroscopic deformation. A large ensemble of periodic microstructures is used,\nwhereby the individual grains of the two phases are modeled using equi-sized\ncubes. A particular solution strategy relying on the Fast Fourier Transform is\nadopted, which has a high computational efficiency both in terms of speed and\nmemory footprint, thus enabling a statistically meaningful analysis. This\nsolution method naturally accompanies the regular microstructural model, as the\nFast Fourier Transform relies on a regular grid.\n  Using the many considered microstructures as an ensemble, the average\narrangement of phases around fracture initiation sites is objectively\nidentified by the correlation between microstructure and fracture initiation --\nin three dimensions. The results show that fracture initiates where regions of\nthe hard phase are interrupted by bands of the soft phase that are aligned with\nthe direction of maximum shear. In such regions, the hard phase is arranged\nsuch that the area of the phase boundary perpendicular to the principal strain\ndirection is maximum, leading to high hydrostatic tensile stresses, while not\ninterrupting the shear bands that form in the soft phase. The local\nincompatibility that is present around the shear bands is responsible for a\nhigh plastic strain. By comparing the response to a two-dimensional\nmicrostructure it is observed that the response is qualitatively similar (both\nmacroscopically and microscopically). One important difference is that the\nlocal strain partitioning between the two phases is over-predicted by the\ntwo-dimensional microstructure, leading to an overestimation of damage.\n", "  An anisotropic elasticity tensor can be approximated by the closest tensor\nbelonging to a higher symmetry class. The closeness of tensors depends on the\nchoice of a criterion. We compare the closest isotropic tensors obtained using\nfour approaches: the Frobenius 36-component norm, the Frobenius 21-component\nnorm, the operator norm and the L2 slowness-curve fit. We find that the\nisotropic tensors are similar to each other within the range of expected\nmeasurement errors.\n", "  Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of superconducting thin\nlanthanum films grown on a normal metal tungsten substrate reveal an\nextraordinarily large broadening of the coherence peaks. The observed\nbroadening corresponds to very short electron-like quasiparticle lifetimes in\nthe tunneling process. A thorough analysis considering the different relaxation\nprocesses reveals that the dominant mechanism is an efficient quasiparticle\nrelaxation at the interface between the superconducting film and the underlying\nsubstrate. This process is of general relevance to scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy studies on thin superconducting films and enables measurements of\nfilm thicknesses via a spectroscopic method.\n", "  The orientation of Christian churches is a well-known distinctive feature of\ntheir architecture. There is a general tendency to align their apses in the\nsolar range, favoring orientations close to the east (astronomical equinox),\nalthough the alignments in the opposite direction, namely, with the apse\ntowards the west, are not unusual. The case of the churches built in northwest\nAfrica before the arrival of Islam is paradigmatic in this regard, and may\nreflect earlier traditions. The Canary Islands is the western end of this North\nAfrican cultural koine, so we thought it would be relevant to study a compact\nset of old churches in one of the islands of the archipelago, choosing to start\nour project with Lanzarote. We have measured the orientation of a total of 30\nchurches built prior to 1810, as well as a few buildings of later times, nearly\na complete sample of all the island Christian sanctuaries. The analysis of this\nsample indicates that a definite orientation pattern was followed on the island\nbut, unlike the standard one often found in most of the Christian world, this\nprototype is twofold. On the one hand, the representative orientation to the\neast (or west) is present. However, the sample has also a marked orientation\ntowards the north-northeast, which is as far as we know a pattern exclusive of\nLanzarote. We analyze the reasons for this rule and suggest that one possible\nexplanation could be a rather prosaic one, namely, that sometimes earthly needs\nare more relevant than religious beliefs.\n", "  In lieu of abstract, first paragraph reads: Galimzyanov et al. [1] find that\nline tension between thick liquid-ordered ($L_{o}$) and thinner\nliquid-disordered ($L_{d}$) registered lipid bilayer phases is minimised by an\nasymmetric \"slip region\", length $L\\!\\sim\\!5\\,\\textrm{nm}$ (Fig. 1). They claim\nthat line tensions alone explain domain registration, without \"direct\"\n(area-dependent) inter-leaflet interaction [2,3]. We show this is unfounded,\nwithout direct interaction their results would predict\n\\textit{antiregistration}, dependent on composition. To find equilibrium from\nline energies, line \\textit{tensions} must be combined with interfacial lengths\nfor given states at given composition. This was not done in [1].\n", "  We review recent results on intermediate mass cluster production in heavy ion\ncollisions at Fermi energy and in spallation reactions. Our studies are based\non modern transport theories, employing effective interactions for the nuclear\nmean-field and incorporating two-body correlations and fluctuations. Namely we\nwill consider the Stochastic Mean Field (SMF) approach and the recently\ndeveloped Boltzmann-Langevin One Body (BLOB) model. We focus on cluster\nproduction emerging from the possible occurrence of low-density mean-field\ninstabilities in heavy ion reactions. Within such a framework, the respective\nrole of one and two-body effects, in the two models considered, will be\ncarefully analysed. We will discuss, in particular, fragment production in\ncentral and semi-peripheral heavy ion collisions, which is the object of many\nrecent experimental investigations. Moreover, in the context of spallation\nreactions, we will show how thermal expansion may trigger the development of\nmean-field instabilities, leading to a cluster formation process which competes\nwith important re-aggregation effects.\n", "  In this chapter a quantum communication protocol with use of repeaters is\npresented. The protocol is constructed for qudits i.e. the generalized quantum\ninformation units. One-dit teleportation is based on the generalized Pauli-Z\n(phase-flip) gate's correction. This approach avoids using Pauli-X and Hadamard\ngates unlike in other known protocols based on quantum repeaters which were\nconstructed for qubits and qudits. It is also important to mention that the\nrepeaters based on teleportation protocol, described in this chapter, allow a\nmeasurement in the standard base (what simplifies the measurement process) and\nthe use of teleportation causes only Pauli-Z operational errors.\n", "  This study addresses the mitigation of a nonlinear resonance of a mechanical\nsystem. In view of the narrow bandwidth of the classical linear tuned vibration\nabsorber, a nonlinear absorber, termed the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber\n(NLTVA), is introduced in this paper. An unconventional aspect of the NLTVA is\nthat the mathematical form of its restoring force is tailored according to the\nnonlinear restoring force of the primary system. The NLTVA parameters are then\ndetermined using a nonlinear generalization of Den Hartog's equal-peak method.\nThe mitigation of the resonant vibrations of a Duffing oscillator is considered\nto illustrate the proposed developments.\n", "  A modified theory of general relativity is proposed, where the gravitational\nconstant is replaced by a dynamical variable in space-time. The dynamics of the\ngravitational coupling is described by a family of parametrized null geodesics,\nimplying that the gravitational coupling at a space-time point is determined by\nsolving transport equations along all null geodesics through this point.\n  General relativity with dynamical gravitational coupling (DGC) is introduced.\nWe motivate DGC from general considerations and explain how it arises in the\ncontext of causal fermion systems. The underlying physical idea is that the\ngravitational coupling is determined by microscopic structures on the Planck\nscale which propagate with the speed of light.\n  In order to clarify the mathematical structure, we analyze the conformal\nbehavior and prove local existence and uniqueness of the time evolution. The\ndifferences to Einstein's theory are worked out in the examples of the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker model and the spherically symmetric collapse of a\nshell of matter. Potential implications for the problem of dark matter and for\ninflation are discussed. It is shown that the effects in the solar system are\ntoo small for being observable in present-day experiments.\n", "  Olivier Chesneau founded a brand new field of observational astrophysics with\nhis attempts to resolve the novae expanding fireball from the very first days\nof the explosion. With the images he could get, he showed that novae do indeed\nexplode in an aspherical way, leading to a change of paradigm for the physics\nof these yet-poorly understood catastrophic systems. He also set the stage for\na new way of estimating novae distances, by directly measuring the sky-size of\nthe fireball and comparing it with spectroscopic scales, taking into account\nthe tremendous effects of the fireball geometry.\n", "  Olivier Chesneau challenged several fields of observational stellar\nastrophysics with bright ideas and an impressive amount of work to make them\nreal in the span of his career, from his first paper on P Cygni in 2000, up to\nhis last one on V838 Mon in 2014. He was using all the so-called high-angular\nresolution techniques since it helped his science to be made, namely study in\ndetails the inner structure of the environments around stars, be it small mass\n(AGBs), more massive (supergiant stars), or explosives (Novae). I will focus\nhere on his work on massive stars.\n", "  We present the results of multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizations of\na potential single shot ultra fast electron diffraction beamline utilizing a\n100 MV/m 1.6 cell normal conducting rf (NCRF) gun, as well as a 9 cell 2pi/3\nbunching cavity placed between two solenoids. Optimizations of the transverse\nprojected emittance as a function of bunch charge are presented and discussed\nin terms of the scaling laws derived in the charge saturation limit.\nAdditionally, optimization of the transverse coherence length as a function of\nfinal rms bunch length at the sample location have been performed for a charge\nof 1e6 electrons. Analysis of the solutions is discussed, as are the effects of\ndisorder induced heating. In particular, for a charge of $10^6$ electrons and\nfinal beam size greater than or equal to 25 microns, we found a relative\ncoherence length of 0.07, 0.1, and 0.2 nm/micron for a final bunch length of\napproximately 5, 30, and 100 fs, respectively. These results demonstrate the\nviability of using genetic algorithms in the design and operation of ultrafast\nelectron diffraction beamlines.\n", "  Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods offer a very interesting compromise\nbetween accuracy and computational load. In order to assess the performance of\nNDDO methods in the interpretation of terahertz spectra, the low frequency\nvibration modes of three crystalline materials, namely, polyethylene,\npoly(vinylidene fluoride) form II and $\\alpha$-D-glucose have been studied\nusing the PM6 and PM7 Hamiltonians and the results have been compared with the\nexperimental data and former calculations. The results show good qualitative or\nsemi-quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed terahertz spectra.\n", "  The scope of the paper is the analysis of the impact of flow reversal on the\ndynamics of cascades of reactors. Periodic and chaotic oscillations occur in\nthe analyzed system. There is a dependence between the oscillation period of\nthe state variable of the system without flow reversal and the recurrence\nperiod of windows of chaos in the steady-state diagram of the system with flow\nreversal.\n", "  We report quasi-two-dimensional Dirac fermions and quantum magnetoresistance\nin LaAgBi$_2$. The band structure shows several narrow bands with nearly linear\nenergy dispersion and Dirac-cone-like points at the Fermi level. The quantum\noscillation experiments revealed one quasi-two-dimensional Fermi pocket and\nanother complex pocket with small cyclotron resonant mass. The in-plane\ntransverse magnetoresistance exhibits a crossover at a critical field $B^*$\nfrom semiclassical weak-field $B^2$ dependence to the high-field unsaturated\nlinear magnetoresistance which is attributed to the quantum limit of the Dirac\nfermions. Our results suggest the existence of quasi 2D Dirac fermions in\nrare-earth based layered compounds with two-dimensional double-sized Bi square\nnets, similar to (Ca,Sr)MnBi$_{2}$, irrespective of magnetic order.\n", "  The explosion of a core collapse supernova drives a powerful shock front into\nthe wind from the progenitor star. A layer of shocked circumstellar gas and\nejecta develops that is subject to hydrodynamic instabilities. The hot gas can\nbe observed directly by its X-ray emission, some of which is absorbed and\nre-radiated at lower frequencies by the ejecta and the circumstellar gas.\nSynchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated at the shock\nfronts provides information on the mass loss density if free-free absorption\ndominates at early times or the size of the emitting region if synchrotron\nself-absorption dominates. Analysis of the interaction leads to information on\nthe density and structure of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium, and the\nabundances in these media. The emphasis here is on the physical processes\nrelated to the interaction.\n", "  We present a review of X-ray observations of supernovae (SNe). By observing\nthe (~0.1-100 keV) X-ray emission from young SNe, physical key parameters such\nas the circumstellar matter (CSM) density, mass-loss rate of the progenitor and\ntemperature of the outgoing and reverse shock can be derived as a function of\ntime. Despite intensive search over the last ~25 years, only 15 SNe have been\ndetected in X-rays. We review the individual X-ray observations of these SNe\nand discuss their implications as to our understanding of the physical\nprocesses giving rise to the X-ray emission.\n", "  Since 1997 the afterglow of gamma-ray bursting sources (GRBs) has\noccasionally been detected in the radio, as well in other wavelengths bands. In\nparticular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst GRB980425, thought to\nbe related to the radio supernova SN1998bw, is a possible link between the two\nclasses of objects. Analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable for\nSN1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well established\nframework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. This\nthen allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties\nof the object. The radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a\nmildly relativistic shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind-established\ncircumstellar medium (CSM) that is highly structured both azimuthally, in\nclumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. Because\nof its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of\nSN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes\nof GRBs originate in supernova (SN) massive star explosions. Thus, employing\nthe formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae (SNe) and\nfollowing the link through SN1998bw/GRB980425, it is possible to model the\ngross properties of the radio and optical/infrared (OIR) emission from the\nhalf-dozen GRBs with extensive radio observations. From this we conclude that\nat least some members of the ``slow-soft'' class of GRBs can be attributed to\nthe explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured CSM that was\npresumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.\n", "  The current classification scheme for supernovae is presented. The main\nobservational features of the supernova types are described and the physical\nimplications briefly addressed. Differences between the homogeneous\nthermonuclear type Ia and similarities among the heterogeneous core collapse\ntype Ib, Ic and II are highlighted. Transforming type IIb, narrow line type\nIIn, supernovae associated with GRBs and few peculiar objects are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The available historical records of supernovae occurring in our own Galaxy\nover the past two thousand years are reviewed. These accounts include the\nwell-recorded supernovae of AD 1604 (Kepler's SN), 1572 (Tycho's SN), 1181,\n1054 (which produced the Crab Nebula) and 1006, together with less certain\nevents dating back to AD 185. In the case of the supernovae of AD 1604 and 1572\nit is European records that provide the most accurate information available,\nwhereas for earlier supernovae records are principally from East Asian sources.\nAlso discussed briefly are several spurious supernova candidates, and the\nfuture prospects for studies of historical supernovae.\n", "  A pedagogical derivation is presented of the ``fireball'' model of gamma-ray\nbursts, according to which the observable effects are due to the dissipation of\nthe kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding wind, a ``fireball.'' The\nmain open questions are emphasized, and key afterglow observations, that\nprovide support for this model, are briefly discussed. The relativistic outflow\nis, most likely, driven by the accretion of a fraction of a solar mass onto a\nnewly born (few) solar mass black hole. The observed radiation is produced once\nthe plasma has expanded to a scale much larger than that of the underlying\n``engine,'' and is therefore largely independent of the details of the\nprogenitor, whose gravitational collapse leads to fireball formation. Several\nprogenitor scenarios, and the prospects for discrimination among them using\nfuture observations, are discussed. The production in gamma- ray burst\nfireballs of high energy protons and neutrinos, and the implications of burst\nneutrino detection by kilometer-scale telescopes under construction, are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Photometry is the most easily acquired information about supernovae. The\nlight curves constructed from regular imaging provide signatures not only for\nthe energy input, the radiation escape, the local environment and the\nprogenitor stars, but also for the intervening dust. They are the main tool for\nthe use of supernovae as distance indicators through the determination of the\nluminosity. The light curve of SN 1987A still is the richest and longest\nobserved example for a core-collapse supernova. Despite the peculiar nature of\nthis object, as explosion of a blue supergiant, it displayed all the\ncharacteristics of Type II supernovae. The light curves of Type Ib/c supernovae\nare more homogeneous, but still display the signatures of explosions in massive\nstars, among them early interaction with their circumstellar material. Wrinkles\nin the near-uniform appearance of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae have\nemerged during the past decade. Subtle differences have been observed\nespecially at near-infrared wavelengths. Interestingly, the light curve shapes\nappear to correlate with a variety of other characteristics of these\nsupernovae. The construction of bolometric light curves provides the most\ndirect link to theoretical predictions and can yield sorely needed constraints\nfor the models. First steps in this direction have been already made.\n", "  We explore progress in understanding the behaviour of cation conducting\nglasses, within the context of an evolving ''dynamic structure model'' (DSM).\nThis behaviour includes: in single cation glasses a strong dependence of ion\nmobility on concentration, and in mixed cation glasses a range of anomalies\nknown collectively as the mixed alkali effect. We argue that this rich\nphenomenology arises from the emergence during cooling of a well-defined\nstructure in glass melts resulting from the interplay of chemical interactions\nand thermally driven ionic motions. The new DSM proposes the existence of a new\nsite relaxation process, involving the shrinkage of empty $\\bar A$ sites (thus\ntailored to the needs of $A^+$ ions), and the concurrent emergence of empty\n$C'$&#146;sites, which interrupt the conduction pathways. This reduction of\n$\\bar A$ sites is responsible in the molten glass for the sharp fall in\nconductivity as temperature drops towards $T_g$. The $C'$ sites play an\nimportant role also in the mixed alkali effect, especially in regard to the\npronounced asymmetries in diffusion behaviour of dissimilar cations.\n", "  We analyze the possibility of measuring the single spin asymmetry (SSA) in\nopen charm production by linearly polarized photons in the planned E160/E161\nexperiments at SLAC using the inclusive spectra of secondary (decay) leptons.\nIn leading order pQCD, the SSA in the azimuthal distribution of the charged\ndecay lepton is predicted to be about 0.2 for SLAC kinematics. Our calculations\nshow that the SSA in the decay lepton distribution is well defined in pQCD: it\nis stable both perturbatively and parametrically, and practically insensitive\nto theoretical uncertainties in the charm semileptonic decays. Nonperturbative\ncontributions to the leptonic SSA due to the gluon transverse motion in the\ntarget, heavy quark fragmentation and Fermi motion of the $c$-quark inside the\n$D$-meson are predicted to be about 10%. We conclude that measurements of the\nazimuthal asymmetry in the secondary lepton distribution would provide a good\ntest of the applicability of pQCD to open charm production at energies of fixed\ntarget experiments. Our analysis of the SLAC experimental conditions shows that\nthis SSA can be measured in E160/E161 with an accuracy of about ten percent.\n", "  Exact solutions to the low-energy effective action (LEEA) of the\nfour-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge field theories are known to be\nobtained either by quantum field theory methods from S-duality in the\nSeiberg-Witten approach, or by the Type-IIA superstring/M-Theory methods of\nbrane technology. After a brief review of the standard field-theoretical\nresults for the N=2 gauge (Seiberg-Witten) LEEA, we consider a\nfield-theoretical derivation of the exact hypermultiplet LEEA by using the N=2\nharmonic superspace methods. We illustrate our techniques on a number of\nexplicit examples. Our main purpose, however, is to discuss the existing\nanalytical (calculational) support for the alternative methods of brane\ntechnology. We summarize known exact solutions to the eleven-dimensional and\nten-dimensional type-IIA supergravities, which describe classical\nconfigurations of intersecting BPS branes with eight supercharges relevant to\nthe non-perturbative N=2 gauge field theory with fundamental hypermultiplet\nmatter. The crucial role of M-Theory in providing a classical resolution of\nsingularities in the ten-dimensional (Type-IIA superstring) brane picture, as\nwell as the N=2 extended supersymmetry in four dimensions, are made manifest.\nThe two approaches to a derivation of the exact N=2 gauge theory LEEA are thus\nseen to be complementary to each other and mutually dependent.\n", "  We review aspects of N=1 duality between the heterotic string and F-theory.\nAfter a description of string duality intended for the non-specialist the\nframework and the constraints for heterotic/F-theory compactifications are\npresented. The computations of the necessary Calabi-Yau manifold and vector\nbundle data, involving characteristic classes and bundle moduli, are given in\ndetail. The matching of the spectrum of chiral multiplets and of the number of\nheterotic five-branes respectively F-theory three-branes, needed for anomaly\ncancellation in four-dimensional vacua, is pointed out. Several examples of\nfour-dimensional dual pairs are constructed where on both sides the geometry of\nthe involved manifolds relies on del Pezzo surfaces.\n", "  Intermolecular dynamics of highly excited DCO (X^2A') is studied from a\nclassical-quantum perspective using the effective spectroscopic Hamiltonian\nproposed recently by Trollch and Temps (Z. Phy. Chem. 215, 207 (2001)). This\nwork focuses on the polyads P = 3 and P = 4 corresponding to excitation\nenergies E_v ~ 5100 cm^-1 and 7000 cm^-1 respectively. The majority of states\nbelonging to these polyads are dynamically assigned, despite extensive\nstochasticity in the classical phase space, using the recently proposed\ntechnique of level velocities. A wavelet based time-frequency analysis is used\nto reveal the nature of phase space transport and the relevant dynamical\nbottlenecks. The local frequency analysis clearly illustrates the existence of\nmode-specific IVR dynamics i.e., differing nature of the IVR dynamics ensuing\nfrom CO stretch and the DCO bend bright states. In addition the role of the\nweak Fermi resonance involving the CO stretch and DCO bend modes is\ninvestigated. A key feature of the present work is that the techniques utilized\nfor the analysis i.e., parametric variations and local frequency analysis are\nnot limited by the dimensionality of the system. This study, thus, explores the\npotential for understanding IVR in large molecules from both time domain and\nfrequency domain perspectives.\n", "  Rotationally resolved infrared spectra are reported for halogen atom - HF\nfree radical complexes formed in helium nanodroplets. An effusive pyrolysis\nsource is used to dope helium droplets with Cl, Br and I atoms, formed by\nthermal dissociation of Cl$_2$, Br$_2$ and I$_2$. A single hydrogen fluoride\nmolecule is then added to the droplets, resulting in the formation of the X-HF\ncomplexes of interest. Analysis of the resulting spectra confirms that the\nobserved species have $^2\\Pi_{3/2}$ ground electronic states, consistent with\nthe linear hydrogen bound structures predicted from theory. Stark spectra are\nalso reported for these species, from which the permanent electric dipole\nmoments are determined.\n"]}
