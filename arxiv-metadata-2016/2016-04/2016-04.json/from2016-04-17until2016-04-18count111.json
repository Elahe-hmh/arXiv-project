In this paper an\nintroduction to this subject will be given. Some theoretical approaches to the\nproblem will be outlined. Most attention will be given to the Quasi-Static Bath\nApproximation, to the cluster expansion theories of dephasing due to the\nnuclear dynamics induced by the dipolar interactions (spectral diffusion), and\nto the effective Hamiltonian based theory of dephasing due to\nhyperfine-mediated interactions. The connections between the theoretical\nresults and various experiments will be emphasized.\n", "  We discuss the relevance of directional detection experiments in the\npost-discovery era and propose a method to extract the local dark matter phase\nspace distribution from directional data. The first feature of this method is a\nparameterization of the dark matter distribution function in terms of integrals\nof motion, which can be analytically extended to infer properties of the global\ndistribution if certain equilibrium conditions hold. The second feature of our\nmethod is a decomposition of the distribution function in moments of a model\nindependent basis, with minimal reliance on the ansatz for its functional form.\nWe illustrate our method using the Via Lactea II N-body simulation as well as\nan analytical model for the dark matter halo. We conclude that O(1000) events\nare necessary to measure deviations from the Standard Halo Model and constrain\nor measure the presence of anisotropies.\n", "  It was found by Amati et al. in 2002 that for a small sample of 9 gamma-ray\nbursts, more distant events appear to be systematically harder in the soft\ngamma-ray band. Here, we have collected a larger sample of 65 gamma-ray bursts,\nwhose time integrated spectra are well established and can be well fitted with\nthe so called Band function. It is confirmed that a correlation between the\nredshifts ($z$) and the low-energy indices ($\\alpha$) of the Band function does\nexist, though it is a bit more scattered than the result of Amati et al. This\ncorrelation can not be simply attributed to the effect of photon reddening.\nFurthermore, correlations between $\\alpha$ and $E_{\\rm peak}$ (the peak energy\nin the $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectrum in the rest frame), $\\alpha$ and $E_{\\rm iso}$\n(the isotropic energy release), $\\alpha$ and $L_{\\rm iso}$ (the isotropic\nluminosity) are also found, which indicate that these parameters are somehow\nconnected. The results may give useful constraints on the physics of gamma-ray\nbursts.\n", "  We report transport measurements on a Si/SiGe quantum dot subject to\nmicrowave excitation via an on-chip antenna. The response shows signatures of\nphoton-assisted tunneling and only a small effect on charge stability. We also\nexplore the use of a d.c. current applied to the antenna for generating\ntunable, local magnetic field gradients and put bounds on the achievable field\ngradients, limited by heating of the reservoirs.\n", "  Controlling long-range quantum correlations is central to quantum computation\nand simulation. In quantum dot arrays, experiments so far rely on\nnearest-neighbour couplings only, and inducing long-range correlations requires\nsequential local operations. Here we show that two distant sites can be tunnel\ncoupled directly. The coupling is mediated by virtual occupation of an\nintermediate site, with a strength that is controlled via the energy detuning\nof this site. It permits a single charge to oscillate coherently between the\nouter sites of a triple dot array without passing through the middle, as\ndemonstrated through the observation of Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg\ninterference. The long-range coupling significantly improves the prospects of\nfault-tolerant quantum computation using quantum dot arrays and opens up new\navenues for performing quantum simulations in nanoscale devices.\n", "  We report both photon- and phonon-assisted tunneling transitions in a linear\narray of three quantum dots, which can only be understood by considering the\nfull three-dimensionality of the charge stability diagram. Such tunneling\ntransitions potentially contribute to leakage of qubits defined in this system.\nA detailed understanding of these transitions is important as they become more\nabundant and complex to analyze as quantum dot arrays are scaled up.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the trispectrum of the curvature perturbation\ngenerated within a stable, well defined and predictive theory which comprises\nan inflationary phase. In this model the usual shift symmetry is enhanced up to\nthe so-called Galileon symmetry. The appeal of this type of theories rests on\nbeing unitary and stable under quantum corrections. Furthermore, in the\nspecific model under consideration here, these properties have been shown to\napproximately hold in realistic scenarios which account for curved spacetime\nand the coupling with gravity. In the literature, the analysis of the\nbispectrum of the curvature perturbation for this theory revealed non-Gaussian\nfeatures which are shared by a number of inflationary models, including stable\nones. It is therefore both timely and useful to investigate further and turn to\nobservables such as the trispectrum. We find that, in a number of specific\nmomenta configurations, the trispectrum shape-functions present strikingly\ndifferent features as compared to, for example, the entire class of the\nso-called $P(X,\\phi)$ inflationary models.\n", "  In this paper we study the eigenvalue sums of Dirichlet Laplacians on bounded\ndomains. Among our results we establish an improvement of the Li-Yau bound in\nthe presence of a constant magnetic field.\n", "  We present time-resolved measurements of spin-flip photon-assisted tunneling\nand spin-flip relaxation in a doubly occupied double quantum dot. The\nphoton-assisted excitation rate as a function of magnetic field indicates that\nspin-orbit coupling is the dominant mechanism behind the spin-flip under the\npresent conditions. We are able to extract the resulting effective `spin-flip\ntunneling' energy, which is found to be three orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe regular spin-conserving tunneling energy. We also measure the relaxation\nand dephasing times of a qubit formed out of two two-electron states with\ndifferent spin and charge configurations.\n", "  Nanofabricated quantum bits permit large-scale integration but usually suffer\nfrom short coherence times due to interactions with their solid-state\nenvironment. The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that\nit minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability.\nHere we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si/SiGe\nquantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by\nresonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from\na local micromagnet, and the spin state is read out in single-shot mode.\nElectron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we\nattribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in\nsilicon, Ramsey and Hahn echo decay timescales of 1us and 40us, respectively,\nare observed. This is almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic\ntimescales in III-V quantum dots, while gate operation times are comparable to\nthose achieved in GaAs. This places the single-qubit rotations in the\nfault-tolerant regime and strongly raises the prospects of quantum information\nprocessing based on quantum dots.\n", "  We present a sample of 27 GRBs with detailed Swift light curves supplemented\nby late time Chandra observations. To answer the missing jet-break problem in\ngeneral, we develop a numerical simulation based model which can be directly\nfit to the data using Monte Carlo methods. Our numerical model takes into\naccount all the factors that can shape a jet-break: (i) lateral expansion (ii)\nedge effects and (iii) off-axis effects. Our results provide improved fits to\nthe light curves and constraints on physical parameters. More importantly, our\nresults suggest that off-axis effects are important and must be included in\ninterpretations of GRB jet breaks.\n", "  We report nonlinear behavior in the motion of driven nanowire cantilevers.\nThe nonlinearity can be described by the Duffing equation and is used to\ndemonstrate mechanical mixing of two distinct excitation frequencies.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity can be used to amplify a\nsignal at a frequency close to the mechanical resonance of the nanowire\noscillator. Up to 26 dB of amplitude gain are demonstrated in this way.\n", "  We establish some properties of the zeroes of sums and differences of\ncontiguous Bessel functions of the first kind. As a byproduct, we also prove\nthat the zeroes of the derivatives of Bessel functions of the first kind of\ndifferent orders are interlaced the same way as the zeroes of Bessel functions\nthemselves. As a physical motivation, we consider gated graphene nanodots\nsubject to Berry-Mondragon boundary conditions. We determine the allowed energy\nlevels and calculate the mean charge at zero temperature. We discuss in detail\nits dependence on the gate (chemical) potential.\n", "  The interplay between single-particle interference and quantum\nindistinguishability leads to signature correlations in many-body scattering.\nWe uncover these with a semiclassical calculation of the transmission\nprobabilities through mesoscopic cavities for systems of non-interacting\nparticles. For chaotic cavities we provide the universal form of the first two\nmoments of the transmission probabilities over ensembles of random unitary\nmatrices, including weak localization and dephasing effects. If the incoming\nmany-body state consists of two macroscopically occupied wavepackets, their\ntime delay drives a quantum-classical transition along a boundary determined by\nthe bosonic birthday paradox. Mesoscopic chaotic scattering of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates is then a realistic candidate to build a boson sampler and to\nobserve the macroscopic Hong-Ou-Mandel effect.\n", "  We compute classical gravitational bremsstrahlung from the gravitational\nscattering of two massless particles at leading order in the (center of mass)\ndeflection angle $\\theta\\sim 4 G \\sqrt{s}/b = 8 G E/b \\ll 1$. The calculation,\nalthough non-perturbative in the gravitational constant, is surprisingly simple\nand yields explicit formulae --in terms of multidimensional integrals-- for the\nfrequency and angular distribution of the radiation. In the range $ b^{-1} <\n\\omega < (GE)^{-1}$, the GW spectrum behaves like $ \\log (1/GE\\omega) d\n\\omega$, is confined to cones of angular sizes (around the deflected particle\ntrajectories) ranging from $O(\\theta)$ to $O(1/\\omega b)$, and exactly\nreproduces, at its lower end, a well-known zero-frequency limit.\n  At $\\omega > (GE)^{-1}$ the radiation is confined to cones of angular size of\norder $\\theta (GE\\omega)^{-1/2}$ resulting in a scale-invariant\n($d\\omega/\\omega$) spectrum. The total efficiency in GW production is dominated\nby this \"high frequency\" region and is formally logarithmically divergent in\nthe UV. If the spectrum is cutoff at the limit of validity of our\napproximations (where a conjectured bound on GW power is also saturated), the\nfraction of incoming energy radiated away turns out to be $\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\n\\theta ^2 \\log \\theta^{-2}$ at leading logarithmic accuracy.\n", "  In the case of vanishing cosmological constant, Demia\\'nski has shown that\nthe Janis-Newman algorithm can be generalized in order to include a NUT charge\nand another parameter $c$, in addition to the angular momentum. Moreover it was\nproved that only a NUT charge can be added for non-vanishing cosmological\nconstant. However despite the fact that the form of the coordinate\ntransformations was obtained, it was not explained how to perform the\ncomplexification on the metric function, and the procedure does not follow\ndirectly from the usual Janis-Newman rules. The goal of our paper is threefold:\nexplain the hidden assumptions of Demia\\'nski's analysis, generalize the\ncomputations to topological horizons (spherical and hyperbolic) and to charged\nsolutions, and explain how to perform the complexification of the function. In\nparticular we present a new solution which is an extension of the Demia\\'nski\nmetric to hyperbolic horizons. These different results open the door to\napplications in (gauged) supergravity since they allow for a systematic\napplication of the Demia\\'nski-Janis-Newman algorithm.\n", "  Leakage errors arise when the quantum state leaks out of some subspace of\ninterest, for example, the two-level subspace of a multi-level system defining\na computational `qubit' or the logical code space defined by some quantum\nerror-correcting code or decoherence-free subspace. Leakage errors pose a\ndistinct challenge to quantum control relative to the more well-studied\ndecoherence errors and can be a limiting factor to achieving fault-tolerant\nquantum computation. Here we present scalable and robust randomized\nbenchmarking protocols for quickly estimating the rates of both coherent and\nincoherent leakage, allowing for practical minimization of the leakage rate by\nvarying over control methods. We illustrate the reliability of the protocol\nthrough numerical simulations with physically-relevant error models.\n", "  Thermodynamic properties of ideal Bose gas trapped in an external generic\npower law potential are investigated systematically from the grand\nthermodynamic potential in $d$ dimensional space. The most general conditions\nfor Bose-Einstein condensate and the discontinuous conditions of heat capacity\nat the critical temperature in presence of generic power law potential are\npresented in this manuscript. The dependence of the physical quantities on\nexternal potential, particle characteristics and space dimensionality are\ndiscussed. The more general results obtained in this paper presents an unified\nillustration of Bose-Einstein condensation of ideal Bose systems as they\nreduces to the expressions and conclusions available in the literature with\nappropiate choice of power law exponent.\n", "  Average energy per fermion in case of Fermi gas with any kinematic\ncharacteristic, trapped under most general power law potential in $d$ dimension\nhas been calculated at zero temperature. In a previous paper (M. Acharyya, Eur.\nJ Phys. 31 L89 (2010)) it was shown, in case of free ideal Fermi gas as\ndimension increases average energy approaches to Fermi energy and in infinite\ndimension average energy becomes equal to Fermi energy at $T=0$. In this letter\nit is shown that, for trapped system at finite dimension the average energy\ndepends on power law exponent, but as dimension tends to infinity average\nenergy coincides with Fermi energy for any power law exponent. The result\nobtained in this manuscript is more general as we can describe free system as\nwell as any trapped system with appropriate choice of power law exponent and\ntrue for any kinematic parameter.\n", "  Thermodynamics of ideal Fermi gas trapped in an external generic power law\npotential $U=\\sum_{i=1} ^d c_i |\\frac{x_i}{a_i}|^{n_i}$ are investigated\nsystematically from the grand thermodynamic potential in $d$ dimensional space.\nThese properties are explored deeply in the degenerate limit ($\\mu>> K_BT$),\nwhere the thermodynamic properties are greatly dominated by Pauli exclusion\nprinciple. Pressure and energy along with the isothermal compressibilty is non\nzero at $T=0K$, denoting trapped Fermi system is quite live even at absolute\nzero temperature. The nonzero value of compressibilty denotes zero point\npressure is not just a constant but depends on volume.\n", "  We study the statistics of a tagged particle in single-file diffusion, a\none-dimensional interacting infinite-particle system in which the order of\nparticles never changes. We compute the two-time correlation function for the\ndisplacement of the tagged particle for an arbitrary single-file system. We\nalso discuss single-file analogs of the arcsine law and the law of the iterated\nlogarithm characterizing the behavior of Brownian motion. Using a macroscopic\nfluctuation theory we devise a formalism giving the cumulant generating\nfunctional. In principle, this functional contains the full statistics of the\ntagged particle trajectory---the full single-time statistics, all multiple-time\ncorrelation functions, etc. are merely special cases.\n", "  Triggered sources of entangled photons play crucial roles in almost any\nexisting protocol of quantum information science. The possibility to generate\nthese non-classical states of light with high speed and using electrical pulses\ncould revolutionize the field. Entangled-light-emitting-diodes (ELEDs) based on\nsemiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are at present the only devices that can\naddress this task 5. However, ELEDs are plagued by a source of randomness that\nhampers their practical exploitation in the foreseen applications: the very low\nprobability (~10-2) of finding QDs with sufficiently small\nfine-structure-splitting for entangled-photon-generation. Here, we overcome\nthis hurdle by introducing the first strain-tunable ELEDs (S-ELEDs) that\nexploit piezoelectric-induced strains to tune QDs for\nentangled-photon-generation. We demonstrate that up to 30% of the QDs in\nS-ELEDs emit polarization-entangled photon pairs with entanglement-fidelities\nas high as f+ = 0.83(5). Driven at the highest operation speed of 400 MHz ever\nreported so far, S-ELEDs emerge as unique devices for high-data rate\nentangled-photon applications.\n", "  Diffusion of impenetrable particles in a crowded one-dimensional channel is\nreferred as the single file diffusion. The particles do not pass each other and\nthe displacement of each individual particle is sub-diffusive. We analyse a\nsimple realization of this single file diffusion problem where one dimensional\nBrownian point particles interact only by hard-core repulsion. We show that the\nlarge deviation function which characterizes the displacement of a tracer at\nlarge time can be computed via a mapping to a problem of non-interacting\nBrownian particles. We confirm recently obtained results of the one time\ndistribution of the displacement and show how to extend them to the multi-time\ncorrelations. The probability distribution of the tracer position depends on\nwhether we take annealed or quenched averages. In the quenched case we notice\nan exact relation between the distribution of the tracer and the distribution\nof the current. This relation is in fact much more general and would be valid\nfor arbitrary single file diffusion. It allows in particular to get the full\nstatistics of the tracer position for the symmetric simple exclusion process\n(SSEP) at density 1/2 in the quenched case.\n", "  A novel approach to wall modeling for the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations including flows of moderate and large Reynolds numbers is presented.\nThe basic idea is that a problem-tailored function space allows prediction of\nturbulent boundary layer gradients with very coarse meshes. The proposed\nfunction space consists of a standard polynomial function space plus an\nenrichment, which is constructed using Spalding's law-of-the-wall. The\nenrichment function is not enforced but \"allowed\" in a consistent way and the\noverall methodology is much more general and also enables other enrichment\nfunctions. The proposed method is closely related to detached-eddy simulation\nas near-wall turbulence is modeled statistically and large eddies are resolved\nin the bulk flow. Interpreted in terms of a three-scale separation within the\nvariational multiscale method, the standard scale resolves large eddies and the\nenrichment scale represents boundary layer turbulence in an averaged sense. The\npotential of the scheme is shown applying it to turbulent channel flow of\nfriction Reynolds numbers from $Re_{\\tau}=590$ and up to $5,000$, flow over\nperiodic constrictions at the Reynolds numbers $Re_H=10,595$ and $19,000$ as\nwell as backward-facing step flow at $Re_h=5,000$, all with extremely coarse\nmeshes. Excellent agreement with experimental and DNS data is observed with the\nfirst grid point located at up to $y_1^+=500$ and especially under adverse\npressure gradients as well as in separated flows.\n", "  A unified description for the Bose and Fermi gases trapped in an external\ngeneric power law potential $U=\\sum_{i=1} ^d c_i |\\frac{x_i}{a_i}|^{n_i}$ is\npresented using the grandpotential of the system in $d$ dimensional space. The\nthermodynamic quantities of the quantum gases are derived from the grand\npotential. An equivalence between the trapped Bose and Fermi gases is\nconstructed in one dimension ($d=1$) using the Landen relation. It is also\nfound that the established equivalence between the ideal free Bose and Fermi\ngases in $d=2$ (M. H. Lee, Phys. Rev. E 55, 1518 (1997)) is lost when external\npotential is applied.\n", "  Hyperion-IID is a positron emission tomography (PET) insert which allows\nsimultaneous operation in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.\nTo read out the scintillation light of the employed LYSO crystal arrays with a\npitch of 1 mm pitch and 12 mm in height, digital silicon photomultipliers (DPC\n3200-22, Philips Digital Photon Counting) (DPC) are used. The basic PET\nperformance in terms of energy resolution, coincidence resolution time (CRT)\nand sensitivity as a function of operating parameters, such as the operating\ntemperature, the applied overvoltage, activity and configuration parameters of\nthe DPCs, were evaluated on system level. The measured energy resolution did\nnot show a large dependency on the selected parameters and is in the range of\n12.4-12.9% for low activities and degrades to ~13.6% at activities of ~100 MBq.\nThe CRT strongly depends on the selected trigger scheme (trig) of the DPCs. We\nmeasured approximately 260 ps, 440 ps, 540 ps and 1300 ps for trig 1-4,\nrespectively. The trues sensitivity for a NEMA NU 4 mouse-sized scatter phantom\nwith a 70-mm-long tube of activity was dependent on the operating parameters\nand was determined to be 0.4-1.4% at low activities. The random fraction stayed\nbelow 5% at activities up to 100 MBq and the scatter fraction was evaluated as\n~6% for an energy window of 411-561 keV and ~16% for 250-625 keV. Furthermore,\nwe performed imaging experiments using a mouse-sized hot-rod phantom and a\nlarge rabbit-sized phantom. In 2D slices of the reconstructed mouse-sized\nhot-rod phantom ({\\O} = 28 mm), the rods were distinguishable from each other\ndown to a rod size of 0.8 mm. There was no benefit of the better CRT of trig 1\nover trig 3, where in the larger rabbit-sized phantom ({\\O} = 114 mm), we could\nshow a clear improvement of image quality using the time-of-flight information.\n", "  We demonstrate how the physics of multiboson correlation interference leads\nto the computational complexity of linear optical interferometers based on\ncorrelation measurements in the degrees of freedom of the input bosons. In\nparticular, we address the task of MultiBoson Correlation Sampling (MBCS) from\nthe probability distribution associated with polarization- and time-resolved\ndetections at the output of random linear optical networks. We show that the\nMBCS problem is fundamentally hard to solve classically even for nonidentical\ninput photons, regardless of the color of the photons, making it also very\nappealing from an experimental point of view. These results fully manifest the\nquantum computational supremacy inherent to the fundamental nature of quantum\ninterference.\n", "  We outline a general perturbative method of evaluating scattering features of\nfinite-range complex potentials and use it to examine complex perturbations of\na rectangular barrier potential. In optics, these correspond to modulated\nrefractive index profiles of the form $n(x)=n_0+f(x)$, where $n_0$ is real,\n$f(x)$ is complex-valued, and $|f(x)|\\ll1\\leq n_0$. We give a comprehensive\ndescription of the phenomenon of unidirectional invisibility for such media,\nproving five general theorems on its realization in ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric and\nnon-${\\cal PT}$-symmetric material. In particular, we establish the\nimpossibility of unidirectional invisibility for ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric samples\nwhose refractive index has a constant real part and show how a simple scaling\ntransformation of a unidirectionally invisible ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric index\nprofile with $n_0=1$ may be used to generate a hierarchy of unidirectionally\ninvisible ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric index profiles with $n_0>1$. The results\npertaining unidirectional invisibility for $n_0>1$ open up the way for the\nexperimental studies of this phenomenon in a variety of active material. As an\napplication of our general results, we show that a medium with $n(x)=n_0+\\zeta\ne^{iK x}$, $\\zeta$ and $K$ real, and $|\\zeta|\\ll 1$ can support unidirectional\ninvisibility only for $n_0=1$. We then construct unidirectionally invisible\nindex profiles of the form $n(x)=n_0+\\sum_\\ell z_\\ell e^{iK_\\ell x}$, with\n$z_\\ell$ complex, $K_\\ell$ real, $|z_\\ell|\\ll 1$, and $n_0>1$.\n", "  Graphene decorated with 5d transitional metal atoms is predicted to exhibit\nmany intriguing properties; for example iridium adatoms are proposed to induce\na substantial topological gap in graphene. We extensively investigated the\nconductivity of single-layer graphene decorated with iridium deposited in\nultra-high vacuum at low temperature (7 K) as a function of Ir concentration,\ncarrier density, temperature, and annealing conditions. Our results are\nconsistent with the formation of Ir clusters of ~100 atoms at low temperature,\nwith each cluster donating a single electronic charge to graphene. Annealing\ngraphene increases the cluster size, reducing the doping and increasing the\nmobility. We do not observe any sign of an energy gap induced by spin-orbit\ncoupling, possibly due to the clustering of Ir.\n", "  We express the boundary conditions for TE and TM waves at the interfaces of\nan infinite planar slab of homogeneous metamaterial as certain point\ninteractions and use them to compute the transfer matrix of the system. This\nallows us to demonstrate the omnidirectional reflectionlessness of Veselago's\nslab for waves of arbitrary wavelength, reveal the translational and reflection\nsymmetry of this slab, explore the laser threshold condition and coherent\nperfect absorption for active negative-index metamaterials, introduce a point\ninteraction modeling phase-conjugation, determine the corresponding antilinear\ntransfer matrix, and offer a simple proof of the equivalence of Veselago's slab\nwith a pair of parallel phase-conjugating plates. We also study the connection\nbetween certain optical setups involving metamaterials and a class of\nPT-symmetric quantum systems defined on wedge-shape contours in the complex\nplane. This provides a physical interpretation for the latter.\n", "  Dispersive approach to quantum chromodynamics is applied to the assessment of\nhadronic contributions to electroweak observables. The employed approach merges\nthe corresponding perturbative input with intrinsically nonperturbative\nconstraints, which originate in the respective kinematic restrictions. The\nevaluated hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and to\nthe shift of the electromagnetic fine structure constant at the scale of Z\nboson mass conform with recent assessments of these quantities.\n", "  We analyze the effect of spin degree of freedom on fidelity decay and entropy\nproduction of a many-particle fermionic(bosonic) system in a mean-field,\nquenched by a random two-body interaction preserving many-particle spin $S$.\nThe system Hamiltonian is represented by embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble\n(EGOE) of random matrices (for time-reversal and rotationally invariant\nsystems) with one plus two-body interactions preserving $S$ for\nfermions/bosons. EGOE are paradigmatic models to study the dynamical transition\nfrom integrability to chaos in interacting many-body quantum systems. A simple\ngeneral picture, in which the variances of the eigenvalue density play a\ncentral role, is obtained for describing the short-time dynamics of fidelity\ndecay and entropy production. Using some approximations, an EGOE formula for\nthe time ($t_{sat}$) for the onset of saturation of entropy, is also derived.\nThese analytical EGOE results are in good agreement with numerical\ncalculations. Moreover, both fermion and boson systems show significant spin\ndependence on the relaxation dynamics of the fidelity and entropy.\n", "  We investigate the properties of quantum radiation produced by a uniformly\naccelerating charged particle undergoing thermal random motions, which\noriginates from the coupling to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic\nfield. Because the thermal random motions are regarded to result from the Unruh\neffect, this quantum radiation is termed Unruh radiation. The energy flux of\nUnruh radiation is negative and smaller than that of Larmor radiation by one\norder in a/m, where a is the constant acceleration and m is the mass of the\nparticle. Thus, the Unruh radiation appears to be a suppression of the\nclassical Larmor radiation. The quantum interference effect plays an important\nrole in this unique signature. The results is consistent with the predictions\nof a model consisting of a particle coupled to a massless scalar field as well\nas those of the previous studies on the quantum effect on the Larmor radiation.\n", "  We explore the potential of using intensity mapping surveys (MeerKAT, SKA)\nand optical galaxy surveys (DES, LSST) to detect HI clustering and weak\ngravitational lensing of 21cm emission in auto- and cross-correlation. Our\nforecasts show that high precision measurements of the clustering and lensing\nsignals can be made in the near future using the intensity mapping technique.\nSuch studies can be used to test the intensity mapping method, and constrain\nparameters such as the HI density $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$, the HI bias $b_{\\rm HI}$\nand the galaxy-HI correlation coefficient $r_{\\rm HI-g}$.\n", "  We present a detailed study of magnetoresistance \\r{ho}xx(H), Hall effect\n\\r{ho}xy(H), and electrolyte gating effect in thin (<100 nm) exfoliated\ncrystals of WTe2. We observe quantum oscillations in H of both \\r{ho}xx(H) and\n\\r{ho}xy(H), and identify four oscillation frequencies consistent with previous\nreports in thick crystals. \\r{ho}xy(H) is linear in H at low H consistent with\nnear-perfect electron-hole compensation, however becomes nonlinear and changes\nsign with increasing H, implying a breakdown of compensation. A field-dependent\nratio of carrier concentrations p/n can consistently explain \\r{ho}xx(H) and\n\\r{ho}xy(H) within a two-fluid model. We also employ an electrolytic gate to\nhighly electron-dope WTe2 with Li. The non-saturating \\r{ho}xx(H) persists to H\n= 14 T with magnetoresistance ratio exceeding 2 x 104 %, even with significant\ndeviation from perfect electron-hole compensation (p/n = 0.84), where the\ntwo-fluid model predicts a saturating \\r{ho}xx(H). Our results suggest\nelectron-hole compensation is not the mechanism for extremely large\nmagnetoresistance in WTe2, other alternative explanations need to be\nconsidered.\n", "  Intensity mapping of the neutral hydrogen brightness temperature promises to\nprovide a three-dimensional view of the universe on very large scales.\nNonlinear effects are typically thought to alter only the small-scale power,\nbut we show how they may bias the extraction of cosmological information\ncontained in the power spectrum on ultra-large scales. For linear perturbations\nto remain valid on large scales, we need to renormalize perturbations at higher\norder. In the case of intensity mapping, the second-order contribution to\nclustering from weak lensing dominates the nonlinear contribution at high\nredshift. Renormalization modifies the mean brightness temperature and\ntherefore the evolution bias. It also introduces a term that mimics white\nnoise. These effects may influence forecasting analysis on ultra-large scales.\n", "  The well known relation for ideal classical gas $\\Delta \\epsilon^2=kT^2 C_V$\nwhich does not remain valid for quantum system is revisited. A new connection\nis established between energy fluctuation and specific heat for quantum gases,\nvalid in the classical limit and the degenerate quantum regime as well. Most\nimportantly the proposed Biswas-Mitra-Bhattacharyya (BMB) conjecture (Biswas\n$et.$ $al.$, J. Stat. Mech. P03013, 2015.) relating hump in energy fluctuation\nand discontinuity of specific heat is proved and precised in this manuscript.\n", "  We report canonical and grand-canonical lattice Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe self-assembly of addressable structures comprising hundreds of distinct\ncomponent types. The nucleation behaviour, in the form of free-energy barriers\nto nucleation, changes significantly as the co-ordination number of the\nbuilding blocks is changed from 4 to 8 to 12. Unlike tetrahedral structures -\nwhich roughly correspond to DNA bricks that have been studied in experiment -\nthe shapes of the free-energy barriers of higher co-ordination structures\ndepend strongly on the supersaturation, and such structures require a very\nsignificant driving force for structure growth before nucleation becomes\nthermally accessible. Although growth at high supersaturation results in more\ndefects during self-assembly, we show that high co-ordination number structures\ncan still be assembled successfully in computer simulations and that they\nexhibit self-assembly behaviour analogous to DNA bricks. In particular, the\nself-assembly remains modular, enabling in principle a wide variety of\nnanostructures to be assembled, with a greater spatial resolution than is\npossible in low co-ordination structures.\n", "  In recent times, we experimentally realized a quite efficient modeling of the\nshape of diffraction-resistant optical beams; thus generating for the first\ntime the so-called Frozen Waves (FW), whose longitudinal intensity pattern can\nbe arbitrarily chosen, within a prefixed space interval of the propagation\naxis. Such waves possess a host of potential applications: in medicine,\nbiomedical optics, optical tweezers, atom guiding, remote sensing, tractor\nbeams, optical communications or metrology, and other topics in photonic areas.\nIn this work, we extend our theory of FWs -- which led to beams endowed with a\nstatic envelope -- through a dynamic modeling of the FWs, whose shape is now\nallowed to evolve in time in a predetermined way. And we experimentally create\nsuch dynamic FWs in Optics, via a computational holographic technique and a\nspatial light modulator. Experimental results are here presented for two cases\nof dynamic FWs, one of the zeroth and the other of higher order, the last one\nbeing the most interesting, consisting in a cylindrical surface of light whose\ngeometry changes in space and time.\n", "  We introduce a model of adaptive temporal networks whose evolution is\nregulated by an interplay between node activity and dynamic exchange of\ninformation through links. We study the model by using a master equation\napproach. Starting from a homogeneous initial configuration, we show that\ntemporal and structural heterogeneities, characteristic of real-world networks,\nspontaneously emerge. This theoretically tractable model thus contributes to\nthe understanding of the dynamics of human activity and interaction networks.\n", "  Quantifying the similarity between symbolic sequences is a traditional\nproblem in Information Theory which requires comparing the frequencies of\nsymbols in different sequences. In numerous modern applications, ranging from\nDNA over music to texts, the distribution of symbol frequencies is\ncharacterized by heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Zipf's law). The large\nnumber of low-frequency symbols in these distributions poses major difficulties\nto the estimation of the similarity between sequences, e.g., they hinder an\naccurate finite-size estimation of entropies. Here we show analytically how the\nsystematic (bias) and statistical (fluctuations) errors in these estimations\ndepend on the sample size~$N$ and on the exponent~$\\gamma$ of the heavy-tailed\ndistribution. Our results are valid for the Shannon entropy $(\\alpha=1)$, its\ncorresponding similarity measures (e.g., the Jensen-Shanon divergence), and\nalso for measures based on the generalized entropy of order $\\alpha$. For small\n$\\alpha$'s, including $\\alpha=1$, the errors decay slower than the $1/N$-decay\nobserved in short-tailed distributions. For $\\alpha$ larger than a critical\nvalue $\\alpha^* = 1+1/\\gamma \\leq 2$, the $1/N$-decay is recovered. We show the\npractical significance of our results by quantifying the evolution of the\nEnglish language over the last two centuries using a complete $\\alpha$-spectrum\nof measures. We find that frequent words change more slowly than less frequent\nwords and that $\\alpha=2$ provides the most robust measure to quantify language\nchange.\n", "  The extreme extragalactic sources known as Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULX)\nrepresent a unique testing environment for compact objects population studies\nand the accretion process. Their nature has long been disputed. Their\nluminosity, well above the Eddington luminosity for a stellar-mass black hole,\ncan imply the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole or a stellar black\nhole accreting above the Eddington limit. Both these interpretations are\nimportant to understand better the accretion process and the evolution of\nmassive black holes. The last few years have seen a dramatic improvement of our\nknowledge of these sources. In particular, the super-Eddington interpretation\nfor the bulk of the ULX population has gained a strong consensus. Nonetheless,\nexceptions to this general trend do exist, and in particular one ULX was shown\nto be a neutron star, and another was shown to be a very likely IMBH candidate.\nIn this paper, I will review the progress done in the last few years.\n", "  We report on a \"source-sink\" algorithm which allows one to calculate\ntime-resolved physical quantities from a general nanoelectronic quantum system\n(described by an arbitrary time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian) connected to\ninfinite electrodes. Although mathematically equivalent to the non equilibrium\nGreen's function formalism, the approach is based on the scattering wave\nfunctions of the system. It amounts to solving a set of generalized\nSchr\\\"odinger equations which include an additional \"source\" term (coming from\nthe time dependent perturbation) and an absorbing \"sink\" term (the electrodes).\nThe algorithm execution time scales linearly with both system size and\nsimulation time allowing one to simulate large systems (currently around $10^6$\ndegrees of freedom) and/or large times (currently around $10^5$ times the\nsmallest time scale of the system). As an application we calculate the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of a Josephson junction for both short and long\njunctions, and recover the multiple Andreev reflexion (MAR) physics. We also\ndiscuss two intrinsically time-dependent situations: the relaxation time of a\nJosephson junction after a quench of the voltage bias, and the propagation of\nvoltage pulses through a Josephson junction. In the case of a ballistic, long\nJosephson junction, we predict that a fast voltage pulse creates an oscillatory\ncurrent whose frequency is controlled by the Thouless energy of the normal\npart. A similar effect is found for short junctions, a voltage pulse produces\nan oscillating current which, in the absence of electromagnetic environment,\ndoes not relax.\n", "  Virtual two-loop corrections to scattering amplitudes are a key ingredient to\nprecision physics at collider experiments. We compute the full set of planar\nmaster integrals relevant to five-point functions in massless QCD, and use\nthese to derive an analytical expression for the two-loop five-gluon\nall-plus-helicity amplitude. After subtracting terms that are related to the\nuniversal infrared and ultraviolet pole structure, we obtain a remarkably\nsimple and compact finite remainder function, consisting only of dilogarithms.\n", "  We report on room-temperature Raman scattering measurements in few-layer\ncrystals of exfoliated molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe$_{2}$) performed with the\nuse of 632.8 nm (1.96 eV) laser light excitation. In agreement with recent\nstudy reported by G. Froehlicher et al, (2015 $Nano$ $Lett.$ 15 6481) we\nobserve a complex structure of the out-of-plane vibrational modes\n(A$_{1g}$/A$^{'}_{1}$), which can be explained in terms of interlayer\ninteractions between single atomic planes of MoTe$_{2}$. In the case of\nlow-energy shear and breathing modes of rigid interlayer vibrations it is shown\nthat their energy evolution with the number of layers can be well reproduced\nwithin a linear chain model with only the nearest neighbor interaction taken\ninto account. Based on this model the corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane\nforce constants are determined. We also show that the Raman scattering in\nMoTe$_{2}$ measured using 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) laser light excitation results in\nmuch simpler spectra. We argue that the rich structure of the out-of-plane\nvibrational modes observed in Raman scattering spectra excited with the use of\n632.8 nm laser light results from its resonance with the electronic transition\nat the M or K points of the MoTe$_{2}$ first Brillouin zone.\n", "  Energy fluctuation of ideal Fermi gas trapped under generic power law\npotential $U=\\sum_{i=1} ^d c_i |\\frac{x_i}{a_i}|^{n_i}$ have been calculated in\narbitrary dimension. Energy fluctuation is scrutinized further in the\ndegenerate limit $\\mu>> K_BT$ with the help of Sommerfeld expansion. The\ndependence of energy fluctuation on dimensionality and power law potential is\nstudied in detail. Most importantly our general result can exactly reproduce\nthe recently published result regarding free and harmonically trapped ideal\nFermi gas in d=3 (S Biswas, J Mitra, S Bhattacharyya, J. Stat. Mech. P03013,\n2015.)\n", "  The Loschmidt echo -- also known as fidelity -- is a very useful tool to\nstudy irreversibility in quantum mechanics due to perturbations or\nimperfections. Many different regimes, as a function of time and strength of\nthe perturbation, have been identified. For chaotic systems, there is a range\nof perturbation strengths where the decay of the Loschmidt echo is perturbation\nindependent, and given by the classical Lyapunov exponent. But observation of\nthe Lyapunov decay depends strongly on the type of initial state upon which an\naverage is done. This dependence can be removed by averaging the fidelity over\nthe Haar measure, and the Lyapunov regime is recovered, as it was shown for\nquantum maps. In this work we introduce an analogous quantity for systems with\ninfinite dimensional Hilbert space, in particular the quantum stadium billiard,\nand we show clearly the universality of the Lyapunov regime.\n", "  We consider the Grover search algorithm implementation for a quantum register\nof size $N = 2^k$ using k (or k +1) microwave- and laser-driven\nRydberg-blockaded atoms, following the proposal by M{\\o}lmer, Isenhower, and\nSaffman [J. Phys. B 44, 184016 (2011)]. We suggest some simplifications for the\nmicrowave and laser couplings, and analyze the performance of the algorithm for\nup to k = 4 multilevel atoms under realistic experimental conditions using\nquantum stochastic (Monte-Carlo) wavefunction simulations.\n", "  The matrix-generalized Bogoliubov-de Gennes systems have recently been\nconsidered by the present author [arXiv:1509.04242, Phys. Rev. B 93, 024512\n(2016)], and time-dependent and self-consistent multi-soliton solutions have\nbeen constructed based on the ansatz method. In this paper, restricting the\nproblem to the static case, we exhaustively determine the self-consistent\nsolutions using the inverse scattering theory. Solving the gap equation, we\nrigorously prove that the self-consistent potential must be reflectionless. As\na supplementary topic, we elucidate the relation between the stationary\nself-consistent potentials and the soliton solutions in the matrix nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Asymptotic formulae of multi-soliton solutions for\nsufficiently isolated solitons are also presented.\n", "  We present an update of the determination of the solar neutrino fluxes from a\nglobal analysis of the solar and terrestrial neutrino data in the framework of\nthree-neutrino mixing. Using a Bayesian analysis we reconstruct the posterior\nprobability distribution function for the eight normalization parameters of the\nsolar neutrino fluxes plus the relevant masses and mixing, with and without\nimposing the luminosity constraint. We then use these results to compare the\ndescription provided by different Standard Solar Models. Our results show that,\nat present, both models with low and high metallicity can describe the data\nwith equivalent statistical agreement. We also argue that even with the present\nexperimental precision the solar neutrino data have the potential to improve\nthe accuracy of the solar model predictions.\n", "  A filament eruption was observed on October 31, 2010 in the images recorded\nby the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic\nObservatory (SDO) in its Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) channels. The filament\nshowed a slow rise phase followed by a fast rise and was classified to be an\nasymmetric eruption. In addition, multiple localized brightening which was\nspatially and temporally associated with the slow rise phase were identified\nleading us to believe that the tether-cutting mechanism to be the cause of the\ninitiation of the eruption. An associated flux rope was detected in high\ntemperature channels of AIA namely 94\\r{A} and 131\\r{A} corresponding to 7 MK\nand 11 MK plasma respectively. In addition, these channels are also sensitive\nto cooler plasma corresponding to ~1-2 MK. In this study we have applied the\nalgorithm devised by Warren et al. (2012) to remove cooler emission from the\n94\\r{A} channel to deduce only the high temperature structure of the flux rope\nand to study its temporal evolution. We found that the flux rope was very\nclearly seen in clean 94\\r{A} channel image corresponding to Fe XVIII emission\nwhich corresponds to a plasma at a temperature of 7 MK. This temperature\nmatched well with that obtained using DEM analysis. This study provides\nimportant constrains in the modelling of the thermodynamic structure of the\nflux ropes in CMEs.\n", "  Classical nucleation theory offers a good framework for understanding the\ncommon features of new phase formation processes in metastable homogeneous\nmedia at rest. However, nucleation processes in liquids are ubiquitously\naffected by hydrodynamic flow, and there is no satisfactory understanding of\nwhether shear promotes or slows down the nucleation process. We developed a\nclassical nucleation theory for sheared systems starting from the molecular\nlevel of the Becker-Doering master kinetic equation and we analytically derived\na closed-form expression for the nucleation rate. The theory accounts for the\neffect of flow-mediated transport of molecules to the nucleus of the new phase,\nas well as for the mechanical deformation imparted to the nucleus by the flow\nfield. The competition between flow-induced molecular transport, which\naccelerates nucleation, and flow-induced nucleus straining, which lowers the\nnucleation rate by increasing the nucleation energy barrier, gives rise to a\nmarked nonmonotonic dependence of the nucleation rate on the shear rate. The\ntheory predicts an optimal shear rate at which the nucleation rate is one order\nof magnitude larger than in the absence of flow.\n", "  The recently introduced relativistic Lagrangian darkon fluid model (EPJ C\n(2015) 75:9) is generalized to a self-gravitating, irrotational, pressure-less\nand stress free geodesic fluid, whose energy-momentum tensor is dust-like with\nnontrivial energy flow, defining the general framework for our cosmological\nmodel. In the present paper we consider only the averaged dynamics of the\nUniverse at very large scales, allowing us to work with conformal flat\ngeometry. The corresponding covariant propagation and constraint equations are\ntreated in a shear-free nonrelativistic limit. The dynamics is described with a\nLagrangian in minisuperspace. Analytic solutions for the energy density, the\nHubble function and the 1st order relativistic correction to the spatial\ncurvature are obtained by means of two conditional dynamical symmetries. This\nleads to a cosmological model where the accelerated expansion of the Universe\nis driven by a time-dependent spatial curvature without the need for\nintroducing any kind of dark energy. A differential equation for the area\ndistance is derived in addition.\n", "  Motivated by the recent LHC observation of an excess of diphoton events\naround an invariant mass of 750 GeV, we discuss the possibility that this is\ndue to the decay of a new scalar or pseudoscalar resonance dominantly produced\nvia photon-photon fusion. We present a precise calculation of the corresponding\nphoton-photon luminosity in the inclusive and exclusive scenarios, and\ndemonstrate that the theoretical uncertainties associated with these are small.\nIn the inclusive channel, we show how simple cuts on the final state may help\nto isolate the photon-photon induced cross section from any gluon-gluon or\nvector boson fusion induced contribution. In the exclusive case, that is where\nboth protons remain intact after the collision, we present a precise cross\nsection evaluation and show how this mode is sensitive to the parity of the\nobject, as well as potential $CP$-violating effects. We also comment on the\ncase of heavy-ion collisions and consider the production of new heavy\ncolourless fermions, which may couple to such a resonance.\n", "  We show how the same set-up and procedure, exploiting spatially multi-mode\nquantum correlations, allows the absolute calibration of a EMCCD camera from\nthe analog regime down to the single photon counting level, just by adjusting\nthe brightness of the quantum source. At single photon level EMCCD can be\noperated as an on-off detector, where quantum efficiency depends on the\ndiscriminating threshold. We develop a simple model to explain the connection\nof the two different regime demonstrating that the efficiency estimated in the\nanalog (bright) regime allows to accurately predict the detector behaviour in\nthe photo-counting regime and vice-versa. This work establishes a bridge\nbetween two regions of the optical measurements that up to now have been based\non completely different standards, detectors and measurement techniques.\n", "  This review is devoted to the problem of thermalization in a small isolated\nconglomerate of interacting constituents. A variety of physically important\nsystems of intensive current interest belong to this category: complex atoms,\nmolecules (including biological molecules), nuclei, small devices of condensed\nmatter and quantum optics on nano- and micro-scale, cold atoms in optical\nlattices, ion traps. Physical implementations of quantum computers, where there\nare many interacting qubits, also fall into this group. Statistical\nregularities come into play through inter-particle interactions, which have two\nfundamental components: mean field, that along with external conditions, forms\nthe regular component of the dynamics, and residual interactions responsible\nfor the complex structure of the actual stationary states. At sufficiently high\nlevel density, the stationary states become exceedingly complicated\nsuperpositions of simple quasiparticle excitations. At this stage, regularities\ntypical of quantum chaos emerge and bring in signatures of thermalization. We\ndescribe all the stages and the results of the processes leading to\nthermalization, using analytical and massive numerical examples for realistic\natomic, nuclear, and spin systems, as well as for models with random\nparameters. The structure of stationary states, strength functions of simple\nconfigurations, and concepts of entropy and temperature in application to\nisolated mesoscopic systems are discussed in detail. We conclude with a\nschematic discussion of the time evolution of such systems to equilibrium.\n", "  We prove the universality for the eigenvalue gap statistics in the bulk of\nthe spectrum for band matrices, in the regime where the band width is\ncomparable with the dimension of the matrix, $W\\sim N$. All previous results\nconcerning universality of non-Gaussian random matrices are for mean-field\nmodels. By relying on a new mean-field reduction technique, we deduce\nuniversality from quantum unique ergodicity for band matrices.\n", "  Once in its non-equilibrium steady state, a nanoscale system coupled to\nseveral heat baths may be thought-of as a quantum heat pump. Depending on the\ndirection of its stationary heat flows it may function as e.g. a refrigerator\nor a heat transformer. These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex\nmultipartite systems, and yet their working principle is always the same: They\nare made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As\na result, it is possible to devise external black-box testing strategies to\nlearn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal\ndetails. In particular, one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a\ntwo-level spin to one of its contact transitions. The steady state of this\nexternal probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and\ninternal dissipation in the device, and also, about the direction of its\nsteady-state heat currents. Provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump\nis low, one can further estimate its coefficient of performance. These\ntechniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal\nengineering, as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of\ncomplex thermodynamic cycles.\n", "  Using non-equilibrium Green's functions combined with many-body perturbation\ntheory, we have calculated steady-state densities and currents through short\ninteracting chains subject to a finite electric bias. By using a steady-state\nreverse-engineering procedure, the effective potential and bias which reproduce\nsuch densities and currents in a non-interacting system have been determined.\nThe role of the effective bias is characterised with the aid of the so-called\nexchange-correlation bias, recently introduced in a steady-state\ndensity-functional-theory formulation for partitioned systems. We find that the\neffective bias (or, equivalently, the exchange-correlation bias) depends\nstrongly on the interaction strength and the length of the central (chain)\nregion. Moreover, it is rather sensitive to the level of many-body\napproximation used. Our study shows the importance of the\neffective/exchange-correlation bias out of equilibrium, thereby offering hints\non how to improve the description of density-functional-theory based approaches\nto quantum transport.\n", "  Parity-time ($\\cal PT$) symmetric lasers have attracted considerable\nattention lately due to their promising applications and intriguing properties,\nsuch as free spectral range doubling and single-mode lasing. In this work we\ndiscuss nonlinear modal interactions in these laser systems under steady state\nconditions, and we demonstrate that several gain clamping scenarios can occur\nfor lasing operation in the $\\cal PT$-symmetric and $\\cal PT$-broken phases. In\nparticular, we show that, depending on the system's design and the external\npump profile, its operation in the nonlinear regime falls into two different\ncategories: in one the system is frozen in the $\\cal PT$ phase space as the\napplied gain increases, while in the other the system is pulled towards its\nexceptional point. These features are first illustrated by a coupled mode\nformalism and later verified by employing the Steady-state Ab-initio Laser\nTheory (SALT). Our findings shine light on the robustness of single-mode\noperation in these lasers against saturation nonlinearity in $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric lasers.\n", "  In recent years scholars have built maps of science by connecting the\nacademic fields that cite each other, are cited together, or that cite a\nsimilar literature. But since scholars cannot always publish in the fields they\ncite, or that cite them, these science maps are only rough proxies for the\npotential of a scholar, organization, or country, to enter a new academic\nfield. Here we use a large dataset of scholarly publications disambiguated at\nthe individual level to create a map of science-or research space-where links\nconnect pairs of fields based on the probability that an individual has\npublished in both of them. We find that the research space is a significantly\nmore accurate predictor of the fields that individuals and organizations will\nenter in the future than citation based science maps. At the country level,\nhowever, the research space and citations based science maps are equally\naccurate. These findings show that data on career trajectories-the set of\nfields that individuals have previously published in-provide more accurate\npredictors of future research output for more focalized units-such as\nindividuals or organizations-than citation based science maps.\n", "  We discuss in detail the formation and propagation of multi-strangeness\nparticles in reactions induced by hadron beams relevant for the forthcoming\nexperiments at FAIR. We focus the discussion on the production of the\ndecuplet-particle $\\Omega$ and study for the first time the production and\npropagation mechanism of this heavy hyperon inside hadronic environments. The\ntransport calculations show the possibility of $\\Omega$-production in the\nforthcoming \\panda-experiment, which can be achieved with measurable\nprobabilities using high-energy secondary $\\Xi$-beams. We predict cross\nsections for $\\Omega$-production. The theoretical results are important in\nunderstanding the hyperon-nucleon and, in particular, the hyperon-hyperon\ninteractions also in the high-strangeness sector. We emphasize the importance\nof our studies for the research plans at FAIR.\n", "  We point out the several experimental manifestations of the new reflective\nscattering mode in elastic scattering and multiparticle production at the LHC\nenergy range.\n", "  Microquasars are stellar-mass black holes accreting matter from a companion\nstar and ejecting plasma jets at almost the speed of light. They are analogues\nof quasars that contain supermassive black holes of $10^6$ to $10^{10}$ solar\nmasses. Accretion in microquasars varies on much shorter timescales than in\nquasars and occasionally produces exceptionally bright X-ray flares. How the\nflares are produced is unclear, as is the mechanism for launching the\nrelativistic jets and their composition. An emission line near 511\nkiloelectronvolts has long been sought in the emission spectrum of microquasars\nas evidence for the expected electron-positron plasma. Transient high-energy\nspectral features have been reported in two objects, but their positron\ninterpretation remains contentious. Here we report observations of $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from the microquasar V404 Cygni during a recent period of strong\nflaring activity. The emission spectrum around 511 kiloelectronvolts shows\nclear signatures of variable positron annihilation, which implies a high rate\nof positron production. This supports the earlier conjecture that microquasars\nmay be the main sources of the electron-positron plasma responsible for the\nbright diffuse emission of annihilation $\\gamma$-rays in the bulge region of\nour Galaxy. Additionally, microquasars could be the origin of the observed\nmegaelectronvolt continuum excess in the inner Galaxy.\n", "  In this paper we address the problem of systems under an external feedback.\nThis is performed using a large deviation approach and rate distortion from\ninformation theory. In particular we define a lower boundary for the maximum\nentropy reduction that can be obtained using a feedback apparatus with a well\ndefined accuracy in terms of measurement of the state of the system. The large\ndeviation approach allows also to define a new set of potentials, including\ninformation, which similarly to more conventional thermodynamic potentials can\ndefine the state with optimal use of the information given the accuracy of the\nfeedback apparatus.\n", "  We show that an interplay of double exchange and impurity randomness can\nexplain the competition between metal-ferromagnetic and insulating charge\nordered states in doped manganites. The double exchange is simplified in the\nIsing type, whereas the randomness is modeled by the Falicov-Kimball binary\ndistribution. The combined model is considered in a framework of dynamical\nmean-field theory. Using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, the transport\ncoefficients are explicitly expressed in terms of single particle spectral\nfunctions. Dividing the system into two sublattices we have pointed out a\ndirect calculation to the checkerboard charge order parameter and the\nmagnetizations. Numerical results show us that the checkerboard charge order\ncan settle inside the ferromagnetic state at low temperature. An\ninsulator-metal transition is also found at the point of the checkerboard\ncharge order-ferromagnetic transition.\n", "  Strong repelling interactions between a few fermions or bosons confined in\ntwo-dimensional circular traps lead to particle localization and formation of\nquantum Wigner molecules (QWMs) possessing definite point-group space\nsymmetries. These point-group symmetries are \"hidden\" (or emergent), namely\nthey cannot be traced in the circular single-particle densities (SPDs)\nassociated with the exact many-body wave functions, but they are manifested as\ncharacteristic signatures in the ro-vibrational spectra. An example, among\nmany, are the few-body QWM states under a high magnetic field or at fast\nrotation, which are precursor states for the fractional quantum Hall effect.\nThe hidden geometric symmetries can be directly revealed by using spin-resolved\nconditional probability distributions, which are extracted from\nconfiguration-interaction (CI), exact-diagonalization wave functions. The\nhidden symmetries can also be revealed in the CI SPDs by reducing the symmetry\nof the trap (from circular to elliptic to quasi-linear). In addition the hidden\nsymmetries are directly connected to the explicitly broken-symmetry (BS)\nsolutions of mean-field approaches, such as unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). A\ncompanion step of restoration of the broken symmetries via projection operators\napplied on the BS-UHF solutions produces wave functions directly comparable to\nthe CI ones, and sheds further light into the role played by the emergence of\nhidden symmetries in the exact many-body wave functions. Illustrative examples\nof the importance of hidden symmetries in the many-body problem of few\nelectrons in semiconductor quantum dots and of few ultracold atoms in optical\ntraps (where unprecedented control of the interparticle interaction has been\nexperimentally achieved recently) will be presented.\n", "  We classify insulators by generalized symmetries that combine space-time\ntransformations with quasimomentum translations. Our group-cohomological\nclassification generalizes the nonsymmorphic space groups, which extend point\ngroups by real-space translations, i.e., nonsymmorphic symmetries unavoidably\ntranslate the spatial origin by a fraction of the lattice period. Here, we\nfurther extend nonsymmorphic groups by reciprocal translations, thus placing\nreal and quasimomentum space on equal footing. We propose that group cohomology\nprovides a symmetry-based classification of quasimomentum manifolds, which in\nturn determines the band topology. In this sense, cohomology underlies band\ntopology. Our claim is exemplified by the first theory of\ntime-reversal-invariant insulators with nonsymmorphic spatial symmetries. These\ninsulators may be described as 'piecewise topological', in the sense that\nsubtopologies describe the different high-symmetry submanifolds of the\nBrillouin zone, and the various subtopologies must be pieced together to form a\nglobally consistent topology. The subtopologies that we discovered include: a\nglide-symmetric analog of the quantum spin Hall effect, an hourglass-flow\ntopology (exemplified by our recently-proposed KHgSb material class), and\nquantized non-Abelian polarizations. Our cohomological classification results\nin an atypical bulk-boundary correspondence for our topological insulators.\n", "  The lifetime of the hypertriton $\\isotope[3][\\Lambda]{H}$ has been recently\nmeasured as significantly shorter than that of the free $\\Lambda$. We present\nan explanation based on a change of the intrinsic hyperon decay due to the\nnuclear environment.\n", "  The classical continuum models used for the woven fabrics do not fully\ndescribe the whole set of phenomena that occur during the testing of those\nmaterials. This incompleteness is partially due to the absence of energy terms\nrelated to some micro-structural properties of the fabric and, in particular,\nto the bending stiffness of the yarns. To account for the most fundamental\nmicrostructure-related deformation mechanisms occurring in unbalanced\ninterlocks, a second-gradient, hyperelastic, initially orthotropic continuum\nmodel is proposed.\n  A constitutive expression for the strain energy density is introduced to\naccount for i) in-plane shear deformations, ii) highly different bending\nstiffnesses in the warp and weft directions and iii) fictive elongations in the\nwarp and weft directions which eventually describe the relative sliding of the\nyarns. Numerical simulations which are able to reproduce the experimental\nbehavior of unbalanced carbon interlocks subjected to a Bias Extension Test are\npresented. In particular, the proposed model captures the macroscopic\nasymmetric S-shaped deformation of the specimen, as well as the main features\nof the associated deformation patterns of the yarns at the mesoscopic scale.\n", "  Phase-locked ultrashort pulses in the rich terahertz (THz) spectral range\nhave provided key insights into phenomena as diverse as quantum confinement,\nfirst-order phase transitions, high-temperature superconductivity, and carrier\ntransport in nanomaterials. Ultrabroadband electro-optic sampling of few-cycle\nfield transients can even reveal novel dynamics that occur faster than a single\noscillation cycle of light. However, conventional THz spectroscopy is\nintrinsically restricted to ensemble measurements by the diffraction limit. As\na result, it measures dielectric functions averaged over the size, structure,\norientation and density of nanoparticles, nanocrystals or nanodomains. Here, we\nextend ultrabroadband time-resolved THz spectroscopy (20 - 50 THz) to the\nsub-nanoparticle scale (10 nm) by combining sub-cycle, field-resolved detection\n(10 fs) with scattering-type near-field scanning optical microscopy (s-NSOM).\nWe trace the time-dependent dielectric function at the surface of a single\nphotoexcited InAs nanowire in all three spatial dimensions and reveal the\nultrafast ($<$50 fs) formation of a local carrier depletion layer.\n", "  Long regarded as a model system for studying insulator-to-metal phase\ntransitions, the correlated electron material vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is now\nfinding novel uses in device applications. Two of its most appealing aspects\nare its accessible transition temperature ($\\sim$341 K) and its rich phase\ndiagram. Strain can be used to selectively stabilize different VO$_2$\ninsulating phases by tuning the competition between electron and lattice\ndegrees of freedom. It can even break the mesoscopic spatial symmetry of the\ntransition, leading to a quasi-periodic ordering of insulating and metallic\nnanodomains. Nanostructuring of strained VO$_2$ could potentially yield unique\ncomponents for future devices. However, the most spectacular property of VO$_2$\n- its ultrafast transition - has not yet been studied on the length scale of\nits phase heterogeneity. Here, we use ultrafast near-field microscopy in the\nmid-infrared to study individual, strained VO$_2$ nanobeams on the 10 nm scale.\nWe reveal a previously unseen correlation between the local steady-state\nswitching susceptibility and the local ultrafast response to below-threshold\nphotoexcitation. These results suggest that it may be possible to tailor the\nlocal photo-response of VO$_2$ using strain and thereby realize new types of\nultrafast nano-optical devices.\n", "  A new Taylor-Couette system has been designed and constructed with precise\ntemperature control. Two concentric independently rotating cylinders are able\nto rotate at maximum rates of $f_i = \\pm20$ Hz for the inner cylinder and $f_o\n= \\pm10$ Hz for the outer cylinder. The inner cylinder has an outside radius of\n$r_i = 75$ mm, and the outer cylinder has an inside radius of $r_o = 105$ mm,\nresulting in a gap of $d=30$ mm. The height of the gap $L =549$ mm, giving a\nvolume of $V=9.3$l. The geometric parameters are $\\eta = r_i/r_o = 0.714$ and\n$\\Gamma = L/d = 18.3$. With water as working fluid at room temperature the\nReynolds numbers that can be achieved are $\\text{Re}_i = \\omega_i r_i\n(r_o-r_i)/\\nu = 2.8 \\times 10^5$ and $\\text{Re}_o = \\omega_o r_o (r_o-r_i)/\\nu\n= 2 \\times 10^5$, or a combined Reynolds number of up to $\\text{Re} = (\\omega_i\nr_i -\\omega_o r_o)(r_o-r_i)/\\nu = 4.8 \\times 10^5$. If the working fluid is\nchanged to the fluorinated liquid FC-3284 with kinematic viscosity 0.42 cSt,\nthe combined Reynolds number can reach $\\text{Re} = 1.1 \\times 10^6$. The\napparatus features precise temperature control of the outer and inner cylinder\nseparately, and is fully optically accessible from the side and top. The new\nfacility offers the possibility to accurately study the process of boiling\ninside a turbulent flow and its effect on the flow.\n", "  We study two experimental ways to measure the heavy-quark content of the\nproton: using the Callan-Gross ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and/or azimuthal\n$\\cos(2\\varphi)$ asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Our\napproach is based on the perturbative stability of the QCD predictions for\nthese two quantities. We resume the mass logarithms of the type\n$\\alpha_{s}\\ln\\left( Q^{2}/m^{2}\\right)$ and conclude that heavy-quark\ndensities in the nucleon can, in principle, be determined from data on the\nCallan-Gross ratio and/or azimuthal asymmetry. In particular, the charm content\nof the proton can be measured in future studies at the proposed Large\nHadron-Electron (LHeC) and Electron-Ion (EIC) Colliders.\n", "  Within the framework of a multiphase transport model (AMPT), the $\\phi$-meson\nproduction is studied in d+Au collisions at \\srt = {200} GeV in the forward\n(d-going, $1.2<y<2.2$) and backward (Au-going, $-2.2<y<-1.2$) direction. The\nAMPT model with string melting version (parton cascade turning-on) describes\nthe experimental data well, while the pure hadronic transport scenario of the\nAMPT model underestimates the $\\phi$-meson production rate in comparison with\nthe data. Detailed investigations including the rapidity, transverse momentum\nand collision system size dependencies of $\\phi$-meson nuclear modification\nfactor indicate that a combination of the initial state effect and a follow-up\nparton cascade is required in the AMPT model to describe the data. Similar\ncalculations are also present in p+Pb collisions at \\srt = {5.02} TeV and p+p\ncollisions at \\srt = {2.76} TeV. The findings from a comparison of AMPT model\nstudy with the data are consistent with that at RHIC energy.\n", "  The behavior of games repeated in parallel, when played with quantumly\nentangled players, has received much attention in recent years. Quantum\nanalogues of Raz's classical parallel repetition theorem have been proved for\nmany special classes of games. However, for general entangled games no parallel\nrepetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player\ngame $G$ repeated $n$ times in parallel is at most $c_G n^{-1/4} \\log n$ for a\nconstant $c_G$ depending on $G$, provided that the entangled value of $G$ is\nless than 1. In particular, this gives the first proof that the entangled value\nof a parallel repeated game must converge to 0 for all games whose entangled\nvalue is less than 1. Central to our proof is a combination of both classical\nand quantum correlated sampling.\n", "  Spatially localized states play an important role in transition to turbulence\nin shear flows (Kawahara, Uhlmann & van Veen, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 44, 203\n(2012)). Despite the fact that some of them are attractors on the separatrix\nbetween laminar and turbulent flows, little is known of their dynamics. We\ninvestigate here the temporal dynamics of such steady spatially localized\nsolutions in the context of plane Couette flow. These solutions exist on\noscillating branches in parameter space. We consider the saddle-nodes of these\nbranches as initial conditions of simulations run with offset Reynolds numbers.\nWe observe a relaminarization regime mostly characterized by deterministic\ndynamics and identify within this regime the existence of parameter intervals\nin which the results are stochastic and long-lived chaotic transients are\nobserved. These results are obtained below the threshold for transition, shed\nlight on the emergence of stochasticity in transitional plane Couette flow and\nwill likely inform a range of shear flow configurations.\n", "  We analyze two simultaneous \\nustar{} and \\swift{} data of the Atoll type\nneutron star (NS) X-ray binary 4U~1728--34 observed on 1 and 3 October, 2013.\nBased on power density spectra, hardness ratio and colour-colour diagram, we\ninfer that the first and second observations belong to the island state and\nlower banana state, respectively. During island state, a low-frequency\nquasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) at $\\sim4.53$ Hz is observed along with four\ntype-I X-ray bursts ($\\sim 10-15$ s duration each). The X-ray luminosity of the\nsource during the island and lower banana states are found to be $L_{X}= 1.1$\nand $1.6\\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively which correspond to $\\sim\n6\\%$ and $\\sim 9\\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The combined burst spectrum is\nwell represented by a blackbody with a characteristic temperature of\n$2.22\\pm0.05\\kev$ and the blackbody radius of $9.87\\pm1.86$ km which is\nconsistent with the typical radius of the neutron star. The persistent energy\nspectra from both observations in the energy band $1-79\\kev$ are well described\nwith thermal emission from the NS surface ($kT_{bb}\\simeq1-2.5\\kev$),\nComptonized emission of thermal seed photons from the hot boundary layer/corona\nand the strong reflection component from the accretion disc. We detect a broad\nIron line in the $5-8 \\kev$ band and reflection hump in the $15-30 \\kev$ band.\nThese features are well modelled by the {\\tt relxill} reflection model. From\njoint spectral fitting, we constrain the inclination angle of the binary system\nand inner disc radius to be $22\\degree-40\\degree$ and $(2.8-4.3)\\times\nR_{ISCO}$, respectively. From inner disc radius, we estimate the magnetic field\nto be $(3.3-6.5)\\times10^{8}$ Gauss.\n", "  The semiclassical theory of light-matter interactions describes the\ninteraction between a classical electromagnetic field with a quantum mechanical\ntwo-level system.We show that the quantum mechanical two-level system can be\nmodeled by a system of two coupled classical harmonic oscillators whose\neigenstates are split in frequency according to the coupling strength and play\nthe roles of the two levels of the quantum mechanical two-level system. The\neffect of the light field on the mechanical system is modeled as a modulation\nof the spring constants of the individual oscillators. Using this fully\nclassical model, we derive the Bloch equations for a two-level system and\ndiscuss the mechanical analogues of Rabi oscillations and coherent control\nexperiments\n", "  Cell membranes are out of thermodynamic equilibrium notably because of\nmembrane recycling, i.e. active exchange of material with the cytosol. We\npropose an analytically tractable model of biomembrane predicting the effects\nof recycling on the size of protein nanodomains. It includes a short-range\nattraction between proteins and a weaker long-range repulsion which ensures the\nexistence of so-called cluster phases at equilibrium, where monomeric proteins\ncoexist with finite-size domains. Our main finding is that when taking\nrecycling into account, the typical cluster size increases logarithmically with\nthe recycling rate. Using physically realistic model parameters, the predicted\ntwo-fold increase due to recycling in living cells is very likely\nexperimentally measurable with the help of super-resolution microscopy.\n", "  Inspired by the results on symmetries of the symplectic Dirac operator, we\nrealize symplectic spinor fields and the symplectic Dirac operator in the\nframework of (the double cover of) homogeneous projective structure in two real\ndimensions. The symmetry group of the homogeneous model of the double cover of\nprojective geometry in two real dimensions is\n$\\widetilde{\\mathrm{SL}}(3,{\\mathbb R})$.\n", "  The electron mass in atomic mass units has been determined with a relative\nuncertainty of $2.8\\cdot 10^{-11}$, which represents a 13-fold improvement of\nthe 2010 CODATA value. The underlying measurement principle combines a\nhigh-precision measurement of the Larmor-to-cyclotron frequency ratio on a\nsingle hydrogen-like carbon ion in a Penning trap with a corresponding very\naccurate $g$-factor calculation. Here, we present the measurement results in\ndetail, including a comprehensive discussion of the systematic shifts and their\nuncertainties. A special focus is set on the various sources of phase jitters,\nwhich are essential for the understanding of the applied line-shape model for\nthe $g$-factor resonance.\n", "  For the first time a direct determination of the atomic mass difference of\n187Re and 187Os has been performed with the Penning-trap mass spectrometer\nSHIPTRAP applying the novel phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique.\nThe obtained value of 2492(30stat)(15sys) eV is in excellent agreement with the\nQ values determined indirectly with microcalorimetry and thus resolves a\nlong-standing discrepancy with older proportional counter measurements. This is\nessential for the determination of the neutrino mass from the beta-decay of\n187Re as planned in future microcalorimetric measurements. In addition, an\naccurate mass difference of 187Re and 187Os is also important for the\nassessment of 187Re for cosmochronology.\n", "  Neutrino-nuclear responses in the form of squares of nuclear matrix\nelements,NMEs, are crucial for studies of neutrino-induced processes in nuclei.\nIn this work we investigate magnetic hexadecapole (M4) NMEs in medium-heavy\nnuclei. The experimentally derived NMEs, $M_{\\rm EXP}$(M4), deduced from\nobserved M4 $\\gamma $ transition half-lives are compared with the\nsingle-quasiparticle (QP) NMEs, $M_{\\rm QP}$(M4), and the microscopic\nquasiparticle-phonon model (MQPM) NMEs $M_{\\rm MQPM}$(M4). The experimentally\ndriven M4 NMEs are found to be reduced by a coefficient $k \\approx 0.29 $ with\nrespect to $M_{\\rm QP}$(M4) and by $k \\approx 0.33$ with respect to $M_{\\rm\nMQPM}$(M4). The M4 NMEs are reduced a little by the quasiparticle-phonon\ncorrelations of the MQPM wave functions but mainly by other nucleonic and\nnon-nucleonic correlations which are not explicitly included in the MQPM. The\nfound reduction rates are of the same order of magnitude as those for magnetic\nquadrupole $\\gamma $ transitions and Gamow-Teller (GT) and spin-dipole (SD)\n$\\beta $ transitions. The impact of the found reduction coefficients on the\nmagnitudes of the NMEs involved in astroneutrino interactions and neutrinoless\ndouble beta decays are discussed.\n", "  Average hard-tail X-ray emission in the soft state of nine bright Atoll\nlow-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (NS-LMXBs) are investigated\nby using the light curves of MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT. Two sources (4U 1820$-$30\nand 4U 1735$-$44) exhibit large hardness ratio (15--50 keV$/$2--10 keV: {\\it\nHR} $>$ 0.1), while the other sources distribute at {\\it HR} $\\ltsim$ 0.1. In\neither case, {\\it HR} does not depend on the 2--10 keV luminosity. Therefore\nthe difference of {\\it HR} is due to the 15--50 keV luminosity, which is\nComptonized emission. The Compton cloud is assumed to be around the neutron\nstar. The size of the Compton cloud would affect the value of {\\it HR}.\nAlthough the magnetic field of NS-LMXB is weak, we could expect a larger\nAlfv\\'{e}n radius than the innermost stable circular orbit or the neutron star\nradius in some sources. In such cases, the accretion inflow is stopped at the\nAlfv\\'{e}n radius and would create relatively large Compton cloud. It would\nresult in the observed larger Comptonized emission. By attributing the\ndifference of the size of Compton cloud to the Alfv\\'{e}n radius, we can\nestimate the magnetic fields of neutron star. The obtained lower/upper limits\nare consistent with the previous results.\n", "  The density classification problem is the computational problem of finding\nthe majority in a given array of votes in a distributed fashion. It is known\nthat no cellular automaton rule with binary alphabet can solve the density\nclassification problem. On the other hand, it was shown that a probabilistic\nmixture of the traffic rule and the majority rule solves the one-dimensional\nproblem correctly with a probability arbitrarily close to one. We investigate\nthe possibility of a similar approach in two dimensions. We show that in two\ndimensions, the particle spacing problem, which is solved in one dimension by\nthe traffic rule, has no cellular automaton solution. However, we propose exact\nand randomized solutions via interacting particle systems. We assess the\nperformance of our models using numeric simulations.\n", "  A novel phenomenon of anomalous contrast in scanning electron microscope when\nthe instrument is used to observe an insulator specimen with a wolfram probe,\nwe called double imaging, is reported in this article. We give a detail\nanalysis of this phenomenon in its occurrence, and discuss the influence of the\nadded probe to internal electric field which lead to the occurrence of double\nimaging.\n", "  The ubiquity of turbulent flows in nature and technology makes it of utmost\nimportance to fundamentally understand turbulence. Kolmogorov's 1941 paradigm\nsuggests that for strongly turbulent flows with many degrees of freedom and its\nlarge fluctuations, there would only be \\emph{one} turbulent state as the large\nfluctuations would explore the entire higher-dimensional phase space. Here we\nreport the first conclusive evidence of multiple turbulent states for large\nReynolds number $\\text{Re}=\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ (Taylor number\n$\\text{Ta}=\\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$) Taylor-Couette flow in the regime of ultimate\nturbulence, by probing the phase space spanned by the rotation rates of the\ninner and outer cylinder. The manifestation of multiple turbulent states is\nexemplified by providing combined global torque and local velocity\nmeasurements. This result verifies the notion that bifurcations can occur in\nhigh-dimensional flows i.e. very large $\\text{Re}$) and questions Kolmogorov's\nparadigm.\n", "  CuO nanowires with a twin structure are synthesized by thermal oxidation.\nStructural characterization carried out by electron microscopy observation of\nCuO nanowires shown a screw dislocation along with the twin structure.According\nto transmission electron microscope(TEM) analysis, including two-beam TEM and\nhigh resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization, the screw dislocation was\nconfirmed, with a Burgers vector along with[110] direction. It is suggested\nthat the screw dislocation drives nanowire growth, while the screw dislocation\nis formed by the multiply-twinned structure in nanowire as a result of stress\nrelief.\n", "  We report on the nucleation of bubbles on solids that are gently rubbed\nagainst each other in a liquid. The phenomenon is found to depend strongly on\nthe material and roughness of the solid surfaces. For a given surface,\ntemperature, and gas content, a trail of growing bubbles is observed if the\nrubbing force and velocity exceed a certain threshold. Direct observation\nthrough a transparent solid shows that each bubble in the trail results from\nthe early coalescence of several microscopic bubbles, themselves detaching from\nmicroscopic gas pockets forming between the solids. From a detailed study of\nthe wear tracks, with atomic force and scanning electron microscopy imaging, we\nconclude that these microscopic gas pockets originate from a local fracturing\nof the surface asperities, possibly enhanced by chemical reactions at the\nfreshly created surfaces. Our findings will be useful either for preventing\nundesired bubble formation or, on the contrary, for \"writing with bubbles,\"\ni.e., creating controlled patterns of microscopic bubbles.\n", "  Using a Generalised-Hydrodynamic (GH) fluid model we study the influence of\nstrong coupling induced modification of the fluid compressibility on the\ndynamics of compressional Mach cones in a dusty plasma medium. A significant\nstructural change of lateral wakes for a given Mach number and Epstein drag\nforce is found in the strongly coupled regime. With the increase of fluid\ncompressibility, the peak amplitude of the normalised perturbed dust density\nfirst increases and then decreases monotonically after reaching its maximum\nvalue. It is also noticed that the opening angle of the cone structure\ndecreases with the increase of the compressibility of the medium and the arm of\nthe Mach cone breaks up into small structures in the velocity vector profile\nwhen the coupling between the dust particles increases.\n", "  The nonlinear dynamics of a transverse domain wall (TDW) in Permalloy and\nNickel nanostrips with two artificially patterned pinning centers is studied\nnumerically up to rf frequencies. The phase diagram frequency - driving\namplitude shows a rich variety of dynamical behaviors depending on the material\nparameters and the type and shape of pinning centers. We find that T-shaped\ntraps (antinotches) create a classical double well Duffing potential that leads\nto a small chaotic region in the case of Nickel and a large one for Py. In\ncontrast, the rectangular constrictions (notches) create an exponential\npotential that leads to larger chaotic regions interspersed with periodic\nwindows for both Py and Ni. The influence of temperature manifests itself by\nenlarging the chaotic region and activating thermal jumps between the pinning\nsites while reducing the depinning field at low frequency in the notched\nstrips.\n", "  The rotational state of asteroids is controlled by various physical\nmechanisms including collisions, internal damping and the\nYarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. We have analysed the\nchanges in magnitude between consecutive detections of approximately 60,000\nasteroids measured by the PanSTARRS 1 survey during its first 18 months of\noperations. We have attempted to explain the derived brightness changes\nphysically and through the application of a simple model. We have found a\ntendency toward smaller magnitude variations with decreasing diameter for\nobjects of 1 < D < 8 km. Assuming the shape distribution of objects in this\nsize range to be independent of size and composition our model suggests a\npopulation with average axial ratios 1 : 0.85 \\pm 0.13 : 0.71 \\pm 0.13, with\nlarger objects more likely to have spin axes perpendicular to the orbital\nplane.\n", "  The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA survey (GLEAM) is a new relatively\nlow resolution, contiguous 72-231 MHz survey of the entire sky south of\ndeclination +25 deg. In this paper, we outline one approach to determine the\nrelative contribution of system noise, classical confusion and sidelobe\nconfusion in GLEAM images. An understanding of the noise and confusion\nproperties of GLEAM is essential if we are to fully exploit GLEAM data and\nimprove the design of future low-frequency surveys. Our early results indicate\nthat sidelobe confusion dominates over the entire frequency range, implying\nthat enhancements in data processing have the potential to further reduce the\nnoise.\n", "  We apply the quantum mechanical (first-quantized) JWKB approximation to a\ntwo-body path integral describing the near-forward scattering of two\nrelativistic, heavy, non-identical, scalar particles in $D$ spacetime\ndimensions. In contrast to the loop expansion, in $D = 4$ this gives a\nstrong-coupling expansion, and in $D = 3$ a non-perturbative weak-coupling\nexpansion. When the interaction is mediated by massless quanta with spin $N$,\nwe obtain explicit, relativistic results for the scattering amplitude when $N =\n0$, $1$ and $2$. In $D = 4$ we find a Regge trajectory function that agrees\nwith the usual quantum mechanical spectrum. We also find an exponentiated\ninfrared divergence that becomes a pure phase factor when the Mandelstam\ninvariants $s$ and $t$ are inside of the physical scattering region. In $D = 3$\nwe find a singularity whose position along the $s$ axis is dependent on $t$.\nWhen the interaction is mediated by a heavy scalar with mass $M$, in $D = 3$ we\nfind an all-order scattering amplitude where the multi-mass branch points $t =\n(L + 1)^{2}M^{2}$ appear as Regge poles.\n", "  Many quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols require random choice of\nmeasurement basis for each pulse or each train of pulses. In some QKD\nprotocols, such as the Round-Robin Differential Phase Shift (RRDPS) QKD\nprotocol, this requirement is a bit challenging as randomly choosing hundreds\nof settings for every, say, 100 pulses may be too fast with current\ntechnologies. In this paper, we solve this issue by proving the security of QKD\nprotocols with slow basis choice without compromising the secret key rate. We\nalso show that the random choice of the bases for the state preparation can be\nmade slow if the signals do not leak any information on the basis. Examples of\nQKD protocols that our technique can apply include the RRDPS protocol and\nBB84-type protocols, and our technique relaxes demands for the implementation\nof QKD systems.\n", "  Contacts between individuals play an important role in determining how\ninfectious diseases spread. Various methods to gather data on such contacts\nco-exist, from surveys to wearable sensors. Comparisons of data obtained by\ndifferent methods in the same context are however scarce, in particular with\nrespect to their use in data-driven models of spreading processes. Here, we use\na combined data set describing contacts registered by sensors and friendship\nrelations in the same population to address this issue in a case study. We\ninvestigate if the use of the friendship network is equivalent to a sampling\nprocedure performed on the sensor contact network with respect to the outcome\nof simulations of spreading processes: such an equivalence might indeed give\nhints on ways to compensate for the incompleteness of contact data deduced from\nsurveys. We show that this is indeed the case for these data, for a\nspecifically designed sampling procedure, in which respondents report their\nneighbors with a probability depending on their contact time. We study the\nimpact of this specific sampling procedure on several data sets, discuss\nlimitations of our approach and its possible applications in the use of data\nsets of various origins in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes.\n", "  We report the modifications of compressional Mach cone propagation\ncharacteristics due to \\textcolor{black}{the} polarization force acting on\nmicron size dust particles embedded in a non-uniform plasma. We solve the\nhydrodynamic fluid equations for highly charged dust particles to investigate\nthe Mach cone by incorporating the polarization force in the momentum equation\nand observe the structural change on lateral wakes at different polarization\nforce for a given Mach number and Epstein drag force. We also notice that the\nmaximum amplitude of normalized dust density perturbation decreases with the\nincrease of polarization interaction when the other parameters remain constant.\n", "  The first law for the holographic entanglement entropy of spheres in a\nboundary CFT with a bulk Lovelock dual is extended to include variations of the\nbulk Lovelock coupling constants. Such variations in the bulk correspond to\nperturbations within a family of boundary CFTs. The new contribution to the\nfirst law is found to be the product of the variation $\\delta a$ of the A-type\ntrace anomaly coefficient for even dimensional CFTs, or more generally its\nextension $\\delta a^*$ to include odd dimensional boundaries, times the ratio\n$S/a^*$. Since $a^*$ is a measure of the number of degrees of freedom $N$ per\nunit volume of the boundary CFT, this new term has the form $\\mu\\delta N$,\nwhere the chemical potential $\\mu$ is given by the entanglement entropy per\ndegree of freedom.\n", "  Considering agricultural landscapes as networks can provide information about\nspatial connectivity relevant for a wide range of applications including\npollination, pest management, and ecology. Global agricultural networks are\nwell-described by power law rank-size distributions. However, regional analyses\ncapture only a subset of the total global network. Most analyses are regional.\nIn this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally\nobserved scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial\ndomains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? We\nanalyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide\nrange of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction\nwithin the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial\nvariability - but still possess similar scaling properties to the global\ndistribution of agriculture. We also find similar results using a 39 km2 IKONOS\nimage. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an\nexample of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size\ndistributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We\nsuggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a\nstraightforward way of characterizing the connectivity of complex spatial\ndistributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial\nscales relevant for practical agricultural applications.\n", "  Many Seyfert galaxies display weak 'coronal' emission features corresponding\nto [Fe VII], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] in their optical spectra, whereas elsewhere\nthese lines seem to be entirely absent. These lines appear to highlight zones\nin the nucleus irradiated by high-energy photons. The presence of these zones\nand the conditions therein as determined by the relative line strengths and\nprofiles impose important constraints on the physical models of active galactic\nnuclei, and Seyferts in particular. In 2009 the discovery was announced of the\nhighly unusual spectrum of SDSS J0952+2143, where the coronal lines are\nexceptionally strong. This paper presents a second object with abnormally\nstrong coronal features, SDSS J1055+5637. The spectrum, line ratios and related\nparameters are compared to those of SDSS J0952+2143, three AGN with moderate\ncoronal lines and one where the coronal lines are missing altogether. Possible\nmechanisms are discussed that may account for the stronger than usual coronal\nfeatures.\n", "  We present new results from a continuing 5 GHz search for flaring radio\nemission from a sample of L and T brown dwarfs, conducted with the 305-m\nArecibo radio telescope. In addition to the previously reported flaring from\nthe T6.5-dwarf 2MASS J10475385+212423, we have detected and confirmed\ncircularly polarized flares from another T6-dwarf, WISEPC J112254.73+255021.5.\nAlthough the flares are sporadic, they appear to occur at a stable period of\n0.288 hours. Given the current constraints, periods equal to its second and\nthird subharmonic cannot be ruled out. The stability of this period over the\n8-month timespan of observations indicates that, if real, it likely reflects\nthe star's rapid rotation. If confirmed, any of the three inferred\nperiodicities would be much shorter than the shortest, 1.41-hour rotation\nperiod of a brown dwarf measured so far. This finding would place a new\nobservational constraint on the angular momentum evolution and rotational\nstability of substellar objects. The detection of radio emission from the sixth\n~1000 K dwarf further demonstrates that the coolest brown dwarfs and, possibly,\nyoung giant planets, can be efficiently investigated using radio observations\nat centimeter wavelengths as a tool.\n", "  The dispersion properties of low frequency dust acoustic waves in the strong\ncoupling regime are investigated experimentally in an argon plasma embedded\nwith a mixture of kaolin and $MnO_2$ dust particles. The neutral pressure is\nvaried over a wide range to change the collisional properties of the dusty\nplasma. In the low collisional regime the turnover of the dispersion curve at\nhigher wave numbers and the resultant region of $\\partial\\omega/\\partial k < 0$\nare identified as signatures of dust-dust correlations. In the high collisional\nregime dust neutral collisions produce a similar effect and prevent an\nunambiguous identification of strong coupling effects.\n", "  It is shown that the potential of Keesom which depends on temperature cannot\nbe used for calculate the second virial coefficient of polar molecules and the\nformulae for second virial coefficient of [2] have no molecular statistical\nmechanical base for water and carbon dioxide. The contradictions and errors of\n[2] are discussed.\n", "  The masses of negative parity $(70,1^-)$ bottom nonstrange baryons are\ncalculated in the relativistic quark model. The relativistic three-quark\nequations of the $(70,1^-)$ bottom baryon multiplet are derived in the\nframework of the dispersion relation technique. The approximate solutions of\nthese equations using the method based on the extraction of leading\nsingularities of the amplitude are obtained. The masses of 21 baryons are\npredicted.\n", "  There has been recent interest in the development of optical analogues of\nlumped element circuitry, where optical elements act as effective optical\ninductors, capacitors, and resistors. Such optical circuitry requires the\nphotonic equivalent of electrical wires, structures able carry optical\nfrequency signals to and from the lumped circuit elements while simultaneously\nmaintaining signal carrier wavelengths much larger than the size of the lumped\nelements. Here we demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of\nhybrid metal/doped-semiconductor 'photonic wires' operating at optical\nfrequencies with effective indices of propagation near-zero. Our samples are\ncharacterized by polarization and angle-dependent FTIR spectroscopy and modeled\nby finite element methods and rigorous coupled wave analysis. We demonstrate\ncoupling to such photonic wires from free space, and show the effective\nwavelength of the excited mode to be approximately an order of magnitude larger\nthan the free-space wavelength of our light. The operational length of the\nphotonic wires approaches twice the free space wavelength, significantly longer\nthan what is achievable with bulk epsilon near zero materials. The novel\narchitecture utilized in our hybrid waveguides allows for significant design\nflexibility by control of the semiconductor material's optical properties and\nthe sample geometry. In addition, by utilizing a semiconductor-based\narchitecture, our photonic wires can be designed to monolithically integrate\nthe optical equivalents of capacitive, inductive, and resistive lumped circuit\nelements, as well optoelectronic sources and detectors. As such, the\ndemonstrated photonic wires have the potential to provide a key component, and\na realistic framework, for the development of optical circuitry.\n", "  We investigate the presence of extended ionized outflows in 18 luminous type\n2 AGNs (11 quasars and 7 high luminosity Seyfert 2s) at 0.3<z<0.6 based on\nVLT-FORS2 spectroscopy. We infer typical lower limits on the radial sizes of\nthe outflows R>=severalx100 pc and upper limits R<1-2 kpc. Our results are\ninconsistent with related studies which suggest that large scale R~several-15\nkpc are ubiquitous in QSO2. We study the possible causes of discrepancy and\npropose that seeing smearing is the cause of the large inferred sizes. The\nimplications in our understanding of the feedback phenomenon are important\nsince the mass M (through the density), mass injection M(dot) and energy\ninjection rates E(dot) of the outflows become highly uncertain. One conclusion\nseems unavoidable: M, M(dot), E(dot) are modest or low compared with previous\nestimations. No evidence is found supporting that typical outflows can affect\nthe interstellar medium of the host galaxies accross spatial scales >~1-2 kpc.\n", "  The magnetospheric cusps are important sites of the coupling of a\nmagnetosphere with the solar wind. The combination of both ground- and\nspace-based observations at Earth have enabled considerable progress to be made\nin understanding the terrestrial cusp and its role in the coupling of the\nmagnetosphere to the solar wind via the polar magnetosphere. Voyager 2 fully\nexplored Neptune's cusp in 1989 but highly inclined orbits of the Cassini\nspacecraft at Saturn present the most recent opportunity to repeatedly studying\nthe polar magnetosphere of a rapidly rotating planet. In this paper we discuss\nobservations made by Cassini during two passes through Saturn's southern polar\nmagnetosphere. Our main findings are that i) Cassini directly encounters the\nsouthern polar cusp with evidence for the entry of magnetosheath plasma into\nthe cusp via magnetopause reconnection, ii) magnetopause reconnection and entry\nof plasma into the cusp can occur over a range of solar wind conditions, and\niii) double cusp morphologies are consistent with the position of the cusp\noscillating in phase with Saturn's global magnetospheric periodicities.\n", "  The Q weak experiment has made several interesting beam normal single spin\nasymmetry measurements. Preliminary result from a 3.2% measurement of the beam\nnormal single spin asymmetry in elastic e+p scattering at E = 1.155 GeV and\n{\\theta} lab = 7.8(deg) is presented. We have also made measurements of this\nasymmetry in elastic and inelastic scattering in the Delta resonance region\nfrom Hydrogen, Aluminum and Carbon targets and e+e scattering from Hydrogen\ntarget. Some initial results from these measurements are also presented.\n", "  It is shown that in general case may be not correct the statements of\n[1,2,6-8] that 1) the isochoric heat capacity on the entire thermodynamic\nsurface, including the metastable region of states and the region defined by\nthe spinodal, remains positive and finite except for the critical point, and 2)\nthe isobaric heat capacity becomes negative in the region defined by spinodal.\n", "  We report the large linear magnetoresistance ($\\sim 300\\%$ in 9 T field at 2\nK) and magnetothermopower in layered SrZnSb$_2$ crystal with\nquasi-two-dimensional Sb layers. A crossover from the semiclassical parabolic\nfield dependent magnetoresistance to linear field dependent magnetoresistance\nwith increasing magnetic field is observed. The magnetoresistance behavior can\nbe described very well by combining the semiclassical cyclotron contribution\nand the quantum limit magnetoresistance. Magnetic field also enhances the\nthermopower. Our results can be well understood by the magnetotransport of\nDirac states in the bulk band structure.\n"]}
