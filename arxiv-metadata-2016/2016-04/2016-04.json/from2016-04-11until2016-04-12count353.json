for the\ntime-dependence of a Hamiltonian that maximizes the fidelity of a desired\nquantum gate on any finite-dimensional quantum system in the presence of\narbitrary bath and noise sources. The method is illustrated for a single-qubit\ngate implemented on a three-level system.\n", "  By pointing out an error in the previous derivation of the area spectrum\nbased on Ashtekar's variables, we suggest a new area spectrum; instead of the\nnorm of Ashtekar's gravitational electric field, we show that the norm of our\n\"new\" gravitational electric field based on our \"newer\" variables, which we\nconstruct in this paper for this purpose, gives the correct area spectrum. In\nparticular, our \"newer\" variables are mathematically consistent; the constraint\nalgebra is closed. Moreover, by using our new area spectrum, we \"almost\ncorrectly\" predict the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy without having to adjust the\nImmirzi parameter; we show that a numerical formula actually yielded\n$0.997\\cdots$, which is very close to 1, the expected value with the black hole\nentropy given as $A/4$. We conjecture that the difference, 0.003, is due to the\nextra dimensions that may modify the area spectrum. Then, we derive a formula\nfor the degeneracy for a single-partition black hole, i.e., a black hole made\nof a single unit area, and explicitly show that our area spectrum correctly\nreproduces the degeneracy. Furthermore, by using two totally different methods,\nwe obtain the proportionality constant \"$C$\" related to the degeneracy. The\nfirst method based on fitting yields 172$\\sim$173 while the second method\nyields 172.87$\\cdots$, which strongly suggest that our area spectrum is on the\nright track. We also show that the area spectra based on Ashtekar variables\nneither reproduce the degeneracy of single-partition black hole nor yield\nagreement for $C$ obtained by using the two methods.\n", "  We study four dimensional quantum gravity formulated as a certain conformal\nfield theory at the ultraviolet fixed point, whose dynamics is described by the\ncombined system of Riegert-Wess-Zumino and Weyl actions. Background free nature\ncomes out as quantum diffeomorphism symmetry by quantizing the conformal factor\nof the metric field nonperturbatively. In this paper, Minkowski background M^4\nis employed in practice. The generator of quantum diffeomorphism that forms\nconformal algebra is constructed. Using it, we study the composite scalar\noperator that becomes a good conformal field. We find that physical fields are\ndescribed by such scalar fields with conformal dimension 4. Consequently,\ntensor fields outside the unitarity bound are excluded. Computations of quantum\nalgebra on M^4 are carried out in the coordinate space using operator products\nof the fields. The nilpotent BRST operator is also constructed.\n", "  We consider a general class of quantum gravity-inspired, modified gravity\ntheories, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is extended through the addition of\nall terms quadratic in the curvature tensor coupled to scalar fields with\nstandard kinetic energy. This class of theories includes\nEinstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons modified gravity as special\ncases. We analytically derive and solve the coupled field equations in the\npost-Newtonian approximation, assuming a comparable-mass, spinning black hole\nbinary source in a quasi-circular, weak-field/slow-motion orbit. We find that a\nnaive subtraction of divergent piece associated with the point-particle\napproximation is ill-suited to represent compact objects in these theories.\nInstead, we model them by appropriate effective sources built so that known\nstrong-field solutions are reproduced in the far-field limit. In doing so, we\nprove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory\ncan have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in\ndiametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories. We then employ\ntechniques similar to the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations\nto obtain analytic expressions for the scalar field, metric perturbation, and\nthe associated gravitational wave luminosity measured at infinity. We find that\nscalar field emission mainly dominates the energy flux budget, sourcing\nelectric-type (even-parity) dipole scalar radiation and magnetic-type\n(odd-parity) quadrupole scalar radiation, correcting the General Relativistic\nprediction at relative -1PN and 2PN orders. Such modifications lead to\ncorrections in the emitted gravitational waves that can be mapped to the\nparameterized post-Einsteinian framework. Such modifications could be strongly\nconstrained with gravitational wave observations.\n", "  Several correlation and interference effects in strong-field physics are\ninvestigated. We show that the interference of continuum wave packets can be\nthe dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in the\nover-the-barrier regime. Next, we combine HHG with resonant x-ray excitation to\nforce the recolliding continuum electron to recombine with a core hole rather\nthan the valence hole from that it was previously tunnel ionized. The scheme\nopens up perspectives for nonlinear xuv physics, attosecond x-ray pulses, and\nspectroscopy of core orbitals. Then, a method is proposed to generate\nattochirp-free harmonic pulses by engineering the appropriate electron wave\npacket. Finally, resonant photoionization mechanisms involving two atoms are\ndiscussed which can dominate over the direct single-atom ionization channel at\ninteratomic distances in the nanometer range.\n", "  Why are the laws of physics formulated in terms of complex Hilbert spaces?\nAre there natural and consistent modifications of quantum theory that could be\ntested experimentally? This book chapter gives a self-contained and accessible\nsummary of our paper [New J. Phys. 13, 063001, 2011] addressing these\nquestions, presenting the main ideas, but dropping many technical details. We\nshow that the formalism of quantum theory can be reconstructed from four\nnatural postulates, which do not refer to the mathematical formalism, but only\nto the information-theoretic content of the physical theory. Our starting point\nis to assume that there exist physical events (such as measurement outcomes)\nthat happen probabilistically, yielding the mathematical framework of \"convex\nstate spaces\". Then, quantum theory can be reconstructed by assuming that (i)\nglobal states are determined by correlations between local measurements, (ii)\nsystems that carry the same amount of information have equivalent state spaces,\n(iii) reversible time evolution can map every pure state to every other, and\n(iv) positivity of probabilities is the only restriction on the possible\nmeasurements.\n", "  An analogy is developed between the breaking of space-inversion symmetry in\nequilibrium statistical mechanics and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics. In this way, similar relationships\ncharacterizing fluctuations are obtained in both contexts.\n", "  A 2.29 GHz VLBI all-sky survey of ultra-compact radio sources has formed the\nbasis of a number of cosmological investigations, which examine the\nrelationship between angular-size and redshift. Here I use a sample of 468 such\nsources with 0.5<z<=3.787, to investigate the isotropy of the Universe. The\nsample is divided into hemispherical sub-samples, over an all-sky 5 degree x 5\ndegree array, each of which is allowed to determine a value of Omega_m,\nassuming that we are living in a spatially flat homogeneous isotropic LambdaCDM\nmodel. If we regard the latter as a null hypothesis, then it fails the test --\nthe results show significant anisotropy, the smallest value of Omega_m being\ntowards (l,b)=(253.9,24.1) degrees, the largest in the opposite direction. This\nis close to the CMB dipole axis, but in the obverse sense. This is interpreted\nas meaning that the Universe is not spatially homogeneous on the largest\nscales, and is better represented at late times by a spherically symmetric\nmodel with a density enhancement at its centre.\n", "  Many chondrules are found to be surrounded by a fine grained rim. Supposedly,\nthese rims were acquired from dust accreted to the chondrules in a\nprotoplanetary disk. In numerical simulations we study the heat transfer in\nilluminated bare and dust mantled chondrules. The calculations consider the\nchondrule size, the dust mantle size, and the thermal conductivities of both\ncomponents as parameters. We calculate the photophoretic force and compare the\nnumerical results to analytical approximations. We give an expression to\nquantify the photophoretic force on a spherical particle in the free molecular\nregime to better than 2%. We describe the influence of a dust mantle on the\nphotophoretic strength by an effective thermal conductivity of the core-mantle\nparticle. The effective thermal conductivity significantly depends on the size\nratio between mantle and chondrule but not on the absolute sizes. It also\nstrongly depends on the thermal conductivity of the mantle with minor influence\nof the thermal conductivity of the chondrule. The size ratio between rim and\nchondrule in meteorites is found to vary systematically with overall size by\nother authors. Based on this, our calculations show that a photophoretic size\nsorting can occur for dust mantled chondrules in optically thin disks or at the\nevolving inner edge of the solar nebula.\n", "  We exploit the inherent entanglement of the ground state of a spin chain with\ndimerized XX or XXZ Hamiltonian to investigate the entanglement generation\nbetween the ends of the chain. We follow the strategy has been introduced in\nRef. [14] to encode the information in the entangled ground state of the system\nby local rotation. The amount of achieved entanglement in this scheme is higher\nthan the attaching a pair of maximally entanglement scenarios. Also, our\nproposal can be implemented by using the optical lattices.\n", "  Natural supports of information are given by random copolymers such as DNA or\nRNA where information is coded in the sequence of covalent bonds. At the\nmolecular scale, the stochastic growth of a single copolymer with or without a\ntemplate proceeds by successive random attachments or detachments of monomers\ncontinuously supplied by the surrounding solution. The thermodynamics of\ncopolymerization shows that fundamental links already exist between information\nand thermodynamics at the molecular scale, which opens new perspectives to\nunderstand the dynamical aspects of information in biology.\n", "  We propose a scheme to manipulate a topological spin qubit which is realized\nwith cold atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. In particular, by\nintroducing a quantum opto-electro-mechanical interface, we are able to first\ntransfer a superconducting qubit state to an atomic qubit state and then to\nstore it into the topological spin qubit. In this way, an efficient topological\nquantum memory could be constructed for the superconducting qubit. Therefore,\nwe can consolidate the advantages of both the noise resistance of the\ntopological qubits and the scalability of the superconducting qubits in this\nhybrid architecture.\n", "  We introduce a new approach to the study of influence in strategic settings\nwhere the action of an individual depends on that of others in a\nnetwork-structured way. We propose \\emph{influence games} as a\n\\emph{game-theoretic} model of the behavior of a large but finite networked\npopulation. Influence games allow \\emph{both} positive and negative\n\\emph{influence factors}, permitting reversals in behavioral choices. We\nembrace \\emph{pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE)}, an important solution\nconcept in non-cooperative game theory, to formally define the \\emph{stable\noutcomes} of an influence game and to predict potential outcomes without\nexplicitly considering intricate dynamics. We address an important problem in\nnetwork influence, the identification of the \\emph{most influential\nindividuals}, and approach it algorithmically using PSNE computation.\n\\emph{Computationally}, we provide (a) complexity characterizations of various\nproblems on influence games; (b) efficient algorithms for several special cases\nand heuristics for hard cases; and (c) approximation algorithms, with provable\nguarantees, for the problem of identifying the most influential individuals.\n\\emph{Experimentally}, we evaluate our approach using both synthetic influence\ngames as well as several real-world settings of general interest, each\ncorresponding to a separate branch of the U.S. Government.\n\\emph{Mathematically,} we connect influence games to important game-theoretic\nmodels: \\emph{potential and polymatrix games}.\n", "  We compute the gamma-ray output of axion-mediated dark matter and derive the\ncorresponding constraints set by recent data. In such scenarios the dark matter\ncandidate is a Dirac fermion that pair-annihilates into axions and/or scalars.\nProvided that the axion decays (at least partly) into photons, these models\nnaturally give rise to a box-shaped gamma-ray spectrum that may present two\ndistinct phenomenological behaviours: a narrow box, resembling a line at half\nthe dark matter mass, or a wide box, spanning an extensive energy range up to\nthe dark matter mass. Remarkably, we find that in both cases a sizable\ngamma-ray flux is predicted for a thermal relic without fine-tuning the model\nparameters nor invoking boost factors. This large output is in line with recent\nFermi-LAT observations towards the Galactic centre region and is on the verge\nof being excluded. We then make use of the Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. data to\nderive robust, model-independent upper limits on the dark matter annihilation\ncross section for the narrow and wide box scenarios. H.E.S.S. constraints, in\nparticular, turn out to match the ones from Fermi-LAT at hundreds of GeV and\nextend to multi-TeV masses. Future Cherenkov telescopes will likely probe\ngamma-ray boxes from thermal dark matter relics in the whole multi-TeV range, a\nregion hardly accessible to direct detection, collider searches and other\nindirect detection strategies.\n", "  Eigen techniques such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF) or coupled\npattern (CP) / maximum covariance analysis have been frequently used for\ndetecting patterns in multivariate climatological data sets. Recently,\nstatistical methods originating from the theory of complex networks have been\nemployed for the very same purpose of spatio-temporal analysis. This climate\nnetwork (CN) analysis is usually based on the same set of similarity matrices\nas is used in classical EOF or CP analysis, e.g., the correlation matrix of a\nsingle climatological field or the cross-correlation matrix between two\ndistinct climatological fields. In this study, formal relationships as well as\nconceptual differences between both eigen and network approaches are derived\nand illustrated using exemplary global precipitation, evaporation and surface\nair temperature data sets. These results allow to pinpoint that CN analysis can\ncomplement classical eigen techniques and provides additional information on\nthe higher-order structure of statistical interrelationships in climatological\ndata. Hence, CNs are a valuable supplement to the statistical toolbox of the\nclimatologist, particularly for making sense out of very large data sets such\nas those generated by satellite observations and climate model intercomparison\nexercises.\n", "  We describe how randomized benchmarking can be used to reconstruct the unital\npart of any trace-preserving quantum map, which in turn is sufficient for the\nfull characterization of any unitary evolution, or more generally, any unital\ntrace-preserving evolution. This approach inherits randomized benchmarking's\nrobustness to preparation, measurement, and gate imperfections, therefore\navoiding systematic errors caused by these imperfections. We also extend these\ntechniques to efficiently estimate the average fidelity of a quantum map to\nunitary maps outside of the Clifford group. The unitaries we consider\ncorrespond to large circuits commonly used as building blocks to achieve\nscalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, we can\nefficiently verify all such subcomponents of a circuit-based universal quantum\ncomputer. In addition, we rigorously bound the time and sampling complexities\nof randomized benchmarking procedures, proving that the required non-linear\nestimation problem can be solved efficiently.\n", "  The study of quantum correlations in High-dimensional bipartite systems is\ncrucial for the development of quantum computing. We propose relative entropy\nas a distance measure of correlations may be measured by means of the distance\nfrom the quantum state to the closest classical-classical state. In particular,\nWe establish relations between relative entropy and quantum discord quantifiers\nobtained by means of orthogonal projective measurements. We show that for\nsymmetrical X-states density matrices the quantum discord is equal to relative\nentropy. At the end of paper, various examples of X-states such as two-qubit\nand qubit-qutrit have been demonstrated .\n", "  The DAV star, HS0507+0434B, was observed by Fu et al. (2013) in 2007 and from\n2009 December to 2010 January. There were a total of six triplets with nearly\nequal split, which were identified as $l$ = 1 modes caused by rotation. In\norder to fit the six $l$ = 1 modes, grids of white dwarf models are generated\nby WDEC. For the core composition profiles, we choose the linear fittings to\ncarbon profile of white dwarf models from MESA, which can be considered as\nresults of real nuclear burning process. Coupled with diffusion equilibrium\nH/He and He/C mixtures, we make grids of models in WDEC and do asteroseismology\nworks on HS0507+0434B. There is a total of 9.50 seconds error for our\nbest-fitting model, which is smaller than the result (a total of 22.1 seconds\nerror) of Fu et al. (2013), when fitting the six $l$ = 1 modes. The two other\nprevious identified pulsation mode frequencies (286.1 s and 743.40 s) may also\nbe well fitted by our best-fitting model. The model parameters are $T_{eff}$ =\n11450 K, log$g$ = 8.088, $M_{*}$ = 0.640 $M_{\\odot}$, log($M_{H}$/$M_{*}$) =\n-6, and log($M_{He}$/$M_{*}$) = -3.\n", "  Photophoresis is a physical process that transports particles in optical thin\nparts of protoplanetary disks, especially at the inner edge and at the\noptically surface. To model the transport and resulting effects in detail, it\nis necessary to quantify the strength of photophoresis for different particle\nclasses as a fundamental input. Here, we explore photophoresis for a set of\nchondrules. The composition and surface morphology of these chondrules was\nmeasured by X-ray tomography. Based on the three-dimensional models, heat\ntransfer through illuminated chondrules was calculated. The resulting surface\ntemperature map was then used to calculate the photophoretic strength. We found\nthat irregularities in particle shape and variations in composition induce\nvariations in the photophoretic force. These depend on the orientation of a\nparticle with respect to the light source. The variations of the absolute value\nof the photophoretic force on average over all chondrules is $4.17\\%$. The\ndeviation between the direction of the photophoretic force and illumination is\n$3.0^\\circ \\pm 1.5^\\circ$. The average photophoretic force can be well\napproximated and calculated analytically assuming a homogeneous sphere with a\nvolume equivalent mean radius and an effective thermal conductivity. We found\nan analytic expression for the effective thermal conductivity. The expression\ndepends on the two main phases of a chondrule, and decreases with the amount of\nfine-grained devitrified, plagioclase-normative mesostasis up to factor of\nthree. For the chondrule sample studied (Bjurb\\\"ole chondrite), we found a\ndependence of the photophoretic force on chondrule size.\n", "  We investigate whether non-linear effects on the large-scale power spectrum\nof dark matter, namely the increase in small-scale power and the smearing of\nbaryon acoustic oscillations, can be decreased by a log-transformation or\nemulated by an exponential transformation of the linear spectrum. To that end\nwe present a formalism to convert the power spectrum of a log-normal field to\nthe power spectrum of the logarithmic Gaussian field and vice versa. All\ningredients of our derivation can already be found in various publications in\ncosmology and other fields. We follow a more pedagogical approach providing a\ndetailed derivation, application examples, and a discussion of implementation\nsubtleties in one text. We use the formalism to show that the non-linear\nincrease in small-scale power in the matter power spectrum is significantly\nsmaller for the log-transformed spectrum which fits the linear spectrum (with\nless than 20% error) for redshifts down to 1 and $k\\leq1.0\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\nFor lower redshifts the fit to the linear spectrum is not as good, but the\nreduction of non-linear effects is still significant. Similarly, we show that\napplying the linear growth factor to the logarithmic density leads to an\nautomatic increase in small-scale power for low redshifts fitting to\nthird-order perturbation spectra and Cosmic Emulator spectra with an error of\nless than $20%$. Smearing of baryon acoustic oscillations is at least three\ntimes weaker, but still present.\n", "  Analytical models of axially symmetric thin disks of finite extension in\npresence of magnetic field are presented based on the well-known Morgan-Morgan\nsolutions. The source of the magnetic field is cons\\-tructed separating the\nequation corresponding to the Ampere's law of electrodynamics in spheroidal\noblate coordinates. This produces two asso\\-ciated Legendre equations of first\norder for the magnetic potential and hence that can be expressed as a series of\nassociated Legendre functions of the same order. The discontinuity of its\nnormal derivate across the disk allows us to interpret the source of the\nmagnetic field as a ringlike current distribution extended on all the plane of\nthe disk. We also study the circular speed curves or rotation curve for\nequatorial circular orbits of charged test particles both inside and outside\nthe disk. The stability of the orbits is analyzed for radial perturbation using\na extension of the Rayleigh criterion.\n", "  The problem of heat conduction in one-dimensional piecewise homogeneous\ncomposite materials is examined by providing an explicit solution of the\none-dimensional heat equation in each domain. The location of the interfaces is\nknown, but neither temperature nor heat flux are prescribed there. Instead, the\nphysical assumptions of their continuity at the interfaces are the only\nconditions imposed. The problem of two semi-infinite domains and that of two\nfinite-sized domains are examined in detail. We indicate also how to extend the\nsolution method to the setting of one finite-sized domain surrounded on both\nsides by semi-infinite domains, and on that of three finite-sized domains.\n", "  We continue our study of the full set of translation-invariant splitting\nGibbs measures (TISGMs, translation-invariant tree-indexed Markov chains) for\nthe $q$-state Potts model on a Cayley tree. In our previous work \\cite{KRK} we\ngave a full description of the TISGMs, and showed in particular that at\nsufficiently low temperatures their number is $2^{q}-1$.\n  In this paper we find some regions for the temperature parameter ensuring\nthat a given TISGM is (non-)extreme in the set of all Gibbs measures.\n  In particular we show the existence of a temperature interval for which there\nare at least $2^{q-1} + q$ extremal TISGMs.\n  For the Cayley tree of order two we give explicit formulae and some numerical\nvalues.\n", "  We introduce the Quantum Holonomy-Diffeomorphism *-algebra, which is\ngenerated by holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-dimensional manifold and\ntranslations on a space of SU(2)-connections. We show that this algebra encodes\nthe canonical commutation relations of canonical quantum gravity formulated in\nterms of Ashtekar variables. Furthermore, we show that semi-classical states\nexist on the holonomy-diffeomorphism part of the algebra but that these states\ncannot be extended to the full algebra. Via a Dirac type operator we derive a\ncertain class of unbounded operators that act in the GNS construction of the\nsemi-classical states. These unbounded operators are the type of operators,\nwhich we have previously shown to entail the spatial 3-dimensional Dirac\noperator and Dirac Hamiltonian in a semi-classical limit. Finally, we show that\nthe structure of the Hamilton constraint emerges from a Yang-Mills type\noperator over the space of SU(2)-connections.\n", "  The concept of deterministic dynamical chaos has a long history and is well\nestablished by now. Nevertheless, its field theoretic essence and its\nstochastic generalization have been revealed only very recently. Within the\nnewly found supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS), all stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) possess topological or de Rahm supersymmetry and\nstochastic chaos is the phenomenon of its spontaneous breakdown. Even though\nthe STS is free of approximations and thus is technically solid, it is still\nmissing a firm interpretational basis in order to be physically sound. Here, we\nmake a few important steps toward the construction of the interpretational\nfoundation for the STS. In particular, we discuss that one way to understand\nwhy the ground states of chaotic SDEs are conditional (not total) probability\ndistributions, is that some of the variables have infinite memory of initial\nconditions and thus are not \"thermalized\", i.e., cannot be described by the\ninitial-conditions-independent probability distributions. As a result, the\ndefinitive assumption of physical statistics that the ground state is a\nsteady-state total probability distribution is not valid for chaotic SDEs.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of stochastic processes modeling the growth of\nfirst-order Markov copolymers, as well as the reversed reaction of\ndepolymerization. These processes are ruled by kinetic equations describing\nboth the attachment and detachment of monomers. Exact solutions are obtained\nfor these kinetic equations in the steady regimes of multicomponent\ncopolymerization and depolymerization. Thermodynamic equilibrium is identified\nas the state at which the growth velocity is vanishing on average and where\ndetailed balance is satisfied. Away from equilibrium, the analytical expression\nof the thermodynamic entropy production is deduced in terms of the Shannon\ndisorder per monomer in the copolymer sequence. The Mayo-Lewis equation is\nrecovered in the fully irreversible growth regime. The theory also applies to\nBernoullian chains in the case where the attachment and detachment rates only\ndepend on the reacting monomer.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the consequences of the Renormalization Group\nEquation (RGE) in the determination of the effective superpotential and the\nstudy of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking (DSB) in an N = 1 supersymmetric theory\nincluding an Abelian Chern-Simons superfield coupled to N scalar superfields in\n(2+1) dimensional spacetime. The classical Lagrangian presents scale\ninvariance, which is broken by radiative corrections to the effective\nsuperpotential. We calculate the effective superpotential up to two-loops by\nusing the RGE and the beta functions and anomalous dimensions known in the\nliterature. We then show how the RGE can be used to improve this calculation,\nby summing up properly defined series of leading logs (LL), next-to-leading\nlogs (NLL) contributions, and so on... We conclude that even if the RGE\nimprovement procedure can indeed be applied in a supersymmetric model, the\neffects of the consideration of the RGE are not so dramatic as it happens in\nthe non-supersymmetric case.\n", "  We give an algorithmic introduction to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs)\nusing a newly developed computational engine, LCS Tool. LCSs are most\nrepelling, attracting and shearing material lines that form the centerpieces of\nobserved tracer patterns in two-dimensional unsteady dynamical systems. LCS\nTool implements the latest geodesic theory of LCSs for two-dimensional flows,\nuncovering key transport barriers in unsteady flow velocity data as explicit\nsolutions of differential equations. After a review of the underlying theory,\nwe explain the steps and numerical methods used by LCS Tool, and illustrate its\ncapabilities on three unsteady fluid flow examples.\n", "  An overview is given of recent advances in nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics about the statistics of random paths and current fluctuations.\nAlthough statistics is carried out in space for equilibrium statistical\nmechanics, statistics is considered in time or spacetime for nonequilibrium\nsystems. In this approach, relationships have been established between\nnonequilibrium properties such as the transport coefficients, the thermodynamic\nentropy production, or the affinities, and quantities characterizing the\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics and the chaos or fluctuations it may generate.\nThis overview presents results for classical systems in the escape-rate\nformalism, stochastic processes, and open quantum systems.\n", "  A study is reported of the quantum scattering resonances of dissociating\nmolecules using a semiclassical approach based on periodic-orbit theory. The\ndynamics takes place on a potential energy surface with an energy barrier\nseparating two channels of dissociation. Above the barrier, the unstable\nsymmetric-stretch periodic orbit may undergo a supercritical pitchfork\nbifurcation, leading to a classically chaotic regime. Signatures of the\nbifurcation appear in the spectrum of resonances, which have a shorter lifetime\nthan classically expected. A method is proposed to evaluate semiclassically the\nenergy and lifetime of the quantum resonances in this intermediate regime.\n", "  Generally, the local interactions in a many-body quantum spin system on a\nlattice do not commute with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a\nlocal region will generally not commute with that of the entire system, and so\nthe two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between the\nprobability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global\nHamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these\ntwo Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two\ndistributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an\nenergy $\\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of\neigenstates with energies $\\epsilon<\\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the\nprobability of measuring a global energy $\\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that\nis in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems. Very roughly, we\nshow that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these\ndistributions are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to\nsome exponentially small corrections. Finally, we use these bounds to study the\nspectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the energies of a\ncontiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\\tau$. We\nshow that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially\nclose to that of the original Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result\nin 1D was a central building block in a recent improvement of the 1D area-law.\n", "  Photophoretic motion can transport illuminated particles in protoplanetary\ndisks. In a previous paper we focused on the modeling of steady state\nphotophoretic forces based on the compositions derived from tomography and heat\ntransfer. Here, we present microgravity experiments which deviate significantly\nfrom the steady state calculations of the first paper. The experiments on\naverage show a significantly smaller force than predicted with a large\nvariation in absolute photophoretic force and in the direction of motion with\nrespect to the illumination. Time-dependent modeling of photophoretic forces\nfor heat-up and rotation show that the variations in strength and direction\nobserved can be well explained by the particle reorientation in the limited\nexperiment time of a drop tower experiment. In protoplanetary disks, random\nrotation subsides due to gas friction on short timescales and the results of\nour earlier paper hold. Rotation has a significant influence in short duration\nlaboratory studies. Observing particle motion and rotation under the influence\nof photophoresis can be considered as a basic laboratory analog experiment to\nYarkovsky and YORP effects.\n", "  We address the question of how a localized microscopic defect, especially if\nit is small with respect to certain dynamic parameters, affects the macroscopic\nbehavior of a system. In particular we consider two classical exactly solvable\nmodels: Ulam's problem of the maximal increasing sequence and the totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process. For the first model, using its\nrepresentation as a Poissonian version of directed last passage percolation on\n$\\mathbb R^2$, we introduce the defect by placing a positive density of extra\npoints along the diagonal line. For the latter, the defect is produced by\ndecreasing the jump rate of each particle when it crosses the origin.\n  The powerful algebraic tools for studying these processes break down in the\nperturbed versions of the models. Taking a more geometric approach we show that\nin both cases the presence of an arbitrarily small defect affects the\nmacroscopic behavior of the system: in Ulam's problem the time constant\nincreases, and for the exclusion process the flux of particles decreases. This,\nin particular, settles the longstanding Slow Bond Problem.\n", "  Microwave detectors based on the spin-transfer torque diode effect are among\nthe key emerging spintronic devices. By utilizing the spin of electrons in\naddition to charge, they have the potential to overcome the theoretical\nperformance limits of their semiconductor (Schottky) counterparts, which cannot\noperate at low input power. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale microwave detectors\nexhibiting record-high detection sensitivity of 75400 mV mW$^{-1}$ at room\ntemperature, without any external bias fields, for input microwave power down\nto 10 nW. This sensitivity is 20x and 6x larger than state-of-the-art Schottky\ndiode detectors (3800 mV mW$^{-1}$) and existing spintronic diodes with >1000\nOe magnetic bias (12000 mV mW$^{-1}$), respectively. Micromagnetic simulations\nsupported by microwave emission measurements reveal the essential role of the\ninjection locking to achieve this sensitivity performance. The results enable\ndramatic improvements in the design of low input power microwave detectors,\nwith wide-ranging applications in telecommunications, radars, and smart\nnetworks.\n", "  We consider a generalization of a one-dimensional stochastic process known in\nthe physical literature as L\\'evy-Lorentz gas. The process describes the motion\nof a particle on the real line in the presence of a random array of marked\npoints, whose nearest-neighbor distances are i.i.d. and long-tailed (with\nfinite mean but possibly infinite variance). The motion is a continuous-time,\nconstant-speed interpolation of a symmetric random walk on the marked points.\nWe first study the quenched random walk on the point process, proving the CLT\nand the convergence of all the accordingly rescaled moments. Then we derive the\nquenched and annealed CLTs for the continuous-time process.\n", "  The hormone auxin is actively transported throughout plants via protein\nmachineries including the dedicated transporter known as PIN. The associated\ntransport is ordered with nearby cells driving auxin flux in similar\ndirections. Here we provide a model of both the auxin transport and of the\ndynamics of cellular polarisation based on flux sensing. Our main findings are:\n(i) spontaneous intracellular PIN polarisation arises if PIN recycling dynamics\nare sufficiently non-linear, (ii) there is no need for an auxin concentration\ngradient, and (iii) ordered multi-cellular patterns of PIN polarisation are\nfavored by molecular noise.\n", "  The widely accepted approach to the foundation of quantum mechanics is that\nthe Poisson bracket, governing the non-commutative algebra of operators, is\ntaken as a postulate with no underlying physics. In this manuscript, it is\nshown that this postulation is in fact unnecessary and may be replaced by a few\ndeeper concepts, which ultimately lead to the derivation of Poisson bracket.\nOne would only need to use Fourier transform pairs and Kramers-Kronig\nidentities in the complex domain. We present a definition of Hermitian\ntime-operator and discuss some of its basic properties.\n", "  We employ the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method to study various\naspects of the reactions utilized in searches for superheavy elements. These\ninclude capture cross-sections, quasifission, prediction of $P_{\\mathrm{CN}}$,\nand other interesting dynamical quantities. We show that the microscopic TDHF\napproach provides an important tool to shed some light on the nuclear dynamics\nleading to the formation of superheavy elements.\n", "  Oceanic waves registered by satellite observations often have curvilinear\nfronts and propagate over various currents. In this paper, we study long linear\nand weakly-nonlinear ring waves in a stratified fluid in the presence of a\ndepth-dependent horizontal shear flow. It is shown that despite the clashing\ngeometries of the waves and the shear flow, there exists a linear modal\ndecomposition (different from the known decomposition in Cartesian geometry),\nwhich can be used to describe distortion of the wavefronts of surface and\ninternal waves, and systematically derive a 2+1 - dimensional cylindrical\nKorteweg-de Vries - type equation for the amplitudes of the waves. The general\ntheory is applied to the case of the waves in a two-layer fluid with a\npiecewise-constant current, with an emphasis on the effect of the shear flow on\nthe geometry of the wavefronts. The distortion of the wavefronts is described\nby the singular solution (envelope of the general solution) of the nonlinear\nfirst-order differential equation, constituting generalisation of the\ndispersion relation in this curvilinear geometry. There exists a striking\ndifference in the shape of the wavefronts of surface and interfacial waves\npropagating over the same shear flow.\n", "  In this paper, after reviewing the main points of Haar wavelet transform and\nchaotic trigonometric maps, we introduce a new perspective of Haar wavelet\ntransform. The essential idea of the paper is given linearity properties of the\nscaling function of the Haar wavelet. With regard to applications of Haar\nwavelet transform in image processing, we introduce chaotic trigonometric Haar\nwavelet transform to encrypt the plain images. In addition, the encrypted\nimages based on a proposed algorithm were made. To evaluate the security of the\nencrypted images, the key space analysis, the correlation coefficient analysis\nand differential attack were performed. Here, the chaotic trigonometric Haar\nwavelet transform tries to improve the problem of failure of encryption such as\nsmall key space and level of security.\n", "  Marginal stability is the notion that stability is achieved, but only barely\nso. This property constrains the ensemble of configurations explored at low\ntemperature in a variety of systems, including spin, electron and structural\nglasses. A key feature of marginal states is a (saturated) pseudo-gap in the\ndistribution of soft excitations. We study how such a pseudo-gap appears\ndynamically in the case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass. After\nrevisiting and correcting the multi-spin-flip criterion for local stability, we\nshow that stationarity along the hysteresis loop requires that soft spins are\nfrustrated among each other, with a correlation that diverges as\n$C(\\lambda)\\sim 1/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the larger of two considered\nlocal fields. We explain how this arises spontaneously in a marginal system and\ndevelop an analogy between the spin dynamics in the SK model and random walks\nin two dimensions. We discuss the applicability of these findings to hard\nsphere packings.\n", "  In the typical spatial search problems solved by continuous-time quantum\nwalk, changing the location of the marked vertices does not alter the search\nproblem. In this paper, we consider search when this is no longer true. In\nparticular, we analytically solve search on the \"simplex of $K_M$ complete\ngraphs\" with all configurations of two marked vertices, two configurations of\n$M+1$ marked vertices, and two configurations of $2(M+1)$ marked vertices,\nshowing that the location of the marked vertices can dramatically influence the\nrequired jumping rate of the quantum walk, such that using the wrong\nconfiguration's value can cause the search to fail. This sensitivity to the\njumping rate is an issue unique to continuous-time quantum walks that does not\naffect discrete-time ones.\n", "  Conventional discrete-to-continuum approaches have seen their limitation in\ndescribing the collective behaviour of the multi-polar configurations of\ndislocations, which are widely observed in crystalline materials. The reason is\nthat dislocation dipoles, which play an important role in determining the\nmechanical properties of crystals, often get smeared out when traditional\nhomogenisation methods are applied. To address such difficulties, the\ncollective behaviour of a row of dislocation dipoles is studied by using\nmatched asymptotic techniques. The discrete-to-continuum transition is\nfacilitated by introducing two field variables respectively describing the\ndislocation pair density potential and the dislocation pair width. It is found\nthat the dislocation pair width evolves much faster than the pair density. Such\nhierarchy in evolution time scales enables us to describe the dislocation\ndynamics at the coarse-grained level by an evolution equation for the slowly\nvarying variable (the pair density) coupled with an equilibrium equation for\nthe fast varying variable (the pair width). The time-scale separation method\nadopted here paves a way for properly incorporating dipole-like (zero net\nBurgers vector but non-vanishing) dislocation structures, known as the\nstatistically stored dislocations (SSDs) into macroscopic models of crystal\nplasticity in three dimensions. Moreover, the natural transition between\ndifferent equilibrium patterns found here may also shed light on understanding\nthe emergence of the persistent slip bands (PSBs) in fatigue metals induced by\ncyclic loads.\n", "  The rich physics exhibited by random optical wave fields permitted Hanbury\nBrown and Twiss to unveil fundamental aspects of light. Furthermore, it has\nbeen recognized that optical vortices are ubiquitous in random light and that\nthe phase distribution around these optical singularities inprints a spectrum\nof orbital angular momentum onto a light field. We demonstrate that random\nfluctuations of light give rise to the formation of correlations in the orbital\nangular momentum components and angular positions of pseudothermal light. The\npresence of these correlations is manisfested through distinct interference\nstructures in the orbital angular momentum-mode distribution of random light.\nThese novel forms of interference correspond to the azimuthal analog of the\nHanbury Brown and Twiss effect. This family of effects can be of fundamental\nimportance in applications where entanglement is not required and where\ncorrelations in angular position and orbital angular momentum suffice. We also\nsuggest that the azimuthal Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect can be useful in the\nexploration of novel phenomena in other branches of physics and astrophysics.\n", "  While powerful tools have been developed to analyze quantum query complexity,\nthere are still many natural problems that do not fit neatly into the black box\nmodel of oracles. We create a new model that allows multiple oracles with\ndiffering costs. This model captures more of the difficulty of certain natural\nproblems. We test this model on a simple problem, Search with Two Oracles, for\nwhich we create a quantum algorithm that we prove is asymptotically optimal. We\nfurther give some evidence, using a geometric picture of Grover's algorithm,\nthat our algorithm is exactly optimal.\n", "  We study the breakup of $\\text{H}_2^+$ exposed to super-intense, femtosecond\nlaser pulses with frequencies greater than that corresponding to the ionization\npotential. By solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in an extensive\nfield parameter range, it is revealed that highly nonresonant dissociation\nchannels can dominate over ionization. By considering field-dressed\nBorn-Oppenheimer potential energy curves in the reference frame following a\nfree electron in the field, we propose a simple physical model that\ncharacterizes this dissociation mechanism. The model is used to predict control\nof vibrational excitation, magnitude of the dissociation yields, and nuclear\nkinetic energy release spectra. Finally, the joint energy spectrum for the\nionization process illustrates the energy sharing between the electron and the\nnuclei and the correlation between ionization and dissociation processes.\n", "  Universal computation of a quantum system consisting of superpositions of\nwell-separated coherent states of multiple harmonic oscillators can be achieved\nby three families of adiabatic holonomic gates. The first gate consists of\nmoving a coherent state around a closed path in phase space, resulting in a\nrelative Berry phase between that state and the other states. The second gate\nconsists of \"colliding\" two coherent states of the same oscillator, resulting\nin coherent population transfer between them. The third gate is an effective\ncontrolled-phase gate on coherent states of two different oscillators. Such\ngates should be realizable via reservoir engineering of systems which support\ntunable nonlinearities, such as trapped ions and circuit QED.\n", "  In this study, we investigate quantum nonseparability between an observed\nsystem and a measuring apparatus, or multiple measuring apparatuses. We show\nthat the physical meaning of the outcome of the measuring apparatus obtained by\nweak measurement with a post-selection differs critically from that without any\npost-selection. In this study, the nonseparability plays the essential role,\nwhich is shown to be the same in a simultaneous conventional von Neumann-type\nmeasurement of multiple observables. From this viewpoint, we suggest a new\nconcept, known as {\\it simultaneous readability}, which is the possibility that\nmultiple measuring apparatuses will give the proper information of the observed\nsystem simultaneously. Next, we show that different components of the spin of\nan electron are not simultaneously measurable even if it has EPR correlation\nwith another electron.\n", "  Evolution in its course found a variety of solutions to the same optimisation\nproblem. The advent of high-throughput genomic sequencing has made available\nextensive data from which, in principle, one can infer the underlying structure\non which biological functions rely. In this paper, we present a new method\naimed at extracting sites encoding structural and func- tional properties from\na set of protein primary sequences, namely a Multiple Sequence Alignment. The\nmethod, called Critical Variable Selection, is based on the idea that subsets\nof relevant sites cor- respond to subsequences that occur with a particularly\nbroad frequency distribution in the dataset. By applying this algorithm to in\nsilico sequences, to the Response Regulator Receiver and to the Voltage Sensor\nDomain of Ion Channels, we show that this procedure recovers not only\ninformation encoded in single site statistics and pairwise correlations but it\nalso captures dependencies going beyond pairwise correlations. The method\nproposed here is complementary to Statistical Coupling Analysis, in that the\nmost relevant sites predicted by the two methods markedly differ. We find\nrobust and consistent results for datasets as small as few hundred sequences,\nthat reveal a hidden hierarchy of sites that is consistent with present\nknowledge on biologically relevant sites and evo- lutionary dynamics. This\nsuggests that Critical Variable Selection is able to identify in a Multiple\nSequence Alignment a core of sites encoding functional and structural\ninformation.\n", "  In many real-world complex systems, the time-evolution of the network's\nstructure and the dynamic state of its nodes are closely entangled. Here, we\nstudy opinion formation and imitation on an adaptive complex network which is\ndependent on the individual dynamic state of each node and vice versa to model\nthe co-evolution of renewable resources with the dynamics of harvesting agents\non a social network. The adaptive voter model is coupled to a set of identical\nlogistic growth models and we show that in such systems, the rate of\ninteractions between nodes as well as the adaptive rewiring probability play a\ncrucial role for the sustainability of the system's equilibrium state. We\nderive a macroscopic description of the system which provides a general\nframework to model and quantify the influence of single node dynamics on the\nmacroscopic state of the network and is applicable to many fields of study,\nsuch as epidemic spreading or social modeling.\n", "  Protein-surface interactions are ubiquitous in biological processes and\nbioengineering, yet are not fully understood. In biosensors, a key factor\ndetermining the sensitivity and thus the performance of the device is the\norientation of the ligand molecules on the bioactive device surface. Adsorption\nstudies thus seek to determine how orientation can be influenced by surface\npreparation. In this work, protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces is\nobtained under electrostatic effects using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in\nan implicit-solvent model. Sampling the free energy for protein GB1D4' at a\nrange of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we\ncalculated the probability of the protein orientations and observed a dipolar\nbehavior. This result is consistent with published experimental studies and\ncombined Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations using this small\nprotein, validating our method. More relevant to biosensor technology,\nantibodies such as immunoglobulin G are still a formidable challenge to\nmolecular simulation, due to their large size. We obtained the probability\ndistribution of orientations for the iso-type IgG2a at varying surface charge\nand salt concentration. This iso-type was not found to have a preferred\norientation in previous studies, unlike the iso-type IgG1 whose larger dipole\nmoment was assumed to make it easier to control. We find that the preferred\norientation of IgG2a can be favorable for biosensing with positive surface\ncharge of 0.05C/m$^{2}$ or higher and 37mM salt concentration. The results also\nshow that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein.\nImproving immunoassay sensitivity may thus be assisted by numerical studies\nusing our method (and open-source code), guiding changes to fabrication\nprotocols or protein engineering of ligand molecules to obtain more favorable\norientations.\n", "  We develop a new approach to building cosmological models, in which small\npieces of perturbed Minkowski space are joined together at reflection-symmetric\nboundaries in order to form a global, dynamical space-time. Each piece of this\npatchwork universe is described using post-Newtonian gravitational physics,\nwith the large-scale expansion of the universe being an emergent phenomenon.\nThis approach to cosmology does not require any assumptions about non-local\naveraging processes. Our framework clarifies the relation between the\nweak-field limit of general relativity, and the cosmological solutions that\nresult from solving Einstein's equations with a set of symmetry assumptions. It\nalso allows the effects of structure formation on the large-scale expansion of\nthe universe to be investigated in an unambiguous way. As an explicit example,\nwe use this formalism to investigate the cosmological behaviour of a large\nnumber of regularly arranged point-like masses. In this case we find that the\nlarge-scale expansion is well modelled by a Friedmann-like equation that\ncontains terms that take the form of dust, radiation, and spatial curvature.\nThe radiation term, while small compared to the dust term, is purely a result\nof the non-linearity of Einstein's equations.\n", "  We obtain the complete phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$\nmodel, $0\\leq \\alpha = J_2/J1 \\leq 1$, within the framework of the $O(N)$\nnonlinear sigma model. We find two magnetically ordered phases, one with N\\'\neel order, for $\\alpha \\leq 0.4$, and another with collinear order, for\n$\\alpha\\geq 0.6$, separated by a nonmagnetic region, for $0.4\\leq \\alpha \\leq\n0.6$, where a gapped spin liquid is found. The transition at $\\alpha=0.4$ is of\nthe second order while the one at $\\alpha=0.6$ is of the first order and the\nspin gaps cross at $\\alpha=0.5$. Our results are exact at $N\\rightarrow\\infty$\nand agree with numerical results from different methods.\n", "  Fluctuations in a stellar system's gravitational field cause the orbits of\nstars to evolve. The resulting evolution of the system can be computed with the\norbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation once the diffusion tensor is known. We\npresent the formalism that enables one to compute the diffusion tensor from a\ngiven source of noise in the gravitational field when the system's dynamical\nresponse to that noise is included. In the case of a cool stellar disc we are\nable to reduce the computation of the diffusion tensor to a one-dimensional\nintegral. We implement this formula for a tapered Mestel disc that is exposed\nto shot noise and find that we are able to explain analytically the principal\nfeatures of a numerical simulation of such a disc. In particular the formation\nof narrow ridges of enhanced density in action space is recovered. As the\ndisc's value of Toomre's $Q$ is reduced and the disc becomes more responsive,\nthere is a transition from a regime of heating in the inner regions of the disc\nthrough the inner Lindblad resonance to one of radial migration of\nnear-circular orbits via the corotation resonance in the intermediate regions\nof the disc. The formalism developed here provides the ideal framework in which\nto study the long-term evolution of all kinds of stellar discs.\n", "  We present distributions of two molecular clouds having velocities of 2 km\ns$^{-1}$ and 14 km s$^{-1}$ toward RCW 38, the youngest super star cluster in\nthe Milky Way, in the $^{12}$CO ($J=$1--0 and 3--2) and $^{13}$CO ($J=$1--0)\ntransitions. The two clouds are likely physically associated with the cluster\nas verified by the high intensity ratio of the $J$=3--2 emission to the\n$J$=1--0 emission, the bridging feature connecting the two clouds in velocity\nand their morphological correspondence with the infrared dust emission. The\ntotal mass of the clouds and the cluster is too small to gravitationally bind\nthe velocity difference. We frame a hypothesis that the two clouds are\ncolliding with each other by chance to trigger formation of the $\\sim$20\ncandidate O stars which are localized within $\\sim$0.3 pc of the cluster center\nin the 2 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. We suggest that the collision is currently\ncontinuing toward part of the 2 km s$^{-1}$ cloud where the bridging feature is\nlocalized. This is the third super star cluster alongside of Westerlund2 and\nNGC3603 where cloud-cloud collision triggered the cluster formation. RCW38 is\nthe most remarkable and youngest cluster, holding a possible sign of on-going O\nstar formation, and is the most promising site where we may be able to witness\nthe moment of O-star formation.\n", "  A rigid object of general shape is fixed inside a wind tunnel. The drag force\nexerted on it by the wind is determined by a new method based on simple basic\nPhysics concepts, provided one has a solver, any solver, for the corresponding\ndynamic Navier-Stokes equation which determines the wind velocity field around\nthe object. The method is completely general, but here we apply it to the\ntraditional problem of a long cylinder perpendicular to the wind.\n", "  Detection of symmetry is vital to problem solving. Most of the problems of\ncomputer vision and computer graphics and machine intelligence in general, can\nbe reduced to symmetry detection problem. Unstructured search problem can also\nbe looked upon from symmetry detection point of view. Unstructured search can\nbe thought as searching a binary string satisfying some search condition in an\nunsorted list of binary strings. In this paper unstructured search problem is\nreduced to function bilateral symmetry detection problem with polynomial\noverhead in terms of the size of the input.\n  Keywords: Unstructured Search, Quantum algorithm, Function bilateral symmetry\ndetection, Decision Problem, Quantum Black Box, Solving NP complete problems.\n", "  We simulate a phase-separating a bilayer in which the leaflets experience a\ndirect coupling favouring local compositional symmetry (\"registered\" bilayer\nphases), and an indirect coupling due to hydrophobic mismatch that favours\nstrong local asymmetry (\"antiregistered\" bilayer phases). For wide ranges of\noverall leaflet compositions, multiple competing states are possible. For\nestimated physical parameters, a quenched bilayer may first evolve toward a\nmetastable state more asymmetric than if the leaflets were uncorrelated;\\\nsubsequently, it must nucleate to reach its equilibrium, more symmetric, state.\nThese phase-transition kinetics exhibit characteristic signatures through which\nfundamental and opposing inter-leaflet interactions may be probed. We emphasise\nhow bilayer phase diagrams with a separate axis for each leaflet can account\nfor overall and local symmetry/asymmetry, and capture a range of observations\nin the experiment and simulation literature.\n", "  We briefly review the recent advances in the rheology of entangled polymers\nand identify emerging research trends and outstanding challenges, especially\nwith respect to branched polymers. Emphasis is placed on the role of\nwell-characterized model systems, as well as the synergy of\nsynthesis-characterization, rheometry and modeling/simulations. The theoretical\nframework for understanding the observed linear and nonlinear rheological\nphenomena is the tube model which is critically assessed in view of its\nsuccesses and shortcomings, whereas alternative approaches are briefly\ndiscussed. Finally, intriguing experimental findings and controversial issues\nthat merit consistent explanation, such as shear banding instabilities,\nmultiple stress overshoots in transient simple shear and enhanced steady-state\nelongational viscosity in polymer solutions, are discussed, whereas future\ndirections such as branch point dynamics and anisotropic monomeric friction are\noutlined.\n", "  The time evolution of magnetization induced by circularly polarized light in\na $S=1$ Heisenberg chain with large, easy--plane anisotropy is studied\nnumerically and analytically. Results at constant light frequency\n$\\Omega=\\Omega_0$ are interpreted in terms of absorption lines of the\nelectronic spin resonance spectrum. Applying a time dependent light frequency\n$\\Omega=\\Omega(t)$, so called chirping, is shown to be an efficient procedure\nin order to obtain within a short time a large, controlled value of the\nmagnetization $M^z$. Furthermore, comparison with a $2$ - level model provides\na qualitative understanding of the induced magnetization process.\n", "  We consider the non-minimally kinetic coupled version of DGP brane model,\nwhere the kinetic term of the scalar field is coupled to the metric and\nEinstein tensor on the brane by a coupling constant $\\zeta$. We obtain the\ncorresponding field equations, using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric and\nthe perfect fluid, and study the inflationary scenario to confront the\nnumerical analysis of six typical scalar field potentials with the current\nobservational results. We find that among the suggested potentials and coupling\nconstants, subject to the e-folding $N=60$, the potentials\n$V(\\phi)=\\sigma\\phi$, $V(\\phi)=\\sigma\\phi^2$ and $V(\\phi)=\\sigma\\phi^3$ provide\nthe best fits with both Planck+WP+highL data and Planck+WP+highL+BICEP2 data.\n", "  Quantum state space is endowed with a metric structure and Riemannian\nmonotone metric is an important geometric entity defined on such a metric\nspace. Riemannian monotone metrics are very useful for information-theoretic\nand statistical considerations on the quantum state space. In this article,\nconsidering the quantum state space being spanned by 2x2 density matrices, we\ndetermine a particular Riemannian metric for a state \\r{ho} and show that if\n\\r{ho} gets entangled with another quantum state, the negativity of the\ngenerated entangled state is, upto a constant factor, equals to square root of\nthat particular Riemannian metric . Our result clearly relates a geometric\nquantity to a measure of entanglement. Moreover, the result establishes the\npossibility of understanding quantum correlations through geometric approach.\n", "  A variant for the superspin one-half massive superparticle in $ 4D $, $\n\\mathcal{N}=1 $, based on Dirac superfields, is offered. As opposed to the\ncurrent known models that use spinor chiral superfields, the propagating fields\nof the supermultiplet are those of the lowest mass dimensions possible: scalar,\nDirac and vector fields. Besides the supersymmetric chiral condition, the Dirac\nsuperfields are not further constrained, allowing a very straightforward\nimplementation of the path-integral method. The corresponding superpropagators\nare presented. In addition, an interaction super Yukawa potential, formed by\nDirac and scalar chiral superfields, is given in terms of their component\nfields. The model is first presented for the case of two superspin one-half\nsuperparticles related by the charged conjugation operator, but in order to\ntreat the case of neutral superparticles, the Majorana condition on the Dirac\nsuperfields is also studied. We compare our proposal with the known models of\nspinor superfields for the one-half superparticle and show that it is\nequivalent to them.\n", "  The condensation of scalar bilinear in a classically scale invariant strongly\ninteracting hidden sector is used to generate the electroweak scale, where the\nexcitation of the condensate is identified as dark matter. We formulate an\neffective theory for the condensation of the scalar bilinear and find in the\nself-consistent mean field approximation that the dark matter mass is of $O(1)$\nTeV with the spin-independent elastic cross section off the nucleon slightly\nbelow the LUX upper bound.\n", "  Skyrmions are topologically protected entities in magnetic materials which\nhave the potential to be used in spintronics for information storage and\nprocessing. However, Skyrmions in ferromagnets have some intrinsic difficulties\nwhich must be overcome to use them for spintronic applications, such as the\ninability to move straight along current. We show that Skyrmions can also be\nstabilized and manipulated in antiferromagnetic materials. An antiferromagnetic\nSkyrmion is a compound topological object with a similar but of opposite sign\nspin texture on each sublattice, which e.g. results in a complete cancelation\nof the Magnus force. We find that the composite nature of antiferromagnetic\nSkyrmions gives rise to different dynamical behavior, both due to an applied\ncurrent and temperature effects.\n", "  A comparison of the differential cross sections for the processes Z/gamma* +\njets and photon (gamma) + jets is presented. The measurements are based on data\ncollected with the CMS detector at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The differential cross\nsections and their ratios are presented as functions of pt. The measurements\nare also shown as functions of the jet multiplicity. Differential cross\nsections are obtained as functions of the ratio of the Z/gamma* pt to the sum\nof all jet transverse momenta and of the ratio of the Z/gamma* pt to the\nleading jet transverse momentum. The data are corrected for detector effects\nand are compared to simulations based on several QCD calculations.\n", "  The abstract theory of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators is used\nto construct self-adjoint realizations of a second-order elliptic operator on\n$\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with linear boundary conditions on (a relatively open part of)\na compact hypersurface. Our approach allows to obtain Krein-like resolvent\nformulas where the reference operator coincides with the \"free\" operator with\ndomain $H^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$; this provides an useful tool for the scattering\nproblem from a hypersurface. Concrete examples of this construction are\ndeveloped in connection with the standard boundary conditions, Dirichlet,\nNeumann, Robin, $\\delta$ and $\\delta^{\\prime}$-type, assigned either on a $n-1$\ndimensional compact boundary $\\Gamma=\\partial\\Omega$ or on a relatively open\npart $\\Sigma\\subset\\Gamma$. Schatten-von Neumann estimates for the difference\nof the powers of resolvents of the free and the perturbed operators are also\nproven; these give existence and completeness of the wave operators of the\nassociated scattering systems.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a phonon-mediated superconductor driven out of\nequilibrium. The electronic hopping amplitude is ramped down in time, resulting\nin an increased electronic density of states. The dynamics of the coupled\nelectron-phonon model is investigated by solving Migdal-Eliashberg equations\nfor the double-time Keldysh Green's functions. The increase of the density of\nstates near the Fermi level leads to an enhancement of superconductivity when\nthe system thermalizes to the new state at the same temperature. We provide a\ntime- and momentum-resolved view on this thermalization process, and show that\nit involves fast processes associated with single-particle scattering and much\nslower dynamics associated with the superconducting order parameter. The\nimportance of electron-phonon coupling for the rapid enhancement and the\nefficient thermalization of superconductivity is demonstrated, and the results\nare compared to a BCS time-dependent mean-field approximation.\n", "  We describe the mathematical scheme for an anomaly-free ideal spectrometer,\nbased on a 2-dimensional plane medium with conical regions of bounded slope.\nMoreover, the construction may be realised in many different configurations.\n", "  We give an exhaustive description of bifurcations and of the number of\nsolutions of the vacuum Lichnerowicz equation with positive cosmological\nconstant on $S^1\\times S^2$ with $U(1)\\times SO(3)$-invariant seed data. The\nresulting CMC slicings of Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Nariai are described.\n", "  We study the kinetics governing the attainment of inter-leaflet domain\nsymmetry in a phase-separating amphiphilic bilayer. \"Indirect\" inter-leaflet\ncoupling via hydrophobic mismatch can induce an instability towards a\nmetastable pattern of locally asymmetric domains upon quenching from high\ntemperature. This necessitates a nucleation step to form the conventional\nsymmetric pattern of domains, which are favoured by a \"direct\" inter-leaflet\ncoupling. We model the energetics for a symmetric domain to nucleate from the\nmetastable state, and find that an interplay between hydrophobic mismatch and\nthickness stretching/compression causes the effective hydrophobic mismatch, and\nthus line tension, to depend on domain size. This leads to strong departure\nfrom classical nucleation theory. We speculate on implications for cell\nmembrane rafts or clusters, whose size may be of similar magnitude to estimated\ncritical radii for domain symmetry.\n", "  Hysteresis is a phenomenon occurring naturally in several magnetic and\nelectric materials in condensed matter physics. When applied to cosmology, aka\ncosmological hysteresis, has interesting and vivid implications in the scenario\nof a cyclic bouncy universe. Most importantly, this physical prescription can\nbe treated as an alternative proposal to inflationary paradigm. Cosmological\nhysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state parameter during\nexpansion and contraction phase of the universe, due to the presence of a\nsingle scalar field. This process is purely thermodynamical in nature, results\nin a non-vanishing hysteresis loop integral $(\\oint pdV)$ in cosmology. When\napplied to variants of modified gravity models -1) Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati\n(DGP) brane world gravity, 2) Cosmological constant dominated Einstein gravity,\n3) Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), 4) Einstien-Gauss-Bonnet brane world gravity and\n5) Randall Sundrum single brane world gravity (RSII), under certain\ncircumstances, this phenomenon leads to the increase in amplitude of the\nconsecutive cycles and to a universe with older and larger successive cycles,\nprovided we have physical mechanisms to make the universe bounce and\nturnaround. This inculcates an arrow of time in a dissipationless cosmology.\nRemarkably, this phenomenon appears to be widespread in several cosmological\npotentials in variants of modified gravity background, which we explicitly\nstudy for- i) Hilltop, ii) Natural and iii) Colemann-Weinberg potentials, in\nthis paper. Semi-analytical analysis of these models, for different potentials\nwith minimum/minima, show that the conditions which creates a universe with an\never increasing expansion, depend on the signature of the hysteresis loop\nintegral $(\\oint pdV)$ as well as on the variants of model parameters.\n", "  We propose a scheme to dynamically synthesize a space-periodic effective\nmagnetic field for neutral atoms by time-periodic magnetic field pulses. When\natomic spin adiabatically follows the direction of the effective magnetic\nfield, an adiabatic scalar potential together with a geometric vector potential\nemerges for the atomic center-of-mass motion, due to the Berry phase effect.\nWhile atoms hop between honeycomb lattice sites formed by the minima of the\nadiabatic potential, complex Peierls phase factors in the hopping coefficients\nare induced by the vector potential, which facilitate a topological Chern\ninsulator. With further tuning of external parameters, both a topological phase\ntransition and topological flat bands can be achieved, highlighting realistic\nprospects for studying strongly correlated phenomena in this system. Our Letter\npresents an alternative pathway towards creating and manipulating topological\nstates of ultracold atoms by magnetic fields.\n", "  Odd-even effects, also known as \"staggering\" effects, are a common feature\nobserved in the yield distributions of fragments produced in different types of\nnuclear reactions. We review old methods, and we propose new ones, for a\nquantitative estimation of these effects as a function of proton or neutron\nnumber of the reaction products. All methods are compared on the basis of Monte\nCarlo simulations. We find that some are not well suited for the task, the most\nreliable ones being those based either on a non-linear fit with a properly\noscillating function or on a third (or fourth) finite difference approach. In\nany case, high statistic is of paramount importance to avoid that spurious\nstructures appear just because of statistical fluctuations in the data and of\nstrong correlations among the yields of neighboring fragments.\n", "  Spin-wave technology (magnonics) has the potential to further reduce the size\nand energy consumption of information processing devices. In the submicrometer\nregime (exchange spin waves), topological defects such as domain walls may\nconstitute active elements to manipulate spin waves and perform logic\noperations. We predict that spin waves that pass through a domain wall in an\nultrathin perpendicular-anisotropy film experience a phase shift that depends\non the orientation of the domain wall (chirality). The effect, which is absent\nin bulk materials, originates from the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction and can be interpreted as a geometric phase. We demonstrate\nanalytically and by means of micromagnetic simulations that the phase shift is\nstrong enough to switch between constructive and destructive interference. The\ntwo chirality states of the domain wall may serve as a memory bit or spin-wave\nswitch in magnonic devices.\n", "  Transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) spectra of pions, kaons, and protons up to\n$p_{\\rm{T}} = 20$ GeV/$c$ have been measured in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV using the ALICE detector for six different\ncentrality classes covering 0-80%. The proton-to-pion and the kaon-to-pion\nratios both show a distinct peak at $p_{\\rm{T}} \\approx 3$ GeV/$c$ in central\nPb-Pb collisions that decreases towards more peripheral collisions. For\n$p_{\\rm{T}} > 10$ GeV/$c$, the nuclear modification factor is found to be the\nsame for all three particle species in each centrality interval within\nsystematic uncertainties of 10-20%. This suggests there is no direct interplay\nbetween the energy loss in the medium and the particle species composition in\nthe hard core of the quenched jet. For $p_{\\rm{T}} < 10$ GeV/$c$, the data\nprovide important constraints for models aimed at describing the transition\nfrom soft to hard physics.\n", "  Cooper's one pair problem is investigated for a 2D lattice in the background\nof both passive and active Fermi sea in a weakly correlated environment. Boson\nexchange mechanisms involving excitons as well as phonons are invoked for\npairing in the s- wave channel. The important quantities calculated are pairing\nenergy and coherence length as functions of bosonic energy, attracted coupling\nconstant and band filling factor. Comparison of our theoretical results with\nthose from experiments on overdoped cuprate superconductors and other type of\ntheoretical calculations show electronic mechanism to be the more likely\nmechanism of pairing in the overdoped phase.\n", "  Aims: We present a study of the Be/X-ray binary system V 0332+53 with the\nmain goal of characterizing its behavior mainly during the\nintermediate-luminosity X-ray event on 2008. In addition, we aim to contribute\nto the understanding of the global behavior of the donor companion by including\noptical data from our dedicated campaign starting on 2006. Methods: V 0332+53\nwas observed by RXTE and Swift during the decay of the intermediate-luminosity\nX-ray outburst of 2008, as well as with Suzaku before the rising of the third\nnormal outburst of the 2010 series. In addition, we present recent data from\nthe Spanish ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife),\nRoque de los Muchachos (La Palma), and Sierra Nevada (Granada), and since 2006\nfrom the Turkish TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya). We have performed\ntemporal analyses to investigate the transient behaviour of this system during\nseveral outbursts. Results: Our optical study revealed that continuous mass\nejection episodes from the Be star have been taking place since 2006 and\nanother one is currently ongoing. The broad-band 1-60 keV X-ray spectrum of the\nneutron star during the decay of the 2008 outburst was well fitted with\nstandard phenomenological models, enhanced by an absorption feature of unknown\norigin at about 10 keV and a narrow iron K-alpha fluorescence line at 6.4 keV.\nFor the first time in V 0332+53 we tentatively see an increase of the cyclotron\nline energy with increasing flux (although further and more sensitive\nobservations are needed to confirm this). Regarding the fast aperiodic\nvariability, we detect a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) at 227+-9 mHz only\nduring the lowest luminosities. The latter fact might indicate that the inner\nregions surrounding the magnetosphere are more visible during the lowest flux\nstates.\n", "  The production of (anti-)deuteron and (anti-)$^{3}$He nuclei in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV has been studied using the ALICE\ndetector at the LHC. The spectra exhibit a significant hardening with\nincreasing centrality. Combined blast-wave fits of several particles support\nthe interpretation that this behavior is caused by an increase of radial flow.\nThe integrated particle yields are discussed in the context of coalescence and\nthermal-statistical model expectations. The particle ratios, $^3$He/d and\n$^3$He/p, in Pb-Pb collisions are found to be in agreement with a common\nchemical freeze-out temperature of $T_{\\rm chem} \\approx 156$ MeV. These ratios\ndo not vary with centrality which is in agreement with the thermal-statistical\nmodel. In a coalescence approach, it excludes models in which nucleus\nproduction is proportional to the particle multiplicity and favors those in\nwhich it is proportional to the particle density instead. In addition, the\nobservation of 31 anti-tritons in Pb-Pb collisions is reported. For comparison,\nthe deuteron spectrum in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is also presented.\nWhile the p/$\\pi$ ratio is similar in pp and Pb-Pb collisions, the d/p ratio in\npp collisions is found to be lower by a factor of 2.2 than in Pb-Pb collisions.\n", "  The uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) are the dominant\nsource of the systematic uncertainty in precision measurements of electroweak\nparameters at hadron colliders (e.g. $\\sin^2\\theta_{eff}(M_Z)$,\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{W}=1-M_W^2/M_Z^2$ and the mass of the W boson). We show that\nmeasurements of the forward-backward charge asymmetry ($A_{FB}(M,y)$) of\nDrell-Yan dilepton events produced at hadron colliders provide a new powerful\ntool to reduce the PDF uncertainties in these measurements.\n", "  The t t-bar charge asymmetry is measured in proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data, collected with the CMS experiment at\nthe LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns.\nSelected events contain an electron or a muon and four or more jets, where at\nleast one jet is identified as originating from b-quark hadronization. The\ninclusive charge asymmetry is found to be 0.0010 +/- 0.0068 (stat) +/- 0.0037\n(syst). In addition, differential charge asymmetries as a function of rapidity,\ntransverse momentum, and invariant mass of the t t-bar system are studied. For\nthe first time at the LHC, the measurements are also performed in a reduced\nfiducial phase space of top quark pair production, with an integrated result of\n-0.0035 +/- 0.0072 (stat) +/- 0.0031 (syst). All measurements are consistent\nwithin two standard deviations with zero asymmetry as well as with the\npredictions of the standard model.\n", "  The electron-phonon coupling and the corresponding energy exchange was\ninvestigated experimentally and by ab initio theory in non-equilibrium states\nof the free-electron metal aluminium. The temporal evolution of the atomic mean\nsquared displacement in laser-excited thin free-standing films was monitored by\nfemtosecond electron diffraction. The electron-phonon coupling strength was\nobtained for a range of electronic and lattice temperatures from density\nfunctional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations. The electron-phonon\ncoupling parameter extracted from the experimental data in the framework of a\ntwo-temperature model (TTM) deviates significantly from the ab initio values.\nWe introduce a non-thermal lattice model (NLM) for describing non-thermal\nphonon distributions as a sum of thermal distributions of the three phonon\nbranches. The contributions of individual phonon branches to the\nelectron-phonon coupling are considered independently and found to be dominated\nby longitudinal acoustic phonons. Using all material parameters from\nfirst-principle calculations besides the phonon-phonon coupling strength, the\nprediction of the energy transfer from electrons to phonons by the NLM is in\nexcellent agreement with time-resolved diffraction data. Our results suggest\nthat the TTM is insufficient for describing the microscopic energy flow even\nfor simple metals like aluminium and that the determination of the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant from time-resolved experiments by means of\nthe TTM leads to incorrect values. In contrast, the NLM describing transient\nphonon populations by three parameters appears to be a sufficient model for\nquantitatively describing electron-lattice equilibration in aluminium. We\ndiscuss the general applicability of the NLM and provide a criterion for the\nsuitability of the two-temperature approximation for other metals.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the adaptive tetrahedral integration over the\nBrillouin zone of crystalline materials, and apply it to compute the optical\nconductivity, dc conductivity, and thermopower. For these quantities, whose\ncontributions are often localized in small portions of the Brillouin zone,\nadaptive integration is especially relevant. Our implementation, the woptic\npackage, is tied into the wien2wannier framework and allows including a\nmany-body self energy, e.g. from dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Wannier\nfunctions and dipole matrix elements are computed with the DFT package Wien2k\nand Wannier90. For illustration, we show DFT results for fcc-Al and DMFT\nresults for the correlated metal SrVO$_3$.\n", "  We report several major theoretical steps towards realizing stable\nlong-distance multichannel soliton transmission in Kerr nonlinear waveguide\nloops. We find that transmission destabilization in a single waveguide is\ncaused by resonant formation of radiative sidebands and investigate the\npossibility to increase transmission stability by optimization with respect to\nthe Kerr nonlinearity coefficient $\\gamma$. Moreover, we develop a general\nmethod for transmission stabilization, based on frequency dependent linear\ngain-loss in Kerr nonlinear waveguide couplers, and implement it in two-channel\nand three-channel transmission. We show that the introduction of frequency\ndependent loss leads to significant enhancement of transmission stability even\nfor non-optimal $\\gamma$ values via decay of radiative sidebands, which takes\nplace as a dynamic phase transition. For waveguide couplers with frequency\ndependent linear gain-loss, we observe stable oscillations of soliton\namplitudes due to decay and regeneration of the radiative sidebands.\n", "  We report on results obtained with the Event Shape Engineering technique\napplied to Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\rm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. By selecting events\nin the same centrality interval, but with very different average flow,\ndifferent initial state conditions can be studied. We find the effect of the\nevent-shape selection on the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ to be almost\nindependent of transverse momentum $p_\\rm{T}$, as expected if this effect is\ndue to fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system. Charged hadron,\npion, kaon, and proton transverse momentum distributions are found to be harder\nin events with higher-than-average elliptic flow, indicating an interplay\nbetween radial and elliptic flow.\n", "  The cyclic deformation behavior of extruded Mg-8.5wt.%Al alloy with a\nconventional extrusion texture and a modified texture is systematically\ninvestigated by in-situ neutron diffraction and elastic viscoplastic\nself-consistent (EVPSC) modeling incorporating a twinning/de-twinning (TDT)\nscheme. The role of twinning and de-twinning on the deformation behavior of\nMg-8.5wt.% Al alloy is investigated in terms of the macroscopic stress-strain\nresponse, the evolution of the activities of various deformation mechanisms,\nthe texture evolution, the evolution of the internal elastic strains, and the\nevolution of the diffraction peak intensities. The alloy with the conventional\nextrusion texture undergoes twinning during initial compression and de-twinning\nduring reverse tension. The same alloy does not favor twinning during initial\ntension, but rather during reverse compression. The alloy with a modified\ntexture undergoes twinning during initial tension followed by detwinning during\nreverse compression. The results provide insights into the effect of initial\ntexture, loading path, slip, twinning, de-twinning on the cyclic behavior of\nmagnesium.\n", "  We model the unsteady evolution of turbulent buoyant plumes following\ntemporal changes to the source conditions. The integral model is derived from\nradial integration of the governing equations expressing the conservation of\nmass, axial momentum and buoyancy. The non-uniform radial profiles of the axial\nvelocity and density deficit in the plume are explicitly described by shape\nfactors in the integral equations; the commonly-assumed top-hat profiles lead\nto shape factors equal to unity. The resultant model is hyperbolic when the\nmomentum shape factor, determined from the radial profile of the mean axial\nvelocity, differs from unity. The solutions of the model when source conditions\nare maintained at constant values retain the form of the well-established\nsteady plume solutions. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a momentum shape\nfactor that differs from unity leads to a well-posed integral model. Therefore,\nour model does not exhibit the mathematical pathologies that appear in\npreviously proposed unsteady integral models of turbulent plumes. A stability\nthreshold for the value of the shape factor is identified, resulting in a range\nof its values where the amplitude of small perturbations to the steady\nsolutions decay with distance from the source. The hyperbolic character of the\nsystem allows the formation of discontinuities in the fields describing the\nplume properties during the unsteady evolution. We compute numerical solutions\nto illustrate the transient development following an abrupt change in the\nsource conditions. The adjustment to the new source conditions occurs through\nthe propagation of a pulse of fluid through the plume. The dynamics of this\npulse are described by a similarity solution and, by constructing this new\nsimilarity solution, we identify three regimes in which the evolution of the\ntransient pulse following adjustment of the source qualitatively differ.\n", "  We introduce a binary relation on the finite discrete probability\ndistributions which generalizes notions of majorization that have been studied\nin quantum information theory. Motivated by questions in thermodynamics, our\nrelation describes the transitions induced by bistochastic maps in the presence\nof additional auxiliary systems which may become correlated in the process. We\nshow that this relation is completely characterized by Shannon entropy H, which\nyields an interpretation of H in resource-theoretic terms, and admits a\nparticularly simple proof of a known characterization of H in terms of natural\ninformation-theoretic properties.\n", "  Disordered biopolymer gels have striking mechanical properties including\nstrong nonlinearities. In the case of athermal gels (such as collagen-I) the\nnonlinearity has long been associated with a crossover from a bending dominated\nto a stretching dominated regime of elasticity. The physics of this crossover\nis related to the existence of a central-force isostatic point and to the fact\nthat for most gels the bending modulus is small. This crossover induces scaling\nbehavior for the elastic moduli. In particular, for linear elasticity such a\nscaling law has been demonstrated [Broedersz et al. Nature Physics, 2011 7,\n983]. In this work we generalize the scaling to the nonlinear regime with a\ntwo-parameter scaling law involving three critical exponents. We test the\nscaling law numerically for two disordered lattice models, and find a good\nscaling collapse for the shear modulus in both the linear and nonlinear\nregimes. We compute all the critical exponents for the two lattice models and\ndiscuss the applicability of our results to real systems.\n", "  We present a determination of the isovector, $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ scattering\nphase shift obtained by extrapolating recent lattice QCD results from the\nHadron Spectrum Collaboration using $m_\\pi =236$ MeV. The finite volume spectra\nare described using extensions of L\\\"uscher's method to determine the infinite\nvolume Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory scattering amplitude. We exploit\nthe pion mass dependence of this effective theory to obtain the scattering\namplitude at $m_\\pi= 140$ MeV. The scattering phase shift is found to be in\ngood agreement with experiment up to center of mass energies of 1.2 GeV. The\nanalytic continuation of the scattering amplitude to the complex plane yields a\n$\\rho$-resonance pole at $E_\\rho=\n\\left[755(2)(1)(^{20}_{02})-\\frac{i}{2}\\,129(3)(1)(^{7}_{1})\\right]~{\\rm MeV}$.\nThe techniques presented illustrate a possible pathway towards connecting\nlattice QCD observables of few-body, strongly interacting systems to\nexperimentally accessible quantities.\n", "  As a perturbative check of the construction of four-dimensional (4D) ${\\cal\nN}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) from mass deformed ${\\cal\nN}=(8,8)$ SYM on the two-dimensional (2D) lattice, the one-loop effective\naction for scalar kinetic terms is computed in ${\\cal N}=4$ $U(k)$ SYM on\n${\\mathbb R}^2 \\times$ (fuzzy $S^2$), which is obtained by expanding 2D ${\\cal\nN}=(8,8)$ $U(N)$ SYM with mass deformation around its fuzzy sphere classical\nsolution. The radius of the fuzzy sphere is proportional to the inverse of the\nmass. We consider two successive limits: (1) decompactify the fuzzy sphere to a\nnoncommutative (Moyal) plane and (2) turn off the noncommutativity of the Moyal\nplane. It is straightforward at the classical level to obtain the ordinary\n${\\cal N}=4$ SYM on ${\\mathbb R}^4$ in the limits, while it is nontrivial at\nthe quantum level. The one-loop effective action for $SU(k)$ sector of the\ngauge group $U(k)$ coincides with that of the ordinary 4D ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM in\nthe above limits. Although \"noncommutative anomaly\" appears in the overall\n$U(1)$ sector of the $U(k)$ gauge group, this can be expected to be a gauge\nartifact not affecting gauge invariant observables.\n", "  A conservative discretization of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is\ndeveloped based on discrete exterior calculus (DEC). A distinguishing feature\nof our method is the use of an algebraic discretization of the interior product\noperator and a combinatorial discretization of the wedge product. The governing\nequations are first rewritten using the exterior calculus notation, replacing\nvector calculus differential operators by the exterior derivative, Hodge star\nand wedge product operators. The discretization is then carried out by\nsubstituting with the corresponding discrete operators based on the DEC\nframework. Numerical experiments for flows over surfaces reveal a second order\naccuracy for the developed scheme when using structured-triangular meshes, and\nfirst order accuracy for otherwise unstructured meshes. By construction, the\nmethod is conservative in that both mass and vorticity are conserved up to\nmachine precision. The relative error in kinetic energy for inviscid flow test\ncases converges in a second order fashion with both the mesh size and the time\nstep.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme to generate\noptically-controlled delays based on off-resonant Raman absorption. Dispersion\nin a transparency window between two neighboring, optically-activated Raman\nabsorption lines is used to reduce the group velocity of broadband 765 nm\npulses. We implement this approach in a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)\nwaveguide at room temperature, and demonstrate Raman-induced delays of up to\n140 fs for a 650-fs duration, 1.8-THz bandwidth, signal pulse; the available\ndelay-bandwidth product is $\\approx1$. Our approach is applicable to single\nphoton signals, offers wavelength tunability, and is a step toward processing\nultrafast photons.\n", "  (This is the unpublished manuscript while parts are corrected and included in\nversion III of arXiv:1602.00964 which is submitted to the journal.)\n  We study the back-reaction of classical Maxwell field and massive scalar\nfield on the BTZ black hole entropy. The exact values of the modification which\ncorrect the black hole area law are found. We discuss the similar properties\nbetween the scalar and Maxwell fields which are investigated in both of Coulomb\ngauge and Lorentz gauge. The dependences of mass and mode number on the black\nhole entropy are illustrated. We also study the back-reaction by D branes,\nwhich are described by DBI action, and explicitly check that the classical\nsolution which gives the black hole entropy precisely corrects the black hole\narea law. Our results extend the calculations of the generalized gravitational\nentropy proposed in recent by Lewkowycz and Maldacena [1].\n", "  A first measurement is presented of exclusive photoproduction of $\\rho^0$\nmesons associated with leading neutrons at HERA. The data were taken with the\nH1 detector in the years $2006$ and $2007$ at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=319$ GeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $1.16$\npb$^{-1}$. The $\\rho^0$ mesons with transverse momenta $p_T<1$ GeV are\nreconstructed from their decays to charged pions, while leading neutrons\ncarrying a large fraction of the incoming proton momentum, $x_L>0.35$, are\ndetected in the Forward Neutron Calorimeter. The phase space of the measurement\nis defined by the photon virtuality $Q^2 < 2$ GeV$^2$, the total energy of the\nphoton-proton system $20 < W_{\\gamma p} < 100$ GeV and the polar angle of the\nleading neutron $\\theta_n < 0.75$ mrad. The cross section of the reaction\n$\\gamma p \\to \\rho^0 n \\pi^+$ is measured as a function of several variables.\nThe data are interpreted in terms of a double peripheral process, involving\npion exchange at the proton vertex followed by elastic photoproduction of a\n$\\rho^0$ meson on the virtual pion. In the framework of one-pion-exchange\ndominance the elastic cross section of photon-pion scattering, $\\sigma^{\\rm\nel}(\\gamma\\pi^+ \\to \\rho^0\\pi^+)$, is extracted. The value of this cross\nsection indicates significant absorptive corrections for the exclusive reaction\n$\\gamma p\\to\\rho^0 n \\pi^+$.\n", "  We introduce a novel technique to produce monodisperse droplets through the\nsnap-off mechanism. The methodology is simple, versatile, and requires no\nspecialized or expensive components. The droplets produced have polydispersity\n<1% and can be as small as 2.5 $\\mu$m radius. A convenient feature is that the\ndroplet size is constant over a 100-fold change in flow rate, while at higher\nflows the droplet size can be continuously adjusted.\n", "  We revisit the production of leptonic asymmetries in minimal extensions of\nthe Standard Model that can explain neutrino masses, involving extra singlets\nwith Majorana masses in the GeV scale. We study the quantum kinetic equations\nboth analytically, via a perturbative expansion up to third order in the mixing\nangles, and numerically. The analytical solution allows us to identify the\nrelevant CP invariants, and simplifies the exploration of the parameter space.\nWe find that sizeable lepton asymmetries are compatible with non-degenerate\nneutrino masses and measurable active-sterile mixings.\n", "  Quantum sensors based on single solid-state spins promise a unique\ncombination of sensitivity and spatial resolution. The key challenge in sensing\nis to achieve minimum estimation uncertainty within a given time and with a\nhigh dynamic range. Adaptive strategies have been proposed to achieve optimal\nperformance but their implementation in solid-state systems has been hindered\nby the demanding experimental requirements. Here we realize adaptive d.c.\nsensing by combining single-shot readout of an electron spin in diamond with\nfast feedback. By adapting the spin readout basis in real time based on\nprevious outcomes we demonstrate a sensitivity in Ramsey interferometry\nsurpassing the standard measurement limit. Furthermore, we find by simulations\nand experiments that adaptive protocols offer a distinctive advantage over the\nbest-known non-adaptive protocols when overhead and limited estimation time are\ntaken into account. Using an optimized adaptive protocol we achieve a magnetic\nfield sensitivity of $6.1 \\pm 1.7$ nT *Hz$^{-1/2}$ over a wide range of 1.78\nmT. These results open up a new class of experiments for solid-state sensors in\nwhich real-time knowledge of the measurement history is exploited to obtain\noptimal performance.\n", "  Folded supersymmetry (f-SUSY) stabilizes the weak scale against radiative\ncorrections from the top sector via scalar partners whose gauge quantum numbers\ndiffer from their Standard Model counterparts. This non-trivial pairing of\nstates can be realized in extra-dimensional theories with appropriate\nsupersymmetry-breaking boundary conditions. We present a class of calculable\nf-SUSY models that are parametrized by a non-trivial twist in 5D boundary\nconditions and can accommodate the observed Higgs mass and couplings. Although\nthe distinctive phenomenology associated with the novel folded states should\nprovide strong evidence for this mechanism, the most stringent constraints are\ncurrently placed by conventional supersymmetry searches. These models remain\nminimally fine-tuned in light of LHC8 data and provide a range of both standard\nand exotic signatures accessible at LHC13.\n", "  We find a manifestly U-duality invariant formula for the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy of the most general 4 dimensional, stationary, asymptoticaly flat,\nnon-extremal STU black holes constructed recently by Chow and Comp\\`ere. The\nexpression is entirely in terms of asymptotic charges. It involves the \"scalar\ncharges\" of the black hole which still need to be solved in terms of the dyonic\ncharges and the mass. We discuss how the formula reduces to some of the known\nresults as the Klauza-Klein black hole and the dilute gas limit of Cveti\\v{c}\nand Larsen. We give the expected generalization to an $E_{7(7)}$ invariant in\nthe case of maximal $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity.\n", "  In order to determine the origin of discontinuities which arise when the\nsemiclassical propagator is employed to describe an infinitely long and\ninfinitesimally thin solenoid carrying magnetic flux, we give a systematic\nderivation of the semiclassical limit of the motion of an otherwise free\ncharged particle. Our limit establishes the connection of the quantum\nmechanical canonical angular momentum to its classical counterpart. Moreover,\nwe show how a picture of Aharonov-Bohm interference of two half-waves acquiring\nDirac's magnetic phase when passing on either side of the solenoid emerges from\nthe quantum propagator, and that the typical scale of the resulting\ninterference pattern is fully determined by the ratio of the angular part of\nHamilton's principal function to Planck's constant. The semiclassical\npropagator is recovered in the limit when this ratio diverges. We discuss the\nrelation of our results to the whirling-wave representation of the exact\npropagator.\n", "  We reintroduce an alternative expression for the Lagrangian density that\ngoverns the interaction of a charged particle with external electromagnetic\nfields, proposed by Livens about one century ago. This Lagrangian is written in\nterms of the local superposition of the particle fields with the applied\nelectromagnetic fields, not in terms of the particle charge and of the\nelectromagnetic potentials as is usual. Here we show that the total Lagrangian\nfor a set of charged particles assumes a simple elegant form with the\nalternative formulation, giving an aesthetic support for it. We also show that\nthe alternative Lagrangian is equivalent to the traditional one in their domain\nof validity and that it provides an interesting description of the\nAharonov-Bohm effect.\n", "  The multi-reference Coupled Cluster method first proposed by Meller et al (J.\nChem. Phys. 1996) has been implemented and tested. Guess values of the\namplitudes of the single and double excitations (the ${\\hat T}$ operator) on\nthe top of the references are extracted from the knowledge of the coefficients\nof the Multi Reference Singles and Doubles Configuration Interaction (MRSDCI)\nmatrix. The multiple parentage problem is solved by scaling these amplitudes on\nthe interaction between the references and the Singles and Doubles. Then one\nproceeds to a dressing of the MRSDCI matrix under the effect of the Triples and\nQuadruples, the coefficients of which are estimated from the action of ${\\hat\nT}^2$. This dressing follows the logics of the intermediate effective\nHamiltonian formalism. The dressed MRSDCI matrix is diagonalized and the\nprocess is iterated to convergence. The method is tested on a series of\nbenchmark systems from Complete Active Spaces (CAS) involving 2 or 4 active\nelectrons up to bond breakings. The comparison with Full Configuration\nInteraction (FCI) results shows that the errors are of the order of a few\nmilli-hartree, five times smaller than those of the CASSDCI. The method is\ntotally uncontracted, parallelizable, and extremely flexible since it may be\napplied to selected MR and/or selected SDCI. Some potential generalizations are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The linear response to temperature changes is derived for systems with\noverdamped stochastic dynamics. Holding both in transient and steady state\nconditions, the results allow to compute nonequilibrium thermal\nsusceptibilities from unperturbed correlation functions. These correlations\ncontain a novel form of entropy flow due to temperature unbalances, next to the\nstandard entropy flow of stochastic energetics and to complementary\ntime-symmetric dynamical aspects. Our derivation hinges on a time rescaling,\nwhich is a key procedure for comparing apparently incommensurable path weights.\nAn interesting notion of thermal time emerges from this approach.\n", "  Fast control of quantum systems is essential in order to make use of quantum\nproperties before they are degraded by decoherence. This is important for\nquantum-enhanced information processing, as well as for pushing quantum systems\ninto macroscopic regimes at the boundary between quantum and classical physics.\nBang-bang control attains the ultimate speed limit by making large changes to\ncontrol fields on timescales much faster than the system can respond, however\nthese methods are often challenging to implement experimentally. Here we\ndemonstrate bang-bang control of a trapped-ion oscillator using nano-second\nswitching of the trapping potentials. We perform controlled displacements which\nallow us to realize quantum states with up to 10,000 quanta of energy. We use\nthese displaced states to verify the form of the ion-light interaction at high\nexcitations which are far outside the usual regime of operation. These methods\nprovide new possibilities for quantum-state manipulation and generation,\nalongside the potential for a significant increase in operational clock speed\nfor ion-trap quantum information processing.\n", "  We consider the quantum (trajectories) filtering equation for the case when\nthe system is driven by Bose field inputs prepared in an arbitrary non-zero\nmean Gaussian state. The a posteriori evolution of the system is conditioned by\nthe results of a single or double homodyne measurements. The system interacting\nwith the Bose field is a single cavity mode taken initially in a Gaussian\nstate. We show explicit solutions using the method of characteristic functions\nto the filtering equations exploiting the linear Gaussian nature of the\nproblem.\n", "  We prove two statements about the long time dynamics of integrable\nHamiltonian systems. In classical mechanics, we prove the microcanonical\nversion of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) by mapping it to a known\ntheorem and then extend it to the limit of infinite number of degrees of\nfreedom. In quantum mechanics, we prove GGE for maximal Hamiltonians - a class\nof models stemming from a rigorous notion of quantum integrability understood\nas the existence of conserved charges with prescribed dependence on a system\nparameter, e.g. Hubbard U, anisotropy in the XXZ model etc. In analogy with\nclassical integrability, the defining property of these models is that they\nhave the maximum number of independent integrals. We contrast their dynamics\ninduced by quenching the parameter to that of random matrix Hamiltonians.\n", "  The production of prompt charmed mesons D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$, and their\nantiparticles, was measured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at the\ncentre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, of 2.76 TeV. The\nproduction yields for rapidity $|y|<0.5$ are presented as a function of\ntransverse momentum, $p_{\\rm T}$, in the interval 1-36 GeV/$c$ for the\ncentrality class 0-10% and in the interval 1-16 GeV/$c$ for the centrality\nclass 30-50%. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ was computed using a\nproton-proton reference at $\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV, based on measurements at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and on theoretical calculations. A maximum suppression by a\nfactor of 5-6 with respect to binary-scaled pp yields is observed for the most\ncentral collisions at $p_{\\rm T}$ of about 10 GeV/$c$. A suppression by a\nfactor of about 2-3 persists at the highest $p_{\\rm T}$ covered by the\nmeasurements. At low $p_{\\rm T}$ (1-3 GeV/$c$), the $R_{\\rm AA}$ has large\nuncertainties that span the range 0.35 (factor of about 3 suppression) to 1 (no\nsuppression). In all $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals, the $R_{\\rm AA}$ is larger in the\n30-50% centrality class compared to central collisions. The D-meson $R_{\\rm\nAA}$ is also compared with that of charged pions and, at large $p_{\\rm T}$,\ncharged hadrons, and with model calculations.\n", "  The production of prompt D$_s^+$ mesons was measured for the first time in\ncollisions of heavy nuclei with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The analysis was\nperformed on a data sample of Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, of 2.76 TeV in two different centrality\nclasses, namely 0-10% and 20-50%. D$_s^+$ mesons and their antiparticles were\nreconstructed at mid-rapidity from their hadronic decay channel\nD$_s^+\\rightarrow\\phi\\pi^+$, with $\\phi\\rightarrow$K$^-$K$^+$, in the\ntransverse momentum intervals $4< p_{\\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$ and $6< p_{\\rm T}<12$\nGeV/$c$ for the 0-10% and 20-50% centrality classes, respectively. The nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ was computed by comparing the $p_{\\rm\nT}$-differential production yields in Pb-Pb collisions to those in\nproton-proton (pp) collisions at the same energy. This pp reference was\nobtained using the cross section measured at $\\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV and scaled to\n$\\sqrt{s}= 2.76$ TeV. The $R_{\\rm AA}$ of D$_s^+$ mesons was compared to that\nof non-strange D mesons in the 10% most central Pb-Pb collisions. At high\n$p_{\\rm T}$ ($8< p_{\\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$) a suppression of the D$_s^+$-meson\nyield by a factor of about three, compatible within uncertainties with that of\nnon-strange D mesons, is observed. At lower $p_{\\rm T}$ ($4< p_{\\rm T}<8$\nGeV/$c$) the values of the D$_s^+$-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ are larger than those of\nnon-strange D mesons, although compatible within uncertainties. The production\nratios D$_s^+$/D$^0$ and D$_s^+$\\D$^+$ were also measured in Pb-Pb collisions\nand compared to their values in proton-proton collisions.\n", "  We explore boundary scattering in the sine-Gordon model with a non-integrable\nfamily of Robin boundary conditions. The soliton content of the field after\ncollision is analysed using a numerical implementation of the direct scattering\nproblem associated with the inverse scattering method. We find that an antikink\nmay be reflected into various combinations of an antikink, a kink, and one or\nmore breathers, depending on the values of the initial antikink velocity and a\nparameter associated with the boundary condition. In addition we observe\nregions with an intricate resonance structure arising from the creation of an\nintermediate breather whose recollision with the boundary is highly dependent\non the breather phase.\n", "  We perform a systematic study of the generic Gatto-Sartori-Tonin relation,\n$\\tan^2\\theta_{ij}= m_i/m_j$. This study of fermion mixing phenomena leads us\nto the necessary conditions that are needed in order to obtain it without any\napproximation. We begin by considering two Dirac fermion families. By means of\nthe hierarchy in the masses, it is found that a sufficient and necessary\ncondition is to have a normal matrix with $m_{11}=0$. This matrix can be\ndecomposed into two different linearly independent contributions. The origin\nfor such two independent contributions can be naturally explained by what we\nshall call the flavor-blind principle. This principle states that Yukawa\ncouplings shall be either flavor-blind or decomposed into several sets obeying\ndistinct permutation symmetries. In general, it is shown that the symmetry\nproperties of the introduced set of Yukawa matrices follow for $n$ fermion\nfamilies the unique sequential breaking $S_{nL}\\otimes S_{nR} \\rightarrow\nS_{(n-1)L}\\otimes S_{(n-1)R} \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow S_{2L}\\otimes\nS_{2R} \\rightarrow S_{2A}$. The particular case of three fermion families\nexplains why the four mass ratios parametrization that we recently proposed can\nbe used even in the case of no hierarchical masses.\n", "  A new approach to tackle Einstein equations for an isotropic and homogeneous\nFriedmann--Robertson--Walker Universe in the presence of a quintessence scalar\nfield is devised. It provides a way to get a simple exact solution to these\nequations. This solution determines the quintessence potential uniquely and it\ndiffers from solutions which have been used to study inflation previously. It\nrelays on a unification of geometry and dark matter implemented through the\ndefinition of a functional relation between the scale factor of the Universe\nand the quintessence field. For a positive curvature Universe, this solution\nproduces perpetual accelerated expansion rate of the Universe, while the Hubble\nparameter increases abruptly, attains a maximum value and decreases thereafter.\nThe behavior of this cosmological solution is discussed and its main features\nare displayed. The formalism is extended to include matter and radiation.\n", "  Current parameter estimation techniques rely on photodetectors which have low\nbrightness and thus are based on gathering averaged statistics. Recently it was\nclaimed that perfect photodetction will change the nature of sensing algorithms\nand will increase sensing efficiency beyond the immediate effect of having\nlarger collection efficiency. In this paper we bring up the observation that\nperfect photodetection implies Heisenberg scaling($\\frac{1}{T}$) for parameter\nestimations. We analyze a specific example in detail.\n", "  We propose a method to detect lower bounds to quantum capacities of a noisy\nquantum communication channel by means of few measurements. The method is\neasily implementable and does not require any knowledge about the channel. We\ntest its efficiency by studying its performance for most well known single\nqubit noisy channels and for the generalised Pauli channel in arbitrary finite\ndimension.\n", "  Minimal models of active Brownian colloids consisting of self-propelled\nspherical particles with purely repulsive interactions have recently been\nidentified as excellent quantitative testing grounds for theories of active\nmatter and have been the subject of extensive numerical and analytical\ninvestigation. These systems do not exhibit aligned or flocking states, but do\nhave a rich phase diagram, forming active gases, liquids and solids with novel\nmechanical properties. This article reviews recent advances in the\nunderstanding of such models, including the description of the active gas and\nits swim pressure, the motility-induced phase separation and the high-density\ncrystalline and glassy behavior.\n", "  A natural modification of the equations of covariantly-constant vector fields\n(CCVF) in Weyl geometry leads us to consider a metric compatible geometry\npossessing conformal curvature and torsion fully determined by its trace. The\nlatter is interpreted as a form of the electromagnetic (EM) 4-potentials and,\non a fixed metric background, turns out to be fully determined by the CCVF\nequations. When the metric is set Minkowskian, the named equations possess two\ntopologically distinct solutions, with the associated EM fields being\nasymptotically of the Lienard-Wiechert type and having distributed sources,\nwith a fixed (``elementary'') value of the electric charge. One of the\nsolutions is everywhere regular, whereas the other - singular on a\n2-dimensional shell. The speed of propagation of EM fields depends on the local\ncharge density and only asymptotically approaches the speed of light\n", "  The electron g-factor measured in a quantum point contact by source-drain\nbias spectroscopy is significantly larger than its value in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas. This enhancement, established experimentally in numerous studies,\nis an outstanding puzzle. In the present work we explain the mechanism of this\nenhancement in a theory accounting for the electron-electron interactions. We\nshow that the effect relies crucially on the non-equilibrium nature of the\nspectroscopy at finite bias.\n", "  We investigate the properties of persistent charge current driven by magnetic\nflux in a quasi-periodic mesoscopic Fibonacci ring with Rashba and Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interactions. Within a tight-binding framework we work out\nindividual state currents together with net current based on second-quantized\napproach. A significant enhancement of current is observed in presence of\nspin-orbit coupling and sometimes it becomes orders of magnitude higher\ncompared to the spin-orbit interaction free Fibonacci ring. We also establish a\nscaling relation of persistent current with ring size, associated with the\nFibonacci generation, from which one can directly estimate current for any\narbitrary flux, even in presence of spin-orbit interaction, without doing\nnumerical simulation. The present analysis indeed gives a unique opportunity of\ndetermining persistent current and has not been discussed so far.\n", "  Based on the density functional theory and our new model Hamiltonian, we have\nstudied the basal-plane antiferromagnetism in the novel Jeff=1/2 Mott insulator\nBa2IrO4. By comparing the magnetic properties of the bulk Ba2IrO4 with those of\nthe single-layer Ba2IrO4, we demonstrate unambiguously that the basal-plane\nantiferromagnetism is caused by the intralyer magnetic interactions rather than\nby the previously proposed interlayer ones. In order to reveal the origin of\nthe basal-plane antiferromagnetism, we propose a new model Hamiltonian by\nadding the single ion anisotropy and pseudo-quadrupole interactions into the\ngeneral bilinear pseudo-spin Hamiltonian. The obtained magnetic interaction\nparameters indicate that the single ion anisotropy and pseudo-quadrupole\ninteractions are unexpectedly strong. Systematical Monte Carlo simulations\ndemonstrate that the basal-plane antiferromagnetism is caused by the isotropic\nHeisenberg, bond-dependent Kitaev and pseudo-quadrupole interactions. Our\nresults show for the first time that the single ion anisotropy and\npseudo-quadrupole interaction can play significant roles in establishing the\nexotic magnetism in the Jeff=1/2 Mott insulator.\n", "  The phenomenon of dynamical quark mass generation is studied in QCD within\nthe framework of a gauge invariant formalism. An exact relationship is\nestablished between the equation satisfied by the scalar part of the two-point\ngauge invariant quark Green's function and the quark-antiquark bound state\nequation in the chiral limit. A possible nontrivial solution of the former\nyields a massless pseudoscalar solution of the bound state equation with\nvanishing total momentum. The result is also corroborated by the corresponding\nWard-Takahashi identity. The problem is explicitly solved in two-dimensional\nQCD in the large-$N_c$ limit.\n", "  The electroweak production and subsequent decay of single top quarks is\ndetermined by the properties of the $Wtb$ vertex. This vertex can be described\nby the complex parameters of an effective Lagrangian. An analysis of angular\ndistributions of the decay products of single top quarks produced in the\n$t$-channel constrains these parameters simultaneously. The analysis described\nin this paper uses 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$\n= 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.Two parameters are\nmeasured simultaneously in this analysis. The fraction $f_1$ of decays\ncontaining transversely polarised $W$ bosons is measured to be $0.37 \\pm 0.07$\n(stat.$\\oplus$syst.). The phase $\\delta_{-}$ between amplitudes for\ntransversely and longitudinally polarised $W$ bosons recoiling against\nleft-handed $b$-quarks is measured to be $-0.14\\pi \\pm 0.036\\pi$\n(stat.$\\oplus$syst.).The correlation in the measurement of these parameters is\n$0.15$. These values result in two-dimensional limits at the 95% confidence\nlevel on the ratio of the complex coupling parameters $g_\\mathrm{R}$ and\n$V_\\mathrm{L}$, yielding Re [$g_\\mathrm{R}/V_\\mathrm{L}$] $\\in [-0.36,0.10]$\nand Im [$g_\\mathrm{R}/V_\\mathrm{L}$] $\\in [-0.17,0.23]$ with a correlation of\n0.11. The results are in good agreement with the predictions of the Standard\nModel.\n", "  We construct a generalized transfer matrix corresponding to noninteracting\ntight-binding lattice models, which can subsequently be used to compute the\nbulk bands as well as the edge states. Crucially, our formalism works even in\ncases where the hopping matrix is non-invertible. Following Hatsugai [PRL 71,\n3697 (1993)], we explicitly construct the energy Riemann surfaces associated\nwith the band structure for a specific class of systems which includes systems\nlike Chern insulator, Dirac semimetal and graphene. The edge states can then be\ninterpreted as non-contractible loops, with the winding number equal to the\nbulk Chern number. For these systems, the transfer matrix is symplectic, and\nhence we also describe the windings associated with the edge states on $Sp(2,\n\\mathbb{R})$ and interpret the corresponding winding number as a Maslov index.\n", "  We analyze the role of local geometry in the spin and orbital interaction in\ntransition metal compounds with orbital degeneracy. We stress that the tendency\nobserved for the most studied case (transition metals in O$_6$ octahedra with\none common oxygen -- common corner of neighboring octahedra and with $\\sim\n180^{\\circ}$ metal--oxygen--metal bonds), that ferro-orbital ordering renders\nantiferro-spin coupling, and, {\\it vice versa}, antiferro-orbitals give\nferro-spin ordering, is not valid in general case, in particular for octahedra\nwith common edge and with $\\sim 90^{\\circ}$ M--O--M bonds. Special attention is\npaid to the ``third case'', neighboring octahedra with common face (three\ncommon oxygens) -- the case practically not considered until now, although\nthere are many real systems with this geometry. Interestingly enough, the\nspin--orbital exchange in this case turns out to be to be simpler and more\nsymmetric than in the first two cases. We also consider, which form the\neffective exchange takes for different geometries in case of strong spin--orbit\ncoupling.\n", "  We show that generic three-dimensional $\\mathcal N=2$ quiver super\nChern-Simons-matter theories admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS)\nDrukker-Trancanelli (DT) type Wilson loops. We investigate both Wilson loops\nalong timelike infinite straight lines in Minkowski spacetime and circular\nWilson loops in Euclidean space. In Aharnoy-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory,\nwe find that generic BPS DT type Wilson loops preserve the same number of\nsupersymmetries as Gaiotto-Yin type Wilson loops. There are several free\nparameters for generic BPS DT type Wilson loops in the construction, and\nsupersymmetry enhancement for Wilson loops happens for special values of the\nparameters.\n", "  We present a first analysis of parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD based on single-inclusive pion\nproduction in electron-positron annihilation. Special emphasis is put on the\ntechnical details necessary to perform the QCD scale evolution and cross\nsection calculation in Mellin moment space. We demonstrate how the description\nof the data and the theoretical uncertainties are improved when\nnext-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections are included.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments showing over $10^4$-fold increase in induced\npolarization from electrochemically inert, conducting materials in dilute\nsaline solutions, we theoretically demonstrate a new mechanism for dielectric\nenhancement, in the absence of $\\zeta-$potentials at interfaces between\nnon-insulating particles and an electrolyte solution. We further show that the\nmagnitude of such enhancement obeys universal scaling laws, independent of the\nparticle's electrical properties and valid across particle shapes: for a dilute\nsuspension of identical, but arbitrarily shaped particles of a linear dimension\n$a$ and volume fraction $f$, as $\\omega\\to0$ the effective real dielectric\nconstant of the mixture is enhanced from that of water by a factor\n$1+f~(P_r+(a/\\lambda)P_i)$, and the frequency-dependent phase shift of its\nimpedance has a scale-invariant maximum $f\\,\\mathsf{\\Theta}$ if particles are\nmuch more conductive than the solution. Here $\\lambda$ is the solution's Debye\nlength and $P_r$, $P_i$, $\\mathsf{\\Theta}$ are dimensionless numbers determined\nsolely by the particles' shape. Even for a very dilute electrolyte solution\n(e.g. $10^{-3}$ molar), sub-mm sized particles, at volume fraction $f=0.1$, can\ngive a $10^4$-fold dielectric enhancement, producing an easily observable phase\nshift maximum in a simple impedance measurement.We also derive frequency\ncutoffs as conditions for observing these enhancements, showing that insulating\nparticles produce no enhancement without $\\zeta$-potential.To prove these\nresults for particles of arbitrary shapes, we develop a physical picture where\nan externally induced double layer (EIDL), in contrast to the Guoy-Chapman\ndouble layer on interfaces with significant $\\zeta$-potentials, dominates the\nlow-frequency dynamics and produces dielectric enhancement.\n", "  We analyze measurements of the magnetization, differential susceptibility and\nspecific heat of quasi-one dimensional insulator\nCu(C$_4$H$_4$N$_2$)(NO$_3$)$_2$ (CuPzN) subjected to magnetic fields. We show\nthat the thermodynamic properties are defined by quantum spin liquid formed\nwith spinons, with the magnetic field tuning the insulator CuPzN towards\nquantum critical point related to fermion condensation quantum phase transition\n(FCQPT) at which the spinon effective mass diverges kinematically. We show that\nthe FCQPT concept permits to reveal and explain the scaling behavior of\nthermodynamic characteristics. For the first time, we construct the schematic\n$T-H$ (temperature---magnetic field) phase diagram of CuPzN, that contains\nLandau-Fermi-liquid, crossover and non-Fermi liquid parts, thus resembling that\nof heavy-fermion compounds.\n", "  In this note we show that given a conformally invariant theory in flat\nspace-time, it is not always possible to couple it to gravity in a Weyl\ninvariant way.\n", "  In this letter we consider a magnetic impurity in a one-dimensional\nspin-$1/2$ Fermi gas with infinitely strong repulsive interaction between\nfermions. We rigorously prove that, independent of whether the magnetic\ncoupling between impurity and fermions is ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic,\nthe ground state is always a fully polarized ferromagnetic state for the\nitinerant fermions. This ferromagnetism can be understood as a cooperative\neffect of avoiding frustration of magnetic coupling during fermion hopping and\nthe large spin degeneracy of a fermion Tonks gas. By numerically diagonalizing\na finite size system, we show that the spin gap first increases linearly with\nmagnetic coupling strength in the weak coupling regime, while decreases in the\nstrong coupling regime. Our results show that a magnetic impurity in a strongly\ncorrelated gas can exhibit effect different from the Kondo effect as in a\nweakly correlated Fermi liquid.\n", "  A new method is proposed for switching on interactions that are compatible\nwith global symmetries and conservation laws of the original free theory. The\nmethod is applied to the control of stability in Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian\ntheories with higher derivatives. By way of illustration, a wide class of\nstable interactions is constructed for the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.\n", "  Recent progress on scattering amplitudes in super Yang--Mills and superstring\ntheory benefitted from the use of multiparticle superfields. They universally\ncapture tree-level subdiagrams, and their generating series solve the\nnon-linear equations of ten-dimensional super Yang--Mills. We provide\nsimplified recursions for multiparticle superfields and relate them to earlier\nrepresentations through non-linear gauge transformations of their generating\nseries. In this work we discuss the gauge transformations which enforce their\nLie symmetries as suggested by the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson duality between\ncolor and kinematics. Another gauge transformation due to Harnad and Shnider is\nshown to streamline the theta-expansion of multiparticle superfields, bypassing\nthe need to use their recursion relations beyond the lowest components. The\nfindings of this work tremendously simplify the component extraction from\nkinematic factors in pure spinor superspace.\n", "  The recursive method of Berends and Giele to compute tree-level gluon\namplitudes is revisited using the framework of ten-dimensional super\nYang-Mills. First we prove that the pure spinor formula to compute SYM tree\namplitudes derived in 2010 reduces to the standard Berends-Giele formula from\nthe 80s when restricted to gluon amplitudes and additionally determine the\nfermionic completion. Second, using BRST cohomology manipulations in\nsuperspace, alternative representations of the component amplitudes are\nexplored and the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations among partial tree\namplitudes are derived in a novel way. Finally, it is shown how the\nsupersymmetric components of manifestly local BCJ-satisfying tree-level\nnumerators can be computed in a recursive fashion.\n", "  In our previous papers [11,13] we showed that the Hamilton-Jacobi problem can\nbe regarded as a way to describe a given dynamics on a phase space manifold in\nterms of a family of dynamics on a lower-dimensional manifold. We also showed\nhow constants of the motion help to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Here we\nwant to delve into this interpretation by considering the most general case: a\ndynamical system on a manifold that is described in terms of a family of\ndynamics (`slicing vector fields') on lower-dimensional manifolds. We identify\nthe relevant geometric structures that lead from this decomposition of the\ndynamics to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory, by considering special cases\nlike fibred manifolds and Hamiltonian dynamics, in the symplectic framework and\nthe Poisson one. We also show how a set of functions on a tangent bundle can\ndetermine a second-order dynamics for which they are constants of the motion.\n", "  We investigate dynamics of an optomechanical system under the Non-Markovian\nenvironment. In the weak optomechanical single-photon coupling regime, we\nprovide an analytical approach fully taking into account the non-Markovian\nmemory effects. When the cavity-bath coupling strength crosses a certain\nthreshold, an oscillating memory state for the classical cavity field (called\nbound state) is formed. Due to the existence of the non-decay optical bound\nstate, a nonequilibrium optomechanical thermal entanglement is preserved even\nwithout external driving laser. Our results provide a potential usage to\ngenerate and protect entanglement via Non-Markovian environment engineering.\n", "  A search for compositeness of electrons and muons is presented using a data\nsample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 8\nTeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Excited leptons (l*) produced\nvia contact interactions in conjunction with a standard model lepton are\nconsidered, and a search is made for their gauge decay modes. The decays\nconsidered are l* to l + gamma and l* to l + Z, which give final states of two\nleptons and a photon or, depending on the Z-boson decay mode, four leptons or\ntwo leptons and two jets. The number of events observed in data is consistent\nwith the standard model prediction. Exclusion limits are set on the excited\nlepton mass, and the compositeness scale Lambda. For the case M(l*) = Lambda\nthe existence of excited electrons (muons) is excluded up to masses of 2.45\n(2.47) TeV at 95% confidence level. Neutral current decays of excited leptons\nare considered for the first time, and limits are extended to include the\npossibility that the weight factors f and f', which determine the couplings\nbetween standard model leptons and excited leptons via gauge mediated\ninteractions, have opposite sign.\n", "  We apply QCD-inspired techniques to study nonrelativistic N-component\ndegenerate fermions with attractive interactions. By analyzing the\nsingular-value spectrum of the fermion matrix in the Lagrangian, we derive\nseveral exact relations that characterize the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nU(1)xSU(N)$\\to$Sp(N) through bifermion condensates. These are nonrelativistic\nanalogues of the Banks-Casher relation and the Smilga-Stern relation in QCD.\nNon-local order parameters are also introduced and their spectral\nrepresentations are derived, from which a nontrivial constraint on the phase\ndiagram is obtained. The effective theory of soft collective excitations is\nderived and its equivalence to random matrix theory is demonstrated in the\nepsilon-regime. We numerically confirm the above analytical predictions in\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Oscillons are spatially localized and relatively stable field fluctuations\nwhich can form after inflation under suitable conditions. In order to reheat\nthe universe, the fields which dominate the energy density after inflation have\nto couple to other degrees of freedom and finally produce the matter particles\npresent in the universe today. In this study, we use lattice simulations in 2+1\ndimensions to investigate how such couplings can affect the formation and\nstability of oscillons. We focus on models of hilltop inflation, where we have\nrecently shown that hill crossing oscillons generically form, and consider the\ncoupling to an additional scalar field which, depending on the value of the\ncoupling parameter, can get resonantly enhanced from the inhomogeneous inflaton\nfield. We find that three cases are realized: without a parametric resonance,\nthe additional scalar field has no effects on the oscillons. For a fast and\nstrong parametric resonance of the other scalar field, oscillons are strongly\nsuppressed. For a delayed parametric resonance, on the other hand, the\noscillons get imprinted on the other scalar field and their stability is even\nenhanced compared to the single-field oscillons.\n", "  Physical quantities and physical dimensions are among the first concepts\nencountered by students in their undergraduate career. In this pedagogical\nreview, I will start from these concepts and, using the powerful tool of\ndimensional analysis, I will embark in a journey through various branches of\nphysics, from basic mechanics to quantum gravity. I will also discuss a little\nbit about the fundamental constants of Nature, the so-called \"cube of Physics\",\nand the natural system of units.\n", "  The mechanism of reversible photodegradation of 1-substituted\naminoanthraquinones doped into poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene is\ninvestigated. Time-dependent density functional theory is employed to predict\nthe transition energies and corresponding oscillator strengths of the proposed\nreversibly- and irreversibly-damaged dye species. Ultraviolet-visible and\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are used to characterize which\nspecies are present. FTIR spectroscopy indicates that both dye and polymer\nundergo reversible photodegradation when irradiated with a visible laser. These\nfindings suggest that photodegradation of 1-substituted aminoanthraquinones\ndoped in polymers originates from interactions between dyes and photoinduced\nthermally-degraded polymers, and the metastable product may recover or further\ndegrade irreversibly.\n", "  An exact analytical model of the process of collision and nonlinear\ninteraction of gravitational and/or electromagnetic soliton wave and strong\nnon-soliton electromagnetic traveling wave of arbitrary profile propagating in\nthe expanding universe (the symmetric Kasner spacetime) is presented. In\ncontrast to intuitive expectations that rather strong traveling waves can\ndestroy the soliton, it occurs that the soliton survives during its interaction\nwith electromagnetic wave of arbitrary amplitude and profile, but its\nparameters begin to evolve under the influence of this interaction. If a\ntraveling electromagnetic wave possesses a finite duration, the soliton\nparameters after interaction take constant values again, but these values in\ngeneral are different from those before the interaction. Based on exact\nsolutions of Einstein - Maxwell equations, our model demonstrates a series of\nnonlinear phenomena, such as (a) creation of gravitational waves in the\ncollision of two electromagnetic waves, (b) creation of electromagnetic soliton\nwave in the collision of gravitational soliton with traveling electromagnetic\nwave, (c) scattering of a part of soliton wave in the direction of propagation\nof traveling electromagnetic wave, (d) quasiperiodic oscillating character of\nfields in the wave interaction region and multiple mutual transformations of\ngravitational and electromagnetic waves in this region. The figures illustrate\nthese features of nonlinear wave interactions in General Relativity.\n", "  In analogy to nanoscopic molecules that are composed of individual atoms, we\nconsider an active \"microswimmer molecule\". It is built up from three\nindividual magnetic colloidal microswimmers that are connected by harmonic\nsprings and hydrodynamically interact with each other. In the ground state,\nthey form a linear straight molecule. We analyze the relaxation dynamics for\nperturbations of this straight configuration. As a central result, with\nincreasing self-propulsion, we observe an oscillatory instability in accord\nwith a subcritical Hopf bifurcation scenario. It is accompanied by a\ncorkscrew-like swimming trajectory of increasing radius. Our results can be\ntested experimentally, using for instance magnetic self-propelled Janus\nparticles, supposably linked by DNA molecules.\n", "  We show that transonic one dimensional flows which are analogous to black\nholes obey no-hair theorems both at the level of linear perturbations and in\nnon-linear regimes. Considering solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii (or\nKorteweg-de Vries) equation, we show that stationary flows which are\nasymptotically uniform on both sides of the horizon are stable and act as\nattractors. Using Whitham's modulation theory, we analytically characterize the\nemitted waves when starting from uniform perturbations. Numerical simulations\nconfirm the validity of this approximation and extend the results to more\ngeneral perturbations and to the (non-integrable) cubic-quintic\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. When considering time reversed flows that correspond\nto white holes, the asymptotically uniform flows are unstable to sufficiently\nlarge perturbations and emit either a macroscopic undulation in the supersonic\nside, or a non-linear superposition of soliton trains.\n", "  We observe energy-dependent angle-resolved diffraction patterns in protons\nfrom strong-field dissociation of the molecular hydrogen ion H$_2^+$. The\ninterference is a characteristic of dissociation around a laser-induced conical\nintersection (LICI), which is a point of contact between two surfaces in the\ndressed 2-dimensional Born-Oppenheimer potential energy landscape of a diatomic\nmolecule in a strong laser field. The interference magnitude and angular period\ndepend strongly on the energy difference between the initial state and the\nLICI, consistent with coherent diffraction around a cone-shaped potential\nbarrier whose width and thickness depend on the relative energy of the initial\nstate and the cone apex. These findings are supported by numerical solutions of\nthe time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for similar experimental\nconditions.\n", "  We have carried-out two intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT)\nR-matrix calculations for the electron-impact excitation of C-like Fe $^{20+}$,\nboth of which use the same expansions for their configuration interaction (CI)\nand close-coupling (CC) representations. The first expansion arises from the\nconfigurations 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$, 2s 2p$^3$, 2p$^4$, {2s$^2$ 2p, 2s 2p$^2$, 2p$^3$}\nnl, with n=3,4, for l=0-3, which give rise to 564 CI/CC levels. The second adds\nconfigurations 2s$^2$ 2p 5l, for l=0-2, which give rise to 590 CI/CC levels in\ntotal. Comparison of oscillator strengths and effective collision strengths\nfrom these two calculations demonstrates the lack of convergence in data for\nn=4 from the smaller one. Comparison of results for the 564 CI/CC level\ncalculation with an earlier ICFT R-matrix calculation which used the exact same\nCI expansion but truncated the CC expansion to only 200 levels demonstrates the\nlack of convergence of the earlier data, particularly for n=3 levels. Also, we\nfind that the results of our 590 CC R-matrix calculation are significantly and\nsystematically larger than those of an earlier comparable Distorted\nWave-plus-resonances calculation. Thus, it is important still to take note of\nthe (lack of) convergence in both atomic structural and collisional data, even\nin such a highly-charged ion as Fe $^{20+}$, and to treat resonances\nnon-perturbatively. This is of particular importance for Fe ions given their\nimportance in the spectroscopic diagnostic modelling of astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  The effects of changing the orientation of the rotation axis on homogeneous\nturbulence is considered. We perform direct numerical simulations on a periodic\nbox of $1024^3$ grid points, where the orientation of the rotation axis is\nchanged (a) at a fixed time instant (b) regularly at time intervals\ncommensurate with the rotation time scale. The former is characterized by a\ndominant inverse energy cascade whereas in the latter, the inverse cascade is\nstymied due to the recurrent changes in the rotation axis resulting in a strong\nforward energy transfer and large scale structures that resemble those of\nisotropic turbulence.\n", "  Standard X-ray crystallography methods use free-atom models to calculate mean\nunit cell charge densities. Real molecules, however, have shared charge that is\nnot captured accurately using free-atom models. To address this limitation, a\ncharge density model of crystalline urea was calculated using high-level\nquantum theory and was refined against publicly available ultra high-resolution\nexperimental Bragg data, including the effects of atomic displacement\nparameters. The resulting quantum crystallographic model was compared to models\nobtained using spherical atom or multipole methods. Despite using only the same\nnumber of free parameters as the spherical atom model, the agreement of the\nquantum model with the data is comparable to the multipole model. The static,\ntheoretical crystalline charge density of the quantum model is distinct from\nthe multipole model, indicating the quantum model provides substantially new\ninformation. Hydrogen thermal ellipsoids in the quantum model were very similar\nto those obtained using neutron crystallography, indicating that quantum\ncrystallography can increase the accuracy of the X-ray crystallographic atomic\ndisplacement parameters. The results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits\nof integrating fully periodic quantum charge density calculations into ultra\nhigh-resolution X-ray crystallographic model building and refinement.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental efforts on three-dimensional semimetals, we\ninvestigate the static and dynamic density response of the nodal line semimetal\nby computing the polarizability for both undoped and doped cases. The nodal\nline semimetal in the absence of doping is characterized by a ring-shape zero\nenergy contour in momentum space, which may be considered as a collection of\nDirac points. In the doped case, the Fermi surface has a torus shape and two\nindependent processes of the momentum transfer contribute to the singular\nfeatures of the polarizability even though we only have a single Fermi surface.\nIn the static limit, there exist two independent singularities in the second\nderivative of the static polarizability. This results in the highly anisotropic\nFriedel oscillations which show the angle-dependent algebraic power law and the\nbeat phenomena in the oscillatory electron density near a charged impurity.\nFurthermore, the dynamical polarizability has two singular lines along\n$\\hbar\\omega = \\gamma p$ and $\\hbar\\omega = \\gamma p \\sin\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is\nthe angle between the external momentum $\\vec{p}$ and the plane where the nodal\nring lies. From the dynamical polarizability, we obtain the plasmon modes in\nthe doped case, which show anisotropic dispersions and angle-dependent plasma\nfrequencies. Qualitative differences between the low and high doping regimes\nare discussed in light of future experiments.\n", "  We analyze optical photometric data of short term variability (flickering) of\naccreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (KR Aur, MV Lyr, V794 Aql, TT\nAri, V425 Cas), recurrent novae (RS Oph and T CrB) and jet-ejecting symbiotic\nstars (CH Cyg and MWC 560). We find that the amplitude-flux relationship is\nvisible over four orders of magnitude, in the range of fluxes from $10^{29}$ to\n$10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$, as a \"statistically perfect\" correlation\nwith correlation coefficient 0.96 and p-value $ \\sim 10^{-28}$. In the above\nrange, the amplitude of variability for any of our 9 objects is proportional to\nthe flux level with (almost) one and the same factor of proportionality for all\n9 accreting white dwarfs with $\\Delta F = 0.36 (\\pm 0.05) F_{av}$,\n$\\sigma_{rms} = 0.086(\\pm 0.011) F_{av}$, and $\\sigma_{rms} / \\Delta F = 0.24\n\\pm 0.02$. Over all, our results indicate that the viscosity in the accretion\ndiscs is practically the same for all 9 objects in our sample, in the mass\naccretion rate range $2 \\times 10^{-11} - 2\\times10^{-7}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.\n", "  Tensor network states, and in particular projected entangled pair states\n(PEPS), suggest an innovative approach for the study of lattice gauge theories,\nboth from a pure theoretic point of view, and as a tool for the analysis of the\nrecent proposals for quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. In this\npaper we present a framework for describing locally gauge invariant states on\nlattices using PEPS. The PEPS constructed hereby shall include both bosonic and\nfermionic states, suitable for all combinations of matter and gauge fields in\nlattice gauge theories defined by either finite or compact Lie groups.\n", "  A three-terminal Josephson junction biased at opposite voltages can sustain a\nphase-sensitive dc-current carrying three-body static phase coherence, known as\nthe \"quartet current\". We calculate the zero-frequency current noise\ncross-correlations and answer the question of whether this current is noisy\n(like a normal current in response to a voltage drop) or noiseless (like an\nequilibrium supercurrent in response to a phase drop). A quantum dot with a\nlevel at energy $\\epsilon_0$ is connected to three superconductors $S_a$, $S_b$\nand $S_c$ with gap $\\Delta$, biased at $V_a=V$, $V_b=-V$ and $V_c=0$, and with\nintermediate contact transparencies. At zero temperature, nonlocal quartets (in\nthe sense of four-fermion correlations) are noiseless at subgap voltage in the\nnonresonant dot regime $\\epsilon_0/\\Delta\\gg 1$, which is demonstrated with a\nsemi-analytical perturbative expansion of the cross-correlations. Noise reveals\nthe absence of granularity of the superflow splitting from $S_c$ towards\n$(S_a,S_b)$ in the nonresonant dot regime, in spite of finite voltage. In the\nresonant dot regime $\\epsilon_0/\\Delta< 1$, cross-correlations measured in the\n$(V_a,V_b)$ plane should reveal an \"anomaly\" in the vicinity of the quartet\nline $V_a+V_b=0$, related to an additional contribution to the noise,\nmanifesting the phase sensitivity of cross-correlations under the appearance of\na three-body phase variable. Phase-dependent effective Fano factors $F_\\varphi$\nare introduced, defined as the ratio between the amplitudes of phase\nmodulations of the noise and the currents. At low bias, the Fano factors\n$F_\\varphi$ are of order unity in the resonant dot regime $\\epsilon_0/\\Delta<\n1$, and they are vanishingly small in the nonresonant dot regime\n$\\epsilon_0/\\Delta\\gg 1$.\n", "  The anomalous dimensions of the Planck mass and the cosmological constant are\ncalculated in a renormalizable quantum conformal gravity with a single\ndimensionless coupling, which is formulated using dimensional regularization on\nthe basis of Hathrell's works for conformal anomalies. The dynamics of the\ntraceless tensor field is handled by the Weyl action, while that of the\nconformal-factor field is described by the induced Wess-Zumino actions,\nincluding the Riegert action as the kinetic term. Loop calculations are carried\nout in Landau gauge in order to reduce the number of Feynman diagrams as well\nas to avoid some uncertainty. Especially, we calculate two-loop quantum gravity\ncorrections to the cosmological constant. It suggests that there is a dynamical\nsolution to the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  We obtain a prediction for the hadron-collider event-shape variable\ntransverse thrust in which the terms enhanced in the dijet limit are resummed\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Our method exploits\nuniversality properties made manifest in the factorized expression for the\ncross section and only requires one-loop calculations. The necessary two-loop\ningredients are extracted using known results and existing numerical codes. Our\ntechnique is general and applicable to other observables as well.\n", "  The Seebeck coefficient $S$ of the cuprate superconductor La$ _{2-x} $Sr$_{x}\n$CuO$ _{4}$ (LSCO) was measured in magnetic fields large enough to access the\nnormal state at low temperatures, for a range of Sr concentrations from $x =\n0.07$ to $x = 0.15$. For $x = 0.11$, 0.12, 0.125 and 0.13, $S/T$ decreases upon\ncooling to become negative at low temperatures. The same behavior is observed\nin the Hall coefficient $R_{H}(T)$. In analogy with other hole-doped cuprates\nat similar hole concentrations $p$, the negative $S$ and $R_{H}$ show that the\nFermi surface of LSCO undergoes a reconstruction caused by the onset of\ncharge-density-wave modulations. Such modulations have indeed been detected in\nLSCO by X-ray diffraction in precisely the same doping range. Our data show\nthat in LSCO this Fermi-surface reconstruction is confined to $0.085 < p <\n0.15$. We argue that in the field-induced normal state of LSCO,\ncharge-density-wave order ends at a critical doping $p_{\\rm CDW} = 0.15 \\pm\n0.005$, well below the pseudogap critical doping $p^\\star \\simeq 0.19$.\n", "  Following our previous papers concerning the quantization of the vacuum\nBianchi-IX model within or beyond the Born-Oppenheimer and adiabatic\napproximation, we develop a more elaborate analysis of the dynamical properties\nof the model based the vibronic approach utilized in molecular physics. As in\nthe previous papers, we restrict our approach to the harmonic approximation of\nthe anisotropy potential in order to obtain resoluble analytical expressions.\n", "  In the presence of (approximately conserved) axial charge in the QCD plasma\nat finite temperature, the emitted photons are spin-aligned, which is a unique\nP- and CP-odd signature of axial charge in the photon emission observables. We\ncompute this \"P-odd photon emission rate\" in weak coupling regime at high\ntemperature limit to complete leading order in the QCD coupling constant: the\nleading log as well as the constant under the log. As in the P-even total\nemission rate in the literature, the computation of P-odd emission rate at\nleading order consists of three parts: 1) Compton and Pair Annihilation\nprocesses with hard momentum exchange, 2) soft t- and u-channel contributions\nwith Hard Thermal Loop re-summation, 3) Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)\nre-summation of collinear Bremstrahlung and Pair Annihilation. We present\nanalytical and numerical evaluations of these contributions to our P-odd photon\nemission rate observable.\n", "  Architectural conservation and repair are becoming increasingly important\nissues in many countries due to numerous prior improper interventions,\nincluding the use of inappropriate repair materials over time. As a result, the\ncomposition of repair masonry mortars is now being more frequently addressed in\nmortar research. Just recently, for example, it has become apparent that\nPortland cement mortars, extensively exploited as repair mortars over the past\nfew decades, are not suitable for repair because of their chemical, physical,\nmechanical, and aesthetic incompatibilities with original materials. This paper\nfocuses on the performance of various lime-based alternative materials intended\nfor application in repairing historic structures when subjected to mechanical\nloading. Results of basic material tests indicate that the use of metakaolin as\na pozzolanic additive produces mortars with superior strength and sufficiently\nlow shrinkage. Moreover, mortar strength can be further enhanced by the\naddition of crushed brick fragments, which explains the longevity of Roman\nconcretes rich in pozzolans and aggregates from crushed clay products such as\ntiles, pottery, or bricks. An integrated experimental-numerical approach was\nused to identify key mortar parameters influencing the load-bearing capacity of\nmasonry piers subjected to a combination of compression and bending. The\nsimulations indicate increased load-bearing capacities for masonry piers\ncontaining metakaolin-rich mortars with crushed brick fragments, as a result of\ntheir superior compressive strength.\n", "  A geometric construction for obtaining a prolongation of a connection to a\nconnection of a bundle of connections is presented. This determines a natural\nextension of the notion of canonical energy-tensor which suits gauge and\ngravitational fields, and shares the main properties of the energy-tensor of a\nmatter field in the jet space formulation of Lagrangian field theory, in\nparticular with regards to symmetries of the Poincar\\'e-Cartan form.\nAccordingly, the joint energy-tensor for interacting matter and gauge fields\nturns out to be a natural geometric object, whose definition needs no auxuliary\nstructures. Various topics related to energy-tensors, symmetries and the\nEinstein equations in a theory with interacting matter, gauge and gravitational\nfields can be viewed under a clarifying light. Finally, the symmetry determined\nby the \"Komar superpotential\" is expressed as a symmetry of the gravitational\nPoincar\\'e-Cartan form.\n", "  Hydrogen compounds are peculiar as the quantum nature of the proton can\ncrucially affect their structural and physical properties. A remarkable example\nare the high-pressure phases of H$_2$O, where quantum proton fluctuations favor\nthe symmetrization of the H bond and lower by 30 GPa the boundary between the\nasymmetric structure and the symmetric one. Here we show that an analogous\nquantum symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride\nsuperconductor with the record superconducting critical temperature $T_c=203$ K\nat 155 GPa. In this system, according to classical theory, superconductivity\noccurs via formation of a structure of stoichiometry H$_3$S with S atoms\narranged on a body-centered-cubic (bcc) lattice. For $P \\gtrsim 175$ GPa, the H\natoms are predicted to sit midway between two S atoms, in a structure with\n$Im\\bar3m$ symmetry. At lower pressures the H atoms move to an off-center\nposition forming a short H$-$S covalent bond and a longer H$\\cdots$S hydrogen\nbond, in a structure with $R3m$ symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments\nconfirmed the H$_3$S stoichiometry and the S lattice sites, but were unable to\ndiscriminate between the two phases. Our present ab initio density-functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations show that the quantum nuclear motion lowers the\nsymmetrization pressure by 72 GPa. Consequently, we predict that the $Im\\bar3m$\nphase is stable over the whole pressure range within which a high $T_c$ was\nmeasured. The observed pressure-dependence of $T_c$ is closely reproduced in\nour calculations for the $Im\\bar3m$ phase, but not for the $R3m$ phase. Thus,\nthe quantum nature of the proton completely rules the superconducting phase\ndiagram of H$_3$S.\n", "  We present new results through 7PN order on the energy flux from eccentric\nextreme-mass-ratio binaries. The black hole perturbation calculations are made\nat very high accuracy (200 decimal places) using a Mathematica code based on\nthe Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) analytic function expansion formalism. All\npublished coefficients in the expansion through 3PN order are confirmed and new\nanalytic and numeric terms are found to high order in $e^2$ at orders between\n3.5PN and 7PN. We also show original work in finding (nearly) arbitrarily\naccurate expansions for hereditary terms at 1.5PN, 2.5PN, and 3PN orders. We\nfit to a model where at each PN order an eccentricity singular function is\nfactored out, improving substantially the fit even as $e \\to 1$.\n", "  The particle nature of dark matter remains a mystery. In this paper, we\nconsider two dark matter models---Late Forming Dark Matter (LFDM) and\nUltra-Light Axion (ULA) models---where the matter power spectra show novel\neffects on small scales. The high redshift universe offers a powerful probe of\ntheir parameters. In particular, we study two cosmological observables: the\nneutral hydrogen (HI) redshifted 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization,\nand the evolution of the collapsed fraction of HI in the redshift range $2 < z\n< 5$. We model the theoretical predictions of the models using CDM-like N-body\nsimulations with modified initial conditions, and generate reionization fields\nusing an excursion-set model. The N-body approximation is valid on the length\nand halo mass scales studied.\n  We show that LFDM and ULA models predict an increase in the HI power spectrum\nfrom the epoch of reionization by a factor between 2--10 for a range of scales\n$0.1<k<4 \\, \\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Assuming a fiducial model where a neutral hydrogen\nfraction $\\bar{x}_{HI}=0.5$ must be achieved by $z=8$, the reionization process\nallows us to put approximate bounds on the redshift of dark matter formation\n$z_f > 4 \\times 10^5$ (for LFDM) and the axion mass $m_a > 2.6 \\times 10^{-23}\n\\, \\rm eV$ (for ULA). The comparison of the collapsed mass fraction inferred\nfrom damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ observations to the theoretical predictions of our\nmodels lead to the weaker bounds: $z_f > 2 \\times 10^5$ and $m_a > 10^{-23} \\,\n\\rm eV$. These bounds are consistent with other constraints in the literature\nusing different observables; we briefly discuss how these bounds compare with\npossible constraints from the observation of luminosity function of galaxies at\nhigh redshifts. In the case of ULAs, these constraints are also consistent with\na solution to the cusp-core problem of CDM.\n", "  We consider an application of the tetrad formalism introduced by Cardall et\nal. [Phys. Rev. D 88 (2013) 023011] to the problem of a rigidly rotating\nrelativistic gas in thermal equilibrium and discuss the possible applications\nof this formalism to relativistic lattice Boltzmann simulations. We present in\ndetail the transformation to the comoving frame, the choice of tetrad, as well\nas the explicit calculation and analysis of the components of the equilibrium\nparticle flow four-vector and of the equilibrium stress-energy tensor.\n", "  We study constraints from LHC run I on squark and gluino masses in the\npresence of squark flavor violation. Inspired by the concept of `flavored\nnaturalness', we focus on the impact of a non-zero stop-scharm mixing and mass\nsplitting in the right-handed sector. To this end, we recast four searches of\nthe ATLAS and CMS collaborations, dedicated either to third generation squarks,\nto gluino and squarks of the first two generations, or to charm-squarks. In the\nabsence of extra structure, the mass of the gluino provides an additional\nsource of fine tuning and is therefore important to consider within models of\nflavored naturalness that allow for relatively light squark states. When\ncombining the searches, the resulting constraints in the plane of the lightest\nsquark and gluino masses are rather stable with respect to the presence of\nflavor-violation, and do not allow for gluino masses of less than 1.2 TeV and\nsquarks lighter than about 550 GeV. While these constraints are stringent,\ninteresting models with sizable stop-scharm mixing and a relatively light\nsquark state are still viable and could be observed in the near future.\n", "  We study the effects of dephasing noise on a prototypical many-body localized\nsystem -- the XXZ spin 1/2 chain with a disordered magnetic field. At times\nlonger than the inverse dephasing strength the dynamics of the system is\ndescribed by a probabilistic Markov process on the space of diagonal density\nmatrices, while all off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay to zero.\nThe generator of the Markovian process is a bond-disordered spin chain. The\nscaling variable is identified, and independence of relaxation on the\ninteraction strength is demonstrated. We show that purity and von Neumann\nentropy are extensive, showing no signatures of localization, while the\noperator space entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic growth with time\nuntil the final saturation corresponding to localization breakdown, suggesting\na many-body localized dynamics of the effective Markov process.\n", "  A discrete version of deposition-diffusion equations appropriate for\ndescription of step flow on a vicinal surface is analyzed for a two-dimensional\ngrid of adsorption sites representing the stepped surface and explicitly\nincorporating kinks along the step edges. Model energetics and kinetics\nappropriately account for binding of adatoms at steps and kinks, distinct\nterrace and edge diffusion rates, and possibly asymmetric barriers for\nattachment to steps. Analysis of adatom attachment fluxes as well as limiting\nvalues of adatom densities at step edges for non-uniform deposition scenarios\nallows determination of both permeability and kinetic coefficients. Behavior of\nthese quantities is assessed as a function of key system parameters including\nkink density, step attachment barriers, and the step edge diffusion rate.\n", "  We study the evolution of global shapes of galaxies using cosmological\nsimulations. The shapes refer to the components of dark matter (DM), stars and\ngas at the stellar half-mass radius. Most galaxies undergo a characteristic\ncompaction event into a blue nugget at $z\\sim2-4$, which marks the transition\nfrom a DM-dominated central body to a self-gravitating baryonic core. We find\nthat in the high-$z$, DM-dominated phase, the stellar and DM systems tend to be\ntriaxial, preferentially prolate and mutually aligned. The elongation is\nsupported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion that originates from the\nassembly of the galaxy along a dominant large-scale filament. We estimate that\ntorques by the dominant halo are capable of inducing the elongation of the\nstellar system and its alignment with the halo. Then, in association with the\ntransition to self-gravity, small-pericenter orbits puff up and the DM and\nstellar systems evolve into a more spherical and oblate configuration, aligned\nwith the gas disc and associated with rotation. This transition typically\noccurs when the stellar mass is $\\sim 10^9$ M$_\\odot$ and the escape velocity\nin the core is $\\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that supernova feedback may\nbe effective in keeping the core DM-dominated and the system prolate. The early\nelongated phase itself may be responsible for the compaction event, and the\ntransition to the oblate phase may be associated with the subsequent quenching\nin the core.\n", "  The transport properties of the photons injected into one-dimensional\ncoupled-cavity-arrays (CCAs) are studied. It is found that the number of\nphotons cannot change the evolution cycle of the system and the time points at\nwhich W states and NOON state are obtained with a relatively higher\nprobability. Transport dynamics in the CCAs exhibits that entanglement-enhanced\nstate transmission is more effective phenomenon, and we show that for a quantum\nstate with the maximum concurrence, it can be transmitted completely without\nconsidering the case of photon loss.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations recently presented evidence of a resonance\ndecaying to pairs of photons around 750 GeV. In addition, the BaBar, Belle, and\nLHCb collaborations have evidence of lepton non-universality in the\nsemileptonic decays of $B$ mesons. In this work, we make a first step towards a\nunified explanation of these anomalies. Specifically, we extend the Standard\nModel by including vector leptoquarks and a scalar singlet that couples\nlinearly to pairs of the leptoquarks. We find there is parameter space that\ngives the correct cross section for a putative 750 GeV resonance decaying to\nphotons that is consistent with unitarity, measurements of the properties of\nthe 125 GeV Higgs boson, and direct searches for resonances in other channels.\nIn addition, we also show that constraints can be derived on any Beyond the\nStandard Model explanation of the 750 GeV resonance where the only new\nparticles are scalars, which are strong enough to rule out certain types of\nmodels entirely.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have found significant excess in the\ndiphoton invariant mass distribution near 750 GeV. We interpret this excess in\na predictive nonsupersymmetric SU(5) grand unified framework with a singlet\nscalar and light adjoint fermions. The 750 GeV resonance is identified as a\ngauge singlet scalar. Both its production and decays are induced by 24\ndimensional adjoint fermions predicted within SU(5). The adjoint fermions are\nassumed to be odd under $Z_2$ symmetry which forbids their direct coupling to\nthe standard model fermions. We show that the observed diphoton excess can be\nexplained with sub-TeV adjoint fermions and with perturbative Yukawa coupling.\nA narrow width scenario is more preferred while a simultaneous explanation of\nobserved cross section and large total decay width requires some of the adjoint\nfermions lighter than 375 GeV. The model also provides a singlet fermion as a\ncandidate of cold dark matter. The gauge coupling unification is achieved in\nthe framework by introducing color sextet scalars while being consistent with\nthe proton decay constraint.\n", "  We present several methods, which utilize symplectic integration techniques\nbased on two and three part operator splitting, for numerically solving the\nequations of motion of the disordered, discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (DDNLS)\nequation, and compare their efficiency. Our results suggest that the most\nsuitable methods for the very long time integration of this one-dimensional\nHamiltonian lattice model with many degrees of freedom (of the order of a few\nhundreds) are the ones based on three part splits of the system's Hamiltonian.\nTwo part split techniques can be preferred for relatively small lattices having\nup to $N\\approx\\;$70 sites. An advantage of the latter methods is the better\nconservation of the system's second integral, i.e. the wave packet's norm.\n", "  We introduce a generalization of Goddard-Kent-Olive (GKO) coset construction\nof two dimensional conformal field theories based on a choice of a scaled\naffine subalgebra $\\hat{\\mathfrak{h}}^s$ of a given affine Lie algebra\n$\\hat{\\mathfrak{h}}$. We study some aspects of the construction through the\nexample of Ising CFT as a generalized GKO coset of $\\text{su(2)}_1$ with a\nscaling factor $s=2$.\n", "  We report on the extraction of $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff}(M_Z)$ and\nan indirect measurement of the mass of the W boson from the forward-backward\nasymmetry of dilepton events in the $Z$ boson mass region at the Tevatron. The\ndata samples of $e^+e^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ events collected by the CDF detector\ncorrespond to the full 9.4 fb$^{-1}$ run II sample and yield an effective\nelectroweak mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff}(M_Z) = 0.23222 \\pm\n0.00046$. The corresponding result reported by the D0 collaboration with the\nfull 9.4 fb$^{-1}$ $e^+e-$ sample is $\\sin^2\\theta^{\\rm lept}_{\\rm eff}(M_Z) =\n0.23146 \\pm 0.00047$. The CDF collaboration also extracts the on-shell\nelectroweak mixing angle $ \\sin^2 \\theta_W = 0.22401 \\pm 0.00044$ which\ncorresponds to an indirect measurement of the W boson mass $M_W ({\\rm\nindirect}) = 80.327 \\pm 0.023 \\;{\\rm GeV}$. The quoted uncertainties include\nboth statistical and systematic contributions.\n", "  Interdependent networks are more fragile under random attacks than simplex\nnetworks, because interlayer dependencies lead to cascading failures and\nfinally to a sudden collapse. This is a hybrid phase transition (HPT), meaning\nthat at the transition point the order parameter has a jump but there are also\ncritical phenomena related to it. Here we study these phenomena on the\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi and the two dimensional interdependent networks and show\nthat the hybrid percolation transition exhibits two kinds of critical\nbehaviors: divergence of the fluctuations of the order parameter and power-law\nsize distribution of finite avalanches at a transition point. At the transition\npoint, avalanches of infinite size occur thus the avalanche statistics also has\nthe nature of a HPT. The exponent $\\beta_m$ of the order parameter is $1/2$\nunder general conditions, while the value of the exponent $\\gamma_m$\ncharacterizing the fluctuations of the order parameter depends on the system.\nThe critical behavior of the finite avalanches can be described by another set\nof exponents, $\\beta_a$ and $\\gamma_a$. These two critical behaviors are\ncoupled by a scaling law: $1-\\beta_m=\\gamma_a$.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to propose a nonlinear non-Markovian model of\nsubdiffusive transport that involves chemotactic substance affecting the cells\nat all time, not only during the jump. This leads the random waiting time to be\ndependent on the chemotactic gradient, making the escape rates also dependent\non the gradient as well as the nonlinear density dependence. We systematically\nderive subdiffusive fractional master equation, then we consider the diffusive\nlimit of the fractional master equation. We finally solve the resulting\nfractional subdiffusive master equation stationery and analyse the role of the\nchemotactic gradient in the resulting stationary density with a constant and a\nquadratic chemotactic gradient.\n", "  Advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave detectors use high laser\npower to achieve design sensitivity. A small part of this power is absorbed in\nthe interferometer cavity mirrors where it creates thermal lenses, causing\naberrations in the main laser beam that must be minimized by the actuation of\n\"ring heaters,\" which are additional heater elements that are aimed to reduce\nthe temperature gradients in the mirrors. In this article we derive the first,\nto the best of our knowledge, analytical model of the temperature field\ngenerated by an ideal ring heater. We express the resulting optical aberration\ncontribution to the main laser beam in this axisymmetric case. Used in\nconjunction with wavefront measurements, our model provides a more complete\nunderstanding of the thermal state of the cavity mirrors and will allow a more\nefficient use of the ring heaters in the Advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory.\n", "  The magnetic dissipative droplet is a strongly nonlinear wave structure that\ncan be stabilized in a thin film ferromagnet exhibiting perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy by use of spin transfer torque. These structures have been observed\nexperimentally at room temperature, showcasing their robustness against noise.\nHere, we quantify the effects of thermal noise by deriving the stochastic\nequations of motion for a droplet based on soliton perturbation theory. First,\nit is found that deterministic droplets are linearly unstable at large bias\ncurrents, subject to a drift instability. When the droplet is linearly stable,\nour framework allows us to analytically compute the droplet's generation\nlinewidth and center variance. Additionally, we study the influence of\nnon-local and Oersted fields with micromagnetic simulations, providing insight\ninto their effect on the generation linewidth. These results motivate detailed\nexperiments on the current and temperature-dependent linewidth as well as drift\ninstability statistics of droplets, which are important figures-of-merit in the\nprospect of droplet-based applications.\n", "  I have used Monte Carlo models with multiple scattering to predict the dust\nscattered light from our Galaxy and have compared the predictions with data in\ntwo UV bands from the GALEX spacecraft. I find that 90\\% of the scattered light\narises from less than 1000 stars with 25\\% from the 10 brightest. About half of\nthe diffuse radiation originates within 200 pc of the Sun with a maximum\ndistance of 600 pc. Multiple scattering is important at any optical depth with\n30\\% of the flux being multiply scattered even at zero reddening. I find that\nthe global distribution of the scattered light is insensitive to the dust\ndistribution with grains of $0.3 < a < 0.5$ and $g < 0.6$. There is an offset\nbetween the model and the data of 100 and 200 ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$\n\\AA$^{-1}$ in the FUV and NUV, respectively, at the poles rising to 200 --- 400\nph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$ at lower latitudes.\n  The Monte Carlo code and the models of diffuse radiation for different values\nof the optical constants are available for download.\n", "  This document was created by the Solar Simulations for the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Observatory Network (SSALMON) in preparation of the first regular\nobservations of the Sun with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA), which are anticipated to start in ALMA Cycle 4 in October 2016. The\nscience cases presented here demonstrate that a large number of scientifically\nhighly interesting observations could be made already with the still limited\nsolar observing modes foreseen for Cycle 4 and that ALMA has the potential to\nmake important contributions to answering long-standing scientific questions in\nsolar physics. With the proposal deadline for ALMA Cycle 4 in April 2016 and\nthe Commissioning and Science Verification campaign in December 2015 in sight,\nseveral of the SSALMON Expert Teams composed strategic documents in which they\noutlined potential solar observations that could be feasible given the\nanticipated technical capabilities in Cycle 4. These documents have been\ncombined and supplemented with an analysis, resulting in recommendations for\nsolar observing with ALMA in Cycle 4. In addition, the detailed science cases\nalso demonstrate the scientific priorities of the solar physics community and\nwhich capabilities are wanted for the next observing cycles. The work on this\nWhite Paper effort was coordinated in close cooperation with the two\ninternational solar ALMA development studies led by T. Bastian (NRAO, USA) and\nR. Brajsa, (ESO). This document will be further updated until the beginning of\nCycle 4 in October 2016. In particular, we plan to adjust the technical\ncapabilities of the solar observing modes once finally decided and to further\ndemonstrate the feasibility and scientific potential of the included science\ncases by means of numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere and\ncorresponding simulated ALMA observations.\n", "  These supplementary notes in the ArXiv are a companion to our paper \"Bocher\ncontractions of conformally superintegrable Laplace equations\"\n[arXiv:1512.09315]. They contain background material and the details of the\nextensive computations that couldn't be put in the paper, due to space\nlimitations.\n", "  We attempt to identify a path layout in the definition of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent T-odd parton distribution functions (TMD)s which\ncombines features of both, initial- and final-state interactions, so that it\nremains universal despite the fact that the Wilson lines entering such TMDs\nchange their orientation. The generic structure of the quark correlator for\nthis path layout is calculated.\n", "  An ultralight axion around $10^{-23}$ eV is known as a viable dark matter\ncandidate. A distinguished feature of such a dark matter is the oscillating\npressure which produces the oscillation of the gravitational potential with\nfrequency in the nano-Hz range. Recently, Khmelnitsky and Rubakov pointed out\nthat this time dependent potential induces the pulse arrival residual and could\nbe observed by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) experiment. In this paper, we\nstudy the detectability of the oscillating pressure of the axion in the\nframework of $f(R)$ theory, and show that the amplitude of the gravitational\npotential can be enhanced or suppressed compared to that in Einstein's theory\ndepending on the parameters of the $f(R)$ model and mass of the axion. In\nparticular, we investigate the Hu-Sawicki model and find the condition that the\nHu-Sawicki model is excluded.\n", "  We consider certain 1/4 BPS Wilson loop operators in SU(N) ${\\cal N}=4$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, whose expectation value can be computed\nexactly via supersymmetric localization. Holographically, these operators are\nmapped to fundamental strings in AdS5 x S5. The string on-shell action\nreproduces the large N and large coupling limit of the gauge theory expectation\nvalue and, according to the AdS/CFT correspondence, there should also be a\nprecise match between subleading corrections to these limits. We perform a test\nof such match at next-to-leading order in string theory, by deriving the\nspectrum of quantum fluctuations around the classical string solution and by\ncomputing the corresponding 1-loop effective action. We discuss in detail the\nsupermultiplet structure of the fluctuations. To remove a possible source of\nambiguity in the ghost zero mode measure, we compare the 1/4 BPS configuration\nwith the 1/2 BPS one, dual to a circular Wilson loop. We find a discrepancy\nbetween the string theory result and the gauge theory prediction, confirming a\nprevious result in the literature. We are able to track the modes from which\nthis discrepancy originates, as well as the modes that by themselves would give\nthe expected result.\n", "  We calculate the relaxation of Brinkman-Smith mode via Leggett-Takagi\nrelaxation in the presence of an isolated vortex in superfluid 3He-B. The\ncalculation is based on an analytical solution of the order parameter far from\nthe vortex axis. We obtain an expression for the dissipated power per vortex\nlength as a function of the tipping angle of the magnetization and the\norientation of the static magnetic field with respect to the vortex.\n", "  We investigate the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on the triangular\nlattice in the presence of nearest-neighbor $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor\n$J_2$ antiferromagnetic couplings. Motivated by recent findings from\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) claiming the existence of a gapped\nspin liquid with signatures of spontaneously broken lattice point group\nsymmetry [Zhu and White, Phys. Rev. B 92, 041105 (2015); Hu, Gong, Zhu, and\nSheng, Phys. Rev. B 92, 140403 (2015)], we employ the variational Monte Carlo\n(VMC) approach to analyze the model from an alternative perspective that\nconsiders both magnetically ordered and paramagnetic trial states. We find a\nquantum paramagnet in the regime $0.08\\lesssim J_2/J_1\\lesssim 0.16$, framed by\n$120^{\\circ}$ coplanar (stripe collinear) antiferromagnetic order for smaller\n(larger) $J_2/J_1$. By considering the optimization of spin-liquid wave\nfunctions of a different gauge group and lattice point group content as derived\nfrom Abrikosov mean-field theory, we obtain the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin\nliquid as the energetically most preferable state in comparison to all\nsymmetric or nematic gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquids so far advocated by\nDMRG. Moreover, by the application of few Lanczos iterations, we find the\nenergy to be the same as the DMRG result within error-bars. To further resolve\nthe intriguing disagreement between VMC and DMRG, we complement our\nmethodological approach by the pseudofermion functional renormalization group\n(PFFRG) to compare the spin structure factors for the paramagnetic regime\ncalculated by VMC, DMRG, and PFFRG. This model promises to be an ideal test-bed\nfor future numerical refinements in tracking the long-range correlations in\nfrustrated magnets.\n", "  A number of recent works have highlighted that it is possible to express the\nproperties of general-relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations in terms\nof functions that do not depend on the specific equation of state employed to\ndescribe matter at nuclear densities. These functions are normally referred to\nas \"universal relations\" and have been found to apply, within limits, both to\nstatic or stationary isolated stars, as well as to fully dynamical and merging\nbinary systems. Further extending the idea that universal relations can be\nvalid also away from stability, we show that a universal relation is exhibited\nalso by equilibrium solutions that are not stable. In particular, the mass of\nrotating configurations on the turning-point line shows a universal behaviour\nwhen expressed in terms of the normalised Keplerian angular momentum. In turn,\nthis allows us to compute the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation,\nM_{max}, simply in terms of the maximum mass of the nonrotating configuration,\nM_{TOV}, finding that M_{max} ~ (1.203 +- 0.022) M_{TOV} for all the equations\nof state we have considered. We further show that a universal relation can be\nfound between the dimensionless moment of inertia and the stellar compactness.\nAlthough this relation is not surprising as it involves two quantities that\nhave been shown to exhibit universal behaviour with other stellar properties,\nour parameterisation represents a refinement over a similar relation by\nLattimer and Schutz (2005), where a different normalisation was used, and could\nprovide an accurate tool to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter\nwhen measurements of the moment of inertia become available.\n", "  We study the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix $Q$ of a ballistic quantum dot\nsupporting $N$ scattering channels. We compute the $v$-point correlators of the\npower traces $\\mathrm{Tr} Q^{\\kappa}$ for arbitrary $v\\geq1$ at leading order\nfor large $N$ using techniques from the random matrix theory approach to\nquantum chromodynamics. We conjecture that the cumulants of the $\\mathrm{Tr}\nQ^{\\kappa}$'s are integer-valued at leading order in $N$ and include a\nMATHEMATICA code that computes their generating functions recursively.\n", "  Propelled by the increasing availability of large-scale high-quality data,\nadvanced data modeling and analysis techniques are enabling many novel and\nsignificant scientific understanding of a wide range of complex social,\nnatural, and technological systems. These developments also provide\nopportunities for studying cultural systems and phenomena -- which can be said\nto refer to all products of human creativity and way of life. An important\ncharacteristic of a cultural product is that it does not exist in isolation\nfrom others, but forms an intricate web of connections on many levels. In the\ncreation and dissemination of cultural products and artworks in particular,\ncollaboration and communication of ideas play an essential role, which can be\ncaptured in the heterogeneous network of the creators and practitioners of art.\nIn this paper we propose novel methods to analyze and uncover meaningful\npatterns from such a network using the network of western classical musicians\nconstructed from a large-scale comprehensive Compact Disc recordings data. We\ncharacterize the complex patterns in the network landscape of collaboration\nbetween musicians across multiple scales ranging from the macroscopic to the\nmesoscopic and microscopic that represent the diversity of cultural styles and\nthe individuality of the artists.\n", "  In this paper, we present data for two nanocrystalline YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO)\nsamples which both exhibit Josephson-like Colossal Resistive Switching (JCRS)\nin voltage-current (V-I) traces from 4.2 K up to room temperature, in magnetic\nfields up to 8 T. We report Josephson-like hysteresis for both positive and\nnegative current that has not been observed before in colossal resistive\nswitching materials. Non-zero resistance was measured in transport measurements\nat all temperatures. At low temperatures (< 90 K), we also observed the usual\nproperties for YBCO including weak superconducting and paramagnetic behavior,\nmeasured using ac susceptibility and magnetization measurements. The\nresistivity of these nanocrystalline samples is 3 orders of magnitude higher\nthan standard polycrystalline materials at 300 K and the temperature dependence\nsemiconductor-like. We cannot rule out the possibility that these materials\ncontain a superconducting component responsible for the JCRS behavior at room\ntemperature.\n", "  We propose that the 750 GeV resonance, presumably observed in the early LHC\nRun 2 data, could be a heavy composite axion that results from condensation of\na hypothetical quark in a high-colour representation of conventional QCD. The\nmodel, motivated by a recently proposed solution to the strong CP problem, is\nvery economical and is essentially defined by the properties of the additional\nquark - its colour charge, hypercharge and mass. The axion mass and its\ncoupling to two photons (via axial anomaly) can be computed in terms of these\nparameters. The axion is predominantly produced via photon fusion\n($\\gamma\\gamma \\to {\\cal A}$) which is followed by $ Z $ vector boson fusion\nand associated production at the LHC. We find that the total diphoton cross\nsection of the axion can be fitted with the observed excess. Combining the\nrequirement on the cross-section, such that it reproduces the diphoton excess\nevents, with the bounds on the total width ($\\Gamma_{tot} \\leqslant 45$ GeV),\nwe obtain the effective coupling in the range $1.6\\times 10^{-4}$\nGeV$^{-1}\\gtrsim C_{{\\cal A}} \\gtrsim 6.5\\times 10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-1}$. Within\nthis window of allowed couplings the model favours a narrow width resonance and\n$ y_{Q}^2 \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10)$. In addition, we observe that the associated\nproduction $q\\bar{q} \\to {\\cal A}\\gamma\\to \\gamma\\gamma\\gamma$ can potentially\nproduce a sizeable number of three photon events at future LHC and $ e^{+}\ne^{-} $ colliders. However, the rare decay $Z\\to\\mathcal{A}^*\\gamma \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma\\gamma$ is found to be too small to be probed at the LHC.\n", "  We study the possibility of utilising the constrained mass variable,\n$M_{2Cons}$, in reconstructing the semi-invisible events originated from a\nresonant production at the LHC. While this proposal is effective for any\nsimilar antler type production mechanism, here we demonstrate with potentially\ninteresting scenario, when the Higgs boson decays into a pair of third\ngeneration $\\tau$ leptons. Buoyed with a relatively large Yukawa coupling, the\nLHC has already started exploring this pair production to investigate the\nproperties of Higgs in the leptonic sector. Dominant signatures through\nhadronic decay of tau, associated with invisible neutrinos compound the\ndifficulty in the reconstruction of such events. Exploiting the already\nexisting Higgs mass bound, this new method provides a unique event\nreconstruction, together with a significant enhancement in terms of efficiency\nover the existing methods.\n", "  We investigate a phenomenological non-gravitational coupling between dark\nenergy and dark matter, where the interaction in the dark sector is\nparameterized as an energy transfer either from dark matter to dark energy or\nthe opposite. The models are constrained by a whole host of updated\ncosmological data: cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies and\npolarization, high-redshift supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift\nspace distortions and gravitational lensing. Both models are found to be\ncompatible with all cosmological observables, but in the case where dark matter\ndecays into dark energy, the tension with the independent determinations of\n$H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$, already present for standard cosmology, increases: this\nmodel in fact predicts lower $H_0$ and higher $\\sigma_8$, mostly as a\nconsequence of the higher amount of dark matter at early times, leading to a\nstronger clustering during the evolution. Instead, when dark matter is fed by\ndark energy, the reconstructed values of $H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$ nicely agree with\ntheir local determinations, with a full reconciliation between high- and\nlow-redshift observations. A non-zero coupling between dark energy and dark\nmatter, with an energy flow from the former to the latter, appears therefore to\nbe in better agreement with cosmological data.\n", "  We show how impurity atoms can measure moments of ultracold atomic gas\ndensities, using the example of bosons in a one-dimensional lattice. This\nbuilds on a body of work regarding the probing of systems by measuring the\ndephasing of an immersed qubit. We show this dephasing is captured by a\nfunction resembling characteristic functions of probability theory, of which\nthe derivatives at short times reveal moments of the system operator to which\nthe qubit couples. For a qubit formed by an impurity atom, in a system of\nultracold atoms, this operator can be the density of the system at the location\nof the impurity, and thus, means, variances, and correlations of the atomic\ndensities are accessible.\n", "  The three-chain Hubbard model for Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ known as a candidate\nmaterial for the excitonic insulator is investigated over the wide range of\nenergy gap $D$ between the two-fold degenerate conduction bands and the\nnondegenerate valence band including both semiconducting ($D>0$) and\nsemimetallic ($D<0$) cases. In the semimetallic case, the difference of the\nband degeneracy inevitably causes the imbalance of each Fermi wavenumber,\nresulting in a remarkable excitonic state characterized by the condensation of\nexcitons with finite center-of-mass momentum $q$, the so-called\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) excitonic state. With decreasing $D$\ncorresponding to increasing pressure, the obtained excitonic phase diagram\nshows a crossover from BEC ($D\\simg 0$) to BCS ($D\\siml 0$) regime, and then\nshows a distinct phase transition at a certain critical value $D_c(<0)$ from\nthe uniform ($q=0$) to the FFLO ($q\\ne 0$) excitonic state, as expected to be\nobserved in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ under high pressure.\n", "  In this short note we treat a 1+1-dimensional system of changing type. On\ndifferent spatial domains the system is of hyperbolic and elliptic type, that\nis, formally, $\\partial_t^2 u_n-\\partial_x^2 u_n = \\partial_t f$ and\n$u_n-\\partial_x^2 u_n= f$ on the respective spatial domains $\\bigcup_{j\\in\n\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}} \\big(\\frac{j-1}{n},\\frac{2j-1}{2n}\\big)$ and $\\bigcup_{j\\in\n\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}} \\big(\\frac{2j-1}{2n},\\frac{j}{n}\\big)$. We show that $(u_n)_n$\nconverges weakly to $u$, which solves the exponentially stable limit equation\n$\\partial_t^2 u +2\\partial_t u + u -4\\partial_x^2 u = 2(f+\\partial_t f)$ on\n$[0,1]$. If the elliptic equation is replaced by a parabolic one, the limit\nequation is \\emph{not} exponentially stable.\n", "  We carried out measurements of domain wall (DW) velocities driven by magnetic\nfield pulses in symmetric Pt/Co/Pt and asymmetric Pt/Co/AlOx, Pt/Co/GdOx and\nPt/Co/Gd trilayers with ultrathin Co layers and perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy. In agreement with theoretical models, the maximum observed velocity\nis much larger in the asymmetric samples, where the interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) stabilises chiral N\\'eel walls, than in\nthe symmetric stack. In addition, in Pt/Co/Gd very large DW speeds (up to 600\nm/s) are obtained, 2.5 times larger than in samples with oxidised Gd. Magnetic\nmeasurements reveal that this may be explained by the anti-parallel coupling\nbetween the magnetic moments of Gd and Co at the Gd/Co interface, leading to a\ndecrease of the total magnetisation. In quantitative agreement with analytical\nmodels, in all samples the maximum observed DW speed scales as D=Ms, where D is\nthe strength of the DMI and Ms the spontaneous magnetisation.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic behaviour of Inozemtsev's long-range elliptic spin\nchain using the Bethe ansatz equations describing the spectrum of the model in\nthe infinite-length limit. We classify all solutions of these equations in that\nlimit and argue which of these solutions determine the spectrum in the\nthermodynamic limit. Interestingly, some of the solutions are not\nselfconjugate, which puts the model in sharp contrast to one of the model's\nlimiting cases, the Heisenberg xxx spin chain. Invoking the string hypothesis\nwe derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations (TBA-equations) from which\nwe determine the Helmholtz free energy in thermodynamic equilibrium and derive\nthe associated Y-system. We corroborate our results by comparing numerical\nsolutions of the TBA-equations to a direct computation of the free energy for\nthe finite-length hamiltonian. In addition we confirm numerically the\ninteresting conjecture put forward by Finkel and Gonz\\'alez-L\\'opez that the\noriginal and supersymmetric versions of Inozemtsev's elliptic spin chain are\nequivalent in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We report an interesting magnetic behavior of a Co film (thickness ~ 350\n{\\AA}) grown on Si/Ti/Cu buffer layer by electro-deposition (ED) technique.\nUsing depth sensitive X-ray reflectivity and polarized neutron reflectivity\n(PNR) we observed two layer structures for the Co film grown by ED with a\nsurface layer (thickness ~ 100 {\\AA}) of reduced density (~ 68% of bulk)\ncompared to rest of the Co film (thickness ~ 250 {\\AA}). The two layer\nstructure is consistent with the histogram profile obtained from atomic force\nmicroscope (AFM) of the film. Interestingly, using PNR, we found that the\nmagnetization in the surface Co layer is inversely (antiferomagnetically)\ncoupled (negative magnetization for surface Co layer) with the rest of the Co\nlayer for the ED grown film. While we compare PNR result for a Co film of\nsimilar layered structure grown by sputtering, the film showed a uniform\nmagnetization as expected. We also show that the depth dependent unusual\nmagnetic behavior of ED grown Co film may be responsible for anomalous\nanisotropic magnetoresistance observed in low field in this film as compared to\nthe Co film grown by sputtering. Combining X-ray scattering, AFM,\nsuperconducting quantum interface device magnetometry (SQUID), PNR and\nmagneto-transport measurements we attempted to correlate and compare the\nstructural, magnetic and morphological properties with magneto-transport of Co\nfilms grown by ED and sputtering. The study indicates that the interesting\nsurface magnetic property and magneto-transport property of the ED film is\ncaused by its unique surface morphology.\n", "  We present a construction of new bound entangled states from given bound\nentangled states for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems. One way to\nconstruct bound entangled states is to show that these states are PPT (positive\npartial transpose) and violate the range criterion at the same time. By\napplying certain operators to given bound entangled states or to one of the\nsubsystems of the given bound entangled states, we obtain a set of new states\nwhich are both PPT and violate the range criterion. We show that the derived\nbound entangled states are not local unitary equivalent to the original bound\nentangled states by detail examples.\n", "  We have produced in the Nuclear Physics Center in Lisbon thin film\nself-supported targets of Ag, LiF/Ag and CaF$_2$/Ag by a high vacuum resistance\nevaporation method. The production setup, materials, methods, characterization\nand results are described.\n", "  Based on our previous study [IS2] we develop fully the stationary scattering\ntheory for the Schrodinger operator on a manifold possessing an escape\nfunction. A particular class of examples are manifolds with Euclidean and/or\nhyperbolic ends, possibly with unbounded and non-smooth obstacles. We develop\nthe theory largely along the classical lines [Sa, Co] and derive in particular\nWKB- asymptotics of appropriate generalized eigenfunctions. As an application\nwe solve a conjecture of [HPW] on cross-ends transmissions in its natural and\nstrong form within the framework of our theory.\n", "  We describe the coupling of matter fields to an inflationary sector of\nsupergravity, the inflaton $\\Phi$ and a stabilizer $S$, in models where the\nKahler potential has a flat inflaton direction. Such models include, in\nparticular, advanced versions of the hyperbolic $\\alpha$-attractor models with\na flat inflaton direction Kahler potential, providing a good fit to the\nobservational data. If the superpotential is at least quadratic in the matter\nfields $U^{i}$, with restricted couplings to the inflaton sector, we prove that\nunder certain conditions: i) The presence of the matter fields does not affect\na successful inflationary evolution. ii) There are no tachyons in the matter\nsector during and after inflation. iii) The matter masses squared are higher\nthan $3H^2$ during inflation. The simplest class of theories satisfying all\nrequired conditions is provided by models with a flat direction Kahler\npotential, and with the inflaton $\\Phi$ and a stabilizer $S$ belonging to a\nhidden sector, so that matter fields have no direct coupling to the\ninflationary sector in the Kahler potential and in the superpotential.\n", "  We present a study of the performance of endoreversible thermal machines\noptimized with respect to the thermodynamic force associated with the cold bath\nin the regime of small thermodynamic forces. These thermal machines can work\neither as an engine or as a refrigerator. We analyze how the optimal\nperformances are determined by the dependence of the thermodynamic flux on the\nforces. The results are motivated and illustrated with a quantum model, the\nthree level maser, and explicit analytical expressions of the engine efficiency\nas a function of the system parameters are given.\n", "  We study the minimum time related to the quantum speed limit that\ncharacterizes the evolution of an open quantum system with the help of a simple\nmodel in the short and long time limits. We compare in particular the situation\ncorresponding to a unique state and several states in the environment space.\nFor short time intervals the results show a sensible difference in the\nbehaviour of the system for different strengths of the interaction between the\nsystem and its environment.\n", "  We define a Lie bracket on a certain set of local vector fields along a null\ncurve in a 4-dimensional semi-Riemannian space form. This Lie bracket will be\nemployed to study integrability properties of evolution equations for null\ncurves in a pseudo-Euclidean space. In particular, a geometric recursion\noperator generating infinite many local symmetries for the null localized\ninduction equation is provided.\n", "  We explore the evolutionary behaviors of compact objects in a modified\ngravitational theory with the help of structure scalars. Particularly, we\nconsider the spherical geometry coupled with heat and radiation emitting\nshearing viscous matter configurations. We construct structure scalars by\nsplitting the Riemann tensor orthogonally in $f(R,T)$ gravity with and without\nconstant $R$ and $T$ constraints, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor. We investigate the influence of\nmodification of gravity on the physical meaning of scalar functions for\nradiating spherical matter configurations. It is explicitly demonstrated that\neven in modified gravity, the evolutionary phases of relativistic stellar\nsystems can be analyzed through the set of modified scalar functions.\n", "  The $e^+ e^- \\to K^0_{S}K^0_{L}$ and $e^+ e^- \\to K^{-}K^{+}$ cross sections\nhave been measured in the center-of-mass energy range 1004--1060 MeV for 25\nenergy points with about 2$\\div$3\\% systematic uncertainties. The analysis is\nbased on 5.5 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the CMD-3\ndetector at the VEPP-2000 $e^+ e^-$ collider. The measured cross section is\napproximated according to Vector Meson Dominance model as a sum of $\\phi,\n\\omega, \\rho$-like amplitudes and their excitations, and $\\phi(1020)$ meson\nparameters have been obtained.\n", "  To describe two-place physical problems, many possible models named Alice-Bob\n(AB) systems are proposed. To find and to solve these systems, the Parity (P),\ntime reversal (T), charge conjugation (C), shifted-parity ($P_s$, parity with a\nshift), delayed time reversal ($T_d$, time reversal with a delay) and their\npossible combinations such as PT, PC, $P_sC$, $P_sT_d$ and $P_sT_dC$ etc. can\nbe successively used. Especially, some special types of $P_s$-$T_d$-$C$ group\ninvariant multi-soliton solutions for the KdV-KP-Toda type, mKdV-sG type, NLS\ntype and discrete $H_1$ type AB systems are explicitly constructed.\n", "  Mono-arsenide CrAs, endures a helical anti-ferromagnetic order transition at~\n265 K under ambient pressure. Recently, pressure-induced-superconductivity was\ndiscovered vicinity to the helical anti-ferromagnetic order in CrAs[Wei Wu et\nal., Nature Communications 5, 5508 (2014).]. However, the size of crystal grown\nvia tin flux method is as small as 1 mm in longest dimension. In this work, we\nreport the single crystal growth of CrAs with size of 1 * 5 * 1 mm3 via\nchemical vapor transport method and its physical properties.\n", "  The small fraction of the quark polarization of the nucleon obtained in deep\ninelastic lepton scattering is a consequence of a wrong assumption on the flux\nof polarized virtual photons in the analysis of the data. The true flux of\npolarized photons is due to fluctuations into strongly interacting\nquark-antiquarks at least 20\\% smaller than assumed and, therefore, the quark\npolarization is larger. Realizing this peculiarity the quark polarization\nagrees with that given by the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule, i.e. is consistent with the\nprediction derived from the experimentally determined weak coupling constants.\nIt also solves the problem with the under-exhaustion of the fundamental\nBjorken-sum rule. However, it has to be realized that the fluctuations render\nit impossible to measure the quark spin with credibility.\n", "  A novel neutron spin resonance technique is presented based on the well-know\nneutron spin echo method. In a first proof-of-principle measurement using a\nmonochromatic neutron beam, it is demonstrated that relative velocity changes\nof down to a precision of $4 \\times 10^{-7}$ can be resolved, corresponding to\nan energy resolution of better than 3~neV. Currently, the sensitivity is only\nlimited by counting statistics and not by systematic effects. An improvement by\nanother two orders of magnitude can be achieved with a dedicated setup,\nallowing for energy resolutions in the 10~peV regime. The new technique is\nideally suited for investigations in the field of precision fundamental neutron\nphysics, but will also be beneficial in scattering applications.\n", "  The correlations of the crust-core transition density and pressure in neutron\nstars with the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron skin thickness are\ninvestigated, using different families of relativistic mean field\nparametrizations with constant couplings and non-linear terms mixing the\n$\\sigma$, $\\omega$ and $\\rho$-meson fields. It is shown that the modification\nof the density dependence of the symmetry energy, involving the $\\sigma$ or the\n$\\omega$ meson, gives rise to different behaviors: the effect of the\n$\\omega$-meson may also be reproduced within non-relativistic phenomenological\nmodels, while the effect of the $\\sigma$-meson is essentially relativistic.\nDepending on the parametrization with $\\sigma-\\rho$ or $\\omega-\\rho$ mixing\nterms, different values of the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation must\nbe considered in order to obtain a neutron matter equation of state compatible\nwith results from chiral effective field theory. This difference leads to\ndifferent pressures at the crust-core transition density. A linear correlation\nbetween the transition density and the symmetry energy slope or the neutron\nskin thickness of the $^{208}$Pb nucleus is obtained, only when the\n$\\omega$-meson is used to describe the density dependence of the symmetry\nenergy. A comparison is made between the crust-core transition properties of\nneutron stars obtained by three different methods, the Relativistic Random\nPhase Approximation (RRPA), the Vlasov equation and Thermodynamical method. It\nis shown that the RRPA and the Vlasov methods predict similar transition\ndensities for $pne$ $\\beta$-equilibrium stellar matter.\n", "  The frequency dependent polarizabilities of the francium atom are calculated\nfrom the available data of energy levels and transition rates. Magic\nwavelengths for the state insensitive optical dipole trapping are identified\nfrom the calculated light shifts of the $7s~^2S_{1/2}$, $7p~^2P_{1/2, 3/2}$ and\n$8s~^{2}S_{1/2}$ levels of the $7s~^{2}S_{1/2}-7p~^{2}P_{1/2,3/2}$ and\n$7s~^{2}S_{1/2}-8s~^{2}S_{1/2}$ transitions, respectively. Wavelengths in the\nultraviolet, visible and near infrared region is identified that are suitable\nfor cooling and trapping. Magic wavelengths between 600-700~nm and 700-1000~nm\nregion, which are blue and red detuned with the $7s-7p$ and $7s-8s$ transitions\nare feasible to implement as lasers with sufficient power are available. In\naddition, we calculated the tune-out wavelengths where the ac polarizability of\nthe ground $7s~^{2}S_{1/2}$ state in francium is zero. These results are\nbeneficial as laser cooled and trapped francium has been in use for fundamental\nsymmetry investigations like searches for an electron permanent electric dipole\nmoment in an atom and for atomic parity non-conservation.\n", "  The next generation of far infrared space observatories will require\nextremely sensitive detectors that can be realized only by combining extremely\nlow intrinsic noise with high optical efficiency. We have measured the\nbroad-band optical response of ultra-sensitive TES bolometers (NEP$\\approx2\\rm\\\naW/\\sqrt Hz$) in the 30--60-$\\mu\\rm m$ band where radiation is coupled to the\ndetectors with a few-moded conical feedhorn and a hemispherical backshort. We\nshow that these detectors have an optical efficiency of 60% (the ratio of the\npower detected by the TES bolometer to the total power propagating through the\nfeedhorn). We find that the measured optical efficiency can be understood in\nterms of the modes propagating through the feedhorn with the aid of a spatial\nmode-filtering technique.\n", "  We investigate the effects of a modified dispersion relation proposed by\nMajhi and Vagenas on the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole thermodynamics in a\nuniverse with large extra dimensions. It is shown that entropy, temperature and\nheat capacity receive new corrections and charged black holes in this framework\nhave less degrees of freedom and decay faster compared to black holes in the\nHawking picture. We also study the emission rate of black hole and compare our\nresults with other quantum gravity approaches. In this regard, the existence of\nthe logarithmic prefactor and the relation between dimensions and charge are\ndiscussed. This procedure is not only valid for a single horizon spacetime but\nit is also valid for the spacetimes with inner and outer horizons.\n", "  This thesis compiles the results of six works which deal with - inflationary\nmodel building and estimation of cosmological parameters from various field\ntheoretic setup, quantification of reheating temperature, studies of\nleptogenesis in braneworld and estimation of primordial non-Gaussianity from\n${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity using $\\delta N$ formalism. We start our discussion\nwith exploring the possibility of MSSM inflation in the light of recent\nobserved data from various D -flat directions using the saddle and inflection\npoint techniques. The effective inflaton potential around saddle point and\ninflection point have been utilized in estimating the observable parameters and\nconfronting them with WMAP7 and Planck dataset. Next we explore the possibility\nof inflation from the five dimensional ${\\cal N} = 2$ supergravity setup by\nderiving the effective potential in the context of RS like braneworld model and\nDBI Galileon. After deriving an four dimensional effective potential, we obtain\nthe inflationary observables from both the scenarios and confront them with the\nWMAP data. Further we fit the CMB angular power spectra from TT anisotropy and\nother polarization data obtained from WMAP. Further, we discuss the non-trivial\nfeatures of reheating from supergravity inspired braneworld model, where the\nresults are to some extent different from that of the usual low energy GR\ncounterpart, because of the modified Friedmann equations in this setup. We\nexplicitly derive the analytical expressions for the reheating temperature and\nfurther solve the evolution equation of the number density of thermal gravitino\nwhich results in the gravitino abundance. Finally, we study the primordial\nlocal type of non-Gaussian features using $\\delta N$ formalism for a generic\nclass of sub-Planckian models dominated by the Hubble-induced corrections\nwithin ${\\cal N} = 1$ supergravity framework.\n", "  We show that only a few percentage of Sn doping at the Ba site on\nBaFe$_2$As$_2$, can cause electronic topological transition, namely, the\nLifshitz transition. A hole like d$_{xy}$ band of Fe undergoes electron like\ntransition due to 4\\% Sn doping. Lifshitz transition is found in BaFe$_2$As$_2$\nsystem around all the high symmetry points. Our detailed first principles\nsimulation predicts absence of any Lifshitz transition in other 122 family\ncompounds like SrFe$_2$As$_2$, CaFe$_2$As$_2$. This work bears practical\nsignificance due to the facts that a few percentage of Sn impurity is in-built\nin tin-flux grown single crystals method of synthesizing 122 materials and\ninter-relationship among the Lifshitz transition, magnetism and\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Thermally activated delayed fluorescence has been reported in a number of\nOLED emitter materials engineered to have low singlet-triplet energy gaps. Here\nwe derive closed solutions for steady state and transient behaviors, and apply\nthese results to obtain the singlet and triplet relaxation, forward and reverse\ncrossing rates and the gap energy and reverse crossing prefactor from delayed\nand prompt relaxation rates measured over a series of temperatures. The primary\nrates are then used to calculate the fluorescent/phosphorescent ratio and the\nsinglet/triplet population ratio. The method avoids the need for gated yield\nmeasurements. Good fits are obtained using previously published data for 4CzIPN\nand m-MTDATA:t-Bu-PBD and the results appear to be consistent with reported\nquantities were available, and with reported behaviors of OLEDS that use these\nmaterials.\n", "  There are successful applications of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence\nto high energy and condensed matter physics. We apply the holographic approach\nto photosynthesis that is an important example of nontrivial quantum phenomena\nrelevant for life which is being studied in the emerging field of quantum\nbiology. Light harvesting complexes of photosynthetic organisms are many-body\nquantum systems, in which quantum coherence has recently been experimentally\nshown to survive for relatively long time scales even at the physiological\ntemperature despite the decohering effects of their environments.\n  We use the holographic approach to evaluate the time dependence of\nentanglement entropy and quantum mutual information in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson\n(FMO) protein-pigment complex in green sulfur bacteria during the transfer of\nan excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center. It is\ndemonstrated that the time evolution of the mutual information simulating the\nLindblad master equation in some cases can be obtained by means of a dual\ngravity describing black hole formation in the AdS-Vaidya spacetime. The wake\nup and scrambling times for various partitions of the FMO complex are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Understanding heat transfer characteristics of phase change and enhancing\nthermal energy transport in nanoscale are of great interest in both theoretical\nand practical applications. In the present study, we investigated the nanoscale\nvaporization and condensation by using molecular dynamics simulation. A cuboid\nsystem is modeled by placing hot and cold walls in the bottom and top ends and\nfilling with working fluid between the two walls. By setting two different high\ntemperatures for the hot wall, we showed the normal and explosive vaporizations\nand their impacts on thermal transport. For the cold wall, the cuboid\nnanostructures with fixed height, varied length, width ranging from 4 to 20\nlayers, and an interval of 4 layers are constructed to study the effects of\ncondensation induced by different nanostructures. For vaporization, the results\nshowed that higher temperature of the hot wall led to faster transport of the\nworking fluid as a cluster moving from the hot wall to the cold wall. However,\nexcessive temperature of the hot wall causes explosive boiling, which seems not\ngood for the transport of heat due to the less phase change of working fluid.\nFor condensation, the results indicate that nanostructure facilitates\ncondensation, which could be affected not only by the increased surface area\nbut also by the distances between surfaces of the nanostructures and the cold\nend. There is an optimal nanosctructure scheme which maximizes the phase change\nrate of the entire system.\n", "  A review is given on the thermodynamical structure of bipartite entanglement.\nBy comparing it to the axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics presented by\nGiles it is shown that for finite dimensional systems the two theories are\nformally inequivalent. The same approach is used to demonstrate the full\nequivalence in the asymptotic limit for pure quantum states. For mixed states a\ndifferent method for obtaining the second law is described applied to two\ndifferent classes of operations, PPT-preserving and asymptotically\nnon-entangling operations.\n", "  Under current LHC and dark matter constraints, the general NMSSM can have\nself-interacting dark matter to explain the cosmological small structure. In\nthis scenario, the dark matter is the light singlino-like neutralino ($\\chi$)\nwhich self-interacts through exchanging the light singlet-like scalars ($h_1,\na_1$). These light scalars and neutralinos inevitably interact with the 125 GeV\nSM-like Higgs boson ($h_{SM}$), which cause the Higgs exotic decays $h_{SM} \\to\nh_1 h_1, a_1 a_1, \\chi\\chi$. We first demonstrate the parameter space required\nby the explanation of the cosmological small structure and then display the\nHiggs exotic decays. We find that in such a parameter space the Higgs exotic\ndecays can have branching ratios of a few percent, which should be accessible\nin the future $e^+e^-$ colliders.\n", "  In this paper we propose a very special relativity (VSR)-inspired\ngeneralization of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) electrodynamics. This proposal\nis based upon the construction of a proper study of the SIM$(1)$--VSR\ngauge-symmetry. It is shown that the VSR nonlocal effects present a significant\nand health departure from the usual MCS theory. The classical dynamics is\nanalysed in full detail, by studying the solution for the electric field and\nstatic energy for this configuration. Afterwards, the interaction energy\nbetween opposite charges are derived and we show that the VSR effects play an\nimportant part in obtaining a (novel) finite expression for the static\npotential.\n", "  We briefly review the instanton-torus knot duality found in 5d SUSY gauge\ntheories with one compact dimension. The fermion condensate turn out to be the\ngenerating function for the torus knot polynomials colored by the fundamental\nrepresentation.\n", "  Variable star analysis and classification is an important task in the\nunderstanding of stellar features and processes. While historically\nclassifications have been done manually by highly skilled experts, the recent\nand rapid expansion in the quantity and quality of data has demanded new\ntechniques, most notably automatic classification through supervised machine\nlearning. We present an expansion of existing work on the field by analyzing\nvariable stars in the {\\em Kepler} field using an ensemble approach, combining\nmultiple characterization and classification techniques to produce improved\nclassification rates. Classifications for each of the roughly 150,000 stars\nobserved by {\\em Kepler} are produced separating the stars into one of 14\nvariable star classes.\n", "  We study equilibrium configurations of infinitely many identical particles on\nthe real line or finitely many particles on the circle, such that the\n(repelling) force they exert on each other depends only on their distance. The\nmain question is whether each equilibrium configuration needs to be an\narithmetic progression. Under very broad assumptions on the force we show this\nfor the particles on the circle. In the case of infinitely many particles on\nthe line we show the same result under the assumption that the maximal (or the\nminimal) gap between successive points is finite (positive) and assumed at some\npair of successive points. Under the assumption of analyticity for the force\nfield (e.g., the Coulomb force) we deduce some extra rigidity for the\nconfiguration: knowing an equilibrium configuration of points in a half-line\ndetermines it throughout. Various properties of the equlibrium configuration\nare proved.\n", "  The idea of \"summing over all intermediate states\" that is central for\nimplementing locality in quantum systems can be realized by coend\nconstructions. In the concrete case of systems of conformal blocks for a\ncertain class of conformal vertex algebras, one deals with coends in functor\ncategories. Working with these coends involves quite a few subtleties which,\neven though they have in principle already been understood twenty years ago,\nhave not been sufficiently appreciated by the conformal field theory community.\n", "  The 39th Scandinavian Symposium on Physical Acoustics was held at Geilo,\nNorway from January 31 to February 3, 2016. It was arranged by the Acoustics\nand Optics group of the Norwegian Physical Society, and was coordinated by Ulf\nKristiansen and Erlend Magnus Viggen. This year, there were 48 participants,\nholding a total of 31 presentations on various topics in physical acoustics,\nsuch as ultrasonics, underwater sound propagation, waves in solids, flow\nacoustics, and sonar. After the conference, 9 of these presentations were\nsubmitted as papers to these proceedings.\n", "  We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the\nnonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed\nwithin the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the\nflow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid\npossible artifacts coming from field expansions which consists in keeping only\na limited number of coupling constants. We present a simple numerical method to\nfollow the fixed point solution of our equations by changing gradually the\ndimension d and the number N of spin-components. We explain in details the\nadvantage of this method as well as the numerical difficulties we encounter,\nwhich become severe close to d = 2. The function N_c(d) separating the regions\nof first and second order in the (d,N) plane is computed for d between 4 and\n2.2. Our results confirm what was previously found within cruder approximation\nof the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative\napproach and the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.\n", "  A new computational scheme to analyze electron transfer (ET) pathways in\nlarge biomolecules is presented with applications to ETs in bacterial\nphotosynthetic reaction center. It consists of a linear combination of fragment\nmolecular orbitals and an electron tunneling current analysis, which enables an\nefficient first-principles analysis of ET pathways in large biomolecules. The\nscheme has been applied to the ET from menaquinone to ubiquinone via nonheme\niron complex in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center. It has revealed that\nnot only the central Fe$^{2+}$ ion but also particular histidine ligands are\ninvolved in the ET pathways in such a way to mitigate perturbations that can be\ncaused by metal ion substitution and depletion, which elucidates the\nexperimentally observed insensitivity of the ET rate to these perturbations.\n", "  We investigate quasinormal modes (QNMs) and Hawking radiation of a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole sur-rounded by quintessence. The\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method is used to evaluate the QNMs and the\nrate of radiation. The results show that due to the interaction of the\nquintessence with the background metric, the QNMs of the black hole damp more\nslowly when increasing the density of quintessence and the black hole radiates\nat slower rate.\n", "  The KL2016 Workshop is following the Letter of Intent LoI12-15-001 \"Physics\nOpportunities with Secondary KL beam at JLab\" submitted to PAC43 with the main\nfocus on the physics of excited hyperons produced by the Kaon beam on\nunpolarized and polarized targets with GlueX setup in Hall D. Such studies will\nbroaden a physics program of hadron spectroscopy extending it to the strange\nsector. The Workshop was organized to get a feedback from the community to\nstrengthen physics motivation of the LoI and prepare a full proposal.\n  Further details about the Workshop can be found on the web page of the\nconference: http://www.jlab.org/conferences/kl2016/index.html .\n", "  A tool that can constrain, in minutes, beyond-the-standard-model parameters\nlike electric dipole moments (EDM) down to a lower-bound\n$d_\\text{e}^{\\cal{N}}<10^{-37}\\text{e}\\cdot\\text{cm}$ in bulk materials, or the\ncoupling of axion-like particles (ALP) to photons down to\n$|G_{a\\gamma\\gamma}|<10^{-16}$~GeV$^{-1}$, is described.

When nuclear magnetic moments in the London penetration depth align\nwith $\\vec{B}$, the bulk magnetization is always accompanied by an EDM-induced\nbulk electric field $\\vec{E}\\propto\\vec{B}$ that generates detectable\noscillatory supercurrents with a characteristic frequency\n$\\omega_{\\text{D}}\\propto d_\\text{e}^{\\cal{N}}$. Cold dark matter (CDM) ALP are\nformally similar where $\\omega_\\text{D}\\propto\n|G_{a\\gamma\\gamma}|\\sqrt{n_a/(2m_a)}$ with $m_a$ the ALP mass and $n_a$ its\nnumber density. A space probe traversing a dark matter hair with a dipole\namplifier is sensitive enough to detect ALP density variations if\n$|G_{a\\gamma\\gamma}|\\sqrt{n_h/(2m_a)}>4.9\\cdot10^{-27}$ where $n_h$ is the ALP\nnumber density in the hair.\n", "  We study chiral algebras associated with Argyres-Douglas theories engineered\nfrom M5 brane. For the theory engineered using 6d $(2,0)$ type $J$ theory on a\nsphere with a single irregular singularity (without mass parameter), its chiral\nalgebra is the minimal model of W algebra of $J$ type. For the theory\nengineered using an irregular singularity and a regular full singularity, its\nchiral algebra is the affine Kac-Moody algebra of $J$ type. We can obtain the\nSchur index of these theories by computing the vacua character of the\ncorresponding chiral algebra.\n", "  The recently proposed generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF)\n\\cite{sahneh2013generalized} lays the groundwork for systematically\nconstructing a broad spectrum of stochastic spreading processes over complex\nnetworks. This article builds an algorithm for exact, continuous-time numerical\nsimulation of GEMF-based processes. Moreover the implementation of this\nalgorithm, GEMFsim, is available in popular scientific programming platforms\nsuch as MATLAB, R, Python, and C; GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic\nspreading models that fit in GEMF framework. Using these simulations one can\nexamine the accuracy of mean-field-type approximations that are commonly used\nfor analytical study of spreading processes on complex networks.\n", "  The size distribution of asteroids in the solar system suggests that they\nformed top-down, with 100-1000 km bodies forming from the gravitational\ncollapse of dense clumps of small solid particles. We investigate the\nconditions under which solid particles can form dense clumps in a\nprotoplanetary disc. We used a hydrodynamic code to model the solid-gas\ninteraction in disc. We found that particles down to millimeter size can form\ndense clumps, but only in regions where solids make $\\sim$ 8% of the local\nsurface density. More generally, we mapped the range of particle sizes and\nconcentrations that is consistent with the formation of particle clumps.\n", "  The effects of photon bunching and antibunching correspond to the classical\nand quantum features of the electromagnetic field, respectively. No direct\nevidence suggests whether these effects can be potentially related to quantum\nentanglement. Here we design a cavity quantum electrodynamics model with two\natoms trapped in to demonstrate the connections between the steady-state photon\nstatistics and the two-atom entanglement . It is found that within the weak\ndissipations and to some good approximation, the local maximal two-atom\nentanglements perfectly correspond to not only the quantum feature of the\nelectromagnetic field---the optimal photon antibunching, but also the classical\nfeature---the optimal photon bunching. We also analyze the influence of strong\ndissipations and pure dephasing. An intuitive physical understanding is also\ngiven finally.\n", "  We first find the linearized gravitational field of a static spherically\nsymmetric mass distribution in massive conformal gravity. Then we test this\nfield with two solar system experiments: deflection of light by the sun and\nradar echo delay. The result is that the linear massive conformal gravity\nagrees with the linear general relativistic observations in the solar system.\nHowever, besides the standard general relativistic deflection of light, the\ntheory gives an extra deflection at galactic scales. It is likely that this\nadditional deflection replaces the effects of dark matter in general\nrelativity.\n", "  Anomalously large fluctuation diamagnetism around the superconducting\ncritical temperature has been recently observed on iron selenide (FeSe) [S.\nKasahara et al., unpublished]. This indicates that superconducting fluctuations\n(SCFs) play a more significant role in FeSe, which supposedly has two-band\nstructure, than in the familiar single-band superconductors. Motivated by the\ndata in FeSe, SCF-induced diamagnetism is examined in a two-band system, on the\nbasis of a phenomenological approach with a Ginzburg-Landau functional. The\nobtained results indicate that the SCF-induced diamagnetism may be more\nenhanced than that in a single-band system due to the existence of two distinct\nfluctuation modes. Such enhancement of diamagnetism unique to a two-band system\nseems consistent with the large diamagnetism observed on FeSe, though still far\nfrom a quantitative agreement.\n", "  In this article we present a pedagogical discussion of some of the\noptomechanical properties of a high finesse cavity loaded with ultracold atoms\nin laser induced synthetic gauge fields of different types. Essentially, the\nsubject matter of this article is an amalgam of two sub-fields of atomic\nmolecular and optical (AMO) physics namely, the cavity optomechanics with\nultracold atoms and ultracold atoms in synthetic gauge field. After providing a\nbrief introduction to either of these fields we shall show how and what\nproperties of these trapped ultracold atoms can be studied by looking at the\ncavity (optomechanical or transmission) spectrum. In presence of abelian\nsynthetic gauge field we discuss the cold-atom analogue of Shubnikov de Haas\noscillation and its detection through cavity spectrum. Then, in the presence of\na non-abelian synthetic gauge field (spin-orbit coupling), we see when the\nelectromagnetic field inside the cavity is quantized, it provides a quantum\noptical lattice for the atoms, leading to the formation of different quantum\nmagnetic phases. We also discuss how these phases can be explored by studying\nthe cavity transmission spectrum.\n", "  A modified conventional three-transducer reciprocity calibration method is\nused to measure the magnitude and phase responses of the transmitting voltage\nresponse and the free-field open-circuit receiving voltage sensitivity of\nultrasonic piezoelectric transducers radiating in air at 1 atm. The transducers\nused in this work are 20 x 2 mm circular piezoelectric ceramic disks with their\nfirst and second radial modes at approximately 100 and 250 kHz, respectively.\nThe transducer characterization is supported and aided by finite element\nsimulations of the measurement system and the measured frequency responses.\nPreliminary results indicate that the magnitude and phase responses of the\ntransmitting voltage response and the free-field open-circuit receiving voltage\nsensitivity can be measured with fair accuracy in a limited frequency band\naround the first radial mode of the piezoelectric ceramic disk. Further work is\nneeded to demonstrate and quantify the accuracy actually obtained using the\nthree-transducer reciprocity calibration method, to achieve transducer\ncharacterization at a calibration accuracy level, and to achieve calibration\nabove the calibrated frequency range of the B&K 4138 microphone.\n", "  Reflection of sound from ice sheets floating on water is simulated using\nThomson and Haskell's method of matrix propagation. The reflection coefficient\nis computed as a function of incidence angle and frequency for selected ice\nparameters of a uniform sheet and two layered ice sheets. At some incidence\nangles and frequencies the reflection coefficient has very low values. It is\nshown that this is related to generation of Lamb waves in the ice. The matrix\npropagation method also provides a dispersion equation for a plate loaded with\nfluid on one side and vacuum on the other. Finally the concept of beam\ndisplacement is briefly discussed.\n", "  As is well known, the sound-speed profile has significant effects on\nunderwater acoustic sound propagation. These effects can be quantified by\nnormal-mode models, for example. The basic case is a laterally homogeneous\nmedium, for which the sound speed and the density depend on depth only and not\non horizontal position. Effects of horizontal medium-parameter variation can be\nquantified by coupled-mode models, with coupling between mode expansions for\nlaterally homogeneous parts of the medium. In the present paper, these effects\nare illustrated for media with a particularly simple horizontal parameter\nvariation such that mode shapes do not vary with horizontal position. The modal\nwavenumbers depend on horizontal position, however. At a vertical interface\nbetween regions with laterally homogeneous medium parameters, each mode is\nreflected as well as transmitted. For the media considered, reflection and\ntransmission coefficients can be computed separately for each mode without mode\ncoupling, and this is done recursively, stepping through the laterally\nhomogeneous regions in appropriate order. Continuous-wave as well as pulse\ncomputations are used to illustrate frequency-dependent reflections from ridges\nand diffraction into shadow zones behind islands, for example.\n", "  Ultrasensitive optical detection of nanometer-scaled particles is highly\ndesirable for applications in early-stage diagnosis of human diseases,\nenvironmental monitoring, and homeland security, but remains extremely\ndifficult due to ultralow polarizabilities of small-sized, low-index particles.\nOptical whispering-gallery-mode microcavities, which can enhance significantly\nthe light-matter interaction, have emerged as promising platforms for\nlabel-free detection of nanoscale objects. Different from the conventional\nwhispering-gallery-mode sensing relying on the reactive (i.e., dispersive)\ninteraction, here we propose and demonstrate to detect single lossy\nnanoparticles using the dissipative interaction in a high-$Q$ toroidal\nmicrocavity. In the experiment, detection of single gold nanorods in an aqueous\nenvironment is realized by monitoring simultaneously the linewidth change and\nshift of the cavity mode. The experimental result falls within the theoretical\nprediction. Remarkably, the reactive and dissipative sensing methods are\nevaluated by setting the probe wavelength on and off the surface plasmon\nresonance to tune the absorption of nanorods, which demonstrates clearly the\ngreat potential of the dissipative sensing method to detect lossy\nnanoparticles. Future applications could also combine the dissipative and\nreactive sensing methods, which may provide better characterizations of\nnanoparticles.\n", "  Acoustic measurements on a vortex whistle corroborates earlier findings that\nthe frequency increases linearly with the velocity of the air flowing into the\nwhistle. Measurements in a reverberant chamber shows that the acoustic power\ngenerated by the whistle increases close to the sixth power of the frequency.\nPIV and hot-wire measurements give quantitative information on the flow. It is\nshown that the flow exits the pipe as a swirling annulus with a rotation\ncorresponding to the frequency of the sound, and that the center of the swirl\nfollows a nearly circular path in the exit plane. The PIV measurements also\nindicate a toroidal vortex with inflow along the center line close to the exit\nof the whistle.\n", "  Routing for low latency underwater acoustic network-communication is\ninvestigated. The application is monitoring of ice-threats to offshore\noperations in the Arctic - to provide warnings that enable operators to react\nto such threats. The scenario produces relatively high traffic load, and the\nnetwork should favour low delay and adequate reliability rather than energy\nusage minimization. The ICRP (Information-Carrying based Routing Protocol),\noriginally proposed by Wei Liang et al. in 2007, is chosen as basis. ICRP\nobtains unicast routing paths by sending data payload as broadcast packets when\nno route information is available. Thus, data can be delivered without the cost\nof reactive signalling latency. In this paper we explore the capabilities of a\nslightly enhanced/adapted ICRP, tailored to the ice monitoring application. By\nsimulations and experiments at sea it is demonstrated that the protocol\nperforms well and can manage the applications high traffic load - this provided\nthat the point-to-point links provide sufficient bit rates and capacity\nheadroom.\n", "  This article presents a set of acoustic measurements conducted on the Statoil\nfunded Behind Casing Logging Set-Up, designed by SINTEF Petroleum Research to\nresemble an oil well casing. A set of simple simulations using COMSOL\nMultiphysics were also conducted and the results compared with the\nmeasurements. The experiments consists of measuring the pressure wave radiated\nof a set of Lamb waves propagating in a 3 mm thick steel plate, using the so\ncalled pitch-catch method. The Lamb waves were excited by a broadband\npiezoelectric immersion transducer with center frequency of 1 MHz. Through\nmeasurements and analysis the group velocity of the fastest mode in the plate\nwas found to be 3138.5 m/s. Measuring the wave radiated into the water in a\ngrid consisting of 8x33 measuring points, the spreading of the plate wave\nnormal to the direction of propagation was investigated. Comparing the point\nwhere the amplitude had decreased 50 % relative to the amplitude measured at\nthe axis pointing straight forward from the transducer shows that the wave\nspread out 3.2 mm after propagating 140 mm in the plate.\n", "  Acoustic material parameters of gas hydrate bearing porous rocks are\nimportant for evaluation of methods to exploit the vast methane gas resources\npresent in the earth's subsurface, potentially combined with CO2 injection. A\nsolid buffer method for measuring changes of the compressional wave velocity in\nporous rocks with changing methane hydrate contents under high-pressure\nhydrate-forming conditions, is tested and evaluated with respect to effects\ninfluencing on the measurement accuracy. The limited space available in the\npressure chamber represents a challenge for the measurement method. Several\neffects affect the measured compressional wave velocity, such as interference\nfrom sidewall reflections, diffraction effects, the amount of torque (force)\nused to achieve acoustic coupling, and water draining of the watersaturated\nrock specimen. Test measurements using the solid buffer method in the pressure\nchamber at atmospheric conditions are compared to independent measurements\nusing a water-bath immersion measurement method. Compressional wave velocity\nmeasurements have been done in the steady state region at frequency 500 kHz for\nvarious specimen made of plexiglas and Bentheim sandstone. Finite element\nsimulations of the solid buffer measurement method with plexiglas specimen have\nbeen used for comparison with the measurements, and to aid in the design,\ncontrol, and evaluation of the measurement method and results. Highly favorable\nagreement between the two measurement methods has been obtained, also with\nrespect to repeatability and reproducibility. The results indicate that the\nsolid buffer method may be suitable for use in the pressure chamber with\nBentheim sandstone and changing methane hydrate contents under high-pressure\nhydrate-forming conditions, for quantitative measurements of the compressional\nwave velocity in such rock core samples at these frequencies.\n", "  An overview of the target echo strength (TS) modelling capacity at the\nSwedish Defense Research Agency (FOI) is presented. The modelling methods\ndescribed range from approximate ones, such as raytracing and Kirchhoff\napproximation codes, to high accuracy full field codes including boundary\nintegral equation methods and finite elements methods. Illustrations of the\napplicability of the codes are given for a few simple cases tackled during the\nBeTTSi II (Benchmark Target Echo Strength Simulation) workshop held in Kiel\n2014.\n", "  The interaction of ultrasonic waves with fluid-embedded viscoelastic plates,\npipes, and shells, have been subject to extensive theoretical and experimental\nstudies over several decades. In normal-incidence through-transmission\nmeasurements of a water-embedded solid plate using ultrasonic piezoelectric\ntransducer sound fields, significant deviations from plane wave theory have\nrecently been observed. To quantitatively describe such measured phenomena,\nfinite element modeling (FEM), also combined with an angular spectrum method\n(ASM), have been used for three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the\nvoltage-to-sound-pressure signal propagation through the electro-acoustic\nmeasurement system consisting of the piezoelectric transducer, the\nwater-embedded steel plate, and the fluid regions at both sides of the plate.\nThe observed phenomena of frequency downshift of the plate resonance, increased\nsound pressure level through the plate, and beam narrowing / widening, are\nascribed to the finite angular spectrum of the beam, that excites a region of\nnegative and zero group velocity for the leaky Lamb mode in question.\n", "  A detailed understanding of the population and coherence dynamics in\noptically driven individual emitters in solids and their signatures in\nultrafast nonlinear-optical signals is of prime importance for their\napplications in future quantum and optical technologies. In a combined\nexperimental and theoretical study on exciton complexes in single semiconductor\nquantum dots we reveal a detailed picture of the dynamics employing three-beam\npolarization-resolved four-wave mixing (FWM) micro-spectroscopy. The\noscillatory dynamics of the FWM signals in the exciton-biexciton system is\ngoverned by the fine-structure splitting and the biexciton binding energy in an\nexcellent quantitative agreement between measurement and analytical\ndescription. The analysis of the excitation conditions exhibits a dependence of\nthe dynamics on the specific choice of polarization configuration, pulse areas\nand temporal ordering of driving fields. The interplay between the transitions\nin the four-level exciton system leads to rich evolution of coherence and\npopulation. Using two-dimensional FWM spectroscopy we elucidate the\nexciton-biexciton coupling and identify neutral and charged exciton complexes\nin a single quantum dot. Our investigations thus clearly reveal that FWM\nspectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize spectral and dynamical\nproperties of single quantum structures.\n", "  The light collection of the extruded scintillator strip samples with WLS\nfibers placed in the longitudinal hole in the plates was measured. The holes\nwere filled with various liquid fillers. Measurements were carried out under\nirradiation by cosmic muons. The method of pumping liquid filler with viscosity\nmore than 10 Pa*s in the strip hole with WLS fiber inside was designed and\nsuccessfully tested.\n", "  The irreducible representations of the group C4(direct product)V can be used\nto distinguish polarization eigenmodes, to account for their degeneracies and\nto associate them with particular magnetic crystal classes. The occurrence of\nthis finite Abelian group points to a possible connection with topology but,\nirrespective of this, qualitative features of gyrotropy in condensed media can\nbe approached in a way that does not depend on arbitrarily truncated tensor\nexpansions.\n", "  The SEHRS and SERS spactra of 4,4 - Bipyridine are analyzed on the base of\nthe Dipole-Quadrupole theory for two possible geometries of the molecule. It is\ndemonstrated that there appear strong lines caused by vibrations transforming\nafter a unit irreducible representation both for the geometry with D2 and D2h\nsymmetry groups, which may probably describe the symmetry properties of the\nmolecule. Appearance of these lines is associated with a strong quadrupole\nlight-molecule interaction, which arises in nano size rregions of sharp\nroughness of the metal. In addition, there are the lines caused by\ncontributions from both the vibrations transforming after the unit irredicible\nrepresentations A or Ag and the representations B1 or B1u, respectively, which\ndescribe transformational properties of the Ez component of the dipole moment,\nwhich is perpendicular to the surface for both geometries. This result is\nassociated with a specific geometry of the molecule, when the indicated\nvibrations can be nearly degenerated and can not be resolved by the SEHRS and\nSERS spectra analysis. This issue is in a full compliance with the results of\nthe SEHRS and SERS Dipole-Quadrupole theory.\n", "  The simple realistic model of the tippe top is considered. An averaged system\nof equations of motion is obtained in special evolutionary variables. Through\nthe qualitative analysis of this system the general features of the motion of\nthe top are obtained. Finally, some numerical results are presented.\n", "  We derive a generalized Minkowski Energy Momentum Tensor for a monochromatic\nwave in a lossless medium exhibiting temporal and spatial dispersion. The\nEnergy Momentum Tensor is then related to familiar expressions for energy\ndensity and energy flux, as well as new expressions for momentum density and\nmomentum flux.\n", "  A screened charge by a Yukawa potential implies that the corresponding\nelectric field is assimptotically zero far away from a small radius scaling.\nConsidering a screened charge, we have a modified metric of type\nYukawa-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime, that assimptotically decays from a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime to a Schwarzschild spacetime. This implies that\nthe singularity is screened by distance reducing from two singularities to one\nsingle singularity for a suitable distance. We consider the tetrad fields\nassociated to the Yukawa-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime and show that a linear\nmotion in the proper time lead to suitable estimatives to the Yukawa screening\nparameter associated to a Schwarzschild radius.\n", "  Heavy quarks (charm and bottoms) are one of the few probes which are\nsensitive to the degrees of freedom of a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), which cannot\nbe revealed by lattice gauge calculations in equilibrium. Due to the rapid\nexpansion of the QGP energetic heavy quarks do not come to an equilibrium with\nthe QGP. Their energy loss during the propagation through the QGP medium\ndepends strongly on the modelling of the interaction of the heavy quarks with\nthe QGP quarks and gluons, i.e. on the assuption of the degrees of freedom of\nthe plasma. Here we compare the results of different models, the pQCD based\nMonte-Carlo (MC@sHQ), the Dynamical Quasi Particle Model (DQPM) and the\neffective mass approach, for the drag force in a thermalized QGP and discuss\nthe sensitivity of heavy quark energy loss on the properties of the QGP as well\nas on non-equilibrium dynamics\n", "  This paper documents results from a recent computational study aimed at\nde-sensitizing fan stage aerodynamics---in a modern, high bypass ratio\naero-engine---to the effects of rear-seal leakage flows. These flows are the\nresult of seal erosion between a rotor and stator disk in an engine, and\ndeterioration over the life of an engine. The density-matching technique for\noptimization under uncertainty was applied to this problem. This involved RANS\nand adjoint flow solves of a full fan stage carried out at two different\nleakage conditions. Here a detailed analysis of the fan stage aerodynamics is\ncarried out to determine why exactly the new design is more insensitive to the\neffects of leakage flows. Specifically, it is shown that this insensitivity is\nattributed to three main factors: a slight rearward shift in loading, and thus\na reduction in incidence; a reduction in the cross-passage pressure gradient;\nand a re-acceleration of the flow towards the trailing edge, which prevented\nany corner separation.\n", "  Global strings (those which couple to Goldstone modes) may play a role in\ncosmology. In particular, if the QCD axion exists, axionic strings may control\nthe efficiency of axionic dark matter abundance. The string network dynamics\ndepend on the string intercommutation efficiency (whether strings re-connect\nwhen they cross). We point out that the velocity and angle in a collision\nbetween global strings \"renormalize\" between the network scale and the\nmicroscopic scale, and that this plays a significant role in their\nintercommutation dynamics. We also point out a subtlety in treating\nintercommutation of very nearly antiparallel strings numerically. We find that\nthe global strings of a O(2)-breaking scalar theory do intercommute for all\nphysically relevant angles and velocities.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum computing is an analog quantum computing scheme with\nvarious applications in solving optimization problems. In the parity picture of\nquantum optimization, the problem is encoded in local fields that act on qubits\nwhich are connected via local 4-body terms. We present an implementation of a\nparity annealer with Transmon qubits with a specifically tailored Ising\ninteraction from Josephson ring modulators.\n", "  The conditions for the cancellation of one loop contributions to vacuum\nenergy (both U.V. divergent and finite) coming from the known (Standard Model)\nfields and the field associated with the hypothetical 750 Gev diphoton excess\nare examined. Depending on the nature of this latter resonance we find that in\norder to satisfy the constraints (sum rules) different additional, minimal\nfield contributions are required, leading to yet to be observed particles.\n", "  The choice of the regularization scheme in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is\ncrucial for the predicted phenomenology. We outline how the improved scheme can\nbe naturally realized in Quantum Reduced Loop Gravity, describing the Universe\nas an ensemble of microstates labeled by different graphs. The new effective\ndynamics presents corrections to LQC, which do not significantly affect the\nbouncing scenario for the most relevant kinds of matter fields in cosmology $(w\n\\leq 1)$.\n", "  We construct mass-radius relations of white dwarfs taking into account the\neffects of rotation and finite temperatures. We compare and contrast the\ntheoretical mass-radius relations with observational data.\n", "  We investigate isolated sub- and super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs which lose\nangular momentum through magnetic dipole braking. We construct constant rest\nmass sequences by fulfilling all stability criteria of rotating configurations\nand show how the main structure of white dwarfs such as the central density,\nmean radius and angular velocity change with time. We explicitly demonstrate\nthat all isolated white dwarfs regardless of their masses, by angular momentum\nloss, shrink and increase their central density. We also analyze the effects of\nthe structure parameters on the evolution timescale both in the case of\nconstant magnetic field and constant magnetic flux.\n", "  We investigate the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations of low-mass X-ray\nbinaries within the Hartle-Thorne spacetime. On the basis the relativistic\nprecession model we extract the total mass $M$, angular momentum $J$, and\nquadrupole moment $Q$ of a compact object in a low-mass X-ray binary by\nanalyzing the data of the Z -source GX 5-1. In view of the recent neutron star\nmodel we compute the radius, angular velocity and other parameters of this\nsource by imposing the observational and theoretical constraints on the\nmass-radius relation.\n", "  We establish exponential bounds on the Ginzburg-Landau order parameter away\nfrom the curve where the applied magnetic field vanishes. In the units used in\nthis paper, the estimates are valid when the parameter measuring the strength\nof the applied magnetic field is comparable with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter.\nThis completes a previous work by the authors analyzing the case when this\nstrength was much higher. Our results display the distribution of surface and\nbulk superconductivity and are valid under the assumption that the magnetic\nfield is H\\\"older continuous.\n", "  We present an analytical description of the large-amplitude stationary\noscillations of the finite discrete system of harmonically-coupled pendulums\nwithout any restrictions to their amplitudes (excluding a vicinity of $\\pi$).\nAlthough this model has numerous applications in different fields of physics it\nwas studied earlier in the infinite limit only. The developed approach allows\nto find the dispersion relations for arbitrary amplitudes of the nonlinear\nnormal modes. We underline that the long-wavelength approximation, which is\ndescribed by well- known sine-Gordon equation leads to inadequate zone\nstructure for the amplitude order of $\\pi/2$ even if the chain is long enough.\nThe extremely complex zone structure at the large amplitudes corresponds to lot\nof resonances between nonlinear normal modes even with strongly different wave\nnumbers. Due to complexity of the dispersion relations the more short\nwavelength modes can possess the smaller frequencies. The numerical simulation\nof the dynamics of the finite-length chain is in a good agreement with obtained\nanalytical predictions.\n", "  Microorganisms naturally move in microstructured fluids. Using the simulation\nmethod of multi-particle collision dynamics, we study an undulatory Taylor line\nswimming in a two-dimensional microchannel and in a cubic lattice of obstacles,\nwhich represent simple forms of a microstructured environment. In the\nmicrochannel the Taylor line swims at an acute angle along a channel wall with\na clearly enhanced swimming speed due to hydrodynamic interactions with the\nbounding wall. While in a dilute obstacle lattice swimming speed is also\nenhanced, a dense obstacle lattice gives rise to geometric swimming. This new\ntype of swimming is characterized by a drastically increased swimming speed.\nSince the Taylor line has to fit into the free space of the obstacle lattice,\nthe swimming speed is close to the phase velocity of the bending wave traveling\nalong the Taylor line. While adjusting its swimming motion within the lattice,\nthe Taylor line chooses a specific swimming direction, which we classify by a\nlattice vector. When plotting the swimming velocity versus the magnitude of the\nlattice vector, all our data collapse on a single master curve. Finally, we\nalso report more complex trajectories within the obstacle lattice.\n", "  We have explored the impact of sterile neutrino dark matter on core-collapse\nsupernova explosions. We have included oscillations between electron neutrinos\nor mixed $\\mu,\\tau$ neutrinos and right-handed sterile neutrinos into a\nsupernova model. We have chosen sterile neutrino masses and mixing angles that\nare consistent with sterile neutrino dark matter candidates as indicated by\nrecent x-ray flux measurements. Using these simulations, we have explored the\nimpact of sterile neutrinos on the core bounce and shock reheating. We find\nthat, for ranges of sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle consistent with most\ndark matter constraints, the shock energy can be significantly enhanced and\neven a model that does not explode can be made to explode. In addition, we have\nfound that the presence of a sterile neutrino may lead to detectable changes in\nthe observed neutrino luminosities.\n", "  Epitaxial interfaces and superlattices comprised of polar and non-polar\nperovskite oxides have generated considerable interest because they possess a\nrange of desirable properties for functional devices. In this work, emergent\npolarization in superlattices of SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and LaCrO$_3$ (LCO) is\ndemonstrated. By controlling the interfaces between polar LCO and non-polar\nSTO, polarization is induced throughout the STO layers of the superlattice.\nUsing x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy displacements of the Ti cations off-center\nwithin TiO6 octahedra along the superlattice growth direction are measured.\nThis distortion gives rise to built-in potential gradients within the STO and\nLCO layers, as measured by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Density\nfunctional theory models explain the mechanisms underlying this behavior,\nrevealing the existence of both an intrinsic polar distortion and a built-in\nelectric field, which are due to alternately positively and negatively charged\ninterfaces in the superlattice. This study paves the way for controllable\npolarization for carrier separation in multilayer materials and highlights the\ncrucial role that interface structure plays in governing such behavior.\n", "  Energetics of Cs defects at Sigma3 grain boundaries of 3C-SiC has been\nstudied using density functional theory to understand the role of the grain\nboundaries in Cs diffusion and its eventual release from the tristructural\nisotropic fuel particles (TRISO). Cs is shown to be much more stable at the\nSigma3 grain boundary than in bulk of SiC with a significant decrease (7-17eV)\nin the formation energies at the grain boundaries than in bulk. It is found to\nhave even lower formation energies than those of Ag at the Sigma3 grain\nboundaries, while this trend was opposite in the bulk SiC as demonstrate\npreviously from similar density functional theory calculations. Based on these\nresults, a possible route to control Cs release from SiC layer via\ngrain-boundary-engineering is suggested.\n", "  Raman micro-spectroscopy is well suited for studying a variety of properties\nand has been applied to wide- ranging areas. Combined with tuneable\ntemperature, Raman spectra can offer even more insights into the properties of\nmaterials. However, previous designs of variable temperature Raman microscopes\nhave made it extremely challenging to measure samples with low signal levels\ndue to thermal and positional instability as well as low collection\nefficiencies. Thus, contemporary Raman microscope has found limited\napplicability to probing the subtle physics involved in phase transitions and\nhysteresis. This paper describes a new design of a closed-cycle, Raman\nmicroscope with full polarization rotation. High collection efficiency, thermal\nand mechanical stability are ensured by both deliberate optical, cryogenic, and\nmechanical design. Measurements on two samples, Bi2Se3 and V2O3, which are\nknown as challenging due to low thermal conductivities, low signal levels\nand/or hysteretic effects, are measured with previously undemonstrated\ntemperature resolution.\n", "  A method for segmenting water bodies in optical and synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) satellite images is proposed. It makes use of the textural features of\nthe different regions in the image for segmentation. The method consists in a\nmultiscale analysis of the images, which allows us to study the images\nregularity both, locally and globally. As results of the analysis, coarse\nmultifractal spectra of studied images and a group of images that associates\neach position (pixel) with its corresponding value of local regularity (or\nsingularity) spectrum are obtained. Thresholds are then applied to the\nmultifractal spectra of the images for the classification. These thresholds are\nselected after studying the characteristics of the spectra under the assumption\nthat water bodies have larger local regularity than other soil types.\nClassifications obtained by the multifractal method are compared quantitatively\nwith those obtained by neural networks trained to classify the pixels of the\nimages in covered against uncovered by water. In optical images, the\nclassifications are also compared with those derived using the so-called\nNormalized Differential Water Index (NDWI).\n", "  Many natural and industrial processes rely on constrained transport, such as\nproteins moving through cells, particles confined in nanocomposite materials or\ngels, individuals in highly dense collec- tives and vehicular traffic\nconditions. These are examples of motion through crowded environments, in which\nthe host matrix may retain some glass-like dynamics. Here we investigate\nconstrained transport in a colloidal model system, in which dilute small\nspheres move in a slowly rearranging, glassy matrix of large spheres. Using\nconfocal differential dynamic microscopy and simulations, we discover a\ncritical size asymmetry at which anomalous collective transport of the small\nparticles appears, manifested as a logarithmic decay of the density\nautocorrelation functions. We demonstrate that the matrix mobility is central\nfor the observed anomalous behaviour. These results, crucially depending on\nsize-induced dynamic asymmetry, are of relevance for a wide range of phenomena\nranging from glassy systems to cell biology.\n", "  We present six epochs of spectropolarimetric observations of the\nhot-Jupiter-hosting star $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis that extend the exceptional previous\nmulti-year data set of its large-scale magnetic field. Our results confirm that\nthe large-scale magnetic field of $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis varies cyclicly, with the\nobservation of two further magnetic reversals; between December 2013 and May\n2014 and between January and March 2015. We also show that the field evolves in\na broadly solar-type manner in contrast to other F-type stars. We further\npresent new results which indicate that the chromospheric activity cycle and\nthe magnetic activity cycles are related, which would indicate a very rapid\nmagnetic cycle. As an exemplar of long-term magnetic field evolution, $\\tau$\nBo\\\"otis and this longterm monitoring campaign presents a unique opportunity\nfor studying stellar magnetic cycles.\n", "  Imaging based on successive repeated snapshot measurement is modeled as a\nsource coding process in information theory. The necessary number of\nmeasurement to maintain a certain level of error rate is depicted as the\nrate-distortion function of the source coding. Quantitative formula of the\nerror rate versus measurement number relation is derived, based on the\ninformation capacity of imaging system. Second order fluctuation correlation\nimaging (SFCI) experiment with pseudo-thermal light verifies this formula,\nwhich paves the way for introducing information theory into the study of ghost\nimaging (GI), both conventional and computational.\n", "  We propose a novel solid-phase epitaxy technique applicable to high annealing\ntemperatures up to 1000 C without re-vaporization of alkali metal elements with\nhigh vapor pressures. This technique is demonstrated through the successful\ngrowth of high-quality KFe2As2 epitaxial films. The key factors are employing a\ncustom-designed alumina vessel/cover and sealing it in a stainless tube with a\nlarge amount of atmospheric KFe2As2 powder in tightly closed sample spaces.\nThis technique can also be effective for other materials composed of elements\nwith very high vapor pressures, such as alkali metals, and can lead to the\nrealization of spintronics devices in the future using KFe2As2.\n", "  We characterised a TES-based X-ray microcalorimeter in an adiabatic\ndemagnetisation refrigerator (ADR) using synchrotron radiation. The detector\nresponse and energy resolution was measured at the beam-line in the PTB\nradiometry laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II in the range from\n200 to 1800 eV. We present and discuss the results of the energy resolution\nmeasurements as a function of energy, beam intensity and detector working\npoint. The measured energy resolution ranges between 1.5 to 2.1 eV in the\ninvestigated energy range and is weakly dependent on the detector set point. A\nfirst analysis shows a count-rate capability, without considerable loss of\nperformance, of about 500 counts per second.\n", "  We are developing Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) for the read-out of TES\nimaging microcalorimeter arrays for future X-ray missions like IXO. In the\nFDMconfiguration the TES is AC voltage biased at a well defined frequencies\n(between 0.3 to 10MHz) and acts as an AM modulating element. In this paper we\nwill present a full comparison of the performance of a TES microcalorimeter\nunder DC bias and AC bias at a frequency of 370kHz. In both cases we measured\nthe current-to-voltage characteristics, the complex impedance, the noise, the\nX-ray responsivity, and energy resolution. The behaviour is very similar in\nboth cases, but deviations in performances are observed for detector working\npoints low in the superconducting transition (R/RN < 0.5). The measured energy\nresolution at 5.89keV is 2.7eV for DC bias and 3.7eV for AC bias, while the\nbaseline resolution is 2.8eV and 3.3eV, respectively.\n", "  In the B\\\"uttiker-Landauer perturbation approach to electron tunnelling,\nthrough a time-modulated rectilinear potential barrier, the Tien-Gordon\nidentity was invoked, together with its infinite energy spectrum. Here, an\nexact treatment is presented which is based on the temporal wave-function\nmatching procedure, that led to a finite energy spectrum. In seeking the\ncondition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler\nformula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which\ndiscretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy\nharmonic equations. As a result, a finite system of inelastic scattering\nchannels was created. When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was\nscattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering\nchannels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating\nfield, during the transit period across the dynamic barrier. The absorption and\nemission times of barrier traversal, T_+ and T_-, respectively, were derived\nfor the low and high frequency regimes of the barrier oscillations.\nCalculations revealed that in the low (high) frequency situation T_+= T_- (T_+<\nT_-).\n", "  Comparing the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ values for\ndifferent types of particles, or the same type of particles with different\nenergies is an important method to test the Einstein Equivalence Principle\n(EEP). Assuming that the observed time delays are dominated by the\ngravitational potential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, better\nresults of EEP constraints can be obtained. In this paper, we apply photons\nfrom three kinds of cosmic transients, including TeV blazars, gamma-ray bursts\nas well as fast radio bursts to constrain EEP. With a gravitational field far\nmore stronger than a single galaxy, we obtain 4--5 orders of magnitude more\nstringent than the pervious results.\n", "  SRON is developing the Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) readout and the\nultra low NEP TES bolometers array for the infrared spectrometer SAFARI on\nboard of the Japanese space mission SPICA. The FDM prototype of the instrument\nrequires critical and complex optimizations. For single pixel characterization\nunder AC bias we are developing a simple FDM system working in the frequency\nrange from 1 to 5 MHz, based on the open loop read-out of a linearized\ntwo-stage SQUID amplifier and high Q lithographic LC resonators. We describe\nthe details of the experimental set-up required to achieve low power loading (<\n1 fW) and low noise (NEP $\\sim 10^{-19} W/Hz^{1/2}$) in the TES bolometers. We\nconclude the paper by comparing the performance of a $4 \\cdot 10^{-19}\nW/Hz^{1/2}$ TES bolometer measured under DC and AC bias.\n", "  At SRON we are studying the performance of a Goddard Space Flight Center\nsingle pixel TES microcalorimeter operated in an AC bias configuration. For\nx-ray photons at 6 keV the pixel shows an x-ray energy resolution $dE_{FWHM} =\n3.7\\mathrm{eV}$, which is about a factor 2 worse than the energy resolution\nobserved in an identical DC-biased pixel. In order to better understand the\nreasons for this discrepancy we characterised the detector as a function of\ntemperature, bias working point and applied perpendicular magnetic field. A\nstrong periodic dependency of the detector noise on the TES AC bias voltage is\nmeasured. We discuss the results in the framework of the recently observed\nweak-link behaviour of a TES microcalorimeter\n", "  At SRON we are developing the Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) for the\nread-out of the TES-based detector array for the future infrared and X-ray\nspace mission. We describe the performances of a multiplexer designed to\nincrease the experimental throughput in the characterisation of ultra-low noise\nequivalent power (NEP) TES bolometers and high energy resolving power X-ray\nmicrocalorimeters arrays under ac and dc bias. We discuss the results obtained\nusing the TiAu TES bolometers array fabricated at SRON with measured dark NEP\nbelow $5\\cdot 10^{-19}W/Hz^{1/2}$ and saturation power of several fW\n", "  Network topology inference is a cornerstone problem in statistical analyses\nof complex systems. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates\nbenefits from convex optimization and graph signal processing, to identify the\nso-termed graph shift operator (encoding the network topology) given only the\neigenvectors of the shift. These spectral templates can be obtained, for\nexample, from principal component analysis of a set of graph signals defined on\nthe particular network. The novel idea is to find a graph shift that while\nbeing consistent with the provided spectral information, it endows the network\nstructure with certain desired properties such as sparsity. The focus is on\ndeveloping efficient recovery algorithms along with identifiability conditions\nfor two particular shifts, the adjacency matrix and the normalized graph\nLaplacian. Application domains include network topology identification from\nsteady-state signals generated by a diffusion process, and design of a graph\nfilter that facilitates the distributed implementation of a prescribed linear\nnetwork operator. Numerical tests showcase the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms in recovering synthetic and structural brain networks.\n", "  The ability of Earths mantle to conduct heat by radiation is determined by\noptical properties of mantle phases. Optical properties of mantle minerals at\nhigh pressure are accessible through diamond anvil cell experiments, but\nbecause of the extensive thermal radiation at T above 1000 K such studies are\nlimited to lower temperatures. Particularly uncertain is the\ntemperature-dependence of optical properties of lower mantle minerals across\nthe spin transition as the spin state itself is a strong function of\ntemperature. Here we use laser-heated DACs combined with a pulsed bright\nsupercontinuum laser probe and a synchronized time-gated detector to examine\noptical properties of high and low spin ferrous iron at 45-73 GPa and to 1600 K\nin FeO6, one of the most abundant building blocks in the mantle. Siderite\n(FeCO3) is used as a model for FeO6-octahedra as it contains no ferric iron and\nexhibits a sharp optically apparent spin transition at 44 GPa, simplifying data\ninterpretation. We find that the optical absorbance of low spin FeO6 is\nsubstantially increased at 1000-1200 K due to the partially lifted Laporte\nselection rule. The temperature-induced low to high spin transition, however,\nresults in a dramatic drop in absorbance of the FeO6-unit. The absorption edge\n(Fe-O charge transfer) red-shifts (~ 1 cm-1/K) with increasing temperature and\nat T above 1600 K becomes the dominant absorption mechanism in the visible\nrange, suppressing radiative conductivity. This implies that the radiative\nconductivity of analogous FeO6-bearing minerals such as ferropericlase, the\nsecond most abundant mineral in the Earths lower mantle, is substantially\nreduced approaching the core-mantle boundary conditions. Finally, our results\nemphasize that optical properties of mantle minerals probed at room temperature\nare insufficient to model radiative thermal conductivity of planetary\ninteriors.\n", "  The zero divisor of the theta function of a compact Riemann surface $X$ of\ngenus $g$ is the canonical theta divisor of Pic${}^{(g-1)}$ up to translation\nby the Riemann constant $\\Delta$ for a base point $P$ of $X$. The complement of\nthe Weierstrass gaps at the base point $P$ given as a numerical semigroup plays\nan important role, which is called the Weierstrass semigroup. It is classically\nknown that the Riemann constant $\\Delta$ is a half period\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_\\tau$ for the Jacobi variety\n$\\mathcal{J}(X)=\\mathbb{C}^g/\\Gamma_\\tau$ of $X$ if and only if the Weierstrass\nsemigroup at $P$ is symmetric. In this article, we analyze the non-symmetric\ncase. Using a semi-canonical divisor $D_0$, we show a relation between the\nRiemann constant $\\Delta$ and a half period $\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_\\tau$ of the\nnon-symmetric case. We also identify the semi-canonical divisor $D_0$ for\ntrigonal curves, and remark on an algebraic expression for the Jacobi inversion\nproblem using the relation\n", "  We obtain a complete solution to the problem of classifying all\ntwo-dimensional ideal fluid flows with harmonic Lagrangian labelling maps;\nthus, we explicitly provide all solutions, with the specified structural\nproperty, to the incompressible two-dimensional Euler equations (in Lagrangian\nvariables).\n", "  We present the design, implementation and alignment procedure for a two-stage\ntime delay compensating monochromator. The setup spectrally filters the\nradiation of a high-order harmonic generation source providing\nwavelength-selected XUV pulses with a bandwidth of 300 to 600~meV in the photon\nenergy range of 3 to 50~eV. XUV pulses as short as $12\\pm3$~fs are\ndemonstrated. Transmission of the 400~nm (3.1~eV) light facilitates precise\nalignment of the monochromator. This alignment strategy together with the\nstable mechanical design of the motorized beamline components enables us to\nautomatically scan the XUV photon energ in pump-probe experiments that require\nXUV beam pointing stability. The performance of the beamline is demonstrated by\nthe generation of IR-assisted sidebands in XUV photoionization of argon atoms.\n", "  This lecture note covers Relativistic Kinematics, which is very useful for\nthe beginners in the field of high-energy physics. A very practical approach\nhas been taken, which answers \"why and how\" of the kinematics useful for\nstudents working in the related areas.\n", "  The Voyagers (V) 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometers (UVS) data harvest covers\nouter planets encounters, heliosphere sky-background measurements, and stellar\nspectrophotometry. Because their operation period overlaps with many\nultraviolet missions, the V1 and V2 UVS calibration with other spectrometers\nare invaluable. Here we revisit the UVS calibration to assess the intriguing\n243 % (V1) and 156 % (V2) sensitivity enhancements recently proposed. Using the\nSaturn Lyman-$\\alpha$ airglow, observed in-situ by both Voyagers, and remotely\nby IUE, we match the Voyager values to IUE, taking into account the shape of\nthe Saturn Lyman-$\\alpha$ line observed with the Goddard High Resolution\nSpectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. For all known ranges of the\ninterplanetary hydrogen density, we show that the V1 and V2 UVS sensitivities\ncannot be enhanced by the amounts thus far proposed. The same diagnostic holds\nfor distinct channels covering the diffuse HeI 58.4 nm emission. Our\nprescription is to keep the original calibration of the Voyager UVS with a\nmaximum uncertainty of 30 %, making both instruments some of the most stable\nEUV/FUV spectrographs of the history of space exploration. In that frame, we\nreassess the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission excess detected by Voyager UVS deep in the\nheliosphere, to show its consistency with the heliospheric but not the galactic\norigin. Our finding confirms results obtained nearly two decades ago--namely,\nthe UVS discovery of the heliosphere distortion and the corresponding local\ninterstellar magnetic field's obliquity ($\\sim40^{\\circ}$ from upwind) in the\nsolar system neighborhood-- without requiring any revision of the Voyager UVS\ncalibration.\n", "  The high energy radiation emitted by black hole X-ray binaries originates in\nan accretion disk, hence the variability of the lightcurves mirrors the\ndynamics of the disc. We study the time evolution of the emitted flux in order\nto find evidences, that low dimensional non-linear equations govern the\naccretion flow. Here we test the capabilities of our novel method to find\nchaotic behaviour on the two numerical time series describing the motion of a\ntest particle around a black hole surrounded by a thin massive disc, one being\nregular and the other one chaotic.\n", "  Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov introduced a powerful invariant, the 3D-index,\nassociated to a suitable ideal triangulation of a 3-manifold with torus\nboundary components. The 3D-index is a collection of formal power series in\n$q^{1/2}$ with integer coefficients. Our goal is to explain how the 3D-index is\na generating series of normal surfaces associated to the ideal triangulation.\nThis shows a connection of the 3D-index with classical normal surface theory,\nand fulfills a dream of constructing topological invariants of 3-manifolds\nusing normal surfaces.\n", "  This dissertation as a whole aims to provide means to better understand\nhot-Jupiter planets through observing, performing thermochemical calculations,\nand modeling their atmospheres. We used Spitzer multi-wavelength\nsecondary-eclipse observations and targets with high signal-to-noise ratios, as\ntheir deep eclipses allow us to detect signatures of spectral features and\nassess planetary atmospheric structure and composition with greater certainty.\nChapter 1 gives a short introduction. Chapter 2 presents the Spitzer\nsecondary-eclipse analysis and atmospheric characterization of WASP-14b.\nWASP-14b is a highly irradiated, transiting hot Jupiter. By applying a Bayesian\napproach in the atmospheric analysis, we found an absence of thermal inversion\ncontrary to theoretical predictions. Chapter 3 describes the infrared\nobservations of WASP-43b Spitzer secondary eclipses, data analysis, and\natmospheric characterization. WASP-43b is one of the closest-orbiting hot\nJupiters, orbiting one of the coolest stars with a hot Jupiter. The atmospheric\nanalysis ruled out a strong thermal inversion in its dayside atmosphere.\nChapter 4 presents an open-source Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA)\ncode and its application to several hot Jupiters. TEA calculates the abundances\nof gaseous species using the Gibbs free-energy minimization method within an\niterative Lagrangian optimization scheme. The code is written in Python and\navailable to the community via http://github.com/dzesmin/TEA. Chapter 5\npresents my contributions to an open-source Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative\nTransfer (BART) code, and its application to WASP-43b. BART characterizes\nplanetary atmospheres based on the observed spectroscopic information. It\ninitializes a planetary atmospheric model, performs radiative-transfer\ncalculations to produce models of planetary spectra, and using a statistical\nmodule compares models with observations.\n", "  Social status refers to the relative position within the society. It is an\nimportant notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring\nsocial status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed\nto assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment,\noccupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes\ndifficult to collect or measure.\n  We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status.\nOnline activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are\ninterested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social\nstatus can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in\nreality.\n  In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study.\nA user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted\nsocial status of users to the \"status\" of real-world entities, e.g.,\nuniversities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate\npredicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient\nalgorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million\nusers from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social\nstatus with reasonable accuracy using social network data. We also point out\nchallenges and limitations of this approach, e.g., inconsistence between online\npopularity and real-world status for certain users. Our findings provide\ninsights on analyzing online social status and future designs of ranking\nschemes for social networks.\n", "  The magnetic-field-induced assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) provides\na unique and flexible strategy in the design and the fabrication of functional\nnanostructures and devices. We have investigated the field-driven self-assembly\nof core-shell magnetite NPs dispersed in toluene by means of in situ small\nangle neutron scattering (SANS). The form factor of the core-shell NPs was\ncharacterized and analyzed using SANS with polarized neutrons. Large-scale\naggregation of magnetite NPs has formed above 0.02 T as indicated by very-small\nangle neutron scattering measurements. Three-dimensional long-range ordered\nsuperlattice of magnetite NPs was revealed under the application of moderate\nmagnetic field. The crystal structure of the superlattice has been identified\nas a face-centered cubic one.\n", "  We report on a theoretical work on magnetotransport under terahertz radiation\nwith high mobility two-dimensional electron systems. We focus on the\ninteraction between the obtained radiation-induced magnetoresistance\noscillations (RIRO) and the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdHO) oscillations. We study two\neffects experimentally obtained with this radiation. First, the observed\ndisappearance of the SdHO oscillations simultaneously with the vanishing\nresistance at the zero resistance states region. And secondly the strong\nmodulation of the SdHO oscillations at sufficient terahertz radiation power. We\nconclude that both effects share the same physical origin, the interference\nbetween the average advanced distance by the scattered electron between\nirradiated Landau states, (RIRO), and the available initial density of states\nat a certain magnetic field, (SdHO). Thus, from a physical standpoint, what the\nterahertz experiments and theoretical simulations reveal is, on the one hand,\nthe oscillating nature of the Landau states subjected to radiation and, on the\nother hand, how they behave in the presence of scattering.\n", "  We prove local smoothing, local energy decay and weighted Strichartz\ninequalities for fractional Schr\\\"odinger equations with a Aharonov-Bohm\nmagnetic field in 2D. Explicit representations of the flows in terms of\nspherical expansions of the Hamiltonians are involved in the study. An\nimprovement of the free estimate is proved, when the total flux of the magnetic\nfield through the unit sphere is not an integer.\n", "  We report the measurement of the global thermal expansion coefficient of a\nconfined Bose gas of $^{87}\\rm Rb$ in a harmonic potential around the\nBose-Einstein condensation transition temperature. We use the concept of global\nthermodynamic variable, previously introduced and appropriated for a non\nhomogeneous system. The data show divergence on the thermal expansion\ncoefficient near the transition temperature and analyses of the universality\nbehavior shows a critical exponent $\\alpha = 0.15\\pm 0.09$. With this obtained\nvalue and the critical exponent for the correlation length recently presented\nin the literature we analyse the scaling law combining dimension and critical\nexponents.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of molecular oxygen (O$_2$) adsorption\ntrends on bimetallic PtNi clusters and their monometallic counterparts\nsupported on MgO(100), by means of periodic DFT calculations for sizes between\n25 up to 58 atoms. O$_2$ adsorption was studied on a variety of inequivalent\nsites for different structural motifs, such as truncated octahedral (TO),\ncuboctahedral (CO), icosahedral (Ih) and decahedral (Dh) geometries. We found\nthat O$_2$ prefers to bind on top of two metal atoms, parallel to the cluster,\nwith an average chemisorption energy of 1.09 eV (PtNi), 1.07 eV (Pt) and 2.09\neV (Ni), respectively. The largest adsorption energy values are found to be\nalong the edges between two neighbouring (111)/(111) and (111)/(100) facets;\nwhile FCC and HCP sites located on the (111) facets may show a chemisorption\nvalue lower 0.3 eV where often fast O$_2$ dissociation easily occurs. Our\nresults show that, even though it is difficult to disentangle the geometrical\nand electronic effects on the oxygen molecule adsorption, there is a strong\ncorrelation between the calculated general coordination number (GCN) and the\nchemisorp- tion map. Finally, the inclusion of dispersion corrections (DFT-D)\nleads to an overall increase on the calculated adsorption energy values but\nwith a negligible alteration on the general O$_2$ adsorption trends.\n", "  The Hokupa'a-85 curvature adaptive optics system components have been adapted\nto create a new AO-corrected coud\\'{e} instrument at the 3.67m Advanced\nElectro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope. This new AO-corrected optical path is\ndesigned to deliver an f/40 diffraction-limited focus at wavelengths longer\nthan 800nm. A new EMCCD-based dual-beam imaging polarimeter called InnoPOL has\nbeen designed and is presently being installed behind this corrected f/40 beam.\nThe InnoPOL system is a flexible platform for optimizing polarimetric\nperformance using commercial solutions and for testing modulation strategies.\nThe system is designed as a technology test and demonstration platform as the\ncoud\\'{e} path is built using off-the-shelf components wherever possible.\nModels of the polarimetric performance after AO correction show that\npolarization modulation at rates as slow as 200Hz can cause speckle\ncorrelations in brightness and focal plane location sufficient enough to change\nthe speckle suppression behavior of the modulators. These models are also\nverified by initial EMCCD scoring camera data at AEOS. Substantial instrument\ntrades and development efforts are explored between instrument performance\nparameters and various polarimetric noise sources.\n", "  We study the dynamical complexity of an open quantum driven double-well\noscillator, mapping its dependence on effective Planck's constant\n$\\hbar_{eff}\\equiv\\beta$ and coupling to the environment, $\\Gamma$. We study\nthis using stochastic Schrodinger equations, semiclassical equations, and the\nclassical limit equation. We show that (i) the dynamical complexity initially\nincreases with effective Hilbert space size (as $\\beta$ decreases) such that\nthe most quantum systems are the least dynamically complex. (ii) If the\nclassical limit is chaotic, that is the most dynamically complex (iii) if the\nclassical limit is regular, there is always a quantum system more dynamically\ncomplex than the classical system. There are several parameter regimes where\nthe quantum system is chaotic even though the classical limit is not. While\nsome of the quantum chaotic attractors are of the same family as the classical\nlimiting attractors, we also find a quantum attractor with no classical\ncounterpart. These phenomena occur in experimentally accessible regimes.\n", "  In this paper, we employ the properties of metamaterials to tailor the modes\nof metamaterial-dielectric waveguides operating at optical frequencies. We\nsurvey the effect of fishnet metamaterial structural parameters such as the\nmagnetic oscillation strength, magnetic resonance frequency and magnetic\ndamping on the double-negative refractive index frequency region in\nmetamaterials and on the hybrid-modes in slab metamaterial-dielectric\nwaveguides. To identify the robustness of the metamaterials to fluctuations in\nthe metamaterial structural parameters, we investigate the behavior of\nmetamaterials under Gaussian errors on their structural parameters. Our survey\nenables the identification of appropriate metamaterial unit-cell structure and\nthe permissive fluctuations on the structural parameters for further\napplications of metamaterials in waveguide technologies.\n", "  With the experimental data at the national nuclear data center, NNDC, we\ninvestigate systematically the emerging nuclear structure properties in the\nfirst 2+ excited energies, E(2+) and their energy ratios to the first 4+\nlevels, R = E(4+)/E(2+) in the nuclei over 28 < Z < 50 for protons, and 40 < N\n< 70 for neutrons. By introducing the pseudo-shell configurations built on the\ncombined subshells, we explain the following phenomena; a semi-double shell\nclosure, a shape phase transition, and a reinforced deformation. The reinforced\ndeformation arises suddenly at Z = 40 (or 38), N = 60 and approaches a maximum\nvalue, R = 3.3, as being centered at Z = 40, N = 64. We define this reinforced\ndeformation 'a ferro-deformation', as in the previous study [arXiv:1604.01017].\nThe shape coexistence would be expected to be, as forming a ferro-deformation,\nwith a strong rotational mode, and a near spherical shape, with a vibrational\nmode, in the transitional region at N = 58, 60, and 62 for the nuclei, with Z =\n38 and 40; 96Sr, 98Sr, 100Sr, and 98Zr, 100Zr, and 102Zr. We suggest that the\nferro-deformation should be closely associated with a strong spin-orbital\ninteraction between neutrons in the g7/2 orbital and protons in the g9/2\norbital. Such an isospin dependent spin-orbital interaction, with the same\nangular momentum, l = 4, reinforces nuclear surface toward a sudden and\ndramatic deformation, giving rise to the ferro-deformation at the critical\npoint, Z = 40, N = 64. We discuss the similarities and differences of the\nferro-deformation between the two critical points; Z = 40, N = 64 and Z = 64, N\n= 104.\n", "  We study the topological band theory of time reversal invariant topological\ninsulators and interpret the topological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant as an\nobstruction in terms of Stiefel--Whitney classes. The band structure of a\ntopological insulator defines a Pfaffian line bundle over the momentum space,\nwhose structure group can be reduced to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. So the topological\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant will be understood by the Stiefel--Whitney theory,\nwhich detects the orientability of a principal $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-bundle. Moreover,\nthe relation between weak and strong topological insulators will be understood\nbased on cobordism theory. Finally, the topological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant\ngives rise to a fully extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT).\n", "  Gold nanoflowers are known for their use as efficient host for surface\nenhanced Raman scattering of organic dye molecules. In this article, gold\nnanoflowers have been synthesised and rhodamine 6 G (R6G) molecules have been\nused as probe molecules. It is found that the gold nanoflowers can detect the\npresence of R6G molecules upto 10^{-10} M. The petals of these nanoflowers play\nan important role for the enhancement of Raman signals, and the intensity of\nRaman signals is enhanced many folds in presence of gold nanoflowers - the\nenhancement factor is of the order of 10^6. This is explained in terms of\nelectromagnetic mechanism.\n", "  There's presently a growing demand for high current proton and deuteron\nlinear accelerators based on superconducting technology to better support\nvarious fields of science. A \\b{eta}=0.09 162.5 MHz high current\nsuperconducting half wave resonator (HWR) has been designed at Peking\nUniversity to accelerate 100 mA proton beam or 50 mA deuteron beam after the\nRFQ accelerating structure. The detailed electromagnetic design, multipacting\nsimulation, mechanical analysis of the cavity will be given in this paper.\n", "  The behavior of hydrogen in iron and iron alloys is of interest in many\nfields of physics and materials science. To enable large-scale molecular\ndynamics simulations of systems with Fe-H interactions, we develop, based on\ndensity-functional theory calculations, an interatomic Fe-H potential in the\nTersoff-Brenner formalism. The obtained analytical potential is suitable for\nsimulations of H in bulk Fe as well as for modeling small FeH molecules, and it\ncan be directly combined with our previously constructed potential for the\nstainless steel Fe-Cr-C system. This will allow simulations of, e.g.,\nhydrocarbon molecule chemistry on steel surfaces. In the current work, we apply\nthe potential to simulating hydrogen-induced embrittlement in monocrystalline\nbulk Fe and in an Fe bicrystal with a grain boundary. In both cases, hydrogen\nis found to soften the material.\n", "  Dome-shape superconductivity phase diagram can commonly be observed in\ncuprate and iron-based systems via tuning parameters such as charge carrier\ndoping, pressure, bond angle, and etc. We report doping electrons from\ntransition-metal elements (TM = Co, Ni) substitution can induce high-Tc\nsuperconductivity around 35 K in Ca0.94La0.06Fe2As2, which emerges abruptly\nbefore the total suppression of the innate\nspin-density-wave/anti-ferromagnetism (SDW/AFM) state. Unexpectedly, the onset\ncritical temperature for the high-Tc superconductivity stays constant for a\nwide range of TM doping. Possible extrinsic factors like phase separation,\nchemical inhomogeneity, and charge carrier cancelation effect are all excluded.\nThis anomalous charge carrier density independent SC is very similar to the\ninterface superconductivity in La2-xSrxCuO4-La2CuO4 bilayer system. The further\nverified two-dimensional (2D) nature of superconductivity by the Tinkham's\nangular-dependent critical field model as well as by the angle-resolved\nmagneto-resistance measurements jointly supports the idea of interfacial effect\ninduced high-Tc superconductivity.\n", "  We analyse the equilibrium pile-up configurations of infinite periodic walls\nof edge dislocations which are forced against an impenetrable obstacle by a\nconstant applied shear stress. Numerically generated density distributions\nexhibit two distinct regions, for each of which we provide an interpretation\nand an analytical prediction. Near the obstacle, the influence of neighbouring\nslip planes may be neglected and the classical solution for a single slip plane\napplies. At a larger distance a linear decay is obtained. The characteristic\nlength scales of the two parts of the pile-up are shown to depend differently\non the parameters of the problem.\n", "  In tomographic adaptive-optics (AO) systems, errors due to tomographic\nwave-front reconstruction limit the performance and angular size of the\nscientific field of view (FoV), where AO correction is effective. We propose a\nmulti time-step tomographic wave-front reconstruction method to reduce the\ntomographic error by using the measurements from both the current and the\nprevious time-steps simultaneously. We further outline the method to feed the\nreconstructor with both wind speed and direction of each turbulence layer. An\nend-to-end numerical simulation, assuming a multi-object AO (MOAO) system on a\n30 m aperture telescope, shows that the multi time-step reconstruction\nincreases the Strehl ratio (SR) over a scientific FoV of 10 arcminutes in\ndiameter by a factor of 1.5--1.8 when compared to the classical tomographic\nreconstructor, depending on the guide star asterism and with perfect knowledge\nof wind speeds and directions. We also evaluate the multi time-step\nreconstruction method and the wind estimation method on the RAVEN demonstrator\nunder laboratory setting conditions. The wind speeds and directions at multiple\natmospheric layers are measured successfully in the laboratory experiment by\nour wind estimation method with errors below 2 \\ms. With these wind estimates,\nthe multi time-step reconstructor increases the SR value by a factor of\n1.2--1.5, which is consistent with a prediction from end-to-end numerical\nsimulation.\n", "  The contact of water with graphene is of fundamental importance and of great\ninterest for numerous promising applications, but how graphene interacts with\nwater remains unclear. Here we used atomic force microscopy to investigate\nhydrophilic mica substrates with some regions covered by mechanically\nexfoliated graphene layers in water. In water containing air gas close to the\nsaturation concentration (within ~40%), cap-shaped nanostructures and ordered\nstripe domains were observed on graphene-covered regions, but not on pure mica\nregions. These structures did not appear on graphene when samples were immersed\nin highly degassed water, indicating that their formation was caused by\nadsorption of gas dissolved in water. Thus, atomically thin graphene, even at a\nnarrow width of 20 nm, changes the local surface chemistry of a highly\nhydrophilic substrate. Further, surface hydrophobicity significantly affects\ngas adsorption, which has broad implications for diverse phenomena in water.\n", "  Multi-phase materials are key for modern engineering applications. They are\ngenerally characterized by a high strength and ductility. Many of these\nmaterials fail by ductile fracture of the, generally softer, matrix phase. In\nthis work we systematically study the influence of the arrangement of the\nphases by correlating the microstructure of a two-phase material to the onset\nof ductile failure. A single topological feature is identified in which\ncritical levels of damage are consistently indicated. It consists of a small\nregion of the matrix phase with particles of the hard phase on both sides in a\ndirection that depends on the applied deformation. Due to this configuration, a\nlarge tensile hydrostatic stress and plastic strain is observed inside the\nmatrix, indicating high damage. This topological feature has, to some extent,\nbeen recognized before for certain multi-phase materials. This study however\nprovides insight in the mechanics involved, including the influence of the\nloading conditions and the arrangement of the phases in the material\nsurrounding the feature. Furthermore, a parameter study is performed to explore\nthe influence of volume fraction and hardness of the inclusion phase. For the\nsame macroscopic hardening response, the ductility is predicted to increase if\nthe volume fraction of the hard phase increases while at the same time its\nhardness decreases.\n", "  Compact and miniaturized devices with flexible functionalities are always\nhighly demanded in optical integrated systems. Plasmonic nanosieve has been\nsuccessfully harnessed as an ultrathin flat platform for complex manipulation\nof light, including holography, vortex generation and non-linear processes.\nCompared with most of reported single-functional devices, multi-functional\nnanosieves might find more complex and novel applications across\nnano-photonics, optics and nanotechnology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate\na promising roadmap for nanosieve-based helical devices, which achieves full\nmanipulations of optical vortices, including its generation, hybridization,\nspatial multiplexing, focusing and non-diffraction propagation etc., by\ncontrolling the geometric phase of spin light via over 121 thousands of\nspatially-rotated nano-sieves. Thanks to such spin-conversion nanosieve helical\nelements, it is no longer necessary to employ the conventional two-beam\ninterferometric measurement to characterize optical vortices, while the\ninterference can be realized natively without changing any parts of the current\nsetup. The proposed strategy makes the far-field manipulations of optical\norbital angular momentum within an ultrathin interface viable and bridges\nsingular optics and integrated optics. In addition, it enables more unique\nextensibility and flexibility in versatile optical elements than traditional\nphase-accumulated helical optical devices.\n", "  Self-gravitating system are non-equilibrium a priory. A new approach is\nproposed, which employs a non-equilibrium statistical operator into account\ninhomogeneous distribution of particles and temperature. The method involves\nthe saddle - point procedure to find the dominant contribution to the partition\nfunction and thus to obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the system.\nProbable peculiar features in the behavior of self-gravitating system are\nconsidered for various condition. The equation of state for self-gravitating\nsystem has been obtained. A new length of statistical instability and parameter\nof the spatial inhomogeneous distribution of particles and temperature are\nobtained for real gravitating system.\n", "  Matrix elements of weak currents involving light multi-meson states are\nimportant in many hadronic decays of both heavy leptons and heavy mesons. In\nthis paper we focus on the latter case where the current size of the data set\ndemands better models. The specific case of three-kaon weak matrix elements is\nconsidered and expressed as a relatively simple structure, which generalizes\nnaturally the concept of form factor. We propose a model for the decay $D^+ \\to\nK^+ K^- K^+$ as an alternative to isobar model, with free parameter predicted\nby the theory to be fine-tuned by a fit to data. An important qualitative\noutcome is that we encompass naturally all final states topologies, which\ninvolve necessarily proper multi-particle structures and cannot be decomposed\ninto simpler two-body processes. This aspect represents a significant\nimprovement when compared to isobar model, often employed in analyses of\nheavy-meson decay data.\n", "  We study relationship between the physical quantities that characterize\npion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon interaction on the basis of the fact that\nnuclear forces in the nucleon-nucleon system at low energies are mainly\ndetermined by the one-pion exchange mechanism. By making use of the recommended\nproton-proton low-energy scattering parameters, we obtain the following value\nfor the charged pion-nucleon coupling constant g$_{\\pi ^{\\pm }}^{2}/4\\pi\n=14.55(13)$. Calculated value of this quantity is in excellent agreement with\nthe experimental result g$_{\\pi ^{\\pm }}^{2}/4\\pi =14.52(26)$ of the Uppsala\nNeutron Research Group. At the same time, the obtained value of the charged\npion-nucleon coupling constant differs markedly from the value of the neutral\npion-nucleon coupling constant g$_{\\pi ^{0}}^{2}/4\\pi =13.55(13)$. Thus, our\nresults show considerable charge splitting of the pion-nucleon coupling\nconstant.\n", "  The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression is usually mitigated in higher\neukaryotes by post-transcriptional regulation channels that stabilise the\noutput layer, most notably protein levels. The discovery of small non-coding\nRNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to\nidentifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in\nregulation. Recent in vitro} and in silico studies have corroborated this\nhypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is\nhampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using\nstochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van\nKampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the\nmiRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is\nwidespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to\naccount for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the\nmodulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability\nto control static protein noise. By comparing with other regulatory\narchitectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly\noutperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests\nthat, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than\ndynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the\nperformance of regulatory elements.\n", "  We present the detailed study of the spin kinetics of the nitrogen (N) donor\nelectrons in 6H SiC wafers grown by Lely method and by sublimation \"sandwich\nmethod\" (SSM) with a donor concentration of about 10^17 cm^-3 at T = 10-40 K.\nThe donor electrons of the N donors substituting quasi-cubic \"k1\" and \"k2\"\nsites (Nk1,k2) in both types of the samples revealed the similar temperature\ndependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate (T1^-1), which was described by\nthe direct one-phonon and two-phonon processes induced by the acoustic phonons\nproportional to T and to T^9, respectively. The character of the temperature\ndependence of the T1^-1 for the donor electrons of N substituting hexagonal\n(\"h\") site (Nh) in both types of 6H SiC samples indicates that the donor\nelectrons relax through the fast-relaxing centers by means of the\ncross-relaxation process. The observed enhancement of the phase memory\nrelaxation rate (Tm^-1) with the temperature increase for the Nh donors in both\ntypes of the samples, as well as for the Nk1,k2 donors in Lely grown 6H SiC,\nwas explained by the growth of the free electron concentration with the\ntemperature increase and their exchange scattering at the N donor centers. The\nobserved significant shortening of the phase memory relaxation time Tm for the\nNk1,k2 donors in the SSM grown sample with the temperature lowering is caused\nby hopping motion of the electrons between the occupied and unoccupied states\nof the N donors at Nh and Nk1,k2 sites. The impact of the N donor pairs,\ntriads, distant donor pairs formed in n-type 6H SiC wafers on the spin\nrelaxation times was discussed.\n", "  The work proposes an extension of the quantum circuit formalism where qubits\n(wires) are circular instead of linear. The left-to-right interpretation of a\nquantum circuit is replaced by a circular representation which allows to select\nthe starting point and the direction in which gates are executed. The\nrepresentation supports all the circuits obtained after computing cyclic\npermutations of an initial quantum gate list. Two circuits, where one has a\ngate list which is a cyclic permutation of the other, will implement different\nfunctions. The main question appears in the context of scalable quantum\ncomputing, where multiple subcircuits are used for the construction of a larger\nfault-tolerant one: can the same circular representation be used by multiple\nsubcircuits? The circular circuits are sufficient for constructing\ncomputationally universal, fault-tolerant circuits formed entirely of qubit\ninitialisation, CNOT gates and qubit measurements. The main result of modelling\ncircular CNOT circuits is that a derived Boolean representation allows to\ndefine a set of equations for $X$ and $Z$ stabiliser transformations. Through a\nwell defined set of steps it is possible to reduce the initial equations to a\nset of stabiliser transformations given a series of cuts through the circular\ncircuit.\n", "  While two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TI) initiated the field of\ntopological materials, only very few materials were discovered to date and the\ndirect access to their quantum spin Hall edge states has been challenging due\nto material issues. Here, we introduce a new 2D TI material, Sb few layer\nfilms. Electronic structures of ultrathin Sb islands grown on Bi2Te2Se are\ninvestigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. The maps of local density of\nstates clearly identify robust edge electronic states over the thickness of\nthree bilayers in clear contrast to thinner islands. This indicates the\ntopological edge states emerged through a 2D topological phase transition\npredicted between three and four bilayer films in recent theory. The\nnon-trivial phase transition and edge states are confirmed for epitaxial films\nby extensive density-functional-theory calculations. This work provides an\nimportant material platform to exploit miscroscopic aspects of the quantum spin\nHall phase and its quantum phase transition.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations are carried out to investigate scalar mixing in\nan isotropic turbulent flow with a time-periodic forcing. For high amplitudes\nof the modulation, it is shown that the average mixing rate is negatively\naffected at low frequencies. In this limit the mixing time scale increases,\nwhereas the typical velocity timescale decreases. We further determine the\nfrequency response of scalar statistics to a periodic scalar-forcing.\n", "  In this paper, we reconstruct the $f(R)$ theory using the viscous $\\omega$CDM\nscenario (V-$\\omega$CDM) constrained by several differently astrophysical\nobservations, including Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational Hubble\nparameter data (OHD), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 9-year data\n(WMAP-9), Planck observations and the single data point from the newest event\nGW150914 (GW). We find that the joint constraints from SNe Ia+OHD+Planck+GW\ndata-sets give out a tighter restriction for the parameters of the\nV-$\\omega$CDM scenario than other constraints. Subsequently, we find that there\nexists a substantially high degeneracy among these reconstructed $f(R)$\ntheories in the past, and that they start exhibiting differently evolutional\nbehaviors around the present epoch as well as much different in the distant\nfuture. Furthermore, we make a comparison between the reconstructed $f(R)$\ntheory with the V-$\\omega$CDM scenario and that with the $\\omega$CDM scenario\nconstrained by using the SNe Ia+OHD+Planck+GW data-sets in the $f(R)-R$ plane,\nand find that the two scenarios share an extremely high degeneracy, which\nimplies that the effect of bulk viscosity plays a negligible role in the\nV-$\\omega$CDM model during the whole evolutionary processes of the universe. In\naddition, one can also find that the reconstructed $f(R)$ theories using the\ntwo models just deviate from the standard Einstein gravity a little.\n", "  In this paper, the design trade-offs for the implementation of small\nfootprint thermal tuners on silicon nitride are presented, and explored through\nmeasurements and supporting simulations of a photonic chip based on\nMach-Zehnder Interferometers. Firstly, the electrical properties of the tuners\nare assessed, showing a compromise between compactness and deterioration.\nSecondly, the different variables involved in the thermal efficiency, switching\npower and heater dimensions, are analysed. Finally, with focus on exploring the\nlimits of this compact tuners with regards to on chip component density, the\nthermal-cross talk is also investigated. Tuners with footprint of 270x5 {\\mu}m\n2 and switching power of 350 mW are reported, with thermal-cross talk, in terms\nof induced phase change in adjacent devices of less than one order of magnitude\nat distances over 20 {\\mu}m. Paths for the improvement of thermal efficiency,\npower consumption and resilience of the devices are also outlined\n", "  A possible explanation of the excesses observed by ATLAS in the Z+jets+MET\nchannel within the p(henomenological)MSSM is discussed. We have found that the\ncascade of first/second generation squarks to binos to Higgsino LSPs, with\njudiciously chosen sparticle masses, can provide a viable scenario that is\nconsistent with all other experimental constraints.\n", "  We study the stability of density stratified flow between co-rotating\nvertical cylinders with rotation rates $\\Omega_o < \\Omega_i$ and radius ratio\n$r_i/r_o=0.877$, where subscripts $o$ and $i$ refer to the outer and inner\ncylinders. Just as in stellar and planetary accretion disks, the flow has\nrotation, anticyclonic shear, and a stabilizing density gradient parallel to\nthe rotation axis. The primary instability of the laminar state leads not to\naxisymmetric Taylor vortex flow but to the non-axisymmetric {\\it\nstratorotational instability} (SRI), so named by Shalybkov and R\\\"udiger\n(2005). The present work extends the range of Reynolds numbers and buoyancy\nfrequencies ($N=\\sqrt{(-g/\\rho)(\\partial \\rho/\\partial z)}$) examined in the\nprevious experiments by Boubnov and Hopfinger (1997) and Le Bars and Le Gal\n(2007). Our observations reveal that the axial wavelength of the SRI\ninstability increases nearly linearly with Froude number, $Fr= \\Omega_i/N$. For\nsmall outer cylinder Reynolds number, the SRI occurs for inner inner Reynolds\nnumber larger than for the axisymmetric Taylor vortex flow (i.e., the SRI is\nmore stable). For somewhat larger outer Reynolds numbers the SRI occurs for\nsmaller inner Reynolds numbers than Taylor vortex flow and even below the\nRayleigh stability line for an inviscid fluid. Shalybkov and R\\\"udiger (2005)\nproposed that the laminar state of a stably stratified rotating shear flow\nshould be stable for $\\Omega_o/ \\Omega_i > r_i/r_o$, but we find that this\nstability criterion is violated for $N$ sufficiently large; however, the\ndestabilizing effect of the density stratification diminishes as the Reynolds\nnumber increases. At large Reynolds number the primary instability leads not to\nthe SRI but to a previously unreported nonperiodic state that mixes the fluid.\n", "  A primary goal of physics is to create mathematical models that allow both\npredictions and explanations of physical phenomena. We weave maths extensively\ninto our physics instruction beginning in high school, and the level and\ncomplexity of the maths we draw on grows as our students progress through a\nphysics curriculum. Despite much research on the learning of both physics and\nmath, the problem of how to successfully teach most of our students to use\nmaths in physics effectively remains unsolved. A fundamental issue is that in\nphysics, we don't just use maths, we think about the physical world with it. As\na result, we make meaning with math-ematical symbology in a different way than\nmathematicians do. In this talk we analyze how developing the competency of\nmathematical modeling is more than just \"learning to do math\" but requires\nlearning to blend physical meaning into mathematical representations and use\nthat physical meaning in solving problems. Examples are drawn from across the\ncurriculum.\n", "  This article considers the quasi-local energy in reference to a general\nstatic spacetime. We follow the approach developed by the authors in [19, 20,\n7, 9] and define the quasi-local energy as a difference of surface\nHamiltonians, which are derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action. The new\nquasi-local energy provides an effective gauge independent measurement of how\nfar a spacetime deviates away from the reference static spacetime on a finitely\nextended region.\n", "  We report a model for metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy on non-planar\nsubstrates, specifically V-grooves and pyramidal recesses, which we apply to\nthe growth of InGaAs nanostructures. This model, based on a set of coupled\nreaction-diffusion equations, one for each facet in the system, accounts for\nthe facet-dependence of all kinetic processes (e.g., precursor decomposition,\nadatom diffusion, and adatom lifetimes) and has been previously applied to\naccount for the temperature, concentration, and temporal-dependence of AlGaAs\nnanostructures on GaAs (111)B surfaces with V-grooves and pyramidal recesses.\nIn the present study, the growth of In$_{0.12}$Ga$_{0.88}$As quantum wires at\nthe bottom of V-grooves is used to determine a set of optimized kinetic\nparameters. Based on these parameters, we have modeled the growth of\nIn$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As nanostructures formed in pyramidal site-controlled\nquantum-dot systems, successfully producing a qualitative explanation for the\ntemperature-dependence of their optical properties, which have been reported in\nprevious studies. Finally, we present scanning electron and cross-sectional\natomic force microscopy images which show previously unreported facetting at\nthe bottom of the pyramidal recesses that allow quantum dot formation.\n", "  We investigate optically induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in [Co(0.5\nnm)/Pd(1 nm)]x5/NiFe(t) exchange-spring samples with tilted perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy using a time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect\nmagnetometer. The competition between the out-of-plane anisotropy of the hard\nlayer, the in-plane anisotropy of the soft layer and the applied bias field\nreorganizes the spins in the soft layer, which are modified further with the\nvariation in t. The spin-wave spectrum, the ultrafast demagnetization time, and\nthe extracted damping coefficient all depend on the spin distribution in the\nsoft layer, while the latter two also depend on the spin-orbit coupling between\nthe Co and Pd layers. The spin-wave spectra change from multimode to\nsingle-mode as t increases. At the maximum field reached in this study, H=2.5\nkOe, the damping shows a nonmonotonic dependence on t with a minimum at t=7.5\nnm. For t<7.5 nm, intrinsic effects dominate, whereas for t>7.5 nm, extrinsic\neffects govern the damping mechanisms.\n", "  Rocking rigid bodies appear in several shapes in everyday life: As furniture\nlike rocking chairs and rocking cradles or as toys like rocking horses or\ntilting dolls. The familiar rocking motion of these objects, a non-linear\ncombination of a rigid rotation and a translation of the center of mass, gives\nrise to a number of interesting dynamical properties. However, their study has\nreceived little attention in the literature.\n  This work presents a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of rocking\nrigid bodies, including a concise derivation of the equations of motion as well\nas a general inversion procedure to construct rocking rigid body shapes with\nspecified dynamical properties. Moreover, two novel rigid body shapes are\nderived - the tautochrone shape and the brachistochrone shape - which represent\nan intriguing generalization of the well-know tautochrone and brachistochrone\ncurves. In particular, tautochrone shapes offer an alternative construction of\na tautochrone pendulum, in addition to Huygens' cycloid pendulum solution.\n", "  One additional position of the famous Mataveri calendar of Easter Island has\nbeen interpreted. New data on the watchings of Venus and Aldebaran have been\nrendered. Some reports about the sun, the moon as well as Sirius are of our\ninterest, too.\n", "  Proton temperature anisotropies between the directions parallel and\nperpendicular to the mean magnetic field are usually observed in the solar wind\nplasma. Here, we employ a high-resolution hybrid particle-in-cell simulation in\norder to investigate the relation between spatial properties of the proton\ntemperature and the peaks in the current density and in the flow vorticity. Our\nresults indicate that, although regions where the proton temperature is\nenhanced and temperature anisotropies are larger correspond approximately to\nregions where many thin current sheets form, no firm quantitative evidence\nsupports the idea of a direct causality between the two phenomena. On the other\nhand, quite a clear correlation between the behavior of the proton temperature\nand the out-of-plane vorticity is obtained.\n", "  Three-dimensional interphase organization of metazoan genomes has been linked\nto cellular identity. However, the principles governing 3D interphase genome\narchitecture and its faithful transmission through disruptive events of\ncell-cycle, like mitosis, are not fully understood. By using Brownian dynamics\nsimulations of Drosophila chromosome 3R up to time-scales of minutes, we show\nthat chromatin binding profile of Polycomb-repressive-complex-1 robustly\npredicts a sub-set of topologically associated domains (TADs), and inclusion of\nother factors recapitulates the profile of all TADs, as observed\nexperimentally. Our simulations show that chromosome 3R attains interphase\norganization from mitotic state by a two-step process in which formation of\nlocal TADs is followed by long-range interactions. Our model also explains\nstatistical features and tracks the assembly kinetics of polycomb subnuclear\nclusters. In conclusion, our approach can be used to predict structural and\nkinetic features of 3D chromosome folding and its associated proteins in\nbiological relevant genomic and time scales.\n", "  In this paper we analyze how user generated content (UGC) is created,\nchallenging the well known {\\it wisdom of crowds} concept. Although it is known\nthat user activity in most settings follow a power law, that is, few people do\na lot, while most do nothing, there are few studies that characterize well this\nactivity. In our analysis of datasets from two different social networks,\nFacebook and Twitter, we find that a small percentage of active users and much\nless of all users represent 50\\% of the UGC. We also analyze the dynamic\nbehavior of the generation of this content to find that the set of most active\nusers is quite stable in time. Moreover, we study the social graph, finding\nthat those active users are highly connected among them. This implies that most\nof the wisdom comes from a few users, challenging the independence assumption\nneeded to have a wisdom of crowds. We also address the content that is never\nseen by any people, which we call digital desert, that challenges the\nassumption that the content of every person should be taken in account in a\ncollective decision. We also compare our results with Wikipedia data and we\naddress the quality of UGC content using an Amazon dataset. At the end our\nresults are not surprising, as the Web is a reflection of our own society,\nwhere economical or political power also is in the hands of minorities.\n", "  Over the past five years, 2010-2015, we have observed, in the near infrared\n(IR), the maximum magnetic field strengths for 4145 sunspot umbrae. Herein we\ndistinguish field strengths from field flux. (Most solar magnetographs measure\nflux). Maximum field strength in umbrae is co-spatial with the position of\numbral minimum brightness (Norton and Gilman, 2004). We measure field strength\nby the Zeeman splitting of the Fe 15648.5 A spectral line. We show that in the\nIR no cycle dependence on average maximum field strength (2050 G) has been\nfound +/- 20 Gauss. A similar analysis of 17,450 spots observed by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory reveal\nthe same cycle independence +/- 0.18 G., or a variance of 0.01%. This is found\nnot to change over the ongoing 2010-2015 minimum to maximum cycle. Conclude the\naverage maximum umbral fields on the Sun are constant with time.\n", "  A physical description of an opinion evolution is conducted based on the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation derived from a generalized potential and the\ncorresponding Langevin equation. The investigation mainly focuses on the\nheterogeneities such as age, connection circle and overall quality of the\nparticipants involved in the opinion exchange process. The evolutionary\npatterns of opinion can be described by solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation, information entropy. The results show that the overall qualities of\nthe participants play critical roles in forming an opinion. The higher the\noverall quality is, the easier the consensus can reach. The solution also\ndemonstrates that the age and the connection circle of the agents play equally\nimportant roles in forming an opinion. The essence of the age, overall quality,\nand connection circle corresponds to the maturity of thought (opinion inertia),\nreason and intelligence, influence strength of the environment, respectively.\nSo the information entropy distributes in the phase planes (two variable\ncombinations out of the three---age, connection circle and overall quality)\nexhibit the evolution rules of an opinion.\n", "  This work lies at an intersection of three subjects: quantum field theory,\nalgebraic geometry and number theory, in a situation where dialogue between\npractitioners has revealed rich structure. It contains a theorem and 7\nconjectures, tested deeply by 3 optimized algorithms, on relations between\nFeynman integrals and L-series defined by products, over the primes, of data\ndetermined by moments of Kloosterman sums in finite fields. There is an\nextended introduction, for readers who may not be familiar with all three of\nthese subjects. Notable new results include conjectural evaluations of\nnon-critical L-series of modular forms of weights 3, 4 and 6, by determinants\nof Feynman integrals, an evaluation for the weight 5 problem, at a critical\ninteger, and formulas for determinants of arbitrary size, tested up to 30\nloops. It is shown that the functional equation for Kloosterman moments\ndetermines much but not all of the structure of the L-series. In particular,\nfor problems with odd numbers of Bessel functions, it misses a crucial feature\ncaptured in this work by novel and intensively tested conjectures. For the\n9-Bessel problem, these lead to an astounding compression of data at the\nprimes.\n", "  The valence band offsets (VBO) for the \\b{eta}-type A3B6 layered compounds\ndepending on the thickness of the crystals have been investigated from the\nfirst principles, based on the density functional theory. To simulate the\nstructure of a given thickness the periodic slab model was used. Two adjacent\ncrystal slabs consisting of several layers were separated by a vacuum region of\ntwo-layer width. It is shown that at the crystal thickness more than 12 layers,\nphotothreshold practically becomes independent on the thickness of the crystal.\n", "  Energy storage becomes crucial for energy systems with an increasing share of\nrenewable energy sources. Artificial photosynthesis, in particular photovoltaic\nwater splitting, provides both sustainable energy generation and energy storage\nin the form of hydrogen. However, only a few concepts for scalable devices were\nreported in the literature. Here, we introduce a new concept which, by design,\nis scalable and compatible with every thin-film photovoltaic technology. The\nconcept allows for independent geometrical optimization of the photovoltaic and\nthe electrochemical part. The scalability is achieved by continuous mirroring\nof a base unit. We demonstrate a fully integrated, wireless device with a\nstable and bias-free operation for 40 hours. The concept was scaled to an area\nof 64 cm2 comprising 13 base units and exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency\nof 3.9%. The concept and its successful realization is an important\ncontribution towards the large scale application of artificial photosynthesis.\n", "  Glassy systems are disordered systems characterized by extremely slow\ndynamics. Examples are supercooled liquids, whose dynamics slow down under\ncooling. The specific pattern of slowing-down depends on the material\nconsidered. This dependence is poorly understood, in particular, it remains\ngenerally unclear which aspects of the microscopic structures control the\ndynamics and other macroscopic properties. Attacking this question is one of\nthe two main aspects of this dissertation. We have introduced a new class of\nmodels of supercooled liquids, which captures the central aspects of the\ncorrespondence between structure and elasticity on the one hand, the\ncorrelation of structure and thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the other.\nOur results shed new light on the temperature-dependence of the topology of\ncovalent networks, in particular, on the rigidity transition that occurs when\nthe valence is increased.\n  Other questions appear in glassy systems at zero temperature. In that\nsituation, a glassy system can flow if an external driving force is imposed\nabove some threshold. The first example we will consider is the erosion of a\nriverbed. Experiments support the existence of a threshold forcing, below which\nno erosion flux is observed. In this dissertation, we present a novel\nmicroscopic model to describe the erosion near threshold. This model makes new\nquantitative predictions for the spatial reparation of the flux. To study\nfurther the self-organization of driven glassy systems, we investigate the\nathermal dynamics of mean-field spin glasses. The spin glass self-organizes\ninto the configurations that are stable, but barely so. Such marginal stability\nappears with the presence of a pseudogap in soft excitations. We show that the\nemergence of a pseudogap is deeply related to very strong anti-correlations\nemerging among soft excitations.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an open quantum system interacting with a\nnon-thermal bath. Here, \"non-thermal\" means that the bath modes do not need to\nhave the same temperature, but they have an effective temperature distribution.\nWe find that, when a quantum system is interacting with such a non-thermal bath\nfar from thermal equilibrium, it is no longer proper to use any coarse-grained\nMarkovian description for the system, even when their coupling strength is\nquite weak. Especially, when there is coherent transition with strong\ninterference strength in the quantum system, the Markovian master equation\nwould bring in a serious problem of negative probability. After we consider\nsome proper non-Markovian corrections, the problem can be naturally resolved.\n", "  Circumstellar disks of planetary debris are now known or suspected to closely\norbit hundreds of white dwarf stars. To date, both data and theory support\ndisks that are entirely contained within the preceding giant stellar radii, and\nhence must have been produced during the white dwarf phase. This picture is\nstrengthened by the signature of material falling onto the pristine stellar\nsurfaces; disks are always detected together with atmospheric heavy elements.\nThe physical link between this debris and the white dwarf host abundances\nenables unique insight into the bulk chemistry of extrasolar planetary systems\nvia their remnants. This review summarizes the body of evidence supporting\ndynamically active planetary systems at a large fraction of all white dwarfs,\nthe remnants of first generation, main-sequence planetary systems, and hence\nprovide insight into initial conditions as well as long-term dynamics and\nevolution.\n", "  In recent years, a rigorous quantum mechanical model for the interaction\nbetween light and macroscopic dispersive, lossy dielectrics has emerged\n-macroscopic QED- allowing the application of the usual methods of quantum\nfield theory. Here, we apply time dependent perturbation theory to a general\nclass of problems involving time dependent lossy, dispersive dielectrics. The\nmodel is used to derive polariton excitation rates in three illustrative cases,\nincluding that of a travelling Gaussian perturbation to the susceptibility of\nan otherwise infinite homogeneous dielectric, motivated by recent experiments\non analogue Hawking radiation. We find that the excitation rate is increased\nwhen the wave--vector and frequency of each polariton in the pair either\nsatisfies (or nearly satisfies) the dispersion relation for electromagnetic\nwaves, or is close to a material resonance.\n", "  In the jet-bundle description of first-order classical field theories there\nare some elements, such as the lagrangian energy and the construction of the\nhamiltonian formalism, which require the prior choice of a connection. Bearing\nthese facts in mind, we analyze the situation in the jet-bundle description of\ntime-dependent classical mechanics. So we prove that this connection-dependence\nalso occurs in this case, although it is usually hidden by the use of the\n``natural'' connection given by the trivial bundle structure of the phase\nspaces in consideration. However, we also prove that this dependence is\ndynamically irrelevant, except where the dynamical variation of the energy is\nconcerned. In addition, the relationship between first integrals and\nconnections is shown for a large enough class of lagrangians.\n", "  We construct a lagrangian geometric formulation for first-order field\ntheories using the canonical structures of first-order jet bundles, which are\ntaken as the phase spaces of the systems in consideration. First of all, we\nconstruct all the geometric structures associated with a first-order jet bundle\nand, using them, we develop the lagrangian formalism, defining the canonical\nforms associated with a lagrangian density and the density of lagrangian\nenergy, obtaining the {\\sl Euler-Lagrange equations} in two equivalent ways: as\nthe result of a variational problem and developing the {\\sl jet field\nformalism} (which is a formulation more similar to the case of mechanical\nsystems). A statement and proof of Noether's theorem is also given, using the\nlatter formalism. Finally, some classical examples are briefly studied.\n", "  The integrability of multivector fields in a differentiable manifold is\nstudied. Then, given a jet bundle $J^1E\\to E\\to M$, it is shown that integrable\nmultivector fields in $E$ are equivalent to integrable connections in the\nbundle $E\\to M$ (that is, integrable jet fields in $J^1E$). This result is\napplied to the particular case of multivector fields in the manifold $J^1E$ and\nconnections in the bundle $J^1E\\to M$ (that is, jet fields in the repeated jet\nbundle $J^1J^1E$), in order to characterize integrable multivector fields and\nconnections whose integral manifolds are canonical lifting of sections. These\nresults allow us to set the Lagrangian evolution equations for first-order\nclassical field theories in three equivalent geometrical ways (in a form\nsimilar to that in which the Lagrangian dynamical equations of non-autonomous\nmechanical systems are usually given). Then, using multivector fields; we\ndiscuss several aspects of these evolution equations (both for the regular and\nsingular cases); namely: the existence and non-uniqueness of solutions, the\nintegrability problem and Noether's theorem; giving insights into the\ndifferences between mechanics and field theories.\n", "  In this review paper, we consider three kinds of systems of differential\nequations, which are relevant in physics, control theory and other applications\nin engineering and applied mathematics; namely: Hamilton equations, singular\ndifferential equations, and partial differential equations in field theories.\nThe geometric structures underlying these systems are presented and commented.\nThe main results concerning these structures are stated and discussed, as well\nas their influence on the study of the differential equations with which they\nare related. Furthermore, research to be developed in these areas is also\ncommented.\n", "  The first aim of this paper is to extend the Skinner-Rusk formalism on\nclassical mechanics for first-order field theories.\n  The second is to generalize the definition and properties of the evolution\nK-operator on classical mechanics for first-order field theories using in both\ncases Gunther's formalism (k-symplectic formalism).\n", "  We consider Hamiltonian systems in first-order multisymplectic field\ntheories. We review the properties of Hamiltonian systems in the so-called\nrestricted multimomentum bundle, including the variational principle which\nleads to the Hamiltonian field equations. In an analogous way to how these\nsystems are defined in the so-called extended (symplectic) formulation of\nnon-autonomous mechanics, we introduce Hamiltonian systems in the extended\nmultimomentum bundle. The geometric properties of these systems are studied,\nthe Hamiltonian equations are analyzed using integrable multivector fields, the\ncorresponding variational principle is also stated, and the relation between\nthe extended and the restricted Hamiltonian systems is established. All these\nproperties are also adapted to certain kinds of submanifolds of the\nmultimomentum bundles in order to cover the case of almost-regular field\ntheories.\n", "  We study the geometrical background of the Hamiltonian formalism of\nfirst-order Classical Field Theories. In particular, different proposals of\nmultimomentum bundles existing in the usual literature (including their\ncanonical structures) are analyzed and compared. The corresponding Legendre\nmaps are introduced. As a consequence, the definition of regular and\nalmost-regular Lagrangian systems is reviewed and extended from different but\nequivalent ways.\n", "  In this review the foundations of Geometric Quantization are explained and\ndiscussed. In particular, we want to clarify the mathematical aspects related\nto the geometrical structures involved in this theory: complex line bundles,\nhermitian connections, real and complex polarizations, metalinear bundles and\nbundles of densities and half-forms. In addition, we justify all the steps\nfollowed in the geometric quantization programme, from the standpoint\ndefinition to the structures which are successively introduced.\n", "  We state the intrinsic form of the Hamiltonian equations of first-order\nClassical Field theories in three equivalent geometrical ways: using\nmultivector fields, jet fields and connections. Thus, these equations are given\nin a form similar to that in which the Hamiltonian equations of mechanics are\nusually given. Then, using multivector fields, we study several aspects of\nthese equations, such as the existence and non-uniqueness of solutions, and the\nintegrability problem. In particular, these problems are analyzed for the case\nof Hamiltonian systems defined in a submanifold of the multimomentum bundle.\nFurthermore, the existence of first integrals of these Hamiltonian equations is\nconsidered, and the relation between {\\sl Cartan-Noether symmetries} and {\\sl\ngeneral symmetries} of the system is discussed. Noether's theorem is also\nstated in this context, both the ``classical'' version and its generalization\nto include higher-order Cartan-Noether symmetries. Finally, the equivalence\nbetween the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms is also discussed.\n", "  Starting from the observation that for neighboring orders $p=2^{n}-1,\np'=2^{n+1}-1 $ of the well-known Green's representations of parafermi algebra\nthere exists a specifiable interordinal relationship, matrices with similar\nproperties are constructed. They exhibit intrinsic Catalan structure and\nsine-like and cosine-like substructures, dubbed interordinal and intraordinal\nrespectively, that seemingly have a bearing on Euclidean geometry and\napplications via Nebe kissing numbers.\n"]}
